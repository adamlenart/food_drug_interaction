There were no intergroup differences in the prevalence of psychotic and obsessive-compulsive disorders, or of leukoaraiosis. Treatment with acetylsalicylic acid was more frequent in the VMH group, whereas other non-opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines were more commonly prescribed to patients with tinnitus. The suspected cause of VMH was dementia with Lewy bodies (n=2, one with vascular disease), Alzheimer disease (n=2, one with vascular disease), isolated cerebrovascular disease (n=3), traumatic brain injury (n=1), and surgical brainstem lesion (n=1). All VMH cases displayed an underlying factor that might prompt this symptom, eg, hearing loss (n=6), a predisposing drug (n=9), and polypharmacy (n=9).",

During the pre- (15 months, n\u2009=\u2009504) and post-period (6 months, n\u2009=\u2009156) patients' self-reported pain intensity and pain treatment were registered. Analgesic provision in patients with moderate to severe pain (NRS \u22654) improved from 46.8% to 68.0%. Over 10% of the patients refused analgesics, resulting into an actual analgesic administration increase from 36.3% to 46.1%. Median time to analgesic decreased from 10 to 7\u2009min (P\u2009<\u20090.05), whereas time to opioids decreased from 37 to 15\u2009min (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Mean pain relief significantly increased to 1.56 NRS-points, in patients who received analgesic treatment even up to 2.02 points. The protocol appeared to lead to an increase in analgesic administration, shorter time to analgesics and a higher clinically relevant pain relief. Despite improvements, suffering moderate to severe pain at ED discharge was still common. Protocol adherence needs to be studied in order to optimize pain management.",

Moreover, we recorded drug doses, changes in infusion rates to ensure a desirable degree of sedation and adverse side effects. The maternal recall of delivery and satisfaction with sedation were also evaluated.",

The deepest degree of sedation was found in 2 PROP patients and 1 MID patient. In the PROP group, excessive sedation was rapidly alleviated by reducing the infusion rate. In the MID group, excessive sedation was observed throughout the examination, despite reduced infusion rates. No significant intergroup differences were found for desired sedation levels. The mean heart rate and arterial pressure were lower in the PROP group. In the MID group, only 5% of patients developed an elevated systolic RR. No ECG alterations were observed in any patient. A haemoglobin oxygen saturation level below 92% was found in 1 patient from each group. Logorrhoea was characteristic in the PROP group (44.4%). The incidence of nausea and vomiting were higher in the MID group. Other side effects (e.g., headache, backache, erythema and chills) were observed in a subset of patients from both groups.

Ten patients underwent comprehensive presurgical evaluation, including PET studies, to assess the epileptic foci. The extent of cortical resection was based on the results of intracranial video-electroencephalography (IVEEG) monitoring and brain mapping under stimulation. The images of 10 patients and 30 controls were spatially normalized to templates generated in-house by non-rigid registration and the standardized images of the patients and controls were statistically compared. Epileptic focus candidates were visualized on a color map of axial images of each template and the focus site was identified in candidates for lobar location. In patients with Engel I postoperative seizure outcomes we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the imaging methods for lobar focus localization. We also compared the concordance scores of patients with Engel I and Engel II-IV postoperative seizures. The sensitivity and specificity for lobar focus localization on 18F-FDG PET scans was 90.0% and 84.8%, respectively; it was 30.0% and 81.4% for 11C-FMZ PET, 40.0% and 66.7% for 11C-FMZ BP images, and 100.0% and 51.4% for 18F-FDG PET/11C-FMZ PET/11C-FMZ BP images. In one patient the epileptic focus not detected on 18F-FDG PET scans was shown on 11C-FMZ BP images. In patients with Engel I post-treatment seizures the concordance scores were significantly higher for 18F-FDG PET than 11C-FMZ PET and 11C-FMZ BP images (p < 0.05). With respect to sensitivity and specificity, 18F-FDG PET was superior to 11C-FMZ PET and 11C-FMZ BP imaging.

    "30": "The metabolic pathways for the production of lincomycin, hormaomycin and the antitumor pyrrolo [1,4] benzodiazepines share a vinyl substituted pyrroline carboxylic acid (3-vinyl-2,3-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid, VPCA) as a common intermediate. Biosynthesis of this vinyl substituted pyrroline carboxylic acid intermediate requires a short, three-enzyme pathway containing two metalloenzymes: a heme-dependent l-tyrosine hydroxylase and a non-heme Fe(2+) dependent l-DOPA dioxygenase. The l-tyrosine hydroxylase is an unprecedented type of peroxidase that specifically monohydroxylates tyrosine, while the l-DOPA extradiol cleaving enzyme is a single-domain vicinal-oxygen-chelate (VOC) dioxygenase. The dioxygenase product subsequently undergoes an, as yet uncharacterized, C-C bond cleavage reaction. This mini-pathway demonstrates the use of metal-dependent chemistry typically associated with natural product degradation in order to build a compact, functionalized building block for larger, bioactive molecules.",

In this study, we developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model using SimCYP to predict the impact of elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels on cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and the treatment effect of an anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody, sirukumab, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A virtual RA patient population was first constructed by incorporating the impact of systemic IL-6 level on hepatic and intestinal expression of multiple CYP enzymes with information from in vitro studies. Then, a PBPK model for CYP enzyme substrates was developed for healthy adult subjects. After incorporating the virtual RA patient population, the PBPK model was applied to quantitatively predict pharmacokinetics of multiple CYP substrates in RA patients before and after sirukumab treatment from a clinical cocktail drug interaction study. The results suggested that, compared with observed clinical data, changes in systemic exposure to multiple CYP substrates by anti-IL-6 treatment in virtual RA patients have been reasonably captured by the PBPK model, as manifested by modulations in area under plasma concentration versus time curves for midazolam, omeprazole, S-warfarin, and caffeine. This PBPK model reasonably captured the modulation effect of IL-6 and sirukumab on activity of CYP3A, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2 and holds the potential to be utilized to assess the modulation effect of sirukumab on the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of concomitant small-molecule drugs in RA patients.",

Co-amorphization of OL carboxylic acid dispersions at various molar ratios was carried out using rapid solvent evaporation. Characterization of the dispersions was performed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Dispersions with highest equilibrium solubility were formulated as fast dissolving oral films. Modeling and optimization of film formation were undertaken using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The results indicated co-amorphization of OL-ascorbic acid through H-bonding. The co-amorphous dispersions at 1:2 molar ratio showed more than 600-fold increase in solubility of OL. The model optimized fast dissolving film prepared from the dispersion was physically and chemically stable, demonstrated short disintegration time (8.5\u2009s), fast dissolution (97% in 10\u2009min) and optimum tensile strength (4.9 N/cm(2)). The results of in vivo data indicated high bioavailability (144\u2009ng h/mL) and maximum plasma concentration (14.2\u2009ng/mL) compared with the marketed references.

Pretreatment with diazepam (1 mg kg(-1) intraperitoneal (i.p.)) 30 min before testing produced an anxiolytic effect (significant increase in percentage of time in the open arms compared to control group in the same cycle phase) in animals in proestrus, estrus, and early diestrus but had no effect in rats in late diestrus. Locomotor activity (total arm entries) was unchanged at any cycle phase. When rats in the late diestrus phase were pretreated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (1.75 mg kg(-1) i.p. on the afternoon of early diestrus and again in the morning of late diestrus) diazepam produced an anxiolytic effect (increase percentage time in the open arms). This dose is sufficient to raise brain allopregnanolone concentration without affecting 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) systems. We propose that insensitivity to diazepam in late diestrus is due to increased expression of benzodiazepine insensitive \u03b14 subunit-containing gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptors triggered by a sharp decrease in brain allopregnanolone concentration. Pretreatment with fluoxetine to raise brain allopregnanolone concentration during late diestrus prevents the withdrawal effect.",

The objective of this study was to use in vitro methods combined with static and dynamic physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models to predict metabolite exposures, using midazolam and its major metabolites as a test system. Intrinsic clearances (CLint) of formation of individual metabolites were determined using human liver microsomes. Metabolic CLintof hydroxymidazolam metabolites via oxidation and glucuronidation were also determined. Passive diffusion intrinsic clearances of hydroxymidazolam metabolites were determined using sandwich cultured human hepatocytes and the combination of this term along with the metabolic CLint, and liver blood flow was used to estimate the fraction of the metabolite that can enter the systemic circulation after formation in the liver. The metabolite/parent drug area under the plasma concentration-time curve ratio (AUCm/AUCp) was predicted using a static model relating the fraction of midazolam clearance to each metabolite, the clearance rates of midazolam and hydroxymidazolam metabolites, and the availability of the metabolites. Additionally, the human disposition of midazolam metabolites was simulated using a SimCYP PBPK model. Both approaches yielded AUCm/AUCpratios that were in agreement with the in vivo ratios. This study shows that in vivo midazolam metabolite exposure can be predicted from in vitro data and PBPK modeling. This study emphasized the importance of metabolite systemic availability from its tissue of formation, which remains a challenge to quantitative prediction.",

Post-ECT agitation occurs in up to 12% of ECT treatments and is characterized by motor restlessness, irritability, disorientation, and panic-like behaviors. The severity of post-ECT agitation ranges from mild and self-limited to serious and severe forms requiring prompt medical intervention to protect the patient and the medical staff. In severe agitation medical management may be necessary which consists of using sedative agents, either benzodiazepines or propofol. The side-effects of these sedative agents, especially in the elderly population, necessitate finding ways that could help the prevention of the occurrence of agitation after ECT treatments. We report a 68-year-old female with major depression who was referred for ECT. She experienced severe post-ECT agitation requiring medical intervention after all ECT treatments.

However, the evidence for management of PSH is almost entirely anecdotal in nature. We reviewed case reports or series of pharmacotherapy management of PSH. These studies mentioned treatment options, but few studies exist to guide treatment strategies. For many years, the syndrome was not clearly understood; therefore, the therapy has focused on control of symptoms. In 2014, a Steering Committee came together to develop a conceptual definition and produced a consensus set of diagnostic criteria. Although understanding the diagnostic criteria is very well needed in management of patients with PSH, pharmacologic management is also crucial. Data describing the drug choices, dosing, and duration of therapy are also sparse. Recognition of appropriate medications is important because PSH is associated with morbidity, longer hospitalization, delaying transfer to rehabilitation units, and increasing cost. In this review article, we discussed the common medications used in the treatment of PSH. Treatment should target symptom abortion, prevention of symptoms, and refractory treatment. Symptom-abortive medications are indicated to control discrete breakthrough episodes, using medications such as morphine and short-acting benzodiazepines. Other medications used for prevention of symptoms and refractory treatment include long-acting benzodiazepines, nonselective \u03b2-blockers, \u03b12 agonists, opioids, and GABA agonists. The mechanisms by which these agents improve symptoms of PSH remain speculative. However, a combination of medications from different classes seems the most effective approach in managing PSH symptoms. There is wide variability in clinical practice with regard to drug choices, dosing, and duration of therapy. Future research needs to be conducted using the new PSH assessment measure to appropriately apply drug management.",

We report a case of paranoid schizophrenia who had such perceptual changes akin to PPA for 15 years, which was not related to antipsychotic treatment. There was a rapid resolution of PPA after treatment with low-dose clonazepam.", 
    "59": "For alcohol withdrawal during hospitalization, often a medication as means for withdrawal needs to be chosen. Modern, score-controlled processes that can be used by the nursing staff after instruction by physicians are frequently not used and even unknown in hospitals. One reason for this is that some of the scores require checking several criteria and are therefore more time-consuming and complicated than use of a fixed-dosage strategy. The SAB-P and HAES are short with only 6 items that can be checked by the nursing staff.", 
    "60": "Safety of the Hamburg Alcohol Withdrawal Scale (Hamburger Alkoholentzugs-Skala (HAES)) was analyzed retrospectively and prospectively with regard to score-controlled alcohol-withdrawal treatment after rating by the nurse staff (Scoregesteuerte Alkoholentzugsbehandlung nach Rating durch das Pflegepersonal (SAB-P)).", 
    "61": "Incidence of complications in patients treated with SAB-P and HAES was nearly similar with 1% start of delirium and 3% seizures (SAB-P) and 0.5 to 1.5% start of delirium and 0 to 0.5% seizures in the HAES group.\u200aWith both scales it was possible to start medical treatment while still under falling alcohol levels (0.93 and 0.91%, respectively). Medication dosage was initially higher using the HAES, so that the time needed to monitor withdrawal symptoms could be reduced (3.8 vs. 3.1 days).", 
    "62": "Using a score-controlled strategy for alcohol withdrawal leads to a lower complication rate than found in literature. The structured procedure was helpful for the nursing staff as well as for the physicians. SAB-P as well as HAES made withdrawal for the patients more comfortable and led to fewer complaints. Because of rapid reaction and faster symptom reduction of HAES, there was less time necessary for monitoring. Simple handling, clomethiazol, oxazepam or diazepam as applicable medication and clear documentation are the advantages of HAES.", 
    "63": "Pain and anxiety are commonly experienced by cancer patients and both significantly impair their quality of life. Some authors claim that there is a relationship between pain and anxiety, while others suggest that there is not a direct association. In any case, there is indeed a consensus that anxiety impairs the pain condition beyond be under diagnosed and undertreated in cancer pain patients. Herein we investigated if rats presenting heat hyperalgesia induced by orofacial cancer cell inoculation would display anxiety-like behaviors. In addition, we evaluated if pain blockade would result in alleviation of anxiety behaviors, as well as, if blockade of anxiety would result in pain relief. Orofacial cancer was induced in male Wistar rats by inoculation of Walker-256 cells into the right vibrissal pad. Heat facial hyperalgesia was assessed on day 6 after the inoculation, and on this time point rats were submitted to the elevated plus maze and the light-dark transition tests. The influence of lidocaine and midazolam on heat hyperalgesia and anxiety-like behaviors was assessed. The peak of facial heat hyperalgesia was detected 6 days after cancer cells inoculation, and at this time point, rats exhibited increased anxiety-like behaviors. Local treatment with lidocaine (2%/50\u03bcL) caused a marked reduction of heat hyperalgesia, but failed to affect the anxiety-like behaviors, while midazolam (0.5mg/kg, i.p.) treatment failed to change the heat threshold, but induced an anxiolytic-like effect. Altogether, our data demonstrated that rats with orofacial cancer present pain- and anxiety-like behaviors, but brief heat hyperalgesia relief does not affect the anxiety-like behaviors, and vice-versa, in our experimental conditions.", 
    "64": "Chronic stress which can cause a variety of disorders and illness ranging from metabolic and cardiovascular to mental leads to alterations in content, structure and dynamics of biomolecules in brain. The determination of stress-induced changes along with the effects of antidepressant treatment on these parameters might bring about more effective therapeutic strategies. In the present study, we investigated unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS)-induced changes in biomolecules in mouse brain and the restoring effects of tianeptine (TIA), olanzapine (OLZ) and fluoxetine (FLX) on these variations, by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The results revealed that chronic stress causes different membrane packing and an increase in lipid peroxidation, membrane fluidity. A significant increment for lipid/protein, C=O/lipid, CH3/lipid, CH2/lipid, PO(-)2/lipid, COO(-)/lipid and RNA/protein ratios but a significant decrease for lipid/protein ratios were also obtained. Additionally, altered protein secondary structure components were estimated, such as increment in random coils and beta structures. The administration of TIA, OLZ and FLX drugs restored these stress-induced variations except for alterations in protein structure and RNA/protein ratio. This may suggest that these drugs have similar restoring effects on the consequences of stress activity in brain, in spite of the differences in their action mechanisms. All findings might have importance in understanding molecular mechanisms underlying chronic stress and contribute to studies aimed for drug development.",

We have previously reported that AC-3933 enhances acetylcholine release in the rat hippocampus and ameliorates scopolamine-induced memory impairment and age-related cognitive decline in both rats and mice. In this study, we further evaluated the procognitive effect of AC-3933 on memory impairment induced by MK-801, an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, in mice. Unlike the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil and the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist FG-7142, oral administration of AC-3933 significantly ameliorated MK-801-induced memory impairment in the Y-maze test and in the object location test. Interestingly, the procognitive effects of AC-3933 on MK-801-induced memory impairment were not affected by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil, although this was not the case for the beneficial effects of AC-3933 on scopolamine-induced memory deficit. Moreover, the onset of AC-3933 ameliorating effect on scopolamine- or MK-801-induced memory impairment was different in the Y-maze test. Taken together, these results indicate that AC-3933 improves memory deficits caused by both cholinergic and glutamatergic hypofunction and suggest that the ameliorating effect of AC-3933 on MK-801-induced memory impairment is mediated by a mechanism other than inverse activation of the benzodiazepine receptor.",

For other drugs such as oxycodone, hydrocodone and doxylamine, a trend suggesting higher concentrations in vitreous humor vs. whole blood was observed; however, this was not significant.

However, there has been no investigation on the influence of i.n. administration on midazolam-induced anterograde amnesia. In addition, although the potential of direct drug delivery from the nose to the central nervous system (CNS) has recently become a topic of great interest, it remains unclear whether this pathway is also involved after i.n. midazolam. In this study, we examined the efficacy and the underlying mechanism of i.n. administration compared with intramuscular (i.m.) administration on midazolam-induced amnesia in rats. Equivalent doses of 0.6\u00a0mg/kg midazolam were administered via either the i.m or the i.n. route. Anterograde amnesia was assessed by a contextual/cued fear conditioning test. Each animal was conditioned 20\u00a0min after drug administration and then tested for a freezing response 24\u00a0h later. Midazolam administration by either route produced a similar level of light sedation (minimum spontaneous activity). However, i.n. administration of midazolam induced significantly less freezing behavior compared with i.m. midazolam. Furthermore, in rats with disrupted electrical input from the olfactory epithelium after an olfactotoxicant 3-methylindole administration, the i.n.-mediated enhanced amnesic effect of midazolam was not observed. Our findings indicate that i.n midazolam could probably generate olfactory signals to the brain via benzodiazepine receptors and, compared with i.m. administration, can produce a more significant amnesic effect without alteration in sedative levels. Further clinical studies are warranted.",

However, few investigations have directly compared their relative and combined benefits, and even fewer have tested the benefits of sequential treatment for those who do not respond to initial insomnia therapy. Moreover, insomnia treatment studies have been limited by small, highly screened study samples, fixed-dose, and fixed-agent pharmacotherapy strategies that do not represent usual clinical practices. This study will address these limitations.",

Prospective participants will complete clinical assessments and polysomnography and then will be randomly assigned to first-stage therapy involving either behavioral therapy (BT) or zolpidem. Treatment outcomes will be assessed after 6 weeks, and treatment remitters will be followed for the next 12 months on maintenance therapy. Those not achieving remission will be offered randomization to a second, 6-week treatment, again involving either pharmacotherapy (zolpidem or trazodone) or psychological therapy (BT or cognitive therapy (CT)). All participants will be re-evaluated 12 weeks after the protocol initiation and at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-ups. Insomnia remission, defined categorically as a score < 8 on the Insomnia Severity Index, a patient-reported outcome, will serve as the primary endpoint for treatment comparisons. Secondary outcomes will include sleep parameters derived from daily sleep diaries and from polysomnography, subjective measures of fatigue, mood, quality of life, and functional impairments; and measures of adverse events; dropout rates; and treatment acceptability. Centrally trained therapists will administer therapies according to manualized, albeit flexible, treatment algorithms.",

In most of these cases bed partners were essential to convince patients to seek medical help. In 11% IRBD was elicited only after specific questioning when patients consulted for other reasons. Seven percent did not recall unpleasant dreams. Leaving the bed occurred occasionally in 24% of subjects in whom dementia with Lewy bodies often developed eventually. For the correct diagnosis of IRBD, video-polysomnography had to be repeated in 16% because of insufficient REM sleep or electromyographic artifacts from coexistent apneas. Some subjects with comorbid obstructive sleep apnea reported partial improvement of RBD symptoms following continuous positive airway pressure therapy. Lack of therapy with clonazepam resulted in an increased risk of sleep related injuries.

To understand this relationship, we conducted a retrospective review using medical charts at the Department of Neuropsychiatry, Kurume University Hospital. Information from 55 patients with PTSD was analyzed. Five cases were excluded after re-evaluation of the PTSD diagnosis. A higher rate of type II trauma was observed in the PTSD with MDD group (50.0%) than in the PTSD-only group [13.6%; \u03c7(2) (1, n =50) = 7.26, p<0.01].

We hypothesized that pharmacological GABAergic modulation attenuates BOLD responses, and that blood concentrations of a positive allosteric modulator of GABA correlate inversely with BOLD responses in the cingulate cortex. We investigated whether or not pure task-related negative BOLD responses were co-localized with pharmacologically modulated BOLD responses. Twenty healthy adults received either 5 mg diazepam or placebo in a double blind, randomized design. During fMRI the subjects performed a working memory task. Results showed that BOLD responses in the cingulate cortex were inversely correlated with diazepam blood concentrations; that is, the higher the blood diazepam concentration, the lower the BOLD response. This inverse correlation was most pronounced in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and the anterior mid-cingulate cortex. For subjects with diazepam plasma concentration > 0.1 mg/L we observed negative BOLD responses with respect to fixation baseline. There was minor overlap between cingulate regions with task-related negative BOLD responses and regions where the BOLD responses were inversely correlated with diazepam concentration. We interpret that the inverse correlation between the BOLD response and diazepam was caused by GABA-related neural inhibition. Thus, this study supports the hypothesis that GABA attenuates BOLD responses in fMRI. The minimal overlap between task-related negative BOLD responses and responses attenuated by diazepam suggests that these responses might be caused by different mechanisms.",

Several rat and mouse models of epilepsy with spontaneous difficult-to-treat seizures exist, but because testing of antiseizure drug efficacy is extremely laborious in such models, they are only rarely used in the development of novel AEDs. Recently, the use of acute seizure tests in epileptic rats or mice has been proposed as a novel strategy for evaluating novel AEDs for increased antiseizure efficacy. In the present study, we compared the effects of five AEDs (valproate, phenobarbital, diazepam, lamotrigine, levetiracetam) on the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) seizure threshold in mice that were made epileptic by pilocarpine. Experiments were started 6 weeks after a pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. At this time, control seizure threshold was significantly lower in epileptic than in nonepileptic animals. Unexpectedly, only one AED (valproate) was less effective to increase seizure threshold in epileptic vs. nonepileptic mice, and this difference was restricted to doses of 200 and 300 mg/kg, whereas the difference disappeared at 400mg/kg. All other AEDs exerted similar seizure threshold increases in epileptic and nonepileptic mice. Thus, induction of acute seizures with PTZ in mice pretreated with pilocarpine does not provide an effective and valuable surrogate method to screen drugs for antiseizure efficacy in a model of difficult-to-treat chronic epilepsy as previously suggested from experiments with this approach in rats.",

It has been described by the International Headache Society as \"an intra-oral burning or dysesthetic sensation, recurring daily for more than 2 h/day for more than 3 months, without clinically evident causative lesions.\" BMS is frequently seen in women in the peri-menopausal and menopausal age group in an average female/male ratio of 7:1. The site most commonly affected is the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The patient may also report taste alterations and oral dryness along with the burning. The etiopathogenesis is complex and is not well-comprehended. The more accepted theories point toward a neuropathic etiology, but the gustatory system has also been implicated in this condition. BMS is frequently mismanaged, partly because it is not well-known among healthcare providers. Diagnosis of BMS is made after other local and systemic causes of burning have been ruled out as then; the oral burning is the disease itself. The management of BMS still remains a challenge. Benzodiazepines have been used in clinical practice as the first-line medication in the pharmacological management of BMS. Nonpharmacological management includes cognitive behavioral therapy and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). The aim of this review is to familiarize healthcare providers with the diagnosis, pathogenesis, and general characteristics of primary BMS while updating them with the current treatment options to better manage this group of patients.",

We discuss a 70-year-old man with a 45-year history of meprobamate dependency and multiple failed previous withdrawal attempts who was successfully withdrawn from meprobamate using diazepam during a 2-week inpatient stay on a specialist Addictions ward. An appropriate diazepam dose was established using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment scale for benzodiazepines (CIWA-B). This dose was then slowly reduced over 12\u2005days.

    "154": "Interneurons are inhibitory neurons, which protect neural tissue from excessive excitation. They are interconnected with glutamatergic pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex and regulate their function. Particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), interneurons have been strongly implicated in regulating pathological states which display deficits in the PFC. The aim of this study is to investigate the adaptations in the adult glutamatergic system, when defects in interneuron development do not allow adequate numbers of interneurons to reach the cerebral cortex. To this end, we used a mouse model that displays ~50% fewer cortical interneurons due to the Rac1 protein loss from Nkx2.1/Cre expressing cells (Rac1 conditional knockout (cKO) mice), to examine how the developmental loss of interneurons may affect basal synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity and neuronal morphology in the adult PFC. Despite the decrease in the number of interneurons, basal synaptic transmission, as examined by recording field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) from layer II networks, is not altered in the PFC of Rac1 cKO mice. However, there is decreased paired-pulse ratio (PPR) and decreased long-term potentiation (LTP), in response to tetanic stimulation, in the layer II PFC synapses of Rac1 cKO mice. Furthermore, expression of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) subunits is decreased and dendritic morphology is altered, changes that could underlie the decrease in LTP in the Rac1 cKO mice. Finally, we find that treating Rac1 cKO mice with diazepam in early postnatal life can reverse changes in dendritic morphology observed in non-treated Rac1 cKO mice. Therefore, our data show that disruption in GABAergic inhibition alters glutamatergic function in the adult PFC, an effect that could be reversed by enhancement of GABAergic function during an early postnatal period.",

Dexmedetomidine and fospropofol were recently introduced, along with a computer-assisted personalized sedation delivery system which empowers the patient to assist in his own sedation. The evolution of target-controlled infusion systems with both open and closed-loop design are intended to more precisely deliver sedation using pharmacokinetic models specific for each sedative.

Three to nine variable QSAR models based on Multiple Linear Regression are built for each chemical dataset according to the original division into training/test sets. Comparisons with respect to leave-one-out cross-validation correlation coefficients[Formula: see text] reveal that the models based on QuBiLS-MIDAS indices possess superior predictive ability in 7 of the 8 datasets analyzed, outperforming methodologies based on similar or more complex techniques such as: Partial Least Square, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine and others. On the other hand, superior external correlation coefficients[Formula: see text] are attained in 6 of the 8 test sets considered, confirming the good predictive power of the obtained models. For the [Formula: see text] values non-parametric statistic tests were performed, which demonstrated that the models based on QuBiLS-MIDAS indices have the best global performance and yield significantly better predictions in 11 of the 12 QSAR procedures used in the comparison. Lastly, a study concerning to the performance of the indices according to several conformer generation methods was performed.

These data suggest that there is a similar basis of their mechanism of action. To test this hypothesis we studied the effect of Selank and GABA on the expression of genes involved in neurotransmission. We analyzed the expression of 84 genes involved in neurotransmission (e.g., major subunit of the GABA receptor, transporters, ion channels, dopamine, and serotonin receptors) in the frontal cortex of rats 1 and 3 h after the administration of Selank or GABA (300 \u03bcg/kg) using real-time PCR method. We found significant changes in the expression of 45 genes 1 h after the administration of the compounds. Three hours after Selank or GABA administration, 22 genes changed their expression. We found positive correlation between the changes in genes expression within 1 h after administration of Selank or GABA. Our results showed that Selank caused a number of alterations in the expression of genes involved in neurotransmission. The data obtained indicate that Selank is characterized by its complex effects on nerve cells, and one of its possible molecular mechanisms is associated with allosteric modulation of the GABAergic system.",

Tests for blood glucose and lipids were conducted at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment with olanzapine. UPLC-MS based metabonomic analysis was performed on both case and control groups to identify biomarkers of schizophrenia at baseline and to explore which biomarkers correlated with the therapeutic effect of olanzapine after a 4-week treatment. Compared with the control group, the case group showed significant changes in plasma metabolites. Thirteen distinct metabolites were identified. Among all the therapeutically effective cases, levels of these metabolites appeared to shift towards the normal trend; 8 of the identified 13 metabolites changed dramatically.

    "170": "Benzodiazepines are commonly prescribed as anxiolytics, sedatives, and anticonvulsants. They act on the GABAA receptor by increasing the conductance chloride through ionic channels, promoting a state of central nervous system depression. The clinical properties of benzodiazepines are dependent upon the composition of the different subunits of the GABAA receptor. Each subunit, in turn, has multiple subtypes that are present throughout the central nervous system, all of which impart different clinical responses. Benzodiazepines are the first-line treatment of status epilepticus. Time to treatment is crucial, and clinical response to benzodiazepines is lost with prolonged status epilepticus. Non-intravenous routes of midazolam should be considered as an equally efficacious alternative to intravenous lorazepam, which is the most commonly administered benzodiazepine for status epilepticus when intravenous access is available. Outpatient therapy with benzodiazepines for the acute treatment of seizures is currently limited to rectal diazepam, but alternative routes of administration are under development. Clobazam and clonazepam are good options for seizure prophylaxis in patients with epilepsy refractory to multiple antiepileptic drugs. Clobazam is preferred due to its affinity for the \u03b12 subunit of the GABAA receptor, which leads to less potential for sedation.

Ninety participants were studied divided into three groups: a group of patients with CPI only (n = 30), a group of patients with CPI-CNZ treated (n = 30) and a healthy control drug-free subjects group (n = 30). EF were examined by means of E-Prime and by the Tower of London tests. Data of the EF were compared between groups, and correlation calculations between EF and CNZ dose were performed. Patients with CPI-CNZ treated showed more deleterious effects on EF (attention, inhibition, working memory, planning, cognitive flexibility, and monitoring) than patients with CPI only. Attention and cognitive flexibility correlated with CNZ dose. In conclusion, CNZ treatment was associated with deficits in some EF in patients with CPI-CNZ treated compared to CPI only and controls. We found a dose dependency between CNZ and some EF deficits.",

As per the third International Classification of Sleep disorders (ICSD-3) insomnia can be defined as a state with repeated difficulty in sleep initiation, duration, consolidation, or quality that occurs despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep, and results in some form of daytime impairment. The conventional treatments approved for management of insomnia were benzodiazepines (BZDs) (estazolam, quazepam, triazolam, flurazepam and temazepam) and non-BZDs, also known as z-drugs (zaleplon, zolpidem, and eszopiclone), tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) doxepin as well as melatonin agonists, e.g. ramelteon. But the potential of these agents to address sleep problems has been limited due to substantial side effects associated with them like hangover, dependence and tolerance, rebound insomnia, muscular atonia, inhibition of respiratory system, cognitive dysfunctions, and increased anxiety. Recently, orexin neuropeptides have been identified as regulators of transition between wakefulness and sleep and documented to aid an initial transitory effect towards wakefulness by activating cholinergic/monoaminergic neural pathways of the ascending arousal system. This has led to the development of orexin peptides and receptors, as possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of sleep disorders with the advantage of having lesser side effects as compared to conventional treatments. The present review focuses on the orexin peptides and receptors signifying their physiological profile as well as the development of orexin receptor antagonists as novel strategies in sleep medicine.",

Secondarily, we resume the main differential diagnoses to exclude when confronted with this kind of movement disorders. Differential diagnoses for dyskinesia can be classified between primary (Parkinson and Huntington diseases) and secondary (Wilson disease, intoxication, metabolic abnormality, cerebrovascular accident) abnormal movements. Psychogenic TD can be evocated if previous pathologies are excluded in case of atypical clinical presentation. We detail the risk factors for TD. Endogenous risk factors are related to the patient's age, underlying psychiatric disease (bipolar disorder or Alzheimer dementia), addiction to alcohol or cocaine, female gender, or neurodevelopmental vulnerability. Iatrogenic risk factors are high doses of antipsychotics, long or intermittent administration, and particular pharmaceutical classes or associations of antipsychotics. As a comprehensive tool, we review the main physiopathological hypotheses to explain the occurrence of TD in some patients: hypersensitivity of D2 neuronal receptor or neurotoxicity associated with oxidative stress mechanisms. We also summarize the current guidelines for prevention and treatment of TD. Three successive curative strategies are suggested in the literature. First, the clinician can adapt the current antipsychotic treatment (switch to a new generation antipsychotic, diminution or cessation of antipsychotic drugs). If this first intervention is not pertinent or ineffective, the clinician can prescribe an antikinetic therapeutic agent, such as tetrabenazine, or an antioxidant. Review of the published studies does not show proof of efficacy of cholinergic or anticholinergic drugs, benzodiazepine or other GABAergic drugs, nor for amantadine. Non-medication therapeutics such as ECT and TMS are discussed, but the level of proof is insufficient to promote them as a curative treatment for TD. In case of high resistance and discomfort for the patient, a neurosurgical intervention should be discussed. These curative interventions are limited, emphasising the importance of TD prevention, by limiting the prescription and doses of antipsychotics, regularly evaluating their side effects and informing the patient of TD's risk.",

We aimed to comprehensively map the patterns of prescription of psychotropic drugs for OCD patients (adults and children) at the Swedish national level and to compare these prescription patterns to best-practice recommendations in international guidelines. We linked the Swedish National Patient Register and the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register, which includes a record for all medications prescribed and dispensed in Sweden since July 2005. Of all active OCD cases in the Swedish National Patient Register between July 1st, 2005, and December 31st 2008 (N=10,523), 85% received at least one psychotropic drug. Most of the medicated adults and children with OCD (88%) received serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs). Of all adults and children prescribed SRIs, 16% received sub-optimal doses. An additional 12% of all medicated patients were prescribed drugs that never included an SRI. Approximately 75% of the patients on SRIs received additional drugs (67% anxiolytics/hypnotics, 27% antipsychotics, 17% serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, 24% other antidepressants). Twelve percent of all medicated patients were at least 'regular' users, and 3% 'heavy' users of benzodiazepines. We also observed important variations in prescription practices according to patient's gender, age, and comorbidity status. We conclude that a substantial number of OCD patients might benefit from changes in their prescriptions. Dissemination of best-practice prescription guidelines for OCD is a major educational goal for the future. Monitoring of these prescription patterns over time is warranted.", 
    "205": "Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are highly effective to suppress various types of seizures; however, their clinical use is limited due to adverse effects and tolerance and dependence liability. Drugs that act only as partial agonists at the BZD recognition site (initially termed \"BZD receptor\") of the GABAA receptor chloride ionophore complex or exhibit a GABAA receptor subtype-selectivity are thought to have advantages vs. full agonists such as diazepam and most other clinically used BZDs in that such compounds have less adverse effects and reduced or absent tolerance and dependence liability. One of such compounds, abecarnil, has been clinically evaluated as a novel anxiolytic drug, but, despite its potent preclinical anti-seizure activity, it has not yet been evaluated in patients with epilepsy. In the present proof-of-concept study, we performed a within-subject placebo-controlled, single oral dose study of abecarnil in patients with photosensitive epilepsy. Flumazenil, which is generally considered a BZD receptor antagonist, but has slight partial agonistic properties, was used for comparison. In total, 12 patients were enrolled in this study. Abecarnil, 5 or 10mg, completely abolished the photo-paroxysmal EEG response, while flumazenil, 30, 60 or 100mg, was less effective. The anti-epileptic effect of abecarnil was significantly different from both placebo and flumazenil. Sedative adverse effects were observed after abecarnil but not flumazenil. The study substantiates previous pre-clinical experiments that abecarnil exerts pronounced anti-seizure activity. Epilepsy is often associated with anxiety, so that the anxiolytic activity of abecarnil would be an added advantage when using this compound in epilepsy patients.",

In this paper, a facile two-step method of inserting fluorine into metabolically labile sites of drug molecules is described that utilizes less than 1 mg of starting material and quantitative NMR spectroscopy to ascertain the structures and concentrations of products. In the first step, hydroxyl metabolites are biosynthesized using human P450 enzymes, and in the second step these metabolites are subjected to deoxyfluorination using diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST). The method is demonstrated using midazolam, celecoxib, ramelteon, and risperidone as examples and CYP3A5, 2C9, 1A2, and 2D6 to catalyze the hydroxylations. The drugs and their fluoro analogs were tested for metabolic lability. 9-Fluororisperidone and 4'-fluorocelecoxib were 16 and 4 times more metabolically stable than risperidone and celecoxib, respectively, and 2-fluororamelteon and ramelteon were metabolized at the same rate. 1'-Fluoromidazolam was metabolized at the same rate as midazolam by CYP3A4 but was more stable in CYP3A5 incubations. The P450-catalyzed sites of metabolism of the fluorine-containing analogs were determined. Some of the metabolites arose via metabolism at the fluorine-substituted carbon, wherein the fluorine was lost to yield aldehydes. In summary, this method offers an approach whereby fluorine can be substituted in metabolically labile sites, and the products can be tested to determine whether an enhancement in metabolic stability was obtained.",

    "216": "Convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) is a medical emergency with an associated high mortality and morbidity. It is defined as a convulsive seizure lasting more than 5\u00a0min or consecutive seizures without recovery of consciousness. Successful management of CSE depends on rapid administration of adequate doses of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). The exact choice of AED is less important than rapid treatment and early consideration of reversible etiologies. Current guidelines recommend the use of benzodiazepines (BNZ) as first-line treatment in CSE. Midazolam is effective and safe in the pre-hospital or home setting when administered intramuscularly (best evidence), buccally, or nasally (the latter two possibly faster acting than intramuscular (IM) but with lower levels of evidence). Regular use of home rescue medications such as nasal/buccal midazolam by patients and caregivers for prolonged seizures and seizure clusters may prevent SE, prevent emergency room visits, improve quality of life, and lower health care costs. Traditionally, phenytoin is the preferred second-line agent in treating CSE, but it is limited by hypotension, potential arrhythmias, allergies, drug interactions, and problems from extravasation. Intravenous valproate is an effective and safe alternative to phenytoin. Valproate is loaded intravenously rapidly and more safely than phenytoin, has broad-spectrum efficacy, and fewer acute side effects. Levetiracetam and lacosamide are well tolerated intravenous (IV) AEDs with fewer interactions, allergies, and contraindications, making them potentially attractive as second- or third-line agents in treating CSE. However, data are limited on their efficacy in CSE. Ketamine is probably effective in treating refractory CSE (RCSE), and may warrant earlier use; this requires further study. CSE should be treated aggressively and quickly, with confirmation of treatment success with epileptiform electroencephalographic (EEG), as a transition to non-convulsive status epilepticus is common. If the patient is not fully awake, EEG should be continued for at least 24\u00a0h. How aggressively to treat refractory non-convulsive SE (NCSE) or intermittent non-convulsive seizures is less clear and requires additional study. Refractory SE (RSE) usually requires anesthetic doses of anti-seizure medications. If an auto-immune or paraneoplastic etiology is suspected or no etiology can be identified (as with cryptogenic new onset refractory status epilepticus, known as NORSE), early treatment with immuno-modulatory agents is now recommended by many experts.",

No adverse events were reported for use of combined \u03b2/\u03b1-blockers such as labetalol and carvedilol, which were effective in attenuating both hypertension and tachycardia. Antipsychotics: Seven Level I/II studies, three Level III studies, and seven Level IV/V case series and reports involving 168 subjects have been published. Antipsychotics may improve agitation and psychosis, but with inconsistent reduction in tachycardia and hypertension and risk of extrapyramidal adverse effects. Other agents: There was only one high level study of morphine, which reversed cocaine-induced coronary vasoconstriction but increased heart rate. Other agents reviewed included lidocaine, sodium bicarbonate, amiodarone, procainamide, propofol, intravenous lipid emulsion, propofol, and ketamine.",

Seven healthy Beagle dogs were included in a prospective experimental, crossover, randomised and masked design. All dogs received four treatments IM, with at least 1 week between sessions, as follows: dexmedetomidine 5\u2009\u00b5g/kg (D) alone, or combined with methadone 0.3\u2009mg/kg (DMe), midazolam 0.3\u2009mg/kg (DMi), or both (DMeMi). The degree of sedation was evaluated using a numerical scale (maximum 15 points). The dose of propofol required for intubation was also calculated for each group. Recovery time and quality were determined. Statistical analysis was performed using parametric (ANOVA) and nonparametric tests (Friedman, Cochran Q), as appropriate. The degree of sedation obtained with DMe and DMeMi (13, [7-14]; 13, [6-14], respectively) was significantly higher than in the control group (2, [1-4]; P\u2009=\u20090.023, P\u2009=\u20090.006, respectively). The required dose of propofol was lower in all groups (DMi, 1.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u2009mg/kg, P\u2009=\u20090.002; DMe, 1.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u2009mg/kg, P\u2009<0.001; DMeMi, 0.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u2009mg/kg) than in the control group (2.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9\u2009mg/kg; P\u2009<0.001). Recovery quality was not different between groups (P\u2009=\u20090.137). In healthy dogs, the addition of midazolam did not enhance the sedative effects of dexmedetomidine or a dexmedetomidine-methadone combination at the doses studied, and propofol requirements were reduced. The sedative effect of dexmedetomidine was enhanced with methadone, and the required dose of propofol was reduced.",

We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of midazolam versus thiopental for treatment of RSE. Retrospective case-control series of prospectively identified patients treated with midazolam or thiopental for RSE between January 2007 and December 2014. The primary outcome was control of RSE. Secondary outcomes included the rate of adverse events, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay, hospital mortality and long-term neurological outcome, assessed with the extended Glasgow outcome scale (GOS-E) at discharge and at six 6 months. A total of 33 patients were included, 19 treated with midazolam and 14 with thiopental. Groups were similar for demographic data, clinical variables, comorbidity and the underlying cause of RSE. The rate of control of SE did not differ between groups (63 vs. 64 %). Adverse events including hypotension (mean arterial pressure <70 mmHg) requiring vasopressors, infections, anemia requiring red blood cells transfusion, leucopenia (<4000/mm(3)), and hyponatremia (<130 mEq/l) were more frequent during thiopental infusion. Furthermore, patients treated with midazolam had a shorter median ICU length of stay (6 vs. 15 days; p = 0.02) and better GOS-E at 6 months (8 [8] vs. 4 [4, 5]; p = 0.01). These findings suggest that continuous midazolam administration is as efficacious as thiopental infusion for the treatment of RSE; however, midazolam was associated with a significantly lower number of adverse events. These findings should be confirmed in larger multicenter trials.",

    "233": "Pain is an emotion and neuropathic pain symptoms are modulated by supraspinal structures such as the amygdala. The central nucleus of the amygdala is often called the 'nociceptive amygdala', but little is known about the role of the basolateral amygdala. Here, we monitored the mechanical nociceptive thresholds in a mouse model of neuropathic pain and infused modulators of the glutamate/GABAergic transmission in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) via chronically-implanted cannulas. We found that an N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptor antagonist (MK-801) exerted a potent antiallodynic effect, whereas a transient allodynia was induced after perfusion of bicuculline, a GABA(A) receptor antagonist. Potentiating GABA(A) receptor function using diazepam or etifoxine (a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic) fully but transiently alleviated mechanical allodynia. Interestingly, the antiallodynic effect of etifoxine disappeared in animals that were incapable of producing 3\u03b1-steroids. Diazepam had a similar effect but of shorter duration. As indicated by patch-clamp recordings of BLA neurons, these effects were mediated by a potentiation of GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. Together with a presynaptic elevation of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current frequency, the duration and amplitude of GABA(A) miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents were also increased (postsynaptic effect). The analgesic contribution of endogenous neurosteroid seemed to be exclusively postsynaptic. This study highlights the importance of the BLA and the local inhibitory/excitatory neuronal network activity while setting the mechanical nociceptive threshold. Furthermore, it appears that promoting inhibition in this specific nucleus could fully alleviate pain symptoms. Therefore, the BLA could be a novel interesting target for the development of pharmacological or non-pharmacological therapies.",

    "243": "Background: Approximately 100 million adults in the United States experience pain that can affect performance of daily tasks, quality of life, and productivity in the workplace. Tramadol is an opioid medication for the management of moderate to moderately severe pain in adults. Prescriptions for this drug increased 88% from 23.3 million in 2008 to 43.8 million in 2013. Methods: Data from the 2005 to 2011 Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) were used to estimate the number of emergency department (ED) visits made for adverse reactions involving tramadol. We examined trends by age and gender, other drugs identified in these ED visits and the number of visits that resulted in admission to the hospital or transfer to another health care facility. Results: Data from 2011 DAWN shows an estimated 54,397 ED visits involving tramadol, 27,421 (50%) of which were attributed to adverse reactions. From 2005 to 2009, the number of estimated ED visits made for adverse reactions involving tramadol increased 145% (10,091 to 25,884 visits), and remained stable in 2010 and 2011 (25,887 and 27,421 visits, respectively). Females accounted for 75% of tramadol-related ED visits (7,604) involving adverse reactions in 2005 and continued to account for the majority of visits through 2011 (19,329). In 2011, although visits made by patients aged 65 or older accounted for 35% of tramadol-related ED visits involving adverse reactions (9,688), they accounted for 52% of the visits that resulted in admissions to the hospital or transferred to another health care facility. Conclusion: When tramadol is combined with other drugs that depress the central nervous system, such as anti-anxiety medications (e.g. benzodiazepines), narcotic pain relievers, or alcohol, the sedative effects of tramadol can be enhanced. This may be especially crucial for older adults, especially females, for whom acute or chronic pain is a common complaint and who often take other prescription medications that may interact with tramadol.",

In traditional medicine, it is used for the relief of anxiety and insomnia. Systemic hydro-alcoholic and aqueous extract from aerial parts and seeds had anxiolytic and sedative action in rodents, but little is known about its central effect in chicks. Objective To study the effects of intracerebroventricular administration of essential oil from coriander seeds and its major component linalool on locomotor activity and emotionality of neonatal chicks. Materials and methods The chemical composition of coriander essential oil was determined by a gas-chromatographic analysis (>\u200980% linalool). Behavioural effects of central administration of coriander oil and linalool (both at doses of 0.86, 8.6 and 86\u2009\u03bcg/chick) versus saline and a sedative diazepam dose (17.5\u2009\u03bcg/chick, standard drug) in an open field test for 10\u2009min were observed. Results Doses of 8.6 and 86\u2009\u03bcg from coriander oil and linalool significantly decreased (p\u2009<\u20090.05) squares crossed number, attempted escapes, defecation number and distress calls, and significantly increased (p\u2009<\u20090.05) the sleeping posture on an open field compared with saline and were similar to the diazepam group. Discussion and conclusion The results indicate that intracerebroventricular injection of essential oil from Coriandrum sativum seeds induced a sedative effect at 8.6 and 86\u2009\u03bcg doses. This effect may be due to monoterpene linalool, which also induced a similar sedative effect, and, therefore, could be considered as a potential therapeutic agent similar to diazepam.", 
    "253": "Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is an extremely aggressive thyroid cancer subtype, refractory to the current medical treatment. Among various epigenetic anticancer drugs, bromodomain and extra-terminal inhibitors (BETis) are considered to be an appealing novel class of compounds. BETi target the bromodomain and extra-terminal of BET proteins that act as regulators of gene transcription, interacting with histone acetyl groups. The goal of this study is to delineate which pathway underlies the biological effects derived from BET inhibition, in order to find new potential therapeutic targets in ATC. We investigated the effects of BET inhibition on two human anaplastic thyroid cancer-derived cell lines (FRO and SW1736). The treatment with two BETis, JQ1 and I-BET762, decreased cell viability, reduced cell cycle S-phase, and determined cell death. In order to find BETi effectors, FRO and SW1736 were subjected to a global transcriptome analysis after JQ1 treatment. A significant portion of deregulated genes belongs to cell cycle regulators. Among them, MCM5 was decreased at both mRNA and protein levels in both tested cell lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments indicate that MCM5 is directly bound by the BET protein BRD4. MCM5 silencing reduced cell proliferation, thus underlining its involvement in the block of proliferation induced by BETis. Furthermore, MCM5 immunohistochemical evaluation in human thyroid tumor tissues demonstrated its overexpression in several papillary thyroid carcinomas and in all ATCs. MCM5 was also overexpressed in a murine model of ATC, and JQ1 treatment reduced Mcm5 mRNA expression in two murine ATC cell lines. Thus, MCM5 could represent a new target in the therapeutic approach against ATC.",

Brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) measurements using (123)I-iomazenil, which binds to GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptors, was performed in 26 participants with AN who were enrolled in a multimodal treatment program. Sixteen of the 26 participants underwent a repeat SPECT scan immediately before discharge at conclusion of the intensive treatment program. Eating behavior and mood disturbances were assessed using Eating Attitudes Test with 26 items (EAT-26) and the short form of the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Clinical outcome scores were evaluated after a 1-year period. We examined association between relative iomazenil-binding activity in cortical regions of interest and psychometric profiles and determined which psychometric profiles show interaction effects with brain regions. Further, we determined if binding activity could predict clinical outcome and treatment changes. Higher EAT-26 scores were significantly associated with lower iomazenil-binding activity in the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex. Higher POMS subscale scores were significantly associated with lower iomazenil-binding activity in the left frontal, parietal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). \"Depression-Dejection\" and \"Confusion\" POMS subscale scores, and total POMS score showed interaction effects with brain regions in iomazenil-binding activity. Decreased binding in the anterior cingulate cortex and left parietal cortex was associated with poor clinical outcomes. Relative binding increases throughout the PCC and occipital gyrus were observed after weight gain in children with AN. These findings suggest that cortical GABAergic receptor binding is altered in children with AN. This may be a state-related change, which could be used to monitor and guide the treatment of eating disorders."
