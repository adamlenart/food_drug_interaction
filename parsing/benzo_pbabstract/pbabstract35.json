Some atypical antipsychotic drugs possibly have anti-inflammatory properties and suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species from microglia. Voltage-gated proton channels (Hv1) are expressed in microglia and are required for NADPH oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species generation, which could contribute to neuronal death and ischemic brain damage. In the present study, we examined the effects of the atypical antipsychotics clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone on proton currents in microglial BV2 cells. Clozapine and olanzapine inhibited proton currents with IC50 values of 9.8 \u03bcM and 84 \u03bcM, respectively. Risperidone, however, showed very weak inhibition of proton currents. Clozapine-induced inhibition of proton currents was not accompanied by a positive shift in the activation voltage or reversal potential, indicating that the inhibition was not mediated through an increase in the intracellular pH. Clozapine binds to a multitude of receptors, including serotonin, dopamine and muscarinic receptors. Serotonin receptors, however, were not responsible for the proton current inhibition by clozapine. Of the three drugs, only clozapine could reach concentrations to inhibit microglial proton currents in the brain at therapeutic doses. Thus, the anti-inflammatory activity of clozapine may be partly attributable to its inhibition of microglial proton currents.", 
    "1": "Excited delirium syndrome (ExDS) is a term used to describe patients experiencing a clinical condition characterized by bizarre and aggressive behavior, often in association with the use of chronic sympathomimetic drug abuse. The agitated and disruptive behavior of persons with ExDS often results in a call to police resulting in an arrest for disorderly conduct. The suspect's inability to comply with police commands during the arrest frequently results in a struggle and the use of physical or chemical control measures, including the use of conductive energy weapons (CEWs). Deaths from this hypermetabolic syndrome are infrequent but potentially preventable with early identification, a coordinated aggressive police intervention, and prompt medical care. Preliminary experiences suggest that ExDS is a medical emergency treated most effectively using a coordinated response between police officers and emergency medical providers. Once the person suspected of experiencing ExDS is in custody, medical providers should rapidly sedate noncompliant patients with medications such as ketamine or an antipsychotic drug such as haloperidol in combination with a benzodiazepine drug such as midazolam or diazepam. Once sedated, patients should undergo a screening medical assessment and undergo initial treatment for conditions such as hyperthermia and dehydration. All patients exhibiting signs of ExDS should be transported rapidly to a medical treatment facility for further evaluation and treatment. This article reviews the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment options for ExDS.",

    "4": "Catamenial epilepsy refers to the cyclic exacerbation of seizures in relation to the menstrual cycle. An interaction between seizures and the menstrual cycle is suggested by variations in seizure frequency according to the day, phase and ovulatory status of the menstrual cycle. There are three commonly recognized patterns: perimenstrual (C1: Day -3 to +3), peri-ovulatory (C2: Day 10 to 3) and entire luteal phase in anovulatory cycles (C3: Day 10 to 3). Pathophysiological determinants include 1) the neuroactive properties of reproductive steroids, 2) the variation of neuroactive steroid levels across the menstrual cycle and 3) the differential susceptibility of epileptic substrates to neuroactive steroid effects. Perimenstrual seizure exacerbation may result from the premenstrual withdrawal of progesterone which is accompanied by withdrawal of allopregnanolone, a potent positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor, and changes in the subunit composition of the GABAA receptor to the \u03b14 subtype which is insensitive to benzodiazepine and GABA. Bioidentical progesterone supplement is no better than placebo in the treatment of women with focal onset epilepsy overall but shows superior efficacy in women whose seizures show robust perimenstrual exacerbation.",

    "19": "A GABA-site agonist gaboxadol (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol) at 3 mg/kg induces strong anxiolytic response in a transgenic Thy1\u03b16 mouse line ectopically expressing the GABA(A) receptor \u03b16 subunit gene under the Thy-1.2 promoter. Now, we compared brain activation patterns between Thy1\u03b16 and wild-type mice to identify brain structures potentially mediating this anxiolytic response. Acutely efficient anxiolytics such as benzodiazepines typically depress most brain regions while activating specifically neurons within the central extended amygdala. Gaboxadol treatment (3 mg/kg, i.p., 2 h) induced a significant increase in c-Fos expression selectively in many Thy1\u03b16 brain regions including the limbic cortex, anterior olfactory nucleus, septal area and central and basolateral nuclei of amygdala. It failed to activate the lateral part of mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MDL) in the Thy1\u03b16 mice that was activated in the wild-type mice. Detailed mapping of the \u03b16 subunit mRNA by in situ hybridization revealed expression in the middle layers of the isocortex, olfactory areas, hippocampal formation and basolateral nucleus of amygdala (BLA) in the Thy1\u03b16 forebrain. The ligand autoradiographies (t-butylbicyclophosphoro[(35)S]thionate ([(35)S]TBPS) and [(3)H]Ro 15-4513) revealed high levels of pharmacologically active extrasynaptic \u03b16\u03b2 and \u03b16\u03b2\u03b32 GABA(A) receptors in these same areas. However, c-Fos induction by gaboxadol treatment in Thy1\u03b16 brain was not restricted to areas highly expressing the \u03b16-containing GABA(A) receptors suggesting that indirect pathways lead to the paradoxically widespread activation. Interestingly, the activation pattern by gaboxadol at the dose that is anxiolytic in Thy1\u03b16 mice resembled closely that observed after various fear- and stress-provoking challenges. However, our results are consistent with a recent observation that optogenetic activation of specific neuronal pathways in the extended amygdala mediates anxiolytic responses. Our results suggest that the widespread neuronal inhibition as typically associated with benzodiazepines is not the exclusive mechanism of anxiolysis.", 
    "20": "Previous epidemiological studies have established insomnia as a major risk factor for mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders. However, the associations between insomnia with sedative-hypnotic prescriptions and various psychiatric disorders have not been thoroughly examined. The current study involved evaluating the risk of psychiatric disorders, namely schizophrenia, mood, anxiety, somatoform, and substance-related disorders, over a 6-y follow-up period in three groups: patients with insomnia and sedative-hypnotic prescriptions (Inso-Hyp), those with insomnia and without sedative-hypnotic prescriptions (Inso-NonHyp), and those with neither insomnia nor sedative-hypnotic prescriptions (NonInso-NonHyp).",

Females required more midazolam than males. However, the analysis of the data as a whole, incorporating both genders, revealed a non-significant correlation result. The correlation between the midazolam dosage and the Corah anxiety score produced a p value result of: r (161) = 0.008, p <0.01. Forty-four percent of the patients described themselves as having 'high anxiety and fear of the dentist', however, 99.4% of the patients answered 'yes' to having sedation again in the future.

To date several psychotropic drugs including benzodiazepines, SSRIs and SNRIs have been evaluated using the 7.5% CO2 model; however, it has yet to be used to evaluate psychological interventions. We compared the effects of two core psychological components of mindfulness-meditation (open monitoring and focused attention) against general relaxation, on subjective, autonomic and neuropsychological outcomes in the 7.5% CO2 experimental model. 32 healthy screened adults were randomized to complete 10\u00a0min of guided open monitoring, focused attention or relaxation, immediately before inhaling 7.5% CO2 for 20\u00a0min. During CO2-challenge participants completed an eye-tracking measure of attention control and selective attention. Measures of subjective anxiety, blood pressure and heart rate were taken at baseline and immediately following intervention and CO2-challenge. OM and FA practice reduced subjective feelings of anxiety during 20-min\u00a0inhalation of 7.5% CO2 compared to relaxation control. OM practice produced a strong anxiolytic effect, whereas the effect of FA was more modest. Anxiolytic OM and FA effects occurred in the absence of group differences in autonomic arousal and eye-movement measures of attention. Our findings are consistent with neuropsychological models of mindfulness-meditation that propose OM and FA activate prefrontal mechanisms that support emotion regulation during periods of anxiety and physiological hyper-arousal. Our findings complement those from pharmacological treatment studies, further supporting the use of CO2 challenge to evaluate future therapeutic interventions for anxiety.",

    "30": "In this study, employing iPS technology, we derived and characterized iPSCs from dermal fibroblasts of an 82-year-old female patient affected by sporadic AD. The AD-iPSCs were differentiated into neuronal cells, in order to generate disease-specific protein association networks modeling the molecular pathology on the transcriptome level of AD, to analyse the reflection of the disease phenotype in gene expression in AD-iPS neuronal cells, in particular in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), and to address expression of typical AD proteins. We detected the expression of p-tau and GSK3B, a physiological kinase of tau, in neuronal cells derived from AD-iPSCs. Treatment of neuronal cells differentiated from AD-iPSCs with an inhibitor of \u03b3-secretase resulted in the down-regulation of p-tau. Transcriptome analysis of AD-iPS derived neuronal cells revealed significant changes in the expression of genes associated with AD and with the constitutive as well as the inducible subunits of the proteasome complex. The neuronal cells expressed numerous genes associated with sub-regions within the brain thus suggesting the usefulness of our in-vitro model. Moreover, an AD-related protein interaction network composed of APP and GSK3B among others could be generated using neuronal cells differentiated from two AD-iPS cell lines.",

Olanzapine was quantitatively determined by UV-spectrophotometry following its chromatography and elution. It was shown that one-step extraction from cadaveric blood by the proposed method made it possible to detect 55% of the total olanzapine content.

In vitro, idelalisib inhibits P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and organic anion transporting polypeptides 1B1 and 1B3, and GS-563117 is a time-dependent CYP3A inhibitor. This study enrolled 24 healthy subjects and evaluated (1) the effect of idelalisib on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of digoxin, a P-gp probe substrate, rosuvastatin, a breast cancer resistance protein, and OATP1B1/OATP1B3 substrate, and midazolam, a CYP3A substrate; and (2) the effect of a strong inducer, rifampin, on idelalisib PK. On treatment, the most common clinical adverse events (AEs) were headache and pyrexia. Grade 3 transaminase increases were observed in 5 of 24 subjects and were reversible. Two subjects had serious AEs after treatment completion (grade 3 pyrexia and/or drug-induced liver injury). Idelalisib coadministration did not affect digoxin and rosuvastatin PK. Coadministration with idelalisib increased plasma exposures of midazolam (138% and 437% for maximum observed plasma concentration [Cmax ] and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity [AUCinf ], respectively), consistent with the in vitro finding of CYP3A inhibition by GS-563117. Rifampin caused a substantial decrease in idelalisib (58% and 75%, Cmax and AUCinf , respectively) and GS-563117 exposures, indicating an enhanced contribution of CYP3A to idelalisib metabolism under a strongly induced state.",

This study evaluated the effects of menthol on the pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A substrate triazolam and the CYP2C substrate phenytoin. Menthol was orally administered to mice for 7\u2009d. Twenty-four hours after the administration of menthol, triazolam was orally administered, and the plasma concentration was measured. In addition, the CYP3A metabolic activity for triazolam and the CYP3A expression level in the liver were determined. The effects of menthol on the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin were assessed in the same manner. In the menthol-treated group, the area under the blood concentration-time curve (AUC) of triazolam was lower and its clearance was higher compared with the control group. The CYP3A metabolic activity and CYP3A expression level in the liver were significantly increased in the menthol-treated group compared with the control group. Similarly, the AUC of phenytoin was lower and the hepatic CYP2C expression level was higher in the menthol-treated group. Thus, menthol lowered the plasma concentrations of triazolam and phenytoin when concurrently administered. These effects may be attributed to an increased metabolic activity for these drugs due to the increased expression of CYP3A and CYP2C in the liver.",

The male to female ratio is 1.6 to 1. Mean age of onset is 54 \u00b1 12 years. UMN manifestations can include stiffness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, and pseudobulbar affect; LMN manifestations often include weakness accompanied by muscle atrophy, fasciculations, and cramping.

    "63": "A postal questionnaire was issued to a random, geographically stratified sample of community pharmacies in Ireland.", 
    "64": "The response rate was 37.6%. Pharmacists' awareness of the national source of benzodiazepine guidelines was low (26.6% previously aware). Benzodiazepine prescriptions were frequently encountered in practice and commonly for extended durations of 28 days. Pharmacists' involvement in roles extending beyond dispensing was limited. In the 6 months prior to the questionnaire, fewer than half of pharmacists reported having suggested discontinuation to a patient (43.7%) or having contacted a prescriber about a patient's benzodiazepine use (47.1%). Pharmacists acknowledged their potential to undertake a more extensive role in benzodiazepine supply and expressed willingness to do so in practice.",

The findings indicate the need to revisit existing benzodiazepine guidelines to improve pharmacists' awareness of them and to address long-term prescribing. The apparent lack of active pharmacist involvement in roles and activities extending beyond dispensing needs to be addressed. Given that most pharmacists encountered benzodiazepine prescriptions at least once daily in practice, they are well positioned to promote safe and appropriate benzodiazepine use. Sizeable proportions of pharmacists expressed willingness to expand upon their existing role and facilitate long-term patients in attempting discontinuation. Further research is needed to explore barriers and facilitators to pharmacists undertaking extended roles in benzodiazepine supply in greater detail.",

Using clozapine earlier on once a case appears to be refractory limits both social and personal morbidity of chronic psychosis. However treatment with second-generation antipsychotics is often complicated by adverse effects. We present a case of a 33-year-old Caucasian woman with a 25-year history of refractory psychotic mania after switching to a 2-year clozapine therapy. She presented clozapine-induced absolute neutropenia, agranulocytosis, which were complicated by Streptococcus pneumonia and sepsis. Clozapine-induced thromboembolism of the common femoral and right proximal iliac vein, as well as allergic vasculitis, was diagnosed. She achieved full remission on granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and specific antibiotic treatment. Early detection of severe clozapine-induced absolute neutropenia and agranulocytosis enabled the effective treatment of two among its most severe complications. Additional evidence to the previously reported possible causal relation between clozapine and venous thromboembolism is offered. Finally, clozapine-induced allergic vasculitis is confirmed as a late adverse effect of clozapine therapy.",

The significant parameters affecting the extraction efficiency were considered using Plackett-Burman design as a screening method. To obtain the optimum conditions with consideration of the selected significant variables, a Box-Behnken design was used. The microextraction procedure was performed using 29.1 \u03bcL of 1-undecanol, 1.36% (w/v) of NaCl, 10.0 \u03bcL of sodium dodecyl sulfate (25.0 \u03bcg mL(-1)), and 1.0 \u03bcL of Tween80 (25.0 \u03bcg mL(-1)) as an emulsifier in an extraction time of 20.0 min at pH 7.88. In order to investigate the validation of the developed method, some validation parameters including the linear dynamic range, repeatability, limit of detection, and recoveries were studied under the optimum conditions. The detection limits of the method were 0.017 and 0.086 ng mL(-1) for nitrazepam and midazolam, respectively. The extraction recovery percentages for the drugs studied were above 91.0 with acceptable relative standard deviation. The proposed methodology was successfully applied for the determination of these drugs in a number of human serum samples.",

Also, having a prescription for methadone for pain or being in methadone maintenance for the treatment of opioid dependence were both statistically associated with promethazine use.

Workup includes audiometry, a contrast enhanced MRI of the internal auditory canals, and exclusion of other diseases that can produce similar symptoms, like otosyphilis, autoimmune inner ear disease, perilymphatic fistula, superior semicircular canal syndrome, Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis, vestibular paroxysmia, and temporal bone tumors. A history of migraine should be sought as well because of a high rate of co-occurrence (Rauch, Otolaryngol Clin North Am 43:1011-1017, 2010). Treatment begins with conservative measures, including low salt diet, avoidance of stress and caffeine, and sleep hygiene. Medical therapy with a diuretic is the usual next step. If that fails to control symptoms, then the options of intratympanic (IT) steroids and betahistine are discussed. Next tier treatments include the Meniett device and endolymphatic sac surgery, but the efficacy of both is controversial. If the above measures fail to provide symptomatic control of vertigo, then ablative therapies like intratympanic gentamicin are considered. Rarely, vestibular nerve section or labyrinthectomy is considered for a patient with severe symptoms who does not show a reduction in vestibular function with gentamicin. Benzodiazepines and anti-emetics are used for symptomatic control during vertigo episodes. Rehabilitative options for unilateral vestibular weakness include physical therapy and for unilateral hearing loss include conventional hearing aids, contralateral routing of sound (CROS) and osseointegrated hearing aids.", 
    "74": "Together with pharmacoresistant seizures, the quality of life of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients is negatively impacted by behavioral comorbidities including but not limited to depression, anxiety and cognitive deficits. The pilocarpine model of TLE has been widely used to study characteristics of human TLE, including behavioral comorbidities. Since the outcomes of pilocarpine-induced TLE might vary depending on several experimental factors, we sought to investigate potential gender-related differences regarding selected behavioral alterations in C57BL6 mice. We found that epileptic mice, independent of gender, displayed increased anxiety-like behavior in the open-field test. In the object recognition test, epileptic mice, regardless of gender, showed a decreased recognition index at 24 (but not at 4) hours after training. On the other hand, no significant differences were found regarding mice learning and memory performance in the Barnes maze paradigm. Motor coordination and balance as assessed by the beam walk and rotarod tests were not impaired in epileptic mice of both genders. However, female mice, independent of epilepsy, performed the beam walk and rotarod tasks better than their male counterparts. We also found that only male epileptic mice displayed disturbed behavior in the forced swim test, but the mice of both genders displayed anhedonia-like behavior in the taste preference test. Lastly, we found that the extent of hilar cell loss is similar in both genders. In summary, both genders can be successfully employed to study behavioral comorbidities of TLE; however, taking the potential gender differences into account may help choose the more appropriated gender for a given task, which may be of value for the minimization of the number of animals used during the experiments.",

Family members should be involved in the weaning process and adoption of new life habits. General practitioners should be better trained regarding geriatric psychosocial issues and offer alternatives to prescribe psychotropic drugs such as cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia. Also, as a society, we should reconsider the highly medicalized stance we take to compensate for age-related losses.

    "79": "Panax ginseng C.A. MEYER (Araliaceae), which contains ginsenosides as its main components, has been shown to have various biological effects, including anti-inflammatory, anxiolytic, anti-stress, and anti-tumor effects. Orally administered ginsenoside Rb1 and Re are metabolized to 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (PPD) and compound K via ginsenoside Rd and 20(S)-protopanaxatriol (PPT) and ginsenoside Rh1 via ginsenoside Rg1 by gut microbiota, respectively. Therefore, we investigated the anti-stress effects of these metabolites, PPD and PPT, by measuring their anxiolytic and anti-inflammatory effects in immobilized mice. Treatment with PPD and PPT prior to immobilization stress increased the time spent in open arms and open arm entries in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test. The anxiolytic effects of PPD (10 mg/kg) and PPT (10 mg/kg) were comparable to that of buspirone (1 mg/kg). This observed anxiolytic effect of PPD was significantly blocked by flumazenil or bicuculline, and the effect of PPT was blocked by WAY-100635. Treatment with PPD also potently suppressed immobilization stress-induced serum levels of corticosterone and interleukin (IL)-6 by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. However, PPT treatment did not suppress them. Based on these findings, PPD and PPT may exhibit the anxiolytic effect via \u03b3-aminobutyrateA (GABAA) receptor(s) and serotonergic receptor(s), respectively, and PPD may have an anti-inflammatory effect that is more potent than that of PPT.", 
    "80": "Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are less prevalent in pregnant women than in nonpregnant women, but these disorders can create a host of clinical challenges when encountered. Unfortunately, little evidence is available to guide clinical decision making in this population. Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can have negative consequences on both fetus and mother, but it remains controversial as to the volume of alcohol consumption that correlates with these consequences. Likewise, little evidence is available to support the use of particular pharmacologic interventions for AUDs during pregnancy or to guide the management of alcohol detoxification in pregnant women. The use of benzodiazepines (the mainstay of most alcohol detoxification protocols) in pregnant women is controversial. Nevertheless, despite the lack of robust data to guide management of AUDs in pregnancy, clinicians need to make management decisions when confronted with these challenging situations. In that context, this article reviews the epidemiology of AUDs in pregnancy and the pharmacologic management of both AUDs and alcohol withdrawal in pregnant women, with the goal of informing clinicians about what is known about managing these co-occurring conditions.", 
    "81": "Early-life exposure to inflammation has been associated with several behavioral and cognitive deficits detected in adulthood. However, early behavioral changes have not been well described in rodent models of infection, specifically with respect to social behavior. In the present work we show that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge at 3 and 5days of age reduced overall social contact time in male juvenile rats, primarily mediated by the amount of contact they received from a novel conspecific. Given that there are important sensory, motor, and motivational components that underlie social interaction we sought to uncover the mechanism(s) responsible for the reduced social contact directed towards neonatal (n)LPS treated animals. Using an intranasal perfusion procedure, we induced a ZnSO4 lesion in a subset of novel conspecifics, effectively disrupting their olfactory processing via olfactory neuroepithelium degeneration. Overall, this procedure equalized the amount of social contact directed towards nLPS animals compared to nsaline rats. To determine whether nLPS disrupted auditory communication we evaluated ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) for the total number and duration of calls, and the average duration and frequency from each vocalization recording. There were no differences in USVs across treatment groups. Treating nLPS rats with diazepam maintained the level of social contact they initiated, compared to the stress-induced decrease observed in their saline treated counterparts. However, diazepam did not stabilize the amount of contact directed towards them. Together, this indicates that neither vocalized motor pathways nor anxiety cues, mediated by auditory/motor communication, are involved in the social deficits following nLPS. Instead, our data suggest that olfactory indicators, likely mediated through microbiota/immunomodulatory scent signals underlie the reductions in social contact that follow neonatal inflammation.", 
    "82": "We examined the effects of SEA0400 and CGP-37157 on the plasmalemmal Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) and mitochondrial NCX using H9c2 cardiomyocytes loaded with Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescent probes. The plasmalemmal NCX activity, which was measured as the increase in cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration after application of low Na(+) extracellular solution, was inhibited by SEA0400 but not by CGP-37157. The mitochondrial NCX activity, which was measured in permeabilized H9c2 cells as the decrease in mitochondrial Ca(2+) concentration after application of Ca(2+)-free extramitochondrial solution, was inhibited by CGP-37157 but not by SEA0400. These results indicate that SEA0400 and CGP-37157 act as selective inhibitors towards plasmalemmal and mitochondrial NCX, respectively, and provide pharmacological evidence that the plasmalemmal and mitochondrial NCX are distinct molecular entities.",

However, the influence of electroencephalographic (EEG) burst suppression (BS) on outcomes still remains unclear. This study investigated the impact of intravenous anesthetic-induced BS on the prognosis of RSE using a retrospective analysis of all consecutive adult patients who received intravenous anesthetic treatment for RSE at the Seoul National University Hospital between January 2006 and June 2011. Twenty-two of the 111 episodes of RSE were enrolled in this study. Of the 22 RSE patients, 12 (54.5%) were women and 18 (81.4%) exhibited generalized convulsive status epilepticus. Sixteen patients (72.7%) were classified as having acute symptomatic etiology, including three patients with anoxic encephalopathy, and others with remote symptomatic etiology. Only two patients (9.1%) had a favorable Status Epilepticus Severity Score (0-2) at admission. All patients received midazolam (MDZ) as a primary intravenous anesthetic drug for RSE treatment; three (13.6%) received MDZ and propofol, and one (4.5%) received MDZ and pentobarbital. The rates of mortality and poor outcome at discharge were 13.6% (n=3) and 54.5% (n=12), respectively. While BS was achieved in six (27.5%) patients, it was not associated with mortality or poor outcome. Induced BS was associated with prolonged hospital stay in subgroup analysis when excluding anoxic encephalopathy. Our results suggest that induction of BS for treating RSE did not affect mortality or outcome at discharge and may lead to an increased length of hospital stay.",

The number of hospital discharges of newborns diagnosed with NAS has increased more than 10-fold (from 0.4 to 4.4 discharges per 1,000 live births) in Florida since 1995, far exceeding the three-fold increase observed nationally. In February 2014, the Florida Department of Health requested the assistance of CDC to 1) assess the accuracy and validity of using Florida's hospital inpatient discharge data, linked to birth and infant death certificates, as a means of NAS surveillance and 2) describe the characteristics of infants with NAS and their mothers. This report focuses only on objective two, describing maternal and infant characteristics in the 242 confirmed NAS cases identified in three Florida hospitals during a 2-year period (2010-2011). Infants with NAS experienced serious medical complications, with 97.1% being admitted to an intensive care unit, and had prolonged hospital stays, with a mean duration of 26.1 days. The findings of this investigation underscore the important public health problem of NAS and add to current knowledge on the characteristics of these mothers and infants. Effective June 2014, NAS is now a mandatory reportable condition in Florida. Interventions are also needed to 1) increase the number and use of community resources available to drug-abusing and drug-dependent women of reproductive age, 2) improve drug addiction counseling and rehabilitation referral and documentation policies, and 3) link women to these resources before or earlier in pregnancy.", 
    "90": "We describe a child with Panayiotopoulos syndrome (PS) who presented with autonomic status epilepticus and developed respiratory arrest requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Because of that life-threatening episode and the risk of developing a similar event in subsequent seizures, we decided to initiate our patient on AED treatment. Such life-threatening complications were previously reported in only four children with PS. Although PS is considered to be a benign childhood epilepsy syndrome usually not requiring treatment with antiepileptic drugs, our case and the small number of similar cases in the literature show it is important to realize that it can rarely be associated with life-threatening complications. It is our opinion that children with PS who develop an episode of autonomic status epilepticus and those living in remote areas with no quick access to emergency departments should be initiated on AED therapy to minimize the risk of experiencing a subsequent potentially fatal seizure. We further suggest that the use of benzodiazepines in this syndrome should only be administered during the early stage of the seizure, since administration of this class of drugs during an established autonomic status epilepticus can result in further respiratory depression.", 
    "91": "Isoflurane is a representative inhalant anesthesia used in laboratory animals. However, isoflurane mediates respiratory depression and adverse clinical reactions during induction. In the present study, we established a novel balanced anesthesia method in mice that combined isoflurane anesthesia with midazolam and butorphanol (MB). Thirty-four male C57BL/6J mice received either isoflurane alone or isoflurane with an intra-peritoneal MB premedication (3 mg/kg midazolam and 4 mg/kg butorphanol). The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) in each group was evaluated. Induction time and adverse clinical reactions were recorded in each group. Core body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation (SPO(2)) were assessed before and for 1 h after induction. Premedication with MB achieved a significant reduction in MAC compared with isoflurane monoanesthesia (isoflurane, 1.38 \u00b1 0.15%; isoflurane with MB, 0.78 \u00b1 0.10%; P<0.05). Induction time was significantly shortened with MB premedication, and adverse reactions such as excitement or incontinence were observed less frequently. Furthermore, isoflurane anesthesia with MB premedication caused increase of respiratory rates compared to isoflurane monoanesthesia. No significant decrease of SPO(2) was observed in MBI anesthesia, while a decrease in SPO(2) was apparent with isoflurane monoanesthesia (baseline, 98.3% \u00b1 1.1; 10 min after induction, 91.8 \u00b1 6.4%; P<0.05). In conclusion, premedication with MB was effective for the mitigation of respiratory depression induced by isoflurane in mice, with rapid induction and fewer adverse clinical reactions.",

    "108": "Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine that is in wide clinical use as an anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant. Midazolam has been shown to inhibit ion channels, including calcium and potassium channels. So far, the effects of midazolam on cardiac human ether-\u00e0-go-go-related gene (hERG) channels have not been analyzed. The inhibitory effects of midazolam on heterologously expressed hERG channels were analyzed in Xenopus oocytes using the double-electrode voltage clamp technique. We found that midazolam inhibits hERG channels in a concentration-dependent manner, yielding an IC50 of 170 \u03bcM in Xenopus oocytes. When analyzed in a HEK 293 cell line using the patch-clamp technique, the IC50 was 13.6 \u03bcM. Midazolam resulted in a small negative shift of the activation curve of hERG channels. However, steady-state inactivation was not significantly affected. We further show that inhibition is state-dependent, occurring within the open and inactivated but not in the closed state. There was no frequency dependence of block. Using the hERG pore mutants F656A and Y652A we provide evidence that midazolam uses a classical binding site within the channel pore. Analyzing the subacute effects of midazolam on hERG channel trafficking, we further found that midazolam does not affect channel surface expression. Taken together, we show that the anesthetic midazolam is a low-affinity inhibitor of cardiac hERG channels without additional effects on channel surface expression. These data add to the current understanding of the pharmacological profile of the anesthetic midazolam.",

Using HPLC/MS methodology and a range of designed hairpin-forming oligonucleotides, the kinetics of reaction of a C8-bis-pyrrole pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) conjugate (GWL-78, 2) with sixteen isomeric oligonucleotides has been evaluated, each containing a single PBD binding site in one of two locations. The PBD-binding base-pair triplets were designed to include every possible combination of A and T bases adjacent to the covalently-reacting guanine, with the set of hairpins consisting of isomeric pairs containing the same sequence in the hairpin stem but with either hexaethylene glycol (HEG) or TTT loops. The PBD 2 reacted most rapidly with TGT and TGA sequences, with the possibility that adducts might form in both the 3'- and 5'-directions with some sequences according to modelling studies. A faster reaction rate was observed for all hairpins containing the HEG loop except one (Seq 10) when the PBD binding triplets were located either near the loop or adjacent to the 5'-end. Modelling studies have suggested that this difference in reactivity could be due to the structural flexibility of the HEG loop allowing both A-ring-3' and A-ring-5' adducts to form, while a TTT loop should favour only A-ring-5' adducts due to steric considerations. These findings contrast with the results reported by Nguyen and Wilson for the interaction of non-covalent DNA-binding molecules with DNA hairpins, where the loop structure was found to have little effect on interaction in the main stem of the hairpin.",

However, in Zimbabwe different species of Acacia are already used for the treatment of convulsions and dizziness. In the present study, the anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects of the Acacia tortilis, were evaluated by using different paradigms. For extraction, the leaves of acacia were blended with distilled water at 40\u00b0C and filtered. Two different doses of the extracts (400 and 800mg/kg) were administered in the mice once orally (p.o.) and after 30 min occurrence of seizures (strychnine at the dose of 1mg/kg, i.m.) were monitored. In the present work, acute toxicity and neurotoxicity of the extracts were also assessed by inducing hypoxic stress. The Acacia tortilis leaves AAq (400 and 800 mg/kg) produced a dose dependent increase in time of onset of seizures (197.8\u00b132.4 and 338.2\u00b140.6 respectively) when compared with its respective control (184.0\u00b113.8sec). The anticonvulsant effect after administration of AAq (800mg/kg: 338.2\u00b140.6 sec) was more pronounced than diazepam (290.6\u00b11.38 sec). The high dose (800mg/kg) of AAq administered orally prolonged the onset of convulsion and latencies for death following hypoxic stress. The present study suggested that Acacia have anticonvulsant property and may probably be affecting the inhibitory mechanism of glycine. It is also concluded that chemical constituent of acacia might act on BZD or 5-HT(1A) receptor and decrease the oxidative brain membrane damage process induced by psychological/hypoxic stress.

TSPO has long been described as being indispensable for mitochondrial cholesterol import that is essential for steroid hormone production. In contrast to this initial proposition, recent experiments reexamining TSPO function have demonstrated that it is not involved in steroidogenesis. This fundamental change has forced a reexamination of the functional interpretations made for TSPO that broadly impacts both basic and clinical research across multiple fields. In this minireview, we recapitulate the key studies from 25 years of TSPO research and concurrently examine their limitations that perhaps led towards the incorrect association of TSPO and steroid hormone production. Although this shift in understanding raises new questions regarding the molecular function of TSPO, these recent developments are poised to have a significant positive impact for research progress in steroid endocrinology.",

Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into a sham operation group, a model group, and three AST treatment groups. Cerebral ischemic models were induced by the clue-blocked method. Neurological deficits were examined. The animals were sacrificed after 2 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion, and mitochondria from the penumbra were purified. PBR density (Bmax) and affinity were measured by radioligand assays. Mitochondrial [(3)H]PK11195 binding was correlated with neurological deficits in rats. Compared to the model group, the 10 mg/kg AST group, 40 mg/kg AST group, and 100 mg/kg AST group had fewer neurological deficits. The effects in the 40 mg/ kg group did not significantly differ from the effects in the 100 mg/ kg group. Compared to the model group, the 10 mg/kg AST group, 40 mg/kg group, and 100 mg/kg group had a decreased Bmax in the penumbra. The Bmax decreased in the 40 mg/kg AST group and in the 100 mg/kg AST group compared with the 10 mg/kg group. The Bmax and neurological deficits in the 40 mg/kg did not significantly differ from those in the 100 mg/kg group. By contrast, the AST-treated rats showed no significant changes in the binding parameter equilibrium dissociation constant compared with those in the sham operation group and the model group.

Results of an inhibition of eight individual liver microsomal cytochromes P450 (CYP) are presented. As the patients are routinely premedicated with diazepam, possible interaction of diazepam with rocuronium has been also studied. Results indicated that rocuronium interacts with human liver microsomal CYPs by binding to the substrate site. Next, concentration dependent inhibition of liver microsomal CYP3A4 down to 42% (at rocuronium concentration 189\u00a0\u03bcM) was found. This effect has been confirmed with two CYP3A4 substrates, testosterone (formation of 6\u03b2-hydroxytestosterone) and diazepam (temazepam formation). CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 activities were inhibited down to 75-80% (at the same rocuronium concentration). Activities of other microsomal CYPs have not been inhibited by rocuronium. To prove the possibility of rocuronium interaction with other drugs (diazepam), the effect of rocuronium on formation of main diazepam metabolites, temazepam (by CYP3A4) and desmethyldiazepam, (also known as nordiazepam; formed by CYP2C19) in primary culture of human hepatocytes has been examined. Rocuronium has caused inhibition of both reactions by 20 and 15%, respectively. The results open a possibility that interactions of rocuronium with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 (and possibly also CYP2C19) may be observed.",

They have been associated with a broad range of symptoms, whose clinical meaning has not been fully appreciated. Methods: The PRISMA guidelines were followed to conduct a systematic review of the literature. Titles, abstracts, and topics were searched using the following terms: 'withdrawal symptoms' OR 'withdrawal syndrome' OR 'discontinuation syndrome' OR 'discontinuation symptoms', AND 'SSRI' OR 'serotonin' OR 'antidepressant' OR 'paroxetine' OR 'fluoxetine' OR 'sertraline' OR 'fluvoxamine' OR 'citalopram' OR 'escitalopram'. The electronic research literature databases included CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, PubMed and Web-of-Science from inception of each database to July 2014. Results: There were 15 randomized controlled studies, 4 open trials, 4 retrospective investigations, and 38 case reports. The prevalence of the syndrome was variable, and its estimation was hindered by a lack of case identification in many studies. Symptoms typically occur within a few days from drug discontinuation and last a few weeks, also with gradual tapering. However, many variations are possible, including late onset and/or longer persistence of disturbances. Symptoms may be easily misidentified as signs of impending relapse. Conclusions: Clinicians need to add SSRI to the list of drugs potentially inducing withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation, together with benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and other psychotropic drugs. The term 'discontinuation syndrome' that is currently used minimizes the potential vulnerabilities induced by SSRI and should be replaced by 'withdrawal syndrome'. \u00a9 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.",

Subjects in RAMPART achieved a successful primary outcome if they had cessation of seizures by the time of emergency department arrival. Data were collected on all subjects, but only the first enrollment for each individual was used in the primary analysis. The patterns of repeat enrollment are described, along with the demographics of these subjects. In addition, an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was estimated to assess the amount of within-subject correlation and its effect on the estimated treatment effect when all enrollments are included in the analysis.",

However, their ready availability and their synergistic effects with alcohol make them attractive for criminal intentions. To prove criminal action for legal reasons, it is often necessary to analyze beverage residues from a crime scene. Milk-based alcoholic drinks (whiskey creams) are gaining popularity due to their lower alcohol content pleasant taste. However, the complexity of this sample, containing proteins and fatty acids, can mask the presence of drugs or other substances in standard analysis methods. These characteristics make whiskey creams highly suitable for illicit purposes. In this study, eight BDZs, including diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, clobazam, flunitrazepam, bromazepam, flurazepam, nitrazepam and clonazepam, were extracted from whiskey cream using the Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS) method and analyzed using GC-MS. The QuEChERS protocol can efficiently separate most of the matrix from the target compounds while maintaining acceptable recoveries. The presented method is simple and rapid and has been validated in terms of precision, accuracy and recoveries. Limits of detection and limits of quantitation were in the range of 0.02-0.1 and 0.1-0.5 \u00b5g/mL, respectively.

Although patients on involuntary mental health holds are relatively understudied, common wisdom would hold that times for these patients can only be affected by addressing systems issues because they are not free to leave. The objective of this study was to determine whether both selected ED and patient-specific factors were associated with longer LOS.

Biased ligands differentially activate 5-HT7 serotonin receptor desensitization, internalization and degradation in addition to G protein activation. We have previously found that the atypical antipsychotics clozapine and olanzapine inhibited G protein activation and, surprisingly, induced both internalization and lysosomal degradation of 5-HT7 receptors. Here, we aimed to determine the mechanism of clozapine- and olanzapine-mediated degradation of 5-HT7 receptors. In the C-terminus of the 5-HT7 receptor, we identified two YXX\u03a6 motifs, LR residues, and a palmitoylated cysteine anchor as potential sites involved in receptor trafficking to lysosomes followed by receptor degradation. Mutating either of these sites inhibited clozapine- and olanzapine-mediated degradation of 5-HT7 receptors and also interfered with G protein activation. In addition, we tested whether receptor degradation was mediated by the GPCR-associated sorting protein-1 (GASP-1). We show that GASP-1 binds the 5-HT7 receptor and regulates the clozapine-mediated degradation. Mutations of the identified motifs and residues, located in or close to Helix-VIII of the 5-HT7 receptor, modified antipsychotic-stimulated binding of proteins (such as GASP-1), possibly by altering the flexibility of Helix-VIII, and also interfered with G protein activation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that binding of clozapine or olanzapine to the 5-HT7 receptor leads to antagonist-mediated lysosomal degradation by exposing key residues in the C-terminal tail that interact with GASP-1.",

The majority of property offenders (75%) attributed their offending to financial reasons, however those under the influence of benzodiazepines were proportionately more likely to nominate opportunistic reasons as the main motivation for their last offence. Stimulant dependence (AOR 5.34, 95% CI 1.91-14.93) was the only significant correlate of past month violent crime, and the largest proportion of violent offenders (47%) attributed their offending to opportunistic reasons. The majority of both property (71%) and violent offenders (73%) reported being under the influence of drugs the last time they committed an offence; the largest proportion of property offenders reported being under the influence of benzodiazepines (29%) and methamphetamine (24%), whilst violent offenders mostly reported being under the influence of heroin and alcohol (32% respectively).",

AP521 showed equal or more potent anxiolytic-like effects compared with diazepam, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, or tandospirone, a partial 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A receptor agonist, in three rat anxiety models; the Vogel-type conflict test, elevated plus maze test, and conditioned fear stress test. Although AP521 did not bind to the benzodiazepine receptor, it did bind to 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT5A and 5-HT7 receptors, and showed agonist activity for the human 5-HT1A receptor expressed in HEK293 cells. Tandospirone, which can stimulate the presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the raphe, tended to decrease extracellular 5-HT concentration in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in rats. In contrast, AP521 increased extracellular 5-HT concentration. In addition, AP521 enhanced the anti-freezing effect of citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in the fear conditioning model in rats and enhanced the citalopram-caused increase of the extracellular 5-HT concentration in the mPFC. These results suggest that AP521 exhibits potent anxiolytic effects by acting as a postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor agonist and by enhancing serotonergic neural transmission in the mPFC by a novel mechanism of action.",

To explore one side of risk, this study examines indicators of potential opioid inappropriate use or prescribing among Medicaid enrollees. We examined claims from enrollees aged 18-64 years in the 2010 Truven Health MarketScan\u00ae Multi-State Medicaid database, which consisted of weighted and nationally representative data from 12 states. Pharmaceutical claims were used to identify enrollees (n=359,368) with opioid prescriptions. Indicators of potential inappropriate use or prescribing included overlapping opioid prescriptions, overlapping opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions, long acting/extended release opioids for acute pain, and high daily doses. In 2010, Medicaid enrollees with opioid prescriptions obtained an average 6.3 opioid prescriptions, and 40% had at least one indicator of potential inappropriate use or prescribing. These indicators have been linked to opioid-related adverse health outcomes, and methods exist to detect and deter inappropriate use and prescribing of opioids.",

The aim of this study was to examine whether intranasal diazepam is an effective alternative to intravenous diazepam when treating status epilepticus. We undertook a retrospective cohort study based on the medical records of 19 stroke patients presenting with status epilepticus to our institution. We measured the time between arrival at the hospital, the intravenous or intranasal administration of diazepam, and the seizure termination. Intranasal diazepam was administered about 9 times faster than intravenous diazepam (1 vs 9.5 minutes, P = 0.001), resulting in about 3-fold reduction in the time to termination of seizure activity after arrival at the hospital (3 minutes compared with 9.5 minutes in the intravenous group, P = 0.030).
