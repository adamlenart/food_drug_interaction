Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA were measured in paraventricular (PVN) and arcuate (ARC) nuclei of the hypothalamus after 30\u2009minutes of restraint stress (RS). Anxiolytic effects of alprazolam (45 or 70\u2009\u00b5g/kg, ip) were evaluated. GABA(A)\u03b1(2) and GABA(A)\u03b3(2) mRNA were measured in the hippocampus (HIPP) and amygdala (AMY) of CB2xP and wild type (WT) mice. No differences were observed in the total distance travelled by CB2xP and WT mice in OF. Central and peripheral distances travelled significantly increased and decreased in CB2xP mice. Overexpression of CB2r reduced anxiety-like behaviours in LDB and EPM. In WT mice, RS increased CRF (82%) and POMC (42%) mRNA in the PVN and ARC nuclei, respectively. In CB2xP mice, RS also increased POMC (22%) mRNA in the ARC nucleus, but had no effect on CRF mRNA in the PVN nucleus. Administration of alprazolam was without effect in CB2xP mice. An increase of GABA(A)\u03b1(2) and GABA(A)\u03b3(2) mRNA in the hippocampus and amygdala of CB2xP mice was observed. Our findings revealed that increased expression of CB2r significantly reduced anxiogenic-related behaviours, modified the response to stress and impaired the action of anxiolytic drugs.",

    "24": "In this paper we used a model of individual differences in fear responses in rats selected according to their low and high freezing response in the contextual fear test and termed these animals \"low- and high anxiety\" rats, respectively. We studied differences in the density of GABA-A receptor alpha-2 subunits and gephyrin in the brain structures of low (LR) and high (HR) anxiety rats subjected to extinction trials and re-learning of a conditioned fear response. We found different patterns of spontaneous (western blotting) and fear-stimulated expression of alpha-2 subunits and gephyrin (western blotting and immunocytochemistry) in brain structures of HR and LR animals. Increased basal concentrations of alpha-2 subunits in the amygdala were observed in HR rats (compared to unconditioned control group). The density of alpha-2 subunits in the amygdala negatively correlated with freezing response duration in the aversive context on re-learning in the same group of animals. This finding supports data on the role of GABA-A receptor alpha-2 subunits in the amygdala in modulation of anxiety-like behaviour. Western blotting revealed that exposure of HR animals to fear-conditioned context upon re-test of the conditioned fear test elevated the concentration of alpha-2 subunits in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. In addition, immunocytochemistry showed that conditioned fear increased the number of cells co-expressing alpha-2 subunits and gephyrin in the basolateral amygdala and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in the HR group. Together, these findings suggest that animals that are more vulnerable to stress differ in the intracellular mechanisms that control GABA-A receptor trafficking in limbic structures (hippocampus and amygdala), which are involved in the control of emotional behaviour. These data indicate a possible mechanism for the variable effects of benzodiazepines among patients with anxiety disorders. The obtained data may also help to better explain the neurobiological mechanisms that operate in clinical situations where anxious patients subjected to exposure therapy are exposed to an aversive, contextual and conditioning stimulus.", 
    "25": "Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is expressed in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), and act centrally to provoke stress-like autonomic and behavioral responses. Urocortins 1-3 are additional ligands to the CRF receptors 1 and 2. Ucn 1 neurons are primarily concentrated in the Edinger-Westphal (EW) nucleus and also have been associated with stress responses. It is also known that UCN 1 respond in different ways depending on the stressor presented. Benzodiazepines can act via the CRF peptidergic system and chronic administration of alprazolam does not interfere with CRF mRNA expression in the PVN, but significantly increase Ucn 1 mRNA expression in the EW. The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between different stressor stimuli, foot shock (FS) and restraint (R), and the mRNA expression of CRF and Ucn 1 in the PVN and EW using alprazolam (A). We employed fos activation and in situ hybridization. Restraint group presented increased fos-ir and CRF mRNA expression in the PVN compared to FS group. The stress responses of R group were prevented by A. In the EW, fos-ir was higher in the FS group than in the R group, whereas Ucn 1 mRNA expression was higher in the R group than in the FS group. Alprazolam significantly increased fos-ir and Ucn 1 mRNA expression in both groups. Our results show that PVN and EW respond in different ways to the same stressors. Furthermore, EW of stressed animals replies in a complementary way comparing to PVN with the use of Alprazolam.", 
    "26": "The progression and development of multiple sclerosis (MS) has long been hypothesized to be associated with stress. Benzodiazepines have been observed to reduce negative consequences of stress on the immune system in experimental and clinical models, but there are no data on their effects on MS, or experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for human MS. We designed experiments conducted to ascertain whether alprazolam could modify the clinical, histological and neuroendocrine manifestations of acute EAE in Lewis rats exposed to a chronic auditory stressor. EAE was induced by injection of an emulsion of MBP and complete Freund's adjuvant containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra. Stress application and treatment with drugs (placebo or alprazolam) were initiated 5days before inoculation and continued daily for the duration of the experiment (days 14 or 34 postinoculation).Our results show significant increases in the severity of neurological signs, the histological lesions of the spinal cord (inflammation), and the corticosterone plasmatic levels in stressed rats compared to those non-stressed ones. Treatment with alprazolam reversed the adverse effects of stress. These findings could have clinical implications in patients suffering from MS treated with benzodiazepines, so besides the psychopharmacological properties of alprazolam against stress, it has beneficial consequences on EAE.",

The dental practitioner must recognize patients with needle phobia before the administration of local anesthetics to identify patients who are potentially reactive and to prevent untoward sequelae. Needle phobia is highly associated with avoidance behavior, and the dentist must exhibit compassion and respect. To avoid bradycardia, hypotension, unconsciousness, convulsions, and possibly asystole, oral premedication with benzodiazepines or other antianxiety agents must be considered for patients who are needle phobic. Management of needle phobiaeinduced syncope includes perioperative monitoring, oxygen administration, positioning, atropine, and vasopressors.",

By using unidirectional registration methods, the quantified anatomical changes are asymmetric, i.e., depend on the direction of the registration. Moreover, the registration is challenged by the large and complex organ deformations that can occur in, e.g., cervical cancer patients. The aim of this work was to develop, test, and validate a symmetric feature-based nonrigid registration method that can handle organs with large-scale deformations.", 
    "34": "A symmetric version of the unidirectional thin plate spline robust point matching (TPS-RPM) algorithm was developed, implemented, tested, and validated. Tests were performed by using the delineated cervix and uterus and bladder in CT scans of five cervical cancer patients. For each patient, five CT scans with a large variability in organ shape, volume, and deformations were acquired. Both the symmetric and the unidirectional algorithm were employed to calculate the registration geometric accuracy (surface distance and surface coverage errors), the inverse consistency, the residual distances after transforming anatomical landmarks, and the registration time. Additionally, to facilitate the further use of our symmetric method, a large set of input parameters was tested.", 
    "35": "The developed symmetric algorithm handled successfully the registration of bladders with extreme volume change for which TPS-RPM failed. Compared to the unidirectional algorithm the symmetric algorithm improved, for the registration of organs with large volume change, the inverse consistency by 78% and the surface coverage by 46%. Similarly, for organs with small volume change, the symmetric algorithm improved the inverse consistency by 69% and the surface coverage by 13%. The method allowed for anatomically coherent registration in only 35 s for cervix-uterus and 151 s for bladder, while keeping the inverse consistency errors around 1 mm and the surface matching errors below 1 mm. Compared to rigid alignment the symmetric method reduced the residual distances between anatomical landmarks from a range of 5.8 +/- 2-70.1 +/- 20.1 mm to a range of 1.9 +/- 0.2-8.5 +/- 5.2 mm.",

    "51": "While anxiety models are often based on locomotor activity responses, the stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH) paradigm uses the autonomic stress response by measuring body temperature. The effects of putative anxiogenic compounds in the SIH paradigm are inconclusive in mice and have not been examined in rats. Furthermore, it has been suggested that drug-induced effects on body temperature could be dependent on locomotor activity levels. Therefore, the effects of three anxiogenic substances, yohimbine (an \u03b1(2) receptor antagonist), mCPP (a 5HT(2C) receptor agonist) and FG-7142 (a GABA(A) receptor inverse agonist acting at the benzodiazepine site) on the stress-induced body temperature and locomotor activity response were studied in rats using novel cage stress. All anxiogenic compounds resulted in hypothermia. In contrast, FG-7142 and yohimbine increased locomotor activity levels, whereas mCPP reduced locomotor activity levels. The lack of an increased body temperature response of anxiogenic compounds indicates that the anxiogenic capacity of a drug does not necessarily yield increased autonomic stress responsivity. Moreover, the present study shows that a drug-induced decreased body temperature can be accompanied by increased locomotor activity, suggesting that both parameters represent independent parameters of the stress response.", 
    "52": "The aim of the study was to determine the contemporary socio-clinical profile and perinatal outcome of illicit substance use in pregnancy in a large UK city and compare with published literature. Cases were identified retrospectively from the 'cause for concern' referrals over 5 years (2003-2007). Data was collected on mother-infant pair from medical notes and laboratory records. Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests were used where appropriate for statistical analysis. One hundred sixty-eight women were identified as using illicit substance in pregnancy. Smoking (97.4%), unemployment (85.4%) and single status (42.3%) were frequent. Besides controlled use of methadone, heroin, cannabis and benzodiazepines were the most commonly used drugs. Hepatitis C prevalence was high (29.9%) despite low antenatal screening rates (57.7%). Neonatal morbidity was related to prematurity (22.9%), small for dates (28.6%) and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS; 58.9%). By day 5 of life, 95.1% of the babies developing NAS and 96.1% of those requiring pharmacological treatment were symptomatic. Of the infants developing NAS, 31.7% required pharmacological treatment. A total of 82.5% babies went home with their mother, and 21.2% were placed on the Child Protection Register. Only 14.3% were breast feeding at discharge. Illicit substance use in pregnancy continues to be associated with significant maternal and neonatal morbidity, and the socio-clinical profile in this decade appears unchanged in the UK. Hepatitis C prevalence is high, and detection should be improved through targeted antenatal screening. Where facility in the community is unavailable, 5 days of hospital stay is sufficient to safely identify babies at risk of developing NAS. Most babies were discharged home with their mother.", 
    "53": "The deleterious effects of anesthetic agents in patients suffering from coronary artery disease are well known. The risk increases when a patient has compromised ventricular function. There is a paucity of literature regarding the choice of the suitable agent to avoid deleterious effects in such patients. The use of etomidate and propofol has been considered superior to other intravenous anesthetic agents in these groups of patients. The aim of the present study is to compare the hemodynamic effects of anesthesia induction with etomidate, thiopentone, propofol, and midazolam in patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction. This randomized clinical trail was conducted at the All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. Sixty patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < 45%) scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass surgery participated in this study. After stabilization baseline hemodynamic data stroke volume variation and systemic vascular resistance index were recorded for all patients (Flo Trac TM sensor with Vigileo cardiac output monitor used for hemodynamic monitoring). The patients were randomly alloted to one of the four groups and the intravenous induction agent was administered for over 60-90 seconds (Group E--Etomidate 0.2 mg/Kg; Group M--Midazolam 0.15 mg/Kg; Group T--Thiopentone 5 mg/Kg; Group P--Propofol 1.5 mg/Kg). Hemodynamic data were recorded at one minute intervals starting from induction till seven minutes after intubation,--the end point of the present study. There was a significant decrease in the heart rate in comparison to the baseline(-7 to -15%, P = 0.001), mean arterial pressure (-27 to -32%, P = 0.001), cardiac index (-36 to -38%, P = 0.001), and stroke volume index (-27 to -34%, P = 0.001) after induction in all four groups. The hemodynamic response was similar in all the four groups. There was no significant change in central venous pressure and stroke volume variation (SVV) during induction and intubation, while the effects on the systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) were variable. The midazolam group was the most effective in preventing intubation stress (tachycardia,hypertension). The change from baseline values in heart rate (+ 4%, P = 0.12) and mean arterial pressure (-1%, P = 0.77) after intubation were not statistically significant in the midazolam group. The etomidate group was the least effective of all the four groups in minimizing stress response, with statistically significant increase from baseline in both heart rate (P = 0.001) and mean arterial pressure (P = 0.001) at 1 minute after intubation. All the four anesthetic agents were acceptable for induction in patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction despite a 30-40% decrease in the cardiac index. Clinician experience along with knowledge of the potential interactions (e.g., premedication, concurrent opioid use) is needed to determine hemodynamic stability during anesthetic induction in these patients with ventricular dysfunction.",

    "58": "Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is known to be involved in relapse after cocaine withdrawal, but the underlying cellular mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we report that after terminating repeated cocaine exposure in rats, a gradual increase in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the mPFC facilitates activity-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory\u00a0synapses on layer V pyramidal neurons. This enhanced synaptic plasticity could be attributed to BDNF-induced suppression of GABAergic inhibition in the mPFC by reducing the surface expression of GABA(A) receptors. The BDNF effect was mediated by BDNF-TrkB-phosphatase 2A signaling pathway. Downregulating TrkB expression bilaterally in the mPFC reduced the locomotor hypersensitivity to cocaine 8\u00a0days after cocaine withdrawal. Thus, elevated BDNF expression after cocaine withdrawal sensitizes the excitatory synapses in the mPFC to undergo activity-induced persistent potentiation that may contribute to cue-induced drug craving and drug-seeking behavior.", 
    "59": "Degenerative joint diseases are related to the excessive degradation of collagen and proteoglycans in cartilage. One of the potent inflammatory mediators of cartilage metabolism is interleukin-1 (IL-1) that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of degenerative joint diseases. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands have anti-inflammatory activity in rheumatoid arthritis. The present study shows that 4'-chlorodiazepam (Ro-54864), an agonist of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, counteract inhibition of collagen and DNA biosynthesis, induced by IL-1. Pk-1195, an antagonist of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors did not restore inhibitory effects of IL-1. The mechanism of collagen biosynthesis and cell division regulation involves insulin-like growth factor-I receptor signaling. We found that IL-1 inhibited expression of IGF-IR, while Ro-54864 stimulated the expression of this receptor. Increase in the expression of this receptor was accompanied by increase in mTOR expression and AKT phosphorylation while it had no effect on Ras-Raf-mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Although IL-1 caused activation of apoptosis in chondrocytes, an addition of Ro-54864 to the cells inhibited the process as detected by annexin V cell staining followed by flow cytometry. The mechanism of this process may be related to protective effect of signal induced by IGF-I receptor. The data suggest that the mechanism of the protective effects of Ro-54864 on IL-1-induced effects in chondrocytes undergoes through mTOR and AKT signaling. It suggest that peripheral benzodiazepine receptor agonist may be considered as a potential pharmacotherapeutical agents in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.",

We employed a chip-HPLC-MS system for determining small molecules such as drug metabolites in biological fluids. This chip-HPLC-MS system integrates a microfluidic switch, a 2-dimensional column design including an enrichment column (160 nL) for sample pre-concentration and an analytical column for chromatographic separation, as well as a nanospray emitter on a single polyimide chip. In this study, a relatively large sample volume (500 nL) was injected into the enrichment column for pre-concentration and an additional 4 \u03bcL of the initial mobile phase was applied to remove un-retained components from the sample matrix prior to chromatographic separation. The 2-dimensional column design provides the advantages of online sample concentration and reducing matrix influence on MS detection. 7-Aminoflunitrazepam (7-aminoFM2), a major metabolite of flunitrazepam (FM2), was determined in urine samples using the integrated chip-HPLC-MS system. The linear range was 0.1-10 ng mL(-1) and the method detection limit (signal-to-noise ratio of 3) was 0.05 ng mL(-1) for 7-aminoFM2. After consecutive liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and solid-phase extraction (SPE), the chip-HPLC-MS exhibited high correlation between 7-aminoFM2 spiked Milli-Q water and 7-aminoFM2 spiked urine samples.

Three days after surgery, she became progressively less interactive. Verbal output was dramatically reduced. She exhibited waxy flexibility, stupor, mutism, posturing, rigidity, negativism, and grimacing. Video/EEG monitoring showed no evidence of ongoing seizure activity. She was treated with high-dose benzodiazepines for presumed catatonia, but the behavioral pattern did not resolve. Subsequently the patient underwent a full course of electroconvulsive therapy.

    "101": "The triple test, recently developed to assess anxiety-related behaviors in rodents, combines three widely used behavioral tests: the open field (OF), elevated plus maze (EPM) and light/dark box (LDB). The EPM and LDB, individually, are normally sensitive to the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines only in the first trial, due to the phenomenon of one-trial tolerance, which limits their use in longitudinal studies. The main objective of the present investigation was to verify whether the anxiolytic-like effects of chlordiazepoxide (CDZ), previously observed in naive animals submitted to the triple test, would persist after repeated testing. To this end, three experiments were carried out where male Wistar rats received CDZ (10mg/kg) 30min before the triple test for 2, 3 or 20 consecutive days. Except for the first day of drug treatment following a previous test experience in an undrugged state, CDZ had enduring anxiolytic-like effects under all schedules, promoting an increase in the exploration of the EPM open arms (and in some cases of the white compartment of the LDB), without affecting the number of closed-arm entries. The finding that rats did not develop tolerance to CDZ even with chronic treatment and repeated exposures to the triple test suggests that this new device is a promising tool to be used in longitudinal studies involving pharmacological manipulations of anxiety-related behaviors.",

However, the mechanisms by which antipsychotics induce body weight gain are unknown, and no reliable animal models of antipsychotics-induced weight gain have been established. The present studies were designed to establish male rat models of weight gain induced by chronic and acute treatment with antipsychotics. Six-week chronic treatment with olanzapine (5, 7.5, and 10mg/kg/day) in male Sprague-Dawley rats fed a daily diet resembling a human macronutrient diet, significantly increased body weight gain and weight of fatty tissues. In contrast, ziprasidone (1.25, 2.5, and 5mg/kg/day) administration caused no observable adverse effects. We then investigated feeding behavior with acute antipsychotic treatment in male rats using an automated food measurement apparatus. Rats were allowed restricted access to normal laboratory chow (4h/day). With acute olanzapine (0.5, 1, and 2mg/kg, i.p.) treatment in the light phase, food intake volume and duration were significantly increased, while treatment with ziprasidone (0.3, 1, and 3mg/kg, i.p.) did not increase food intake volume or meal time duration. Findings from the present studies showed that chronic treatment with olanzapine in male rats induced body weight gain, and acute injection induced hyperphagia, suggesting that hyperphagia may be involved in the weight gain and obesity-inducing properties of chronically administered olanzapine. These animal models may provide useful experimental platforms for analysis of the mechanism of hyperphagia and evaluating the potential risk of novel antipsychotics to induce weight gain in humans.",

DM may be associated with moderate cognitive deficits and neurophysiologic/structural changes in the brain (diabetic encephalopathy). Psychiatric manifestations seem to accompany this encephalopathy, since the prevalence of depression in diabetic patients is much higher than in the general population, and clonazepam is being used to treat this complication. The excessive production of oxygen free radicals that may occur in diabetes induces a variety of lesions in macromolecules, including DNA. In this work, we analyzed DNA damage in leukocytes from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats submitted to the forced swimming test. The DNA damage index was significantly elevated (DI=61.00 \u00b1 4.95) in the diabetic group compared to the control group (34.00 \u00b1 1.26). Significant reductions of the damage index were observed in diabetic animals treated with insulin (45.00 \u00b1 1.82), clonazepam (52.00 \u00b1 1.22), or both agents (39.00 \u00b1 5.83, not significantly different from control levels).

However, the temporal relationship of their development, and their roles in the emergence of the epilepsy, are uncertain. This was investigated in the kainic acid (KA)-induced post-status epilepticus (SE) model of TLE. Male Wistar rats (7 weeks, n=53) were randomised into control and KA groups. At 24h, 2, 4 or 6 weeks sham and KA post-SE animals were euthanised, brains extracted and GABA(A)/cBZR density, neuronal loss and MFS measured in hippocampal sub-regions. GABA(A)/cBZR density (B(max)) was measured by saturation-binding analysis using [(3)H]-flumazenil. At 24h post-SE GABA(A)/cBZR density was increased in almost all hippocampal subregions, but was decreased at the later time points with the exception of the dentate gyrus. There was significant neuronal loss in the CA3 SPc region (-24 \u00b1 9.3%, p<0.05) at 24h, which remained stable at the later time points associated with an elevated GABA(A)/cBZR density per surviving neuron at 24h post-SE (+56.4%; p<0.05) which returned to control levels by 6 weeks post-SE. MFS in the dentate gyrus progressively increased over the 6 weeks following SE (+70.6% at 6 weeks), at which time there was a significant inverse relationship with GABA(A)/cBZR binding (r(2)=0.87; p=0.02). The temporal evolution of GABA(A)/cBZR density changes post-KA-induced SE, and the relationship with decreases in hippocampal pyramidal cell numbers and MFS, may point to a key role for these changes in the pathogenesis of acquired limbic epileptogenesis.",

In this study, in vitro quantitative autoradiography and in situ hybridization were assessed in major hypothalamic nuclei. Reverse Transcription Reaction-Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests were performed for specific GABAAR receptor subunit gene primers synthases of non-hibernating (NHIB) and hibernating (HIB) hamsters.

A computerized search on PubMed carried from 1980 to January 2009 led to the summarization of the results. There are several strategies to manage chronic insomnia. To initiate treatment, it is necessary to define it and differentiate it from other co-morbid psychiatric disorders. Non-pharmacologic strategies such as stimulus control therapy and relaxation and cognitive therapies have the best effect sizes followed by sleep restriction, paradoxical intention and sleep hygiene education which have modest to less than modest effect sizes. Among pharmacotherapeutic agents, non-benzodiazepine hypnotics are the first line of management followed by benzodiazepines, amitryptiline and antihistaminics.

    "137": "Polyploidy results from deregulated cell division and has been considered an undesirable event leading to increased mutation rate and cancer development. However, polyploidy may also render cancer cells more vulnerable to chemotherapy. Here, we identify a small-molecule inducer of polyploidy, R1530, which interferes with tubulin polymerization and mitotic checkpoint function in cancer cells, leading to abortive mitosis, endoreduplication and polyploidy. In the presence of R1530, polyploid cancer cells underwent apoptosis or became senescent which translated into potent in vitro and in vivo efficacy. Normal proliferating cells were resistant to R1530-induced polyploidy thus supporting the rationale for cancer therapy by induced polyploidy. Mitotic checkpoint kinase BubR1 was found downregulated during R1530-induced exit from mitosis, a likely consequence of PLK4 inhibition. BubR1 knockdown in the presence of nocodazole induced an R1530-like phenotype, suggesting that BubR1 plays a key role in polyploidy induction by R1530 and could be exploited as a target for designing more specific polyploidy inducers.",

The parallel tube and dispersion models were found to be appropriate mathematical models to describe the pharmacokinetics (PK). Simulation results using 33% as the CV for CYP3A4 content reflected reported CV values of the area under the curve (AUC) for 40 CYP3A4 substrates for both intravenous and oral administration.

As predicted by our model, we find that anxiety (associated with reduced neural inhibition) impairs selection among options and associated prefrontal cortical activity, even in a simple, nonaffective verb-generation task, and the GABA agonist midazolam (which increases neural inhibition) improves selection, whereas retrieval from semantic memory is unaffected when selection demands are low.

BDZ modulation of GABA(A) receptors is often described in terms of increased opening frequency, and contrasted with the increased open durations occurring with barbiturate modulation. Several studies spanning single channel, rapid kinetic, and whole cell techniques have suggested that BDZs effect this observed change in frequency through increased affinity for GABA. BDZ-sensitive \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 isoforms exist at extrasynaptic as well as synaptic locations, where they encounter markedly different concentration and time-course of GABA exposure. Interestingly, this affinity-based mechanism (specifically, decreasing the GABA unbinding rate) is only predicted to increase opening frequency under conditions that allow the unbinding and rebinding cycles typical of prolonged exposure to low GABA concentrations, which are more likely to occur at extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors. In contrast, when rebinding is less likely, such as may occur in certain synaptic conditions, the number, but not the frequency, of channel openings increases in response to BDZ modulation. In conclusion, not only can multiple kinetic mechanisms alter channel opening frequency, but a single mechanism - increased affinity - impacts opening frequency differently under different contexts of GABA(A) receptor activation.",

We used a new animal model composed of high (HR) and low (LR) anxiety rats, selected according to their behaviour in the contextual fear test (i.e., the duration of a freezing response was used as a discriminating variable). In these rats, we examined the effects of both drugs on the release of glutamate and GABA in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) during the first extinction trial of a conditioned fear test. The results showed that administration of d-cycloserine (15 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly enhanced the inhibition of an aversive context-induced freezing response observed during the extinction session in HR and LR rats. In contrast, midazolam (0.75 mg/kg, i.p.) accelerated the attenuation of fear responses only in HR rats. The less anxious behaviour of LR animals given saline was accompanied by elevated basal levels of glutamate in the BLA, in comparison with HR rats, and a stronger elevation of GABA in response to contextual fear. In HR animals, the pretreatment of rats with d-cycloserine and midazolam significantly increased the local concentration of GABA and inhibited the expression of contextual fear. These findings suggest that animals more vulnerable to stress have innate deficits in brain systems that control the activity of the BLA mediating the central effect of stress.

In most published work, nausea is reported to occur before chemotherapy drugs are administered by approximately 20% of patients at any one chemotherapy cycle and by 25-30% of patients by their fourth chemotherapy cycle. Most studies in adult patients strongly support the view that the development of ANV involves elements of classical conditioning. The best method to avoid development of ANV is to adequately prevent both vomiting and nausea from the first exposure to chemotherapy. If anticipatory side effects develop, behavioral treatment techniques, such as systematic desensitization, have been shown effective. Benzodiazepines used in combination with behavioral techniques or antiemetics may also be useful. The evidence on which these conclusions are based is reviewed in this article.",

We describe the prevalence of high-dose opioid use and associated demographic and clinical characteristics among veterans treated in a VA regional healthcare network. Veterans with chronic non-cancer pain prescribed high doses of opioids (\u2265 180 mg/day morphine equivalent; n=478) for 90+ consecutive days were compared to two groups with chronic pain: Traditional-dose (5-179 mg/day; n=500) or no opioid (n=500). High-dose opioid use occurred in 2.4% of all chronic pain patients and in 8.2% of all chronic pain patients prescribed opioids long-term. The average dose in the high-dose group was 324.9 (SD=285.1)mg/day. The only significant demographic difference among groups was race (p=0.03) with black veterans less likely to receive high doses. High-dose patients were more likely to have four or more pain diagnoses and the highest rates of medical, psychiatric, and substance use disorders. After controlling for demographic factors and VA facility, neuropathy, low back pain, and nicotine dependence diagnoses were associated with increased likelihood of high-dose prescriptions. High-dose patients frequently did not receive care consistent with treatment guidelines: there was frequent use of short-acting opioids, urine drug screens were administered to only 25.7% of patients in the prior year, and 32.0% received concurrent benzodiazepine prescriptions, which may increase risk for overdose and death. Further study is needed to identify better predictors of high-dose usage, as well as the efficacy and safety of such dosing.", 
    "210": "Previous research suggests that intrinsic efficacy of benzodiazepines is an important determinant of their behavioral effects. We evaluated the reinforcing effects of the benzodiazepine partial agonist bretazenil using behavioral economic models referred to as \"consumer demand\" and \"labor supply\". Four rhesus monkeys were trained under a progressive-ratio (PR) schedule of i.v. midazolam injection. A range of doses of bretazenil (0.001-0.03 mg/kg/injection and vehicle) was evaluated for self-administration with an initial response requirement of 40 that doubled to 640; significant self-administration was maintained at doses of 0.003-0.03 mg/kg/injection. Next, a dose of bretazenil that maintained peak injections/session was made available with initial response requirements doubling from 10 to 320 (maximum possible response requirements of 160 and 5120, respectively), and increasing response requirements decreased self-administration (mean number of injections/session) of a peak dose (0.01 mg/kg/injection). Analyses based on consumer demand revealed that a measure of reinforcing strength termed \"essential value\", for bretazenil was similar to that previously obtained with midazolam (non-selective full agonist), but less than that observed for zolpidem (full agonist, selective for \u03b11 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors). According to labor supply analysis, the reinforcing effects of bretazenil were influenced by the economic concept referred to as a \"price effect\", similar to our previous findings with midazolam but not zolpidem. In general, behavioral economic indicators of reinforcing effectiveness did not differentiate bretazenil from a non-selective full agonist. These findings raise the possibility that degree of intrinsic efficacy of a benzodiazepine agonist may not be predictive of relative reinforcing effectiveness.",

Clobazam microemulsion (CZME) and CZMME were prepared by titration method and characterized. Brain uptake and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from drug concentration in mice brain versus time plots following intranasal administration of radiolabeled CZME and CZMME, intravenous and intranasal administration of radiolabeled clobazam solution. Gamma scintigraphy imaging of rabbit brain following intranasal administration was performed. Formulations were investigated for the onset of seizures in PTZ-challenged mice. Brain targeting efficiency and direct nose-to-brain transport percentage for mucoadhesive microemulsion suggested an improved brain uptake following intranasal administration. The findings were supported by gamma scintigraphy images. Delay in onset of PTZ-induced seizures with CZMME compared with positive control and placebo-treated groups confirmed the improved brain uptake.

    "222": "We have earlier investigated the interaction of the antipsychotic drugs chlorpromazine(CPZ) and olanzapine(OLP) with glycerophospholipid monolayers. These experiments were carried out at high and low temperatures and showed that OLP had a more pronounced effect on the packing of the phospholipid (PL) monolayers than CPZ. At pH 7.36, where OLP consists of one positive and one neutral species. In the present work we have studied the interaction of the drugs with monolayers of PLs by the Langmuir technique at pH 6.00 and 10.00 at 37\u00b0C. The PLs were palmitoylphosphatidyl-choline(DPPC), 1-stearoyl-2-arachinodonoylphoshatidylcholine(SAPC),dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-serine(DPPS) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylserine(POPS). OLP has a pKa around 7.4, with one neutral and one positive species at pH 6.00 and pH 10.00, respectively. CPZ has pKa value around 9.4, and is positively charged at pH 6.00 and neutral at pH 10.00. Our studies revealed that the surface area of DPPC with CPZ in the subphase did not change at pH 6.00. In contrast, OLP increased the mean molecular area(MMA) of DPPC at pH 6.00, while CPZ caused distinct increase in MMA on the monolayer packing of all the other PLs, including monolayers of DPPC at pH 10.00. OLP, increased MMA of all PLs at both pHs. Further, OLP increased MMA of DPPC (pH 10.00), SAPC (pH 10.00), DPPS (pH 6.00) and POPS (pH 6.00) at 30mN/m, the expected MMA of biological membranes. CPZ had the more pronounced effect at lift-off and gave an effect of the monolayers with negatively charged head groups in accordance our earlier experiments. However, CPZ affected the packing of the SAPC monolayer both at pH 6.00 and 10.00, and DPPC at pH 10.00. Both these PLs have neutral choline head group. Our results suggest that both drugs intercalate in the PL monolayers, and that the intercalation might involve electrostatic interaction with the head groups or hydrophobic interaction with the acyl chains of the PLs, or both. Probably the drugs intercalate to different extents depending on charge of both the drugs and the PL head groups. Our investigation may suggest that the interaction of CPZ and OLP with membrane PLs could be linked to both the psychotropic and the side effects.",

The combination of Azone and iontophoresis produce the highest transdermal steady-state flux of midazolam but no synergic effect was achieved when the two enhancement strategies were applied in combination, showing that although selecting the best conditions for iontophoresis application, it is less effective for augmenting the transdermal delivery of midazolam than the chemical enhancer Azone.", 
    "227": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common, chronic mental illness that has a significant burden on the patient's quality of life. Treatment for GAD routinely consists of monotherapy with a proven anxiolytic such as an antidepressant or benzodiazepine, but many patients do not respond fully to these drugs, and additional treatment may be needed. Therefore, we reviewed the safety and efficacy of atypical antipsychotics as adjunct therapy to standard GAD pharmacotherapy in patients deemed treatment resistant. We performed a literature search of the MEDLINE database for English-language articles published from January 1966-May 2009. Identified articles were evaluated, and only open-label trials and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the review. Relevant references from the articles were also evaluated. Only a few reports of large-scale RCTs that assessed an atypical antipsychotic for treatment-resistant GAD have been published. Articles were found for five of the eight currently available atypical antipsychotics, but not for asenapine, clozapine, and paliperidone. Several open-label trials and smaller RCTs support the need for further evaluation of aripiprazole and quetiapine for treatment-refractory GAD, although one quetiapine trial demonstrated negative results. There is disparate data for risperidone, with one open-label trial and one small RCT showing positive results and one large RCT showing negative results. One open-label trial of ziprasidone and one RCT of olanzapine both showed beneficial effects of the drugs. Adverse effects were specific to each agent, with weight gain being the most common, but many studies did not monitor systematically for lipid level, weight, or glucose level changes. Although data suggest efficacy regarding the use of atypical antipsychotics for augmentation of treatment-refractory GAD, more rigorous studies (large, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials) on the safety and efficacy of these agents are needed in order to recommend their use in patients with GAD.", 
    "228": "For nurses in clinical practice, understanding the pharmacology of drugs their patients take is relevant to understanding their therapeutic uses, side effect profiles, and adverse discontinuation effects. In this article, the last of a four-part series, the discontinuation effects of the following psychotropic drugs are described: benzodiazepine drugs (which have hypnotic, anti-anxiety, and anticonvulsant effects), non-benzodiazepine drugs (used for insomnia), glutamate-modulating drugs, opioid receptor agonist drugs (used as analgesics for the treatment of various pain conditions), and stimulant drugs. Serious adverse effects are likely to occur only after abrupt discontinuation of benzodiazepine drugs, and they should almost always be tapered. Prominent discontinuation effects are seen with opioid and stimulant drugs, but these are usually not serious. Tapering medication, rather than abruptly stopping them, can avoid or minimize the potential adverse discontinuation effects associated with most psychotropic drugs.",

In addition to adequate supportive care, benzodiazepines administered in a symptom-triggered fashion, guided by the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol scale, revised (CIWA-Ar), still seem to be the optimal strategy in the intensive care unit. In cases of benzodiazepine resistance, numerous options are available, including high individual doses of benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and propofol.

The aim of this study was to determine the importance of inhibitory metabolites of itraconazole (ITZ) in in vivo cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibition. The pharmacokinetics of ITZ and midazolam (MDZ) were determined in six healthy volunteers in four sessions after administration of MDZ with and without oral ITZ. After doses of 50, 200, and 400 mg of ITZ, the clearance of orally administered MDZ decreased by 27, 74, and 83%, respectively. The in vivo half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) for ITZ ranged from 5 to 132 nmol/l in the six subjects. The metabolites of ITZ were estimated to account for ~50% of the total CYP3A4 inhibition, with the relative contribution increasing with time after ITZ dosing. Of the total of 18 interactions observed, 15 (84%) could be predicted within a twofold error margin, with improved accuracy observed when ITZ metabolites were included in the predictions. This study shows that the metabolites of ITZ contribute to CYP3A4 inhibition and need to be accounted for in quantitative rationalization of ITZ-mediated DDIs.",

Patients who received adequate first-line treatment were 6.8 times [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.8-16.9] more likely to have seizure termination, with 74% versus 29% efficacy rate (p < 0.0001). Inadequate initial management was 4.7 times (1.9-11.1) more likely to need several benzodiazepine doses (p = 0.0004) and 9.1 times (3.7-20) more likely to require a long-acting AED as next treatment (p < 0.0001). Seizure termination after initial treatment was associated with decreased intensive care unit stay [1 (1-2) versus 2 (1-5.5) days, p < 0.0001] and hospital stay [3 (2-11) versus 7 (3-18) days, p = 0.009].",

    "242": "Adenosine is an important autocoid, exerting its physiological effects on the human body by activation of four different G-protein-coupled-receptors (GPCRs) classified as A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3). These receptors are coupled to secondary messenger systems including adenylate cyclase, inositol phosphate metabolism, and K(+), K(ATP) and Ca(2+) channels. Pharmacological agents that increase the activation of A(1) adenosine receptors in response to adenosine would be useful for treatment of cardiovascular, central nervous system, and inflammatory pathologies. Compounds that are able to enhance the activity of the A(1)-adenosine receptors by the endogenous ligand within specific tissues may have potential therapeutic advantages over non-endogenous agonists. Such an opportunity for intervention is provided by the concept of allosteric modulation of GPCRs. Therefore the use of allosteric enhancers to increase the responsiveness of the A(1) receptors to endogenous adenosine at sites of its production is an appealing alternative to activation by exogenous agonists. This approach minimizes side effects because allosteric enhancers amplify the action of the agonist by stabilizing the agonist-A(1)-receptor-G protein ternary complex. The allosteric enhancement of the GABA(A) receptor by benzodiazepines is the most famous and successful example of this strategy. The aim of this article is to give an overview of the results obtained in this field and discuss the opportunities and challenges that this class of ligands might offer for medicinal chemistry and pharmacology.", 
    "243": "Justicia pectoralis (Acanthaceae) is used as an antiinflammatory, antimicrobial and bronchodilator, and its extract exerts an anxiolytic-like effect profile in animal models. This work presents the behavioral effects of an aqueous standardized extract of Justicia pectoralis (SEJP) in animal models, such as the elevated plus maze (EPM), light/dark, open field, rota rod and pentobarbital sleep time. The extract was administered intragastrically to male mice at single doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg, while diazepam 1 or 2 mg/kg was used as a standard drug and flumazenil 2.5 mg/kg was used to evaluate the participation of benzodiazepinic receptors. The results showed that, similar to diazepam (1 mg/kg), SEJP significantly modified all the observed parameters in the EPM test, without altering the general motor activity in the open field, rota rod and pentobarbital sleep time tests. Flumazenil reversed not only the diazepam effect but also the SEJP effect. In the same way, all doses of SEJP increased the time of permanence in the light box in the light/dark test. The results showed that SEJP presented an anxiolytic-like effect, disproving sedative effects.", 
    "244": "Olanzapine was formulated as 10% (w/w) mixture with cutina to which stearic acid was added, ranging from 10% to 90% (w/w) of the total mass to control the drug release. The molten mixtures were processed by ultrasound-assisted spray-congealing technique, obtaining solid microspheres. The drug is stable under these conditions and only a partial miscibility in the solid state was observed by DSC between the two fatty materials with two separated melting endotherms in the thermograms: this can be due to the presence of two phases inside the solid dispersion. Olanzapine is distributed into the two phases according to its partition coefficient: two phases make the system less suitable to crystallization of the drug; the loading of the drug could reach saturation with difficulty and the rate of the olanzapine release is differentiated, since the drug is released from two different carriers. Dissolution profiles suggest occurrence of a bimodal release, where each portion of the release profile is linear and the slope increases with a higher content of stearic acid in the carrier mixture, that behaves as a release promoter. Tests were also carried out with palmitic and lauric acids for comparison and also for systems in the absence of ultrasound."
