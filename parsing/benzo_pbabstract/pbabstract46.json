    "0": "Bipolar disorder is a chronic disease characterized by periods of mania or hypomania, depression, or a combination of both (mixed state). Because bipolar disorder is one of the leading causes of disability, it represents an important economic burden on society. Asenapine (ASE) is a new second-generation antipsychotic developed and approved for the treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder. The objective of the present study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of ASE compared to olanzapine (OLA) in the treatment of patients experiencing mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in the context of the Italian National Health Service (NHS).", 
    "1": "A pharmacoeconomic model was developed to simulate the management of Italian bipolar I patients with mixed episodes over a 5-year time horizon by combining clinical parameters with resource utilization. An expert panel of Italian psychiatrists and health economists was responsible for adapting a UK model to the Italian context. The primary outcome measure of the economic evaluation was the incremental cost effectiveness ratio, where effectiveness is measured in terms of quality adjusted life-years gained. Scenario analyses, sensitivity analyses, and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to test the robustness of the model.", 
    "2": "This pharmacoeconomic model showed that ASE resulted to be dominant over OLA; in fact, ASE was associated with lower direct costs (derived largely by the savings from hospitalizations avoided) and also generated a better quality of life. Results were robust to changes in key parameters; both scenario analyses and sensitivity analyses demonstrated model reliability.", 
    "3": "Results from this study suggest that the management of bipolar I patients with mixed episodes using ASE as alternative to OLA can lead to cost saving for the Italian NHS and improve patients quality of life.", 
    "4": "Surveillance studies are useful to evaluate how a new medicinal product performs in everyday treatment and how the patient who takes it feels and functions, thereby determining the benefit/risk ratio of the drug under real-life conditions. Prolonged-release melatonin (PRM; Circadin) was approved in Europe for the management of primary insomnia patients age 55 years or older suffering from poor quality of sleep. With traditional hypnotics (e.g. benzodiazepine-receptor agonists), there are concerns about rebound insomnia and/or withdrawal symptoms. We report data from a postmarketing surveillance study in Germany on the effects of 3 weeks of treatment with PRM on sleep in patients with insomnia during treatment and at early (1-2 days) and late (around 2 weeks) withdrawal. In total, 653 patients (597 evaluable) were recruited at 204 sites (mean age 62.7 years, 68% previously treated with hypnotics, 65% women). With PRM treatment, the mean sleep quality (on a scale of 1-5 on which 1 is very good and 5 is very bad) improved from 4.2 to 2.6 and morning alertness improved from 4.0 to 2.5. The improvements persisted over the post-treatment observation period. Rebound insomnia, defined as a one-point deterioration in sleep quality below baseline values, was found in 3.2% (early withdrawal) and 2.0% (late withdrawal). Most of the patients (77%) who used traditional hypnotics before PRM treatment had stopped using them and only 5.6% of naive patients started such drugs after PRM discontinuation. PRM was well tolerated during treatment and the most frequently reported adverse events were nausea (10 patients, 1.5%), dizziness, restlessness and headache (five patients each, <1%). There were no serious adverse events and no adverse events were reported after discontinuation. The persisting treatment effect and very low rebound rate suggest a beneficial role of sleep-wake cycle stabilization with PRM in the treatment of insomnia.", 
    "5": "Patients treated for chronic pain may frequently undergo urine drug testing to monitor medication compliance and detect undisclosed prescribed or illicit drug use. Due to the increasing use and abuse of benzodiazepines, this class of medications is often included in drug screening panels. However, immunoassay-based methods lack the requisite sensitivity for detecting benzodiazepine use in this population primarily due to their poor cross-reactivity with several major urinary benzodiazepine metabolites. A High Sensitivity Cloned Enzyme Donor Immunoassay (HS-CEDIA), in which beta-glucuronidase is added to the reagent, has been shown to perform better than traditional assays, but its performance in patients treated for chronic pain is not well characterized.",

    "9": "A total of 299 urine specimens from patients treated for chronic pain were screened for the presence of benzodiazepines using the HS-CEDIA, CEDIA, and KIMS assays. The sensitivity and specificity of the screening assays were determined using the LC-MS/MS results as the reference method.", 
    "10": "Of the 299 urine specimens tested, 141 (47%) confirmed positive for one or more of the benzodiazepines/metabolites by LC-MS/MS. All 3 screens were 100% specific with no false-positive results. The CEDIA and KIMS sensitivities were 55% (78/141) and 47% (66/141), respectively. Despite the relatively higher sensitivity of the HS-CEDIA screening assay (78%; 110/141), primarily due to increased detection of lorazepam, it still missed 22% (31/141) of benzodiazepine-positive urines. The KIMS, CEDIA, and HS-CEDIA assays yielded accuracies of 75%, 79%, and 90%, respectively, in comparison with LC-MS/MS.", 
    "11": "This study was limited by its single-site location and the modest size of the urine samples utilized.", 
    "12": "While the HS-CEDIA provides higher sensitivity than the KIMS and CEDIA assays, it still missed an unacceptably high percentage of benzodiazepine-positive samples from patients treated for chronic pain. LC-MS/MS quantification with enzymatic sample pretreatment offers superior sensitivity and specificity for monitoring benzodiazepines in patients treated for chronic pain.", 
    "13": "The presence of pharmaceutical products in the aquatic environment has been reported in several studies. However, the impact of these drugs on living organisms is still uncharacterized. Here, we investigated the effects of acute exposure to either diazepam or fluoxetine on the stress response in Danio rerio. We showed that diazepam and fluoxetine inhibited the stress axis in zebrafish. Intermediate concentrations of diazepam suppressed the stress response as measured by cortisol levels, whereas fluoxetine inhibited cortisol increase at concentrations similar to those found in the environment. These data suggest that the presence of psychoactive drugs in aquatic ecosystems could cause neuroendocrine dysfunction in fish.",

    "15": "In this cross-sectional study, 1,260 students volunteered (311 males and 949 females) with mean age of 21.35 years. Data were collected by a self-administrated questionnaire regarding drugs abuse and demographic information.", 
    "16": "Benzodiazepines were the most common abused drugs which were reported in 94 students (7.4%). Other agents studied were cigarette and tobacco (159, cases 12.6%), alcoholic drinks (60 cases, 4.7%), and opiates (42 cases, 3.3%). Forty-three students (3.4%) had used methylphenidate in the last 6 months. Of this, 39 (90.6%) experienced insomnia. All students who abused methylphenidate indicated that the reason for this behavior was to raise alertness and conscious levels.", 
    "17": "The pattern of drug abuse among the students here seems similar to other reports from Iranian universities.", 
    "18": "Vibratory angioedema is a rare form of physical urticaria, hereditary or acquired, which occurs at body sites exposed to vibrations. Pathogenic mechanisms of disease are not completely clear and, consequently, current pharmacological treatment is sometimes unsatisfactory. We report the case of a horn player affected by acquired vibratory angioedema, relapsing after prolonged use of the instrument and resistant to systemic antihistamines and corticosteroids, which successfully responded to therapy with low doses of amitriptyline and bromazepam. A neuroinflammatory mechanism can be likely implicated in the pathogenesis of vibratory angioedema, in line with many different cutaneous/mucosal diseases involving a complex interplay of homeostatic/allostatic systems. Furthermore, in mucosal diseases, such as vibratory angioedema, physical/psychological stressors have a relevant role. In such cases, because of the complex interplay between nervous and immune system, the pharmacological activity of benzodiazepines and typical antidepressants may downregulate neuroinflammation.", 
    "19": "The efficacy and effectiveness of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) in the medical management of opioid addiction has been well-established, but treatment outcomes are compromised by the continued use of licit and illicit drugs during MMT. The present study examined the relationship between in-treatment illicit drug use and retention and dropout of 604 MMT patients in Washington, D.C. Sixty-eight percent of patients did not test positive for an unprescribed drug during the study period. Of patients who tested positive for an illicit drug during the baseline period, 55% tested positive for cocaine, 44% for opiates, 23% for THC, 20% for benzodiazepines, 7% for PCP, and 4% for amphetamines. Those testing positive were three times more likely to leave treatment than those who did not test positive. Testing positive for one drug doubled the rate of attrition; testing positive for multiple drugs quadrupled the risk of attrition. Non-prescribed opioid or benzodiazepine use was a predictor of MMT dropout, but prescribed opioid or benzodiazepine use was not. Continued illicit drug use poses significant risk for subsequent premature termination of MMT. Assertive clinical management of continued illicit drug use could provide mechanisms to enhance MMT retention and long-term recovery outcomes.",

In a clinical study in children where clobazam was administered alone and co-administered with stiripentol, the predicted and observed minimum concentration at steady state (mean and 95% confidence interval) during clobazam monotherapy were 0.19 (0.05-0.49\u00a0mg/L) and 0.20 (0.17-0.23\u00a0mg/L), respectively, and predicted and observed norclobazam concentrations were 0.49 (0.16-1.38\u00a0mg/L) and 0.95 (0.91-0.99\u00a0mg/L), respectively. From an interaction study with stiripentol the predicted stiripentol concentration was 10.12 (2.51-39.36\u00a0mg/L) and the observed concentration was 10.0 (8.3-11.7\u00a0mg/L); the predicted clobazam concentration was 0.29 (0.07-1.05\u00a0mg/L) and the observed concentration was 0.31 (0.24-0.38\u00a0mg/L); and the predicted norclobazam concentration was 2.30 (0.45-5.53\u00a0mg/L) and the observed concentration was 4.32 (3.77-4.87\u00a0mg/L).",

    "24": "Sedation agents affect brain hemodynamic and metabolism leading to specific modifications of the cerebral blood oxygenation level. We previously demonstrated that ultra-high field (UHF) MRI detects changes in cortical blood oxygenation following the administration of sedation drugs commonly used in animal research. Here we applied the UHF-MRI method to study clinically relevant sedation drugs for their effects on cortical and subcortical (thalamus, striatum) oxygenation levels.", 
    "25": "We acquired T2*-weighted images of Sprague-Dawley rat brains at 17.2T in vivo. During each MRI session, rats were first anesthetized with isoflurane, then with a second sedative agent (sevoflurane, propofol, midazolam, medetomidine or ketamine-xylazine) after stopping isoflurane. We computed a T2*-oxygenation-ratio that aimed at estimating cerebral blood oxygenation level for each sedative agent in each region of interest: cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and striatum.", 
    "26": "The T2*-oxygenation-ratio was consistent across scan sessions. This ratio was higher with inhalational agents than with intravenous agents. Under sevoflurane and medetomidine, T2*-oxygenation-ratio was homogenous across the brain regions. Intravenous agents (except medetomidine) induced a T2*-oxygenation-ratio imbalance between cortex and subcortical regions: T2*-oxygenation-ratio was higher in the cortex than the subcortical areas under ketamine-xylazine; T2*-oxygenation-ratio was higher in subcortical regions than in the cortex under propofol or midazolam.",

Seven short-term studies compared benzodiazepines with placebo: benzodiazepine superiority was found in two out of five studies for global improvements and two out of four studies for psychiatric/behavioural outcomes. Eleven studies compared benzodiazepines with first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs): four out of nine studies (including two long-term studies) reported greater global improvements for antipsychotics; four out of five studies showed no treatment differences for psychiatric/behavioural outcomes. Fourteen studies compared benzodiazepines (as adjunct to antipsychotics) vs antipsychotics alone (mostly FGAs); benzodiazepine superiority was found for global improvement in one out of eight studies and inferiority in two out of eight short-term studies whereas superiority was found for psychiatric/behavioural outcomes in three out of 12 short-term studies and inferiority in three out of 12 studies.", 
    "31": "Benzodiazepine superiority over placebo was found for global, psychiatric and behavioural outcomes, but inferiority to antipsychotics on longer-term global outcomes. Conflicting evidence exists regarding the addition of benzodiazepines to antipsychotics; thus the use of benzodiazepines in clinical practice and antipsychotic trials should be limited.", 
    "32": "Psychiatric disorders are equally common during pregnancy as among non-pregnant women, and many of these conditions are treated with psychotropic medicines. Relatively little is known about patterns of use of many these agents during pregnancy, and specifically of how rates may have shifted during the last decade.

This rate varied from 6% to 15% between states. The rate of use of psychotropic medicines was relatively stable between 2006 and 2011. The most commonly used psychotropic medicines were selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (5.1%) and benzodiazepine or benzodiazepine-like medicines (3.9%). Among psychotropic users, the most commonly associated psychiatric diagnosis was depression (25.0%), followed by anxiety disorders (24.4%). Approximately 1.6% of women used more than one category of psychotropic medicine in pregnancy, most commonly an antidepressant and an anxiolytic medicine (1.2%).", 
    "35": "Given this relatively high rate of use, the lack of evidence that the most frequently used medications improve birth outcomes and the safety concerns associated with both early and late pregnancy use for many frequently-used medications, there is a need for further study of factors driving psychotropic medication use during pregnancy.",

Among the inducers, patients using PHT had a significantly lower CD ratio than patients using PB or CBZ (p\u2009<\u20090.001). When PHT was combined with CBZ and/or PB, no additive or synergetic interactions was observed. The CD ratio of CLB in pediatric patients using inducers was 44.3% lower than in patients without inducers. The influence of inducers was unchanged regardless of the child's age, and the effect was stronger in adults than in pediatric patients. Other than inducers, valproic acid (VPA) additively reduced the CD ratio, whereas concomitant use of stiripentol significantly elevated the CD ratio in patients receiving VPA. In contrast, CYP3A4 substrates, such as zonisamide and topiramate, had little influence on the CD ratio of CLB.",

There was an overall complication rate of 68.3%. 35 (58.3%) patients presented euphoria as the most common complication, but there was no statistical difference between the two groups (P = 0.396). Cases who received IV midazolam became sedated faster than those received IM midazolam (P > 0.001). The vital signs including heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure and O 2 saturation changed significantly between and within groups during the sedation (P < 0.05).", 
    "43": "Both forms of midazolam, IM and IV, are effective and safe for paediatric sedation in ED. Although the sedative with IV form might appear sooner, IM form of midazolam can be effectively used in patient with limited IV access.

The tests performed more accurately in drug negative samples (specificity 96%) but less accurately for detecting positives (sensitivity 79%). Of all incorrect results by the on-site test the proportion of false negatives was 42%. The overall agreement between on-site and laboratory testing was 95% in the laboratory study and 98% in the clinical study.", 
    "52": "Although a high degree of agreement was observed between on-site and routine laboratory urine drug testing, the performance of on-site testing was not acceptable due to significant number of false negative results.

To identify and compare the characteristics of adult patients presenting to the three EDs of Monash Health following DSP. Methods. Retrospective clinical audit of adult DSP attendances between 1st July 2009 and 30th June 2012. Results. A total of 3558 cases over three years were identified fulfilling the search criteria. The mean age of patients was 36.3 years with the largest numbers aged between 18 and 30 (38%). About 30% of patients were born overseas. Forty-eight percent were discharged home, 15% were admitted to ED short stay units, and 5% required ICU admission. The median ED length of stay was 359 minutes (IQR 231-607). The most frequently reported substances in DSP were benzodiazepines (36.6%), paracetamol (22.2%), and antipsychotics (12.1%). Exposure to more than one substance for the episode of DSP was common (47%). Conclusion. This information may help identify the trends in poisoning substances used for DSP in Victoria, which in turn may provide clinicians with information to provide more focused and targeted interventions.", 
    "58": "Tardive syndromes associated with dopamine-receptor blocking agents have heterogeneous appearance. The treatment of tardive dyskinesia, dystonia, myoclonus, tourettism, tremor and akathisia is challenging for both psychiatrists and neurologists. Lack of randomized and controlled examinations for many routinely applied clinical therapeutic options make the development of clinical guidelines difficult. The present review article summarizes the available evidence for the treatment of tardive syndromes. According to the treatment guideline published by the American Academy of Neurology in 2013, the usage of clonazepam, ginkgo biloba, amantadine and tetrabenazine has enough evidence to draw conclusions. Although lowering or stopping the eliciting agent, changing to atypical antipsychotics, and adding anticholinergics are widely used techniques, there are no convincing controlled studies available to support their efficacy. The usage of Vitamin E, levetiracetam, propranolol, botulinum toxin and deep brain stimulation may be promising treatment options in the future.",

After endotracheal intubation, anaesthesia was maintained with sufentanil-midazolam (n = 9) or sevoflurane (n = 9). Ovariohysterectomy was performed. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation was performed as required. Physiological variables were studied perioperatively. Group means of physiologic data were generated for different anaesthetic periods. Data were compared for changes from sedation, and between groups by anova.

    "76": "NR1 knockdown (NR1KD) mice are genetically modified to express low levels of the NR1 subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and show deficits in affiliative social behaviour. In this study, we determined which brain regions were selectively activated in response to social stimulation and asked whether differences in neuronal activation could be observed in mice with reduced sociability. Furthermore, we aimed to determine whether brain activation patterns correlated with the amelioration of social deficits through pharmacological intervention. The cingulate cortex, lateral septal nuclei, hypothalamus, thalamus and amygdala showed an increase in c-Fos immunoreactivity that was selective for exposure to social stimuli. NR1KD mice displayed a reduction in social behaviour and a reduction in c-Fos immunoreactivity in the cingulate cortex and septal nuclei. Acute clozapine did not significantly alter sociability; however, diazepam treatment did increase sociability and neuronal activation in the lateral septal region. This study has identified the lateral septal region as a neural substrate of social behaviour and the GABA system as a potential therapeutic target for social dysfunction.", 
    "77": "Anxiety caused by the novelty of food or of the environment where the food is presented leads to suppression of consumption (hyponeophagia) reflected by an increased latency to begin feeding and decreased food intake. Studies suggest that some anxiolytics, mainly benzodiazepines and SSRIs, resolve hyponeophagia. Though the neurohormone oxytocin (OT) affects both anxiety responsiveness and feeding-related homeostasis, the link between OT and hyponeophagia has not been established. The current experiments examined the effect of OT receptor stimulation on hyponeophagia in mice and associated changes in brain activity. We found that the OT receptor agonist, WAY-267,464, at 10 and 30 mg/kg b. wt. IP, reduced the latency to approach food and increased the amount of food eaten in hyponeophagia tests differing in animals' motivation to eat (hunger, reward) and the anxiogenic context of environmental novelty (illumination and type of the cage). This effect was abolished by the pretreatment with the OT receptor antagonist, L-368,899, at 10mg/kg b. wt. The antagonist also suppressed social transmission of preference for novel food. Mice subjected to novelty conditions causing hypophagia showed significant changes in c-Fos immunoreactivity in the hippocampus, lateral septum, cingulate and piriform cortex and in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, lateral division, posterolateral part (STLP). The pretreatment with WAY-267,464 restored c-Fos levels in the STLP to values detected in control animals subjected to non-anxiogenic conditions. We conclude that OT plays a role in shaping the magnitude of the novelty stress-provoked hypophagia and the activity of the relevant neural networks.", 
    "78": "We previously identified a group of subjects with schizophrenia who, on average, have a 75% decrease in cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 1 (CHRM1) in Brodmann's area (BA) 9. To extend this finding, we determined i) if the decrease in CHRM1 was present in another functionally related CNS region (BA6), ii) whether the marked decrease in CHRM1 was accompanied by changes in levels of other CHRMs and iii) potential factors responsible for the decreased CHRM1 expression. We measured CHRM1 and CHRM3 using in situ radioligand binding with [(3)H]pirenzepine and [(3)H]4-DAMP respectively in BA6 from 20 subjects with schizophrenia who had low levels of CHRM1 in BA9 (SzLow[(3)H]PZP), 18 subjects with schizophrenia whose levels of CHRM1 were similar to controls (SzNormal[(3)H]PZP) and 20 control subjects. Levels of CHRM1, 3 and 4 mRNA were measured using qPCR and levels of the transcription factors, SP1 and SP3, were determined using Western blots. In BA6, the density of [(3)H]pirenzepine binding was decreased in subjects with SzLow[(3)H]PZP (p<0.001) compared to controls. The density of [(3)H]4-DAMP binding, levels of CHRM1, 3 and 4 mRNA and levels of SP1 and SP3 was not significantly different between the three groups. This study shows that the previously identified decrease in CHRM1 expression is not confined to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex but is present in other cortical areas. The effect shows some specificity to CHRM1, with no change in levels of binding to CHRM3. Furthermore, this decrease in CHRM1 does not appear to be associated with low levels of CHRM1 mRNA or to simply be regulated by the transcription factors, SP1 and SP3, suggesting that other mechanisms are responsible for the decreased CHRM1 in these subjects.", 
    "79": "Olanzapine induced a marked elevation in triglyceride and cholesterol levels and in liver transaminase enzymes after 12 weeks of treatment in a patient with schizophrenia. These changes were not seen in an earlier 10-week course of treatment with risperidone, and improved substantially 1 week after the patient stopped olanzapine and began treatment with aripiprazole. The patient did not exhibit weight gain or hyperglycemia with any of the medications. This case and a review of the literature suggest that olanzapine may have unique properties that affect hepatic enzyme pathways, independent of any effects on weight and glucose, that may lead to hyperlipidemia and transaminitis in some patients.", 
    "80": "Gamma butyrolactone (GBL) is an increasingly popular drug of abuse that is readily available in most countries, and it is often purchased over the Internet. In addition to the acute hazards of intoxication and overdose, users who are dependent on GBL can also experience severe withdrawal reactions, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion, delusions, delirium, rhabdomyolysis, and seizures. Most of the existing literature suggests the use of a high-dose benzodiazepine as a first-line treatment for GBL withdrawal. However, several cases of resistance to benzodiazepines have been observed, which likely reflect some pharmacological differences between benzodiazepines and GBL. Specifically, the effects of benzodiazepines are primarily mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptors, while GBL and its analogues act mainly at GABA-B receptors, with possible additional effects via the ionotropic GABA-A receptors. In this regard, recent studies have found that GBL and its analogues possess a high affinity for a specific form of extrasynaptic GABA-A receptors that are strongly activated by barbiturates, such as phenobarbital, but that are insensitive to benzodiazepines. Taken together, these findings suggest that barbiturates could be evaluated as first-choice agents for the treatment of GBL/gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) withdrawal instead of benzodiazepines. In support of this view, we describe a clinical case of difficult to manage GBL withdrawal symptoms in a 42-year-old male. We also review the literature on treatment options for GBL/GHB withdrawal, including benzodiazepine-resistant withdrawal.",

    "86": "Neuroblastomas (NBs) are a clinically heterogeneous group of extra cranial pediatric tumors. Patients with high-risk, metastatic NBs have a long-term survival rate of below 40%, and are often resistant to current therapeutic modalities. Due to toxic side effects associated with radiation and chemotherapies, development of new agents is warranted to overcome resistance and effectively treat this disease in clinic. CARP-1 functional mimetics (CFMs) are an emerging class of small molecule compounds that inhibit growth of diverse cancer cell types. Here we investigated NB inhibitory potential of CFMs and the molecular mechanisms involved. CFM-1, -4, and -5 inhibited NB cell growth, in vitro, independent of their p53 and MYCN status. CFM-4 and -5 induced apoptosis in NB cells in part by activating pro-apoptotic stress-activated kinases (SAPKs) p38 and JNK, stimulating CARP-1 expression and cleavage of PARP1, while promoting loss of the oncogenes C and N-myc as well as mitotic cyclin B1. Treatments of NB cells with CFM-4 or -5 also resulted in loss of Inhibitory \u03baB (I\u03baB) \u03b1 and \u03b2 proteins. Micro-RNA profiling revealed upregulation of XIAP-targeting miR513a-3p in CFM-4-treated NB, mesothelioma, and breast cancer cells. Moreover, exposure of NB and breast cancer cells to CFM-4 or -5 resulted in diminished expression of anti-apoptotic XIAP1, cIAP1, and Survivin proteins. Expression of anti-miR513a-5p or miR513a-5p mimic, however, interfered with or enhanced, respectively, the breast cancer cell growth inhibition by CFM-4. CFMs also impacted biological properties of the NB cells by blocking their abilities to migrate, form colonies in suspension, and invade through the matrix-coated membranes. Our studies indicate anti-NB properties of CFM-4 and 5, and suggest that these CFMs and/or their future analogs have potential as anti-NB agents.", 
    "87": "Alprazolam, a widely used drug, has widespread, nonspecific depressant effects on the central nervous system, similar to other benzodiazepines. This inhibitor effect may cause changes in reflex thresholds by affecting the acoustic stapedial reflex (ASR) arc. This study was performed on 31 healthy volunteers. Initially, the basal ASR thresholds were measured and measured again 2\u00a0h after oral intake of 1\u00a0mg of alprazolam; by measuring the reflex thresholds once again the mean values of thresholds before and after the drug were compared. Only the left ipsilateral and contralateral 2,000\u00a0Hz increases were significantly different. The left ipsilateral and contralateral 500, 1000, and 4000\u00a0Hz, and the right ipsilateral and contralateral 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000\u00a0Hz measurements showed no differences. Although an increase in ART thresholds was generally observed after the intake of alprazolam, it was not significant. Its use in healthy adults does not statistically produce an additional risk of acoustic trauma at most of the frequencies, but its use with the agents potentiating the effect of alprazolam may increase this risk.",

In 2010, the World Health Organization estimated there was a 93% reduction in newborns dying from tetanus worldwide, compared to the situation in the late 1980s. Due to its rarity, many diagnostic delays occur as physicians may not consider the diagnosis until the manifestations become overt. Without timely diagnosis and proper treatment, severe tetanus is fatal (mortality is also influenced by the comorbidities of the patient). The principles of treating tetanus are: reducing muscle spasms, rigidity and autonomic instability (with ventilatory support when necessary); neutralization of tetanus toxin with human antitetanus immunoglobulin or equine antitetanus sera; wound debridement; and administration of antibiotics to eradicate locally proliferating bacteria at the wound site. It is difficult to conduct trials on different treatment modalities in tetanus due to both logistical and ethical reasons. However, it is imperative that physicians are aware of the best evidence-based treatment strategies currently available to improve the outcome of patients.

However, determining the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with milk thistle products has been complicated by inconsistencies between in vitro and in vivo study results. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of a standardized milk thistle supplement on major P450 drug-metabolizing enzymes after a 14-day exposure period. CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 activities were measured by simultaneously administering the four probe drugs, caffeine, tolbutamide, dextromethorphan, and midazolam, to nine healthy volunteers before and after exposure to a standardized milk thistle extract given thrice daily for 14 days. The three most abundant falvonolignans found in plasma, following exposure to milk thistle extracts, were silybin A, silybin B, and isosilybin B. The concentrations of these three major constituents were individually measured in study subjects as potential perpetrators.

A placebo-controlled multi-step infusion of one of three sedatives, propofol or midazolam, both GABA-A agonists, or dexmedetedomidine, an \u03b12-adrenergic agonist, was adopted to compare the effects of these three drugs in exactly the same experimental conditions. 60 healthy human volunteers, randomly divided in 4 groups, participated in the study. Each infusion step, delivered by a computer-controlled infusion pump, lasted 20min. During the last 10min of each step, the subject executed a saccadic task. Target concentration was doubled at each step. This block was repeated until the subject was too sedated to continue or for a maximum of 6 blocks. Subjects were unaware which infusion they were receiving. A video eye tracker was used to record the movements of the right eye. Saccadic parameters were modeled as a function of block number, estimated sedative plasma concentration, and subjective evaluation of sedation. Propofol and midazolam had strong effects on the dynamics and latency of the saccades. Midazolam, and to a less extent, propofol, caused saccades to become increasingly hypometric. Dexmedetedomidine had less impact on saccadic metrics and presented no changes in saccadic gain. Suppression of the sympathetic system associated with dexmedetomidine has different effects on eye movements from the increased activity of the inhibitory GABA-A receptors by propofol and midazolam even when the subjects reported similar sedation level.", 
    "130": "The essential oil of Myrtus communis L. (Myrtaceae) and its compounds have been popularly used in numerous health disorders, including insomnia and nervous conditions, but their effects on central nervous system (CNS) have not been explored yet. We evaluated the anxiolytic-like effects and possible action mechanism of (-)-myrtenol (MYR), a monoterpenoid alcohol present in essential oil of M. communis L. Animal models of elevated plus maze (EPM), light-dark transition (LDT), open field and rotarod tests were used in the present study. MYR was administered in male rats. Diazepam was used as the standard drug (positive control) and flumazenil was used to elucidate the possible action mechanism. The results showed that none of the doses of MYR had effect on the resistance time in rotating bar, but caused reduction in the number of falls in rotarod tests when compared with a negative control. Similarly, MYR had no effect on the number of crossings, groomings or rearings in open field tests when compared with a negative control. However, in EPM and LDT tests, MYR significantly increased (p<0.001) the number of entries in open arms (F7,49=9.867), the time spent in open arms (F7,49=53.97) and the time spent in light compartment (F7,56=27.38), when compared with negative and positive controls, respectively. Flumazenil was able to reverse the effects of diazepam and MYR. These results suggest that MYR presents anxiolytic-like activity and that effect can be mediated by GABAergic transmission.",

    "132": "Mood disorder patients that are on long-term atypical antipsychotics treatment frequently experience metabolic dysfunctions. In addition to this, accumulating evidences points to increased risk of structural abnormalities, brain volume changes, altered neuroplasticity and behavioral depression with long-term antipsychotics use. However, there is paucity of preclinical evidences for long-term antipsychotic associated depression-like behavior. The objectives of the present study were: (1) to evaluate influence of long-term antipsychotic (olanzapine) treatment on rat behavior in forced swim test (FST) as a model for depression and; (2) to examine impact of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist liraglutide - an antidiabetic medication for type II diabetes, on long-term olanzapine associated metabolic and behavioral changes in rats. Daily olanzapine treatment (0.5 mg/kg; p.o.) for 8-9 weeks significantly increased body weights, food and water intake, plasma cholesterol and triglycerides and immobility time in FST with parallel reduction in plasma HDL cholesterol levels. These results points to development of metabolic abnormalities and depression-like behavior with long-term olanzapine treatment. Acute liraglutide (50 \u03bcg/kg; i.p.) and imipramine (10 mg/kg, i. p.) treatment per se significantly decreased duration of immobility in FST compared to vehicle treated rats. Additionally, 3-week liraglutide treatment (50 \u03bcg/kg; i.p., daily) partially reversed metabolic abnormalities and depression-like behavior with long-term olanzapine-treatment in rats. None of these treatment regimens affected locomotor behavior of rats. In summary, add-on GLP-1 receptor agonists promise novel alternatives to counteract long-term antipsychotics associated behavioral and metabolic complications.",

It aimed at characterizing the patients' basic demographic and clinical parameters and evaluating their overall quality of life (QoL) prepartum and postpartum. Three hundred ninety women were treated between 1994 and 2009 with buprenorphine (n = 77), methadone (n = 184), or slow-release oral morphine (SROM) (n = 129) on an outpatient basis throughout their pregnancy and postpartum period. All patients were subject to standardized prepartum and postpartum medical and psychiatric assessments, including QoL assessments using a German adaptation of the Lancashire QoL Profile (Berliner Lebensqualitaetsprofil), and regular supervised urine toxicologies. No medication group differences were revealed regarding basic demographic or clinical data. Mean maintenance doses (SD) at time of delivery were as follows: 64 mg (36 mg) methadone, 10 mg (6 mg) buprenorphine, 455 mg (207 mg) SROM. However, buprenorphine-medicated women showed significantly less concomitant benzodiazepine consumption than methadone- or SROM-maintained women (p = 0.005), and significantly less concomitant opioid consumption than methadone-maintained women (p = 0.033) during the last trimester. Overall QoL was good prepartum and postpartum in all measured domains except \"finances\" and \"prospect of staying in the same housing situation,\" and no differences were observed in QoL among the three medication groups (p = 0.177). QoL improved significantly after delivery in most of the domains (p < 0.001). Although opioid-dependent pregnant women face high-risk pregnancies and show variability in addiction severity, they report good QoL independent of the medication administered. These results show that individually tailored treatment interventions are effective for this patient population and suggest a QoL improvement after delivery.",

    "140": "The GABAA receptors (GABAARs) play an important role in inhibitory transmission in the brain. The GABAARs could be identified using a medicinal chemistry approach to characterize with a series of chemical structural analogues, some identified in nature, some synthesized, to control the structural conformational rigidity/flexibility so as to define the 'receptor-specific' GABA agonist ligand structure. In addition to the isosteric site ligands, these ligand-gated chloride ion channel proteins exhibited modulation by several chemotypes of allosteric ligands, that help define structure and function. The channel blocker picrotoxin identified a noncompetitive channel blocker site in GABAARs. This ligand site is located in the transmembrane channel pore, whereas the GABA agonist site is in the extracellular domain at subunit interfaces, a site useful for low energy coupled conformational changes of the functional channel domain. Also in the trans-membrane domain are allosteric modulatory ligand sites, mostly positive, for diverse chemotypes with general anesthetic efficacy, namely, the volatile and intravenous agents: barbiturates, etomidate, propofol, long-chain alcohols, and neurosteroids. The last are apparent endogenous positive allosteric modulators of GABAARs. These binding sites depend on the GABAAR heteropentameric subunit composition, i.e., subtypes. Two classes of pharmacologically very important allosteric modulatory ligand binding site reside in the extracellular domain at modified agonist sites at other subunit interfaces: the benzodiazepine site, and the low-dose ethanol site. The benzodiazepine site is specific for certain subunit combination subtypes, mainly synaptically localized. In contrast, the low-dose (high affinity) ethanol site(s) is found at a modified benzodiazepine site on different, extrasynaptic, subtypes.",

Seven aardvarks weighing 33-45 kg were immobilized to perform surgical implantation of temperature loggers using 3.8 mg/kg ketamine, 0.1 mg/kg medetomidine, and 0.25 mg/kg midazolam. Immobilized aardvarks were transported to a surgical theater and received 0.5-1% isoflurane in oxygen after tracheal intubation. After surgery, medetomidine was antagonized with 0.5 mg/kg atipamezole, and aardvarks were released at the site of capture. We recorded induction and recovery times, clinical and physiologic parameters, and conducted blood gas analyses before and during isoflurane administration. Aardvarks showed initial effects within 3 min and reached lateral recumbency within 7 min after drug administration. Heart rate (50-67 beats/min), respiratory rate (10-15 breaths/min), oxygen hemoglobin saturation (SaO2; 90-97%), and rectal temperature (34.0-37.5 C) were within acceptable physiologic ranges. Mean arterial blood pressure was initially high (146 \u00b1 12 mmHg), but the hypertension resolved over time. Rectal temperature dropped significantly during anesthesia. Four animals had to be treated to relieve apnea. Blood gas analyses revealed mild to moderate hypercapnia but no hypoxaemia. The ketamine-medetomidine-midazolam combination provided effective immobilization. Combined with a low concentration of isoflurane, it can be used for prolonged surgical procedures in wild aardvarks.

It occurs approximately seven times more frequently in women, mostly in perimenopausal age. The psychiatric aspect of BMS is significant: the most frequent co-morbidities are depression and anxiety disorders, and a number of psychotropic drugs play an essential role in its treatment. In the present review, the most important pathogenic and treatment concepts of BMS have been discussed. The BMS may be similar to neuropathic pain and has some related pathogenic elements with fibromyalgia and the restless leg syndrome. In primary BMS, the features of presynaptic dysfunction of dopaminergic neurons and deficiency of endogenous dopamine levels have been demonstrated. Other neurotransmitters such as serotonin, noradrenaline, histamine as well as hormonal and inflammatory factors may also play a role in the pathogenesis of BMS. In the pharmacological treatment of BMS a variety of drugs have been used including benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, antidepressants and atypical antipsychotic drugs. In the final part of the paper, the possibility of using atypical antipsychotic drug, olanzapine, in the treatment of BMS has been discussed. In the context of the recent studies on this topic, a case of female patient with the BMS lasting more than ten years has been mentioned, in whom the treatment with olanzapine brought about a rapid and significant reduction of symptoms. The probable mechanism of the therapeutic effect of olanzapine in BMS can include its effect on dopaminergic receptors and probably also on histaminergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic ones.",

To improve the predictability of human hepatic clearance, we focused on CYP3A4, which is involved in the metabolism of more than 50% of all currently marketed drugs. In this study, we investigated the validity of the in vivo model using transgenic mice carrying the human CYP3A4 gene and lacking their own Cyp3a genes (CYP3A4-Tg mice). The CYP3A4 activity toward its substrates in liver microsomes was similar in CYP3A4-Tg mice and humans. As for the clearance, six CYP3A4 substrates (alprazolam, felodipine, midazolam, nifedipine, nitrendipine, and quinidine) were given intravenously to CYP3A4-Tg mice, and their hepatic intrinsic clearance (CLint,h) was evaluated. A regression analysis of the data obtained indicated that the CLint,h values of six substrates in CYP3A4-Tg mice were highly correlated with those in humans (R(2) = 0.95). This correlation could be improved by correcting the CLint,h values by the relative contribution of artificially expressed CYP3A4 to the overall metabolism in the mice. From these findings, it is reasonable to expect that the CLint,h of a particular drug in humans is predictable by applying the CLint,h obtained in CYP3A4-Tg mice to a regression line prepared in advance. The variance of the CLint,h prediction by this method was evaluated and found to be within a range of 2-fold of the regression value. These results suggest that the CYP3A4-Tg mouse model has the potential to accurately predict the human hepatic clearance of CYP3A4 substrates.",

Participants were exposed to a variety of traumas, ranging from assault, traffic accidents and work accidents to cardiac surgery and septic shock. Seven studies were conducted at single centres. The seven RCTs included four hydrocortisone studies, three propranolol studies (of which one study had a third arm investigating gabapentin), and single trials of escitalopram and temazepam. Outcome assessment measures included the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D).In four trials with 165 participants there was moderate quality evidence for the efficacy of hydrocortisone in preventing the onset of PTSD (risk ratio (RR) 0.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.56; P value = 0.004), indicating that between seven and 13 patients would need to be treated with this agent in order to prevent the onset of PTSD in one patient.

Drop-outs due to treatment-emergent side effects, where reported, were low for all of the agents tested. Three of the four RCTs of hydrocortisone reported that medication was more effective than placebo in reducing PTSD symptoms after a median of 4.5 months after the event. None of the single trials of escitalopram, temazepam and gabapentin demonstrated evidence that medication was superior to placebo in preventing the onset of PTSD.Seven of the included RCTs were at a high risk of bias.

The LAI ensure a better bioavailability, more predictable correlation between drug dose and plasma concentrations, a better pharmacokinetic profile allowing the prescription of lower doses and less risk of side effects. First generation antipsychotic LAI (FGA-LAI) share with their equivalent oral compounds an increased susceptibility to induce extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia, with minor differences between the compounds. The second-generation LAI (SGA-LAI), as their oral formulations, compared to first generation antipsychotics, have the advantage of not causing movement disorders, but their use is complicated by the delayed release (risperidone) and the risk of the syndrome post-injection (olanzapine) and the high cost (paliperidone).", 
    "206": "Despite identified advantages, LAIs are not used as widely as might be expected. It would seem that clinicians are at least partly responsible for this, influenced by our own misperceptions (e.g., that LAIs are not acceptable to patients) and misinformation (e.g., increate side effect risk). Current guidelines on the treatment of schizophrenia recommend the use of LAI in patients who have demonstrated non-adherence or recurrent relapses related to poor or no adherence and underline the importance of patient preference. The prescription of LAI will increase in coming years as more number of LAI will be available and the increasing use of compulsory community treatment may contribute to this.",

However, the relation of these symptoms to an individual's stress sensitivity is not well understood. On the other hand, expression of the translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO), formerly known as the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, has been used as a biological marker of trait anxiety and stress sensitivity. The present study was designed to address this issue by examining TSPO in patients with AD. Fifty-two patients with AD (30 male and 22 female) and 163 healthy volunteers (89 male and 74 female) participated in this study. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores were significantly higher in patients with AD, especially male patients, than in healthy subjects. The expression of platelet TSPO, as determined with a binding assay with [(3)H] PK11195, was also significantly higher in patients with AD, indicating that AD is a stress-responsive disease. In genomic analysis using lymphocytes, a single-nucleotide polymorphism of the human TSPO gene at exon 4 (485G>A), which is presumably associated with an individual's stress sensitivity, showed significantly lower frequencies of G/G and higher frequencies of G/A in patients with AD than in healthy subjects. The severity of AD, as determined with the Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis index, was correlated with TSPO expression in male patients with the G/A phenotype. In conclusion, the present study provides new evidence that variation in the TSPO gene affects susceptibility to AD.",

The competition was especially designed to simulate competition environment by having archers shooting in doubles each time, on a specifically designed platforms. One platform was mounted on two force plates, where all the data related to shooting and body swaying was collected. The second platform was a dummy platform, to provide the second subject with similar feelings as the subject on the first platform. With this set of data collection, the archers were asked to compete 6 times each in changing rounds, where they had 24 shots in each competition. Repeated measure of ANOVA was used to compare the differences between control, placebo and benzodiazepine shots.",

    "214": "On average 24 per 1000 people aged 65+ in New Zealand were dispensed an antipsychotic in any given quarter. Benzodiazepine dispensing rates were even higher, at 109 per 1000 aged 65+. Both rates climbed steeply with age, were higher in females, and had a 1.6 to 1.8 fold variation across DHBs. Rates did not vary significantly with rest home and private hospital residential care usage, but antipsychotic rates appeared related to the use of psychogeriatric and dementia beds.", 
    "215": "Given the evident harms associated with the use of antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medicines in the elderly, and the relatively poor efficacy of antipsychotics in dementia care, prescribing of these medicines should be reassessed.

    "216": "The normal red blood cell (RBC) shape is a biconcave discocyte. An intercalation of a drug in the outer half of the membrane lipid bilayer leads to echinocytosis, an intercalation in the inner half to stomatocytosis. We have used the shape transforming capacity of RBCs as a model to analyse the membrane interaction potential of various neurotropic drugs. Chlorpromazine, clomipramine, citalopram, clonazepam, and diazepam induced a reversible stomatocytosis, phenytoin induced echinocytosis, while the anticonvulsants levetiracetam, valproic acid and phenobarbital had no effect. This diversity of RBC shape transformations suggests that the pharmacological action is not linked to the membrane interaction. We conclude that this simple RBC shape transformation assay could be a useful tool to screen for potential drug interactions with cell membranes.",

Subjects included 1192 adult patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who participated in clinical trials with the opportunity for at least two years of continuous treatment with olanzapine LAI (45-405\u2009mg every two to four weeks). Using the Benefit Risk Action Team (BRAT) framework, we evaluated frequency versus duration of benefits and risks commonly observed with atypical antipsychotics. We then used the Transparent Uniform Risk/Benefit Overview (TURBO) method, which weighs the drug's two most medically serious and/or frequent adverse events versus its primary benefit (effectiveness) and an ancillary benefit. The most frequent events among all patients were remaining free of relapse (91.4% for an average of 306\u2009days at one year, 88.4% for 546\u2009days at two years) and symptomatic remission (81.7% for an average of 239\u2009days at one year, 84.1% for 438\u2009days at two years). One- and two-year incidence of \u22657% weight gain was 33.3% and 41.7%. Incidences for sexual dysfunction, hyperprolactinemia, and post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome (PDSS) were <2%.

    "225": "The present study investigated the effects and potential mechanism(s) of action of icariin on the reproductive functions of male rats. Adult rats were treated orally with icariin at doses of 0 (control), 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg body weight for 35 consecutive days. The results show that icariin had virtually no effect on the body weight or organ coefficients of the testes or epididymides. However, 100 mg/kg icariin significantly increased epididymal sperm counts. In addition, 50 and 100 mg/kg icariin significantly increased testosterone levels. Real-time PCR suggests icariin may be involved in testosterone production via mRNA expression regulation of genes such as peripheral type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). Furthermore, 100 mg/kg icariin treatment also affected follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) and claudin-11 mRNA expression in Sertoli cells. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured in the testes; 50 and 100 mg/kg icariin treatment improved antioxidative capacity, while 200 mg/kg icariin treatment upregulated oxidative stress. These results collectively suggest that icariin within a certain dose range is beneficial to male reproductive functions; meanwhile, higher doses of icariin may damage reproductive functions by increasing oxidative stress in the testes.", 
    "226": "Valnoctamide (VCD), a derivative of valproate, suppresses electrographic seizures in animal models of status epilepticus (SE), even when the seizures are resistant to benzodiazepines (BZDs). We therefore tested the effect of VCD on miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in CA1 pyramidal cells to determine if VCD acts directly on \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors. Bath-applied VCD induced a specific, rapid, dose-dependent, and reversible slowing of the decay of mIPSCs (i.e., increased time constant) with no effect on their frequency or amplitude. This is similar to the effect of BZDs on mIPSCs, but the effect of VCD persisted in the presence of the BZD-binding site antagonist flumazenil, and was additive to the effect of the BZD, diazepam. These data suggest that VCD acts through a different binding site than that of BZDs, which likely accounts for its effect on BZD-refractory SE.

Therefore, the basic objective of the present study was to evaluate the antidiabetic effect of metformin, diazepam, and their combination in cooccurring T2DM and stress condition (DMS). T2DM was induced in the male rats by administering streptozotocin (45 mg/kg, i.p.) and nicotinamide (110 mg/kg, i.p.) with time lag of 15 min. Rats were subjected to two sessions of cold restraint stress paradigm for one hour on the sixth and seventh day after streptozotocin injection. Administration of metformin (25 mg/kg, p.o.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg, p.o.) in combination from the seventh to thirteenth day after streptozotocin injection showed better improvement in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity compared to monotherapy of either drug. In addition, the combination significantly attenuated DMS-induced hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, hypercorticosteronemia, anxiety-like behavior, and insulin resistance through modulating insulin signaling pathway in the liver compared to monotherapy. Further, improvement of mitochondrial function, integrity, and oxidative stress in hippocampus, hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, striatum, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens was observed with the combination. Therefore, metformin in combination with diazepam may be a better therapeutic option in the management of T2DM with cooccurring stress condition.", 
    "228": "Antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal adverse effects are well recognized in the context of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. However, the introduction of second-generation antipsychotics, with atypical mechanism of action, especially lower dopamine receptors affinity, was met with great expectations among clinicians regarding their potentially lower propensity to cause extrapyramidal syndrome. This review gives a brief summary of the recent literature relevant to second-generation antipsychotics and extrapyramidal syndrome. Numerous studies have examined the incidence and severity of extrapyramidal syndrome with first- and second-generation antipsychotics. The majority of these studies clearly indicate that extrapyramidal syndrome does occur with second-generation agents, though in lower rates in comparison with first generation. Risk factors are the choice of a particular second-generation agent (with clozapine carrying the lowest risk and risperidone the highest), high doses, history of previous extrapyramidal symptoms, and comorbidity. Also, in comparative studies, the choice of a first-generation comparator significantly influences the results. Extrapyramidal syndrome remains clinically important even in the era of second-generation antipsychotics. The incidence and severity of extrapyramidal syndrome differ amongst these antipsychotics, but the fact is that these drugs have not lived up to the expectation regarding their tolerability.", 
    "229": "Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8), a brain-gut peptide, plays an important role in several opioid addictive behaviors. We previously reported that CCK-8 attenuated the expression and reinstatement of morphine-induced conditioned place preference. The possible effects of CCK-8 on the negative affective components of drug abstinence are not clear. There are no studies evaluating the effect of CCK-8 on emotional symptoms, such as anxiety, in morphine-withdrawal animals. We investigated the effects of CCK-8 on the anxiety-like behavior in morphine-withdrawal rats using an elevated plus-maze. Morphine withdrawal elicited time-dependent anxiety-like behaviors with peak effects on day 10 (5 days after induction of morphine dependence). Treatment with CCK-8 (0.1 and 1 \u03bcg, i.c.v.) blocked this anxiety in a dose-dependent fashion. A CCK1 receptor antagonist (L-364,718, 10 \u03bcg, i.c.v.) blocked the effect of CCK-8. Mu-opioid receptor antagonism with CTAP (10 \u03bcg, i.c.v.) decreased the 'anxiolytic' effect. CCK-8 inhibited anxiety-like behaviors in morphine-withdrawal rats by up-regulating endogenous opioids via the CCK1 receptor in rats. This study clearly identifies a distinct function of CCK-8 and a potential medication target of central CCK1 receptors for drugs aimed at ameliorating drug addiction.", 
    "230": "The use of antidepressants, anxiolytics, mood stabilizers, anticonvulsants, and major tranquilizers introduces neurochemical, behavioral, cognitive, and emotional factors that increase the complexity of medical and surgical tasks. Increasingly, various classes of psychotropic medications are being prescribed in the perioperative setting for their analgesic properties in patients with or without a psychiatric diagnosis. In many cases, the precise mechanisms of action and dose-response relationships by which these agents mediate analgesia are largely unclear. An appreciation of the side effects and adverse-effect profiles of such medications and familiarity with the clinically relevant drug interactions that may occur in the perioperative setting are imperative to ensure the best possible outcome in dealing with patients on these medications. This review focuses on various classes of psychotropic agents, which are addressed individually, with particular focus on their analgesic properties. The latest published research is summarized, deficiencies in our current collective knowledge are discussed, and evidence-based recommendations are made for clinical practice.",

To reveal the mechanisms underlying these effects, this study investigated the effects of co-treatment of olanzapine and betahistine (O+B) on expressions of histaminergic H1 receptor (H1R), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in the hypothalamus associated with reducing olanzapine-induced weight gain. Olanzapine significantly upregulated the mRNA and protein expressions of H1R, while O+B co-treatment significantly downregulated the H1R levels, compared to the olanzapine-only treatment group. The NPY mRNA expression was significantly enhanced by olanzapine, but it was significantly reversed by O+B co-treatment. The hypothalamic H1R expression was positively correlated with total food intake, and NPY expression. Olanzapine also increased AMPK\u03b1 activation measured by the AMPK\u03b1 phosphorylation (pAMPK\u03b1)/AMPK\u03b1 ratio compared with controls, whereas O+B co-treatment decreased the pAMPK\u03b1/AMPK\u03b1 ratio, compared with olanzapine only treatment. The pAMPK\u03b1/AMPK\u03b1 ratio was positively correlated with total food intake and H1R expression. Although olanzapine administration decreased the POMC mRNA level, this level was not affected by O+B co-treatment. Therefore, these results suggested that co-treatment with betahistine may reverse olanzapine-induced body weight gain via the H1R-NPY and H1R-pAMPK\u03b1 pathways.", 
    "232": "The adolescent susceptibility to the onset of psychiatric disorders is only beginning to be understood when factoring in the development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The functional maturation of the PFC is dependent upon proper integration of glutamatergic inputs from the ventral hippocampus (vHipp) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Here we assessed how transient NMDAR blockade during adolescence alters the functional interaction of vHipp-BLA inputs in regulating PFC plasticity. Local field potential recordings were used to determine changes in long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) of PFC responses resulting from vHipp and BLA high-frequency stimulation in adult rats that received repeated injections of saline or the NMDAR antagonist MK-801 from postnatal day 35 (P35) to P40. We found that early adolescent MK-801 exposure elicited an age- and input-specific dysregulation of vHipp-PFC plasticity, characterized by a shift from LTD to LTP without altering the BLA-induced LTP. Data also showed that the vHipp normally resets the LTP state of BLA transmission; however, this inhibitory regulation is absent following early adolescent MK-801 treatment. This deficit was reminiscent of PFC responses seen in drug-naive juveniles. Notably, local prefrontal upregulation of GABAA\u03b11 function completely restored vHipp functionality and its regulation of BLA plasticity in MK-801-treated rats. Thus, NMDAR signaling is critical for the periadolescent acquisition of a GABA-dependent hippocampal control of PFC plasticity, which enables the inhibitory control of the prefrontal output by the vHipp. A dysregulation of this pathway can alter PFC processing of other converging afferents such as those from the BLA.", 
    "233": "During 2003-2009, the number of deaths caused by drug overdose in Florida increased 61.0%, from 1,804 to 2,905, with especially large increases in deaths caused by the opioid pain reliever oxycodone and the benzodiazepine alprazolam. In response, Florida implemented various laws and enforcement actions as part of a comprehensive effort to reverse the trend. This report describes changes in overdose deaths for prescription and illicit drugs and changes in the prescribing of drugs frequently associated with these deaths in Florida after these policy changes. During 2010-2012, the number of drug overdose deaths decreased 16.7%, from 3,201 to 2,666, and the deaths per 100,000 persons decreased 17.7%, from 17.0 to 14.0. Death rates for prescription drugs overall decreased 23.2%, from 14.5 to 11.1 per 100,000 persons. The decline in the overdose deaths from oxycodone (52.1%) exceeded the decline for other opioid pain relievers, and the decline in deaths for alprazolam (35.6%) exceeded the decline for other benzodiazepines. Similar declines occurred in prescribing rates for these drugs during this period. The temporal association between the legislative and enforcement actions and the substantial declines in prescribing and overdose deaths, especially for drugs favored by pain clinics, suggests that the initiatives in Florida reduced prescription drug overdose fatalities.", 
    "234": "Overprescribing of opioid pain relievers (OPR) can result in multiple adverse health outcomes, including fatal overdoses. Interstate variation in rates of prescribing OPR and other prescription drugs prone to abuse, such as benzodiazepines, might indicate areas where prescribing patterns need further evaluation.", 
    "235": "CDC analyzed a commercial database (IMS Health) to assess the potential for improved prescribing of OPR and other drugs. CDC calculated state rates and measures of variation for OPR, long-acting/extended-release (LA/ER) OPR, high-dose OPR, and benzodiazepines.", 
    "236": "In 2012, prescribers wrote 82.5 OPR and 37.6 benzodiazepine prescriptions per 100 persons in the United States. State rates varied 2.7-fold for OPR and 3.7-fold for benzodiazepines. For both OPR and benzodiazepines, rates were higher in the South census region, and three Southern states were two or more standard deviations above the mean. Rates for LA/ER and high-dose OPR were highest in the Northeast. Rates varied 22-fold for one type of OPR, oxymorphone.", 
    "237": "Factors accounting for the regional variation are unknown. Such wide variations are unlikely to be attributable to underlying differences in the health status of the population. High rates indicate the need to identify prescribing practices that might not appropriately balance pain relief and patient safety.", 
    "238": "State policy makers might reduce the harms associated with abuse of prescription drugs by implementing changes that will make the prescribing of these drugs more cautious and more consistent with clinical recommendations.", 
    "239": "The effects of two sedation protocols combining midazolam with ketamine (ketamine group) or dexmedetomidine (dexmedetomidine group) were studied in dwarf companion rabbits undergoing abdominal ultrasound scan. The onset of sedation was faster in the ketamine group; a few rabbits in the dexmedetomidine group required additional doses to lose the righting reflex, although sedation time was not different between groups. A semi-quantitative scale was used to score sedation quality, which was higher in rabbits that received dexmedetomidine rather than ketamine. Pulse rate was lower in the dexmedetomidine group (206 vs 240 bpm), although Doppler blood pressure was higher than in the ketamine group (109 vs 89 mm Hg). Respiratory rate decreased in relation to the baseline values with both protocols but arterial haemoglobin saturation with oxygen was maintained similar to the pre-sedation values throughout the entire procedure, regardless of protocol used and without oxygen supplementation. Both protocols allowed performance of ultrasound scanning, although dexmedetomidine may be preferred if a deep sedation level is required."
