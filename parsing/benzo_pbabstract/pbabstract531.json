    "0": "In experimental animal studies the benzodiazepine antagonist (BZA) flumazenil reversed galactosamine-induced fulminant liver failure. Based on this observation, we treated three patients (two male, one female), mean age 41 yrs (34-52 yrs) with five episodes (ep) of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) with i.v. BZA over 24 h. The efficacy of BZA in reversing HE was evaluated. On admission all patients had elevated plasma ammonia levels. The patients were in coma stage II (n = 3 ep) and stage III (n = 2 ep); the modified Glasgow score was less than 10 (n = 1 ep), 10-15 (n = 2 ep), 15-20 (n = 2 ep). No evidence for benzodiazepine, barbiturate or opiate intake was found in the urine. Two patients with HE episode stage II showed an immediate recovery within 1 h, which continued without any therapy other than BZA. After 24 h BZA was given orally, 30 mg q.i.d. One patient with an HE episode stage II showed no effect over 12 h. After this time he progressed to HE stage III; BA therapy was stopped. After discontinuation of BZA the Glasgow score rapidly deteriorated. Twenty-eight hours later BZA was given again with i.v. mannitol (20%) and oral lactulose and Fordtran solution. The patient then recovered within the next day. Another patient with a HE episode stage III showed a short lasting improvement after BA bolus injection. Then impairment of the Glasgow score was noted again. Lactulose and Fordtran solution was added orally and mannitol (20%) was given i.v. The patient recovered within 24 h to HE stage II and after 72 h to normal. BZA seems to improve hepatic encephalopathy, especially at an early stage (II). It appears less effective in stage III, most of all when there is evidence of brain oedema. No specific side-effects were observed during BZA therapy.", 
    "1": "The clinical anti-convulsant effect of flumazenil in epilepsy has been demonstrated: (i) by acute i.v. administration under EEG control in an epileptic patient who had been previously heavily sedated with diazepam; (ii) in patients undergoing pharmaco-EEG studies whereby spike and wave counts were diminished following oral administration of 10 mg of flumazenil; and (iii) in a series of 27 epileptic patients treated chronically for periods of up to 42 months with flumazenil as monotherapy or as addition to basic therapy. The daily dose ranged from 10-90 mg. Before treatment all patients presented with frequent seizures and had an abnormal EEG. In these patients the anti-convulsant effect was good or very good in 70% of the previously untreated (naive) patients and in about half of the patients who had epilepsy of long duration and had been treated already with standard anti-convulsants. Side-effects with flumazenil were generally mild in nature and rarely led to discontinuation. About one-third of the patients expressed a feeling of well-being while under therapy with flumazenil. A possible mechanism of action is discussed.", 
    "2": "Flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) is a specific benzodiazepine antagonist that can selectively prevent or abolish at the receptor level all centrally mediated effects of benzodiazepines. Following oral administration, flumazenil is absorbed rapidly (peak concentrations are achieved after 20-90 min absorption half-life 0.3 h) but bio-availability is low (16%) owing to significant pre-systemic elimination. As less than 0.2% of an i.v. dose is recovered as unchanged drug in the urine, extensive metabolism must occur and so far three metabolites of flumazenil (N-demethylated and/or hydrolysed products and corresponding glucuronides) have been identified. In the clinical use of flumazenil, rapid onset of action is mandatory. This is facilitated by its fast uptake and regional brain distribution, as verified by positron emission tomography (PET). The limited duration of the benzodiazepine-antagonistic action of flumazenil (2-3 h) is due to its rapid hepatic elimination. This can be characterized either by the short half-life of 0.7-1.3 h or, better, by the high plasma and blood clearance of 520-1300 ml min-1. The low plasma protein binding of flumazenil (about 40%) will not limit its wide distribution (apparent distribution volume 0.6-1 kg) or its partly flow-dependent hepatic elimination. In interaction studies with healthy volunteers, with either midazolam, lormetazepam and flunitrazepam or ethanol, it was found that the disposition of flumazenil was not affected by co-administration of these four drugs. Consequently, pharmacokinetic interactions between benzodiazepines (or alcohol) can be ruled out. So far the pharmacokinetics of the antagonist have been evaluated only in healthy volunteers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "Cortical alpha-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, cholinergic (muscarinic) and benzodiazepine receptors have been studied in the albino rat and Mastomys natalensis (desert rat) using radioligand binding. Scatchard analysis was performed to determine affinity (Kd) and density (Bmax) of receptors. Compared to the albino rat, the desert rat was found to have higher affinity and density of alpha-adrenergic receptors. Beta-adrenergic receptors had similar Kd in both species but Bmax was significantly lower in the desert rat as compared to the albino rat. Cholinergic (muscarinic) receptors as well as the benzodiazepine receptors were in significantly higher density in the desert rat. The affinity was low for muscarinic receptors in the desert rat but equal for benzodiazepine receptors in both species. Since there are more alpha-adrenergic, muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors in the desert rat, this species should be of value in screening compounds active at these sites.", 
    "4": "1. When U50 was given to rats over 5 d by twice-daily s.c. injection (but not when delivered by osmotic minipump), buprenorphine and naloxone each precipitated strong, qualitatively distinct, behavioral syndromes. 2. The same dose of buprenorphine provoked similar behaviors in rats given chronic U50 and chronic TIF (analogous s.c. injection protocols), suggestive of neuroadaptation to kappa agonists as a class. This adaptation clearly contrasts with that to chronic mu agonists. 3. The buprenorphine-induced syndrome was characterized by oral stereotypies which had an onset of about 5 min and a duration greater than 4 hr. The intensity was dependent on the dose of agonist injected. 4. The naloxone-induced syndrome was characterized by repetitive yawning and writhing. 5. If oral stereotypy, yawning and writhing are considered to represent an abstinence syndrome, then it will be necessary to use multiple or more selective kappa antagonists to fully unveil kappa dependence in the rat. 6. The present data indicate a strong trend toward the parallel development of tolerance in rats given a similar course of chronic U50 injections as those tested for physical dependence.", 
    "5": "At present, the nomenclature of benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors is based on historical association with the BZ structure. However, it is mainly through the new compounds chemically unrelated to BZ that the central and peripheral subtypes of BZ receptors have been characterized. We therefore propose the nomenclature of a Greek letter omega, as omega 1, omega 2, and omega 3 to designate the central BZ1, BZ2, and peripheral BZ receptors, respectively. Among the several classes of non-BZD drugs with affinity for different receptors, the imidazopyridines provide a valuable tool for the characterization of omega receptor subtypes. Most BZ are nonselective ligands for the central omega 1 and omega 2 receptors, while selectivity for omega 1 receptor subtypes is present in several non BZ chemical series: imidazopyridines (zolpidem), triazolopyridazines (CL 218872), betacarbolines (beta-CCE), and pyrazoloquinolines (CGS 8216). Selective ligands for the omega 2 subtype are not available so far. The so-called peripheral BZ receptor is also present in the central nervous system; therefore, the proposed nomenclature of omega 3 receptors resolves this paradox because it does not designate location and is defined in terms of pharmacological specificity. Selective ligands for omega 3 receptors include the BZ Ro 5-4864, and the isoquinolinecarboxamide PK 11195, while the imidazopyridine alpidem is the ligand with the highest affinity for this receptor subtype.", 
    "6": "[11C]4'-Chlorodiazepam (RO5-4864), for PET studies of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, was synthesized by alkylation of 1-desmethyl-4'-chlorodiazepam, in a small volume of acetone adsorbed on acrylic yarn, with [11C]methyl iodide in the injection loop of a liquid chromatograph. The reaction mixture was introduced directly onto a small, disposable alumina chromatographic column. Elution with pentane:ethanol gave a product of high chemical and radiochemical purity. A simple heating and cooling device for the injection loop is described.", 
    "7": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites on intact platelets from untreated chronic insomniac patients and those chronically treated with benzodiazepine hypnotics were investigated to evaluate their putative involvement in sleep pathology and the influence of treatment. There were 34 elderly subjects in the study, 14 controls (80.7 years) and 20 insomniac patients, of whom 7 were untreated (61.1 years) and 13 were treated (84.4 years). There was an equivalent number of peripheral-type benzodiazepine 3H-PK 11195 binding sites on platelets from untreated (7.61 pmol/mg protein) and treated insomniacs (6.39 pmol/mg protein) and on platelets from the controls (6.21 pmol/mg protein). However, there was a twofold reduction in the affinity of these sites in untreated (Kd = 8.02 nM) and treated (Kd = 7.40 nM) insomniacs compared to controls (3.79 nM). This difference raises the possibility that peripheral-type benzodiazepine sites are involved in abnormal sleep.", 
    "8": "The present study demonstrates a differential effect of various detergent treatments on [3H]Ro 5-4864 and [3H]PK 11195 binding to peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites (PBS). Triton X-100 (0.0125%) caused a decrease of about 70% in [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to membranes from various peripheral tissues of rat, but had only a negligible effect on [3H]PK 11195 binding. A similar effect of Triton X-100 was observed on guinea pig and rabbit kidney membranes. The decrease in [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding after treatment with Triton X-100 was apparently due to a decrease in the density of PBS, since the affinity remained unaltered. The detergents 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPS), Tween 20, deoxycholic acid, or digitonin (0.0125%) caused only a minor change in [3H]Ro 5-4864 and [3H]PK 11195 binding to rat kidney membranes; but when concentrations were substantially increased (0.1%), all detergents caused a decrease of at least 50% in [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding, while [3H]PK 11195 binding to rat kidney membranes remained unaffected by the first three detergents, with only a minor decrease (15%) after treatment with digitonin. These results may further support the assumption that Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195 are agonist and antagonist, respectively, of PBS and interact with two different conformations or domains in the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site molecule.", 
    "9": "1. This study examined the saturation binding of tritiated gamma-aminobutyric acid [( 3H]GABA) and [3H]diazepam in brain membranes from young (3 month-old) and aged (21-23 month-old) Long Evans male rats killed at two time points in the 24-hour cycle. 2. The daytime density of low-affinity GABA binding sites was significantly (p less than 0.05) lower in cortical membranes from aged animals. There were no differences between young and old rats in low-affinity GABA binding at night, or in high-affinity GABA binding at either time point. 3. Diazepam binding was significantly lower in the brains of aged animals killed during the daytime. There was no differences at night, when diazepam binding in young animals declined to match that of aged animals. 4. There were no differences in the affinities of either GABA or diazepam binding sites. 5. These findings indicate that sampling time significantly influences age-associated changes in the densities of low-affinity GABA and diazepam binding sites. Therefore, the effects of age on brain receptor binding parameters should be measured at several points in the 24-hour light/dark cycle in order to control for possible age-related changes in binding rhythmicity.", 
    "10": "The behavioral effects of the GABA-related drugs SL 75102 (4-[[(4-chlorophenyl)-(5-fluoro-2-hydroxyphenyl)-methylene]amino]butyric acid) and THIP (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyrindin-3-ol) were studied alone and in combination with lorazepam. Two groups of squirrel monkeys responded under a fixed-interval schedule of food presentation. In one group, responding was suppressed by superimposing a fixed-ratio schedule of response-produced electric shock; responding was not suppressed in the second group. Dose-response curves were determined by administering cumulative doses IV during timeout periods that preceded sequential components of the fixed-interval schedule. Neither SL 75102 (1.0-30.0 mg/kg) nor THIP (0.1-3.0 mg/kg) significantly altered rates of either suppressed or nonsuppressed responding, whereas lorazepam (0.01-0.3 mg/kg) produced dose-related increases in response rate under both schedules. Pretreatment with 1.0 mg/kg SL 75102 significantly enhanced the rate-increasing effects of lorazepam on suppressed responding. Pretreatment with 10.0 mg/kg SL 75102 also enhanced the rate-increasing effects of lorazepam on nonsuppressed responding. In contrast, the rate-increasing effects of lorazepam were not enhanced by pretreatment with 0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg THIP under either schedule. Moreover, pretreatment with 1.0 mg/kg THIP attenuated the rate-increasing effects of lorazepam on nonsuppressed responding. Enhancement of the behavioral effects of lorazepam by SL 75102 may reflect positive allosteric interactions between the two drugs at the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex.", 
    "11": "Recent studies on the neurotransmitter organization of the basal ganglia and forebrain in lower vertebrates suggest that, in contrast to the old concepts of the phylogeny of the brain, there are many similarities between the chemical organization of the brain throughout evolution. By examining neurotransmitter receptors using in vitro autoradiography we have attempted to further our understanding of the evolution of the brain. Receptors enriched in different parts of the basal ganglia in mammals appear to be also enriched in the homologous areas in lower vertebrates. Thus, for example, dopamine and muscarinic receptors, but not serotonin-1A, are enriched in the paleostriatum augmentatum while GABA/benzodiazepine receptors are enriched in the paleostriatum primitivum corresponding with their localization to the caudate-putamen and globus pallidus respectively. Our results support the concept of a more conservative evolution of the vertebrate brain and demonstrate the usefulness of receptor autoradiography in the understanding of brain evolution.", 
    "12": "A method for the synthesis of no-carrier-added of 7-[123I]iodo-1,3-dihydro-5-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-2H-1,4- benzodiazepine-2-one with a radiochemical yield of 25-30% has been developed. This benzodiazepine was prepared by reaction of [123I]iodide with the corresponding piperidyltriazene in acid medium and the reaction has been optimized for solvent, time and temperature. The triazene was synthesized by reduction of flunitrazepam to the amine, diazotisation and coupling with piperidine. Biodistribution studies of this radioligand in rats showed a maximum brain uptake of 0.35% of the injected dose at 15 min, which decline to 0.02% at 120 min.", 
    "13": "Mice were tested in a simple automated Y-maze. Total number of arm entries and alternation behaviour were measured. The latter is thought to reflect working memory capacity at a rudimentary level. During an 8 min session, vehicle-treated mice performed 32.4 +/- 7.4 arm entries, 51.0 +/- 12.4% of which were organized in alternations (triplets). The two variables showed a negative correlation. Scopolamine (1.0 mg/kg) significantly enhanced activity, reduced alternation behaviour and diminished the correlation between the two variables. The effects of benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist, antagonist and agonist beta-carbolines on this spontaneous behaviour and on the effects of scopolamine were examined. The effects of inverse agonists and agonists on locomotor activity were complex in interaction with both vehicle and scopolamine. The scopolamine-induced reduction of alternation behaviour was significantly reversed by the antagonist ZK 93426 but not by inverse agonists; furthermore, partial agonists and agonists showed no effects. It is hypothesized that the interaction of antagonist beta-carbolines with scopolamine is based on a direct GABA-ergic control of cholinergic neurotransmission, and suggests an ability of antagonist beta-carbolines to antagonize amnestic properties of scopolamine.", 
    "14": "Exposure to bedding taken from the soiled home cage of an isolated male resident elicited a significant increase in the nociceptive responses of male deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus artemisiae, from mixed sex pairs. The analgesia induced by exposure to the male scent was insensitive to the opiate antagonist, naloxone, and was blocked by either pre- or post-olfactory exposure injections of the benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788, or agonist, diazepam. This non-opioid analgesia was of brief duration (15-30 min) and rapid onset, being evident after 1 min of exposure to the olfactory cues. Bedding treated with the novel odor of peppermint also induced analgesia in the deer mice. This analgesia was opioid mediated, being blocked by naloxone and insensitive to the benzodiazepine manipulations. Exposure to either fresh bedding, or the soiled bedding of another mixed sex pair of deer mice, had no significant effect on nociception. These results indicate that exposure of male deer mice to the olfactory cues associated with a potentially threatening individual (dominant/aggressive isolated male) elicits an analgesic response that involves alterations in the activity of benzodiazepine systems.", 
    "15": "The benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) is a site on the GABAA-receptor-chloride channel by means of which benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine compounds produce positive or negative allosteric modulation of the channel gating function and which is blocked by BZR antagonists. Whether the BZR is acted upon by one or several endogenous ligands under normal or pathologic conditions is still a controversial issue after 10 years of intensive research. Evidence is provided for the unconventional view that there need not be an endogenous ligand of the BZR; neither to justify the existence of this receptor, nor to explain the effects of exogenous BZR ligands. Out of a number of putative endogenous compounds with affinity for the BZR, the peptide DBI (diazepam binding inhibitor) stands out as a ligand that might act on the BZR in a subset of GABAergic synapses or under particular situations. The low affinity of DBI for the BZR and its distribution in the body suggest, however, that its primary function might not be at the level of the BZR.", 
    "16": "The effect of a single intraperitoneal administration of diazepam (relanium) (2.5 mg/kg) on specific binding of 3H-(D-Ala-2, D-Leu-5)-enkephalin (10 nM) by the rat striatum membranes was studied. The drug was shown to increase the binding activity of opioid receptors 15 minutes after the injection. At prolongation of the animal exposure by up to 45 minutes the magnitude of the activity decreases below the control level. Under in vitro conditions diazepam shows the activating effect which is similar to that ex vivo. It was found that the changes in the opioid receptor binding activity were produced by alterations of the maximal number of specific binding sites.", 
    "17": "The benzodiazepine derivative flurazepam (FLZ) is widely used as a hypnotic, but the relative contributions of FLZ and its metabolites desalkylflurazepam (DA-FLZ), hydroxyethylflurazepam (ETOH-FLZ), and flurazepam aldehyde (CHO-FLZ) to overall clinical activity remain uncertain. A single 20 mg/kg dose of FLZ.HCl was administered to mice, with plasma and brain concentrations of FLZ and metabolites determined during 5 h after dosage. Brain and plasma concentrations of FLZ were maximal at 0.5 h after dosage, then declined rapidly in parallel, whereas those of DAFLZ were maximal at 2 h, then declined slowly. Concentrations of ETOH-FLZ, the most polar metabolite, were maximal at 0.5 h, and were undetectable after 3 h. Little CHO-FLZ was detected in either brain or plasma. A single 30-mg oral dose of FLZ.HCl was given to 18 human volunteers, with plasma levels determined over 9 days. FLZ was detected in plasma at low concentrations for no more than 3 h after dosage. ETOH-FLZ concentrations were higher and persisted for 8 h after dosage. CHO-FLZ reached intermediate peak levels and was present longer than FLZ or ETOH-FLZ. In contrast, DA-FLZ achieved the greatest peak concentrations, occurring at 10 h after dosage. Levels declined very slowly, with a mean half-life of 71.4 h, and were still detectable 9 days after FLZ dosage. Plasma free fractions (percent unbound) in mice were 40.3, 51.4, and 25.0% for FLZ, ETOH-FLZ and DA-FLZ, respectively; in humans, values were 17.2, 35.2, and 3.5%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "Pigeons trained to discriminate between the presence and absence of delta 9-THC (0.56 mg/kg, IM, intramuscularly) were tested with diazepam (5.6-30 mg/kg), administered IG (intragastrically), and were found to generalize the response associated with the THC training to the diazepam treatment only to a limited extent. Two groups of gerbils trained to discriminate between the presence and absence of IP (intraperitoneally) injected benzodiazepine agonists (5.6 mg/kg of diazepam and Ro 11-3128, respectively) generally did not generalize the drug response to IP administered THC (5.6 and 17.5 mg/kg). In addition, substitution testing with the dopamine autoreceptor blocker (+)-3PPP yielded non-drug responding in the pigeons. Hence neither proposed structural similarity between 3-PPP and THC, nor purported anxiolytic activity by 3-PPP (see Introduction) matched the THC-induced stimulus effects. The data are discussed with reference to the specificity of the THC cue or stimulus.", 
    "19": "The intrinsic effects of two imidazodiazepines RO 15-3505 and RO 17-1812 on the behavior of mice in a holeboard test were investigated. The interactions of these two drugs with ethanol were also studied. RO 15-3505 (0.75-6.0 mg/kg) failed to significantly alter either exploratory head-dipping or locomotor activity when administered alone but doses of 0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg reversed the reduction in the number of head-dips caused by ethanol (2 g/kg) and partially reversed ethanol's locomotor stimulant action. In contrast, RO 17-1812 (0.75-6.0 mg/kg) increased locomotor activity when administered alone, and enhanced the reduction in exploration caused by ethanol. Neither RO 15-3505 nor RO 17-1812 altered blood alcohol concentrations suggesting a pharmacodynamic basis for these interactions. The results suggest that in the holeboard test the interactions of imidazodiazepines with ethanol are related to the nature of their interaction with benzodiazepine receptors, inverse agonists antagonising and agonists enhancing ethanol's effects on exploration.", 
    "20": "The presence of both MAO and benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor binding inhibitory activities in rat tissues has been reported previously. The two activities were similarly and unevenly distributed in the tissues. This dual inhibitory activity has been termed tribulin. We report here the effect of 1 1/2 hrs cold restraint stress on tribulin activity in rat tissues together with biochemical evidence to support the concept of a physiological role of tribulin. Stress induced a significant increment of both activities in heart and kidney while no significant changes were observed in the other tissues studied. Hearts and kidneys from stressed rats also showed a significant decrease of MAO activity, a significant increase of dopamine content and a significant decrease of the binding of 3H-Ro 5-4864 to peripheral BZ receptors. Scatchard analysis of the saturation curves carried out using 3H-Ro 5-4864 (0.4-10 nM) showed significant Bmax decreases in both organs. No significant change in either of these inhibitory activities was observed in the other tissues studied. These data provide support for a role of tribulin in the biochemical response to stress.", 
    "21": "The concept of isoreceptors offers a possible clue to account for pharmacological and biochemical heterogeneity in specific receptor systems. The existence of isozymes has set the foundation for the definition of isoreceptors. The resulting criteria are applied to two central receptor complexes. Accordingly, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is defined as an isoreceptor, and research results on the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor are interpreted under the consideration of the possible existence of isoreceptors.", 
    "22": "The in vitro and in vivo regulation of [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) by ion transport/exchange inhibitors was studied in the kidney. The potencies of 9-anthroic acid, furosemide, bumetanide, hydrochlorothiazide and SITS as inhibitors of [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to renal membranes were consistent with their actions as anion transport inhibitors (Ki approximately equal to 30 - 130 microM). In contrast, spironolactone, amiloride, acetazolamide, and ouabain were less potent (Ki = 100-1000 microM). Administration of furosemide to rats for five days resulted in a profound diuresis (approximately equal to 350% increase in urine volume) accompanied by a significant increase in PBR density (43%) that was apparent by the fifth day of treatment. Administration of hydrochlorothiazide or Ro 5-4864 for five days also caused diuresis and increased renal PBR density. Both the diuresis and increased density of PBR produced by Ro 5-4864 were blocked by coadministration of PK 11195, which alone had no effect on either PBR density or urine volume. The equilibrium binding constants of [3H]Ro 5-4864 to cardiac membranes were unaffected by administration of any of these drugs. These findings suggest that renal PBR may be selectively modulated in vivo and in vitro by administration of ion transport/exchange inhibitors.", 
    "23": "To elucidate the relationship between the occupancy of BDZ binding sites and phospholipid methylation in brain, we examined phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PEMT) activity in synaptosomes of rat hippocampi and cerebella in the presence of BDZ ligands with different modes of action. We found that Ro 5-4864, a specific ligand for \"peripheral type\" receptors, increased PL methylation in hippocampal and cerebellar synaptosomes. This effect was directly related to receptor occupancy, since the specific antagonist PK 11195 inhibited the rise in PEMT activity induced by Ro 5-4864. Clonazepam, on the other hand, tended to reduce PL production in cerebellum and hippocampus except for hippocampal (3H)-phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine which was elevated by 40 to 70% at doses ranging from 10(-9) to 10(-6) M. When equimolar concentrations of the antagonist Ro 15-1788 were given in association the clonazepam-induced phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine increase was reduced by 70%. These data support the involvement of structural and functional membrane alterations in the action of BDZ.", 
    "24": "The effect of benzodiazepines on adenylate cyclase system was examined in rat brain. Micromolar concentrations of diazepam inhibited the enzyme activity in synaptic membranes in dose- and time-dependent manners. The inhibitory effect of diazepam was more evident on the enzyme activity in the presence of guanylyl-5'-imidodiphosphate (GppNHp) or NaF-AlCl3 than on that in the basal state. In the pertussis toxin-treated membranes, the effect of diazepam in the presence of GppNHp or NaF-AlCl3 was markedly suppressed. In addition, other benzodiazepines, such as medazepam, flurazepam, flunitrazepam, and clonazepam, had similar effects to those of diazepam, whereas Ro15-1788, an antagonist of a high affinity receptor in the central nervous system, had no effect on adenylate cyclase activity and did not antagonize the effect of diazepam. These findings indicate that benzodiazepines inhibit rat brain adenylate cyclase activity through the effects on both a low affinity benzodiazepine receptor coupled with the inhibitory GTP-binding regulatory protein (Gi) and catalytic protein.", 
    "25": "3H-Flunitrazepam (FNZP) binding was examined in a crude membrane fraction obtained from rat interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT). A single population of binding sites was apparent with dissociation constant (KD) = 0.47 +/- 0.04 microM and maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) = 31 +/- 5 pmol.mg prot-1. From the activity of several benzodiazepine (BZP) analogs to compete for the binding, the peripheral nature of FNZP binding was tentatively established. Similar BZP binding sites were detectable in isolated IBAT mitochondria. Exposure of rats to 4 degrees C for 15 days decreased Bmax significantly without affecting KD. Cold-induced decrease in Bmax of BZP binding was prevented by surgical IBAT denervation. Denervation prevented or impaired the increased activity of the mitochondrial markers succinate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase in IBAT of cold-exposed rats, but did not affect monoamine oxidase activity. Hypophysectomy of rats decreased significantly both KD and Bmax of IBAT BZP binding. Thyroidectomy, adrenalectomy or ovariectomy did not affect IBAT BZP binding parameters. The BZP analogs diazepam, clonazepan and Ro 5-4864 decreased significantly guanosine 5'-diphosphate binding (GDP) in IBAT mitochondria while co-incubation of Ro 5-4964 or clonazepam with the peripheral type BZP antagonist PK 11195 did not modify BZP activity on GDP binding. Our results indicate that BZP binding in rat IBAT may belong to the peripheral type, is decreased by a cold environment through activation of peripheral sympathetic nerves and is affected by hypophysectomy. BZP and GDP binding in IBAT mitochondria seem not to be functionally related.", 
    "26": "We have assessed the effects of in vivo administration of different classes of diuretic drugs on the expression of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site (PBBS) in crude membranes derived from the cortex and outer medulla of rat kidney by saturation analysis with the PBBS-selective ligands [3H]RO5-4864 and [3H]PK 11195 in cortex and [3H]RO5-4864 in outer medulla. Administration for 14-15 days of furosemide, a drug that blocks NaCl-KCl coupled transport in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, produced a significant doubling in the PBBS density (Bmax) in outer medulla, a region of the kidney rich in thick ascending limbs, and produced a lesser but significant increase in PBBS density in the cortex. Conversely, administration for 14-15 days of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide, which acts predominantly in the proximal tubule, and hydrochlorothiazide, which acts predominantly in the early distal tubule, elicited statistically significant increases in PBBS density in renal cortex but not in renal outer medulla. Furthermore, all drug treatments were without effect on the equilibrium dissociation constants (Kds) of [3H]RO5-4864 and [3H]PK 11195 binding to cortical and outer medullary membrane preparations. These findings demonstrate that the PBBS can be selectively \"up-regulated\" in different regions of the kidney by diuretic drugs with different modes/sites of action.", 
    "27": "The characteristics of [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to \"peripheral\" benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues were examined after chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). One week after the intracisternal administration of 6-OHDA, the number of [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding sites (Bmax) in the hypothalamus and striatum increased 41 and 50%, respectively, concurrent with significant reductions in catecholamine content. An increase (34%) in the Bmax of [3H]Ro 5-4864 to cardiac ventricle was observed one week after parenteral 6-OHDA administration. In contrast, the Bmax of [3H]Ro 5-4864 to pineal gland decreased 48% after 6-OHDA induced reduction in norepinephrine content. The Bmax values for [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to other tissues (including lung, kidney, spleen, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus and olfactory bulbs) were unaffected by 6-OHDA administration. The density of pineal, but not cardiac PBR was also reduced after reserpine treatment, an effect reversed by isoproterenol administration. These findings demonstrate that alterations in sympathetic input may regulate the density of PBR in both the central nervous system and periphery in a tissue specific fashion.", 
    "28": "Groups of male CD-1 mice (n = 12/group) were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with 5 g ethanol/kg of body weight. After loss of righting reflex, they were given vehicle or one of 2-3 doses of reputed or potential antagonists of ethanol intravenously (IV). Sleep time was measured from loss to return of righting reflex. Mean sleep time (MST) was increased significantly (P less than 0.05) by a large dose of dl-amphetamine (24 mg/kg) and by 4-aminopyridine (1, 5 mg/kg). Significant (P less than 0.01) increases were also produced by small and large doses of aminophylline (25, 100 mg/kg) and by yohimbine (1, 5 mg/kg). MST was not altered significantly by small and medium doses of dl-amphetamine (6, 12 mg/kg), a medium dose of aminophylline (50 mg/kg), or by any doses of naloxone, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, propranolol, physostigmine, doxapram, or Ro 15-4513. When Ro 15-4513 was given IP 15 minutes before ethanol (n = 6/group), onset and duration of narcosis were not altered. None of the compounds tested was an effective IV antidote for deep ethanol narcosis because of drug side effects, toxicity, prolongation of MST, or insufficient shortening of MST.", 
    "29": "The hypothesis that a novel drug binding site linked to a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-regulated chloride ionophore mediates the excitatory effects of the atypical benzodiazepine (BZ) Ro5 4864 is further evaluated in the present study. Dose-dependent inhibition of [3H]flunitrazepam to the central BZ receptor in rat cerebral cortex by the cage convulsant t-butylbicyclophosphorotionate (TBPS) is modulated by Ro5 4864 and the isoquinoline PK 11195 in a manner consistent with their reported pro/anticonvulsant effects. The ability of Ro5 4864 to enhance the binding of [35S]TBPS to a GABA-regulated chloride ionophore in rat cortex is unchanged after the irreversible labeling of the central BZ receptor by the photoaffinity label Ro15 4513. Together, these observations further suggest that 1) the effect of Ro5 4864 on [35S]TBPS is not mediated by the central BZ receptor and 2) the Ro5 4864 binding site is allosterically coupled to the GABA/BZ receptor-chloride ionophore complex in rat cerebral cortex. Anatomical localization of Ro5 4864-stimulated [35S]TBPS binding in rat brain by autoradiography reveals a distribution of chloride ionophore-coupled Ro5 4864 sites which is in many instances similar to that of the GABA/BZ receptor-chloride ionophore complex. These studies lend additional support to the postulate that this drug binding site represents an additional locus for the regulation of GABAergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system.", 
    "30": "Receptors may be grouped into superfamilies, according to their mechanism. Muscarinic receptors belong to one such superfamily, that of the G-protein coupled receptors. Subtypes of muscarinic receptors may be defined according to their primary amino acid sequence, their mechanism and their pharmacology. However, there is as yet no consistent scheme to explain the pharmacology and function of each molecular subtype. The pharmacological tools which distinguish between muscarinic receptor subtypes are described and the emerging evidence for the location of the ligand binding site is discussed.", 
    "31": "Stimulation of acid secretion by muscarinic agents involves receptors with a higher apparent affinity to the M1-antagonists, pirenzepine and telenzepine, than those regulating heart rate and salivary secretion. However, the localization of the proposed M1-receptors regulating acid secretion remains unclear. Studies with parietal cells isolated from several species indicate that parietal cells have a muscarinic receptor with low affinity for the M1-antagonists. Our studies with somatostatin cells isolated from canine fundic mucosa indicates that the muscarinic receptor inhibiting somatostatin release also is of low affinity for M1-antagonists. We have found no evidence for regulation of histamine release from canine fundic mast cells, whereas there is evidence that acetylcholine induces histamine release from the enterochromaffin-like cells of the rat and rabbit fundic mucosa. Further studies will be necessary to determine which of the muscarinic receptors potentially involved in the regulation of acid secretion is responsible for the M1-behavior of this pathway.", 
    "32": "The facilitatory actions of muscarine on synaptic transmission were measured in rat superior cervical ganglia in vitro. Muscarine (300 nmol/l) induced increases in submaximal population action potentials, which were mimicked by the M1 receptor agonist McN-A-343 (1 mumol/l) and antagonized by the M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine (100 nmol/l) and telenzepine (100 nmol/l), but not by the M2 receptor antagonist AF-DX 116 (1 mumol/l). Slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials recorded from curarized rabbit isolated superior cervical ganglia were also blocked by telenzepine (300 nmol/l) but not by AF-DX 116 (3 mumol/l). It is concluded that M1 receptors mediate the excitatory actions of muscarinic agonists in these sympathetic ganglia.", 
    "33": "The GABA/benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor chloride channel complex was investigated during repeated episodes of ethanol intoxication and withdrawal in the rat; the intragastric intoxication technique was applied and the severity of intoxication, withdrawal and number of seizures were recorded. The following groups were studied after decapitation during withdrawal 10-16 h after the last ethanol feeding: A) isocalorically fed controls not receiving ethanol; B) isocalorical controls subjected to a single ethanol intoxication period; C) animals subjected to 15 intoxication-withdrawal episodes (spontaneous seizures); D) same as C, but without developing seizures. A radio receptor technique was applied in the characterization of the receptor complex comprising specific binding to the BZ-receptor, the chloride channel and the GABA receptor by 3H-diazepam, 35S-TBPS and 3H-muscimol, respectively. The allosteric couplings among the components of the receptor complex were studied by 3H-diazepam and 35S-TBPS binding enhancement tests involving muscimol, ZK 93423 and DMCM. Cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum were the brain regions studied. Except for a reduced specific binding of 3H-diazepam in cerebellum, there were no indications of changes in specific binding to any part of the receptor complex. The allosteric coupling of BZ and GABA receptors as well as chloride channel-BZ receptors were unchanged in all groups. It is notable that no changes at all could be related to number of intoxication-withdrawal episodes or to the development of seizures. Thus, the present study gave no indication that the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor chloride channel complex is directly involved in the augmentation of cerebral nervous system excitability (seizures) during repeated episodes of physical ethanol dependence.", 
    "34": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. To test this hypothesis, we administered the highly selective and specific CCK receptor antagonist L 364,718 to rats in which acute experimental pancreatitis had been induced by the use of transduodenal pancreatic duct injection of taurocholate. It was, however, found that despite the use of L 364,718 at a high dose level (1 mg/kg body weight given three times), and also given prior to induction of pancreatitis, the mortality rate, the serum or ascites amylase activity, the pancreatic concentrations of lysosomal enzymes or the morphology of the pancreas were not affected. This suggests that the CCK receptors are not involved in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis in this experimental model, and, consequently, that CCK receptor antagonists have no place in the therapy of this condition.", 
    "35": "The function of the chloride channel associated to GABAA receptor complex was analyzed in the brain of aged rats by measuring the chloride flux across the neuronal membrane and its modulation by drugs acting at the level of the GABA receptor complex and 35S-TBPS binding. The basal 36Cl- uptake by brain membrane vesicles of aged rats was higher (22%) than that observed in those of adult rats. The higher 36Cl- uptake found in cortical membrane vesicles of senescent rats was not sensitive to the action of bicuculline indicating that it was not the consequence of a tonic GABAergic modulation. Moreover, the stimulation of 36Cl- uptake induced by GABA was markedly lower in membrane vesicles of aged rats than that observed in those of adult rats. Accordingly, the stimulation of 36Cl- efflux elicited by GABA (18%) and pentobarbital (26%) was higher in membrane vesicles of adult rats with respect to that (8 and 16%, respectively) of old rats. Finally, a significant decrease of 35S-TBPS binding was observed in membrane preparation from the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus of aged-rats. Scatchard plot analysis indicated that the decrease was entirely due to a reduction in the total number of binding sites with no change in their affinity. All together the results indicate that in the rat brain the function of the chloride channel coupled to the GABA/benzodiazepine/barbiturate receptor complex is reduced by aging.", 
    "36": "The structure of the GABAA receptor, through which GABA--the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS--produces its major synaptic effects, has recently been identified. The GABAA receptor is a member of a family of receptor-operated ion channels to which the nicotinic cholinergic receptor-cation channel and the glycine receptor-anion channel belong. The GABAA receptor, formed by two different subunits with structural homologies, contains at least two pharmacologically important allosteric modulatory sites, one being the BZR. The BZR responds to two classes of active ligands, namely the so-called BZR agonists, which produce a positive modulation of GABAA receptor function resulting in anxiolytic, anticonvulsive, sedative, and muscle relaxant activity, and the so-called BZR inverse agonists, which produce a negative allosteric modulation of the GABAA receptor function resulting in a mirror image of the agonist profile. The effects of these two extreme classes of ligands (with maximal positive and negative intrinsic efficacy, respectively) are blocked by BZR antagonists, ligands of the BZR devoid of relevant intrinsic efficacy. Flumazenil is the first BZR antagonist available for therapeutic use. The molecular basis of the activities of BZR ligands and of their interactions has enormously increased our understanding of the complex function of neuronal receptors and neurotransmitters.", 
    "37": "The BZR is an allosteric modulatory site of the GABAA receptor, which is unique insofar as it mediates both a positive (facilitatory) and a negative (inhibitory) modulation of the GABA-mediated gating of the chloride channel. Ligands acting as positive modulators are called BZR agonists; ligands producing negative modulation, inverse BZR agonists. The effects of both classes of ligands are blocked by antagonists. A large number of compounds belonging to these three groups of ligands are known. Concepts are presented here that could explain the modulatory function of the BZR, and a number of factors are proposed to determine the pharmacological and therapeutic profile of BZR ligands: intrinsic efficacy at the BZR, density of GABAA-BZR on neurons, functional reserve in GABAA-BZRs, the intensity of the GABAergic input to a neuron, and the excitatory neuronal state. The effect of these factors on the pharmacology of full agonists, partial agonists, antagonists, partial inverse agonists, and inverse agonists is illustrated.", 
    "38": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the imidazobenzodiazepine RO15-4513, a partial inverse agonist at benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors, on the stimulant and depressant actions of ethanol in mice. For comparative purposes, another BDZ inverse agonist, FG-7142, was examined as well. Neither RO15-4513 nor FG-7142 influenced the low-dose excitatory effects of ethanol on spontaneous locomotor activity. However, both RO15-4513 and FG-7142 significantly antagonized the depressant effects of ethanol, and this antagonism was completely reversed by pretreatment with the BDZ receptor antagonist, RO15-1788. These data suggest that RO15-4513 is capable of antagonizing only some of the behavioral effects of ethanol, and in particular, those responses to ethanol that are mediated by modulation of the GABA/BDZ-chloride channel receptor complex.", 
    "39": "By use of a simple anticonflict procedure (Vogel test), it was demonstrated that L-pyroglutamic acid (L-pyrrolidone carboxylic acid [L-PCA]), an amino acid naturally occurring in mammalian tissues and fluids, possesses anxiolytic activity. This tissues and fluids, possesses anxiolytic activity. This effect was stereospecific (D-PCA was inactive) and, in the rat, it was not associated with a decrease in motor activity. Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine antagonist, did not modify L-PCA actions. Furthermore, anxiolytic doses of the amino acid did not change the content of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the rat cortex and hippocampus. These results suggest that the mechanism of the anxiolytic activity of L-PCA is different from that of the benzodiazepines and of 5-HT1a agonists.", 
    "40": "BN and other peptides increase grooming activity in rodents. This increase in grooming activity caused by BN can be reversed by numerous agents. The most direct of these are BN receptor antagonists such as spantide and [D-Phe-12]BN. These agents reverse the increase in grooming activity caused by BN and inhibit binding to central BN receptors. The increase in grooming activity caused by BN may be mediated by other neurotransmitters, such as dopamine. In this regard the increase in grooming activity caused by BN is reversed by fluphenazine and haloperidol. These agents do not affect binding to central BN receptors. Similarly, the increase in grooming caused by BN is absent if dopamine-containing neurons are lesioned with 6-OHDA. These lesions cause a significant reduction in central BN receptors, especially in the central amygdaloid nucleus. Thus some of the BN receptors may be present on dopamine-containing neurons. The increase in grooming activity caused by BN was also reversed by diazepam and chlordiazepoxide. Neither of these agents affected binding to central BN receptors, and similarly, BN did not affect binding to central benzodiazepine receptors. Thus anxiolytics may act at a site anatomically downstream from the BN receptor and reduce the apparent stress caused by central injection of BN.", 
    "41": "Asperlicin (ASP), a new, nonpeptidal cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist isolated from the fungus Aspergillus alliaceus, has an affinity that is 300-400 times greater than that of proglumide for gallbladder, ileal, and pancreatic CCK receptors. The long in vivo half-life and high selectivity for peripheral CCK receptors make ASP suitable for investigations on the physiological and pharmacological actions of CCK. Endogenous CCK has been postulated to participate in the pathogenesis of acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis (AHP) in rats and mice. We examined the effects of ASP in rats on the early course (6 h) of AHP induced by a retrograde infusion of sodium taurocholate (NaTC) into the common bile-pancreatic duct. An i.v. bolus injection of ASP (either 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) given 1 h prior to AHP induction failed to significantly alter pancreas weights, serum amylase concentrations, or pancreatic histopathology when compared with AHP control rats treated with vehicle alone. However, rats given 2 i.p. injections of ASP (either 20 mg/kg/injection or 40 mg/kg/injection) in DMSO: olive oil 1 h before and 2 h after induction of AHP exhibited significantly reduced serum amylase concentrations. Additionally, rats given the high dose i.p. injections of ASP also had significantly reduced pancreas weights and less severe pancreas histopathology compared with AHP control animals. These data indicate that endogenous CCK participates in the pathogenesis of NaTC-induced AHP in the rat.", 
    "42": "We examined the effect of L364718, a new cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist, on amylase release stimulated by CCK or different secretagogues in isolated rat pancreatic acini. L364718 caused a parallel rightward shift of the dose-response curve of CCK8. Schild plots showed a slope of 1.05 +/- 0.15 and a pA2 value of 10.01 +/- 0.31. L364718 inhibited maximally stimulated amylase release by CCK in a dose-dependent manner, with half maximal inhibition (ID50) at 1.7 nM and complete inhibition at 30 nM. Asperlicin, a prototype compound of L364718, also caused dose-dependent inhibition, but L364718 was approximately 400 times more potent than asperlicin (ID50 = 761 nM). L364718 significantly inhibited amylase release in response to CCK33 and CCK8 but had no effect on amylase release stimulated by other receptor secretagogues or agents by passing receptors. The results indicate that L364718 acts as an extremely potent, competitive, and specific antagonist of CCK's action on pancreatic acini.", 
    "43": "By means of a case report about a depressive female patient suffering from clusters of attacks of various psychosomatic disorders associated with anxiety states of different degrees problems of diagnostic classification are discussed with regard to the DSM-III. The subjective experiences of anxiety during the various episodes of the patient's disease are described. A phenomenological difference between fear of death with preserved relation to reality on the one hand and \"calamity anxiety\" with a short-lasting breakdown of reality testing on the other hand is indicated. The neurobiological model of noradrenergic dysregulation is taken on trial to understand the various phenomenons of the disease.", 
    "44": "High-affinity binding sites for benzodiazepines are present in a wide range of tissues other than brain, and appear to be pharmacologically distinct from central nervous system receptors. Binding sites have been reported on rat peritoneal mast cells, but specificity of binding and functional effects have not been addressed in these cells. Using the specific radioligand [3H]-Ro5-4864, which binds to peripheral but not central binding sites, we characterized binding to rat peritoneal mast cells and the related cell line, RBL-1 cells, and effects on granule secretion. Studies in rat peritoneal mast cells disclosed one class of saturable binding sites with a dissociation constant of KD = 5.29 +/- 1.26 nM (mean +/- SE) and maximal binding Bmax = 357 +/- 113 fmol/10(6) cells. Competition studies showed that IC50 for Ro5-4864 was 15.7 nM, for PK11195 was 10.9 nM, for diazepam was 191 nM, and for clonazepam was greater than 10(-5) M. Studies in RBL-1 cells also showed one class of saturable binding sites with KD = 1.11 +/- 0.72 nM and Bmax = 177 +/- 69 fmol/10(6) cells; specificity was similar to peritoneal mast cells. Incubation of peritoneal mast cells with Ro5-4864 (10(-10)-10(-5) M) for 60 min, or with 10(-6) M for 0-60 min, showed no change in histamine or serotonin release either in unstimulated mast cells or those stimulated by compound 48/80 or substance P. Experiments with the fluorescent dye Quin-2 showed no change in free intracellular calcium levels in peritoneal mast cells after incubation with Ro5-4864 ranging from 10(-10) to 10(-6) M.", 
    "45": "Chick brain mRNA was isolated and injected into Xenopus oocytes. This led to the expression in the surface membrane of functional GABA-activated channels with properties reminiscent of vertebrate GABAA channels. The GABA-induced current was analyzed quantitatively under voltage-clamp conditions. Picrotoxin inhibited this current in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 = 0.6 microM. The allosteric modulation of GABA currents by a number of drugs acting at the benzodiazepine binding site was characterized quantitatively. In the presence of the benzodiazepine receptor ligands diazepam and clorazepate, GABA responses were enhanced, and in the presence of the convulsant beta-carboline compound methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), they were depressed. Maximal stimulation of the response elicited by 10 microM GABA was 160% with diazepam and 90% with clorazepate, and maximal inhibition was 42% with DMCM, 30% with methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM), 15% with ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo [1,5a][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (Ro 15-1788), and 12% with ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE). Half-maximal stimulation was observed with 20 nM diazepam and 390 nM clorazepate, respectively, and half-maximal inhibition with 6 nM DMCM. beta-CCM had a similar effect to DMCM, whereas beta-CCE and Ro 15-1788 showed only small inhibition at low concentrations (less than 1 microM). All the tested carboline compounds and Ro 15-1788 showed a biphasic action and stimulated GABA current at concentrations higher than 1 microM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "46": "The rabbit cornea accumulates platelet activating factor (PAF) three hrs after alkali burn. PAF was isolated by HPLC and assayed by platelet aggregation. This bioactivity was blocked by the PAF receptor antagonists BN 52021 and alprazolam. Added PAF increases the chemiluminescence response of the cornea in vitro and BN 52021 inhibits this effect. In vivo experiments show that the synthesis of 5-HETE and 12-HETE is inhibited by the PAF antagonist BN 52021. It is concluded that a metabolic interrelationship may exist between the PAF cycle and the lipoxygenation of arachidonic acid, and that drugs that affect these lipid mediators may modulate the inflammatory response of the anterior segment of the eye.", 
    "47": "Drug naive rat hippocampal slices were incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing 20 nM clonazepam, a concentration approximating those measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of rats treated with high doses of clonazepam which resulted in behavioral hyperexcitability and convulsions upon withdrawal. In the slice, epileptiform activity began within 2 h of incubation in clonazepam. This activity was enhanced upon drug withdrawal. Measured intracellularly, the long-lasting post-spike train afterhyperpolarization was reduced in duration in drug-treated cells whereas just subthreshold antidromic or orthodromic IPSPs were not changed. As some of the hyperexcitability phenomena noted here were similar to those observed in slices taken from rats chronically administered with clonazepam, the technique of long-term in vitro exposure to substances which cause tolerance and dependence may be a useful model of drug withdrawal epilepsy.", 
    "48": "Failure to recognize and treat the psychiatric complications of myocardial infarction (MI) may aggravate the underlying cardiac condition and interfere with its treatment. The timing and manifestations of several distinct psychiatric conditions that commonly accompany the acute phase of MI (anxiety, depression, delirium, and behavioral abnormalities secondary to a person's premorbid character style) will be reviewed. In addition, the importance of psychological risk factors for the development of coronary artery disease (e.g., life stress and the Type A behavior pattern) and the impact of denial on the cardiac patient's condition will be discussed. Management strategies that include nonpharmacologic (i.e., support, reassurance, brief psychotherapy and cardiac rehabilitation) and psychopharmacologic interventions (e.g., the rational use of benzodiazepines, antidepressants and neuroleptic agents) for psychiatric conditions in the MI patient will be provided. Postdischarge issues that occur in both the patient and his or her family are outlined, and the enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation programs is encouraged.", 
    "49": "Anxiety may have deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system in persons who have, or are predisposed to have, cardiovascular disease. Contributing factors consist of the type of anxiety, constitutional characteristics and personality traits. The treatment of anxiety thus has a beneficial effect on patients with cardiovascular disease. However, anxiety reduction through medication, even if it includes subjective improvement in somatic symptoms, should not necessarily be equated with beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system. Three groups of medication used in the treatment of anxiety have different effects. Antidepressants lower psychic anxiety but may have the opposite effect on the cardiovascular system, whereas beta-adrenergic blockers lower sympathetic tone without affecting psychic anxiety. Only benzodiazepines fulfill both functions. Since subjective reports of somatic, including cardiovascular, changes correlate poorly with physiologic changes, assessment of new medications should not rely on self-reported improvement in cardiac symptoms but should include objective measures as well.", 
    "50": "The antiemetic efficacy of a combination of high-dose metoclopramide, methylprednisolone and flunitrazepam was tested in an open pilot study in 30 tumor patients undergoing strongly emetic chemotherapy. 26 of 30 patients (87%) were partially or completely protected from nausea and vomiting. In 11 of 12 patients receiving the strongly emetogenic cytostatic agent cisplatin in a dose of greater than or equal to 50 mg/m2, the gastrointestinal side effects were partially or completely abolished. The antiemetic efficacy of the combination was maintained during subsequent courses of chemotherapy. All patients experienced somnolence after administration of flunitrazepam. Only 2 of 30 patients had a shortlived extrapyramidal reaction. The combination of high-dose metoclopramide, methylprednisolone and flunitrazepam is an effective antiemetic treatment and should be considered as first-line antiemetic treatment in patients receiving strongly emetic cancer chemotherapy.", 
    "51": "A reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method is described which allows the quantification of flurazepam and five of its metabolites with a single, isocratic determination. In addition, it has the advantage of possessing a low detection limit and high precision. A 2 mm I.D. column was used to minimize sample size (50 microliter), increase sensitivity and reduce solvent consumption. The method was used to demonstrate that N-1-desalkylflurazepam, the major metabolite, has a short half-life in the rat in contrast to its prolonged life in humans.", 
    "52": "The benzodiazepine [3H]Ro 5-4864 bound specifically and saturably to an apparently homogenous, univalent species of binding site on the calmodulin molecule with an associated equilibrium dissociation rate constant (Kd) of 644 +/- 121 nM. The rates of association (K1) and dissociation (K-1) governing this interaction were estimated to be 7.66 x 10(3) M-1 sec-1 and 2.9 x 10(-3) sec-1, respectively, yielding a non-equilibrium determination of the Kd to be 379 nM. Such binding of [3H]Ro 5-4864 was protein-, pH-, and temperature-dependent and demonstrated pharmacological selectivity. Only benzodiazepine compounds (chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and Ro 5-4864) inhibited [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to calmodulin with inhibitory equilibrium dissociation constants (Ki) less than 10 microM. The benzodiazepine compounds Ro 15-1788 and flunitrazepam did not displace [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to calmodulin nor did a number of pharmacologically active non-benzodiazepine compounds (Ki values greater than 10 microM). Consideration of the stoichiometry yielded an approximate mole ratio of 0.90:1.0 (Ro 5-4864: calmodulin), suggesting that there is one binding site for Ro 5-4864 per molecule of calmodulin. The data reveal that the binding of [3H]Ro 5-4864 to calmodulin fulfills the major criteria of a ligand binding to a receptor. Such an interaction may underlie some of the pharmacological actions of Ro 5-4864-like compounds.", 
    "53": "Pyridazinyl derivatives of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) have recently been shown to be selective, reversible and competitive GABAA antagonists. Unlike what is observed with all other GABAA antagonists, the affinity of these compounds for the GABAA receptor is not modified by thiocyanate. The chemical structure of these pyridazinyl-GABA derivatives differs from that of other GABAA antagonists by the presence of a free carboxylic group in their structure. We speculated that this could explain their lack of sensitivity to thiocyanate. Consequently, we synthesized three structural analogues of these pyridazinyl-GABA derivatives in which we replaced the free carboxyl group by a cyano group. These compounds displaced [3H]GABA from rat brain membranes and reversed the GABA-induced enhancement of [3H]diazepam binding. However their affinity for the GABAA receptor increased 10- to 20-fold in the presence of thiocyanate. Thus, sensitivity to thiocyanate appears to be related more to the absence of an anionic functional group than to the agonist or antagonist nature of the GABAA ligand.", 
    "54": "Common antiepileptic drugs and agents affecting different neurotransmitter systems were studied against aminophylline (280 mg/kg i.p.)-induced convulsions in mice. All drugs and agents were administered i.p. Diazepam and phenobarbital antagonized the whole seizure pattern and the respective ED50 values for the clonic phase were 3.5 and 62 mg/kg. Valproate at 500 mg/kg protected fewer than 50% of mice against the clonic phase. The remaining antiepileptics (acetazolamide, up to 1,000 mg/kg; carbamazepine and diphenylhydantoin, up to 50 mg/kg; ethosuximide, 500 mg/kg and trimethadione, 400 mg/kg) were totally ineffective in this respect. Propranolol (up to 20 mg/kg), baclofen (20 mg/kg), gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (300 mg/kg), aminooxyacetic acid (20 mg/kg), clonidine (up to 0.2 mg/kg), ketamine (30 mg/kg), atropine (20 mg/kg), papaverine (50 mg/kg) and L-phenylisopropyladenosine (2 mg/kg) did not affect the clonic phase either. Only antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid excitation, 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid and 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid afforded protection against aminophylline-induced clonic seizure activity. The results show that aminophylline convulsions are relatively resistant to antiepileptic drugs and suggest that antagonists of excitatory transmission are potential antiaminophylline drugs.", 
    "55": "[3H]Flunitrazepam (FNZ) binding sites were characterized in homogenates of cat visual cortex during normal postnatal development and following dark rearing from birth. In parallel experiments, the distribution and density of [3H]FNZ binding sites were examined by in vitro autoradiographic or 'scrape' methods. In homogenates, Bmax measurements showed low early values, rising to a peak in receptor density at about 60 days postnatal, followed by a decline in adulthood. At all ages, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) altered the Kd, but not the Bmax of [3H]FNZ binding sites. Kd values showed a general increase with age, parallelled by an increased sensitivity to GABA. Receptor autoradiography revealed that the highest density of [3H]FNZ binding sites was in layer IV of cats of all ages. Deafferentation of extrinsic inputs to the visual cortex by surgical undercutting did not alter this pattern of laminar distribution, indicating that the receptors were associated with intrinsic cortical elements rather than subcortical inputs. Dark rearing had no effect on [3H]FNZ laminar distribution in the visual cortex. The Bmax was higher at 30 days postnatal, but did not differ significantly thereafter. Modulation by GABA was concomitantly higher at 30 days, but lower than normal in dark-reared animals at ages greater than 30 days postnatal. The results are discussed in relation to the normal and abnormal development of GABA receptors in the cat visual cortex.", 
    "56": "Cage convulsant t-butyl bicyclophosphoro[35S]thionate binding activity in rat brain membrane homogenates was solubilized with the zwitterionic detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]propane sulfonate (Chaps) and shown to co-purify with the benzodiazepine--gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex on gel filtration and affinity chromatography. Whereas convulsant binding activity, but not GABA and benzodiazepine receptor binding, was eliminated by solubilization in other detergents like sodium deoxycholate or Triton X-100, or by addition of Triton X-100 to the extracts solubilized in the zwitterionic detergent, convulsant activity was not irreversibly lost or selectively unstable, but could be restored by exchanging the protein back into the detergent Chaps. The GABA-benzodiazepine receptor activity solubilized in Chaps alone, containing convulsant activity, and a sample in Chaps supplemented with Triton X-100 and lacking convulsant activity, did not differ in size as measured by gel filtration column chromatography or by radiation inactivation target size analysis. This suggests that convulsant binding activity does not require any additional protein subunits or other macromolecules nor any unique aggregation state relative to GABA and benzodiazepine receptor binding, and that all three activities reside on the same protein complex. As in intact brain, the target size for convulsant binding activity was 3-5 times that of benzodiazepine binding activity, suggesting that an oligomeric protein structure of the receptor complex with intact strong subunit interactions present in the native membrane environment is needed for convulsant activity, and that this and other properties are more preserved in Chaps than in other detergents.", 
    "57": "The characteristics of benzodiazepine binding sites (affinity, number heterogeneity) were studied on frozen sections of hippocampus of 7 suicides and 5 controls subjects, using biochemical and autoradiographic techniques. 3H flunitrazepam was used as ligand, clonazepam and CL 218,872 as displacing agents. Some neurotransmitters or their derivatives (GABA, catecholamines, hydroxy-indols) were evaluated quantitatively in parallel in the hippocampal tissue by liquid chromatography. We observed mainly an increase in the Ki of CL 218,872 subtype I binding sites in suicides, (7.48 +/- 1.7 to 17.24 +/- 1.7 nM, P less than 0.01), (m +/- SEM) and an increase in % of type I binding sites (30 +/- 4.2 to 42 +/- 2.5, P = 0.01). Among neurotransmitters, only norepinephrine differed significantly between controls and suicides (11.34 +/- 1.9 to 24.34 ng/g tissue, P = 0.02).", 
    "58": "Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was found potently (IC50 = 88 nM) to inhibit [3H]diazepam binding to astrocytes in primary cultures but not to a corresponding preparation of neurons. Based upon this finding and literature data demonstrating a pronounced correlation between the distribution of 'peripheral-type' benzodiazepine receptors and ANP receptors, it is suggested that ANP may be an allosteric regulator of the astrocytic benzodiazepine binding site. Since ANP is known to increase the level of cGMP it was also investigated whether 8-bromoguanosine 3':5' cyclic monophosphate, a permeable cGMP analog, displaced diazepam binding. This was the case, suggesting that cGMP might be involved in the ANP effect on the astrocytic benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "59": "One hundred patients (mean age 59 +/- 10 years) were premedicated with morphine, 0.15 mg/kg, and scopolamine, 0.008 mg/kg. Anesthesia was induced with lorazepam, 50 microg/kg, followed by fentanyl, 50 microg/kg, oxygen and pancuronium, 0.15 mg/kg. Isoflurane was given for short periods before and after cardiopulmonary bypass to 57 patients when hypertension was uncontrolled by addition of fentanyl and/or nitroglycerin. Morphine was used as the sole sedative postoperatively. Patients were interviewed following discharge from the surgical intensive care unit to assess the incidence of operative awareness, and to assess amnesia for events occurring during four preoperative and two postoperative periods of the patients' hospital stay. During three preoperative periods (day of admission, evening before, and morning before operation), 1%, 3%, and 2% of patients had complete amnesia, and 19%, 41%, and 31% had partial amnesia of events. Fifty-five percent of patients exhibited complete, and 34% of patients exhibited partial amnesia to events occurring in the preinduction period. Two patients reported intraoperative awareness (noises, conversation) occurring at the end of the anesthetic. In the two postoperative periods (morning of the day after surgery and intensive care stay), 9% and 15% of patients had complete, and 35% and 47% of patients exhibited partial amnesia. Amnesia was statistically significantly greater in patients over 60 years of age in the preinduction period. Duration of cardiopulmonary bypass did not affect the incidence of amnesia.", 
    "60": "On a residential research ward, the acute effects of placebo, lorazepam (LZ) (1.5-9.0 mg) and meprobamate (MEP) (600-3600 mg) were examined using a within-subject double-blind Latin Square design in nine male subjects with histories of drug abuse. Drug effects were assessed with objective performance tasks, subject estimates of performance, staff ratings of drug effects and subject ratings of drug effects, sleep, mood, drug liking and monetary street value. Generally, both LZ and MEP produced comparable dose-related effects; LZ had a more rapid onset of action and on several measures showed a more shallow dose-response curve than MEP. With LZ, but not MEP, subjects under-estimated the degree to which their performance was impaired and under-rated drug effects as compared to analogous staff ratings. Both drugs produced sedation-like subject ratings of mood and sleep but generally did not produce tranquilization-like ratings. MEP produced subject ratings of drug liking and monetary street value which were equal to or in some cases greater than those of LZ. Relative potency estimations showed that LZ was 510 to 783 times more potent than MEP in producing performance impairment but was only 370 times more potent than MEP in producing subject ratings of drug liking. Overall, these data indicate that the likelihood of abuse of MEP is at least equal to if not greater than that of LZ although LZ may have a greater likelihood of producing adverse behavioral effects such as a performance impairment and under-estimates of the degree of impairment. These data in conjunction with previous results from this laboratory show that the behavioral effects of benzodiazepines can be differentiated from those of other types of sedative/anxiolytics and that MEP displays characteristics of a barbiturate-like profile of action.", 
    "61": "Drug discrimination procedures were used to compare the discriminative stimulus properties of ETOH and volatile inhalants. Mice were trained to discriminate between i.p. injections of ETOH (1 g/kg) and saline in a two-lever operant task. Stimulus generalization was examined after 20-min inhalation exposures to toluene (300-5400 ppm), halothane (500-8000 ppm) and 1,1,1,-trichloroethane (TCE; 125-14000 ppm). Oxazepam (10-30 mg/kg i.p.) also was tested. Concentration- or dose-related increases in ETOH-lever responding were observed with toluene, halothane, TCE and oxazepam. Shared discriminative stimulus properties among toluene, halothane, TCE and ETOH indicate that some volatile inhalants share pharmacological properties with ETOH. Previous research has shown that these inhalants also produce pentobarbital-like discriminative stimulus effects in mice. Thus, at least some inhaled anesthetics and abused solvents have behavioral effects in common with abused central nervous system depressant drugs such as ETOH and barbiturates.", 
    "62": "An experimental model was developed to elucidate the site of presystemic extraction of drugs with incomplete bioavailability due to high extraction after p.o. dosage. Domestic pigs received single i.v. or p.o. doses of midazolam (1 mg/kg) or flurazepam (2 mg/kg), two benzodiazepine derivatives with high presystemic extraction after p.o. dosage. Multiple blood samples were simultaneously drawn from the portal vein and from a systemic vein during 8 hr after dosage. After i.v. administration, both drugs had high systemic serum clearance, averaging 24 ml/min/kg. Area under the serum concentration curve (AUC) for systemic vs. portal sites was nearly identical for midazolam (769 vs. 737 ng/ml x hr); for flurazepam, systemic AUC exceeded portal AUC (1035 vs. 778 ng/ml x hr, P less than .01). After p.o. dosage, the systemic/portal AUC ratio averaged 0.15 for midazolam and 0.11 for flurazepam; for both drugs, portal AUC after p.o. dosage did not differ significantly from systemic AUC after i.v. administration. Thus, the extensive presystemic extraction of orally administered midazolam and flurazepam are mainly attributable to hepatic biotransformation rather than metabolism either within the gastrointestinal tract or during absorption into the portal circulation.", 
    "63": "Previous studies which demonstrated an intestinal secretion of quaternary ammonium compounds in the jejunum were extended to nonquaternary amines. Telenzepine and pirenzepine, two structurally similar compounds differing in lipid solubility, were administered either to the lumen or blood side of isolated mucosae of guinea pig jejunum and colon mounted in a flux chamber. Transepithelial permeation of both drugs from blood to lumen side was 3.2 to 18 times higher than in the reverse, absorptive direction. The indicated net secretion was highest with telenzepine in the colon. At 7 degrees C transepithelial permeation was restricted to paracellular shunt fluxes. In the colon, the highest cellular concentrations were observed after blood side administration of telenzepine and pirenzepine (500 and 150% of that of the incubation solution). At 7 degrees C these values were reduced to 1 of 5 and 1 of 8 of the values at 37 degrees C. At pH 6.6, 7.4 or 8.2, no differences in the colonic secretion of telenzepine were seen; cellular concentration increased with increasing pH only after luminal administration. Under all conditions, the colon acidified the luminal solution by roughly 0.4 pH units. Phenoxybenzamine, shown previously to inhibit the jejunal secretion of quaternary ammonium compounds, inhibited the secretion of pirenzepine and telenzepine in both gut segments, but did not affect blood-to-lumen permeation of N-methylscopolamine in the colon. In addition, phenoxybenzamine reduced the cellular content in the colon but had little or no effect on pirenzepine or telenzepine content in the jejunum. The results are consistent with a model in which the nonquaternary amines are secreted in the jejunum by two serial transport steps specific for the base cations; an additional diffusion of the free bases is of importance in the basolateral membrane. In the colon, carrier-mediated influx increases with lipophilicity of the base cations, whereas efflux across the brush border is limited to diffusion of the free bases; concomitant luminal acidification and formation of base cations maintains the diffusion gradient.", 
    "64": "High-affinity muscarinic cholinergic receptors were detected in myelin purified from rat brain stem with use of the radioligands 3H-N-methylscopolamine (3H-NMS), 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate (3H-QNB), and 3H-pirenzepine. 3H-NMS binding was also present in myelin isolated from corpus callosum. In contrast, several other receptor types, including alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, present in the starting brain stem, were not detected in myelin. Based on Bmax values from Scatchard analyses, 3H-pirenzepine, a putative M1 selective ligand, bound to about 25% of the sites in myelin labeled by 3H-NMS, a nonselective ligand that binds to both M1 and M2 receptor subtypes. Agonist affinity for 3H-NMS binding sites in myelin was markedly decreased by Gpp(NH)p, indicating that a major portion of these receptors may be linked to a second messenger system via a guanine-nucleotide regulatory protein. Purified myelin also contained adenylate cyclase activity; this activity was stimulated several fold by forskolin and to small but significant extents by prostaglandin E1 and the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. Myelin adenylate cyclase activity was inhibited by carbachol and other muscarinic agonists; this inhibition was blocked by the antagonist atropine. Levels in myelin of muscarinic receptors were 20-25% and those of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase 10% of the values for total particulate fraction of whole brain stem. These levels in myelin are appreciably greater than would be predicted on the basis of contamination. Also, additional receptors and adenylate cyclase, added by mixing nonmyelin tissue with whole brain stem, were quantitatively removed during the purification procedure. In conclusion, both M1 and M2 muscarinic receptor subtypes and an adenylate cyclase system linked to at least some of these receptors are present as intrinsic components of myelin. The possibility that some of these muscarinic receptors may be involved in regulation of phosphinositide metabolism and the protein kinase activities of myelin is considered.", 
    "65": "Large doses of triazolam repeatedly induced brief episodes of mania in a depressed elderly woman. Features of organic mental disorder (delirium) were not present. Manic excitement was coincident with the duration of action of triazolam. The possible contribution of the triazolo group to changes in affective status is discussed.", 
    "66": "The muscarinic antagonist 1-[benzilic 4,4'-3H]-quinuclidinyl benzilate [3H]-QNB) bound to a single class of non-cooperative sites in calf cerebral cortex membranes (KD = 0.29 nM and Bmax = 1.06 pM/mg protein). Computer-assisted analysis of the shallow pirenzepine/[3H]-QNB competition binding curves indicated that 68% of these sites were of the M1-subtype and the remaining 32% of the M2 subtype. Respective Ki-values for pirenzepine were 27 nM and 1.14 microM. Binding characteristics of the antagonist atropine and of the agonist carbachol for M2 were evaluated by performing competition binding with 0.5 nM [3H]-QNB in the presence of 2 microM pirenzepine. The binding characteristics for the M1 receptors were obtained indirectly by subtracting the curve for M2 from the total curve, or directly by competition binding with 0.3 nM [3H]-pirenzepine. Atropine competition curves were steep for M1 and M2 and were not affected by 1 mM GTP nor by 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide. The carbachol competition curve was shallow for M2. The steep curves for M1 indicate that this receptor subclass was only composed of low agonist affinity sites. GTP, which caused a rightward shift and a steepening of the carbachol competition curve for M2, did not affect the curves for M1. N-ethylmaleimide provoked a leftward shift and a steepening of the carbachol competition curve for M2 and abolished GTP modulation. A leftward shift was also observed for M1, but of a smaller magnitude (i.e. 3-4-fold for M1 compared to 17-fold for M2). These data suggest that, in calf brain cortex, M1 and M2 receptors show different susceptibility towards GTP and N-ethylmaleimide modulation.", 
    "67": "The spectrum ranges from fearful concerns about illness to clinical anxiety disorders, such as phobias, panic attacks, generalized anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and adjustment disorder. Anxiety and fear are often associated with hospitalization, heart disease, insomnia, and somatopsychic syndromes. Determining the cause of the anxiety may help the physician plan the treatment approach. In selected cases, benzodiazepines are useful adjuncts to therapy.", 
    "68": "The effects of acoustic stress (AS) on gastrointestinal motility and their prevention by previous treatment with naloxone, phentolamine, propranolol, muscimol, and diazepam were investigated in intact and vagotomized fasted dogs fitted with chronically implanted strain gauges on the antrum at 10 cm from pylorus and on the jejunum at 70 and 140 cm from the pylorus. These effects were compared to those produced by intracerebroventricular administration of ovine corticotropin releasing factor (oCRF). Beginning 40-50 min after the occurrence of a gastric migrating motor complex (MMC), a 1-hr hearing of prerecorded intense music through earpieces (less than 100 dB) delayed the occurrence of the next gastric MMC observed after 2.8 +/- 1.2 hr, while jejunal MMC were still present at a normal frequency. During AS, heart rate and plasma cortisol were significantly increased by 32.7 and 215%, respectively, 10-15 min after the beginning of hearing. The AS-induced lengthening of the gastric MMC cycle as well as cortisol increase were abolished after previous administration of diazepam (0.5 mg/kg intramuscular) or muscimol (10 micrograms/kg intravenous), while they were still present after naloxone (0.1 mg/kg intravenous), phentolamine (0.2 mg/kg intravenous), or propranolol (0.1 mg/kg intravenous). CRF administered intracerebroventricularly (100 ng/kg) also delayed the occurrence of gastric MMC without affecting jejunal motility, and this effect was not antagonized by previous treatment with diazepam or muscimol. Both the effects of AS and CRF were abolished after bilateral thoracic vagotomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The drug was dissolved in the vehicle of 0.01 mol/l HCl solution for intravenous administration or for addition to the bath medium and was suspended in 0.25% carboxymethylcellulose solution for oral administration. In unanesthetized rabbits, zopiclone, 0.5 mg/kg i.v., exerted no action and at 1 mg/kg slightly decreased respiration and heart rate without affecting blood pressure and ECG. Zopiclone at 10(-6) g/ml had no action in the isolated guinea-pig atria but at 10(-5) g/ml it produced a gradual and slight decrease in heart rate without affecting the contraction. In the isolated small intestine of rabbits and guinea-pigs, zopiclone at 10(-6) g/ml had no action but produced a slight inhibition in a dose of 10(-5) g/ml. Zopiclone, 10(-5) g/ml, did not affect the stimulatory effects of acetylcholine, serotonin, histamine and barium in the isolated guinea-pig intestine. Zopiclone, 1, 5 and 10 mg/kg i.v., exerted no action on rabbit intestinal movement in vivo. Zopiclone, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mg/kg p.o., had no effect on the propulsive motility of the mouse intestine. Zopiclone, 10(-5) g/ml, did not affect contractile movement of the uterus isolated from rabbits and did not influence the contractile response to epinephrine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "70": "Effects of diazepam on the pacemaker activity and atrial contractility were investigated using the isolated and blood-perfused canine atrium. When diazepam in a dose range of 3-300 micrograms was injected directly into the sinus node artery, biphasic (negative followed by positive) chrono- and inotropic responses were dose-relatedly evoked. These responses were not affected by atropine in a dose which blocked ACh-induced negative ones. Propranolol inhibited positive chrono- and inotropic responses to diazepam, and prolonged the duration of the negative responses. Imipramine, in a dose which blocked tyramine-induced positive responses, significantly augmented the positive inotropic responses to diazepam. From these results, it is suggested that diazepam induces direct negative chrono- and inotropic effects, the mechanism of which remains to be defined, and indirect positive effects by catecholamine release from the sympathetic nerve terminals, though not mediated by a tyramine-like action. Diazepam tended to potentiate negative chrono- and inotropic effects of adenosine but not significantly, suggesting that diazepam plays a minor role as an adenosine potentiator in the dog right atrium.", 
    "71": "The quality of recovery from general anaesthesia for day-case surgery is assessed by the Trailmaking test in a randomized study of 100 women scheduled for termination of pregnancy on an outpatients basis. All patients are in ASA group I or II. Recovery following diazepam-ketamine based anaesthesia is compared to that following fentanyl-methohexital based anaesthesia. In group A, 5 min after intravenous injection of diazepam (0,2 mg.kg-1), anaesthesia is induced with ketamine (1 mg.kg-1). If necessary, in response to spontaneous movement, for maintenance of anaesthesia, 1 or 2 supplementary doses of ketamine (0,5 mg.kg-1) are administered. In group B, 5 min after intravenous injection of fentanyl (1 microgram.kg-1), anaesthesia is induced with methohexital (2 mg.kg-1). If necessary, in response to spontaneous movement, for maintenance of anaesthesia, 1 or 2 supplementary doses of methohexital (0,7 mg.kg-1) are administered. The quality of recovery is assessed by Trailmaking test 1/2 h and 1 h after surgery and compared with pre-anaesthetic score. The two groups are comparable with regard to age, weight, educational level and average duration of anaesthesia. In group A, the mean score for the two parts of the test is not significantly different 1 h after surgery from the pre-anaesthetic score. In group B, the mean score for the two parts of the test is not significantly different 1/2 h after surgery than the pre-anaesthetic score. This better post-anesthetic score is explained by a learning effect of the test when used several times.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "72": "Brain muscarinic M1 and M2 binding sites, as defined by their affinity for pirenzepine, were studied in 24 regions of 3 normal control brains. For each region, the binding of [3H]QNB, a non-subtype selective antagonist, was saturable with a mean KD of 0.117 +/- 0.066 nM. Computer-assisted analysis of the pirenzepine competition binding curves yielded the amount of high affinity (M1) and low affinity sites (M2) as well as their respective Ki values for this ligand. The neocortex contained a mixed population of 67% M1 and 33% M2 sites, without locoregional heterogeneity. The muscarinic receptors of the caudate nucleus, putamen, pallidum, hippocampus and nucleus amygdalis were predominantly of the M1 type as well. The cerebellum and the brain-stem are examples of regions containing over 90% M2 sites. White matter structures like the centrum ovale appeared to contain low concentrations of [3H]QNB binding sites, predominantly of the M1 subtype. The data for the frontal cortex were compared with data obtained in 3 patients who died from Alzheimer's disease with very early onset: the muscarinic receptor concentrations were somewhat lower but their M1/M2 ratio remained unchanged. GTP caused an appreciable rightward shift and steepening of the carbachol competition binding curve in M2 predominant regions such as the pons, whereas only a slight shift was observed in the cortex. In the presence of GTP, the alkylating reagent N-ethylmaleimide caused a 35-fold increase of the affinity for carbachol in M2 predominant regions. In contrast, regions where the receptors are predominantly of the M1 type, N-ethylmaleimide caused only a 5-fold increase in agonist affinity. These findings confirm our previously formulated hypothesis that the ability of N-ethylmaleimide to modulate the agonist affinity is an additional criterion for the characterization of M1 and M2-type receptors.", 
    "73": "1. The single dose pharmacokinetics of N-desmethylclobazam (NDMC) and clobazam were studied in eight healthy male volunteers. 2. Steady-state pharmacokinetic data are described from four healthy male volunteers and eight epileptic patients taking NDMC. 3. A single 30 mg dose of NDMC produced a greater Cmax (P less than 0.001) and AUC0-infinity (P less than 0.005) and a shorter tmax (P less than 0.05) and t1/2 (P less than 0.01) for NDMC than did 30 mg clobazam. 4. Mean steady-state NDMC concentrations were greater in male patients than in female patients and also in male patients compared with male volunteers. The differences between patients and volunteers might be explained by concomitant antiepileptic medication.", 
    "74": "1. The first step in the interaction between oxaprozin glucuronide and human serum albumin (HSA) is formation of a reversible complex which then leads to the following reactions; (a) acyl migration of the aglycone from position 1 to positions 2, 3 and 4 of the glucuronic acid moiety; (b) hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond; and (c) covalent binding of oxaprozin to the HSA molecule. The isomers of oxaprozin glucuronide formed in (a) and the covalently bonded drug in (c) are also hydrolyzed to oxaprozin. 2. Oxaprozin and ligands known to bind at Site II as classified by Sudlow et al. (1976), also called the benzodiazepine binding site (M\u00fcller and Wollert 1975), inhibit these reactions with oxaprozin glucuronide, while ligands which are known to bind at other sites on HSA do not. 3. Modification of a single tyrosine residue, located within Site II, with tetranitromethane, diisopropylfluorophosphate, and p-nitrophenylacetate causes significant reduction of the covalent binding of oxaprozin to HSA. 4. Tetranitromethane modification of HSA decreases all three reactions, while not inhibiting the formation of the reversible complex, indicating that the tyrosine located in Site II (tyr-411)acts as the nucleophile in these reactions. 5. Chemical modification of lysine residues has only a small effect on the reactions while modification of the lone free sulphhydryl (cys) in HSA has no effect.", 
    "75": "The authors discuss the case of four patients aged over 75 years who presented non-convulsive, but confusional status epilepticus. The EEG recordings during clinical status showed bilateral spikes of slow wave discharges in the frontal region. Following slow intravenous infusion of 10 mg of diazepam, EEG and clinical status returned quickly to normal. CT scans were always unremarkable. The ictal confusion in later life seems to be an entity, actually frequently reported in literature, which needs better description."
