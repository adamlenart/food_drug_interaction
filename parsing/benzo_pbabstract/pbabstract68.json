This process in turn leads to Cl(-) influx upon activation of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA ) receptors and the canonical hyperpolarising inhibitory postsynaptic potential. Several neurological disorders are treated with drugs that target and enhance GABAA receptor signaling, including the commonly used benzodiazepine diazepam and the anesthetic propofol. Some of these disorders are also associated with deficits in GABAA signaling and become less sensitive to therapeutic drugs that target GABAA receptors. To date, it is unknown if alterations in the neuronal Cl(-) gradient affect the efficacies of diazepam and propofol. We therefore used the in vitro model of glutamate-induced hyperexcitability to test if alterations in the Cl(-) gradient affect the efficacy of GABAA modulators. We exclusively utilised the gramicidin perforated-patch-clamp configuration to preserve the endogenous Cl(-) gradient in rat neurons. Brief exposure to glutamate reduced the inhibitory efficacy of diazepam within 5 min, which was caused by the collapse of the Cl(-) gradient, and not due to reductions in GABAA receptor number. Unlike diazepam, propofol retained its efficacy by shunting the membrane conductance despite the glutamate-induced appearance of depolarising GABAA -mediated currents. Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of K(+) -Cl(-) cotransporter type 2 by furosemide disrupted Cl(-) homeostasis and reduced the efficacy of diazepam but not propofol. Collectively our results suggest that pathological hyperexcitable conditions could cause the rapid accumulation of intracellular Cl(-) and the appearance of depolarising GABAA -mediated currents that would decrease the efficacy of diazepam.", 
    "1": "A simple, rapid, and sensitive method based on dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction combined with HPLC-UV detection applied for the quantification of chlordiazepoxide in some real samples. The effect of different extraction conditions on the extraction efficiency of the chlordiazepoxide drug was investigated and optimized using central composite design as a conventional efficient tool. Optimum extraction condition values of variables were set as 210 \u03bcL chloroform, 1.8 mL methanol, 1.0 min extraction time, 5.0 min centrifugation at 5000 rpm min(-1), neutral pH, 7.0% w/v NaCl. The separation was reached in less than 8.0 min using a C18 column using isocratic binary mobile phase (acetonitrile/water (60:40, v/v)) with flow rate of 1.0 mL min(-1) The linear response (r(2) > 0.998) was achieved in the range of 0.005-10 \u03bcg mL(-1) with detection limit 0.0005 \u03bcg mL(-1) The applicability of this method for simultaneous extraction and determination of chlordiazepoxide in four different matrices (water, urine, plasma, and chlordiazepoxide tablet) were investigated using standard addition method. Average recoveries at two spiking levels were over the range of 91.3-102.5% with RSD < 5.0% (n = 3). The obtained results show that dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction combined with HPLC-UV is a fast and simple method for the determination of chlordiazepoxide in real samples.",

In the case of any significant change, the cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptor antagonists (AM251 and SR144528) were administered i.p. 30\u00a0min prior to the injection of sesamol, amitriptyline or flurazepam.", 
    "5": "Following the chronic treatment, sesamol, similar to amitriptyline, resulted in the sustained elevation of NGF and eCB contents in dose-dependent and brain region-specific fashion. Neither acute nor chronic treatment with flurazepam altered brain NGF or eCB contents. Pretreatment with 3\u00a0mg/kg AM251, but not SR144528, prevented the elevation of NGF protein levels.

    "7": "The task of finding selective and stable peptide receptor agonists with low molecular weight, desirable pharmacokinetic properties and penetrable to the blood-brain barrier has proven too difficult for many highly coveted drug targets, including receptors for endothelin, vasoactive intestinal peptide and galanin. These receptors and ligand-gated ion channels activated by structurally simple agonists such as glutamate, glycine and GABA present such a narrow chemical space that the design of subtype-selective molecules capable of distinguishing a dozen of glutamate and GABA receptor subtypes and possessing desirable pharmacokinetic properties has also been problematic. In contrast, the pharmaceutical industry demonstrates a remarkable success in developing 1,4-benzodiazepines, positive allosteric modulators (PMAs) of the GABAA receptor. They were synthesized over 50 years ago and discovered to have anxiolytic potential through an in vivo assay. As exemplified by Librium, Valium and Dormicum, these allosteric ligands of the receptor became the world's first blockbuster drugs. Through molecular manipulation over the past 2 decades, including mutations and knockouts of the endogenous ligands or their receptors, and by in-depth physiological and pharmacological studies, more peptide and glutamate receptors have become well-validated drug targets for which an agonist is sought. In such cases, the pursuit for PAMs has also intensified, and a working paradigm to identify drug candidates that are designed as PAMs has emerged. This review, which focuses on the general principles of finding PAMs of peptide receptors in the 21st century, describes the workflow and some of its resulting compounds such as PAMs of galanin receptor 2 that act as potent anticonvulsant agents.", 
    "8": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE)(1) is a neuropsychiatric disorder caused by chronic or acute liver failure. Nearly thirty years ago a hypothesis was formulated explaining the neuropathology of HE by increased GABAergic tone. Recent progress in the GABAA-receptor (GABAAR) molecular pharmacology and biochemistry as well as the physiology of GABAergic transmission provided better understanding of GABA's role in health and disease. A detailed analysis of neuronal populations and their GABAergic afferents affected in HE is still missing. The slow progress in understanding the pathology of GABAergic transmission in HE is due to the high complexity of brain circuitries controlled by multiple types of GABAergic interneurons and the large variety of GABAAR, which are differently affected by pathological conditions and not yet fully identified. The mechanisms of action of the GABAAR agonist taurine, allosteric positive modulators (inhibitory neurosteroids, anaesthetics, benzodiazepines and histamine) and inhibitors of the GABAAR (excitatory neurosteroids, Ro15-4513) are discussed with respect to HE pathophysiology. Perspectives for GABAergic drugs in the symptomatic treatment of HE are suggested.", 
    "9": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severely disabling anxiety disorder that may occur following exposure to a serious traumatic event. It is a psychiatric condition that can afflict anyone who has experienced a life-threatening or violent event. Previous studies have shown that changes in 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) expression (or function), a promising target for treating neurological disorders without benzodiazepine-like side effects, may correlate with PTSD. However, few studies have investigated the anti-PTSD effects of TSPO ligands. AC-5216, a ligand for TSPO, induces anxiolytic- and anti-depressant-like effects in animal models. The present study aimed to determine whether AC-5216 ameliorates PTSD behavior in mice. Following the training session consisting of exposure to inescapable electric foot shocks, animals were administered AC-5216 daily during the behavioral assessments, i.e., situational reminders (SRs), the open field (OF) test, the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test, and the staircase test (ST). The results indicated that exposure to foot shocks induced long-term behavioral deficiencies in the mice, including freezing and anxiety-like behavior, which were significantly ameliorated by repeated treatment with AC-5216 but without any effect on spontaneous locomotor activity or body weight. In summary, this study demonstrated the anti-PTSD effects of AC-5216 treatment, suggesting that TSPO may represent a therapeutic target for anti-PTSD drug discovery and that TSPO ligands may be a promising new class of drugs for the future treatment of PTSD.",

Even though daily interruption of sedatives and opioids is appropriate in medical intensive care unit (ICU) patients, it may not be feasible in the surgical patients with pain from surgical incision or trauma. Therefore we developed an analgesia/sedation based protocol for the surgical ICU population.",

The pre-ASP group was sedated as usual (n = 100) and the post-ASP group was managed with the new ASP (n = 100). Each phase of the study lasted for 5 mo. Comparisons between the two groups were performed by \u03c7(2) or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney test for nonparametric variables.

The samples were analysed for alcohol, amphetamine, benzodiazepines, cocaine, MDMA, opiates, \u03b3-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), ketamine, methadone and methylmethcathinone (the 4-isomer of which is known as mephedrone). The results were interpreted with respect to the number and type of drugs of abuse detected and the concentrations measured. Alcohol was quantified in 113 cases (30%), and of these a level in excess of the prescribed UK limit for driving of 80\u00a0mg% was present in 90 cases. In 80 cases, only the concentration of alcohol was measured, the concentrations of both drugs and alcohol were measured in 33 cases. In the remaining 263 cases, only the concentrations of relevant drugs of abuse were measured. The most common drug of abuse quantified was cocaine which was detected in 92 cases, either as the active drug or as its major metabolite benzoylecgonine, followed by diazepam which was quantified in 76 cases. Concentrations of some new drugs, and drugs rarely reported in driving under the influence cases are also presented.", 
    "15": "Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a rare sporadic neurocutaneous syndrome defined by the association of a facial capillary malformation in the ophthalmic distribution of the trigeminal nerve, with ipsilateral vascular glaucoma and vascular malformation of the eye, and a leptomeningeal angioma. SWS is suspected at birth in the presence of facial angioma in the trigeminal nerve area. MRI with gadolinium enhancement and pondered T1, T2, FLAIR and diffusion sequences is today the technique of choice to visualize the leptomeningeal angioma or to suspect it by indirect signs, even before the development of neurological signs, from the first months of life. The prognosis of SWS with leptomeningeal angioma is related to the severity of neurological signs that are absent at birth and develop later in life (epilepsy, hemiparesis, and mental delay). Seizures are usually the presenting neurological symptom. Status epilepticus might inaugurate the epilepsy and remains frequent in infancy. Repetitive seizures are thought to increase the atrophy of brain tissue in regard to the leptomeningeal angioma. Preventive presymptomatic treatment with antiepileptic drugs is often recommended, and parents are trained to use rescue benzodiazepines in case of seizures. After epilepsy onset, in patients intractable to antiepileptic drugs, surgery should be considered.", 
    "16": "Angelman syndrome combines severe mental retardation, epilepsy, ataxia, speech impairment, and unique behavior with happy demeanor, laughing, short attention span, hyperactivity, and sleep disturbance. Occurrence has been calculated at 1:20000 to 1:12000 constituting about 6% of all children with severe mental retardation and epilepsy. The physical \"prototype\" includes microcephaly with flat neck, fair skin and hair, wide-spaced teeth, and open mouth with tongue protrusion. Epilepsy is characterized by atypical absences, erratic myoclonus, and occasional tonic-clonic seizures. EEG demonstrates high-amplitude 2-3Hz delta activity with spike and slow-wave discharges and sleep-activated generalized epileptiform discharges. Sodium valproate, benzodiazepines, and priacetam are frequently used and effective. Development is generally slow, the majority attaining independent walking in the first 2.5-6 years. Vocabulary is limited to a few single words with superior speech and object apprehension. The condition is due to a lack of expression of the UBE3A gene on chromosome 15q. Maternal deletions of 15q11-13 produce the most pronounced phenotype (65-70% of probands), uniparental disomy and imprinting center mutations (10%), and UBE3A point mutations (11%) produce milder phenotypes.", 
    "17": "Symptomatic treatment of cerebral palsy (CP) is difficult, with variable beneficial effect. The choice of therapy is guided by the main clinical features (spasticity, dystonia/choreoathetosis), by the experience of experts, and by the results of open-label trials and a few controlled studies. Treatments of spasticity are not discussed in depth here. From open-label trials and a few controlled studies in dystonia/choreoathetosis CP, it appears that treatment should be started at a low dose and increased slowly, and that more beneficial effects are obtained on upper extremity function, face and jaw dystonia and drooling, and in children. L-Baclofen or antiepileptic drugs are rarely effective and poorly tolerated whereas benzodiazepines may be moderately helpful. Local injections of botulinum toxin help to reduce pain and limit the amplitude of some movements (violent neck movements with high risk of symptomatic radiculomyelopathy). In a rare subtype of dystonia-choreathetosis CP with little spasticity and MRI lesions, bilateral pallidal stimulation (GPi) has shown mild to moderate improvement of dystonia (in open-label small series and in one controlled study) with no cognitive or mood adverse effects. Optimal placement of the leads was a major (but not exclusive) factor for good outcome but results cannot be predicted on an individual basis and larger studies are needed.",

    "28": "There was significantly more sedation in the diazepam group than in the gabapentin group. However, there was less subjective anxiety in the gabapentin group than in the control group. There was a significant fall in intraocular pressure (IOP) and significant reduction in mean arterial pressure in the gabapentin group compared with the control group. Perioperatively, significantly more supplementation with intravenous midazolam was given in the control group than in the gabapentin group. A significantly larger number of patients in the gabapentin group scored a postanaesthesia recovery score of 10 compared with the control group. There was a statistically significant difference in the postoperative visual analogue scale scores for pain and number of analgesic requests with gabapentin scoring over diazepam in this regard.",

    "30": "For economic reasons, the generic substitution of branded medications is common and welcome. These replacements are based on the concept of bioequivalence, which is considered equal to therapeutic equivalence. Regulatory standards for bioequivalence require the 90 % confidence intervals of group averages of pharmacokinetic measures of a generic and the original drug to overlap within \u00b120 %. However, therapeutic equivalence has been challenged for several psychotropic agents by retrospective studies and case reports. To evaluate the degree of bioequivalence and therapeutic equivalence of branded and generic psychotropic drugs, we performed an electronic search (from database inception until 24 May 2012 and without language restrictions) in PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Search terms were \"(generic) AND (psychotropic OR psychoactive OR antipsychotic OR antiepileptic OR antidepressant OR stimulant OR benzodiazepine)\" or the respective individual substances. We included clinical studies, regardless of design, comparing branded with generic psychotropic drug formulations, identifying 35 such studies. We also included case reports/series reporting on outcomes after a switch between brand and generic psychotropics, identifying 145 clinical cases. Bioequivalence studies in healthy controls or animals, in-vitro studies, and health economics studies without medical information were excluded. An overview of the few randomized controlled studies supports that US FDA regulations assure clinically adequate drug delivery in the majority of patients switched from brand to generic. However, with a growing number of competing generic products for one substance, and growing economic pressure to substitute with the currently cheapest generic, frequent generic-generic switches, often unbeknownst to prescribing clinicians, raise concerns, particularly for antiepileptics/mood stabilizers. Generic-generic switches may vary by more than \u00b120 % from each other in individual patients since the pharmacokinetic properties of each generic may differ from the innovator drug in opposing directions. Ideally, therapeutic equivalence studies in addition to pharmacokinetic equivalence studies would be performed for each generic, reflecting the full variability of clinical responses due to changes of pharmacokinetic properties related to age, sex, ethnicity, genetic factors, and body mass index. This is particularly relevant, as bioequivalence studies are based on single-dose studies in healthy controls who are likely not representative of the patients who are prescribed the psychotropic medications. Additionally, individual case reports suggest potential clinical effects during brand-generic switches. Knowledge and consideration of intra-individual variations can help guide the clinical management during brand-generic or generic-generic switch periods. To optimize outcomes, clinicians need to consider that when using generic psychotropic medications, a change in the patient's clinical status can be related to psychological, interactional, physiological, and pharmacological factors that may or may not be related to the change to a generic drug. In addition, throughout all treatment periods, clinicians need to be aware of the currently dispensed product (i.e., branded or exact generic formulation), particularly when evaluating clinical changes in efficacy, tolerability, and adherence. If clinical problems occur, the first response should be an assessment of adherence and a careful dose adjustments of the generic drug rather than an immediate switch back to the originator.", 
    "31": "Exhaled breath has recently been identified as a matrix for the detection of drugs of abuse. This work aims to further document this application using a new and simple collection device in patients following recovery from acute intoxication. Breath, plasma and urine samples were collected from 47 patients (38 males, age range 25-74) together with interview data. Analysis of breath and plasma samples was done by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry methods. Urine was screened using immunochemical reagents and positive findings confirmed with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry methods. The 12 analytes investigated were: methadone, amphetamine, methamphetamine, 6-acetylmorphine, morphine, benzoylecgonine, cocaine, diazepam, oxazepam, alprazolam, buprenorphine and tetrahydrocannabinol. In all 47 cases, recent intake of an abused substance prior to admission was reported, but in one case the substance (ketobemidone) was not investigated. In 40 of the remaining cases (87%) breath analysis gave a positive finding of any of the substances that were part of the analytical investigation. Identifications were based on correct chromatographic retention time and product ion ratios obtained in selected reaction monitoring mode. In general, data from breath, plasma, urine and self-reporting were in good agreement, but in 23% of the cases substances were detected that had not been self-reported. All substances covered were detected in a number of breath samples. Considering that breath sampling was often done about 24 h after intake, the detection rate was considered to be high for most substances. Analytes with low detection rates were benzodiazepines, and a further increase in analytical sensitivity is needed to overcome this. This study further supports use of exhaled breath as a new matrix in clinical toxicology.", 
    "32": "Seizures are a commonly encountered medical problem. Seizure protocols have been shown to be effective by avoiding inappropriate over- and undertreatment, but are not presently utilised in many centres in Australia. We outline a stepwise approach to effective seizure management based on timely investigation and escalating treatment with an appropriate choice of medications. Because large-scale clinical trials are lacking, we base our approach on the underlying seizure pathophysiology and the pharmacological properties of the available drugs. Early management consists of finding and correcting possible reversible causes and ensuring patient safety. With ongoing seizure length, spontaneous resolution becomes unlikely, necessitating administration of anti-epileptic drugs. Benzodiazepines are the agents of first choice, with a preference of short-acting drugs. With ongoing seizures, other agents (i.e. valproate, levetiracetam, phenobarbitone, phenytoin) are utilised. Refractory status epilepticus requires aggressive treatment in an intensive care setting. Novel approaches and agents, including ketamine, topiramate, lacosamide, pregabalin and intravenous immunoglobulins, are discussed. We provide our own recently developed hospital protocol as a guide. This protocol relies on a time-based four-step escalating approach to seizure management, ranging from supportive management of the initial simple seizure to the use of multiple agents for established status epilepticus.",

    "37": "In this Part II psychiatric disorders coexisting with organic diseases are discussed. \"Comorbidity phenomenon\" defines the not univocal interrelation between medical illnesses and psychiatric disorders, each other negatively influencing morbidity and mortality. Most severe psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression, show increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease, related to poverty, use of psychotropic medication, and higher rate of preventable risk factors such as smoking, addiction, poor diet and lack of exercise. Moreover, psychiatric and organic disorders can develop together in different conditions of toxic substance and prescription drug use or abuse, especially in the emergency setting population. Different combinations with mutual interaction of psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders are defined by the so called \"dual diagnosis\". The hypotheses that attempt to explain the psychiatric disorders and substance abuse relationship are examined: (1) common risk factors; (2) psychiatric disorders precipitated by substance use; (3) psychiatric disorders precipitating substance use (self-medication hypothesis); and (4) synergistic interaction. Diagnostic and therapeutic difficulty concerning the problem of dual diagnosis, and legal implications, are also discussed. Substance induced psychiatric and organic symptoms can occur both in the intoxication and withdrawal state. Since ancient history, humans selected indigene psychotropic plants for recreational, medicinal, doping or spiritual purpose. After the isolation of active principles or their chemical synthesis, higher blood concentrations reached predispose to substance use, abuse and dependence. Abuse substances have specific molecular targets and very different acute mechanisms of action, mainly involving dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems, but finally converging on the brain's reward pathways, increasing dopamine in nucleus accumbens. The most common substances producing an addiction status may be assembled in depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines, opiates), stimulants (cocaine, amphetamines, nicotine, caffeine, modafinil), hallucinogens (mescaline, LSD, ecstasy) and other substances (cannabis, dissociatives, inhalants). Anxiety disorders can occur in intoxication by stimulants, as well as in withdrawal syndrome, both by stimulants and sedatives. Substance induced mood disorders and psychotic symptoms are as much frequent conditions in ED, and the recognition of associated organic symptoms may allow to achieve diagnosis. Finally, psychiatric and organic symptoms may be caused by prescription and doping medications, either as a direct effect or after withdrawal. Adverse drug reactions can be divided in type A, dose dependent and predictable, including psychotropic drugs and hormones; and type B, dose independent and unpredictable, usually including non psychotropic drugs, more commonly included being cardiovascular, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic medications.",

Following a report by an emergency-room doctor of an attempted murder, police performed an investigation into all deaths of patients in the nurse's care. Earlier, a medico-legal cause-of-death investigation had been performed on two of these cadavers, but in the other three cases the death certificate had been issued after a medical investigation only. In two of these latter cases, the body had been cremated, but fixed histological samples taken at medical autopsy were available, while in one case the person had died recently and the body was thereafter exhumed and autopsied. All of the suspected victims were older people who required nursing, and the nurse's course of action was consistent in all cases. In the absence of ordinary post-mortem toxicology samples in the medical cases, extraordinary evidence--paraffin-embedded liver tissue samples originally taken for histology at autopsy--was successfully recovered in two cases and analyzed for drugs. In all five cases, drugs not prescribed to the patient were detected, including digoxin, dixyrazine, citalopram, venlafaxine, and benzodiazepines (diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, temazepam, and oxazepam). The nurse was eventually found guilty of five murders by poisoning, five attempted murders, and three aggravated assaults. The nurse was sentenced to life imprisonment.",

We also ascertained whether regions with increased coherence had higher representation in the limbic frontotemporal regions (LFTRs). The highest coherence imaging values and their locations, among 54 Brodmann areas, were determined in six PD patients and six age-matched healthy controls. Magnetoencephalography scans were acquired using 148 magnetometer channels and 32 simultaneous EEG channels. Despite the small sample size, coherence imaging values were significantly higher in PD patients. Brain regions with increased coherence were significantly more in areas typically associated with LFTRs in PD patients when compared with controls. The above data suggest that coherence values may be increased in LFTRs of patients with PD. Recent advances in epilepsy research suggest that increased coherence may reflect increased excitability in these brain regions. On the basis of the data provided here as well as in the available literature, we propose that additional research examining coherence values in LFTRs of PD patients could inform the choice of medication in this patient population, with increased coherence (i.e. increased excitability) being a biomarker for favorable responses to medications that limit excitatory transmission, such as benzodiazepines or antiseizure drugs.", 
    "44": "Schizophrenia is believed to arise from an interaction of genetic predisposition and adverse environmental factors, with stress being a primary variable. We propose that alleviating anxiety produced in response to stress during a sensitive developmental period may circumvent the dopamine (DA) system alterations that may correspond to psychosis in adults. This was tested in a developmental rat model of schizophrenia based on prenatal administration of the mitotoxin methyl azoxymethanol acetate (MAM). MAM administration leads to a hyperdopaminergic state consisting of an increase in the number of DA neurons firing spontaneously, which correlates with an increased behavioral response to amphetamine. MAM-treated rats exhibited a heightened level of anxiety during adolescence. Peripubertal administration of the antianxiety agent diazepam was found to prevent the increase in DA neuron activity and blunt the behavioral hyperresponsivity to amphetamine in these rats. These data suggest that the pathophysiological factors leading to the onset of psychosis in early adulthood may be circumvented by controlling the response to stress during the peripubertal period.", 
    "45": "Malignant migrating partial seizures in infancy (MMPSI) or Coppola-Dulac syndrome is a rare epilepsy syndrome with the onset in the first 6 months of life, characterized by multiple continuous electroencephalographic and electroclinical focal ictal patterns due to the involvement of different independent areas of both hemispheres with the arrest of psychomotor development. This article is based on the personal observations of 19 cases. Four subtypes of the syndrome were determined in our population of infants with MMPSI (n=19): 1) a \"classic\" form with pharmacoresistant migrated status epilepticus (SE) of migrating multifocal seizures, and with absolutely poor prognosis (n=7); 2) a severe pharmacoresistant mixed form (MMPSI + EME) with the combination of electroclinical characteristics of MMPSI with migrating multifocal SE and early myoclonic encephalopathy (n=5); 3) a \"mild\" variant (n=5); 4) a \"subtle\" form (n=2). In basic therapy, drugs of choice are antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) with a wide range of action (valproates, in the combination with barbiturates, benzodiazepines and levetiracetam) and also very old drugs as bromides. The preferred drugs are the valproate forms available for patients with disturbances of swallowing (depakine chronosphere or depakine syrup).", 
    "46": "A 69-year-old woman presented with a nonhealing ulcer on her right cheek. On histological examination of a biopsy, no evidence of granuloma formation or malignancy was found, and the overall picture was felt to be consistent with dermatitis artefacta (DA). The patient was referred to a joint psychodermatology clinic, where treatment with risperidone was started. However, at follow-up the ulcer remained unchanged, and treatment was changed to olanzapine 2.5 mg twice daily. Within 10 months, the large facial ulcer, which had been refractory to treatment for several years, had completely healed. Anxiolytics, antidepressants and low-dose antipsychotics have been shown to be helpful in the management of DA. Successful treatment with olanzapine has been described. The good clinical response to olanzapine may be attributed to its anti-impulsive effect, antihistaminic properties and low risk of parkinsonian side-effects.", 
    "47": "Ring chromosome 14 (r14) is clinically characterized by early-onset epilepsy, mental retardation, delayed speech, microcephaly, extremely mild facial dysmorphisms and ophthalmologic abnormalities. We report a case presenting with partial seizures and delayed development in infancy in which r14 was diagnosed based on chromosomal analysis. The patient was a girl with a normal family and delivery history. Afebrile generalized convulsions developed at age 9 months, and phenobarbital was started, but was changed to zonisamide due to impaired liver function. Chromosome analysis led to a diagnosis of 46, XX, r(14) (p11.2q32.3). At age 5 years, while under treatment with zonisamide and clobazam, epilepsy was characterized by multiple daily episodes of complex partial seizures. Although there are no consistent brain MRI or electroencephalogram findings, experienced pediatric neurologists can make a diagnosis based on facial dysmorphisms. When refractory epilepsy is encountered in infancy with developmental delay of unknown cause, chromosome analysis should be performed.", 
    "48": "A broad forensic screening method for 256 analytes in whole blood based on a fully automated SPE robotic extraction and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) with TOF-MS with data-independent acquisition has been developed. The limit of identification was evaluated for all 256 compounds and 95 of these compounds were validated with regard to matrix effects, extraction recovery, and process efficiency. The limit of identification ranged from 0.001 to 0.1 mg/kg, and the process efficiency exceeded 50% for 73 of the 95 analytes. As an example of application, 1335 forensic traffic cases were analyzed with the presented screening method. Of these, 992 cases (74%) were positive for one or more traffic-relevant drugs above the Danish legal limits. Commonly abused drugs such as amphetamine, cocaine, and frequent types of benzodiazepines were the major findings. Nineteen less frequently encountered drugs were detected e.g. buprenorphine, butylone, cathine, fentanyl, lysergic acid diethylamide, m-chlorophenylpiperazine, 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone, mephedrone, 4-methylamphetamine, p-fluoroamphetamine, and p-methoxy-N-methylamphetamine. In conclusion, using UHPLC-TOF-MS screening with data-independent acquisition resulted in the detection of common drugs of abuse as well as new designer drugs and more rarely occurring drugs. Thus, TOF-MS screening of blood samples constitutes a practical way for screening traffic cases, with the exception of \u03b4-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, which should be handled in a separate method.", 
    "49": "Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a debilitating adverse effect associated with antipsychotic treatment. Older age and the presence of mood disorder have been identified as risk factors for the development of TD. Thus, we assessed the incidence of TD in younger and older patients with major depressive disorder with psychotic features who participated in a 12-week clinical trial comparing olanzapine plus sertraline versus olanzapine plus placebo. All subjects (n = 259) were assessed with the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale at baseline and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment (or at termination). We used 7 different published criteria to estimate the prevalence of TD at baseline and the incidence over the duration of the trial. We compared the incidence of TD in subjects 60 years or older and those younger than 60 years. The overall prevalence and incidence of TD varied almost 10-fold, depending on the criteria (prevalence range, 1.2%-8.9%; incidence range, 0.0%-5.9%). Tardive dyskinesia was observed as a clinical adverse event in only 1 subject (0.4%). Whereas older subjects had a higher prevalence of TD at baseline, the incidence in younger and older subjects did not differ significantly. The incidence of TD was relatively low in both younger and older patients with major depressive disorder with psychotic features treated acutely with olanzapine. However, the estimate of the risk of TD varies widely, depending on the criteria used to define TD.",

The effect size-dose relationship showed a typical dose-response curve with minimal rise in slope for doses higher than 10 mg/d. For the dose-occupancy relationship, 6 studies were included. Doses more than approximately 12 mg/d were sufficient to block 65% of striatal D2 receptors. Doses higher than 20 mg led to minimally higher receptor occupancies. Fifteen studies were included in the meta-regression of olanzapine mean concentrations. A linear relationship between mean plasma concentration and mean dose was observed.", 
    "53": "Our review suggests that the likelihood of a favorable response with olanzapine is maximized at doses of 10 to 15 mg/d (perhaps lower in nonsmoking females). Higher doses may be considered if 15 mg is ineffective and if plasma level is less than 20 ng/mL on that dose. There is a direct linear relationship between olanzapine dose and plasma concentration. Therapeutic drug monitoring may be useful in patients who are suspected of nonadherence, where there is potential for a drug interaction, and in patients taking 15 mg/d or more and who have not reached clinical response.",

Synthetic cannabinoids are potent than delta-9-THC and thus the withdrawal syndrome is similar but more severe; however the symptoms do not seem to improve with delta-9-THC. The differences in presentation could be due to the fact that synthetic products may contain several heterogeneous compounds, including amphetamine-like substances.",

To mask its bitter taste and enhance its aqueous solubility, we already developed a 0.2% (w/v) MDZ oral solution containing \u03b3-cyclodextrin (\u03b3-CD), which proves to be better accepted by children in pediatrics at University Hospital of Amiens. To improve the MDZ solubility, its closed form proportion in acidobasic equilibrium and its chemical stability, nuclear magnetic resonance, liquid chromatography-electrospray-high-resolution mass spectrometry, and tandem mass spectrometry methods were used to highlight the advantages of using partially methylated CD (2,6 di-O-methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin) and randomized methylated-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (RAMEB). The formation of 1:1 inclusion complex offered an improvement of the MDZ solubility and an increase of the closed and pharmacologically active form with a 33% gain when compared with the aqueous solution without CD. It was also demonstrated that RAMEB had a protecting effect on the MDZ degradation because it was found in almost 95% of remaining MDZ solution after 3 months at 40\u00b0C.",

Drugs were administered after a 12 h overnight fast in each of 2 treatment days which separated by a 2-week washout period. Serial blood samples were collected over a period of 72 h. Plasma was analyzed using a validated high performance liquid chromatography method with ultraviolet detection in the range of 2-24 ng/mL with a lower limit of quantitation of 1.25 ng/mL. A non-compartmental method was employed to determine the pharmacokinetic properties (Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-\u221e and T1/2) to test to bioequivalence. Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-\u221e were used to test the bioequivalence after log-transformation of plasma data. The mean (SD) Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-\u221e for the test formulation were 15.82 (3.15) ng/mL, 447.19 (100.64) ng.h/L and 570.75 (130.55) ng.h/L respectively. Corresponding values for the test formulation were 15.72 (4.25) ng/mL, 440.37 (98.75) ng.h/mL and 558.66 (129.57) ng.h/mL. For test formulation vs. the reference formulation, the 90% CIs of the least squares mean test/reference ratios of Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-\u221e were 97.6-110.0%, 96.4-109.4% and 97.3-109.2%.

    "68": "Bitopic binding properties apply to a variety of muscarinic compounds that span and simultaneously bind to both the orthosteric and allosteric receptor sites. We provide evidence that fluorescent pirenzepine derivatives, with the M1 antagonist fused to the boron-dipyrromethene [Bodipy (558/568)] fluorophore via spacers of varying lengths, exhibit orthosteric/allosteric binding properties at muscarinic M1 receptors. This behavior was inferred from a combination of functional, radioligand, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer binding experiments performed under equilibrium and kinetic conditions on enhanced green fluorescent protein-fused M1 receptors. Although displaying a common orthosteric component, the fluorescent compounds inherit bitopic properties from a linker-guided positioning of their Bodipy moiety within the M1 allosteric vestibule. Depending on linker length, the fluorophore is allowed to reach neighboring allosteric domains, overlapping or not with the classic gallamine site, but distinct from the allosteric indolocarbazole \"WIN\" site. Site-directed mutagenesis, as well as molecular modeling and ligand docking studies based on recently solved muscarinic receptor structures, further support the definition of two groups of Bodipy-pirenzepine derivatives exhibiting distinct allosteric binding poses. Thus, the linker may dictate pharmacological outcomes for bitopic molecules that are hardly predictable from the properties of individual orthosteric and allosteric building blocks. Our findings also demonstrate that the fusion of a fluorophore to an orthosteric ligand is not neutral, as it may confer, unless carefully controlled, unexpected properties to the resultant fluorescent tracer. Altogether, this study illustrates the importance of a \"multifacet\" experimental approach to unravel and validate bitopic ligand binding mechanisms.",

    "70": "Anxiolytic-like effects of dietary flavonoids are relatively well known. Ellagic acid is a naturally occurring flavonoid compound which is abundant in many plants and fruits. The present study was designed to investigate the antianxiety-like effect of ellagic acid in mice using an elevated plus-maze test. The involvement of the GABAergic and serotonergic systems in the antianxiety-like activity of ellagic acid was also studied. Our results showed that ellagic acid treatment (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.), produced a significant increase in the percentage of time spent and entry into the open arms, with a profile comparable to that of diazepam (1 mg/kg, p.o.). Unlike diazepam, the anxiolytic doses of ellagic acid did not prolong the duration of sodium thiopental-induced loss of righting reflex, indicating that this flavonoid is non-hypnotic. The anxiolytic effect observed with ellagic acid treatment (25 mg/kg, p.o.) was antagonized by pretreatment with picrotoxin (a non-competitive GABAA receptor antagonist, 1 mg/kg, i.p.) and flumazenil (a benzodiazepine site antagonist, 1 mg/kg, i.p.) but not with p-chlorophenylalanine (a serotonin synthesis inhibitor, 100 mg/kg, i.p.) and pindolol (a \u03b2-adrenoceptors blocker/5-HT1A/1B receptor antagonist, 10 mg/kg, i.p.). Taken together, the data demonstrated that acute and chronic administration of ellagic acid to mice has produced antianxiety-like effect when tested in the elevated plus-maze. The experiments with different receptor blockers suggest an involvement of GABAergic system in the anxiolytic action of this bioflavonoid. However, this action is not seems to be mediated through serotonergic system.", 
    "71": "Applying various psychopharmacological combination and augmentation strategies in schizophrenia is common clinical practice. This meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy of benzodiazepines added to antipsychotics. The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group trial register (until February 2011) and PubMed/Medline (until July 2012) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a minimum duration of one week that compared benzodiazepine augmentation of antipsychotics with a control group receiving antipsychotic monotherapy in schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses. Study selection and data extraction were conducted independently by at least two authors. The primary outcome was response to treatment. Secondary outcomes were positive and negative schizophrenic symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and dropouts due to any reason, inefficacy of treatment, and adverse events. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) with the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model, with number-needed-to-treat/harm (NNT/H) calculations where appropriate. Overall, 16 relevant RCTs with 1045 participants were identified. Benzodiazepine augmentation was not associated with statistically significantly more responders (N=6; n=511; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77-1.22). Adjunctive benzodiazepines were well accepted and tolerated according to dropout-rates and adverse effects apart from dizziness (N=3; n=190; RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.08-6.15) and somnolence (N=2; n=118; RR 3.30, 95% CI 1.04-10.40). There is no evidence for antipsychotic efficacy of additional benzodiazepine medication in schizophrenia. Therefore, benzodiazepines should be considered primarily for desired ultra short-term sedation of acutely agitated patients but not for augmentation of antipsychotics in the medium- and long-term pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia and related disorders.", 
    "72": "Dropouts impact clinical trial outcome analyses. Ignoring missing data is not an acceptable option when planning, conducting or interpreting the analysis of a clinical trial. Treatment related efficacy and safety data observed in the trial may not always be sufficient in explaining the dropouts' mechanism. Nevertheless, these dropout data may carry important treatment-related information and present as an outcome by itself. Traditional analyses involve the use of the time-to-event approach assuming that the dropouts' hazard is solely related to the efficacy or safety profiles observed in a study. A latent variable approach was developed to generalize this approach and to implement a more flexible dropout hazard function in a schizophrenia trial. This unobserved latent variable was used to jointly model the longitudinal efficacy data and dropout profiles across treatments. The analysis provides a framework to model informative dropouts simultaneously with primary efficacy outcomes and make intelligent decisions in drug development.", 
    "73": "Neuropathic pain is frequently characterized by spontaneous pain (ie, pain at rest) and, in some cases, by cold- and touch-induced allodynia. Mechanisms underlying the chronicity of neuropathic pain are not well understood. Rats received spinal nerve ligation (SNL) and were monitored for tactile and thermal thresholds. While heat hypersensitivity returned to baseline levels within approximately 35 to 40 days, tactile hypersensitivity was still present at 580 days after SNL. Tactile hypersensitivity at post-SNL day 60 (D60) was reversed by microinjection of 1) lidocaine; 2) a cholecystokinin 2 receptor antagonist into the rostral ventromedial medulla; or 3) dorsolateral funiculus lesion. Rostral ventromedial medulla lidocaine at D60 or spinal ondansetron, a 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 antagonist, at post-SNL D42 produced conditioned place preference selectively in SNL-treated rats, suggesting long-lasting spontaneous pain. Touch-induced FOS was increased in the spinal dorsal horn of SNL rats at D60 and prevented by prior dorsolateral funiculus lesion, suggesting that long-lasting tactile hypersensitivity depends upon spinal sensitization, which is mediated in part by descending facilitation, in spite of resolution of heat hypersensitivity.",

Due to the unique properties of the synthesized C8-Fe\u2083O\u2084@mSiO\u2082 microspheres (C8-modified magnetic mesoporous microsphere), small drug molecules like diazepam can enter the mesopore channels and be efficiently absorbed through hydrophobic interaction by interior C8-groups (Octyl functional groups). Large molecules like proteins are excluded from the mesopore channels as a result of size exclusion effect, leading to direct extraction of drug molecules from protein-rich biosmaples such as plasma without any other pretreatment procedure. Moreover, diazepam adsorbed C8-Fe\u2083O\u2084@mSiO\u2082 microspheres could be simply and rapidly isolated through placing a magnet on the bottom of container, and then diazepam could be easily eluted from C8-Fe\u2083O\u2084@mSiO\u2082 microspheres for further LC-MS analysis. Extraction conditions such as amounts of C8-Fe\u2083O\u2084@mSiO\u2082 microspheres added, adsorption time, elution solvent and elution time were investigated. Method validations including linear range, the limit of detection, precision, and recovery were also studied. The results indicated that the proposed method based on C8-Fe\u2083O\u2084@mSiO\u2082 microspheres was simple and accurate for the analysis of diazepam in the rat plasma. And it will provide new ideas for analyzing plasma concentration and pharmacokinetics of similar drugs.", 
    "82": "Findings using exploration models of anxiety such as the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) and Elevated Zero Maze (EZM) are remarkably consistent given the differences in layout and number of walls used to describe their closed areas. These factors therefore do not appear to be critical. The present studies were conducted to determine if anxiolytic activity could be detected using an apparatus that presented animals with only one wall. Mice were pre-treated with either vehicle, diazepam (2-4 mg/kg) or 5-10 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide (CDP) and placed for 5 min onto a square platform containing a 12 cm \u00d7 14 cm wall. Measures were taken of frequency/duration of contacts with the wall and of general activity. Time spent in contact with the wall was selectively reduced by 4 mg/kg diazepam. 10 mg/kg CDP also decreased this measure but increased measures of general activity, indicating a possible mild stimulant effect. The closed areas of the EPM are described by 3 walls. The EZM uses 2. Current findings show that anxiolytic effects can also be detected in a model with just one wall. It could and these data provide further evidence that variations in the layout of these mazes are not critical for detecting anxiolytic action. Thigmotactic cues remain present regardless of the physical characteristics of these mazes or the local conditions they are employed under. Hence, it is suggested that thigmotactic cues may be the common source of motivation to behave in these models and that this may explain their robustness.",

In general psychiatry, however, off-label medication is reported mainly for atypical antipsychotics. In the emergency service 41% of the medication prescribed during first contacts with patients was off-label. These prescriptions were most often for antipsychotics (54%) and benzodiazepines (38%) . The most important indications were aggression, agitation and sleep problems. If the term &lsquo;off-label&rsquo; is interpreted in a broader sense with respect to antipsychotics for psychosis and hypomania, then 33% of the prescriptions appeared to be off-label.

Relevant literature with a focus on data published since our last review in 2007 was evaluated for topic relevance and clinical applicability. Optimal management of pain, agitation, and delirium in ICUs requires a systematic and multimodal approach aimed at providing comfort while maximizing outcomes. Dexmedetomidine is among multiple agents, including opioids, propofol, benzodiazepines, and antipsychotics, used to facilitate and increase patients' tolerability of mechanical ventilation. This article reviews the newest evidence available for dexmedetomidine use for sedation and analgesia in medical-surgical ICUs. Adverse effects associated with dexmedetomidine were similar among the studies examined herein. The most common adverse effects with dexmedetomidine were bradycardia and hypotension, in some cases severe enough to warrant the use of vasoactive support. Due to the adverse events associated with rapid dosage adjustment and bolus therapy, dexmedetomidine may not be the best agent for treating acute agitation.",

    "102": "Clinically effective drugs against human anxiety and fear systematically alter the innate defensive behavior of rodents, suggesting that in humans these emotions reflect defensive adaptations. Compelling experimental human evidence for this theory is yet to be obtained. We report the clearest test to date by investigating the effects of 1 and 2\u2009mg of the anti-anxiety drug lorazepam on the intensity of threat-avoidance behavior in 40 healthy adult volunteers (20 females). We found lorazepam modulated the intensity of participants' threat-avoidance behavior in a dose-dependent manner. However, the pattern of effects depended upon two factors: type of threat-avoidance behavior and theoretically relevant measures of personality. In the case of flight behavior (one-way active avoidance), lorazepam increased intensity in low scorers on the Fear Survey Schedule tissue-damage fear but reduced it in high scorers. Conversely, in the case of risk-assessment behavior (two-way active avoidance), lorazepam reduced intensity in low scorers on the Spielberger trait anxiety but increased it in high scorers. Anti-anxiety drugs do not systematically affect rodent flight behavior; therefore, we interpret this new finding as suggesting that lorazepam has a broader effect on defense in humans than in rodents, perhaps by modulating general perceptions of threat intensity. The different patterning of lorazepam effects on the two behaviors implies that human perceptions of threat intensity are nevertheless distributed across two different neural streams, which influence effects observed on one-way or two-way active avoidance demanded by the situation.",

Their effects were compared to those of 1,4-benzodiazepine agonists and some known 1,5-benzodiazepines. The activities were evaluated for the two GABAA receptor populations present in cerebellar granule cells, one mediating phasic inhibition and the other one mediating tonic inhibition. Some of the compounds displayed a profile of agonist at the component mediating phasic inhibition. This agonistic activity was prevented by the benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil. Interestingly, the active compounds displayed an agonistic activity at these receptors significantly greater than that of \"classical\" 1,4-benzodiazepine agonists, such as diazepam, flunitrazepam and alprazolam.",

After oral administration of Rho and MDZ to rats pretreated with RTV for 7 days, the areas under the plasma concentration-time curve of Rho and MDZ were significantly altered depending on TimeR: 1.27-, 0.79-, 0.95-, and 0.11-fold increases over that of the control for Rho at TimeR = 0, 3, 9, and 24 h and 3.12-, 1.50-, 1.27-, and 0.17-fold increases over that of the control for MDZ at TimeR = 0, 3, 9, and 24 h, respectively.

Previous studies have indicated that borneol could reduce the plasma concentrations of oneself and concomitant drugs, and its first-pass metabolism could be catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) enzyme as well. The impact of borneol on CYP3A activity and efficacy in influencing the pharmacokinetics of co-administrated drugs is currently unknown. Therefore, the purpose of the current study is to investigate the effect of borneol on CYP3A enzyme in vivo. After treatment with borneol twice daily for 3\u00a0days, rat liver microsomes were exposed to probe substrates to determine CYP3A enzyme activity, protein, and RNA harvested using microsomal testosterone 6\u03b2-hydroxylation as a marker of enzyme activity. To verify the result, the effect of borneol on the pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A model substrate midazolam was further examined. The results showed that borneol treatment had increased CYP3A expression at the mRNA, protein, and activity (testosterone 6\u03b2 hydroxylase activity) level in rat liver microsomes. In addition, borneol accelerated the metabolism of midazolam, which was consistent with the enhancement in CYP3A metabolic capacity. The hepatic clearance (Cl) of midazolam injected via the caudal vein in rats following borneol co-administration was higher; however, the area under the curve (AUC0-\u221e) was lower than the solvent. Hence, it was proposed that borneol could increase the metabolic activity of the CYP3A enzyme, which might cause drug-drug interactions in humans when using Chinese herbal or Western medicine with borneol.", 
    "114": "The present study investigates the fear memory resulting from the interaction of a stressful experience and the retrieval of an established fear memory trace. Such a combination enhanced both fear expression and fear retention in adult Wistar rats. Likewise, midazolam intra-basolateral amygdala (BLA) infusion prior to stress attenuated the enhancement of fear memory thus suggesting the involvement of a stress-induced reduction of the GABAergic transmission in BLA in the stress-induced enhancing effect. It has been suggested that, unlike the immediate-early gene Zif268 which is related to the reconsolidation process, the expression of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is highly correlated with consolidation. We therefore evaluate the relative contribution of these two neurobiological processes to the fear memory resulting from the above-mentioned interaction. Intra-dorsal hippocampus (DH) infusions of either the antisense Zif268 or the inhibitor of the protein degradation (Clasto-Lactacystin \u03b2-Lactone), suggested to be involved in the retrieval-dependent destabilization process, did not affect the resulting contextual memory. In contrast, the knockdown of hippocampal BDNF mitigated the stress-induced facilitating influence on fear retention. In addition, the retrieval experience elevated BDNF level in DH at 60 min after recall exclusively in stressed animals. These findings suggest the involvement of a hippocampal BDNF sensitive mechanism in the stress-promoting influence on the fear memory following retrieval.",

In this work we investigate the possibility that three different mnemonic processes - updating, precision-keeping and trace strengthening - are mediated by reconsolidation in contextual fear conditioning. Reconsolidation involves the activation of calcium channels for the destabilization during the reactivation. Our results show that when memory is reactivated in a situation that does not match the original information, content is modified, i.e., \"updated\". However, when the contextual condition matches the original one, memory reactivation contributes either to its strengthening or to the maintenance of its precision content over time. Since the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel antagonist nimodipine blocked these effects, we suggest that reconsolidation is the mechanism supporting these processes.",

LCL161 is a small molecule oral IAP antagonist in development for use in combination with cytotoxic agents. The effect of LCL161 on CYP3A4/5 (CYP3A) activity was investigated in vitro and in a clinical study. Results in human liver microsomes indicated LCL161 inhibited CYP3A in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (KI of 0.797\u2009\u00b5M and kinact of 0.0803\u2009min(-1) ). LCL161 activated human PXR in a reporter gene assay and induced CYP3A4 mRNA up to \u223c5-fold in human hepatocytes. In healthy subjects, the dual inhibitor and inductive effects of a single dose of LCL161 were characterized using single midazolam doses, given before and at three time points after the LCL161 dose. Midazolam Cmax increased 3.22-fold and AUC(0-inf) increased 9.32-fold when administered four hours after LCL161. Three days later, midazolam Cmax decreased by 27% and AUC(0-inf) decreased by 30%. No drug interaction remained one week later. The strong CYP3A inhibition by LCL161 was accurately predicted using dynamic physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling approaches in Simcyp. However, the observed induction effect after the LCL161 dose could not be modeled; suggesting direct enzyme induction by LCL161 was not the underlying mechanism.", 
    "125": "Ketoconazole is a potent CYP3A inhibitor used to assess the contribution of CYP3A to drug clearance and quantify the increase in drug exposure due to a strong inhibitor. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models have been used to evaluate treatment regimens resulting in maximal CYP3A inhibition by ketoconazole but have reached different conclusions. We compare two PBPK models of the ketoconazole-midazolam interaction, model 1 (Chien et al., 2006) and model 2 implemented in Simcyp (version 11), to predict 16 published treatment regimens. With use of model 2, 41% of the study point estimates of area under the curve (AUC) ratio and 71% of the 90% confidence intervals were predicted within 1.5-fold of the observed, but these increased to 82 and 100%, respectively, with model 1. For midazolam, model 2 predicted a maximal midazolam AUC ratio of 8 and a hepatic fraction metabolized by CYP3A (f(m)) of 0.97, whereas model 1 predicted 17 and 0.90, respectively, which are more consistent with observed data. On the basis of model 1, ketoconazole (400 mg QD) for at least 3 days and substrate administration within 2 hours is required for maximal CYP3A inhibition. Ketoconazole treatment regimens that use 200 mg BID underestimate the systemic fraction metabolized by CYP3A (0.86 versus 0.90) for midazolam. The systematic underprediction also applies to CYP3A substrates with high bioavailability and long half-lives. The superior predictive performance of model 1 reflects the need for accumulation of ketoconazole at enzyme site and protracted inhibition. Model 2 is not recommended for inferring optimal study design and estimation of fraction metabolized by CYP3A.",

Quaternization of the C3 position of compound 1 in order to prevent racemization gave compound 2, which was inactive in our capsid disassembly assay. A likely explanation for this finding was revealed by in silico analysis predicting a dramatic increase in energy of the bioactive conformation upon quaternization of the C3 position. Replacement of the C3 of the diazepine ring with a nitrogen atom to give the 1,5-dihydro-benzo[f][1,3,5]triazepine-2,4-dione analog 4 was well tolerated.

At the same time motor neurons are susceptible to AMPA receptor mediated excitotoxicity and internal calcium deregulation which is not fully understood. We analysed ER mitochondria calcium cycle (ERMCC) dynamics with subsecond resolution in G93A hSOD1 overexpressing motor neurons as a model of ALS using fluorescent calcium imaging. When comparing vulnerable motor neurons and non-motor neurons from G93A hSOD1 mice and their non-transgenic littermates, we found a decelerated cytosolic calcium clearance in the presence of G93A hSOD1. While both non-transgenic as well as G93A hSOD1 motor neurons displayed large mitochondrial calcium uptake by the mitochondrial uniporter (mUP), the mitochondrial calcium extrusion system was altered in the presence of G93A hSOD1. In addition, ER calcium uptake by the sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) was increased in G93A hSOD1 motor neurons. In survival assays, blocking the mitochondrial sodium calcium exchanger (mNCE) by CGP37157 as well as inhibiting SERCA by cyclopiazonic acid showed protective effects against kainate induced excitotoxicity. Thus, our study shows for the first time that the functional consequence of G93A hSOD1 overexpression in intact motor neurons is indeed a disturbance of the ER mitochondria calcium cycle, and identified two promising targets for therapeutic intervention in the pathology of ALS.",

The experimental designed was based on Michaelis-Menten parameters (apparent Michaelis constant (aKm) and apparent maximum velocity (aVm)) that estimate inhibition (%) as well as the type of inhibition (mechanism). The results showed marked inhibition of AchE by diazepam and the values of aKm and aVm were 65.5% and 52.63%, respectively. These values suggested a competitive type of antagonism for diazepam. Similar trend of antagonism was shown by phenobarbitone when it was subjected to the challenge of AchE with aKm and aVm values of 51.99% and 71.80%, respectively. It is concluded that diazepam and phenobarbitone exhibited prominent AchE attenuation apart from their well-established antidepressant activity, which could be more useful in related diseased conditions.",

Measurements were performed by LC-MS/MS. Analyte instability was defined as a deviation of 15% or greater from the expected concentration. All analytes were stable following 3 freeze-thaw cycles in human plasma, and were stable in this matrix for at least 5 days at ambient temperature (olanzapine, 3 days); 4 weeks at 2-8\u00b0C (olanzapine, 2 weeks), and 2 years at -20\u00b0C (except for dehydroaripiprazole, olanzapine, and quetiapine, 1 year). In human serum, aripiprazole, dehydroaripiprazole, norclozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and sulpiride were unstable after 5 days at ambient temperature, 3 weeks at 2-8\u00b0C, and 9 months at -20\u00b0C. Olanzapine was unstable in whole blood and oral fluid under most conditions studied, although prior addition of ascorbic acid had a moderate stabilising effect. All other analytes were stable in whole blood and oral fluid for at least 2 days at ambient temperature, 1 week at 2-8\u00b0C, and 2 months at -20\u00b0C (clozapine and norclozapine, 1 month whole blood). These results confirm that plasma (EDTA anticoagulant) is the sample of choice for TDM of atypical antipsychotics. Delayed (more than 1 week) analysis of patient samples should be undertaken with caution, especially with serum and with haemolysed whole blood. With olanzapine, only plasma collected and stored appropriately is likely to give reliable quantitative results.",

    "163": "Organophosphates are commonly used pesticides and cause about one million unintentional and 2 million suicidal exposures with up to 300,000 fatalities every year around the world. Toxicity of organophosphates is due to inhibition cholinesterase activity and prolonging the effects of acetylcholine in the receptor site. Clinical features of organophosphate poisoning are defecation, urination, miosis, bronchorrhea, emesis, lacrimation and salivation. Spontaneous abortion reported some when in pregnant patients. Intravenous administration of benzodiazepines, atropine and pralidoxime is the formal treatment of this toxicity. Atropine and pralidoxime have been assigned to pregnancy class C by the FDA and should be recommended for use in pregnant women clinically suffer organophosphate poisoning. Benzodiazepines have been assigned to pregnancy class D and should be avoided during pregnancy. Clinical experiments suggest transplacental transfer of organophosphates is possible, and fetal sensitivity is probable, but a single acute overdose most likely don't make any physical deformities, therefore termination of pregnancy is not imperative. Nonetheless, no definite strategy focused on maintaining pregnancy. Here we propose an idea that in any female case of acute organophosphate poisoning in childbearing range of age, maternal serum Beta-HCG should be tested for pregnancy and prophylactic progesterone should be used in pregnant cases of organophosphate poisoning.",

However, chronic treatment with benzodiazepines is known to induce dependence, which is considered related to neuroplastic changes in the mesolimbic system. This study investigated the involvement of K(+) -Cl(-) co-transporter 2 (KCC2) in the sensitization to morphine-induced hyperlocomotion after chronic treatment with zolpidem [a selective agonist of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid A-type receptor (GABAA R) \u03b11 subunit]. In this study, chronic treatment with zolpidem enhanced morphine-induced hyperlocomotion, which is accompanied by the up-regulation of KCC2 in the limbic forebrain. We also found that chronic treatment with zolpidem induced the down-regulation of protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1) as well as the up-regulation of phosphorylated protein kinase C \u03b3 (pPKC\u03b3). Furthermore, PP-1 directly associated with KCC2 and pPKC\u03b3, whereas pPKC\u03b3 did not associate with KCC2. On the other hand, pre-treatment with furosemide (a KCC2 inhibitor) suppressed the enhancing effects of zolpidem on morphine-induced hyperlocomotion. These results suggest that the mesolimbic dopaminergic system could be amenable to neuroplastic change through a pPKC\u03b3-PP-1-KCC2 pathway by chronic treatment with zolpidem.",

Seizures were analyzed using the Lamberty & Klitgaard score and kindling was considered as established after at least three consecutive seizures of score 4 or 5. Cumulative seizure scores for each group were analyzed using repeated measures of ANOVA followed by Tukey test. PTZ induced 4 and 5-score seizures after 12 injections in saline treated rats, whereas daily injection of Parawixin2 inhibited the onset of seizures in a dose dependent manner. Also, the challenging administration of PTZ did not raise seizure score in animals treated with the highest dose of Parawixin2 or those treated with DZP or NA.

Rats underwent echocardiographic assessment after general anesthesia via pentobarbital or combinations of ketamine and medetomidine (KME) and ketamine and midazolam (KMI) according to a crossover Latin-square design. Blood samples for serum estradiol measurements were obtained from all females after echocardiography with each anesthetic. Rats given KMI showed superior LV systolic function with the highest values for fractional shortening (FS), ejection fraction (EF) and stroke volume, whereas heart rate was greatest with pentobarbital, followed by KMI and then KME. KME produced the greatest effects on cardiac morphology, most notably during systole, including reduced septal and posterior wall thickness and increased LV chamber dimensions and volumes. In addition, KME had the greatest cardiac-depressing effects on LV systolic function, including reduced FS, EF, and heart rate values. Compared with male rats, female rats had superior LV function with greater EF and FS values, whereas male rats showed higher heart rate. Significant negative correlations were noted between serum estradiol levels and FS and EF values in female rats receiving KME. We conclude that the combination of KMI may be a superior anesthetic for use in male and female rats undergoing echocardiography."
