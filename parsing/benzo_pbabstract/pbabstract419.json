Eight patients who were anesthetized without premedication served as the controls. Induction and emergence were rapid and unaffected by premedication. End-tidal and inspired concentrations of desflurane at loss of consciousness were significantly reduced by premedication (10.1% end-tidal/14.1% inspired, no premedication, vs. 5.3% end-tidal/8.9% inspired, premedication). Airway irritability was markedly attenuated by premedication (100% no premedication versus 30% premedicated), as was apnea (37.5% no premedication versus 0% premedicated). We observed an increase in mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate after loss of consciousness (mean arterial pressure 103 vs 121 mm Hg, heart rate 73 vs 100 bpm) in the unpremedicated patients, whereas both groups demonstrated a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure with no change in heart rate when baseline values were compared to those at incision (103 vs 74 mm Hg, no premedication, 99 vs 81 mm Hg premedicated). Patient acceptability was satisfactory and unchanged by premedication. We recommend the use of such premedication when desflurane is used during the induction of anesthesia.", 
    "1": "A 19-year-old woman presented with status epilepticus and ventricular dysrhythmias less than one hour after ingesting 5,000 mg dimenhydrinate (Dramamine). Aggressive resuscitation including the use of physostigmine stabilized the cardiac rhythm; however, she suffered a severe neurologic deficit. Development of ischemic and infarcted bowel necessitated colonic resection. After surgery, her condition worsened, and after demonstration of minimal cerebral activity, supportive measures were withdrawn, and she died. Overdose with dimenhydrinate and diphenhydramine, both of which are over-the-counter drugs, can result in rapid central nervous system stimulation, including status epilepticus. Death can occur within two hours. To our knowledge, this is the first reported fatality resulting from ingestion of dimenhydrinate.",

    "6": "A series of 237 patients with DSM-III-diagnosed panic disorder, or agoraphobia with panic attacks, received alprazolam as part of the placebo-controlled Cross-National Collaborative Panic Study. After a 1-week drug-free period, alprazolam dosage was titrated upward with the objective of reaching 6.0 mg/d in all patients. At week 3 of treatment, alprazolam plasma levels were significantly correlated with daily dosage (regression slope: 11.7 ng/mL per milligram per day) but with considerable individual variation. Among patients with spontaneous panic attacks, 70% of those with plasma alprazolam levels greater than 20 ng/mL achieved complete remission vs 31% of those with levels less than 20 ng/mL. Situational panic attack remission increased in frequency with increasing plasma levels, but the relationship was not significant. Patient- and physician-rated global improvement and Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale score reductions were maximal at 20 to 39 ng/mL, with no further benefit at higher levels. Central nervous system-depressant side effects increased in frequency with higher plasma levels. Between weeks 3 and 8 of treatment, physicians were permitted to adjust dosage (maximum: 10 mg/d) to optimize response. At week 8, the dose-concentration relationship was essentially identical (regression slope: 10.8 ng/mL per milligram per day), but plasma levels were no longer related to efficacy or side effects. Thus, monitoring of plasma alprazolam concentrations may have a clinically useful role during short-term treatment of panic disorder.", 
    "7": "A study of eight deaths involving the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam was performed to assess the contribution of this drug to the fatalities. Coronial deaths in Victoria in the 2-year period to mid-1991 were selected in which either flunitrazepam or flunitrazepam and ethanol were the principal toxicological findings. All bodies were subject to a full autopsy by forensic pathologists, and a full toxicological examination. No significant pathology was found at autopsy in any case. Very high concentrations of 7-aminoflunitrazepam, a metabolite of flunitrazepam, were present in all cases. In four cases no other significant drug was detected, whereas in the other four cases there were significant concentrations of ethanol (mean 1.6 g/L). In these two groups of cases the concentrations of 7-aminoflunitrazepam were 0.45 mg/L and 0.16 mg/L, respectively. Only moderate levels of flunitrazepam were detected, suggesting that 7-aminoflunitrazepam is produced postmortem and may be an important marker of flunitrazepam usage. The causes of death in these eight cases were probably either flunitrazepam toxicity or a combination of flunitrazepam and ethanol toxicity. Only one case appeared likely to have been a suicide. Our observations in these cases suggest that flunitrazepam may cause death in the absence of other drugs or significant disease. The presence of ethanol reduces the amount of flunitrazepam needed to cause death.",

    "9": "The efficacy of bromazepam and prazepam for the different components of anxiety: inhibition, asthenia and somatisation is evaluated in a multi-centric, comparative and randomised study, conducted as double blind and in parallel groups in 159 adult patients showing a manifest anxiety according to the F.D.A. criteria. After a 7 day wash-out period, the patients receive either bromazepam in a 12 mg/d dose or prazepam in a 40 mg/d dose, over 4 weeks (D0-D28), then in a decreasing dose from D28 to D43; follow-up is carried out using the anxious inhibition scale W.P.2, auto-questionnaire A.D.A., the Hamilton anxiety scale and the Tyrer questionnaire (benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms questionnaire). Patients are evaluated seven times during the study: at day 7 for inclusion, day 0 for randomisation, then day 7 and day 14 for following visits, at day 28 for efficacy and tolerance evaluation, and at day 50 for utilisation and withdrawal evaluation. The major efficacy criteria are the evolution of inhibition, asthenia and somatisation as compounds of anxiety respectively evaluated by W.P.2 scale, asthenic partial score of autoquestionnaire A.D.A. and somatic partial score of Hamilton anxiety scale. The analysis of results don't show any significant difference between the two groups on the evolution of the components asthenia and inhibition. However the evolution of the somatic component clearly makes a significant difference in favour of bromazepam. There is also a significant difference in terms of global anxiolytic action efficacy, in favour of bromazepam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "The mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and use of flumazenil in benzodiazepine overdose, as well as in the management of other disease states, are reviewed. Flumazenil interacts at the central benzodiazepine receptor to antagonize or reverse the behavioral, neurologic, and electrophysiologic effects of benzodiazepine agonists and inverse agonists. Flumazenil has been studied for a variety of indications, including as an antidote to benzodiazepine overdose and for awakening of comatose patients, reversal of sedation after surgery and in critically ill patients, and management of hepatic encephalopathy. It improves the level of consciousness in patients with benzodiazepine overdose; however, resedation may occur within one to two hours after administration, so repeated doses or a continuous infusion may be required to maintain therapeutic efficacy. It appears to be effective in reversing sedation induced by midazolam or diazepam, and case reports suggest that it is useful in awakening comatose patients, although its clinical utility is questionable. Flumazenil has proved useful in reversing conscious sedation in critically ill patients, although response may be dose dependent. Animal models indicate that flumazenil is of some benefit in hepatic encephalopathy, but until well-designed clinical trials are conducted, hepatic encephalopathy must be considered an investigational indication for flumazenil. Adverse reactions include CNS manifestations, resedation, cardiovascular effects, seizures, and alterations in intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure. Hepatic dysfunction results in a substantial change in the pharmacokinetic profile of flumazenil; therefore, dosage adjustment may be necessary in patients with hepatic dysfunction or in those receiving medications that alter flumazenil metabolism. Flumazenil has been shown to reverse sedation caused by intoxication with benzodiazepines alone or benzodiazepines in combination with other agents, but it should not be used when cyclic antidepressant intoxication is suspected. It may be beneficial after surgery when benzodiazepines have been used as part of anesthesia and after a diagnostic or surgical procedure when assessment of CNS function is necessary.", 
    "11": "The effects of a 15 day treatment with zolpidem (10 mg) and with flunitrazepam (1 mg) on Insomnia Disorders Related to Depressive Disorders (DSM-III-R) have been evaluated on 30 depressive in-patients (mean age 42.3 +/- 9.8). The trial has been carried out on double blind condition after 5 days of single blind placebo administration. Withdrawal effects have been evaluated in single blind condition on a 10 day period after drugs discontinuation. Patient's diagnosis was Major Depression or Dysthymia according to DSM-III-R; inclusion criteria were insomnia (total sleep time < or = 6 h, sleep latency > or = 30 min, wake after sleep onset > or = 30 min, No of awakenings > or = 3) refractory to clomipramine administration at constant dose (75-150 mg/day among patients). Both drugs have been followed by a rapid, significant diminution of insomnia as demonstrated by significant changes at Stanford Sleepiness Scale and Saint Mary Hospital Sleep Questionnaire and by a significant reduction of HDRS total scores. No clinical phenomena of rebound insomnia were detected after zolpidem and flunitrazepam withdrawal. Drug discontinuation however was followed by the slow increase of the score on insomnia items, approximating basal values at the end of the 10 day period after zolpidem and flunitrazepam withdrawal. A parallel increase of HDRS total score was also detected; HDRS changes were mainly due to the increase of the items anxiety somatic, general somatic symptoms, gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, hypochondriasis. The study confirms the therapeutic efficacy of zolpidem and of flunitrazepam in the treatment of insomnia resistant to antidepressant drugs in depressed patients. They also suggest that early drug discontinuation is frequently associated with clinical relapse of insomnia and of several other symptoms correlated with the affective pathology.",

Many drugs are used in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome: carbamazepine, clonidine, chlormethiazole, phenytoin and other compounds; actually benzodiazepines are the most important drugs for symptomatic relief to prevent major withdrawal syndrome. Particularly attention is recommended to the period of suspension with the aim of reducing alcohol consumption and correcting alcohol-related psychosocial problems.", 
    "13": "A response to treatment and long-term course of 14 adults with delayed sleep phase syndrome were investigated with the use of their hospital records and mailed questionnaires. Six patients treated with chronotherapy showed full recovery just after the treatment. In three of them the delay of sleep phase relapsed one year afterwards. Four of five patients treated with pharmacotherapy alone showed partial recovery. Six of nine patients followed for periods of longer than three years after treatment showed good prognoses, though all of them still had a mild phase delay and had to shorten their sleep time in order to work full-time. The three others had poor prognoses and one of them was under psychiatric treatment for affective instability. These findings suggest that a long-term follow-up is needed to judge the effect of the treatment.", 
    "14": "Differences in electroencephalographic (EEG) power spectra obtained under similar, but not identical, conditions may be difficult to discern using standard techniques. Statistical analysis may not be useful because of the large number of comparisons necessary. Visual recognition of differences also may be difficult. A new technique, neural network analysis, has been used successfully in other problems of pattern recognition and classification. We examined a number of methods of classifying similar EEG data: standard statistical analysis (analysis of variance), visual recognition, discriminant analysis, and neural network analysis. Twenty-nine volunteers received either thiopental (n = 9), midazolam (n = 10), or propofol (n = 10) in sedative doses in 3 different studies. These drugs produced very similar changes in the EEG power spectra. Except for beta 2 power during thiopental infusion, differences between drugs could not be detected using analysis of variance. Visual categorization was correct in 72% of the baseline EEGs, 70% of thiopental EEGs, 27% of propofol EEGs, and 46% of midazolam EEGs. A classification neural network (Learning Vector Quantization network) containing a Kohonen hidden layer was able to successfully classify 57 of 58 EEG samples (of 4 minutes' duration). Discriminant analysis had a similar rate of success. This level of performance was achieved by dividing the EEG power spectrum from 1 to 30 Hz into 15 2-Hz bandwidths. When the EEG power spectrum was divided into the \"classical\" frequency bandwidths (alpha, beta 1, beta 2, theta, delta), both neural network and discriminant analysis performance deteriorated. By training the network using only certain inputs we were able to identify drug-specific bandwidths that seemed to be important in correct classification. We conclude that propofol, thiopental, and midazolam produce different effects on the EEG and that both neural network and discriminant analysis are useful in identifying these differences. We also conclude that EEG spectra should be analyzed without using classical EEG bands (alpha, beta, etc.). Additionally, neural networks can be used to identify frequency bands that are \"important\" in specific drug effects on the EEG. Once a classification algorithm is obtained using either a neural network or discriminant analysis, it could be used as an on-line monitor to recognize drug-specific EEG patterns.", 
    "15": "A study of the rate of benzodiazepine prescribing was made in one primary care clinic in Israel during the period of the Gulf War. The number of benzodiazepine prescriptions rose sharply at the start of the war and declined before the cease-fire. This rise in prescribing was both absolute and relative to total prescriptions dispensed. The war appeared to represent a transient emotional crisis in the community. There was no evidence of dependence on anxiolytics following the termination of hostilities. There were some signs that the population adapted to the situation, needing fewer tranquilizers before the war ended.", 
    "16": "Penicillin (PC) neurotoxicity (convulsions and encephalopathy) is considered to be due to GABAergic inhibition. The effects of penicillin G(PCG) on [3H]flunitrazepam (FNZ) binding in rat neuron-enriched primary cultures was examined to assess the role of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor in the neurotoxicity. PCG application for 24 h induced a significant decrease in [3H]FNZ binding activity at 10(-3) M, and a decrease in available receptor number (Bmax) at 10(-2) M, without obvious cell damage. Pre-application of the BDZ receptor antagonist, Ro-15-1788, prevented the PC-induced decrease in [3H]FNZ binding activity. Therefore, PC seems to reduce the number of BDZ receptors through a direct effect on this receptor, which is a part of the major inhibitory system in mammalian brain; the GABAergic macromolecular receptor complex. This decrease in BDZ receptors may play a role in PC-induced neurotoxicity, especially encephalopathy.", 
    "17": "Twenty patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a mean gestational age of 32 weeks. There were 12 patients with suspected fetal brain abnormality and four with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), while the remaining four cases were studied for other reasons. The MRI examinations were performed on a 0.5 Tesla machine, with surface coils. One minute acquisition time T1 sequences were used. All the studies were performed without fetal curarization, and only under maternal sedation using flunitrazepam given per os 1 h before MRI examination. Three examinations were incomplete because of fetal movement artefacts. In the remaining cases, MRI allowed the examination of fetal brain anatomy. In five cases, it helped to differentiate isolated hydrocephalus and corpus callosum agenesis. Sub-ependymal nodules were depicted in a case of fetal tuberous sclerosis. One suspected arachnoid cyst was proved to be an ultrasound artefact. Decreased fetal fat on MR images was correlated with low birth weight in cases of IUGR. Due to its better spatial resolution, ultrasonography was more accurate for the diagnosis of facial and lumbar anomalies. Fetal MRI may be performed without curarization. Surface coils allow the detailed analysis of brain parenchyma, and thus MRI is especially useful in the difficult prenatal diagnosis of fetal brain abnormalities.", 
    "18": "Two groups of 11 ICU respiratory patients ventilated with PSV have been sedated with propofol (group I) or with midazolam (group II). After the endovenous administration of the induction dose (propofol 1.5 mg/kg; midazolam 0.15 mg/kg) sedation was obtained with continuous infusion of the drugs (propofol 2 mg/kg/h; midazolam 0.24 mg/kg/h). In this setting the Authors evaluated the level of sedation (Ramsey scale) and the side effect of the two drugs. At induction midazolam caused a reduction of tidal volume for some minutes and a greatest sedation in comparison with propofol, while propofol caused reduction of MAP (p < 0.01) and transitory apnoea. Even if during the infusion of propofol the level of sedation decreased with time (p < 0.05; y = -0.0357 x + 3.07) it was more stable in comparison with that registered during continuous infusion of midazolam (p < 0.01; y = -0.2018 x + 5.19.", 
    "19": "Cerebral protection means prevention of cerebral neuronal damage. Severe brain damage extinguishes the very \"human\" functions such as speech, consciousness, intellectual capacity, and emotional integrity. Many pathologic conditions may inflict injuries to the brain, therefore the protection and salvage of cerebral neuronal function must be the top priorities in the care of critically ill patients. Brain tissue has unusually high energy requirements, its stores of energy metabolites are small and, as a result, the brain is totally dependent on a continuous supply of substrates and oxygen, via the circulation. In complete global ischemia (cardiac arrest) reperfusion is characterized by an immediate reactive hyperemia followed within 20-30 min by a delayed hypoperfusion state. It has been postulated that the latter contributes to the ultimate neurologic outcome. In focal ischemia (stroke) the primary focus of necrosis is encircled by an area (ischemic penumbra) that is underperfused and contains neurotoxic substances such as free radicals, prostaglandins, calcium, and excitatory neurotransmitters. The variety of therapeutic effort that have addressed the question of protecting the brain reflects their limited success. 1) Barbiturates. After an initial enthusiastic endorsement by many clinicians and years of vigorous controversy, it can now be unequivocally stated that there is no place for barbiturate therapy following resuscitation from cardiac arrest. One presumed explanation for this negative statement is that cerebral metabolic suppression by barbiturates (and other anesthetics) is impossible in the absence of an active EEG. Conversely, in the event of incomplete ischemia EEG activity in usually present (albeit altered) and metabolic suppression and hence possibly protection can be induced with barbiturates. Indeed, most of the animal studies led to a number of recommendations for barbiturate therapy in man for incomplete ischemia. 2) Isoflurane. From a cerebral metabolic standpoint, exposure to isoflurane at concentration of 2 MAC is credited with providing the same potential for protection as high dose barbiturate (isoelectric EEG). A possible major difference between barbiturates and isoflurane is the modest cerebral vasodilation induced by the latter while barbiturates are associated with decreased CBF. This suggests that in focal ischemia isoflurane may elicit an intracerebral steal. 3) Calcium entry blockers. Some calcium entry blockers with the distinctive feature of acting preferably on cerebral as opposed to systemic vascular smooth muscles may exert beneficial effects during or after brain ischemia. Two such drugs which have shown promise are nimodipine and lidoflazine. In animal and human studies nimodipine has been reported to improve the neurologic outcome of both the cerebral vasospasm and the postischemic hypoperfusion state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "20": "The aims of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, conducted in a group of healthy young adults with normal sleep patterns, were to ascertain the effect of various doses of zolpidem on polysomnographic variables and to determine whether zolpidem disrupts sleep architecture. Of the 15 subjects recruited, 8 were included in the final analysis. Subjects underwent four experimental sessions during three nights, of which the first night was used for adaptation, the second for zolpidem (10, 20, and 40 mg) or placebo administration, and the third for placebo administration. Sleep was assessed by conventional sleep parameters (latency, duration, wakefulness) and by subjective questionnaire. Polysomnographic recordings were analyzed for sleep stage, paradoxical sleep, graphic features, and longitudinally with reference to sleep stage. Zolpidem had little effect on polysomnographic variables, except for a trend toward a hypnotic effect and a slight, transient inhibition of paradoxical sleep at the highest dose. In particular, the clearcut reduction of stage 4 sleep and increase in spindle density often observed with benzodiazepine administration was not observed with zolpidem. Adverse effects were restricted to three reports of daytime drowsiness each after zolpidem 10 and 40 mg and placebo, and one amnesic episode after the highest dose (40 mg). There were no signs of ataxic symptomatology.",

Objective tests and subjective assessments were made before the intake of hypnotics and 30 and 90 min after it. In Study I, triazolam impaired letter cancellation, the combination triazolam+erythromycin impaired digit symbol substitution and letter cancellation, and triazolam+roxithromycin impaired digit symbol substitution, all at 90 min. In Study II, midazolam 5 mg and midazolam 10 mg proved quite inert but the combination midazolam 5 mg+erythromycin impaired digit symbol substitution. In Study III, both midazolam 10 mg and midazolam 15 mg impaired digit substitution and letter cancellation, the effects of 15 mg being more prominent. The strongest drug effects were found with midazolam 10 mg+erythromycin which differed from placebo and midazolam (10 mg and 15 mg) in several objective and subjective test variables. In Study IV, the combination midazolam 10 mg+roxithromycin impaired several objective and subjective variables but it was not stronger than midazolam 15 mg. These results were supported by the direct measurements of plasma midazolam in three subjects: erythromycin increased plasma midazolam more than roxithromycin and enhanced midazolam effects following the intake of midazolam 10 mg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "22": "Ninety alcoholic patients with the secondary affective disorders (anxiety, depression) were divided into four groups. Patients in the first group received GABAB receptor ligands (baclofen), those in the second group, diazepam, those in the third group, amitriptyline and those in the fourth group, placebo. The results of clinical, psychological (tests of Spielberger, Zung and MMPI), and electrophysiological (superslow omega-potential) investigations showed that baclofen is an effective drug for affective disturbances in alcoholic patients, with efficacy superior to placebo and equal to diazepam and amitriptyline. At the same time baclofen does not have the side-effects and complications of the latter. Significant changes in platelet MAOB activity and the dopamine, serotonin and GABA concentrations in blood after treatment were not found in the four patient groups. The peripheral matabolism of GABA and monoamines do not seem to be related to the development of secondary affective disorders in alcoholic patients. This investigation encourages the search for drugs acting on the affective psychopathology of GABAB receptor ligands.",

Comparative efficacy of both drugs and placebo was conducted on 40 patients (archival data). Greater efficacy of Diazepam and Buspirone in states of chronic anxiety was indicated. There were no differences in the intensity of efficacy of both drugs. The effects of Buspirone were equally strong but more general on psychic and somatic anxiety, with the exception of sleep disturbance, in comparison with Diazepam. The efficacy of Buspirone increased after 2 weeks of application. No serious or intensified adverse effects were observed. The incidence of adverse effects was slightly higher in the Buspirone group, and included dizziness, weakness and disturbance of sleep. There were no significant changes in physical examination or laboratory measures.", 
    "25": "Death from cocaine intoxication results from one or more of the multiple mechanisms including seizures, cardiovascular collapse, or apnea. In the free-moving rat model, continuous seizures are a major cause of death. To study other mechanisms of death unrelated to seizures in this model, we suppressed lethal seizures with diazepam (DZP) and investigated the effect of several pharmacological agents. Rats were pretreated with vehicle alone, diazepam 5 mg/kg alone, or a combination of DZP plus either nifedipine (NIFD) 2 mg/kg, propranolol (PROP) 10 mg/kg, or prazosin (PRAZ) 5 mg/kg. Five minutes after pretreatment, all animals received cocaine 100 mg/kg. Each test group consisted of 15 animals and all agents were given IP. Two animals in each group had cortical electrodes implanted. Animals that received vehicle followed by cocaine had 100% incidence of seizures and death. Those rats that received DZP alone followed by cocaine had no seizures and 53% death. Rats that received DZP plus NIFD or DZP plus PROP had suppression of seizures but no significant change in the incidence of death. The group that received DZP and PRAZ followed by cocaine had no seizures and 13% incidence of death (p < 0.001). Electroencephalogram recordings showed cortical electrical spike activity or spike-and-wave afterdischarges in all animals clinically observed to have seizures. In the absence of clinical seizure activity, no significant cortical spike activity was noted. It is concluded that animals protected from seizures with diazepam can still have nonseizure deaths after high-dose cocaine. The incidence of death in these animals is not reduced with nifedipine or propranolol pretreatment but is reduced with prazosin pretreatment.",

In this report, we study the effects of chronic alprazolam (1 mg/kg/day), a central benzodiazepine agonist anxiolytic, on the influenza A (PR-8/34) virus specific immune injury in mice exposed to a chronic auditory stressor. Treatment with alprazolam resulted in a significant reduction of stress-induced increase of virus titters and pulmonary vascular permeability. A correlation with the lethality of mice was also observed.", 
    "27": "The present study was conducted to ascertain whether an anxiolytic effect of nitrous oxide was demonstrable in rats using the social interaction test and whether this drug effect might be mediated by benzodiazepine receptors. Compared to behavior of vehicle-pretreated, room air-exposed rats, rat pairs exposed to nitrous oxide showed a generally inverted U-shaped dose-response curve with the maximum increase in social interaction encounters occurring at 25% and significant increase in time of active social interaction at 15-35%; higher concentrations produced a sedative effect that reduced social interaction. Treatment with 5.0 mg/kg of the anxiolytic benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide also increased social interaction. Pretreatment with 10 mg/kg of the benzodiazepine receptor blocker flumazenil, which alone had no effect, significantly antagonized the social interaction-increasing effects of both nitrous oxide and chlordiazepoxide. In summary, these findings suggest that nitrous oxide produces a flumazenil-sensitive effect comparable to that of chlordiazepoxide and implicate central benzodiazepine mechanisms in mediation of the anxiolytic effect of nitrous oxide.",

The flow and viscosity curves, the initial, equilibrium and plastic viscosity as well as the Bingham's yield value of the systems were determined. It was found that the viscosity curves had two different parts in the examined shearing rate range: the part of greater rise described a definitive destruction of the system, while the part of smaller rise represented an equilibrium state. The values of the rheological parameters of the lipophilic and hydrophilic systems showed a definite difference, which was explained by the greater association of the hydrophilic bases.", 
    "30": "The changes in the distribution of the ionic species of a drug due to interactions with a clay surface may have important consequences in drug therapy. The binding of chlordiazepoxide (CDO) into montmorillonite clay, veegum: HV (V), surface was studied under several pH conditions. In vitro drug release behaviour from CDO-V products was investigated. Changes in the partial molar free energy of the ionic species of CDO, delta Gi (i = CDO, CDOH+) as a result of interaction with V were determined by using differential absorbance spectroscopic techniques at 260 and 310 nm. The stronger interaction between the negatively charged clay surface and the protonated species (CDOH+) relative to the parent compound is responsible for the apparent displacement of its pKa value in V suspensions from 4.64 to 5.67. In vitro drug release behaviour from CDO-V product to the simulated gastrointestinal fluids showed a controlled pattern. The in vivo results indicated a prolonged drug effect after the oral administration of drug-clay preparation.",

    "32": "Delirium tremens was first identified as being due to long-term excessive alcohol intake in 1813, but is now known to be associated with abrupt withdrawal of alcohol in chronically habituated persons. Recent publications quote an anticipated mortality rate of 15% to 20%. Our experience in the past 20 years has not confirmed that rate. This review reveals that the prevalence of fatal cases is extremely low, with the true mortality close to 0%. We believe that this decrement is due to the increasing use of benzodiazepines to detoxify alcoholic patients. It is postulated that the benzodiazepines act either to prevent delirium tremens or to reduce the neurotransmitter disruption in the central nervous system caused by excessive alcohol intake, or both.", 
    "33": "Zopiclone is a cyclopyrrolone which is chemically unrelated to the benzodiazepines and is thought to act on the GABAA receptor complex at a site distinct from, but closely related to, the benzodiazepine binding site. The hypnotic efficacy of zopiclone administered as single oral doses has been demonstrated in patients undergoing next-day surgery and in patients with insomnia, and these studies have established an optimal dose of 7.5mg for elderly patients. Using this dose, clinical studies have shown that zopiclone improved sleep in elderly patients to a similar extent as triazolam 0.125 to 0.5mg, flurazepam 15mg, and nitrazepam 5mg. Studies that also included younger patients have shown that zopiclone 7.5mg is at least as effective as triazolam 0.25 or 0.5mg, and on most sleep parameters is comparable to temazepam 20mg, nitrazepam 5mg, flunitrazepam 2mg, and flurazepam 20mg. Zopiclone causes minimal impairment to psychomotor performance and mental alertness the morning after night-time administration. The drug is generally well tolerated by patients of all ages; the most frequently reported adverse effects being bitter taste and dry mouth. Treatment withdrawal due to adverse effects is seldom required and reports of rebound insomnia after zopiclone withdrawal are rare. While symptoms of physical dependence have not been observed in clinical studies, there have been isolated reports of physical dependence in patients with a history of substance abuse. Although the latter finding should be kept in mind, it appears that zopiclone has a low dependence liability. Thus, with its short duration of action and good tolerability profile, zopiclone is a well established alternative to the benzodiazepine hypnotics and may be particularly beneficial in those patients unable or unwilling to tolerate the residual effects associated with many other hypnotic agents.", 
    "34": "Anonymous urine toxicology screening among parturient women during 1 month in 1990 and selective newborn testing during this and the subsequent 4-month period was done to assess prevalence of drug use among parturients in a municipal hospital in the Bronx and to assess impact of infant urine toxicology screening on discharge placement. Infant testing was performed for maternal history of drug use, poor prenatal care (5 or fewer visits), or infant symptoms. Urine was screened for cocaine, opiates, methadone, barbiturates, amphetamines, and benzodiazepines. Of 204 women screened, 9.3% were positive. Of these, 74% were positive for cocaine and 21% revealed polysubstance use. Only 28.6% of cocaine-positive mothers gave a history of use. Selective testing of 1196 newborns during this 5-month period revealed an apparent prevalence of cocaine exposure of 4.9%. Selective infant testing failed to identify 42.1% of newborns of cocaine-positive women. Social work evaluation was performed on all families and was the basis for reporting to state agencies for protective services. Only 6 of 83 drug-positive infants entered foster care, none because of positive toxicology per se. Selective infant toxicology studies miss many cocaine-exposed infants and has little impact on placement. Universal social work evaluation of families may be as effective and freer of bias than selective urine screening.", 
    "35": "The ion-molecule reactions of various 1,4-benzodiazepines and dimethyl ether ions were studied with a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. The methoxymethylene ions of dimethyl ether selectively react with 3-hydroxy-1,4-benzodiazepines (temazepam, oxazepam) to form (M+13)+ adducts by methylene substitution, and they react with 1,4-benzodiazepines that do not have hydroxyl substituents (diazepam, nordiazepam, nitrazepam) to form (M+15)+ adduct by a simple methyl cation transfer. These adducts are formed by elimination of methanol or formaldehyde, respectively, from (M+CH2OCH3)+ precursor ions. Ion-molecule reactions of model compounds with dimethyl ether ions suggest that the reactive site in the formation of (M+15)+ adducts is the imine functional group of the 1,4-benzodiazepines, while the reactive site for formation of (M+13)+ adducts involves a functional group interaction between the hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups. Fragmentation induced by chemical ionization and collisionally activated dissociation provides further structural information for the differentiation of 1,4-benzodiazepines. Also, the gas-phase basicities of diazepam and temazepam have been estimated by bracketing techniques to be between 220.7 and 222.2 kcal/mol.", 
    "36": "We studied seven male patients with moderate to severe congestive heart failure (CHF) [left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) = 22.4 +/- 6.7; mean +/- SD] in a double-blind crossover trial to determine the effects of temazepam 15 mg on arousability, sleep architecture, Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) and nighttime oxygen saturation. Sleep architecture was not markedly improved with temazepam. There was no significant change in total sleep time (TST) (383.1 +/- 14.1 minutes to 396.6 +/- 15.4 minutes, p = ns) (mean +/- SE, placebo vs. temazepam) or total wake time (TWT) (96.9 +/- 14.0 vs. 81.4 +/- 14.0 minutes, p = ns). Sleep stage proportions did not change appreciably except for a reduction in stage 1 sleep (6.7 +/- 1.2% vs. 4.0 +/- 1.0%, p < 0.05). Microarousals per hour of sleep decreased with temazepam (21.1 +/- 2.7/hour vs. 13.9 +/- 2.1/hour placebo, p < 0.05), with the largest change occurring in stage 2 (24.9 +/- 5.4/hour vs. 15.0 +/- 3.1/hour, p < 0.05). Wake time during sleep (WDS) was reduced from 82.5 +/- 11.7 minutes to 54.5 +/- 9.4 minutes, p < 0.03. Daytime alertness was improved with temazepam as was indicated by an increase in mean latency to sleep [multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) = 7.1 +/- 2.4 vs. 5.7 +/- 2.0 minutes, p < 0.04) on days following treatment with temazepam. There was no significant change in CSR as a percentage of TST (38.7 +/- 13.6% vs. 32.5 +/- 11.8%, p = ns). However, the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) (10% filter) was decreased in stage 1 (28.1 +/- 9.7/hour vs. 15.6 +/- 8.2/hour). Overnight oxygen saturation did not change with temazepam (95.1 +/- 0.6% both nights) and the percentage of TST spent below 90% oxygen saturation was minimal for both conditions (1.5 +/- 1.1% vs. 2.2 +/- 1.7%, p = ns). We conclude that CHF patients with CSR experience frequent arousals and that these arousals can be reduced with temazepam. There was an improvement in daytime somnolence. There was no worsening of nighttime oxygen saturation.", 
    "37": "Nine patients with stable cardiac failure and mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% were investigated. All had previously been prescribed a benzodiazepine hypnotic by their home physicians, but the medication had been discontinued for at least 1 month. Subjects were monitored under three conditions: 1) without any sleeping medication, 2) during nasal CPAP administration and 3) at two points during a month-long administration of the benzodiazepine that had initially been prescribed to them. Overall, the benzodiazepine hypnotic improved the sleep fragmentation noted in these patients by decreasing the arousal index from a mean of 18 +/- 6 per hour at baseline to a mean of 9 +/- 6.5 per hour after one month of benzodiazepine therapy. Total nocturnal sleep time was consequently improved [baseline mean nocturnal total sleep time: 313 +/- 27.3 minutes; benzodiazepine mean nocturnal total sleep time: 350 +/- 17.3 minutes (p < 0.0003)], as was sleep efficiency. However, the benzodiazepine hypnotic had no significant effect on central hypopneas or apneas [baseline mean respiratory disturbance index (RDI): 20.5 +/- 5.85 events/hour; mean RDI after 1 month of drug intake: 21.3 +/- 2.5 events/hour]. Nasal CPAP was also ineffective on the disordered breathing. In this group of subjects, respiration was even significantly worsened with nasal CPAP compared to baseline, as indicated by RDI (p < 0.0001), lowest SaO2 (p < 0.0001) and total nocturnal sleep time (p < 0.0001) measurements.", 
    "38": "The ability of amylodextrin (a linear dextrin) to act as a complexing agent or as a carrier for solid dispersion was evaluated. Blends of amylodextrin with diazepam or prednisolone were freeze-dried and kneaded at elevated temperatures, respectively. The products were analyzed by DSC, X-ray diffractometry, and FTIR spectroscopy. Complex formation with amylodextrin by freeze-drying was found not to occur for diazepam but for prednisolone at a molar ratio of 1 to 1. The freeze-dried product of diazepam with amylodextrin proved to be a solid dispersion. Solid dispersions were formed by both wet (with ethanol) and dry kneading at elevated temperatures of low-melting drugs such as lidocain, diazepam, and methyl-PABA with amylodextrin. No solid dispersions were obtained for high-melting drugs such as prednisolone and salicylic acid. The results point to the formation of solid dispersions by a melting mechanism during the process of kneading at elevated temperatures of low-melting drugs with amylodextrin.", 
    "39": "Adult male White Leghorn chickens were used in an experimental model system to study atherogenesis, and the effects of an atherogenic diet on plasma lipoprotein composition including carotenoids were determined. This model also included treatment with diazepam, a drug known to reduce formation of atherogenic plaques. After 6 wk consumption of a high-cholesterol, high-triglyceride diet, chickens had mean total plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, and carotenoid concentrations that were significantly increased over those from chicks that consumed the standard diet. Diazepam treatment had no significant effect on whole plasma concentrations of these lipids. Total body weight gain was unaffected by diet, but liver weight expressed as percentage of body weight was significantly increased in chickens that consumed the atherogenic diet. High density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) fractions were isolated from plasma samples by ultracentrifugation. The atherogenic diet increased the carotenoid, cholesterol, and protein content of the LDL fractions but not the HDL fractions.", 
    "40": "R-cognin, a cell recognition molecule, and insulin are known to play significant roles in GABAergic differentiation in the developing chick retina. In the present study, the effects of insulin and R-cognin on post-synaptic (GABAceptive) differentiation were investigated. In ovo binding of [3H]GABA and [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]Flu) to the GABA and benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors, respectively, remained at low levels during early embryogenesis but increased sharply from mid-embryogenesis through hatching, increases which also occur in cultured neurons from early-embryonic (E7) and mid-embryonic (E11) chick retina. E7 neurons respond to insulin treatment (100 ng/ml) with increased [3H]Flu binding but no change in [3H]GABA binding. Cognin antibody (10 micrograms/ml) treatment of E7 neurons caused no significant inhibition of the developmental increases in binding of either radioligand. Insulin in E11 cultures led to greater developmental increases in binding sites for both radioligands, but exposure to cognin antibody was without significant effect. These data, along with previous studies, indicate that GABAergic differentiation in developing chick retina is regulated, in part, by insulin and cognin-mediated cell signaling. Insulin also regulates post-synaptic (GABAceptive) differentiation whereas cognin-mediated interactions are relatively insignificant.", 
    "41": "In addition to the known binding of norharman (NH) to monoamine oxidase (MAO) and benzodiazepine (BZ) binding sites (at microM concentrations), a distinct class of high-affinity NH binding sites was discovered in rat brain. Investigations of several organs of the rat led to the discovery of high affinity binding sites in the liver, which successfully could be solubilized from P2 membrane homogenate (0.25% w/v Triton X-100). Scatchard analysis revealed an apparent KD value of 26 +/- 8 nM and a maximum number of binding sites of 11 +/- 3 pmol/mg protein (n = 14). Association kinetics showed that equilibrium was nearly reached after two hours. Dissociation was totally complete only after more than 16 hours. The MAO-inhibitors examined did not influence the binding characteristics. No displacement of specific binding could be found by haloperidol.", 
    "42": "The benzodiazepines are a class of drugs that are widely used in the treatment of various psychiatric disorders. One member of this class, oxazepam, is also a common metabolite of several other benzodiazepines. Since the evidence for the genetic toxicity and carcinogenic properties of these compounds is inconsistent, we investigated the oxazepam-induced formation of micronuclei in Syrian Hamster embryo fibroblast (SHE) cells, human amniotic fluid fibroblast-like (AFFL) cells and L5178Y mouse cells. A dose-dependent increase in micronucleus fractions was found in all three cell lines. The time course of micronucleus induction in L5178Y cells showed a maximum at 5 h after treatment, suggesting that the micronuclei were formed in the first mitosis after treatment. Kinetochore staining (CREST-antiserum) revealed the presence of kinetochores in approximately 50% of the micronuclei in all three cell types. This result was further confirmed by in situ hybridization in L5178Y cells and indicates the presence of whole chromosomes or centric fragments as well as acentric fragments in the oxazepam-induced micronuclei. The L5178Y cells did not show a mutagenic response to oxazepam at any of the doses or expression times used.", 
    "43": "Certain new (1-15) or previously described (16-25) 1,2,3-triazole derivatives, characterized by a C-benzoyl substituent, were synthesized and tested for their ability to displace [3H]flunitrazepam from bovine brain membrane. Compounds 11a and 9a, bearing neutral and lipophilic substituents (phenethyl and cyclohexyl, respectively) showed the higher activity. The 5-benzoyl isomer 11b presented a lower activity, equivalent to that of the triazole acetic derivative 23, which is 4-benzyl substituted. Generally, the carboxymethyl radical in the 1-position of the triazole ring decreased the activity, probably because of intramolecular hydrogen bonding with the carbonyl function of the benzoyl substituent. The N-1 unsubstituted triazole derivatives 24 and 25 were ineffective; this result is in disagreement with our previous observations. Probably these molecules interact with the receptor site by a hydrogen bonding acceptor group and by a bulky and lipophilic portion or a hydrogen bonding donor function that is appropriately arranged.", 
    "44": "Triazolam is an effective hypnotic that can cause amnesia and psychomotor performance decrements, particularly after a 0.5 mg dose. Previous pharmacodynamic studies suggested a relationship between these effects and triazolam plasma concentration. A novel dual release bilayer tablet was designed to mimic the onset of action of a 0.25 mg dose and to maintain the duration of a 0.5 mg dose without the side effects associated with the 0.5 mg dose. The immediate release component of the bilayer tablet contained 0.25 mg triazolam while the sustained release component contained 0.15 mg triazolam. Two prototype formulations of the bilayer tablet, differing in rate of release in the sustained release component, were tested against a conventional 0.5 mg triazolam compressed tablet and placebo in a single-dose, double-blind, four-way crossover study in healthy male subjects. Triazolam plasma concentration time profile was obtained over 12 hours following single administration of each treatment. Effects of triazolam on central nervous system function were evaluated using psychomotor performance tests, immediate and delayed recall tests and rating of sedation. The triazolam plasma concentrations were not significantly different among the active drug treatments, although the dual release tablets did give the expected profiles. There were significant differences in triazolam effects on memory and psychomotor performance. The slowest releasing dual-release tablet showed significantly less psychomotor impairment and memory deficit than the conventional tablet. There was no difference in sedation among the active drug treatments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "45": "A sexual dimorphism in stress-induced alterations in renal peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) was recently reported. The present paper includes five experiments examining the etiology of this sex difference. Surgical removal of ovaries and testes was ineffective in altering the renal PBR stress response in both male and female rats. A diurnal variation in the sexual dimorphism was observed; the difference was seen in the early part of the light cycle, while the two sexes were indistinguishable at the end of the light cycle. Finally, based on recent data indicating the importance of the renin-angiotensin system in the stress-induced decrease in renal PBR, we examined both stress-induced plasma renin activity and renal PBR reactivity to exogenous angiotensin II (AII) administration in both sexes. Female rats show both an attenuated elevation of plasma renin levels in response to inescapable shock stress and a reduced PBR response to AII administration in comparison to males. The present data indicate that the renin-angiotensin system may be a critical factor in the sexual dimorphism in the renal PBR response to stress. The possibility of this difference in the renin-angiotensin system contributing to sex differences in susceptibility to escape deficits following inescapable shock is entertained. The implications for these findings regarding the physiological function of the PBR are also discussed.", 
    "46": "All events prolonging an endoscopic procedure or recovery, or requiring a medication or an intervention, were analyzed from a consecutive sample of 508 patients receiving conscious sedation. Although 102 events were identified (20%), 33 of these (7%) were major. These included four episodes of apnea and four patients with a prompt and sustained fall in oxygenation during the procedure; 19 additional patients had a decrease to less than 89% in oxygen saturation in the 30 minutes after the completion of the procedure. The patients with observed events had significantly more major illnesses, a higher fraction older than 70 years, and a higher fraction of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography than those without events (p < 0.05) but had a similar dose of sedative medications, mean age, and fraction of colonoscopies.", 
    "47": "1. Systemic injections of kainic acid, 10 mg kg-1, into adult rats resulted in lesions in the hippocampus, as assessed by peripheral benzodiazepine ligand binding. Co-administration of clonazepam at 1 mg kg-1 or 0.2 mg kg-1 prevented major seizures associated with kainate injections, but did not alter significantly the production of hippocampal damage. 2. The co-administration of the adenosine A1 agonist R-phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA, 25 micrograms kg-1, i.p.) abolished the lesions induced by kainic acid. 3. The presence of the selective A1 antagonist, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (250 or 50 micrograms kg-1, i.p.) abolished the R-PIA neuroprotective action. 4. The A1/A2 antagonist, 8-(p-sulphophenyl)theophylline (20 mg kg-1, i.p.) which cannot cross the blood brain barrier, did not alter significantly the neuroprotective action of R-PIA, indicating that the neuroprotective action of the purine may be predominantly central. 5. The time course of the neuroprotection was also examined. R-PIA was effective when administered 2 h before or after kainate administration. 6. The results emphasise the potential utility of systemically active adenosine A1 receptor ligands in reducing CNS gliosis induced by the activation of excitatory amino acid receptors.", 
    "48": "1. Intravenous administration of cholecystokinin (CCK) results in a transient activation of oxytocin neurones in the rat, and hence to oxytocin secretion: this activation is followed by expression of c-fos mRNA and of Fos-like immunoreactivity (Fos-LI) in magnocellular oxytocin neurones. Fos-like immunoreactivity is also induced in the regions of the brainstem that are thought to relay information from the periphery to the hypothalamus. 2. Administration of the selective CCKA receptor antagonist MK-329, but not the CCKB receptor antagonist L-365,260, prior to CCK injection, prevented oxytocin release as measured by radioimmunoassay and oxytocin neuronal activation as measured by electrophysiology and by the lack of induction of c-fos mRNA. 3. MK-329 abolished the release of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) following injection of CCK. 4. MK-329 prevented the expression of Fos-LI in the hypothalamic magnocellular nuclei and in the area postrema and dorsal vagal complex of the brainstem. 5. L-365,260 had no effect on the expression of Fos-LI in the brainstem, but attenuated that seen in the hypothalamic magnocellular nuclei. 6. We conclude that CCK acts on CCKA receptors, either in the area postrema or on peripheral endings of the vagus nerve, to cause the release of hypothalamic oxytocin and ACTH. Information may be carried to the hypothalamus in part by CCK acting at CCKB receptors.", 
    "49": "The role of superoxide radicals and the protective effects of superoxide dismutase (SOD), allopurinol, 16,16-dimethyl-prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2), cimetidine and pirenzepine in diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC)-treated rats were evaluated. Pretreatment with Cu,Zn-SOD (superoxide radical scavenger) 60,000 units/kg, allopurinol (competitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase) 50 mg/kg, dmPGE2 (prostaglandin analogue) 10 micrograms/kg, cimetidine (H2-receptor antagonist) 10 mg/kg or pirenzepine (selective antimuscarinic drug) 10 mg/kg all significantly reduced the DDC-induced (800 mg/kg) gastric antral ulcer formation in rats. DDC treatment substantially decreases the gastric mucosal Cu,Zn-SOD activity. In this study treatment with DDC and SOD, DDC and dmPGE2, DDC and cimetidine, and DDC and pirenzepine were demonstrated significantly to prevent the decrease of gastric mucosal Cu,Zn-SOD activity. However, allopurinol did not have this effect. The results suggest that SOD and/or superoxide radicals may play an important role in the mechanism of DDC-induced gastric antral ulcer. The protective property against ulcer formation of these drugs studied might be due to the action of SOD in the gastric mucosa.", 
    "50": "This preliminary study determined certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) practice experience and educational needs in the preoperative evaluation of patients using patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) for chronic and cancer pain management. A convenience sample (N = 29) of CRNAs practicing in a university teaching hospital completed the surveys developed by the investigator. Survey items related to CRNA experience with management of patients using PCA preoperatively, PCA modes of opioid delivery, and use of adjuvant medication for chronic and cancer pain patients. Results of the study indicated that 79% of CRNAs reported experience in administration of anesthesia to one or more patients who used PCA preoperatively. However, only 32% of CRNAs surveyed reported knowledge of the modes of opioid delivery available. Results also indicated that 48% of CRNAs were not familiar with adjuvant medications (ie, tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, steroids, and anticonvulsants), which are often prescribed in combination with opioids in chronic pain management. The respondents reported use of a variety of methods in handling opioid and infusion devices for patients using PCA preoperatively. Fifty-two percent of CRNAs disconnected the infusion and discarded the opioid preoperatively. Fourteen percent reported leaving the PCA device connected to the patient for use perioperatively or for continued pain management postoperatively. Based upon the findings of this preliminary study, CRNA education in management techniques for the use of PCA infusions in chronic and cancer pain is recommended.",

To determine the role of endogenously released CCK in the control of food intake in rhesus monkeys, we examined the ability of the selective type A and type B CCK antagonists devazepide and L-365260 to affect total daily food intake and various meal patterns. Various doses of the antagonists were administered intragastrically 30 min before a daily 4-h feeding period. One-gram food pellets were delivered in response to lever pulls, and intake was computer monitored. Intragastric administration of the type A CCK receptor antagonist devazepide (10-320 micrograms/kg) significantly increased food intake in a dose-related fashion. The threshold for increasing intake was 32 micrograms/kg, and a maximal effect was obtained at a dose of 100 micrograms/kg that increased total 4-h food intake by 47%. The effect of devazepide on food intake was mediated by significant increases in the size and duration of the initial meal, lengthening of the subsequent intermeal interval, and a decrease in the satiety ratio (intermeal interval/1st meal size). In contrast, intragastric administration of the type B CCK receptor antagonist L-365260 (3.2-320 micrograms/kg) did not significantly affect total food intake or any of the meal parameters. These data demonstrate that endogenously released CCK acting through type A CCK receptors plays a role in regulating food intake in rhesus monkeys.", 
    "59": "To examine the mechanism of the satiety-producing effect of cholecystokinin (CCK) in the central nervous system, we compared the potency of intraperitoneally (ip) or intracerebroventricularly (icv) administered CCK-8 and its analogues on food intake in fasted mice. The icv administration of a small dose of CCK-8 (0.03 nmol/brain) or of Suc-(Thr28, Leu29, MePhe33)-CCK-7 (0.001 nmol/brain) suppressed food intake for 20 min, whereas CCK-8 (1 nmol/kg, which is equivalent to 0.03 nmol/brain) or Suc-(Thr28, Leu29, MePhe33)-CCK-7 (1 nmol/kg) had satiety effect after ip administration. Dose-response studies indicated the following rank order of potency: Suc-CCK-7 > or = Suc-(Thr28, Leu29, MePhe33)-CCK-7 > or = CCK-8 > or = (Nle28,31)-CCK-8 > desulfated CCK-8 = CCK-4 = 0 in the case of ip administration and Suc-(Thr28, Leu29, MePhe33)-CCK-7 > Suc-CCK-7 > or = CCK-8 > or = (Nle28,31)-CCK-8 > desulfated CCK-8 = CCK-4 = 0 in the case of icv administration. The selective CCK-A receptor antagonist MK-329 reversed the inhibitory effect of the centrally as well as peripherally administered CCK-8, or of Suc-(Thr28, Leu29, MePhe33)-CCK-7, whereas the selective CCK-B receptor antagonist L-365260 did not. The icv administered CCK-8 did not appear in the peripheral circulation. These findings suggest the participation of CCK-A receptors in the brain in mediating the satiety effect of CCK and the difference in CCK-A receptors in the brain and peripheral tissues.", 
    "60": "[N-methyl-3H]scopolamine methylchloride ([3H]NMS) was used to characterize the muscarinic receptors (mAChRs) in the intact cardiomyocytes. The specific binding of [3H]NMS was proportional to cell concentration, saturable with respect to [3H]NMS concentration, and time dependent. Scatchard analysis of binding isotherms showed that [3H]NMS bound to the freshly isolated and cultured cardiomyocytes with dissociation constants of 275 +/- 64 and 207 +/- 20 pM as well as maximum receptor densities of 0.13 +/- 0.09 and 5.36 +/- 0.20 fmol/10(5) cells, respectively. Heterogeneity of mAChRs was demonstrated by competitive binding experiments against [3H]NMS with M2 and M3 antagonists. These receptors (80%) exhibited high affinities for 11-([2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]-acetyl)-5,11-dihydro- 6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX-116) and methoctramine similar to those of M2 subtype. The low-affinity M2 antagonist binding constants were close to those reported for M3 receptors and possessed high affinity for 4-diphenylacetoxyl-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) and hexahydrosiladifenidol. On the basis of biochemical studies, AF-DX-116 blocked adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) inhibition with high affinity (pKB 7.4), while it antagonized inositol phosphate formation with low affinity (pKB 6.5). 4-DAMP possessed high affinity in blocking inositol phosphate formation (pKB 9.0) and low affinity for antagonism of cAMP inhibition (pKB 7.7). Although no other muscarinic receptor mRNA has been detected in these cells, these data suggest the presence of a second population of mAChRs, which may not be identical to the classical cardiac \"M2\" receptors.", 
    "61": "Delirium tremens might last for weeks and treatment requires massive benzodiazepine doses, yet it is possible to manage patients with this condition successfully. In this case of delirium tremens, standard agents at the usual recommended doses were not sufficient to achieve control of confusion and agitation or to stabilize neurologic and cardiovascular parameters. The patient required extraordinarily high doses of central nervous system depressants for an extended period. Midazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine, was used but was associated with metabolic acidosis and was extremely expensive. Although high-dose midazolam should probably be avoided, extremely high dose benzodiazepine use for an extended period might be necessary in some cases. In this circumstance we advise diazepam because of its low cost and relative safety. The tendencies to withhold large doses for fear of side effects or to give up in cases requiring prolonged intensive support must be resisted to minimize the mortality from this severe illness.", 
    "62": "We report on a 33-year-old female suffering from frequent complex-partial seizures who developed a non-convulsive status epilepticus after one week of antiepileptic therapy with valproate (VPA) which had been added to a basic medication with barbexaclone (BBC) in rapidly increasing dosage. The electroencephalogram (EEG) showed continuous rhythmic generalized sharp and slow wave activity with a frontal maximum. Intravenous administration of 3.0 mg of the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor antagonist flumazenil under monitoring with video-EEG led to an immediate and marked electroclinical improvement, whereas 6.0 mg of the BZ receptor agonist midazolam was followed by a deterioration both clinically and in the EEG. We discuss the concept of VPA-encephalopathy and the possible mechanisms of the action of flumazenil on VPA-induced as well as on other toxic and metabolic encephalopathies. Flumazenil might antagonize increased benzodiazepine receptor activity with agonistic and even convulsive properties in these encephalopathic syndromes. Further investigations are needed concerning the relation of drug-induced or metabolic encephalopathies and central benzodiazepine receptor activity. We recommend a therapeutic trial with flumazenil, if stupor or decreased seizure control develop in patients treated with valproate.", 
    "63": "The compatibility and stability of flumazenil mixed with aminophylline, dobutamine hydrochloride, dopamine hydrochloride, cimetidine hydrochloride, famotidine, ranitidine hydrochloride, heparin sodium, lidocaine hydrochloride, or procainamide hydrochloride were studied. Flumazenil (1.0 mg) was mixed with each of the other drugs in polyvinyl chloride minibags containing 50 mL of 5% dextrose injection to achieve concentrations commonly used when the drugs are administered by continuous i.v. infusion. All admixtures were analyzed for color change, pH, and particulate matter. Flumazenil concentrations were measured by a stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatographic assay at baseline and 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after mixing. No detectable changes in color, pH, or particulate matter were observed. In the presence of each drug except dopamine hydrochloride, at least 95% of initial flumazenil concentration was present 24 hours after mixing. Flumazenil in the presence of dopamine hydrochloride was stable for 12 hours. Flumazenil was visually compatible and chemically stable when admixed with 5% dextrose injection and selected drugs.", 
    "64": "Forty-two children with ingestion of foreign bodies (FB) were managed conservatively. Thirty one (74%) of them were under 5 years of age. At presentation history revealed accidental ingestion in 95% and of being put in the oral cavity by elder sibs in 5% patients. Fifty seven per cent had respiratory distress, 38% had dysphagia and 12% had hematemesis. Foreign bodies were located in the gastrointestinal tract in the stomach (40%), esophagus (26%), small intestine (19%), duodenum (12%) and rectum (2%). A large majority of the FB were constituted by household objects. All the FB above the duodenojejunal junction and one in the rectum were retrieved successfully with fiberoptic endoscopes. In 19% patients, the FB had crossed duodenojejunal junction, and had come out in the stools during 4-5 days observation and these were mostly round in shape. Endoscopic procedures were carried out under intravenous diazepam or ketamine sedation. On endoscopic examination, 21% of them showed erosions in stomach and/or esophagus. No complications of endoscopic procedure or sedation were observed and none of the patients required surgical removal. Removal of FB with flexible fiberoptic endoscopes is less invasive and the best therapeutic option to avoid preventable complications of FB ingestion. In this procedure there is need of a trained and skilled Pediatric endoscopist with lot of patience and a good team work.", 
    "65": "Nitrazepam was found to form an inclusion complex with heptakis; 2,6 di-O-methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (DM-beta-CD) in solution. The phase solubility diagram was found to be AL type with no precipitation of the inclusion complex formed. The kinetic studies of nitrazepam hydrolysis in DM-beta-CD solution at 30, 40 and 50 degrees C was followed spectrophotometrically, as the degradation products of the drug did not interfere with such assay. It was found that the degradation of nitrazepam in acidic media followed the first order reaction kinetics at the temperatures studied. Inclusion complexation of nitrazepam in DM-beta-CD resulted in a relatively improved stability of the drug in solution at 30 degrees C. On the other hand, no appreciable stabilization was achieved at higher temperatures (40 and 50 degrees C).", 
    "66": "When singly housed under laboratory conditions, male Syrian golden hamsters routinely attack novel conspecific intruders introduced into their home cages. As we report here, after being repeatedly defeated by a larger, more aggressive intruder, such normal territorial aggression on the part of the resident hamsters is replaced by defensive behavior and flight. We have found that such conditioned defeat (CD) can be reliably induced by a series of 5-min trials with an aggressive intruder whether these trials are spread over 4 days or are all given on the same day. A useful behavioral criterion for the appearance of CD during acquisition is the first occurrence of anticipatory flight (AF), i.e., the first time the resident flees from the next aggressive intruder before being attacked. CD shows generalization: Animals trained to the AF criterion (AF Group) subsequently show defensive behavior toward, and even flee from, intruders which show absolutely no sign of aggressiveness. Animals in the AF Group persisted in such defense behavior for two test sessions; animals given three additional defeat trials beyond the appearance of AF (AF + 3 Group) showed a greater magnitude and persistence of defense and flight. A comparison of CD-trained animals which met a non-aggressive intruder (NAI) every day for 5 days to similarly trained animals which met the intruder only on the fifth day after acquisition suggests that CD diminishes passively as a function of time and not as the consequence of repeated encounters with a nonaggressive stimulus animal. We also found that near ideal NAIs could be prepared by treating nonaggressive hamsters with high doses of diazepam: animals so treated locomote more or less continuously around the cage virtually ignoring the subject. An unexpected observation was that subjects in the AF Group tended to closely follow these diazepam-treated, rapidly locomoting NAIs around the cage. Following may be an example of the \"risk assessment\" activities directed toward a potential threat. The development of a rapid and reliable technique for inducing CD in hamsters sets the stage for further physiological and pharmacological work on this interesting phenomenon.", 
    "67": "A double-blind, randomized controlled trial using an electroencephalograph computerized analysis and cartography was carried out to investigate the spectral modifications induced by diazepam and hydroxyzine. Without monitoring response to stimulation, the spectra found for diazepam and for hydroxyzine were qualitatively very similar, showing increase of the slow waves, reduction of the alpha rhythm and accentuation of the beta 1 rhythms. These traces suggested strongly that both drugs had produced a sedative, anti-anxiety effect. The intensity of the effect produced by 50 mg of hydroxyzine appeared to be less than that produced by 10 mg diazepam. After monitoring response to stimulation, the spectra were modified and the reactivity of the two drugs differed with regard to the slow delta, theta and alpha 1 frequency bands. It was possible to distinguish between the sedative and anti-anxiety effects of both diazepam and hydroxyzine. Even if the two drugs had some similar effects, the mode of action in the central nervous system was certainly different, as can be seen from the characteristics of distribution of the slow waves, their reactivity and, with regard to frequency, the fluctuation of the dominant frequency of rapid rhythms.", 
    "68": "The time courses of the effects of acute doses of amphetamine (5 and 10 mg/70 kg), alcohol (0.3 and 0.6 g/kg), diazepam (5 and 10 mg/70 kg), and marijuana (2.0% and 3.5% delta 9-THC) on performance engendered by each of four computerized behavioral tasks were evaluated in six human subjects. These performance-based tasks have potential commercial utility for drug-use detection in the workplace. Alcohol and marijuana effects were reliably detected for up to three hours following dose administration with most procedures. Amphetamine and diazepam effects were also detected, but the dose effects and time courses were variable. The profile of behavioral effects varied across drugs, suggesting that performance-based testing procedures might be useful in discriminating which drug was administered and the time course of the drug's effects. Results indicate that repeated measurement with performance-based drug detection procedures can provide immediate indications of performance impairment in a cost-effective and noninvasive manner and, as such, would be a useful supplement to biological sample testing for drug-use detection.",

    "70": "Duration of neuromuscular block may be prolonged by H1/H2 antagonists. This study was designed to determine the influence of H1/H2 antagonist treatment on onset, duration and recovery after mivacurium chloride (MIV), a new nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent with a relatively short duration of action, which is metabolized by human plasma cholinesterase (PChE). METHODS. After approval from the hospital ethical committee and written informed consent, 48 ASA I-II patients of either sex (ages 18-65 years, weight 45-100 kg) were included in this double blind study and randomly allocated to four groups of 12 each: group A, 0.105 mg/kg MIV (1.5 x ED95) and H1/H2 antagonist; group B, 0.105 mg/kg MIV and placebo; group C, 0.21 mg/kg MIV (3 x ED95) and H1/H2 antagonist; Group D 0.21 mg/kg MIV and placebo. Premedication consisted of 2 mg lormetazepam p.o., 300 mg ranitidine and 0.1 mg/kg dimetindene, or placebo p.o. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone (5-7 mg/kg) and maintained with N2O/O2 at a 65/35 ratio, enflurane (0.8-1.5%) and supplements of fentanyl. The ulnar nerve was stimulated with supramaximal 2 Hz train-of-four (TOF) every 10 s. Neuromuscular twitch response was recorded with EMG. Onset time (time from end of injection to maximal or total block), maximal block (%), T125 (time from end of injection to 25% recovery) were recorded after each dose, and recovery index (T1 from 25% to 75% recovery) and TOF70 (time from end of injection to TOF ratio of 70%), after the last dose. RESULTS. The four groups did not differ with respect to age, weight or height. There was no difference in the pharmacodynamics of mivacurium between the groups receiving H1/H2 antagonists and those receiving placebo. Following 1.5 x ED95 the onset was at 3.7 +/- 1.2 (H1/H2) and 3.8 +/- 0.9 min (placebo), respectively. Clinical duration (T125) was 13.1 +/- 3.4 and 12.8 +/- 3.4 min. 3 x ED95 led to a significant faster onset and longer duration (P < or = 0.05). Onset was at 1.9 +/- 0.7 (H1/H2) and 2.1 +/- 0.5 min (placebo), respectively, and clinical duration 19.1 +/- 6.1 and 19.3 +/- 3.8 min. Duration of repetitive doses (10.1 +/- 5.3 min), recovery index (6.8 +/- 2.9 min) and interval from last dose to spontaneous recovery (22.4 +/- 7.0 min) did not differ between groups. Three patients in group D (placebo and 0.21 mg/kg MIV) had haemodynamic changes of over 20% from baseline. Flush and erythema were significantly less pronounced after H1/H2 premedication than after placebo (4 vs 12 pts). CONCLUSIONS. Our results suggest that time of onset and clinical duration of effects of MIV are not altered by dimetindene and ranitidine. The duration depends more heavily on the dose of MIV. The recovery of neuromuscular function, once it has begun, is prolonged neither by MIV nor by H1/H2 antagonists. As MIV is mainly broken down by PChE, it is evident that its duration of action is more prolonged by atypical PChE activity than by interaction with other drugs. Oral H1/H2 premedication may diminish haemodynamic side-effects and clinical signs of histamine release.", 
    "71": "The fatal toxicity indices of benzodiazepines during the 1980s were calculated from national prescribing data and mortality statistics. The overall rate was 5.9 deaths per million prescriptions for benzodiazepines taken alone or with alcohol only, anxiolytics being less toxic than hypnotics. Diazepam appeared more toxic than average among anxiolytics (P < 0.05), and flurazepam and temazepam more toxic than average among hypnotics (both P < 0.001). It was shown that the finding for diazepam was probably explained by concurrent use of alcohol, which implies that other anxiolytics may be safer in cases where there is alcohol misuse; but the greater toxicity of flurazepam and temazepam remained unexplained. Benzodiazepines are indeed much less toxic than the barbiturates they superseded, but they are not innocuous and temazepam in particular requires further evaluation.", 
    "72": "We assessed rates of hip fracture before and after the institution of the triplicate prescription policy for benzodiazepines in New York State. All patients 55 years of age or older who had a diagnosis of hip fracture between January 1, 1986, and June 30, 1991, were considered for the study. Patients with severe trauma, neoplasm, arthritis, or second admission were excluded. Rates of hip fracture were calculated for each quarter by age and gender. Benzodiazepine prescribing began to decline immediately after the triplicate prescription regulation went into effect on January 1, 1989. However, yearly rates of hip fracture for women (men) > or = 75 years of age per 1000 people adjusted for New York population changes remained stable at 13.8 (6.5), 12.6 (5.7), 14.7 (6.7), 14.8 (6.4), 14.4 (6.3), and 14.4 (6.7), from 1986 through the first two quarters of 1991. Regression analyses showed no before or after regulation trend in the rate of hip fracture. We conclude that no dramatic declines in the rate of hip fractures among people older than 55 years of age have been observed in association with the benzodiazepine regulations and decreased benzodiazepine prescribing.",

These compounds possess high affinity for the benzodiazepine binding site on the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor in rat cerebrocortical membranes with Ki values of 0.98 nM (RP 59037) and 1.16 nM (RP 60503). Neither compound discriminates between the putative benzodiazepine BZ1 and BZ2 binding site subtypes present in the rat cerebellum and hippocampus, respectively. Both compounds protect mice against pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures with ID50 values of 0.21 mg.kg-1 p.o. (RP 59037) and 5.96 mg.kg-1 p.o. (RP 60503). The two compounds displayed a restricted anticonvulsant profile compared to diazepam and, in this respect, resembled the pyrazoloquinoline partial agonist, CGS 9896. RP 59037 and RP 60503 were active in two rat models predictive of anxiolytic drug action, a modified Geller-Seifter conflict paradigm (minimal effective dose, 0.33 mg.kg-1 p.o. for RP 59037 and 5 mg.kg-1 p.o. for RP 60503) and the elevated plus maze (minimal effective dose, 0.33 mg.kg-1 p.o. for RP 59037 and 5 mg.kg-1 p.o. for RP 60503). Only very low activities were observed in tests of sedative or myorelaxant effects (ED50 > 50 mg.kg-1 p.o.). It is concluded that the two cyclopyrrolones possess a dissociated behavioral profile, displaying potent anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties with little or no sedative or myorelaxant effects. Although both compounds appear to be partial agonists at their allosteric recognition site on the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor, RP 60503 seems to be more dissociated than RP 59037, which would be compatible with it having lower intrinsic activity. This difference is reflected in a higher receptor occupancy requirement for activity, and a smaller modulatory effect on the binding of t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphothionate.",

Quality of care deficits discerned included (1) inadequate pharmacotherapy of alcoholic and nonalcoholic delirium, (2) inadequate search for treatable causes of delirium (thyroid, B12, and folate deficiencies), (3) insufficient awareness of persistent cognitive deficits, which influence the patient's ability to care for himself or give informed consent. The knowledge and skills deficits we found are not unique to this hospital and reflect the failure of most graduate programs to reinforce basic psychiatric teaching.

Their physical status and average age were ASA I or II and 41 +/- 10.0 years old. Premedication included intramuscular injection of pethidine, atropine and promethazine. Epidural anesthesia was accomplished with 15 ml 2% lidocaine with epinephrine (1:80,000). After the stabilization of vital signs, the patients were put asleep by 0.1 mg/kg of midazolam intravenously. They were then evaluated by the sedative, cardiovascular, respiratory and recovery effects of intravenous midazolam in epidural anesthesia. The results were as follows: The patients receiving IV midazolam averagely fell asleep in 61.6 +/- 20.5 seconds and maintained asleep for 55.4 +/- 12.7 minutes. Pain on injection was not noted in these cases. Cardiovascular parameters revealed midazolam with general depression on systolic pressure (17.4 +/- 7.3%), diastolic pressure (13.4 +/- 8.4%), mean arterial pressure (12.7 +/- 7.0%), heart rate (10.9 +/- 7.2%), stroke volume (13.7 +/- 8.9%) and cardiac output (18.4 +/- 7.0%) respectively. The peak depression reached around 10 minutes after drug administration. Respiratory parameters dropped with SaO2 (1.1 +/- 1.6%) and respiratory rate (9.7 +/- 5.7%) and fell into trough after 5 minutes of drug administration. Although all the above parameters measured were statistically significant, they were of no clinical importance that required further management. No case had delirium, anxiety and vomiting in the recovery period. Conclusively, patients receiving epidural anesthesia with supplement of intravenous midazolam provides a good sedative effect. Clinically, there was less severe untowards reaction either in cardiovascular or respiratory systems. Smooth and stable recovery was also noted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "81": "A new analgesic fenaridine which was used as a component of balanced anesthesia in 160 operations of aortocoronary bypass has been studied. It has been shown that fenaridine is a potent analgesic, exceeding fentanyl in the duration of action and in its analgetic effect. Fenaridine has a pronounced sedative effect and like other analgesics causes a dose-dependent depression of respiration. The drug has a vasodilating activity, causing both venous and arterial dilatation. This leads to a decrease in CVP by 25-30%, on the one hand, and to a drop in BP by 20%, on the other hand. Fenaridine decreases Vmax and dP/dt by 18 and 20%, respectively, with a parallel decline in HR by 13% from the baseline. A marked vasodilating effect and potentiation of the action of diazepam and other benzodiazepines in prompt injection of both drugs or when the maximum dose of fenaridine is used may lead to the onset of hypotension, and thus the drug should be used with care in critical patients with hypovolemia. The use of lower fenaridine doses (not exceeding 0.001 mg/kg) and slow injection (up to 11-13 min), as well as its combination with ketamine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg makes it possible to avoid these unfavourable adverse events and to ensure smooth induction even in critically ill patients.",

They were asked about use of benzodiazepines, history of neurological and psychiatric diseases, use of alcohol, and deficits in remembering and learning as well as age, sex and level of education. Age (over 51 years), low level of education, a history of neurological and psychiatric diseases and use of benzodiazepines showed significant associations with cognitive complaints. After a conditional logistic regression analysis, benzodiazepine use lost its association with memory complaints. These data support the hypothesis that the chronic use of benzodiazepines does not carry a risk for cognitive deficits complaints.", 
    "85": "The anticonvulsant action of midazolam and clonazepam was studied in 168 immature rats in three age groups (12, 18 and 25 days old). Epileptic after-discharges of the spike-and-wave type accompanied by clonic seizures of facial and forelimb muscles induced by stimulation of sensorimotor cortex were used as a model. The solvent used for clonazepam exhibited a tendency to anticonvulsant action in 12-day-old rats. On the contrary, a proconvulsant action was seen in 25-day-old animals. The action of both benzodiazepines was identical and did not change substantially during development. The highest dose used (1 mg kg-1, i.p.) shortened the duration of epileptic after-discharges, the two lower doses (0.1 and 0.02 mg kg-1, i.p.) suppressed the progressive prolongation with repeated stimulations seen under control conditions. Motor correlates of stimulation remained practically uninfluenced by the two benzodiazepines, myoclonic seizures accompanying epileptic after-discharges were attenuated by the highest dose of both drugs.",

Diazepam and alprazolam showed a similar anticonflict effect in D rats than in C rats. In contrast, buspirone, which was ineffective in C rats at a wide dosage range, showed a significant anticonflict effect on D rats at 0.3 mg/kg. Neither propranolol, desipramine, nor phenelzine treatment (10 mg/kg/day during 3-7 days) induced anticonflict effect in C rats. Conversely, these treatments fostered a significant and selective anxiolytic effect on D rats. Such results underscore long-lasting alterations caused by early undernutrition, namely, changes in reactivity to the drugs assayed. In addition, perinatally deprived rats may represent a useful animal model for studying potential antipanic agents.",

However, as no detailed time course of events has been determined, the present study investigated the effects of OBX on high-affinity GABAA, GABAB, beta-adrenergic, and benzodiazepine receptor binding parameters in membrane preparations from rat brain regions at weekly intervals (1-4 weeks) after OBX. Persistent significant increases (40-60%) in Bmax values of high affinity GABAA receptors were observed in the frontal cortex throughout the period investigated following OBX. Bmax values in the hippocampus increased significantly after 1 week (53%) but were not statistically significant thereafter. No changes in GABAA binding parameters were observed in the hypothalamus or cerebellum. Conversely, GABAB receptor densities were significantly decreased in the frontal cortex after 1 (-38%) and 2 (-41%) weeks and moderately decreased 3 and 4 weeks (-27 and -23%, respectively) after OBX, while in the cerebellum they were significantly increased after 1 week (96%) and returned to sham-operated levels by 3 weeks. No changes in GABAB receptor binding parameters were observed in the hippocampus or hypothalamus. Binding parameters for benzodiazepine receptor binding sites or beta-adrenoceptors were not modified throughout the time course.

    "89": "Tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of benzodiazepines limits their use in epilepsy treatment. Animal models producing tolerance have been developed, but they require repetitive injections over several days or use silastic capsules which must be made for each drug and do not provide a constant infusion rate. Alzet 2001 osmotic pumps deliver at a constant rate (1 microliter/h) and dosage can be easily adjusted. Various solvents, PEG 400, propylene glycol, 2% Tween, 50% DMSO, saline, Molecusol, and 0.5% methyl cellulose, were tried and found unsuitable because benzodiazepines were not maintained in solution or proconvulsant activity was seen. Tetraglycol was chosen as it did not demonstrate these shortcomings. Anticonvulsant activity was evaluated by PTZ i.v. tail infusion using forelimb clonus as the endpoint. This study describes a simple method for testing the development of tolerance and its reversal with flumazenil or ZK 93426. At 72 h of pump infusion with diazepam or flunitrazepam, tolerance to anticonvulsant activity was evident. Acute treatment with flumazenil or ZK 93426 reversed this tolerance. When flumazenil or ZK 93426 was given to diazepam tolerant mice, this reversal was complete. In flunitrazepam tolerant mice reversal with flumazenil was partial, but significant. When flumazenil was chronically coinfused with diazepam or flunitrazepam, anticonvulsant activity was antagonized. Similarly, when ZK 93426 was coinfused with diazepam, anticonvulsant activity was antagonized. The method described is suitable for screening putative anticonvulsant drugs for development of tolerance and the reversal of tolerance by other compounds.", 
    "90": "To clarify the role of benzodiazepine receptors in kindling, the present experiment assessed the effects of CL 218,872 (1, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg), a triazolopyridazine with a selective affinity for the putative benzodiazepine BZ1 receptor subtype, on the development and expression of amygdaloid-kindled seizures. Additionally, we assessed the effects of flumazenil (10 mg/kg), a non-specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, on kindling and the expression of kindled seizures alone or concomitantly with CL 218,872 (20 mg/kg). CL 218,872 retarded the development of kindled seizures in a linear dose-dependent manner; rats treated with 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg, but not 1 mg/kg, of CL 218,872 required a greater number of afterdischarges (ADs) to develop generalized seizures than controls. Flumazenil also retarded kindling and failed to attenuate the prophylactic effect of CL 218,872. In a cross-over procedure rats that did not develop generalized seizures after 30 ADs while under drug were rekindled under vehicle and rats kindled under vehicle were subsequently tested under drug. Rats crossed over to vehicle rekindled at a faster rate than did controls during initial kindling, suggesting that some kindling had occurred under the drug. CL 218,872 also dose-dependently depressed kindled seizures and this was attenuated by flumazenil, which had little effect on kindled seizures by itself. Together, these data suggest that CL 218,872 is a potent anticonvulsant, implicating the BZ1 receptor subtype in seizure development and in the expression of kindled seizures.", 
    "91": "The National Toxicology Program has recently determined oxazepam to be hepatocarcinogenic in mice. To aid in the assessment of the risks associated with human use of this drug, the metabolism and elimination of oxazepam in mice were exhaustively examined in B6C3F1 and Swiss-Webster mice. In this study males were given 25, 250, and 500 mg/kg by gavage, a range that includes doses found to be carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic in the National Toxicology Program bioassay. Metabolism of oxazepam by female mice of both strains was studied following administration of 500 mg/kg. More than 90% of the recovered activity was identified. Few strain differences were detected. Females of both strains metabolize oxazepam to a slightly greater extent than do males. Dose-dependent differences were detected, but they were usually nonlinear over the range examined. The routes of elimination in mice given a single dose of oxazepam were by order of importance: fecal > urinary > expired air. Pretreatment with dosed feed for 14 days (to model autoinduction in bioassay animals) resulted in a significant shift from the fecal to the urinary route of elimination, an approximately 2-fold increase in elimination of oxazepam glucuronide, and a significant decrease in excretion of unchanged oxazepam. Results of this study indicate that following constant exposure to oxazepam, mice metabolize and eliminate oxazepam in a manner more similar to that by humans than that by naive mice. This observation enhances the significance of data obtained in the bioassay and the extrapolation of that data to predict risks to human health.", 
    "92": "The chemical reaction interface for mass spectrometry (CRIMS) has been used to evaluate the ability of an \"intrinsic\" label (chlorine) to replace an \"extrinsic\" label (15N) in a study of the metabolite profile of a drug, in this case the benzodiazepine anesthetic agent midazolam. We find equally high selectivity and comparable signal/noise characteristics for chlorine as for isotopic nitrogen demonstrating that the chlorine in midazolam is itself an effective label and that special synthesis to incorporate isotopic labels is not necessary. The power of either detection mode of CRIMS is shown by detecting 14 metabolites, whereas only four had been previously determined. The ratios of 15N/Cl for each metabolite peak along with conventional mass spectra provide clues to the structures of these new metabolites.", 
    "93": "We studied the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine receptor agonists and glutamate receptor antagonists on levofloxacin (LVFX)- and ciprofloxacin (CPFX)-induced convulsions using intrathecal (i.t.) injections in mice. We also studied the effects of these agonists and antagonists on exacerbated convulsions induced by coadministration of the quinolone with 4-biphenylacetic acid (BPAA). The agonists or antagonists were injected i.t. 5 min and BPAA was administered orally 30 min before a single i.t. injection of the quinolone (10 microliters per animal). The animals were observed for clonic convulsion and death, and latency times to the appearance of convulsion were determined. Among the agonists, baclofen showed marked inhibition of both LVFX- and CPFX-induced convulsions, while other compounds such as GABA, muscimol, diazepam, and 3-aminopropylphosphonic acid had slight effects. Among the antagonists, kynurenic acid showed the strongest inhibition of convulsions caused by all doses of LVFX and CPFX and prolonged latency times; gamma-glutamyl-aminomethylsulfonic acid (GAMS) also markedly inhibited convulsions. The antagonists D-AP-5, AP-7, and 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX) had slight effects. Additionally, GAMS, DNQX, and MK-801 significantly lowered the incidence of death in the groups treated with CPFX. The enhanced convulsive activities of LVFX or CPFX by pretreatment with BPAA were clearly blocked by baclofen, kynurenic acid, GAMS, and DNQX. D-AP-5 and AP-7 also showed clear effects on the activity of LVFX. These results suggest that LVFX has fewer effects on the brains than CPFX and that convulsions induced by these quinolones alone and by these quinolones administered with BPAA may be mediated largely through glutamate and GABA(B) rather than GABA(A) receptors in mice.", 
    "94": "The importance of the cholinergic innervation of the neocortex in cognitive functions has been shown in a number of clinical and animal studies. Until recently, attempts to study the mode of action of acetylcholine in the neocortex have concentrated on muscarinic effects, whereas cholinergic actions mediated by nicotinic receptors have been difficult to demonstrate. The present work was undertaken to study the mechanism of action of nicotinic agents on cortical neurons and compare it to muscarinic effects by means of intracellular recordings in a slice preparation. The study was performed in the prelimbic area of the rat prefrontal cortex, a cortical region particularly involved in cognitive processes. Recordings were made from pyramidal cells located in layers II/III and synaptic potentials were evoked by stimulation of superficial cortical layers. Iontophoretic applications of nicotinic agonists (nicotine, dimethylphenylpiperazinium, cytisine) increased the amplitude of the monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potential mediated by non-N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors in 14% (22/159) of cells. This effect was abolished by the selective nicotinic blocker, neuronal bungarotoxin (IC50 = 0.6-0.7 microM) and by dihydro-beta-erythroidine (IC50 = 20-30 microM), whereas hexamethonium, mecamylamine, curare and alpha-bungarotoxin were ineffective. The nicotinic agonists did not change resting membrane potential, input resistance or current-voltage relationship. They also did not affect the depolarizations produced by glutamate applied by iontophoresis in the somatic or dendritic area. In contrast, the muscarinic agonists (muscarine, acetyl-beta-methylcholine) decreased the amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic potential in 100% of the neurons tested. Atropine was more effective (IC50 = 0.08 microM) than pirenzepine (IC50 = 2 microM) to antagonize the muscarinic action. These effects were observed in the absence of any direct postsynaptic change in membrane potential or input resistance, provided that the site of the iontophoretic application was more than 100 microM distant from the soma. The muscarinic agonists did not influence the actions of iontophoretically applied glutamate. These results suggest that nicotinic and muscarinic agonists modulate excitatory synaptic transmission mediated at dendritic sites by non-N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors, possibly through a presynaptic action. Thus ascending cholinergic systems may take part in information processing in the prefrontal cortex through the control of ongoing excitation to pyramidal cells.", 
    "95": "Alpidem is a new anxiolytic of imidazopyridine structure which has a high affinity for the omega 1 (BZ1) modulatory site of the GABAA receptor. The present study investigated whether tolerance and physical dependence develop after repeated treatment with alpidem, as is observed with benzodiazepines. Mice were given alpidem (100 mg/kg, p.o.) or diazepam (5 mg/kg, p.o.) twice daily for 10 consecutive days. Tolerance was assessed by measuring antagonism of pentylenetetrazole- and isoniazid-induced convulsions and bicuculline-provoked mortality, following repeated drug treatment. Decreases in the latency to isoniazid-induced convulsions and in the minimal convulsant dose of pentylenetetrazole were taken as an index of physical dependence and were evaluated at different times (3, 6, 14, 42, 67, 96 hr) after drug withdrawal or after flumazenil administration. In addition, changes in sensitivity to the convulsant effect of a beta-carboline (beta-CCM) were measured. Repeated treatment with diazepam produced tolerance to its anticonvulsant activities as indicated by shifts of the dose-response curves by a factor of 3-5. After discontinuation of diazepam treatment, spontaneous withdrawal occurred within 24 hr and lasted 67 hr as indicated by decreases in the threshold for convulsions induced by isoniazid and pentylenetetrazole. Flumazenil-induced withdrawal was observed in both isoniazid and pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsion models. Hypersensitivity of mice to the convulsant effect of beta-CCM also occurred. In contrast, repeated treatment with alpidem did not produce tolerance to its anticonvulsant effects and neither spontaneous nor flumazenil-induced withdrawal was observed in the pentylenetetrazole and isoniazid models. Moreover, withdrawal of alpidem did not induce any change in the convulsant activity of beta-CCM. These differences between alpidem and diazepam may be related to the low level of receptor occupancy during repeated treatment with alpidem because of its selectivity for omega 1 (BZ1) sites and to its moderate intrinsic activity.", 
    "96": "1. The effects of type I (BZ1) and type II (BZ2) benzodiazepine receptor ligands on monosynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) and on responses to exogenously applied GABA were studied using intracellular recordings from CA3 pyramidal cells of rat hippocampal slices taken at different postnatal stages [postnatal day 4 (P4)-P35)]. 2. The effects of midazolam, a BZ1 and BZ2 receptor agonist, were tested on the monosynaptic IPSPs at different stages. Monosynaptic, bicuculline-sensitive IPSPs were evoked by hilar stimulation in presence of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists [6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (10 microM) and D(-)2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (50 microM)]. Midazolam at 300 nM maximally increased the duration and amplitude of monosynaptic GABAA-mediated IPSPs in neurons from pups (P4-P6, n = 6) and young (P7-P12, n = 8) and adult (P25-P35, n = 9) rats. All the effects of midazolam on IPSPs were reversed by the antagonist Ro 15-1788 (10 microM). 3. The effect of midazolam was also tested on the response to exogenously applied GABA (5 mM) in the presence of tetrodotoxine [TTX (1 microM)]. In neurons from young rats (n = 9), midazolam (1 nM-1 microM) did not change the responses to exogenously applied GABA, whereas in adult rats (n = 8) midazolam maximally increased GABA currents at 30 nM. 4. The effect of zolpidem, a BZ1 receptor agonist, was tested on monosynaptic IPSPs and GABA currents at different stages. Zolpidem (10 nM-1 microM) was inactive in cells from young rats (n = 12). In neurons from adult rats, zolpidem maximally increased the duration and amplitude of the monosynaptic IPSPs at 300 nM (n = 5) and the amplitude of GABA current at 30-100 nM (n = 5). 5. Methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) (300 nM), an inverse agonist of BZ1 and BZ2 receptors, decreased the amplitude and duration of monosynaptic IPSPs in neurons from pups (n = 3) and young (n = 4) and adult (n = 5) rats. In all cases, full recovery was obtained after exposure to R0 15-1788 (10 microM). DMCM (300 nM-10 microM) failed to reduce GABA responses in cells from young (n = 3) or adult (n = 7) rats. 6. Results indicate that the regulation by benzodiazepine of GABAA-mediated IPSPs varies with the developmental stage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "97": "Data available on the relationship between salivary function and specific drug therapy are sparse. We measured unstimulated and stimulated parotid salivary flow rates associated with the drug therapies. Our ancillary study design is an N = 1 double-blind randomized controlled trial in which the patient undergoes a series of treatment blocks of either placebo or active treatment. The purpose of the parent N of 1 study was to find the \"best single drug\" treatment for a resistive patient diagnosed with dementia of the Alzheimer type. This study demonstrates that thiothixene was associated with inconsistent effects on parotid flow. Oxazepam had no effect on his parotid function, and diphenhydramine hydrochloride had inconsistent but generally negative effects. The data also show that this individual with dementia of the Alzheimer type had lower baseline unstimulated and stimulated parotid salivary flow rates when compared with mean \"normal\" values; however, flow rates were above the lowest 10th percentile of \"normal\" volunteers.", 
    "98": "We measured endogenous overflow of acetylcholine (ACh) from a vascularly perfused rat stomach in vitro with modified Krebs-Ringer solution containing 100 microM physostigmine. Evoked ACh overflow by vagal stimulation at 2.5 Hz for 2 min was abolished by tetrodotoxin (3 x 10(-7) M) or Ca++ removal and reduced by hexamethonium (10(-4) M). The evoked overflow was inhibited by oxotremorine (10(-7) to 10(-5) M), but not attenuated by 4-(N-[3-chlorophenyl]carbamoyloxy)-2-butynyltrimethylammonium chloride (10(-6) and 10(-5) M). The evoked ACh overflow was enhanced by atropine (10(-9) to 10(-6) M), 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (10(-8) to 10(-6) M), methoctramine (10(-8) to 10(-6) M) and pirenzepine (10(-8) to 10(-6) M) in a concentration-dependent manner with the following potency; atropine > 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine > methoctramine > pirenzepine. In the presence of 10(-6) M atropine, clonidine (10(-8) and 10(-7) M), but not phenylephrine (10(-7) and 10(-6) M), concentration-dependently decreased the evoked overflow of ACh at 1 Hz. Electrical stimulation of periarterial gastric sympathetic nerves (5 and 10 Hz for 2 min) frequency-dependently inhibited the evoked ACh overflow at 1 Hz in the presence of atropine and sympathetic inhibition mediated at 5 Hz was abolished by 10(-6) M rauwolscine, but not by 10(-6) M prazosin. These results indicate that the ACh release from gastric parasympathetic neurons is inhibited by M3 muscarinic autoreceptors and alpha-2 adrenoceptors.", 
    "99": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected CEM cells were treated by the HIV-1-specific inhibitors bis-heteroarylpiperazine (BHAP), 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-5-methylimidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]benzodiazepin-2(1 H)-on e (TIBO) R82913, nevirapine, and the N3-methylthymine derivative of [2',5'-bis-O-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-beta-D-ribofuranosyl]-3'-spiro- 5''-(4''-amino-1'',2''-oxathiole-2'',2''-dioxide) (TSAO-m3T), as single agents or in combination, at escalating concentrations. When used individually, the compounds led to the emergence of drug-resistant virus strains within two to five subcultivations. The resulting strains were designated HIV-1/BHAP, HIV-1/TIBO, HIV-1/Nev, and HIV-1/TSAO-m3T, respectively. The mutant viruses showed the following amino acid substitutions in their reverse transcriptase (RT): Leu-100-->Ile for HIV-1/BHAP; Lys-103-->Asn for HIV-1/TIBO; Val-106-->Ala for HIV-1/Nev; and Glu-138-->Lys for HIV-1/TSAO-m3T. Both the Tyr-181-->Cys and Val-106-->Ala mutations were found in another mutant emerging following treatment with nevirapine at escalating concentrations. The BHAP-resistant virus remained fully sensitive to the inhibitory effects of nevirapine and TSAO-m3T, whereas the TSAO-m3T-resistant virus remained fully sensitive to the inhibitory effects of nevirapine and BHAP. When different pairs of nonnucleoside RT inhibitors (i.e., BHAP plus TSAO-m3T, nevirapine plus TSAO-m3T, TIBO plus TSAO-m3T, nevirapine plus TIBO, and BHAP plus nevirapine) were used, resistant virus emerged as fast as with single-drug therapy. In all cases the Tyr-181-->Cys mutation appeared; the virus showed markedly reduced sensitivity to all HIV-1-specific inhibitors but retained sensitivity to 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside analogs such as zidovudine, ddC, and ddI. Our findings argue against simultaneous combination of two different nonnucleoside RT inhibitors that are unable to inhibit HIV-1 mutant strains containing the Tyr-181-->Cys mutation when administered as single drugs.",

Here Michael Rogawski reviews recent progress in the development of therapeutically useful NMDA receptor channel blockers and a new class of selective AMPA/kainate receptor antagonists, the 2,3-benzodiazepines. Research on these novel noncompetitive excitatory amino acid antagonists has opened promising new avenues for the development of drugs to treat epilepsy, ischaemia, neurodegeneration and Parkinson's disease."
