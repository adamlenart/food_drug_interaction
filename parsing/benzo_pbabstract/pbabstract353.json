    "0": "We examined the effect of Waglerin-1, a peptide of 22 amino acid residues purified from the venom of Wagler's pit viper (Trimeresurus wagleri), on the whole cell current response (I(GABA)) of freshly isolated murine hypothalamic neurons to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Although the application of 32 microM Waglerin-1 alone had no effect on membrane conductance, coapplication with GABA increased I(GABA) for 78 and suppressed I(GABA) for 44 of the 141 neurons examined. The potentiating effect of Waglerin-1 was associated with a leftward shift of the concentration-response relation of GABA without increasing peak I(GABA). This potentiating effect of Waglerin-1 on I(GABA) mimics diazepam. Furthermore, the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil antagonized Waglerin-1 potentiation of I(GABA), These observations suggest that Waglerin-1 acts on the benzodiazepine site of one type of GABA(A) receptor/channel complex to increase its affinity for agonist. In contrast, the depressant effect of Waglerin-1 was associated with a rightward shift of the concentration-response relation of GABA without depressing the maximal I(GABA); this suggests a competitive inhibition of a second class of GABAR. The ability of Waglerin-1 to suppress I(GABA) showed a positive correlation with a similar action of Zn++. As with Zn++, the depressant effect of Waglerin-1 on I(GABA) was more pronounced at negative holding potentials. These observations are discussed in terms of variation in the subunit composition of GABA receptors that murine central nervous system neurons express.", 
    "1": "Pharmacologic management of alcoholism is only one part of the management of both alcohol dependence and withdrawal, which also includes the provision of a calm, quiet environment; reassurance; ongoing reassessment; attention to fluid and electrolyte disorders; treatment of coexisting addictions and common medical, surgical, and psychiatric comorbidities; and referral for ongoing psychosocial and medical treatment. For further discussion of these topics, the reader is referred to previously published sources. A survey of alcoholism treatment programs revealed that although benzodiazepines were the most commonly used drugs, standardized monitoring of patients' withdrawal severity was not common practice, and a significant minority of clinicians were using a variety of other drugs, some not known to prevent or treat the complications of withdrawal. Treatment should be based on the available evidence (Working Group on Pharmacological Management of Alcohol Withdrawal: American Society of Addiction Medicine Committee on Practice Guidelines: Pharmacological management of alcohol withdrawal: An evidence-based practice guideline. Unpublished draft, 1997). Patients with significant symptoms, patients with complications such as seizures or delirium tremens, and patients at higher risk for complications of alcohol withdrawal should receive benzodiazepines, particularly chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, or lorazepam, because of their safety and documented efficacy in preventing and treating the most serious complications of alcohol withdrawal. These drugs may be dosed on a fixed schedule for a predetermined number of doses on a tapering schedule over several days, or they may be administered by front-loading. An alternative approach for selected patients without seizures or acute comorbidity is symptom-triggered therapy, which individualizes treatment and decreases the duration and dose of medication administration. With either of the regimens, patients should have their withdrawal severity monitored until symptoms are resolving. Once withdrawal from alcohol is safely completed, the focus should turn to helping to prevent relapse. Disulfiram may be useful in highly motivated subsets of patients and when compliance-enhancing strategies are used. Naltrexone is useful in the broader population of patients entering treatment for alcohol dependence. These pharmacologic interventions should be given in the context of ongoing psychosocial support. There is substantial evidence that pharmacologic management of alcohol abuse and dependence is effective. As would be predicted from alcohol's myriad cellular effects, no panacea exists for alcoholism. For alcohol withdrawal, however, although treatment regimens have only recently been refined, evidence for effective treatment of symptoms and prevention of complications with benzodiazepines has been available for decades. Within the last decade, effective treatments, including naltrexone, have been shown to reduce alcohol intake in alcohol-dependent persons. Given the prevalence and cost of alcohol-related problems, all effective therapies (including pharmacologic treatments) should be considered to treat alcohol abuse and dependence.", 
    "2": "We report a case of a 57-yr-old woman with a complaint of dysphagia of 2-wk duration. She had rheumatoid arthritis and had been taking 10 mg of prednisone and 2 mg of lorazepam daily for 2 yr. Radiologic examination showed partial retention of barium sulfate in the pharynx, which was confirmed by scintigraphic examination of the oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing. This retention was about 47% of the volume swallowed. The benzodiazepine was withdrawn, and 2 wk later she had no symptoms. We repeated the scintigraphic study, and it showed no retention. We conclude that chronic ingestion of benzodiazepine may cause dysphagia.", 
    "3": "Rapid tranquilization is a routinely practiced method of calming agitated psychotic patients by use of neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, or both in combination. Although several studies have examined the efficacy of the three approaches, none have compared these treatments in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial. Ninety-eight psychotic, agitated, and aggressive patients (73 men and 25 women) were prospectively enrolled during an 18-month period in emergency departments in five university or general hospitals. Patients were randomly assigned to receive intramuscular injections of lorazepam (2 mg), haloperidol (5 mg), or both in combination. Patients in each treatment group received 1 to 6 injections of the same study drug within 12 hours, based on clinical need. They were evaluated hourly after the first injection until at least 12 hours after the last. Efficacy was assessed on the Agitated Behavior Scale (ABS), a modified Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (MBPRS), Clinical Global impressions (CGI) scale, and an Alertness Scale. Effective symptom reduction was achieved in each treatment group with significant (P < .01) mean decreases from baseline at every hourly ABS evaluation. Significant (P < .05) mean differences on the ABS (hour 1) and MBPRS (hours 2 and 3) suggest that tranquilization was most rapid in patients receiving the combination treatment. Study event incidence (side effects) did not differ significantly between treatment groups, although patients receiving haloperidol alone tended to have more extrapyramidal system symptoms. The superior results produced by the combination treatment support the use of lorazepam plus haloperidol as the treatment of choice for acute psychotic agitation.",

    "6": "A secondary analysis was conducted using data from a controlled clinical trial that took place in three nursing homes: a control home, one that received an educational intervention, and one that received an educational/consultation intervention. All three homes were influenced by the OBRA mandates. Complete pre- and 6 months' post-intervention data on use of psychoactive drugs and physical restraints were available for 446 resident subjects. Changes were first analyzed with the resident subjects as the unit of analysis and then using the nursing home ward (n = 16) as the unit of analysis.", 
    "7": "While physical restraint use declined in the home that received the educational/consultation intervention, neither neuroleptic nor benzodiazepine use increased in any of the homes after the interventions. The percentage of residents taking neuroleptics declined in the control home (18.6% to 11.3%, P = .014). Benzodiazepine use, which was more prevalent than described previously in the literature, declined in all three homes (P < .001). Of those residents whose physical restraints were discontinued, only 2% were started on neuroleptics. When the effect of OBRA mandates on appropriateness of neuroleptic use was examined, the percentage of residents on neuroleptics who lacked an OBRA-approved indication declined from 21.3% to 14.6% in the total sample, and from 39.9% to 8% in the control home.", 
    "8": "Interventions to reduce physical restraint did not lead to an increase in psychoactive drug use; further, reduction in both can occur simultaneously. OBRA mandates regarding psychoactive drug use were not uniformly effective, but appear, at minimum, to have increased awareness of the indications for neuroleptics.", 
    "9": "This study in rats was performed to explore whether the inhibitory effect of midazolam on the development of acute tolerance to the analgesic effect of alfentanil is due to pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Analgesia was determined with tail-compression and hot-plate tests. Alfentanil and midazolam concentrations in plasma and the brain were measured using a radioimmunoassay and chromatographic technique, respectively. After the 4-h period of alfentanil administration (155 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1) after a 50-microg/kg bolus), when acute tolerance had already developed, midazolam (2-mg/kg bolus) enhanced the alfentanil-induced analgesia by 120% (P < 0.001) with the tail-compression test and 76% (P < 0.01) with the hot-plate test. At the height of midazolam-induced enhancement of the analgesic effect of alfentanil, the measurements of the alfentanil and midazolam plasma and brain concentrations did not demonstrate any significant changes in the drugs' concentrations. The results confirm that midazolam attenuates the development of acute tolerance to the analgesic effect of alfentanil and indicate that this interaction is not pharmacokinetic.", 
    "10": "The effects of midazolam on the peripheral embryonic nicotinergic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) of mouse myotubes were studied to elucidate the mechanism of its effect on neuromuscular transmission. Standard patch clamp techniques on outside-out patches were used. Pulses of 10(-4) M acetylcholine (ACh) applied by a liquid filament switch technique elicited macroscopic channel currents with a peak current amplitude of approximately 40 pA within <1 ms. The current decayed with a time constant of 30-100 ms due to desensitization. When midazolam was added in stepwise increased concentrations (10(-7) M to 7 x 10(-4) M) to the pulses, the current decay became bi-exponential, and a concentration-dependent decrease of the fast component of decay was observed. The current amplitude, however, was reduced slightly, and only at high concentrations of midazolam. This may indicate that midazolam binds to the open channel to cause the block. The rate constant of block (b(+1)) was found to be 1.8 x 10(6) M/s. Recovery experiments revealed a rate of unblocking (b(-1)) of approximately 2 x 10(-1) s(-1). After preincubation of the patches with midazolam, a substantial reduction of the current amplitude was seen at very low midazolam concentrations (<10(-7) M), which suggests an additional closed channel block with a Kd of approximately 10(-6) M. This closed channel block may be responsible for the muscle-relaxing effects of midazolam.", 
    "11": "Midazolam has GABAergic effects in children that may modify propofol-induced involuntary movements, yet delay recovery. In a double-blind, randomized study, 24 children (2-7 yr of age, ASA physical status I or II) undergoing short surgical procedures received midazolam 0.5 mg/kg (Group M) or placebo (Group P) per os 20-30 min before propofol anesthesia (5 mg/kg intravenously followed by an infusion). Blind observers scored sedation and anxiety levels (scale 1-4) before premedication, at separation from parents, and at induction of anesthesia. Induction and emergence were videotaped, and body movements were recorded. During recovery, times to eye opening and maximum Steward (SS = 6) and Vancouver Sedative Recovery (VSRS = 22) scores were noted. Parents were questioned about side effects that may have occurred during the following week. Both groups were similar in age, sex, weight, timing of premedication, propofol dose, and duration of surgery. The incidence of involuntary movements did not differ between groups but was higher at induction (79%) than on emergence (25%) (P < 0.05). Anxiety and sedation scores were similar in Group P and Group M, but recovery took longer after midazolam, with eye opening (mean +/- SD) 24 +/- 7 vs 43 +/- 18 min, maximum SS (median and range) 27 (13-37) vs 55 (24-138) min, and maximum VSRS 51 (30-100) vs 80 (50-130) min. Children returned to normal activity in 1 (0-5) day, and none exhibited neurological complications. We conclude that an oral premedicant dose of midazolam prolongs recovery from anesthesia in children without affecting dystonic movements after propofol.", 
    "12": "The effects of midazolam (MID) on the in vitro growth and differentiation of two murine myeloid leukemia WEHI 3B (JCS) and M1 cells were studied. MID inhibits the proliferation of both M1 and JCS cells in a dose-dependent manner. At the concentration of 10 micrograms/ml, MID was found to induce both monocytic and granulocytic differentiation of the JCS but not M1 cells. Induction of morphological differentiation of the JCS cells was also associated with the enhanced expression of the differentiation antigens Mac-1, F4/80, and Gr-1 for the cells. Results from mRNA phenotyping experiments also indicated that the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and neutrophil-specific J11d differentiation marker was significantly upregulated in MID-treated JCS cells. In addition, the phagocytic activity of MID-treated JCS cells was increased towards opsonized yeast cells. Results from this investigation suggested that MID may be used as an inducer for further study on the mechanisms of differentiation in these myeloid leukemia cells.", 
    "13": "Naive adult male Wistar rats free to choose between water or 10% ethanol (v/v) spontaneously became water-preferring (WP) rats, as they drank mainly water (approximately 35 ml per day), or alcohol-drinking (ED) rats, as they also drank a significant amount of ethanol (approximately 14 ml per day). The selective CCKA receptor antagonist L-364,718 at doses selective for the CCKA receptor (5 micrograms/kg, IP) halved the consumption of alcohol of the ED rats without modifying their total liquid in-take. In contrast, the CCKB antagonists L-365,260 or GV150013 were without effect when used at doses selective for the CCKB receptor. These data indicate that the CCK system could be involved in the modulation of alcohol intake. In particular, they suggest that CCKA receptors could play a role in the ethanol preference.",

    "22": "The previously common occurrence of catatonic schizophrenia and catatonic symptoms among schizophrenic patients has diminished sharply; catatonic symptoms now occur more frequently in association with severe affective disorders or with general medical conditions. Catatonia is generally viewed as a peculiar and puzzling syndrome and attracts limited attention. Yet significant catatonic symptoms tend to be present in close to 10% of patients admitted to psychiatric inpatient facilities. The dynamic significance of catatonia can be recognized by considering the original biologic role of catatonia in schizophrenia as an opposite to the paranoid disorder. Szondi viewed catatonia as an attempt at self-healing of the paranoid psychosis with its threatening total expansion, by extreme constriction of the ego. The previously predominant primary association of catatonia with schizophrenia has been eclipsed as neuroleptics have supplanted the endogenous self-healing attempt of catatonia, preventing the occurrence of catatonic symptoms in schizophrenia. Neuroleptics in fact duplicate or approximate the symptoms of catatonia by producing mental immobilization, hypokinesis (parkinsonism and dystonia), hyperkinesis (akathisia), and pernicious catatonia in the modern guise of the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Patients with past or present catatonic symptoms are particularly vulnerable to NMS, and treatment of catatonia requires avoidance of neuroleptics and the use of benzodiazepines or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The extreme negativism and constriction of consciousness in catatonia suggest a primary role of the frontal lobes, with secondary involvement of the extrapyramidal system and its movement disorders. In an attempt to integrate clinical, psychologic, neuropharmacologic, and neurochemical findings, a modern dynamic neuropsychiatry must appreciate the major significance of catatonia.", 
    "23": "In radioligand binding studies, BIMG 80, a new putative antipsychotic, displayed good affinity at certain serotonin (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT6), dopamine (D1, D2L, D4), and noradrenergic (alpha1) receptors. The effect of acute subcutaneous BIMG 80, clozapine, haloperidol, risperidone, amperozide, olanzapine, and Seroquel was then investigated on dopamine release in medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and striatum in freely moving rats using the microdialysis technique. Four different neurochemical profiles resulted from the studies: (a) Systemic administration of BIMG 80, clozapine, and amperozide produced greater percent increases in dopamine efflux in medial prefrontal cortex than in the striatum or the nucleus accumbens. (b) Haloperidol induced a similar increase in dopamine concentrations in the striatum and nucleus accumbens with no effect in the medial prefrontal cortex. (c) Risperidone and olanzapine stimulated dopamine release to a similar extent in all brain regions investigated. (d) Seroquel failed to change significantly dopamine output both in the medial prefrontal cortex and in the striatum. Because an increase in dopamine release in the medial prefrontal cortex may be predictive of effectiveness in treating negative symptoms and in the striatum may be predictive of induction of extrapyramidal side effects, BIMG 80 appears to be a potential antipsychotic compound active on negative symptoms of schizophrenia with a low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects.", 
    "24": "Long-term treatment with diazepam, a full allosteric modulator of the GABA(A) receptor, results in tolerance to its anticonvulsant effects, whereas an equipotent treatment with the partial allosteric modulator imidazenil does not produce tolerance. Use of subunit-specific antibodies linked to gold particles allowed an immunocytochemical estimation of the expression density of the alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, alpha5, gamma(2L&S) and beta(2/3) subunits of the GABA(A) receptor in the frontoparietal motor and frontoparietal somatosensory cortices of rats that received long-term treatment with vehicle, diazepam (three times daily for 14 days, doses increasing from 17.6 to 70.4 micromol/kg), or imidazenil (three times daily for 14 days, doses increasing from 2.5 to 10.0 micromol/kg). In this study, tolerance to diazepam was associated with a selective decrease (37%) in the expression of the alpha1 subunit in layers III-IV of the frontoparietal motor cortex, and a concomitant increase in the expression of the alpha5 (150%), gamma(2L&S) and beta(2/3) subunits (48%); an increase in alpha5 subunits was measured in all cortical layers. In the frontoparietal somatosensory cortex, diazepam-tolerant rats had a 221% increase in the expression of alpha5 subunits in all cortical layers, as well as a 35% increase in the expression of alpha3 subunits restricted to layers V-VI. Western blot analysis substantiated that these diazepam-induced changes reflected the expression of full subunit molecules. Rats that received equipotent treatment with imidazenil did not become tolerant to its anticonvulsant properties, and did not show significant changes in the expression of any of the GABA(A) receptor subunits studied, with the exception of a small decrease in alpha2 subunits in cortical layers V-VI of the frontoparietal somatosensory cortex. The results of this study suggest that tolerance to benzodiazepines may be associated with select changes in subunit abundance, leading to the expression of different GABA(A) receptor subtypes in specific brain areas. These changes might be mediated by a unique homeostatic mechanism regulating the expression of GABA(A) receptor subtypes that maintain specific functional features of GABAergic function in cortical cell layers.", 
    "25": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has neuromodulatory actions on multiple brain functions including endocrine, behavioral, and circadian processes. Behavioral studies suggest that NPY is a potent anxiolytic; however, little is known about how NPY affects general arousal and/or attention states. The present study evaluated the effects of NPY on spontaneous brain activity as well as auditory processing by using electrophysiological measures. Electroencephalographic (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) were obtained in awake animals after intracerebroventricular administration of NPY (1.0, 3.0 nmol) and two of its analogs, active at Y1 (1.0, 3.0 nmol) and Y2 (1.0, 3.0 nmol) receptor sites. NPY was found to produce dose-related effects on electrophysiological measures. Spectral analyses of the EEG revealed that NPY produced slowing of delta activity (1-2 Hz) in the frontal cortex and high frequency theta activities (6-8 Hz) concomitant with a speeding up of low frequency theta (4-6 Hz) in cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. At higher doses (3.0 nmols) in addition to shifts in frequency, EEG power was also significantly reduced in all frequencies (0.5-50 Hz) in cortex, and in the higher frequencies (8-32 Hz) in the amygdala. The Y1 and Y2 agonists had a somewhat different profile of EEG effects than the parent compound. At the 1 nmol dose both agonists were found to produce selective depressions in power in the hippocampus. The 3.0 nmols dose of the Y1 agonist produced decreases in EEG stability, an effect commonly produced by anxiolytic drugs, whereas the Y2 agonist produced increases in EEG stability in cortex and amygdala. Auditory processing, as assessed by ERPs, was affected most significantly in the frontal cortex where dose-dependent decreases in the N1 component of the ERP, a finding also commonly seen after anxiolytics, was found. Y1 and Y2 agonists were also found to significantly reduce the amplitude of the N1 component of the ERP but less so than the parent compound. The electrophysiological and behavioral profiles of NPY and the Y1 agonist resembles those of anxiolytics such as ethanol and benzodiazepines. Taken together these data suggest that electrophysiological measures of the actions of this peptide system may represent a new potentially useful assay for the development of anxiolytic drugs.", 
    "26": "Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were used to investigate the properties of GABAA receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents during development in dentate gyrus granule cells from neonatal [postnatal day 0 (P0)] to adult rats in brain slices. The frequency of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) was low at birth and increased progressively with age. The mIPSCs of all ages could be satisfactorily fitted with the sum of a single exponential rise and single exponential decay. From P0 to P14, both the rise time and the decay time constants were significantly longer than in the adult. The mIPSC rise and decay kinetics did not change during the first 2 postnatal weeks, but during the third week the kinetics sped up and by P21 attained adult values. In contrast, the amplitude of the mIPSCs did not change during development. The synaptic GABAA receptors in immature and adult cells showed differential sensitivity to modulators. The subunit-specific benzodiazepine agonist zolpidem increased the decay time constant of the IPSCs of immature granule cells with a reduced potency compared with the adult. Furthermore, zinc decreased the amplitude and decay time constant of mIPSCs from developing granule cells, whereas it had no effect on mIPSCs in adult neurons. The results reveal for the first time that until the end of the second postnatal week the synaptic GABAA receptor-mediated currents in dentate granule cells display slower rise and decay kinetics but similar amplitudes compared with adult, resulting in a net decrease in synaptic charge transfer during development.", 
    "27": "Hyperekplexia is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a point mutation in the alpha1 subunit of the glycine receptor, characterized by excessive startle responses followed by temporary generalized stiffness. Clonazepam, effective in open case studies, potentiates, through unknown mechanisms, the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Vigabatrin increases GABA by inhibition of the GABA catabolic enzyme GABA-transaminase. Effects of clonazepam (1 mg for 1 day) and vigabatrin (1000 mg per day for 5 days) were investigated in a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study in 4 patients with hyperekplexia. The pharmacodynamic parameters were startle reflexes, studied 3 times during the day. At each time, 2 trains of 10 auditive stimuli (113 dB) were given at intervals of 10 and 60 s. Startle movements were quantified with summed areas of EMG-bursts of the orbicularis oculi, sternocleidomastoid, biceps and thenar muscles. The degrees of stiffness and drowsiness were quantified with visual analogue scores (VAS) 10 times during the day, by both the patient and the observer. Clonazepam, but not vigabatrin, reduced startle activity significantly in both paradigms. The degree of stiffness and drowsiness was not significantly influenced by either drug.",

    "31": "The present study was designed to investigate whether heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor and its related peptides are expressed in response to gastrin in rat stomach. Rat gastrin-17I (2.5 nmol/kg/hour) or gastrin-17I plus gastrin receptor antagonist, L-740,093 (2.0 mg/kg/hour), was injected intravenously into male Sprague-Dawley rats. RNA was extracted from oxyntic mucosa, and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor and related peptide gene expression was estimated using a ribonuclease protection assay. The level of transforming growth factor-alpha mRNA did not change at any time point during the experiment. In contrast, the levels of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor and amphiregulin mRNA were significantly increased within 3 hours following gastrin infusion and reached maximum levels 6 and 12 hours later, respectively. Continuous infusion of gastrin significantly increased oxyntic mucosal proliferation. Gastrin receptor antagonist significantly inhibited gastrin-induced heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor and amphiregulin gene expression and gastrin-induced oxyntic mucosal proliferation. These findings indicate that heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor and amphiregulin genes are induced by gastrin and that they play a role in the trophic action of gastrin on oxyntic mucosa.", 
    "32": "Recombinant human GABA(A) receptors were investigated in vitro by coexpression of cDNAs coding for alpha1, beta2, and gamma2 subunits in the baculovirus/Sf-9 insect cell system. We report that a single amino acid exchange (isoleucine 121 to valine 121) in the N-terminal, extracellular part of the alpha1 subunit induces a marked decrease in agonist GABA(A) receptor ligand sensitivity. The potency of muscimol and GABA to inhibit the binding of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist [3H]SR 95531 (2-(3-carboxypropyl)-3-amino-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)pyridazinium bromide) was higher in receptor complexes of alpha1(ile 121) beta2gamma2 than in those of alpha1(val 121) beta2gamma2 (IC50 values were 32-fold and 26-fold lower for muscimol and GABA, respectively). The apparent affinity of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide to inhibit the binding of [3H]SR 95531 did not differ between the two receptor complex variants. Electrophysiological measurements of GABA induced whole-cell Cl- currents showed a ten-fold decrease in the GABA(A) receptor sensitivity of alpha1 (val 121) beta2gamma2 as compared to alpha1(ile 121) beta2gamma2 receptor complexes. Thus, a relatively small change in the primary structure of the alpha1 subunit leads to a decrease selective for GABA(A) receptor sensitivity to agonist ligands, since no changes were observed in a GABA(A) receptor antagonist affinity and benzodiazepine receptor binding.", 
    "33": "The thiocarboxanilide nonnucleoside inhibitor (NNI) UC781 inhibited HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) DNA polymerase activity at a 1:1 molar ratio of inhibitor to enzyme. Inhibition was linear uncompetitive with respect to template/primer (T/P) and mixed noncompetitive with respect to deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), typical of NNI. When the RT-T/P binary complex was incubated with UC781 and then separated from unbound inhibitor, recovery of enzyme activity was slow, with only about 60% activity recovered after 25 min. The inactivation of the RT-T/P complex was prevented by the presence of a large excess of UC84, another carboxanilide NNI that interacts with this RT mechanistic form. UC781 protected the RT-T/P-dNTP ternary complex from irreversible inactivation by a photoactivatable azido analog of nevirapine, implying that UC781 binds to the NNI pocket of this RT mechanistic form. UC781 did not photoprotect either the free enzyme or the RT-T/P binary complex; however, protein fluorescence quenching studies indicated that UC781 interacted with all RT mechanistic forms, with the order of affinity being RT-T/P-dNTP ternary complex > RT-T/P binary complex > free RT. Reaction progress curve analysis showed that the binding of UC781 to RT is rapid (k(on) approximately 1.7 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1)), but that dissociation is slow (k(off) approximately 1.6 x 10(-3) s(-1)). UC781 is therefore a rapid tight-binding inhibitor of HIV-1 RT, the first NNI to demonstrate this property.", 
    "34": "In cerebellar granule neurons of neonatal rats micromolar concentrations of 7-chloro-3-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,2, 4-benzothiadiazine S,S-dioxide (IDRA-21) and cyclothiazide, two negative modulators of the spontaneous agonist-dependent rapid desensitization of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-gated ion channels, facilitate AMPA receptor function by increasing the content of free cytosolic Ca2+ as measured by single-cell fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2) Ca2+-dependent fluorescence and intracellular Na+ measured with the sodium-binding bezofuran isophthalate acetoxymethyl ester fluorescence indicator. IDRA-21 increases intracellular Na+ transient with a threshold (5 microM) that is approximately 10 times higher and has an intrinsic activity significantly lower than that of cyclothiazide. By virtue of its low intrinsic activity, IDRA-21 elicits a free cytosolic Ca2+ transient increase that is shorter lasting than that elicited by cyclothiazide even when the drug is left in contact with cultured granule cells for several minutes. Additionally, while dose dependently, 5-25 microM cyclothiazide in the presence of AMPA is highly neurotoxic, IDRA-21 (up to 100 microM) is devoid of neurotoxicity. The neurotoxicity elicited by cyclothiazide persists in the presence of dizocilpine (an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate-selective glutamate receptors) but is blocked by 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitrosulfamoylbenzo[f]quinoxaline (a competitive AMPA receptor antagonist) and the 1-(aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7, 8-methylendioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466; a noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist). Since the doses of IDRA-21 that enhance cognitive processes in rats and monkeys are several orders of magnitude lower than those required to elicit marginal neurotoxicity in cultured neurons, it can be surmised that IDRA-21 is a potent cognition-enhancing drug virtually devoid of neurotoxic liability because it acts as a partial negative allosteric modulator of AMPA receptor desensitization.", 
    "35": "Our previous studies have shown that a benzodiazepine potentiates opioid actions on spinal cord by blocking a hyperresponsiveness that may be related to the development of opioid tolerance and withdrawal. The present study was designed to test whether propofol, which like benzodiazepines acts on GABA(A) receptors, displays similar interactions with opioids. Spinal cords isolated from 1-7 day old rats were arranged to record the slow ventral root potential (sVRP) elicited by stimulating a lumbar dorsal root. A concentration of propofol which by itself did not depress sVRP significantly enhanced the apparent potency of alfentanil and blocked the increase in sVRP observed when alfentanil is followed by naloxone. The results suggest that enhancement of GABA inhibition may increase opioid potency by inhibiting the development of acute tolerance.", 
    "36": "This is a longitudinal investigation of the psychophysiological mechanism for the development of delirium in coronary care units (CCUs). Ten patients satisfying DSM-III-R diagnostic criteria for delirium (group D) and 10 controls (group C) were drawn from patients admitted to CCU. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye movement recordings were observed over the days that patients were admitted to CCU and on a control day of admission and compared for each group and between each day. In the D group, slowing of background EEG activity, particularly on day 2, and many R (rapid) group eye movements and RS type (rapid superimposed on slow) eye movements, particularly on day 3, were observed. That is, from days 2 to 3, EEG findings showed an improvement in consciousness, and eye movement recordings manifested signs of anxiety and tension. These psychophysiological findings can be used to explain the transition from prodromal delirium to obvious delirium, and are supported by clinical features.", 
    "37": "The neocortex is thought to exert a powerful influence over the functions of the basal ganglia via its projection to the striatum. It is not known, however, whether corticostriatal effects are similar across different types of striatal projection neurons and interneurons or are unique for cells having different functions within striatal networks. To examine this question, we developed a method for focal synchronous activation of the primary motor cortex (MI) of freely moving rats by local release of GABAergic inhibition. With this method, we monitored cortically evoked activation of two immediate-early gene protein products, c-Fos and JunB, in phenotypically identified striatal neurons. We further studied the influence of glutamate receptor antagonists on the stimulated expression of c-Fos, JunB, FosB, and NGFI-A. Local disinhibition of MI elicited remarkably selective induction of c-Fos and JunB in enkephalinergic projection neurons. These indirect pathway neurons, through their projections to the globus pallidus, can inhibit thalamocortical motor circuits. The dynorphin-containing projection neurons of the direct pathway, with opposite effects on the thalamocortical circuits, showed very little induction of c-Fos or JunB. The gene response of striatal interneurons was also highly selective, affecting principally parvalbumin- and NADPH diaphorase-expressing interneurons. The glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 strongly reduced the cortically evoked striatal gene expression in all cell types for each gene examined. Because the gene induction that we found followed known corticostriatal somatotopy, was dose-dependent, and was selectively sensitive to glutamate receptor antagonists, we suggest that the differential activation patterns reflect functional specialization of cortical inputs to the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia and functional plasticity within these circuits.", 
    "38": "A novel subunit of the gamma-aminobutyrate, type A (GABAA) receptor family has been identified in human and rat tissues. The subunit displays 30-40% amino acid identity with known family members and represents a distinct subunit class (termed pi). Transcripts of the pi subunit were detected in several human tissues and were particularly abundant in the uterus. The pi subunit protein can assemble with known GABAA receptor subunits and confer unique ligand binding properties to the recombinant receptors in which it combines. Most notably, the presence of the pi subunit alters the sensitivity of recombinant receptors to the endogenous steroid, pregnanolone. Identification of the pi subunit indicates a new target for pharmacological manipulation of GABAA receptors that are located outside of the central nervous system.", 
    "39": "It is demonstrated that the acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) enzyme activity in rough endoplasmatic reticulum membranes is regulated by the acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP). The ACAT activity is strongly inhibited by different ACBP/oleoyl-CoA complexes depending from the molar ratio of protein and fatty acid-CoA. Other lipid binding proteins such as bovine serum albumin and the liver fatty acid binding protein do not show any effects on ACAT activity. In addition, we can show that cholesterol loading with acetylated low density lipoproteins does not lead to an increase of the ACBP mRNA level. Consequently, the increase of the intracellular concentration of fatty acids because of the cholesteryl ester accumulation renders ACAT more active for cholesterol esterification. In binding studies we have characterized binding sites on microsomal membranes for the ACAT substrate oleoyl-CoA and the ACAT inhibitor diazepam. Diazepam competes with oleoyl-CoA and vice versa for its binding to microsomal membranes. This common binding site is suggested to be responsible for the transfer from ACBP-bound oleoyl-CoA to ACAT and, therefore, to be essential for the microsomal cholesterol esterification.", 
    "40": "This is a long-term follow-up of occurrence of epilepsy, neurological, motor, intellectual, cognitive, and scholastic achievements in a cohort of children with febrile convulsions (n = 289), randomized in early childhood to either intermittent prophylaxis (diazepam at fever) or no prophylaxis (diazepam at seizures). At follow-up the two groups were of almost identical age (14.0 vs. 14.1 years), body weight (58.2 vs. 57.2 kg), height (168.2 vs. 167.7 cm) and head circumference (55.9 vs. 56.2 cm). The neurological examination, fine and gross motor development on Stott motor test, intellectual performance on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children verbal IQ (105 vs. 105), performance IQ (114 vs. 111) and full scale IQ (110 vs. 108). cognitive abilities on an neuropsychological test battery, including short and long term, auditory and visual memory, visuomotor tempo, computer reaction time, reading test, scholastic achievements and the occurrence of subsequent epilepsy were also very similar. Children with simple and complex febrile convulsions had the same benign outcome. The long term prognosis in terms of subsequent epilepsy, neurological, motor, intellectual, cognitive, and scholastic ability was not influenced by the type of treatment applied in early childhood. Preventing new febrile convulsions appears no better in the long run than abbreviating them.", 
    "41": "A series of surveys were undertaken at one Australian medical school to examine alcohol and drug-related knowledge, skills and attitudes before and after the introduction of the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse and also before and after major alcohol and drug medical education initiatives. The surveys were conducted with 5th year medical students at the University of Sydney in 1986, 1990 and 1993 (total n = 379). Response rates of approximately 70% were achieved in each of the survey years. The three cohorts of students were similar demographically with the exception that significantly more males in 1990 and 1993 reported that English was not their first language. Very low prevalence levels for smoking were reported. By 1993, only 3% of 5th year medical students reported that they smoked. There was a significant decrease in the frequency of drinking occasions for males and females between 1986 and 1990. There was also a four-fold increase in both male and female abstainers. There was no significant difference in the amount of alcohol consumed on any drinking occasion, although there was a trend in that direction. There was a significant increase in alcohol and drug-related knowledge in the 1990 and 1993 groups, compared to the 1986 group. Skill levels were not found to change significantly across the three year groups. Students' ability to recognize NHMRC hazardous consumption levels increased substantially between 1986 and 1990. Only 4% of 1986 students considered <30 of alcohol a day to be hazardous for females compared to 47% in 1990. For men, only 8% of students considered 31-60 hazardous drinking in 1986 compared to 55% in 1990 and 61% in 1993. More recently trained students tended to express slightly more tolerant and accepting views about patients with alcohol and benzodiazepine dependence and had greater confidence in success of interventions. The present studies indicate important progress and achievements have been made. The paper discusses the further work needed to ensure that newly graduating medical practitioners are adequately equipped to deal effectively with alcohol and drug-related problems.", 
    "42": "Critical issues are addressed concerning when to use nelfinavir, a newly approved protease inhibitor. Because of a resistance mutation that occurs as a result of taking nelfinavir, the following questions arise: if resistance emerges in a patient naive to protease inhibitor therapy, will that person be able to take another protease inhibitor without cross resistance occurring, and if resistant virus emerges after using another protease inhibitor, will subsequent use of nelfinavir offer any benefit? Much speculation has been made on these issues, based particularly on nelfinavir's causing mutation in an area of HIV protease not seen previously; therefore, some believe cross resistance will not occur to other protease inhibitors. One strategy is to combine nelfinavir with saquinavir -- not because it will necessarily inhibit HIV, but because it increases the blood level of saquinavir to higher levels. Clinical trials adding nelfinavir to other antiretroviral drugs showed dramatic decreases in viral load, but making comparisons to other drug regimens is difficult due to multiple differences between regimens. Some researchers believe that nelfinavir is similar to indinavir and ritonavir as far as antiretroviral efficacy. Nelfinavir is different because it penetrates the central nervous system. Nelfinavir does not have to be taken on as strict a schedule as other protease inhibitors, and should be taken with food. Certain drugs should not be taken with nelfinavir, such as the antihistamines astemizole and terfenadine, the motility agent cisapride, the benzodiazepines triazolam and midazolam, and the antimycobacterial agent, rifampin. When compared with other antiretrovirals, nelfinavir appears to be better tolerated with fewer toxic side effects.",

    "47": "Phencyclidine (PCP) induces stereotyped behaviour and social isolation in rats; comparisons with clinical observations have suggested that these behaviours may mimic certain aspects of the positive and the negative symptoms, respectively, of an acute schizophrenic episode. Novel antipsychotics are effective in treating the positive symptoms in schizophrenic patients and have also shown some promise in treating the negative symptoms. In the present study the effects of the novel antipsychotics remoxipride (2.5-20 mg/kg), risperidone (0.02-0.63 mg/kg), sertindole (0.01-2.5 mg/kg), olanzapine (0.16-2.5 mg/kg) and quetiapine (0.16-10 mg/kg) on PCP-induced behaviours were determined. The drugs were administered daily for 3 or 21 days in combination with vehicle or 2.0 mg/kg of PCP for the last 3 days of the administration regime, and the rats were tested using the social interaction test. The antipsychotic drugs all reliably reduced the level of PCP-induced stereotyped behaviour and had distinct effects on PCP-induced social isolation. Comparison with clinical findings suggests that the PCP-induced behaviours respond to treatment with antipsychotic drugs in a manner that correlates well with clinical observations, and that this animal model of schizophrenia may be useful for evaluating novel drug candidates. However, the study also showed that additional experiments are required to determine the specificity by which antipsychotic drugs alleviate PCP-induced behaviours because most of the drugs also affected considerably the behaviour of the control animals.", 
    "48": "Male Wistar rats were exposed to a two-component multiple schedule: a random-interval 30 s schedule of pellet presentation and a conjoint random-interval 30 s schedule of pellet presentation, random-interval 2 s schedule of timeout 10 s presentation. Once responding had stabilized subjects were injected intraperitoneally with vehicle, chlordiazepoxide (1-30 mg/kg), buspirone (0.1-4.2 mg/kg) or cocaine (1-30 mg/kg), 15 min before the start of the experimental session. Before drug administration, punished response rates were less than 30% of unpunished response rates for four of the six subjects, and 60% and 75% for the other two. Low doses of chlordiazepoxide (1 and 3 mg/kg) increased punished responding (range 25-300%), and slightly increased unpunished response rates (by 25% in all but one subject, whose rates increased by 75%). The higher doses of chlordiazepoxide (10-30 mg/kg) dose-dependently decreased response rates in both components. The lower doses of buspirone (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) either did not affect, or decreased response rates in both components of the schedule; the higher doses produced dose-dependent decreases. Low doses of cocaine (1, 3 and 5.6 mg/kg) did not affect response rates in either component of the multiple schedule, whereas higher doses produced a dose-dependent decrease in response rates, except for one subject whose punished response rates increased substantially. The behavioral effects of chlordiazepoxide and buspirone observed in the present experiment were similar to those observed in experiments in which response rates were suppressed by shock presentation.", 
    "49": "The aim of the present study was to investigate whether ethanol training affects the ability of Ro 15-4513 to block the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol dose differentially. Three different groups of rats were trained to discriminate 1.0 g/kg ethanol (n = 8), 1.5 g/kg ethanol (n = 7) or 2.0 g/kg ethanol (n = 8) from water in a two-lever, food-reinforced procedure. Ethanol and water were administered by gavage 20 min before the onset of the session. When the discrimination performance was stable, rats were pretreated with Ro 15-4513 (1-17 mg/kg; i.p.) 5 min before the administration of ethanol. Ro 15-4513 attenuated the discriminative stimulus effects of 1.0 and 1.5 g/kg ethanol but not 2.0 g/kg ethanol in each of the ethanol training groups. Overall, blockade of the discriminative stimulus effects of 1.0 and 1.5 g/kg ethanol by 5.6 mg/kg Ro 15-4513 occurred without significantly altering response rates or blood ethanol concentrations. A decrease in blood ethanol concentration was, however, found with 17 mg/kg Ro 15-4513 in combination with 2.0 g/kg ethanol. These results suggest that the benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist, Ro 15-4513, can attenuate the discriminative stimulus effects associated with low to moderate doses of ethanol (1.0-1.5 g/kg).", 
    "50": "Six healthy male volunteers (aged 21-31 yr) were trained to discriminate between the methylxanthine caffeine (320 mg/70 kg, p.o.; e.g. drug A) and placebo (drug B). Then dose-effect curves were determined for triazolam (0.1-0.56 mg/70 kg), alone and in combination with the caffeine training dose (n = 6), buspirone (1.0-32.0 mg/70 kg), alone and in combination with the caffeine training dose (n = 4), and caffeine (56-560 mg/70 kg), alone and in combination with a selected dose of triazolam (n = 5). Triazolam blocked the discriminative effects of the caffeine training dose in a dose-related manner in five out of six subjects; whereas buspirone did so in only one out of four subjects. Different doses of caffeine alone generally produced dose-related increases in caffeine-appropriate responding; when administered concomitantly with triazolam, the caffeine dose-effect curve shifted significantly to the right. Triazolam and caffeine, but not buspirone and caffeine, generally produced significant interactions on several self-report and psychomotor performance measures. These results indicate that, at the doses tested, the caffeine discriminative stimulus can be blocked, at least partly by triazolam, but not by buspirone, which is consistent with the pharmacological actions of these compounds.", 
    "51": "Behavioural modifications induced by psychotropic drugs results primarily from their pharmacological properties. According to classification of psychotropic drugs, sedative compounds contrast with psychostimulating medications. Behavioural effects of psychotropic drugs depend on dosing, subject's status (patient or healthy volunteer), acute or chronic administration, and environment. Some psychotropic compounds, particularly sedative drugs, decrease the level of mental alertness and cognitive functioning. But those deleterious effects tend to disappear during the course of a repeated administration. Some psychotropic drugs, especially benzodiazepines, induce a tolerance effect, eventually a psychic or a physiological dependence state evidenced by withdrawal reactions. Such similar dependence processes have been reported with other psychotropic drugs. Forensic problems have been attributed to some psychotropic compounds, like benzodiazepines: paradoxical aggressive reactions, psychomotor automatism; Psychotropic drugs usually can confer a positive effect on behaviour owing to their therapeutic action by the way of improving the illness and consequently the life of patients in the cases of depression, anxiety or schizophrenia.",

The following factors are specially considered: the type of request of the person, often dominated by a behaviour of \"relieved\" people; the medical answers, frequently marked with a preferential if not exclusive rest on the chemical molecule; the financial limitations imposed by the national level, very probable indirect origin of changes in the medical status and role, therefore of distortions concerning the therapeutic relation; a contrario, marketing phenomena involved in large economic challenges.

In this article we report that the level of these compounds in the blood decreased by 40% after therapy with rifaximin, which reduces the aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacterial flora.

    "63": "Sismotherapy (ST) brings about numerous neurobiological changes, particularly changes in neuromediators and their receptors, second messengers, neuropeptides and neurotropic factors, a number of which are hypothesized to play a role in the pathophysiology or therapeutics of affective disorders (M. Fink). What is not yet known is which of these mechanisms is crucial for the psychotropic and anticonvulsant effects of ST. However, it is clear that the effects of ST tend to be relatively acute, and do not attack the deep-seated abnormalities that are the underlying causes of recurrences of affective disorders. This is corroborated by the fact that in animals, most of the effects of ECS on catecholamines and their receptors (and on receptors for benzodiazepines or neuropeptides such as TRH) tend to be relatively transient, and in most cases have been found to represent compensatory adaptations to the induced motor convulsions. However, recent preclinical data using attenuation, and clinical findings using reiterated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), suggest that it may not be necessary to provoke a clonic convulsion in order to achieve the beneficial psychotropic and anticonvulsant effects of ST. In rodents receiving stimulation to the cerebellar tonsil, seven daily subacute low-frequency sessions (stimulation at 1 Hz for 15 minutes) produced clear improvement in clonic convulsions and in post-discharge thresholds, together with durable inhibition of convulsions when stimulation was resumed (Weiss et al., 1995). Stimulation at 1 Hz for 15 minutes was more effective than stimulation at 10 or 20 Hz in attenuating convulsions. Although reiterated ECS also induced an anti-triggering effect, this dissipated rapidly over five days (Post et al., 1984). It is of great interest that recent publications have shown that rTMS at 10 or 20 Hz to the left frontal cortex, administered to patients suffering from refractory depression (George et al., 1995) or to patients (hospitalised or not) with milder degrees of depression (Pasquale-Leon et al., 1996), had a moderate or marked antidepressant effect. In these studies, rTMS showed few unwanted effects (other than mild pain in some patients, due to contraction of the temporal muscles); it did not induce motor convulsions, and did not, as such, appear to be associated with the memory loss described in subjective accounts or in preliminary neuropsychological tests (Little and Kimbrell et al., 1996). The optimal frequencies, durations and positions for rTMS to maximise its antidepressant effect still remain to be determined. However, the first controlled and open studies have tended to show that (because of the capacity of rapid magnetic fluxes to produce sub-convulsant electrical discharges that are relatively localised in the brain), rTMS may be found to be a clinically useful antidepressant model. This would suggest the possibility that some of the neurochemical changes induced by the clonic convulsions of ECS could be directly induced by stimulation at the very edge of the threshold (but still below it); this would open up the hope that one day these endogenous neurochemical processes could be identified and exploited in an optimal way for therapeutic purposes.", 
    "64": "ECT, in which first experiments were made by the italian Cerletti more than half a century ago, underwent, in the seventies, a definite decline, as it was less and less applied to patients, a result of the influence of anti psychiatry. During the last fifteen years, there has been a legitimate renewal of the interest for this therapy; its indications seem now well codified and its techniques and practises have evolved considerably. Actually, in order to carry out ECT under general anaesthesia, it is necessary to have a pluridisciplinary team, assembling nurses, anaesthesists and psychiatrists that will use more and more effective appliances and adequate anaesthetics. Many of the parameters able to influence ECT's effectiveness are now well known and can be used and adapted according the individual characteristics of each patient. These parameters are: the lateralisation of the electrodes, the intensity of the electric current, the duration of the epileptic fit, the modification that appear in electroencephalography and the frequence of the sessions. According to different investigations, it seems that we must systematically question the medical treatments we associate to ECT. For instance, it is highly recommended not to prescribe with ECT benzodiazepines or antiepileptic mood stabilizers, while antidepressants or neuroleptics do not seem to exert any influence on the effectiveness of the treatment. Some authors think caffeine and triiodothyronin (T3) could have an interesting effect when combined with ECT. As to the indications of shock therapy, they can be now more and more precisely defined making of this treatment an indispensable instrument in the cure of depressive disorders. But ECT is also appropriate in maniac disorders once neuroleptic treatment has failed or else in the very beginning in highly acute cases, and mainly in mixed episodes for which medical treatment is often difficult to adapt. In schizophrenia, ECT can also be prescribed in definite circumstances as catatonia, paranoid states or schizoaffective episodes. Therefore, ECT constitutes a safe and comfortable therapy for the patient since its side effects are essentially characterized by cognitive disorders, and its main contraindications consist of severe cardiovascular diseases. ECT is also an essential tool in some definite cases.", 
    "65": "A Triage screening system that utilizes a simple and rapid deproteinizing procedure using solid sulfosalicylic acid has been evaluated in 62 blood and 27 urine samples obtained from 72 consecutive autopsy cases. Among the blood samples, 11 were positive for amphetamines (AMP), 3 for barbiturates (BAR), and 1 for opiates (OPI). Of the 11 samples that were positive for AMP, only 1 contained methamphetamine (at a concentration of 1.37 micrograms/ml). All 10 samples that were falsely positive for AMP contained phenethylamine, a putrefactive amine, at concentrations of 0.83 to 2,070 micrograms/ml. Apparent negative reactions of the Triage system for benzodiazepines (BZO), AMP, BAR and tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) were observed in three, two one and one blood samples, respectively. These drugs were present in concentrations that were much lower than the lower detection limits of the device. Among the urine samples, nine were positive for AMP, three for BZO, three for BAR, two for OPI and one for TCA. Of the nine samples that were positive for AMP, only three contained methamphetamine (at concentrations of 7.95 to 44.9 micrograms/ml) and six contained no methamphetamine but did contain phenethylamine at concentrations of 0.52 to 14.3 micrograms/ml. False positive Triage reaction were observed only for AMP. There were no false negative Triage reactions from either the blood or urine samples examined for eight classes of drugs of abuse, namely phencyclidine (PCP), BZO, OPI, cocaine metabolites (COC), cannabinoids, AMP, BAR and TCA. The Triage screening system is not able to detect therapeutic or non-toxic levels of drugs of abuse in blood or to discriminate between AMP and putrefactive amines in moderately-to-heavily decomposed blood and urine samples. However, it may still be a useful tool in the field of forensic toxicology for the following reasons: 1) the deproteinizing method causes little reduction in the sensitivity of the Triage screening device to the drugs of abuse, even in turbid urine samples, and 2) it is able to detect toxic levels of PCP, BZO, COC, OPI and BAR in any kind of blood sample.",

Like NL, other areas of the tissue section that showed labeling with the gamma 2 probe, such as the medial vestibular nucleus (VeM) and granule cells of the cerebellum (CB), also labeled with the alpha 1 probe. Thus, given that NM labeled with the gamma 2 probe, the absence of the alpha 1 subunit was unusual in this tissue. This difference in subunit composition suggests that there may also be a difference in GABA receptor function in NM compared to these neighboring areas. One feature of the GABAA receptor believed to be related to the presence of gamma 2 and alpha 1 subunits is specific pharmacological properties of the benzodiazepine modulatory site. It has been proposed that the alpha 1 subunit is necessary for producing a GABAA receptor with a benzodiazepine site that has Type I binding characteristics. The present experiments challenge this hypothesis. Based on the differential presence of the alpha 1 subunit, one would expect that GABA receptors in NM would show different benzodiazepine binding properties than NL, VeM, and CB. However, displacement of 3H-flunitrazepam binding using CL 218,872, which differentiates between the Type I and Type II receptors, showed no difference between these areas. Additionally, the relatively high affinity for CL 218,872 suggests that even NM contains Type I receptors.", 
    "67": "We report 170 cases of perineal neuralgia due to pudendal nerve compression within Alcock canal or by ischiatic spine. 117 women and 53 men were investigated. Mean age was 60.3 years and the follow-up one year. Infiltrations of the pudendal nerve in the ischio-rectal fossa (pudendal canal or Alcock canal) with corticoids under CT-scan guidance, were successful immediately in only 1/3 of the cases. Infiltrations of the nerve near by ischiatic spine (radioscopic guidance) were successful in 57 p. 100, but only in 15 p. 100 of the cas after one year. Surgical treatment (performed in 27 cases) was good (8 or excellent (9). For all treatments, the results are good in 65 p. 100 of the cases. Perineal neurophysiologic examinations are useful to confirm pudendal nerve lesion and propose specific medical and/or surgical treatment.", 
    "68": "Diazepam is a representative drug of benzodiazepines. The subjects were 9 right-handed healthy male volunteers 21 25 years of age. Double blind crossover trials with placebo control were conducted in a random sequence at an interval of 1 week. Diazepam 10 mg and placebo were administered as single oral doses. Three-minute EEGs were recorded with subjects' eyes opened before and 2 h after drug administration. One-minute out of the 3-minute EEGs was analyzed with FFT, and the absolute amplitude power (microV) was calculated. These results were subjected to Student's t-test (double difference) and displayed with topographic maps (t statistic significance probability mapping). Diazepam decreased the delta absolute amplitude power over left-parietal dominance, theta absolute amplitude power diffusely and alpha absolute amplitude power over parietal region dominance. It also increased the beta absolute amplitude power over left-antero-temporal region dominance. The EEG profiles taken with subjects' eyes open were different from those of diazepam with eyes-closed vigilance controlled concerning the degree of decrease of delta and beta activities and region of the effect on alpha activity.", 
    "69": "The repeated administration of nicotine at small doses, which do not produce whole body tremor or convulsion, causes tremor only in the tail (tail-tremor) of rats. The tremor is accompanied by locomotor hyperactivity without rigidity and immobility of the whole body, suggesting that the nicotine-induced tail-tremor model is useful for studying the mechanism underlying tremor associated with movement. The tail-tremor induced by nicotine was suppressed by mecamylamine, a nicotinic antagonist, but not by atropine or scopolamine, muscalinic antagonists. Moreover, the tail-tremor was suppressed by the beta-blockers propranolol and pindolol, as well as the benzodiazepines diazepam and clonazepam. Tremor at rest is observed only in Parkinson's disease, which is improved with anti-muscalinic drugs. Essential tremor is one of the typical tremors connected with movement (postural and kinetic tremor) and is improved with beta-blocker. These findings and results suggest that nicotine-induced tail-tremor is useful for the study of essential tremor in animal models.",

The washout rate of 123I-IMZ from the brain was estimated from two SPECTs done 15 min and 3 hr after injection. Although the washout was relatively slow, the rates differed in each intracerebral region, suggesting that the distribution of 123I-IMZ was gradually changing. Furthermore, assuming 123I-IMZ kinetics in the brain for the three-compartment, two-parameter model, the transition rate constant (K1) from the blood to the brain and the binding potentials (BP) of benzodiazepine to the receptor were calculated. The BP and K1 values were compared with 123I-IMZ SPECT counts and CBF values by 123I-IMP. The BP values correlated more closely with the counts on the delayed SPECT than those on the early SPECT. It was confirmed that delayed SPECT images reflect better the distribution of the benzodiazepine receptor than early images do. On the other hand, the K1 values correlated highly with CBF obtained by 123I-IMP, and this finding suggested that super-early SPECT images might be remarkably influenced by the distribution of CBF.",

    "82": "There is scientific agreement that portal systemic encephalopathy (PSE) is caused morphologically by portal systemic shunts and biochemically by constituents of the portal venous blood. Ammonium has a key role in the pathogenesis of PSE. Direct correlations with the degree of PSE have been established exclusively with glutamine, i.e. the terminal product of the peripheral detoxification of ammonium. In PSE, ammonium is probably responsible for damage to astrocytic and neuronal cells. Ammonium's toxic effect is due to the intracerebral glutamine synthesis. After several metabolic steps, which will be discussed in detail, brain cell damage is caused directly or indirectly (exitotoxically) by energy deficiency. Hyperammonemia and PSE are each well defined though different forms of disturbance. Therefore, ammonium is not the sole decisive factor in the pathogenesis of PSE. We performed a detailed and critical analysis of all studies on amino acid therapy of PSE, especially those that were randomized and controlled. This analysis revealed a close and direct correlation between qualitative and quantitative dosages of amino acids on one hand, and parallel improvements of amino acid imbalance (essentially associated with PSE) and degree of PSE on the other. A close and direct dose/efficacy correlation must be assumed. Disturbed plasmatic amino acid homeostasis and cerebral monoaminergic neurotransmission are probably important pathogenic factors of PSE. A fundamental cofactor in the efficacy of each adequate amino acid therapy might be a substantial decrease of endogenous ammonium production. Physiologic benzodiazepines may also have an important function in the pathogenesis of PSE: not so, however, the glutamate-ergic and GABA-ergic neurotransmission, which are disturbed principally in PSE. In close correlation to pathogenesis, established and proposed therapies of PSE are critically discussed.",

Benzodiazepine injecting was common, with 28% of the sample having injected these drugs, 13% in the 6 months preceding interview. Current benzodiazepine injectors showed greater polydrug use, injection-related HIV risk-taking behaviour, criminal involvement, psychological distress and injection-related health problems, as well as poorer general health, and an increased risk of having overdosed, than other users of benzodiazepines. Of those subjects who had injected benzodiazepines, 55% were no longer current benzodiazepine injectors. Concern for general health emerged as the most common reason for having made a transition away from injecting, and for being likely to make such a transition.", 
    "85": "Anterograde amnesia is one of the troublesome adverse effects of the benzodiazepines, especially when they are used as tranquillizers. Interestingly, benzodiazepines also produce retrograde facilitation. In this review, a unifying hypothesis concerning both the cognitive enhancement and the cognitive decrement is discussed: the decrease in vigilance or sedative-hypnotic properties of the benzodiazepines induces a superficial type of encoding and consolidation. This is expressed in anterograde amnesia. The shallower encoding also causes less retrograde interference and retrograde facilitation is the result. In this way also the positive effect of sleep on memory is explained. In a series of experiments, this hypothesis was investigated. Anterograde amnesia and retrograde facilitation was demonstrated after benzodiazepine intake in healthy, volunteers. It was striking that amnestic effects and retrograde facilitation were most prominent when memory was tested one week after drug intake. A decrease in vigilance was also obtained by sleep deprivation and an increase by the gavage of the central stimulant methylphenidate. The latter vigilance increasing drug did not change memory aspects. Also memory effects were hardly present in sleep deprived subjects with low levels of vigilance and the performance on memory tests were not changed. This jeopardizes the vigilance hypothesis of the memory effects of the benzodiazepines. However, amnesia under the influence of benzodiazepines was less for semantic related words than for unrelated words. This suggests that information might be stored without appropriate contextual cues. Only under special circumstances this information can be retrieved. It is further speculated that this storage costs less efforts leading to less retrograde interference and consequently retrograde facilitation.", 
    "86": "This study investigated factors associated with the dose of antipsychotic medication prescribed at a schizophrenia unit outpatient clinic. The antipsychotic drug dose prescribed for 364 patients was converted to chlorpromazine equivalents (CPE) per day and concurrent prescriptions of lithium, carbamazepine, benzodiazepines, and antiparkinsonian drugs were recorded. We found that patients prescribed lithium, carbamazepine, and/or benzodiazepines as adjunctive drugs were receiving significantly higher doses of antipsychotic medication (p < 0.05). Patients prescribed both depot and oral neuroleptic drugs concurrently were receiving higher CPE-equivalent doses than those receiving either drug type alone (p < 0.05), and high-potency oral drugs were prescribed in higher CPE-equivalent doses than low-potency oral drugs (p < 0.05). Patients prescribed antiparkinsonian drugs were not receiving significantly higher CPE-equivalent doses of antipsychotic medication than patients not prescribed these drugs. There were no significant gender differences in the use of adjunctive drugs or in CPE-equivalent antipsychotic drug dose. Further research is needed to determine whether these findings are related to factors such as illness severity or to physician's prescribing practices.", 
    "87": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) may have a role in epilepsy and in mediating antiepileptic drug effects. Since PBR in blood mononuclear cells may be acted on by anticonvulsant drugs, we investigated possible modifications of these receptors in newly diagnosed patients, before and after antiepileptic treatment and in drug-resistant epileptic patients. A significantly lower receptor density, with no difference in affinity, was observed in drug-resistant patients, compared to newly diagnosed patients and to normal age-related controls. We suggest the possible use of PBR as a peripheral marker of drug response.", 
    "88": "The Neurotoxicity Scale was devised as a patient-based report scale to assess the adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs on cognitive function. In a previous report we reported the clinical validity of the scale, tested in a double-blind randomized study, using a benzodiazepine in normal volunteers. In the present study, the clinical sensitivity, construct validity and reliability of the scale was tested in patients with epilepsy. Patients (n = 189), selected from both participating centres, representative for the patients with chronic epilepsy were included in the study. Reliability was tested with Cronbachs alpha and yields an almost maximal score (.95). Clinical sensitivity was compared with the previous normal volunteer study and was evaluated as satisfactory. Construct validity showed a five-factor structure, explaining 66.5% of the variance, with 'fatigue and slowing' as the dominant factor. In line with the assumptions for this scale and with the results obtained in normal volunteers, the scale appears to be unsuitable for differential assessment of type or severity of drug-induced impairment. The most valid primary outcome measure is the overall score that renders a global ('all or nothing') evaluation indicating that a subject experiences cognitive impairment and associates this with the antiepileptic treatment. Other factors that may impair cognitive function, such as seizure frequency do not influence this score. The scale has therefore maximal applicability as a screening instrument in outpatient practice and in early (phase II, IIIa) drug trials.", 
    "89": "To test the hypothesis that only dietary protein (Pro; chicken egg albumin) and not amino acids (AA), carbohydrates (CHO; cornstarch), or fats (Fat; corn oil) produces a satiating effect via cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors, devazepide was coadministered with each macronutrient. Given alone (in 4 ml ig), Pro (0.75, 1.0, and 1.5 g), AA (1.0 g), CHO (1.4 g), and Fat (2.4 g) suppressed (P < 0.05) food intake in the first hour by 0.5, 0.8, and 1.1 g; 1.9 g; and 1.0 g, respectively, and in the first 2 h of feeding by 0.8, 1.2, and 1.3 g; 1.7 g; 0.7 g; and 1.5 g, respectively. When coadministered with devazepide (0.5 mg/kg body wt ig), the suppression of food intake caused by Pro, AA, CHO, and Fat treatments was modulated in the first hour by 60, 50, and 55%; 16%, 11%; and 10%, respectively, and during 0-2 h by 63, 92, and 54%; 29%; 0%; and -20%, respectively. Devazepide (0.5 mg/kg) given intraperitoneally also modulated Pro intake suppression during the first hour by 33% and during 0-2 h by 79%. Devazepide appears to interact with mechanisms of Pro-induced food intake suppression, but not AA-, Fat-, or CHO-induced food intake suppression. These studies provide evidence that CCK receptors play a role in Pro (albumin)- but not AA-, CHO (corn starch)-, or Fat (corn oil)-induced food intake suppression in rats.", 
    "90": "In six conscious dogs we compared the action of the M1-receptor antagonist telenzepine (20.25-81.0 nmol.kg-1.h-1), the cholecystokinin (CCK) antagonist L-364,718 (0.025-0.1 mg.kg-1.h-1), and combinations of both on the pancreatic secretory response to intraduodenal tryptophan, given against a secretin background before and after truncal vagotomy. Before vagotomy, the higher doses of telenzepine and of L-364,718 significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the protein response to tryptophan by up to 97%. After vagotomy, all doses of L-364,718 abolished the protein response, whereas telenzepine had no further effect. Before and after vagotomy, all combinations abolished the protein response. The plasma CCK-like immunoreactivity basally, during secretin, and in response to tryptophan was not altered by vagotomy, telenzepine, and/or L-364,718. These findings indicate that in dogs 1) potentiation exists between M1 receptors and CCK for stimulation of the pancreatic enzyme response to intraduodenal tryptophan, 2) the cholinergic fibers of the enteropancreatic reflex activated by tryptophan run within the vagus nerves and end at least in part on M1 receptors, 3) CCK acts in part independently of the vagal nerves, and 4) the CCK release by intestinal tryptophan is not influenced by vagotomy, telenzepine, and/or L-364,718.", 
    "91": "It has been reported that the clinical and electroencephalographic profiles of zolpidem, a non-benzodiazepine drug which binds preferentially to the omega 1 benzodiazepine recognition sites located within the GABAA receptor complex, are different from those of benzodiazepine drugs, which bind non-selectively to the omega 1 and omega 2 sites. In order to clarify the electrophysiological mechanism underlying the unique profile of zolpidem, the present study compared the enhancing effects of zolpidem and two benzodiazepine drugs, triazolam and diazepam, on recurrent inhibition. This inhibition was expressed as suppression of the orthodromically induced population spikes by the preceding antidromic stimulation of the alveus in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. The rank order of potency for enhancing recurrent inhibition was triazolam > diazepam > zolpidem. From the present results and previously reported findings that zolpidem has a lower affinity for the omega 2 sites than diazepam while both have the same affinity for the omega 1 sites, we concluded that the hippocampal recurrent inhibition appears to be enhanced mainly by activation of the omega 2 sites, but not by that of the omega 1 sites. Furthermore, the lower potency of zolpidem for enhancing recurrent inhibition may underlie its unique profile in terms of its clinical and electroencephalographic effects.", 
    "92": "In previous research, the drug flumazenil has been categorized both as a pure benzodiazepine antagonist and as a benzodiazepine partial agonist. The following studies used an elevated plus maze to test whether flumazenil would exert any antianxiety action in rats. While chlordiazepoxide (3.0 mg/kg), ethanol (0.75 g/kg), and the atypical benzodiazepine zolpidem (1.0 mg/kg) all significantly increased time spent on the open arms and percent open arm entries, flumazenil (1-10 mg/kg) alone did not produce any anxiolytic effects on the maze. Withdrawal from chronic ethanol treatment led to a decrease in open arm time and percent open arm entries. Flumazenil (3.0 mg/kg) blocked these changes, suggesting that the effects of flumaxenil are at least partially dependent upon the levels of stress or anxiety in the subjects. An anxiolytic action of flumazenil was not seen following the central administration of the neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), which reduced open arm time on the elevated plus maze. These results support the hypothesis that the mechanism of action for flumazenil effects on the anxiety observed during ethanol withdrawal involves antagonism of an endogenous benzodiazepine inverse agonist, rather than activity as a partial agonist or blockade of CRF-mediated effects.", 
    "93": "A fast and reliable method for the MEKC separation and determination of benzodiazepine antipileptics and their active metabolites in serum has been developed, using a separation buffer composed of borate (pH 9.5), SDS (18 mM), and acetonitrile (14%) as an organic modifier. The method is sensitive enough to be used clinically with a precision of less than 3% for the analysis of nitrazepam, clonazepam, clobazam, diazepam and their desmethyl metabolites in serum.", 
    "94": "Enhancement of GABAA receptor function with benzodiazepine (BZ) site agonists can disrupt memory formation and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. To investigate this further the effects of the agonist, flunitrazepam, were contrasted with that of the inverse agonist, methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), on NMDA-dependent LTP induction in the CA1 region of mouse hippocampus. Under control conditions, a priming stimulus (10 stimuli at 100 Hz) potentiated e.p.s.p. slopes by 198%, and subsequent burst stimuli (4 x 10 events at 100 Hz every 20 sec) by 306%. This potentiation was blocked by the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 and the glycine site antagonist L-701,324. Flunitrazepam (1 microM) alone caused a slight but significant reduction in e.p.s.p.s to 83% of control, suppressed LTP induced by priming stimuli (133%) and burst stimuli (188%), but not that induced by sustained high-frequency stimulation (2 x 100 events at 100 Hz, 20 sec apart). The suppression of LTP induction by flunitrazepam was blocked by the benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil. In contrast, the inverse agonist DMCM (100 nM) potentiated LTP formed by both priming (to 283%) and burst stimuli (to 477%). This was associated with an enhancement of paired pulse facilitation during the induction phase and the subsequent appearance of paroxysmal burst discharges. Therefore, in addition to improvements in learning and memory as a result of improved vigilance, benzodiazepine inverse agonists can have direct effects on synaptic processes thought to contribute to memory formation.", 
    "95": "Although there is some evidence that compounds acting at 5-HT2 receptors show anxiolytic activity, little is known about the specific involvement of the different 5-HT2 receptor subtypes in the modulation of anxiety-related responses. In the present study, the behavioural effects of mianserin, a non-selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, MDL 100,907, a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, and SB 206553, a selective 5-HT2B/2C receptor antagonist, were investigated in two rat (the Vogel drinking conflict and the elevated plus-maze tests) and two mouse (i.e. the mouse defense test battery (MDTB) and the light/dark choice test) models of anxiety. Diazepam was used as a positive control. In the Vogel drinking test, mianserin (10 mg/kg) and SB 206553 (3-30 mg/kg), but not MDL 100,907, increased punished responding. Similarly, mianserin (1 mg/kg) and SB 206553 (3-10 mg/kg), but not MDL 100,907, increased entries into the open arms of the elevated plus-maze. These effects are consistent with anxiolytic-like actions of mianserin and SB 206553, although the magnitude of the effects of these two compounds was less than those of diazepam. In addition, in the MDTB, the 5-HT2 antagonists did not clearly affect the defensive reactions of mice exposed to a rat stimulus and they failed to reverse the avoidance of the illuminated box in the light/dark choice test. These results indicate a lack of anxiolytic-like action of the compounds in mice. These behavioural profiles suggest that blockade of the 5-HT2A receptor may not reduce anxiety and demonstrate that 5-HT2B and/or 5-HT2C receptor subtypes may be primarily involved in the anxiolytic-like effects of mianserin and SB 206553 in rats.", 
    "96": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of low dose midazolam (MZ) on memories and ease of management of spinal anesthesia. The low doses of MZ were administered to 70 patients (ASA 1-2), of whom 37 patients were premedicated with atropine sulfate 0.5 mg and pethidine hydrochloride (group P), with 33 patients receiving no premedication (group N). Double blind randomized trials were conducted with the doses of MZ (0, 0.03, 0.06 mg.kg-1), and MZ was administered i.v. to patients just prior to spinal puncture. The short-term and long-term memories were impaired after administration of MZ in both groups. We conclude that MZ appears to be a suitable replacement for other benzodiazepines for relieving anxiety of patients during surgery.",

Recently, liver transplantations have been performed in these patients in the USA and Europe. We experienced the anesthetic managements of liver transplantations in two OTCD patients, who had been suffering from several episodes of hyperammonemic decompensation despite a restricted protein diet with administration of sodium benzoate. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with a combination of fentanyl and midazolam in both cases. Their postoperative courses were good without any neurological damages, though one patient had hyperammonemic attack during the operation.", 
    "98": "In order to evaluate the difference in pharmacological mechanism between midazolam and propofol, we focused on the interaction between dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons in the striatum because of its important role in the regulation of motor system and arousal response, and examined these inhibitory effects on dopamine (DA) release induced by high-K from the rat striatal slice using the fast-cyclic voltammetry method. Between 0.1 and 200 nmol, the standard curve of DA was linear. The peak and the sensitivity of DA oxidation were different from those of norepinephrine and DA main metabolites. The dosages between 0.1 and 10 micro M of propofol significantly blocked the high-K evoked DA release, although the dosage of larger than 50 micro M of propofol potentiated DA release. In case of midazolam, the dosages between 0.1 and 50 micro M markedly suppressed DA release induced by high-K in a dose-dependent manner. The recovery time of DA release after removal of midazolam from incubation medium was longer than that seen in the treatment of propofol. In conclusion, propofol and midazolam inhibited high-K evoked DA release from striatal slice, although these efficacies were dissimilar. Furthermore the pharmacological effects of larger dosage of propofol was different from those obtained by its smaller dosages. These results suggest that the anesthetic actions of propofol and midazolam are partially related to inhibition of DA neuron A1 activity and that the excitatory symptom induced by a larger dose of propofol may be related to its potantiation of DA release.", 
    "99": "The effects of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (Ro 15-1799), the benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist Ro 15-4513 and the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist beta-CCM on the behaviour of control and small platform stressed mice studied. Small platform stress was induced by placing the animals on small platforms (d = 3.5 cm) surrounded by water for 24 hours. This technique involves several factors of stress such as rapid eye movement sleep-deprivation, isolation, immobilization, falling into the water and soaking. In the plus-maze test small platform stress induced changes indicating anxiolytic action-an increase of the percentage of entries made onto and the percentage of time spent on the open arms. In control mice flumazenil (2.0 and 10.0 mg/kg), Ro 15-4513 (0.5; 1.0; 2.5; 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg), and beta-CCM (1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg) exerted dose-dependent anxiogenic effect. The small platform stress induced an enhancement of the anxiogenic effect of flumazenil, but not that of Ro 15-4513 and beta-CCM. The selective enhancement of flumazenil's action may be explained with the mode of action of flumazenil. It is proposed that small platform stress causes changes in the concentration of the endogenous benzodiazepine receptor ligand with stress protective activity and flumazenil acts by blocking the effects of this endogenous ligand.", 
    "100": "The effects of cholecystokinin (CCK) CCKA receptor antagonist devazepide (10 micrograms/kg and 1.0 mg/kg), CCKB receptor antagonist L 365260 (1.0 mg/kg), and CCKB receptor agonist CCK tetrapeptide (CCK-4, 75 micrograms/kg), and their concomitant administration with antidepressants desipramine (10 mg/kg) and citalopram (10 mg/kg) on rat exploratory behaviour were studied in the recently developed exploration box test. In addition, the effects of repeated administration of despiramine (10 mg/kg) and citalopram (10 mg/kg) were studied. After acute administration, CCK-4 decreased significantly the number of line crossings, rears, investigative approaches, and the time spent exploring. The time of latency and the number of entries into large arena were unchanged. Desipramine reduced all observed criterions of rat behaviour, but citalopram was ineffective. Devazepide (1.0 mg/kg) and L 365260 (1.0 mg/kg) had no effect on rat behaviour after acute or repeated administration. L 365260 (1.0 mg/kg) blocked the antiexploratory effect of CCK-4, whereas devazepide (10 micrograms/kg) did not. No interaction of CCK-4, devazepide, or L 365260 treatment with antidepressant treatment was found. Our results suggest that the administration of a CCKB agonist diminishes rat exploratory behaviour, but neither CCKA nor CCKB receptor blockade induces changes on rat exploratory behaviour in the free exploration paradigm.",

These methods helped establish in vitro high-throughput screening assays which rapidly identified Tat-TAR inhibitors from our corporate compound library. Tat-activated reporter gene assays were then used to investigate the cellular activities of the Tat-TAR inhibitors.

This study was designed to: 1) compare the safety and efficacy of intravenous fentanyl, intravenous fentanyl combined with midazolam, and intramuscular meperidine-promethazine-chlorpromazine (MPC) compound when used for painful emergency department (ED) procedures: and 2) to determine whether the addition of et-CO2 monitoring enabled earlier identification of respiratory depression in this population.", 
    "103": "Forty-two children requiring analgesia and sedation for painful ED procedures were randomly assigned to receive either fentanyl, fentanyl-midazolam, or MPC compound. Vital signs, oxygen saturation, and et-CO2 were monitored continuously. Pain, anxiety, and sedation scores were recorded every five minutes.", 
    "104": "Respiratory depression (O2 saturation < or = 90% for over the minute or any et-CO2 > or = 50) occurred in 20% of fentanyl, 23% of fentanyl-midazolam, and 11% of MPC patients (P = NS). Of those patients manifesting respiratory depression, 6/8 were detected by increased et-CO2 only. MPC patients required significantly longer periods of time to meet discharge criteria than fentanyl and fentanyl-midazolam patients (P < 0.05). No differences were noted in peak pain, anxiety, or sedation scores.", 
    "105": "Fentanyl, fentanyl-midazolam, and MPC produced a high incidence of subclinical respiratory depression. End-tidal CO2 monitoring provided an earlier indication of respiratory depression than pulse oximetry and respiratory rate alone. MPC administration resulted in a significantly delayed discharge from the ED.", 
    "106": "Transmural electrical stimulation (5-30 Hz) produced a frequency-dependent increase in the perfusion pressure of isolated, perfused dog mesenteric artery segments without the endothelium, which was abolished by prazosin or tetrodotoxin. Physostigmine inhibited the pressor response to transmural electrical stimulation, whereas atropine potentiated the response. Treatment with acetylcholine (10(-6) and 10(-5) M) dose-dependently inhibited the response to electrical nerve stimulation. The effect was reversed by the addition of atropine and AF-DX 116 at a concentration (10(-7) M) that selectively blocked the M2 receptor subtype, but not by pirenzepine or 4-DAMP. Acetylcholine did not alter the pressure raised by norepinephrine in perfused arterial segments nor the contraction caused by exogenous norepinephrine in the artery strips. 3H-overflow evoked by transmural electrical stimulation from tissues prelabeled with [3H] norepinephrine was decreased by acetylcholine (10(-6) M) in the superfused dog mesenteric arterial strips. It is concluded that acetylcholine inhibits adrenergic neurogenic contractions by interfering with the release of norepinephrine, which possibly results from activation of the prejunctional M2 receptor subtype.", 
    "107": "Cortical somatosensory evoked potentials (CSEP) allow monitoring of spinal cord function during surgery. Ketamine has been shown to enhance CSEP amplitude, but there is no previous study comparing its effects with those of other anaesthetic regimens. Therefore, we have compared the effects of ketamine with those of fentanyl, both combined with midazolam, on CSEP monitoring during major spine surgery. Twenty patients with normal preoperative CSEP were allocated randomly to a ketamine or fentanyl group. Anaesthesia was induced with ketamine 3 mg kg-1 or fentanyl 6 micrograms kg-1 i.v., and midazolam 0.3 mg kg-1 i.v in both groups, and maintained with continuous i.v infusion of ketamine 2 mg kg-1 h-1 or fentanyl 3 micrograms kg-1 h-1, combined in both groups with midazolam 0.15 mg kg-1 h-1 and 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen. CSEP were elicited by tibial posterior nerve stimulation and measured P1 and N1 latencies, and P1-N1 amplitude, CSEP were recorded before and after induction, at 15 min, 1 and 2 h after induction, during skin closure and after removal of nitrous oxide. Both groups were comparable in characteristics, duration of surgery, mean arterial pressure and temperature. CSEP latencies were not significantly affected in either group. CSEP amplitude decreased significantly over time in the fentanyl group (from mean 2.02 (SEM 0.41) to 0.95 (0.17) microV, P < 0.05), but not in the ketamine group (from 1.33 (0.36) to 1.05 (0.31) microV, ns). Nevertheless, we did not observe any significant differences in amplitudes or latencies between the two groups. The delay in obtaining the first voluntary postoperative motor response was significantly greater in the ketamine group (170 (54) vs 55 (17) min, P < 0.01). Both ketamine and fentanyl allowed us to obtain reliable CSEP during major spine surgery, and there were no significant difference between these two anaesthetic regimens for CSEP monitoring, but a longer delay for voluntary postoperative motor assessment was observed in the ketamine group.", 
    "108": "A series of 5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepin-6-one derivatives containing the succinamide skeleton has been synthesized and evaluated for M1, M2 and M3 muscarinic receptor binding affinities (in vitro) and M2 and M3 muscarinic receptor antagonistic activities (in vivo). Some of them showed higher and more selective binding affinities for M(2) muscarinic receptors than that of AF-DX 116. Among them, 11-[3-[N-[2-(N-benzyl-N- methylamino)ethyl]-N-ethylcarbamoyl]propionyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyr ido [2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepin-6-one (68) was found to be the most potent and selective M2 muscarinic receptor antagonist in vitro. This compound also strongly inhibited the oxotremorine-induced bradycardia after intravenous administration and showed 130-fold selectivity for M2 muscarinic receptors over M3 muscarinic receptors in vivo.", 
    "109": "The longterm effects of ketamine on haemodynamic parameters and exogenous catecholamine requirements were studied in twenty-five critically ill patients with catecholamine-dependent heart failure. Following sedation with midazolam (0.15 +/- 0.07, mg.kg-1.h-1) and sufentanil (0.88 +/- 0.33 microgram.kg-1.h-1), patients with impaired left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction area 30 +/- 7%) were randomly assigned to receive ketamine (2.5 +/- 0.9 mg.kg-1.h-1) and midazolam (Group A) or remained on sufentanil/midazolam (Group B). Haemodynamic measurements were performed throughout the first 24 hours after randomization. In group A cardiac index decreased by 21% (P = 0.01), mean arterial pressure increased by 13% (P = 0.01), mean pulmonary artery pressure by 14% (P = 0.04), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure by 20% (P = 0.03), and systemic vascular resistance index by 38% (P < 0.001). No significant cardiovascular effects were observed in Group B. Neither group had significant changes of exogenous catecholamine requirement. In conclusion, ketamine exhibits potential negative cardiovascular effects in patients with catecholamine-dependent heart failure. Therefore, ketamine should not be considered a first line drug for longterm sedation of patients with impaired left ventricular function.", 
    "110": "1. The pyridopyrimidine derivative IQM-95,333 ((4aS,5R)-2-benzyl-5-[N alpha-tert-butoxicarbonyl)L-tryptophyl] amino-1,3dioxoperhydropyrido[1,2-c]pyrimidine), a new non-peptide antagonist of cholecystokinin type A (CCKA) receptors, has been evaluated in vitro and in vivo in comparison with typical CCKA and CCKB receptor antagonists, such as devazepide, lorglumide, L-365,260 and PD-135,158. 2. IQM-95,333 displaced [3H]-CCK-8S binding to CCKA receptors from rat pancreas with a high potency in the nanomolar range. Conversely, the affinity of this new compound at brain CCKB receptors was negligible (IC50 > 10 microM). IQM-95,333 was a more selective CCKA receptor ligand than devazepide and other CCKA receptor antagonists. 3. Like devazepide, IQM-95,333 was a more potent antagonist of CCK-8S- than of CCK-4-induced contraction of the longitudinal muscle from guinea-pig ileum, suggesting selective antagonism at CCKA receptors. 4. IQM-95,333 and devazepide were also potent inhibitors of CCK-8S-stimulated amylase release from isolated pancreatic acini, a CCKA receptor-mediated effect. The drug concentrations required (IC50s around 20 nM) were higher than in binding studies to pancreas homogenates. 5. Low doses (50-100 micrograms kg-1, i.p.) of IQM-95,333 and devazepide, without any intrinsic effect on food intake or locomotion, blocked the hypophagia and the hypolocomotion induced by systemic administration of CCK-8S, two effects associated with stimulation of peripheral CCKA receptors. 6. IQM-95,333 showed an anxiolytic-like profile in the light/dark exploration test in mice over a wide dose range (10-5,000 micrograms kg-1). Typical CCKA and CCKB antagonists, devazepide and L-365,260 respectively, were only effective within a more limited dose range. 7. In a classical conflict paradigm for the study of anxiolytic drugs, the punished-drinking test, IQM-95,333, devazepide and L-365,260 were effective within a narrow dose range. The dose-response curve for the three drugs was biphasic, suggesting that other mechanisms are operative at higher doses. 8. In conclusion, IQM-95,333 is a potent and selective CCKA receptor antagonist both in vitro and in vivo with an anxiolytic-like activity in two different animal models, which can only be attributed to blockade of this CCK receptor subtype.", 
    "111": "Flower extracts of Hypericum perforatum, Hypericum hirsutum, Hypericum patulum and Hypericum olympicum efficiently inhibited binding of [3H]flumazenil to rat brain benzodiazepine binding sites of the GABAA-receptor in vitro with IC50 values of 6.83, 6.97, 13.2 and 6.14 micrograms/ml, respectively. Single constituents of the extracts like hypericin, the flavones quercetin and luteolin, the glycosylated flavonoides rutin, hyperoside and quercitrin and the biflavone 13, II8-biapigenin did not inhibit binding up to concentrations of 1 microM. In contrast, amentoflavone revealed an IC50 = 14.9 +/- 1.9 nM on benzodiazepine binding in vitro. Comparative HPLC analyses of hypericin and amentoflavone in extracts of different Hypericum species revealed a possible correlation between the amentoflavone concentration and the inhibition of flumazenil binding. For hypericin no such correlation was observed. Our experimental data demonstrate that amentoflavone, in contrast to hypericin, presents a very active compound with regard to the inhibition of [3H]-flumazenil binding in vitro and thus might be involved in the antidepressant effects of Hypericum perforatum extracts.", 
    "112": "A case of severe opioid toxicity is described in a 52-year-old cancer patient. The patient presented with classical clinical features of central hyperexcitability associated with opioid toxicity: delirium, myoclonus, hallucinations, hyperalgesia, and a possible seizure. This patient had a background of severe psychosocial distress and somatization in addition to a history of benzodiazepine dependence and alcohol abuse. The occurrence of opioid toxicity in this patient highlights the risks of a unidimensional approach to cancer pain, which ignores the non-organic components of pain, such as psychosocial distress, which will not respond to escalating doses of opioid medication.", 
    "113": "The role of endogenous opioid peptides in the effects of midazolam on ingestive behaviour was investigated using a detailed analysis of licking behaviour in the rat. Midazolam (1.8 mg/kg i.p.) was administered in combination with either flumazenil (10 and 20 mg/kg i.p.) or naloxone (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg i.p.). The effect on licking patterns during 60-s exposures to a range of concentrations of a fat emulsion (Intralipid) was then recorded. Midazolam significantly increased the total number of licks for Intralipid by increasing the mean bout duration. This effect is consistent with the proposal that benzodiazepines enhance palatability. Flumazenil and naloxone were ineffective when administered alone, but both drugs blocked the effect of midazolam on total number of licks by selectively attenuating mean bout duration. Midazolam also produced a significant decrease in the intrabout lick rate, probably due to the muscle relaxant effects of this drug. This decrease in the intrabout lick rate was reversed by pretreatment with flumazenil but not by naloxone. The results suggest that endogenous opioids may be important for the palatability effects of midazolam, but may not be involved in the muscle relaxant effects of this drug.", 
    "114": "PNU-101017 is a chemically novel ligand at the benzodiazepine recognition site of cloned GABAA receptors. It was reported to potentiate GABA-mediated chloride current in cultured cells with a moderate intrinsic activity and a biphasic dose-response relationship. In this study, we confirmed that PNU-101017 has a partial agonist-like effect in the antagonism of metrazole-induced seizures in mice. It produced no sedation or ataxia, but did antagonize diazepam-induced motor deficit of mice in the rotarod test. PNU-101017 was weakly active in anti-conflict anxiolytic tests, but attenuated the plasma corticosteroid response to mild stress in rats. It also antagonized stress-induced elevation of cerebellar cGMP levels in mice. Like chlordiazepoxide, it increased drinking of saline solution in thirsty rats. PNU-101017 did not potentiate the CNS-depressant effects of ethanol, and produced no evidence of physical dependence when administered repeatedly. Agonists with low intrinsic activity at the benzodiazepine receptor, such as PNU-101017, should be further explored for therapeutic uses.", 
    "115": "A new high-performance liquid chromatographic method was developed for quantification of midazolam in plasma samples from intensive care unit patients on long-term intravenous infusion of this benzodiazepine. Plasma samples (0.5 ml) were mixed with 1 microgram flurazepam (internal standard), alkalinized with 2.5 N NaOH, and extracted with toluene. The organic phase was evaporated to dryness, and the residue was dissolved in the mobile phase (acetonitrile/0.05 M phosphate buffer pH 4.5) and injected into the analytical column (C18 Nova-Pak 3.9 x 150 mm, 4 microns, maintained at room temperature; mobile phase flow rate: 1.2 ml/minute). The eluate was monitored at 207 nm, which reduced the risk of interferences from concurrent medications. Retention times of flurazepam, 1'-hydroxymidazolam (an active metabolite) and midazolam were approximately 4.5, 6.1 and 13.5 minutes, respectively. The assay was linear over the range 100 to 3000 ng/ml. The coefficients of variation of the within-day and between-day assay for the 100 to 3000 ng/ml range were < 5% and < 7%, respectively. The developed method is fast, reproducible, and well suited to monitor steady state midazolam plasma concentrations in clinical samples.", 
    "116": "A sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography method with electrochemical detection for the determination of olanzapine in human plasma is described. Olanzapine from plasma samples was isolated by a simple one-step liquid--liquid extraction with 15% methylene chloride in pentane with an extraction recovery of approximately 94% of the total olanzapine in plasma. The compound was separated on a cyano column. Under the conditions described, commonly coadministered drugs and other common antipsychotic drugs did not interfere with the analysis of olanzapine. The lower limit of determination of the assay was 0.25 ng of olanzapine per ml when 1 ml of plasma was used for the analysis. The interaassay and intraassay variance was (CV%) less than 10%. The standard curve was linear within the range of 0.25 to 50 ng/ml of olanzapine. This method has been used for the determination of plasma levels of olanzapine in patients with schizophrenia who were treated with daily oral doses of 10, 15, and 20 mg of olanzapine. The results indicate that the plasma level of olanzapine increases linearly with the administered daily oral dose (r = 0.6889, p = 0.01)."
