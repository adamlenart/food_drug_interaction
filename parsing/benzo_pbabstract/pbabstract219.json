They were referred because of cognitive deterioration and underwent repeated neurological and neuropsychological examinations and all-night electroencephalography. A previous cognitive level was known or could be estimated in all. Seven children had a continuous spikes and waves during sleep (CSWS) syndrome, with global cognitive deterioration in four and more specific cognitive decline in three, and another three children had Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS). Of the last three, two children never had seizures, while the other had localization-related epilepsy. No children experienced aggravation of clinical seizures. However, therapy was disappointing. Cognitive dysfunction did not respond to valproate and/or benzodiazepines in 9 of the 10 children. A frontal epileptic focus was found in 5 of 7 children with CSWS, and a left temporal focus in 2 of 3 children with LKS. The ESES persisted in CSWS for 5-9 years and in LKS for 1-5 years, and disappeared at puberty. Good cognitive recovery after disappearance of ESES occurred in only one child, and partial recovery in four. An unfavorable prognosis of cognitive deterioration seems to be related to long-duration ESES and/or early onset epileptic activity. The authors are of the opinion that cognitive deterioration in children, with or without manifest epileptic seizures, should mandate electroencephalographic investigation during sleep.",

    "2": "Two novel analytical methodologies using capillary electrophoresis (CE) and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) for the determination of diazepam in commercial and simulated tablet formulations were developed and compared. The CE analysis was carried out in a bare fused-silica capillary with 75 microm i.d. and total length of 50 cm (28 cm to the detector) with a buffer solution containing 20 mmol L(-1) sodium tetraborate and 20 mmolL(-1) sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), pH 9.23. The applied voltage was 20 kV and bromazepam was used as internal standard (IS). The RP-HPLC analysis was carried out in a LiChrospher((R)) 100 RP-18 (5 microm) column with a mobile phase constituted of methanol, acetonitrile and water (45:25:30) with a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min, using acetaminophen as IS. In both cases, detection was carried out by ultraviolet (UV) absorption at 242 nm. Under the optimized conditions, the CE retention times for the standard diazepam and bromazepam (IS) were 4.08 and 3.43 min, respectively, and the retention times of the RP-HPLC analysis for the standard diazepam and acetaminophen (IS) were 4.86 and 1.58 min, respectively. The resolution and efficiency for CE were 7.4 and 1.18 x 10(5)plates/m and for RP-HPLC, 7.5 and 1.76 x 10(4) plates/m. Analytical curves of peak area versus concentration presented correlation coefficients of 0.9996 for CE and 0.9994 for RP-HPLC. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) were 4.24 and 12.85 microg/mL for CE and 1.44 and 4.36 microg/mL for RP-HPLC. Relative standard deviations (R.S.D.) were 1.62 and 0.98% for CE and RP-HPLC, respectively. The percentage recovery determined with CE was 100.27+/-1.25 and with RP-HPLC was 101.12+/-2.48. Although both methodologies were shown to be suitable for the determination of diazepam in tablets, performing in a similar manner with regards to several aspects (linearity, recovery and specificity), CE provided a faster analysis and column efficiency whereas RP-HPLC presented a superior repeatability and sensitivity.", 
    "3": "The stability and compatibility of three drugs: nitroglycerin, diazepam and chlorpromazine, with a new multilayer infusion bag were studied. The study was carried out comparatively with PVC bags with which these drugs are incompatible. The drugs were diluted in 5% dextrose or in 0.9% sodium chloride isotonic solutions. Solutions were stored during 8 or 48 h with or without any protection against light. Remaining concentrations of drug were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) during the storage. The admixtures were also monitored for precipitation, color change and pH. Whatever the isotonic solution used, the loss of drugs is in discredit of the use of PVC bags for their storage. So, these three drugs would not be stored in PVC bags. In multilayer bags, no loss of drugs and no color change were detected throughout the storage period. pH values were stable during the same storage period. These three drugs were compatible with multilayer bags in all tested conditions for 8 or 48 h. The leaching of the plasticizer di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), that is incorporated into PVC to make the bags soft and pliable was not detected in the three drug solutions during storage period. Our study confirms that these three drugs are incompatible with PVC bags, on the contrary the new materiel tested was proved to be interesting for drug storage.",

The method works only in the MR domain without EEG correlation. It compares the EPI images during interictal epileptic discharges and the images \"inactivated\" by benzodiazepine. The results in five out of eight patients show that this procedure in comparison with the EEG/fMRI method gives a net improvement of spatial definition of BOLD areas. These preliminary results seem to confirm the hypothesis that the better BOLD/fMRI procedure in epilepsy is to make use of physical features of MR that, unlike EEG, is not influenced by the distance of intercerebral sources and consequently allows a more complete and undistorted display of BOLD areas.",

    "29": "Mitochondria release proteins that propagate both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cell death pathways. AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) is an important caspase-independent death regulator in multiple neuronal injury pathways. Presently, there is considerable controversy as to whether AIF is neuroprotective or proapoptotic in neuronal injury, such as oxidative stress or excitotoxicity. To evaluate the role of AIF in BAX-dependent (DNA damage induced) and BAX-independent (excitotoxic) neuronal death, we used Harlequin (Hq) mice, which are hypomorphic for AIF. Neurons carrying double mutations for Hq/Apaf1-/- (apoptosis proteases-activating factor) are impaired in both caspase-dependent and AIF-mediated mitochondrial cell death pathways. These mutant cells exhibit extended neuroprotection against DNA damage, as well as glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Specifically, AIF is involved in NMDA- and kainic acid- but not AMPA-induced excitotoxicity. In vivo excitotoxic studies using kainic acid-induced seizure showed that Hq mice had significantly less hippocampal damage than wild-type littermates. Our results demonstrate an important role for AIF in both BAX-dependent and BAX-independent mechanisms of neuronal injury.",

This increased risk has also been found in patients with dementia who take risperidone. Details concerning this relationship cannot be obtained from the sparse information supplied by the producers of risperidone and olanzapine. The pathophysiological mechanisms by which atypical antipsychotics may lead to cerebrovascular accidents are not well understood. Atypical antipsychotics are often prescribed for conditions in which evidence of the efficacy of this group of medications is lacking.

    "32": "Depressive disorders in women are not uncommon during the reproductive period. Identifying women at risk for the development of depression, early detection of depressive symptoms and an adequate treatment are important issues in preventing severe chronic depressive disorders. Do psychotherapeutic interventions not show any sufficient benefits, the use of antidepressants is indicated. In the meantime sufficient data are available concerning the use of anti-depressants during pregnancy to exclude any serious damage to the fetus or newborn. As a basic principle, a monotherapy should be favoured and the drug applicated in the lowest efficient dose. Due to the SSRI's side effect profile the choice of the antidepressant should be done in favour of serotonin reuptake inhibitors rather than tri- and tetracyclic antidepressants. For both substance groups there is no hint for any teratogenic potential. Benzodiazepine should be prescribed with caution. Negative long term effects to the newborn cannot be excluded. Based on few available data, indeed, there exists no reservation against the use of St. John's wort during pregnancy and breastfeeding. A profound ultrasound screening of the organs should be performed in case of lithium exposition, whereas newer studies showed no increase in risk for Ebstein anomaly. A multidisciplinary approach, including psychiatry, obstetrics and neonatology should be always aimed at in case of depressive disorders during pregnancy.",

Recent research in which sets of subunits containing alpha1 or alpha6 subunits were artificially linked has revealed the importance of subunit position in determining GABA(A) receptor function. Sensitivity to benzodiazepines depended on juxtaposition of an alpha1 subunit with the gamma2 subunit, whereas sensitivity to furosemide depended only on the presence of an alpha6 subunit and not on its specific location. The major utility of the linked subunit approach is to provide a mechanism for discovering the functional signatures of defined subunit arrangements, and thus a route to identifying such arrangements in vivo.",

Hyperventilation and a depressive state, which were considered to be induced by 'the premonitory state of schizophrenia', disappeared as a result of the improvement of 'the premonitory symptoms and signs' by the atypical antipsychotics. 3) Risperidone, perospirone, and olanzapine were effective for so-called \"positive early symptoms\". Risperidone, which is expected to have an acute effect, was effective in cases in which early intervention was necessary. When a depressive state was secondarily induced by risperidone, a change to perospirone was useful. Furthermore, when risperidone and perospirone were not sufficiently effective, olanzapine improved 'the premonitory symptoms and signs'. 4) In cases in which so-called \"negative early symptoms\" and a decrease in the energy-potential, such as emotional blunting, were observed, olanzapine induced improvement. 5) In 'the premonitory state of schizophrenia', treatment with atypical antipsychotics should be maintained, for both the improvement of 'the premonitory symptoms and signs' and the prevention of progression to the full-blown stage. The dose and duration of the treatment with antipsychotics should be carefully modified, with consideration for the specificity of the life cycle and life events for each patient.

Using the maximum tolerated dose of olanzapine in the phase I trial, a phase II trial was performed for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients. The regimen was 5 mg/day of oral olanzapine on the 2 days prior to chemotherapy, 10 mg on the day of chemotherapy, day 1, (added to intravenous granisetron, 10 mcg/kg and dexamethasone 20 mg), and 10 mg/day on days 2-4 after chemotherapy (added to dexamethasone, 8 mg p.o. BID days 2 and 3, and 4 mg p.o. BID day 4). Thirty patients (median age 58.5 years, range 25-84; 23 women; ECOG PS 0, 1) consented to the protocol, and all were evaluable. Complete response (CR) (no emesis, no rescue) was 100% for the acute period (24 h postchemotherapy), 80% for the delayed period (days 2-5 postchemotherapy), and 80% for the overall period (0-120 h postchemotherapy) in ten patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (cisplatin > or =70 mg/m(2)). CR was also 100% for the acute period, 85% for the delayed period, and 85% for the overall period in 20 patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (doxorubicin > or =50 mg/m(2)). Nausea was very well controlled in the patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy, with no patient having nausea [0 on scale of 0-10, M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI)] in the acute or delayed periods. Nausea was also well controlled in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, with no nausea in 85% of patients in the acute period and 65% in the delayed and overall periods. There were no grade 3 or 4 toxicities and no significant pain, fatigue, disturbed sleep, memory changes, dyspnea, lack of appetite, drowsiness, dry mouth, mood changes, or restlessness experienced by the patients. Complete response and control of nausea in subsequent cycles of chemotherapy (25 patients, cycle 2; 25 patients, cycle 3; 21 patients, cycle 4) were equal to or greater than cycle 1.

The pharmacological approach, using subtype selective ligands, is needed to complement genetic studies. We tested the effects of the non-selective antagonist flumazenil (0-20.0 mg/kg), the preferential alpha1-subunit selective antagonist beta-carboline-3-carboxylate-t-butyl ester (beta-CCt) (0-30.0 mg/kg), the non-selective agonist midazolam (0-2.0 mg/kg), the preferential alpha1-subunit selective agonist zolpidem (0-3.0 mg/kg), and the non-selective inverse agonist methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) (0-2.0 mg/kg) in the one-trial step-through passive avoidance task in rats. The compounds were administered intraperitoneally, before the acquisition test. Flumazenil and beta-CCt did not affect retention performance. Midazolam and zolpidem induced amnesia in a dose-dependent manner. The complete reversal of amnesia was unattainable. The effects of zolpidem were significantly attenuated by the both, flumazenil (10.0 mg/kg) and beta-CCt (30.0 mg/kg); by contrast, only flumazenil was considerably effective when combined with midazolam. DMCM exerted promnesic effects at 0.2mg/kg, in an inverted U-shape manner. Both antagonists tended to abolish this action. The results indicate that some other alpha-subunit(s), in addition to the alpha1-subunit, contribute to the amnesic actions of non-selective benzodiazepine site agonists in the passive avoidance task. On the other hand, a significant part of the DMCM-induced promnesic effect could involve the alpha1-subunit and/or other putative beta-CCt-sensitive binding site(s).", 
    "90": "Few animal studies have explored the interaction of nitrous oxide (N2O) with a benzodiazepine (BNZ) administered by the oral route, as used in clinical procedures involving \"conscious sedation\". The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative \"anxiolytic-like\" and sedative effectiveness of N2O, oral triazolam (TRIAZ; Halcion) or oral diazepam (DIAZ; Valium), either alone or in various combinations of drugs and doses. One hundred and twelve Swiss Webster male mice, 35-45 days old, were assigned to 28 groups, each of which contained four mice. The mouse staircase test was used for the assessment of anxiety (number of rearings) and sedation (number of steps ascended). Three doses of oral TRIAZ (0.1, 0.3, 1.0 mg/kg) or DIAZ (2.0, 3.5, 5.0 mg/kg) were given in combination with room air, or N2O/O2 at a N2O concentration of 25, 50 or 75%. Each mouse was tested once. N2O alone did not reduce NR in any concentration, but caused a significant increase in locomotion. DIAZ without N2O reduced NR only with the middle and high doses, but the addition of N2O significantly enhanced the anxiolytic-like effect of all DIAZ doses. TRIAZ, alone, reduced NR only in the highest dose, but added N2O resulted in anxiolytic-like behavior with all three TRIAZ doses. The sedative effects of the BNZs were extremely variable. Only the middle dose of DIAZ plus 25% N2O unequivocally reduced the number of steps ascended, i.e., caused sedation. TRIAZ lacked the inverted U-shaped dose-response relationship with NR usually seen with DIAZ. TRIAZ, therefore, provides better dose control. This behavioral animal model indicates that the optimal combinations for reduction of anxiety-like behavior with minimal effects on sedation are 0.1 mg/kg oral TRIAZ with 25% N2O or 2.0 mg/kg oral DIAZ with 25% N2O.",

    "92": "N-(5-Fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-N-(2-[(18)F]fluoromethoxy-d(2)-5-methoxybenzyl)acetamide ([(18)F]2) is a potent ligand (IC(50): 1.71 nM) for peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). However, in vivo evaluation on rodents and primates showed that this ligand was unstable and rapidly metabolized to [(18)F]F(-) by defluorination of the [(18)F]fluoromethyl moiety. In this study, we designed a deuterium-substituted analogue, N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-N-(2-[(18)F]fluoromethoxy-d(2)-5-methoxybenzyl)acetamide ([(18)F]5) as a radioligand for PBR to reduce the in vivo metabolic rate of the non-deuterated [(18)F]2. The design principle was based on the hypothesis that the deuterium substitution may reduce the rate of defluorination initiated by cleavage of the C-H bond without altering the binding affinity for PBR. The non-radioactive 5 was prepared by reacting diiodomethane-d(2) (CD(2)I(2), 6) with a phenol precursor 7, followed by treatment with tetrabutylammonium fluoride. The ligand [(18)F]5 was synthesized by the alkylation of 7 with [(18)F]fluoromethyl iodide-d(2) ([(18)F]FCD(2)I, [(18)F]9). Compound 5 displayed a similar in vitro affinity to PBR (IC(50): 1.90 nM) with 2. In vivo evaluation demonstrated that [(18)F]5 was metabolized by defluorination to [(18)F]F(-) as a main radioactive component, but its metabolic rate was slower than that of [(18)F]2 in the brain of mice. The deuterium substitution decreased the radioactivity level of [(18)F]5 in the bone of mouse, augmented by the percentage of specific binding to PBR in the rat brain determined by ex vivo autoradiography. However, the PET image of [(18)F]5 for monkey brain showed high radioactivity in the brain and skull, suggesting a possible species difference between rodents and primates.", 
    "93": "Intramuscular olanzapine (Zyprexa) is a rapid-acting atypical antipsychotic drug that is also indicated for use in patients with agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania, the focus of this review. Evidence from three well designed trials indicates that this formulation of olanzapine is at least as effective as intramuscular haloperidol or lorazepam in the treatment of patients with acute agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania, and has a faster onset of action. Although transient reductions in blood pressure and heart rate may occur in some patients administered intramuscular olanzapine, preliminary evidence of a general lack of clinical effect on the corrected QT (QTc) interval and a low incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) is promising. The parenteral formulation of olanzapine appears to offer an effective, fast-acting and generally well tolerated alternative in the treatment of this significant behavioural problem.", 
    "94": "Post hoc analyses of pooled results from 11 randomised controlled trials of risperidone and olanzapine in elderly dementia subjects revealed an increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events compared with placebo. Reanalysis of the risperidone trials suggests that some of the increased incidence may be accounted for by nonspecific events that were not strokes. Large observational administrative health database studies appear to confirm that risperidone and olanzapine are not associated with an increased risk of stroke in elderly patients compared with typical antipsychotics or untreated dementia patients. A larger number of subjects with vascular and mixed dementias were included in the risperidone studies compared with the olanzapine studies, which likely accounts for the increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events in the risperidone trials compared with the olanzapine studies. Potential mechanisms proposed to explain an association between atypical antipsychotics and cerebrovascular adverse events include thromboembolic effects, cardiovascular effects (e.g. orthostatic hypotension, arrhythmias), excessive sedation resulting in dehydration and haemoconcentration, and hyperprolactinaemia. However, there is little evidence to support these hypothesised mechanisms at present. The association between atypical antipsychotics and cerebrovascular adverse events requires further clarification. At the present time, this association is another factor that clinicians should consider when weighing the risks and benefits of treating behavioural and psychological disturbances in elderly dementia patients.", 
    "95": "Cytochrome P450 3A4 is a drug-metabolizing enzyme of extraordinarily broad substrate specificity. This quality imparts upon the enzyme special importance in understanding its determinants of activity and substrate recognition. Limited successes in P450 3A4 active-site structure studies have been achieved by use of mechanism-based inactivators and photoaffinity ligands. We report here the potential of photochromic agents, compounds with the ability to undergo light-induced, reversible reactions, to be used as effective photoaffinity ligands. Four such compounds of the chromene family were shown by ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy to undergo photoinduced rearrangements to highly conjugated and reactive products in buffered aqueous solution. While some of these intermediates were very long-lived (>12 h, photoactivated lapachenole), others existed for milliseconds in their opened forms (precocene I and 2,2-dimethyl-5,6-benzo-2H-chromene) and were observed by laser flash photolysis. Each of the tricyclic structures studied rapidly underwent Michael addition reactions with the test nucleophile glutathione upon irradiation to form single conjugated products. The smaller precocene I reacted more extensively to form multiple products. These attributes of the chromenes inspired testing of their potential to label cytochrome P450 3A4 in a light-dependent fashion. Access to the protein active site by lapachenole was demonstrated with the molecule's ability to competitively inhibit P450 3A4-mediated oxidative metabolism of midazolam with an IC(50) value of 71 microM. This inhibition became irreversible upon irradiation of the enzyme-ligand complex with ultraviolet light. These results clearly demonstrate that chromenes are effective photoaffinity reagents for the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes and probably other proteins as well.", 
    "96": "The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is a critical component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which is involved in the regulation of cell survival. Different forms of brain injury result in induction of the expression of the PBR in the areas of neurodegeneration, mainly in reactive glial cells. The consequences of induction of PBR expression after brain injury are unknown. To test whether PBR may be involved in the regulation of neuronal survival after injury, we have assessed the effect of two PBR ligands, Ro5-4864 and PK11195, on neuronal loss induced by kainic acid in the hippocampus. Systemic administration of kainic acid to male rats resulted in the induction of a reactive phenotype in astrocytes and microglia and in a significant loss of hilar neurons in the dentate gyrus. Administration of Ro5-4864, before the injection of kainic acid, decreased reactive gliosis in the hilus and prevented hilar neuronal loss. In contrast, PK11195 was unable to reduce reactive gliosis and did not protect hilar neurons from kainic acid. These findings suggest that the PBR is involved in control of neuronal survival and gliosis after brain injury and identify this molecule as a potential target for neuroprotective interventions.",

The affinity of ramelteon for hamster brain MT3 binding sites was extremely weak (Ki: 2.65 microM) compared to melatonin's affinity for the MT3 binding site (Ki: 24.1 nM). In addition, ramelteon showed no measurable affinity for a large number of ligand binding sites (including benzodiazepine receptors, dopamine receptors, opiate receptors, ion channels, and transporters) and no effect on the activity of various enzymes. Ramelteon inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in the CHO cells that express the human MT1 or MT2 receptors.

Depressive episodes that are resistant to treatment may also be associated with a worse course of illness in bipolar disorder, but we do not yet understand all the factors in the connection between bipolar disorder and depression. The data on the effectiveness of antidepressants in the treatment of depression in bipolar disorder vary greatly, and there have been few prospective, randomized studies on the subject. From the data so far, the rates of induction of mania for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and lamotrigine seem similar to those seen with placebo. The optimal length of time to continue antidepressant treatment in patients with bipolar disorder has not yet been determined; however, research tends to indicate that a longer term of treatment (6 months or more) may aid in the prevention of relapse. Newer U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments for depression in bipolar disorder include a combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine, which is used for depressive episodes in bipolar disorder, and lamotrigine, which is used for maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder. Psychoeducation has also been examined as a possible treatment for depression in bipolar disorder, and a study has shown that patients receiving psychoeducation plus medication may have a lower rate of relapse than patients who receive medication alone.", 
    "113": "In the year since the last review, continuing pressure on endoscopy suites to improve efficiency and reduce costs without compromising patient care has led to growing interest in alternatives to pharmacological sedation and in the use of short-acting sedatives. Relaxation music, acupuncture, and the use of small-caliber endoscopes for unsedated peroral gastroscopy have therefore been suggested as ways of increasing tolerance and reducing discomfort. With regard to ultrathin and superthin endoscopes, the results are interesting, but further data from controlled trials and in studies including larger numbers of patients are still needed. The form of sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy that has attracted greatest interest over the last year is the use by nonanesthetists of intravenous propofol, administered either alone at standard doses to achieve deep sedation, or at lower doses combined with benzodiazepines and opioids to achieve moderate sedation/analgesia. In comparison with benzodiazepines/opioids, the results were in favor of propofol: the mean time to sedation was shorter and the depth of sedation was greater. In addition, patients receiving propofol reached full recovery earlier and were discharged sooner. However, in the survey of patient satisfaction at discharge, it was found that the sedation methods did not have a significant impact on overall patient satisfaction. Some important issues concerning the narrow therapeutic range of propofol and the need for adequate training of endoscopists to deal with any problems related to deep sedation are still open - despite the growing amount of data suggesting that the drug is safe even when administered by registered nurses, an approach that is possibly more cost-effective than delivery by gastroenterologists or anesthetists. The morbidity and mortality associated with cardiopulmonary complications continue to be a significant concern during gastrointestinal endoscopy. Professional societies and national expert peer groups have issued practice guidelines for sedation and analgesia that call for continuous monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic and ventilatory status and consciousness. Direct observation is facilitated by electronic devices (pulse oximetry, capnography), directly indicating the patient's ventilatory status and the depth of sedation. Recently, it has been proposed that the bispectral index (BIS), an electroencephalography-based technique, can be used to monitor the depth of sedation during gastrointestinal endoscopy. However, the results of a recent study cast some doubt on the usefulness of the BIS, in its current version, for titrating boluses of propofol to an adequate level of sedation. Further data therefore appear to be needed to assess whether or not BIS values can help avoid unnecessary propofol dosage and can replace continuous assessment of the ventilatory effort.", 
    "114": "Potassium channels are important contributors to membrane excitability in smooth muscles. There are regional differences in resting membrane potential and K(+)-channel density along the length of the feline circular smooth muscle esophagus. The aim of this study was to assess responses of K(+)-channel currents to cholinergic (ACh) stimulation along the length of the feline circular smooth muscle esophageal body. Perforated patch-clamp technique assessed K(+)-channel responses to ACh stimulation in isolated smooth muscle cells from the circular muscle layer of the esophageal body at 2 (distal)- and 4-cm (proximal) sites above the lower esophageal sphincter. Western immunoblots assessed ion channel and receptor expression. ACh stimulation produced a transient increase in outward current followed by inhibition of spontaneous transient outward currents. These ACh-induced currents were abolished by blockers of large-conductance Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) channels (BK(Ca)). Distal cells demonstrated a greater peak current density in outward current than cells from the proximal region and a longer-lasting outward current increase. These responses were abolished by atropine and the specific M(3) receptor antagonist 4-DAMP but not the M(1) receptor antagonist pirenzipine or the M(2) receptor antagonist methoctramine. BK(Ca) expression along the smooth muscle esophagus was similar, but M(3) receptor expression was greater in the distal region. Therefore, ACh can differentially activate a potassium channel (BK(Ca)) current along the smooth muscle esophagus. This activation probably occurs through release of intracellular calcium via an M(3) pathway and has the potential to modulate the timing and amplitude of peristaltic contraction along the esophagus.", 
    "115": "Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors play an important role in the regulation of gastric acid secretion stimulated by acetylcholine; nonetheless, the precise role of each receptor subtype (M(1)-M(5)) remains unclear. This study examined the involvement of M(1), M(3), and M(5) receptors in cholinergic regulation of acid secretion using muscarinic receptor knockout (KO) mice. Gastric acid secretion was measured in both mice subjected to acute gastric fistula production under urethane anesthesia and conscious mice that had previously undergone pylorus ligation. M(3) KO mice exhibited impaired gastric acid secretion in response to carbachol. Unexpectedly, M(1) KO mice exhibited normal intragastric pH, serum gastrin and mucosal histamine levels, and gastric acid secretion stimulated by carbachol, histamine, and gastrin. Pirenzepine, known as an M(1)-receptor antagonist, inhibited carbachol-stimulated gastric acid secretion in a dose-dependent manner in M(1) KO mice as well as in wild-type (WT) mice, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of pirenzepine on gastric acid secretion is independent of M(1)-receptor antagonism. Notably, M(5) KO mice exhibited both significantly lower carbachol-stimulated gastric acid secretion and histamine-secretory responses to carbachol compared with WT mice. RT-PCR analysis revealed M(5)-mRNA expression in the stomach, but not in either the fundic or antral mucosa. Consequently, cholinergic stimulation of gastric acid secretion is clearly mediated by M(3) (on parietal cells) and M(5) receptors (conceivably in the submucosal plexus), but not M(1) receptors.",

Wistar male rats, which received psychological stress using a communication box for 5 days, were divided into two groups according to the amount of administered diazepam: no diazepam [D (0)] group and 10 mg/kg per day [D (10)] group of 12 rats each. The standardized uptake value (SUV) of (125)I-IMZ of the D (10) group were significantly lower (P < .05) than those of the D (0) group in the frontal, parietal and temporal cortices, globus pallidus, hippocampus, amygdala and hypothalamus. The serum corticosterone level ratio in the D (10) group was significantly lower than that in the D (0) group (P < .05). From the change in serum corticosterone levels, diazepam attenuated the psychological stress produced by the physical stress to animals in adjacent compartments. From the reduced binding of (125)I-IMZ, it is clear that diazepam competed with endogenous ligand for the free BZR sites, and the frontal, parietal and temporal cortices, globus pallidus, hippocampus, amygdala and hypothalamus are important areas in which (125)I-IMZ binding is strongly affected by administration of diazepam.",

The effects of rimonabant in the MDTB paralleled those observed with CB1 receptor knockout mice in this procedure. In the forced-swimming test in rats and the tonic immobility paradigm in gerbils, rimonabant (3 and 10 mg/kg per os [p.o.]) produced antidepressant-like effects that were comparable to those observed with the reference antidepressant, fluoxetine.

    "138": "The genetic basis for polymorphic expression of CYP3A5 has been recently identified, but the significance of CYP3A5 expression is unclear. The purpose of this study is to quantify the capability of verapamil, a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A, and its metabolites to inhibit the activities of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, and to determine whether CYP3A5 expression in human liver microsomes alters the inhibitory potency of verapamil. Testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation or midazolam 1'-hydroxylation was used to quantify CYP3A activity. The possibility that verapamil and its metabolites form metabolic-intermediate complex (MIC) with CYP3A was assessed using dual beam spectrophotometry. Verapamil and N-desalkylverapamil (D617) were found to have little inhibitory effect on cDNA-expressed CYP3A5 activity and did not form a MIC with cDNA-expressed CYP3A5 as indicated by the appearance of the characteristic peak at 455 nm. At 50 microM, norverapamil showed time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A5 (30%), but to a much lesser extent compared with that of CYP3A4 (80%). The estimated values of the inactivation parameters k(inact) and K(I) of norverapamil were 4.53 microM and 0.07 min(-1) for cDNA-expressed CYP3A5, and 10.3 microM and 0.30 min(-1) for cDNA-expressed CYP3A4. Human liver microsomes that expressed CYP3A5 were less inhibited by both verapamil and norverapamil. The inactivation efficiency of verapamil and norverapamil was 30 times and 45 times lower, respectively, for CYP3A5-expressing microsomes compared with CYP3A5-non-expressing microsomes. These findings indicate that the presence of variable CYP3A5/CYP3A4 expression in the liver may contribute to the interindividual variability associated with verapamil-mediated drug interactions.", 
    "139": "The quantification of medical or toxic substances in vitreous humour (VH) could be very useful in forensic toxicology when blood sample determinations are impossible due to absence or deterioration. However, few studies have been made in this area and even fewer have tried to find a relationship between drug levels in both samples. To determine a correlation ratio between blood and VH diazepam (DZ) levels, we performed an experimental study using rabbits administered with a sub-toxic dose of DZ under known and controlled conditions. Blood and VH samples were collected 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after the drug administration in order to determine DZ and its main active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam (DMD). In addition, we have studied an animal group sacrificed 2 hours after intramuscular (i.m.) drug administration with blood and VH collection 24 hours later, to evaluate the existence of possible post-mortem changes. After DZ administration, a fast absorption phase was observed with a plasma Cmax value 1 hour after, followed by a rapid concentration decrease, with a half-life of 1 hour, indicating that, besides elimination, a fast distribution to other organs and tissues and/or hepatic metabolism occurred. Diazepam Cmax value in VH was achieved between 1 and 2 hours, when plasma concentrations had already decreased to half the value. The plasma/VH DZ ratio calculated at this time was 10. In the post-mortem study, while plasma DZ concentration at 24 hours was smaller, DMD levels were higher than those at the time of death. In the VH, both DZ and DMD concentrations at 24 hours were higher than those obtained at the time of death. That is, in both fluids DZ and DMD concentrations were different from those at the time of death and post-mortem distribution and redistribution phenomena occurred. The combination of ante-mortem and post-mortem studies has allowed the determination of a correlation ratio for DZ in the rabbit of 6 x, comparing the concentrations in VH collected 24 hours after death with the concentrations detected in plasma at the time of death. This study opens new perspectives for the use of VH as a complementary sample to blood for DZ detection and confirmation. The putative relevance of the correlation ratio obtained, for forensic toxicology practice with medical substances, namely benzodiazepines, recommends further studies in humans.",

    "141": "Benzodiazepines (BZs) are prescribed for a variety of disorders, including those involving anxiety and sleep, but have unwanted side effects that limit their use. Elucidating the GABA(A) receptor mechanisms underlying the behavioral effects of BZs will help develop new drugs having both maximum clinical benefit and minimum adverse side effects. A recently developed compound is SL651498 [6-fluoro-9-methyl-2-phenyl-4-(pyrrolidin-1-yl-carbonyl)-2,9-dihydro-1H-pyridol[3,4-b]indol-1-one], which is a full agonist at GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(2)and alpha(3) subunits and a partial agonist at GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(1) and alpha(5) subunits. We assessed the ability of SL651498 to engender anxiolytic-like, motor, and subjective effects characteristic of BZ-type drugs in nonhuman primates. Anxiolytic-like activity was assessed with a conflict procedure in rhesus monkeys. Motor effects were evaluated in squirrel monkeys using observational techniques, and the subjective effects of SL651498 were assessed in squirrel monkeys trained to discriminate the nonselective BZ triazolam from saline. SL651498 engendered anxiolytic-like effects similar to conventional BZs. In addition, SL651498 fully induced muscle relaxation, but unlike conventional BZs, engendered minimal ataxia. In drug discrimination studies, SL651498 partially substituted for triazolam. This effect was blocked with the alpha(1) GABA(A) subtype-preferring antagonist beta-CCT (beta-carboline-3-carboxylate-t-butyl ester), implicating alpha(1) GABA(A) effects receptors in the subjective of SL651498. Together, these studies suggest that compounds such as SL651498 that have high intrinsic efficacy at alpha(2)GABA(A) and/or alpha(3)GABA(A) receptors may have clinical potential as anxiolytics and muscle relaxants. Moreover, a compound with reduced efficacy at alpha(1) GABA(A) and/or alpha(5) GABA(A) receptors may lack some of the motor and subjective effects associated with conventional BZs.", 
    "142": "The elevated plus-maze (EPM) is an anxiety model thought to assess different types of emotional states depending on whether or not the animals have been previously exposed to the test apparatus. Accordingly, benzodiazepine-treated rodents generally differ from controls in the first but not in the second EPM trial. Inbred Lewis and SHR rats of both sexes (N=10) were submitted twice (test and retest) to the EPM with a 24 h interval between trials. Overall strain differences (Lewis<SHR) were observed in both males and females concerning anxiety-related measures (time spent and percent of entries in the open arms) regardless of previous maze experience. Moreover, prior exposure to the test apparatus produced an overall decrease in the approach towards the open arms in both strains and sexes. The fact that genetic differences did not diminish or disappear in the second trial, suggests that test and retest in the EPM are likely to share some common emotional components and that differences between na\u00efve LEW and SHR rats are not similar to those observed between control and benzodiazepine-treated animals.", 
    "143": "Benzodiazepines are widely used for their anxiolytic, sedative, myorelaxant and anticonvulsant properties. They allosterically modulate GABA(A) receptor function by increasing the apparent affinity of the agonist GABA. We studied conformational changes induced by channel agonists at the benzodiazepine binding site. We used the rate of covalent reaction between a benzodiazepine carrying a cysteine reactive moiety with mutated receptor having a cysteine residue in the benzodiazepine binding pocket, alpha1H101Cbeta2gamma2, as a sensor of its conformation. This reaction rate is sensitive to local conformational changes. Covalent reaction locks the receptor in the conformation stabilized by positive allosteric modulators. By using concatenated subunits we demonstrated that the covalent reaction occurs either exclusively at the alpha/gamma subunit interface, or if it occurs in both alpha1 subunits, exclusively reaction at the alpha/gamma subunit interface can modulate the receptor. We found evidence for an increased rate of reaction of activated receptors, whereas reaction rate with the desensitized state is slowed down. The benzodiazepine antagonist Ro15-1788 efficiently inhibited the covalent reaction in the presence of 100 microm GABA but only partially in its absence or in the presence of 10 microm GABA. It is concluded that Ro15-1788 efficiently protects activated and desensitized states, but not the resting state.",

    "148": "Secondary prevention of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) entails intervening in the aftermath of a traumatic event to forestall the development of PTSD. There has been little psychopharmacologic research in this area. This is surprising, given that PTSD is the mental disorder with the most clearly identified cause and onset. In a translational model of PTSD's pathogenesis presented herein: A traumatic event (unconditioned stimulus) overstimulates endogenous stress hormones (unconditioned response); these mediate an overconsolidation of the event's memory trace; recall of the event in response to reminders (conditioned stimulus); releases further stress hormones (conditioned response); these cause further overconsolidation; and the overconsolidated memory generates PTSD symptoms. Noradrenergic hyperactivity in the basolateral amygdala is hypothesized to mediate this cycle. Preventing pre-synaptic norepinephrine release with alpha2-adrenergic agonists or opioids, or blocking post-synaptic norepinephrine receptors with beta-adrenergic antagonists such as propranolol, reduces hormonally enhanced memories and fear conditioning. Two controlled studies of trauma victims presenting to emergency rooms suggest that posttrauma propranolol reduces subsequent PTSD, as does one naturalistic clinical study of morphine treatment of burned children. Cortisol both enhances memory consolidation and reduces memory retrieval, leading to mixed predictions. Two controlled studies of intensive care unit patients found that cortisol reduced PTSD. One study did not find benzodiazepines effective in preventing PTSD. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antiepileptics, and alpha2-adrenergic agonists have yet to be tried.",

In in vitro experiment, KSS and TSS inhibited CYP3A activity comparable to grapefruit juice. However in in vivo experiments, oral administration of KSS did not influence the plasma concentration profile of etizolam. The maximum concentration (Cmax) of etizolam was significantly reduced when TSS was co-administered at 20 times amount of human daily dosage. Since the double of human daily dose of TSS did not suppress the absorption of etizolam, TSS would not influence the pharmacokinetics of etizolam at the usual clinical dosage. Since both KSS and TSS did not influence the metabolism of etizolam, the result of in vitro experiment would not reflect to that of in vivo experiment or in clinic.

In the anxiety models, MPEP (3--30 mg/kg), MTEP (3--10 mg/kg), and LY456236 (10--30 mg/kg) produced anxiolytic-like effects similar to the benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 6 mg/kg). However, only MPEP and MTEP were able to produce a level of anxiolysis comparable to CDP. In a series of tests examining potential side effects, MPEP and MTEP reduced body temperature and locomotor activity and impaired operant responding for food and rotarod performance at doses of 3--30 and 1--30 mg/kg, respectively.

By contrast, valproate (100-600 mg/kg) was inactive and appears to differ in its interaction with Na+ channels. The SSRI paroxetine, the GABA(A) receptor positive modulator propofol, the NMDA antagonists memantine and (+)MK-801, and the Ca2+ channel antagonist nifedipine were all inactive in the CER test, suggesting these mechanisms may not mediate the anxiolytic effect of lamotrigine. More directly, we showed that the anxiolytic effect of lamotrigine could be blocked by co-administering rats with the Na+ channel activator veratrine (0.1 mg/kg). By contrast, neither the Ca2+ channel agonist BAYK8644 (0.5 mg/kg) nor the 5-HT1A or 5-HT(1/2) antagonists WAY100635 (0.3 mg/kg) and metergoline (3 mg/kg), respectively, were able to block the effect.",

Starting treatment with venlafaxine XL instead of diazepam significantly increased the expected probability of being in remission by 83% at 6 months (from 16.8% to 30.7%), and the expected probability of relapsing at 6 months was decreased by 79% (from 16.9% to 3.5%). The expected 6-month NHS cost of using venlafaxine XL to treat GAD was estimated to be pounds sterling 353 compared to pounds sterling 311 with diazepam. Hence starting GAD treatment with venlafaxine XL (75 mg per day) instead of diazepam (5 mg three times per day) is clinically more effective and the cost-effective strategy for managing non-depressed patients suffering from GAD in the UK.",

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is involved in the regulation of both anxiety and grooming behaviours. This study investigated the predictive validity of grooming behavioural microstructure as a marker of anxiety, by examining the effects of two GABAergic reference compounds, anxiolytic diazepam (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg i.p.) and anxiogenic pentylenetetrazole (5 and 10 mg/kg i.p.) on mouse grooming. Our data suggest that the percentage of pattern transitions not fitting to the cephalo-caudal progression, and the percentage of interrupted grooming bouts are more reliable behavioural markers of stress bidirectionally sensitive to GABAergic anxiogenic and anxiolytic drugs, compared to the frequency and duration scores. Our study also confirms that detailed ethological analyses of grooming microstructure can be a useful tool in behavioural pharmacology of anxiety.", 
    "172": "Diazepam is a benzodiazepine used in the treatment of anxiety, insomnia and seizures, but with the potential for abuse. Like the other benzodiazepine anxiolytics, diazepam does not increase dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. This raises the question as to which other neurotransmitter systems are involved in diazepam dependence. The goal was to monitor dopamine and acetylcholine simultaneously following acute and chronic diazepam treatment and after flumazenil-induced withdrawal. Rats were prepared with microdialysis probes in the nucleus accumbens and given diazepam (2, 5 and 7.5 mg/kg) acutely and again after chronic treatment. Accumbens dopamine and acetylcholine decreased, with signs of tolerance to the dopamine effect. When these animals were put into the withdrawal state with flumazenil, there was a significant rise in acetylcholine (145%, P<0.001) with a smaller significant rise in dopamine (124%, P<0.01). It is suggested that the increase in acetylcholine release, relative to dopamine, is a neural component of the withdrawal state that is aversive.", 
    "173": "Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric condition characterised by episodes of mania, depression, and underlying mood instability. Anticonvulsant drugs have an established place in the treatment of the disorder, but identifying novel drugs in this class is complicated by the absence of validated animal models. We have evaluated the efficacy of three anticonvulsant mood stabilising drugs (lamotrigine, valproate, and carbamazepine) in a model of mania, in which hyperactivity is induced by the combination of D-amphetamine and chlordiazepoxide. All three drugs were effective at preventing the hyperactivity. Lower doses of valproate and carbamazepine were required to prevent hyperactivity compared to doses required to block tonic-clonic seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole. Lamotrigine was equipotent in the two models. However, the complex pharmacology of the D-amphetamine/chlordiazepoxide model means that there may be several mechanisms by which hyperactivity can be reduced, and these may have more or less relevance to the treatment of bipolar disorder. To address this issue, we also evaluated effects of the three anticonvulsants on baseline locomotion, on activity in the presence of chlordiazepoxide alone, or on activity induced by D-amphetamine alone. Based on the results, we propose that hyperactivity induced by D-amphetamine/chlordiazepoxide may arise through dopaminergic drive coupled with disinhibition caused by low doses of the benzodiazepine. The efficacy of lamotrigine may then arise through a reduction in neuronal excitability or increased glutamate transmission, these latter a consequence of the disinhibition. Carbamazepine may also reduce excitability and glutamate release, but its broader pharmacology, manifested by sedation at higher doses complicates interpretation of its efficacy and reflects its poorer tolerability in the clinic. Valproate may be effective, at least in part, through an enhancement of GABAergic transmission. The predictive validity of the D-amphetamine/chlordiazepoxide model for efficacy in bipolar disorder remains to be established, and research with a wider range of clinically tested drugs is warranted to help validate the model further. In the meantime, the model may be useful for distinguishing novel anticonvulsant drugs with different mechanisms of action.",

In the present study a modified treatment strategy (i.e. lorazepam i.m. injection or diazepam infused i.v. if lorazepam failed, not with ECT) was proposed to rapidly relieve catatonic signs in patients with schizophrenia. During a 3-year period, 14 patients with catatonic schizophrenia in Chinese ethnic background Taiwanese were brought to the emergency unit of a general hospital. First, the patients were immediately treated with lorazepam 1 or 2 ampules (2 mg/mL per ampule) i.m. injection (IMI) during 2 h. Second, if the previous 2 ampules of lorazepam IMI failed, diazepam infused i.v. (10 mg/2 mL per ampule) in normal saline 500 mL every 8 h would be done during 1 day. The response rate of catatonic signs in these 14 patients with lorazepam IMI during the first 2 h was 85.7% (12/14). However, according to the results of this method, the total response rate to benzodiazepines during 1 day was 100%(14/14). These results suggested that this modified treatment strategy could rapidly and completely relieve catatonic signs, even without the use of ECT.",

Similarly, daily treatment with MK-801 (2 x 1 mg/kg i.p./day) for the first 26 days after KA significantly reduced GCD. In contrast, GYKI52466 (30 mg/kg, s.c.) was effective only when it was injected before KA. A significant reduction of GCD was also observed after continuous administration of midazolam (10 mg/kg/h) after KA.",

EEG activity was recorded from electrodes implanted at the injection site, along with facial muscle electromyographic (EMG) activity and behavioral monitoring intermittently for up to 5 months in some animals. Drug responsiveness was assessed by using the antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) diazepam (DZP) and phenytoin (PHT) delivered systemically, while 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-nitro-2,3-dioxo-benzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX), a competitive antagonist at AMPA receptors, was administered directly to the brain to investigate the potential benefits of focal drug delivery.",

EEG spiking activity, occurring up to 80% of the time, correlated with clinical seizures consisting of interrupted behavioral activity, rhythmic bilateral facial twitching, and periods of abrupt motor arrest. Seizures were refractory to systemic administration of DZP and PHT. However, focal delivery of NBQX to the seizure site reversibly reduced EEG and behavioral seizure activity without detectable side effects.",

All nerve agents are capable of producing marked neuropathology. Seizure control is strongly associated with protection against acute lethality and brain pathology. The mainstays of therapy of nerve agent poisoned patients are atropine, pralidoxime, and benzodiazepines. Fosphenytoin provides little therapeutic anticonvulsant effectiveness for nerve agent-induced status epilepticus. Tachycardia is not a contraindication to treatment with atropine in nerve agent toxicity. Atropine should be administered to alleviate respiratory distress, symptomatic bradycardia, and as an adjunct to benzodiazepines and pralidoxime to alleviate seizure activity. In significant nerve agent toxicity, a continuous pralidoxime infusion may be considered.",

In the K/M group, 25 children received intranasal ketamine 5 mg/kg and intranasal midazolam 0.3 mg/kg 20 minutes before the induction of anesthesia. Sevoflurane in nitrous oxide and oxygen was used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. This study demonstrated the safety and efficacy of both methods with ease of administration, combined with a rapid onset of action. Both groups were equally sedated.
