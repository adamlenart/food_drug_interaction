The drug was found to be very stable over a twelve-month interval when stored at -20 degrees C with a recovery of 82%, while samples stored at 5 degrees C and 25 degrees C showed a significant decrease in their concentration with time. This information can assist the forensic toxicologist with the interpretation of results, particularly in cases where analysis has been delayed.", 
    "1": "1. The antimuscarinic effects of tripitramine were investigated in vitro in isolated driven left (force) and spontaneously beating right (force and rate) atria as well as in the ileum of guinea-pig and rat and in the trachea and lung strip of guinea-pig and compared with the effects of methoctramine. 2. Tripitramine was a potent competitive antagonist of muscarinic M2 receptors in right and left atria. The pA2 values ranged from 9.14 to 9.85. However, in the guinea-pig and rat left atria but not in guinea-pig right atria, tripitramine at lower concentrations (3-10 nM) produced a less than proportional displacement to the right of agonist-induced responses owing to the presence of a possible saturable removal process. 3. Tripitramine was about three orders of magnitude less potent in ileal and tracheal than in atrial preparations (pA2 values ranging from 6.34 to 6.81) which makes it more potent and more selective than methoctramine. 4. Another intriguing finding was the observation that the pA2 value of 7.91 observed for tripitramine in guinea-pig lung does not correlate with that found at both muscarinic M2 and M3 receptor subtypes, which clearly indicates that the contraction of guinea-pig lung strip is not mediated by these muscarinic receptor subtypes. 5. A combination of tripitramine with atropine resulted in addition of the dose-ratios for left atria as required for two antagonists interacting competitively with the same receptor site, whereas the same combination gave a supra-additive antagonism on guinea-pig ileum which suggests that tripitramine interacts with a second interdependent site. 6. Tripitramine was more specific than methoctramine since, in addition to muscarinic receptors, it inhibited only frog rectus abdominis muscular (pIC50 value of 6.14) and rat duodenum neuronal (pIC50 value of 4.87) nicotinic receptors among receptor systems investigated, namely alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta 1-adrenoceptors, H1- and H2-histamine receptors, and muscular and neuronal nicotinic receptors.",

    "9": "To investigate the involvement of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) in heme metabolism, we examined the interaction of [55Fe]heme with PBR. Transfection of the cloned mouse PBR-isoquinoline carboxamide-binding protein (PBR/IBP) cDNA into monkey kidney Cos-1 cells resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in [55Fe]hemin binding sites, concomitant with the increase in [3H]PK11195 binding sites, as compared with those seen in antisense PBR/IBP cDNA-transfected cells. The binding of hemin to the transfected receptors exhibited a relatively high affinity with a Kd of 12 nM, and was inhibited by several benzodiazepine ligands, including PK11195, Ro 5-4864, diazepam and protoporphyrin IX. When mouse liver mitochondria were incubated with [55Fe]hemin, the binding to PBR had a Kd of 15 +/- 1.8 nM. The Bmax of [55Fe]hemin binding to the mitochondria was 6.88 +/- 0.76 pmol/mg of protein, a value consistent with that of [3H]PK11195 binding, with a lower affinity. Coproporphyrinogen III, a precursor porphyrin produced in the cytosol, is translocated into mitochondria, then is converted to protoporphyrinogen IX; this conversion decreased in the presence of benzodiazepine ligands. To examine whether this decrease was related to a decrease in the binding of coproporphyrinogen to the mitochondria, the effects of benzodiazepines on the binding of coproporphyrinogen were examined. As the binding was dose-dependently inhibited by PK11195, Ro 5-4864, and diazepam, porphyrins are likely to be endogenous ligands for PBR. We propose that PBR play a role in the intracellular transport of porphyrins and heme.",

The combination of a benzodiazepine with ketamine was thought to be beneficial to reduce the usual excitatory nervous effects after ket amine-anaesthesia. The results of the measured EEG-power spectra and somatosensory-evoked potentials were presented. Additionally, the central effects were correlated with mean arterial blood pressure and the results of blood gas analyzes.", 
    "11": "The sequence of muscarinic toxin 1 (MT1) from Dendroaspis angusticeps (green mamba) was determined (66 amino acids, M(r) 7509). The central part, peptide 25-40, is rich in hydrophobic amino acids, which is a characteristic of muscarinic toxins. MT1 started to inhibit [3H]-NMS (N-methylscopolamine) binding to synaptosomal membranes of porcine brain (contains all five receptor subtypes) at about 1 nM and to membranes from pig heart muscle (only subtype m2) at about 1 microM. Binding of [3H]-AF-DX 384 to heart was inhibited with an IC50 of 14 microM and to brain in two steps. In the first step (IC50 = 32 nM) binding decreased by 37%, indicating that the toxin acted on m1 or m4 receptors, each accounting for about 40% of total receptor content. The second step was similar to the effect on heart. Pirenzepine inhibited binding of [125I]-MT1 to brain receptors with an IC50 of 6.5 nM, corresponding to a Ki of about 6 nM. Literature values of Ki for pirenzepine are 16-18 nM for m1 and > or = 120 mM for other subtypes. This indicates binding to m1 receptors. mM for other subtypes. This indicates binding to m1 receptors. [125I]-MT1 bound to brain with a Kd of 20 nM and a Hill coefficient of 1.0, i.e. one toxin molecule per receptor. In guinea-pig ileum, MT1 (670 nM) produced a rapid contraction, reversible by atropine. The toxin may be an agonist, but might also cause contraction by inducing acetylcholine release by a different mechanism.", 
    "12": "The venom of some Dendroaspis snakes contains small proteins (7500 mol. wt) that inhibit the binding of radiolabelled muscarinic antagonist to brain synaptomal membranes. There were no peptides described among muscarinic ligands until Adem et al. (Biochim. biophys. Acta 968, 340-345, 1988) reported that muscarinic toxins (MTxs), MTx1 and 2 were able to inhibit 3H-QNB binding to rat brain membranes. Since MTxs inhibit around half of specific binding of 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate (3H-QNB) and 3H-N-methyl-scopolamine (3H-NMS), which do not discriminate between subtypes of muscarinic receptors, it has been proposed that MTxs might selectively bind to some subtype. MTx1 and 2 from Dendroaspis angusticeps almost completely inhibit the binding of 3H-pirenzepine (3H-PZ), a preferential M1 muscarinic receptor subtype ligand to cerebral cortex synaptosomal membranes. A much higher concentration was needed to inhibit partially 3H-PZ binding to atrial muscarinic receptors. These results support the hypothesis that MTx1 and 2 may be M1 selective muscarinic ligands. Similar activities have been found in Dendroaspis polylepis and D. viridis venoms, but with lower affinities. The Ki obtained from inhibition curves of the binding of 3H-PZ showed that MTx1 has higher affinity for the putative M1 muscarinic receptor subtype, followed by MTx2. DpMTx has lower affinity, while DvMTx seems to have the lowest affinity. All these peptides are devoid of anticholinesterase activity. Dendrotoxin and fasciculin from D. angusticeps venom do not inhibit the binding of muscarinic radioligands to cerebral cortex membranes. The injection of MTxs into dorsal hippocampus of rats immediately after training in an inhibitory avoidance task improves memory consolidation, as does oxotremorine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "The effects of diazepam and lorazepam on explicit memory and perceptual priming were studied 50, 130 and 300 min after drug administration. Sixty healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to one of five parallel groups (placebo, diazepam 0.2 or 0.3 mg/kg, lorazepam 0.026 or 0.038 mg/kg). The corresponding doses of benzodiazepines exerted a similar negative effect on explicit performance. Lorazepam markedly impaired priming performance, whereas the effect of diazepam was intermediate between that of placebo and that of lorazepam 0.038 mg/kg. The impairment was maximal at the theoretical peak plasma concentration. Contamination by explicit memory could account for the decrease in priming performance observed in the diazepam groups.", 
    "14": "Anticonvulsant drugs, such as carbamazepine, may exert some of their effects through peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR), which are present in glial cells and regulate the synthesis of neurosteroids. PBR have also been demonstrated in human lymphocytes, where they might be used as peripheral markers of anticonvulsant drug effects. In the present paper we investigated the interaction of various antiepileptic drugs with PBR of human lymphocytes and evaluated possible effects of acute and chronic treatment with these drugs. At normal therapeutic concentrations, diazepam, carbamazepine and phenobarbital occupy respectively 70, 30 and 10% of PBR sites in human lymphocytes. Although no change of receptor density or affinity was observed after acute in vitro treatment, in epileptic patients chronically treated with carbamazepine, phenobarbital and valproic acid, PBR Bmax was increased with respect to controls and untreated epileptics. Since PBR of human lymphocytes may be affected by anticonvulsant drug treatment, we suggest that they might be involved in the immunological alterations reported in these patients and might be used as peripheral markers of drug effects on the central nervous system.", 
    "15": "The protection provided by ketamine against the neuronal cytotoxicity of NMDA was investigated and compared with that provided by dizocilpine (MK 801). A massive anaesthetic dose of ketamine (180 mg/kg) was required for substantial protection (about 70%) of rat dorsal hippocampal neurons. Protection was markedly decreased if the ketamine was given in three divided doses of 60 mg/kg over a period of 2 hr, rather than as a bolus injection of 180 mg/kg. A lower dose (60 mg/kg i.p.) gave no protection when given 10 min prior to NMDA, but some protection (up to 30%) was found when administration was delayed for 1-2 hr. After 3 hr, ketamine at this dose did not protect. In comparison, the toxicity of NMDA was reduced by about 70% by prior treatment with dizocilpine at 1 mg/kg, and completely eliminated at 10 mg/kg. The lack of protection when ketamine at 60 mg/kg was administered prior to NMDA may be due to a proconvulsant action of ketamine, as diazepam in the presence but not in the absence of ketamine significantly reduced the toxicity of NMDA. However, there was no behavioural or histological evidence of increased seizure activity in the presence of ketamine. Neuroprotectant effects may prevail with massive anaesthetic doses of ketamine or when diffusion has reduced the concentration of NMDA. The heroic doses of ketamine required for protection diminish its attractiveness as a potential anti-ischaemic agent.", 
    "16": "The effect of a new cholecystokinin (CCK)-A receptor antagonist, FK480, developed in Japan, on pancreatic exocrine secretion stimulated by exogenous CCK and intraduodenal casein was investigated in vivo when administered to anesthetized rats intraduodenally, and its CCK antagonistic activity was compared with that of CR 1505. Intraduodenal administration of FK480 at graded doses of 0.0016-1.0 mg/kg-h produced dose-dependent inhibition of pancreatic juice volume and amylase output stimulated by intravenous infusion of CCK-8 at a dose of 0.06 micrograms/kg-h. The half-maximal inhibitory dose (ID50) of FK480 for CCK-8-stimulated amylase secretion was 0.025 mg/kg-h, whereas the ID50 of CR 1505 was 5.2 mg/kg-h, indicating that FK480 is 208 times more potent than CR 1505. Moreover, intraduodenal FK480 (0.2 mg/kg-h) significantly suppressed pancreatic juice volume and amylase output augmented by intraduodenal infusion of casein (400 mg/h). It is concluded that FK480 administered intraduodenally has a significant, potent inhibitory action on the exocrine pancreas stimulated by exogenous CCK and intraduodenal casein.", 
    "17": "We studied the effects of a high-affinity gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine-receptor agonist (lorazepam) and an antagonist (flumazenil) in humans, using H2(15)O positron-emission tomography. Administration of lorazepam to healthy volunteers caused time- and dose-dependent reductions in regional cerebral blood flow and self-reported alterations in behavioral/mood parameters. Flumazenil administration reversed these changes. These observations indicated that benzodiazepine-induced effects on regional cerebral blood flow and mood/behavior are mediated at some level through GABA-benzodiazepine receptors, although the specific mechanism remains unclear. The approach described here provides a method for quantifying GABA-benzodiazepine-receptor-mediated neurotransmission in the living human brain and may be useful for studying the role of these receptors in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders.", 
    "18": "Diazepam inhibits morphine tolerance and dependence and reverses a decrease in the met-enkephalin level in brain induced by morphine. In this study, we investigated whether inhibition of morphine-induced tolerance and dependence by diazepam involved a change in cyclic AMP levels in discrete rat brain regions and spinal cord. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were made tolerant and dependent by subcutaneous (s.c.) implantation of six morphine pellets (two pellets on the first day, and four on the second day). Diazepam (0.25 mg/kg b. wt) was injected once daily intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 5 days. Control rats were implanted with placebo pellets and injected once daily with saline or diazepam (i.p.). Tail-flick antinociception was measured 1 h after injections everyday. Animals were administered s.c. naloxone (10 mg/kg) to induce naloxone-precipitated withdrawal syndrome on the final day of the experiment (day 5), and the jumping behavior was observed for 30 min. Concomitant treatment with diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) significantly decreased the development of morphine tolerance and dependence. Diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) treated rats also showed a significant decrease in the jumping behavior compared to animals treated with morphine alone. Rats were sacrificed 2 h after the injection of saline or diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) on the fifth day. Cyclic AMP was estimated by RIA. In the control rats, the concentration of cyclic AMP in cortex was > hippocampus > cerebellum > hypothalamus > striatum > midbrain > pituitary > pons/medulla > spinal cord. There was no change in the concentration of cyclic AMP in any of the brain regions examined from morphine tolerant animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "The effect of diazepam and specific ligands of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) on growth factor-induced DNA synthesis in quiescent cultures of rat astrocytes has been examined. It was found that diazepam inhibited the ability of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation; the IC50 was approximately 5 microM. Ro5-4864, a specific agonist of PBRs, also blocked bFGF-induced DNA synthesis. PK11195, which in some cases functions as an antagonist of PBRs, did not prevent the effect of Ro5-4864 on bFGF-induced DNA synthesis; rather, addition of PK11195 also inhibited bFGF-induced DNA synthesis. In addition, diazepam reduced the stimulation of DNA synthesis caused by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), polypeptide growth factors coupled to receptor tyrosine kinases, as well as thrombin, an activator of G protein-coupled receptors. These data suggest that ligands of PBRs may limit astrocyte mitosis, a phenomenon that occurs following CNS injury.", 
    "20": "Mitochondria isolated from rat brain were found to cleave cholesterol to produce pregnenolone, the precursor for hormonal steroids, at a mean rate of 21.0 pmol pregnenolone.mg protein-1.min-1. This rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis was significantly stimulated by PK 11195 (1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide) and Ro5 4864 (4'-chlorodiazepam), ligands which bind to peripheral benzodiazepine receptors with high affinity. Low-affinity ligands for the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor such as Ro15 1788 (ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5 alpha][1,4] benzo-3-carboxylate) and clonazepam had no significant effect on the rate of pregnenolone synthesis. Furthermore, the rank order of potency of these compounds as inhibitors of [3H]Ro5 4864 binding was identical to the rank order for steroid production. Since the 86-amino acid peptide diazepam binding inhibitor is also thought to bind to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, four fragments of this peptide, a random sequence and steroidogenesis activator peptide were also evaluated for their ability to interact with peripheral benzodiazepine receptors and to stimulate steroidogenesis in rat brain mitochondria. Steroidogenesis activator peptide and two fragments of diazepam binding inhibitor significantly stimulated pregnenolone biosynthesis. In contrast to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands, no correlation between peptide potency in displacing [3H]Ro5 4864 binding and steroidogenesis was observed.",

    "22": "We assessed potential risk factors, including bone mass, in 9516 white women 65 years of age or older who had had no previous hip fracture. We then followed these women at 4-month intervals for an average of 4.1 years to determine the frequency of hip fracture. All reports of hip fractures were validated by review of x-ray films.", 
    "23": "During the follow-up period, 192 women had first hip fractures not due to motor vehicle accidents. In multivariable age-adjusted analyses, a maternal history of hip fracture doubled the risk of hip fracture (relative risk, 2.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 2.9), and the increase in risk remained significant after adjustment for bone density. Women who had gained weight since the age of 25 had a lower risk. The risk was higher among women who had previous fractures of any type after the age of 50, were tall at the age of 25, rated their own health as fair or poor, had previous hyperthyroidism, had been treated with long-acting benzodiazepines or anticonvulsant drugs, ingested greater amounts of caffeine, or spent four hours a day or less on their feet. Examination findings associated with an increased risk included the inability to rise from a chair without using one's arms, poor depth perception, poor contrast sensitivity, and tachycardia at rest. Low calcaneal bone density was also an independent risk factor. The incidence of hip fracture ranged from 1.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.5 to 1.6) per 1,000 woman-years among women with no more than two risk factors and normal calcaneal bone density for their age to 27 (95 percent confidence interval, 20 to 34) per 1,000 woman-years among those with five or more risk factors and bone density in the lowest third for their age.", 
    "24": "Women with multiple risk factors and low bone density have an especially high risk of hip fracture. Maintaining body weight, walking for exercise, avoiding long-acting benzodiazepines, minimizing caffeine intake, and treating impaired visual function are among the steps that may decrease the risk.", 
    "25": "BZA-5B, a benzodiazepine peptidomimetic, inhibits CAAX farnesyltransferase (FTase) and blocks attachment of farnesyl groups to oncogenic and wild-type H-Ras in animal cells. This compound slows the growth of cells transformed with oncogenic H-Ras at concentrations that do not affect the growth of nontransformed cells. This finding suggested that nontransformed cells may produce a form of Ras whose prenylation is resistant to BZA-5B. In the current studies, we found that FTase had a 50-fold higher affinity for K-RasB than for H-Ras in vitro. Farnesylation of K-RasB was inhibited by BZA-2B, the active form of BZA-5B, but only at concentrations that were 8-fold higher than those that inhibited farnesylation of H-Ras. K-RasB, but not H-Ras, was also a substrate for CAAX geranylgeranyltransferase-1 (GGTase-1), and its affinity for the enzyme was equal to that of Rap1B, an authentic leucine-terminated substrate for GGTase-1. Inhibition of the geranylgeranylation of K-RasB occurred only at high concentrations of BZA-2B. All of these properties of K-RasB were traced to the combined effects of its COOH-terminal CVIM sequence and the adjacent polylysine sequence, neither of which is present in H-Ras. These studies provide a potential explanation for the resistance of nontransformed cells to growth inhibition by BZA-5B. Inasmuch as the majority of Ras-related human cancers contain oncogenic versions of K-RasB rather than H-Ras, the current data suggest that in vitro studies of FTase inhibitors with potential anti-cancer activity should use authentic K-RasB as a substrate.", 
    "26": "Using computer-aided conformational analysis, based on molecular dynamics simulation, cluster analysis, and Monte Carlo techniques, we have designed and synthesized compounds in which a benzyloxy substituent has been incorporated into a series of pyrazoloquinoline benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) ligands. Earlier studies had shown that the benzyloxy group could act as part of the agonist pharmacophoric determinant in the beta-carboline ring system. Furthermore, the agonist beta-carboline had been correlated with a binding site orientation and volume fit for an agonist 6-phenylimidazobenzodiazepine carboxylate. The present study was undertaken to determine whether the benzyloxy substituent could be used as an agonist pharmacophoric descriptor for the phenylpyrazolo[4,3-c]quinolin-3-one BZR ligands. The results of a determination of GABA shift ratios for the synthetic ligands indicate that 8-(benzyloxy)-2-phenylpyrazolo[4,3-c]quinolin-3-one can be predicted to be an agonist at the BZR.",

Interventions for shifting the sympathovagal balance toward vagal dominance are now of increased clinical interest. Intravenous pirenzepine increases RR interval variability in normal volunteers, a finding that could have therapeutic implications if confirmed in postinfarction patients after oral administration of the drug.", 
    "29": "In a single-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial, short-term RR interval variability and baroreceptor reflex sensitivity were evaluated in 20 patients an average of 19 +/- 6 days after infarction.

    "32": "Specific endogenous [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites were identified and characterized in membranes from the human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line 293. A large part of these binding sites exhibited an intermediate affinity for [3H]flunitrazepam and a microM affinity for diazepam, clonazepam, 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxam ide (PK 11195) or 4'-chlorodiazepam (Ro 5-4864). These sites, thus, resembled neither gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor associated nor 'peripheral' benzodiazepine binding sites. A small part of the binding sites labeled by [3H]flunitrazepam seemed to belong to 'peripheral' benzodiazepine binding sites exhibiting a nM affinity for PK 11195, and another small part of the binding sites seemed to exhibit a high affinity for flunitrazepam and PK 11195. Although small amounts of mRNA for alpha 1-, beta 3- and gamma 2-subunits of GABAA receptors could be identified in HEK 293 cells, neither the actual expression of GABAA receptors in these cells nor a coassembly of endogenous subunits with transfected GABAA receptor subunits could be demonstrated by binding studies.", 
    "33": "In this study, we examined the effect of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) injection of melatonin and/or ACTH1-10 and ACTH4-10 on [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites in the cerebral cortex of hypophysectomized rats. Hypophysectomy increased the Bmax (maximum number of binding sites) of benzodiazepine (BNZ) receptors for at least 7 days after surgery, without changing KD (dissociation constant). The i.c.v. injection of melatonin to hypophysectomized rats significantly increased Bmax, whereas the same doses of melatonin were ineffective in sham-operated animals. In both cases, KD values were unchanged. The i.c.v. injection of ACTH1-10 to hypophysectomized animals significantly increased Bmax, an effect that was enhanced by simultaneous i.c.v. injection of ACTH1-10 + melatonin, reaching higher values of Bmax than the i.c.v. injection of these hormones individually. No significant changes in KD values were found after ACTH1-10 and/or melatonin administration. However, the i.c.v. injection of ACTH4-10 to hypophysectomized rats did not change Bmax, although it significantly increased KD values, indicating a decrease in the BNZ binding affinity. Melatonin injection counteracted this effect of ACTH4-10, returning KD to the control value. Moreover, although the lower dose of i.c.v. melatonin used, 10 ng, was unable to modify Bmax of BNZ binding in the ACTH4-10-injected group, the higher dose, 20 ng, significantly increased Bmax. The results suggest that these ACTH-derived peptides can modulate the effect of melatonin on brain benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "34": "For a period of one year all suicides in Aarhus police district were investigated with a view to identifying the presence of alcohol or drugs in the body of the deceased. Fifty-one suicides occurred, 46 of which were examined. One third of the suicides were due to poisoning and one fourth to hanging. Alcohol was detected in 20% and drugs or narcotics were found in approximately 60%. The most frequent findings were benzodiazepines, analgetics, antidepressants and carbon monoxide. Approximately 40% of the deceased had received psychiatric treatment.", 
    "35": "The effect of brief inhalation of carbon dioxide (CO2) was studied in a conflict situation (Vogel test) in the rat. This treatment, which inhibits gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated transmission in rat brain and induces anxiety and panic attacks in humans, elicited a proconflict effect. Exposure of rats for 1 min to CO2 decreased by approximately 40% the number of licking periods in the test. This effect was abolished by prior administration of alprazolam (0.5 mg per kilogram of body mass, i.p.). Although these results may support a role for GABA-mediated transmission in the anxiogenic effect of CO2 inhalation, the possibility that different neurotransmitters other than GABA are involved in the action of CO2 can not be ruled out.",

A mixture of chloroform and ethyl acetate (80:20) was used to extract the two compounds. A 2-microliters volume of the reconstituted sample was injected using a 1:20 split injection mode. Intra-day coefficients of variation ranged from 2 to 6.9%. The assay was linear over the range 3-1000 ng/ml. This assay was subsequently used to analyze samples from a human pharmacokinetic study.",

An achiral (amino) column and a chiral (Chiralcel OD-H) column were used. The results suggest that achiral and chiral packed-column supercritical fluid chromatography gives a shorter analysis time and higher selectivity and efficiency than achiral and chiral stationary-phase high-performance liquid chromatography in the analysis of camazepam and its derivatives.", 
    "38": "The authors investigated the effects of spinal and supraspinal administration of the benzodiazepine receptor agonist midazolam alone and with opioids on tests of nociception (tail-flick and hot-plate tests) and motor function (catalepsy) in rats. At the spinal level, the dose-response curves for peak effect and area under the curve for morphine were shifted to the left (indicating potentiation) by a submaximal dose of intrathecal (i.t.) midazolam (20 micrograms) in both nociceptive tests. Additionally, 2.5 micrograms of i.t. midazolam, a dose having no effect when given alone, increased antinociception in both tests when given with i.t. morphine. Isobolographic analysis confirmed that i.t. injection of midazolam potentiated antinociception induced by i.t. morphine. At the supraspinal level, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of 4 micrograms of midazolam inhibited morphine antinociception, i.e., the dose-response curve for morphine in the hot-plate test shifted to the right. Midazolam did not affect morphine antinociception in the tail-flick test. Catalepsy occurred only when the highest doses of i.t. or i.c.v. morphine or midazolam were injected alone. The differing effect of midazolam on morphine-induced antinociception suggests that different mechanisms are involved in the spinal cord and brain.", 
    "39": "In previous papers, we have described the discovery of a new series of compounds, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-5-methylimidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]benzodiazepin-2(1 H)- ones, TlBO (1 and 1a), with potent anti-HIV-1 activity and the synthesis of analogues to better define the structure-activity relationships (SAR) in terms of changes in substituents at the N-6 position and variations of the five-membered urea ring as well as the seven-membered diazepine ring. This paper describes the synthesis of TlBO analogues with various substitutents on the aromatic ring and their SAR in terms of anti-HIV-1 properties. Substituents on the 8-position furnished the most rewarding results and gave a large improvement in potency versus the parent compound. These included halogen, thiomethyl, and methyl. Analogues like 8-cyano, -methoxy, and -acetylene were equipotent, while 8-amino, -acetylamino, -dimethylamino, and -nitro were inactive (Table 1). Substituents at the 9-position tended to have little effect on activity, and 10-substituents decreased activity. The 8-chloro compound 6a with IC50 = 0.0043 microM is currently under clinical development.", 
    "40": "4,5,6,7-Tetrahydro-5-methylimidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]benzodiazepin-2 (1H)-ones (TIBO), 1, have been shown to significantly inhibit HIV-1 replication in vitro by interfering with the virus's reverse transcriptase enzyme. They have also demonstrated potential clinical efficacy in combating HIV-1, on the basis of a preliminary study. Our prior publications have discussed the discovery of this series of compounds and reported some preliminary chemical and biological studies around N-6 substitutions and 5-membered ring variations of 1. This manuscript describes our synthetic endeavors around 4, 5, and 7 mono- and disubstitutions of 1 and discusses related HIV-1 inhibitory structure-activity relationships. On the basis of inhibition of HIV-1's cytopathic effects in MT-4 cells, we found that 5-mono-Me-substituted analogues, the original substitution in the early lead compounds, and 7-mono-Me-substituted analogues of 1 were comparable as being consistently the most active compounds. Although generally less active, the 4,5,7-unsubstituted, 4-mono-substituted, cis- and trans-5,7-di-Me-substituted, and cis-4,5-di-Me-substituted analogues of 1 also exhibited some significant desired activity. The remaining trans-4,5-di-Me-substituted, cis- and trans-4,7-di-Me-substituted, and all 4,5-, 5,6-, 6,7-, and 7,8-fused disubstituted analogues of 1 possessed no noticeable desired activity.", 
    "41": "The enantioselectivity of bovine serum albumin (BSA)-bonded columns produced with isolated protein fragments was investigated. The BSA fragment BSA-FG75 was isolated by size-exclusion chromatography followed by peptic digestion of BSA. The isolated BSA-FG75 was a mixture of three peptides, and was mainly an N-terminal half peptide(s) with an average molecular mass of about 35,000. The BSA and BSA-FG75 proteins were bound to aminopropylsilica gels activated by N,N'-disuccinimidyl carbonate. The amounts of the proteins bound were about 2 and 5.5 mumol/g for the BSA and BSA-FG75, respectively. Chiral recognition of 2-arylpropionic acid derivatives, benzodiazepines, warfarin and benzoin was obtained with the BSA-FG75-bonded columns, but no chiral recognition of tryptophan or kynurenine was obtained. The intact BSA column gave a higher enantioselectivity than the BSA-FG75 column for most of the compounds tested, whereas the BSA-FG75 column gave a higher enantioselectivity than the intact BSA column for lorazepam and benzoin, and had a higher capacity for benzoin. These results are due to a higher density of chiral recognition site(s) on the BSA-FG75 column. Also, the BSA-FG75 column was as stable as the intact BSA column for a continuous flow of eluent.", 
    "42": "An in vitro neonatal rat preparation, consisting of the isolated caudal brainstem and stomach joined by the intact vagi, was developed using Sprague-Dawley rats. The animals were 0 to 4 days of age. This preparation provided an opportunity to investigate the extracellular and intracellular responses of neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) of the brainstem to electrical stimulation of subdiaphragmatic vagal fibers. The dorsal and ventral vagal branches were electrically stimulated at the point of the common subdiaphragmatic vagal trunk. The isolated preparation was superfused in a recording chamber at 28 degrees C with a modified Krebs solution, equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Suction microelectrodes, for electrical stimulation, were positioned on the common vagal trunk just below the diaphragm to evaluate extracellular and intracellular evoked responses in NTS. A total of 204 subdiaphragmatic vagally-evoked (SDVe) brainstem unitary responses in the NTS were recorded. The mean latency of the extracellular SDVe brainstem responses was 89 +/- 12.9 ms (mean +/- SD). The peripheral gastric effects of CCK-8 on SDVe unitary responses in NTS neurons were evaluated. The peptide caused a significant increase in the excitability of these NTS neurons which was blocked by the CCKA receptor antagonist L-364,718. Neurons in the NTS and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus which showed excitatory responses to vagal stimulation were filled with Lucifer Yellow to evaluate their morphology.", 
    "43": "DN-2327 (pazinaclone) is a new non-benzodiazepine compound which has high affinity for benzodiazepine receptors. The acute behavioral effects and abuse liability of DN-2327 (2, 4 and 8mg) were compared to those of the benzodiazepine anxiolytic alprazolam (0.25, 0.5 and 1mg) in ten normal adult male volunteers using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, outpatient design. For both drugs, the neck effect occurred approximately 1.5h after drug administration. Both drugs also produced comparable dose-related effects on several measures related to sedation, as well as on subject- and observer-rated strength of drug effect. Both alprazolam and DN-2327 produced dose-related impairments on various performance measures; on some tasks, the impairment was greater for DN-2327. In contrast, there were no differences between DN-2327 and alprazolam on observer-rated measures. Although no measures of drug-taking were made in this study, to the extent that self-reported effects predict reinforcing effects, the data suggest little liability for abuse of the two compounds in this subject population. Ratings of 'drug liking' and 'willing to take the drug again' were not increased following alprazolam. Although DN-2327 did not increase ratings of 'willing to take the drug again', DN-2327 did produce small but significant increases on ratings of 'drug liking'. Overall, these results suggest that the non-benzodiazepine DN-2327 has a pharmacological profile that is similar to that of benzodiazepines.", 
    "44": "In recent years a number of novel compounds have been described with affinity and specificity for BZ (omega) receptors. While some of these agents appear to act, like benzodiazepines themselves, as full agonists at different receptor subtypes (e.g. suriclone), several non-selective partial agonists (e.g. bretazenil) have been described, as have a number of BZ(1) (omega(1)) selective drugs (e.g. zolpidem). Previous work has reported a number of differences between the behavioural effects of some of these drugs and those of benzodiazepines; however, very few studies have attempted systematic comparisons of a large number of drugs in different procedures. In the present study a wide range of BZ (omega) receptor ligands was studied using two behavioural methods in rats: unpunished and punished food-reinforced operant responding and the discriminative stimulus effects of pentylenetetrazole. Punished operant responding showed increases with the benzodiazepines, chlordiazepoxide and clorazepate, the non-benzodiazepines, saripidem, CL 273,547 and F 2692 (limited effect at a single dose) and the partial agonists bretazenil and Ro 19-8022, but the BZ(1) selective agents, alpidem, abecarnil and CL 284,846, did not increase rates of punished operant responding. Rates of unpunished responding were decreased by higher doses of all drugs except bretazenil and Ro 19-8022. Dose-related antagonism of the pentylenetetrazole (18mg/kg) discriminative stimulus was produced by several benzodiazepines, by the partial agonists bretazenil, Ro 19-8022 and divaplon, and by suriclone, saripidem and CL 273,547. The BZ(1) (omega(1)) selective drugs abecarnil, CL 284,846, zolpidem, CL 218,872 and alpidem were also active in blocking pentylenetetrazole but produced only partial antagonism which was not clearly dose-related. The results show that novel BZ (omega) receptor ligands do not always produce a behavioural profile identical to that shown by benzodiazepines. In particular, BZ(1) (omega(1)) selective drugs do not give rise to clear increases in punished operant responding and have only limited efficacy in blocking the pentylenetetrazole cue. These effects may be due to the marked propensity of BZ(1) (omega(1)) selective drugs to decrease operant response rates.", 
    "45": "Based on the studies made in 84 patients with calculous cholecystitis and 12 patients with calcifying pancreatitis, an efficiency was shown of infusional administration of pyrencepine or ranitidine to prevent stress postoperative erosive-and-ulcerous lesions of gastroduodenal zone. Gastrocepine is shown to be superior to ranitidine and can be withdrawn without a maintenance dose, as well as becouse its cytoprotective effects with respect of the gastric and duodenal mucosa.", 
    "46": "A case is described of a patient with limb shaking in whom anticonvulsant therapy was effective for inhibiting attacks. A 70 year old female developed rhythmical involuntary limb shaking of the right upper and lower limb in April 1986. She was diagnosed as having transient ischemic attacks and was followed up under treatment with an antiplatelet drug. Subsequently, anticonvulsant therapy was also initiated on an outpatient basis. In August 1991, she was admitted with shaking of the right upper and lower limbs. Low molecular dextran was ineffective for inhibiting limb shaking attacks, but intravenous injection of diazepam was effective. Phenytoin and phenobarbital was used in combination. No limb shaking attacks occurred thereafter. The involuntary movement was the same as that observed at the onset of the disease. Though no changes were observed in the pattern of the involuntary movement, anticonvulsant therapy was effective in preventing and inhibiting attacks. This finding is inconsistent with previous reports. It is possible that epileptic factors are involved in the development of this condition.", 
    "47": "Chronic mood disorder patients who remain frequent and long-term users of psychiatric facilities constitute a major clinical concern today. A 2 year naturalistic prospective follow-up study was conducted on a cohort (n = 40) randomly extracted out of 335 such patients. Longitudinal data involving semi-structured interviews, observer-rated scales and self-report measures were available for 37 patients (93%). While three (8%) remitted completely, the cohort on the average showed no statistically significant change in the severity of depression, social adjustment or global functions during the 2 years under observation. Two baseline features that characterized ameliorated patients were the absence of panic disorder and lower level of education.", 
    "48": "Cholecystokinin is a gastrointestinal hormone known to physiologically regulate pancreatic protein secretion and gallbladder contractility. Some evidence suggests that cholecystokinin is also involved in the maintenance of gastrointestinal mucosal integrity. This study was undertaken to ascertain whether cholecystokinin could prevent the gastric mucosal injury induced by acidified ethanol and what role prostaglandins, and type A and type B cholecystokinin receptors might play in this process. Conscious, fasted rats were given subcutaneous saline or cholecystokinin octapeptide (10-100 micrograms/kg) 30 min before a 1-ml oral gastric bolus of acidified ethanol (150 mM HCl/50% ethanol). Five minutes later, rats were sacrificed and the total area of macroscopic injury quantitated (square millimeters). In additional experiments using a similar protocol, 1 ml of either the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (5 mg/kg), a type A cholecystokinin receptor antagonist, L-364,718 (0.01-1 mg/kg), or the type B cholecystokinin receptor antagonist, L-365,260 (12.5-25 mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally 30 min prior to pretreatment with cholecystokinin octapeptide. Cholecystokinin octapeptide dose-dependently prevented mucosal injury from acidified ethanol (corroborated by histology). The protective effect of cholecystokinin octapeptide was completely negated by L-364,718 and partially reversed by indomethacin, while L-365,260 had no discernible effect in this process. In a further study, cholecystokinin was unable to prevent the damaging effects of aspirin and the inhibition of endogenous prostaglandins. This, it appears that cholecystokinin is able to maintain mucosal integrity in the face of a damaging insult by activation of type A cholecystokinin receptors, an effect mediated, at least in part, through the release of endogenous prostaglandins.", 
    "49": "Changes in GABAergic systems have been widely documented during development. Similar changes might also occur during aging, but little information is currently available. Whole-cell and single-channel GABAA-activated currents were studied in acutely dissociated basal forebrain neurons. An age-related increase in whole-cell GABA currents was observed in cells from aged (19-25 month) Fischer 344 rats. The GABA current from aged animals displayed a greater maximum response, with no change in EC50 or slope of the GABA response curve. A reduction in use-dependent slow receptor desensitization was also observed in aged cells. Single-channel conductance and channel open time were unchanged with age, suggesting no alteration in the properties of single GABA channels. The benzodiazepine, midazolam, potentiated GABA currents to a greater degree in aged animals, consistent with previous reports of enhanced benzodiazepine activity with age. Ontogeny of the GABAA receptor/ion channel complex may continue through the stages of development, maturation, and aging.", 
    "50": "The safety and efficacy of intravenous sedation with both a narcotic and a benzodiazepine were evaluated in 104 consecutive children who had closed reduction of a fracture. Six patients had a subsequent additional reduction with intravenous sedation, so the study involved a total of 110 procedures. The average dose of meperidine was 1.47 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, and the average dose of midazolam was 0.11 milligram per kilogram of body weight. The interval between induction of the sedation and performance of the procedure averaged ten minutes, and the total duration of the procedure averaged thirty-nine minutes. There were no episodes of apnea or cardiorespiratory complications. Ninety-six (92 percent) of the initial 104 reductions were successful. Only four patients subsequently needed general anesthesia for a repeat closed reduction. The physician's satisfaction with the method of sedation was good or excellent for 103 (94 per cent) of the 110 procedures. Eighty-one (93 per cent) of eighty-seven patients who were able to respond had no memory of the reduction. A telephone survey conducted after the procedure revealed that eighty-four (98 per cent) of eighty-six parents who responded were satisfied with the method of sedation. Intravenous sedation with a narcotic and a benzodiazepine proved to be a safe and effective method of anesthesia for the closed reduction of fractures in children in our series. Careful monitoring of the patient after sedation is imperative.", 
    "51": "This article discusses the use of an algorithm developed by nurses at the University of Minnesota Hospital and Clinic in Minneapolis, that can be used to distinguish the need for sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic agents for patients in the medical intensive care unit (MICU). Many problems associated with patient sedation and analgesia exist within the critical care environment. These problems include undersedating patients with neuromuscular blockade; rapidly tapering or abruptly discontinuing high-dosage sedation, which often results in withdrawal symptoms; over-use of high-dosage continuous intravenous infusions of short-acting benzodiazepines and analgesics; failure to recognize delirium; and resistance to modifying drug regimens when patient outcomes are not satisfactory.", 
    "52": "We present our experience with pentobarbital for sedation during mechanical ventilation in six infants when fentanyl and midazolam failed. The patients ranged in age from 2 to 17 months and in weight from 3.0 to 11.4 kg. Before the switch to pentobarbital, the maximum doses of fentanyl ranged from 7 to 13 micrograms/kg/hr and the midazolam infusions, from 0.2 to 0.4 mg/kg/hr. Pentobarbital was administered as a bolus dose followed by a continuous infusion. The hourly infusion rates ranged from 1 to 4 mg/kg. Adequate sedation was achieved in all six patients. In the four patients who required neuromuscular blocking agents, their use was discontinued after pentobarbital was given. The antihypertensive agents (diazoxide and nitroprusside) required by the two patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were also discontinued after pentobarbital administration. Although we continue to use fentanyl and benzodiazepines as first-line drugs for sedation, pentobarbital may be an effective alternative when these agents fail.",

Under these circumstances, work group norms consistently take precedence and thus, serve to shape nurses' behaviors.", 
    "54": "Alprazolam, a benzodiazepine derivative, stimulates specific gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptors and has been found to inhibit CRH activity in the brain. This study examined the effect of alprazolam on serum cortisol and LH pulsatility in six women in the early follicular phase (EFP), six women in the midluteal phase (MLP), and six women with stress-related anovulation (SRA) of normal weight, but with a previous history of anorexia nervosa. Subjects were given alprazolam (2 mg, orally) or an identical placebo capsule at 0900 h, and blood samples were collected through an indwelling venous catheter every 10 min for 8 h in the SRA women and 10 h in EFP and MLP women. Women with SRA were also given clomiphene (100 mg/day) for 5 days before a further 8-h blood sampling session. As expected, there was a diurnal decline in serum levels of cortisol, which was significantly less in women with SRA (55 +/- 4%) than those in both EFP (76 +/- 4%) and MLP women (75 +/- 3%; P < 0.005). The food-related rise of cortisol that follows lunch in normal women was absent in women with SRA. Alprazolam accentuated the decline in serum cortisol, and in all three groups, the mean serum cortisol level after alprazolam treatment was significantly less (P < 0.05) than that after placebo. In SRA women, alprazolam restored visible LH pulses in all women and increased the mean LH pulse frequency (P < 0.02) and pulse amplitude (P < 0.05). This was associated with an increase in mean serum LH from 1.3 +/- 0.3 to 3.0 +/- 0.06 IU/L (P < 0.02). In EFP women, alprazolam reduced the frequency of LH pulsatility from a mean of 5.8 +/- 0.7 to 3.2 +/- 0.5 pulses/10 h (P < 0.02) and increased the mean pulse amplitude from 2.4 +/- 0.5 to 5.0 +/- 1.1 IU/L (P < 0.0005). Alprazolam had no significant effect on LH pulsatility or amplitude in MLP women. To explain this variation in response to alprazolam, we propose that alprazolam accelerates the GnRH pacemaker in SRA women by inhibiting excessive CRH activity, which blocks the GnRH pacemaker in these women. In normal women, we hypothesize that tonic inhibition of the GnRH pacemaker by CRH is minimal, and the reduced pulsatility of LH after alprazolam treatment in EFP women results from inhibition of stimulatory noradrenergic neurons. In MLP women, we propose that preexisting opioid inhibition of noradrenergic neurons by progesterone blocks this effect of alprazolam.",

Twenty-one (5.0%, 95% CI: 2.9-7.1%) patients developed delirium as defined by the DSM-IIIR criteria. Age and hypoxia were statistically significantly related to the development of delirium.

    "63": "Our previous studies revealed impairments in the ability of aged rats to detect brief, rarely and unpredictably occurring stimuli. The failure of these impairments to interact with the effects of benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) ligands was attributed to low demands on stimulus-related information processing. Thus, in the present experiment, rats of different ages were trained to detect visual stimuli that were flashing at 20 Hz, or were constantly illuminated, for 8, 3, or 5 sec. Additionally, selection of the correct lever to report detection required the processing of propositional rules (e.g., flashing-go left; constant-go right), i.e., the identification of the stimulus. All measures of performance varied with stimulus duration. Subsedative doses of the BZR agonist chlordiazepoxide (CDP; 3.13, 4.69 mg/kg), similar to the effects of the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (.025, 0.1 mg/kg), impaired response accuracy, increased the number of errors of omission and decreased response latencies. Animals aged 28 months omitted more trials following the administration of CDP than 12-month-old rats. Age did not produce main effects and did not interact with the effects of the drugs on response accuracy. It is speculated that, as stimuli had to be presented for relatively long periods of time (to maintain above chance-level discrimination performance), demands on detection remained too low to replicate previously documented effects of age. The demonstration of interactions between the effects of age and of BZR-ligands appears to depend on combined demands for stimulus detection and identification.",

Both sensory and affective components of the pain response were assessed, as there is some evidence that benzodiazepines reduce the affective component. Healthy volunteers (three females, nine males) were enrolled in a prospective, double-blind, randomized, cross-over trial in which mood and psychomotor performance were also examined. Five minutes and 135 min postinjection, subjects immersed their forearm in ice-cold water for 3 min while assessments of pain were recorded. During the first immersion, subjects reported significantly lower pain intensity and bothersomeness ratings after having been injected with fentanyl, relative to the saline and midazolam conditions, which did not differ significantly from each other. Fentanyl and midazolam had prototypical mood altering and psychomotor impairing effects. We conclude that midazolam in our laboratory setting at the doses and route of administration studied had no effects on either the sensory or affective components of the pain experience.",

A randomized prospective study of the cardiovascular and respiratory effects of different oral, nasal, and rectal premedication regimens was conducted. Fifty-eight young children (average age 2.7 yr) were studied. Oral meperidine (3 mg/kg) with pentobarbital (4 mg/kg) decreased heart rate, mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Stroke volume was maintained. Nasal ketamine (5 mg/kg) with midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) produced no significant cardiovascular or respiratory effects. Rectal methohexital (30 mg/kg) increased heart rate with a coincident decrease in stroke volume but had no other positive or negative cardiac or respiratory effect.

Hypothermic, nonpulsatile CPB and either opioid or ketamine-benzodiazepine anesthesia were common features of the operations. At least two vasoconstrictor infusions (phenylephrine, norepinephrine, or dopamine) were required for low perfusion pressure despite adequate cardiac output after CPB in 7.7% of 519 ACE-inhibited patients and 4.0% of 3782 patients not receiving ACE inhibitors (P = 0.0001). In the first 4 h after arrival in the intensive care unit, the need for vasoconstrictor infusions to treat hypotension with adequate cardiac output did not differ, although more ACE-inhibited patients (6.4%) exhibited low values of systemic vascular resistance (< 600 dyne.s.cm-5) than patients not receiving ACE inhibitors (2.8%; P = 0.0002). Logistic regression analysis identified preoperative ACE inhibitor use, congestive heart failure, poor left ventricular function, duration of CPB, reoperative surgery, age, and opioid anesthesia as independent risk factors for requiring > or = 2 vasoconstrictor infusions after CPB. No other preoperative drug therapy significantly altered this outcome.",

Eserine also stimulated the turnover of phosphoinositides in the embryonic but not in the mature retina. The effect of eserine could be blocked by atropine, suggesting that acetylcholine could be released from developing retina cells and further stimulate the turnover of InsPs in the embryonic tissue. Our data also show that muscarinic stimulation of turnover of 3H-InsPs could be blocked by stimulation of glutamatergic ionotropic receptors. Moreover, the effect of glutamate agonists did not seem to be mediated by the release of other neurotransmitters such as GABA, glycine, adenosine, or dopamine from the tissue because these neurotransmitters did not interfere with the retinal response to carbachol. These results suggest that muscarinic activation of phosphoinositide turnover occurs mainly in the embryonic retina and that activation of glutamate receptors can inhibit directly the muscarinic stimulation of hydrolysis of 3H-InsPs in this tissue.", 
    "74": "A kinetic method using a multiinjection protocol, positron emission tomography (PET), and [11C]flumazenil as a specific ligand was used to study in vivo the flumazenil-benzodiazepine receptor interactions in the human brain. The model structure is composed of three compartments (plasma, free, and bound ligand) and five parameters (including the benzodiazepine receptor concentration). The arterial plasma concentration, after correction for metabolites, was used as the input function. The experimental protocol, which consisted of three injections of labeled and/or unlabeled ligand, allowed the evaluation of the five model parameters in various brain regions from a single experiment. In particular, the concentration of receptor sites available for binding (B'max) and the equilibrium dissociation constant (KDVR, VR being the volume of reaction) were estimated in five brain regions, including the pons, in which these parameters are identified for the first time (B'max = 4.7 +/- 1.7 pmol/ml and KDVR = 4.4 +/- 1.3 pmol/ml). Due to the large range of measured receptor concentrations, a linear correlation between B'max and KDVR was pointed out (r = 0.88, p < 0.0005) and was interpreted as a linear relationship between B'max and VR, the parameter KD being assumed constant. This result and its concordance with the published data are discussed. Simulation of the usual two-experiment Scatchard analysis, using the pons as a reference region, showed that the bias on the receptor concentration estimates introduced by this method is significant (from 20 to 40%) but can be corrected using an estimate of the receptor concentration in the pons. Furthermore, we propose a new experimental protocol, based on a Scatchard analysis of the PET data obtained with a partial-saturation experiment. This single-injection protocol is entirely noninvasive, and thus the estimation of the benzodiazepine receptor concentration and of the flumazenil affinity is now possible in human patients using a single 1-h experiment without blood sampling.", 
    "75": "The validity of a patient-based scale, presumably measuring adverse effects of drugs on cognitive function, was examined in a normal volunteer study. Thirty subjects were randomly assigned to placebo or one of two doses of a benzodiazepine, temazepam (10 mg and 20 mg), in a double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group design. Plasma samples were taken before the scale was completed and up to 8 hours post-dose. After administration of the medication the subjects were asked to maintain their normal daily routine as much as possible (reading, studying, conversations). The inventory was administered twice, at 50 minutes and 2 hours post-dose (peak level). The overall score was different between the three groups, only for the second assessment, 2 h post-dose (ANOVA, P < 0.02). Multiple t-testing between the three groups revealed statistically significant differences between placebo and the 10 mg temazepam group (P = 0.02) and between placebo and the 20 mg temazepam group (P = 0.006). No significant difference was found between the two temazepam groups. Analysis of the separate questions showed least sensitivity for questions related to the domain of 'hyperexcitability' and most sensitivity for 'fatigue' and 'slowing.' The overall score appeared to be sensitive already for the lower toxicity range suggesting an 'all or nothing effect'. The subjective reports, collected by using this scale, may therefore be used for the detection of gross overall changes in cognitive functioning.", 
    "76": "The potential immunotoxic risk of perinatal treatment with diazepam was investigated using early postnatal administration of the drug to the rat and monitoring the immune response until the age of 24 months. Rats given a single dose of diazepam 10 mg/kg SC on the seventh postnatal day revealed at the age of 6 months a depression of cell-mediated immune response, and at the age of 12 months significant decrease of humoral immune response. The latter persisted until senescence (age 24 months). Also, a repeated dosage of diazepam (3 x 5 mg/kg/day SC on postnatal days 5 to 7) induced a significant depression of humoral immune response in 7-month-old rats. The results demonstrate that both the humoral and cell-mediated immune response of adult rats can be altered by administering diazepam in early postnatal life.", 
    "77": "Benzodiazepines, which are in extensive clinical use, can regulate neoplastic growth via benzodiazepine receptors. We have studied the expression of the diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) polypeptide, a putative endogenous ligand for benzodiazepine receptors in normal and pathological human brain. In normal brain, DBI immunoreactivity (IR) and mRNA were detected in all brain areas, with the highest levels in the cerebellum, amygdala, and hippocampus. In light and electron microscope immunohistochemistry, DBI-IR was only detected in glial and ependymal cells. In brain tumors, such as astrocytomas, glioblastomas and medulloblastomas, a much higher content of DBI-IR and -mRNA was found in normal tissues. The highest level of DBI expression was found in the most anaplastic tumors. DBI-IR was virtually undetectable in meningiomas and pituitary adenomas. The high expression of DBI in brain tumors might play a role in the neoplastic growth of glial cells via the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor, or it may be involved in the regulation of the high energy consumption of these tumors via acyl-CoA metabolism.", 
    "78": "The present study describes the use of nose-poke habituation as a memory task and demonstrates that it is sensitive to hypo- and hypermnestic pharmacological treatments administered post-trial. Habituation of nose-poke behavior of rats was defined as a reduction in number of nose-pokes compared to baseline. It was measured using a board with 16 holes, to which animals were exposed on 2 consecutive days (baseline and test) for 10 min, respectively. After the first exposure, rats were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) immediately or with a delay of 2.5 h with doses of diazepam (0.9-4.5 mg/kg) known to be hypomnestic, or cholecystokinin (CCK-8S; 0.2-25 micrograms/kg), which was reported to have memory facilitating effects. An enhancement of habituation in comparison with vehicle controls was interpreted in terms of a hypermnestic effect of the treatment. Conversely, hypomnestic action of the drug treatment was inferred from a reduced habituation. The results show that when diazepam was injected immediately post-trial, the normal reduction in number of nose-pokes during test was prevented, indicative of a failure to habituate presumably due to an amnesia for the baseline/training trial. In contrast, enhanced habituation (facilitation of memory) was induced when CCK-8S was injected immediately post-trial, as reflected by a decrease in number of nose-pokes during test compared to control animals. The effects were not due to enduring proactive effects of the compounds on performance during test, since post-trial injections of diazepam or CCK-8S with a delay of 2.5 h did not have the effects that immediate post-trial injection had.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

First, a focal slowing of the EEG in the left temporal area was noted and a corresponding reduction of the central BZ density of the left temporal lobe was found. After 2 months of treatment the patient was symptom-free, and a normal BZ receptor density and no pathological EEG signs were found.

It is important that the laboratory inform doctors of the range of substances detected and the sensitivity and specificity of laboratory assays. (4) Assays should be performed according to the manufacturer's protocols, or by modified methods that have been rigorously validated. Quality control samples should be included in each analytical run and participation in an external quality assessment scheme, e.g. UKNEQAS, is essential to provide independent confirmation and confidence that results compare with those from other laboratories.

    "89": "Use of illicit and licit drugs during pregnancy is a major public health concern, as it can have adverse effects on the developing fetus. Infants born of women addicted to narcotics, cocaine, alcohol, or polydrugs often undergo a characteristic withdrawal syndrome and may have physical, behavioral, and/or neurological abnormalities. As it is not feasible to ascertain whether these functional changes in human infants are produced by abused substance(s) per se or by a combination of complex socioeconomic factors and polydrug use, researchers in recent years have developed and utilized various innovative animal models to assess drug-induced alterations and their biological mechanisms during the developmental period under a controlled environment. To promote interdisciplinary communications as well as to assess the progress and the future needs in this area, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) held a technical review at which biomedical researchers discussed their current findings in various physiological systems.

    "92": "The structure of the benzodiazepine receptor is nowadays well established and its potentialisation of GABA neurotransmission is known as the main action mechanism of benzodiazepinic drugs. Three categories of ligands have been also identified with radically different effects: the agonists (like diazepam and other anxiolytics), the antagonists (like flumazenil) and the inverse agonists which are anxiogenic, pro-convulsant and alerting (like beta-carbolines). By analogy with opiates system, the existence of a possible endogenous ligand has been proposed, and if such a substance really exists, it could be an important biological support of anxiety regulation. Many compounds with benzodiazepine receptor affinity have been extracted from the brain, the cerebrospinal fluid and the urine of animals but also of humans. Among these, some are artefacts, like ethyl-beta-carbolin, or their affinity are to low to be physiologically relevant. N-desmethyl-diazepam has been purified from the brain of never treated humans, but probably comes from diet or gut bacteria. An important candidate is the DBI (Diazepam Binding Inhibitor), which displays inverse agonist activity and is present in human organism. Its role as a modulator of GABAergic transmission is questioned. Likewise, the intervention of endogenous agonist compounds is possible during acquisition tasks with stress or anxiety in animals. There are also reasonable arguments to involve an agonist (sedative) ligand in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. On the other hand, inverse agonists are not implicated in benzodiazepine withdrawal and panic disorder mechanisms. Lastly, probably indirect interactions between benzodiazepine receptor and cholecystokinin system are important to be considered, with possible consequences on anxiety regulations.", 
    "93": "1. Benzodiazepines potentiate morphine antinociception at the spinal level via GABAergic mechanisms. At the supraspinal level, the inhibitory effect of midazolam on morphine antinociception cannot be easily explained by GABAA receptor activation. Since excitatory amino acids play a role in central transmission, we investigated the effect of dizocilpine (MK 801) on this interaction in spinal cord and brain. 2. In rats with an intrathecal or intracerebroventricular catheter, the mechanisms of the antinociceptive effect of benzodiazepine-morphine combinations were tested during thermal nociceptive tests. 3. The principal findings of this study were that at the spinal level, midazolam potentiation of morphine antinociception can be antagonized by the NMDA antagonist, MK 801 (10 micrograms), as assessed by hot-plate and tail-flick tests. When drugs were administered supraspinally, midazolam inhibited morphine antinociception only in the hot-plate test, an effect also inhibited by MK 801. In the tail-flick assay, midazolam failed to influence the morphine response. 4. The NMDA antagonist significantly affected midazolam antinociception at the spinal level, but was not effective following i.c.v. administration of the drugs. MK 801 had no effect on morphine antinociception after i.t. and i.c.v. administration of the drugs. 5. The paradoxical effect of midazolam on morphine antinociception and its reversal by MK 801 might be due to modulation at various levels of the neuraxis and/or modulation of different pathways mediated via both GABAA and NMDA receptor mechanisms.", 
    "94": "1. We examined the effects of methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), a beta-carboline inverse agonist for the benzodiazepine site, on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced Cl-currents in several cloned rat GABAA receptor subtypes expressed in human embryonic kidney cells. The Cl- currents were measured in the whole cell configuration of patch clamp techniques. 2. DMCM at low concentrations (< 0.5 microM) occupying only the benzodiazepine site decreased GABA-induced Cl currents in the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 and alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 2 subtypes as expected from an inverse agonist, but produced no change in the alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 subtype (perhaps a neutral antagonist). The drug at higher concentrations (> 0.5 microM) enhanced Cl- currents in all the subtypes with a half maximal concentration of 6 to 20 microM, depending on the alpha isoform. In the alpha 1 beta 2 subtype, which is without the benzodiazepine site, DMCM monophasically increased Cl- currents with a half maximal concentration of 1.9 microM. 3. Ro 15-1788 (a classical benzodiazepine antagonist) had no effect on Cl- current enhancement by DMCM and, in fact, increased the current level through blocking current inhibition by DMCM via the benzodiazepine site. Also, Cl- current enhancement by pentobarbitone or by 3 alpha, 21-dihydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one was additive to that by DMCM at saturating doses. It appears that the agonist site for DMCM is distinct from those for benzodiazepines, barbiturates and neurosteroids. 4. Among beta-carboline analogues, methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate and propyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate markedly enhanced GABA-induced Cl currents in the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 subtype, while N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide and 1-methyl-7-methoxy-3,4-dihydro-beta-carboline did not. It appears that the 3-carboxyl ester moiety is necessary for beta-carbolines to interact with a novel site on GABAA receptors as agonists.",

Imovane performed better than estazolam in sleep time onset and total sleep time. From this study, imovane can be recommended as a new hypuotic to treat patients with sleep disturbances.", 
    "96": "We examined gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), benzodiazepine and convulsant sites of postsynaptic GABA/benzodiazepine receptors (GBZR) in cerebral membranes of inbred Fischer 344 male rats as a function of age. In aged rats (23 to 24 months), the benzodiazepine binding site as determined by [3H]flunitrazepam was 47% and 43% lower than corresponding values in young adult (3 to 4 months) and mature (10 to 12 months) rats, respectively. The decrease was due to the loss of binding density rather than a change in affinity. No statistically significant age-related changes in [3H]muscimol binding were observed when 5 nM or 40 nM labeled muscimol were used. GABA produced a dose-dependent stimulation of flunitrazepam binding in all age groups, but the maximum stimulation in aged animals was significantly higher (24%) than in young and mature animals. The [35S]TBPS binding site, the convulsant site of GABA/benzodiazepine receptors, was unaffected with age. We also studied the effects of exercise on GBZR binding sites of aged rats. The decline of flunitrazepam binding sites and the high sensitivity of flunitrazepam binding to regulation by GABA in aged animals were reversed by 8 to 10 weeks of endurance exercise. Endurance exercise did not have any significant effect on muscimol or TBPS binding sites. Results suggest that there are aged-related alterations of GBZR binding sites and that these modifications can be reversed by exercise.", 
    "97": "Recently, we presented a method for estimating the pulmonary capillary volume and transport function based on the use of a reference indicator and two or more indicators that rapidly equilibrate (radially) with the tissue (i.e., the concentrations in the vascular and extravascular spaces at a given axial location are in equilibrium) during transit through the capillaries in a bolus-injection indicator dilution method (S. H. Audi, G. S. Krenz, J. H. Linehan, D. A. Rickaby, and C. A. Dawson. J. Appl. Physiol. 77:332-351, 1994). The objectives of the present study were 1) to determine whether [14C]diazepam and [3H]alfentanil equilibrate sufficiently rapidly between the vascular space and tissue and with sufficiently different pulmonary extra-vascular mean residence times to be used in a single bolus to estimate the pulmonary capillary volume and transport function using this method and 2) to estimate the pulmonary capillary volume and transit time distribution in isolated perfused rabbit lungs. Both [14C]diazepam and [3H]alfentanil were found to be rapidly equilibrating indicators by the criteria that, over a wide range of flow rates, their respective venous effluent concentration curves were nearly congruent on a time scale normalized to the lung mean transit time for the reference indicator (fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran). In addition, at a given plasma albumin concentration, [14C]diazepam had a significantly longer extravascular mean residence time than [3H]alfentanil, e.g., at 6% plasma albumin concentration, the extravascular mean residence time of [14C]diazepam was more than twice that of [3H]alfentanil. On average, the estimated pulmonary capillary volume for a 2.7-kg was approximately 4.2 ml or approximately 44% of the total pulmonary vascular volume (9.5 ml). The relative dispersion of the pulmonary capillary transport function of the rabbit was approximately 90%.", 
    "98": "The effect of peripheral-type benzodiazepines on dog neutrophil stimulation was studied. Ro 5-4864 (a specific ligand of mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor) and diazepam (which binds both to mitochondrial and central benzodiazepine receptors) did not show any direct toxic effect against neutrophils. PK 11195, a putative antagonist of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor and an isoquinoline derivative, had a direct toxic effect at a concentration of 5 x 10(-5) M (72% of cells were viable). Ro 5-4864 (10(-6)-10(-4) M) and diazepam (10(-6)-2.5 x 10(-4) M) induced an intracellular oxidative stress in dog neutrophils. These compounds, in a micromolar range, also induced a concentration-dependent cell surface expression of heat shock protein (HSP) families. The percentages of positive cells that express these proteins were: 76.2% for HSP 27 kDa; 54.3% for HSP 72 kDa and 69.6% for HSP 90 kDa for Ro 5-4864 (10(-4) M), and 66.7% for HSP 27 kDa; 45.4% for HSP 72 kDa and 78.3 for HSP 90 kDa for diazepam (2.5 x 10(-4) M). It appears that this HSP expression, induced by peripheral-type benzodiazepines could be mediated by an intracellular oxidative stress.",

Seventy three drug misusers were identified in September 1985 and 68 in April 1993. Poly substance misuse was a major feature of the 1993 survey and Benzodiazepines replaced Heroin as the major drug of misuse. There was a significant increase in the misuse of prescribed opiates, in particular morphine sulphate, methadone and DF118. Physical problems associated with drug misuse were more common in 1993 because of the new trend of crushing and injecting the morphine sulphate tablet.

    "100": "Advances over the past 2 decades in our understanding of the biology of panic disorder have paralleled a remarkable increase in the development of new pharmacological agents with antipanic effects. Although we can not presently use biological tests to help with our choice of therapeutic agent for individual patients, we can use this biological understanding in the development of overall pharmaco-therapeutic strategies. Current evidence does not support the hypothesis that panic disorder is associated with a primary disorder in one neurotransmitter system. Rather, the data suggest that the biological aetiology of panic disorder is related to abnormalities in the function of a variety of neurotransmitters including serotonin (5-hydroxytyrptamine; 5-HT), noradrenaline (norepinephrine), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine, and cholecystokinin. It is likely, however, that panic disorder is a biologically heterogeneous condition and that biological subtypes may exist in which the primary abnormality may involve one or a few neurotransmitter systems. Currently, the data best support the hypothesis that pharmacotherapeutic agents with primary action at sites within the GABA and serotonin systems are the most effective in the treatment of panic disorder. Nevertheless, some patients will respond well to drugs with predominant activity in other systems, or may require pharmacotherapy designed to affect the function of more than 1 neurotransmitter. As our understanding of the biological aetiology of panic disorder evolves, the pharmacotherapeutic agents and strategies used in the treatment of this disorder will continue to evolve as well.",

    "103": "The use of diazepam per rectum (RDZ) in the home to control generalized cluster seizures in 11 dogs diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy was evaluated over a 16-month period. All dogs had a prior history of clusters of generalized seizures and were treated with multiple antiepileptic drugs. Owners were instructed to administer diazepam injectable solution (5 mg/mL) per rectum to their dogs at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg when an initial generalized seizure occurred and when a second or third generalized seizure occurred within 24 hours of the first seizure. Seizure activity was recorded by owners in a daily log before the onset of RDZ use and for the duration of RDZ use, which ranged from 57 to 464 days (median = 157 days). The median age at which the first seizure occurred and the median age at the time of enrollment in the study were 19 and 42 months, respectively. All 11 dogs were treated with phenobarbital, with 10 dogs receiving concomitant bromide therapy. No significant correlation between the duration of the first, second, or third antiepileptic drug therapy and the change in the number of cluster seizure events before or after use of RDZ was found. Comparisons of seizure activity were done for the same time interval before and after the onset of RDZ availability. A significant decrease in the total number of seizure events and the total number of cluster seizures events was found after RDZ availability. Similarly, a significant difference in the average number of seizures per cluster seizure event and the total number of isolated seizure events occurred before and after RDZ therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "104": "Perinatal period, which is characterized by intensive histogenesis and cytodifferentiation of the already shaped organs, is a highly vulnerable phase for fetal/neonatal brain and immune system-organs with high similarity in receptor equipment. Even fine deviations in the programmed developmental processes induced by drugs initiate disorders in the formation of neural network, cytoarchitectonics and receptor-transmitter communication systems. This pathology is not evident at birth, but forms the basis for various functional defects of neuro-psycho-immunocompetence which become apparent gradually during further maturation or even in adulthood. Clinical recognition of such functional teratogenic action of drugs is hampered by the long time interval (upto decades) between the drug administration and its consequences, making the identification of causal relations very difficult. Consequently, experimental research is necessary under the precondition of adequate animal models with sufficient validity for the extrapolation on human level. The authors suggest the principles of such approach using drug application in neonatal rats with lifelong follow-up of behaviour, immune reactivity and brain biochemical analysis. The evaluation of functional teratogenic risk in three drugs used in the treatment of risk pregnancies and risk neonates (dexamethazone, fenoterol, diazepam) is presented.",

    "106": "Data from two population-based case-control studies in the greater metropolitan Boston, MA (USA) were used to assess the association of self-reported use of antidepressants or benzodiazepine tranquilizers and epithelial ovarian cancer. Cases were women between 18 and 80 years of age diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer during two time periods: November 1978 through September 1981, and July 1984 through September 1987. Female controls were identified from Massachusetts town books and were frequency-matched to cases by age, race, and precinct of residence. In-person interviews assessed reproductive and medical histories as well as prescription medication use. Prior use of antidepressants or benzodiazepine tranquilizers exceeding one to six months was associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.9-4.8, and adjusted OR = 1.8, CI = 1.0-3.1, respectively). The association was confined primarily to women whose first use occurred before age 50 years (adjusted OR = 3.5, CI = 1.3-9.2, and adjusted OR = 2.7, CI = 1.3-5.6, respectively). No association was observed with respect to other non-hormonal medications reported.", 
    "107": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of midazolam on vomiting after tonsillectomy in children. We compared 215 children aged 1.5-14 yr undergoing tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy under general anaesthesia with nitrous oxide and halothane. In a double-blind fashion the subjects were administered either placebo or midazolam 75 micrograms.kg-1 iv after induction of anaesthesia. After the operation, the number of emetic episodes and the length of stay in hospital were recorded. The groups were similar with respect to age, weight, sex, mode of induction, duration of anaesthesia, surgical procedure, opioid administration and length of stay in the PAR and the Day Care Surgical Unit. The 108 midazolam-treated children had a lower incidence (42% vs 57%) of vomiting than the placebo group, P < 0.02. The placebo group had a higher incidence (9% vs 2%) of unscheduled admissions to hospital due to nausea and vomiting, P < 0.05. It is concluded that midazolam administered intravenously to children intraoperatively reduces vomiting after tonsillectomy.", 
    "108": "We investigated adaptation to nitrogen narcosis by compressing 11 highly experienced divers in a hyperbaric chamber to the equivalent of 54.6 meters of seawater once a day for 5 consecutive days. The behavioral component of narcosis was assessed with a serial choice-reaction time (RT) task, and the subjective component with a global magnitude estimate. Supplementary magnitude estimates were obtained with adjectives describing work effectiveness and body sensations. The results showed that there was no adaptation on the RT task, although learning was evident. In contrast, the global estimate dissociated from RT and showed clear adaptation by Day 3. The work effectiveness adjectives followed RT and did not show adaptation. Some body sensation adjectives showed clear adaptation, but others did not. These results lead to the conclusion that the anecdotal reports of adaptation by divers can probably be attributed to the subjective rather than the behavioral component of narcosis. Dissociation of these components suggests mediation by different brain mechanisms, and it is speculated that the gamma-aminobutyric acidA/benzodiazepine receptor complex, which has been implicated in both the anesthetic and anxiolytic properties of agents such as nitrous oxide, may be involved.", 
    "109": "Up to now there is no excipient for the solubilization of poorly watersoluble drugs that can be used without limitations in pharmaceutical preparations for intravasal application. The available surfactants show considerable hemolytic activity, cause anaphylactic reactions are chemically instable or have no sufficient solubilizing capacity. By polymerisation of non-ionic surfactants amphiphilic side-chain-polymers are obtained which show in vitro the same solubilization capacity as the monomers but exhibit practically no hemolytic activity. The objective of this work was to investigate, if this findings are also true for ionic oligomers. For this purpose, polyacrylic acids were substituted with long-chain alkyl amines. The solubilization capacity of these oligomers exceeds that of non-ionic amphiphilic side-chain-polymers and that of other surfactants. The hemolytic activity of the oligomers was below that of common ionic surfactants. The solubilization capacity as well as the hemolytic activity depends on the oligomers degree of substitution. Considering their high solubilization capacity and their low hemolytic activity, these oligomers may be excipients in preparations for parenteral application.", 
    "110": "New triazolo- and tetrazolo-pyrimidobenzodiazepines were synthesized and screened as anti-HIV, anticancer and immunosuppressive agents. Some of the compounds showed immunosuppressive activity, similar to or stronger than that of cyclosporine A.", 
    "111": "Patients with panic disorder perceive physical symptoms which they interpret as dangerous phenomena; therefore, they normally seek help from physicians in somatic medicine and do not consult with a psychotherapist or psychiatrist. The combination of physical symptoms and catastrophic thinking induces such an intense feeling of anxiety that patients often visit an emergency unit. Thus, the prevalence of panic disorder is high among patients who seek help for heart symptoms within the setting of an emergency department (18%); in other clinical populations it may even be higher (patients with negative coronary angiography 33 to 59%, with irritable bowel syndrome 29 to 38%, with migraine headache 5 to 15%). Already in the emergency department it is possible to establish with the patient an understanding of the impact such catastrophic interpretations of basically benign physical changes have on the development of panic. This helps to avoid long-standing and expensive patient careers that have often been described in the literature. The present review includes a description of the cognitive model of the origin and the treatment of panic disorder as well as an overview of drug treatments with benzodiazepines and antidepressive drugs.", 
    "112": "Initial resistance of bacterial infection is mediated primarily by polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN). Anaesthetic agents have been reported to impair various aspects of PMN function. It is possible that the use of these agents to sedate critically ill patients may further compromise an already depressed host defence mechanism. A flow cytometric technique with fresh whole blood from 10 healthy volunteers was used. Phagocytic and respiratory burst activity of PMN incubated for 1 h with either propofol, thiopentone, midazolam or ketamine at both clinical plasma concentrations and 100 times this concentration were determined. Thiopentone at the higher concentration reduced both respiratory burst activity (mean peak channel 50.7 compared with control value of 77.6 (P < 0.0001)) and phagocytosis (mean peak channel 47.5 compared with 79.9 (P < 0.0001)). Ketamine at 100 times the clinical plasma concentration also reduced respiratory burst and phagocytosis, but this failed to reach statistical significance (P = 0.10 and P = 0.053, respectively). No significant depression occurred in the other groups. The results suggest that these i.v. anaesthetic agents, at clinically relevant concentrations, have minimal effects on PMN phagocytosis and oxygen free radical production. At higher concentrations thiopentone and ketamine may affect phagocytic function and thiopentone may impair intracellular cytolysis."
