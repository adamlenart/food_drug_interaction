    "0": "Resedation after antagonism of midazolam sedation with flumazenil may occur because some individuals have rapid elimination of flumazenil but slow elimination of midazolam. To determine whether there are parallel or divergent rates of elimination of the two drugs between individuals, the pharmacokinetic profiles of midazolam and flumazenil were studied simultaneously in 12 adult male volunteers. Free drug concentration data for the two drugs were incorporated into a receptor occupancy model and psychomotor testing was performed and correlated with receptor occupancy. Variation was found between individuals in the pharmacokinetics of the two drugs. There were significant correlations between Cltot (P < 0.01) but not in t1/2 alpha, t1/2 beta, Vc, or VDss. In individuals, midazolam elimination half-life ranged from less than half that of flumazenil to more than three times that of flumazenil. There was a relatively poor, although statistically significant linear correlation found between calculated receptor occupancy and critical flicker fusion frequency, r = 0.50, P < 0.01, and linear analogue scales of sedation r = 0.56, P < 0.005; and anxiolysis, r = 0.54, P < 0.005. There is divergence in the disposition and elimination of midazolam and flumazenil in some individuals. A benzodiazepine receptor occupancy model is useful for predicting the consequent differences in clinical effect when the drugs are given together.", 
    "1": "The discriminative stimulus properties of the selective CCKB-receptor antagonist, L-365,260 were evaluated in rats trained to discriminate diazepam (2 mg/kg) or morphine (5 mg/kg) from vehicle, using a two-lever food reinforced technique. In the diazepam drug discrimination, the benzodiazepine-receptor agonist FG8205 (0.063-2 mg/kg) produced dose-related drug associated responding, whereas L-365,260 (0.125-4 mg/kg) treated animals showed vehicle appropriate behaviour. In rats trained to discriminate morphine from saline, L-365,260 (0.063-4 mg/kg) produced saline lever responding. When a dose of 1 mg/kg L-365,260 was administered in combination with morphine, the dose response curve for drug lever responding was not significantly affected. This was in contrast to the effect produced by the opiate antagonist naloxone (0.3 mg/kg) which shifted the dose-response curve to the right. Another group of rats underwent training to discriminate a dose of 6 mg/kg L-365,260 from vehicle. None of the animals learned the discrimination within 50 daily training sessions. In addition, unlike morphine (3 mg/kg), or changing the training dose of cocaine, intravenous administration of L-365,260 (0.3-10 mg/kg) did not modify lever pressing or the number of injections received by rats trained to self administer cocaine (0.25 mg/injection). L-365,260 (0.1-3 mg/kg) produced a dose-related inhibition of pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion in vivo. When administered dissolved in a mixture of ethanol/propylene glycol/saline, the ID50 was 0.83 mg/kg, and when suspended in an ethanol/carboxymethylcellulose vehicle, it was 0.7 mg/kg. It was concluded: 1) that L-365,260 does not produce discriminative stimuli similar to either diazepam or morphine; 2) that the potentiation of morphine-induced behaviour by L-365,260 does not extend to the discriminative stimulus properties of morphine; 3) that L-365,260 itself does not produce readily discriminable interoceptive stimuli in rats; and 4) that L-365,260 does not substitute for the reinforcing drug cocaine.", 
    "2": "Repeated administration of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) induces kindling and impairs shuttle-box learning. The available literature suggesting a close connection between seizure frequency and mental deficits in human epileptics allows us to hypothesize that seizure inhibition prevents the progressive mental retardation associated with kindling. In order to investigate the effect of motor seizure inhibition on mental impairment we administered diazepam (DZP) doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg, respectively 60 min prior to the 10 convulsant injections. After completion of kindling the learning performance of the rats was tested in the shuttle-box. PTZ kindling resulted in diminished shuttle-box learning. In control rats treated with DZP no significant changes in their learning ability occurred. Although DZP was found to suppress kindling development effectively a worsened shuttle-box learning could be observed in all PTZ groups treated with DZP.",

Behavioural effects were assessed in the elevated plus-maze and open field tests. In separate experiments, effects on thyrotropin (TSH), prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH) levels in serum of male rats were studied. Caerulein inhibited the exploratory behaviour in the plus-maze. Time spent in the open part, the number of line crossings and closed arm entries were significantly decreased, whereas the ratio of failed attempts/closed arm entries was increased. The anti-exploratory effect of caerulein was antagonized by the pretreatment with L-365,260 (10 micrograms/kg), a preferential antagonist at CCKB receptors, but was increased by devazepide (1-100 micrograms/kg), a preferential CCKA antagonist. L-365,260 (1-100 micrograms/kg) and devazepide (1-100 micrograms/kg) given alone did not change the behaviour of rats in the plus-maze test. Caerulein (5 micrograms/kg) itself did not modify the locomotor activity of rats in open field. However, the concomitant administration of caerulein with devazepide (1-10 micrograms/kg) reduced the frequency of line crossings and rearings. In the hormonal studies caerulein significantly decreased the cold-induced increase of TSH levels in serum. GH and PRL levels were not markedly affected by caerulein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Of the 48 cases reviewed, 52% received a diagnosis of conversion disorder. The obstruction was severe enough to cause intubation and tracheostomies in some patients.

    "5": "Nearly three decades have now passed since the discovery of the piracetam-like nootropics, compounds which exhibit cognition-enhancing properties, but for which no commonly accepted mechanism of action has been established. This review covers clinical, pharmacokinetic, biochemical and behavioural results presented in the literature from 1965 through 1992 (407 references) of piracetam, oxiracetam, pramiracetam, etiracetam, nefiracetam, aniracetam and rolziracetam and their structural analogues. The piracetam-like nootropics are capable of achieving reversal of amnesia induced by, e.g., scopolamine, electroconvulsive shock and hypoxia. Protection against barbiturate intoxication is observed and some benefit in clinical studies with patients suffering from mild to moderate degrees of dementia has been demonstrated. No affinity for the alpha 1-, alpha 2-, beta-, muscarinic, 5-hydroxytryptamine-, dopamine, adenosine-A1-, mu-opiate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (except for nefiracetam (GABAA)), benzodiazepine and glutamate receptors has been found. The racetams possess a very low toxicity and lack serious side effects. Increased turnover of different neurotransmitters has been observed as well as other biochemical findings, e.g., inhibition of enzymes such as prolylendopeptidase. So far, no generally accepted mechanism of action has, however, emerged. We believe that the effect of the racetams is due to a potentiation of already present neurotransmission and that much evidence points in the direction of a modulated ion flux by, e.g., potentiated calcium influx through non-L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels, potentiated sodium influx through alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor gated channels or voltage-dependent channels or decreases in potassium efflux. Effects on carrier mediated ion transport are also possible.", 
    "6": "Microinjection of muscarinic receptor subtype antagonists into the region of the cat retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) decreases blood pressure (greatest efficacy; M2 subtype) and both baseline phrenic activity and CO2 sensitivity (greatest efficacy; M3/M1 subtype). Here we examine, in cat medullary sections at the level of the RTN, the effects of the same antagonists on binding of the high affinity muscarinic agonist quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB). 3H-QNB binding was saturated and highly specific at 1 nM concentration and stable over 30 to 120 min (Kd, 0.49 nM; Bmax, 136 fm/mg protein). Studied biochemically, we found IC50 values for whole sections of 4.9 x 10(-6) M (M1 antagonist pirenzepine); 1.0 x 10(-6) M (M2 antagonist AFDX); and 0.64 x 10(-7) M (M3 antagonist DAMP; P < 0.03 vs PZ). Densitometric analysis of whole medullary cross section autoradiograms resulted in similar IC50 values as in the biochemical approach. Specific analysis of the RTN region demonstrated the presence of 3H-QNB binding and similar competition by the antagonists. Average IC50 values determined by densitometry were 14 x 10(-6) M (pirenzepine); 1.3 x 10(-6) M (AFDX; P < 0.01 vs PZ); and 0.53 x 10(-7) M (DAMP; P < 0.01 vs PZ). All three subtypes of muscarinic receptors identifiable via pharmacological antagonists appear to be present in the RTN region but we could not distinguish a subtype-specific pattern of receptor distribution.",

    "8": "The efficacy and clinical tolerance of the 3 anesthetic techniques with propofol, midazolam or isoflurane were studied in 63 patients undergoing elective breast, lumbar or gynecological surgery. Anesthetic induction was achieved with midazolam 0.3 mg/kg-1 (group M), propofol 2.5 mg/kg-1 (group P) or thiopental 3 mg/kg-1 (group I); all patients also received 50 micrograms/kg-1 alfentanil and vecuronium bromide 0.12 mg/kg-1/h-1. Maintenance was achieved with midazolam in perfusion at 0.12 mg/kg-1/h-1 (group M); propofol in perfusion at 7 mg/kg-1/h-1 and a pre-incision dose of 1.5 mg/kg-1 (group P); and isoflurane at 1.15% (group I). The 3 groups also received one pre-incision dose of alfentanil 25 micrograms/kg-1 and post-incision perfusion at 60 micrograms/kg-1/h-1. The infusion of alfentanil was changed by amounts of 20 micrograms/kg-1/h-1 in accordance with the patient's response to surgery. After surgery patients in group M received flumazenil 0.5 mg i.v. over 30 sec and a perfusion of flumazenil 0.5 mg over 60 min. Parameters indicating efficacy were: 1) total dose and timing of alfentanil; 2) number of instances of inadequate anesthesia; 3) peri-operative amnesia; 4) times of awakening and extubation after surgery, and 5) the number of patients in each group who required naloxone. Parameters indicating tolerance were: 1) hemodynamic variables; 2) the number of postoperative desaturations; 3) level of sedation, comprehension and motor coordination and orientation; 4) the \"G/g detection\" test and the memory recall test; 5) adverse side effects; 6) need for postoperative analgesia, and 7) evaluation of the anesthetic technique.", 
    "9": "The 3 techniques afforded effective control of hemodynamic response to intubation and surgical incision. Anesthetic maintenance was easy and safe with isoflurane and propofol. Higher doses of alfentanil, however, were needed with midazolam and we found a higher incidence of signs of superficial anesthesia. Reversion of midazolam with flumazenil 0.5 mg i.v. produced earlier awakening, although this was followed later by relapse into hypno-sedation that could not be prevented with a perfusion of flumazenil. Although recovery from anesthesia was slower with propofol than with isoflurane, we observed no differences in level of sedation, motor coordination and postoperative comprehension. Maintenance with isoflurane produced a higher incidence of adverse side effects such as tremors and nausea after surgery.", 
    "10": "None of the TIVA techniques proved superior in all the parameters studied during anesthetic maintenance when compared with balanced isoflurane-alfentanil, although the propofol-alfentanil combination was found to be superior to that of midazolam-alfentanil. After anesthesia, however, recovery was better with the association of propofol-alfentanil and adverse side effects were fewer. Flumazenil at the doses used was ineffective for preventing resedation due to midazolam.", 
    "11": "The efficacy of diazepam (DZ) and scopolamine (SCP), in combination with atropine (ATR)+oxime therapy, against soman-induced seizure/convulsive activity and associated brain damage has been demonstrated, but the efficacy of each against the incapacitating effects of soman has not been addressed. Thus, the therapeutic efficacies of SCP (5 doses; 0-0.86 mg/kg) and DZ (5 doses; 0-5 mg/kg), when each was used in conjunction with ATR (3 doses; 0.5-8 mg/kg) + 2-PAM (25 mg/kg) therapy, were compared in groups of pyridostigmine pretreated guinea pigs exposed to 1.6, 2.0, 2.5, or 3.2 LD50s of soman. Response surface methodology was employed to describe the relationship between soman-induced incapacitation and the ATR/DZ or ATR/SCP dosages. Incapacitation was measured by toxicity scores assigned by three graders to test animals at 60 min postsoman. Results show that as the dosage of SCP increased, the mean toxicity scores decreased. Also, within the indicated dose ranges used, the efficacy of SCP was not dependent on the presence of ATR. In contrast, ATR alone was found to be more effective than when combined with DZ at any dose, and indicates that DZ might be temporarily contributing to soman-induced incapacitation. These findings suggest that in guinea pigs, SCP could replace ATR or DZ, or both, as therapy against soman-induced incapacitation.", 
    "12": "The influence of several intravenous anaesthetics on the heart was assessed using the isolated rat heart-lung preparation. Each group received 10(-3)mol litre-1 and 10(-4)mol liter-1 of ketamine, 6 micrograms ml-1 and 60 micrograms ml-1 of midazolam, 6 micrograms ml-1 and 60 micrograms ml-1 of diazepam or 0.6 micrograms ml-1 and 6 micrograms ml-1 of flunitrazepam. Systolic blood pressure in rats receiving high doses of midazolam, diazepam and ketamine were higher than that in the control group. Heart rate in rats receiving high doses of ketamine and diazepam were lower than that in the control group. However, there were no significant changes in cardiac output among the groups. Maximum rate of left ventricular tension development in rats receiving high doses of midazolam and diazepam increased significantly in comparison with that in the control group. There were no significant changes in myocardial high energy phosphates among the groups. None of the intravenous anaesthetics, even in doses which were 100 times greater than therapeutic doses, showed any depressant effects in this preparation. Moreover, it is surprising that midazolam and diazepam produced direct increases in myocardial contractility. These results suggest that the cardiodepressant effects of intravenous anaesthetics may be due to their effects on the central nervous system.", 
    "13": "Anaesthesia and surgical stress can affect renal function and body fluid regulation indirectly as well as directly. The indirect effects, through influences on haemodynamics, sympathetic activity and humoral regulation, are more pronounced than the direct ones. Inhalational anaesthetics generally reduce glomerular filtration rate and urine output, mainly by extra-renal effects that are attenuated by pre-operative hydration. Opioids, barbiturates and benzodiazepines also reduce glomerular filtration rate and urine output. The effects of regional anaesthesia seem to be less than those of general anaesthesia and are related to changes in systemic haemodynamics. These peri-operative alterations of renal function are usually transient and clinically insignificant. Mechanical ventilation decreases urine volume and sodium excretion to an extent that depends on the increase in intrathoracic pressure, though ADH release, unloading of baroreceptors and activation of the renin-angiotensin system may also be involved. The direct effects of anaesthesia which are dose- and agent-dependent include effects on autoregulation of renal blood flow, alteration in the effect of ADH, and effects on tubular transport of sodium and organic acids. The only proven direct toxic effect of any anaesthetic agent is the fluoride-related toxicity of methoxyflurane.", 
    "14": "There is a high incidence of intraoperative awareness during cardiac surgery. Mid-latency auditory evoked potentials (MLAEP) reflect the primary cortical processing of auditory stimuli. In the present study, we investigated MLAEP and explicit and implicit memory for information presented during cardiac anaesthesia. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Institutional approval and informed consent was obtained in 30 patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery. Anaesthesia was induced in group I (n = 10) with flunitrazepam/fentanyl (0.01 mg/kg) and maintained with flunitrazepam/fentanyl (1.2 mg/h). The patients in group II (n = 10) received etomidate (0.25 mg/kg) and fentanyl (0.005 mg/kg) for induction and isoflurane (0.6-1.2 vol%)/fentanyl (1.2 mg/h) for maintenance of general anaesthesia. Group III (n = 10) served as a control and patients were anaesthetized as in I or II. After sternotomy an audiotape that included an implicit memory task was presented to the patients in groups I and II. The story of Robinson Crusoe was told, and it was suggested to the patients that they remember Robinson Crusoe when asked what they associated with the word Friday 3-5 days postoperatively. Auditory evoked potentials were recorded awake and during general anaesthesia before and after the audiotape presentation on vertex (positive) and mastoids on both sides (negative). Auditory clicks were presented binaurally at 70 dBnHL at a rate of 9.3 Hz. Using the electrodiagnostic system Pathfinder I (Nicolet), 1000 successive stimulus responses were averaged over a 100 ms poststimulus interval and analyzed off-line. Latencies of the peak V, Na, Pa were measured. V belongs to the brainstem-generated potentials, which demonstrates that auditory stimuli were correctly transduced. Na, Pa are generated in the primary auditory cortex of the temporal lobe and are the electrophysiological correlate of the primary cortical processing of the auditory stimuli. RESULTS. None of the patients had an explicit memory of intraoperative events. Five patients in group I, one patient in group II, and no patients in group III showed implicit memory of the intraoperative tape message. They remembered Robinson Crusoe spontaneously when they were asked their associations with Friday. In the awake state AEP peak latencies were in the normal range. During general anaesthesia in group I, the peaks Na, Pa did not increase in latency or decrease in amplitude before and after the audiotape presentation. The primary cortical complex Na/Pa could be identified as in the awake state. In contrast, in group II Na, Pa showed a marked increase in latency and a decrease in amplitude or were completely suppressed. CONCLUSIONS. During general anaesthesia auditory information can be processed and remembered postoperatively by an implicit memory function, when the electrophysiological conditions of primary cortical stimuli processing is preserved. Implicit memory can be observed more often when high-dose opioid analgesia is combined with receptor-binding agents like the benzodiazepines than under non-specific anaesthetics like isoflurane. Non-specific anaesthetics seem to provide a more effective suppression of auditory stimuli processing than receptor-specific agents.", 
    "15": "A 63-year-old man presented with an 11-month history of progressive myoclonus in the right abdominal wall. Administration of clonazepam reduced the frequency and amplitude. When the therapy was discontinued, the frequency and amplitude of the myoclonus increased, and synchronous and weak myoclonus also was observed in the left abdomen. The trunk was twisted just after the appearance of the abdominal myoclonus associated with myoclonic jerks spreading from the rostral to caudal paraspinal muscles. Later in the clinical course, the myoclonus became stimulus sensitive and was induced by tendon tap given anywhere on the body, with the latency ranging from 50 to 150 ms irrespective of the sites of tapping. Myoclonus seen in the abdominal wall was segmental and considered to be of spinal origin. The reflex myoclonus had a 150-ms refractory period. It can be postulated that increased excitability of anterior horn cells at a certain segment might make a spino-bulbo-spinal reflex manifest at the corresponding segment. This myoclonus is considered to be a new form of spinal reflex myoclonus, because the abdominal myoclonic jerk seems to trigger another myoclonic jerk involving the paraspinal muscles.", 
    "16": "Testing for drugs of abuse in urine is usually performed in two steps; after initial screening positive findings are confirmed with specific chromatographic techniques. The use of different methods with different cut-off levels, may lead to variable results in a test sample containing a drug. Sixty-eight Swedish laboratories were enrolled in an external quality study and received three control samples. The laboratories were instructed to perform only in-house tests for amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine and opiates. Nineteen out of the 68 laboratories reported fully correct results. Thirty reported one o more false positive drug findings. One laboratory performing confirmation with gas chromatography--mass spectrometry reported a false positive finding of amphetamines in the sample containing ephedrine. Since testing for drugs of abuse in urine is a delicate matter, with both medical and legal implications, such testing should be performed with a zero rate of false positive results. Routine use of specific methods for confirmation should be used since performance of these laboratories was better in this study. It is concluded that there is a need to continuously measure the level of quality of laboratories by a program for external quality control.", 
    "17": "To address the economic issues posed by the introduction of 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor antagonist (5-HT3 RA), we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis based on clinical trial data published in the recent literature. Cost calculations include initial treatment and a second-line salvage treatment. The average cost and incremental cost were established. Incremental cost corresponds to the extra cost involved in achieving total control of emesis in 1% extra patients. If 5-HT3 RA is not part of the initial treatment, salvage treatment with ondansetron is not cost-effective. Moreover, starting with the combination of ondansetron plus dexamethasone saves more money than starting with ondansetron alone. However, if the difference in emesis control is only minimal, treatment with the 5-HT3 RA remains more expensive.",

Ro5-4864 inhibited the regenerative tonic endplate depolarization caused by repetitive stimulation in the presence of neostigmine without affecting the amplitude and decay time of miniature and evoked single endplate potentials. 4. All the effects of Ro5-4864 were shared by PK11195, a pBZR antagonist, but not by clonazepam and flumazenil, a cBZR agonist and antagonist, respectively. 5.

    "19": "The effect of mood stabilizing agents such as lithium, carbamazepine, valproic acid and clonazepam on serotonin(5-HT)- or thrombin-induced intracellular calcium (Ca) mobilization was studied in the platelets of healthy subjects using the fluorescent Ca indicator fura-2. After incubating platelet-rich plasma with these drugs for one or four hours, there was no significant difference in either basal Ca2+ concentration or 5-HT-stimulated Ca response between each agent treatment and control. 5-HT- or thrombin-induced Ca mobilization was not altered by four weeks of lithium carbonate administration in healthy volunteers. These results indicate that these mood stabilizers fail to affect the agonist-stimulated intracellular Ca mobilizing pathway either in vitro or ex vivo in the platelets of healthy subjects.",

The present study was designed to explore the receptor mediation of the stimulus properties of CCK within this procedure. Every fourth day, experimental subjects were given CCK-saccharin-LiCl pairings, and on the intervening recovery days, saccharin alone. Once discriminative control was established, doses of the CCK receptor antagonists devazepide (CCK-type A receptor subtype) and L-365,260 (CCK-type B receptor subtype) were administered in combination with the training dose of CCK. Unlike L-365,260 (1-1000 micrograms/kg), devazepide (1 microgram/kg) blocked the CCK stimulus, suggesting that within this design CCK's stimulus properties are mediated by the CCK-type A receptor subtype.", 
    "22": "A simple technique for the measurement of intoxication induced by low doses of alcohol in the rat was developed. Rats are required to maintained their balance on a rectangular wooden bar that oscillates in a 120 degree angle in an arch-like fashion. A steady baseline can be obtained for each animal with approximately 10 min of training time. Ethanol, in a dose range from 0.5-1.5 g/kg, given orally or by IP route, impairs animal's performance in a dose-related manner. At the same blood ethanol concentration, a higher degree of impairment is observed at higher oscillating frequency. Significant impairment of performance can be detected at ethanol dose of 0.5 g/kg given IP or orally. Pentobarbital and chlordiazepoxide, in doses of comparable potencies to those of ethanol doses also produce a dose-related impairment of performance. The oscillating bar test is a simple but sensitive test that can qualitatively assess intoxication induced by low doses of ethanol or other sedative hypnotic drugs.", 
    "23": "Two groups of pigeons were trained on a delayed-matching-to-sample (DMTS) task with both identity and symbolic problems, that had either a) specific outcomes correlated (differential group) or b) outcomes uncorrelated (nondifferential group), for each correct sample-choice sequence. After reaching a criterion of 90% correct at the 0 s delay, subjects were tested under saline, methylscopolamine (0.03 mg/kg), scopolamine (0.007, 0.015, 0.03 mg/kg), diazepam (0.0, 1.0, 1.75, 2.5 mg/kg), and lorazepam (0.0, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 mg/kg) at delays of 0 to 8 s. Scopolamine, diazepam, and lorazepam at all doses impaired performance in the nondifferential group; however, in the differential group, the medium and high doses of both scopolamine and lorazepam, and only the high dose of diazepam impaired performance. The differential outcomes procedure, relative to the nondifferential procedure, enhanced retention in the non-drug state and under these amnestic drugs. Impairments observed in the differential group were a result of decreased performance only on samples correlated with a secondary reinforcer (flashing hopper light); there was no decreased performance on samples correlated with a primary reinforcer (grain). Neither group showed any differences in performance as a function of identity versus symbolic problems in a nondrug or drug state.", 
    "24": "During infusion of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in humans, changes in ventilatory drive, sleeping pattern, and appetite have been reported. The mechanism by which BCAA exerts their effects on CNS remains unclear. An infusion of a BCAA solution (300 mg/kg) has previously been found to increase the seizure threshold in rats to the proconvulsant drug picrotoxin, an antagonist on the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. In this study, each of the BCAAs given separately (valine, leucine, isoleucine; 300 mg/kg) (n = 10) increased the mean latency time to onset of seizures vs. placebo as an indication of an increased seizure threshold. A balanced amino acid solution (Vamin-Glucose) had no effect on the seizure threshold. Thus, these CNS effects are specific for BCAAs and occur with all three.",

FK480, MK-329, and loxiglumide inhibited CCK octapeptide (CCK-8)-stimulated amylase release and binding of [125I]CCK-8 in a concentration-dependent manner, with a half-maximal inhibition (ID50) at 1.30 +/- 0.12 nM, 1.33 +/- 0.21 nM, and 1.27 +/- 0.23 microM, respectively, for amylase release, and 0.40 +/- 0.06 nM, 0.68 +/- 0.08 nM, and 0.38 +/- 0.03 microM, respectively, for [125I]CCK-8 binding. The antagonism was competitive in nature because these three compounds caused a parallel rightward shift of the dose-response curve for CCK-8-stimulated amylase secretion, without altering the maximal increase. The antagonism produced by FK480 was specific for CCK in that the effects of other receptor secretagogues or agents bypassing receptors were not altered. FK480 not only prevented but also reversed CCK-8-stimulated amylase release. This compound caused a residual inhibition of the action of CCK-8. When acini were preincubated with 100 nM FK480 for 30 min, the subsequent dose-response curve to CCK-8 was shifted 10-fold toward higher concentration. Similar results were obtained with MK-329 but not with loxiglumide. FK480 appeared to be bound to the receptors on acinar cells in a slowly dissociating state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Under SMB slightly but significantly better results for stomach were scored (3.1 +/- .7 vs. 2.7 +/- 7, p < 0.01). No differences were found in the study of the duodenal bulb. Heart rate and rhythm during the study were recorded by electrocardiogram (ECG). SMB induced tachycardia in all patients (from 77 +/- 20 to 117 +/- 28 beats/min, p < 0.01) while pirenzepine did not (from 77 +/- 16 to 81 +/- 23, p = NS). After SMB, two patients exhibited faintness, and some patients complained of visual accommodation defects, dryness of the mouth, and dizziness. Thus, pirenzepine provides good results in double-contrast studies (equal to SMB), while presenting no adverse effects. It could be proposed as a first choice hypotonic agent in upper gastrointestinal examination.", 
    "31": "The affinity of amitriptyline for muscarine M1 receptors was studied in the rat cerebral cortex and rabbit vas deferens utilizing binding studies as well as inhibition of carbachol-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the cerebral cortex and blockade of the muscarinic prejunctional inhibition of sympathetic nerve stimulation in the rabbit vas deferens. The inhibition constants (KI) or dissociation constants (KB) obtained were approximately 6- to 20-fold lower than those obtained at muscarine M2 receptors in rat atria (binding and negative inotropic response) indicating that amitriptyline exhibits a degree of muscarine M1 receptor selectivity.", 
    "32": "Methodology and the results of the in vitro membrane diffusion and in vivo bioavailability studies are presented. The results confirm a correlation between in vitro and in vivo findings. Hydrophilic macrogol-mixture with great molecular mass can be recommended as the optimal vehicle for formulation of diazepam suppositories.", 
    "33": "We evaluated the effectiveness of rectally administered midazolam for preoperative sedation in 26 cases of childhood moyamoya disease. The patients, aged 5.0 +/- 1.8 yr (mean +/- SD), received 1 mg.kg-1 of midazolam 30 min prior to induction of anesthesia. The patient's level of sedation, tolerance of anesthesia face mask, and amnesia were evaluated. In 22 of 26 patients induction via face mask was performed smoothly, and excellent anterograde amnesia was observed. Remarkable complications, including hemodynamic and/or respiratory depression, were not noted. The level of sedation was significantly related to the patient's age. Although further investigation to evaluate proper dose are needed, 1 mg.kg-1 of rectally administered midazolam is useful for childhood moyamoya disease, in which crying can worsen the neurological symptoms.", 
    "34": "Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, reliably reverses midazolam-induced sedation, but its effect on respiratory depression has not been clarified completely. Ten healthy male volunteers received midazolam 0.1 mg.kg-1. Then they received flumazenil 0.5 mg (n = 9) and 1.0 mg (n = 1), intravenously. Rib-cage (RC) and abdominal wall (ABD) movement was measured by mercury-in-silastic strain gauge. Nasal air flow (FLOW), genioglossal electromyogram (EMG) and oxygen saturation (SaO2) were recorded simultaneously. Midazolam caused significant increases of RC movement and respiratory rate, and decreases of ABD movement, FLOW, EMG and SaO2. After administration of flumazenil, although respiratory rate returned to the pre-midazolam values, RC movement decreased on the contrary. ABD movement, FLOW, EMG, SaO2 did not recover to the pre-midazolam values. These data suggest that flumazenil 0.5 mg reverses midazolam-induced sedation completely, but is partially effective for some parameters related to respiratory depression.", 
    "35": "We evaluated the effects of pirenzepine on salivary secretion and heart rate, comparing them with those after atropine. Forty-two patients for gynecological operations were divided into three groups. P, A and C groups received pirenzepine 10 mg, atropine 0.5 mg and saline 1 ml intravenously 4 min before induction. Salivary secretion was aspirated at 30, 60 and 120 min after induction. Heart rate was recorded at 1, 30, 60 and 120 min after injection. In P and A groups, salivary secretion decreased significantly, but there was no significant difference between them. In A group, heart rate increased at 1, 30 and 60 min after injection, but at 120 min there was no difference among three groups. We conclude that intravenous pirenzepine as well as atropine reduces salivary secretion, but it does not increase heart rate as atropine.", 
    "36": "Conscious sedation of pediatric patients for procedures is occurring with increasing frequency in hospitals and outpatient settings. Nurses need to be aware of current AAP guidelines for conscious sedation as well as current trends in medication. The pediatric applications and current literature regarding intranasal midazolam and flumazenil are reviewed.", 
    "37": "Three cases are reported of patients who had episodic movement disorders triggered by foods or components of the diet. In the first patient, the movement consisted of shaking the head from side to side that was triggered by milk and a number of other foods. In the second patient, the movement consisted of a repeated shrugging of the shoulders that was triggered by egg and coffee. In the third, the movement consisted of rhythmic contractions of the arms and legs that were triggered by aspartame. The first patient agreed to participate in a study in which she drank 250 ml of skim milk, an amount sufficient to trigger head shaking, after pretreatment with drugs known to alter neurotransmission across beta-adrenergic, dopaminergic, GABAergic or purinergic synapses. At the doses used, propranolol and diazepam had no effect on the milk evoked movement disorder. Levodopa (plus carbidopa) blocked the reaction to milk. Haloperidol, salbutamol and theophylline by themselves triggered a reaction similar to that evoked by milk. These observations suggest that, in susceptible individuals, foods can trigger movement disorders through an action on dopamine and other neurotransmitter pathways in the brain. A videotape of the reactions of the first two patients is available.", 
    "38": "In a retrospective study of 500 patients we present evidence that psychotropic analgesic nitrous oxide (PAN) can be used safely and successfully as an out-patient treatment for the AWS in the vast majority of cases. A feature of the PAN therapy is the rapidity of recovery of patients within 60 minutes; which is in stark contrast to that found when traditional benzodiazepine medication regimens are used. Our work confirms earlier findings confined to in-patients. Importantly, the requirements for addictive sedative medications is also dramatically reduced, greatly diminishing the dangers of secondary addiction. In a small number of cases PAN can be used to treat alcohol craving, which may prevent relapses through its positive effects on reducing craving. The promising, rapid anti-craving effects of PAN would seem to require further investigation to establish when it is likely to be of benefit in preventing relapse. In order to maximize the benefit of the PAN treatment to both patient and physician it is essential for the physician to undergo a short hands-on training course.", 
    "39": "Children under 6 often show marked anxiety and physical pain during laceration repair. If locally infiltrated anesthetics usually give a good control of physical pain, they have no effect on anxiety and restlessness for which several medications are available for conscious sedation. Continuous nitrous oxide, intramuscular sedative \"cocktail\" with meperidine-promethazine-chlorpromazine or intravenous fentanyl have various inconveniences and therefore are not ideal for this purpose. By contrast, Midazolam, a short acting watersoluble benzodiazepine with anxiolitic, hypnotic and anterograde amnestic effect, appears to be a safe and effective treatment when given orally or intranasally for alleviating anxiety in under 6 year-old out-patient in emergency department; its rectal administration appears less effective and needs further studies before to be routinely used.", 
    "40": "beta-CCM is a beta-carboline known to have properties opposite to those of benzodiazepines. Our approach was to analyze, in mice, the genetic mechanisms involved in beta-CCM-induced myoclonic seizures using recombinant congenic strains and F1 hybrids issued from these strains. Our aim was to define the extent of the multigenic character of beta-CCM-induced myoclonic seizures, while also evaluating the distribution of the strength of the genes implicated in this trait. The results show that the control of reactivity to beta-CCM is multigenic with notable epistatic involvement.", 
    "41": "Depression is a common condition in the geriatric population. A retrospective study of 30 elderly patients suffering from neurotic depression, who were admitted consecutively to a general hospital psychiatric ward, showed a predominance of females (n = 21) over males (n = 9) and young-old (65 to 74 years, n = 22) more than old-old (75 years or over, n = 8). Their ages ranged from 65 to 85 years with a mean of 71.6 years, SD 5.5 years. Co-existing physical disorders were present in every patient, the average being 1.8 per patient, and half (n = 15) had two or more physical disorders. Cardiovascular diseases (e.g. ischaemic heart disease and hypertension) and diabetes mellitus were present in about seven-eighths of the patients. The two commonest symptoms were low mood (n = 18, 60%) and vague somatic complaints inexplicable by any physical pathology (n = 19, 63%). Sleep disturbance bothered 12 patients (40%), while nine (30%) had attempted suicide. Twenty patients (67%) were prescribed antidepressants and 13 (43%) received benzodiazepines in low dosages, mainly as hypnotics. Electroconvulsive therapy was necessary for two patients with high suicidal risk. The mean duration of admission was 15.3 days, SD 12.9 days.", 
    "42": "Forty patients received either midazolam or midazolam with nalbuphine in a double-blind randomised study of sedation for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. There were less retching, gagging and salivation in the combination group compared to midazolam alone. They were also more cooperative. These resulted in greater ease of insertion of the gastroscope. There was no significant difference in the degree of amnesia in both groups. A significant decrease in oxygen saturation was noted in both groups during the procedure. Monitoring with a pulse oximeter is recommended when sedation is administered during gastroscopy.", 
    "43": "In animal studies (outbred albino rats with different types of conflict behaviour, cottontail rats, inbred mice) it was established that the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepine and atypical tranquilizers including buspirone are associated only with EEG theta-rhythm slowing. At the same time, anxiogenic drugs caused an increase in frequency of the theta-activity and (in large doses) increase of low-frequency spindles. These EEG-changes are close to the patterns of EEG induced by stress. These results suggest that increase in the beta-activity, especially, owing to high-frequency spindles, which has been reported to be a common feature of all tranquilizers, might be connected with adaptive mechanisms of the brain preventing from lesions by psychotropic drugs. It is possible that some abnormal EEG activity of epileptic humans and animals (spike-slow wave, spindles) also is a reflection of these adaptive mechanisms of the brain.", 
    "44": "Intervention packages combining cognitive restructuring techniques and exposure exercises have become the psychosocial treatments of choice for panic, agoraphobia, and social phobia. Exposure and related desensitization techniques are the treatment of choice for all variants of simple phobia. Combining psychotropic medication and cognitive-behavior therapy suggests strategies that offer new opportunities for increasing the number of individuals with anxiety disorders who can be effectively treated with a biobehavioral approach.", 
    "45": "The neurophysiological effects of 2 novel AMPA/kainate receptor antagonists, GYKI 52466 and LY 293558, on the high pressure neurological syndrome have been investigated in the rat and baboon (GYKI 52466) and rat (LY 293558). Rats were exposed to increasing ambient pressures of helium and oxygen at 3 ATA/min, on one occasion each. GYKI 52466 at 20 mumol/kg i.v. immediately before, followed by 70 mumol/kg/hr i.v. during compression delayed tremor by 85% and myoclonus by 30%, compared with control vehicle, and no side effects were observed. Seizure activity was not affected by any of the doses used. LY 293558 at 36 mumol/kg i.p. delayed tremor and myoclonus (44% and 12%), LY 293558 72 mumol/kg additionally delayed seizure activity (21%). Side effects, principally tranquilization at the higher dose, were also noted. Six baboons were exposed to a maximum pressure of 91 ATA at 0.3 ATA/min, in the same environment, on two occasions. One exposure was treated with an i.v. infusion of GYKI 52466 15.2 mumol/kg/hr, the other with the same volume of control vehicle. Limb and face tremor and myoclonus were delayed and the severity of signs reduced. No seizures were observed in the drug treated group before 91 ATA. EEG changes associated with exposure to pressure were not affected. It is concluded that antagonism at the AMPA/kainate receptor by GYKI 52466 and LY 293558 beneficially alters HPNS signs but in a manner which is dependent on both the drug and species being studied.", 
    "46": "1. Two 3-cyclopropyl carbonyl imidazobenzodiazepines, RU 33965 and RU 34030, were tested for their ability to modulate GABAA synaptic transmission in rat cerebellar slices. The action of the full benzodiazepine agonist RU 32007 and the inverse agonist Ro19-4603 were tested for comparison. 2. Extracellular recordings were made from the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellar slices and inhibition induced by just threshold electrical stimulation of the parallel fibres was bicuculline sensitive. 3. The major effect of RU 32007 when examined at 100 nM and 1 microM was to increase the GABAA mediated inhibition in the slice. 4. In contrast the major effect of the inverse agonist Ro19-4603 was to reduce the period of inhibition. 5. RU 33965 and RU 34030 at 10 and 1 microM respectively either had little effect on GABAA mediated inhibition or decreased it slightly. 6. RU 34030, 1 microM, abolished the agonist effect of RU 32007, 1 microM. 7. The effects of RU 32007 and Ro19-4603 were abolished by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. 8. It is concluded that both RU 33965 and RU 34030 have marginal inverse agonist properties.", 
    "47": "Aceclidine can dissociate accommodative and outflow facility responses in monkeys and humans. We sought to determine if different muscarinic receptor subtypes control outflow facility, accommodative and pupillary responses to aceclidine in the living rhesus monkey eye, as a possible basis for this separation. Each eye was cannulated with one branched and one unbranched needle. Baseline measurements (of outflow facility by two-level constant pressure perfusion; refraction by Hartinger coincidence refractometry and pupil diameter by vernier calipers) were recorded after anterior chamber exchange with (one eye) or without (opposite eye), muscarinic receptor subtype antagonist (pirenzepine, AF-DX 116 or 4-DAMP). The eyes were then exchanged a second time with these solutions plus added aceclidine. The response to aceclidine (the differences from baseline) in the presence or absence of antagonist were compared. The M3 muscarinic receptor subtype antagonist 4-DAMP was the most potent inhibitor of all three responses to aceclidine. The dissociation of accommodative, outflow facility and miotic responses to aceclidine in rhesus monkeys does not appear to be due to differences in the muscarinic receptor subtypes that can currently be distinguished pharmacologically.", 
    "48": "Patients with panic disorder plus agoraphobia had 8 weeks of drug treatment (alprazolam or placebo) plus psychological treatment (exposure or relaxation). At the end of treatment at week 8, 40 patients who had become much/very much improved rated how much their gains were attributable to medication or to their own efforts. During the tapering-off to week 16, and treatment-free follow-up to week 43, patients who at week 8 had attributed their gains to medication and felt less confident in coping without tablets had more severe withdrawal symptoms and greater loss of gains than did patients who at week 8 had attributed their gains to their own efforts during treatment. Baseline illness severity, greater age, higher expectations from drug treatment, and more side-effects of drugs during treatment all predicted more external attributions (i.e. to the effect of drugs) but did not independently predict relapse. Patients on alprazolam compared with placebo had more drug attributions. Though drug attributions predicted relapse in both alprazolam and placebo groups, predictions were stronger in the alprazolam group.", 
    "49": "In a controlled trial of alprazolam and exposure in 154 patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia, relations between panic, anticipatory anxiety, and phobic avoidance were examined. The three symptoms were independent of one another at baseline and improved largely independently during treatment; only early improvement in avoidance predicted global improvement after treatment. Global improvement was more related to reduction of avoidance than a decrease in panics. Panic was not a valuable outcome measure in panic disorder with agoraphobia.", 
    "50": "In previous studies, the author has reported both in vitro and in vivo sleep studies in which there were complex interactions between benzodiazepine hypnotics and the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker nifedipine. The author has also reported that microinjections of triazolam into the dorsal raphe nucleus of the rat result in enhancement of wakefulness. In the present study, nifedipine and triazolam were coadministered into this site. As previously was observed, triazolam produced a dose-dependent increase in sleep latency and a decrease in total sleep, primarily by reducing non-rapid-eye-movement sleep. Nifedipine had no effect on sleep when given by itself but prevented the alterations in sleep by triazolam. These various sleep effects were not associated with alterations in core temperature. These data are consistent with the view that aspect of the sleep-altering activity of triazolam involves interaction with voltage-dependent calcium channel activity.", 
    "51": "Similar clinical and biological features in lethal catatonia (LC) and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) suggest a relationship between both affections and common physiopathologic mechanisms. Pharmacological effects of several drugs--dopaminergic agonists, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine--suggest an impairment of several systems of neurotransmitters. We report the case of a young woman with infantile psychosis who developed catatonic syndrome worsened by neuroleptic treatment, arising the problem of the chronology of both affections. The evolution with treatment may partially explain the physiopathology. A 18-year old woman with an history of infantile psychosis, experienced insomnia, anorexia, paradoxical agitation developed after affective traumatism (mother's hospitalization). Chlorazepate (150 mg) remained inefficient and hospitalization was necessary. The patient was dumb, prostate in bed. She presented negativism, rigidity of the four limbs, catalepsia and hyperpyrexia (38.5 degrees C). Hepatic transaminases were increased (SGOT: 71 UI/l; N < 30). After cumulated dose of levomepromazine (100 mg) profuse sudation, thermic and cardiovascular instability, alteration of consciousness, major rigidity of limbs appeared. (Blood) hepatic transaminases and muscular enzymes increased. Bacteriological samples, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, CT-scan and EEG were normal. Within 48 hours after rehydratation and bromocriptine (30 mg per day) alteration of consciousness and autonomic disorders decreased but hyperpyrexia (38 degrees C) persisted. Biological parameters were normalized 10 days later. Negativism and psychomotor inertia remained. Lorazepam (3 mg per day) failed to be clinically beneficial. On carbamazepine (600 mg per day) she started speaking and moving spontaneously. Catalepsia disappeared but rigidity and anorexia persisted. Electroconvulsivotherapy (ECT) was necessary. After 2 shocks she started standing up, walking, taking food and speaking fluently.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "Sleep variables and psychiatric symptoms were investigated in 6 male chronic schizophrenic outpatients. The patients were being treated with benzodiazepine (BZD) hypnotics for more than 8 weeks, and BZDs were replaced with zopiclone (ZPC) 15 mg/day. Polysomnographic examinations, subjective sleep assessments and BPRS scoring were performed during BZD therapy and at the end of 8 weeks of ZPC therapy. The doses of neuroleptics and anticholinergic agents remained fixed throughout the study. The amount of slow-wave sleep (SWS) was markedly small and that of stage 1 sleep was moderately large during BZD therapy. The amount of stage 1 was smaller and that of stage 2 was larger during treatment with ZPC than BZDs. There were no significant change in the amount of SWS between the treatment. Half of the patients exhibited a sleep-onset REM period (SOREMP) during ZPC therapy. Both total BPRS score and negative symptom score were lower during treatment with ZPC than BZDs. These results suggest that ZPC may be more beneficial in treating schizophrenic insomnia than BZD hypnotics and that reduced SWS and SOREMP may be partly involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.", 
    "53": "Benzodiazepines have been prescribed for the treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) for nearly three decades due to their proven anxiolytic efficacy, despite a considerable side effect and abuse liability profile. A new class of compounds, the azapirones, have been developed as an alternative to benzodiazepine treatment. Ipsapirone is a novel anxiolytic azapirone which has high specificity for the 5-HT1A receptor and which has the potential for offering certain advantages over buspirone. The present 5-week study investigated three doses of ipsapirone (2.5mg, 5.0mg and 7.5mg tid) versus placebo in 267 GAD outpatients. Efficacy was evaluated using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Zung Anxiety Scale (Zung-A), and Clinical Global Impression (CGI). The study design consisted of a 1-week placebo run-in, a 4-week double-blind treatment period, and a 1-week placebo washout. The 5.0mg group demonstrated consistently superior improvement in all efficacy variables during the treatment period, with significant differences (p < 0.05) from placebo and, at times, the 2.5mg and 7.5mg groups. Incidence of adverse events, primarily dizziness, nausea, sedation, and asthenia, was found to be dose proportional, with significant increase in the 7.5mg group, which may account for the diminished effectiveness seen with this dose. Our results suggest that ipsapirone may represent a viable treatment for GAD.", 
    "54": "Screening for benzodiazepines is an important component of many drug testing programs. Current immunochemical methods are limited by a lack of sensitivity to many of the 35 forms of benzodiazepines available and because the antibodies used are insensitive to the glucuronic acid conjugates that constitute the major metabolites in urine. The Triage Panel for Drugs of Abuse (Biosite Diagnostics), a new screening device, is a competitive immunoassay containing monoclonal antibodies directed against glucuronide metabolites of benzodiazepines. We tested this device on 326 urine specimens, which were also tested by two other immunoassay methods (FPIA and EMIT) and by GC/MS. We found a sensitivity of 97.5% and a specificity of 94.3% for the Triage assay when it was applied to a population in which approximately 50% of the specimens were positive; a distribution of eight different benzodiazepines was found in the positive samples. Other immunoassays performed with lower sensitivity or specificity or both. We found no significant difference between two analysts using the Triage test. We conclude that the Triage method represents a superior method for benzodiazepine screening when compared with other immunoassay methods.", 
    "55": "1,000 blood samples from drivers tested for alcohol were screened specifically for active constituents and metabolites of medicines of the benzodiazepine class. 42 blood samples contained benzodiazepines and a total of eight different active constituents were detected. The active constituents of Valium, Vegesan or Tranxilium, Lexotanil and Seresta have to be dealt with primarily. In addition to benzodiazepine 35 samples showed an alcohol level of over 0.08%. This raised the question of whether the benzodiazepine level measured in the blood samples would intensify the effect of the alcohol. Four categories were formed in order to be able to compare the levels of the various benzodiazepines. According to this categorisation the benzodiazepine concentration was classed as very high in 4 cases, high in 7 cases, moderate in 26 cases and low in 10 cases.", 
    "56": "Essential tremor (ET) is typically 4 to 12 Hz frequency, absent at rest, maximal during maintenance of a posture, attenuated during movement and often accentuated at the termination of movement. Prevalence in Americans is 300 to 415 per 100,000 population, and it is frequently disabling. There is controversy about the central or peripheral origin of ET. There is no specific diagnostic test for ET; the diagnosis is made clinically. Ethanol is the most effective suppressor of ET. Treatment is with beta-adrenergic blockers, primidone, and benzodiazepines. The first systematic description of essential tremor (ET) was 100 years ago by Dana in 1887, who regarded the disorder as a hereditary tremor that was a form of \"motor neurosis.\" Most subsequent contributions to the English literature consisted predominantly of case reports until Critchley's exhaustive survey of the subject in 1949. The disorder has been variously termed essential, benign essential, hereditary, familial, idiopathic, juvenile, presenile or senile tremor.", 
    "57": "Lorazepam and alprazolam produced dose-dependent decreases in the rate of fixed-ratio (FR) 20 schedules of food presentation in which either a nose-poke or a lever-press defined the operant and under a fixed-interval (FI) 2-min lever-press schedule of food presentation. In contrast, under FI 2-min and differential reinforcement of low response rate (DRL) 20-s schedules of nose-poke responding for food, intermediate doses of alprazolam produced increases in response rate. Lorazepam, however, only decreased overall response rates under the FI schedule and produced some increases in responding under the DRL schedule. Acute in vivo benzodiazepine receptor binding experiments showed that low to intermediate doses of alprazolam produced significant increases in the binding of [3H]flumazenil in all brain areas tested, while lorazepam produced increases in the brain stem only. The acute effects on binding produced by both drugs were positively and significantly correlated with their acute effects on response rate only under the FR lever-press procedure. These results indicate that the effects of benzodiazepines on in vivo binding may be related to their effects on FR lever-press responding.", 
    "58": "F 2692, a pyridazine derivative, has little affinity for benzodiazepine receptors, yet in two animal tests its anxiolytic effects have been reported to be reversed by benzodiazepine antagonists. In the rat social interaction test, after 5 days of IP treatment, F 2692 (3, 10, or 30 mg/kg) produced greater increases in social interaction than diazepam (0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg). A comparison of acute and 5 day administration of F 2692 showed rapidly developing tolerance at all doses. The acute anxiolytic effects of F 2692 (1 mg/kg) were reversed by the benzodiazepine antagonists flumazenil (4 mg/kg) and ZK 93426 (4 mg/kg). We, therefore, examined whether F 2692 was active at a benzodiazepine binding site (the diazepam-insensitive portion of [3H]-Ro 15-4513) to which flumazenil but not flunitrazepam binds. However, F 2692 (10(-9) to 10(-4) M) was without effect on this binding. Thus, F 2692 has anxiolytic actions in the social interaction test, that are greater than those of diazepam, and which can be reversed by benzodiazepine antagonists. However, the site of action of the compound remains unknown.",

We compared the gastrin/CCK-B receptor-blocking properties of this compound with those of the racemate (mixture of YM022 and its S-form), its enantiomer (S-form), L-365, 260 and Cl-988 in vitro and in vivo. YM022 replaced specific binding of [125I]CCK-8 to rat brain gastrin/CCK-B receptors in a stereoselective and competitive manner. The Ki value of YM022 for gastrin/CCK-B receptors in brain were estimated to be 0.068 nM. The racemate, the S-form of YM022, L-365,260 and Cl-988 also replaced gastrin/CCK-B receptor binding, with Ki values of 0.11, 140, 19 and 6.3 nM, respectively. The affinity of YM022 for gastrin/CCK-B receptor was more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than that for rat pancreatic CCK-A receptor and various other receptors, such as benzodiazepine. In vivo, intravenous (i.v.) administration of YM022 inhibited pentagastrin-induced gastric acid secretion in anesthetized rats, with an ED50 value of 0.0078 mumol/kg. Inhibition by the S-form of YM022 was only 33.8% even at the relatively high dose of 1 mumol/kg i.v. L-365,260 (1-10 mumol/kg i.v.) and Cl-988 (0.3-3 mumol/kg i.v.) also antagonized acid secretion induced by pentagastrin, with ED50 values of 4.23 and 1.01 mumol/kg, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "60": "Abecarnil, a novel beta-carboline anxiolytic, has been shown to possess potent anxiolytic and anticonvulsant activities with weak or no sedative and ataxic effects in relevant animal models. In the present study, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and amnesic effects of abecarnil after single and repeated treatments in rats were compared with those of diazepam. Both abecarnil (0.52-10 mg/kg, p.o.) and diazepam (20 and 50 mg/kg, p.o.) exhibited significant anticonflict effects in the water-lick test. Neither abecarnil (5 mg/kg, p.o.) nor diazepam (50 mg/kg, p.o.) produced any tolerance to anticonflict effects after 14 days of repeated treatment. Both abecarnil (5-50 mg/kg, p.o.) and diazepam (20 and 50 mg/kg, p.o.) exhibited significant anticonvulsant effects against pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure. The anticonvulsant effects of abecarnil (5 mg/kg, p.o.) were not attenuated during 14 days of repeated treatment, but diazepam (20 and 50 mg/kg, p.o.) produced tolerance to anticonvulsant effects after 5 days of repeated treatment. In the three-panel runway task, abecarnil at 5 mg/kg, p.o. impaired only working memory, but diazepam at 20 mg/kg, p.o. impaired working memory and at 50 mg/kg, p.o. markedly impaired reference and working memories. The amnesic effects of abecarnil disappeared rapidly within 2 to 3 days of repeated treatment, whereas that of diazepam decreased rapidly but persisted during 14 days of repeated treatment. Thus, chronic abecarnil was found to exhibit persistent anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects without any amnesic effects, in contrast to chronic diazepam.", 
    "61": "In order to examine the effects of benzodiazepines on response execution by the left and right hemisphere, flunitrazepam (1 mg) or placebo was administered to healthy, right handed volunteers in two separate experiments. In experiment 1, drug was administered daily during a treatment period of 8 days, and subjects were instructed to fixate vision centrally and to execute laterally directed manual responses corresponding to the position of visual stimuli presented in either the right or left hemifield. Experiment 2 was performed with a single dose and cross-over design, and subjects responded to the laterally presented visual stimuli by key press of a centrally positioned response device, i. e. neither detection of position of the stimulus in space nor response selection was required before initiation of the response. In experiment 1, intake of flunitrazepam generally increased reaction time more during response execution by the left as compared to the right hemisphere, and the most pronounced effect was observed on responses with the right hand, directed across the body axis, to visual stimuli presented in the left visual field. In contrast to these observations, in experiment 2, flunitrazepam impaired responses with the right and left hand practically to the same extent. Together, the results indicate that benzodiazepines may affect manual responses executed by left and right hemisphere differently, and that this asymmetry may be related to a stimulus-response compatibility effect in tasks that require response selection.", 
    "62": "Deficits in early stages of information processing, specifically the inability to \"disattend\" irrelevant stimuli and to selectively allocate processing resources (i.e., hyperattention), have been associated with the development of psychotic symptoms. Opposite deficits, i.e., the failure to attend and select stimuli, and to divide attention (i.e., hypoattention), represent a major variable in the development of dementia. The hypothesis that hyperattention and hypoattention are mediated via cortical cholinergic hyperactivity and hypoactivity, respectively, is discussed. Several lines of evidence support the role of cholinergic hyperactivity in the development of psychotic symptoms, including the therapeutic effects of anticholinergic drugs in schizophrenic patients, the psychotic effects of chronic exposure to irreversible cholinesterase inhibitors, and the worsening of psychotic symptoms as a result of the treatment with cholinomimetic compounds. The potent impairments of attentional abilities as a result of the administration of muscarinic antagonists in intact subjects, and the attentional effects of cholinomimetic compounds in demented patients are two examples of the evidence that supports the role of cholinergic hypofunction in the cognitive impairments of dementia. A neuronal model of dopamine-GABAergic modulation of cortical acetylcholine is proposed on the basis of evidence indicating that nucleus accumbens dopamine, via a GABAergic pathway to the substantia innominata of the basal forebrain, modulates cortical acetylcholine release. The available evidence confirms several predictions derived from this model, including the dopaminergic regulation of cortical acetylcholine (ACh) release, the bidirectional modulation of this release by benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) agonists and inverse agonists, and the antipsychotic effects of BZR agonists. Bidirectional deviations in the activity of cortical cholinergic inputs are hypothesized to represent a major neuronal substrate of the attentional dysfunctions associated with, or even underlying, the development of psychotic symptoms and dementia.", 
    "63": "Two mutants of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), Tyr-188-->His and Glu-138-->Arg have been prepared and their catalytic properties and sensitivities to inhibitors studied. As compared to wild type RT, a reduction in catalytic efficiency and turn over number was observed, especially for the Tyr-188-->His mutant. The non-nucleoside inhibitors nevirapine, L-697,661 and 9-Cl-TIBO caused a mixed type of inhibition of RT (Arg-138) with respect to substrate, and with the exception of a non-competitive inhibition by nevirapine, also a mixed type of inhibition of RT (His-188). Foscarnet (PFA) caused a non-competitive type of inhibition of RT (Arg-138) and a mixed inhibition of RT (His-188). The inhibition by ddG-TP was competitive with both mutant RTs. Inhibition by nevirapine gave IC50 values of 0.15, 0.23 and 0.72 microM; by 9-Cl-TIBO of 0.20, 2.50 and 10.3 microM; by L-697,661 of 0.064, 0.28 and 0.60 microM; by ddGTP of 0.13, 0.14 and 0.02 microM; by PFA of 17.0, 48.0 and 15.0 microM for RT wt, RT (Arg-138) and RT (His-188), respectively.", 
    "64": "The glutamate antagonistic effects of NBQX [2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline] and GYKI 52466 [1-(4-amino-phenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methyl-endioxyl-5H-2,3-benzodiaze pine] were compared on inward current responses of cultured superior collicular and hippocampal neurones with the whole cell patch clamp technique. Both NBQX (8 microM) and GYKI 52466 (33 microM) selectively reduced responses to AMPA [(S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazolepropionic acid, 50 microM] and kainate (50 microM) whilst having little effect on responses to NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate, 100 microM). The effects of the two antagonists on the kinetics of AMPA (50 microM) responses were, however, very different--NBQX dramatically slowed the rise time of responses so that peak currents (IC50 60.4 +/- 4.2 nM) were markedly more effected than desensitized plateau currents (IC50 706 +/- 99 nM) whereas GYKI 52466 antagonized plateau responses (IC50 4.44 +/- 0.21 microM) somewhat more than peak responses (IC50 6.87 +/- 0.46 microM) and had only marginal effects on kinetics. In fact, low concentrations of NBQX (50-250 nM) actually potentiated plateau AMPA responses--an effect likely to be due to a reduction in the degree of AMPA-induced desensitization. Similar effects on response kinetics, were seen with kainate such that the IC50s for NBQX in antagonizing initial and plateau components of current responses to kainate 400 microM were 18.1 +/- 2.9 nM and 298 +/- 27 nM respectively whereas the IC50s for GYKI 52466 against kainate 50 microM were 17.3 +/- 1.8 microM and 15.5 +/- 3.3 microM respectively. These differences are likely to be due to the different modes of action of the two antagonists--NBQX shifted kainate concentration responses curves to the right in a parallel fashion indicative of competitive antagonism whereas the effects of GYKI 52466 were largely noncompetitive. There was, however, some indication for a small allosteric influence of GYKI 52466 on the affinity of the glutamate recognition site of the AMPA/kainate receptor. Estimation of Kbs using the Cheng-Prussoff relationship revealed little difference in the affinity of NBQX in antagonizing plateau responses to AMPA (Kb 23.2 nM) and kainate (Kb 57.1 nM) and indicate that the effects of these two agonists are mediated at a common receptor under the experimental conditions used. Moreover, the differential effects of NBQX on peak and plateau components of AMPA (50 microM) responses was associated with a desensitization-induced, paradoxical increase in the agonist affinity and was probably not due to any change in the affinity of NBQX.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "65": "Polyclonal antiserum to a new voltage-dependent anion channel protein (B-36 VDAC) isolated during the purification of the GABAA receptor from bovine cerebral cortex was used to determine the localization of this protein in immunocytochemical preparations of cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampal formation of rat, cow and human. The labeling was present in the Purkinje cells and some cells of the molecular layer of the rat cerebellum, as well as in pyramidal and non-pyramidal cells of the rat and human cerebral cortex; the labeling outlined the membrane surface. In the rat granule cells of the dentate gyrus and the pyramidal cells, the labelling was observed within the cells. These results indicate that the B-36 VDAC protein is heterogeneously distributed among different cerebral regions in different species and suggest that this protein would be associated with the alpha-1 subunit of the GABAA receptor (benzodiazepine binding sites).",

    "67": "The prophylactic and therapeutic effects of a potent cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist, L-364,718, on acute pancreatitis induced by caerulein were evaluated, analyzing morphologic and functional pancreatic parameters jointly. Edematous pancreatitis was induced by four subcutaneous injections of caerulein (20 micrograms/kg) in rats at 1-h intervals. Prophylactic administration of L-364,718 (0.1 mg/kg) prevented rise in serum amylase levels, interstitial edema, vacuolization, and impairment of pancreatic enzyme secretion that accompany caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. After 7 days, a spontaneous regression of the morphologic alterations caused by caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis occurs; however, recovery of the secretory function of the pancreas was only reached after this period of time when L-364,718 was administered therapeutically (0.1 mg/kg/day). Prophylactically or therapeutically administered, L-364,718 exerts a beneficial effect on caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis, indicating that CCK (exogenous or endogenous) plays an important role in the development of this pathology.",

    "72": "S-2720 and other members of the quinoline/quinoxaline class of HIV-1-specific nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) select for a glycine to glutamate substitution at residue 190 (Gly 190 Glu) of the reverse transcriptase (RT), when drug-resistant viruses are generated in cell culture. This mutation has not been described to appear upon selection for resistant viral variants using derivatives of any other class of NNRTIs. Notably, the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of the Gly 190 Glu mutant enzyme is drastically diminished with respect to the wild-type RT. We describe here the effects of other amino acid substitutions at position 190 of the RT that were introduced by using site-directed mutagenesis. Polymerase activities and sensitivities to inhibition by a number of NNRTIs were determined for the different RT mutants. In general, an inverse correlation was found between the enzymatic activity and increasing length of the side chain, whereas the size of the residue and the level of resistance to NNRTIs appeared to be positively related. Double mutants, which contain the Gly 190 Glu mutation together with substitutions that confer resistance to other RT inhibitors, were all shown to possess severely diminished polymerase activity.", 
    "73": "The capabilities of cytochrome P4503A4 (CYP3A4), CYP3A5, and fetal hepatic microsomes containing CYP3A7 to metabolize midazolam were investigated using human hepatic microsomes and purified CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Under initial rate conditions and high substrate concentration (400 microM midazolam), variability among eighteen human liver microsomal samples was 30- and 16- fold for 1'- and 4-hydroxylation of midazolam, respectively. Exclusion of two samples isolated from patients previously administered barbiturates reduced the inter-individual variability to 10.5- and 6.0-fold for 1'- and 4-hydroxylation, respectively. Six fetal hepatic microsomal samples showed 10-fold variation in both 1'-hydroxymidazolam and 4-hydroxymidazolam formation rates. The rates of formation of 4-hydroxymidazolam and 1'-hydroxymidazolam from midazolam by adult samples containing only CYP3A4 and by fetal liver samples were highly correlated (r2 = 0.99 and 0.97, P < 0.01, respectively). The rates of formation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam and 4-hydroxymidazolam from midazolam (400 microM) by adult samples that contained only CYP3A4 were correlated significantly (P < 0.01) with the ability of the samples to N-demethylate erythromycin (r2 = 0.95 and 0.92, respectively). 6 beta-hydroxylate testosterone (r2 = 0.96 and 0.96, respectively), and the CYP3A4 content of the samples (r2 = 0.89 and 0.86, respectively). Microsomal samples containing CYP3A5 in addition to CYP3A4 exhibited a significantly greater ratio of 1'-hydroxymidazolam to 4-hydroxymidazolam compared with samples containing only CYP3A4 or CYP3A7 (P < 0.001). Purified CYP3A5 in a reconstituted system, consisting of dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, cytochrome b5, and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, and an NADPH-regenerating system displayed a 2-fold greater rate of 1'-hydroxymidazolam formation and a similar rate of 4-hydroxymidazolam formation compared with a reconstituted system with CYP3A4. In conclusion, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and fetal microsomes containing CYP3A7 catalyze 1'- and 4-hydroxylation of midazolam with the ratio of these metabolites indicative of the CYP3A form.", 
    "74": "Two polyclonal antibodies were raised against the gamma 3-subunit of gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptors. These antibodies were able to precipitate GABAA receptors from brain membrane extracts, and the precipitated receptors exhibited benzodiazepine binding properties that were dramatically different from those of receptors precipitated by anti-gamma 2 antibodies. The anti-gamma 3 antibodies were used for immunopurification of GABAA receptors containing gamma 3-subunits. Western blot analysis of the immunopurified GABAA receptors indicated that the gamma 3-subunit exhibits an apparent molecular mass of 43-46 kDa. Furthermore, in addition to gamma 3-subunits, beta 2/3-, alpha 1-, alpha 2-, alpha 3-, alpha 4-, and alpha 6-subunits could be detected in immunoaffinity column eluates from total brain and cerebellum, respectively. These data indicate that gamma 3-subunits can combine with most alpha-subunits to form a multiplicity of GABAA receptors with distinct pharmacology.", 
    "75": "The effects of the cholecystokinin octapeptide-related peptide, ceruletide (CER), on the in vivo release and metabolism of dopamine (DA) in the medial prefrontal cortex were examined in awake, freely moving rats, using in vivo microdialysis. Subcutaneously administered CER (200 micrograms/kg) increased extracellular levels of DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and homovanillic acid (HVA), indicating that extracellular levels of DOPAC and HVA may reflect DA release in the medial prefrontal cortex. Bilateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomy markedly attenuated the CER-induced effect, but did not abolish it completely. CER (10(-7) and 10(-10) M), applied locally via the dialysis tube, had no effect on the extracellular levels of either DOPAC or HVA. The CCK-A receptor antagonist, L-364,718 (3 mg/kg, i.p.), completely prevented CER-induced increases in the extracellular levels of DOPAC and HVA. The CCK-B antagonist, L-365,260 (3 mg/kg, i.p.), however, given 1 h before the CER treatment, slightly attenuated the CER-induced increase in the extracellular levels of DOPAC, but not the CER-induced increase in HVA, 60-180 min after the treatment. These findings indicate that systemically administered CER modulates the in vivo release and metabolism of DA in the medial prefrontal cortex. We suggest that systemically administered CER exerts its action on both vagal afferent nerves and the area postrema via CCK-A receptors, thus enhancing the in vivo release and metabolism of DA in the medial prefrontal cortex.", 
    "76": "A confirmation procedure for the identification and quantitation of various benzodiazepines in urine is presented. The urine sample is first hydrolyzed enzymatically because of the glucuronide conjugation of some benzodiazepine metabolites, then extracted using bonded-phase columns. After elution into an organic solvent, the samples are evaporated, converted to the trimethylsilyl ether derivatives and analyzed by electron ionization GC-MS. Quantitation was performed using selected-ion monitoring for each benzodiazepine using prazepam as the internal standard.

CMZ is clinically used as a racemate. Enantiomer resolution of CMZ and 11 of its derivatives was studied by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using 5 different chiral stationary phase (CSP) columns. Enantiomers of 10 compounds were resolved by at least one of the 5 CSP's tested. Enantiomers of two other compounds, which have either one or two hydroxymethyl groups at the carbamoyl nitrogen, were either not resolved or resolved with very low efficiency. However, enantiomers of the hydroxymethyl derivatives were resolved via base-catalyzed dehydroxymethylation. In vitro metabolism of racemic CMZ by human liver microsomes was found to be enantioselective. Major metabolites were isolated by normal-phase and reversed-phase HPLC and further characterized by ultraviolet absorption and circular dichroism spectral analyses, and by chiral stationary phase HPLC analysis. Following an in vitro incubation of rac-CMZ, the unmetabolized CMZ was found to be enriched in (S)-CMZ, indicating that the R-enantiomer was enantioselectively metabolized. Metabolites were formed primarily by hydroxylation and demethylation of the methyl groups at the C3 side chain. All metabolites were found to be optically active, enriched in either the S-enantiomer or the R-enantiomer.", 
    "78": "The deproteinization of human plasma was carried out using a hydroxy apatite cartridge as a precolumn. After human plasma had been passed through the cartridge followed by suitable elution, protein-free eluate was obtained within only 1 min without the need for centrifugation. Deproteinization was evaluated by the determination of albumin, gamma-globulin and transferrin in the eluate by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection. Determination of theophylline and diazepam in human plasma was performed by HPLC with UV detection. The proposed method was suitable for the determination of these two drugs in human plasma, because it is simple and rapid (retention time of each drugs approximately 15 min) and microamounts of sample are required (50-100 microliters). The calibration graphs for theophylline and diazepam were linear in the range 0.1-10 micrograms and 0.1-65 ng, respectively. Recoveries of both drugs were over 90% by the standard addition method.", 
    "79": "The present study examined the mechanisms by which GYKI 52466 (1-(amino-phenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methyldioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine) exerts its muscle relaxant effects. Intrathecal injection of the specific N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (-)-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate (AP7, 50-500 nmol) and systemic application of the benzodiazepine diazepam (0.2-5 mg/kg) dose dependently reduced the integrated area of the polysynaptic flexor reflex without affecting the monoxynaptic H-reflex. In contrast, intrathecal administration of the non-NMDA receptor antagonist 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX, 0.1-10 nmol) depressed the H-reflex in a dose-dependent manner without affecting the flexor reflex. The depressant effect of GYKI 52466 on the flexor reflex was reduced by coadministration with flumazenil (5 mg/kg i.p.), an antagonist at the benzodiazepine receptor, whereas coadministration of the non-NMDA receptor agonist alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-tertbutyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (ATPA, 0.1 pmol) with GYKI 52466 attenuated the reduction of the H-reflex induced by GYKI 52466. The chosen doses of flumazenil and ATPA did not affect spinal reflex transmission when given alone. These data suggest that GYKI 52466 depresses spinal reflex transmission via an action on non-NMDA receptors and on benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "80": "Using a two-lever operant drug discrimination procedure, rats were trained to discriminate the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, flesinoxan (0.5 mg/kg i.p.), from saline. Hereafter, several non-serotonergic drugs were tested in generalization and antagonism tests. The flesinoxan stimulus did not generalize to the stimuli of either the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine, the dopamine receptor agonist, apomorphine, the dopamine receptor antagonists, haloperidol and pimozide, the benzodiazepine receptor agonist, chlordiazepoxide, nor to the peripherally acting vasodilator, hydralazine. In antagonism studies, prazosin, haloperidol, pimozide and the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, idazoxan, failed to block the flesinoxan stimulus. In substitution tests, however, flesinoxan partially generalized to idazoxan and completely to the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine. The affinities of yohimbine and idazoxan for the 5-HT1A receptor may explain the latter result. The present findings suggest that the central mechanism through which flesinoxan exerts its discriminative stimulus effects does not involve alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors, dopamine and benzodiazepine receptors. Finally, the results with the blood pressure lowering agents, hydralazine, clonidine and prazosin do not support the suggestion that the centrally mediated blood pressure lowering effects of flesinoxan contribute to its internal stimulus effect.", 
    "81": "We investigated the effects of low-level lead exposure on the postnatal development of cholinergic muscarinic receptors (mAChR) and a cholinergic marker enzyme cholineacetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in the rat septum and hippocampus. Rat pups were maternally lead-exposed by giving 0.2% lead acetate in drinking water to dams from one week before parturition (gestational day 16) through weaning at postnatal day 28. The lead-exposed litters had blood Pb in the range 20 micrograms/dl and tissue Pb < 0.2 micrograms/g in both the septum and hippocampus. Associated with this level of lead exposure there was a significant 30-40% reduction in the ChAT activity in the septa and hippocampi of PN7 through PN28 animals. In contrast, the levels of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity, a GABAergic neuron marker enzyme, were not altered in either brain region. Associated with the selective reduction of ChAT activity there was a parallel 30-40% reduction of the [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate, [3H]AF-DX 384, and [3H]pirenzepine binding in the septum, however muscarinic ligand binding in the hippocampus of lead exposed animals was not affected. These results indicate preferential vulnerability of septal cholinergic neurons to adverse effects of low-level Pb exposure and suggest that impaired expression of muscarinic receptors and disruption of muscarinic transmission in the septum may be an important factor in cognitive and learning deficits associated with developmental low-level lead exposure.", 
    "82": "The effect of chronic ethanol administration on [3H]zolpidem binding was measured in rat brain. [3H]Zolpidem selectively labels gamma-aminobutyric acidA-benzodiazepine type 1 receptors, which are highly correlated with ethanol-sensitive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses in brain. Recombinant expression studies have suggested that this GABAA receptor subtype requires the expression of alpha 1 subunits and is not selectively labeled by classic GABAergic ligands. Since chronic ethanol administration reduces alpha 1 subunit mRNA and polypeptide levels, we investigated whether alterations in [3H]zolpidem binding would also be detected. Chronic ethanol administration did not reduce [3H]zolpidem binding. Instead small, but reproducible, increases in [3H]zolpidem binding density were detected in cortex and cerebellum with no change in affinity. No alterations in [3H]zolpidem binding to striatum and hippocampus were observed. These findings suggest that chronic ethanol administration may have differential effects on [3H]zolpidem binding sites and alpha 1 subunit expression. Alterations in alpha 1 subunit expression following chronic ethanol administration may involve other GABAA receptor subtypes or high affinity [3H]zolpidem binding may be dependent on the expression of additional GABAA receptor subunits.", 
    "83": "Cholecystokinin receptors on GH3 rat anterior pituitary cells have been characterised using radioligand binding and Ca2+ mobilisation. [125I]Bolton Hunter CCK-8s (BHCCK) bound dose dependently to GH3 cells (Kd 85 pM, Bmax 23 fmol/mg protein). Competition curves with CCK-8s (IC50 2.4 nM), pentagastrin (IC50 25 nM) and devazepide (IC50 820 nM), were consistent with a population predominantly of CCKB receptors. Binding of [125I]BHCCK to lysed cells was inhibited by 10 microM GTP-gamma-S and 10 microM GppNHp, suggesting the receptor was linked to a guanine nucleotide binding protein. Intracellular Ca2+ mobilisation was a functional consequence of CCKB receptor activation in GH3 cells using the fluorescent dye fura-2. CCK-8s (0.1 nM-1 microM) and the selective CCKB receptor agonist, pentagastrin, (0.1 nM-100 microM) dose dependently increased intracellular Ca2+ with a similar maximal increase of 2.85-fold and 2.77-fold respectively. Response to a submaximal dose of the CCKB receptor agonist pentagastrin (100 nM) was dose dependently blocked by the CCKB receptor antagonist L-365,260. GH3 cells may therefore provide a useful model to study CCKB receptor coupling in a pituitary cell line.", 
    "84": "The effects of propofol, pentobarbital, alphaxalone, etomidate and diazepam on t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) binding to membrane preparations from rat cerebral cortex were studied in the absence of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Addition of low concentrations (3-10 microM) of propofol to washed membrane preparations (devoid of GABA) markedly enhanced [35S]TBPS binding (maximal enhancement, 85%), whereas higher concentrations (50-100 microM) inhibited this parameter. Diazepam also enhanced [35S]TBPS binding in this preparation (maximal enhancement, 38%). In contrast, pentobarbital, alphaxalone and etomidate decreased [35S]TBPS binding in a concentration-dependent manner. The propofol-induced increase in [35S]TBPS binding in washed membranes was completely reversed by the addition of GABA at a concentration (0.3 microM) that alone did not modify [35S]TBPS binding (78% increase with 10 microM propofol alone, 33% decrease in the additional presence of GABA). The ability of GABA to reverse the effect of propofol on [35S]TBPS binding in washed membranes was shared by pentobarbital (200 microM) and alphaxalone (3 microM); etomidate (20 microM) only partially antagonized the effect of propofol. Diazepam at a concentration (30 microM) that alone had no effect on [35S]TBPS binding failed to modify the propofol-induced increase in [35S]TBPS binding, whereas at a concentration (3 microM) that alone increased [35S]TBPS binding the effect of diazepam was additive with that of propofol. The addition of bicuculline to washed membranes failed to abolish the increase in [35S]TBPS binding induced by propofol or diazepam, but completely antagonized the effects of pentobarbital, alphaxalone and etomidate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "85": "The selectivity of the 2,3-benzodiazepine compound, GYKI 52466, was tested on wide dynamic range (WDR) dorsal horn neurons of the rat spinal cord. Using extracellular recordings, neurons were characterized by stimulation with noxious and innocuous intensities of the receptive field. In most cells, responses to iontophoretically applied (R,S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) or kainic acid (KA), but not N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), were profoundly reduced by iontophoretic ejection of GYKI 52466. The inhibition usually lasted for 5-30 min following application of GYKI 52466. In a few neurons, responses to NMDA were also decreased by GYKI 52466. Responses to both noxious and innocuous mechanical stimulation were reduced in the presence of GYKI 52466. The results provide evidence for the selective inhibition by GYKI 52466 of AMPA/KA receptor-mediated functions and support the involvement of these receptors in spinal mechanical nociception.", 
    "86": "The relative roles of receptors for AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid) in spinal nociceptive and non-nociceptive transmission were studied on dorsal horn wide dynamic range neurones in alpha-chloralose-anaesthetized spinalized rats. The effects of systemically administered competitive and non-competitive AMPA antagonists (the quinoxalinedione NBQX and the 2,3-benzodiazepine GYKI 53655) were examined on responses to peripheral noxious heat and non-noxious tap stimuli as well as to iontophoretic AMPA and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). Both NBQX and GYKI 53655 dose-dependently reduced responses to peripheral stimuli and to AMPA. GYKI 53655, the more selective antagonist of AMPA vs NMDA, decreased heat and tap responses to the same extent. The results indicate that AMPA receptors play a significant and equal, but not exclusive, role in mediating nociceptive and non-nociceptive spinal transmission.", 
    "87": "To clarify experimentally whether benzodiazepine (Bz) receptor or regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) imaging is more sensitive in the detection of epileptic foci, we simultaneously examined the Bz receptor and rCBF distribution changes in hippocampal kindled rabbits with in vivo double tracer autoradiography using 125I-labeled Ro 16-0154 (125I-Iomazenil) and 99mTc-labeled hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO). In visual and quantitative analyses, 125I-Iomazenil accumulation in brain slices extracted after the completion of the kindling was markedly and extensively decreased in the kindled right CA1 region, and further in the right temporal lobe, dentate gyrus, CA2, CA4, and bilateral CA3 regions, regarded as the propagated sites of seizure discharges. 99mTc-HMPAO accumulation was much more slightly and less extensively decreased in the right CA1, frontal, temporal and dentate gyri. Further, this decrease in 125I-Iomazenil accumulation was not due to neuropathological abnormalities, which consisted only of tissue damage corresponding to electrode track in the CA1. Both the kindled and propagated sites are known to have a possibility of acquiring epileptogenesis as experimental epileptic foci. These results suggest that Bz receptor imaging is much more sensitive in the detection of epileptic foci than rCBF imaging, and therefore that Bz receptor imaging is useful in clinical epilepsy.", 
    "88": "7-Nitroindazole induced concentration-dependent relaxation of precontracted rabbit aorta, dog middle cerebral artery, rat anococcygeus muscle and rat stomach fundus. Relaxations to 7-nitroindazole in rabbit aorta were unaffected by nitric oxide synthase blockade or endothelial removal. 6-Nitroindazole also caused concentration-dependent relaxation in dog middle cerebral artery and rabbit aorta, being equipotent with 7-nitroindazole in both tissues. These data suggest that indazole derivatives can induce an endothelium- and nitric oxide synthase-independent relaxation of smooth muscle in vitro.", 
    "89": "We investigated whether platelet-activating factor (PAF) alters colonic tissue levels of substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), two neuropeptides that regulate colonic motility. Left colons were harvested from NZ White Rabbits and underwent vascular perfusion via the inferior mesenteric artery. Strain gauge transducers were sewn onto the serosal surface of the colon to evaluate colonic motility. Colons were perfused with either buffered saline alone or with 5.0 x 10(-5) M PAF. PAF administration increased tissue VIP and substance P levels and decreased the force of colonic contractions. Pretreatment with WEB-2170 or alprazolam decreased concentrations of both tissue neuropeptides, and decreased the force of colonic contractions and minute motility index. These results suggest that both VIP and substance P are stimulated by PAF and may participate in colonic dysmotility during inflammatory states.", 
    "90": "Maintained stress produces a constellation of neurochemical and hormonal changes that involve both the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and a variety of brain regions. Long-term stress can produce psychological and physiologic consequences including anxiety, depression, hypertension, impaired immune system function, and an increased risk of cancer and coronary heart disease. Negative responses to perceived job-related stress usually occur when an individual has relatively little control over the means to meet high job demands. Among the approaches to reduce workplace stress, changing the coping strategies of challenged employees, particularly by increasing decision latitude, can significantly relieve both the psychological and physiologic consequences. Nevertheless, behavioral intervention is not invariably successful, and benzodiazepines are often prescribed to manage inadequately alleviated anxiety. Evidence that excessive serotonergic neurotransmission may underlie anxiety has prompted the use of compounds such as buspirone. This partial agonist of the 5-HT1A receptor has been demonstrated to be as effective as benzodiazepines in controlling generalized anxiety symptoms and to have a more favorable side-effect profile.", 
    "91": "Flumazenil rapidly and effectively terminates the actions of benzodiazepines by competitive antagonism at specific benzodiazepine receptors in the central nervous system. This article describes the pharmacology of flumazenil and reviews the indications for its use and the adverse effects which may follow its administration.", 
    "92": "The dependence potential of the putative 5-HT(1A) agonist anxiolytic S-20499 was assessed in rats in a study in which the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (CDP) was used as a \"positive control\". S-20499 was administered b.i.d. (at 10.00 and 16.00h) for 21 days, at constant doses of either 0.5, 3 or 18mg/kg i.p. Subsequently, spontaneous withdrawal from S-20499 was studied over 7 days. Acutely, S-20499 decreased body weight and food intake and complete tolerance developed to these effects. When S-20499 was withdrawn there was no evidence of any effect on body weight or food intake. CDP was also administered b.i.d. (at 10.00 and 16.00h) for 21 days at doses escalated from 10 to 30mg/kg i.p. CDP differed from S-20499 in some of its acute effects, stimulating body weight and food intake. In contrast to S-20499 withdrawal, CDP withdrawal induced weight loss and aphagia. Acutely, S-20499 resembled CDP in inducing hypothermia. Full tolerance developed to this effect of both drugs. However, only CDP withdrawal induced hyperthermia. Thus S-20499 appeared to be devoid of benzodiazepine-like dependence potential after administration for a relatively long period of time, at doses that are substantially greater than \"anxiolytic doses\" in rats.", 
    "93": "Intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, and intracerebral blood volume changes were observed in 43 patients with volumetric intracranial processes (intracranial hematomas, tumors) during general rohypnol anesthesia. Intracranial and cerebral perfusion pressures were found to correlate with intracerebral blood volume. Rohypnol anesthesia decreased intracranial pressure by 25% due to reduced arterial blood influx into the head, mechanisms responsible for autoregulation of cerebral circulation being intact.", 
    "94": "Originally only intended as an anti-epileptic carbamazepine has nowadays a multitude of applications in the treatment of neurological and psychiatric diseases. It is also being used for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Its pharmacological properties and side-effects are well known and very effective dosage schedules already exist. The exact physiological action of carbamazepine, however, as well as the pathophysiological basis of withdrawal itself have not been entirely discovered. Evidence exists that \"anti-kindling-effects\" are of particular importance. A number of controlled clinical studies were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of carbamazepine in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms and have also compared its properties to other substances such as clomethiazole and benzodiazepine. Due to its effectiveness and the lack of additive potential carbamazepine offers a useful alternative to conventional therapeutic approaches, especially in the treatment of mild and moderately severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms.", 
    "95": "Although panic disorder is generally believed to begin in young adulthood, 13 cases of panic disorder with an initial onset after age 60 years have recently been seen at our clinics. Other than the time of life in which the first panic attack occurred, clinical and demographic profiles of these 13 patients were similar to those that have been reported for panic disorder patients whose panic began earlier in life. These findings indicate that panic disorder can affect older adults with no previous history of panic attacks, but further research is needed to determine the clinical and theoretical significance of late-life-onset panic disorder.", 
    "96": "The RACGP guidelines on benzodiazepine use (Table 2) were endorsed in March 1993, and drew on the experience of hundreds of general practitioners. Following them should ensure that there is a rational response to the new listing.", 
    "97": "Thirty-two outpatients with a DSM-III diagnosis of panic disorder or agoraphobia with panic attacks were randomly assigned to 4 weeks of treatment with clonazepam or placebo, after a 1-week placebo washout period. Twenty-nine patients entered the double-blind phase of the study and were eligible for intent-to-treat analysis. Clonazepam-treated patients experienced significantly fewer panic attacks, and these were of lesser intensity and short duration than those in placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001). Clonazepam was also superior to placebo with respect to symptoms of anxiety and depression (p < 0.001). The mean dose of clonazepam at week 4 was 2.2 mg (standard deviation, 0.7 mg). There was significant (p < 0.05) correlation between drug concentration in plasma and decrease in the global measure of the severity of panic disorder (r = 0.68); similar trends were seen for the decreases in frequency (r = 0.60) and severity (r = 0.55) of panic attacks, but not between concentration in plasma and decline in generalized anxiety. The most common adverse event was drowsiness, which occurred in 9 of 13 clonazepam-treated patients.", 
    "98": "Flumazenil was studied on cocaine intoxicated rats for its preventive effect on seizure, death and loss of righting reflex. Two minutes after the intraperitoneal injection of cocaine (70 mg/kg) into a rat, flumazenil and diazepam were administered at the clinically corresponding dose intraperitoneally. Flumazenil at a dose 0.125 mg/kg extended the onset time of the cocaine induced seizure. Flumazenil at 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg with diazepam 2.0 mg/kg, prevented the seizure, and kept righting reflex. It was observed that use of flumazenil in combination with cocaine had the effect of the benzodiazepine receptor."
