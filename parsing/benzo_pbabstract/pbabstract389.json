    "0": "The direct effect of muscarine on neurons of the rat dorsolateral septal nucleus (DLSN) was examined by using conventional microelectrode and voltage-clamp techniques. Muscarine (1-50 microM) caused a hyperpolarization accompanied by an increase of a voltage-independent potassium conductance. Pirenzepine competitively antagonized the muscarine-induced hyperpolarization with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) value of 54 nM. Furthermore, intracellular loading with GTP gamma S, a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, blocked irreversibly the muscarine-induced hyperpolarization. In addition, pretreatment of neurons with pertussis toxin (PTX) prevented the hyperpolarization produced by muscarine. These results suggest that muscarine hyperpolarizes DLSN neurons via a voltage-independent potassium conductance by acting at M4 subtype receptors which are coupled to a PTX-sensitive G-protein in DLSN neurons.", 
    "1": "Tilivalline (TV) possesses a pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepine nucleus and is cytotoxic toward mammalian cells. The 11-beta-cyano TV analogue (1) is about one hundred times more cytotoxic to mouse leukemia L1210 cells than TV itself. In contrast, the 11-alpha-cyano TV analogue (2), an epimer of 1, has only about one-hundredth the cytotoxicity of 1. It was found that epimerization proceeded between 1 and 2 under physiological conditions, and the cytotoxicity of 2 is thought to be caused mainly by 1 that was formed from 2 during incubation in medium.", 
    "2": "Ras genes are frequently activated in human tumours. The role of their product, the P21 proteins, in the transduction of the mitogenic signal makes them attractive targets for an anti-neoplastic therapy. The p21 ras proteins are linked to the plasma membrane and transformed into an active form for signal transmission. Their effect is to mediate the effects of growth factors. Two drug families, the Benzodiazepine peptidomimetics and the CAAX tetrapeptides which inhibit the farnesylation of P21-Ras proteins abolish the transforming properties of mutated P21. These promising drugs could rapidly have clinical applications. They have been shown to be highly active at precise concentrations on ras-transformed cells but at the same concentrations are not toxic for untransformed cells. They do not effect other similar enzyme systems within the cell, underlining their selective capacity. Theoretically anti-ras therapy could only suspend cell transformation although it might be possible that if given long enough, a lethal threshold could be reached.", 
    "3": "The risk of brain neuron death supersedes that of physical harm due to muscle spasms. In fact, immediate induction of neuromuscular paralysis impedes monitoring of anticonvulsant therapy, which can be empiric but should follow a predetermined, sequential protocol so that seizures can be terminated quickly.", 
    "4": "One of the endogenous substances which modulate glutamate receptor binding was isolated and highly purified from porcine brain. The purification involved extraction of brain tissue with doubled distilled water, followed by gel filtration, anion exchange, cation exchange, and several steps of C18 reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A low molecular weight glutamate binding inhibitor (LGBI) was purified to apparent homogeneity as judged from the elution profile of an HPLC column, in which a symmetrical peak was obtained when the eluate was monitored at 220 nm. The LGBI appears to be a small molecule (< 2 kD) that is heat- and acid/base-stable. The highly purified LGBI has no effect on GABAA and benzodiazepine receptor binding. The LGBI is not L-glutamate, L-aspartate or other negatively charged endogenous substances, since they are clearly separated from the LGBI in anion exchange chromatography. The inhibitory effect of the LGBI on [3H]L-glutamate binding is reversible, and it only changes the Bmax while the Kd remains the same. Since the membrane preparations used for [3H]L-glutamate binding assays for the detection of LGBI activity were enriched with quisqualate (QA)-sensitive subtypes, it was suggested that the LGBI could be a modulator of the QA receptor. Some amino acids which produce significant inhibition of glutamate binding activity were also compared with the LGBI, and they all showed no resemblance to the LGBI. The chemical structure of the LGBI remains to be determined.", 
    "5": "The effects of graded stressful conditions on extracellular concentrations of dopamine (DA) in the medial prefrontal cortex of rats were measured in vivo using microdialysis. Picking up the rat twice with a 20-min interval increased extracellular DA to 120%, exposure to a novel environment by placement in a clean cage for 20 min to 150% and holding the rat in the hands for 20 min to over 200%. Diazepam (5 mg/kg) decreased DA to about 75% and attenuated the novelty- and handling-induced increases. Exposure to novelty or handling are easy and simple methods to obtain graded increases of in vivo cortical DA release.", 
    "6": "The non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic, panadiplon, was discontinued from clinical development due to evidence of hepatic toxicity in human volunteers that was not predicted by rat or monkey preclinical development studies. The present study was conducted to examine potential toxicity in the rabbit. Three groups of female rabbits were administered vehicle, 10 mg/kg per day or 20 mg/kg per day of panadiplon by oral gavage for 14 days. Animals in the 20 mg/kg group lost weight, and 6/10 developed a profound lethargy. Hepatic toxicity was observed in treated animals, evidenced by dose- and time-related increases in serum transaminase activities, gross hepatic lesions and multifocal centrilobular necrosis. Hepatic microvesicular steatosis was evident in treated animals; lipid analysis revealed a 123% increase in hepatic triglyceride. A time-dependent increase in serum triglyceride levels was observed in the high-dose group beginning on day 4. Hepatic glycogen was reduced, and histochemical examination revealed the reduction to be heterogeneous across the lobule with some areas showing a complete absence of glycogen. One rabbit in each drug-treated group showed mild hypoglycemia at day 12, and 4/10 rabbits in the high-dose group showed hyperglycemia at days 12-14. We conclude that panadiplon produced a microvesicular steatosis and hepatic toxicity in the rabbit. The observed toxicity resembled a Reye's syndrome-like toxicity produced by a variety of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation inhibitors.", 
    "7": "Following cholinergic denervation of the hippocampus by medial septal lesions, and unusual neuronal reorganization occurs, in which peripheral sympathetic fibers, originating from the superior cervical ganglia, grow into the hippocampus. Previously, we have found that both hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth (HSI) and cholinergic denervation (CD), alone, altered the total number and affinity of muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChR). In this study, we utilized the muscarinic antagonist [3H]Pirenzepine, in combination with membrane radioligand binding techniques, to determine the effects of HSI and CD on hippocampal M1 and M1 + M3 mAChR subtypes, 4 weeks after MS lesions. In both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, HSI was found to markedly diminish the number of M1 AChRs, while CD was found to increase the number of M1 AChRs. Neither treatment affected the affinity of the M1 AChR. However, when M1 + M3 binding was assessed, CD was found to decrease the affinity in both hippocampal regions, without altering the number of receptors. Neither affinity nor number of M1 + M3 receptors was altered by HSI. The results of this study suggest that both cholinergic denervation and hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth uniquely affect hippocampal muscarinic receptors.", 
    "8": "The effects of varied durations of cocaine (1, 3 or 5 days) on muscarinic (MSC) and benzodiazepine (BZD) binding sites in striatum and hippocampus were investigated using homogenate receptor binding. The progressive alterations in these receptor sites from a 5 day cocaine administration were also examined 12 h, 2 days or 21 days after drug exposure. Neither a one nor a three day exposure to cocaine produced any long-term alteration in BZD binding in either structure whereas a 5 day administration produced significant increases in binding. Decreases in MSC receptor binding were apparent in striatum from either a 3 or 5 day cocaine exposure and in hippocampus from a 5 day exposure. The 5 day cocaine exposure produced immediate increases in striatal and hippocampal BZD binding which persisted for 21 days. Conversely, 5 days of cocaine produced a short-term increase in MSC receptor binding in both structures which then became significantly decreased 21 days later. Based on the divergent pattern of changes in BZD and MSC receptor types over time in these structures, it appears that cocaine may induce such changes via separate mechanisms. In addition, it is apparent that changes in the numbers of these receptor sites after cocaine exposure can be quite dynamic, changing rapidly over time.", 
    "9": "Interaction between flumazenil, a substance regarded mainly as a benzodiazepine antagonist, and an intravenous anesthetic barbiturate, hexobarbital, was investigated by using an electroencephalography threshold test in male rats. Flumazenil 10 mg/kg given as pretreatment reduced the threshold dose of hexobarbital approximately 20% indicating a synergistic interaction. Similar effects were obtained with the agonists, diazepam 20 mg/kg and lorazepam 2 mg/kg. Dose-response curve for flumazenil (2.5-10 mg/kg) was determined with the same technique and hexobarbital concentrations were analysed in serum and several brain regions at the threshold by high pressure liquid chromatography. Flumazenil 10 mg/kg pretreated group showed a different pattern of distribution of hexobarbital into the tested brain regions indicating a pharmacokinetic interaction. Low concentrations of hexobarbital in the brainstem which were negatively correlated with the dose of flumazenil indicate a pharmacodynamic interaction which could be due to partial agonistic intrinsic activity of flumazenil, usually seen at much higher doses.", 
    "10": "Various exogenous and endogenous steroids have been demonstrated to have both enhancing and inhibiting effects on ligand binding to the gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptor (GABAA receptor) in previous studies. In the present study we have explored the possibility that an additional class of synthetic steroidal compounds, anabolic/androgenic steroids (AAS), mediate some of their CNS effects through direct interaction with the GABAa receptor. At micromolar concentrations, two AAS, stanozolol and 17 alpha-methyltestosterone (17 alpha-MT), significantly inhibited 1 nM [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]Fln) binding to rat brain cerebrocortical membranes. Inhibition of 1 nM [3H]Fln binding by stanozolol was similar for both males and females (approximately 50% inhibition at 50 microM stanozolol). 17 alpha-MT was much less efficacious, but did significantly inhibit 1 nM [3H]Fln binding at concentrations > 10 microM. In equilibrium binding assays, stanozolol (50 microM) raised the apparent KD for [3H]Fln binding. The observed changes in the [3H]Fln binding curve, when analyzed by Rosenthal analysis, reveal complex equilibrium binding behavior. In females, the Rosenthal plot was best fit by a two site binding model. Stanozolol (50 microM) inhibited binding to the higher affinity site in a manner consistent with competitive inhibition, increasing the KD without changing the BMAX. However, the effect of stanozolol on the binding to the low affinity site was more complex, with an increase in the the KD and the BMAX. In males the data were best fit by a single binding site model. This single site exhibited a slight increase in the KD and a decrease in the BMAX in the presence of 50 microM stanozolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "In a previous in vivo microdialysis study in rats, it was found that cortical acetylcholine (ACh) efflux was reliably increased by a multimodal appetitive stimulus (onset of darkness with presentation of palatable food). Furthermore, this stimulated ACh efflux was significantly enhanced by systemic administration of a benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) weak inverse agonist and significantly reduced by a BZR full agonist. These effects contrasted with the minimal effects of BZR ligands on basal cortical ACh efflux in resting animals. The aim of the present study was to determine whether this modulation of stimulated cortical ACh efflux by BZR ligands was mediated within the basal forebrain. ACh efflux, measured with in vivo microdialysis, was stimulated by onset of darkness, an event which predicted delivery of palatable food. The BZR full inverse agonist, beta -CCM (3.0 micrograms/hemisphere) or the full agonist chlordiazepoxide (40.0 micrograms/hemisphere) was infused into the basal forebrain just prior to the darkness/food stimulus. Similar to previous results with systemic administration, the BZR full inverse agonist enhanced, while the full agonist reduced, stimulated cortical ACh efflux. These results demonstrate that the action of BZR ligands in the basal forebrain is sufficient for their modulation of cortical ACh release.", 
    "12": "The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) plays a major role in steroidogenesis. This receptor is sensitive to endocrine changes and stress. Antidepressants have been demonstrated to modulate adrenal and hepatic PBR in rats. To evaluate the relationship between depression and PBR, we measured platelet PBR in untreated depressed patients (n = 14) in comparison to normal controls (n = 13). Platelet PBR density (Bmax) and the dissociation constant (kd) of the receptor did not differ in the patients when compared with normal controls. Furthermore, no correlation was found between Bmax values and the severity of the depression (as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Beck Depression Inventory) as well as with the severity of the anxiety (as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale). It seems that major depression, in contrast to stress and some anxiety disorders, is not associated with alteration of PBR.", 
    "13": "In urethane-chloralose anesthetised rats the muscle relaxant activity of flupirtine was investigated on the monosynaptic Hoffmann reflex recorded from plantar foot muscles and on the polysynaptic flexor reflex recorded from tibialis muscle. Intraperitoneal (i.p.; 2.5-25 mumol/kg) and intrathecal (i.t.; 33-330 nmol) administration of flupirtine depressed the polysynaptic flexor reflex in anesthetised rats in a dose-dependent manner without affecting the monosynaptic Hoffmann reflex. Flupirtine produced a similar pattern on spinal reflexes as NMDA receptor antagonists, such as (-)-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (500 nmol i.t.) and memantine (125 mumol/kg i.p.), the benzodiazepines diazepam (18 mumol/kg i.p.) and midazolam (80 nmol i.t.), and the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist tizanidine (2 mumol/kg). In contrast, the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (21 mumol/kg i.p.; 20 nmol i.t.) and the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (47 mumol/kg i.p.; 2 nmol i.t.) reduced the magnitude of both the flexor and the Hoffmann reflex, whereas the non-NMDA receptor antagonist 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX; 10 nmol i.t.) depressed the Hoffmann reflex without affecting the flexor reflex. The effect of i.t. injection of flupirtine was prevented by coadministration of the mixed alpha 1/alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (10 nmol) and the excitatory amino acid N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA; 0.1 nmol), but neither by coadministration of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosine (10 nmol), the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (1 nmol), the GABAB receptor antagonist phaclofen (100 nmol), the non-NMDA receptor agonist alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-tertbutyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (ATPA; 0.1 pmol) nor by pre-treatment with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (16 mumol/kg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "The effects of diazepam were studied in the isolated rat kidney under conditions of constant flow. Kidneys were perfused with modified Ringer-Krebs solution. Diazepam produced a raised fractional excretion of water and sodium without hemodynamic changes, suggesting a direct effect on tubular transport mechanisms. Diazepam decreased renal perfusion pressure in a concentration-dependent fashion when kidneys were pretreated with either noradrenaline or potassium chloride. Similar responses were observed when 7-chloro-5-[4-chloro-phenyl]-1, 3-dihydro-1-methyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (Ro 5-4864) or clonazepam was used. These data provide evidence for a relaxant effect of benzodiazepines on preconstricted renal vasculature.", 
    "15": "Researchers at the National Cancer Institute first recognized the anti-HIV potential of the carboxanilide compound oxathiin carboxanilide (UC84) [Bader, J. P., et al. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 6740-6744]. We have compared the inhibitory effect of UC84 and a second-generation thiocarboxanilide derivative, UC38, on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. UC38 was a much better inhibitor (IC50 = 0.8 microM) than UC84 (IC50 = 4.3 microM). Inhibition by UC84 was competitive with respect to primer/template (P/T), whereas that by UC38 was uncompetitive. Both compounds were mixed noncompetitive inhibitors with respect to deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP). Both compounds protected RT from irreversible photoinactivation by an azido derivative of nevirapine, implying that UC84 and UC38 bind to the same region of RT as nevirapine. UC84 photoprotected both free RT and the RT-P/T binary complex, but did not protect the RT-P/T-dNTP ternary complex. In contrast, UC38 completely photoprotected the RT-P/T-dNTP ternary complex, but not free RT or the RT-P/T binary complex. UC84 and UC38 thus appear to bind to different mechanistic forms of RT in the polymerase reaction sequence.", 
    "16": "The third intron of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (MBR)-encoding gene was sequenced from hamster, mouse and human. The rodent species were found to include an Alu-like sequence, as was first discovered in the rat gene. Differences with the rat intron were evident by an insertion of an additional B1 element in the hamster and the introduction of a complete and two partial B2 sequences in the mouse intron. The human intron contained a cluster of four Alu sequences; however, all of these repetitive elements were found to be in the opposite orientation relative to the Alu-like sequence present in the rodent genes. These findings support the possibility that the rodent Alu-like sequence is a remnant of a retropositional insertion in this gene prior to the divergence of rodent species. Because the human intron does not contain the same Alu remnant, it cannot be concluded that the rodent sequence represents an insertion of a primordial Alu element prior to the divergence of rodent and primate lineages.",

Pharmacol. 208 (1991) 307-312]. As the rate of production was low, we analysed the mRNA level, the effect of variation of the 5' sequence and the production in mitochondria. Translation rather than transcription or targeting was found to be the main limiting factor. We were able to produce a chimeric PBR, with an N-terminal extension, to a very high level in the yeast mitochondrial membrane.", 
    "18": "Astrocytes synthesize a series of peptides called endozepines which act as endogenous ligands of benzodiazepine receptors. The present study demonstrates that the endozepine ODN causes a dose-dependent increase in inositol trisphosphate and a parallel decrease in phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate in cultured rat astrocytes. Pre-incubation of astrocytes with the phospholipase C inhibitor U 73122 or with pertussis toxin totally blocked polyphosphoinositide metabolism. These data show that, in rat astrocytes, ODN stimulates a phospholipase C coupled to a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein.", 
    "19": "We investigated effects of benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor ligands on working memory in a delayed conditional discrimination (DCD) task. The BDZ receptor full agonist midazolam (0.1-1.0mg/kg) dose-dependently impaired performance independent of delay, indicating no specific effect on working memory. The non-sedative BDZ receptor partial agonist bretazenil (0.06-0.6mg/kg), the inverse agonist beta-CCM (0.05-0.45mg/kg), the partial inverse agonist FG 7142 (0.5-5.0mg/kg), the antagonist flumazenil (1-10mg/kg), and the antagonist ZK 93 426 (1-10mg/kg) did not significantly affect performance. It is concluded that BDZ ligands do not affect working memory in a positively-motivated DCD task. Midazolam also impaired performance in the no-delay condition, suggesting loss of stimulus control, possibly through an attentional impairment.", 
    "20": "The dissolution of reference and archival samples of flurazepam dihydrochloride (2) was studied in DMSO-d6 and in D2O by 1H-, 13C- and 19F-NMR spectroscopy to identify and distinguish solvated species of the parent drug (2), the \"benzophenone\" (4) and glycine (5) hydrochloride degradation products. In DMSO-d6, for most samples, only the ring intact form (2) could be detected by 13C-NMR whereas the inherently greater sensitivity of 19F-NMR allowed detection of initial trace amounts (< 1%) of the open-ring form (3). 19F-NMR spectroscopy also afforded the best means of quantifying the various entities in solution, including the increase towards equilibrium levels of the open-ring entity and detection/quantitation of a new equilibrium species, possibly the cis/trans rotamer of the open-chain entity (3). Various chemical shifts for flurazepam dihydrochloride and USP flurazepam related reference standards C and F are reported for DMSO-d6 solutions. The bases for 1H- and 19F-NMR assay of DMSO-d6 solutions of (2) for (4) are discussed with comparative data. The solvation characteristics of (2) in D2O at 0 and 27 degrees C were found to be too complex to follow by 13C-NMR; however, 19F-NMR studies at these temperatures permitted one to clearly discern that no additional formation of entity (4) occurred beyond whatever initial levels were present in degraded samples while the open-ring entity (3) was observed to increase to an equilibrium level of 56% over 24 h at 27 degrees C. Dissolution in D2O at either 0 or 27 degrees C does not contribute to solvolytic degradation of (2) to (4) over 24 h.", 
    "21": "To determine the role of M1 muscarinic receptors in the response of the pulmonary parenchyma to inhaled methacholine (MCh), 20 mongrel, out-bred puppies, 8-10 weeks of age were challenged following pretreatment with either saline (control), UH-AH37 (a combined M1 & M3 receptor blocker), or pirenzepine (a relatively selective M1 receptor blocker). In addition, eight fox hound-beagle puppies, born and raised in a clean animal house, were studied. Relatively selective doses of pirenzepine produced a dose-dependent shift to the right of the parenchymal dose-response curves (P = 0.031), with no effect on the airway dose-response curve (P = 0.102). The fox hound-beagle puppies showed less parenchymal response (P <0.0005), but equivalent airway response (P = 0.468), to MCh compared with the mongrel puppies. High doses of pirenzepine (10 000 mu g/kg) and UH-AH37 (3 mg/kg) markedly inhibited both the parenchymal and airway responses to MCh. Data from the present study demonstrate that: (1) while both the airway and pulmonary parenchyma respond to inhaled MCh, the mechanisms by which they respond differ; (2) stimulation of M1 subtype muscarinic receptors are responsible, at least partly, for the parenchymal response; and (3) experimental conditions, such as the breed and housing conditions of animals, may have major influences on the parenchymal response to inhalational challenge tests.", 
    "22": "An alternative synthesis of 7-chloro-N-methyl-5-(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-3H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-amine, the compound that inhibits gene expression by HIV-1 at the level of transcriptional transactivation by Tat, has been developed. The process is based on ring expansion of 6-chloro-2-chloromethyl-4-(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)quinazoline 3-oxide which leads to the corresponding benzodiazepine Ro24-7429. Quinazoline 3-oxide formation in the presence of boron trifluoride gives a tetracyclic system containing a 2,2-difluoro-1,3,6,2-oxadiazaborine ring that survives ring expansion to 13-chloro-5,5-difluoro-9-(methylamino)-5H-pyrrolo[1',2':3,4]- 1,3,6,2-oxadiazabora[6,5-d]-8H-1,4-benzodiazepin-7-ium hydroxide inner salt.

    "23": "The measurement of steady state level and accumulation rate of GABA and the activities of GAD and GABA-T in brain regions of adult male albino rats treated with diazepam (diazepam, 5 mg/kg/day, i.p.) and/or exposed (2 h/day) to higher environmental temperatures (higher environmental temperature, 40 degrees C) under long-term conditions (7-30 consecutive days) shows that long-term treatment with diazepam (5 mg/kg/day, i.p., for 15-30 consecutive days) reduced the GABAergic activity in the hypothalamus, corpus striatum (CS) and cerebellum (CM) without any alteration in the cerebrocortical region (CC). Multiple exposures to higher environmental temperatures for 7 consecutive days, on the other hand, enhanced GABAergic activity in hypothalamus, corpus striatum and cerebrocortical region of the rat. This higher environmental temperature-induced increase in GABAergic activity was further enhanced in the hypothalamus, but it was attenuated in the corpus striatum and became normalized in the cerebrocortical region upon the prolongation of exposure (15-30 consecutive days) to higher environmental temperature. The long-term diazepam-induced inhibition in GABAergic activity in hypothalamus and corpus striatum (but not in the cerebellum) disappeared and was finally activated following exposures (2 h/day) to higher environmental temperatures (40 degrees C) along with diazepam-treatment (5 mg/kg day, i.p.) for 7, 15 and 30 consecutive days. In the cerebellum, multiple exposures to higher environmental temperature did not significantly alter the long-term diazepam-induced inhibition of GABAergic activity or GABAergic activity in the normal rat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "The toxicity of hyperbaric oxygen in the central nervous system is expressed by generalized tonic-clonic seizures. In the search for drugs effective against these seizures, we tested flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist known to have antiepileptic properties. Forty rats with chronic cortical electrodes were injected i.p. with one of three doses of flumazenil (0.2, 2, and 20 mg/kg) or their vehicle, before exposure to 0.5 MPa oxygen. EEG and the spectral analysis of background EEG activity were monitored. The duration of the latent period until the appearance of electrical discharges in the EEG was used as an index of oxygen toxicity. Significant prolongation of the latent period preceding oxygen seizures was noted in the group of rats treated with 0.2 mg/kg flumazenil (p < 0.05 in Tukey test). However, when the dose of flumazenil was increased, the duration of the latent period returned to control values. These diverse effects of flumazenil on the benzodiazepine receptor may account for its complex effects on hyperoxic-induced seizures.", 
    "25": "Nausea and vomiting are extremely common and most distressing side effects of high-dose cisplatin therapy. Cisplatin induces anticipatory and acute, as well as, delayed emesis. High doses of metoclopramide can effectively decrease the intensity of these symptoms in up to 70% of cases. Several agents, including dexamethasone and antihistamines have been demonstrated to either increase the efficacy of metoclopramide or decrease the side effects. Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine, has both antiemetic and anxiolytic properties. It can be useful as an adjunct to metoclopramide-based therapy. We conducted a randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of lorazepam in managing anticipatory, acute, and delayed emesis induced by high doses of cisplatin. A total of 180 events involving cisplatin administration (100 mg/m2 as a 24-hour continuous infusion) were randomized to receive metoclopramide along with dexamethasone and clemastine with and without lorazepam. Categorical scales were utilized to document the incidence of nausea and vomiting and side effects related to antiemetic therapy. All episodes are evaluable. Lorazepam significantly reduced the incidence of anticipatory nausea and vomiting (P < .05) as well as acute emesis (P = .05) induced by cisplatin. Delayed emesis was also decreased; however, it was statistically significant on day 3 only (P < .05). Side effects were few except for mild sedation and amnesia, which were significantly more common in those receiving lorazepam (P < .001). We conclude that lorazepam increases the efficacy of metoclopramide against cisplatin-induced anticipatory, acute, and delayed nausea and vomiting. This four-drug regimen may offer one of the best combinations to be utilized in comparative trials against the newly introduced serotonin antagonists.", 
    "26": "Tat, the transcriptional transactivator protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), is required for viral replication in vitro. The Tat antagonist, Ro 5-3335, and its analog, Ro 24-7429, have been shown to inhibit replication of HIV-1 and to reduce steady-state viral RNA in infected cells (M.-C. Hsu et al., Science 254:1799-1802, 1991, and M.-C. Hsu et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6395-6399, 1993). Analysis of HIV-1 long terminal repeat-driven reporter gene transcription in a recombinant adenovirus by nuclear run-on assay indicated that the drug predominantly inhibits Tat-dependent initiation and also exerts a measurable effect on elongation. This result may imply a common mechanism for Tat-mediated transcription initiation and elongation.", 
    "27": "Anti-anxiety drugs are widely used for patients with neurosis or psychosomatic diseases due to the stress of contemporary society. The high efficacy of benzodiazepine (BZD) or its analog, which contains diazepam, is well-known. While these compounds have strong anti-anxiety effects, it has recently been pointed out that they have some side effects when used as daytime tranquilizers and induce drug dependence. The cause of these side effects is thought to be that typical BZD is a full agonist of BZD receptors. For this reason, partial agonists, inverse agonists and antagonists of BZD receptors are being developed. Furthermore, some non-BZD anti-anxiety drugs are also being developed to avoid the side effects of BZD. One of these is a 5-HT1A agonist, which has a high affinity for 5-HT receptors, because it is reported that 5-HT is related to anxiety in the septum-hippocampus system. In addition, the anti-anxiety effect of 5-HT3 agonist is being investigated, while the anti-anxiety effect of cholecystokinin agonists is also attracting attention. Because these new anti-anxiety drugs are more potent and have fewer side effects than BZD, they may achieve widespread clinical use.", 
    "28": "When rodents are placed on an elevated plus-maze which consisted of two enclosed arms and two open arms, they enter the enclosed arms more frequently and spend more time on the enclosed arms than on the open arms since they prefer the enclosed arms to the open arms. The elevated plus-maze test can measure effects of drugs based on this tendency of rodents. Anxiolytics increase the time spent on the open arms and number of entries into open arms, and anxiogenics decrease them. We investigated the basal behavior of mice and the effects of diazepam in the elevated plus-maze test using 4 mazes with different size. The basal behavior of mice were changed by the maze size, especially by the width of the open arms. Further, we suggested that the maze size might affect anxiolytic activity of drugs detected in this test. This test is very useful because it needs neither complicated training for rodents nor an expensive apparatus, and the anxiolytic effects of drugs can be easily measured. However, this test is difficult to detect putative anxiolytics acting on serotonin receptors. When this method is used for measuring the activity of drugs, the choice of experimental conditions and evaluation of the results should be carefully done.", 
    "29": "The Geller-type conflict test and its modified tests, which are based on operant conditioning, have been applied for preclinical evaluation of the anxiolytic effect of drugs in parallel with the clinical use of benzodiazepines. Here, the author describes the experimental procedures of the Geller-type conflict test, including its modified tests, using mice and rats in detail. The effects of drugs, particularly benzodiazepines and 5-HT1A receptor agonists, on the established conflict behaviors in rats and mice are also presented.", 
    "30": "The partition coefficients of several 1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones (BZDs) were determined in a synaptosomal membrane-buffer system (Pm/b) by a two-component model analysis of the experimental data and the following values were obtained: flunitrazepam (FNTZ) = 32.2 +/- 1.5; diazepam (DZ) = 79 +/- 9; clonazepam (CNZ) = 30 +/- 4; nitrazepam (NTZ) = 38 +/- 2 and chlorodiazepoxide (CDZX) = 15.7 +/- 0.6. Correlations between these Pm/b and other chemical properties were performed by a principal component analysis. Hydrophobicity of BZDs, measured as the partition coefficients in different solvent systems, could be correlated with the presence of a methyl group at position 1 of the seven-member ring of the BZD molecule. The values of the partition coefficients of benzodiazepine in the synaptosomal membrane-buffer system were one order of magnitude lower than those obtained in an octanol-water or in ethyl acetate-water systems. The complexity of the membrane, unlike the isotropy of a pure solvent phase, provides a wide spectrum of types of interactions which, in turn, can be modulated in a dynamic manner by local or generalized changes in the lipid phase state. In that sense, the present values of Pm/b should be interpreted as an average tendency of BZDs to establish non-specific interactions with the molecules present in the different phases within biological membranes. Conversely, these Pm/b values reflect a consequence of the difference in complexity between natural membranes and the systems currently used as membrane models for drug partitioning.", 
    "31": "This study compares the efficacy of \"3-in-1 block\" versus femoral nerve block for knee arthroscopy. One-hundred patients had a 3-in-1 block; 180 patients had a femoral nerve block. The 3-in-1 block provided anesthesia in 75 patients; 20 patients needed supplementary local anesthesia. Five patients required a general anesthesia to complete the operation. The femoral nerve block was effective in 88 patients; 90 patients needed intravenous flunitrazepam and/or fentanyl; 2 patients needed general anesthesia. The 3-in-1 block provided more satisfactory muscle relaxation and a longer postoperative analgesia than femoral nerve block. No side effects were recorded in either group. Our results suggest that the 3-in-1 block is the most effective technique of regional anesthesia for knee arthroscopy.", 
    "32": "A survey of the incidence of postoperative vomiting in 1476 children was conducted over a two-month period as part of our quality assurance programme. The incidence of vomiting was 24%, and was highest in children over three years of age and in those receiving opioids. The incidence is lower than that recorded in an earlier (1981) survey in our hospital. Changes in anaesthetic practices may have contributed to this decrease.", 
    "33": "Two hundred and seventy-eight patients scheduled for all types of surgery and premedicated with diazepam and metoclopramide were randomly allocated to one of four groups to compare the relative pain of an injection of 0.25 ml of lignocaine 1% via a 25 gauge needle with the pain of the siting of a 21 gauge Butterfly (Abbott), 23 gauge Butterfly or a 20 gauge Venflon (Vigo Spectramed). The injection of lignocaine and insertion of the 23 gauge Butterfly were associated with the least complaints of pain and least observed responses to pain. The 21 gauge Butterfly and 20 gauge Venflon were associated with complaints of greater pain and more pain responses. We conclude that a pre-cannulation injection of lignocaine causes minimal discomfort and is the most appropriate means of reducing the discomfort of venous cannulation when not using skin penetrating analgesic creams.", 
    "34": "The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of oral premedication with ketobemidone 5 mg, lorazepam 1 mg, propranolol 40 mg or placebo, given about an hour prior to anaesthesia, in a prospective randomized double-blind fashion. One hundred and twenty ASA I female patients scheduled for elective laparoscopy were randomly prescribed one of the study drugs. Patient evaluation of anxiety, nurse evaluation of premedication, induction and postoperative course were studied. Ninety-three of the 120 patients (78%) experienced no change or a decrease in anxiety, regardless of type of active drug or placebo administered. Eighty-eight of the patients (73%) were considered adequately premedicated by the nurse observer, with no differences between the groups. Pre induction pulse rate, blood pressure and amount of induction agent needed was also similar between the four groups of patients. No major differences could be seen during the postoperative course. We found no major effects of any of the active drugs studied compared to placebo. Routine use of small doses of oral premedication one hour before elective surgery among low anxiety patients could probably be omitted.", 
    "35": "Propofol, like the benzodiazepines, activates the GABAA receptor-chloride ionophore complex; they potentiate one another. Since neither pharmacodynamic nor pharmacokinetic data concerning drug interaction between flumazenil and propofol is available, and especially considering the relationship of binding sites, flumazenil, the antagonist of benzodiazepines, was investigated to determine its effect upon recovery from propofol anaesthesia. Forty women receiving dilatation and curettage procedures were included in this double-blind test. After 50 micrograms fentanyl, propofol 2 mg.kg-1 was injected for induction and followed by infusion at the rate of 15 mg.kg-1.hr-1. After the operation, patients were given normal saline (Group A) or flumazenil 10 micrograms.kg-1 (Group B) randomly. Recovery time in Group A was 15.2 +/- 5.1 min and Group B 15.8 +/- 4.8 min. Propofol concentrations at the end of infusion were 4.17 +/- 1.33 micrograms.ml-1 (Group A) and 4.03 +/- 1.45 micrograms.ml-1 (Group B); these then declined to 1.22 +/- 0.17 micrograms.ml-1 (Group A) and 1.18 +/- 0.15 micrograms.ml-1 (Group B) when patients were able to open their eyes on command. No significant differences were found between the groups based on propofol concentrations and recovery time, nor did haemodynamic changes differ between them after administration of reversal agents. It was concluded that flumazenil 10 micrograms.kg-1 does not influence recovery from propofol anaesthesia.", 
    "36": "The amygdala is a structure that is often implicated in the regulation of anxiety responses. Many studies have shown that injection of benzodiazepines into the amygdala produces an anxiolytic effect. The present study was undertaken to determine whether the anxiolytic effect of administration of systemic benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide) might be blocked by local injection of a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist (flumazenil) or GABAA receptor antagonist (bicuculline methiodide; BMI) into the region of the anterior basolateral amygdala (BLA) of rats using an ethologically based test of anxiety, the social interaction test. Injection of flumazenil or BMI into the BLA of rats was found to reverse the anxiolytic effects of peripherally administered chlordiazepoxide. These results suggest a major role for the BLA in mediating the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines.", 
    "37": "The functional role of cholecystokinin in the central nervous system is unknown. The tetra peptide CCK-4 was previously observed to induce panic attacks in a majority of normal volunteers and patients with panic disorder. Furthermore, it had been demonstrated that pretreatment with 10-50 mg of L-365,260, a selective CCKB antagonist, blocked CCK-4 induced panic in patients with panic disorder. Therefore, the present multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was designed to investigate the efficacy of L-365,260, a CCKB antagonist, in patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Following a 1-week, single-blind placebo period, 88 patients were randomized to double-blind treatment in which they received either L-365,260, 30 mg qid, or placebo for 6 weeks. At the dose tested, there were no clinically significant differences between L-365,260 and placebo in global improvement ratings, Hamilton anxiety rating scale scores, panic attack frequency, panic attack intensity, or disability measures. The possible reasons for lack of effect with L-365,260 are discussed.", 
    "38": "A randomised controlled trial studied the effect of an educational visit on benzodiazepine prescribing. An approximately representative sample of 286 general practitioners was allocated to an intervention or a control group. Rates of benzodiazepine prescriptions were derived from two comprehensive self-report surveys seven months apart. Two months after the first survey the intervention group received an educational visit and supporting material from a doctor or pharmacist, ostensibly unconnected with the surveys. The overall benzodiazepine prescribing rate fell by 23.7 per cent from the first to the second surveys, from 4.93 to 3.76 prescriptions per 100 encounters (P < 0.001). Anxiety and insomnia diagnosis rates also declined from 4.68 to 3.76 per 100 encounters (19.7 per cent). After adjusting for confounders, there was a differential downward trend in prescriptions per diagnosis of insomnia but not to a statistical level. The same was true of initial prescriptions per insomnia diagnosis. In a subsidiary analysis selecting only new insomnia diagnoses, the intervention had a strong effect in reducing initial prescriptions (odds ratio 0.18, 95 per cent confidence interval 0.04 to 0.73). No effect was seen on prescribing for anxiety diagnoses. Educational practice visiting for benzodiazepine prescribing in anxiety, as we conducted it, is not justified in an unselected population of general practitioners. Specific education on prescribing for insomnia is probably useful. Our interpretation of the reduction in benzodiazepine prescribing is that probably there was an effect from self-monitoring alone which overwhelmed a main-analysis intervention effect. Retrospective diagnosis may also have obscured a real intervention effect.", 
    "39": "Little information has been published on the knowledge and perceived competence of dentists in resuscitation or the occurrence of resuscitation emergencies in dental practice. Further, no such surveys have been done in Australia. A postal survey was therefore devised and the names of 350 dentists were randomly selected from the Australian Dental Association national membership registry. The response rate was approximately 45 per cent and the main results included: just under half of the respondents felt they were competent in basic resuscitation at the time of graduation, that is, in expired air resuscitation (EAR) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); just less than two-thirds had undertaken resuscitation training since graduation; about three-quarters felt they would be able to perform EAR and almost two-thirds felt they would be able to perform CPR; almost 90 per cent gained a satisfactory score in a Resuscitation Quiz included in the survey; and just over 5 per cent had had to resuscitate a patient.", 
    "40": "The effects on sleep of two well known hypnotics, lormetazepam and zolpidem, during experimentally induced environmental noise were compared with placebo. In a double-blind, crossover study, 12 normal volunteers were subjected to prerecorded traffic noise with a mean noise level of 52 dB(A) and peaks to 77 dB(A) continuously for 8 hours in bed. Both hypnotics increased total sleep time, predominantly stage 2 sleep. A significant decrease in the number of sleep stage transitions, arousals, and awakenings longer than 3 minutes was found only with lormetazepam. No significant effects on rapid eye movement (REM) and slow wave sleep were observed. Latencies to persistent sleep and REM sleep onset were not different for either active treatment compared with placebo. Only after lormetazepam was performance on the morning reaction time test significantly affected. However, no differences were found in the subjective sleep quality and alertness ratings. Changes in the distribution of sleep stages throughout the night were related to the elimination half-life characteristics of the hypnotics, but few trends were detected. Both the protective properties against environmental noise of the hypnotics studied and the validity of the model of induced sleep disturbance in evaluating hypnotic agents are discussed.", 
    "41": "In vitro preparations of human liver microsomes were used to study the inhibiting effects of two selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, paroxetine and fluvoxamine, on metabolism via hydroxylation of alprazolam and of desipramine. These reactions are mediated by Cytochromes P450-3A4 and P450-2D6, respectively. Paroxetine was a highly potent inhibitor of desipramine hydroxylation; the inhibition constant (Ki) value of 2.0 microM indicated greater inhibiting potency than fluoxetine or norfluoxetine. The in vitro data predicted in vivo impairment of desipramine clearance by coadministration of paroxetine which was in the same range as observed in a clinical study. Fluvoxamine, by contrast, was a much weaker inhibitor of desipramine hydroxylation, having a Ki value (16.6 microM) similar to those of sertraline and desmethylsertraline. For hydroxylation of alprazolam, paroxetine was a relatively weak inhibitor, approximately comparable to fluoxetine, whereas fluvoxamine showed inhibiting capacity similar to that of norfluoxetine. The in vitro data predicted the degree of impairment of alprazolam clearance observed in vitro model can therefore provide clinically relevant data on prediction of potential drug interactions with SSRIs.", 
    "42": "Sertraline is an effective antidepressant acting as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. The subjective and behavioral effects of sertraline were studied and compared with the effects of alprazolam and dextroamphetamine in a within-subject, randomized, double-blind study in 20 volunteers aged 18 to 46 years. These subjects were experienced but nondependent users of central nervous system depressants who had the ability to reliably distinguish secobarbital, 150 mg, from placebo and to report positive subjective effects of secobarbital in an experimental setting. The following drug conditions were tested: sertraline, 100 and 200 mg; alprazolam, 1 mg; dextroamphetamine, 10 mg; and placebo. Drug effects were assessed with an objective test of psychomotor performance, subject-rated questionnaires, and observer-rated scales. Both alprazolam and dextroamphetamine were distinguishable from placebo on most measures, but sertraline produced effects discernable from placebo on only a few measures. At 1 hour postdrug administration, dextroamphetamine and alprazolam produced positive effects on several measures of elation, euphoria, and drug liking greater than placebo and both doses of sertraline. In contrast, sertraline produced higher scores on measures of dysphoria and physical unpleasantness than did the other drug conditions. Observer ratings of satisfaction with the drug and other pharmacologic effects were consistent with these findings. Results from this study indicate that sertraline, at the doses tested, does not possess the behavioral effects profile considered to be indicative of abuse potential when compared with alprazolam and dextroamphetamine.", 
    "43": "The aim of the current study was to determine the degree to which patients with panic disorder develop tolerance to subjective and physiological effects of benzodiazepine after chronic treatment with alprazolam. Response to acute administration of diazepam was assessed in 19 panic disorder patients receiving chronic treatment with alprazolam and 23 untreated panic disorder patients. At baseline in the laboratory, the two groups did not differ in peak saccadic eye movement velocity, saccade latency, short-term memory, plasma cortisol and growth hormone concentrations, heart rate, and self-rated levels of sedation and anxiety. Compared with untreated patients, alprazolam-treated patients displayed significantly less diazepam-induced change in peak saccadic velocity, saccade latency, growth hormone secretion, memory, and self-rated levels of sedation. There was no difference between groups in diazepam effects on plasma cortisol concentrations or self-rated anxiety. Within alprazolam-treated patients, diazepam-induced slowing of peak saccade velocity was significantly inversely correlated with illness severity, as measured by reported panic attacks per week and severity of phobic avoidance, but not with alprazolam dose, blood level, or duration of treatment. Because the alprazolam-treated group reported more panic attacks per week than the untreated panic patients, treated patients were divided into those who were asymptomatic versus those with continuing panic attacks. The subgroup of nine alprazolam-treated subjects who were asymptomatic also showed significantly less diazepam effects than the group of untreated panic disorder patients, suggesting that overall group differences were at least partially attributable to the development of tolerance to selected benzodiazepine effects with chronic alprazolam treatment.", 
    "44": "Though it is well recognized that the pharmacological actions of benzodiazepines are mediated by facilitation of GABAergic neurotransmission, the consequences of these changes in regional brain function are not well understood. This study measured regional brain glucose metabolism using Positron Emission Tomography and 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose in normal controls (n = 21) investigated with and without lorazepam (30 micrograms/kg IV) and with flumazenil given after lorazepam (n = 9). Lorazepam markedly decreased metabolism in thalamus (23 +/- 8%) and occipital cortex (19 +/- 8%), and flumazenil partially reversed these changes. Changes in metabolic activity in thalamus were significantly correlated with lorazepam-induced sleepiness (r = .69, df 20, p < .0005) and there was a trend of an association between the reversal by flumazenil of lorazepam-induced change in thalamus and in sleepiness (r = .63, df 8, p = .07). Benzodiazepine-induced changes in thalamic activity may account for their sedative properties.", 
    "45": "The supernatant of polymorphonuclear neutrophils after their activation by opsonized zymosan induces the aggregation of washed platelets in human. It potentiates platelet aggregation induced by agonists in platelet rich plasma as well as in whole blood. This activation involves the phosphoinositide metabolism. Specific PAF receptor antagonists gingkolides (BN 50726, BN 52021, BN 54068, BN 54062, BN 50730, BN 50749, BN 50744) and benzodiazepine Web2086 antagonize this neutrophil-induced platelet aggregation. BN 50,730, BN 50,749 and Web 2086 can fully inhibit this aggregation at the final concentration of 10(-6) M. Preincubation of platelets with synthetic PAF also inhibits this activation through a desensitization of the receptor. These data suggest the major involvement in our model of PAF acether in the platelet-neutrophil interactions.", 
    "46": "Oxazepam has been determined to be a potent hepatocarcinogen in mice. Evidence in the literature indicates that oxazepam is capable of inducing drug metabolizing enzymes in rodents and an association between enzyme induction and carcinogenesis has been proposed for other compounds such as phenobarbital. We examined the pattern of enzyme induction that occurs under bioassay conditions in male B6C3F1 mice. The results indicate that oxazepam is capable of inducing multiple drug metabolizing enzymes under bioassay conditions. Closer examination of the most induced samples suggests that oxazepam is a phenobarbital-type enzyme inducer.", 
    "47": "We report a study performed to compare the time and plasma drug concentrations necessary to achieve a similar state of sedation after midazolam premedication given by various routes in children of 2-5 years old. Children were randomly allocated to one of three groups to receive midazolam 0.2 mg.kg-1 given intranasally, 0.5 mg.kg-1 given orally or 0.3 mg.kg-1 given rectally. Sedation was measured regularly until venepuncture was possible in a cooperative child. At this time, a first blood sample was taken to measure plasma concentration, followed by another 10 min later. Anaesthesia consisted of intravenous propofol supplemented with regional analgesia. At recovery from anaesthesia, a third blood sample was taken. Adequate sedation occurred sooner (7.7, SD 2.4 min) with intranasal than oral (12.5, SD 4.9 min) or rectal (16.3, SD 4.2 min) midazolam. The initial blood levels were lower when the drug was given by the alimentary routes despite higher doses (146, SD 51 ng.ml-1 in 11.5, SD 3.9 min; 104, SD 34 ng.ml-1 in 21 +/- 6 min; and 93, SD 63 ng.ml-1 in 23.1, SD 3.5 min for the intra nasal, rectal and oral routes respectively). Duration of surgical procedures, and of propofol infusion, and recovery from anaesthesia was similar for the three groups. The only problem arose in a 30-month-old boy in the intranasal group who developed respiratory depression with a plasma midazolam concentration of 169 ng.ml-1. Intranasal midazolam is an excellent alternative for rapid premedication provided that respiratory monitoring is used.", 
    "48": "An effective premedicant minimizes the emotional trauma children experience when facing surgery and may facilitate a smoother induction with fewer airway complications. In a randomized, double-blind study, the preoperative sedative effects and the postoperative recovery profiles of two oral pediatric premedicants were compared. Children (n = 102) were randomly assigned to receive 0.5 mg/kg midazolam or .2 mL/kg of a combination of meperidine 6.0 mg/mL, atropine 0.08 mg/mL, and diazepam 0.6 mg/mL 15-45 minutes before separation from parents. A five-point behavioral score was assigned at premedication, separation, and induction. Demographic data, preoperative preparation, analgesics, side effects, and recovery times were recorded. Scoring was continued at 15 and 30 minute intervals in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). A majority of children in both groups achieved acceptable separation and induction scores; however, the midazolam subjects showed significantly better improvement in scores at both separation and induction (P < .01). In midazolam subjects, the age of the child did not influence induction scores; but in the meperidine/atropine/diazepam group, unacceptable scores were strongly associated with younger subjects (P < .01). Attendance at a children's preoperative preparation program did not affect scores. Midazolam subjects initially arrived in the PACU sleepier than pediatric anesthesia medicine subjects, but all other recovery scores were similar. There were no differences in analgesic requirements, side effects, or time to discharge between groups. We conclude that both premedicants are effective in most children, but that midazolam may offer more effective sedation in younger, distressed children.", 
    "49": "The selective muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist, pirenzepine, considerably stimulates duodenal mucosal bicarbonate secretion in the rat and increases gastric luminal release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in humans. This study, therefore, looked at the effect of pirenzepine on bicarbonate secretion and luminal output of PGE2 into the stomach and the duodenum of nine healthy volunteers using a new technique permitting simultaneous measurements. In the stomach modified sham feeding increased bicarbonate secretion from 382 (62) mumol/h (mean (SEM)) to 959 (224) mumol/h (p < 0.02). In the duodenum modified sham feeding and acid exposure (HCl 0.1 M; 20 ml; 5 min) of the duodenal bulb increased mucosal bicarbonate secretion from 191 (14) mumol/cm x h to 266 (27) mumol/cm x h (p < 0.02) and 634 (157) mumol/cm x h (p < 0.01), respectively. Pirenzepine (10 mg/h intravenously) reduced basal and vagally stimulated gastric and basal duodenal bicarbonate secretion by about 50% (p < 0.03). In the stomach, but not the duodenum, basal and vagally stimulated PGE2 output increased significantly (p < 0.05) in response to pirenzepine. In conclusion, human gastroduodenal mucosal bicarbonate secretion is regulated by a pirenzepine sensitive mechanism, which is probably cholinergic. The rise in gastric PGE2 output seen in response to M1 receptor inhibition by pirenzepine suggests the existence of a feed back loop secondary to the decrease seen in bicarbonate secretion.", 
    "50": "Functional studies suggest that guinea pig chief cells have both cholecystokinin-A (CCK-A) and CCK-B receptors (CCK-A-R and CCK-B-R, respectively). However, all efforts to directly characterize the specific CCK-A-R using binding have been unsuccessful. Recent studies describe specific CCK-A-R agonists such as A-71378 ([desamino-Nle28,31-(N-methyl)Asp32]CCK heptapeptide]. In the present study, [D-Tyr-Gly]A-71378 was synthesized, which has > 300-fold selectivity for CCK-A-R and can be iodinated. [D-Tyr-Gly]A-71378 was equipotent to A-71378 in stimulating pepsinogen release from purified guinea pig chief cells. Binding of 125I-labeled [D-Tyr-Gly]A-71378 was saturable and specific. Potencies for inhibiting binding were as follows: [D-Tyr-Gly]A-71378 = A-71378 = 4x CCK octapeptide (CCK-8) > 1,000x des(SO4)-CCK-8, gastrin. In contrast, for 125I-gastrin binding they were CCK-8 > gastrin-17-I > des(SO4)-CCK-8 > A-71378 or [D-Tyr-Gly]A-71378. Binding of [D-Tyr-Gly]A-71378 was best fitted by a two-site model. In contrast, 125I-gastrin binding was fitted with a single-site model. For inhibiting binding of 125I-[D-Tyr-Gly]A-71378, the CCK antagonists had relative affinities of L-364,718 > L-365,260, and the reverse was true with 125I-gastrin. Correlation of binding with changes in biological activity suggested low-affinity CCK-A-R were mediating these changes. These results demonstrate directly for the first time that guinea pig chief cells possess CCK-A-R and CCK-B-R. The pharmacology of these CCK-A-R resembles those on other tissues. This novel, highly selective CCK-A ligand should be useful because it will identify CCK-A-R when they make up as little as 0.2% of the total CCK receptor number.", 
    "51": "Since the lifetime of synaptically released glutamate is thought to be very brief, reflecting diffusion and glutamate uptake, the decay of synaptic currents is thought to represent the average elementary lifetime of a receptor channel bound only once by transmitter molecules. We show here that the decay of evoked non-NMDA synaptic currents can reflect presynaptic factors, in particular, the prolonged action of transmitter at postsynaptic receptors under conditions of enhanced transmitter release. We show that diffusion, high-affinity glutamate uptake, and non-NMDA receptor desensitization are insufficiently rapid to limit the decays of evoked synaptic currents to those of miniature synaptic currents in microcultures of rat hippocampal cells. Our results are consistent with recent studies suggesting that during evoked release, multiple glutamate quanta can interact with overlapping postsynaptic receptor domains.", 
    "52": "The properties of GABA receptor-mediated responses were examined in noncultured astrocytes, acutely isolated from the mature rat hippocampus. Whole-cell patch clamping revealed a GABA-activated Cl- conductance that was mimicked by the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol and depressed by the GABAA antagonists bicuculline and picrotoxin. The GABAA-activated currents were potentiated by the barbiturate pentobarbital and the benzodiazepine diazepam. The benzodiazepine inverse agonist DMCM either enhanced or depressed the astrocytic GABAA-mediated responses, suggesting receptor heterogeneity with respect to pharmacologic profiles. In addition, GABA evoked an increase in [Ca2+]n measured by indo-1 fluorometry, which was depressed in the presence of verapamil or picrotoxin. A GABAA-induced depolarization, therefore, causes Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The expression and subcellular localization of GABAA receptors and its subunits were examined using immunohistochemical and fluorescent benzodiazepine binding techniques. Polyclonal antisera raised against the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor, which recognizes multiple subunit isoforms, labeled receptors on the astrocytic cell body and most large processes. In contrast, antisera generated against either alpha 1 or beta 1 subunit peptides revealed immunoreactivity predominantly on a subset of processes. To determine the subcellular distribution of membrane-bound receptors, a fluorescent benzodiazepine derivative was superfused over live astrocytes and visualized with laser-scanning confocal microscopy. Specific fluorescence was distributed in discrete clusters on the cell soma and a subset of distal processes. Collectively, these data support the view that astrocytes, like neurons, express GABAA receptors and target subunit isoforms to distinct cellular localizations. Astrocytic GABAA receptors may be involved in both [Cl-]o and [pH]o homeostasis, and a GABA-evoked increase in [Ca2+]i could serve as a signal between GABAergic neurons and astrocytes.", 
    "53": "Propofol has been implicated as causing intraoperative bradyarrhythmias. Furthermore, the effects of propofol on the electrophysiologic properties of the sinoatrial (SA) node and on normal atrioventricular (AV) and accessory pathways in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome are unknown. Therefore, this study examined the effects of propofol on the cardiac electrophysiologic properties in humans to determine whether propofol promotes bradyarrhythmias and its suitability as an anesthetic agent in patients undergoing ablative procedures.", 
    "54": "Twelve patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation were studied. Anesthesia was induced with alfentanil (50 micrograms/kg), midazolam (0.15 mg/kg), and vecuronium (20 mg) and maintained with alfentanil (2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) and midazolam (1-2 mg, every 15 min, as needed). A electrophysiologic study was performed consisting of measurement of the effective refractory period of the right atrium, AV node, and accessory pathway and the shortest cycle length of the AV node and accessory pathway during antegrade stimulation plus the effective refractory period of the right ventricle and accessory pathway and the shortest cycle length of the accessory pathway during retrograde stimulation. Determinants of SA node function including sinus node recovery time, corrected sinus node recovery time, and SA conduction time; intraatrial conduction time and atrial-His interval also were measured. Reciprocating tachycardia was induced by rapid right atrial or ventricular pacing, and the cycle length and atrial-His, His-ventricular, and ventriculoatrial intervals were measured. Alfentanil/midazolam was then discontinued. Propofol was administered (bolus 2 mg/kg + 120 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), and the electrophysiologic measurements were repeated.", 
    "55": "Propofol caused a statistically significant but clinically unimportant prolongation of the right atrial refractory period. The effective refractory periods of the AV node, right ventricle, and accessory pathway, as well as the shortest cycle length, were not affected. Parameters of SA node function and intraatrial conduction also were not affected. Sustained reciprocating tachycardia was inducible in 8 of 12 patients, and propofol had no effect on its electrophysiologic properties. All accessory pathways were successfully identified and ablated.", 
    "56": "Propofol has no clinically significant effect on the electrophysiologic expression of the accessory pathway and the refractoriness of the normal AV conduction system. In addition, propofol has no direct effect on SA node activity or intraatrial conduction; therefore, it does not directly induce bradyarrhythmias. It is thus a suitable agent for use in patients undergoing ablative procedures who require either a neuroleptic or general anesthetic.", 
    "57": "Previous investigations have suggested a relationship between zolpidem binding within specific brain regions and the ability of ethanol or zolpidem to enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced inhibition. The purpose of the present study was to extend our electrophysiological analysis to additional brain sites with high levels of zolpidem binding. In the brain regions chosen, red nucleus and globus pallidus, GABA-induced inhibition was shown to be enhanced by either ethanol or zolpidem on some, but not all, neurons. These findings led to the hypothesis that the effect of zolpidem on GABA-induced inhibition would predict the action of ethanol on responses to GABA for that neuron. When zolpidem and ethanol were applied individually to the same neurons in the red nucleus and globus pallidus, those neurons sensitive to zolpidem enhancement of GABA also were sensitive to ethanol. Conversely, if zolpidem did not enhance responses to GABA, ethanol did not enhance responses to GABA at these brain sites. A similar relationship between the abilities of zolpidem and ethanol to enhance GABA-induced inhibition was obtained in 90% of the neurons studied in the medial septum/diagonal band and ventral pallidum. These studies provide further support for the contention that the zolpidem-sensitive GABAA-benzodiazepine isoreceptor also responds to ethanol. Finally, the expression of GABAA subunit mRNAs was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction from micropunches of several brain regions that contain zolpidem binding sites and exhibit sensitivity to ethanol. Polymerase chain reaction analysis proved more sensitive than in situ hybridization in the detection of receptor subunit mRNAs. Several subunits (alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, beta 2, beta 3 and gamma 2) were common to all brain regions in which ethanol and zolpidem enhanced GABA responses. GABAA receptor alpha 4/5, alpha 6, beta 1, gamma 1, gamma 3 and delta subunits were not consistently expressed in association with the presence of zolpidem binding. These data are consistent with the view that one native GABAA receptor to which zolpidem binds, and on which ethanol acts, contains the GABAA receptor subunits alpha 1, beta 2 and gamma 2; however, the present investigation did not preclude the possibility that other subunit combinations can contribute to ethanol and zolpidem enhancement of responses to GABA.", 
    "58": "The effects of imidazenil (6-(2-bromophenyl)-8-fluoro-4-H-imidazo[1-5-a][1-4]benzodiazepine-3- carboxamide) and abecarnil (isopropyl-6-benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate), new partial and selective benzodiazepine recognition site agonists, respectively, on basal and stress-induced hippocampal acetylcholine and cortical dopamine release were determined with the microdialysis technique in freely moving rats. The actions of these new anxioselective and anticonvulsant drugs were compared with those of diazepam and midazolam, two classical benzodiazepine full agonists. Abecarnil (0.05-1 mg/kg i.p.), imidazenil (0.05-1 mg/kg i.p.), diazepam (2.5-10 mg/kg i.p.) and midazolam (2.5-10 mg/kg i.p.) inhibited basal hippocampal acetylcholine release in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, whereas diazepam and midazolam significantly decreased dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex, abecarnil and imidazenil had no effect on basal dopamine output. The effects of these drugs on both acetylcholine and dopamine release were antagonized by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (1 mg/kg i.p.). Foot-shock stress (0.2 mA for 500 msec/sec) delivered for 8 min induced a rapid and marked (+75%) increase in hippocampal acetylcholine output that persisted for approximately 40 min. Foot-shock stress also increased dopamine release in the cerebral cortex; the effect was maximal (+90%) after 20 min and persisted for approximately 30 min. Prior administration of abecarnil or imidazenil at a dose (0.05 mg/kg) that did not significantly affect the basal release of either acetylcholine or dopamine completely prevented the effect of stress on the output of these neurotransmitters, an effect mimicked by higher doses of diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) and midazolam (2.5 mg/kg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "65": "1. The effects of orally administered aqueous lyophilized extract of the leaves of Rhazya stricta (2, 4 & 8 g/kg) on aspects of nervous system function were investigated in mice. 2. In three antinociceptive tests (hot plate, abdominal constriction, and warm water tail flick tests), the extract exhibited dose-dependent and significant antinociceptive activity. Naloxone was ineffective in antagonizing the analgesic effect of Rhazya stricta on tail-flick and abdominal constriction tests, possibly indicating that this effect occurs via non-opiate pathways. 3.Pretreatment of mice with the xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes inhibitor cimetidine (50 mg/kg) did not significantly alter the antinociceptive action of the extract, indicating that the effect is probably due to the parent compound(s) present in the extract and not to metabolites thereof. 4. Rhazya stricta produce dose-dependent sedation, decreased motor activity, and impaired motor control. Time spent on a rotarod treadmill was significantly decreased after treatment with the extract. 5. Rhazya stricta extract (8 g/kg) produced a degree of sedation comparable to that produced by diazepam (5-10 mg/kg), and also significantly increased the reaction time of the tail-flick test, an action which was not produced by diazepam. 6. Administration of R. stricta extract potentiated pentobarbitone sleeping time in a dose dependent manner. The extract did not significantly antagonize picrotoxin induced convulsions. The extract (4 and 8 g/kg) significantly decreased the rectal temperature of normothermic and hyperthermic mice. 7. Pretreatment with R. stricta extract (8 g/kg) completely prevented the occurrence of aggressive behaviour in male mice. 8. It is concluded that the crude extract of R. stricta has central nervous system depressant properties.", 
    "66": "Transcendental mediation (TM) is a stylized form of physical and mental relaxation which is associated with changes in the secretion and release of several pituitary hormones. The hormonal changes induced by TM mimic the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). It is hypothesized that TM produces changes in pituitary hormone secretion by enhancing hypothalamic GABAergic tone, and its anxiolytic effects by promoting GABAergic tone in specific areas of the brain. This mechanism is similar to the effects of synthetic anxiolytic and tranquilizing agents such as benzodiazepines that bind to components of the GABA-A (GABAA) receptor. TM, therefore, may produce relaxation by enhancing the effects of an endogenous neurotransmitter analogous to the effects of endorphins in runners who reportedly experience a 'runner's high'.", 
    "67": "To assess possible pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between the antidepressant venlafaxine and diazepam, a randomized, two-period, crossover study was conducted in 18 men. Multiple-dose venlafaxine (50 mg every 8 hours) or placebo (double-blind) was given for 10 days; on day 4 a single placebo dose (same appearance as diazepam capsule, single-blind) was given; and on day 5 a single dose of diazepam (10 mg) was given. Pharmacokinetic data indicated that diazepam had no significant effect on venlafaxine or O-desmethylvenlafaxine disposition. Diazepam pharmacokinetics were minimally changed in the presence of venlafaxine. Diazepam oral clearance (CL/f) increased slightly (24 +/- 8 versus 26 +/- 6 mL/h/kg; P = .007), volume of distribution (Vz/f) increased (0.85 +/- 0.28 versus 0.99 +/- 0.34 L/kg; P = .02), and AUC decreased (5973 +/- 2304 versus 5008 +/- 1354 ng.h/mL; P = .02). Venlafaxine did not alter desmethyldiazepam pharmacokinetics. Pharmacodynamic data showed a statistically significant diazepam-venlafaxine interaction for only one of the eight psychometric tests given. Critical flicker fusion slightly decreased (P = .01) between placebo-diazepam (37.85 +/- 3.28 Hz) and venlafaxine-diazepam (37.09 +/- 4.13 Hz) treatments. The observed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between diazepam and venlafaxine were small and probably clinically insignificant.", 
    "68": "The aim of the study was to determine the usage patterns of benzodiazepine hypnotics, the use of other ways of improving sleep and general sleep characteristics in patients prescribed these drugs on a regular basis and in a control group of age- and sex-matched patients not receiving hypnotics. Patients receiving regular benzodiazepine hypnotic prescriptions and a control group matched for age and sex were identified from a general practice computer. They were interviewed in their own homes about their habits relating to sleep, hypnotic use and attitudes to sleep and hypnotics. None of the recommended methods of improving sleep differed significantly in frequency between the two groups or had an effect on sleep parameters. Only daytime napping was found to be slightly more frequent in hypnotic users, but had no apparent effect on self-estimates of sleep duration or latency. The hypnotic users claimed a longer sleep latency and a shorter sleep duration than non-users. More patients who took hypnotics also perceived them to be beneficial and more convenient than other ways of promoting sleep. The recommendation of sleep-promoting methods such as caffeine and alcohol avoidance and regular exercise may not be helpful in patients attempting to avoid hypnotics, as many patients already claim to use such methods.",

Such hyperphagia was abolished by pretreatment with naloxone 0.1 mg/kg sc. Naloxone per se at this dose produced no significant effect on the food intake.

Each subject received a 1.0 mg dose of clonazepam intranasally and buccally and 0.5 mg intravenously. A Cmax of 6.3 +/- 1.0 ng ml-1 (mean; +/- s.d.) was measured 17.5 min (median) (range 15-20 min) after intranasal administration. A second peak (4.6 +/- 1.3 ng ml-1) caused by oral absorption was seen after 1.7 h (range 0.7-3.0 h). After buccal administration a Cmax of 6.0 +/- 3.0 ng ml-1 was measured after 50 min (range 30-90 min) with a second peak of 6.5 +/- 2.5 ng ml-1 after 3.0 h (range 2.0-4.0 h). Two minutes after i.v. injection of 0.5 mg clonazepam the serum concentration was 27 +/- 18 ng ml-1. It is concluded that intranasal clonazepam is an alternative to buccal administration. However, the Cmax of clonazepam after intranasal administration is not high enough to recommend the intranasal route as an alternative to intravenous injection.",

    "78": "We studied the aggressive behaviour induced by repeated treatment with apomorphine, a dopamine agonist (0.5 mg/kg s.c. twice daily, 10 days), in rats. The first signs of defensive aggressiveness appeared on the third day of apomorphine treatment and were generally seen on the 7th day. Aggressiveness induced by a challenge dose of apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) on the 11th day was antagonized by haloperidol (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg i.p.) and clozapine (10 mg/kg i.p.). An antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-gated channels, dizocilpine (MK-801), also blocked the aggressive behaviour at 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg i.p. but caused ataxia. When dizocilpine (0.25 mg/kg i.p.) and apomorphine were coadministered for 10 days, aggressive behaviour did not develop. At 0.025 mg/kg i.p., dizocilpine even accelerated the appearance of apomorphine-induced aggressive behaviour, which manifested on the 3rd day in all rats. In a separate study, a 7-day treatment with dizocilpine (0.25-1 mg/kg i.p.) of rats, sensitized by a prior 10-day apomorphine treatment, did not reverse the established aggressive behaviour. The coadministration of apomorphine and cholecystokinin (CCK) -A or -B antagonists, devazepide or L-365,260 (0.01-2.5 mg/kg i.p.) respectively, neither affected development of apomorphine-induced aggressive behaviour nor intensity of aggressiveness in the sensitized rats. In binding studies neither density nor affinity of striatal dopamine D2 receptors was changed by acute or chronic apomorphine treatment. The number of [3H]pCCK-8 binding sites in the frontal cortex increased already after a single injection of apomorphine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "79": "The diagnosis, evaluation and assessment, supportive care, and pharmacologic treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal are reviewed. Patients in alcohol withdrawal have decreased or stopped their heavy, prolonged ingestion of alcohol and have subsequently begun to have at least two of the following symptoms: autonomic hyperactivity, tremor, nausea or vomiting, hallucinations, psychomotor agitation, anxiety, and grand mal seizures. Evaluation of the patient at risk for alcohol withdrawal should include a complete history and physical examination; laboratory tests are often indicated. The patient's progress should be assessed before, during, and after therapy, preferably with a validated instrument. After the initial evaluation and assessment but before the administration of dextrose-containing solutions, a 100-mg dose of thiamine hydrochloride should be given by i.m. or i.v. injection. Routine supplementation with calcium, magnesium, and phosphate is questionable. The need for fluid and electrolyte administration varies depending on losses. Most patients in alcohol withdrawal can be managed with supportive care alone, but for more severe or complicated withdrawal, pharmacologic therapy may be necessary. Benzodiazepines, especially diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, are the drugs of choice. Barbiturates, beta-blockers, and antipsychotics are generally not recommended as first-line therapy. Several drugs in other classes, including carbamazepine and clonidine, have been shown to be about as effective as benzodiazepines in a few studies, but the studies were small, the patients were usually in mild withdrawal, and validated instruments for assessing withdrawal were often not used. Some agents, such as beta-blockers, may play a role as adjuncts to, not replacements for, benzodiazepine therapy. For patients in alcohol withdrawal who do not respond to supportive care, benzodiazepines are the treatment of choice.", 
    "80": "The mechanisms underlying the blunted response to alcohol administration observed in subjects at risk for alcoholism are poorly understood and may involve GABA-benzodiazepine receptors. The purpose of this study was to investigate if subjects at risk for alcoholism had abnormalities in brain GABA-benzodiazepine receptor function. This study measured the effects of 30 micrograms/kg (i.v.) of lorazepam, on regional brain glucose metabolism using positron emission tomography and 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose in subjects with a positive family history for alcoholism (FP) (n = 12) and compared their response with that of subjects with a negative family history for alcoholism (FN) (n = 21). At baseline, FP subjects showed lower cerebellar metabolism than FN. Lorazepam decreased whole-brain glucose metabolism, and FP subjects showed a similar response to FN in cortical and subcortical regions, but FP showed a blunted response in cerebellum. Lorazepam-induced changes in cerebellar metabolism correlated with its motor effects. The decreased cerebellar baseline metabolism in FP as well as the blunted cerebellar response to lorazepam challenge may reflect disrupted activity of benzodiazepine-GABA receptors in cerebellum. These changes could account for the decreased sensitivity to the motor effects of alcohol and benzodiazepines in FP subjects.", 
    "81": "RO 15-4513, an inverse agonist at the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor Cl- channel complex, antagonizes multiple effects of ethanol. Prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, such as indomethacin, also antagonize several effects of alcohols. However, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors and RO 15-4513 each provide only partial antagonism of ethanol, typically seen as a dose-related effect with a maximum efficacy of approximately 50%. The purpose of this study was to: (1) compare the relative efficacy of these compounds for antagonizing ethanol; (2) compare the effectiveness of preethanol treatment versus postethanol treatment with each drug; and (3) compare the effect of RO 15-4513 and indomethacin in combination with the effects of each drug alone. The results show that indomethacin significantly decreased duration of loss of the righting reflex when administered either pre- or postethanol. Conversely, RO 15-4513 decreased duration of loss of the righting reflex only when given preethanol. When coadministered, RO 15-4513 and indomethacin did not show additive or synergistic effects. Compounds from these two drugs classes should continue to prove useful in elucidating ethanol's mechanisms of action.", 
    "82": "The gastrointestinal peptide cholecystokinin (CCK) has been shown to stimulate pancreatic growth in the adolescent and adult rat. However, little is known about the role of gastrointestinal hormones in the regulation of organ formation during fetal development. We therefore examined the effects of the CCK receptor antagonist devazepide (25 micrograms/h) and an antigastrin/CCK monoclonal immunoglobulin G on the maternal and fetal rat pancreas. These substances were infused subcutaneously with minipumps in female rats during the entire period of gestation. At the end of gestation, the rats were killed and the pancreata of the dams and their litter were examined for DNA and protein. In the dams, the receptor antagonist and the antibody against CCK/gastrin had no effect. In the newborns, the CCK receptor antagonist led to a significant reduction of the protein and DNA concentration [protein in controls, 105.0 +/- 3.75 micrograms/mg pancreatic tissue; in the antagonist group, 91.9 +/- 4.2 micrograms/mg pancreatic tissue (p < 0.05); DNA in controls, 1.28 +/- 0.19 micrograms/mg pancreatic tissue; in the antagonist group, 0.48 +/- 0.06 micrograms/mg pancreatic tissue (p < 0.05) (mean +/- SEM)]. Immune neutralization of CCK/gastrin in the maternal-fetal circulation induced a reduction of the protein concentration in the fetal pancreas (85.3 +/- 3.06 micrograms/mg pancreatic tissue; p < 0.01) but had no effect on fetal pancreatic DNA. Additional experiments indicated effective concentrations of the CCK receptor antagonist in fetal pancreatic tissue and free binding sites of the circulating antibody. In conclusion, the study provides evidence that CCK and its analogues are involved in fetal pancreatic organogenesis.", 
    "83": "The neuroanatomical networks involved in the initiation of panic attack and the maintenance of panic disorder are poorly understood. This study aimed to elucidate the possible abnormalities in benzodiazepine receptor uptake in the brain of patients with panic disorder. Seventeen unmedicated patients with panic disorder were investigated using 123I-iomazenil single photon emission tomography (SPET). Seventeen healthy age- and sex-matched volunteers served as controls. The SPET scan was taken 90 min after injection of tracer. Eleven of 17 patients (65%) showed an increased (> 2 S.D. higher than the mean of the controls) right-to-left ratio of benzodiazepine receptor uptake in the prefrontal cortex. Also, the mean right-to-left ratio of benzodiazepine receptor uptake in all 17 patients with panic disorder was higher than in the controls (P < 0.001). Our SPET study demonstrated focally altered benzodiazepine receptor uptake in the prefrontal cortices in patients with panic disorder. Magnetic resonance imaging indicated that the affected region was located in the right middle and inferior frontal gyri. The deterioration in information processing in the right prefrontal cortex may be implicated in the generation of panic disorder.",

Unilateral microinjection of midazolam into the basolateral amygdala reduced both hypoalgesic and avoidance responses, whereas unilateral microinjection of midazolam into the ventrolateral region of the periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) reduced the hypoalgesic response but not the avoidance response. The results are discussed in terms of gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic inhibition of antinociceptive mechanisms in the vlPAG and of the activation of these mechanisms by amygdala-based fear processes.", 
    "87": "Diazepam is administered to children in status epilepticus by paramedics in many Emergency Medical Services systems throughout the United States despite the lack of clear evidence that this therapy is safe and effective when employed in the prehospital environment. We reviewed the clinical course of 45 episodes of generalized convulsive status epilepticus (SE) in 38 children to determine the effect of prehospital diazepam therapy (given rectally or intravenously) on the clinical course of SE and subsequent patient management. Nineteen SE episodes were treated with prehospital diazepam therapy--9 episodes with rectal diazepam (mean dose: 0.6 mg/kg) and 10 episodes with intravenous diazepam (mean dose: 0.2 mg/kg). Prehospital diazepam therapy was associated with SE of shorter duration (32 min vs 60 min; P = .007) and a reduced likelihood of recurrent seizures in the emergency department (58% vs 85%; P = .045). There were no significant differences between rectal and intravenous diazepam therapy with regard to SE duration, intubation, or recurrent seizures in the emergency department. These data suggest that prehospital administration of diazepam may shorten the duration of SE in children and simplify the subsequent management of these patients in the emergency department.",

The criteria to input an aggressive reaction to benzodiazepine dose must be strictly estimated. Two clinical examples illustrate this problem. The authors advance that the hypothesis of paradoxical rage reactions due to benzodiazepine dose, would result from a desinhibition phenomenon with serotoninergic mechanism.", 
    "89": "In exploratory animal models of anxiety, such as the elevated plus maze, the anxiogenic- and anxiolytic-like effects of drugs may be confounded by changes in locomotor activity. In the present experiments, the sensitivity of several measures of anxiety and locomotor activity in the elevated plus maze were assessed. Both chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride (CDP, 7.5 mg/kg) and d-amphetamine sulphate (AMP, 0.75, 1.5 mg/kg) increased the percent time on the open arms and doses of 7.5 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg CDP and AMP, respectively, increased the number of entries into the open arms. The increase in these measures might suggest that both compounds induced an anxiolytic-like effect. Although FG 7142 (30.0 mg/kg) did not decrease the number of entries to the open arms, it did decrease the time on the open arms, which might suggest that it had anxiogenic-like effects. Similarly, buspirone reduced both the number of entries into the open arms and the time spent on the open arms. However, all the compounds significantly affected locomotor activity. CDP (3.0 and 7.5 mg/kg) increased the total number of arm entries, the distance travelled on the open arms and the mean speed of the animals on the open, and in the closed arms. Moreover, the distance travelled by the animals in the closed arms was increased by 1.0 mg/kg CDP, a dose that had no measurable effects on the indices of anxiety.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "90": "Peak saccadic eye movement velocity (SEV) and average smooth pursuit gain (SP) are reduced in a dose-dependent manner by diazepam and provide reliable, quantitative measures of benzodiazepine agonist effects. To evaluate the specificity of these eye movement effects for agents acting at the central GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex and the role of sedation in benzodiazepine effects, we studied eye movement effects of diphenhydramine, a sedating drug which does not act at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. Ten healthy males, aged 19-28 years, with no history of axis I psychiatric disorders or substance abuse, received 50 mg/70 kg intravenous diphenhydramine or a similar volume of saline on separate days 1 week apart. SEV, saccade latency and accuracy, SP, self-rated sedation, and short-term memory were assessed at baseline and at 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after drug administration. Compared with placebo, diphenhydramine produced significant SEV slowing, and increases in saccade latency and self-rated sedation. There was no significant effect of diphenhydramine on smooth pursuit gain, saccade accuracy, or short-term memory. These results suggest that, like diazepam, diphenhydramine causes sedation, SEV slowing, and an increase in saccade latency. Since the degree of diphenhydramine-induced sedation was not correlated with changes in SEV or saccade latency, slowing of saccadic eye movements is unlikely to be attributable to sedation alone. Unlike diazepam, diphenhydramine does not impair smooth pursuit gain, saccadic accuracy, or memory. Different neurotransmitter systems may influence the neural pathways involved in SEV and smooth pursuit again.", 
    "91": "The lowest dose of alprazolam, diazepam, flunitrazepam and oxazepam consistently to induce loss of righting reflex in squirrel monkeys or vehicle was orally administered to monkeys on 18 consecutive days: 2 mg/kg alprazolam (n = 4), 30 mg/kg diazepam (n = 4), 1 mg/kg flunitrazepam (n = 4), 280 mg/kg oxazepam (n = 5), or vehicle (n = 4). Tolerance developed rapidly for loss of righting reflex, more slowly for sleep and only minimally for muscle relaxation observed during the period immediately following daily oral administration. Injection of the specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (10 mg/kg i.v.) 5 h after the ninth daily oral treatment produced signs of precipitated withdrawal (tremor, vomiting and/or convulsions) in one alprazolam-, four diazepam-, one flunitrazepam- and four oxazepam-treated monkeys, but not in the vehicle-treated monkeys. Physiological saline injected intravenously several days later under these same experimental conditions failed to provoke a precipitated withdrawal reaction. When flumazenil-induced precipitated withdrawal was again evaluated after the 18th daily oral treatment, withdrawal signs were observed in all alprazolam- and all diazepam-treated monkeys, as well as in three flunitrazepam- and three oxazepam-treated monkeys, but not in the vehicle-treated monkeys (convulsions were observed in one alprazolam-, two diazepam-, one flunitrazepam- and two oxazepam-treated monkeys). No signs of spontaneous withdrawal were observed in any of the monkeys during a subsequent 3-week drug-free period. Thus, repeated administration of approximately equieffective doses of these four benzodiazepines resulted in a similar development of tolerance and physical dependence (indicated by the occurrence of a precipitated withdrawal reaction).", 
    "92": "Guinea pigs received a 2 mg/kg IP injection of diazepam, or an equivalent volume of vehicle, daily for 28-60 days. To determine whether tolerance developed to the ataxic effects of diazepam on the righting reflex, daily righting reflex latency (RRL) measurements were made before and 20, 30, and 40 min following the diazepam or vehicle injection for 28 days. Analyses of the RRLs for individual animals indicated that a significant decrease in RRL over time (indicating tolerance) occurred in only one out of nine animals receiving diazepam and in none of the vehicle animals. Medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons in brain stem slices from animals receiving chronic diazepam treatment had a significantly higher average firing rate than those from vehicle controls. These results suggest that: a) long-term treatment with single 2 mg/kg daily IP injections of diazepam does not result in tolerance to diazepam's ataxic effects on the righting reflex in the majority of animals; b) this form of diazepam treatment may, nonetheless, induce a hyperactivity of brain stem MVN neurons that may be consistent with the occurrence of a withdrawal syndrome.",

In addition, virtually all stress procedures that cause rapid changes in PBR simultaneously increase the physical activity or metabolic rate of the subjects. The present study analyzed the contributions of rapid alterations in activity or metabolic rate with and without aversive stimulation and their subsequent impact on PBR. Mechanically induced increases in activity by forced running stress results in a significant reduction in [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to PBR in olfactory bulb, opposite to the PBR changes in this tissue following forced cold-water swim stress. Pharmacological induction of increased locomotor activity as well as metabolic rate by d-amphetamine causes a significant increase in cardiac PBR binding, again, opposite to the response typically observed following inescapable shock stress. Finally, administration of the anxiogenic beta-carboline, FG-7142, causes increases in both hippocampus and adrenal gland PBR binding reminiscent of acute noise stress exposure. These experiments demonstrate that increased locomotor activity or metabolic rate alone is not a necessary and sufficient condition for previous stress-induced changes in PBR. Conversely, increased metabolic rate coupled with an aversive stimulus appears to be an important factor for inducing stress-like changes in PBR. This data, coupled with previous reports, suggests that rapid alterations in these sites are stressor and tissue dependent. Finally, we propose that the PBR may be involved in many aspects of the stress response including: a) a blowarning system in adrenal gland, b) participation in stress-induced hypertension via renal PBR, and c) a modulator of stress-induced immunosuppression and subsequent recovery of function or recuperation by actions on immune cells.", 
    "94": "A novel method for the measurement of rat strength is described. The method makes use of a rat's natural inclination to move forcibly and rapidly toward an enclosed, darkened compartment. Acrylamide (200.0 mg/kg, IP), gentamicin (30.0 mg/kg, IP), d-tubocurarine (0.1 mg/kg, IP), and diazepam (3.0, 10.0, and 30.0 mg/kg, PO) significantly decreased strength. The rat-pull test procedure provides a sensitive, reliable, and valid method for the measurement of strength in rats.", 
    "95": "Interaction between erythromycin, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, and nitrazepam, a long-acting benzodiazepine, was investigated in a double-blind and randomized cross-over study of two phases. Ten healthy volunteers received erythromycin (500 mg x 3) orally or placebo for 6 days. On the fourth day they were given a challenge dose of 5 mg nitrazepam. Plasma samples were collected and psychomotor effects were measured during 42 hr after intake of nitrazepam. There was a statistically significant pharmacokinetic interaction between erythromycin and nitrazepam. Erythromycin increased the area under the nitrazepam concentration-time curve by 25% (P < 0.05) and the peak concentration by 30% (P < 0.05). The concentration peak time of nitrazepam was shortened by over 50% (P < 0.05). The elimination half-lives did not change. Accordingly, as far as the metabolism of nitrazepam is concerned, erythromycin does not cause any major changes in the metabolism of nitrazepam. In psychomotor performance only minor differences were seen. It is concluded that the interaction between erythromycin and nitrazepam is of little clinical significance.", 
    "96": "1. Methoctramine, AF-DX 116 and hexahydrosiladifenidol (HHSiD) are the muscarinic antagonists most widely used to study muscarinic receptor subtypes. 2. The present study was undertaken to examine the mode of antagonism of these compounds in guinea-pig left atrium and ileum by comparison of the Schild and resultant analysis. With this method the effect of various concentrations of the test antagonist on the antagonism produced by specific concentrations of a reference antagonist was measured and the equilibrium dissociation constant of the test antagonist-receptor complex estimated. Atropine was used for comparative purposes and scopolamine as the reference antagonist. 3. At the cardiac level the affinity values obtained by Schild and resultant analysis for methoctramine and AF-DX 116, as for atropine, are very similar: these results indicate that the two cardio-selective antagonists and the non-selective antagonist, atropine, bind at a common site with the reference antagonist scopolamine. The resultant plot for the ileo-selective HHSiD has a slope considerably less than unity: this finding might indicate that this antagonist binds to a site different from that of scopolamine and it should be considered like an allosteric antagonist. 4. At the ileal level the affinity values obtained by Schild and resultant analysis are identical for the ileo-selective antagonist HHSiD as for atropine but not for methoctramine and AF-DX 116. This indicates a mutual binding site with scopolamine for HHSiD and atropine but not for the two cardio-selective antagonists. However, it is worth emphasizing that the difference between affinity values obtained by Schild and resultant analysis is seen when relatively high concentrations are required: a dual mode of interaction (both competitive and allosteric) could be involved.", 
    "97": "The mechanism of cerebral ischaemic injury is complex and likely involves more than a single pathophysiologic event. Drugs are available which interfere with numerous harmful biochemical and pharmacologic processes begun by ischaemia. Hence, combination chemotherapy might be useful in cerebral ischaemia. The purpose of the present study was to examine the degree of histologic protection against necrosis using a combination of agents which respectively block free radical production (U74006F, tirilazad mesylate), block NMDA receptors (MK-801, dizocilpine maleate), ameliorate hyperglycaemic damage (insulin) and reduce post-ischaemic epileptic damage (diazepam). Each treatment regimen used has been previously individually examined. Fasted rats were divided into four groups receiving either no treatment, the lipid peroxidation inhibitor U74006F, U74006F plus MK-801, or U74006F plus MK-801 plus insulin and diazepam. One week following ten minutes of transient forebrain ischaemia, quantitative neuropathology was done in all brain regions demonstrating necrosis. The neocortex showed a trend toward a progressively increasing benefit with the addition of U74006F, MK-801, insulin and diazepam, but no clear trends were apparent in hippocampus, striatum, or other brain regions. The findings demonstrate that the cerebral cortex, a tissue of major importance damaged in cerebral ischaemia, can be salvaged in fasted animals with the presently used combination chemotherapeutic regimen, but also illustrate the need to search for combination chemotherapeutic regimens which may be more effective in other brain regions for the metabolic protection of brain tissue against cerebral ischaemia."
