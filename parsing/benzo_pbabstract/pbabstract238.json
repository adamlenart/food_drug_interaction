    "1": "Term placentas from healthy mothers without medication were used. The dual, recirculating perfusion technique was used. DZP (2 microg/ml, n = 4; 200 ng/ml, n = 3) and the reference compound antipyrine (100 microg/ml) were added into the maternal circulation simultaneously. The disappearance of drugs from the maternal circulation and appearance into the fetal circulation were followed every 15 min for 2 h.", 
    "2": "DZP was detectable in the fetal circulation within 15 min in all of the perfusions indicating rapid transfer. DZP concentrations in the maternal circulation were higher than in the fetal circulation throughout the perfusion with both initial concentrations. At the end of the perfusion, the feto-maternal ratio was 0.48 +/- 0.11 (mean +/- S.D.) and the transfer from the maternal to the fetal compartment 18.4 +/- 3.6% with 2 microg/ml of DZP and 0.55 +/- 0.10 and 20.5 +/- 3.1% with 200 ng/ml of DZP, respectively. DZP concentrations in the perfused area of the placenta were in average 2 times higher than in the maternal perfusate and 3.6 times higher than in the fetal perfusate. Total recovery of DZP from samples, perfusion fluid, and perfused tissue was 37.6 +/- 21%.", 
    "3": "Since animal studies in vivo do not accurately predict human placental transfer and it is problematic to study placental transfer of drugs in humans in vivo, the present human placental perfusion system could serve as one part of a test battery for fetotoxicity. However, although our earlier studies and those from the literature indicate a good correlation between in vivo and placental perfusion data, the present study shows this is not the case for all drugs.",

    "6": "The present study followed a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group design. Young, healthy females were randomly allocated to one of three treatments with 12 subjects each: placebo, 5 mg and 10 mg zolpidem. Two word-stem completion tasks were carried out close to theoretical peak-plasma concentration: a) direct inclusion task with cued recall, in which participants had to try to use words seen at study to complete stems; and b) direct exclusion task, in which words seen at study were to be avoided as completions. The PDP was applied to the results in these tasks to yield indices of explicit/controlled (C) and implicit/automatic (A) memory. Classical psychometric tests were also carried out.", 
    "7": "Zolpidem 10 mg led to cognitive effects similar to benzodiazepines (except for the atypical lorazepam), including impairment of exclusion, but not inclusion-task performance. Results of the application of the PDP were inconclusive but concurred with the pattern established in previously published work on benzodiazepine effects, i.e. that zolpidem (10 mg) impaired C.", 
    "8": "Zolpidem leads to cognitive effects similar to most benzodiazepines. Although the application of PDP in drug studies may be counterproductive in view of methodological difficulties that are discussed, the pattern of effects on the stem-completion tasks involved in this paradigm is potentially useful in the investigation of cognitive effects of psychoactive drugs.", 
    "9": "The use of antidepressants has increased over the years, which may be due to more new antidepressant users, but also may be due to a longer duration of use. We aimed to assess the prevalence, incidence and average duration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) use in the Netherlands during 1992-2001. In addition, we assessed the incidence of long-term use of SSRIs and identified possible determinants of long-term use.",

Long-term use was defined as the consecutive use of any antidepressant for at least 12 months. Relative risks and hazard ratios were calculated and adjusted for possible determinants using Poisson and Cox regression analyses.", 
    "11": "Both prevalent and incident use of SSRIs increased during 1992-2001, while TCA use remained stable. A total of 9857 patients using SSRIs were included in a follow-up study. During the follow-up period, more patients became long-term users, either directly after the start of the initial SSRI or anytime during follow-up (29.5%). The average number of days before start of long-term use decreased from 595 days in 1991 to 19 days in 1997. Female patients, older age, previous use of benzodiazepines and being treated by a psychiatrist increased the probability of becoming a long-term user.", 
    "12": "Both prevalent and incident use of SSRIs increased during the 1990s, implicating an increased number of patients starting SSRIs, but also a longer duration of use of antidepressant therapy.

    "13": "To simplify the acquisition protocol of carbon-11 labeled flumazenil (FMZ) positron emission tomography (PET) for distribution volume (DV) images, we attempted to obtain standardized uptake value (SUV) images compatible with DV images, and assessed the applicability of this method in patients with unilateral cerebrovascular diseases (CVD). [(11)C]FMZ PET was performed in ten normal subjects. A DV image and ten sequential 5-min SUV images were generated for each subject. We investigated the correlation coefficient (r) and standard estimation of error (SEE) between the latter ten static images and the DV image using the pixel-by-pixel method, thereby determining the optimum acquisition phase. The same FMZ PET procedure was performed in 15 patients with unilateral CVD. Twenty regions of interest (ROIs) were positioned both in lesioned areas and in symmetrical regions. DV and SUV in the optimum phase for each ROI were calculated to compare the lesion-to-normal (L/N) ratio of DV and that of SUV. The highest r and a low SEE (r=0.957, SEE=633) were observed from 30 to 35 min after tracer administration in the study of normal subjects. A high r (0.945) and a low SEE (0.0438) between the DV L/N ratio and the SUV L/N ratio were obtained in the study of patients. Our study suggests that SUV images acquired from 30 to 35 min after FMZ administration are a suitable alternative to DV images not only in normal subjects but also in patients with unilateral CVD. This simple method seems to be valuable for the identification of altered neuronal activity in patients with CVD.",

The consequences of extended exposure to the human immunodeficiency viral protease inhibitor ritonavir (RIT) on the expression and function of CYP3A isoforms in the liver and in enteric mucosal cells, and on the expression of the efflux transport protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in enteric mucosa and in brain microvessel endothelial cells, were evaluated in rat. Dexamethasone (DEX), a known inducer of CYP3A and P-gp in rodents, served as a positive control. 2. Male CD-1 rats received RIT (20 mg kg(-1)), DEX (80 mg kg(-1)) or vehicle by oral/duodenal gavage once daily for 3 days. 3. Compared with vehicle control, CYP3A activity in liver microsomes (intrinsic clearance for triazolam hydroxylation in vitro) was increased by a factor of 2-4 by RIT, and by 10-14-fold by DEX. Similar increases were observed in expression of immunoactive CYP3A protein. Overall, maximum reaction velocity and immunoactive protein were highly intercorrelated (r2 = 0.89). Both RIT and DEX also increased function and expression of enteric CYP3A, although to a more modest extent (about 1.7-fold for RIT, about 3.3-fold for DEX). 4. Enteric P-gp expression was equally induced (by 2.8-fold) by both RIT and DEX. P-gp expressed in brain microvessel endothelial cells was increased by a factor of 1.3 by both compounds. 5. Thus, increased expression of CYP3A isoforms and of P-gp occurs with 3 days of exposure to RIT in rats. Qualitatively similar changes occur in human cell culture models and in clinical studies, and might contribute to drug interactions involving RIT (and other antiretroviral agents) in humans.", 
    "15": "We examined the antiepileptic effect of cloxazolam on seizures in 23 patients with intractable epilepsy. Most of the patients had central nervous system complications, as well as frequent seizures, and were being treated with polypharmacy. Cloxazolam was administered 1 to 5 mg/day (0.05 to 0.14 mg/kg) at initiation, in two divided doses daily, and gradually increased (1 to 4 mg/day; 0.05 to 0.15 mg/kg) every month at the outpatient clinic. Plasma levels of the main active metabolite, chloro-N-desmethyldiazepam, were measured in 13 patients. Four of 23 patients (17%) became seizure-free, and nine patients (39%) manifested a good response. Both patients with generalized and partial epilepsy manifested a good response. The spectrum of cloxazolam as an antiepileptic was wide. Effective doses were 0.07 to 0.56 mg/kg, and plasma effective levels of chloro-N-desmethyldiazepam were 12.3-115.1 ng/mL. Cloxazolam may be an effective and safe antiepileptic for intractable epilepsy, and should be used as an adjunct to other antiepileptic drugs or administered after other agents.",

In addition, the authors assessed the use of written protocols, criteria used for selecting these agents, and monitoring practices. Questionnaires were mailed to attending physician members of SCCM in the spring of 1998. A cover letter was enclosed that explained the purpose of the survey asking the respondent to forward the questionnaire to a colleague if unable to complete. Four-hundred fifty-seven questionnaires were returned representing 393 different institutions for a response rate of 50.4% (393/780). Respondents were physicians (91.2%) practicing in a community (49.7%) or university teaching hospital (38.3%). The sedative agents used most often were opioids and benzodiazepines for >72 hours, and NMBA utilized were vecuronium and pancuronium for >24 hours. The most often cited indications for sedatives were agitation, anxiety/fear, and facilitation of intubation and maintenance of mechanical ventilation for NMBA. Only 32.6% used written protocols for sedatives and 46.8% for NMBA. Decisions regarding agent selection were based on clinician preference and experience and agent duration of action. Seventy-eight percent monitored sedative use primarily with the Glasgow Coma Scale and the modified Ramsay score. Monitoring of NMBA was used more frequently (91.3%) with peripheral nerve stimulation. The most common reversal agents used were naloxone and flumazenil for adverse drug effects. While many of the respondents indicated they used morphine and lorazepam for long-term sedation, the majority utilized midazolam and propofol for >24 hours despite the recommendation of SCCM. Vecuronium was prescribed more routinely than pancuronium. The number of institutions utilizing protocols for any of these agents was low; instead, decisions were based on clinician preference.",

The high prevalence of co-prescribed antidepressants (59.3% Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) may be explained by the frequent comorbidity of mood disorders in schizophrenia, and by the fact that risperidone was prescribed in naturalistic conditions in disorders other than schizophrenia.",

The results indicate that inpatient antipsychotic treatment practice significantly differs from current therapeutic guidelines. Atypical neuroleptic medication is prescribed to a much lesser extent than would have been expected, especially regarding the official therapeutic guidelines. The inpatient treatment practice of acute suicide in severe depression, on the other hand, is concomitant with the therapeutic guidelines. The results are discussed and the development of guidelines for inpatient routine - oriented towards the current guidelines for psychopharmaceutical treatment - is suggested.",

All the patients were on antipsychotic medication. In addition, 24 were taking anticholinergic drugs (benztropine) and 30 were taking benzodiazepines. A subsample of 39 had clinical ratings for depressive symptoms. Regression analyses were conducted on the memory measures in this subsample, with negative symptoms, depression, type of antipsychotic medication (conventional v. atypical), benzodiazepines and anticholinergic drugs as predictors.", 
    "30": "Type of antipsychotic medication made no significant contribution to memory deficits and benzodiazepine use made very little contribution. However, anticholinergic medication was a predictor of memory impairment, especially with regard to semantic organization. Complementary analyses revealed that patients taking any type of drug with anticholinergic activity (benztropine and/or antipsychotic agents) were significantly impaired relative to the other patients on measures reflecting free recall efficiency and semantic organization.", 
    "31": "Drugs with anticholinergic activity are the major pharmacological agents that contribute to the verbal memory deficit observed in patients with schizophrenia. These drugs appear to act by impeding semantic organization at encoding.", 
    "32": "When enantiomers separated by chromatography or capillary electrophoresis undergo interconversion reaction (enantiomerization) during the separation, it leads to a typical detection pattern: two individual peaks of the separated enantiomers are connected with a plateau consisting of a mixture of both separated enantiomers. We propose a separation method for determination of all individual rate constants (or inversion barriers) of the interconversion. The method enables to distinguish which part of interconversion takes place in the free (unbound) form of the analyte and which part in the complexed (bound) form. Further, we propose a complete dynamic model of capillary electrophoresis of interconverting enantiomers based on solving a complete set of continuity equations for all constituents of the separation system together with complexation and acid-base equilibria. This allows a simulation of both linear and nonlinear mode of separation and understanding all processes taking place in such enantioseparation systems. We demonstrate the applicability of the method on determination of the rate constants of interconversion of oxazepam enantiomers separated in systems with charged cyclodextrin chiral selectors.", 
    "33": "We describe the use of the polymeric surfactant poly(sodium undecylenic sulfate) (poly-SUS) as a stationary phase coating in open-tubular capillary electrochromatography (OT-CEC) coupled with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) for the analysis of beta-blocker and benzodiazepine analytes. The production of a polymeric surfactant coating on the capillary inner wall involves (i) adsorption of the cationic polymer poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) to the inner surface of capillary, and (ii) adsorption of the negatively charged poly-SUS onto the cationic polymer layer via strong physical interaction of the two polymer layers. As compared with micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) coupled with ESI-MS, the main advantage of this proposed method is minimization of introduction of the monomeric or polymeric surfactant into the mass spectrometer, thus avoiding the interference of the nonvolatile micelle in ESI-MS. The effects of buffer pH and applied voltage on the separation of the analytes are also discussed. Under optimum conditions, four of the five beta-blockers and four benzodiazepines are separated.", 
    "34": "In this study, we evaluated the effect of intrathecal and oral clonidine as supplements to spinal anesthesia with lidocaine in patients at risk of postoperative alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). We hypothesized that clonidine would have a prophylactic effect on postoperative AWS. Forty-five alcohol-dependent patients (daily ethanol intake >60 g) scheduled for transurethral resection of the prostate were double-blindly randomized into three groups. All patients received hyperbaric lidocaine 100 mg intrathecally. The diazepam group (DiazG) was premedicated with diazepam 10 mg orally; the intrathecal clonidine group (Clon(i/t)G) received a placebo (saline) tablet and clonidine 150 microg intrathecally; and the oral clonidine group (Clon(p/o)G) received clonidine 150 microg orally. For patients diagnosed with AWS, the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, revised scale, was used. Twelve patients in the DiazG had symptoms of AWS, compared with two in the Clon(i/t)G and one in the Clon(p/o)G. The median Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, revised scale, score was 12 in the DiazG versus 1 in the clonidine-treated groups. Two patients in the DiazG had severe delirium. Patients receiving oral clonidine had a slightly decreased mean arterial blood pressure 6-12 h after spinal anesthesia (P < 0.05); patients in the DiazG had a hyperdynamic circulatory reaction 24-72 h after surgery. In conclusion, preoperative clonidine 150 microg, intrathecally or orally, prevented significant postoperative AWS in ethanol-dependent patients.", 
    "35": "In this randomized, double-blinded study, clonidine 150 microg both intrathecally and orally prevented postoperative alcohol-withdrawal symptoms in alcohol-dependent men. The effect was superior to that with a single dose of diazepam 10 mg orally.",

Citalopram, a newer generation SSRI, is commonly prescribed but, despite its low toxicity profile, has a danger of seizure and dysrhythmias in overdose. This case report documents the key aspects in treatment of a citalopram overdose resulting in a seizure and an episode of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The seizure was successfully treated with benzodiazepines. The SVT was terminated with administration of adenosine. We review the literature and make recommendations on treatment of citalopram overdose.", 
    "37": "E. Hirshman, J. Fisher, T. Henthom, J. Amdt, and A. Passanname (2002) found that Midazolam disrupts the mirror-patterned word-frequency effect for recognition memory by reversing the typical hit-rate advantage for low-frequency words. They noted that this result is consistent with dual-process accounts (e.g., R. C. Atkinson & J. F. Juola, 1974; G. Mandler, 1980; A. P. Yonelinas, 1994) of the word frequency effect for recognition memory (S. Joordens & W. E. Hockley. 2000; L. M. Reder et al. 2000). The present authors show that this finding is also consistent with a variety of single-process, retrieving effectively- from-memory (REM) models (R. M. Shiffrin & M. Steyvers, 1997), the simplest of which assumes that Midazolam decreases the accuracy with which memory traces are stored. These findings therefore do not discriminate between single- and dual-process models of recognition memory.",

    "39": "An automated method for the optimisation of high-performance liquid chromatography is developed. First of all, the sample of interest is analysed with various eluent compositions. All obtained data are combined into one augmented data matrix. Subsequently, augmented iterative target transformation factor analysis performs the integrated tasks of curve resolution and peak tracking. Since this type of curve resolution processes all data at once, it can deal with strong peak overlap and reveal the correspondence of compounds between runs, i.e. peak tracking. The retention time and peak width at half height for each component of the sample are determined for every eluent composition. Next, models are built for the retention time and the peak width at half height. These models are used to predict the resolution and the analysis time for each point in factor space. Finally, a multi-criterion decision-making method, Pareto optimality, is used to find the optimum. The method completes all calculations within a few minutes and without user intervention. By means of this procedure, a mixture of three benzodiazepines is successfully separated using a ternary mobile phase. There are two requirements for the automated optimisation method to work correctly. Firstly, all components of the sample must have sufficiently different spectra. Secondly, each compound should have the same spectrum under all experimental conditions.", 
    "40": "Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine derivative that is currently used in the treatment of generalized anxiety, panic attacks with or without agoraphobia, and depression. Alprazolam has a fast onset of symptom relief (within the first week); it is unlikely to produce dependency or abuse. No tolerance to its therapeutic effect has been reported. At discontinuation of alprazolam treatment, withdrawal and rebound symptoms are common. Hence, alprazolam discontinuation must be tapered. An exhaustive review of the literature showed that alprazolam is significantly superior to placebo, and is at least equally effective in the relief of symptoms as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as imipramine. However, although alprazolam and imipramine are significantly more effective than placebo in the treatment of panic attacks, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) appear to be superior to either of the two drugs. Therefore, alprazolam is recommended as a second line treatment option, when SSRIs are not effective or well tolerated. In addition to its therapeutic effects, alprazolam produces adverse effects, such as drowsiness and sedation. Since alprazolam is widely used, many clinical studies investigated its cognitive and psychomotor effects. It is evident from these studies that alprazolam may impair performance in a variety of skills in healthy volunteers as well as in patients. Since the majority of alprazolam users are outpatients, this behavioral impairment limits the safe use of alprazolam in patients routinely engaged in potentially dangerous daily activities, such as driving a car.", 
    "41": "Anxiety is common in the elderly and can present as a primary anxiety disorder or as a symptom of another disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder, in particular, is a common syndrome in late life. Anxiety symptoms are also common features of late-life depression and dementia. Treatment of anxiety in elderly persons has typically involved the use of benzodiazepines, which are often effective but problematic because they are associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment, falls, and fractures. Based on their safety and efficacy, antidepressants, particularly serotonergic medications, are considered first-line treatment for most anxiety disorders as well as anxiety symptoms of major depressive disorder. Psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy, may be effective in these disorders as well; research is underway to adapt this therapy to the needs of elderly persons. Anxiety symptoms in dementia are poorly understood but may respond to atypical antipsychotics, serotonergic antidepressants, or mood stabilizers. Overall, the research in late-life anxiety has not caught up to the literature in late-life depression and, for the most part, treatment recommendations must be extrapolated from studies in young adults.", 
    "42": "In treating and managing acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia, early intervention may be valuable. The need to quickly control severe symptoms, however, must be balanced with a treatment algorithm that is both safe and effective. The present management of acute psychotic agitation varies among clinicians. Key treatment goals have been to calm the agitated, assaultive, violent, or disruptive patient, minimize the danger to self and others, and achieve a smooth transition from intramuscular to oral maintenance. For many years, intramuscular treatment with benzodiazepines and/or conventional antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, has been the mainstay of treatment for acute psychosis. Unfortunately, the poor tolerability of conventional antipsychotics compromises their usefulness for both short- and long-term treatment. Although new antipsychotics have a more favorable side-effect profile, the transition from an intramuscular formulation has been problematic. Fortunately, the development of intramuscular formulations of olanzapine and ziprasidone offer new treatment options for patients experiencing acute psychotic episodes. This article will review the use of intramuscular agents, standard antipsychotics, and new antipsychotics in the emergency room setting. The strengths and limitations of each will be discussed.",

    "45": "There was no significant difference of baseline characteristics except previous operation history. There were no significant difference of grade of tolerance, pain and willingness to another colonoscopy between the two groups. In endoscopist' satisfaction, the degree of difficulty was higher in MP group than in MM group (39.0 vs. 31.7,p<0.05). After the colonoscopy, systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and pulse rate were significantly decreased (p<0.05) in both groups. However, there was no difference in the degree of decrease between the two groups. The incidence of adverse effect was not different in the two groups. However, one case of orthostatic hypotension with presyncope was noted in MM group.",

Rapid induction of anaesthesia was achieved with inhalation of sevoflurane 8% in nitrous oxide 50%-oxygen 50%. After tracheal intubation, the children's lungs were mechanically ventilated and the inspired sevoflurane concentration was adjusted to achieve an end-tidal fraction of 2.5%. The EEG and BIS were recorded during induction until 10 min after tracheal intubation. The EEG was analysed using spectral analysis at five points: baseline, loss of eyelash reflex, 15 s before the nadir of the BIS (BIS(nadir)), when both pupils returned to the central position (immediately before intubation), and 10 min after intubation.", 
    "49": "Agitation was observed in 12 midazolam-treated and five clonidine-treated patients (P=0.05). At baseline, EEG rhythms were slower in the clonidine group. Induction of anaesthesia was associated with similar EEG changes in the two groups, with an increase in total spectral power and a shift towards low frequencies; these changes were maximal around the end of the second minute of induction (BIS(nadir)). When the pupils had returned to the central position, fast EEG rhythms increased and BIS was higher than BIS(nadir) (P<0.05). In both groups, agitation was associated with an increase in slow EEG rhythms at BIS(nadir).", 
    "50": "Compared with midazolam, clonidine premedication reduced agitation during sevoflurane induction. During induction with sevoflurane 8% (oxygen 50%-nitrous oxide 50%), the nadir of the BIS occurred at the end of the second minute of inhalation. Agitation was associated with a more pronounced slowing of the EEG rhythms at BIS(nadir) compared with inductions in which no agitation was observed. The BIS may not follow the depth of anaesthesia during sevoflurane induction in children.", 
    "51": "Convulsions are major and life-threatening signs of organophosphate (OP) nerve agents induced neurotoxicity. Thus, early intervention with anticonvulsant drugs to control seizure propagation and the consequent irreversible neuronal damage that may occur during OP exposure is essential. Diazepam is the standard anticonvulsant used in the therapeutic management of OP poisoning. However, its use has been associated with several unwanted effects including, sedation, amnesia, and in the large doses used for such treatment, respiratory depression. Moreover, protracted administration of diazepam has been associated with tolerance and dependence liabilities. In this study, we compared the efficacy and safety of diazepam (full allosteric modulator of GABA action) to that of imidazenil (partial, selective allosteric modulator of GABA action) as preventive treatment against diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP)-induced convulsions and mortality. Our results show that imidazenil is more potent and efficacious than diazepam in protecting rats against DFP-induced convulsions and death. Moreover, imidazenil was effective at doses (1 and 0.5 mg/kg) we have previously shown to be devoid of sedation, amnesia, respiratory depression, or tolerance and/or dependence. In contrast, diazepam was effective at doses (5 and 2.5 mg/kg) that produce sedation, amnesia, and ataxia. Furthermore, the combination of imidazenil with atropine was more potent and efficacious than that with diazepam.",

Two out of five men attempting suicide had drug addictions. There had been a reduction of benzodiazepines use and substitution of aspirin for paracetamol and of other analgesics for NSAID. Alcohol was the predominant non-pharmacological toxic substance, but had decreased 11%. Drugs, that had surpassed the traditional poisons (gases, solvents, etc.) represented 40% more than in 1997. When 1994 and 2000 were compared, heroine had not changed significantly, but cocaine had increased from 13 cases to 67 and amphetamines type MDMA had increased geometrically.", 
    "55": "The intention of the study was to demonstrate the appearance of the tolerance phenomenon after repeated administration of three of the most used benzodazepines (BDZ): Diazepam, Alprazolam and Oxazepam using three pharmacological tests, which monitored the neuromotor coordination, the myorelaxing and the anxiolitic effect. For each drug were used 3 doses, in geometrical progression, beginning with the partial dose, extrapolated from human to mouse according to the body surface. The treatment was made once a day, during 4 days. The appearance of tolerance was noticed, meaning an approximately 4-fold decrease of the sedative effect after the repeated administration of the 3 BDZ for all doses used. No tolerance was shown for the anxiolytic and myorelaxing effects, with the exception of alprazolam, which induced tolerance also for the myorelaxing effect. Our study has shown that repeated administration of BDZ might have different consequences on their pharmacological spectrum. The study indirectly explains the success of Alprazolam in therapy. This is due to the fact that small doses have approximately the some efficiency as the big ones in unique administration, decreasing the abuse potential. The rapid onset of the tolerance for the sedative and myorelaxing effect recommends its long-term administration in anxiolytic therapy.",

Aprepitant has been noted to produce modest decreases in plasma S(-)-warfarin concentrations, suggesting potential induction of CYP2C9. Because metabolism of some chemotherapeutic agents may involve CYP3A4, the potential inductive effect of the CINV dosing regimen of aprepitant on this metabolic pathway was evaluated using intravenous midazolam, a sensitive probe substrate of CYP3A4. The time course of induction of CYP2C9 by aprepitant was also evaluated using oral tolbutamide, a probe substrate of CYP2C9. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-center study, 24 healthy subjects were randomized (12 subjects per group) to receive either an aprepitant 3-day regimen (aprepitant 125 mg p.o. on day 1 and aprepitant 80 mg p.o. on days 2 and 3) or matching placebo. All subjects also received probe drugs (midazolam 2 mg i.v. and tolbutamide 500 mg p.o.) once prior to aprepitant dosing (baseline) and again on days 4, 8, and 15. The ratio (aprepitant/placebo) of the geometric mean area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) fold-change from baseline for midazolam was 1.25 on day 4 (p < 0.01), 0.81 on day 8 (p < 0.01), and 0.96 on day 15 (p = 0.646). The ratio (aprepitant/placebo) of the geometric mean AUC fold-change from baseline for tolbutamide was 0.77 on day 4 (p < 0.01), 0.72 on day 8 (p < 0.001), and 0.85 on day 15 (p = 0.05). Assessed using intravenous midazolam as a probe, aprepitant 125/80 mg p.o. administered over days 1 to 3 produced clinically insignificant weak inhibition (day 4) and induction (day 8) of CYP3A4 activity and no effect on CYP3A4 activity on day 15. Assessed using oral tolbutamide as a probe, the aprepitant regimen also produced modest induction of CYP2C9 activity on days 4 and 8, which resolved nearly to baseline by day 15. Thus, the aprepitant regimen for CINV results in modest, transient induction of CYPs 3A4 and 2C9 in the 2 weeks following administration.", 
    "64": "A C2/C2'-exo-unsaturated pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD) dimer 4b (DRG-16) with a C8-O(CH2)nO-C8' diether linkage (n = 5) has been synthesized that shows markedly superior in vitro cytotoxic potency (e.g., >3400-fold in IGROV1 ovarian cells) and interstrand DNA cross-linking reactivity (>10-fold) compared to the shorter homologue 4a (SJG-136; n = 3). In contrast, for the C-ring unsubstituted series, the corresponding n = 5 dimer (3c) is generally less cytotoxic and has a lower interstrand cross-linking reactivity compared to its shorter n = 3 homologue (3a). Dimer 4b cross-links DNA with >10-fold efficiency compared to 4a, and also inhibits the activity of the restriction endonuclease BamH1 more efficiently than either 3a or 4a. The C2-exo-unsaturated PBD dimers 4a,b are not only more effective than their C-ring saturated counterparts in terms of induced DeltaTm shift, but they also exert this effect more rapidly. Thus, while 3a and 3c exert 68 and 35% of their maximum effect immediately upon interaction with DNA, this level increases to 76 and 97% for 4a and 4b, respectively. Molecular modeling shows a rank order of 4b (n = 5) > 4a (n = 3) > 3a (n = 3) > 3c (n = 5) in terms of binding energy toward duplexes containing embedded target 5'-GAT(1-2)C cross-link sequences, reflecting the superior fit of the C2-exo-unsaturated rather than saturated C-rings of the PBD dimers.

    "65": "Patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia pose a major challenge to caregivers since only clozapine is documented as having superior efficacy in this population. Although olanzapine is similar to clozapine in structure and receptor profile, it has not been proven to have superior efficacy for this patient group. Nonetheless, olanzapine is being increasingly used in higher doses as clinicians attempt to find a more effective and tolerable therapy for refractory patients. Furthermore, there are little data comparing olanzapine and clozapine in this population. Thirteen patients participated in a randomized double-blind 16-week crossover study of clozapine therapy (450 mg/day) compared to high doses of olanzapine (50 mg/day). No patients on olanzapine responded while 20% responded to clozapine treatment. Olanzapine patients tended to experience higher rates of anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth (80 vs. 20%) and blurry vision (40 vs. 0%). Clozapine-treated patients had higher rates of sialorrhea (80 vs. 10%), sweating (50 vs. 10%), dyspepsia (70 vs. 30%), and lethargy (90 vs. 60%). Neither treatment was associated with significant akathisia. Liver enzyme elevation and lipids were higher with clozapine treatment. Mean weight gain in the initial 8 weeks was 3.4 kg for olanzapine and 1.2 kg for clozapine. High doses of olanzapine during 8 weeks of treatment did not increase lipids and liver enzymes like clozapine did. Olanzapine at 50 mg/day may be associated with more anticholinergic effects and weight gain than clozapine.", 
    "66": "The anticonvulsant effects of thymoquinone, the major constituent of Nigella sativa seeds, were investigated using pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)- and maximal electroshock (MES)-induced seizure models. We also studied the effect of thymoquinone on pentobarbital-induced hypnosis, locomotor activity, and motor coordination. In PTZ-induced seizure, the intraperitoneally injection of thymoquinone with doses of 40 and 80 mg/kg, prolonged the onset of seizures and reduced the duration of myoclonic seizures. The protective effect of thymoquinone against mortality was 71.4% and 100% in the mentioned doses, respectively. In MES model, thymoquinone failed to reduce the duration of seizure, whereas exhibited a complete protection against mortality. In PTZ model, flumazenil (10 mg/kg, i.p.), an antagonist of benzodiazepine (BZD) site in the GABAA-BZD receptor complex, inhibited the prolongation of seizure latency, but did not show any effect on the duration of myoclonic seizures. Also, pretreatment with naloxone (0.1 and 03 mg/kg, i.p.) inhibited the prolongation of myoclonic seizure latency and antagonized the reduction of myoclonic seizure duration induced by thymoquinone (40 and 80 mg/kg) in the PTZ model. Moreover, thymoquinone (40 and 80 mg/kg) did not have any hypnosis effect in the pentobarbital-induced hypnosis, but impaired the motor coordination and reduced the locomotor activity. These results indicate that thymoquinone may have anticonvulsant activity in the petit mal epilepsy probably through an opioid receptor-mediated increase in GABAergic tone.",

Identifying those patients who have prescription drug problems can be difficult at the time of admission, but the information of the Kentucky All Schedule Prescription Electronic Reporting (KASPER) system can be useful clinically. The purpose of this study was to examine the value of the KASPER system in the management of patients admitted to an acute care hospital. A convenience sample of 58 hospitalized patients was evaluated. The patients' clinical and demographic data were abstracted from the medical record. The KASPER data were used to confirm the patients' history of drug use. In this sample, the KASPER data supplied additional, clinically useful information that was not available from the clinical history or screening toxicology from 30 (51.7%) of these patients. We conclude that the KASPER system has the potential to assist physicians in the care of hospitalized patients who take controlled drugs that are obtained by physician prescription and filled in Kentucky pharmacies.",

    "69": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent (7.8% lifetime rate) anxiety disorder with impairment in daily functioning, frequent suicidal behaviour and high rates of co-morbidity. Fortunately, PTSD is responsive to pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most studied medications for PTSD, with the largest number of double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Of the SSRIs, sertraline, paroxetine and fluoxetine have been the most extensively studied, with sertraline and paroxetine being US FDA-approved for PTSD. These studies have demonstrated that SSRIs are effective in short-term trials (6-12 weeks). Furthermore, continuation and maintenance treatment for 6-12 months decrease relapse rates. Besides being the most studied and effective drugs for PTSD, SSRIs have a favourable adverse effect profile, making them the first-line treatment for PTSD. If SSRIs are not tolerated or are ineffective, non-SSRIs should be considered. Serotonin-potentiating non-SSRIs, such as venlafaxine, nefazodone, trazodone and mirtazapine, have been evaluated in PTSD only in open-label and case studies. Because of their promising results and relatively good safety profile, they should be considered as second-line treatment. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have both been evaluated in a small number of double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The results have been inconsistent but promising. In the limited comparative studies, MAOIs appeared superior to TCAs but patients continued to have residual symptoms. These drugs have significant adverse effects, such as cardiovascular complications, and safety issues, such as ease of overdose. Therefore, TCAs and MAOIs should be considered as third-line treatment. Anticonvulsants have been evaluated in PTSD in open-label studies and results have been positive for carbamazepine, valproic acid, topiramate and gabapentin. A small double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrated efficacy of lamotrigine for PTSD. Anticonvulsants should be considered where co-morbidity of bipolar disorder exists, and where impulsivity and anger predominate. Bupropion (amfebutamone), a predominantly noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor, was ineffective in PTSD in an open-label study. Benzodiazepines were ineffective in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study despite encouraging case reports. They should be avoided or used only short term because of potential depressogenic effects, and the possibility that they may promote or worsen PTSD. Buspirone, a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic, was found to be effective in PTSD only in open-label studies. Recently, atypical antipsychotics were as effective as monotherapy and as an augmenter to SSRIs in open-label/case studies and small double-blind, placebo-controlled trials; atypical antipsychotics should be considered in PTSD where paranoia or flashbacks are prominent and in potentiating SSRIs in refractory cases.",

On the basis of their clinical judgment and collaborative negotiation with the patient, psychiatrists chose one of the three treatment modalities for 102 PDA outpatients. Two stepwise logistic regressions were performed to explore pre-treatment patient characteristics the psychiatrists may have considered in choosing among these treatments. One regression examined the decision to add BZ to CBT, while the other examined the decision to add AD to CBT+BZ. Psychiatrists generally used combination treatments in patients with more severe PDA. CBT alone was a more likely choice for dominant anxiety-related cognitive phenomena. Patients with prominent panic attacks and somatic symptoms were more likely to be treated with CBT+BZ, while those who also had significant depressive symptoms and higher disability levels were more likely to receive CBT+BZ+AD. Patients in all three treatment groups showed significant reduction in symptoms during intensive treatment and reached similar end states. In a clinic setting where CBT is accepted as the basic treatment for PDA, psychiatrists added BZ to control prominent panic symptoms and added AD to elevate depressed mood and help cope with marked disability. These choices appear rational and resulted in substantial clinical improvement at the end of intensive treatment in the clinic.",

    "96": "The first compounds showing efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders was chlorpromazine, an anti-histaminic compound casually observed to possess antipsychotic effects. The discovery of the real mechanism of action of antipsychotic substances dates back to the 1960s, when researchers found that these compounds act as dopamine receptor antagonists. Unfortunately, this type of drugs cannot block the D2 receptors only in the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway (which mediates their therapeutic effects), because of their non-selective D2 receptor blockage in both the mesolimbic and striatal regions, and the consequent appearance of side effects related to striatal interaction in the same dosage range as is needed for the therapeutical effects. Clozapine, discovered in the early 1970s, seemed to represent the solution to contrast these side effects, as it possesses antipsychotic activity without inducing extrapyramidal disorders in humans or catalepsy in rats; for this reason, it was defined as an \"atypical\" antipsychotic drug. Later, other beneficial properties, such as improvement of negative symptoms and of cognitive dysfunction and efficacy in neuroleptic-resistant schizophrenia, were included in the definition of \"atypical\". In recent years, the appearance of new atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone) has opened new ways to therapy. The aim of this paper is to review literature about newer antipsychotics, focusing on their advantages in terms of efficacy and side effect profiles when compared to classical and older atypical antipsychotics, and to evaluate the efficacy of the different new antipsychotics when compared to one another.",

While we await such evidence, naturalistic studies have helped to provide useful information on the pattern of use, patient response, and tolerability of these new agents in clinical practice.

    "102": "Three hundred and seventy two patients with the diagnosis of schizophrenia as per the ICD-10 classification were evaluated in a 1 year prospective study after switching to olanzapine. The SQLQ, Lehman's structured interview and short version of the discapacity assessment scale were used to evaluate patient's subjective experience; in addition, other instruments were used to evaluate psychopathology.", 
    "103": "Significant increases in the scores of the favorable scale and decreases in the unfavorable scale of the SQLQ were found. There were also significant improvements in quality of life as measured with Lehman's structured interview. This improvement continued until the end of the 1 year follow-up after switching to olanzapine. Both instruments show a good correlation. Changes in psychopathology were also remarkable, including the negative symptoms.", 
    "104": "The SQLQ has proven to be a sensitive instrument to measure quality of life in schizophrenic patients treated with olanzapine. It focuses on aspects that are relevant for patients that were frequently overlooked by treating physicians. This drug has been proven to have a favorable subjective impact upon patients, besides improving psychopathology.", 
    "105": "To quantify psychoactive drug use and investigate use-related variables among students of Assis, Brazil, a questionnaire was administered to collect sociodemographic data and identify the pattern of non-medical use of psychoactive drugs in 20% of public and private school students. The largest consumption indexes for lifetime use were seen for alcohol (68.9%) and tobacco (22.7%). Drugs most often used were: solvents (10.0%); marijuana (6.6%); benzodiazepines (3.8%); amphetamines (2.6%); cocaine (1.6%); and anticholinergics (1.0%).", 
    "106": "We previously demonstrated decreased adrenal content of a mitochondrial cholesterol transporter [peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR)] during the first postnatal week in rats, when ACTH-inducible steroidogenesis is low. Here we report that the expression of PBR protein and mRNA increases throughout the neonatal/juvenile period in rats in parallel with ACTH-inducible steroidogenesis in vitro. We also previously reported that chronic stimulation of rat pups with daily ACTH injections augmented the steroidogenic response of the developing adrenal cortex. We therefore tested the hypotheses that the change in phenotype induced by ACTH was permanent, and that the effects of ACTH were mediated by increased PBR expression. Pups were injected with ACTH or saline from postnatal d (pd) 2-8 or 2-14. Another group of pups received ACTH from pd 2-7, followed by saline from pd 8-14. On the final day, all pups were challenged with a test injection of ACTH or saline. Exposure to ACTH, but not saline, for 1 wk significantly increased adrenal mass, the corticosterone response to ACTH, and the expression of PBR protein and mRNA. Continued ACTH treatment for a second week maintained adrenal mass, steroidogenesis, and PBR mRNA expression. When ACTH was withdrawn after 1 wk and replaced with daily saline injections, however, adrenal mass, ACTH-inducible steroidogenesis, and PBR expression returned to levels comparable to those in age-matched saline controls (i.e. animals that had not received ACTH injections during the first 2 wk). Thus, although ACTH was capable of inducing increased steroidogenic capacity of the juvenile rat adrenal, its effects were only manifest when pups were exposed regularly to high plasma ACTH levels. ACTH, therefore, has significant, but reversible, effects on the development of adrenocortical function, possibly mediated in part by increased expression of PBR.", 
    "107": "The antibody-targeted therapeutic, gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO, Mylotarg), is approved for treatment of relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We previously showed that AML blasts from GO refractory patients frequently express the drug transporters P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and/or multidrug resistance protein (MRP). We also previously reported that inhibition of drug transport by the Pgp modulator, cyclosporine A (CSA), can increase GO sensitivity in Pgp(+) AML cells and that the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand, PK11195, sensitizes AML cells to standard chemotherapeutics both by inhibiting Pgp-mediated efflux and by promoting mitochondrial apoptosis. We now show that PK11195 also can overcome multiple resistance mechanisms to increase GO sensitivity in AML cells, including resistance associated with expression of drug transporters and/or antiapoptotic proteins. PK11195 substantially increases GO cytotoxicity in AML cells from many different cell lines and primary patient samples, often more effectively than CSA. We also show that PK11195 is nontoxic in NOD/SCID mice and can sensitize xenografted human AML cells to GO. Since PK11195 is well tolerated in humans as a single agent, its further study as a multifunctional chemosensitizer for anti-AML therapies, including GO-based therapies, is warranted.", 
    "108": "To clarify the possibility of pharmacological mediation on classical conditioning-associated asthmatic response, the effect of diazepam on an odor-induced conditioned histamine release was investigated in ovalbumin (OA)-sensitized guinea pigs, i.e. a model of bronchial asthma. The animals received conditioning sessions in which an antigen (OA) as the unconditioned stimulus and an odor (dimethylsulfide) as the conditioned stimulus (CS) were simultaneously inhaled. After the animals were intraperitoneally injected with saline or diazepam (2.5 or 5 mg/kg), they underwent exposure to the CS and blood collecting. This procedure was repeated three times in order that the animals would have each kind of injection. The animals injected with saline showed significantly higher levels of plasma histamine following the exposure to the CS as a conditioning effect compared with the baselines (P<0.05), whereas the group injected with diazepam (5 mg/kg) did not indicate such elevations. The suppressing effect of diazepam on the conditioned histamine release was also confirmed by a multiple regression analysis (5 mg/kg) and an analysis of covariance (2.5 and 5 mg/kg), even after adjustments for several factors regarding immunological sensitization and conditionability. The present study suggests that diazepam attenuates a conditioned histamine release.",

In addition, preliminary findings suggest that changes in the benzodiazepine binding site on the gamma aminobutyric acidA receptor may be affected in bipolar disorder.", 
    "113": "Further systematic studies on the serotonergic systems of the CNS, as well as the interaction between neurotransmitter receptors, G-proteins and signal transduction pathways are required to better understand the pathology of bipolar disorder. In addition, findings on the serotonin transporter indicate that changes in presynaptic function may be a critical component of the pathology of bipolar disorder.", 
    "114": "Modulation of type A GABA receptors (GABAA) by L-type Ca++ channel blockers was investigated. The dihydropyridines nifedipine and nitrendipine, and the phenylalkylamine verapamil inhibited recombinant rat alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors recorded from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells; nifedipine at low concentrations also elicited modest stimulatory effects on GABA-gated current. The IC50 for GABA current inhibition was lowest for nitrendipine (17.3 +/- 1.3 microM), so subsequent studies were focused on further exploring its mechanism and possible site of action. When co-applied with GABA, nitrendipine had minimal effects on initial current amplitude, but significantly enhanced current decay rate. Nitrendipine-mediated inhibition was subunit-selective, as its IC50 was 10-fold lower in alpha1beta2 receptors. Nitrendipine's effect in recombinant human alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors was similar (IC50=23.0 +/- 1.3 microM) to that observed in rat receptors of the same configuration, indicating the site of action is conserved in the two species. The inhibitory effects were dependent on channel gating, were independent of transmembrane voltage, and were also observed in GABAA receptors recorded from hypothalamic brain slices. The pharmacologic mechanism of inhibition by nitrendipine was non-competitive, indicating it does not act at the GABA binding site. Nitrendipine block was retained in the presence of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil, indicating it does not interact at the benzodiazepine site. The actions of nitrendipine were not affected by a mutation (beta2T246F) that confers resistance to the channel blocker picrotoxin, and they were not altered in the presence of the picrotoxin site antagonist alpha-isopropyl-alpha-methyl-gamma-butyrolactone, demonstrating nitrendipine does not act at the picrotoxin site of the GABAA receptor. Possible interaction of nitrendipine with the Zn++ site was also eliminated, as mutation of beta2 H267 to A, which confers resistance to Zn++, had no effect on nitrendipine-mediated inhibition. Our data suggest some of the central effects of dihydropyridines may be due to actions at GABAA receptors. Moreover, the effects may be mediated through interaction with a novel modulatory site on the GABAA receptor.",

The response to treatment was assessed using continuous video-EEG because the clinical diagnosis of seizure in neonates is known to be unreliable. Of 27 neonates with EEG-confirmed seizures, 5 were excluded because of protocol violations, and 11 responded to phenobarbitone in a dose of 40 mg/kg as first line. Three of five neonates treated with lignocaine responded. Six neonates were treated with benzodiazepines as second line: None responded, and their neurodevelopmental outcome was poor.",

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the reversal mechanism of temozolomide resistance by the potent novel poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 inhibitor, AG14361, in MMR-proficient and -deficient cells.", 
    "117": "The effects of AG14361, in comparison with the methylguanine DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, benzylguanine, on temozolomide-induced growth inhibition were investigated in matched pairs of MMR-proficient (HCT-Ch3, A2780, and CP70-ch3) and -deficient (HCT116, CP70, and CP70-ch2) cells.", 
    "118": "AG14361 enhanced temozolomide activity in all MMR-proficient cells (1.5-3.3-fold) but was more effective in MMR-deficient cells (3.7-5.2-fold potentiation), overcoming temozolomide resistance. In contrast, benzylguanine only increased the efficacy of temozolomide in MMR-proficient cells but was ineffective in MMR-deficient cells. The differential effect of AG14361 in MMR-deficient cells was not attributable to differences in PARP-1 activity or differences in its inhibition by AG14361, nor was it attributable to differences in DNA strand breaks induced by temozolomide plus AG14361. MMR-deficient cells are resistant to cisplatin, but AG14361 did not sensitize any cells to cisplatin. PARP-1 inhibitors potentiate topotecan-induced growth inhibition, but AG14361 did not potentiate topotecan in MMR-deficient cells more than in MMR-proficient cells.", 
    "119": "MMR defects are relatively common in sporadic tumors and cancer syndromes. PARP-1 inhibition represents a novel way of selectively targeting such tumors. The underlying mechanism is probably a shift of the cytotoxic locus of temozolomide to N(7)-methylguanine and N(3)-methyladenine, which are repaired by the base excision repair pathway in which PARP-1 actively participates.", 
    "120": "Immortalized porcine brain microvessel endothelial cells (PBMEC/C1-2) were used to develop a model for measurement of blood-brain barrier permeation of central nervous system active drugs.

However, commercially available inserts for the Transwell system were not permeable for highly lipophilic compounds, such as diazepam. Systematic studies with different insert showed, that inserts with a pore width of 1 microm proved to be optimal for permeation studies of lipophilic compounds. Permeability studies with a set of three benzodiazepines further supported this finding.",

Changes in medication use patterns and treatment costs (1999 values) per patient from the pre- to the post-switch period were evaluated. McNemar's tests were used to compare changes in use of antiparkinsonian, antidiabetic and antihyperlipidaemic agents and typical antipsychotics, while the Wilcoxon signed rank tests were applied to examine changes in treatment costs.",

There was no significant change in the use of antidiabetic or antihyperlipidaemic drugs. For mental health-related treatment, annualised pharmaceutical costs increased by $US1761 (from $US1829 to $US3590, p < 0.0001) but medical service costs decreased by $US3511 (from $US11 292 to $US7781, p = 0.0036), driven primarily by significantly lower emergency room care and hospital outpatient costs. This resulted in no significant change in overall mental healthcare costs. Similar results were observed with total healthcare costs. In contrast, after switching from olanzapine to risperidone there was no significant change in treatment patterns for any of the medications assessed or in healthcare costs (mental healthcare-related or total), despite a significant decrease in mental health-related pharmaceutical costs.", 
    "124": "Switching from risperidone to olanzapine was associated with improved medication use patterns for antiparkinsonian and typical antipsychotic agents.

    "129": "The med(J) mouse with twisting movements related to deficiency of the sodium channel Scn8a has been proposed as a model of kinesiogenic dystonia. This prompted us to examine the phenotype of these mice in more detail. By cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, we could not detect any changes, demonstrating that the motor disturbances are not epileptic in nature, an important similarity to human dystonia. The significantly decreased body weight of med(J) mice was related to reduced food intake. Observations in the open field and by video recordings revealed that the mice exhibit sustained abnormal postures and movements of limbs, trunk and tail not only during locomotor activity but also at rest. With the exception of the head tremor, the other motor impairments were persistent rather than paroxysmal. When several neurological reflexes were tested, alterations were restricted to the posture and righting reflexes. Results of the wire hang test confirmed the greatly reduced muscle strength in the med(J) mouse. In agreement with different types of human dystonia, biperiden, haloperidol and diazepam moderately reduced the severity of motor disturbances in med(J) mice. In view of the sodium channel deficiency in med(J) mice, the beneficial effects of the sodium channel blocker phenytoin was an unexpected finding. By immunohistochemical examinations, the density of nigral dopaminergic neurons was found to be unaltered, substantiating the absence of pathomorphological abnormalities within the brain of med(J) mice shown by previous studies. With the exception of muscle weakness, many of the features of the med(J) mouse are similar to human idiopathic dystonia.",

    "139": "What are the current recommendations for the long-term treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)? GAD is a common disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 4% to 7% in the general population. GAD is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable worry or anxiety about a number of events or activities that the individual experiences on more days than not over a 6-month period. Onset of GAD symptoms usually occurs during an individual's early twenties; however, high rates of GAD have also been seen in children and adolescents. The clinical course of GAD is often chronic, with 40% of patients reporting illness lasting >5 years. GAD is associated with pronounced functional impairment, resulting in decreased vocational function and reduced quality of life. Patients with GAD tend to be high users of outpatient medical care, which contributes significantly to healthcare costs. Currently, benzodiazepines and buspirone are prescribed frequently to treat GAD. Although both show efficacy in acute treatment trials, few long-term studies have been performed. Benzodiazepines are not recommended for long-term treatment of GAD, due to associated development of tolerance, psychomotor impairment, cognitive and memory changes, physical dependence, and a withdrawal reaction on discontinuation. The antidepressant venlafaxine extended-release (XR) has received approval for the treatment of GAD in the United States and many other countries. Venlafaxine XR has demonstrated efficacy over placebo in two randomized treatment trials of 6 months' duration as well as in other acute trials. Paroxetine is the first of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to receive US approval for the treatment of GAD. Paroxetine demonstrated superiority to placebo in short-term trials, and investigations into the use of other SSRIs are ongoing. This suggests that other SSRIs, and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, are likely to be effective in the treatment of GAD. Of the psychological therapies, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) shows the greatest benefit in treating GAD patients. Treatment gains after a 12-week course of CBT may be maintained for up to 1 year. Currently, no guidelines exist for the long-term treatment of GAD.", 
    "140": "What is the best approach for treating patients with social phobia (social anxiety disorder) over the long term? Social phobia is the most common anxiety disorder, with reported prevalence rates of up to 18.7%. Social phobia is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of being observed or evaluated by others in social performance or interaction situations and is associated with physical, cognitive, and behavioral (ie, avoidance) symptoms. The onset of social phobia typically occurs in childhood or adolescence and the clinical course, if left untreated, is usually chronic, unremitting, and associated with significant functional impairment. Social phobia exhibits a high degree of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse/dependence. Few people with social phobia seek professional help despite the existence of beneficial treatment approaches. The efficacy, tolerability, and safety of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), evidenced in randomized clinical trials, support these agents as first-line treatment. The benzodiazepine clonazepam and certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors (representing both reversible and nonreversible inhibitors) may also be of benefit. Treatment of social phobia may need to be continued for several months to consolidate response and achieve full remission. The SSRIs have shown benefit in long-term treatment trials, while long-term treatment data from clinical studies of clonazepam are limited but support the drug's efficacy. There is also evidence for the effectiveness of exposure-based strategies of cognitive-behavioral therapy, and controlled studies suggest that the effects of treatment are generally maintained at long-term follow-up. In light of the chronicity and disability associated with social phobia, as well as the high relapse rate after short-term therapy, it is recommended that effective treatment be continued for at least 12 months.", 
    "141": "What are the symptoms of panic disorder and how is the disorder most effectively treated? One of the most commonly encountered anxiety disorders in the primary care setting, panic disorder is a chronic and debilitating illness. The core symptoms are recurrent panic attacks coupled with anticipatory anxiety and phobic avoidance, which together impair the patient's professional, social, and familial functioning. Patients with panic disorder have medically unexplained symptoms that lead to overutilization of healthcare services. Panic disorder is often comorbid with agoraphobia and major depression, and patients may be at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and, possibly, suicide. Research into the optimal treatment of this disorder has been undertaken in the past 2 decades, and numerous randomized, controlled trials have been published. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have emerged as the most favorable treatment, as they have a beneficial side-effect profile, are relatively safe (even if taken in overdose), and do not produce physical dependency. High-potency benzodiazepines, reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants have also shown antipanic efficacy. In addition, cognitive-behavioral therapy has demonstrated efficacy in the acute and long-term treatment of panic disorder. An integrated treatment approach that combines pharmacotherapy with cognitive-behavioral therapy may provide the best treatment. Long-term efficacy and ease of use are important considerations in treatment selection, as maintenance treatment is recommended for at least 12-24 months, and in some cases, indefinitely.", 
    "142": "Mitochondria sequester and release calcium (Ca(2+)) and regulate intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in eukaryotic cells. However, the regulation of different Ca(2+) signalling modalities by mitochondria in smooth muscle cells is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the regulation of Ca(2+) sparks, Ca(2+) waves and global [Ca(2+)](i) by mitochondria in cerebral artery smooth muscle cells. CCCP (a protonophore; 1 microm) and rotenone (an electron transport chain complex I inhibitor; 10 microm) depolarized mitochondria, reduced Ca(2+) spark and wave frequency, and elevated global [Ca(2+)](i) in smooth muscle cells of intact arteries. In voltage-clamped (-40 mV) cells, mitochondrial depolarization elevated global [Ca(2+)](i), reduced Ca(2+) spark amplitude, spatial spread and the effective coupling of sparks to large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated potassium (K(Ca)) channels, and decreased transient K(Ca) current frequency and amplitude. Inhibition of Ca(2+) sparks and transient K(Ca) currents by mitochondrial depolarization could not be explained by a decrease in intracellular ATP or a reduction in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) load, and occurred in the presence of diltiazem, a voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel blocker. Ru360 (10 microm), a mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake blocker, and lonidamine (100 microm), a permeability transition pore (PTP) opener, inhibited transient K(Ca) currents similarly to mitochondrial depolarization. In contrast, CGP37157 (10 microm), a mitochondrial Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange blocker, activated these events. The PTP blockers bongkrekic acid and cyclosporin A both reduced inhibition of transient K(Ca) currents by mitochondrial depolarization. These results indicate that mitochondrial depolarization leads to a voltage-independent elevation in global [Ca(2+)](i) and Ca(2+) spark and transient K(Ca) current inhibition. Data also suggest that mitochondrial depolarization inhibits Ca(2+) sparks and transient K(Ca) currents via PTP opening and a decrease in intramitochondrial [Ca(2+)].",

    "146": "Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in heme degradation releasing iron, carbon monoxide (CO), and biliverdin. We investigated subcellular localization of HO-1 using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and the expression by Western blot in primary astroglial cells during differentiation and after exposure to glutamate (100microM). CLSM analysis of immunostained HO-1 in cultured astroglial cells during differentiation showed an increase of fluorescence between 7 and 14 days and a decrease between 14 and 21, although HO-1 peaked at 14 days it remained at high levels. The distribution of HO-1 protein undergoes modification in the various cellular compartments. Furthermore, localization of the protein in untreated astrocytes at 7 days appeared prevalently localized in the cytosol and in the perinuclear region. In contrast, at 14 and 21 days, fluorescence detection suggests that HO-1 was present also in the nucleus, and in the nucleoli. Fluorescence intensity significantly increased in glutamate-treated astrocytes during all development stages and the protein appeared in the cytosol, in the nucleus and in the nucleoli. The involvement of AMPA/Ka receptors was studied in glutamate-treated astroglial cells at 14 days by the preincubation of the cells with GYKI 52466, a specific receptor inhibitor, of AMPA/Ka receptor demonstrating the involvement of these receptors. Western blot analysis of HO-1 confirmed the CLSM results. Our results demonstrate that changes in HO-1 protein expression and localization in primary cultured astroglial cells may be part of the underlying mechanisms involved in brain development as well as in neurodegenerative diseases.", 
    "147": "Tyrosine phosphorylation can modulate GABA(A) receptor function, and deletion of the fyn-kinase gene alters GABAergic function in olfactory bulb neurons, as reported by Kitazawa, Yagi, Miyakawa, Niki, and Kawai (J Neurophysiol 1998;79:137-142). Our goal was to determine whether fyn gene deletion altered behavioral and functional actions of compounds that act on GABA(A) receptors. Such evidence might suggest a role for fyn-kinase in modulating GABA(A) receptor function, possibly via direct interactions between the kinase and receptor. Using the loss of righting reflex test, we found that null mutants were less sensitive to the hypnotic effects of THIP (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol), a GABA(A) receptor agonist. Subunit specificity was suggested by the observation that null mutants were also less sensitive to the hypnotic effects of etomidate, a GABAergic compound that is selective for receptors possessing beta2 and/or beta3 receptor subunits. The genotypes did not differ in sensitivity to zolpidem, an alpha1-selective GABAergic drug. GABA(A) receptor functional assays ((36)Cl(-) influx) supported our behavioral results; the actions of the GABA(A) agonists, THIP and muscimol, were reduced in the cerebellar membranes of fyn-null mutant mice. Importantly, similar results were seen with etomidate. Binding of [(3)H]flunitrazepam supported the idea that this is due to a decrease in functional GABA(A) receptor density. These data suggest that fyn-kinase may alter the function of GABA(A) receptors, perhaps via actions on beta2 and/or beta3 receptor subunits.", 
    "148": "We carried out a retrospective survey of 25 years of clinical experience with the use of clonazepam as a vestibular and tinnitus suppressant in the pharmacological treatment of vestibular or cochleovestibular disorders due to different causes. We reviewed the medical records of 3,357 outpatients treated with a 0.5 or 1.0-mg daily dosage of oral clonazepam during 60-180 days. Complete or substantial control of vertigo or nonvertiginous dizziness was achieved in 77.4% of the vertigo patients. Tinnitus was improved in 32.0% of the tinnitus patients. Light or mild drowsiness, depression, nightmares, or lowering of libido, reported by 16.9% of the patients as adverse side effects, tended to subside with continued therapy. We concluded that clonazepam is a very useful and safe drug for the symptomatic treatment of patients suffering from cochleovestibular disorders.",

Thirty tinnitus patients completed a medical audiological tinnitus patient protocol and brain magnetic resonance imaging and single-photon emission computed tomography of brain. Treatment with GABAergic and benzodiazepine medication continued for 4-6 weeks. A maintenance dose was continued when tinnitus control was positive. Intake and outcome questionnaires were completed. Of 30 patients, 21 completed the trial (70%). Tinnitus control lasting from 4-6 weeks to 3 years was reported by 19 of the 21 (90%). The trial was not completed by 9 of the 30 (30%). No patient experienced an increase in tinnitus intensity or annoyance. Sequential brain single-photon emission computed tomography in 10 patients revealed objective evidence of increased brain perfusion. Patients with a predominantly central type tinnitus experience significant tinnitus control with medication directed to the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine-chloride receptor.",

This randomized, controlled, crossover, double blind clinical trial was conducted in order to study the effect of midazolam, used either alone or in association with hydroxyzine, during child dental treatment. Thirty seven dental sedation sessions were carried out on 11 ASA I uncooperative children less than five years-old. In each appointment children were randomly assigned to groups: P - placebo, M - midazolam (1.0 mg/kg), or MH - midazolam (0.75 mg/kg) plus hydroxyzine (2.0 mg/kg). Vital signs (blood pressure, breathing rate, pulse and oxygen saturation) and behavior parameters (consciousness, crying, movement, overall behavior) were evaluated every 15 minutes. Friedman and Wilcoxon statistical tests were used to compare groups and different moments in the same group. Normal values of vital signs were usually registered. Heart rate increased in groups P and M as the session went on. Group M presented less crying and movement at the first 15 minutes of treatment. Group MH caused more drowsiness at the beginning of the session. Overall behavior was better in group M than in groups P or MH. Group M produced effective sedation in 77% of the cases, and group MH did so in 30.8%. It was concluded that midazolam was effective and safe, and its association with hydroxyzine did not lead to additional advantages in pediatric dental sedation.", 
    "155": "Patients with schizophrenia may respond better to second-generation antipsychotics than to older antipsychotics because of their superior efficacy and safety profiles. However, the reduced likelihood among ethnic minority groups of receiving newer antipsychotics may be associated with reduced medication adherence and health service use, potentially contributing to poor response rates. This study examined whether ethnicity helped predict whether patients with schizophrenia were given a first- or a second-generation antipsychotic, haloperidol versus risperidone or olanzapine, and what type of second-generation antipsychotic was prescribed, risperidone or olanzapine, when other factors were controlled for.",

The association between antipsychotic prescribing patterns among African Americans, Mexican Americans, and whites was assessed by using logistic regression analysis. Covariates included other patient demographic characteristics, region, comorbid mental health conditions, and medication and health care resource use in the 12 months before antipsychotic initiation.",

    "159": "The development and function of the vertebrate neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is continually being redefined. Previous studies have indicated that glutamate may play a role in the development or function of the NMJ by associating with presynaptic receptors. We have used larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate the presence of presynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) at the NMJ in vivo. In whole-mount zebrafish larvae, antibody staining directed to NR2A subunits colocalized with specific staining of motoneuron axon tracts. Whole cell voltage-clamp recordings of miniature endplate currents (mEPCs) from axial white muscle were performed during application of iGluR agonists and antagonists. Local perfusion of the NMJ with iGluR agonists resulted in significant increases in the frequency of spontaneous acetylcholine (ACh) release. These increases were blocked by the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist d-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (50 microM) and by the non-NMDA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxalene-2,3-dione (50 microM). Further pharmacological investigation revealed no effect of the kainate receptor-specific antagonist (2S,4R)-4-methylglutamate (10 microM) on kainate-induced rises in the frequency of spontaneous ACh release. However, these were blocked with the AMPA receptor-specific antagonist 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (50 microM). Application of glutamate (1 mM) in the presence of the glutamate uptake inhibitor d-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate(200 microM) resulted in a significant increase in the frequency of mEPCs. These results suggest the presence of AMPA and NMDA receptors in association with motoneuron axons of larval zebrafish.", 
    "160": "Three angiotensin II (Ang II) analogues encompassing a benzodiazepine-based gamma-turn-like scaffold have been synthesized. Evaluation of the compounds in a radioligand binding assay showed that they had no affinity to the rat liver AT(1) receptor. However, one of the compounds displayed considerable affinity to the pig uterus AT(2) receptor (K(i) = 3.0 nM) while the other two lacked affinity to this receptor. It was hypothesized that the reason for the inactivity of one of these analogues to the AT(2) receptor was that the guanidino group of the Arg(2) residue and/or the N-terminal end of the pseudopeptide could not interact optimally with the receptor. To investigate this hypothesis, a conformational analysis was performed and a comparison was carried out with the monocyclic methylenedithioether analogue cyclo(S-CH(2)-S)[Cys(3,5)]Ang II which is known to bind with high affinity to the AT(2) receptor (K(i) = 0.62 nM). This comparison showed that, in the compounds with high AT(2) receptor affinity, the guanidino group of the Arg(2) residue and the N-terminal end could access common regions of space that were not accessible to the inactive compound. To examine the importance of the guanidino group for binding, the Arg side chain was removed by substituting Arg(2) for Ala(2) in the analogue having the high affinity. This analogue lacked affinity to AT(2) receptors, which supports the role of the guanidino group in receptor binding.",

Repeated-measures analysis showed significant improvement from baseline in NPI/NH Psychosis Total scores (sum of Delusions, Hallucinations items-primary efficacy measure) in all five treatment groups (p<0.001), but no pairwise treatment differences were seen at the 10-week endpoint. However, under LOCF analysis, improvement in the 7.5 mg olanzapine group (-6.2 +/- 4.9) was significantly greater than with placebo (-5.0 +/- 6.1, p = 0.008), while endpoint CGI-C scores showed the greatest improvement in the Olz 2.5 olanzapine group (2.8 +/- 1.4, p = 0.030) relative to placebo (3.2 +/- 1.4). There were significant overall treatment-group differences in increased weight, anorexia, and urinary incontinence, with olanzapine showing numerically higher incidences. However, neither the incidence of any other individual events, including extrapyramidal symptoms, nor of total adverse events occurred with significantly higher frequency in any olanzapine group relative to placebo.

    "165": "The developmental neurotoxicity of chlorpyrifos (CPF) involves multiple mechanisms, thus rendering the immature brain susceptible to adverse effects over a wide window of vulnerability. Earlier work indicated that CPF exposure at the neural tube stage elicits apoptosis and disrupts mitotic patterns in the brain primordium but that rapid recovery ensues before birth. In the current study, we assessed whether defects in cholinergic synaptic activity emerge later in development. CPF was given to pregnant rats on gestational days 9-12, using regimens devoid of overt maternal or fetal toxicity. We then examined subsequent development of acetylcholine systems and compared the effects to those on general biomarkers of cell development. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), a constitutive marker for cholinergic nerve terminals, was increased in the hippocampus and striatum in adolescence and adulthood. In contrast, hemicholinium-3 (HC-3) binding to the presynaptic choline transporter, an index of nerve impulse activity, was markedly subnormal. Furthermore, m2-muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding was significantly reduced, instead of showing the expected compensatory upregulation for reduced neural input. CPF also elicited delayed-onset alterations in biomarkers of cell packing density, cell number, cell size and neuritic projections, involving brain regions both with and without reductions in indices of cholinergic activity. In combination with earlier results, the current findings indicate that the developing brain, and especially the hippocampus, is adversely affected by CPF regardless of whether exposure occurs early or late in brain development, and that defects emerge in adolescence or adulthood even in situations where normative values are initially restored in the immediate post-exposure period.", 
    "166": "Psychiatric emergency services (PES) are an increasingly important component of mental health services. To assess the type and scope of services delivered in the PES setting, the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry sponsored an Expert Consensus Panel Survey of these services in 1999. The questionnaire was mailed to medical directors of PES facilities with 91% (n = 51) responding. More than 90% of the respondents were teaching sites. Restraints were reportedly used in a mean of 8.5% of presentations for a mean of 3.3 h per episode. Restraint utilization correlated with the percentage of psychotic patients treated, but not with a wide variety of other patient and service variables. Involuntary medications were used in 16% of cases, though in oral form in 29% of those cases. A large majority (94%) endorsed mild sedation permitting further assessment as the appropriate endpoint and rejected sleep or heavy sedation as an endpoint (82%). Benzodiazepines received the strongest endorsements and 82% indicated it would be appropriate to administer a benzodiazepine alone for agitation first and initiate antipsychotic treatment subsequently if appropriate. When there is no history of prior antipsychotic exposure, 60% favored a benzodiazepine alone. However, given a history of previous antipsychotic treatment, only 8% endorsed this strategy. Most respondents (78%) preferred to use oral medication for treating behavioral emergencies, whenever possible but 70.3% reported regular use of an IM combination of a benzodiazepine and high-potency typical neuroleptic when necessary. In addition to managing emergencies, 82% of services initiated standing medications for patients being admitted to hospital settings and 70% initiated regular medication treatments for patients being released to the community. Of patients started on oral antipsychotics, 42% received an atypical antipsychotic. Reflecting medication characteristics of particular importance in emergency settings, most respondents (92%) cited selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as the preferred type of antidepressant, and divalproex or related compounds (90%) for treatment of bipolar disorder in the PES.",

Three of the benzodiazepines (diazepam, nitrazipam, temazepam) emerged as having substantially more abuse liability than any of the other drugs tested, as revealed by higher scores on abuse liability items (purchased on street, taken to get high, like drug, potential for addiction to drug). The antihistamines (chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine) had lowest abuse liability profiles, while the antidepressants (amitriptyline, fluoxetine, trazadone) and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (zolpidem, zopiclone) had similar profiles.",

The data suggest that the risk of misuse of newer non-benzodiazepine hypnotics may be less than that of benzodiazepine drugs, and similar to that of sedating antidepressants. The new methodology may serve to clarify or validate premarketing abuse liability data, and may help to inform the regulatory process and physician practice.",

There are numerous interactions between these two families of substances. The objective of this review is to present the interactions identified in clinical and experimental studies reported in the literature dealing with their effects on pain, anxiety, sedation and respiration. The exact mechanism of benzodiazepine and opioid interactions remains to be established. It may depend on pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic mechanisms. Certain arguments would support the pharmacodynamic hypothesis: the co-location of GABA and opiate receptors in the central nervous system, the existence of possible cross-reactivity and common pathways of intracellular transduction. The deleterious interaction of benzodiazepines and opioids on respiration may take place at the level of the central command of ventilation or may be related to additive actions on the different neuromuscular components of the respiration. A better understanding of the exact mechanisms implicated in these interactions would increase the safety of prescription of these drugs.",

The polypeptide binds to the peripheral, or mitochondrial, benzodiazepine receptor and facilitates transport of cholesterol to the inner membrane to stimulate steroid synthesis. Through this action, DBI indirectly modulates gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission. DBI can be postulated as a candidate gene for psychiatric phenotypes including anxiety, mood, and psychotic disorders. In an examination of the DBI gene among 112 individuals with schizophrenia, our laboratory has identified 18 novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including three missense changes in conserved amino acids, a coding region microdeletion, and multiple SNPs in the putative promoter region. Case-control association analyses were performed for the missense changes, but none was found to be significantly associated with disease.",

More patients who received medication taper plus cognitive behavior therapy (85%) were benzodiazepine-free after the initial intervention, compared to those who received medication taper alone (48%) and cognitive behavior therapy alone (54%). The patients in the two groups that received cognitive behavior therapy perceived greater subjective sleep improvements than those who received medication taper alone. Polysomnographic data showed an increase in the amount of time spent in stages 3 and 4 sleep and REM sleep and a decrease in total sleep time across all three conditions from baseline to posttreatment. Initial benzodiazepine reductions were well maintained up to the 12-month follow-up, and sleep improvements became more noticeable over this period. No significant withdrawal symptoms or adverse events were associated with benzodiazepine tapering.",

    "187": "The goal of this paper is two fold. First, we attempt to review the reports available on the role of I(Ks) in myocardial repolarization. Based on theoretical considerations and experimental results, it seems reasonable to assume that I(Ks)blockade will lengthen the action potential. However, results obtained with I(Ks) blockers, like chromanol 293B or L-735,821, are conflicting, since from slight lengthening to marked prolongation of action potentials were equally obtained. Although these contradictory results were explained by interspecies or regional differences, the role of I(Ks) in repolarization is a matter of growing dispute. In the second part of this study, we simulated the performance of I(Ks) during cardiac action potentials. We compared the profile of the predicted current in three mathematical models in order to determine the relative role of the current in repolarization. We studied the effect of the cycle length, action potential duration and height of the plateau on the profile of I(Ks) in epicardiac, endocardiac and midmyocardiac ventricular action potentials. The results indicate that the height of the plateau is the most important parameter to control activation of I(Ks)in cardiac tissues, and accordingly, the interspecies and regional differences observed in the efficacy of I(Ks) blockers are likely due to the known differences in action potential morphology. We conclude also that I(Ks)blockade may have unpredictable effects on the length of the action potential in a diseased heart, questioning the possible therapeutic value of drugs blocking I(Ks).", 
    "188": "The slowly (I(Ks)) and rapidly (I(Kr)) activating delayed rectifier K(+) currents play important roles in cardiac ventricular repolarization. Compared with I(Kr), however, I(Ks) has important distinguishing characteristics, including beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation and accumulation at rapid rates that may impart significant therapeutic relevance. Therefore, development of selective I(Ks) inhibitors has been pursued as a strategy for providing potentially safer and more effective Class III antiarrhythmic agents and pharmacological tools for elucidating the normal physiological and potential pathological role of I(Ks) in cardiac repolarization. We have identified a series of 3-Acylamino-1,4 benzodiazepines that are very potent and selective inhibitors of I(Ks). A representative compound, L-768,673 (1) (IC(50)~8nM), has been extensively characterized for its pharmacologic activity. L-768,673 concentration-dependently prolongs action potential duration in a frequency-independent manner in vitro, but decreases transmural dispersion of refractoriness, a risk factor for arrhythmia induction. In conscious dogs, L 768,673 administered IV (0.3-100 micro g/kg) and PO (0.03-1 mg/kg) elicits consistent but limited (5-15%) QT(c) prolongation, and increases ventricular refractory period more at fast than at slow pacing rates, indicating a \"forward\" rate-dependence in vivo. In an anesthetized canine model of anterior myocardial infarction, I(Ks) blockers suppress the development of ischemic ventricular fibrillation at intravenous doses that minimally prolong the QT interval. I(Ks) blockers display an interesting and intriguing profile of effects on cardiac electrophysiologic parameters that differ in remarkable ways from other selective Class III agents such as I(Kr) blockers. It remains to be determined if these properties can be exploited clinically to provide more effective and safer treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.", 
    "189": "Robust biocompatible solid-phase microextraction (SPME) devices were prepared using various alkyldiol-silica (ADS) restricted-access materials (RAM) as the SPME coating. The ADS-SPME approach was able to simultaneously fractionate the protein component from a biological sample, while directly extracting diazepam and the major metabolites N-desmethyldiazepam, oxazepam and temazepam, and overcame the present disadvantages of direct sampling in biological matrices by SPME. The devices were interfaced with an LC-MS system and an isocratic mobile phase was used to desorb, separate, and quantify the analytes. The calculated diazepam, nordiazepam, temazepam, and oxazepam detection limits were 20, 20, 30, and 35 ng/ml in heparinized blood, respectively. The method was confirmed to be linear over the range of 50-1000 ng/ml with an average linear coefficient (R2) value of 0.996. The injection repeatability and intra-assay precision of the method were evaluated over ten injections at concentrations of 50, 200, and 500 ng/ml, resulting in a R.S.D. of ca. 10%. The robustness of the ADS-SPME device was evaluated for future use in in vivo studies, providing many direct extractions and subsequent determination of benzodiazepines in blood. For the extraction of the peptides angiotensin I, II, and III from blood, a novel restricted access material with cation exchange properties was evaluated. The ion-exchange diol silica improved the extraction efficiency of peptides relative to the conventional ADS material with reversed phase extraction centers."
