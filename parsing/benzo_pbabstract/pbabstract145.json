    "1": "Eighty-eight patients (58 male; 21-55 years; 84 White) on MMT were studied. CYP2D6 activity [3 h plasma metabolic ratio of dextromethorphan (DEX) to dextrorphan (DOR)] was determined in 44 patients (29 male; 24-55 years), CYP1A2 activity (salivary caffeine elimination half-life) in 44 patients (21 male; 24-55 years) and CYP3A activity (oral clearance of midazolam) in 49 patients (33 male; 23-55 years). Data on all three CYPs were obtained from 32 subjects. Total plasma concentrations of (RS)-methadone and total and unbound plasma concentrations of both enantiomers were measured by LC/MS. Population pharmacokinetics and subsequent multiple regression analysis were used to calculate methadone oral clearance and to identify its covariates.", 
    "2": "Between 61 and 68% of the overall variation in total plasma trough concentrations of (RS)-, (R)- and (S)-methadone was explained by methadone dose, duration of addiction before starting MMT, CYP3A activity and illicit morphine use. CYP3A activity explained 22, 16, 15 and 23% of the variation in unbound (R)-, unbound (S)-, total (RS)- and total (S)-methadone clearances, respectively. Neither CYP2D6 nor CYP1A2 activity was related to methadone disposition.", 
    "3": "CYP3A activity has a modest influence on methadone disposition. Inhibitors and inducers of this enzyme should be monitored in patients taking methadone.", 
    "4": "We introduce a method for preventing unwanted feedback in Bayesian PKPD link models. We illustrate the approach using a simple example on a single individual, and subsequently demonstrate the ease with which it can be applied to more general settings. In particular, we look at the three 'sequential' population PKPD models examined by Zhang et al. (J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn 30:387-404, 2003; J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn 30:405-416, 2003), and provide graphical representations of these models to elucidate their structure. An important feature of our approach is that it allows uncertainty regarding the PK parameters to propagate through to inferences on the PD parameters. This is in contrast to standard two-stage approaches whereby 'plug-in' point estimates for either the population or the individual-specific PK parameters are required.", 
    "5": "In the critically ill, multiple drug therapies for acute and chronic conditions are often used at the same time and adverse drug events occur frequently. Many pharmacological and disease-related factors, e.g. altered renal and hepatic function, catecholamine-related circulatory changes, altered drug volume of distribution, enteral versus parenteral feeding and morbid obesity, along with concomitant multiple drug regimens may account for the wide inter-individual variability in drug exposure and response in critically ill patients and for the high risk for drug-drug interactions to occur. The practicing intensivist must remain aware of the major mechanisms for drug-drug interactions, among which the drug-metabolizing enzyme inhibitory or induction potential of associated chemical entities are paramount. Metabolism-based drug-drug interactions are largely due to changes in levels of drug-metabolizing enzymes caused by one drug, leading to changes in the systemic exposure clearance of another. Among the numerous drug-metabolizing enzymes identified to date, the activity of cytochrome P450s (CYP450) is a critical determinant of drug clearance and appears to be involved in the mechanism of numerous clinically relevant drug-drug interactions observed in critically ill patients.", 
    "6": "This manuscript will cover a practical overview of clinically relevant CYP450-mediated drug-drug interactions. Medications frequently used in the intensive care unit such as benzodiazepines, immunosuppressive agents, opioid analgesics, certain anticonvulsants, the azoles and macrolides have the potential to interact with CYP450-mediated metabolism and may lead to toxicity or therapeutic failure.", 
    "7": "A series of novel pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD) hybrids linked with enediyne is described. These compounds were prepared by linking C-8 of DC-81 (1) with an enediyne (10-16) through carbon chain linkers to afford PBD hybrid agents 17-23 in good yields. Most of the hybrids on human cancer cell lines exhibited higher cytotoxicity, and an increase in the sub-G1 population than 1. In a previous article, we have demonstrated that DC-81-indole conjugate agents (3-6) are potent inducers of cell apoptosis in melanoma. In the present article, we investigated whether DC-81-enediyne agents possess more cytotoxicity than 6 on human 293T cells. Our data revealed that treatment of 293T cells with DC-81-enediyne resulted in a significant increase of annexin V binding, caspase-3 degradation, and p53 arrest to identify apoptotic cells than 6. These results suggest that the DC-81-enediyne agents are more efficient in inducing apoptosis than DC-81-indole in 293T cells.", 
    "8": "The experience of synthesising a novel gastrin receptor antagonist gastrazole and taking it into 3 small clinical studies in pancreatic cancer in man is described. The need for such a compound is illustrated by the observation that inhibition of gastric acid secretion by H2 receptor antagonists results in hypergastrinaemia. A large number of cell types have gastrin receptors including pancreatic cancer cells which have been shown to be stimulated by gastrin. Small numbers of pancreatic cancer patients given gastrazole by continuous intravenous infusion showed prolonged survival compared with best supportive care or placebo, and equivalent survival to those given 5 fluouracil. The results suggest a greater benefit for patients with early stage disease. An alternative gastrin receptor antagonist YF 476 is also described which has the advantage of efficacy given by the oral route. This new compound requires to be studied in pancreatic cancer and other diseases associated with hypergastrinaemia.", 
    "9": "Treatment with the atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine is frequently associated with development of obesity and insulin resistance. Treatment-induced weight gain has been suggested to be the main contributing factor of diminished insulin sensitivity. This study evaluated the effects of short-term treatment with olanzapine on 12h plasma prolactin and cortisol concentrations in healthy men. The effects of two distinct olanzapine formulations were investigated; the oral standard tablets (OST) and the orally disintegrating tablets (ODT). Recent reports indicate that treatment with the ODT formulation may be less harmful in terms of weight gain than the OST. 12 healthy men (age: 25.1+/-5.5 y) received olanzapine OST (10mg QD, 8 days), olanzapine ODT (10mg QD, 8 days) or no intervention in a randomized cross-over design. On day 8, blood samples were taken every 10min between 0000 and 1200h for determination of cortisol and prolactin concentrations. Treatment with olanzapine OST and ODT similarly increased the 12h mean PRL concentrations and the secreted PRL mass. Both drugs similarly shifted the maximal PRL concentration approximately 3-4h backwards in time. Cortisol secretions rates were lower, but the timing of the cortisol acrophase did not change. Both drugs significantly elevated HOMA index for insulin resistance. In conclusion olanzapine OST and ODT equally elevated the prolactin concentration and significantly shifted its acrophase, thus dissociating PRL and cortisol, while both formulations induced similar insulin resistance as evidenced by the elevated HOMA-IR. Notably, these alterations occurred without a measurable effect on body adiposity.", 
    "10": "To determine the optimal sampling time design of a drug-drug interaction (DDI) study for the estimation of apparent clearances (CL/F) of two co-administered drugs (SX, a phase I compound, potentially a CYP3A4 inhibitor, and MDZ, a reference CYP3A4 substrate) without any in vivo data using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) predictions, population PK modelling and multiresponse optimal design.", 
    "11": "PBPK models were developed with AcslXtreme using only in vitro data to simulate PK profiles of both drugs when they were co-administered. Then, using simulated data, population PK models were developed with NONMEM and optimal sampling times were determined by optimizing the determinant of the population Fisher information matrix with PopDes using either two uniresponse designs (UD) or a multiresponse design (MD) with joint sampling times for both drugs. Finally, the D-optimal sampling time designs were evaluated by simulation and re-estimation with NONMEM by computing the relative root mean squared error (RMSE) and empirical relative standard errors (RSE) of CL/F.", 
    "12": "There were four and five optimal sampling times (=nine different sampling times) in the UDs for SX and MDZ, respectively, whereas there were only five sampling times in the MD. Whatever design and compound, CL/F was well estimated (RSE < 20% for MDZ and <25% for SX) and expected RSEs from PopDes were in the same range as empirical RSEs. Moreover, there was no bias in CL/F estimation. Since MD required only five sampling times compared to the two UDs, D-optimal sampling times of the MD were included into a full empirical design for the proposed clinical trial. A joint paper compares the designs with real data.", 
    "13": "This global approach including PBPK simulations, population PK modelling and multiresponse optimal design allowed, without any in vivo data, the design of a clinical trial, using sparse sampling, capable of estimating CL/F of the CYP3A4 substrate and potential inhibitor when co-administered together.", 
    "14": "To compare results of population PK analyses obtained with a full empirical design (FD) and an optimal sparse design (MD) in a Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) study aiming to evaluate the potential CYP3A4 inhibitory effect of a drug in development, SX, on a reference substrate, midazolam (MDZ). Secondary aim was to evaluate the interaction of SX on MDZ in the in vivo study. Methods To compare designs, real data were analysed by population PK modelling technique using either FD or MD with NONMEM FOCEI for SX and with NONMEM FOCEI and MONOLIX SAEM for MDZ. When applicable a Wald test was performed to compare model parameter estimates, such as apparent clearance (CL/F), across designs. To conclude on the potential interaction of SX on MDZ PK, a Student paired test was applied to compare the individual PK parameters (i.e. log(AUC) and log(C(max))) obtained either by a non-compartmental approach (NCA) using FD or from empirical Bayes estimates (EBE) obtained after fitting the model separately on each treatment group using either FD or MD.", 
    "15": "For SX, whatever the design, CL/F was well estimated and no statistical differences were found between CL/F estimated values obtained with FD (CL/F = 8.2 l/h) and MD (CL/F = 8.2 l/h). For MDZ, only MONOLIX was able to estimate CL/F and to provide its standard error of estimation with MD. With MONOLIX, whatever the design and the administration setting, MDZ CL/F was well estimated and there were no statistical differences between CL/F estimated values obtained with FD (72 l/h and 40 l/h for MDZ alone and for MDZ with SX, respectively) and MD (77 l/h and 45 l/h for MDZ alone and for MDZ with SX, respectively). Whatever the approach, NCA or population PK modelling, and for the latter approach, whatever the design, MD or FD, comparison tests showed that there was a statistical difference (P < 0.0001) between individual MDZ log(AUC) obtained after MDZ administration alone and co-administered with SX. Regarding C(max), there was a statistical difference (P < 0.05) between individual MDZ log(C(max)) obtained under the 2 administration settings in all cases, except with the sparse design with MONOLIX. However, the effect on C(max) was small. Finally, SX was shown to be a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, which at therapeutic doses increased MDZ exposure by a factor of 2 in average and almost did not affect the C(max).", 
    "16": "The optimal sparse design enabled the estimation of CL/F of a CYP3A4 substrate and inhibitor when co-administered together and to show the interaction leading to the same conclusion as the full empirical design.",

We examined the temporal association between diabetes and depression by studying antidepressant and benzodiazepine use around the initiation of diabetes treatment.", 
    "18": "From a pharmacy registry database we selected 49,593 diabetic patients and a random sample of non-diabetic individuals (n = 154,441), all >40 years old. Antidepressant and benzodiazepine use was calculated for the 7 years before and 7 years after the index date. The index date in diabetes patients was defined as the date of initiation of diabetes medication. A random index date was assigned to non-diabetic individuals. Time-specific incidence rate ratios of antidepressant and benzodiazepine use were calculated for intervals of 1 year, 3 months and 1 month.", 
    "19": "Antidepressant and benzodiazepine use was increased 2 months before and 3 months after the initiation of diabetes treatment compared with non-diabetic individuals. The strongest increase in incidence of antidepressant and benzodiazepine use was seen in the month after initiation of diabetes treatment with incidence rate ratios of 2.4 (95% CI 2.0-3.0) and 3.4 (95% CI 3.0-3.8) respectively, after adjustment for age, sex and Chronic Disease Score.", 
    "20": "The increased incidence of antidepressant and benzodiazepine use may be a consequence of the burden of disease, of starting with diabetes medication or of being diagnosed with diabetes. Our findings could also reflect earlier detection by their physician.", 
    "21": "Electrographic status epilepticus (ESE) is a medical emergency consisting of repetitive seizures and may result in death or severe brain damage. Epilepsy can develop following ESE. The properties of ESE (e.g., duration and intensity) are variable, as are the effects of putative therapeutic treatments. Therefore a straightforward method to quantify different components of ESE would be beneficial for both researchers and clinicians. A frequency range close to the gamma band was selected for extraction of seizure-related activity from the EEG. This filtering strategy reduced motion artifacts and other noise sources in the electrophysiological recordings, thus increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the EEG spike activity. EEG spiking was quantified using an energy operator and modeled by an eighth-order polynomial. In a benzodiazepine-resistant rat model of pilocarpine-induced ESE, the efficacy of various pharmaceutical agents at suppressing ESE was analyzed with this and other methods on data collected for < or =24 h after ESE induction. This approach allows for the objective, quantitative, and rapid assessment of the effects of both short- and long-lasting pharmacological manipulations on ESE and other forms of prolonged repetitive electrical activity.",

    "23": "Seventy-six insomnia patients were randomly allocated to an acupuncture group and a medication group, 38 cases in each group. The acupuncture group was treated by neck clustered needling, twice each week, 10 sessions constituting one course, and the medication group by oral administration of Alprazolam, before sleeping each day, 5 weeks constituting one course. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score was used for assessment of therapeutic effects, and the therapeutic effect and changes of PSQI scores before and after treatment were observed in the both groups.", 
    "24": "The total effective rate was 92.1% in the acupuncture group and 89.5% in the medication group with no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05). The cured rate of 34.2% and the cured and markedly effective rate of 84.3% in the acupuncture group were significantly higher than 7.900 and 36.9% in the medication group (both P < 0.01). Comparisons of the differences before and after treatment in scores of various factors between the two groups showed that the acupuncture group was better than the medication group in sleep quality, hypnotic use, activity of daily living and the improvement of the total score (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), but the medication group was better than the acupuncture group in improvement of falling-asleep time (P < 0.05).",

Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used for analyzing whether age, sex, type of residential area, number of other drugs, and concomitant psychotropic drug use was associated with use of BZDs/BZDRDs.", 
    "28": "> or =1 BZDs/BZDRDs and > or =2 BZDs/BZDRDs were used by 25% and 5% of the study population, respectively. The most commonly used BZDs/BZDRDs were zopiclone, zolpidem, oxazepam, flunitrazepam, and diazepam. The probability of use BZDs/BZDRDs increased with age, female gender, living in an urban area, use of many other drugs, and concomitant use of other psychotropics, particularly antidepressants. In the comparisons of different BZDs/BZDRDs (n = 179,632), the medium-acting BZDs were associated with higher age, female gender, and use of other psychotropics, whereas BZDRDs showed the opposite pattern. Also, the two BZDRDs zopiclone and zolpidem showed different patterns regarding age, sex, and use of other drugs.", 
    "29": "One in four of the elderly used one or more BZD/BZDRD, which should be prescribed cautiously and with the recognition of the potentially negative effects. There were differences in patterns of use for different BZDs/BZDRDs, even within the same drug class. Hence, large study populations are needed for future research of individual BZDs/BZDRDs.", 
    "30": "An episode of status epilepticus (SE), if left untreated, can lead to death, or brain damage with long-term neurological consequences, including the development of epilepsy. The most common first-line treatment of SE is administration of benzodiazepines (BZs). However, the efficacy of BZs in terminating seizures is reduced with time after the onset of SE; this is accompanied by a reduced efficacy in protecting the hippocampus against neuronal damage, and is associated with impaired function and internalization of hippocampal GABA(A) receptors. In the present study, using Fluoro-Jade C staining, we found that administration of diazepam to rats at 3 h after the onset of kainic acid-induced SE, at a dose sufficient to terminate SE, had no protective effect on the hippocampus, but produced a significant reduction in neuronal degeneration in the amygdala, piriform cortex, and endopiriform nucleus, examined on days 7-9 after SE. Thus, in contrast to the hippocampus, the amygdala and other limbic structures are responsive to neuroprotection by BZs after prolonged SE, suggesting that GABA(A) receptors are not significantly altered in these structures during SE.", 
    "31": "Utilization behavior (UB) consists of reaching out and using objects in the environment in an automatic manner and out of context. This behavior has been correlated to frontal lobe dysfunction, especially of the right hemisphere. We describe a 60-year-old woman, affected by a glioblastoma located in the right frontal region, who presented with intermittent UB of the mobile phone as the main clinical manifestation of partial complex status epilepticus. Video/EEG studies showed a striking correlation between mobile phone utilization and ictal epileptic activity. Clinical and EEG findings were markedly reduced after the introduction of antiepileptic drugs. This case study suggests that UB may be added to the symptoms described for partial seizures originating from frontal areas.", 
    "32": "Benzodiazepines are frequently prescribed to elderly patients' despite concerns about adverse effects leading to injurious falls. Previous studies have not investigated the extent to which patients with pre-existing risk factors for falls are prescribed benzodiazepines. The objective of this study is to assess if some of the risk factors for falls are associated with new benzodiazepine prescriptions in elderly persons.",

In the adjusted analysis, several risk factors for falls were associated with statistically significant increases in the risk of receiving a new benzodiazepine prescription including the number of prescribing physicians seen at baseline (OR: 1.12; 95% CI 1.11-1.13), being female (OR: 1.20; 95% CI 1.18-1.22) or a diagnosis of arthritis (OR: 1.11; 95% CI 1.09-1.14), depression (OR: 1.42; 95% CI 1.35-1.49) or alcohol abuse (OR: 1.24; 95% CI 1.05-1.46).

    "36": "Several reports, conducted as a placebo-controlled, double-blind study, presented a favorable result in treating MHE. They included branched chain aminoacid, fluzazenil-a benzodiazepin receptor antagonist, lactulose, lactitol, and L-ornithin-L-aspartate. Lactulose and lactitol have been shown to be effective in MHE. It improved psychomotor tests and lowered ammonia levels as well as quality of life. Branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) were reported to improve nitrogen metabolism, blood ammonia level, and psychomotor tests. Flumazenil, an antagonist of benzodiazepine receptor, has not been associated with established consensus on the effectiveness in MHE. L-ornithine-L-aspartate (OA) exerts its ammonia-lowering action in the kidney, skeletal muscles, brain, as well as in the liver. OA administered per orally improved number connection test, ammonia levels, and mental state. OA may be a promising therapy for patients with MHE. A shunt-closure manipulation with balloon occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) has been shown to be effective for hepatic encephalopathy and its efficacy in MHE has not been elucidated. Synbiotic modulation of gut flora. was shown to increase fecal content of non-urease-producing Lactobacillus species and this change was associated with a reversal of MHE. In conclusion, there are no definitive conclusion on the treatment of MHE because of difficulties in diagnosis and evaluation. Therapeutic strategy should be planned specifically for each patient depending on the etiological factors.", 
    "37": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) remains a severe neuropsychiatric complication of liver failure. Neuropathological evaluation of material from patients who died in hepatic coma reveals morphologic changes primarily to astrocytes (cytotoxic edema, Alzheimer Type II astrocytosis) accompanied by discreet neuronal changes. Liver failure results in the accumulation in brain of neurotoxic compounds (ammonia, manganese, proinflammatory cytokines, mercaptans, octanoic acid) that may act synergistically to impair neuropsychiatric function. Ammonia and manganese act synergistically to activate mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors leading to increased production of neuroactive steroids, many of which (allopregnanolone, THDOC) have potent neuroinhibitory properties resulting from activation of a neuromodulatory site on the GABA-A receptor (\"increased GABAergic tone\"). New evidence demonstrates that proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and the interleukins (IL-1beta, and IL-6) are produced not only by the liver but also by the brain in liver failure. Ammonia and proinflammatory cytokines generated either by intercurrent infection or from hepatocyte necrosis in liver failure act synergistically to decrease the capacity of astrocytes to remove glutamate from the brain extracellular space leading to the activation of glutamate (NMDA) receptors that in turn results in alterations of cell-cell signalling and hyperexcitability. Therapy for HE continues to rely heavily on strategies aimed at reduction of gut ammonia production, increased ammonia removal and, ultimately, liver transplantation. A more complete understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms has led to novel potential strategies aimed at decreasing both GABAergic tone, glutamate (NMDA) receptor activation and proinflammatory cytokines. Such strategies hold promise for new therapies for HE in the near future.", 
    "38": "A technique using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC/TOFMS) is applied to qualitative and quantitative drug testing. Human serum was 'spiked' with known quantities of benzodiazepines and a 'street heroin' mixture including some of the major metabolites and impurities. The sample components were extracted from the matrix by solid-phase extraction (SPE). Constituents containing polar hydroxyl and/or secondary amine groups were derivatised with N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethyl)trifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA) to improve the chromatographic performance. An orthogonal separation of the matrix constituents was achieved by coupling a DB-5ms (5% phenyl) to a BPX50 (50% phenyl) GC column. The eluant was focused onto the second column by a twin-stage cryo-modulator. Rapid 6 s modulation times were achieved by transfer from a 30 m x 0.25 mm (length x internal diameter) to a 2 m x 0.1 mm column. TOFMS with rapid spectral acquisition (< or =500 spectra/s) was employed in the mass range m/z 40-650. A clean mass spectrum was obtained for each analyte using mass spectral deconvolution software. The sensitivity and repeatability of the method were evaluated by the preparation of calibration standards for two benzodiazepines, flunitrazepam and its major metabolite 7-aminoflunitrazepam (7-amino-FN), in the concentration range 5-1000 ng/mL. The limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantitation (LOQs), calculated by repeat injections (x10) of the lowest standard, were 1.6 and 5.4 ng/mL (flunitrazepam); 2.5 and 8.5 ng/mL (7-amino-FN), respectively.

Three of the studies assessed elderly populations and did not find an increased risk of death associated with benzodiazepine use, whereas another study of the general population did find an increased risk, particularly for older age groups. A study of a middle aged population found that regular benzodiazepine use was associated with an increased mortality risk, and a study of 'drug misusers' found a significant relationship between regular use of non-prescribed benzodiazepines and fatal overdose. Three retrospective population-based registry studies were also identified. The first unveiled a high relative risk (RR) of death due to benzodiazepine poisoning versus other outcomes in patients 60 or older when compared to those under 60. A positive but non-significant association between benzodiazepine use and driver-responsible fatalities in on-road motor vehicle accidents was reported. Drug poisoning deaths in England showed benzodiazepines caused 3.8% of all deaths caused by poisoning from a single drug.",

    "49": "Recent review articles confirm selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as first-choice drugs for treating anxiety disorders, alongside newer agents such as pregabalin or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and combined with cognitive-behavioural therapy. Benzodiazepines are still widely used by clinicians for these disorders, as shown by recent surveys, even though their anxiolytic effectiveness is questioned. Newer agents are in development and may in the future resolve the therapeutic dilemma.", 
    "50": "Despite current guidelines, benzodiazepines are still considered by many clinicians to remain good treatment options, in both the acute and the chronic phase of the treatment of anxiety disorders, partially because of their rapid onset of action and their efficacy with a favourable side effect profile, and also because of the sometimes only incomplete therapeutic response and the emergence of side effects of alternative medications. Having experienced good initial symptom relief with benzodiazepine treatment, patients may also be reluctant to taper it down. Clinicians should, however, bear in mind the frequent physiological dependence associated with these substances, and suggest both pharmacological and psychological treatment alternatives before opting for a long-term benzodiazepine treatment, which may remain necessary in certain clinical conditions.", 
    "51": "Antinociceptive effects of systemically administered midazolam remain controversial. The present study was performed to investigate its antinociceptive effects on different types of nociception in mice. Four different doses of midazolam (1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.). Saline was used as a control. The hot plate test, tail pressure test, acetic acid writhing test, the running wheel test, and the balance beam test were performed following the drug administration. In the hot plate test and tail pressure test, i.p. midazolam produced significant antinociceptive effects with the 50% effective dose (ED(50)) of 3.46 mg/kg [confidence interval (CI), 1.99 - 6.01 mg/kg] and 3.52 mg/kg (CI, 2.77 - 4.47 mg/kg), respectively. In the acetic acid writhing test, i.p. midazolam also produced significant antinociceptive effects. In the running wheel test, no mice stopped running after saline or midazolam at 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg, but all mice stopped running 30 and 45 min after i.p. administration of midazolam at 30 mg/kg. In the balance beam test, 30 min after i.p. administration of saline or midazolam at 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg, all mice were able to stay on the beam for 90 s, none of them could with midazolam at 30 mg/kg. In conclusion, systemically administered midazolam had antinociceptive effects on acute thermal, acute mechanical, and acute inflammatory-induced nociception in mice. The antinociceptive potency of midazolam was the same for both acute thermal-induced nociception and mechanical-induced nociception.",

    "60": "The control of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is balanced by excitatory and inhibitory inputs. The GABA-A receptor, which is a major target for the inhibitory control, is composed of five subunits. The presence of an alpha(1)-, alpha(2)-, alpha(3)-, or alpha(5)-subunit in the GABA-A receptor protein complex is necessary for benzodiazepines to exert their potentiating effect on the receptor. We postulate that the effect of nonselective benzodiazepines on the hypothalamo-pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) axis is critically dependent on the composition of the GABA-A receptor subunits through which they act. We show here that positive modulators of alpha(1)-subtype containing GABA-A receptors with zolpidem (10 mg/kg) increase HPA activity in terms of increase in plasma corticosterone and induction of Fos in the PVN, whereas activation of non-alpha(1)-subtype GABA-A receptors using L-818,417 (10 mg/kg) likely inhibits the activity. We also show that the alpha(2)-subunit gene is highly expressed in the PVN, but its expression is not affected by chronic mild stress. These results show that the stimulatory effect on HPA activity after positive modulation of GABA-A receptors composed of alpha(1)-subunit(s) affects a selective afferent system than the PVN, which is distinct from another afferent system(s) activated by non alpha(1)-containing GABA-A receptors.", 
    "61": "Angiotensin II AT(1) receptor blockers (ARBs) are commonly used in the clinical treatment of hypertension. Subcutaneous or oral administration of the ARB candesartan inhibits brain as well as peripheral AT(1) receptors, indicating transport across the blood-brain barrier. Pretreatment with candesartan profoundly modifies the response to stress. The ARB prevents the peripheral and central sympathetic activation characteristic of isolation stress and abolishes the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during isolation. In addition, candesartan prevents the isolation-induced decrease in cortical corticotropin-releasing factor 1 and benzodiazepine receptors induced by isolation. When administered before cold-restraint stress, candesartan totally prevents the production of gastric ulcerations. This preventive effect of candesartan is the consequence of profound anti-inflammatory effects, reduction of sympathetic stimulation, and preservation of blood flow to the gastric mucosa. The ARB does not reduce the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis stimulation during cold restraint. Preservation of the effects of endogenous glucocorticoids is essential for protection of the gastric mucosa during cold restraint. Administration of the ARB to nonstressed rats decreases anxiety in the elevated plus-maze. Our results demonstrate that Angiotensin II, through AT(1) receptor stimulation, is a major stress hormone, and that ARBs, in addition to their antihypertensive effects, may be considered for the treatment of stress-related disorders.",

Male adult rats received three 5-day cycles of either 2.5% or 3.5%ED. These groups were tested 5 hours into the final withdrawal for social interaction (SI) deficits (an index of anxiety-like behavior). Ethanol intake was monitored throughout and blood concentrations were obtained from separate groups of rats. Additionally, adolescent rats were tested for SI 1, 2, 7, 14, and 18 days and adults 1 and 2 days after the final withdrawal. Some adolescent rats were also pretreated with the CRF(1) antagonist CP-154,526, the 5-HT(1A) agonist buspirone, or the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil during the first 2 withdrawals.",

Adult rats also had reduced SI following repeated withdrawals from both 2.5% and 3.5%ED. This effect was present up to 1 week following the final withdrawal in adolescents but returned to baseline by 1 day in adults. CP-154,526, buspirone, or flumazenil prevented this reduction in SI in adolescent rats.",

    "66": "Elevated levels of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) are associated with activated microglia in their response to inflammation. Hence, PBR imaging in vivo is valuable for investigating brain inflammatory conditions. Sensitive, easily prepared, and readily available radioligands for imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) are desirable for this purpose. We describe a new 18F-labeled PBR radioligand, namely [18F]N-fluoroacetyl-N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxyaniline ([18F]9). [18F]9 was produced easily through a single and highly efficient step, the reaction of [18F]fluoride ion with the corresponding bromo precursor, 8. Ligand 9 exhibited high affinity for PBR in vitro. PET showed that [18F]9 was avidly taken into monkey brain and gave a high ratio of PBR-specific to nonspecific binding. [18F]9 was devoid of defluorination in rat and monkey and gave predominantly polar radiometabolite(s). In rat, a low level radiometabolite of intermediate lipophilicity was identified as [18F]2-fluoro-N-(2-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide ([18F]11). [18F]9 is a promising radioligand for future imaging of PBR in living human brain.", 
    "67": "Etomidate and midazolam are the most popular drugs among the induction agents for emergent endotracheal intubation. The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of adrenal insufficiency and mortality between the septic shock patients who received etomidate (ETM group) and those who received midazolam (MDZ group). Between November 2004 and September 2006, 65 patients were analyzed in this study. The hospital mortality rate was 36% in the ETM group (n=25) and 50% in the MDZ group (n=40), which was not statistically significant (p=0.269). The incidence of relative adrenal insufficiency was significantly higher in the ETM group than in the MDZ group (84% and 48%, respectively; p=0.003). On multivariate analysis, the use of etomidate was the only significant factor affecting the incidence of relative adrenal insufficiency (odds radio, 5.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.61-19.4). In conclusion, we think that physicians who treat patients with septic shock should be aware that etomidate can cause adrenal insufficiency, and should start corticosteroids if etomidate is administered.",

Here, we examined the role of spinal AMPARs in the development and maintenance of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced persistent inflammatory pain. Intrathecal application of two selective non-competitive AMPAR antagonists, CFM-2 (25 and 50 microg) and GYKI 52466 (50 microg), significantly attenuated mechanical and thermal hypersensitivities on the ipsilateral hind paw at 2 and 24 h post-CFA injection. Neither CFM-2 nor GYKI 52466 affected the contralateral basal responses to thermal and mechanical stimuli. Locomotor activity was not altered in any of the drug-treated animals. CFA-induced inflammation did not change total expression or distribution of AMPAR subunits GluR1 and GluR2 in dorsal horn but did alter their subcellular distribution. The amount of GluR2 was markedly increased in the crude cytosolic fraction and decreased in the crude membrane fraction from the ipsilateral L4-5 dorsal horn at 24 h (but not at 2 h) post-CFA injection. Conversely, the level of GluR1 was significantly decreased in the crude cytosolic fraction and increased in the crude membrane fraction from the ipsilateral L4-5 dorsal horn at 24 h (but not at 2 h) post-CFA injection. These findings suggest that spinal AMPARs might participate in the central spinal mechanism of persistent inflammatory pain.",

Using naturalistic data, we investigated the relationship between the use of adjunctive anxiolytics and the time spent in episodes or with subsyndromal mood symptoms. Methods. This was a post-hoc analysis of 310 patients with bipolar disorder who previously recorded mood and medications daily for 5 months using ChronoRecord software. One hundred patients were taking adjunctive anxiolytics for at least 50% of days; 210 were not. Of the 100 patients, 73 were taking a benzodiazepine. All patients taking anxiolytics were also receiving treatments for bipolar disorder. Results. Patients with bipolar disorder who were taking adjunctive medications for anxiety spent more time ill. Comparing patients who were taking or not taking anxiolytics, the mean days spent either in any episode or with subsyndromal symptoms was 45.6 vs. 29.6%, respectively (P<0.001), the mean days in any episode was 17.1 vs. 9.2%, respectively (P=0.016), and the mean days with subsyndromal depression was 26.4 vs. 16.2%, respectively (P=0.004). Conclusion. While this methodology cannot determine causality, these findings highlight the need for controlled studies of the long-term impact of adjunctive medications for anxiety on mood symptoms in patients being treated for bipolar disorder.", 
    "88": "Objective. Recent observations in Iraq during the period of sanction suggest the existence of benzhexol prescribing linked to its calming effects on explosive behaviours. This inspired our group to research the existence of this practice and the characteristics of those involved in it. Method. All patients from the psychiatric service in Merjan Hospital, Al Hilla City, Babylon Governate, Iraq, who had a prescription for benzhexol between January 1991 and December 2000, were identified. All participants received their diagnosis based on the clinical criteria of the DSM-IV, after taking a comprehensive medical and psychiatric history, mental state examination and collateral information from family members. The patients were evaluated by the same qualified consultant psychiatrist at the initial assessment and all through the period of follow-up. Results. In the 10-year period under study, 354 patients were prescribed benzhexol. A total of 190 patients diagnosed as intermittent explosive disorder (IED) and 164 suffering from severe mental disorders or personality disorders were excluded from the study. The average age of the IED group was 29.5 years. On direct questioning, the main reason patients gave most frequently for using benzhexol was to control the aggressive outbursts (N=92, 48.4), to get high (N=49, 25.8), to relax (N=26, 13.7), to get rid of boredom (N=23, 12.1). In total, the whole group were prescribed benzhexol, at an average dose of 12.5 mg/day (range 2-20 mg/day). At the time of final assessment the mean dose of prescribed benzhexol had fallen slightly to 12 mg/day (2-20 mg/day), with 10 patients being benzhexol free. Of the 190, three patients had a diagnosis of obsessive compulsive disorders, 36 patients had a diagnosis of benzodiazepines dependence, and a further five had a diagnosis of alcohol dependency syndrome. Eighty percent felt satisfied with the effect of the drug and 95 were not motivated to stop it. Conclusions. There are a significant number of patients who are routinely prescribed benzhexol as a replacement therapy. The main original reason for starting it is to control outbursts and improves their reaction to stress situations. This growing issue raises the need for awareness, by both public and medical practitioners, of the potential adverse effects of benzhexol and its untoward consequences.",

Two groups of 10 each ICR (Harlan Mexico) strain male mice were injected: the first with a single daily MDZ dose (2.0 mg/kg/bw, s.c.) at the age of 8 to 29 days. The control group (C), received saline solution. All mice were sacrificed with a CO2 atmosphere at day 30. The brain was fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, post-fixed in 1% OsO4, and embedded in epoxy resin. Semifine sections were stained with toluidine blue and observed under the light microscope. In the MDZ group, the cerebral cortex was thinner than in the control group. Ventricular, subventricular and cortex show delayed differentiation and higher nuclear density per area (p<0.05). The nuclei showed clumps of heterochromatin. In the MDZ group, cells of the cerebral cortex were altered. The neuropile was scarce, coarse and disoriented and few myelin fibers were observed. Control animals depicted a normal cerebral cortex. MDZ could be inhibiting mitosis during prometaphase and actin and myosin synthesis, as well as modifying the metabolic pathways mediated by central and peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors. Results showed that MDZ administration to mouse pups over 21 days induced histological changes in the cerebral cortex of 30-day old mice as those observed in mice prenatally exposed to diazepam.",

The first group (MDZ) was treated with a single daily MDZ dose (2.0 mg/kg/body weight) and the second with saline solution. The mice (10 MDZ and 10 control), were sacrificed in a CO2 atmosphere at 30 days; the cerebellum was fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, post-fixed in 1% OsO4 and embedded in epoxy resin. Semifine sections were stained with toluidine blue and observed under a light microscope. The cerebellar cortex of the MDZ group was thinner than that of controls. The cortex showed a reduced number of Purkinje cells, some with a shrunken cytoplasm and degenerative signs. The dendrite tree was swollen with disoriented branches. Numerous granular cells remained in the molecular layer with few in the granular layer (p<0.05). The nucleus of Purkinje cells and granular cells showed atypical heterochromatin distribution, irregular nuclear surface, and voluminous nucleoli.

On the experimental day, mice were introduced in an activity meter (actometer) for 5 min. Recordings were run at 25 mm/min. The time they remained motionless or clearly sleepy was determined in millimeters. After that, all animals received (s.c.) 2.7 mg/kg/bw of DZ; 15 min later they were introduced into the actometer again for 5 min. Before DZ, control animals injected with saline during gestation showed 1.57 +/- 0.53 mm and the experimental (DZ) prenatally exposed to DZ, 3.69 +/- 1.72 mm (p =0.27). After DZ, control animals remained motionless for 37.27 +/- 6.77 mm and DZ mice, 59.95 +/- 7.10 mm (p=0.03). This result indicates a significantly larger response to DZ in the pretreated animals, suggesting that exposure of the developing fetus to the drug may lead to persistent (14 months) morphological alterations in several areas of the central nervous system with physiological repercussion on motor behavior and learning, sometimes attributed to brain circuitry modifications or to the developmental vulnerability of synaptic neurochemical mechanisms.",

The condition tends to be undertreated due to under-recognition. This is unfortunate, because various cheap and effective treatment methods are widely available. In this clinical lesson, we present case studies of three patients with schizophrenia and severe catatonic symptoms. They were all treated with lorazepam, in dosages ranging from 2 to 60 mg a day, following which they achieved full remission of their catatonic symptoms. We recommend being alert for catatonia in patients with or without a psychiatric disorder.

This case further adds to the emerging literature of catatonia arising with valproate and atypical antipsychotic co-administration, and of non-NMS catatonia associated with CPK elevations. Plural simultaneously - operant pharmacodynamic mechanisms may explain catatonia of unclear etiology and reconcile a seemingly contradictory literature (e.g., the capacity of certain drugs (e.g., aripiprazole, valproate) to either relieve or precipitate catatonia depending on their pharmacological contexts). Besides reduced D2, 5HT2, and GABA-A and increased 5HT1a, GABA-B, and NMDA receptor stimulation appreciated in the clinical literature, stimulation of adenosine, muscarinic, and H1 histamine receptors may also have promoted catatonia in this case and others, whereas the alpha-2 agonist clonidine has alleviated it.

Data were from 58 studies with 3826 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, bipolar mania, bipolar depression, or borderline personality disorder. The primary definition for SWG was gaining >/=12% of baseline weight by endpoint (30 weeks +/-5 weeks); other definitions of SWG were also examined. Potential predictors of SWG included baseline patient characteristics, weight change, and percent weight change at Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 after olanzapine initiation. To facilitate model building and validation, the data set was randomly partitioned into training (N = 1912), validation (N = 1149), and test (N = 765) sets and 2 complementary analytic techniques were used: logistic regression with stepwise variable selection followed by receiver operating characteristic analysis for evaluation of resulting candidate models and decision trees. Approximately 24% of patients gained >/=12% of their initial weight, about 30% gained >/=10%, and 45% gained >/=7% or >/=5 kg by the 30-week endpoint. Baseline covariates significantly and positively associated with probability of SWG were lower baseline body mass index, younger age, female sex, United States residency, and African ethnicity. Early weight changes substantially improved the prediction of the risk for longer-term SWG.

    "129": "Soma(\u00ae) (carisoprodol) is an increasingly abused, centrally-acting muscle relaxant. Despite the prevalence of carisoprodol abuse, its mechanism of action remains unclear. Its sedative effects, which contribute to its therapeutic and recreational use, are generally attributed to the actions of its primary metabolite, meprobamate, at GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)R). Meprobamate is a controlled substance at the federal level; ironically, carisoprodol is not currently classified as such. Using behavioral and molecular pharmacological approaches, we recently demonstrated carisoprodol, itself, is capable of modulating GABA(A)R function in a manner similar to central nervous system depressants. Its functional similarities with this highly addictive class of drugs may contribute to the abuse potential of carisoprodol. The site of action of carisoprodol has not been identified; based on our studies, interaction with benzodiazepine or barbiturate sites is unlikely. These recent findings, when coupled with numerous reports in the literature, support the contention that the non-controlled status of carisoprodol should be reevaluated.", 
    "130": "The substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) is comprised mainly of dopaminergic pigmented neurons arranged in groups, with a small population of nonpigmented neurons scattered among these groups. These different types of neurons possess GABAA, GABAB, and glycine receptors. The SNc-pigmented dopaminergic neurons have postsynaptic GABAA receptors (GABAAR) with a subunit configuration containing alpha3 and gamma2 subunits, with a small population of pigmented neurons containing alpha1 beta2,3 gamma2 subunits. GABAB receptors comprised of R1 and R2 subunits and glycine receptors are also localized on pigmented neurons. In contrast, nonpigmented (mainly parvalbumin positive neurons) located in the SNc are morphologically and neurochemically similar to substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) neurons by showing immunoreactivity for parvalbumin and GABAARs containing immunoreactivity for alpha1, alpha3, beta2,3, and gamma2 subunits as well as GABAB R1 and R2 subunits and glycine receptors. Thus, these two neuronal types of the SNc, either pigmented dopaminergic neurons or nonpigmented parvalbumin positive neurons, have similar GABAB and glycine receptor combinations, but differ mainly in the subunit composition of the GABAARs located on their membranes. The different types of GABAARs suggest that GABAergic inputs to these neuronal types operate through GABAARs with different pharmacological and physiological profiles, whereas GABABR and glycine receptors of these cell types are likely to have similar properties.",

However, a clinical study involving the CYP3A probe substrate midazolam and a different cranberry juice product showed no interaction. Because the composition of bioactive components in natural products can vary substantially, a systematic in vitro-in vivo approach was taken to identify a cranberry juice capable of inhibiting enteric CYP3A in humans. First, the effects of five cranberry juices, coded A through E, were evaluated on midazolam 1'-hydroxylation activity in human intestinal microsomes. Juice E was the most potent, ablating activity at 0.5% juice (v/v) relative to control. Second, juice E was fractionated to generate hexane-, chloroform-, butanol-, and aqueous-soluble fractions. The hexane- and chloroform-soluble fractions at 50 microg/ml were the most potent, inhibiting by 77 and 63%, respectively, suggesting that the CYP3A inhibitors reside largely in these more lipophilic fractions. Finally, juice E was evaluated on the oral pharmacokinetics of midazolam in 16 healthy volunteers. Relative to water, juice E significantly increased the geometric mean area under the curve (AUC)(0-infinity) of midazolam by approximately 30% (p=0.001), decreased the geometric mean 1'-hydroxymidazolam/midazolam AUC(0-infinity) ratio by approximately 40% (p<0.001), and had no effect on geometric mean terminal half-life, indicating inhibition of enteric, but not hepatic, CYP3A-mediated first-pass metabolism of midazolam. This approach both showed a potential drug interaction liability with cranberry juice and substantiated that rigorous in vitro characterization of dietary substances is required before initiation of clinical drug-diet interaction studies.",

One hundred and twenty cases presenting with convulsions to emergency were treated randomly with either buccal midazolam (in a dose of 0.2mg/kg) or intravenous diazepam (in a dose of 0.3mg/kg). Partial seizures, generalized tonic, clonic and tonic-clonic convulsions were included irrespective of duration or cause. One episode per child only was included. The frequency of overall control of convulsive episodes within 5 min were 85% and 93.3% in buccal midazolam and intravenous diazepam groups, respectively; the difference was, however, not statistically significant (p=0.142). The mean time needed for controlling the convulsive episodes after administration of the drugs was significantly less with intravenous diazepam (p=<0.001). The mean time for initiation of treatment was significantly less with buccal midazolam (p=<0.001). The mean time for controlling the convulsive episodes after noticing these first were significantly less with buccal midazolam than with intravenous diazepam (p=0.004) that is likely to be due to longer time needed for initiating treatment with intravenous diazepam in preparing the injection and establishing an IV line. There was no significant side effect in both the groups. The findings suggest that buccal midazolam can be used as an alternative to intravenous diazepam especially when getting an IV line becomes difficult. In situations where establishing an IV line is a problem, buccal midazolam may be the first choice.",

This prospective study investigated the epidemiology and the presence of alcohol and drugs in fatally and hospitalized non-fatally injured drivers of motor vehicles in northern Sweden. During a 2-year study period, blood from fatally and hospitalized non-fatally injured drivers was tested for alcohol and drugs. The study subjects were recruited from well-defined geographical areas with known demographics. Autopsy reports, medical journals, police reports, and toxicological analyses were evaluated. Of the fatally injured, 38% tested positive for alcohol and of the non-fatally 21% tested positive; 7% and 13%, respectively, tested positive for pharmaceuticals with a warning for impaired driving; 9% and 4%, respectively, tested positive for illicit drugs. The most frequently detected pharmaceuticals were benzodiazepines, opiates, and antidepressants. Tetrahydrocannabinol was the most frequently detected illicit substance. No fatally injured women had illegal blood alcohol concentration. The relative proportion of positively tested drivers has increased and was higher than in a similar study 14 years earlier. This finding indicates that alcohol and drugs merit more attention in future traffic safety work.", 
    "150": "Prenatal exposure to diazepam, a prototype sedative drug that belongs to Benzodiazepines, can lead to orofacial clefting in human newborns. By using real-time PCR, in the present study we investigated whether diazepam elicits gene expression alterations in extracellular matrix (ECM) components, growth factors and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABRB3), implicated in the coordinate regulation of palate development. Palate fibroblasts were treated with diazepam (Dz-N fibroblasts) and compared to cleft lip-palate (CLP) fibroblasts obtained from patients with no known exposure to diazepam or other teratogens. Untreated fibroblasts from non-CLP patients were used as control. The results showed significant convergences in gene expression pattern of collagens, fibromodulin, vitronectin, tenascin C, integrins and metalloprotease MMP13 between Dz-N and CLP fibroblasts. Among the growth factors, constitutive Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) was greatly enhanced in Dz-N and CLP fibroblasts and associated with a higher reduction of FGF receptor. Transforming Growth Factor beta 3 (TGFbeta(3)) resulted up-regulated in CLP fibroblasts and decreased in Dz-N fibroblasts. We found phenotypic differences exhibited by Dz-N and CLP fibroblasts in GABRB3 gene regulation, so further studies are necessary to determine whether GABAergic system could be involved in the development of diazepam mediated CLP phenotype. Taken together the results elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying possible toxicology effects induced by diazepam. Counselling of women on the safety of diazepam exposure is clinically important, also for the forensic consequences.",

In search for an efficacious and safer anticonvulsant benzodiazepine, we studied imidazenil, a potent anticonvulsant that is devoid of sedative action and has a low intrinsic efficacy at alpha1- but is a high efficacy positive allosteric modulator at alpha5-containing GABA(A) receptors. We compared the potency of a combination of 2 mg/kg, i.p. atropine with: (a) imidazenil 0.05-0.5 mg/kg i.p. or (b) equipotent anti-bicuculline doses of diazepam (0.5-5 mg/kg, i.p.), against diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP; 1.5 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced status epilepticus and its associated neuronal damage. The severity and frequency of seizure activities were determined by continuous radio telemetry recordings while the extent of neuronal damage and neuronal degeneration were assessed using the TUNEL-based cleaved DNA end-labeling technique or neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN)-immunolabeling and Fluoro-Jade B (FJB) staining, respectively. We report here that the combination of atropine and imidazenil is at least 10-fold more potent and longer lasting than the combination with diazepam at protecting rats from DFP-induced seizures and the associated neuronal damage or ongoing degeneration in the anterior cingulate cortex, CA1 hippocampus, and dentate gyrus. While 0.5 mg/kg imidazenil effectively attenuated DFP-induced neuronal damage and the ongoing neuronal degeneration in the anterior cingulate cortex, dentate gyrus, and CA1 hippocampus, 5 mg/kg or a higher dose of diazepam is required to produce similar protective effects. These finding suggests that imidazenil, a non-sedating anticonvulsant BZ ligand, is a more potent, effective, and safer drug than diazepam in protecting rats from DFP-induced seizures and the associated neuronal damage and/or ongoing neuronal degeneration.", 
    "156": "Elevated brain monoamine concentrations resulting from monoamine oxidase A genetic ablation (MAOA knock-out mice) lead to changes in other neurotransmitter systems. To investigate the consequences of MAOA deficiency on the cholinergic system, we measured ligand binding to the high-affinity choline transporter (CHT1) and to muscarinic and nicotinic receptors in brain sections of MAOA knock-out (KO) and wild-type mice. A twofold increase in [(3)H]-hemicholinium-3 ([(3)H]-HC-3) binding to CHT1 was observed in the caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, and motor cortex in MAOA KO mice as compared with wild-type (WT) mice. There was no difference in [(3)H]-HC-3 labeling in the hippocampus (dentate gyrus) between the two genotypes. Binding of [(125)I]-epibatidine ([(125)I]-Epi), [(125)I]-alpha-bungarotoxin ([(125)I]-BGT), [(3)H]-pirenzepine ([(3)H]-PZR), and [(3)H]-AFDX-384 ([(3)H]-AFX), which respectively label high- and low-affinity nicotinic receptors, M1 and M2 muscarinic cholinergic receptors, was not modified in the caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, and motor cortex. A small but significant decrease of 19% in M1 binding densities was observed in the hippocampus (CA1 field) of KO mice. Next, we tested acetylcholinesterase activity and found that it was decreased by 25% in the striatum of KO mice as compared with WT mice. Our data suggest that genetic deficiency in MAOA enzyme is associated with changes in cholinergic activity, which may account for some of the behavioral alterations observed in mice and humans lacking MAOA.",

Induction and recovery times were recorded. Pulse rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and oxygen saturation were measured. Anesthesia depth indicators were observed. There was no significant difference between the M-K and the M-M groups regarding induction time (6:14 +/- 1:45 and 7:16 +/- 2:09 min, respectively). Both combinations provided safe and effective immobilization for at least 20-30 min. Pulse rate was significantly higher in the M-K group. There was no significant difference in any other objective or subjective parameter. Following administration of atipamezole at five times the dose of medetomidine given, there was a significant difference between the two combinations in recovery time; M-K jackals were standing within 3:42 +/- 2:17 min and M-M jackals within 8:47 +/- 4:32 min. Neither of the combinations caused rough or prolonged recovery. Subjectively, the M-M group had smoother and less ataxic recovery.",

Samples were diluted with water (2:1, v:v) and extracted with a hydrophobic-lipophilic balanced copolymer. The method was fully validated according to ICH guidelines and SFSTP protocols. Deuterated internal standards of both parent drugs were used and good quantitative performance was achieved in terms of trueness and precision (repeatability and intermediate precision) since accuracy profiles were achieved within the acceptance limits (+/-30% for biological samples). The LC-APPI-MS method was linear over the concentration range of 1-1000 and 3-1000 ng/mL, for alprazolam and flunitrazepam, respectively. Lower limits of quantification as low as 1 ng/mL in haemolysed blood were reached and the method was successfully applied to the quantification of alprazolam, flunitrazepam and their major metabolites in real toxicological samples.",

Weight gain under atypical antipsychotics (pre-treatment excluded) is predicted by an increased premorbid BMI (p=0.019). Conversely, a low BMI prior to first antipsychotic treatment predicts a higher acceleration of BMI change (p=0.008) in vulnerable individuals, but not total BMI change itself. Furthermore, a diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder showed a trend towards the prediction of an increased atypical DeltaBMI (p=0.067), possibly due to a longer treatment duration with atypical antipsychotics (p<0.001).",

    "164": "An abstract of this study was presented at the American Association for Dental Research (AADR) Dental Anesthesiology Research Group in Honolulu, Hawaii, in March of 2004. This study was conducted to correlate the intraoperative and postoperative morbidity associated with moderate and deep sedation, also known as monitored anesthesia care (MAC), provided in a General Practice Residency (GPR) clinic under the supervision of a dentist anesthesiologist. After internal review board approval was obtained, 100 parenteral moderate and deep sedation cases performed by the same dentist anesthesiologist in collaboration with second year GPR residents were randomly selected and reviewed by 2 independent evaluators. Eleven morbidity criteria were assessed and were correlated with patient age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Status Classification (ASAPS), duration of procedure, and anesthetic protocol. A total of 39 males and 61 females were evaluated. Patients' ASAPS were classified as I, II, and III, with the average ASAPS of 1.61 and the standard deviation (STDEV) of 0.584. No ASPS IV or V was noted. Average patient age was 33.8 years (STDEV, 14.57), and the average duration of procedure was 97.5 minutes (STDEV, 42.39). Three incidents of postoperative nausea and vomiting were reported. All 3 incidents involved the ketamine-midazolam-propofol anesthetic combination. All patients were treated and were well controlled with ondansetron. One incident of tongue biting in an autistic child was regarded as an effect of local anesthesia. One patient demonstrated intermittent premature atrial contractions (PACs) intraoperatively but was stable. Moderate and deep sedation, also known as MAC, is safe and beneficial in an outpatient GPR setting with proper personnel and monitoring. This study did not demonstrate a correlation between length of procedure and morbidity. Ketamine was associated with all reported nausea and vomiting incidents because propofol and midazolam are rarely associated with such events.", 
    "165": "In vitro interaction of a benzodiazepine group of drugs Alprazolam (Alp), a hypnotic and tranquilizer, with DNA was studied by various methods. Absorption spectrophotometric study showed that Alp binds strongly with supercoiled pUC 19 DNA and the calculated binding constant is 8.245x10(3) M(-1) in 10 mM Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.4. Spectrofluorometric study showed that ethidium bromide induced DNA fluorescence intensity was reduced completely after addition of Alp. But Alp did not interfere with the interaction of Hoechst 33258, a DNA minor groove binder, with plasmid DNA. Circular dichroic spectroscopic study showed that with the gradual increase in Alp concentrations, both the positive and the negative peaks of DNA were gradually decreased and at higher concentrations of Alp (60 microM and 80 microM), the negative peaks became positive indicating the intercalation and the conformational change in the DNA. Binding of Alp with DNA increased the thermal stability of DNA by 6 degrees C with respect to the mock treated sample. Gel electrophoresis study of supercoiled pUC 19 DNA showed more compact structure as a result of Alp binding. Transmission electron microscopic observations also confirmed this compactness. Thus, our observations suggest the strong interaction of Alp with DNA, which may raise serious questions about the random uses of Alprazolam.",

    "175": "The administration of antipsychotic drugs to human patients or experimental animals leads to significant weight gain, which is widely presumed to be driven by hyperphagia; however, the contribution from energy expenditure remains unclear. These studies aim to examine the contribution of shifts in energy expenditure, particularly those involving centrally mediated changes in thermogenesis, to the body weight gain associated with the administration of olanzapine to female Sprague Dawley rats. Olanzapine (6 mg/kg/day orally) caused a transient increase in food intake but a maintained increase in body weight. When pair-fed rats were treated with olanzapine, body weight continued to rise compared to vehicle-treated rats, consistent with a reduction in energy expenditure. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) temperature, measured using biotelemetry devices, decreased immediately after the onset of olanzapine treatment and remained depressed, as did physical activity. UCP1 expression in interscapular BAT was reduced following chronic olanzapine treatment. An acute injection of olanzapine was preceded by an injection of a retrograde tracer into the spinal cord to evaluate the nature of the olanzapine-activated neural pathway. Levels of Fos protein in a number of spinally projecting neurons within discrete hypothalamic and brainstem sites were elevated in olanzapine-treated rats. Some of these neurons in the perifornical region of the lateral hypothalamus (LHA) were also Orexin A positive. These data collectively show a significant impact of thermogenesis (and physical activity) on the weight gain associated with olanzapine treatment. The anatomical studies provide an insight into the central neuroanatomical substrate that may subserve the altered thermogenic responses brought about by olanzapine.",

Although widely studied in laboratory animals, little is known about the abuse-related behavioral effects of methamphetamine relative to other abused stimulants in controlled laboratory settings in humans. The aim of this study was to examine the discriminative stimulus, subject-rated, performance, and cardiovascular effects of methamphetamine in humans. In the present study, subjects first learned to discriminate 10 mg of oral methamphetamine from placebo. After acquiring the discrimination (> or = 80% drug-appropriate responding on four consecutive sessions), a range of oral doses of methamphetamine (2.5-15 mg), d-amphetamine (2.5-15 mg), methylphenidate (5-30 mg), and triazolam (0.0625-0.375 mg) was tested. Methamphetamine functioned as a discriminative stimulus and produced prototypical stimulant-like subject-rated effects. d-Amphetamine and methylphenidate produced dose-related increases in methamphetamine-appropriate responding, whereas triazolam did not. d-Amphetamine and methylphenidate produced stimulant-like behavioral effects, whereas triazolam produced sedative-like effects. Methamphetamine, but no other drug, increased heart rate, systolic pressure, and diastolic pressure significantly above placebo levels. Performance in the Digit-Symbol Substitution Test was not affected by any of the drugs tested. Overall, these results demonstrate that the acute behavioral effects of methamphetamine, d-amphetamine, and methylphenidate overlap extensively in humans, which is concordant with findings from preclinical studies. Future studies should assess whether the similarity in the behavioral effects of methamphetamine and related stimulants can be extended to other behavioral assays, such as measures of reinforcement, in humans.",
