Plasma samples were protein precipitated with acetonitrile. The chromatographic separation was achieved using a UPLC\u00ae BEH C18 column (2.1\u2009\u00d7\u2009100\u2009mm, 1.7\u2009\u00b5m). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and water (containing 0.1% formic acid) with gradient elution. The triple quadrupole mass spectrometric detection was operated by multiple reaction monitoring in positive electrospray ionization. The precisions were <13%, and the accuracy ranged from 93.3 to 110.4%. The extraction efficiency was >90.5%, and the matrix effects ranged from 84.3 to 114.2%. The calibration curves in plasma were linear in the range of 2-2000\u2009ng/mL, with correlation coefficient (r(2) ) >0.995. The method was successfully applied to pharmacokinetic studies of the six probe drugs of the six CYP450 isoforms and used to evaluate the effects of erlotinib on the activities of CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 in rats. Erlotinib may inhibit the activity of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, and may induce CYP2C9 of rats.",

As a positive control, the anti-anxiety effects of different doses of the selective GABAA receptor agonist muscimol were also analyzed. In order to evaluate the participation of the GABAA and oxytocin receptors in the anxiolytic-like actions of MT, the GABAA receptors blockers picrotoxin (0.25 and 0.50 mg/kg), bicuculline (2.0 mg/kg) and flumazenil (5.00 and 10.0 mg/kg), the neurosteroid inhibitor finasteride (50.0 and 100 mg/kg) and the oxytocin receptor antagonist atosiban (0.25 \u00b5g) were used.

More importantly, deuterated standards are not required in the new method, thus significantly improving its cost-effectiveness and extending its applicability to a wide range of analytes lack of deuterated analogs serving as internal standards. In addition, mass spectrometry is not necessary for the quantification of analytes with the new calibration method, which may further extend the applicability of PE-HF-LPME to some laboratories without mass spectrometers. This study has been substantiated with both theoretical and experimental evidences. Further, the feasibility of the method for real biological samples was demonstrated by measuring the free concentration of flunitrazepam in urine and plasma samples and its drug-protein binding ratio in plasma. The results showed that the method had a short analysis time and was easily implemented with high accuracy and good reproducibility.", 
    "23": "Depression and anxiety often co-occur, and conventional monoamine-facilitating antidepressants show efficacy against symptoms in both disorders. Rodent studies indicate that antidepressant effects of monoamine-based antidepressants involve increased \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5- methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid glutamate receptor (AMPAR) neurotransmission, and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) at AMPARs produced antidepressant-like effects in rodents. While this suggests that increased AMPAR-mediated neurotransmission is beneficial in depression management, preclinical studies addressing AMPARs in relation to anxiety have given ambiguous results with both anxiolytic-like and anxiogenic-like effects observed after AMPAR blockade. This study systematically compared the effects of the AMPAR potentiator LY451646 and the AMPAR antagonist GYKI-53655 on depression-related behaviour using the mouse forced swim (FST) and tail suspension tests (TST), and anxiety-related behaviour using the elevated zero maze (EZM), marble burying (MB) and novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) tests. The serotonin-selective antidepressant citalopram was included for comparison. Due to the importance of AMPARs in learning and memory we also tested if GYKI-53655 disrupted performance in the V-maze test for attention-dependent behaviour, and the social transmission of food preference (STFP) test of long-term memory. LY451646 (3 mg/kg) showed an antidepressant-like profile in the FST and TST, and GYKI-53655 (\u2265 5 mg/kg) had a depressogenic-like effect in the TST but no effect in the FST. Conversely, GYKI-53655 produced marked anxiolytic-like effects in the EZM (\u2265 2.5 mg/kg), MBT (\u2265 2.5 mg/kg), and NIH tests (\u2265 5 mg/kg), while LY451646 (\u2265 3 mg/kg) increased anxiety-like behaviour in the EZM. Citalopram showed an antidepressant-like effect in the FST (\u2265 10 mg/kg), but not TST, an anxiolytic-like effect in the EZM (\u2265 3 mg/kg) and MB test (\u2265 2.5 mg/kg), and an anxiogenic-like effect in the NIH test (\u2265 30 mg/kg). GYKI-53655 did not affect cognitive performance in the V-maze or STFP tests. Collectively, these findings suggest a differential role of AMPARs in depression and anxiety, with AMPAR activation promoting antidepressant responses and AMPAR inhibition promoting anxiolytic responses. The potential of AMPARs as a novel target in depression and anxiety pharmacotherapy is discussed.", 
    "24": "Over the past two decades, there has been an upsurge of interest in catatonia, which is reflected in the attention it received in DSM 5, where it appears as a separate subsection of the Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders (APA, 2013). This commentary argues that due to the lack of solid scientific evidence, the extended coverage of catatonia in DSM 5 was a premature, and consequently, a necessarily ambiguous decision. The psychopathological foundations of the modern catatonia concept are lacking therefore its boundaries are fuzzy. There are only a few, methodologically sound clinical, treatment response and small-scale neurobiological studies. The widely recommended use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of catatonia is based on case reports and open-label studies instead of placebo-controlled, randomized trials. In conclusion, the catatonic concept espoused by DSM 5 is necessarily vague reflecting the current state of knowledge.",

Post-mortem studies indicated that NRG1-ErbB4 signalling is impaired in schizophrenia subjects. This study investigated whether short- or long-term antipsychotic treatment has different effects on the expression of NRG1 and ErbB4 receptors. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated orally with either aripiprazole (0.75 mg/kg), haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg), olanzapine (0.5 mg/kg), or vehicle, 3 times/day for 1 or 12 weeks. Western blotting was performed to examine the expression of NRG1 isoforms (135 kDa, 70 kDa and 40 kDa) and ErbB4 receptors. Both 1-week haloperidol and olanzapine treatment increased NRG1-70kDa expression in the hippocampus; haloperidol also up-regulated ErbB4 levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In the 12-week group, aripiprazole decreased the expression of all three NRG1 isoforms and ErbB4 receptors in the PFC, NRG1-70 kDa and -40 kDa in the cingulate cortex (Cg), and NRG1-135 kDa, -70 kDa and ErbB4 receptors in the hippocampus; haloperidol reduced NRG1-135 kDa in the PFC, NRG1-40 kDa in all three brain regions, and ErbB4 receptor levels in the PFC and hippocampus; NRG1-40 kDa in the PFC and Cg was also down-regulated by olanzapine. These results suggest that the time-dependent and region-specific effects of antipsychotics on NRG1-ErbB4 signalling may contribute to the efficacy of antipsychotics to treat schizophrenia.", 
    "27": "Entorhinal cortex is a highly epilepsy-prone brain region. Effects of repetitive seizures on ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) were investigated in rat entorhinal cortex slices. Seizures were induced by daily administration of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). Electrophysiological, pharmacological and histological investigations were carried out to determine changes in synaptic efficacy and in sensitivity of iGluRs due to recurring seizures. Repeated 4-AP-induced seizures increased the amplitude of evoked synaptic field responses in rat entorhinal cortical slices. While vulnerability to inhibition of AMPA receptors by the specific antagonist GYKI 52466 was slightly reduced, responsiveness to NMDA receptor antagonist APV remained unaffected. Testing of bivalent cation permeability of iGluRs revealed reduced Ca(2+)-influx through non-NMDA receptors. According to the semi-quantitative histoblot analysis GluA1-4, GluA1, GluA2, GluK5, GluN1 and GluN2A subunit protein expression differently altered. While there was a marked decrease in the level of GluA1-4, GluA2 and GluK5 receptor subunits, GluA1 and GluN2A protein levels moderately increased. The results indicate that brief convulsions, repeated daily for 10 days can increase overall entorhinal cortex excitability despite a reduction in AMPA/kainate receptor activity, probably through the alteration of local network susceptibility.",

    "47": "Sepsis-associated delirium (SAD) is a clinical manifestation of the involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) during sepsis. The purpose of this review is to provide a concise overview of SAD including the epidemiology and current diagnostic criteria for SAD. We present in detail the pathophysiology with regards to blood-brain-barrier breakdown, cytokine activation and neurotransmitter deregulation. Treatment and prognosis for SAD are also briefly discussed. SAD is the most common form of delirium acquired in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit), and is described in about 50% of septic patients. Clinical features include altered level of consciousness, reduced attention, change in cognition and perceptual disturbances. Symptoms can reversible, but prolonged deficits can be observed in older patients. Pathophysiology of SAD is poorly understood, but involves microvascular, metabolic and, not least, inflammatory mechanisms leading to CNS dysfunction. These mechanisms can be different in SAD compared to ICU delirium associated with other conditions. SAD is diagnosed clinically using validated tools such as CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Medicine) or ICDSC (The Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist), which have good specificity but low sensitivity. Neuroimaging studies and EEG (Electroencephalography) can be useful complement to clinical evaluation to define the severity of the condition. Prompt diagnosis and eradication of septic foci whenever possible is vital. Preventive measures for SAD in the critically ill patient requiring long-term sedation include maintaining light levels of sedation using non-benzodiazepine sedatives (either propofol or dexmedetomidine). Early mobilization of patients in the ICU is also recommended. Antipsychotic drugs (haloperidol and atypical antipsychotics) are widely used to treat SAD, but firm evidence of their efficacy is lacking.", 
    "48": "GABAergic inhibition displays rich functional diversity throughout the CNS, which arises from variations in the nature of inputs, subunit composition, subcellular localization of receptors and synapse geometry, or reuptake mechanisms. In the spinal dorsal horn (SDH), GABAA and glycine receptors play a major role in the control of excitability and accuracy of nociceptive processing. Identifying which components shape the properties of the inhibitory synapses in different cell types is necessary to understand how nociceptive information is integrated. To address this, we used transgenic mice where inhibitory interneurons express GAD65-EGFP. We found that GABAA, but not glycine receptor-mediated evoked IPSCs displayed slower kinetics in EGFP+ vs. EGFP- interneurons. GABAA miniature IPSC decay kinetics showed a large variability in both populations, however the distribution of decays differed between EGFP+ and EGFP- interneurons. The range of mIPSC decay kinetics observed was replicated in experiments using rapid application of GABA on outside-out patches taken from SDH neurons in slices. Furthermore, GABAA decay kinetics were not affected by uptake blockers and were not different in mice lacking \u03b4 or \u03b15 subunits, indicating that intrinsic channel properties likely underlie the heterogeneity. To identify whether other \u03b1 subunits shape the various kinetic properties observed we took advantage of knock-in mice carrying point mutations in either the \u03b11, \u03b12, or \u03b13 subunits rendering Ro 15-4513 a selective agonist at the benzodiazepine modulatory site. We found that \u03b11 and \u03b12 subunit underlie the fast decaying component of IPSCs while the slow component is determined by the \u03b13 subunit. The differential distribution of GABAA subunits at inhibitory synapses thus sculpts the heterogeneity of the SDH inhibitory circuitry. This diversity of inhibitory elements can be harnessed to selectively modulate different components of the spinal nociceptive circuitry for therapeutic interventions.",

    "54": "A description of pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD) biosynthesis is a prerequisite for engineering production of analogs with enhanced antitumor activity. Predicted dioxygenases Orf12 and SibV associated with dihydropyrrole biosynthesis in PBDs anthramycin and sibiromycin, respectively, were expressed and purified for activity studies. UV-visible spectroscopy revealed that these enzymes catalyze the regiospecific 2,3-extradiol dioxygenation of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) to form l-2,3-secodopa (\u03bbmax=368 nm). (1)H NMR spectroscopy indicates that l-2,3-secodopa cyclizes into the \u03b1-keto acid tautomer of l-4-(2-oxo-3-butenoic-acid)-4,5-dihydropyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (\u03bbmax=414 nm). Thus, the dioxygenases are key for establishing the scaffold of the dihydropyrrole moiety. Kinetic studies suggest the dioxygenase product is relatively labile and is likely consumed rapidly by subsequent biosynthetic steps. The enzymatic product and dimeric state of these dioxygenases are conserved in dioxygenases involved in dihydropyrrole and pyrrolidine biosynthesis within both PBD and non-PBD pathways.", 
    "55": "Agonists of benzodiazepine (BZD) binding site in GABA receptors are widely used in clinical practice. In spite of their benefits they have several side effects, so synthesis of new agonists of these receptors to get more specific effect and better profile of adverse drug reactions is still continued. Novel BZD agonists were designed based on the pharmacophore/receptor model of BZD binding site of GABAA receptor. Energy minima conformers of the designed compounds and estazolam, a known BZD receptor agonist, were well superimposed in conformational analysis. Docking studies revealed that the carbonyl group of the compound 4c, 3-(2-chlorobenzyl)-5-methyl-2-phenyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7(3H)-one, was near the nitrogen moiety of triazole ring of estazolam providing the hydrogen bond acceptor in proper direction in the BDZ-binding site of GABAA receptor model (\u03b11\u03b22\u03d22). The designed compounds were synthesized and their in vitro affinity for the central BZD receptor was determined. Most of the novel compounds had better affinity for the BZD site of action on GABAA receptor complex than diazepam. Finally, the novel compound 4c with the best affinity in radioligand receptor binding assay (Ki=0.42 nM and IC50=0.68 nM) was selected as candidate for in vivo evaluation. This compound showed significant hypnotic activity and weak anticonvulsant effect with no impairment on learning and memory performance in mouse. The pharmacological effects of the compound 4c were antagonized by flumazenil, a BZD antagonist, which confirms the involvement of BZD receptors in the biological effects of the novel ligand.",

Then, the effects of 2.5% VEO, the anxiolytic dose, on c-fos expression in amygdala were investigated. The rats given either 2.5% VEO or diazepam exhibited an anxiolytic-like profile in the EPM. VEO and diazepam significantly increased c-fos expression in the lateral division of the central amygdaloid nucleus (CeL). Therefore, the anxiolytic properties of VEO might be associated with altering neuronal activation in CeL. However, future studies are needed to investigate the precise mechanism of action of VEO.",

Such patients are characterized by residual depressive symptoms such as anhedonia, psychic anxiety, sleep disturbance, and cognitive dysfunction. Despite having a tremendous impact on outcomes such as future relapse, morbidity, and mortality, the neural mechanisms of partially remitted depression remain unclear. Using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) approach, we investigated the intrinsic neural oscillation alterations during resting state in partially remitted depression. A total of 23 partially remitted depression patients and 68 healthy controls underwent magnetic resonance imaging for functional imaging. We compared ALFF differences between groups as well as correlations between clinical measurements and ALFF in the brain regions showing significant group differences. Compared with healthy controls, partially remitted depression patients showed increased ALFF in the left ventral anterior insula, bilateral posterior insula, and bilateral supramarginal gyrus, and decreased ALFF in the left calcarine gyrus. A trend positive correlation between the number of depressive episodes and ALFF values was found in the right posterior insula in the partially remitted depression group. In addition, the ALFF in the right supramarginal gyrus were negatively correlated with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores. Consistent with the emerging theory of the role of the salience network in sensing the changes of homeostasis that contributes to partially remitted depression, the current findings suggest that the increased intrinsic neural oscillation of the insula is related to the refractoriness to treatment and may be an imaging marker for predicting future depression recurrence.",

    "104": "We investigated the role of autophagy, a controlled cellular self-digestion process, in regulating survival of neurons exposed to atypical antipsychotic olanzapine. Olanzapine induced autophagy in human SH-SY5Y neuronal cell line, as confirmed by the increase in autophagic flux and presence of autophagic vesicles, fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, and increase in the expression of autophagy-related (ATG) genes ATG4B, ATG5, and ATG7. The production of reactive oxygen species, but not modulation of the main autophagy repressor MTOR or its upstream regulators AMP-activated protein kinase and AKT1, was responsible for olanzapine-triggered autophagy. Olanzapine-mediated oxidative stress also induced mitochondrial depolarization and damage, and the autophagic clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria was confirmed by electron microscopy, colocalization of autophagosome-associated MAP1LC3B (LC3B henceforth) and mitochondria, and mitochondrial association with the autophagic cargo receptor SQSTM1/p62. While olanzapine-triggered mitochondrial damage was not overtly toxic to SH-SY5Y cells, their death was readily initiated upon the inhibition of autophagy with pharmacological inhibitors, RNA interference knockdown of BECN1 and LC3B, or biological free radical nitric oxide. The treatment of mice with olanzapine for 14 d increased the brain levels of autophagosome-associated LC3B-II and mRNA encoding Atg4b, Atg5, Atg7, Atg12, Gabarap, and Becn1. The administration of the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine significantly increased the expression of proapoptotic genes (Trp53, Bax, Bak1, Pmaip1, Bcl2l11, Cdkn1a, and Cdkn1b) and DNA fragmentation in the frontal brain region of olanzapine-exposed animals. These data indicate that olanzapine-triggered autophagy protects neurons from otherwise fatal mitochondrial damage, and that inhibition of autophagy might unmask the neurotoxic action of the drug.",

ISO produced a reproducible anaesthesia, thereby being suitable for repeated use, but with a decrease of HR and BP throughout the six anaesthesias. The use of ISO in cases where these parameters should be unaffected is therefore not advised. The inability to produce a surgical tolerance, the reduction of sleeping time and BW, as well as the tissue necrosis are significant contraindications for a repeated use of KX.

One study compared diazepam to thioridazine, 1 trial compared oxazepam to haloperidol and diphenhydramine, 1 trial compared alprazolam to lorazepam, 1 trial compared lorazepam to haloperidol, and 1 trial compared intramuscular (IM) lorazepam to IM olanzapine and placebo. The data indicates that in 4 of the 5 studies, there was no significant difference in efficacy between the active drugs to treat the symptoms of BPSD. One study indicated that thioridazine may have better efficacy than diazepam for treating symptoms of BPSD. In 1 study, the active drugs had greater efficacy in treating BPSD when compared to placebo. There was no significant difference between the active drugs in terms of tolerability. However, in 2 of the 5 studies, about a third of the patients were noted to have dropped out of the studies. Available data, although limited, do not support the routine use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of BPSD. But these drugs may be used in certain circumstances where other psychotropic medications are unsafe for use in individuals with BPSD or when there are significant medication allergies or tolerability issues with certain classes of psychotropic medications.",

The symptom severity was evaluated by the memorial delirium rating scale (MDAS) on days 0, 3, and 7 following intervention. Significant improvements in total MDAS scores were found in all groups on day 3. However, on day 7, only the short T1/2 group and MARTA group showed significant improvement. Consideration of an AP's pharmacological properties may be helpful for improving the outcomes of pharmacological delirium intervention in patients with cancer.", 
    "116": "In this study, the acid dissociation constants (pKa) of some benzodiazepine derivatives including chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, lorazepam, and oxazepam in aqueous micellar solution were determined spectrophotometrically at an ionic strength of 0.1M at 25\u00b0C. The effect of cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a cationic and sodium n-dodecyl sulfate(SDS) as an anionic surfactant on the absorption spectra of benzodiazepine drugs at different pH values were studied. The acidity constants of all related species are estimated by considering the surfactant concept and the application of chemometric methods using the whole spectral fitting of the collected data to an established factor analysis model. DATAN\u00ae software (Ver. 5.0, Multid Analyses AB, and Goteborg, Sweden) was applied to determine the acidity constants. In this study, a simple and fast method to determine the ionization constant (pKa) of poorly soluble drugs was developed using surfactants. The acidity constant (i.e. pKa) for chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, lorazepam, and oxazepam were reported as 4.62, pKa1 value of 1.52 and pKa2 value of 10.51, pKa1 value of 1.53 and pKa2 value of 10.92 and pKa1 value 1.63 and pKa2 value of 11.21 respectively. The results showed that the peak values in the spectrophotometric absorption spectra of drugs are influenced by the presence of anionic and cationic surfactants. According to the results, by changing the SDS concentration from 0 to 0.05M, the pKa of chlordiazepoxide was increased to 5.9, the pKa1 of lorazepam was decreased to 0.1 while the pKa2 was increased to 11.5. Increase in SDS concentration has not shown significant alteration in pKa of clonazepam and oxazepam. Results indicate that by Changing the CTAB concentration from 0 to 0.05M, the pKa of chlordiazepoxide was reduced to 4.4, the pKa1 of clonazepam was decreased to 0.1 and the pKa2 was decreased to 9.1, the pKa1 of lorazepam was decreased to 0.4 and the pKa2 was decreased to 9.4, the pKa1 of oxazepam was decreased to 0.3 and the pKa2 was decreased to 9.7. Based on the results obtained from the study, charge of anionic and cationic surfactants leads to an electrostatic interaction between surfactant and the protonated form of the drug molecule. The electrostatic interactions can be attractive or repulsive forces and influence of separation of protons and consequently increase or decrease the acidity constants.", 
    "117": "Pathological fear and anxiety are highly debilitating and, despite considerable advances in psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy they remain insufficiently treated in many patients with PTSD, phobias, panic and other anxiety disorders. Increasing preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that pharmacological treatments including cognitive enhancers, when given as adjuncts to psychotherapeutic approaches [cognitive behavioral therapy including extinction-based exposure therapy] enhance treatment efficacy, while using anxiolytics such as benzodiazepines as adjuncts can undermine long-term treatment success. The purpose of this review is to outline the literature showing how pharmacological interventions targeting neurotransmitter systems including serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, histamine, glutamate, GABA, cannabinoids, neuropeptides (oxytocin, neuropeptides Y and S, opioids) and other targets (neurotrophins BDNF and FGF2, glucocorticoids, L-type-calcium channels, epigenetic modifications) as well as their downstream signaling pathways, can augment fear extinction and strengthen extinction memory persistently in preclinical models. Particularly promising approaches are discussed in regard to their effects on specific aspects of fear extinction namely, acquisition, consolidation and retrieval, including long-term protection from return of fear (relapse) phenomena like spontaneous recovery, reinstatement and renewal of fear. We also highlight the promising translational value of the preclinial research and the clinical potential of targeting certain neurochemical systems with, for example d-cycloserine, yohimbine, cortisol, and L-DOPA. The current body of research reveals important new insights into the neurobiology and neurochemistry of fear extinction and holds significant promise for pharmacologically-augmented psychotherapy as an improved approach to treat trauma and anxiety-related disorders in a more efficient and persistent way promoting enhanced symptom remission and recovery.", 
    "118": "The pilocarpine rat model, in which status epilepticus (SE) leads to epilepsy with spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS), is widely used to study the mechanisms of epileptogenesis and develop strategies for epilepsy prevention. SE is commonly interrupted after 30-90min by high-dose diazepam or other anticonvulsants to reduce mortality. It is widely believed that SE duration of 30-60min is sufficient to induce hippocampal damage and epilepsy. However, resistance to diazepam develops during SE, so that an SE that is longer than 30min is difficult to terminate, and SE typically recurs several hours after diazepam, thus forming a bias for studies on epileptogenesis or antiepileptogenesis. We developed a drug cocktail, consisting of diazepam, phenobarbital, and scopolamine that allows complete and persistent SE termination in the lithium-pilocarpine model. A number of novel findings were obtained with this cocktail. (a) In contrast to previous reports with incomplete SE suppression, a SE of 60min duration did not induce epilepsy, whereas epilepsy with SRS developed after 90 or 120min SE; (b) by comparing groups of rats with 60 and 90min of SE, development of epilepsy could be predicted by behavioral hyperexcitability and decrease in seizure threshold, indicating that these read-outs are suited as biomarkers of epileptogenesis; (c) CA1 damage was prevented by the cocktail, but rats exhibited cell loss in the dentate hilus, which was related to development of epilepsy. These data demonstrate that the duration of SE needed for induction of epileptogenesis in this model is longer than previously thought.", 
    "119": "The fragment spectra of protonated nitro-substituted benzodiazepines show an unusual fragment [M\u2009+\u2009H\u2009-\u200914](+) , which is shown by accurate mass measurement to be due to the loss of a nitrogen atom. Our investigations show that this apparent loss of atomic nitrogen is rather an attachment of molecular oxygen to the [M\u2009+\u2009H\u2009-\u2009NO2 ](+\u2022) ion, which is the main fragment ion in these spectra. The oxygen attachment is exothermic, and rate constants have been derived. MS(n) spectra show that it is not easily reversible upon fragmentation of the adduct ion and that it is also observed with some secondary and tertiary fragments, which allows to limit the attachment site to the aromatic ring annulated to the diazepine moiety. Fragments of the oxygen adduct ion indicate that the O2 molecule dissociates in the adduct formation process, and the two oxygen atoms are bound to different sites of the ion. Comparison with radical cations generated by fragmentation of non-nitro-substituted benzodiazepines, none of which showed an oxygen attachment, and the fragmentation mechanisms involved in their formation indicates that the [M\u2009+\u2009H\u2009-\u2009NO2 ](+\u2022) ion is a distonic ion with the charge and radical site neighbored on the aromatic ring. From these results, we derive a proposal for the formation and structure of the [M\u2009+\u2009H\u2009-\u2009NO2 \u2009+\u2009O2 ](+\u2022) ion, which explains the experimental observations.

    "120": "Objective We assessed the availability of essential medicines for mental healthcare (MH) across levels of the public healthcare system to aid in future systems planning. Design Non-expired MH medications were assessed in 24 public health facilities and 13 district warehouses across Sofala Province, Mozambique, from July to August 2014. Medication categories included: antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, antiepileptics and mood stabilizers, and anticholinergics and antihistamines. Results Only 7 of 12 (58.3%) district warehouses, 11 of 24 (45.8%) of all health facilities, and 10 of 12 (83.3%) of facilities with trained MH staff had availability of at least one medication of each category. Thioridazine was the most commonly available antipsychotic across all facilities (9 of 24, 37.5%), while chlorpromazine and thioridazine were most common at facilities providing MH care (8 of 12, 66.7%). The atypical antipsychotic risperidone was not available at any facility or district warehouse. Amitriptyline was the most commonly available antidepressant (10 of 12 districts; 12 of 24 overall facilities; 9 or 12 MH facilities). Despite being on the national essential drug list, fluoxetine was only available at one quaternary-level facility and no district warehouses. Conclusions Essential psychotropic medicines are routinely unavailable at public health facilities. Current essential drug lists include six typical but no atypical antipsychotics, which is concerning given the side-effect profiles of typical antipsychotics. Ensuring consistent availability of at least one selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor should also be a priority, as they are essential for the treatment of individuals with underlying cardiovascular disease and/or suicidal ideation. Similar to successful task-sharing approaches used for HIV/AIDS, mid-level providers could be retrained and certified to prescribe and monitor first-line psychotropic regimens.",

As users are often young and without previous psychiatric history it is often difficult to discern if symptoms are substance induced or related to an organic disorder. Our patient was a 38-year-old woman with no history of psychosis who presented to the emergency room following two failed suicide attempts via overdose and self-mutilation. On initial examination, the patient was somnolent yet arousable and oriented. She endorsed auditory and visual hallucinations as well as paranoid delusions regarding being spied on by her son. Upon further questioning, patient admitted to use of bath salts one day prior to admission and urine toxicology was positive for phenycyclidine. She was admitted for stabilization but despite improvement in her hallucinations, her paranoia persisted. She was visited by her husband who also expressed similar paranoid delusions, raising the question as to whether her symptoms were truly substance induced or if the patient was experiencing a shared psychotic disorder with her spouse. Prior to discharge, her hallucinations and paranoia had improved with abstinence from bath salts and the initiation of olanzapine. She was able to gain some insight, recognizing the delusions were false yet her husband still continued to believe they were true. As such, we concluded that the couple's psychotic symptoms were more likely related to shared bath salts rather than shared delusions.", 
    "131": "Exposure to high altitude imposes significant strain on cardiopulmonary system and the brain. As a consequence, sojourners to high altitude frequently experience sleep disturbances, often reporting restless and sleepless nights. At altitudes above 3,000 meters (9,800 ft) almost all healthy subjects develop periodic breathing especially during NREM sleep. Sleep architecture gradually improves with increased NREM and REM sleep despite persistence of periodic breathing. The primary reason for periodic breathing at high altitude is a hypoxic-induced increase in chemoreceptor sensitivity to changes in PaCO2 - both above and below eupnea, leading to periods of apnea and hyperpnea. Acetazolamide improves sleep by reducing the periodic breathing through development of metabolic acidosis and induced hyperventilation decreasing the plant gain and widening the PCO2 reserve. This widening of the PCO2 reserve impedes development of central apneas during sleep. Benzodiazepines and GABA receptor antagonist such as zolpidem improve sleep without affecting breathing pattern or cognitive functions.",

Blood sampling to measure the AP plasma level was performed twice (at 7-10 and 26-30 day from start of treatment), the levels of prolactin and glucose were determined once (at 26-30 day from start of treatment). Patients were assessed by psychometric scales PANSS and NSA and the side-effects scale UKU.", 
    "138": "The increased concentration of AP was noted in 33% of the patients. The high concentration of AP was significantly associated with akathisia and hyperkinesia (by UKU scale), NSA retardation factor and hyperprolactinemia. Patients with severe hyperprolactinemia were twice as likely to have a clinically significant depression. Increased blood glucose levels were observed in 18% of the patients, there was no significant association with AP plasma levels. Mental SE were most prominent, with a drift towards the neurological SE in the group with higher AP plasma levels. Chlorpromazine equivalent didn't significantly differ in the groups with normal, high and low AP concentrations.", 
    "139": "Elevated AP plasma levels, which were associated with some clinically significant SE and some negative symptoms, were found in most patients. In this regard, therapeutic drug monitoring is a promising method for the individualization of schizophrenia exacerbation treatment in routine clinical practice.",

In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of a fully computational system that leverages low-quality electrocardiography (ECG) from a single lead to detect the presence of benzodiazepine sedatives in a subject's system. Starting with features commonly examined manually by cardiologists searching for evidence of poisonings, we generalized the extraction of these features to a fully automated process. We tested the predictive power of these features using nine subjects from an intensive care clinical database. Features were found to be significantly indicative of a binary relationship between dose and ECG morphology, but we were unable to find evidence of a predictable continuous relationship. Fitting this binary relationship to a classifier, we achieved a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 95%.",

Drug therapies prescribed by GPs cost 641,26 \u20ac per patient and prescribed by medical specialists 559,12 \u20ac per patient in 2008. Quantitative polypharmacy was prescribed to 17, 91% of patients (19, 99% to women and 14, 83% to men) by GPs. Medical specialists prescribed polypharmacy to 8,65% of patients (7,98% to women and 9,59% to men) by GPs. Among the 20 most prescribed drugs, inappropriate medicines for seniors were observed in the group of GPs as well as in the group of medical specialists. Family doctors prescribed inappropriate drugs to 13, 69% of patients and medical specialists to 5,46% of patients. In both groups lorazepam, zolpidem and lormetazepam have been identified as inappropriate active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).",

    "147": "Clonazepam, diazepam, and alprazolam are benzodiazepines with sedative, anticonvulsant, and anxiolytic effects, but their prevalence in drug abuse and drug overdoses has long been recognized. When detection times for psychoactive drugs in oral fluid are reported, they are most often based on therapeutic doses administered in clinical studies. Repeated ingestions of high doses, as seen after drug abuse, are however likely to cause positive samples for extended time periods. Findings of drugs of abuse in oral fluid collected from imprisoned persons might lead to negative sanctions, and the knowledge of detection times of these drugs is thus important to ensure correct interpretation. The aim of this study was to investigate the time window of detection for diazepam, clonazepam, and alprazolam in oral fluid from drug addicts admitted to detoxification.",

    "151": "Natural compounds are becoming popular for the treatment of illnesses and health promotion, but the mechanisms of action and safety profiles are often unknown. Xyloketal B (XKB) is a novel marine compound isolated from the mangrove fungus Xylaria sp., with potent antioxidative, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective effects. However, its molecular targets and effects on drug-metabolizing enzymes are unknown. This study aimed to investigate the potential molecular targets of XKB using bioinformatic approaches and to examine the effect of XKB on the expression and activity of rat cytochrome P450 3a (Cyp3a) subfamily members using midazolam as a model probe. DDI-CPI, a server that can predict drug-drug interactions via the chemical-protein interactome, was employed to predict the targets of XKB, and the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) was used to analyze the pathways of the predicted targets of XKB. Homology modeling was performed using the Discovery Studio program 3.1. The activity and expression of rat hepatic Cyp3a were examined after the rats were treated with XKB at 7 and 14 mg/kg for 8 consecutive days. Rat plasma concentrations of midazolam and its metabolite 1'-OH-midazolam were determined using a validated high-performance liquid chromatographic method. Bioinformatic analysis showed that there were over 324 functional proteins and 61 related signaling pathways that were potentially regulated by XKB. A molecular docking study showed that XKB bound to the active site of human cytochrome P450 3A4 and rat Cyp3a2 homology model via the formation of hydrogen bonds. The in vivo study showed that oral administration of XKB at 14 mg/kg to rats for 8 days significantly increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of midazolam, with a concomitant decrease in the plasma clearance and AUC ratio of 1'-OH-midazolam over midazolam. Further, oral administration of 14 mg/kg XKB for 8 days markedly reduced the activity and expression of hepatic Cyp3a in rats. Taken together, the results show that XKB could regulate networks of molecular proteins and related signaling pathways and that XKB downregulated hepatic Cyp3a in rats. XKB might cause drug interactions through modulation of the activity and expression of Cyp3a members. More studies are warranted to confirm the mechanisms of action of XKB and to investigate the underlying mechanism for the regulating effect of XKB on Cyp3a subfamily members.",

In the present study, we characterized the acute antinociceptive properties of EFX during spinal pain processing in naive and monoarthritic rats using in vivo electrophysiology. The topical application of EFX on lumbar spinal cord segment, at concentrations higher than 30 \u03bcM, reduced the excitability of wide dynamic range neurons receiving non-nociceptive and nociceptive inputs. Windup discharge resulting from the repetitive stimulation of the peripheral receptive field, and recognized as a short-term plastic process seen in central nociceptive sensitization, was significantly inhibited by EFX at these concentrations. In good agreement, mechanical nociceptive thresholds were also significantly increased following an acute intrathecal injection of EFX. The acute modulatory properties of EFX on spinal pain processing were never seen in the simultaneous presence of bicuculline.

In a preliminary immunohistochemical study conducted on 99 consecutive DLBCL patients, we found that about half of DLBCLs showed constitutive expression of the phosphorylated forms of checkpoint kinases (CHK) and CDC25c, markers of DDR activation, and of phosphorylated histone H2AX (\u03b3H2AX), marker of DNA damage and genomic instability. Constitutive \u03b3H2AX expression correlated with c-MYC levels and DDR activation, and defined a subset of tumors characterised by poor outcome. Next, we used the CHK inhibitor PF-0477736 as a tool to investigate whether the inhibition of the DDR pathway might represent a novel therapeutic approach in DLBCL. Submicromolar concentrations of PF-0477736 hindered proliferation in DLBCL cell lines with activated DDR pathway. These results were fully recapitulated with a different CHK inhibitor (AZD-7762). Inhibition of checkpoint kinases induced rapid DNA damage accumulation and apoptosis in DLBCL cell lines and primary cells.

Using a phenotypic screen, we recently identified benzodiazepinone derivatives that reduce ER stress-mediated apoptosis in a rat neuronal progenitor cell line (CSM14.1). Herein we describe how structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies around these screening hits led to compounds that display robust cytoprotective activity against thapsigargin-induced ER stress in SH-SY5Y and H4 human neuronal cell lines. We demonstrate that the most potent of these derivatives, compound 4hh, inhibits the activation of p38 MAP kinase (p38) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), protein kinases that are downstream signal effectors of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Compound 4hh specifically protects against thapsigargin-induced cell death and displays no protection against other insults known to induce cellular stress or activate p38. However, compound 4hh provides moderate inhibition of p38 activity stimulated by compounds that disrupt calcium homeostasis. Our data indicate that probe compound 4hh is a valuable small molecule tool that can be used to investigate the effects of ER stress on human neurons. This approach may provide the basis for the future development of therapeutics for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "205": "Many patients with Lewy body dementia develop visual hallucinations and other psychiatric symptoms. These patients are hypersensitive to antipsychotic drugs. Although patients tolerate atypical better than typical antipsychotics, both types can cause major extrapyramidal side effects. The anticonvulsant mood stabilizer topiramate, which does not cause parkinsonism, has been used as adjuvant therapy for both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia; these symptoms can resemble those of Lewy body dementia. This report documents a 65-year-old woman with a 3-year history of progressive dementia that over the past 2 years had become complicated by severe extrapyramidal symptoms and agitated hallucinations. Her hallucinations became daily and were disrupting to her family. She was given a clinical diagnosis of Lewy body dementia after imaging and laboratory studies ruled out other etiologies. Treatment with olanzapine relieved her psychotic symptoms but caused severe dystonias, daily myoclonic jerks, and tremors. Stopping the olanzapine and starting topiramate 25 mg daily eliminated the hallucinations and agitation without worsening her extrapyramidal side effects. However, the topiramate was stopped because the patient reportedly developed anorexia and significant weight loss. Her hallucinations returned. When topiramate was reinstated at 12.5 mg a day, her agitation resolved, although her hallucinations continued. After 6 months on this dose, her agitation was still fairly well controlled without serious side effects or worsening of her parkinsonian symptoms.", 
    "206": "Paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines including restlessness, anxiety and sometimes violent behavior sometimes occur. Most of the known predicting factors of disinhibitory reactions such as age, gender, genetic or the psychological background are not modifiable. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of rate of midazolam administration, as a controllable factor, on the occurrence of paradoxical reaction to midazolam (PRM) in pediatric patients.", 
    "207": "In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial 98 American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I, II, aged from 6 months to 6 years, and undergoing elective surgery, were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly allocated to receive midazolam 0.1 mg/kg as a 0.1% solution at an injection rate of 0.2 ml/s or 1 ml/s. The occurrence of PRM was compared between the two groups with Chi-square test.", 
    "208": "The occurrence of PRM in the rapid injection group was significantly higher than the slow injection group (20.4% vs. 4.1%, P < 0.05, relative risk CI: 95% 6.03 (1.24-29.4)).", 
    "209": "Slow intravenous administration of midazolam significantly reduces the occurrence of paradoxical reactions and should be respected in premedication of pediatric patients.", 
    "210": "Catatonia is a severe motor syndrome with an estimated prevalence among psychiatric inpatients of about 10%. At times, it is life-threatening especially in its malignant form when complicated by fever and autonomic disturbances. Catatonia can accompany many different psychiatric illnesses and somatic diseases. In order to recognize the catatonic syndrome, apart from thorough and repeated observation, a clinical examination is needed. A screening instrument, such as the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale, can guide the clinician through the neuropsychiatric examination. Although severe and life-threatening, catatonia has a good prognosis. Research on the treatment of catatonia is scarce, but there is overwhelming clinical evidence of the efficacy of benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, and electroconvulsive therapy.", 
    "211": "Etizolam is a thienodiazepine anxiolytic which is said to have lower dependence potential than other benzodiazepines. We report a case of etizolam dependence in a young male with social anxiety disorder and moderate depression. This case report highlights the fact that the same caution be exercised while prescribing etizolam with respect to its potential to cause dependence as with any other benzodiazepine.",

    "217": "Three hundred sixty-one of 696 (51.9%) eligible residents had one or more DDIs. None involved residents with a history of PUD, one involved a resident with CKD, and four occurred in residents with HF. Of 540 residents with dementia or cognitive impairment, 50.7% took a drug that could exacerbate these conditions; the most commonly involved medications were antipsychotics (35.4%) and benzodiazepines (14.4%). Of 267 with a history of falls or hip fracture, 67.8% received an interacting medication, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (33.1%), antipsychotics (30.7%), and anticonvulsants (25.1%) being most commonly involved. Using separate multivariable logistic regression models, factors associated with DDIs in dementia or cognitive impairment and falls or fractures included age 85 and older (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.24-0.60 and aOR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.24-0.96, respectively), taking five to eight medications (aOR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.02-4.16 and aOR = 4.76, 95% CI = 1.68-13.5, respectively), taking nine or more medications (aOR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.03-3.85 and aOR = 3.68, 95% CI = 1.41-9.61, respectively), and being a long-stay resident (aOR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.04-3.12 and aOR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.12-4.91, respectively).",

We performed a systematic literature search in accordance with PRISMA guidelines identifying studies containing original data on first-trimester exposure and pregnancy outcome with respect to congenital malformations. Cumulated data for olanzapine were 1090 first-trimester-exposed pregnancies with 38 malformations resulting in a malformation rate of 3.5%. The corresponding numbers for quetiapine, risperidone and aripiprazole were 443/16 (3.6%), 432/22 (5.1%) and 100/5 (5.0%), respectively. Relative risk estimates and 95% confidence intervals were 1.0 (0.7-1.4) (olanzapine), 1.0 (0.6-1.7) (quetiapine), 1.5 (0.9-2.2) (risperidone) and 1.4 (0.5-3.1) (aripiprazole). First-trimester exposure to olanzapine is not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation. Data for quetiapine and risperidone do not suggest a substantially increased risk, while the risk estimate for aripiprazole remains imprecise owing to a low amount of data.", 
    "220": "The androgen receptor (AR) is central to the initiation and progression of prostate cancer, even after castration. There has been some success in therapies targeting AR signaling which have been shown to extend survival in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, durable responses to these therapies have been limited and there is a need to identify additional therapeutic targets within the AR-signaling network. Recently a group at University of Michigan Medical School outlined the potential for BET bromodomain protein inhibitors as a novel epigenetic approach to treatment of CRPC. In prostate cancer cell lines, BET bromodomain inhibitor, JQ1, was shown to induce apoptosis and down-regulate AR-regulated gene transcription. Bromodomain and the extra-terminal (BET) subfamily of human bromodomain proteins, with a focus on BRD4, were shown to play a major role in AR signaling and interact with AR via bromodomain (BD) 1/2. JQ1 inhibits this BRD4-AR bond, resulting in removal of RNA polymerase II from AR target genes, causing reduced AR gene transcription and subsequent diminished AR signaling. JQ1 lead to a significant reduction in tumor volume and weight in VCaP xenograft mice.", 
    "221": "Hypnotics are widely used to treat insomnia but adverse effects of different hypnotics, especially benzodiazepine receptor agonists, are getting more attention lately. The effects of novel hypnotics have not been fully examined.",

    "223": "In this double-blinded, three-way crossover trial, 17 healthy males received acute doses of 8\u00a0mg ramelteon, 0.125\u00a0mg triazolam, and placebo. The subjects were administered three driving tasks-road-tracking, car-following, and harsh-braking-using a driving simulator and three cognitive tasks-Continuous Performance Test, N-back Test, and Trail-Making Test-at baseline and at 1 and 4\u00a0h post-dosing. The Stanford Sleepiness Scale scores and computerized posturography were also assessed.", 
    "224": "In the driving simulations, ramelteon and triazolam increased the number of subjects who slid off the road. Triazolam increased the standard deviation of lateral position compared to ramelteon and placebo at 1\u00a0h post-dosing. Ramelteon and triazolam significantly increased the time to complete of Trail-Making Test part A and the environmental area in posturography compared to placebo at 1 and 4\u00a0h post-dosing. Ramelteon and triazolam significantly increased subjective sleepiness compared to placebo at 1\u00a0h post-dosing.", 
    "225": "Ramelteon may affect road-tracking performance, visual attention and/or psychomotor speed measured by Trail-Making Test part A, and body balance in acute dosing. Lower dose of triazolam also impaired performance worse than ramelteon. Physicians should consider risks and benefits when prescribing both drugs, especially in the initial period of administration.", 
    "226": "Bipolar depression is more pervasive than mania, but has fewer evidence-based treatments.", 
    "227": "Using data from multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses, we assessed the number needed to treat (NNT) for response and the number needed to harm (NNH) for selected side effects for older and newer acute bipolar depression treatments.", 
    "228": "The 2 older FDA-approved treatments for bipolar depression, olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC) and quetiapine (QTP) monotherapy, were efficacious (response NNT=4 for OFC, NNT=6 for QTP), but similarly likely to yield harms (OFC weight gain NNH=6; QTP sedation/somnolence NNH=5). Commonly used unapproved agents (lamotrigine monotherapy and adjunctive antidepressants) tended to be well-tolerated (with double-digit NNHs), although this advantage was at the cost of inadequate efficacy (response NNT=12 for lamotrigine, NNT=29 for antidepressants). In contrast, the newly approved agent lurasidone was not only efficacious (response NNT=5 for monotherapy, NNT=7 as adjunctive therapy), but also had enhanced tolerability (NNH=15 for akathisia [monotherapy], NNH=16 for nausea [adjunctive]). Although adjunctive armodafinil appeared well tolerated, its efficacy in bipolar depression has not been consistently demonstrated in randomized controlled trials.", 
    "229": "NNT and NNH are categorical metrics; only selected NNHs were assessed; limited generalizability of efficacy (versus effectiveness) studies.", 
    "230": "For acute bipolar depression, older approved treatments may have utility in high-urgency situations, whereas lamotrigine and antidepressants may have utility in low-urgency situations. Newly approved lurasidone may ultimately prove useful in diverse situations. New drug development needs to focus on not only efficacy but also on tolerability.", 
    "231": "Depression is the predominant pole of illness disability in bipolar disorder and, compared with acute mania, has less systematic research guiding treatment development. The aim of this review is to present the therapeutic options currently available for managing bipolar depression and to highlight areas of unmet need and future research.", 
    "232": "Literature search of PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases and bibliographies from 2000 to August 2013 for treatments that have regulatory approval for bipolar depression or early controlled preliminary data on efficacy.", 
    "233": "Treatment options for bipolar depression have increased over the last decade, most notably with regulatory approval for olanzapine/fluoxetine combination, quetiapine, and lurasidone. Conventional mood stabilizers lamotrigine and divalproex have meta-analyses suggesting acute antidepressant response. Manual-based psychotherapies also appear to be effective in treating bipolar depression. The therapeutic utility of unimodal antidepressants, as a class, for the treatment of patients with bipolar depression, as a group, remains to be confirmed. There is a substantially unmet need to develop new interventions that are efficacious, effective, and have low side effect burden.", 
    "234": "Additional compounds are currently being developed that may ultimately be applicable to the treatment of bipolar depression and early open-trial data encourage further studies, but both of these topics are beyond the scope of this review.",

    "236": "This study aims to explore and analyze the condition of concurrent diseases and medicine use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and western medicine among the patients with insomnia. One thousand and sxity seven cases of data from 20 national hospitals' hospital information system (HIS) databases were collected. The frequent concurrent diseases included hypertension (26.9%), brain blood supply insufficiency (24.93%), cerebral infarction (19.49%), blood lipoprotein disturbance (15.28%), coronary heart disease (14.15%), headache (10.68%), chronic gastritis (8.81%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (7.87%), depressive disorder (7.4%) and anxiety disorder (6.65%). The 10 most frequently-used western drugs included alprazolam (35.99%), aspirin (25.4%), olanzapine (24.18%), cinepazide (23.06%), flupentixol & melitracen (18.74%), zolpidem (18.37%), oxiracetam (15.65%), estazolam (15%), aniracetam (13.4%) and piracetam (13.31%). The 10 most frequently-used TCM included Shuxuening injection (16.4%), Shuxuetong injection (15.18%), extract of ginkgo biloba leaf (14.71%), gastrodin (12.46%), Dengzanxixin injection (11.34%), Xueshuantong (8.53%), Danhong injection (6.37%), compound liquorice tablet (5.81%), Sanqi Tongshu capsule (5.72%) and sowthistle-leaf ixeridium injection (5.34%). Among all combined uses, the most frequent western drug use was alprazolam and olanzapine, while combined use of hypnotic drug and Huoxuehuayu formula is the most frequent. This study concludes that the concurrent diseases mainly include cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, metabolic disorders and anxiety-depression disorders, with increasing tendency of diseases types by ages, especially for cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. The most frequently-used hypnotic is alprazolam in the insomnia patients, and it is worth being concerned about the off-label use of olanzapine as an antipsychotic for the treatment of insomnia However, due to the fact that all cases data are from the inpatients, these findings have some limitations."
