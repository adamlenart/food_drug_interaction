Extrapolating to the population of more than 2.4 million older veterans receiving care during the study period, 8,000 hospitalizations may have been unnecessary. The most common ADRs that occurred were bradycardia (n\u00a0=\u00a06; beta-blockers, digoxin), hypoglycemia (n\u00a0=\u00a06; sulfonylureas, insulin), falls (n\u00a0=\u00a06; antidepressants, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), and mental status changes (n\u00a0=\u00a06; anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines).

    "7": "OFA hr/hr (OFA) rats present a major lactation deficit that impairs offspring survival. To explore whether abnormal stress responsiveness causes this deficit, we compared their hormonal (prolactin, progesterone, and corticosterone) responses to stress (room change and 2-min ether exposure) with those of Wistar and Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. We tested responses during the estrous cycle, pregnancy, lactation, after ovariectomy, and ovarian steroid hormone priming, and responses to suckling. We evaluated hypothalamic expression of receptors for prolactin (PRLRlong) and the isoforms of receptors for progesterone (PRA and B) and estrogen (ER\u03b1 and \u03b2) in late pregnancy. We tested whether administration of an anxiolytic (diazepam) improved lactation. Ether exposure increased circulating levels of the three hormones in the three strains of rats, cycling and ovariectomized, but was less effective in pregnancy and lactation. Elevated estrogen level (estrus and estradiol-treated ovariectomized rats) potentiated the prolactin response more in SD and OFA rats than in Wistar rats. Elevated progesterone level (late pregnancy, lactation, progesterone-treated ovariectomized rats) inhibited the prolactin response less in OFA than in SD or Wistar rats. Ether exposure inhibited the prolactin and oxytocin responses to suckling only in OFA rats. Diazepam treatment increased pup survival rate and the prolactin response to suckling. Hypothalamic total PR mRNA content, assayed by RT-PCR, was higher in pregnant OFA rats compared with SD and Wistar rats, but the PRB/PRA protein ratio determined by Western blot was lowest in Wistar rats, intermediate in OFA rats, and highest in SD rats. The heightened sensitivity to stress of lactating OFA rats may contribute to their lactational deficit and be caused by a combination of hypoprolactinemia and reduced inhibitory capacity of progesterone.", 
    "8": "Ethanol that affects hydration of skin and used in wound treatment formulations was studied here for its effect on permeation of drugs through burn eschar and to investigate the presence of a porous pathway in this barrier. In this study, permeations of clindamycin phosphate (CP, hydrophilic) and diazepam (lipophilic) through human burn eschar were investigated in the presence and absence of ethanol. Permeability coefficients (K(p) ) of CP and diazepam through hydrated eschar were calculated to be 13\u00b71 \u00d7 10(-3) and 17\u00b74 \u00d7 10(-3) cm/h respectively. These K(p) values were decreased by about 1\u00b75-5\u00b73 and 2-10\u00b77 times respectively upon the addition of 20-70% ethanol. Increased amount of ethanol decreased permeation flux of CP (2-20 times) and increased that of diazepam (3-80 times) from saturated solutions. Thermal analysis showed that ethanol dehydrates eschar and also changes its internal proteineous structure. Such changes were concluded to be the main reasons behind decreased K(p) of both drugs. Comparison of K(p) data suggests the possibility and importance of a pore pathway in permeation of both drugs through the hydrated burn eschar. Present results show that ethanol, and possibly other dehydrating agents, can decrease the permeability of eschar and that this effect should be considered in formulation developments.",

    "13": "Clobazam was initially developed in the early 1970s as a nonsedative anxiolytic agent, and is currently available as adjunctive therapy for epilepsy and anxiety disorders in more than 100 countries. In October 2011, clobazam (Onfi\u2122; Lundbeck Inc., Deerfield, IL, USA) was approved by the US FDA for use as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients aged 2 years and older. It is a long-acting 1,5-benzodiazepine whose structure distinguishes it from the classic 1,4-benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, lorazepam and clonazepam. Clobazam is well absorbed, with peak concentrations occurring linearly 1-4 hours after administration. Both clobazam and its active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, are metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 pathway. The mean half-life of N-desmethylclobazam (67.5 hours) is nearly double the mean half-life of clobazam (37.5 hours). Clobazam was synthesized with the anticipation that its distinct chemical structure would provide greater efficacy with fewer benzodiazepine-associated adverse effects. Frequently reported adverse effects of clobazam therapy include dizziness, sedation, drowsiness and ataxia. Evidence gathered from approximately 50 epilepsy clinical trials in adults and children indicated that the sedative effects observed with clobazam treatment were less severe than those reported with 1,4-benzodiazepines. In several studies of healthy volunteers and patients with anxiety, clobazam appeared to enhance participants' performance in cognitive tests, further distinguishing it from the 1,4-benzodiazepines. The anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects of clobazam are associated with allosteric activation of the ligand-gated GABA(A) receptor. GABA(A) receptors are found extensively throughout the CNS, occurring synaptically and extrasynaptically. GABA(A) receptors are composed of five protein subunits, two copies of a single type of \u03b1 subunit, two copies of one type of \u03b2 subunit and a \u03b3 subunit. This arrangement results in a diverse assortment of receptor subtypes. As benzodiazepine pharmacology is influenced by differences in affinity for particular GABA(A) subtypes, characterizing the selectivity of different benzodiazepines is a promising avenue for establishing appropriate use of these agents in neurological disorders. Molecular techniques have significantly advanced since the inception of clobazam as a clinical agent, adding to the understanding of the GABA(A) receptor, its subunits and benzodiazepine pharmacology. Transgenic mouse models have been particularly useful in this regard. Comparative studies between transgenic and wild-type mice have further defined relationships between GABA(A) receptor composition and drug effects. From such studies, we have learned that sedating and amnesic effects are mediated by the GABA(A) \u03b1(1) subunit, \u03b1(2) receptors mediate anxiolytic effects, \u03b1 subunits are involved with anticonvulsant activity, \u03b1(5) may be implicated in learning and memory, and \u03b2(3) subunit deficiency decreases GABA inhibition. Despite progress in determining the role of various subunits to specific benzodiazepine pharmacological actions, the precise mechanism of action of clobazam, and more importantly, how that mechanism of action translates into clinical consequences (i.e. efficacy, tolerability and safety) remain unknown. Testing clobazam and 1,4-benzodiazepines using a range of recombinant GABA(A) receptor subtypes would hopefully elucidate the subunits involved and strengthen our understanding of clobazam and its mechanism of action.",

    "19": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental disorder with a global prevalence of 1% and its etiology remains poorly understood. In the current study we investigated the influence of antipsychotic drugs on the effects of MK-801 administration, which is a drug that mimics biochemical changes observed in schizophrenia, on Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity and some parameters of oxidative stress in zebrafish brain. Our results showed that MK-801 treatment significantly decreased Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity, and all antipsychotics tested prevented such effects. Acute MK-801 treatment did not alter reactive oxygen/nitrogen species by 2'7'-dichlorofluorscein (H2DCF) oxidation assay, but increased the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), when compared with controls. Some antipsychotics such as sulpiride, olanzapine, and haloperidol prevented the increase of TBARS caused by MK-801. These findings indicate oxidative damage might be a mechanism involved in the decrease of Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity induced by MK-801. The parameters evaluated in this study had not yet been tested in this animal model using the MK-801, suggesting that zebrafish is an animal model that can contribute for providing information on potential treatments and disease characteristics.",

The highest correlation and best predictive values for edema formation with a sensitivity, specificity, and a positive and negative predictive value of 100% were found for subvolumes with severe ischemia. Correlation coefficients and prediction decreased for subvolumes with less severe perfusional deficit, pointing to the risk of misclassifying patients when relying on the volume of total perfusional deficit alone.",

Alprazolam use was associated with the sale of drugs for cash, but not with other criminal activities.", 
    "32": "The fluctuations in alprazolam use over time may be reflective of medical practitioners ceasing to prescribe alprazolam in response to reports of associated harms; however, this may in turn be driving the illicit alprazolam market. While the data do not indicate a clear association between alprazolam use and harms, considering the potential severity of associated harms and the association between alprazolam use and anterograde amnesia, patterns of alprazolam use among PWID should be closely monitored. Potential changes to prescribing practice should consider unintended consequences, such as replacement with other BZD types, or illicitly obtained BZDs.", 
    "33": "Changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-mediated signaling in the hippocampus have been implicated in the etiology of depression and in the mode of action of antidepressant drugs. There is also evidence from animal studies to suggest that BDNF-induced changes in the hippocampus may play a role in another stress-related pathology: anxiety. However, it is still unknown whether this neurotrophin plays a differential role in defensive responses associated with distinguished subtypes of anxiety disorders found in the clinic, such as generalized anxiety and panic disorder. In the present study, we investigated the effect of an acute BDNF injection into the rat dorsal hippocampus (DH) on inhibitory avoidance acquisition and escape expression measured in the elevated T-maze (ETM). We also assessed whether serotonergic neurotransmission may account for such effects. Intra-DH BDNF injection (200 pg) facilitated inhibitory avoidance in ETM. BDNF was equally anxiogenic in the light/dark transition test. Preadministration of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 fully counteracted the anxiogenic effect of BDNF in both tests. Intra-DH midazolam administration (10 nmol) impaired avoidance acquisition in ETM, suggesting an anxiolytic effect. Therefore, in the DH, facilitation of BDNF signaling seems to enhance 5-HT1A receptor-mediated neurotransmission to exert an anxiogenic effect associated with generalized anxiety.", 
    "34": "Benzodiazepines are psychoactive drugs with anxiolytic, sedative, skeletal muscle relaxant and amnestic properties. Recently triazolo-benzodiazepines have been also described as potent and highly selective protein interaction inhibitors of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins, a family of transcriptional co-regulators that play a key role in cancer cell survival and proliferation, but the requirements for high affinity interaction of this compound class with bromodomains has not been described. Here we provide insight into the structure-activity relationship (SAR) and selectivity of this versatile scaffold. In addition, using high resolution crystal structures we compared the binding mode of a series of benzodiazepine (BzD) and related triazolo-benzotriazepines (BzT) derivatives including clinically approved drugs such as alprazolam and midazolam. Our analysis revealed the importance of the 1-methyl triazolo ring system for BET binding and suggests modifications for the development of further high affinity bromodomain inhibitors.",

A new approach to sedation places it within its therapeutic aim and also takes into account the sometimes harmful impact on the course of the patient's care. A pretherapeutical, analysis both clinical and environmental is crucial. The time spent on the initial meeting and assessment is essential. The evolution of professional practices in mental health allows us to distinguish three kinds of sedation (vigilance, behaviour and psychical) that guide the choice and the mode of psychotropic drug use. The harmful effects of an ever-increasing use of sedation is debated. The use of atypical antipsychotics and injectable forms is argued. Early psychical sedation is preferable to the obsolete practice of vigilance sedation and to behavioural sedation with its limited indications. The use of excessive or prolonged sedation might have a detrimental effect on the care offered after psychiatric emergency treatment.",

It is found in about 10% of psychiatric hospital admissions, in patients with depressed and manic mood states and in toxic states. It is quickly treatable to remission by benzodiazepines and by ECT. The DSM-V revision proposes catatonia in two major diagnostic classes, specifiers for 10 principal diagnoses, and deletion of the designation of schizophrenia, catatonic type. This complex recommendation serves no clinical or research purpose and confuses treatment options. Catatonia is best considered in the proposed ICD revision as a unique syndrome of multiple forms warranting a single unique defined class similar to that of delirium.",

Many of these patients undergo extensive work-up and treatment. Much of the evidence regarding cocaine's cardiovascular effects, as well as the current management of cocaine-associated chest pain and acute coronary syndromes, is anecdotally derived and based on studies written more than 2 decades ago that involved only a few patients. Newer studies have brought into question many of the commonly held theories and practices regarding the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of this common clinical scenario. However, there continues to be a paucity of prospective, randomized trials addressing this topic as it relates to clinical outcomes. We searched PubMed for English-language articles from 1960 to 2011 using the keywords cocaine, chest pain, coronary arteries, myocardial infarction, emergency department, cardiac biomarkers, electrocardiogram, coronary computed tomography, observation unit, \u03b2-blockers, benzodiazepines, nitroglycerin, calcium channel blockers, phentolamine, and cardiomyopathy; including various combinations of these terms.

Benzodiazepines remain the first line of treatment; up to 80% of patients respond promptly to Lorazepam challenge; failure to respond to lorazepam may be followed by electroconvulsive therapy. Atypical antipsychotics may be a new alternative in the treatment of catatonia. Successful reduction of the catatonic symptoms has been demonstrated with atypical antipsychotics.

Hair decontamination was performed with dichloromethane, and incubation in 2 mL of acetonitrile at 50\u00b0C overnight. Extraction procedure was performed in 2 steps, first liquid-liquid extraction, hexane:ethyl acetate (55:45, v:v) at pH 9, followed by solid-phase extraction (Strata-X cartridges). Chromatographic separation was performed in AtlantisT3 (2.1 mm \u00d7 100 mm, 3 \u03bcm) column, acetonitrile and ammonium formate pH 3 as mobile phase, and 32 min total run time. One transition per analyte was monitored in MRM mode. To confirm a positive result, a second injection monitoring 2 transitions was performed. The method was specific (no endogenous interferences, n=9); LOD was 0.2-50 pg/mg and LOQ 0.5-100 pg/mg; linearity ranged from 0.5-100 to 2000-20,000 pg/mg; imprecision <15%; analytical recovery 85-115%; extraction efficiency 4.1-85.6%; and process efficiency 2.5-207.7%; 27 analytes showed ion suppression (up to -86.2%), 4 ion enhancement (up to 647.1%), and 4 no matrix effect; compounds showed good stability 24-48 h in autosampler. The method was applied to 17 forensic cases. In conclusion, a sensitive and specific target screening of 35 analytes in 50mg hair, including drugs of abuse (THC, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines) and medicines (benzodiazepines, antidepressants) was developed and validated, achieving lower cut-offs than Society of Hair Testing recommendations.",

For the following 3 weeks, the olanzapine and haloperidol groups continued their treatment, while the placebo group switched blindly to olanzapine. The primary efficacy measure was the mean change in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score; secondary efficacy measures included bipolar disorder remission rate and switch-to depression. Safety measures included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), weight and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPSs).",

The sample comprised 103 dental sedation sessions among 22 male and 20 female patients, 1-8 years old, receiving either MZ (1.0-1.5 mg/kg) or CH (70.0-100.0 mg/kg). During treatment, a single observer recorded intraoperative adverse events. Twenty-four hours later, the observer called the child's main caregiver seeking information on further adverse events. Data analysis involved descriptive and bivariate statistics and the general estimating equation for repeated measures.",

    "69": "Aggressive behaviour is common in forensic psychiatric settings. The aetiology of aggressive behaviour is multifactorial and can be driven by psychosis, impulsivity, psychopathy, intoxication, cognitive impairment, or a combination of all of these. Recognition of the different factors behind the aggression can inform medication selection and the relative need for specific environmental and behavioural interventions in a forensic psychiatric setting. Acute agitation needs to be managed quickly and effectively before further escalation of the behavioural dyscontrol occurs. Benzodiazepines and/or antipsychotic medications are often used and can be given intramuscularly to achieve a rapid onset of action. Available are intramuscular preparations of second-generation antipsychotics that have similar efficacy to lorazepam and haloperidol in reducing agitation, but are well tolerated and not associated with the extrapyramidal adverse effects, including akathisia, that can plague the older first-generation antipsychotics. The longer-term management of persistent aggressive behaviour can be quite complex. A major obstacle is that the causality of aggressive events can differ from patient to patient, and also from event to event in the same patient. For patients with schizophrenia and persistent aggressive behaviour, clozapine is recommended both for its superior antipsychotic effect and its specific anti-hostility effect. Mood stabilizers such as valproate may be helpful in instances of poor impulsivity and personality disorders. Other agents that have been successfully used include \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists (\u03b2-blockers) and antidepressants.",

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) were performed using a clinical 3-Tesla MR imager in 4 patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (2 boys and 2 girls; aged 2-6 years.) and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. Furthermore, interictal 123I-iomazenil (IMZ) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was examined in 2 of the 4 patients. Among the 4 patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, 2 patients showed polymicrogyria and 1 patient showed agyria. Those patients with brain malformations also showed abnormal brain artery patterns and decreased accumulation of IMZ in 123I-IMZ SPECT. Although all 4 patients showed epileptic discharges in their electroencephalograms (EEG), one patient with polymicrogyria had no seizure episodes. Decreases in \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) corresponding to the areas of polymicrogyria and/or epileptic discharges in EEG were shown in all patients except for the patient with agyria. Although consistent evidence was not seen in patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in this study, brain malformations and disturbances of the GABAergic nervous system would be underlying mechanisms of the neurodevelopmental abnormalities in this syndrome.", 
    "71": "In two Danish general practices a few simple rules applicable to all age groups were introduced in order to reduce consumption of benzodiazepines (BZ) and cyclopyrrolones (CP). These rules, termed the \"Thybor\u00f8n-Model\", included the termination of telephone prescriptions, the issuance of prescriptions only following personal consultation and the restriction of prescriptions to a maximum of a single month's consumption. The purpose of the present demographic analysis is to investigate whether the intervention was successful for the elderly, who are considered to be a special target group. The findings presented here reveal that the number of BZ and CP users increased with increasing age. Furthermore, the results indicate that the intervention was effective in reducing the consumption of BZ and CP for middle-aged and elderly patients, and that there is a significantly better effect of this model for middle-aged than for elderly patients. These findings constitute the first demographic evaluation of the effects of the \"Thybor\u00f8n-Model\" with focus on the special target group of elderly patients, and indicate that it is advisable to introduce these simple rules for all age groups, especially since they also are effective on elderly patients.", 
    "72": "Reasons for the rising annual incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) remain uncertain. Previous studies have given conflicting results, but some have suggested that drugs which relax the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) may increase the risk of EAC. This study is to determine systematically the risk of EAC associated with individual medications which relax the LES and compare risks with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA). Relevant published studies were identified by systematic searching PubMed for case-control studies reporting on risk of EAC, ESCC or GCA with use of medications known to reduce LES pressure. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for each malignancy. Data were analyzed from four case-control studies involving 9,412 participants. EAC was significantly associated with theophylline use (OR 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-2.28; P= 0.03, I(2) = 0%) and anticholinergic medications (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.13-2.44; P= 0.01, I(2) = 84%). This effect was not observed in cases of ESCC or GCA. Other drug groups including calcium channel modulators and nitrates did not increase the risk of EAC. An inverse relationship was observed between ESCC and nitrates and between GCA and benzodiazepines. The lack of increased EAC risk with many commonly used medications is reassuring. However, a significant correlation was found between EAC and the use of anticholinergics and theophyllines. This may reflect common causality between obstructive lung disease and EAC, and further studies to explore these relationships are warranted.", 
    "73": "Phospholipase C-related, but catalytically inactive protein (PRIP) was first identified as a novel inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate binding protein. The PRIP-1 subtype is expressed predominantly in the central nervous system and binds directly to the GABA type A receptor (GABA(A)-R) \u03b2-subunit and several other proteins involved in the trafficking of GABA(A)-Rs to the plasma membrane. We found that the PRIP-1 knockout mouse showed an epileptic phenotype, confirmed by electroencephalogram. These ictal seizures were completely suppressed by diazepam (DZP), but the interictal discharges could not be abolished. We studied the electrophysiological properties of GABAergic transmission in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, using a slice patch-clamp technique. There was no difference in the effect of up to 1 \u03bcM DZP on the amplitude and frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents between PRIP-1 knockout neurons versus wild-type neurons. In contrast, the amplitude of the tonic GABA current in PRIP-1 knockout neurons was markedly reduced compared with that in wild-type neurons. Consequently, the effect of DZP on PRIP-1 knockout mice was reduced. Dysfunction of extrasynaptic GABAergic transmission probably is involved in the epileptic phenotype of PRIP-1 knockout mice.", 
    "74": "Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a devastating childhood epilepsy syndrome characterized by the occurrence of multiple types of seizures and cognitive decline. Most children suffer from frequent seizures that are refractory to current medical management. Recent clinical trials have suggested that addition of clobazam may improve the clinical outcome for some LGS patients. Although clobazam has been available for over five decades, it has only recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for this indication. As a 1,5-benzodiazepine, clobazam is structurally related to the widely used 1,4-benzodiazepines, which include diazepam. Clobazam has been shown to modulate GABAergic neurotransmission by positive allosteric modulation of GABA(A) receptors, and to increase expression of transporters for both GABA and glutamate. The active metabolite n-desmethylclobazam (norclobazam) also modulates GABA(A) receptors, and the relative importance of these two compounds in the clinical effectiveness of clobazam remains an open question. Clinical trials involving clobazam as an addon therapy in a variety of pediatric epilepsy populations have found a significant improvement in seizure control. In patients with LGS, clobazam may have greatest efficacy for drop seizures. Longstanding clinical experience suggests that clobazam is a safe and well tolerated antiepileptic drug with infrequent and mild adverse effects. These results suggest that adjunctive treatment with clobazam may be a reasonable option for LGS patients, particularly those who are treatment-resistant.",

    "78": "Linear variables evidenced a statistically significant drug-induced decrease, whereas nonlinear variables showed significant increases. All changes were highly correlated to drug plasma concentrations. The spatial distribution of the observed connectivity changes clearly differed from a previous study: changes before and after the maximum drug effect were mainly observed over the anterior half of the scalp. Additionally, a new variable with very low computational cost was defined to evaluate nonlinear coupling. This is particularly interesting when all pairs of EEG channels are assessed as in this study.", 
    "79": "Results showed that alprazolam induced changes in terms of uncoupling between regions of the scalp, with opposite trends depending on the variables: decrease in linear ones and increase in nonlinear features. Maps provided consistent information about the way brain changed in terms of connectivity being definitely necessary to evaluate separately linear and nonlinear interactions.",

    "84": "The induction of cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes is one of the risk factors for drug-drug interactions (DDIs). To date, the human pregnane X receptor (PXR)-mediated CYP3A4 induction has been well studied. In addition to CYP3A4, the expression of CYP2C subfamily is also regulated by PXR, and the DDIs caused by the induction of CYP2C enzymes have been reported to have a major clinical impact. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether chimeric mice with a humanized liver (PXB mice) can be a suitable animal model for investigating the PXR-mediated induction of CYP2C subfamily, together with CYP3A4. We evaluated the inductive effect of rifampicin (RIF), a typical human PXR ligand, on the plasma exposure to the four P450 substrate drugs (triazolam/CYP3A4, pioglitazone/CYP2C8, (S)-warfarin/CYP2C9, and (S)-(-)-mephenytoin/CYP2C19) by cassette dosing in PXB mice. The induction of several drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters in the liver was also examined by measuring the enzyme activity and mRNA expression levels. Significant reductions in the exposure to triazolam, pioglitazone, and (S)-(-)-mephenytoin, but not to (S)-warfarin, were observed. In contrast to the in vivo results, all the four P450 isoforms, including CYP2C9, were elevated by RIF treatment. The discrepancy in the (S)-warfarin results between in vivo and in vitro studies may be attributed to the relatively small contribution of CYP2C9 to (S)-warfarin elimination in the PXB mice used in this study. In summary, PXB mice are a useful animal model to examine DDIs caused by PXR-mediated induction of CYP2C and CYP3A4.",

Catatonia usually responds to standard treatment with benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy; however, this patient's catatonic syndrome did not improve until we augmented the standard treatment with amantadine and levodopa. The underlying pathophysiology and a neurochemical hypothesis of HD and catatonia can explain their comorbidity and the refractoriness of catatonia to treatment. Both conditions are linked to dysregulation of neurotransmitters in the striatocortical and corticocortical pathways. This understanding may serve as a guide for the use of nonstandard treatments.

Aliquots of 500 \u03bcL whole blood were added 500 \u03bcL of borate buffer pH 11 and extracted by solid-supported liquid-liquid extraction on ChemElut(\u00ae) columns using three times 2.5 mL of methyl tert-butyl ether. Deuterated analogues were used as internal standards (IS) for all analytes, except for midazolam, phenazepam and bromazepam which had no commercially available deuterated analogues at the time the method was developed, and therefore used diazepam-d(5), flunitrazepam-d(7) and nitrazepam-d(5), respectively. The analytes were separated using UPLC with a 2.1\u00d7100 mm BEH C(18)-column, 1.7 \u03bcm particle size, and quantified by MS/MS using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in positive mode. Two transitions were used for the analytes and one transition for the IS. The run time of the method was 8 min including equilibration time. The concentrations of the benzodiazepines in the method span a broad range varying from the lowest concentration of 0.005 \u03bcM for flunitrazepam to the highest of 20 \u03bcM for oxazepam. The calibration curves of extracted whole blood standards were fitted by second-order calibration curves weighted 1/x, with R(2) values ranging from 0.9981 to 0.9998.

    "154": "Several Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) are used in the treatment of insomnia, restlessness, or anxiety. However, mechanisms underlying this effect and scientific proof for their traditional use is scarce. In the present study CHMs were screened for their ability to modulate GABA-induced chloride currents (I(GABA)), and active principles were isolated thus providing scientific evidence for their use as sedative and/or anxiolytic agents in CM. Herbal drugs were extracted successively with petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, methanol and water and further fractionated according to their bioactivity. The obtained extracts, fractions and finally pure compounds were tested for their ability to potentiate I(GABA) using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique on recombinant \u03b1\u2081\u03b2\u2082\u03b3(2S) GABA(A) receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. From all tested extracts the petroleum ether extract of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz. rhizomes showed the strongest I(GABA) potentiation and was studied in more detail. This led to the isolation of the main components atractylenolide II and III, which seem to be responsible for the observed positive modulation of I(GABA) (166\u00b112%, n=3 and 155\u00b112%, n=3, respectively) in vitro. They were more active than the analogous compound atractylenolide I (96\u00b13%, n=3) which differs in an additional double binding in position 9, 9a. Furthermore it could be shown that this effect is mediated independently of the benzodiazepine (BZ) binding site. In conclusion, A. macrocephala exerts its in vitro activity on recombinant GABA(A) receptors mainly through the two sesquiterpene lactones atractylenolide II and III (Fig. 1). This positive allosteric modulation of I(GABA) may partially be responsible for the traditional ethnopharmacological use of this herbal drug as a sedative.",

Since one manifestation of the pathology of DID is that sufferers avoid relying on others, at the start of treatment we try to stabilise the relationship between clinicians and patients; that is to say, we aim to build a treatment relationship which will be able to gradually overcome the patients' dread of relying on clinicians. In parallel with this we undertake a thorough psychiatric assessment of their condition. This is a standard treatment plan, which follows the general principles of clinical psychiatry.

This paper presents the first DID case which the author has taken charge of. There were some difficulties in the early stages of treatment, but after modifying some parts to acknowledge the alternating personalities as independent personalities in face-to-face interviews and psychological education for families, the stabilisation of the treatment structure progressed gradually and the stability of the relationship between clinicians and patients itself has become the focus.",

Exposures peaked in September and fell to a nadir in January and February. Fifty-eight percent of the cases involved males, and the mean (SD) age was 31.5 (17.4) years. Sixty-five percent of the patients had minor clinical effects, 33.5% had moderate effects, 1.4% had major effects, and there were no deaths. Antivenom use was associated with symptom duration of less than 24 hours in moderate and major outcome groups. There was no evidence of shorter symptom duration in patients who received benzodiazepines or calcium. Adverse drug reactions were more common in patients receiving benzodiazepines and antivenom.",

    "176": "The intake of a large variety of substances has a negative impact on sleep. Widely used, readily available substances like alcohol, nicotine, or caffeine need to be mentioned here. Illicit drugs (e.g., heroin or ecstasy) have different mechanisms of action with a high sleep-disrupting potential. Prescription drugs, i.e., corticosteroids or \u03b2-blockers, may also negatively affect sleep. An important question is whether the intake of hypnotics, especially benzodiazepines, may have a negative long-term effect on sleep. Classical benzodiazepines (BZ) initially lead to a reduction of nocturnal wake time and prolong total sleep time as a desired effect. Regarding the microstructure of sleep, BZ lead to a reduction of slow frequencies and an increase of fast frequencies in the EEG. With many BZ, tolerance may occur, thus, leading to unwanted dose increases. Further problems include rebound effects that occur upon discontinuation of BZ, including a drastic deterioration of sleep upon drug withdrawal. This phenomenon may pave the way for the development of drug dependency. Further unwanted side-effects (e.g., nocturnal falls) and the question of BZ abuse and dependency will be discussed.",

Among the 156 ADRs with at least one theoretical DDI, 41% (95% confidence interval 34-49%) could be explained by a DDI. The most frequent antidepressant involved in DDIs was escitalopram, followed by fluoxetine and citalopram. Among the 65 ADRs related to DDIs, 37 (52.9%) were \"serious\", mainly bleedings, confusion and falls, hyponatremia and serotoninergic syndromes. The most frequent drug interactions occurred with psychotropics (antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, among others), followed by antithrombotic agents (antagonists of vitamin K, antiplatelets), diuretics and angiotensin II antagonists. The group with ADRs related to DDIs was older than the group with ADRs not related to DDIs. ADRs were threefold more \"serious\" in the case of DDIs.",

However, the PSA results indicated that olanzapine and risperidone were not different in terms of cost-effectiveness within a 95% confidence interval. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness (ICE) scatterplot showed that the chance of olanzapine being an optimal alternative was 67.1% in the model.",

    "185": "Simultaneous specific and nonspecific binding of bendroflumethiazide (BFZ) to human serum albumin (HSA) and concentration profile of BFZ in HSA buffer (pH 7.40) solution were investigated by \u00b9\u2079F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method. The \u00b9\u2079F NMR spectrum of BFZ (200 \u03bcM) in a buffer solution showed a sharp signal of its CF\u2083 group at 17.8 ppm from the reference trifluoroethanol. Addition of 0.60mM HSA to the sample solution caused the CF(3) signal splitting into three broadened peaks at 18.4 (A), 17.9 (B) and 17.4 ppm (C). By its chemical shift and spectral behavior, B was assigned to unbound BFZ. Competition experiments with Site I and II ligands lead to C being assigned to Site II bound BFZ. However, the peak intensity (areas) of A was not reduced by these ligands, suggesting that A arises from nonspecific binding. Using the peak intensities at several total concentrations of BFZ, Scatchard plot was performed. The plot for A provided a straight line parallel to the x-axis confirming nonspecific binding and that for C was consistent with specific binding. The binding constants for nonspecific and specific Site II binding were 1.02 and 1.00 \u00d7 10\u2074 (M\u207b\u00b9) (n=1.1), respectively. The presence of 0.10 M Cl\u207b in the sample solution affected the binding constant of Site II binding, but not that of nonspecific binding. The concentration profile of BFZ calculated using the binding constants revealed that nonspecific binding is more effective than Site II binding for the binding of BFZ to HSA. It was also confirmed that considerable amounts of BFZ liberated from Site II by the Site II ligands or Cl\u207b ions bind again nonspecifically.", 
    "186": "Benzodiazepine derivatives are prescribed in large quantities globally and are potentially new emerging environmental contaminants. Unfortunately, a dearth of data exists concerning occurrence, persistence and fate in the environment. This paper redresses this by reviewing existing literature, assessing the occurrence of selected benzodiazepine anxiolytics (diazepam, oxazepam and bromazepam) in wastewater influent and effluent and surface water from Slovenia, evaluating their removal during water treatment and identifying the transformation products formed during water treatment. Their occurrence was monitored in hospital effluent, river water and in wastewater treatment plant influent and effluent. The study reveals the presence of benzodiazepine derivatives in all samples with the highest amounts in hospital effluents: 111 ng L(-1), 158 ng L(-1) and 72 ng L(-1) for diazepam, bromazepam and oxazepam, respectively. Removal efficiencies with respect to biological treatment of diazepam were 16-18% (oxic), 18-32% (anoxic\u2192oxic), 53-76% (oxic\u2192anoxic) and 83% (oxic\u2192anoxic\u2192oxic\u2192anoxic cascade bioreactors), while the removal oxazepam was 20-24% under anoxic conditions. Coupled biological and photochemical treatment followed by the adsorption to activated carbon resulted in a removal efficiency of 99.99%. Results reveal the recalcitrant nature of benzodiazepine derivatives and suggest that only combinational treatment is sufficient to remove them. In addition, eight novel diazepam and four novel oxazepam transformation products are reported.",

The analytes and the internal standard (IS) duloxetine were extracted from 500\u2009\u03bcL aliquots of human plasma through solid-phase extraction. Chromatographic separation was achieved in a run time of 4.0\u2009min on a Hypersil Gold C\u2081\u2088 column (50\u2009\u00d7\u20094.6\u2009mm, 5\u2009\u00b5m) using isocratic mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile-water containing 2% formic acid (70:30, v/v), at a flow-rate of 0.5\u2009mL/min. Detection of analytes and internal standard was performed by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, operating in positive-ion and multiple reaction monitoring acquisition mode.

This method is suitable for measuring accurate plasma concentration in bioequivalence study and therapeutic drug monitoring as well, following combined administration.", 
    "192": "In early discovery, compounds are often eliminated because of their potential to undergo metabolic activation and/or cytochrome P450 time-dependent inactivation (TDI). The blockbuster drug raloxifene is an example of a compound that would have been eliminated in the current paradigm. Despite raloxifene's in vitro bioactivation and TDI of CYP3A4, it is well tolerated in patients with no drug-drug interactions. This discordance is attributed to its presystemic glucuronidation, thereby decreasing the amount of unchanged raloxifene available for CYP3A inactivation. The current study used raloxifene as a model to assess the effect of hepatic and intestinal glucuronidation on the kinetic parameters of CYP3A4 inactivation. Therefore, a simple multistaged time-dependent inactivation using UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-enabled and -absent reactions was built to understand the impact of the gut metabolism on inactivation potential. The results of these experiments demonstrated a 2.7-fold change in inactivation efficiency of CYP3A4. Incorporation of these results into a simulated midazolam drug-drug interaction study showed very little change in the pharmacokinetic parameters of the victim drug. In contrast, the absence of glucuronidation resulted in a 4.1-fold increase in the area under the curve (AUC) of midazolam, when in the presence of raloxifene, hence providing an understanding of the impact of intestinal glucuronidation on raloxifene's time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 and also providing a validation of a simple in vitro experiment to assess the influence of gut metabolism on time-dependent inhibitors at the discovery phase.",

A study of all patients (n = 486) treated by means of ECT for major depressive disorder was performed. The data were derived from a regional quality register in Sweden. Psychiatric hospitalisation or suicide was used as a marker for relapse/recurrence. Results. The relapse/recurrence rate within one year after ECT was 34%. Factors associated with increased risk of relapse/recurrence included comorbid substance dependence and treatment with benzodiazepines or antipsychotics during the follow-up period. Conclusions. Within the first years after ECT, relapses/recurrences leading to hospitalisation or suicide are common. Treatment with lithium might be beneficial, while benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, or continuation ECT does not seem to significantly reduce the risk of relapse/recurrence.",

However adverse effects on breathing have been also reported with alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists and their central effects on the respiratory rhythm generator are poorly known. We therefore examined the effects of dexmedetomidine, clonidine, the alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine and the benzodiazepine midazolam on the activity of the isolated respiratory rhythm generator of neonatal mice using medullary preparations where the respiratory rhythm generator continued to function in vitro. For the first time, we showed that 5min bath applications of dexmedetomidine or clonidine activated the respiratory rhythm generator for periods over than 30min. Second, we showed that the long-lasting effect of dexmedetomidine implicated receptors other than alpha-2 adrenoceptors as it persisted after their blockade with yohimbine. Third, we reported that 5min bath applications of the benzodiazepine midazolam significantly depressed the respiratory rhythm generator, and that this depression was prevented by pre-treatment with either dexmedetomidine or clonidine. Although further experiments are still required to identify the mechanisms through which dexmedetomidine and clonidine activate the respiratory rhythm generator, our current in vitro results in neonatal mice support the use of dexmedetomidine and clonidine in the critical care unit.",

    "222": "Itraconazole (ITZ) is a mixture of four cis-stereoisomers that inhibit CYP3A4 potently and coordinate CYP3A4 heme via the triazole nitrogen. However, (2R,4S,2'R)-ITZ and (2R,4S,2'S)-ITZ also undergo stereoselective sequential metabolism by CYP3A4 at a site distant from the triazole ring to 3'-OH-ITZ, keto-ITZ, and N-desalkyl-ITZ. This stereoselective metabolism demonstrates specific interactions of ITZ within the CYP3A4 active site. To further investigate this process, the binding and metabolism of the four trans-ITZ stereoisomers by CYP3A4 were characterized. All four trans-ITZ stereoisomers were tight binding inhibitors of CYP3A4-mediated midazolam hydroxylation (IC(50) 16-26 nM), and each gave a type II spectrum upon binding to CYP3A4. However, instead of formation of 3'-OH-ITZ, they were oxidized at the dioxolane ring, leading to ring scission and formation of two new metabolites of ITZ. These two metabolites were also formed from the four cis-ITZ stereoisomers, although not as efficiently. The catalytic rates of dioxolane ring scission were similar to the dissociation rates of ITZ stereoisomers from CYP3A4, suggesting that the heme iron is reduced while the triazole moiety coordinates to it and no dissociation of ITZ is necessary before catalysis. The triazole containing metabolite [1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)ethanone] also inhibited CYP3A4 (IC(50) >15 \u03bcM) and showed type II binding with CYP3A4. The dioxolane ring scission appears to be clinically relevant because this metabolite was detected in urine samples from subjects that had been administered the mixture of cis-ITZ isomers. These data suggest that the dioxolane ring scission is a metabolic pathway for drugs that contain this moiety.",

Whereas cognitive behavioral therapy and antiobsessive antidepressants brought up inconsistent results, pharmacological add-on strategies were able to alleviate OCS. One suggestive agent for antiobsessive add-on treatment is aripiprazole, a partial agonist at dopamine and serotonin receptors. Here, we summarize the course of a patient with paranoid schizophrenia. She developed OCS during long-term treatment with olanzapine at 20 mg/d over a period of 10 years. Baseline assessment showed severe obsessions (Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) subscale score : 13) and compulsions (YBOCS subscale score : 10), whereas the psychotic syndrome was compensated (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, 11/17/28).

    "231": "Users of methadone and buprenorphine were at increased risk of being responsible for injurious road traffic crashes. The increased risk could be explained by the combined effect of risky behaviors and treatments.", 
    "232": "The study used the paw withdrawal test to investigate the role of the cholinergic system on the modulation of inflammatory pain induced by carrageenan (Cg) at the peripheral level, through activation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. Intraplantar administration of the specific M(1) receptor antagonist telenzepine (TEL; 6, 12 and 24 \u03bcg/paw) caused a dose-dependent reduction in the nociceptive threshold induced by Cg (125 \u03bcg/paw). This effect was not observed with increasing doses (4, 10 and 40 \u03bcg) of other specific receptor antagonists: M(2) (dimethindene), M(3) (4-DAMP) and M(4) (tropicamide). The nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine (MEC; 25, 50 and 100 \u03bcg/paw) also caused a dose-dependent reduction in the nociceptive threshold induced by Cg (125 \u03bcg). To exclude a non-local effect, Cg (125 \u03bcg) was injected into both hind paws, while TEL (12 \u03bcg) and MEC (50 \u03bcg) were administered only in the right paw. At these doses, the muscarinic antagonists increased inflammatory pain only in the treated right paw, suggesting a peripheral effect. In the presence of prostaglandin E(2) (1 \u03bcg/paw), TEL (12 \u03bcg) and MEC (50 \u03bcg) did not reduce the nociceptive threshold, suggesting that this hyperalgesic agent does not induce the release of endogenous acetylcholine. These data suggest that muscarinic M(1) and nicotinic receptors participate in the modulation of endogenous cholinergic inflammatory pain at the peripheral level.", 
    "233": "A series of bisindole-pyrrolobenzodiazepine conjugates (5a-f) linked through different alkane spacers was prepared and evaluated for their anticancer activity. All compounds exhibited significant anticancer potency and the most potent compounds 5b and 5e were taken up for detailed studies on MCF-7 cell line. Cell cycle effects were examined apart from investigating the inhibition of tubulin polymerization for compounds 2a, 2b, 5b and 5e at 2\u03bcM. FACS analysis showed that at higher concentrations (4 and 8\u03bcM) there was an increase of sub-G1 phase cells and decrease of G2/M phase cells, thus indicating that compounds 5b and 5e are effective in causing apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. It was also observed that compounds 5b and 5e showed the down regulation of histone deacetylase protein levels such as HDAC1, 2, 3, 8 and increase in the levels of p21, followed by apoptotic cell death. The apoptotic nature of these compounds was further evidenced by increased expression of cleaved-PARP and active caspase-7 in MCF-7 cells.", 
    "234": "Capture myopathy is a complication of capture and handling in many species of birds and mammals. Muscular necrosis leads to ataxia, paralysis, and pain, whereas metabolic disturbances can result in death. We conducted an opportunistic clinical trial on Bar-tailed Godwits (Limosa lapponica baueri) that developed capture myopathy after a cannon-net capture in New Zealand in October 2008. We assessed the beneficial effects of midazolam, a benzodiazepine with the effects of anxiolysis, muscle relaxation, and sedation, in the adjunctive treatment of capture myopathy. Physical and biochemical parameters were analyzed retrospectively for their potential as indicators for survival until release. Birds (n=16) were treated with subcutaneous fluid therapy, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (meloxicam), gavage feeding, and sling therapy twice daily. The treatment group (n=8) was treated twice daily with intramuscular midazolam injections, 1.5 mg/kg. Surviving godwits were released over 1-9 days, with 6 of 8 treated birds (75%) surviving to release, compared with 3 of 8 controls (38%). Inability to counteract weight loss in captivity was the most significant problem for both groups. Lack of waterproofing and predation were contributing causes of death for at least two godwits after release. Birds treated with midazolam showed subjective benefits including improved tolerance of handling and sling therapy. Clinical parameters (change in body mass, packed cell volume [PCV], plasma creatine kinase [CK], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], total protein, and uric acid [UA] over time) were not statistically different between groups, although peak average values for CK, AST, and UA were lower in the treatment group. Decline in body mass (%), PCV, final plasma UA, and peak plasma CK were the most useful prognostic indicators. Midazolam shows potential as an ancillary treatment for capture myopathy in birds and is worthy of continued study and use.", 
    "235": "To evaluate the GABA(A) receptor in the autistic brain, we performed (123)I-IMZ SPECT in patients with ASD. We compared (123)I-IMZ SPECT abnormalities in patients who showed intellectual disturbance or focal epileptic discharge on EEG to those in patients without such findings.", 
    "236": "The subjects consisted of 24 patients with ASD (mean age, 7.3\u00b13.5 years), including 9 with autistic disorder (mean age, 7.0\u00b13.7 years) and 15 with Asperger's disorder (mean age, 7.5\u00b13.2 years). We used 10 non-symptomatic partial epilepsy patients (mean age, 7.8\u00b13.6 years) without intellectual delay as a control group. For an objective evaluation of the (123)I-IMZ SPECT results, we performed an SEE (Stereotactic Extraction Estimation) analysis to describe the decrease in accumulation in each brain lobule numerically.", 
    "237": "In the comparison of the ASD group and the control group, there was a dramatic decrease in the accumulation of (123)I-IMZ in the superior and medial frontal cortex. In the group with intellectual impairment and focal epileptic discharge on EEG, the decrease in accumulation in the superior and medial frontal cortex was greater than that in the group without these findings.", 
    "238": "The present results suggest that disturbance of the GABAergic nervous system may contribute to the pathophysiology and aggravation of ASD, since the accumulation of (123)I-IMZ was decreased in the superior and medial frontal cortex, which is considered to be associated with inference of the thoughts, feelings, and intentions of others (Theory of Mind).", 
    "239": "Dopamine deficiency or dopamine dysfunction has been implicated as one of the factors involved in the pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome (RLS). Our objective is to determine the prevalence of primary RLS in patients taking neuroleptic drugs. One hundred patients taking neuroleptic drugs and 100 healthy age- and sex-matched controls were interviewed with the Cambridge-Hopkins diagnostic questionnaire for RLS. Patients with malignancy, end-stage renal disease, neuropathy, history of spinal cord diseases, pregnancy and Parkinson's disease were excluded. Only one patient had symptoms consistent with RLS (1%), similar to one patient in the control group. She was a 40 years old female with a diagnosis of depression. She started having RLS symptoms approximately four years after starting perphenazine. The symptoms persisted after the medications were discontinued but decreased in severity and frequency. Her serum ferritin level was 90.3 ng/ml. The prevalence of primary RLS is low in patients attending the out-patient clinic who are taking neuroleptic drugs. Other factors apart from dopaminergic dysfunction are likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of RLS.", 
    "240": "Depression in the context of bipolar disorder (BDd) is often misdiagnosed as unipolar disorder depression (UDd) leading to poor clinical outcomes for many bipolar sufferers. We examined neural circuitry supporting emotion regulation in females with either BDd or UDd as a first stage toward identifying biomarkers that may differentiate BDd from UDd.", 
    "241": "Fifty-seven females aged 18-45 years participated in this study: 23 with UDd, 18 with bipolar disorder type I depression (BDId) and 16 healthy females. During 3-T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the participants performed an emotional face n-back (EFNBACK) task, that is an n-back task with high (2-back) and low (0-back) memory load conditions flanked by two positive, negative or neutral face distracters. This paradigm examines executive control with emotional distracters-emotion regulation.", 
    "242": "High memory load with neutral face distracters elicited greater bilateral and left dorsal anterior midcingulate cortex (dAMCC) activity in UDd than in healthy and BDId females respectively, and greater bilateral putamen activity in both depressed groups versus healthy females. High memory load with happy face distracters elicited greater left putamen activity in UDd than in healthy females. Psychotropic medication was associated with greater putamen activity to these contrasts in UDd females.", 
    "243": "During high memory load with neutral face distracters, elevated dAMCC activity in UDd suggests abnormal recruitment of attentional control circuitry to maintain task performance, whereas elevated putamen activity unrelated to psychotropic medication in BDId females may suggest an attentional bias toward ambiguous neutral face distracters. Differential patterns of functional abnormalities in neural circuitry supporting attentional control during emotion regulation, especially in the dAMCC, is a promising neuroimaging measure to distinguish UDd from BDId in females.", 
    "244": "A series of resorcinaren-PAMAM dendrimers with benzodiazepines in the periphery were synthesized and their anticancer properties studied. The synthesized dendrimers showed potential anticancer activities, which were enhanced in the presence of a chloro-substituent in the second ring of the 5-aryl-1,4-benzodiazepine. The dendrimers were characterized by IR, (1)H and (13)C NMR, UV-vis absorption, electrospray (ES) and/or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometries."
