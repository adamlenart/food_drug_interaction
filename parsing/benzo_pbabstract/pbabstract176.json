    "0": "The efficacy of combined psychotherapy and benzodiazepine treatment for panic disorder is still unclear despite its widespread use. The present systematic review aims to examine its efficacy compared with either monotherapy alone.", 
    "1": "All randomised trials comparing combined psychotherapy and benzodiazepine for panic disorder with either therapy alone were identified by comprehensive electronic search on the Cochrane Registers, by checking references of relevant studies and of other reviews, and by contacting experts in the field. Two reviewers independently checked eligibility of trials, assessed quality of trials and extracted data from eligible trials using a standardized data extraction form. Our primary outcome was \"response\" defined by global judgement. Authors of the original trials were contacted for further unpublished data. Meta-analyses were undertaken synthesizing data from all relevant trials.", 
    "2": "Only two studies, which compared the combination with behaviour (exposure) therapy, met our eligibility criteria. Both studies had a 16-week intervention. Unpublished data were retrieved for one study. The relative risk for response for the combination was 1.25 (95%CI: 0.78 to 2.03) during acute phase treatment, 0.78 (0.45 to 1.35) at the end of treatment, and 0.62 (0.36 to 1.07) at 6-12 months follow-up. Some secondary outcomes hinted at superiority of the combination during acute phase treatment. One study was identified comparing the combination to benzodiazepine. The relative risk for response was 1.57 (0.83 to 2.98), 3.39 (1.03 to 11.21, statistically significant) and 2.31 (0.79 to 6.74) respectively. The superiority of the combination was observed on secondary outcomes at all the time points. No sub-group analyses were conducted due to the limited number of included trials.", 
    "3": "Unlike some narrative reviews in the literature, our systematic search established the paucity of high quality evidence for or against the combined psychotherapy plus benzodiazepine therapy for panic disorder. Based on limited available published and unpublished data, however, the combined therapy is probably to be recommended over benzodiazepine alone for panic disorder with agoraphobia. The combination might be superior to behaviour therapy alone during the acute phase, but afterwards this trend may be reversed. We know little from these trials about their adverse effects.", 
    "4": "The glutamate-ergic hypothesis of schizophrenia pathogenesis has been substantially expanded due to recent data on changes in glutamate metabolizing enzymes (GME) in the brain of patients with schizophrenia. Significant changes in the amounts of glutamate synthetase (GS), glutamate synthetase-like protein (GSLP), and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) have been found. Alterations in the cerebral metabolism of glutamate (together with disturbances in glutamate receptors and transporters) apparently play an important role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Glutamate dysmetabolism has been shown to be of systemic nature, i.e. the amounts of GME (GDH and GSLP) are elevated in platelets of patients with chronic schizophrenia, and these enzymes may be vital markers of glutamate system status. The amounts of GDH and GSLP were monitored in platelets of chronic patients during treatment with olanzapine, an atypical neuroleptic modulating glutamate concentration in the brain and blood of patients. GSLP amount can serve as a predictor of the duration of treatment to achieve a positive outcome. Further studies of GME in blood may result in elaboration of prognostically valuable biological tests not only for schizophrenia treatments, but also for other mental and nervous system diseases in which the glutamate system is substantially implicated.", 
    "5": "Humoral and cellular immunological parameters were studied in 59 schizophrenic patients and 38 healthy subjects. It was demonstrated that high level of circulating immune complexes is characteristic of the acute state (a relapse) of schizophrenia. The level of this parameter was higher in patients before treatment vs. healthy controls; after therapy with olanzapine this level decreased and did not differ from that of controls. The functional activity of immunocompetent cells (the phagocyte activity of neutrophiles and monocytes, the cytotoxic activity of natural killer lymphocytes, interleukin-2, and interleukin-10 production) did not depend on the clinical condition of the patients and the therapy and was significantly lower than that of controls both before and during the treatment. Attention should be paid to the fact that the level of IL-1beta production in schizophrenia patients did not differ from that of controls. After eight weeks of therapy the level of IL-1beta production increased significantly in all groups of patients and was significantly higher than that of controls during the whole observation period irrespectively of sex and patients' response to the therapy.", 
    "6": "Recently there has been concern regarding the use of flunitrazepam and other low-dose benzodiazepines in drug-facilitated sexual assault. These compounds are placed in drinks of unsuspecting victims and produce a sedative effect with anterorgrade amnesia. Chip-based microfluidic systems can provide a quick and disposable procedure for the detection of flunitrazepam and other nitrated benzodiazepines used in these crimes. This paper describes the application of indirect quenching of cyanine dye (Cy5) for detection of nitrated benzodiazepines. The separation is performed on a microfluidic device with a separation channel 8 cm long and 50 microm wide and utilizes indirect fluorescence detection with 635 nm laser excitation. The optimization of the separation using micellar electrokinetic chromatography with organic modifiers is described. A borate buffer containing 2.6 microM Cy5 dye, 15 mM sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and 20% methanol is used. Complete separation of four target drugs occurs in under 2 min with limits of detection in the low microg/ml range. Overall the method provides a rapid and simple analysis for the presence of nitrated benzodiazepines in beverages and other similar preparations.", 
    "7": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) has shown considerable potential as a clinical marker of neuroinflammation and tumour progression. [(11)C]DAA1106 ([(11)C]N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-acetamide) is a promising positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for imaging PBRs.", 
    "8": "A four-step synthetic route was devised to prepare DAA1123, the precursor for [(11)C]DAA1106. Two robust, high yielding methods for radiosynthesis based on [(11)C]-O-methylation of DAA1123 were developed and implemented on a nuclear interface methylation module, producing [(11)C]DAA1106 with up to 25% radiochemical yields at end-of-synthesis based on [(11)C]CH(3)I trapped. Evaluation of [(11)C]DAA1106 for in vivo imaging was performed in a rabbit model with microPET, and the presence of PBR receptor in the target organ was further corroborated by immunohistochemistry.", 
    "9": "The standard solution method produced 2.6-5.2 GBq (n=19) of [(11)C]DAA1106, whilst the captive solvent method produced 1.6-6.3 GBq (n=10) of [(11)C]DAA1106. Radiochemical purities obtained were 99% and specific radioactivity at end-of-synthesis was up to 200 GBq/micromol for both methods. Based on radiochemical product, shorter preparation times and simplicity of synthesis, the captive solvent method was chosen for routine productions of [(11)C]DAA1106. In vivo microPET [(11)C]DAA1106 scans of rabbit kidney demonstrated high levels of binding in the cortex. The subsequent introduction of nonradioactive DAA1106 (0.2 micromol) produced considerable displacement of the radioactive signal in this region. The presence of PBR in kidney cortex was further corroborated by immunohistochemistry.", 
    "10": "A robust, high yielding captive solvent method of [(11)C]DAA1106 production was developed which enabled efficacious in vivo imaging of PBR expressing tissues in an animal model.", 
    "11": "A definition of clinical remission in schizophrenia has recently been proposed. However, it is also known that neuropsychological (NP) impairments may be better predictors of functional outcomes than clinical symptoms. Understanding the relationship between clinical remission and cognitive improvement may be required in order to predict functional improvements, so we examined the development and convergence of clinical remission and neuropsychological improvements in a sample of patients with schizophrenia whose medication was switched to ziprasidone.", 
    "12": "One hundred eighty-four patients were switched from their previous treatment with risperidone, olanzapine, or conventional antipsychotics to open-label ziprasidone treatment. One hundred and thirty seven patients were not in remission at baseline and 40 met the clinical criteria for remission at study entry. We rated their symptoms with the PANSS at baseline and after 6 months of treatment. We performed an NP assessment and generated a composite score which was examined for improvements.", 
    "13": "Of the 184 cases, 48 (26.1% of the total sample) met the remission criteria at baseline. Of these cases, 41 (85%) sustained their remission at the 6-month follow-up. Of the remaining 136 cases, 33% developed remission by the 6-month follow-up. Thus, a total of 55% of the total sample were in remission at the 6-month endpoint. A comparable number of the patients, 34%, improved by 0.5 SD or more in their cognitive performance. Baseline NP performance was not associated with remission at baseline and did not predict achieving remission over time. Further, clinical remission was not correlated with concurrent NP improvements. However, 33 patients achieved clinical remission and improved by 0.5 SD in their NP performance.", 
    "14": "After a switch from previous treatment to open-label ziprasidone more than half of patients with schizophrenia experienced sustained clinical remission over 6 months and 32% of the patients achieving remission experienced a concurrent NP improvement. Later research will be required to determine which aspects of improvement (clinical remission and/or cognitive improvements) are required for functional improvements.", 
    "15": "Diverse cholinergic signaling mechanisms regulate the excitability of striatal principal neurons and modulate striatal-dependent behavior. These effects are mediated, in part, by action at muscarinic receptors (mAChR), subtypes of which exhibit distinct patterns of expression across striatal neuronal populations. Non-selective mAChR blockade within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been shown to disrupt operant responding for food and to inhibit food consumption. However, the specific receptor subtypes mediating these effects are not known. Thus, we evaluated effects of intra-NAc infusions of pirenzepine and methoctramine, mAChR antagonisits with distinct binding affinity profiles, on operant responding for sucrose reward under a progressive ratio (PR) reinforcement schedule. Moderate to high doses of methoctramine disrupted operant responding and reduced behavioral breakpoint. In contrast, pirenzepine failed to impact operant performance at any dose tested. Methoctramine failed to affect latencies to complete appetitive-consummatory response sequences or to impact measures of acoustic startle, suggesting that its' disruptive effects on operant behavior were not consequent to gross motor impairment. Since methoctramine has a greater affinity for M(2) receptors compared to pirenzepine, which has a greater relative affinity for M(1) and M(3) receptors, these findings suggest that M(2) mAChRs within the NAc regulate behavioral processes underling the acquisition of reward.", 
    "16": "Bipolar patients have increased prevalence rates of overweight and obesity compared with the general population. Recent increases in the use of atypical antipsychotics and combination therapies have led to growing concern about obesity and metabolic disturbances. We therefore evaluated weight change and its correlates during the treatment of acute mania in a closed-ward hospital setting.", 
    "17": "We evaluated weight change over 4 weeks in 179 consecutive patients with bipolar I disorder presenting with acute manic symptoms.", 
    "18": "Overall weight change was +2.7+/-3.0 kg (+4.6+/-5.2%). Whereas 24.6% of patients were obese at baseline, 36.3% were obese after 4 weeks. Duration of illness was correlated with weight change, but its effect was not robust. Baseline weight/BMI, sex, age of onset, and history of previous medication were not significantly correlated with weight changes. Patients prescribed olanzapine plus valproate showed the largest increase in weight (3.8+/-2.9 kg). Overall, patients on any kind of atypical antipsychotics showed greater weight gain than those on typical antipsychotics or without antipsychotics. Combination treatment with antipsychotics and mood stabilizer resulted in greater weight gain than monotherapy with an antipsychotic or mood stabilizer.", 
    "19": "The short-term assessment (4 weeks) of weight change and the lack of variables previously reported to be related to weight gain, such as number of depressive episodes, warrant caution in the interpretation of our results.", 
    "20": "Even during short period of acute treatment, bipolar patients showed significant weight gain and became obese in a closed-ward setting. Clinicians prescribing combination therapies should pay more attention to weight gain and obesity.", 
    "21": "The purpose of this study was to quantify the intestinal metabolism of midazolam, a CYP P450 substrate, usually used as a probe for the activity of the isoform CYP3A4/1 and to compare it with previous results obtained for other P450 substrates such as testosterone, dextromethorphan and bupropion, which show some specificities for different CYP isoforms. The aim was to shed light on the role of metabolism in the intestinal tissues and the relationship with efflux mechanisms, such as by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and the influence of metabolism on bioavailability.", 
    "22": "We used the improved everted rat gut sac model to study in vitro the absorption and metabolism of the different CYP isoenzyme probes: midazolam, testosterone, bupropion and dextromethorphan. This method enables drug metabolism to be studied during absorption, conditions which mimic the in vivo situation. The drugs and their metabolites were measured by LC-MS in the mucosal and serosal media and in the mucosal tissue, to give a complete picture of the transport and metabolism.", 
    "23": "Midazolam, as with the other CYP probes, was metabolized in everted gut sacs. The metabolites were detected in the same proportions in both the serosal and mucosal compartments for midazolam, testosterone and bupropion. In the case of dextromethorphan, the metabolite methoxymorphinan was found at a higher concentration in the mucosal compartment, indicating efflux from the cells. The transport of dextromethorphan and its metabolite was not modified in the presence of verapamil, a P-gp inhibitor, thus demonstrating that dextromethorphan and methoxymorphinan were not P-gp substrates.", 
    "24": "Given that the rat is a widely used species for pre-clinical studies, the everted gut sac model provides a useful tool to assess the role of metabolism during drug absorption by the intestine and is also capable of demonstrating P-glycoprotein mediated transport.", 
    "25": "Time-dependent inactivation of cytochrome P450s is typically a result of substrate bioactivation to form reactive species that subsequently alkylate the heme group, apoprotein, or both. The chemical identity of many reactive intermediates is generally proposed based on the products of trapping reactions with nucleophilic agents as only a few P450-drug adducts have been directly characterized. We describe the use of mass spectrometry to show that a single equivalent of raloxifene is bound to the intact P450 apoprotein. Furthermore, mass analysis of peptides following digestion with proteinase K revealed that the covalently bound drug is localized to residue Cys239. A mass shift of 471 Da to the intact protein and peptide, relative to control samples, indicated that time-dependent inactivation of P450 3A4 occurred through the raloxifene diquinone methide intermediately prior to nucleophilic attack of the sulfur of Cys239. Association between raloxifene adduction to P450 3A4 apoprotein and the observed time-dependent inactivation was further investigated with the use of cysteine-specific modifying reagents. When P450 3A4 was treated with iodoacetamide or N-(1-pyrene)iodoacetamide, which alkylated residue Cys239 exclusively, time-dependent inactivation of P450 3A4 by raloxifene was prevented. The change in protein mass of 471 Da combined with the protection from inactivation that occurred through pre-alkylation of Cys239 provided conclusive evidence that raloxifene-mediated P450 3A4 inactivation occurred through the bioactivation of raloxifene to the diquinone methide and subsequent alkylation of Cys239.", 
    "26": "To investigate the impact of age and co-treatment with other drugs on the serum concentrations of lamotrigine in children and adolescents.", 
    "27": "A review of routine serum concentration measurements of lamotrigine performed in our laboratory yielded a total of 744 serum samples from 296 subjects (110 males, 186 females, age: 2-19 years) suitable for statistical analysis. The primary outcome variable was the dose-corrected lamotrigine serum concentration, expressed as the lamotrigine concentration/dose (C/D) ratio. A linear mixed model that allowed multiple observations from the same patient was used to identify and quantify the effect of factors influencing the lamotrigine C/D ratio.", 
    "28": "According to the model, the lamotrigine C/D ratio decreases by 6% per year of age. Valproate and levetiracetam were found to raise the lamotrigine C/D ratio, whereas the following co-medications reduced it: carbamazepine, clobazam, fluoxetine, clonazepam and ethinyl estradiol. The effect of carbamazepine decreased with increasing age. No gender difference was detected.", 
    "29": "Age is an important factor with respect to the pharmacokinetics and the extent of drug interactions of lamotrigine in children and adolescents. In this population, older individuals will need higher doses than younger ones in order to achieve the same serum concentrations.", 
    "30": "Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are severe and do not respond well to available treatments. The development and validation of animal models of cognitive deficits characterizing schizophrenia are crucial for clarifying the underlying neuropathology and discovery of improved treatments for such deficits.", 
    "31": "We investigated whether single and repeated administrations of the psychotomimetic phencyclidine (PCP) disrupt performance in the five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), a test of attention and impulsivity. We also examined whether PCP-induced disruptions in this task are attenuated by atypical antipsychotic medications.", 
    "32": "A single injection of PCP (1.5-3 mg/kg, s.c., 30-min pre-injection time) had nonspecific response-depressing effects. Repeated PCP administration (2 mg/kg for two consecutive days followed by five consecutive days, s.c., 30-min pre-injection time) resulted in decreased accuracy, increased premature and timeout responding, and increased response latencies. The atypical antipsychotic medications clozapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and olanzapine and the typical antipsychotic medication haloperidol did not disrupt 5-CSRTT performance under baseline conditions except at high doses. The response depression induced by a single PCP administration was exacerbated by acute clozapine or risperidone and was unaffected by chronic clozapine. Importantly, chronic clozapine partially attenuated the performance disruptions induced by repeated PCP administration, significantly reducing both the accuracy impairment and the increase in premature responding.", 
    "33": "Disruptions in 5-CSRTT performance induced by repeated PCP administration are prevented by chronic clozapine treatment and may constitute a useful animal model of some cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.", 
    "34": "Quantification of growth in experimental F98 and C6 rat brain tumours was performed on 51 rat brains, 17 of which have been further assessed by 3D tumour reconstruction. Brains were cryosliced and radio-labelled with a ligand of the peripheral type benzodiazepine-receptor (pBR), (3)H-Pk11195 [(1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methyl-propylene)-3-isoquinoline-carboxamide)] by receptor autoradiography. Manually segmented and automatically registered tumours have been 3D-reconstructed for volumetric comparison on the basis of (3)H-Pk11195-based tumour recognition. Furthermore automatically computed areas of -300 microm inner (marginal) zone as well as 300 microm and 600 microm outer tumour space were quantified. These three different regions were transferred onto other adjacent slices that had been labelled by receptor autoradiography with the A(1) Adenosine receptor (A(1)AR)-ligand (3)H-CPFPX ((3)H-8-cyclopentyl-3-(3-fluorpropyl)-1-propylxanthine) for quantitative assessment of A(1)AR in the three different tumour zones. Hence, a method is described for quantifying various receptor protein systems in the tumour as well as in the marginal invasive zones around experimentally implanted rat brain tumours and their representation in the tumour microenvironment as well as in 3D space. Furthermore, a tool for automatically reading out radio-labelled rat brain slices from auto radiographic films was developed, reconstructed into a consistent 3D-tumour model and the zones around the tumour were visualized. A(1)AR expression was found to depend upon the tumour volume in C6 animals, but is independent on the time of tumour development. In F98 animals, a significant increase in A(1)AR receptor protein was found in the Peritumoural zone as a function of time of tumour development and tumour volume.", 
    "35": "Ingestion of anticholinergic medications is common in pediatrics. Toxicity may result in symptoms such as severe agitation requiring physical restraint. Physostigmine, an antidote for anticholinergic poisoning, could be useful in this situation. Many physicians are hesitant to use physostigmine after case series suggested its use in tricyclic antidepressant overdose was associated with asystole. This paper reviews the anticholinergic toxidrome and pathophysiology, recent literature on the efficacy and toxicity of physostigmine, and its dosing, indications, and contraindications.", 
    "36": "Recent articles suggest that toxicity associated with physostigmine consists mostly of seizures and cardiac arrhythmia, and occurs when used in the absence of anticholinergic symptoms. Despite potential complications, physostigmine has been shown to be useful in cases of confirmed anticholinergic poisoning by controlling agitation and reversing delirium, and appears to be safer and more effective than benzodiazepines in this situation.", 
    "37": "In the proper clinical situation such as pure anticholinergic overdose with severe symptoms, physostigmine can be beneficial. The potential for side effects is not insignificant, and the antidote should be used with caution in any patient with unknown ingestions or those with cardiac conduction defects. More research is needed, especially involving children, before we will fully understand the indications and toxicities associated with physostigmine.", 
    "38": "The zebrafish is an ideally suited vertebrate animal model for large-scale genetic screens and is emerging as a model organism in pharmacological and behavioral research. We investigated the effects of sedative hypnotics commonly used in humans on zebrafish locomotor activity and identified the corresponding genomic and receptor binding targets.", 
    "39": "We studied radioreceptor binding and behavioral responses to compounds with known sedative hypnotic properties representing multiple pharmacological classes. These included GABAergic hypnotics such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and baclofen; alpha-2 adrenergic agonists; and histaminergic H1 antagonists. An automated system was used to quantify behavioral effects. Zebrafish homologs of histamine receptor H1, gamma-amino-n-butyric acid type A (alpha-subunit), and gamma-amino-n-butyric acid type B (1 and 2) receptor genes were identified through translating queries of the zebrafish Zv4 database with human receptor protein sequences. A pilot screen of 154 N-ethyl-N-nitroso-urea-mutagenized F2 families was conducted with pentobarbital, flurazepam and mepyramine.", 
    "40": "Radioreceptor binding studies revealed high affinity binding sites for known gamma-amino-n-butyric acid type A, gamma-amino-n-butyric acid type B, and histaminergic ligands. Drug immersion of 5-7-day-old larvae reduced mobility and, in some cases, produced a complete state of unresponsive immobility similar to anesthesia. These effects were dose-dependent and rapidly reversible in water. As established in mammals, (R)-baclofen was more active behaviorally and had higher affinity in binding studies when compared with (S)-baclofen. In this model, (S)-baclofen only partially reduced activity at high dose and blocked (R)-baclofen behavioral hypnotic effects. Genomic sequences with high similarity to the corresponding pharmacological targets were identified, but no mutants were found in the pilot screen.", 
    "41": "These results demonstrate conservation of gene, protein and function for many established sedative hypnotic pathways. The results indicate feasibility of conducting large-scale pharmacogenomic screens to isolate novel proteins modulating susceptibility to hypnotic compounds in a vertebrate system.", 
    "42": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive death of cortical and spinal motor neurons, for which there is no effective treatment. Using a cell-based assay for compounds capable of preventing motor neuron cell death in vitro, a collection of approximately 40,000 low-molecular-weight compounds was screened to identify potential small-molecule therapeutics. We report the identification of cholest-4-en-3-one, oxime (TRO19622) as a potential drug candidate for the treatment of ALS. In vitro, TRO19622 promoted motor neuron survival in the absence of trophic support in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo, TRO19622 rescued motor neurons from axotomy-induced cell death in neonatal rats and promoted nerve regeneration following sciatic nerve crush in mice. In SOD1(G93A) transgenic mice, a model of familial ALS, TRO19622 treatment improved motor performance, delayed the onset of the clinical disease, and extended survival. TRO19622 bound directly to two components of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore: the voltage-dependent anion channel and the translocator protein 18 kDa (or peripheral benzodiazepine receptor), suggesting a potential mechanism for its neuroprotective activity. TRO19622 may have therapeutic potential for ALS and other motor neuron and neurodegenerative diseases.", 
    "43": "The effects of goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis) and kava kava (Piper methysticum) supplementation on human CYP3A activity were evaluated using midazolam (MDZ) as a phenotypic probe. Sixteen healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either goldenseal or kava kava for 14 days. Each supplementation phase was followed by a 30-day washout period. MDZ (8 mg, per os) was administered before and after each phase, and pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using standard non-compartmental methods. Comparisons of pre- and post-supplementation MDZ pharmacokinetic parameters revealed significant inhibition of CYP3A by goldenseal (AUC(0-infinity), 107.9+/-43.3 vs 175.3+/-74.8 ng x h/ml; Cl/F/kg, 1.26+/-0.59 vs 0.81+/-0.45 l/h/kg; T(1/2), 2.01+/-0.42 vs 3.15+/-1.12 h; Cmax, 50.6+/-26.9 vs 71.2+/-50.5 ng/ml). MDZ disposition was not affected by kava kava supplementation. These findings suggest that significant herb-drug interactions may result from the concomitant ingestion of goldenseal and CYP3A substrates.", 
    "44": "An advantage of using LC-MS(/MS) for in vitro CYP inhibition screening is that it does not require extensive sample preparation and chromatographic separation. Attention must be paid, however, to ion suppression effects on analytes caused by the test compound as well as endogenous compounds. In this study, we have shown the ion suppression of 1'-hydroxymidazolam (analyte) and dextrorphan (IS) by erythromycin, as an example, which may cause over- or underestimation of CYP3A4 inhibition. To avoid this kind of effect, we proposed to use a stable isotope-labeled substrate and determine labeled metabolites by using unlabeled authentic compounds of each metabolite. We showed that CYP3A4 activity was determined with high accuracy and precision by using stable isotope-labeled midazolam even in the presence of an ion suppressor at high concentrations in the samples. This method is useful not only for the CYP inhibition screening but also for testing drug candidates to predict changes in metabolite formation by the possible co-administered drugs.", 
    "45": "In the developing cerebellum, NMDA receptors promote the maturation of axonal terminals of inhibitory interneurons. We compared the effects of AMPA/kainate receptor agonists in cultured cerebellar cells from GAD65-eGFP mice. Both AMPA and kainate augmented granule cell survival without affecting interneurons. The action of kainate was blocked by an AMPA but not by a NMDA receptor antagonist, suggesting AMPA receptor involvement. AMPA and kainate increased the size of the GABAergic terminals and the action of kainate was insensitive to NMDA blockers. Whole cell recordings in granule neurons revealed that chronic treatment for 5 days with kainate as well as NMDA decreased AMPA receptor expression while interneuronal kainate receptors were depressed by kainate treatment. Acute kainate application increased mIPSCs frequency in both granule neurons and interneurons and this effect was only partially blocked by an AMPA receptor antagonist. In contrast to what was reported for NMDA, chronic treatment with kainate induced a significant decrease of the basal mIPSCs frequency but increased the acute action of kainate on mIPSCs. Direct recordings from presynaptic GABAergic terminals suggest that AMPA and kainate receptors are present in developing GABAergic terminals and their activation affects the size of GABAergic terminals and spontaneous GABA release.",

    "49": "Many older chronic users have come to rely and psychologically depend on benzodiazepines for their unique soothing properties, attributing to these medications characteristics that extend beyond an ordinary medication, i.e., affording control over daily stress, bringing tranquility, and even prolonging life. Most of the patients denied or minimized side effects and expressed resistance to taper or discontinuation, ranging from subtle reluctance to outright refusal and fear of being left suffering without these medications.",

    "51": "This study aimed to measure the rates of ongoing heroin abuse among patients on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) and sought to identify patient and treatment characteristics associated with poorer outcome. The study was carried out at an outpatient drug treatment clinic and included all patients who were on the MMT during a three month period in 2004. Treatment response was measured from analysis of opiate positive urine samples. Of the 440 patients, 63% were male and their mean age was 32 years (range 17 to 52 years). 163 patients (37%) had a comorbid psychiatric illness. The average methadone dose was 74 mg. On average, 71% of urine samples were opiate negative. Shorter time in treatment (less than 24 months), lower dose of methadone, cocaine abuse and intermittent benzodiazepine abuse were each found to be significantly associated with lower rates of opiate abstinence. Outcomes were not associated with gender, age and accessing counselling. Dual diagnosed patients tended to have higher rates of abstinence (p = 0.08). MMT clients who abuse cocaine and benzodiazepines are at increased risk of continuing opiate abuse. Higher doses of methadone might be necessary to prevent illicit opiate abuse.",

Male Wistar rats were induced to diabetes with streptozotocin and submitted to forced swimming test. Clonazepam was administered 24, 5 and 1 h before test. The animals were sacrificed by decapitation, and plasma and erythrocytes were separated, as well as hippocampus, cortex and striatum. Reactive species of thiobarbituric acid (TBARS) and total antioxidant reactivity (TAR) as well as antioxidant enzyme activities catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were evaluated. Results showed a significant increase of TBARS and a significant decrease of TAR in plasma from diabetic animals, which was altered by clonazepam. There were no effects of CAT and SOD activities in erythrocytes from tested animals. The results observed in hippocampus showed a significant increase of TBARS from diabetic rats, altered by clonazepam, and no one alteration was verified in TAR. The significant increase of TBARS and the significant decrease of TAR in cortex from diabetic rats were not altered by clonazepam administration. There were no alterations of TBARS and TAR in striatum from tested animals. Besides, clonazepam reverses the immobility in diabetic rats. Considering the action of clonazepam, it is suggested that it could be an alternative therapeutic for depression to diabetic patients, once it could give a protection against free radicals.", 
    "57": "Benzodiazepines, especially midazolam, are the most frequently used agents for gastrointestinal endoscopy worldwide. Among other parameters the quality of sedation is determined by patients' satisfaction assessed after endoscopy. This approach is misleading as the potent amnestic effect of midazolam conceals pain actually suffered during the endoscopic procedure involving distraction of the endoscopists from their actual tasks by audible reactions and defense movements. In this study, we eliminated the influence of patients' amnesia on the assessment of the quality of sedation and rather interviewed endoscopists and their assistant personnel about their experience with midazolam sedation. We replaced the mostly vague term 'compliance' by terms which unequivocally describe the reactions of the patient during an unpleasant endoscopy.",

The questionnaires were distributed to the participants - 115 endoscopists and their assistants - of a tutorial about sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy in three major Southern German cities.

Ninety-eight percent of the questioned physicians felt that patients have pain during endoscopy with midazolam+/-opioid, but do not remember later. Ninety-two percent reported that it happens that patients moan aloud because of pain and almost half of the endoscopists (48%) reported of screaming. The majority of the endoscopists (91%) reported fierce defense movements with midazolam or the need to hold the patient down on the examination couch because of fierce movements, respectively (75%). Seventy percent of the endoscopists wished to have the rooms for endoscopy preferably soundproof away from the waiting room and 93% wished for better sedative agents.",

    "62": "Proposed mechanisms of DO include the myogenic or neurogenic theory, and the autonomous bladder hypothesis. In rats, BOO produces premicturition contractions (PMCs) that are assumed to be a consequence of inappropriate non-micturition activity during the filling phase. Using pharmacology, we explored the cause of PMCs to provide new insights into DO in humans. BOO was created in female Wistar rats; 6 weeks after obstruction we evaluated them using conscious-filling cystometry. A specific AMPA receptor antagonist, 1-(4'-aminophenyl)- 3,5-dihydro-7,8-dimethoxy-4H-2,3-benzodiazepin-4-one (CFM-2) was administered intravenously (i.v.) (0.003-3 mg/kg) or intrathecally (i.t.) (0.01-10 microg).", 
    "63": "The i.v. administration of CFM-2 in rats with BOO significantly decreased the threshold pressure and micturition pressure. The most remarkable findings were that i.v. administration of CFM-2 in rats with BOO significantly and dose-dependently decreased the amplitude and number of PMCs. The highest dose of CFM-2 almost completely eliminated PMCs. The i.t. administration of CFM-2 had no significant effect on PMCs.", 
    "64": "AMPA receptors have never been suggested as a neural mechanism of bladder dysfunction associated with BOO. Although PMCs in rats with BOO have been assumed to be mainly of myogenic origin, PMCs were suppressed by the i.v. administration of CFM-2. Thus, we think that PMCs have neurogenic components that are linked with AMPA receptors. In the present study, i.v. but not i.t. administration of CFM-2 suppressed PMCs, suggesting peripheral and/or supraspinal sites of inhibitory action of CFM-2 on PMCs.",

CX516 is the first Ampakine to be studied for cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia. Stable schizophrenia patients treated with clozapine (n=52), olanzapine (n=40), or risperidone (n=13) were randomly assigned to add-on treatment with CX516 900 mg three times daily or placebo for 4 weeks. Subjects were assessed with a cognitive battery at baseline, week 4, and at 4-week follow-up. Clinical scales and safety monitoring were also performed. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in a composite cognitive score at week 4 for the intent-to-treat sample. Additional analyses examined change in symptom rating scores and examined drug effects on patients treated with clozapine separately from patients treated with either olanzapine or risperidone. A total of 105 patients were randomized and 95 (90%) completed the 4-week trial. Patients treated with CX516 did not differ from placebo in change from baseline on the composite cognitive score, or on any cognitive test at weeks 4 or 8. The between groups effect size at week 4 for the cognitive composite score was -0.19 for clozapine-treated patients and 0.24 for patients treated with olanzapine or risperidone. The placebo group improved more on the PANSS total score than the CX516 group; no other clinical rating differed between treatment groups. CX516 was associated with fatigue, insomnia and epigastric discomfort compared to placebo, but was generally well tolerated. CX516 was not effective for cognition or for symptoms of schizophrenia when added to clozapine, olanzapine, or risperidone.",

Multiple drug metabolizing deficiencies were suspected. Molecular analysis was performed for the CYP2 family of Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) drug metabolism isoenzymes by DNA typing CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 genes. A multiple deficiency in CYP2 drug metabolism was discovered. The patient was a double carrier of null alleles for CYP2D6, a carrier of a null allele for CYP2C19 and a carrier of a deficient allele for CYP2C9. These alleles were confirmed by Mendelian inheritance in her nuclear family, where her brother had a similar multigene CYP2 deficiency. The patient improved clinically with discontinuation of psychotropic medications, suggesting that much of her symptomatology was drug-induced. DNA typing for multigene CYP2 deficiencies is diagnostically useful in individuals with histories of multiple ADRs, which could be avoided by DNA-guided individualized prescription.",

    "71": "A review of US poison center data for 2004 showed over 48,000 exposures to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). A guideline that determines the conditions for emergency department referral and prehospital care could potentially optimize patient outcome, avoid unnecessary emergency department visits, reduce health care costs, and reduce life disruption for patients and caregivers. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create the guideline. Relevant articles were abstracted by a trained physician researcher. The first draft of the guideline was created by the lead author. The entire panel discussed and refined the guideline before distribution to secondary reviewers for comment. The panel then made changes based on the secondary review comments. The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate out-of-hospital triage and initial management of patients with a suspected ingestion of an SSRI by 1) describing the process by which an ingestion of an SSRI might be managed, 2) identifying the key decision elements in managing cases of SSRI ingestion, 3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and 4) identifying needs for research. This guideline applies to ingestion of immediate-release forms of SSRIs alone. Co-ingestion of additional substances might require different referral and management recommendations depending on their combined toxicities. This guideline is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions may be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. Recommendations are in chronological order of likely clinical use. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. 1) All patients with suicidal intent, intentional abuse, or in cases in which a malicious intent is suspected (e.g., child abuse or neglect) should be referred to an emergency department. This activity should be guided by local poison center procedures. In general, this should occur regardless of the dose reported (Grade D). 2) Any patient already experiencing any symptoms other than mild effects (mild effects include vomiting, somnolence [lightly sedated and arousable with speaking voice or light touch], mydriasis, or diaphoresis) should be transported to an emergency department. Transportation via ambulance should be considered based on the condition of the patient and the length of time it will take the patient to arrive at the emergency department (Grade D). 3) Asymptomatic patients or those with mild effects (defined above) following isolated unintentional acute SSRI ingestions of up to five times an initial adult therapeutic dose (i.e., citalopram 100 mg, escitalopram 50 mg, fluoxetine 100 mg, fluvoxamine 250 mg, paroxetine 100 mg, sertraline 250 mg) can be observed at home with instructions to call the poison center back if symptoms develop. For patients already on an SSRI, those with ingestion of up to five times their own single therapeutic dose can be observed at home with instructions to call the poison center back if symptoms develop (Grade D). 4) The poison center should consider making follow-up calls during the first 8 hours after ingestion, following its normal procedure. Consideration should be given to the time of day when home observation will take place. Observation during normal sleep hours might not reliably identify the onset of toxicity. Depending on local poison center policy, patients could be referred to an emergency department if the observation would take place during normal sleeping hours of the patient or caretaker (Grade D). 5) Do not induce emesis (Grade C). 6) The use of oral activated charcoal can be considered since the likelihood of SSRI-induced loss of consciousness or seizures is small. However, there are no data to suggest a specific clinical benefit. The routine use of out-of-hospital oral activated charcoal in patients with unintentional SSRI overdose cannot be advocated at this time (Grade C). 7) Use intravenous benzodiazepines for seizures and benzodiazepines and external cooling measures for hyperthermia (>104 degrees F [>40 degrees C]) for SSRI-induced serotonin syndrome. This should be done in consultation with and authorized by EMS medical direction, by a written treatment protocol or policy, or with direct medical oversight (Grade C).", 
    "72": "The treatment of sleep-related illness in older patients must be undertaken with an appreciation of the physiologic changes associated with aging. Insomnia is common among older people. When it occurs secondary to another medical condition, treatment of the underlying disorder is imperative. Benzodiazepines, although potentially effective, must be used with care and in conservative doses. Daytime sedation, a common side effect, may limit use of benzodiazepines. Newer non-benzodiazepine drugs appear to be promising. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder can be treated with clonazepam, levodopa-carbidopa or newer dopaminergic agents such as pramipexole. Sleep hygiene is important to patients with narcolepsy. Excessive daytime sleepiness can be treated with central stimulants; cataplexy may be improved with an antidepressant. Restless legs syndrome and periodic leg-movement disorder are treated with benzodiazepines or dopaminergic agents such as levodopa-carbidopa and, more recently, newer dopamine agonists. Treatment of obstructive sleep apnea includes weight reduction and proper sleep positioning (on one's side), but may frequently necessitate the use of a continuous positive air-pressure (CPAP) device. When used regularly, CPAP machines are very effective in reducing daytime fatigue and the sequelae of untreated obstructive sleep apnea.",

Benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants and lithium salts should be avoided during treatment with ECT. Ambulatory single ECT sessions with an interval of 3-4 weeks (maintenance-ECT) is recommended in drug-resistant depression. In Denmark, 5% of all patients admitted to psychiatric departments were treated with ECT; 18% of patients diagnosed with depression were given ECT. ECT is a safe and sometimes life-saving treatment.", 
    "74": "To establish a valid animal model of the effects of olfactory stimuli on anxiety, a series of experiments was conducted using rats in an open-field test. Throughout, effects of lavender oil were compared with the effects of chlordiazepoxide (CDP), as a reference anxiolytic with well-known effects on open-field behaviour. Rats were exposed to lavender oil (0.1-1.0 ml) for 30 min (Experiment 1) or 1h (Experiment 2) prior to open-field test and in the open field or injected with CDP (10 mg/kg i.p.). CDP had predicted effects on behaviour, and the higher doses of lavender oil had some effects on behaviour similar to those of CDP. In Experiment 3, various combinations of pre-exposure times and amounts of lavender oil were used. With sufficient exposure time and quantity of lavender the same effects were obtained as in Experiment 2. Experiment 4 demonstrated that these behavioural effects of lavender could be obtained following pre-exposure, even if no oil was present in the open-field test. In Experiments 2-4, lavender oil increased immobility. Together, these experiments suggest that lavender oil does have anxiolytic effects in the open field, but that a sedative effect can also occur at the highest doses.", 
    "75": "The objective of this study was to evaluate a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) approach for predicting the plasma concentration-time curves expected after intravenous administration of candidate drugs to rodents. The predictions were based on a small number of properties that were either calculated based on the structure of the candidate drug (octanol:water partition coefficient, ionization constant(s)) or obtained from the typical high-throughput screens implemented in the early drug discovery phases (fraction unbound in plasma and hepatic intrinsic clearance). The model was tested comparing the predicted and the observed pharmacokinetics of 45 molecules. This dataset included six known drugs and 39 drug candidates from different discovery programs, so that the performance of the model could be evaluated in a real discovery case scenario. The plasma concentration-time curves were predicted with good accuracy, the pharmacokinetic parameters being on average two- to three-fold of actual values. Multivariate analysis was used for identifying the candidate properties which were likely associated to biased predictions. The application of this approach was found useful for the prioritization of the in vivo pharmacokinetics screens and the design of the first-time-in-animal studies.", 
    "76": "Rapid neurotransmission is mediated through a superfamily of Cys-loop receptors that includes the nicotinic acetylcholine (nAChR), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)), serotonin (5-HT(3)) and glycine receptors. A class of ligands, including galanthamine, local anesthetics and certain toxins, interact with nAChRs non-competitively. Suggested modes of action include blockade of the ion channel, modulation from undefined extracellular sites, stabilization of desensitized states, and association with annular or boundary lipid. Alignment of mammalian Cys-loop receptors shows aromatic residues, found in the acetylcholine or ligand-binding pocket of nAChRs, are conserved in all subunit interfaces of neuronal nAChRs, including those that are not formed by alpha subunits on the principal side of the transmitter binding site. The amino-terminal domain containing the ligand recognition site is homologous to the soluble acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) from mollusks, an established structural and functional surrogate. We assess ligand specificity and employ X-ray crystallography with AChBP to demonstrate ligand interactions at subunit interfaces lacking vicinal cysteines (i.e. the non-alpha subunit interfaces in nAChRs). Non-competitive nicotinic ligands bind AChBP with high affinity (K(d) 0.015-6 microM). We mutated the vicinal cysteine residues in loop C of AChBP to mimic the non-alpha subunit interfaces of neuronal nAChRs and other Cys loop receptors. Classical nicotinic agonists show a 10-40-fold reduction in binding affinity, whereas binding of ligands known to be non-competitive are not affected. X-ray structures of cocaine and galanthamine bound to AChBP (1.8 A and 2.9 A resolution, respectively) reveal interactions deep within the subunit interface and the absence of a contact surface with the tip of loop C. Hence, in addition to channel blocking, non-competitive interactions with heteromeric neuronal nAChR appear to occur at the non-alpha subunit interface, a site presumed to be similar to that of modulating benzodiazepines on GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "77": "In this work, six amino acid derived (L-leucinol, L-leucine, L-isoleucinol, L-isoleucine, L-valinol, and L-valine) polymeric chiral surfactants with carboxylate and sulfate head groups that were recently synthesized in our laboratory [30, 33, 35] are compared for the simultaneous enantioseparation of several groups of structurally similar analytes under neutral and basic pH conditions. The physicochemical properties of the monomers and polymers of both classes of sulfated and carboxylated surfactants are compared. In addition, cryogenic high-resolution electron microscopy showed tubular structures with distinct order of the tubes of 50-100 nm width. A Plackett-Burmann experimental design is used to study the factors that influence the chiral resolution and analysis time of ten structurally related phenylethylamines (PEAs). It is observed that increasing the number of hydroxy groups on the benzene ring of the PEAs resulted in deterioration of enantioseparation using any of the six polymeric surfactants. For all three classes of PEAs, polysodium N-undecenoxycarbonyl-L-amino acidate (poly-L-SUCAA)-type surfactants provided enhanced resolution compared to that of polysodium N-undecenoxycarbonyl-L-amino acid sulfates (poly-L-SUCAASS). Several classes of basic and neutral chiral compounds (e.g., beta-blockers benzoin derivatives, PTH-amino acids, and benzodiazepines) also provided improved chiral separations with poly-L-SUCAA. Among the poly-L-SUCAAs, polysodium N-undecenoxycarbonyl-L-isoleucine sulfate (poly--SUCL) exhibited overall the best enantioseparation capability for the investigated basic and neutral compounds, while among the poly-L-SUCAASs, polysodium N-undecenoxycarbonyl-L-isoleucine sulfate (poly-L-SUCILS), and polysodium N-undecenoxycarbonyl-L-valine sulfate (poly-L-SUCVS) proved to be equally effective for enantioseparation. This work clearly demonstrates that variation in the head group of polymeric alkenoxy amino acid surfactants has a significant effect on chiral separations.", 
    "78": "The interaction of alcoholic extracts of Magnum, Aroma and wild genotype hops with drugs that lower the activity of the central nervous system (CNS) was studied in mice. Hops drying and preparation of extracts were performed according to standard pharmacological procedures for preparing total alcoholic extracts of medicinal plants, i.e. in a ratio of one part dry herbs to two parts of 70% alcohol, with evaporation to dryness so that the extracts no longer contained any alcohol. The mice received four doses intraperitoneally (i.p.) of 0.5% aqueous solutions of the above-mentioned extracts, which were dissolved in warm physiological solution to make up a 0.5% aqueous solution, 24, 16, 4 and 0.5 hours before pentobarbital (40 mg/kg) or diazepam (3 mg/kg) administration. The hypnotic action of pentobarbital and the effect of diazepam on the coordination of movements (rotating rod method) were measured. It was found that hops extracts influenced the action of the investigated drugs, and that the extracts of the Magnum and Aroma genotypes suppressed the hypnotic action of pentobarbital and diazepam. Tert-butanolic extracts also suppressed the action of these two drugs but to a lesser extent, whereas wild hops extracts did not exert any significant effects compared to controls.",

    "84": "Administration of abdominal radiotherapy results in small intestinal motor dysfunction. We have developed a rat radiation enteritis model that, after exposure in vivo, shows high-amplitude, long-duration (HALD) pressure waves in ex vivo ileal segments. These resemble in vivo dysmotility where giant contractions migrate both antegradely and retrogradely. Mediation of these motor patterns is unclear, although enteric neural components are implicated. After the induction of acute radiation enteritis in vivo, ileal segments were isolated and arterially perfused. TTX, hexamethonium, atropine, or the selective muscarinic antagonists pirenzepine (M(1)), methoctramine (M(2)), and 1,1-dimethyl-4-diphenylacetoxypiperidinium iodide (4-DAMP; M(3)) were added to the perfusate. The baseline mean rate per minute per channel of HALD pressure waves was 0.35 +/- 0.047. This was significantly reduced by TTX (83.3%, P < 0.01), hexamethonium (90.3%, P < 0.03), and atropine (98.4%, P < 0.01). The HALD pressure wave mean rate per minute per channel was significantly reduced by pirenzepine (81.1%, P < 0.03), methoctramine (96.8%, P < 0.001), and 4-DAMP (93.1%, P < 0.03) compared with predrug baseline data. As an indicator of normal motility patterns, the frequency of low-amplitude, short-duration pressure waves was also assessed. The mean rate per minute per channel of 5.15 +/- 0.98 was significantly increased by TTX (19%, P < 0.05) but significantly reduced by pirenzepine (35.1%, P < 0.02) and methoctramine (75%, P < 0.0003). However, the rate of small-amplitude pressure waves was not affected by hexamethonium, atropine, or the M(3) antagonist 4-DAMP. The data indicate a role for neuronal mechanisms and the specific involvement of cholinergic receptors in generating dysmotility in acute radiation enteritis. The effect of selective M(3) receptor antagonism suggests that M(3) receptors may provide specific therapeutic targets in acute radiation enteritis.",

SDS, a common pseudostationary phase used in MEKC, was also used for comparison. The van't Hoff relationship was applied to compute the temperature dependence of the MEKC retention factors of the test solutes to estimate the enthalpy, entropy, and the Gibbs free energy. Nonlinear van't Hoff plots were obtained with the majority of benzodiazepines indicating that the thermodynamic parameters were temperature-dependent in all surfactant systems for these solutes. In contrast, all alkyl phenyl ketones resulted in linear van't Hoff plots.",

    "103": "Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is a miniaturized and solvent-free sample preparation technique for chromatographic-spectrometric analysis by which the analytes are extracted from a gaseous or liquid sample by absorption in, or adsorption on, a thin polymer coating fixed to the solid surface of a fiber, inside an injection needle or inside a capillary. In this paper, the present state of practical performance and of applications of SPME to the analysis of blood, urine, oral fluid and hair in clinical and forensic toxicology is reviewed. The commercial coatings for fibers or needles have not essentially changed for many years, but there are interesting laboratory developments, such as conductive polypyrrole coatings for electrochemically controlled SPME of anions or cations and coatings with restricted-access properties for direct extraction from whole blood or immunoaffinity SPME. In-tube SPME uses segments of commercial gas chromatography (GC) capillaries for highly efficient extraction by repeated aspiration-ejection cycles of the liquid sample. It can be easily automated in combination with liquid chromatography but, as it is very sensitive to capillary plugging, it requires completely homogeneous liquid samples. In contrast, fiber-based SPME has not yet been performed automatically in combination with high-performance liquid chromatography. The headspace extractions on fibers or needles (solid-phase dynamic extraction) combined with GC methods are the most advantageous versions of SPME because of very pure extracts and the availability of automatic samplers. Surprisingly, substances with quite high boiling points, such as tricyclic antidepressants or phenothiazines, can be measured by headspace SPME from aqueous samples. The applicability and sensitivity of SPME was essentially extended by in-sample or on-fiber derivatization. The different modes of SPME were applied to analysis of solvents and inhalation narcotics, amphetamines, cocaine and metabolites, cannabinoids, methadone and other opioids, fatty acid ethyl esters as alcohol markers, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, benzodiazepines, various other therapeutic drugs, pesticides, chemical warfare agents, cyanide, sulfide and metal ions. In general, SPME is routinely used in optimized methods for specific analytes. However, it was shown that it also has some capacity for a general screening by direct immersion into urine samples and for pesticides and other semivolatile substance in the headspace mode.",

There were 29,069 pediatric prescriptions for antipsychotic medications; 2949 were for olanzapine (576 children, 510 providers). These data were linked to the Area Resource File, Provider Enrollment File, and Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes. Patient and provider locations were geocoded by ZIP code. Mixed logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the probability of a child's being prescribed olanzapine given certain community, patient, and provider characteristics.

    "108": "In subjects with schizophrenia, impairments in working memory are associated with dysfunction of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). This dysfunction appears to be due, at least in part, to abnormalities in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibitory circuitry. To test the hypothesis that altered GABA-mediated circuitry in the DLPFC of subjects with schizophrenia reflects expression changes of genes that encode selective presynaptic and postsynaptic components of GABA neurotransmission, we conducted a systematic expression analysis of GABA-related transcripts in the DLPFC of 14 pairs of schizophrenia and age-, sex- and post-mortem interval-matched control subjects using a customized DNA microarray with enhanced sensitivity and specificity. Subjects with schizophrenia exhibited expression deficits in GABA-related transcripts encoding (1) presynaptic regulators of GABA neurotransmission (67 kDa isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD(67)) and GABA transporter 1), (2) neuropeptides (somatostatin (SST), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and cholecystokinin (CCK)) and (3) GABA(A) receptor subunits (alpha1, alpha4, beta3, gamma2 and delta). Real-time qPCR and/or in situ hybridization confirmed the deficits for six representative transcripts tested in the same pairs and in an extended cohort, respectively. In contrast, GAD(67), SST and alpha1 subunit mRNA levels, as assessed by in situ hybridization, were not altered in the DLPFC of monkeys chronically exposed to antipsychotic medications. These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with alterations in inhibitory inputs from SST/NPY-containing and CCK-containing subpopulations of GABA neurons and in the signaling via certain GABA(A) receptors that mediate synaptic (phasic) or extrasynaptic (tonic) inhibition. In concert with previous findings, these data suggest that working memory dysfunction in schizophrenia is mediated by altered GABA neurotransmission in certain DLPFC microcircuits.",

    "110": "Male rats received a 10-min infusion of 4 mg kg(-1) of morphine, combined with a continuous infusion of the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) inhibitor GF120918 or vehicle, or 40 mg kg(-1) morphine alone. Unbound extracellular fluid (ECF) concentrations obtained by intracerebral microdialysis and total blood concentrations were analysed using a population modelling approach.", 
    "111": "Blood pharmacokinetics of morphine was best described with a three-compartment model and was not influenced by GF120918. Non-linear distribution kinetics in brain ECF was observed with increasing dose. A one compartment distribution model was developed, with separate expressions for passive diffusion, active saturable influx and active efflux by Pgp. The passive diffusion rate constant was 0.0014 min(-1). The active efflux rate constant decreased from 0.0195 min(-1) to 0.0113 min(-1) in the presence of GF120918. The active influx was insensitive to GF120918 and had a maximum transport (N(max)/V(ecf)) of 0.66 ng min(-1) ml(-1) and was saturated at low concentrations of morphine (C(50)=9.9 ng ml(-1)).", 
    "112": "Brain distribution of morphine is determined by three factors: limited passive diffusion; active efflux, reduced by 42% by Pgp inhibition; low capacity active uptake. This implies blood concentration-dependency and sensitivity to drug-drug interactions. These factors should be taken into account in further investigations on PK-PD correlations of morphine.", 
    "113": "Benzodiazepines are known to act by enhancing the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptor agonists. Positive modulation by benzodiazepines is typically ascribed to upregulation of agonist binding affinity but their effect on gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptor gating remain unclear. In this work, we have used the ultrafast application system to examine the impact of flurazepam and zolpidem on recombinant alpha1beta2gamma2 gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptors. As expected, both drugs strongly enhanced currents evoked by low [gamma-aminobutyric acid]. These compounds, however, also affected currents elicited by saturating agonist concentration. In particular, flurazepam and zolpidem reduced current amplitudes and slowed down the recovery process in paired-pulse experiments. Moreover, flurazepam accelerated the current rise time and zolpidem enhanced the rate and extent of desensitization. We propose that flurazepam and zolpidem modulate gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptors by strong enhancement of agonist binding with a superimposed limited effect on the receptor gating.", 
    "114": "Oral bioavailability of some drugs is substantially lower in cynomolgus monkeys than in various other species, including humans. In the present study, midazolam was used as a model drug to investigate the reason for the lower bioavailability in these monkeys. The bioavailability of midazolam after oral administration was minimal in monkeys and rats, being only 2.1 and 1.1%, respectively. In monkeys, this low bioavailability could not be explained simply in terms of a hepatic first-pass effect. To examine the roles of intestinal metabolism and transport, we evaluated apical-to-basal and basal-to-apical transport of midazolam, and the formation of metabolites in small intestinal tissues using an Ussing-type chamber. The values of mucosal extraction ratio were estimated to be 0.97, 0.93, and 0.89 during apical-to-basal transport in the upper, middle, and lower small intestine of monkeys, respectively, whereas the corresponding values for rats were close to zero, indicating that extensive metabolism of midazolam occurs, particularly in the upper region of the small intestine in monkeys, but not rats. Interestingly, formation of the metabolites was much greater during transport in the apical-to-basal direction than in the basal-to-apical direction, and this could be well explained by a mathematical model based on the assumption that extensive metabolism is associated with the uptake process of midazolam from the apical cell surface. Thus, we conclude that an asymmetric distribution of metabolic activity in the small intestine, leading to extensive metabolism during uptake from the apical cell surface, accounts for the minimal oral bioavailability of midazolam in cynomolgus monkeys.",

Fifty-three adult chronic users of hypnotics were randomly assigned to an 8-week hypnotic taper program, used alone or combined with a self-help CBT. Weekly hypnotic use decreased in both conditions, from a nearly nightly use at baseline to less than once a week at posttreatment. Nightly dosage (in lorazepam equivalent) decreased from 1.67 mg to 0.12 mg. Participants who received CBT improved their sleep efficiency by 8%, whereas those who did not remained stable. Total wake time decreased by 52 min among CBT participants and increased by 13 min among those receiving the taper schedule alone. Total sleep time remained stable throughout withdrawal in both CBT and taper conditions. The present findings suggest that a systematic withdrawal schedule might be sufficient in helping chronic users stop their hypnotic medication. The addition of a self-help treatment focusing on insomnia, a readily available and cost-effective alternative to individual psychotherapy, produced greater sleep improvement.",

Corticosteroids and benzodiazepines were not associated significantly with an increased risk of delirium on any given day. Analysis by patient using generalized estimating equation (GEE) models showed an increased risk of delirium on any day of follow-up associated with opioid exposure in univariate analysis (OR of 1.70; P<.0001). The association remained significant after adjustment for corticosteroid, benzodiazepine, and antipsychotic exposure using GEE regressions (OR of 1.37; P=.0033).

    "124": "Sedative agents are used to facilitate sexual assault due to their ability to render the victim passive, submissive and unable to resist. The primary pharmacological effect of the benzodiazepine tetrazepam is muscle relaxation, whereas the benzodiazepine diazepam acts on the central nervous system (CNS) exerting mainly sedation effects. Therefore, contrary to tetrazepam, diazepam is an often-abused drug, which can potentially be used as a date-rape drug. In this study, we describe the detection of low amounts of diazepam in Myolastan (Sanofi-Synthelabo S.A., Brussels, Belgium) and Epsipam (Will-Pharma, Wavre, Belgium) 50 mg tablet preparations by LC-MS-MS, GC-FID and HPLC-DAD. Considering the important forensic implication of this finding, a study was conducted with volunteers receiving a single or repeated dosage of Myolastan. Urine, hair and preserved oral fluid samples were analysed using a previously described sensitive and specific LC-MS-MS detection method allowing for the simultaneous quantification of tetrazepam, diazepam, nordiazepam, oxazepam and temazepam. This study demonstrates that diazepam can be observed in urine samples even after a single dose of Myolastan. In addition, maintaining therapy for 1 week results in the detection of both diazepam and nordiazepam in urine samples and of diazepam in the first hair segment. Importantly, comparing urine and hair samples after a single intake of diazepam versus the single and 1 week administration of Myolastan shows that the possible metabolic conversion of tetrazepam to diazepam is a more plausible explanation for the detection of diazepam in biological samples after the intake of Myolastan. As such, these results reveal that the presence of diazepam and/or nordiazepam in biological samples from alleged drug-facilitated assault cases should be interpreted with care.",

We report that environmental enrichment in adult amblyopic rats restored normal visual acuity and ocular dominance.

    "126": "Alcohol is one of the main causes of traffic accidents worldwide. Its use decreases significantly the driving ability of an individual increasing in this way the possibilities of their involvement in motor-vehicle accidents. The above possibilities are increased when a psychoactive substance has been taken in combination with alcohol due to their synergistic effect. The Laboratory of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology of the University of Athens is authorized to perform the toxicological investigation of traffic accidents that happen in the southern part of Greece. The objective of the present study was to identify the prevalence of alcohol and other psychoactive substances among drivers involved in road traffic accidents in Greece during the period 1998-2004. Alcohol was detected in the blood of about 37% of the drivers involved in traffic accident during the years 1998-2000. The detection of alcohol was lower (29%) in the years 2001-2004. Cannabis, benzodiazepines, opiates, and cocaine were found in 4%, 4%, 4% and 1% of the total number of cases, respectively. The above values were compared with those of a previous study concerning the period 1995-1997 and the reasons for the reduction of the number of alcohol-related traffic accidents during the last years are discussed.", 
    "127": "This preliminary study compares the benzodiazepine results for 10 post-mortem scalp hair samples using a classical solid-phase extraction (SPE) and a molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE) system. The hair samples selected for testing were from drug-related deaths where a positive benzodiazepine blood result was obtained. Samples were decontaminated with 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, distilled water and dichloromethane, incubated overnight in methanol/25% aqueous ammonium hydroxide (20:1), extracted by SPE or MISPE and subsequently analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). Both extraction methods detected diazepam, nordiazepam, oxazepam, temazepam and nitrazepam in the samples. Diazepam was detected in a greater number of samples using MISPE due to both its lower limit of detection (LOD) and higher extraction recovery as a result of excellent molecular recognition of the template (diazepam) imparted by the imprinting process. The selective recognition of two diazepam analogues, nordiazepam and oxazepam, was demonstrated using MISPE since they were also detected in a greater number of samples. In contrast, another diazepam analogue, temazepam, was detected in a greater number of samples using SPE since the LOD using this extraction was lower than with MISPE. Nitrazepam was detected in one sample using both extraction methods. Overall the MISPE and SPE hair results were in good qualitative agreement. For the samples, where both extraction methods detected nordiazepam, temazepam and oxazepam, the concentrations were always higher for SPE. This is probably due to the MIP procedure producing extracts with fewer matrix interferences than the extracts produced using the classical SPE method. MISPE could be used as a complementary method to classical SPE for the analysis of benzodiazepine positive hair samples collected from chronic users.",

Since then, through courses in the United States and abroad, well over a thousand plastic surgeons have been taught the technique. Ketamine, by itself, ablates sensory input of pain at the thalamic level but has been associated with hallucinations, bad dreams, and other untoward effects. These can be prevented by the use of benzodiazepines, which \"bracket\" the use of ketamine. If the patient is sedated and awakens under the influence of these agents, there is no adverse ketamine effect. Specific techniques and adjunct agents are described.",

The hypothesis was that midazolam AUC would not change by more than 2-fold (consistent with no more than weak inhibition) when midazolam + aprepitant was compared with midazolam alone. An AUC geometric mean ratio (midazolam + aprepitant/midazolam) with 90% confidence interval upper bound < or =2.0 (an increase in midazolam felt to be of modest clinical significance in the highly monitored perioperative period) was prespecified.

Here we evaluate the reproductive toxicity of cis-permethrin in adult male ICR mice that were orally administered cis-permethrin (0, 35, or 70 mg/kg d) for 6 wk. Caudal epididymal sperm count and sperm motility in the treated groups were statistically reduced in a dose-dependent manner. Testicular testosterone production and plasma testosterone concentration were significantly and dose-dependently decreased with an increase in LH, and a significant regression was observed between testosterone levels and cis-permethrin residues in individual mice testes after exposure. However, no significant changes were observed in body weight, reproductive organ absolute and relative weights, sperm morphology, and plasma FSH concentration after cis-permethrin treatment. Moreover, cis-permethrin exposure significantly diminished the testicular mitochondrial mRNA expression levels of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), and cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage (P450scc) and enzyme and protein expression levels of StAR and P450scc. At the electron microscopic level, mitochondrial membrane damage was found in Leydig cells of the exposed mouse testis. Our results suggest that the insecticide permethrin may cause mitochondrial membrane impairment in Leydig cells and disrupt testosterone biosynthesis by diminishing the delivery of cholesterol into the mitochondria and decreasing the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone in the cells, thus reducing subsequent testosterone production.",

Comparison of the periods preceding thermal stimulation (anticipation to pain-anticipation to warm) revealed activity principally in the ACC, the contralateral anterior insular cortex and the ipsilateral S2/posterior insula.

    "140": "Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that anxiolytic effects are observed after chronic administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. In contrast, acute treatment may increase signs of anxiety. The present study examined the effects of acute and chronic administration of fluoxetine on a physiological measure of anxiety, stress-induced hyperthermia, in rats and mice using radiotelemetry to record core temperature and locomotor activity and ethologically relevant stressors to evoke the hyperthermic response. In both species, the benzodiazepine agonist chlordiazepoxide reduced stress-induced hyperthermia at doses (5 mg/kg i.p. rat, 10 mg/kg p.o. mouse) that had no significant effect on locomotor activity. Similarly, in both species, chronic (21 days) treatment with fluoxetine attenuated the hyperthermic response without significantly affecting locomotor activity. However, acute fluoxetine elicited species-specific effects. Thus in mice, stress-induced hyperthermia and activity were unaffected by fluoxetine (20 mg/kg p.o.) consistent with a lack of anxiolytic or anxiogenic activity. In contrast, in rats, fluoxetine (10 mg/kg i.p.) caused a significant baseline hypothermia in the absence of stress, confounding further interpretation. In conclusion, stress-induced hyperthermia in mice was unaffected by acute treatment and significantly reduced by chronic treatment with fluoxetine. However, in rats chronic administration of fluoxetine significantly reduced stress-induced hyperthermia while the effects of acute treatment were confounded by a decrease in body temperature in the absence of stress. Together, these observations support the view that chronic administration of fluoxetine is anxiolytic; however, the stress-induced hyperthermia assay does not reveal anxiogenic effects of acute administration of fluoxetine in rats or mice.",

The algorithm was applied in 54 of 59 cases (applicability rate, 92%). The reasons for the non-application of the algorithm were as follows: the need to add a benzodiazepine to an antidepressant in 4 cases and the need to choose alprazolam despite the depression being moderate in severity, in order to obtain a rapid onset action and reduce anxiety in a patient with short prognosis. Nineteen of the 55 patients dropped out within a week of initiation of treatment based on the algorithm. Delirium was the most frequent reason for dropout.

Quantification was performed at 240 nm with mefenamic acid (6 ng/microL) as the internal standard. DSC-18 Supelco cartridges provided high absolute recoveries (81-115%). The developed method was fully validated in terms of selectivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, stability, and sensitivity. Repeatability (n = 8) and between-day precision (n = 8) revealed RSD <12%. Recoveries from biological samples ranged from 81.2 to 115%. The detection limit of the method was calculated as 3.3-10.2 ng in blood plasma and 2.6-12.6 ng in urine for 20 microL injection volume. The method was applied to spiked biological matrices. Moreover, the method was applied to real samples of urine after an oral administration.", 
    "147": "The characterization of the first selective orally active and brain-penetrant beta3-adrenoceptor agonist, SR58611A (amibegron), has opened new possibilities for exploring the involvement of this receptor in stress-related disorders. By using a battery of tests measuring a wide range of anxiety-related behaviors in rodents, including the mouse defense test battery, the elevated plus-maze, social interaction, stress-induced hyperthermia, four-plate, and punished drinking tests, we demonstrated for the first time that the stimulation of the beta3 receptor by SR58611A resulted in robust anxiolytic-like effects, with minimal active doses ranging from 0.3 to 10 mg/kg p.o., depending on the procedure. These effects paralleled those obtained with the prototypical benzodiazepine anxiolytic diazepam or chlordiazepoxide. Moreover, when SR58611A was tested in acute or chronic models of depression in rodents, such as the forced-swimming and the chronic mild stress tests, it produced antidepressant-like effects, which were comparable in terms of the magnitude of the effects to those of the antidepressant fluoxetine or imipramine. Supporting these behavioral data, SR58611A modified spontaneous sleep parameters in a manner comparable to that observed with fluoxetine. Importantly, SR58611A was devoid of side effects related to cognition (as shown in the Morris water maze and object recognition tasks), motor activity (in the rotarod), alcohol interaction, or physical dependence. Antagonism studies using pharmacological tools targeting a variety of neurotransmitters involved in anxiety and depression and the use of mice lacking the beta3 adrenoceptor suggested that these effects of SR58611A are mediated by beta3 adrenoceptors. Taken as a whole, these findings indicate that the pharmacological stimulation of beta3 adrenoceptors may represent an innovative approach for the treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders.", 
    "148": "Severe hypoglycemia constitutes a medical emergency, involving seizures, coma and death. We hypothesized that seizures, during limited substrate availability, aggravate hypoglycemia-induced brain damage. Using immature isolated, intact hippocampi and frontal neocortical blocks subjected to low glucose perfusion, we characterized hypoglycemic (neuroglycopenic) seizures in vitro during transient hypoglycemia and their effects on synaptic transmission and glycogen content. Hippocampal hypoglycemic seizures were always followed by an irreversible reduction (>60% loss) in synaptic transmission and were occasionally accompanied by spreading depression-like events. Hypoglycemic seizures occurred more frequently with decreasing \"hypoglycemic\" extracellular glucose concentrations. In contrast, no hypoglycemic seizures were generated in the neocortex during transient hypoglycemia, and the reduction of synaptic transmission was reversible (<60% loss). Hypoglycemic seizures in the hippocampus were abolished by NMDA and non-NMDA antagonists. The anticonvulsant, midazolam, but neither phenytoin nor valproate, also abolished hypoglycemic seizures. Non-glycolytic, oxidative substrates attenuated, but did not abolish, hypoglycemic seizure activity and were unable to support synaptic transmission, even in the presence of the adenosine (A1) antagonist, DPCPX. Complete prevention of hypoglycemic seizures always led to the maintenance of synaptic transmission. A quantitative glycogen assay demonstrated that hypoglycemic seizures, in vitro, during hypoglycemia deplete hippocampal glycogen. These data suggest that suppressing seizures during hypoglycemia may decrease subsequent neuronal damage and dysfunction.",

    "154": "Status epilepticus is a frequent neurologic emergency that is refractory to benzodiazepines and phenytoin in 60% to 70% of cases. Patients commonly require management in an intensive care unit incorporating aggressive treatment with intravenous anaesthetics. Treatment guidelines commonly comment on initial pharmacologic management in detail, as they can refer to data from randomised controlled trials. In contrast, recommendations for the management of refractory status epilepticus often are sparse, as they rely on data from retrospective or uncontrolled prospective studies only. Since status epilepticus is refractory in every third patient, a critical analysis of the available data and a review focussing on the further management of this condition are urgently needed. The Koenigstein Team, a panel of expert epileptologists and neuropediatricians, discussed at its 31(st) meeting in March 2006 the clinical and experimental aspects and implicit prognostic variables of refractory status epilepticus. Here we present the results of that discussion and state recommendations from a neurologic and neuropediatric perspective for current und future management of refractory status epilepticus.", 
    "155": "[(11)C]PK11195 is used in positron emission tomography (PET) studies for imaging brain inflammation in vivo as it binds to the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) expressed by reactive glia and macrophages. However, features of the cellular reaction required to induce a positive [(11)C]PK11195 signal are not well characterized. We performed [(11)C]PK11195 PET and autoradiography in rats after transient focal cerebral ischemia. We determined [(3)H]PK11195 binding and PBR expression in brain tissue and examined the lesion with several markers. [(11)C]PK11195 standard uptake value increased at day 4 and grew further at day 7 within the ischemic core. Accordingly, ex vivo [(3)H]PK11195 binding increased at day 4, and increases further at day 7. The PET signal also augmented in peripheral regions, but to a lesser extent than in the core. Binding in the region surrounding infarction was supported by [(11)C]PK11195 autoradiography at day 7 showing that the radioactive signal extended beyond the infarcted core. Enhanced binding was preceded by increases in PBR mRNA expression in the ipsilateral hemisphere, and a 18-kDa band corresponding to PBR protein was detected. Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor immunohistochemistry showed subsets of ameboid microglia/macrophages within the infarcted core showing a distinctive strong PBR expression from day 4. These cells were often located surrounding microhemorrhages. Reactive astrocytes forming a rim surrounding infarction at day 7 also showed some PBR immunostaining. These results show cellular heterogeneity in the level of PBR expression, supporting that PBR is not a simple marker of inflammation, and that the extent of [(11)C]PK11195 binding depends on intrinsic features of the inflammatory cells.", 
    "156": "The rational use of pharmacological treatment in generalized anxiety disorders is still a matter of debate due to the uncertainties concerning the nature, diagnostic criteria and target-symptoms of this frequent and potentially invalidating disorder. If benzodiazepines may still be prescribed for a limited amount of time (i.e. 6 to 12 weeks) due to the fluctuating nature of generalized anxiety, the chronic evolution of this disorder in most patients often justifies the long-term prescription of serotoninergic (5-HT) or dual-action (5HT-NA) antidepressants and sometimes of 5HT-la partial agonists like buspirone. Imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant was the first to demonstrate its efficacy in carefully selected patients; however, due to the side-effects of this molecule recent guidelines based on controlled clinical trials, suggest to use either serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs) or venlafaxine as a first-line treatment of generalized anxiety disorders. Because of its pharmacological profile buspirone remains however a useful option in patients with cognitive or addictive problems, especially alcoholics. If most SSRIs have demonstrated efficacy over placebo, head to head comparisons remain limited except for escitalopram which appear better tolerated than parox\u00e9tine in this indication. More recently, an anticonvulsant, pregabaline also demonstrated its efficacy in several clinical trials but the symptomatic profile of generalized anxiety patients likely to respond to this GABA analog compared to other psychotropic treatments remain to be established. The traditional use of other psychotropic agents such as hydroxyzine, an H1 histaminergic receptor antagonist, is only supported by limited scientific data; this is also the case of sedative typical antipsychotics which benefit/risk ratio should be carefully evaluated before being prescribed to generalized anxiety patients resistant to other psychotropic agents. However, the possible use of atypical antipsychotics with a better tolerance profile than the typical ones in this indication is presently under investigation in several countries. At last it is important to realize that most clinical trials in this field only include patients with non-comorbid generalized anxiety and that their conclusion may not always be generalizable to most psychiatric patients who are usually characterized by a high rate of comorbidity. In this population the indication of specific pharmacological treatments should rely on a careful evaluation of the patients drug treatment history, of the duration, evolution and functional consequences of their symptoms and of the nature of their possible comorbidity. The treatment of resistant generalized anxiety disorders remains a question for future research but the use of imipramine or sedative antipsychotics could be an option when other treatments have failed to induce any improvement.", 
    "157": "Consumption rates of anxiolytic drugs, and especially of benzodiazepines, remain very high in France compared to other Western countries, whereas clinical guidelines limit their indications to short term treatments and only for some precise anxiety disorders. Recent epidemiologic surveys in the community indicated that more than 15% of people used once or more an anxiolytic drug in the past year. The issue of chronic treatments is particularly crucial because of their poor benefit/risk ratio in most anxiety disorders (limited efficacy, cognitive side effects, withdrawal and dependence problems). To address this important public health issue, and knowing that, in France, benzodiazepines are prescribed mainly by general physicians, our aims were to explore psychiatric diagnoses in GP's patients with chronic use of anxiolytic benzodiazepines. We included 4 425 patients consuming such drugs regularly for six months or more, and assessed their anxiety and depression symptoms through various clinical scales (Hospital Anxiety and Depressive scale - HAD, Clinical Global Impression scale - CGI, Sheehan Disability Scale - SDS, Cognitive Dependence to Benzodiazepines scale - CDB) and with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for DSM IV criteria. Only 2.2% of the subjects had neither anxious nor depressive symptoms as indicated by low scores on both subscores (less than 8) of the HAD scale, used as a screener. Nearly three quarters of the 4,257 subjects (73.2%), had CGI scores of at least 5 (markedly ill to extremely ill). Social and familial disability was also high in more than 40% of the sample (marked to extreme disruption according to SDS scores). About half of the sample had CDB scores suggesting a benzodiazepine dependence. According to the MINI, 85.1% of the patients had at least one current DSM IV diagnosis of affective disorder. The most frequent diagnoses were major depressive episode (60%), generalized anxiety disorder (61.2%), and panic disorder (22.5%). An anxiety and depressive comorbidity wad found in 41.9% of the subjects. Some methodological limitations must be taken into account in the discussion of our results, and especially the fact that the included patients were not supposed to be totally representative of all patients consuming anxiolytic benzodiazepines in general practice. However, the size of our sample is sufficiently large to limit possible biases in patient selection. The main result of this study is that a great majority of the patients had significant symptomatology, in particular major depressive episodes and generalized anxiety disorder, often with marked severity and disability. These data are in line with the knowledge of a lack of efficacy of benzodiazepines in depressive and most anxiety disorders, despite long term treatment. They also confirm the current guidelines which recommend prescribing serotoninergic antidepressants, and not benzodiazepines, when long term treatments are needed for severe and chronic affective disorders. This epidemiologic study leads to the conclusion that a specific and attentive diagnostic assessment should be done in all patients receiving benzodiazepines for more than three months, in order to purpose in many cases other long term therapeutic strategies.", 
    "158": "The use of organophosphorus pesticides results in toxicity risk to non-target organisms. Organophosphorus compounds share a common mode of action, exerting their toxic effects primarily via acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition. Consequently, acetylcholine accumulates in the synaptic clefts of muscles and nerves, leading to overstimulation of cholinergic receptors. Acute cholinergic crisis immediately follows exposure to organophosphate and includes signs and symptoms resulting from hyperstimulation of central and peripheral muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. The current view of the treatment of organophosphate poisoning includes three strategies, i.e. the use of an anticholinergic drug (e.g., atropine), cholinesterase-reactivating agents (e.g., oximes) and anticonvulsant drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines). Oximes, as a part of antidotal therapy, ensure the recovery of phosphylated enzymes via a process denoted as reactivation of inhibited AChE. However, both experimental results and clinical findings have demonstrated that different oximes are not equally effective against poisonings caused by structurally different organophosphorus compounds. Therefore, antidotal characteristics of conventionally used oximes can be evaluated regarding how close the certain substance is to the theoretical concept of the universal oxime. Pralidoxime (PAM-2), trimedoxime (TMB-4), obidoxime (L\u00fcH-6), HI-6 and HL\u00f6-7 have all been demonstrated to be very effective in experimental poisonings with sarin and VX. TMB-4 and L\u00fcH-6 may reactivate tabun-inhibited AChE, whereas HI-6 possesses the ability to reactivate the soman-inhibited enzyme. An oxime HL\u00f6-7 seems to be an efficient reactivator of AChE inhibited by any of the four organophosphorus warfare agents. According to the available literature, the oximes L\u00fcH-6 and TMB-4, although relatively toxic, are the most potent to induce reactivation of AChE inhibited by the majority of organophosphorus pesticides. Since there are no reports of controlled clinical trials on the use of TMB-4 in human organophosphate pesticide poisoning, L\u00fcH-6 may be a better option.",

This paper proposes an oxazepam detection method based on its hydrolysis and cyclization--a reaction catalysed by cerium (IV) in an ortho-phosphoric acid-containing medium--to form 2-chloro-9(10H)-acridinone, a strongly fluorescent molecule. The variables involved in the hydrolysis and cyclization stages were optimised. Oxazepam was detectable in the 5-900 ng mL(-1) range, with a detection limit of 4.15 ng mL(-1) for k=3. The method was successfully used for the determination of oxazepam in urine samples collected at different times after the oral administration of Valium and Tranxilium.",

This facilitates adequate depth of anaesthesia, reduction in need of analgesic dosage, early extubation and transfer from Intensive Care Unit. We compared two volatile anaesthetic agents sevoflurane and isoflurane in terms of haemodynamic effects, amount of analgesic needed during surgery, quantity of agent needed for maintenance of anaesthesia and postoperative recovery in 40 patients undergoing OPCAB surgery. Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl, midazolam and thiopentone, and vecuronium was used for muscle relaxation. An Octopus stabiliser was used and coronary anastomosis was performed using internal mammary artery and saphenous vein grafts. Routine monitoring was performed. The depth of anaesthesia was monitored using Bispectral index monitor. The inspired/expired concentration of anaesthetic agents to maintain the desired BIS and the amount of volatile anaesthetic agent needed was also noted. The amount of analgesic used intraoperatively was noted in both the groups. The 'time of awakening' defined as eye opening on verbal commands, and time of extubation were noted. There were no differences in haemodynamic parameters, depth of anaesthesia, and quantity of agent needed, but patients in isoflurane group required more intraoperative analgesics than sevoflurane group. Time of awakening (48+/-13 vs 114 +/- 21 mins; P < 0.001) and subsequent extubation (124 +/- 25 vs 177 +/- 36 mins, P<0.001) was earlier in sevoflurane group than isoflurane group. There was no evidence of perioperative myocardial infarction in both the groups. We conclude that sevoflurane and isoflurane can both be safely used in OPCAB surgery, but the awakening and extubation times are significantly less with sevoflurane.",

This polymorphic form (form III) was obtained during DSC experiments after the exothermic recrystallization of the melt of form I. The crystal unit cell dimensions for form III were determined from diffractometer methods.

    "166": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) are upregulated on activated microglia and are, thereby, biomarkers of cellular inflammation in brain. We recently developed two PET ligands with an aryloxyanilide structure to image PBRs and now evaluate the kinetics of these radiotracers in monkey to determine whether they are suitable to explore in human. Baseline and receptor-blocking scans were performed with [(11)C]PBR01 and [(18)F]PBR06 in conjunction with serial measurements of the arterial plasma concentration of parent radiotracer separated from radiometabolite. We used brain and plasma data with compartmental modeling to calculate regional brain distribution volume, which is equal to the ratio at equilibrium of the concentration of radioligand in brain to that of plasma. The distribution volume of [(11)C]PBR01 was inaccurately estimated in the baseline scans, possibly because of the short half-life of (11)C or the presence of radiometabolite in brain. In contrast, the distribution volume of [(18)F]PBR06 was stably determined within 200 min of scanning, and nondisplaceable uptake was only approximately 10% of total brain uptake. [(18)F]PBR06 is promising for use in human because brain activity could be quantified with standard compartmental models and showed higher ratios ( approximately 10:1) of specific to nonspecific uptake. A critical factor for human use will be whether the tracer has adequately fast wash out from brain relative to the half-life of the radionuclide to obtain stable values of distribution volume.", 
    "167": "The objective of this work is to check whether the input from the mossy cells to the inner molecular layer is necessary for the integration and maturation of the newly generated granule cells of the dentate gyrus (DG) in mice, and if after status epilepticus the sprouting of the mossy fibers can substitute for this projection. Newly generated cells were labeled by administration of 5-bromo-deoxyuridine either before or after pilocarpine administration. The neuronal loss in the hippocampus after administration of pilocarpine combined with scopolamine and diazepam seemed restricted to the hilar mossy cells. The maturation of the granule cells was studied using immunohistochemistry for calretinin and NeuN in combination with detection of 5-bromo-deoxyuridine. The sprouting of the mossy fibers was detected using Timm staining for zinc-rich boutons. In normal conditions, granule cells took about 2 weeks to lose the immature marker calretinin. After the loss of the mossy cells, newly generated granule cells remained expressing calretinin for more than a month, until the sprouting of the mossy fibers substituted for the projection of the mossy cells in the inner molecular layer of the DG. Therefore, a proper pattern of connectivity is necessary for the normal development and integration of newly generated granule cells in the adult brain. In a changed environment they cannot adapt transforming in other cell types; simply they are unable to mature. The sprouting of the mossy fibers, although aberrant and a probable source of epileptic activity, may be important for the correct physiology of the granule cells, restoring a likeness of normality in their connective environment. The survival of granule cells incorporated as mature neurons was increased after pilocarpine when compared with normal conditions. Thus, it is likely that the reorganization of the circuitry after the loss of the mossy cells facilitates the survival and incorporation of the newly generated granule cells.",
