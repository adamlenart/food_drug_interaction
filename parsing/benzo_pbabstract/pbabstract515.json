    "0": "Alcohol consumption and drinking habits among Finnish doctors were studied as part of a survey of stress and burnout. A questionnaire containing 99 questions or groups of questions was sent to all 3496 practising doctors aged under 66 randomly selected from the registry of the Finnish Medical Association. Altogether 2671 doctors (76%) responded; this sample was representative of the Finnish medical profession. The average weekly consumption of alcohol during the past year and various aspects of drinking behaviour were assessed, and the presence or absence of symptoms and diseases often encountered among heavy drinkers and addicts was determined. The data were analysed separately for men and women, for those aged less than or equal to 40 and greater than 40, and for the men with high and low alcohol consumption and with high and low scores on the index of drinking habits. Selected variables related to work, stress, and coping were correlated with alcohol consumption and drinking behaviour. The median consumption of alcohol among male doctors was 4876 g (6.2 litres) and among female doctors 2226 g (2.8 litres) of absolute alcohol per person per year and was higher in those aged over 40. Beer was most commonly drunk by men and wine by women. Increased alcohol consumption was associated with older age, disappointment with career, heavy smoking, use of benzodiazepines, stress and burnout symptoms, suicidal thoughts, general dissatisfaction, and diseases related to alcohol. Drinking habits were heavier among doctors working in community health centres, those taking long sick leaves, younger doctors disappointed with their careers or the atmosphere at work, and older doctors immersed in their work. Alcohol consumption among doctors seems to be higher than that of the general population in Finland, and heavy drinking seems to be associated with stress and burnout.", 
    "1": "Ten patients with partial epilepsy and five healthy controls had positron emission tomography (PET) of the brain after intravenous administration of the 11C-labelled benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor ligand 'Ro-15 1788'. In all ten patients BZ receptor binding was significantly lower in the epileptic focus than in the contralateral homotopic reference region and the remaining neocortex. No asymmetries in BZ receptor binding were observed between homotopic reference regions in the controls or the non-epileptic regions of patients. These results demonstrate the potential of the BZ receptor as a biochemical marker for display of epileptic foci by PET, and also strengthen the hypothesis that inhibitory mechanisms are disturbed in the epileptic focus.", 
    "2": "A reliable and sensitive capillary gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method was developed for the detection and determination of diazepam and its major metabolite, N-desmethyldiazepam, in human material. Medazepam served as the internal standard. Quantitative determination was achieved using mass fragmentography with selected ions of m/z 256 for diazepam and m/z 242 for N-desmethyldiazepam and medazepam. The limit of detection was 1 ng/g and the recoveries were 98.54 +/- 3.95% for diazepam and 98.66 +/- 6.48% for N-desmethyldiazepam. The calibration graph was linear over the concentration range from 1.0 ng/g to 1.0 microgram/g for diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam. Using this method, trace amounts of diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam were detected in the tissues of an autopsied individual.", 
    "3": "The effects of oxotremorine and AF102B (cis-2-methylspiro-(1,3-oxathiolane-5,3')-quinuclidine), a novel M1-selective muscarinic agonist, on acetylcholine (ACh) and dopamine (DA) release from superfused rat hippocampal and striatal synaptosomes were investigated. Synaptosomes that had been prelabeled with [3H]choline or [3H]DA were depolarized by high K+. Oxotremorine and AF102B decreased the K+-evoked [3H]ACh release from hippocampal synaptosomes and increased the K+-evoked [3H]DA release from striatal synaptosomes. The dose-response curves showed that AF102B was far less potent than oxotremorine at the hippocampal presynaptic muscarinic receptors (autoreceptors). On the other hand, AF102B was more potent than oxotremorine at the muscarinic receptors on the striatal dopaminergic terminals (heteroreceptors). Pirenzepine, a selective M1 antagonist, counteracted the effects of oxotremorine on [3H]DA release more potently than it did the effects of oxotremorine on [3H]ACh release. Our results suggest that AF102B and pirenzepine discriminate pharmacologically between muscarinic autoreceptors and heteroreceptors.", 
    "4": "Behavioral effects of the benzodiazepine agonist quazepam were compared with those of lorazepam in squirrel monkeys responding under a fixed-interval schedule of food presentation with a superimposed fixed-ratio schedule of response-produced shock. Low and intermediate i.v. doses of quazepam (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) and lorazepam (0.03-0.3 mg/kg) increased rates of suppressed responding, yet the maximal increases in rate were less after quazepam than after lorazepam. Higher doses of both drugs tended to increase responding less or decrease it and, with quazepam, frequent sleep was observed for 2-3 days afterwards. The dose-response curves for quazepam and lorazepam were shifted to the right following i.v. pretreatment with the benzodiazepine antagonists Ro 15-1788 (0.18-3.0 mg/kg) or AHR-11797 (1.0-5.6 mg/kg); in this regard, AHR-11797 was less potent than Ro 15-1788. Although the effects of quazepam on suppressed responding are likely due to actions at benzodiazepine receptors, these effects may be influenced by or reflect a more prominent sleep-promoting action of the drug.", 
    "5": "CPP (3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl-propyl-1-phosphonic acid), a rigid analog of AP7 (2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate), previously shown to be a selective antagonist of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor (IC50 = 209 nM) has been reported to be exceptionally active (IC50 = 430 pM) at benzodiazepine binding sites. Re-examination of CPP, and the rigid AP5 analog, CGS 19755 (cis-4-phosphonomethyl-2-piperidine carboxylic acid; 0.001-10,000 nM), showed that, as previously reported, neither compound affected the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam. These compounds are thus selective NMDA receptor antagonists.", 
    "6": "Etoxadrol-meta-isothiocyanate (2S,4S,6S-2-ethyl-2-(3-isothiocyanatophenyl)-2-piperidyl)1,3-dioxolane, 4a) has been synthesized and characterized as an irreversible ligand for the phencyclidine (PCP)-binding site. It is the first chiral electrophilic affinity ligand for this site to have been described. This affinity ligand is based upon etoxadrol, a 1,3-dioxolane known to have PCP-like effects in vivo and in vitro. Etoxadrol-meta-isothiocyanate was found to be four-five times more potent in vitro than metaphit (1-[1-(3- isothiocyanatophenyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine), the only previously known electrophilic affinity ligand for the PCP-binding site. The binding was shown to be highly enantioselective for etoxadrol-meta-isothiocyanate (4a). The 2R,4R,6R-enantiomer of 4a was essentially inactive. The ability of the 2S,4S,6S-enantiomer (4a) to interact with the benzodiazepine, muscarinic, and mu opioid receptor systems was also examined, and it was found not to interact with these receptor systems. It seems likely that 4a will prove to be a valuable tool in the study of structure and function of the PCP-binding site.", 
    "7": "The effects of diazepam microinjected into the subcerebellar nuclei, the lateral vestibular nucleus (LVN), the red nucleus and the substantia nigra were investigated using the crossed extensor reflex (CER) model in chloralose-anesthetized rats. Microinjections of diazepam at doses of 1 and 25 ng/animal into the left LVN, ipsilateral to the testing muscle, produced a dose-related CER depression, while injections of diazepam at a dose of up to 100 ng/animal into the right LVN and into other regions tested produced little effect. The CER depression produced by diazepam could be clearly reversed by a subsequent intravenous administration of Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine antagonist. Electrical lesions of the left LVN decreased the amplitude of CER in otherwise untreated rats. Intravenously administered diazepam at a dose of 0.01 or 0.05 mg/kg decreased spontaneous firing of LVN neurons. Iontophoretically applied GABA or flurazepam, a water-soluble benzodiazepine, decreased the spontaneous firing of LVN neurons. Depressant actions on neuronal activity in the LVN produced by both diazepam and flurazepam were clearly antagonized by intravenously administered Ro 15-1788, while it failed to reverse the depression produced by GABA. These findings indicate that the LVN is a major site of the CER depressant action of benzodiazepines and a possible mechanism of action is discussed.", 
    "8": "The role of hepatic energy deficits in the pathogenesis of anesthetic hepatotoxicity is suggested by the involvement of hypoxia in various animal models and by the ability of anesthetics to inhibit mitochondrial oxidations. We have been studying anesthetic effects on hepatocellular energy metabolism using suspensions of intact hepatocytes freshly isolated from phenobarbital-treated or untreated rats (+PB or -PB cells, respectively), an experimental system that is metabolically complete yet also biochemically homogeneous and accessible. In the present work, diazepam, lidocaine, thiopental, and enflurane, as well as the combination of thiopental and enflurane, were studied at concentrations similar to those achieved in vivo. Thiopental increased cellular oxygen consumption rate (VO2) in both +PB and -PB cells significantly, as did aminopyrine, a test substrate for PB-inducible cytochrome P450 activity. Diazepam increased VO2 only in +PB cells, as did enflurane, whereas lidocaine did not increase VO2 in either +PB or -PB cells. The combination of thiopental and enflurane significantly decreased VO2 in -PB cells but increased it in +PB cells. The higher VO2 in +PB cells compared to -PB cells, seen with all drugs tested (except lidocaine), was eliminated by prior addition of the P450 inhibitor metyrapone. Starting from steady states of oxygen metabolism, with VO2 offset by O2 supply from an overlying gas phase and PO2 stabilized at 24 mm Hg, aminopyrine significantly lowered extracellular PO2, increased lactate production, and decreased high energy phosphate levels within 10 minutes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "The influence of oral (p.o.) administration of kappa-(U-50488, tifluadom) and mu- (morphine, DAGO) opioid substances on gastric emptying of liquids and solids in a standard canned dog food meal was evaluated using a double-radiolabeled technique in dogs fitted with gastric cannulas. One hour after feeding, 28.6% +/- 3.6% (mean +/- SD) of the solid phase and 27.1% +/- 8.6% of the liquid phase of the meal had been emptied. Both U-50488 and tifluadom given orally (0.01-0.1 mg/kg) significantly increased (p less than 0.05) the 1-h emptying of the solid phase of the meal by 23.1%-49.6%. In contrast, both drugs significantly reduced emptying of liquids. These effects were not reproduced when similar doses were given intravenously. Oral administration of morphine or DAGO (0.01-0.1 mg/kg) did not affect gastric emptying, whereas an inhibited emptying of solids was observed for morphine at a higher dose (1 mg/kg p.o.). At a dose of 100 micrograms/kg i.v. both naloxone and MR 2266 (0.1 mg/kg) abolished the effects of orally administered U-50488 on gastric emptying of solids and liquids. It is concluded that kappa- but not mu-agonists act locally to alter gastric emptying of a standard meal in dogs, having opposite effects on solid and liquid phases. A selective local stimulation of kappa mucosal or submucosal receptors of the gastroduodenal area may explain such effects.", 
    "10": "1. The possibility that the anticonvulsant activity of the benzodiazepines, diazepam and clobazam, is related to changes in EEG parameters, particularly beta activity, was investigated in amygdaloid kindled rats. 2. The effects of diazepam (1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 mumols/kg), administered intraperitoneally (i.p.), clobazam (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 mumols/kg, i.p.) or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) on the cortical EEG of amygdaloid kindled rats were quantitated for 15 min using computerized period amplitude analysis. Immediately afterwards, the amygdala was stimulated and the after-discharge duration (AD) and the seizures stage (SS) were determined. 3. The equivalent percentage time (EPT) of the diazepam-treated group was decreased in the theta band (4-8 Hz) and increased in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and first six beta (12-36 Hz) bands. The mean peak amplitude (MPA) was increased in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and all seven beta bands (12-40 Hz). Clobazam increased the EPT and MPA in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and all seven beta (12-40 Hz) bands. The MPA was also increased by clobazam in the theta (4-8 Hz) band. 4. Diazepam reduced both the AD and SS of the kindled seizures at doses of 4, 8 and 16 mumols/kg, whereas clobazam was anticonvulsant at doses of 16 and 32 mumols/kg. The reduction in both AD and SS correlated with increases in the EPT and MPA in the first beta (12-16 Hz) band in the diazepam-treated group and in the first four beta (12-28 Hz) bands in the clobazam-treated group.", 
    "11": "Effect of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug 480156-S on liver drug-metabolizing activity was studied in rats, and its effect was compared with that of cimetidine. Cytochrome P-450-dependent 7-alkoxycoumarin O-dealkylase activity was not affected by a single administration of 480156-S, but the activity, especially the O-demethylase but not the O-depropylase, was suppressed dose-dependently by multiple administrations. Pretreatment of rats with phenobarbital caused a diminution of the inhibitory action of 480156-S. Treatment of rats with cimetidine resulted in a marked decrease in the activity, although it recovered 24 hr later. After the pretreatment of animals with 480156-S or reference drugs, the pharmacological action of diazepam was determined using muscle relaxation and inhibitions of electroshock-induced convulsion and pentetrazole-induced clonic convulsion as the indicators. Prolonged pharmacological activity of diazepam was observed when liver drug-metabolizing activity was lowered by the pretreatment. On the other hand, pentobarbital-induced anesthesia was prolonged by the pretreatment of rats with cimetidine, but the anesthesia was not modified by the administration of 480156-S. These results suggest the inhibitory action of 480156-S on a specific form(s) of P-450 isozyme.", 
    "12": "Propofol was compared to midazolam with regard to its quality as a sedative in regional anesthesia. 81 patients undergoing varicose-vein stripping under epidural anesthesia were divided into two groups: 39 were given propofol and 42 were given midazolam. Both groups were then subdivided into 3 subgroups. 30 min after epidural block, a bolus of propofol 1 mg/kg or midazolam 0.03 mg/kg was given followed by infusion of equipotent solutions: propofol 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 mg/kg/h or midazolam 0.03, 0.045, 0.06 mg/kg/h. Continuous registration of blood pressure, respiratory rate, and end-expiratory pCO2 was carried out and blood gas analysis was performed every 30 min.", 
    "13": "Clinically unimportant changes of circulatory and respiratory parameters were seen. Blood gas analyses showed hypercapnia greater than 50 mmHg in some patients. Brief apnea occurred after bolus propofol in 7.7% of cases and pain during injection in 66.6%. Restlessness: propofol 28.2%, midazolam 9.5%. Upper airway obstruction: propofol 30.8%, midazolam 57.1%. Recovery time after infusion ranged from 130 s with propofol to 26 min with midazolam. Postoperative evaluation included the following questions and responses: Sedation pleasant? propofol 97.5%, midazolam 100%. Sleep during surgery? propofol 94.8%, midazolam 83.5%. Prolonged tiredness? propofol 25.6%, midazolam 69%. Postoperative nausea? propofol 38.5%, midazolam 14.2%. Vomiting? propofol 17.9%, midazolam 11.9%. Our study showed that propofol is highly suitable as a sedative for regional anesthesia in spite of injection pain and frequent postoperative nausea. It is superior to midazolam because of the significantly shorter recovery time, providing improved control-lability and reduced posthypnotic sleep.", 
    "14": "1. The effects of carbachol on hippocampal pyramidal neurones were studied in tissue slices in vitro with intracellular microelectrodes, employing current clamp and voltage clamp methods. 2. The calcium-dependent potassium current, IAHP, and the voltage-dependent potassium current, IM, were both reversibly blocked by the application of carbachol (5-10 microM). 3. Carbachol (1-10 microM) induced a steady inward current under circumstances in which both IAHP and IM were inactive. This inward current was sometimes difficult to reverse upon carbachol wash-out, an effect possibly related to receptor desensitization. 4. The depolarizing effect of carbachol was reversed by 0.1 microM-atropine, and exhibited an apparent dissociation coefficient of 1.2 microM for carbachol and 18 nM for pirenzepine, indicating that it is mediated by activation of an M1 muscarinic receptor. 5. The depolarizing effect or inward current induced by carbachol was completely blocked by the potassium channel blockers caesium, tetraethylammonium and barium. 6. The slope of the current-voltage (I-V) plots in carbachol was reduced in the majority of cells, and crossed the control I-V plots at a negative membrane potential. The reversal potentials in carbachol shifted in a positive direction when bathing potassium concentration was increased. 7. In a number of cells, the I-V curves in carbachol were parallel to or converged positively with the control I-V curves. 8. The effects of carbachol were compared to those of serotonin, which increases a 'pure' potassium conductance. Serotonin (10 microM) produced an increase in the slope of the I-V curve, with a reversal potential sensitive to changes in bathing potassium concentration. The carbachol reversal potential values were negative to those of serotonin at 5 and 10 mM-potassium. The equilibrium potentials for carbachol and serotonin were equal at 25 mM-potassium. 9. The negative values of the reversal potential at 5 and 10 mM-potassium and the occurrence of non-crossing I-V characteristics in carbachol could be explained by postulating a second effect of carbachol: namely, a non-specific conductance increase in the dendrites. 10. It is concluded that carbachol depolarizes pyramidal cells in the hippocampus by blocking a voltage-insensitive potassium leak channel and does so by activating M1 muscarinic receptors. In addition, carbachol may also activate a second conductance in the dendrites, which could account for the anomalous I-V characteristics sometimes seen in response to carbachol in these cells.", 
    "15": "In addition to differing in ethanol sensitivity, long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) mice also differ in response to GABAergic agents. In the present study the sensitivity of LS and SS mice to the anesthetic, hypothermic and anticonvulsant effects of benzodiazepine, flurazepam, was determined. Flurazepam (75-300 mg/kg) induced a dose-dependent loss of righting response in both lines. The LS line displayed a two-fold greater sensitivity to the anesthetic effects of flurazepam. A dose-dependent decrease in body temperature was also observed following administration of flurazepam (25-150 mg/kg), but the two lines did not differ on this measure. Determination of the anticonvulsant effects of flurazepam (1-6 mg/kg) against seizures induced by 3-mercaptopropionic acid revealed that the SS line was more sensitive to the anticonvulsant effects of this benzodiazepine. These studies demonstrate that LS and SS mice differ in response to flurazepam, but the nature of the difference depends on the type of response measured and the dose of flurazepam employed.", 
    "16": "Locomotor activity was measured, during 60 min, in CD-1 mice receiving chlordiazepoxide (2.5 or 5 mg/kg) after a pretreatment with saline solution or naloxone (0.5, 1, 2.5 or 5 mg/kg). Both doses of chlordiazepoxide significantly increased locomotor activity in saline-pretreated mice. Naloxone prevented chlordiazepoxide-induced hyperactivity, at doses that did not themselves affect activity. This antagonistic action of naloxone indicates that opioid mechanisms are involved in the locomotor stimulatory effects exerted by chlordiazepoxide in mice.", 
    "17": "The effects of chlordiazepoxide (5 and 10 mg/kg) on fluid consumption in water deprived rats were assessed. Drinking was inhibited to approximately equal extents by a water preload, by d-amphetamine (1.5 mg/kg), by neophobia and by shock at mild (0.3 mA) or moderate (0.5 mA) intensities, the latter condition having an enhanced level of deprivation also. At both doses chlordiazepoxide significantly enhanced drinking in the neophobia, mild shock and, especially, the moderate shock condition but failed to increase drinking suppressed by preload or d-amphetamine. It is concluded that the increases in drinking suppressed by neophobia or shock which chlordiazepoxide induces may be due to anxiolytic actions of the drug or to enhanced palatability since they cannot be explained in terms of nonspecific enhancement of fluid consumption.", 
    "18": "A battery of tests designed to elicit reactions to a variety of nonpainful threat stimuli was used to study the effects of the 5HT1A agonists buspirone (5-20 mg/kg), and gepirone (5-20 mg/kg) on the defensive repertoire of wild Rattus rattus. These two compounds produced very similar patterns of results on the test battery, with gepirone generally more effective: Both compounds failed to interfere with either spontaneous motor activity or avoidance/flight to an approaching experimenter. However, both reduced defensive reactivity to proximal threat stimuli, increasing passive contacts with the experimenter in an inescapable situation and reducing \"proximal\" defensive reactions: jump/flinch reactions to dorsal contact, and, boxing, and biting to a number of threat stimuli. Defensive threat vocalizations and jump attacks were also reduced, but less consistently, as was the experimenter's rating of subject's defensiveness to being picked up. This pattern of results suggested specific \"taming\" effects of buspirone and, especially, gepirone on defensive reactions. In combination with findings indicating somewhat different (benzodiazepines) to very different (ethanol) profiles for other anxiolytics in the same test battery, these results suggest that the Defense Test Battery may be capable of providing behavioural differentiation among various classes of anxiolytics.", 
    "19": "A technique for evaluating signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal that provides an accurate guide to benzodiazepine dosage is presented. In addition to achieving homeostasis, the total benzodiazepine dosage is greatly reduced. Adjunctive therapies for seizure prophylaxis and hypertension as well as substitution of other benzodiazepines for diazepam are discussed.", 
    "20": "Injection of neostigmine into the lateral cerebral ventricle of urethane-anesthetized rats increases arterial blood pressure. Prior injection of atropine or the muscarinic M2 antagonist 4-DAMP into the posterior hypothalamic nuclei inhibited the pressor response to neostigmine by up to approximately 56%. The same maximum degree of inhibition was elicited by bilateral electrical lesions of the posterior hypothalamic nuclei. The response was not modified by intrahypothalamic injection of pirenzepine or intraventricular injection of hexamethonium, but was prevented by intraventricular injection of 4-DAMP. The results indicate that about half of the pressor response to intraventricular injection of neostigmine was mediated through M2 muscarinic receptors in the posterior hypothalamic nuclei, and the remainder through M2 muscarinic receptors in other regions of the brain.", 
    "21": "Twelve healthy volunteers took part in a double-blind, cross-over comparison of the effects of lorazepam and alpidem on a battery of physiological, psychomotor and subjective tests before and after alcohol. Each subject received each treatment for 8 days and alcohol was given on day 8. Tests were carried out on days 1 and 4 and on day 8 before and after alcohol. Before alcohol the effects of alpidem on most tests were generally similar, but considerably less marked than those seen with lorazepam. There were some interesting differences between the two drugs in the effects on EEG and memory. In line with the effects seen with other anxiolytic drugs, lorazepam decreased the amplitude of auditory evoked potential. In contrast, alpidem was associated with an increase or a significantly smaller decrease. This suggests that there is no attenuation of input or central processing of the auditory stimuli. Both lorazepam and the higher dose of alpidem (50 mg) reduced the number of words recalled but the lower dose of alpidem (25 mg) had significantly less effect on both immediate and delayed recall. These differences persisted after alcohol. On most of the tests the depressant effects of the drug before alcohol were enhanced after alcohol. However, the depressant effects of alcohol combined with active drug were in general no greater than those with alcohol with placebo, suggesting some degree of cross-tolerance.", 
    "22": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of a standard solution of diazepam (DZ) (ValiumR) were compared with those of a novel diazepam mixed-micelles solution (DZ MM) (Valium MMR) both after i.v. and i.m. application utilizing radioreceptor assay, quantitative pharmaco-EEG and brain mapping techniques as well as psychometric and psychophysiological methods. The local tolerance was studied as well. The subjects received randomized and, in weekly intervals, following injections: (1) 10 mg DZ i.v. + placebo i.m.; (2) 10 mg DZ MM i.v. + placebo i.m.; (3) placebo i.v. + 10 mg DZ i.m.; (4) placebo i.v. + 10 mg DZ MM i.m.; (5) placebo i.v. + placebo i.m. Blood sampling, EEG-recordings, psychometric and psychophysiological tests as well as tolerance evaluations were carried out at 0, 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h. Blood level evaluation demonstrated after i.m. application a significantly shortened tmax, a higher Cmax and generally higher plasma concentrations in the first and second hour following the mixed-micelles solution than the standard formulation, which suggests better absorption of the former than the latter in the muscle. Subsequent to i.v. administration, lower blood levels were observed between 30 min and 2 h after DZ MM than DZ. Power spectral density analysis of the EEG resulted in typical anxiolytic-sedative pharmaco-EEG profiles after all 4 active substances as compared with placebo. However, there were significant inter-drug differences as far as topographic aspects (pharmaco-EEG maps) were concerned. DZ MM i.v. induced significantly more initial but also late delta augmentation, alpha attenuation and centroid slowing than DZ i.v. which suggests more sedative effects at those times. Following i.m. application, a significantly more pronounced delta/theta attenuation, beta augmentation and centroid acceleration after DZ MM than DZ suggested more anxiolytic effects of the novel than the standard formulation. Discriminant analysis of changes in 6 thymopsychic, 12 noopsychic and 17 psychophysiological variables demonstrated the best discrimination of the 4 substances based on thymopsychic effects. Considering the latter, all 4 active compounds differed significantly from placebo, with no inter-drug differences after i.v. application but a marked superiority of the novel mixed-micelles solution over the standard solution after i.m. application. Specifically, DZ MM i.m. induced more desactivation and affect-attenuation than DZ i.m.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "23": "The proposed amethystic imidazobenzodiazepine Ro 15-4513 and ethanol (ETOH) were examined in rats using two operant procedures, differential reinforcement of low rates of responding (DRL), and drug discrimination learning (DDL). In the first bar-pressing responses occurring 72 s or longer after the last reinforcement were rewarded; responses occurring earlier reset the time schedule. In the latter, animals were trained to discriminate between the effects of the analeptic pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and the non-drug condition; the schedule of reinforcement was FR-10. Water was the reinforcer. A dose of 1000 mg/kg ETOH decreased the rate of bar pressing in the DRL experiment; doses of 300 and 560 mg/kg ETOH did not. The decrease was not attenuated by Ro 15-4513. No significant deviations from baseline responding occurred with Ro 15-4513 (1, 3 10 mg/kg). The number of reinforcements increased significantly after ETOH (1000 mg/kg), but not after Ro 15-4513. Combinations of the two agents produced increases in the number of reinforcements. Changes in DRL behaviour induced by diazepam (1 and 10 mg/kg) were normalized by 3 mg/kg Ro 15-4513. In DDL, Ro 15-4513 (10 mg/kg) substituted for PTZ; ETOH did not. Diazepam and Ro 15-1788 attenuated the response generalization from Ro 15-4513 to PTZ; ETOH did not. There was a dose-related increase in the time to complete the DDL tests after ETOH treatment; addition of Ro 15-4513 increased the time further. In conclusion, antagonism between Ro 15-4513 and ETOH did not occur in the present studies; data are furthermore consistent with the view that Ro 15-4513 acts as a partial inverse benzodiazepine agonist.", 
    "24": "The binding of diazepam, digoxin, dopamine and fentanyl to different 0.2 microns end-line filters was investigated under simulated infusion conditions. All the drugs were diluted in either 5% dextrose or 0.9% NaCl infusion fluid. For digoxin and diazepam a marked reduction in the amount of drug delivered to the patient in the first 20-60 min of infusion is observed. For dopamine, the drug loss was less pronounced and no fentanyl was absorbed to the filters during the infusion experiment.", 
    "25": "The effects of prolonged weak anodal direct current (DC) on the electrocorticogram (ECoG) were investigated in awake rabbits. When the current (20-40 microA) was applied to the motor region of the cerebral cortex, seizure activity in the ECoG appeared from the frontal cortex. Repeated application of the DC decreased the threshold current for producing the seizure activity. Diazepam significantly elevated the threshold of the seizure activity. In contrast to the marked changes in the ECoG, no behavioral changes were observed during or after the application of weak anodal DC. The changes in the ECoG are discussed in relation to the intensity and duration of the DC.", 
    "26": "A programmed study on the effect of sodium thiopentone and midazolam on systemic blood pressure, pulse rate and intraocular pressure was done on sixty patients. A significant increase of all parameters was found after one minute. These values became less increased after three minutes. After five minutes a significant decrease of systolic and diastolic pressure, and intraocular pressure, as well normalization of pulse rate was found for both groups. A comparison between the results of both groups show that the systolic pressure was more significantly increased under the effects of midazolam than thiopentone. In contrast to this, pulse rate and introcular pressure showed similar changes in both groups.", 
    "27": "Withdrawal from long-term treatment with benzodiazepines was followed in three patients by a severe delusional depression. The delusional depression may be related to the neurotransmitter changes accompanying benzodiazepine withdrawal.

    "28": "The presenting problems and pre-admission diagnoses of 100 consecutive admissions to a geriatric psychiatry inpatient assessment unit were assessed in a retrospective survey and the use of psychotropic medication examined. Although post-admission diagnoses showed a high proportion of depressive illness amongst the patients, depression was infrequently diagnosed prior to admission and antidepressants infrequently used. The majority of these elderly patients were referred with a diagnosis of dementia and 'behaviour problems'. These were treated prior to admission with neuroleptics or benzodiazepines in line with prescribing habits in this population reported elsewhere in North America. Attention is drawn to the significant incidence of major depression in these patients and the excellent response to treatment, both with chemotherapy or with electrotherapy. Attention is also drawn to the pre-admission prescribing of psychotropic drugs which are likely to lead to problems when used in the elderly and likely to result in significant iatrogenic disorders.", 
    "29": "In this article, we show that feline predation involves a continuous gradient of activation between defense and attack and that predatory \"play\" results from an interaction of the two. Benzodiazepines (oxazepam, diazepam) escalated attack toward killing, so that cats that had avoided mice prior to the drug now played with them, cats that had originally played now killed, and cats that killed mice now did so with less preliminary contact. In such shifts, no sharp demarcation between play and predation was evident. Lateral hypothalamic lesions disrupted the escalation of attack. During recovery, attack was escalated once again along the gradient toward killing, but in the absence of both defense and play. A similar result was obtained in intact killers and nonkillers by the application of mild tail pinch. These results suggest that play with prey is a misnomer for predatory behavior that fails to escalate along the gradient between defense and attack. Movement notation analysis revealed that playful movements are adaptive in that they protect the cat from injury.", 
    "30": "Pharmacological studies on trithio-p-methoxy-phenylpropene (anethole trithione, ANTT, Felviten) were performed. ANTT at a dose of 100 mg/kg, p.o. lowered the increased serum transaminases GOT and GPT, and protected the liver from injuries caused by CCl4 in mice. In other studies in vivo, ANTT at a dose of 1000 mg/kg showed no effect on the central nervous system or the autonomic nervous system. In vitro experiments with smooth muscle preparations showed no significant effects of ANTT.",

The antibiotic was isolated in two active forms, the natural free hydroxyl form (porothramycin A) or the crystalline methyl ether form (porothramycin B) depending upon the isolation process used. Structural studies established that porothramycin is a new member of the pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepine group antibiotics having only one substituent on the benzene ring. The antibiotic exhibited antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and anaerobes and significantly prolonged the survival times of mice implanted with experimental tumors.", 
    "32": "Chloral hydrate 25, 50 or 75 mg kg-1 or midazolam 0.4, 0.5 or 0.6 mg kg-1, all given by mouth in combination with atropine 0.03 mg kg-1, were compared as premedication in 248 children in a randomized, double-blind study. Chloral hydrate was significantly less palatable than midazolam. The anxiolytic effect of chloral hydrate 75 mg kg-1 was \"good\" in children younger than 5 yr, whereas the other doses of chloral hydrate, and all doses of midazolam, provided only \"fair\" anxiolysis in this age group. All doses of both premedicants provided good anxiolysis in the older children. A satisfactory antisialogogue effect was seen in 83-90% of each group. About 20 min after extubation, restlessness was observed in 15-25% of the younger children premedicated with chloral hydrate 25 mg kg-1 or with midazolam 0.4 or 0.6 mg kg-1. The mean total recovery score (0-10) based on activity, ventilation, heart rate, conscious level and colour ranged between 5.8 and 6.8 at 10 min and between 9 and 9.5 at 70 min after extubation in all groups. Midazolam 0.5 mg kg-1 is recommended for children less than 5 yr of age and midazolam 0.4-0.5 mg kg-1 for older ones. Chloral hydrate 75 mg kg-1 provided good anxiolysis in both age groups; however, it was less palatable than the midazolam.", 
    "33": "Diazepam 10 mg was evaluated in a sleep laboratory study of six insomniac subjects. The protocol, which lasted for 18 consecutive nights, including four placebo-baseline, seven drug, and seven placebo-withdrawal nights, allowed for assessment of initial and short-term drug effects, side effects, and any withdrawal effects. With initial drug use, there was a significant improvement in sleep. Further, there was little evidence of tolerance developing at the end of the 1-week drug administration period. During drug administration there was a mild degree of daytime sedation reported. After abrupt termination of diazepam, there was a moderate degree of sleep difficulty on the sixth withdrawal night when total wake time was increased by 34% above baseline (not significant). On other nights, mild withdrawal changes were noted. These findings for the short-term administration and withdrawal of diazepam contrast with those for rapidly eliminated benzodiazepine drugs. The latter are characterized by a rapid development of tolerance and more frequent and intense withdrawal sleep disturbances.", 
    "34": "Aqueous acid extracts of wheat grains and of potato tuber were found to contain a series of compounds displaying a high affinity to the central type benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) in mammalian brain. Further analysis using different HPLC systems, as well as mass spectrometry and gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry lead to the identification of compounds belonging to the classical 5-phenyl-1,4-benzodiazepinones. In wheat grains diazepam, N-desmethyldiazepam, delorazepam, deschloro-diazepam, delormetazepam, lormetazepam and isodiazepam were identified, while potato tuber contained diazepam, N-desmethyldiazepam, delorazepam, lorazepam and delormetazepam. The concentration of the benzodiazepines (BZ) was in the low ppb range. Their biosynthesis most probably takes place in the plant tissue. The availability of BZs in plant nutritives points to a possible source for the previously reported presence of BZ in brain and peripheral tissues of several animal species and man.", 
    "35": "We compared the effects of a placebo with 0.125 and 0.25 mg of triazolam (Halcion) on sleep quality, oximetry, and respiratory events during sleep in ten stable outpatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The subjects had a forced expiratory volume in 1 s ranging from 17% to 76% of the predicted value (mean +/- SD, 38.1% +/- 19%) and a waking arterial oxygen pressure from 46 to 84 mm Hg (mean +/- SD, 67 +/- 12 mm Hg). Polysomnography was done on three nights within a two-week period after the patients received on a \"blinded\" basis either placebo or 0.125 or 0.25 mg of triazolam. Triazolam produced improvements in total sleep duration, time spent in stage 2 nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and subjective of sleep quality. For most patients, there was a nighttime drop in arterial oxygen percentage of saturation (SaO2) in the placebo condition, but triazolam did not cause a significant worsening, of the mean SaO2, minimum SaO2, or the number of apneic and hypopneic events. Across all experimental conditions, we documented little desaturation during wakefulness (mean low, 87.2% +/- 10.2%), more during NREM sleep (mean low, 83.2% +/- 12.6%), and most desaturation in REM sleep (mean low, 80.1% +/- 15.7%). We conclude that single-night use of triazolam improved the quality and duration of sleep in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In patients without severe waking hypoxemia and without carbon dioxide retention, triazolam did not increase either nocturnal hypoxemia or respiratory events during sleep.", 
    "36": "The rate of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) formation (Vf) and resistance to reabsorption of CSF (Ra) were determined in dogs at four doses of thiopental (6, 12, 18, and 24 mg.kg-1.h-1), midazolam (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg.kg-1.h-1), and etomidate (0.86, 1.72, 2.58, and 3.44 mg.kg-1.h-1). Results were compared within and between groups and to previously reported normal values for Vf (0.030-0.054 ml/min) and Ra (220-240 cmH2O.ml-1.min) in dogs. At the two lower doses of thiopental, midazolam, or etomidate Vf was not significantly different than previously reported normal values. At the two higher doses of each drug Vf was 0.019-0.024 ml/min, significantly reduced compared to Vf at the two lower doses of each drug. The pattern of Ra data was more varied. With thiopental Ra was elevated at the lowest dose, (354 +/- 17 cmH2O.ml-1.min, mean +/- SD) reduced at the highest dose (156 +/- 19 cmH2O.ml-1.min), and not significantly different than previously reported normal values at the two intermediate doses. With midazolam Ra was elevated at the lowest and highest doses (332 +/- 25 and 378 +/- 18 cmH2O.ml-1.min) and normal at the two intermediate doses. With etomidate Ra was normal at the three lower doses and reduced at the highest dose (187 +/- 13 cmH2O.ml-1.min). It is concluded that CSF volume may be increased and the CSF pressure at which CSF volume contracts may be increased by doses of thiopental or midazolam that increase Ra, but not increased by etomidate.", 
    "37": "Peptidal (CR-1409) and nonpeptidal (L-364,718) cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists were used to determine the possible involvement of CCK in the fasted and fed intestinal motility patterns and the related alterations in pancreatic secretion. Dogs were implanted with electrodes along the small bowel and with chronic pancreatic fistulas. In fasted dogs, the typical migrating motor complex (MMC) cycles and accompanying fluctuations in pancreatic secretion were recorded. Neither of the CCK antagonists affected these motor and secretory components of the MMC. Feeding interrupted the MMC and increased spike activity at all levels of the small bowel, and this was accompanied by a significant increase in pancreatic secretion and in plasma hormone [gastrin, CCK, and pancreatic polypeptide (PP)] levels. Both CCK antagonists significantly reduced the postprandial spike activity but failed to restore the fasted pattern. Exogenous gastrin and CCK, as well as bombesin, induced fedlike motility patterns accompanied by marked pancreatic protein secretion. These effects were completely reversed to the fasted patterns during intravenous infusion of CCK antagonists. In contrast, cholinergic stimulation (bethanechol) induced a fedlike pattern that was more resistant to CCK antagonists. We conclude that CCK does not play a major role in the fasted motility pattern and related fluctuations in pancreatic secretion but may be partly involved (by itself and by released PP) in the induction of the fed motility pattern and the postprandial stimulation of the exocrine pancreas.", 
    "38": "The canine lower esophageal sphincter (LES) was evaluated as a model for investigation of the electrophysiology of nonadrenergic noncholinergic neurotransmission. The LES contained a dense collection of gap junctions and a moderate number of nerves located at the periphery of muscle bundles, which are often associated with interstitial cells of Cajal. These cells make gap junctions with one another and with smooth muscle cells. The nerve varicosities contained many large dense cored vesicles. In vitro the LES produced spontaneous active tone and relaxed to field stimulation that was blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX). Increase of stimulus duration or frequency produced a partially TTX-insensitive sphincter relaxation. Basal tone and nerve-mediated relaxation were unaffected by cholinergic, histaminergic, or adrenergic antagonists. Acetylcholine, carbachol, or histamine caused TTX-insensitive contractions mediated by M2- and H1-receptors, respectively. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (10(-6) M) and isoproterenol (10(-6) M) relaxed the LES to the same extent as field stimulation. In the double sucrose gap this tissue regularly produced inhibitory junction potentials when field stimulated. The canine LES has appropriate morphological and pharmacological properties for the electrophysiological study of nonadrenergic noncholinergic neural responses, their mechanisms, and mediators.", 
    "39": "This study was performed to determine the subtype of M2 muscarinic receptor that is involved in the action of cholinergic agents on prostaglandin (PG) synthesis as well as on the mechanical function of the isolated rabbit heart perfused at a constant flow rate with Krebs-Henseleit buffer. The increase in PG output elicited by acetylcholine (ACh) or arecaidine propargyl ester (APE), a selective M2 agonist was attenuated by both 11-[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl-5,11-dihydro-6H- pyrido-[2,3-b][1,4]-benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116), an M2 alpha antagonist, and hexahydro-sila-difenidol (HHSiD), an M2 beta antagonist. The coronary vasodilating effect of ACh and APE was inhibited by HHSiD, but not by AF-DX 116, whereas the vasoconstrictor effect was blocked by AF-DX 116, but not by HHSiD. The decrease in heart rate produced by ACh or APE was blocked by AF-DX 116, but not by HHSiD; however, the decrease in developed tension produced by the cholinergic stimuli was abolished by all these muscarinic receptor antagonists. The increase in PG output or changes in the mechanical parameters of the heart produced by ACh or APE were not altered by adrenergic receptor antagonists, phentolamine and propranolol, or by the nicotinic receptor antagonist, hexamethonium. The effect of isoproterenol or exogenous arachidonic acid to enhance PG output was not altered by these M2 receptor antagonists; however, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin abolished the output of PG elicited by these agents or by ACh or APE. These data indicate that the effect of cholinergic stimuli to promote cardiac PG synthesis and decrease developed tension is mediated through the activation of both M2 alpha and M2 beta subtypes of muscarinic receptors. The cholinergically induced vasodilating component of the coronary response is mediated through the activation of M2 beta, whereas the coronary vasoconstriction and the decrease in heart rate is mediated through the activation of M2 alpha muscarinic receptors.", 
    "40": "A 64-year-old woman with long-standing bipolar illness was treated with carbamazepine and clonazepam with minimal success. Discontinuation of carbamazepine and clonazepam was followed by episodic amnesia, purposeless behavior, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and confusion. Although her EEG was normal, the episodes were compatible with complex partial seizures and ceased after carbamazepine and clonazepam were reinstituted. This case raises the question of whether discontinuing carbamazepine and clonazepam can induce complex partial seizures in bipolar patients.", 
    "41": "Rats (N = 14) were trained to respond under a five seconds differential reinforcement of low rate (DRL 5'') schedule and under a fixed ratio 10 (FR10) schedule of reinforcement. Ro 15-1788 did not influence the number of responses in the DRL 5'' schedule, but increased responding in the FR10 schedule. Ethanol (ETOH, 1250 mg/kg) and CGS 8216 (5 mg/kg) suppressed responding in both schedules and these effects were not antagonized by Ro 15-1788. The response suppressing effects of ETOH in both schedules were not influenced by CGS 8216. These results indicate that the response suppressing effects of ETOH and CGS 8216 are not mediated by the BDZ receptor. Ro 15-4513 suppressed responding strongly in the FR10 schedule. The response suppressing effects of Ro 15-4513 were additive with the response suppressing effects of ETOH. In rats (N = 11) trained to respond under a variable interval 40 seconds-fixed ratio 10 (VI 40''-FR10) schedule Ro 15-4513 dose-dependently suppressed responding. These results indicate that Ro 15-4513 has sedative effects and is not able to antagonize all the behavioral actions of ETOH.", 
    "42": "Alfentanil is a short acting opioid that has an established place in anaesthesia. Its predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, particularly its rapid termination of effect and haemodynamic stability, have led to its use by continuous intravenous infusion both during anaesthesia and more recently in critically ill patients. Fine control of a potent analgesic that has respiratory depressant and antitussive properties would be particularly advantageous in this group, offering patients an improvement in comfort without increasing the risk of oversedation. Pharmacokinetic studies of alfentanil have demonstrated wide interindividual variations. This may be due to a wide variety of factors including age, obesity, hepatic dysfunction, changes in regional haemodynamics, sex, and alterations in plasma protein binding ability and concentration. The importance of pharmacogenetic differences and tolerance to alfentanil remains to be elucidated. Renal disease does not appear to significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of this agent, which may make it particularly useful in this situation. Since alfentanil does not depress conscious level or produce anxiolysis, additional agents such as a benzodiazepine will be necessary to provide adequate sedation. The difficulties in accurately predicting the response of an individual critically ill patient necessitate careful and continuous dose titration of alfentanil according to the clinical response.", 
    "43": "Effects of alfentanil, preceded by lorazepam, on suppression of haemodynamic and somatic responses to noxious stimuli was studied in patients undergoing CABG. Plasma concentration of alfentanil, somatic and haemodynamic responses were measured at loss of consciousness, tracheal intubation, sternotomy and during multiple application of electrocoagulation. Additional alfentanil was administered i.v. to control unwanted responses. Study 1 (six patients): lorazepam 0.08 mg kg-1 by mouth 1-2 h before operation, alfentanil priming infusion (60 micrograms kg-1 min-1 for 10 min) followed by maintenance infusion (4.5 micrograms kg-1 min-1). With mean plasma alfentanil 1178 (SEM 54) ng ml-1, two patients required supplementary alfentanil to suppress somatic motor responses; one patients required nitroglycerin to control an increase in arterial pressure which was unresponsive to additional alfentanil following sternotomy. Study 2 (13 patients): lorazepam 0.04 mg kg-1 by mouth as premedication; one of three maintenance infusion rates of alfentanil: 5.4 (n = 4), 6.6 (n = 5), or 7.8 (n = 4) micrograms kg-1 min-1, each preceded by a proportional priming infusion. With plasma alfentanil 2181 (62) ng ml-1, somatic motor responses requiring additional alfentanil occurred in nine patients; haemodynamic responses in four of seven patients tested could not be controlled by alfentanil. The highest plasma concentration of alfentanil to prevent response to a stimulus other than tracheal intubation was different between the two studies (P less than 0.05). We conclude that alfentanil alone is insufficient to suppress haemodynamic and somatic motor responses to noxious stimulation during CABG and that the role of premedication is significant.", 
    "44": "Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) caused an increase in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) in conscious rats. The pressor effect was greatly diminished by adrenalectomy as well as after pretreatment with phentolamine, an alpha-receptor antagonist or with mecamylamine, a ganglion blocker, suggesting that centrally administered TRH increases BP mainly by stimulating sympathetic activity. Under halothane (0.8%), pentobarbital (33 mg/kg, i.p.) and flunitrazepam (0.8 mg/kg, i.v.) anaesthesia, the pressor effect of TRH was almost completely blocked. The increase in BP induced by peripheral alpha-receptor stimulation with phenylephrine was not affected by the anaesthetics at these doses. Pretreatment with atropine (50 micrograms, i.c.v.) significantly reduced the pressor effect of TRH. Intracerebroventricularly administered haloperidol and bicuculline also partially diminished the increase in BP produced by TRH, while other neurotransmitter blockers such as phentolamine, propranolol and naloxone did not. These results indicate that the anaesthetics at the doses employed interfere with the central neuronal pathway(s), probably cholinergic pathways, through which TRH exerts its pressor effect.", 
    "45": "The Cl content of isolated tracheal submucosal gland cells was studied using 36Cl as a tracer. 36Cl uptake reached a steady state within 10 min, yielding an estimate of intracellular Cl concentration of approximately 40 mM. Intracellular Cl fell rapidly when ouabain or furosemide was added, indicating that isolated tracheal submucosal gland cells concentrate Cl above its electrochemical equilibrium concentration. Acetylcholine (ACh) caused a Ca2+-dependent decline in cell Cl, with an effective concentration for a 50% response (EC50) of 62 nM; this loss of cell Cl was blocked by atropine or pirenzepine. The EC50 was 6 nM in cells when 95% of the acetylcholinesterase activity was abolished by diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) treatment. ACh continued to cause a decline in cell Cl even after a 7-day course of DFP treatment, which has been shown to abolish ACh-stimulated mucous glycoprotein secretion (23). After the 7-day course of DFP treatment, the EC50 for ACh increased to 77 nM. Thus the Cl economy of the tracheal submucosal gland cell resembles that of cells in epithelia that secrete fluid; in addition, the transmitter-dependent loss of cell Cl is under long-term metabolic control of the cell.", 
    "46": "Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies (MEMP) are rare diseases caused by a disturbance of the mitochondrial chain of respiration. This prevents pyruvate from being completely integrated into the tricarboxylic acid (Krebs') cycle, and hence there is an accumulation of lactate. Histologically this is marked by the appearance of \"ragged red fibres\" in the light microscope which, in the electron microscope, are eventually recognised as typical accumulations of pathological mitochondria. The clinical pattern can vary greatly and ranges from ophthalmoplegia via mainly myopathic to encephalopathic forms. The pattern of signs and symptoms enables subclassification into three main syndromes (10): The Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS), \"myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibres syndrome\" (MERRF) and \"mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and strokelike episodes syndrome\" (MELAS). Intermediate types, however, are frequent. Furthermore, quite a large number of other syndromes such as the \"Toni-Fanconi-Debr\u00e9 syndrome\" can be classified among the group of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies.--The patient must be classified as a risk patient. Disturbances of cardiac conduction may require a transient or permanent pacemaker. Increase in oxygen requirement must be avoided to prevent increase in lactate levels and development of lactate acidosis. The severity of the myopathy makes it necessary to exercise caution in the use of benzodiazepines and long-term relaxants. When using local anaesthetics one should consider both their negative dromotropism and the resulting reduction of the epileptic threshold. There is a relative contraindication for spinal and epidural anaesthesia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "47": "The present review was designed to integrate both experimental and clinical data and to focus on the problems of management of severe cases of acute organophosphate poisoning, which always show CNS involvement. AChE activity, in discrete regions of the human brain, was studied by quantitative histochemistry of 40 mu thick sections. The regional effects of AChE inhibition by organophosphates was examined in a comparative study of the brains of two victims and two control brains, matched for age and sex. The pattern of AChE inhibition was regionally selective. The most significant decreases were observed in the neocerebellum, thalamic nuclei and the cortex. This specific distribution of AChE inhibition may be correlated with some of the clinical characteristics of acute organophosphate poisoning. The diagnostic value of blood AChE levels was examined in a personal series of 53 patients, who needed artificial ventilation, intensive care monitoring and antidotal treatment. The effects and side-effects of the antidotal treatment were reassessed. Recommended regimen of therapy was outlined, based upon experience in this series and in recent animal studies. The logical therapy would be and almost always in the co-administration of an anticholinergic drug (usually atropine) and an AChE reactivator (oximes) in order to rapidly obtain the most beneficial effect in the critically ill patient. Seizures that do not respond to the specific antidotal therapy, should be treated with I.V. benzodiazepines. Artificial respiration and supportive measures are essential for patient' survival. They enable the patient to gain the necessary time for sufficient recovery of AChE activity.", 
    "48": "One hundred twenty patients undergoing elective endoscopies were studied. They were allocated into three groups and accordingly they received Diazepam, Flunitrazepam and Midazolam. The effect of these drugs on the task performance of the patient's memory, anxiety and sedation level were assessed using objective tests. Cardiovascular and respiratory parameters were also assessed. All observations were subjected to student's t-test and chi squared assessment. We concluded that there are no major differences between the three drugs in the dosage used. However, the Midazolam group showed faster recovery, more sedation, less pain on injection than the Diazepam group. As for the cardiovascular system, there was a tendency for hypotension and tachycardia in all groups. Patients in the Midazolam group had more amnesia as compared to the other groups.", 
    "49": "Fifty-two adult depressed outpatients fulfilling Research Diagnostic Criteria for Definite Major Depressive Disorder were enrolled in a double-blind study comparing the antidepressant effects of alprazolam versus desipramine. Twenty-nine patients completed the seven week (one week placebo followed by six weeks of active drug) study. The mean daily dose of alprazolam and desipramine at study termination was 3.34 mg and 192 mg respectively. Based on psychometric ratings of depression (Hamilton Scale) and severity of illness (Clinical Global Impressions) there was no significant difference between alprazolam and desipramine at the end of six weeks of active drug treatment. Both medications were well tolerated with drowsiness being the most common side effect of alprazolam, and insomnia, dry mouth, and constipation, the complaints most associated with desipramine.", 
    "50": "Clinical outcome and adverse effects associated with concurrent alprazolam and imipramine administration were studied in 29 patients with major depressive disorder who completed a 6-week trial in which they served as their own controls. Alprazolam was added on Day 8 in gradually escalating, then gradually tapering dosages while imipramine dosages remained unchanged. Significant decreases were observed in scores on the Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression and Anxiety at all later evaluation days with Day 8 as baseline. The mean total Symptom and Side Effects score decreased significantly from Day 8 to Day 22 when alprazolam doses were 1 mg q.i.d. For most side effects, total number of reports remained constant or decreased from Day 1 to later evaluation days. Standing diastolic blood pressures were significantly lower on Day 22 than on Day 1. No significant relationship was found between any rating scale score and plasma concentration data.", 
    "51": "In an intensive multidrug, multidose study, nine elderly depressed patients were administered 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg of scopolamine hydrobromide, 1 mg of oral lorazepam, and placebo in a double-blind investigation aimed at assessing the status of the central cholinergic nervous system in geriatric depression. Significant cognitive and behavioral effects of scopolamine were observed only at the high dose (0.5 mg), while lower doses and lorazepam showed no significant differences from placebo. Cognitive deficits caused by scopolamine were in the areas of new learning, access to semantic memory, vigilance, and continuous performance. Behavioral effects consisted of activation, restlessness, and anxiety, but there was no significant effect on depressed mood. These results suggest that elderly depressed patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment seem to be more similar to previously studied elderly controls rather than to patients with Alzheimer's disease in their reaction to short-term cholinergic blockade, and suggest that the cognitive and mood changes often seen in geriatric depression may involve factors other than disturbed muscarinic cholinergic mechanisms.", 
    "52": "The influence of L 364718 on islet responsiveness to sulfated cholecystokinin (CCK-8S) was investigated. In islets whose inositol-containing phospholipids were prelabeled during a 2-h incubation period, subsequent exposure to L 364718 (1 nM) significantly impaired the secretion of insulin usually noted in response to 200 nM CCK-8S in the simultaneous presence of 7 mM glucose. A higher level of the antagonist (10 nM) completely abolished insulin secretion. L 364718 (1-10 nM) reduced the efflux of 3H from myo-[2-3H]-inositol prelabeled islets in parallel with the reduction in secretion. L 364718 (10 nM) significantly reduced the accumulation of 3H-containing inositol phosphates usually noted with CCK-8S addition. L 364718, at levels 10- to 100-fold greater than those necessary to attenuate CCK-8S-induced insulin secretion, had no adverse effect on the insulin secretory response of freshly isolated islets to 10 mM glucose alone, 5 mM D-glyceraldehyde, 15 mM alpha-ketoisocaproate, or 50 ng/ml gastric inhibitory polypeptide. L 364718 (1000 nM) had no adverse influence on carbamylcholine (1 mM)-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis. These results establish L 364718 as a potent and highly selective antagonist of cholecystokinin's stimulatory actions on beta-cells. Because of its potency, selectivity, and oral effectiveness, in vivo studies with L 364718, aimed at unraveling the pleiotropic effects of CCK-8S on glucose and insulin homeostasis, seem feasible.", 
    "53": "The neuroendocrine effects of 5 and 10 mg of oral diazepam were assessed in 10 normal subjects under baseline (prestress) and laboratory-controlled stressful conditions. Although the 10-mg diazepam dose had no effect on cortisol at baseline, it significantly reduced the increase in cortisol produced by 15 minutes of exposure to a painful electrical stimulus. There were no significant effects on growth hormone, beta-endorphin or ACTH, either at baseline or after painful stimulation.",

    "55": "The binding of 0.4 microgram mL-1 diazepam and 0.75 mol diazepam mol-1 of albumin by a perfluorochemical (PFC) emulsion, Fluosol-DA, 20%, by human serum albumin (HSA), and by their mixtures, has been examined at ambient temperature. The concentration of free diazepam was determined by standard centrifugation followed by supernatant ultrafiltration. Non-specific loss of diazepam occurred to the ultrafiltration device. This loss was independent of drug concentration and a correction factor was employed to calculate the true free diazepam concentration. Diazepam was extensively bound by the PFC emulsion. The percent free diazepam increased as the emulsion concentration decreased, while the binding of diazepam appeared to be independent of drug concentration. Diazepam did not partition into the pure PFC liquids, indicating that emulsion-bound diazepam is only associated with the emulsifiers of the droplets. Diazepam was extensively bound by HSA and the percent free diazepam increased as drug concentration increased or as HSA concentration decreased. The PFC emulsion significantly displaced HSA bound diazepam in all mixtures examined. Studies with the individual and combined components of the emulsion indicated that this displacement is largely attributed to the oleic acid component and, to a much smaller degree, the Pluronic F-68 component of the emulsion.", 
    "56": "Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of the highly selective opiate mu-receptor agonist, dermorphin, produced dose-dependent catalepsy in conscious rats. The cataleptic effect of dermorphin was abolished by pretreatment (intraperitoneal, i.p.) with the opiate-antagonist naloxone (5 mg/kg), thyrotropin-releasing hormone analog CG3703 (1 mg/kg) or the benzodiazepine-antagonist Ro 15-1788 (5 mg/kg) whereas pretreatment with the benzodiazepine alprazolam (1 mg/kg) potentiated the cataleptic effect of dermorphin. When given to cataleptic rats, naloxone and CG3703, but not Ro 15-1788, reversed the dermorphin-induced catalepsy. The data suggest an involvement of benzodiazepine receptors in the induction of catalepsy mediated by opioid mu-receptors. Other opioid-modulating neuronal systems, antagonized by CG3703, may be involved in maintaining the dermorphin-induced cataleptic state.",

The patients were diagnosed as having bipolar depression (97), unipolar depression (54), cycloid psychosis (21), schizoaffective psychosis and depressive neurosis (42). Sixty patients were treated with lithium salt only, 73 patients received neuroleptic drugs in addition to lithium and 51 antidepressant drugs. Sixteen patients were treated with a combination of neuroleptic drugs, antidepressant drugs and lithium. Fourteen patients were treated with lithium and benzodiazepines. The aim of this retrospective lithium study was to examine the renal function in these different treatment groups. The results show that patients treated with a lithium salt and neuroleptic drugs have significantly lower urinary osmolality than those treated with a lithium salt only. Also tricyclic antidepressants in combination with a lithium salt appear to have an influence on renal function. The duration of concomitant therapy seems to be of importance for the effect on renal function. Eleven patients with the lowest osmolality values were investigated at the Renal Unit, Danderyd Hospital, but in no case was it necessary to withdraw the lithium treatment.", 
    "58": "Medication is largely inappropriate in the management of anxiety, and benzodiazepines are not apparently effective in the minor affective disorders commonly seen in general practice (Catalan and Gath, 1985). Enough has been said to indicate that other measures are likely to be more helpful and to reduce the tendency to prescribe benzodiazepines. The taking of these drugs threatens to become epidemic and while medical agencies are by no means the only sources, sensible prescribing will go--and may already have gone, as the DHSS (1986) figures suggest--some way toward limiting consumption of these drugs. The DHSS needs to record more specific data relating to benzodiazepine use and abuse. Comparative trials of benzodiazepines and alternative non-benzodiazepine methods of anxiety management need to be set up as matter of urgency. The (no doubt) false impression that the pharmaceutical industry is dragging its feet in planning and sponsoring such trials should be speedily dispelled. Benzodiazepine prescribing, if it increases, may well in itself become a major danger to public health.", 
    "59": "Treatment outcomes were compared for an intervention emphasizing reinforcement for abstinence from illicit drug use and an alternative intervention which combined the same reinforcement contingencies with aversive consequences for unauthorized drug use. Sixteen polydrug abusing methadone maintenance patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Both groups received the opportunity to take methadone doses away from the clinic (take-home dose) as reinforcement for submitting urines testing negative for illicit substances. A regular weekly take-home dose of methadone could be earned for every 2 weeks of verified abstinence from unauthorized drugs, up to a maximum of three take-home doses per week. The combined intervention group had an additional contingency which involved a reduction in methadone dose as an aversive consequence for submitting urine samples testing positive for illicit substances. Specifically, 10% of the patient's daily methadone dose was lost for each week in which two of three urines tested positive for illicit drugs. An examination of the urinalysis results indicated no between group differences. Overall, 8% of the 12-week baseline urinalysis results tested negative for illicit substances while 42% tested negative for unauthorized substances during the 20 weeks of treatment intervention. At the end of the intervention period, nine subjects remained in treatment with three patients in each group receiving at least once weekly take-home privileges. Of the seven subjects no longer in treatment, five were in the combined intervention group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "60": "During one week in 1985, 227 general practitioners in the County of Arhus, Denmark, recorded their prescriptions of benzodiazepines. In all 2,812 prescriptions were recorded, for 2,574 patients. The sex ratio (male/female) was 1.0/2.0. The incidence of first-time prescriptions was 26.0 prescriptions/1,000 inhabitants/year. The prescription rate, calculated as defined daily doses/1,000 inhabitants/day, was highest for minor tranquillizers in the age group 60-69, whereas for hypnotics/sedatives it was highest in the age group 70+. Of minor tranquillizers, 83-84% were prescribed as anxiolytics, and of hypnotics/sedatives, 98% were prescribed as hypnotics. Only 18-28% of patients had a diagnosis of psychiatric illness. Between 62-75% of patients received no other treatment than a benzodiazepine prescription. At the time of the first prescriptions, 44-57% of the patients were mentally distressed. For about 33% of patients, a somatic illness was of essential importance for the prescription. Twenty-six percent of the men and 17% of the women taking benzodiazepines were recognized as real or potential abusers. Eighty-three percent of repeat prescriptions were prescribed through indirect contacts.", 
    "61": "The purification of 7-[125I]iodoclonazepam by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for use in a very sensitive benzodiazepine radioimmunoassay is described. A silica column is used with a non-aqueous eluent and sequential ultra-violet and gamma-ray detection. A commercially available antiserum is used at a dilution of 1:1000. Blood samples are diluted 10-fold with buffer before analysis and only 25 microliters of diluted sample are required per assay tube. Benzodiazepines, but not the radiolabel, appear to be bound by blood proteins in competition with the antiserum and so, if undiluted blood is assayed, erroneously low results are obtained. The minimal sample requirement and the high sensitivity of the assay described here largely avoid this problem while maintaining acceptable detection limits. For diazepam, the detection limit is 2.5 ng/ml in blood or urine (after correction for the initial 10-fold dilution) and therapeutic or sub-therapeutic levels of many other benzodiazepines can be detected. In practice, the assay is reliable, simple to perform and extremely economical.", 
    "62": "The disposition of ethyl loflazepate (Victan) was studied on 12 healthy male volunteers after administration of the two oral formulations of the drug: one 4-mg tablet and two 2-mg tablets according to an open crossover single dose comparison. A model-independent analysis and a model-dependent approach were used to treat experimental data. Appropriate statistical tests (ANOVA, Wilcoxon test, Westlake test for model-independent parameters; principal components analysis, Hotelling T2 test for model-dependent parameters) demonstrated the bioequivalence of the two formulations.", 
    "63": "An adult patient with severe tetanus was successfully treated with alternating long-term infusions of propofol (20-80 mg/h, 8 + 3 days) and midazolam (5-15 mg/h, 29 days) for sedation, and with vecuronium infusion (6-8 mg/h, 35 days) for muscle relaxation. In addition, continuous infusion of labetalol (10-20 mg/h, 39 days) was given to control arterial blood pressure. Blood samples were taken daily for assays of propofol, midazolam and vecuronium plasma concentrations. No accumulation of propofol and vecuronium could be detected. There was an increase in liver enzyme activity at the end of the first 8-day propofol infusion. During the 4-week midazolam infusion, there were two marked plasma concentration peaks at times when the infusion rate was fairly stable. These changes coincided with pulmonary infection (C-reactive protein elevated) and ciprofloxacin treatment. The patient awoke rapidly after the last propofol infusion. He was unable to recall anything about his stay in the intensive care unit.", 
    "64": "The presence of protracted tinnitus after discontinuation of long-term therapeutic doses of diazepam (less than or equal to 30 mg/day) is described in three patients. In one of these patients, the association of the tinnitus appearance with the drug discontinuation was documented in a double-blind, randomized, crossover single case study. Objective confirmation of drug use or of abstinence was performed by obtaining plasma benzodiazepine concentrations. The findings provide further documentation that sensory disturbances of short- and long-term duration are among the most distinctive clinical features of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "65": "In a recent series of controlled studies, investigators looked at what happened when benzodiazepines were discontinued. Despite methodological problems, these studies showed that rebound anxiety occurred in a substantial minority of patients after several weeks of drug use. Also, a withdrawal syndrome developed in nearly half of patients who used benzodiazepines for more than a year. In these studies, risk factors included dose, duration of use, elimination rate of the drug, and abruptness of discontinuation. Patients who are physically dependent on benzodiazepines may need help in stopping these agents. Physicians should advise gradual discontinuation and, along with emotional support, should consider the use of alternative medications for the control of symptoms.", 
    "66": "Male rats were trained to discriminate the stimulus effects of CGS 9896 (30.0 mg/kg) from its vehicle. Once trained, discriminative performance was observed to be dose-responsive in the 3.75-30.0 mg/kg range and analysis of the dose-response curve generated an ED50 of 6.44 mg/kg. Generalization testing with chlordiazepoxide and pentobarbital produced CGS 9896-appropriate responding, whereas administration of the GABA agonists SL 75 102 resulted in 75% (intermediate) generalization to the CGS 9896 discriminative stimulus. Although full antagonism of the CGS 9896 cue was obtained following administration of Ro15-1788 and pentylenetetrazole, the inverse agonist DMCM failed to provide complete antagonism. These results suggest that the discriminative properties of CGS 9896 are consistent with its activity as a benzodiazepine receptor agonist.", 
    "67": "Binding to components of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex was examined in cortical membranes from rats treated for 3 weeks with continuously releasing diazepam pellet implants. Chronic diazepam treatment resulted in a decrease in the ability of GABA to inhibit benzodiazepine inverse agonist binding. The amount of binding of benzodiazepine agonist, antagonist, and inverse agonist to benzodiazepine recognition sites was unaltered by the chronic treatment, as were the potencies of these benzodiazepine ligands in inhibiting agonist (3H-flunitrazepam) binding. Chloride channel binding (35S-TBPS) was also unchanged by chronic diazepam treatment. A change in GABA/benzodiazepine coupling and/or a decreased effectiveness of GABA may be responsible for the desensitization of GABA/benzodiazepine interaction.", 
    "68": "The effects of various benzodiazepine receptor ligands on the GABA autoreceptor have been studied in slices of cerebral cortex of the rat. The GABAA receptor agonist muscimol inhibited the K+-stimulated release of [3H]GABA with a pIC25 of 7.65 +/- 0.11. This effect was antagonised by the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline, which had an IC50 of 0.36 +/- 0.03 microM. Small concentrations (less than 1 microM) of the benzodiazepine full agonist clonazepam did not significantly alter K+-evoked release of [3H]GABA but shifted the concentration-effect curve for muscimol to the left. This effect was blocked by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. By contrast, the benzodiazepine full inverse agonist methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate shifted the muscimol concentration-effect curve to the right and this too was blocked by flumazenil. The results suggest that the GABA autoreceptor in cortical slices from the rat is modulated by a benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "69": "In vitro autoradiography was used to determine the binding properties and distribution of 9 major neurotransmitter receptors and their subtypes in the striate (area 17 of Brodmann) and extrastriate (areas 18 and 19) cortex of 1 infant and 3 adult rhesus monkeys. Differences in total labeling and nonspecific labeling, as well as Kd and Bmax values, were determined for all cortical layers and sublayers in both cytoarchitectonic areas by Scatchard analysis of autoradiograms. Area 17 differed from area 18 in the laminar pattern and density of virtually every ligand examined, i.e., 3H-clonidine, 3H-prazosin, 125I-iodopindolol, 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate, 3H-5-hydroxytryptamine, 3H-ketanserin, 3H-muscimol, 3H-flunitrazepam, and 3H-spiperone. Kd and Bmax values for each ligand were remarkably consistent across the 3 adult monkeys analyzed quantitatively. Particularly dramatic contrasts were observed with clonidine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and ketanserin, which have high affinity for alpha 2-adrenergic, 5-HT1-, and 5-HT2-receptors, respectively. The differences in distribution of these ligands, especially clonidine and 5-hydroxytryptamine, correlated well with specific laminae and hence exhibited distinctly different patterns in areas 17 and 18. Other ligands, such as flunitrazepam and quinuclidinyl benzilate that bind to GABAergic and cholinergic receptors, were visually less discriminating both among layers and between regions. However, layer for layer, the Bmax values for quinuclidinyl benzilate were higher in area 17 than 18, indicating the subtle differences between areas may be revealed only by quantitative measures. Some ligands were particularly dense in layer I (iodopindolol in areas 17 and 18; 5-hydroxytryptamine in area 18), and others subdivided cortical layers that are otherwise cytoarchitectonically uniform (e.g., flunitrazepam and clonidine in layer VI of area 17), indicating that areal differences in ligand binding are not a simple read-out of cell-packing density but most likely reflect a genuine difference related to the neurotransmitters of intrinsic and extrinsic afferents in each area. The presence of binding sites in every layer of both areas for all ligands examined indicates that their distribution across laminae is quantitative and not all-or-none. No layer contained less than 50% of binding sites present in any other layer. These findings reveal that visual cortical areas differ in density and lamination of neurotransmitter receptors and presumably in their sensitivity to circulating levels of endogenous neurotransmitters and pharmacologically active compounds.", 
    "70": "The dynamics of the anticonvulsive effect (antagonism to the pharmacological effects of korazol, bicuculline, and picrotoxin) of sodium barbital, phenazepam, diazepam and their structural analogues was studied at their individual and combined administration. The indices of the combined pharmacological effect of barbiturates and benzodiazepines are not the summation of the pharmacologic effects of the compounds. The mutual influence of the effects of exogenic ligands--convulsive agents and anticonvulsive compounds was studied which can be considered as a result of the hyperbolic modification of three states of the GABA-receptor complex.", 
    "71": "The in vivo effects of various benzodiazepine (BZD) ligands belonging to different chemical families were studied comparatively in mouse cerebellum using displacement of 3H-Ro 15-1788 binding and cGMP content as biochemical tools. It was possible to differentiate four classes of compounds with regard to these biochemical parameters. The first class of compounds such as diazepam and suriclone induced a net effect on in vivo 3H-Ro 15-1788 binding and a dose-dependent decrease of cGMP levels. A second class of drugs such as ZK 91296 and CGS 9896 showed in vivo activities in displacement studies but relatively small or moderate activities on cGMP levels. A third class was represented by Ro 15-1788 itself which prevented dose-dependently the in vivo 3H-Ro 15-1788 binding but was devoid of effect on cGMP levels. Finally, a fourth class of compounds (CGS 8216, FG 7142, beta-CCM and DMCM) showed in vivo displacement of 3H-Ro 15-1788 with concomitant increase of cGMP levels. The first class of compounds represents full agonists, the second class, partial agonists, the third class, the antagonist Ro-15-1788 itself, and the fourth class corresponds to inverse agonists. Thus it is proposed to use 3H-Ro 15-1788 binding and cGMP levels to differentiate in vivo BZD ligands acting on the BZD receptor/GABA receptor/chloride ionophore complex."
