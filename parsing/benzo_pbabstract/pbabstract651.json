This dose of diazepam prior to succinylcholine (1) significantly diminished the incidence of postoperative muscle pain; (2) decreased the usual increase in serum potassium; (3) did not prevent the rise in creatine phosphokinase; (4) reduced the incidence of muscle fasciculation; and (5) did not affect the magnitude or duration of the succinylcholine neuromuscular block. It was concluded that diazepam had several advantages over d-tubocurarine in the prevention of succinylcholine-induced muscle pain.", 
    "1": "Orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic failure may occur secondary to systemic disease states (notably diabetes) or as a disease entity in its own right with a variable degree of neurological involvement that has resulted in a confused classification. The diagnosis, classification and treatment of these latter forms of orthostatic hypotension is reviewed. The pathology is in the central and efferent autonomic pathway, resulting in a disordered baro-receptor reflex, postural hypotension, abnormal responses to tilting and the Valsalva manoeuvre, an inappropriately fixed heart rate and other autonomic features. Anaesthesia may be associated with profound hypotension and some of the signs of anaesthesia may be absent. The response to cardiac depressant drugs and reduction of circulating blood volume may be exaggerated due to absence of compensatory mechanisms. The response to vasoactive agents is unpredictable. The importance of preoperative evaluation, monitoring during operation and the careful selection of anaesthetic agents and techniques is discussed.", 
    "2": "The action of many psychotropic drugs on the adenylate cyclase system and its role in the regulation of tumour cell division justify the expectance that potentially psychotropic 1-benzopyrano[4,3-b]-1,5-benzodiazepine derivatives (3a,b and 6a,b) will also exert a cancerostatic effect. The synthesis of 6,6a,7,8,13,13a-hexahydro-1-benzopyrano[4,3-b]-1,5-benzodiazepines (4a and b) and their separation into the antileukaemic (L 1210) cis-forms and the inefficacious trans-forms are described. The cis-form 5a, unlike the trans-form 6a, stimulated the adenylate cyclase system.", 
    "3": "Ten benzodiazepines--clorazepate, nitrazepam, clonazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, N-desmethyldiazepam, diazepam, prazepam, and flurazepam--in solid dosage form are identified by ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) spectrophotometry and by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). UV absorption data and IR spectra of the 10 benzodiazepines are provided and HPLC separation methods are described.", 
    "4": "Elfazepam (7-chloro-1-[2-(ethylsulfonyl)ethyl]-5-(2-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4benzodiazepin-2-one) and-9-aza-cannabinol )10 hydroxy-beta-(3-methyl-2-octyl)-5',5-dimethyl-5H-1 benzopyranol 3,4-d pyridine, HC1) were administered IV to study their effects on feed intake and acid secretion in abomasal Pavlov pouches in sheep. Elfazepam and 9-aza-cannabinol increased 3-fold 3 hr postinjection feed intake and decreased abomasal acid secretion compared to saline and DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) control treatments. At doses which elicit feeding, 9-aza-cannabinol was a much more potent inhibitor of acid secretion than elfazepam. These results are consistent with the theory of localized hypothalamic nuclei which have roles in the control of both feed intake and gastric acid secretion. However, in contrast to feeding associated with normal hunger, the benzodiazepine and cannabinol stimulated feeding is associated with decreased gastric acid secretion.", 
    "5": "There were no significant differences in the age, sex or chlordiazepoxide therapy of patients completing and patients not completing a 7-day detoxication program.", 
    "6": "University overnight infirmary admissions for drug abuse were reviewed over the 2-year periods 1968--1970 and 1973--1975. Hallucinogen abuse diminished over the years studied while alcohol abuse increased. Marijuana abuse was essentially unchanged. Diazepam overdosage generally replaced barbiturate overdosage, while aspirin remained the most common drug in overdose situations.", 
    "7": "The pharmacokinetics of nitrazepam in saliva and serum was studied in 12 healthy volunteers after a single administration of a 5 mg nitrazepam tablet. The binding of nitrazepam to plasma proteins was determined 4 hours after the administration by ultracentrifugation. The analysis of nitrazepam concentrations was performed by 63Ni-EC-GLC. The pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated manually or by AUTOAN-program in serum, and manually in saliva. The concentrations of nitrazepam in serum and saliva correlated significantly (r = 0.472, P less than 0.001, n = 97). The ratio saliva: serum was, however, time dependent. The protein free fraction in serum was significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than the salivary concentration at the same time (4 hours after administration). The peak concentrations in serum and saliva were 40.7 and 1.9 ng/ml (P less than 0.001) and the times to reach the peak maximum 2.4 and 2.5 hours, respectively (difference not significant). The mean half-life of nitrazepam in serum was 30.5 hrs and in saliva 39.9 hrs, the difference being significant at P less than 0.05. The distribution phase parameters, poorly described before, were calculated. The clinical value of nitrazepam analysis in saliva seems to be negligible.", 
    "8": "Nitrazepam and its main metabolites, 7-aminonitrazepam and 7-acetamidonitrazepam, free and conjugated, were determined in the human urine after a single oral dose of 5 mg. The determinations were performed by GLC method using 63Ni-EC-detector for unchanged nitrazepam and nitrogen selective detector for the metabolites. Unchanged nitrazepam was poorly eliminated through the kidneys (about 1% of the dose). The interindividual variation of total excreted urinary metabolites was large ranging between 848-4933 microgram (17-99% of the dose during 7 days). Of this amount conjugated metabolites made up 57%. The urinary half-lives of free and conjugated-7-aminonitrazepam were (mean and ranges) 44 (23-65) and 46 (25-69) hrs, and of 7-acetamidonitrazepam 12 (5-31) and 18 (5-46) hrs, respectively. The half-lives of the excreted amounts of the metabolites did not correlate with any pharmacokinetic parameter of unchanged nitrazepam in serum.", 
    "9": "The albino rat strain Wistar and Shynashylla rabbit liver microsomal fraction was immobilized by incorporation into polyacrylamide gel. It is shown, that the microsomal fraction immobilized by such a method catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1,4-benzdiazepine-2 ones, 3-acetoxyderivatives, hydroxylation in position 3 of 1,4-benzdiazepine-2-ones and reduction of nitrazepame. The storage thermostability and stability of the immobilized preparations were studied. Immobilization of the animal liver microsomal fraction was conducted on sylochrome by cyanuric chloride and 2,4-toluylenediisocyanate.", 
    "10": "The syntheses of some 1,4-benzodiazepines potentially useful as haptens are reported. These compounds are related to chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, nitrazepam, clonazepam, and some of their metabolites. The chemistry reported here is intended to support specific immunoassay development for these drugs.", 
    "11": "Placement of intracavitary applicators for treatment of gynecological cancer is usually done in the operating room under general anesthesia. This requires premedication, operating and recovery room time, and is time consuming and expensive. The authors have found that the implant can be performed in a radiation medicine department using intravenous Demerol and Valium. Analgesia has many advantages in comparison to general anesthesia for intracavitary implant therapy.", 
    "12": "The sedative properties of trazodone were the object of a double blind study in dental out-patients, comparison being made with diazepam. It was observed that oral trazodone possesses considerable tranquillizing activity. It has no side-effects either after intake or during return home. The use of capsules containing 50 mg of trazodone is recommended. At this dose, sympathetic hyperactivity is also inhibited. Diazepam doses of 15 mg lead to mental sedation and inhibition of symptoms due to sympathetic hyperactivity but, unlike trazodone, diazepam possesses hypnotic acitivity and side-effects that make its use dangerous in patients who cannot be taken home by somebody else, or who have to drive a car.", 
    "13": "Under randomized double-blind conditions, 1.00 to 1.67 mg of intravenous physostigmine (Antilirium) reversed sleep induced by administration of 0.102 to 0.238 mg/kg body weight of intravenous diazepam in eight healthy human volunteers. Awakening occurred 330 to 740s after initiation of the physostigmine infusion at a rate of 0.5 mg/min every 4 min. Diazepam plasma levels were not significantly different at the start of either the physostigmine or placebo infusion. Physostigmine did not effect plasma binding of diazepam. Six subjects experienced nausea, and one subject developed an arrhythmia. Physostigmine reverses diazepam-induced hypnosis but causes side-effects requiring cautious administration.", 
    "14": "We describe the use of electron-capture gas chromatography or reversed-phase \"high-performance\" liquid chromatography for concurrent analysis for diazepam and nordiazepam in serum. In the gas-chromatographic analysis our use of a new chemically deactivated stationary liquid phase, SP 2250-DB (Supelco, Inc.), resulted in improved chromatographic sensitivity and peak symmetry for the two benzodiazepines as compared to that obtained with either OV-17or OV-1 phases. Steady-state concentrations of diazepam and nordiazepam in serum as determined by gas-liquid chromatography correlated closely with those found by liquid-liquid chromatography.", 
    "15": "Three membrane preparations of rat cortex were used to examine the effects of GABA, bicuculline and bicucine on specific 3H-diazepam binding. In the crude synaptosomal fraction, GABA had no effect on either the maximal binding capacity (Bmax) or dissociation constant (KD) of 3H-diazepam binding. Bicuculline and bicucine both decreased binding affinity. This was antagonized by adding GABA. In the repeatedly washed membrane preparation, and in the washed, frozen and thawed preparation, GABA increased binding affinity and, at high concentrations, increased Bmax. Increased binding affinity was observed with as little as 10(-8) M GABA in the washed, frozen and thawed preparation. Bicuculline inhibited the effect of GABA on 3H-diazepam binding. It was found that about 3 X 10(-5) M GABA was present in the assay medium containing crude synaptosomal fraction. These results suggest endogenous GABA is present in, and influences the results of 3H-diazepam binding assays. Furthermore, it appears that GABA and bicuculline affect 3H-diazepam binding through their binding to the specific GABA binding site.", 
    "16": "Lorazepam is of value in the performance of gas encephalography. Given with judicious and individualized doses of IV narcotic, it has significantly lessened the morbidity of this examination. We have been particularly impressed with the lack of unpleasant memories for the procedure. The quality of the examination was good through the patients had to be reminded, because of the amnestic effects of the drug, to hold still throughout the 6-s exposure needed for polytomography.",

RU 31158 potentiated minimal hypnosis in mice induced by both hexobarbital and chlorprothixene with ED50 values of 2.15 (1.53-3.01) and 0.69 (0.46-1.02) mg/kg p.o. respectively; these compared to values for diazepam of 17.00 (11.25-25.67) and 3.60 (2.25-5.76) mg/kg p.o. RU 31158 also potentiated hexobarbital in the rat with an ED50 value of 1.2 (0.7-2.0) mg/kg p.o. as compared to 32.0 (27.5-38.5) mg/kg p.o. for diazepam. Sleep studies in the rat confirmed the hypnotic properties of RU 31158, and also showed that the duration of action at 8.0 and 16.0 mg/kg p.o. was not longer than 9 hours. RU 31158 also showed potent minor tranquilizer, anxiolytic, and anti-convulsant properties in a series of pharmacological tests.",

Eight metabolites of triazolam have been identified, namely, triazolam, dichlorotriazolobenzophenone (DCTB), 1'-hydroxytriazolam, dichloro-alpha-hydroxytriazolobenzophenone (1'-hydroxy-DCTB), Ar-hydroxytriazolam, 4-hydroxytriazolam, Ar-1'-dihydroxytriazolam and 1',4-dihydroxytriazolam. 2. Major metabolites found in the urine were 1',4-dihydroxytriazolam, 1'-hydroxy-DCTB and DCTB in rats; 1'-hydroxytriazolam, 4-hydroxytriazolam and conjugated 1'-hydroxytriazolam in dogs. 3. Major metabolites found in the faeces were 4-hydroxytriazolam in rats; 1'-hydroxytriazolam and 4-hydroxytriazolam in dogs. 4. Conjugated 4-hydroxytriazolam was the major metabolite in both the original and reabsorbed bile of rats. 5. Major metabolites in free form in the plasma were 4-hydroxytriazolam and 1'-hydroxytriazolam in rats; triazolam and 1'-hydroxytriazolam in dogs. 6. The major metabolite in the brain was triazolam, but those in the liver were 4-hydroxytriazolam and triazolam, and in the kidneys were 4-hydroxytriazolam and 1',4-dihydroxytriazolam. 7. Major metabolites in the urine, faeces, plasma and brain after 7-, 14- or 21-day repeated dosing in rats were not much different in type and ratio from those after single dosing. 8. Unchanged triazolam and 1'-hydroxytriazolam were the major metabolites in the plasma, placenta, foetus and amniotic fluid in pregnant rats. 9. There was no change in hepatic aniline hydroxylase and aminopyrine-N-demethylase activity from controls in rats given oral dose of [14C]triazolam for 14 days.", 
    "19": "1. Peak radioactivity in the blood was reached at 30 min after i.p. and 1 h after oral dosing of [14C]triazolam to rats. In dogs, peak blood level was observed at 30 min after oral dosing. 2. Daily dosing of triazolam to male rats for 21 days caused a gradual increase in blood level, with peak at 1 h after dosing. 3. The rate of binding of triazolam plus its metabolites to plasma protein of rats was about 30% at 15 min and 6 h. 4. In rats, the majority of the activity of the intra-intestinally administered [14C]triazolam was found in the small intestines in 6 h. 5. About 58% of the oral dose and 77% of the i.p. dose were recovered in the bile of rats in 48 h after dosing. When the bile from one rat was introduced into the duodenum of a second rat, approximately 37% was recovered in the bile of the second animal in 24 h. 6. In male rats, high radioactivity was seen in the liver, kidneys, adrenals and heart, and low in the CNS. By 96 h after dosing, radioactivity in the liver, blood and kidneys was very low, and was undetectable in other tissues and organs. Radioactivity levels in tissues after daily dosing for 7, 14 and 21 days did not differ appreciably from single administration. 7. In monkeys, activity was high in the liver, kidneys and skin following oral administration and low in the CNS. 8. After oral administration of [14C]triazolam to pregnant rats, the activity in the uterus and placenta was higher than that in the maternal blood. The activity in the foetus was low. 9. In rats given [14C]triazolam orally or i.p., 85% and 12% of the oral dose, and 82% and 14% of the i.p. dose were recovered in the faeces and urine, respectively, in 96 h. The rate of cumulative faecal and urinary excretion after repeated dosing was similar to the single dosing with 80% and 14% of the activity recovered, respectively, in faeces and urine in 6 days. In dogs, 50% of the oral dose was found in the faeces and 40% in the urine. 10. Radioactivity in the milk of rats was maximal at 4 h after oral dosing. It declined to 34% of the peak level 48 h later.", 
    "20": "CL 218,872 is the first non-benzodiazepine to selectively displace brain specific 3H-diazepam binding with a potency comparable to that of the benzodiazepines. Like the benzodiazepines, CL 218,872 increased punished responding in a conflict situation and protected against the convulsions induced by pentylenetetrazole. These three pharmacological properties are highly predictive of anxiolytic activity. Unlike the benzodiazepines, however, CL 218,872 was relatively inactive in tests designed to measure effects on neuronal systems which utilize GABA, glycine and serotonin as transmitters. Furthmore, CL 218,872 was relatively free of the ataxic and depressant side effects commonly associated with the benzodiazepines. Because of this high degree of selectivity, CL 218,872 may represent a new probe for investigating neuronal substrates of anxiety.", 
    "21": "The effects of minor tranquilisers and of stimulant drugs were studied in the Social Interaction test of anxiety in which the illuminance and unfamiliarity of the test arena are manipulated. Acute administration of sodium phenobarbitone (25 mg/kg) was without effect. Acute administration of sodium phenobarbitone (35 mg/kg) and of meprobamate (60 mg/kg) produced sedation: both locomotor activity and social interaction were reduced. On the other hand, amphetamine sulphate (2 mg/kg) and caffeine citrate (20 mg/kg) reduced social interaction, but increased locomotor activity. Chronic administration dissociated the pattern of results produced by sodium phenobarbitone (35 mg/kg) from that produced by flurazepam (0.5 mg/kg). With chronic treatment (5 days) neither drug reduced motor activity, but whereas phenobarbitone increased social interaction regardless of the test illuminance and unfamiliarity, the increase produced by flurazepam was limited to the more stressful test conditions, i.e., when the arena was unfamiliar or brightly lit.", 
    "22": "The tranquilizers diazepam, nitrazepam, chlordiazepoxid and elroquil produce diverse effects on conflict interaction of the systems of brain reinforcement subjected to simultaneous electric stimulation. The anxiolytic action of diazepam and chlordiazepoxid on behavior is determined by displacement of the activity balance of the systems of reinforcement to the system of positive reinforcement. Prevalent activity of the system of punishment in the action of elroquil accounts for its lower tranquilizing effect.", 
    "23": "A simple, rapid and sensitive radioreceptor assay for determining benzodiazepines in serum is based on the displacement by the drug of specific [3H]diazepam binding to a membrane fraction from rat brain. The limit of detection of the more active benzodiazepines is about 0.5 ng. Diazepam, nitrazepam, clobazam and HR 458 have been assayed in human serum after a single oral clinical dose. The results can be used for determining pharmacokinetic parameters. The technique measures not only the parent benzodiazepine but also clinically active metabolites.", 
    "24": "The effect of phenazepam and sydnocarb in doses of 0.05, 0.07 and 0.1 mg/kg or 6, 12 and 24 mg/kg, respectively, on the behaviour of C57BL/6, CBA and BALB/c mice, was studied in the \"open field\" test. Interlinear difference in the reaction of inbred animals to emotional stress and its phenazepam or sydnocarb correction were established.", 
    "25": "The new Soviet tranquilizer phenazepam given to rats intraperitoneally at a dose of 1 mg/kg daily was shown to be capable of suppressing ethanol addiction produced by 2-month intake of 5% ethanolic solution as the only source of liquid. The mechanism of this effect is likely to be related to the changes in the activity of the neurosecretory centers of the hypothalamus. The phenazepam in the treatment of chronic alcoholism.", 
    "26": "The history, physiology, pharmacology, and clinical application of fetal breathing are reviewed. Early optimism that measurements of fetal breathing would aid in perinatal management decisions has remained unfulfilled. Problems to be overcome include standardization of technique and measurement parameters and allowance for physiologic variations. Recent research developments indicate that the likely role of fetal breathing in perinatal medicine will be in conjunction with other established tests of fetal health.", 
    "27": "Lorazepam is a 3-hydroxy-1,4-benzodiazepine derivative biotransformed by glucuronide conjugation, followed by urinary excretion of the glucuronide metabolite. The kinetic properties of single 1.5- to 3.0-mg doses of intravenous lorazepam were assessed in 15 healthy elderly subjects, 60 to 84 yr of age, and in 15 healthy young subjects, 19 to 38 yr of age. Volumes of distribution for lorazepam in the elderly group (mean, 0.99 1/kg), were slightly but significantly smaller than in the young group (1.11 1/kg), suggesting less extensive drug distribution in the elderly. Values of elimination half-life (t1/2beta) in the elderly (15.9 hr) did not differ significantly from those in the young group (14.1 hr), but total clearance in the elderly (0.77 ml/min/kg) was 22% less (p less than 0.05) than in the young subjects (0.99 ml/min/kg). Age differences in lorazepam clearance were partly explained by more frequent cigarette smoking in the young subjects. Gender had no apparent relationship to kinetics. The rate and completeness of absorption of intramuscular (IM) and oral loraxepam was assessed in 10 of the elderly subjects. Deltoid IM injection and oral administration of tablets in the fasting state led to rapid absorption of lorazepam into the systemic circulation. Peak plasma lorazepam concentrations were always reached within 2.5 hr, and values of absorption half-life (t1/2a) did not exceed 45 min. Absorption of IM and oral lorazepam was 80% to 100% complete. Thus, the aging process is associated with small changes in the kinetics of lorazepam. IM and oral administration of lorazepam in elderly persons, as in the case of young individuals, leads to rapid and nearly complete absorption into the systemic circulation.", 
    "28": "While no major differences with regard to psychopharmacological actions are to be found among the benzodiazepines, certain pharmacokinetic differences are known. These differences allow the benzodiazepines to be classified as cumulative or non-cumulative; the differences between these two groups are further dissected and evaluated, in an attempt to rationalize therapy with these agents.", 
    "29": "Identical overall rates and patterns of key pecking by pigeons were maintained under a multiple fixed-interval schedule of food presentation. In one component, every thirtieth response produced an electric shock (punishment) whereas during the other component the response that produced food had to be preceded by a pause of a minimum (10 or 11 s) duration. Although chlordiazepoxide (1.0--17.0 mg/kg) increased both punished and unpunished responding, greater increases were uniformly obtained with punished responding.", 
    "30": "These experiments were performed to examine the effects of graded doses of diazepam, flurazepam, or lorazepam given to Swiss-Webster mice either 30 min prior to training or immediately after training in a one-trial inhibitory (passive) avoidance task. A 350 MUA footshock was administered following entry into a darkened compartment and retention was tested three days later. Doses of 10.0 mg/kg diazepam and 20.0 mg/kg lorazepam given before training significantly impaired acquisition, while 1.0 mg/kg flurazepam, given immediately after training, produced retrograde amnesia. These results indicate that benzodiazepines affect memory processes and that various drugs of the benzodiazepine family differentially affect acquisition and memory consolidation.", 
    "31": "To assess the effects of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) on a stable discrimination performance, eight rats were trained on a simple brightness discrimination and injected with three dosages (0, 5, and 10 mg/kg) once performance was stable. Signal detection analysis of the results was used to differentiate sensory from motor/responsivity effects of the drug. At 5 mg/kg, CDP increased general responsiveness which is consistent with the hypothesis that CDP disinhibits responding. At 10 mg/kg, however, this effect on responsivity was reversed and there was also a suppression of stimulus sensitivity.", 
    "32": "The pharmacokinetics and distribution in brain and cerebellum of diazepam after a single dose were studied in middle aged (6 months) and old (18 months) rats. Following the single intravenous bolus of 5 mg/kg diazepam was eliminated more slowly in old rats (T 1/2 (beta) = 3.1 H) than in middle aged rats (1.4H). This was due to an increase in the apparent volume of distribution Vd beta from 11.0 l/kg (control rats) to 29.5 l/kg. Concentrations of diazepam in brain and cerebellum were in the same range (0.5-1.1 ng/mg) in both groups after this dose. We conclude that the distribution of diazepam is age-dependent which might be due to an altered body composition."
