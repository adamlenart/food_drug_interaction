The present experiments sought to determine the effects of BDZ ligands upon synaptic responses and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus following electrical stimulation of the angular bundle. Intraseptal infusion of the BDZ agonist, chlordiazepoxide, decreased the amplitude of the evoked population spike and increased paired-pulse facilitation at a 150-ms interstimulus interval (ISI) in a dose-dependent manner. Intraseptal infusion of the BDZ antagonist, flumazenil (10 nmol), enhanced the amplitude of the dentate population spike and also increased paired-pulse facilitation at the 150-ms ISI. There was no effect of either BDZ receptor ligand upon the slope of the rising phase of the evoked population excitatory postsynaptic potential (pEPSP). Intraseptal flumazenil also significantly enhanced the magnitude of dentate LTP induced by high-frequency stimulation of the angular bundle. Intraseptal chlordiazepoxide failed to alter LTP induction. These results indicate that intraseptal infusion of an amnestic dose of the BDZ ligand, chlordiazepoxide, decreases the excitatory responsiveness of the dentate gyrus to its synaptic input from entorhinal cortex. In contrast, the promnestic BDZ ligand, flumazenil, enhances dentate granule cell responsivity, and facilitates synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus network. Taken together these data suggest that the memory impairing and memory enhancing action of these compounds may be a function of their ability to alter hippocampal physiology during a critical phase of memory. The potential role of septodentate cholinergic and GABAergic projections in the present observation is discussed.", 
    "1": "The alpha subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor is known to be photoaffinity labeled by the classical benzodiazepine agonist, [3H]flunitrazepam. To identify the specific site for [3H]flunitrazepam photoincorporation in the receptor subunit, we have subjected photoaffinity labeled GABA(A) receptors from bovine cerebral cortex to specific cleavage with cyanogen bromide and purified the resulting photolabeled peptides by immunoprecipitation with an anti-flunitrazepam polyclonal serum. A major photolabeled peptide component from reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography of the immunopurified peptides was resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The radioactivity profile indicated that the [3H]flunitrazepam photoaffinity label is covalently associated with a 5.4-kDa peptide. This peptide is glycosylated because treatment with the enzyme, peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase, reduced the molecular mass of the peptide to 3.2 kDa. Direct sequencing of the photolabeled peptide by automated Edman degradation showed that the radioactivity is released in the twelfth cycle. Based on the molecular mass of the peptides that can be generated by cyanogen bromide cleavage of the GABA(A) receptor alpha subunit and the potential sites for asparagine-linked glycosylation, the pattern of release of radioactivity during Edman degradation of the photolabeled peptide was mapped to the known amino acid sequence of the receptor subunit. The major site of photoincorporation by [3H]flunitrazepam on the GABA(A) receptor is shown to be alpha subunit residue His102 (numbering based on bovine alpha 1 sequence).", 
    "2": "A series of studies was devised in both an experimental model of food deprivation, i.e., beagle dogs undergoing a progressive reduction of calorie intake and adolescent females with anorexia nervosa (AN) in the acute and recovery phase, and in patients with atypical eating disorders. The studies were aimed at ascertaining whether the alleged function of the hypothalamic system inhibitory to growth hormone (GH) secretion, i.e., the somatostatinergic, may account for at least some of the abnormalities of GH secretion present in AN patients (e.g., elevated basal GH levels, paradoxical GH rise after glucose or thyrotropin releasing hormone, etc). Caloric restricted dogs or patients with eating disorders were given an intravenous injection of the physiologic GH-releasing peptide GHRH alone or preceded by pirenzepine, a muscarinic cholinergic antagonist reportedly capable of eliciting hypothalamic release of somatostatin (SS), or pyridostigmine, a muscarinic cholinergic agonist which, conversely, would restrain hypothalamic release of SS. In addition, dogs were challenged with acute administration of glucose or thyrotropin-releasing hormone, compounds also thought to act via somatostatinergic influences. Data obtained in dogs under caloric restriction or in AN patients in the acute phase of the disease with drugs affecting cholinergic transmission suggest that the latter is increased in both conditions (only partial suppression of the GHRH-induced GH rise with pirenzepine, failure of pyridostigmine to further enhance the GH response to GHRH). Instead, in the same AN patients in the acute phase tested during recovery, in AN patients during the recovery phase, and in patients with atypical eating disorders, pirenzepine completely suppressed the GH response to GHRH, as it did in controls. Finally, data obtained on basal and GHRH-stimulated GH release in dogs given glucose or thyrotropin-releasing hormone and in AN patients given arginine, another compound thought to act via inhibition of somatostatinergic influences, do not support the view that somatostatinergic function is impaired in states of food deprivation.", 
    "3": "The anxiogenic beta-carboline, FG 7142 (20 mg/kg) significantly increased glutamate efflux in the prefrontal cortex of conscious rats as assessed by microdialysis. Pretreatment with the benzodiazepine receptor agonist, diazepam (5 mg/kg), abolished this effect. These findings indicate that anxiogenic compounds produce an effect similar to physical stressors on the outflow of glutamate, and implicate the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex in the stress-induced activation of glutamate systems in the prefrontal cortex.", 
    "4": "The influence of the cholecystokinin (CCK)-A receptor antagonist, devazepide (DVZ), on the chicken digestive tract was investigated. The passage of food from the crops of birds treated with DVZ was not significantly different from that of the control. DVZ treatment did not inhibit the biliary flow stimulated by the CCK analogue, caerulein. Dispersed chicken pancreatic acini stimulated with CCK were treated with various concentrations of DVZ. At 10-5 M, DVZ completely inhibited amylase release; this concentration was much higher than those reported to have similar effects in mammals. The results suggest that the action DVZ as a CCK antagonist in the chicken is very weak.", 
    "5": "Several putative functions have been attributed to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), but its precise physiologic role has not been elucidated. In the present study, we investigated PBR function by quantifying this receptor in leukocyte subsets from healthy donors and in leukemic blasts from lymphoid and myeloid lineages. Using a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) directed against the human PBR and a quantitative flow cytometric assay, we found that phagocytic cells from healthy donors displayed a higher level of PBRs than lymphocytes or natural killer (NK) cells. Among the lymphoid lineage, thymocytes and IgD-negative B cells expressed the lowest levels. However, because of the wide heterogeneity of PBR levels among 42 acute or chronic lymphoid and myeloid leukemias, it was not possible to assign PBR expression to a stage of maturation or a cell lineage. Although the PBR displayed a mitochondrial subcellular localization, its expression was not correlated with the mitochondrial content, suggesting a modulation of PBR density at the level of the mitochondria. This modulation was confirmed when we studied in detail the PBR expression during T-cell development by both flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. We found that the PBR was expressed with a bimodal profile during T-cell development, identical to the one observed with the proto-oncogene, Bcl-2. The high similarity in the expression of both the PBR and the Bcl-2 proto-oncogene in T-cell and B-cell subsets, their common mitochondrial localization, and the observation of high quantities of PBR in phagocytic cells, which are known to produce high levels of radical oxygen species, suggested that PBRs may participate in an antioxidant pathway. Indeed, a strong correlation was established between the ability of hematopoietic cell lines to resist H202 cytotoxicity and their level of PBR expression. Demonstration of the role of PBR in the protection against H202 was obtained by transfecting JURKAT cells with the human PBR cDNA. Transfected cells exhibited increased resistance to H202 compared with wild-type cells, suggesting that PBR may prevent mitochondria from radical damages and thereby modulate apoptosis in the hematopoietic system.", 
    "6": "Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is an attractive approach for the analysis of drugs in body fluids. We made a simultaneous analysis of nitrazepam, diazepam, estazolam, bromazepam, triazolam and flurazepam using CE with on-column detection at 200 nm. We obtained the best electropherograms under a condition of 5 mM phosphate-borate (pH 8.5) containing 50 mM SDS and 15% methanol. We examined the effect of the sample solvent matrix on the electropherograms obtained, indicating that increasing the methanol content in the sample solvent or the injection volume above a certain threshold limit decreased the resolution. We then focused on application of the CE to the analysis of the drugs in spiked serum, being appropriate for an analysis within 25 min. Linearity, the detection limit, accuracy and reproducibility were established using this method. The calibration curve was linear up to 1 mg/l of serum concentration. The lower limit of detection was 5 pg per injection and 0.025 mg/l of the serum concentration for all the compounds except for flurazepam, for which they were 40 pg/injection and 0.2 mg/l. The detection limits obtained allowed toxicological and pharmacological determinations for nitrazepam, diazepam, estazolam and bromazepam, but not for triazolam and flurazepam. Only toxic blood levels for the latter two benzodiazepines could be quantified by this method. We concluded that the CE could at least be applicable to simultaneous screening for toxic levels of benzodiazepines. We suggest that this technique may offer criminal toxicologists a rapid, simple and adaptable approach for the estimation of many other drugs in body fluids.", 
    "7": "To explore further the effects of the HIV-1 transactivator protein Tat on human lymphoid cell function we examined the effects of Tat on lymphocyte proliferation and programmed cell death (apoptosis). We found that the HIV-1 Tat protein induced apoptosis and inhibited lymphocyte proliferative responses in lymphocytes obtained from healthy HIV-1 seronegative donors. Surprisingly, the Tat inhibitor Ro 24-7429 also induced apoptosis and inhibited antigen-induced lymphocyte proliferation. In checkerboard experiments, each agent could antagonize the effects of the other in both assays. These data suggest that Tat and its inhibitor may interact with a host element critically important in the processes of lymphocyte proliferation and programmed cell death. The HIV-1 Tat protein may affect both lymphocyte survival and function in HIV-1 infection, thereby contributing to the immune deficiency of HIV-1 disease.", 
    "8": "We have characterised the biphasic response of the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist RU34347 in the rat cerebellar slice preparation using extracellular electrophysiological recordings from Purkinje cells. RU34347 (10 fM-10 nM) produced an increase in GABA(A)-mediated inhibition at between 10 fM and 10 nM, a response normally associated with benzodiazepine agonists. This response was biphasic, being dose dependent between 10 fM and the peak effect at 10 pM, and inversely related to concentration between 100 pM and 10 nM. Associated with this increase in inhibition was a decrease in firing rate, also showing a biphasic concentration-response relationship. The agonist-like response was composed of two elements, an initial increase occurring after 5 min followed by a slow decline over the next 20 min. This second, declining, phase was more evident at higher concentrations of RU34347. The peak effect seen at 10 pM was fully antagonised by 1 microM flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. This concentration of flumazenil also antagonised the decrease in firing rate induced by 10 pM RU34347. The response to 10 nM RU34347 was further characterised since the largest second phase decline was demonstrated at this concentration. 10 nM flumazenil fully antagonised the second, declining, phase of the response, but not the magnitude of the initial increase. A partial antagonism of the peak effect was seen with 1 microM flumazenil, and a full antagonism at 10 microM flumazenil. This effect was similar to that observed with Ro15-4513 in a previous study. Therefore, we investigated the binding of RU34347 to diazepam-insensitive benzodiazepine receptors. [3H]Ro15-4513 was displaced by Ro15-4513, flumazenil and Ro19-4603, but not by RU34347. Therefore, although the electrophysiological data correlate well with that previously reported for Ro15-4513, RU34347 does not displace Ro15-4513 binding at the diazepam-insensitive benzodiazepine receptor. Therefore, either both ligands bind to complimentary sites on the same receptor complex, or both induce a similar physiological response through an action on different receptors.", 
    "9": "Previous studies on the efficacy of valerian extracts have given occasional hints of possible side effects involving impaired vigilance. Because of the currently insufficient knowledge about potential impairment of vigilance by plant-based sedatives, we have conducted a controlled study to assess the effects of two plant-based sleep remedies in comparison with flunitrazepam and placebo after single oral administration. Aim of the study was to derive recommendations concerning potential hazards in driving or operating machinery. Residual sedative effects (hangover) were examined in four groups of 20 healthy volunteers, receiving either tablets containing valerian and hops or syrup containing valerian only or flunitrazepam or placebo; furthermore, immediate sedative effects of the two plant preparations have been examined in comparison with placebo (three groups of twelve healthy volunteers). The tests included objective measurements of cognitive psychomotor performance as well as subjective questionnaires on well-being. Tolerability was assessed from spontaneous reports of side effects and a verbal inquiry at the end of the tests. We found that objectively measurable impairment of performance on the morning after medication occurred only in the flunitrazepam group, a finding which was even more pronounced in the subjective questionnaires. In addition, 50% of the volunteers in the flunitrazepam group reported mild side effects in the inquiry at the end of the tests, compared with only 10% from the other groups. The subjective perception of sleep quality was improved in all three medication groups, when compared to placebo. Examination of acute effects of the plant remedies 1 to 2 hours after administration revealed no changes in the more important lead variables; however, a very slight impairment of vigilance after taking syrup was statistically significant as well as a retardation in the processing of complex information for the tablets. The subjective perception of effects was more pronounced (shaky legs, feeling less active). In conclusion, the residual sedative effects (hangover) observed in some earlier studies cannot be confirmed for the recommended doses of the two plant-based sleep remedies which we have examined with respect to vigilance and cognitive performance. On the contrary: our findings show improved subjective self-assessment (more alert, more active, feeling better). Hangover effects on the following morning need not be a cause for concern, which is of particular interest to car drivers; however, a slight impairment of performance during the first few hours after ingestion should be anticipated. Impairment of vigilance on the morning after ingestion of benzodiazepines, frequently reported and confirmed by our results, constitutes a potential hazard. In this situation, plant remedies such as those examined in this study should be considered as viable alternatives.", 
    "10": "One third of community-dwelling people, aged 65 years and over, experience a fall each year, and for institutionalized persons the fall frequency is 1.6 times a year. A fracture results in 5% of falls, one in five of which is a hip fracture. In view of this epidemic among the elderly it is obvious that preventive measures are needed. From the patient's history and the clinical assessment a risk of falls can be defined and this should influence decisions regarding drug treatment. Anamnestic data from relatives or neighbours can be important clues to the circumstances of a fall. Supine and standing blood pressure readings (orthostatic drop?) and testing of mobility provide relevant clinical information. To reduce the fall risk in elderly people, drug therapy should not induce daytime fatigue, sedation or drowsiness. Confusion and orthostatic blood pressure drop should be avoided. Long-term drug therapy should be modified or interrupted during acute illness. Electrolyte imbalance should be prevented.", 
    "11": "The allosteric modulation of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) and [3H]flunitrazepam binding was utilized to evaluate the actions of loreclezole at the GABAA receptor complex in the rat brain. Loreclezole was observed to allosterically inhibit the binding of [35S]TBPS in a dose-dependent manner with micromolar potency (IC50 = 1 microM). Loreclezole was found to have an additive effect on neuroactive steroid modulation of [35S]TBPS binding, but merely potentiated the effect of Ro5-4864 (4\"-chlorodiazepam) modulation of [35S]TBPS binding. These observations suggest that loreclezole modulates [35S]TBPS binding through a site independent of the neuroactive steroid and Ro5-4864 sites on the GABAA receptor complex. The enhancement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding to the benzodiazepine receptor by loreclezole as well as the effect of loreclezole on CL218872/[3H]flunitrazepam dose-response curves suggest that loreclezole does not act through the benzodiazepine site on the GABAA receptor complex, nor does it selectively modulate benzodiazepine receptor subtypes. The potency of loreclezole as and inhibitor of [35S]TBPS binding in rat brain was regionally dependent and GABA-sensitive. Loreclezole modulation of [35S]TBPS binding showed greater potency and GABA sensitivity in the cerebellum and thalamus when compared to other brain regions such as the cortex, hippocampus and striatum. This finding is consistent with previous reports of the selectivity of loreclezole for GABAA receptor complex's containing beta 2 and beta 3 subunits. These beta subunit isoforms predominate in the cerebellum and thalamus. Collectively the evidence suggests that loreclezole modulates [35S]TBPS and [3H]flunitrazepam binding through a site distinct from benzodiazepine, neuroactive steroid, Ro5-4864 and GABA sites on the GABAA receptor complex.",

The separation was achieved in 2 min using a 20 cm long, 4.6 mm diameter Lichrosorb C18 reverse phase column. A 5 mul solution mixture containing 10 ppm of each drug was injected into a mobile phase containing 89:11 v/v acetonitrile: acetate buffer and a flow rate of 3.44 ml min(-1) was found to be optimal. The method was found to be suitable for the determination of these compounds in proprietary drugs without suffering interferences.",

    "15": "The objectives of this study were to describe the serum concentration time profile for midazolam following intranasal administration to adult dental surgery patients and to ascertain the effect of midazolam on anxiety. Six female patients received a single 20 mg (0.32 to 0.53 mg/kg) dose of midazolam. Blood samples were collected at 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min following dose administration. Midazolam plasma concentrations were determined by gas chromatography. Anxiety was evaluated using a 100-mm visual analogue scale. The maximum concentration of midazolam was reached 25.8 min (range 18 to 35 min) following dose administration. Maximum concentrations were variable. However, there was no relationship between the weight-adjusted dose and maximal concentration. Patients experiencing baseline anxiety exhibited a trend toward reduction in their measured anxiety score (P = 0.06). Plasma concentrations above the hypothesized minimum effective concentration for sedative effects were attained when midazolam was administered intranasally to adult dental patients.", 
    "16": "In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients without lesions, major hippocampal sclerosis, or atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the localizing power of [11C]flumazenil (FMZ) and 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) was compared using high-resolution positron emission tomography (PET) studies and individually coregistered MRI scans. Following complete clinical, neuropsychological, and electrophysiological evaluation, benzodiazepine receptor density was assessed using the FMZ equilibrium method. Thirty minutes later, interictal FDG-PET was performed under resting conditions. PET images were matched to three-dimensionally coregistered, T1-weighted MRI. Each temporal lobe (TL) was divided into 12 volumes of interest. The regional FMZ data were normalized with respect to average cortical values. For each patient the right-left asymmetries of rCMRGlc and normalized FMZ data were calculated. In 7 to 10 patients, mesial TL structures showed reduced FMZ binding, with a decrease by at least 10% in the affected TL. Reductions of 10% or more of rCMRGlc usually were more widespread than FMZ reductions and often involved lateral temporal cortex. The regions of most pronounced disturbances are not necessarily identical in both methods. Three patients had a complex correspondence of lateralization with PET, neuropsychological, and EEG data. In 4 patients, lateralization was less clear from EEG or neuropsychological results but was still consistent with lateralization by PET. In 3 of 10 patients, however, major discrepancies were found. These data suggest that the combination of neuropsychological testing, EEG, and MRI-guided FMZ- and FDG-PET will help to select patients with clearly defined epileptogenic foci especially in mesial TLE. Even in cases without MRI lesions, TL epileptic foci can be lateralized with consistency across the methods; FMZ-PET shows the pathologic focus more circumscribed than FDG-PET.", 
    "17": "This paper discusses the use of psychological performance tests to assess the effects of environmental stressors. The large number and the variety of performance tests are illustrated, and the differences between performance tests and other psychological tests are described in terms of their design, construction, use, and purpose. The stressor emphasis is on the effects of drugs since that is where most performance tests have found their main application, although other stressors, e.g., fatigue, toxic chemicals, are mentioned where appropriate. Diazepam is used as an example. There is no particular performance emphasis since the tests are intended to have wide applicability. However, vehicle-driving performance is discussed because it has been the subject of a great deal of research and is probably one of the most important areas of application. Performance tests are discussed in terms of the four main underlying models--factor analysis, general information processing, multiple resource and strategy models, and processing-stage models--and in terms of their psychometric properties--sensitivity, reliability, and content, criterion, construct, and face validity. Some test taxonomies are presented. Standardization is also discussed with reference to the reaction time, mathematical processing, memory search, spatial processing, unstable tracking, verbal processing, and dual task tests used in the AGARD STRES battery. Some comments on measurement strengths and appropriate study designs and methods are included.",

One hundred and forty-six were 1-5 years old (Group 1) and were randomised to receive either chloral 40 mg/kg, midazolam 0.2 mg/kg, promethazine 1 mg/kg, trimeprazine 3 mg/kg or placebo. Forty-five were 5-12 years old and were randomised to receive either trimeprazine 3 mg/kg, midazolam 0.2 mg/kg or placebo (Group 2). The children were assessed using four categories: asleep or drowsy, awake but calm, crying or anxious and oversedated or obstructed airway. They were assessed on leaving the ward, at separation from the parents, at induction, in the recovery room and one and two hours after returning to the ward. In Group 1, it was found that chloral and trimeprazine gave the best degree of sedation but the sedative effect of trimeprazine lasted longer into the post operative period. In Group 2, it was found that the children did not require deep sedation and the anxiolysis obtained with midazolam was adequate.",

    "25": "Muscarinic receptor regulation of synaptic transmission in guinea pig bronchial parasympathetic ganglia was evaluated with the use of intracellular recording of the intrinsic ganglion neurons. Methacholine (1 microM) decreased the amplitude of vagus nerve-stimulated fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) by 33 and 46% (at 0.8 and 8.0 Hz, respectively) but had no effect on the amplitude of the depolarizations evoked by a bath-applied nicotinic receptor agonist. Methoctramine (1 microM) inhibited methacholine's effect on fEPSP but alone did not influence the magnitude of the fEPSP evoked by vagus nerve stimulation. Methacholine (10 microM) depolarized a subpopulation of neurons (approximately 4 mV), which was blocked by pirenzepine (0.1 microM). In other neurons, either no effect or a small (1-5 mV) hyperpolarization was noted. Cholinergic contractions of bronchial smooth muscle elicited by electrical field stimulation were potentiated by methoctramine to the same extent as those evoked by vagus nerve (preganglionic) stimulation. The data indicate that M2 receptor activation can lead to inhibition of presynaptic acetylcholine release and consequently a significant inhibition of synaptic transmission in bronchial parasympathetic ganglia. The physiological role of this neuromodulatory effect appears limited, however, when studied in the in vitro setting.", 
    "26": "A review of recently published studies on the effect of cognition enhancers in non-demented human study participants is presented. The heterogeneity of the therapeutic target, age-associated cognitive decline, can be improved by separately treating groups in whom age-extrinsic factors may underlie cognitive pathology. Standardisation of cognitive assessments is necessary, since many different tests are applied to answer the same question. Modelling cognitive dysfunction, either by pharmacological or nonpharmacological means, in humans is highly recommended since it allows hypotheses to be tested in a clearly operationalised way. Predictive validity of the currently applied models for the clinical situation remains a problem, however. The scopolamine (hyoscine) model has, to a reasonable extent, predictive validity for the cholinergic agents. The results of 67 single-dose studies and 30 multiple-dose studies are summarised. All single-dose studies and 14 multiple-dose studies were carried out in young or elderly human volunteers. In 45 of 81 volunteer studies, models of cognitive dysfunction were employed. The scopolamine model was the most used (n = 21); the other studies induced cognitive dysfunction by means of benzodiazepines (8), hypoxia (7), alcohol (5) and sleep-deprivation (4). The remaining 16 multiple-dose studies were clinical trials of a duration varying between 2 weeks and 1 year (average duration was 14 weeks). In these trials, the effects of cognition enhancers were assessed in elderly people in whom impairment of memory, psychomotor performance or cognitive function was determined. These included age-associated memory impairment (AAMI) and age-associated cognitive decline (AACD). There were many studies in which the cognition enhancing properties of substances in humans were reliably demonstrated. The cognition enhancing properties of substances that are widely used, such as caffeine, nicotine and vitamins, may already be active against AACD. New developments such as serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine3; 5-HT3) antagonists and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists have provided marginal and disappointing results in AAMI. There is no cognition enhancer that has reliably and repeatedly been demonstrated to be efficacious for the treatment of AACD. However, this situation may change as the selectivity, specificity and adverse effect profiles of substances that are being developed for the treatment of AD may be expected to be improved in the future.", 
    "27": "The single dose kinetics of zotepine, and effects of smoking and cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) on the kinetics, together with pharmacokinetic interaction between zotepine and diazepam were investigated. 1) The pharmacokinetics of zotepine was investigated in 14 healthy volunteers, and was compared between 7 extensive metabolizers (EM) and 7 poor metabolizers (PM) of CYP2C19 or between 8 smokers (S) and 6 non-smokers (NS). 2) In 17 patients treated with zotepine alone, intraindividual changes in the plasma concentrations of zotepine before and after coadministration of diazepam were examined. The time of the maximal plasma concentration and the elimination half-life of zotepine in 14 volunteers were about 4 hours and 21 hours, respectively, which were found to be much longer than previously reported data. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters between the EM and PM groups or between the S and NS groups. The plasma concentrations of zotepine were significantly increased after coadministration of diazepam. Consequently, it is suggested that smoking does not affect the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of zotepine, and that the metabolism of zotepine is not mediated by CYP2C19. Elevation in the plasma concentrations of zotepine after coadministration of diazepam may be caused by the inhibitory effect of diazepam on zotepine metabolism. As a plausible explanation for this, the metabolism of zotepine and diazepam may be commonly mediated not by CYP2C19 but by cytochrome P450 3A4, and the pharmacokinetic interactions may result from competitive inhibition between these two drugs.", 
    "28": "The objective of this study was to test the interspecies-scaling approach in a series of antiepileptic drugs. Clearance, volume of distribution, and elimination half-life were scaled up from animal data obtained from literature. Four different methods were utilized to generate plots to scale up the clearance values: (i) clearance vs body weight (simple allometric equation); (ii) the product of clearance and maximum life-span potential (MLP) vs body weight (an approach recommended in literature); (iii) the two-term power equation which incorporates both body weight and brain weight suggested by Boxenbaum; and (iv) the product of clearance and brain weight vs body weight (a new approach being introduced in this study). When the predicted values for clearance were qualitatively compared with the observed values in humans, it was found that our proposed method predicted the clearance better than the other three methods. Using the simple allometric equation, the prediction of volume of distribution as a function of body weight was found to be satisfactory. The elimination half-life could not be predicted from simple allometric equations for any of the drugs studied; however, utilizing the equation CL = VK, prediction for half-life was feasible. The results of this study indicate that it is possible to predict reliably the pharmacokinetic parameters of these antiepileptic drugs in humans from animal data using an allometric approach.", 
    "29": "A very common though very often neglected problem is the anxiety among hospitalized patients. A group of nurses of the Matera hospital tried to quantify the prevalence of such a problem collecting data on patients treated during the hospital stay, admitted or discharged with a prescription of tranquillizers. Over 941 patients observed, 59 (6.2%) were treated with benzodiazepines, neuroleptics or antidepressants, the prevalence being higher in the medical wards (8.9%) than in the surgical ones (4.5%). The problem most commonly treated in the medical wards is the anxiety and the insomnia in the surgical wards. The most frequently prescribed drugs (47 patients, 79.6%) are the benzodiazepines. This is one of the first attempts to quantify the prevalence of anxiety in an hospital population. Although number of patients treated is limited the overall management of anxiety can be improved.", 
    "30": "Drugs acting on the benzodiazepine site of GABA(A) receptors are much safer than barbiturates, but are still liable to abuse. Recently, we have reported that a benzodiazepine site agonist, U-97775 (a dihydroimidazoquinoxaline analog), may have minimal abuse liability because of its interaction with a second, low-affinity site on GABA(A) receptors, the occupancy of which, at high drug concentrations, leads to a reversal of its agonistic activity on the benzodiazepine site and inhibition of GABA-induced Cl- currents [Br. J. Pharmacol. 115 (1995)19-24]. Here we report that U-101017 (7-chloro-5[(cis-3,5-dimethylpiperazine)carbonyl]imidazo[1,5a]quinoline- 3-carboxylate) is another similar benzodiazepine site agonist possessing the ability to reverse its agonistic activity at higher concentrations, but its ability to inhibit GABA currents is considerably milder than that of U-97775. In the alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 subtype where these drugs have no agonistic activity, for instance, U-101017 at concentrations up to 80 mu M, showed no appreciable effect on GABA currents, whereas U-97775 inhibited the currents with an IC(50) value of 10 mu M as measured with the whole cell patch clamp techniques in human embryonic kidney cells expressing recombinant receptors. Similar, milder inhibition of GABA currents by U-101017 was observed in the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 and alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 2 subtypes. Furthermore, U-101017 was of higher efficacy in the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 than alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 2 subtypes as compared to diazepam, although its binding affinity was not appreciably different in the two subtypes. We conclude that U-101017 is a partial benzodiazepine agonist, somewhat selective to the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 subtype, and with the ability to limit its own agonistic activity over a wide range of doses through its interaction with the low affinity site, but without potential convulsant activity, inherent to agents which block GABA currents.", 
    "31": "This paper presents the results of a survey carried out to investigate the benzodiazepine (BZD) prescribing patterns of the general practitioners (GP) in the catchment area of a Drug Dependence Unit located in a general hospital in Mataro (Barcelona, Spain). The aims of the survey were: (i) to obtain descriptive information on the knowledge of the GPs about BZD and its potential for dependence; (ii) to study the frequency of their prescribing; and (iii) to examine different factors linked to their prescribing. The study was carried out using a combination of a personal interview and a self-administered questionnaire. A total of 68 doctors (88.3%) completed the questionnaire. The results show that the GPs have, in general, correct knowledge about the therapeutic indications for BZD prescribing, but are far less aware of their potential to induce dependence and how to manage withdrawal. The rate of prescribing seems to be high. Furthermore, the results of the external check of validity point out that doctors tend to underestimate the number of prescriptions. The majority of GPs express the need for alternative resources to BZD prescribing. No significant associations have been found between doctor's characteristics, such as postgraduate training and type of practice, and their knowledge about BZD and frequency of their prescribing. In our view, a more accurate knowledge about BZD and alternatives to its use, both factors closely linked to training, together with the availability of non-pharmacological resources, are likely to improve the quality of doctors prescribing habits, thus preventing risks such as dependence of BZD.", 
    "32": "1. Tetrazepam (TZP) suppressed rat and guinea-pig tracheal tone by 100% and there was no difference in the relaxant effects against tone induced by 120 mM K+, carbachol (0.5 microM) or histamine (100 microM). 2. In trachealis pretreated with propranolol (1 microM), the relaxant response to TZP was unaltered. 3. TZP (10 microM) added to the relaxant effect of isoprenaline in tissues precontracted with carbachol. 4. The relaxant effect of TZP appears to be unrelated to peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) because pretreatment with PK 11195 (1 microM) did not modify its effect. 5. Diltiazem (a calcium antagonist) was capable of relaxing the KCl (120 mM) or carbachol (0.5 microM) precontracted trachea, although at a different dose range than that of TZP. 6. The tracheal relaxation by TZP may be due to competition at some point in the chain of events linking carbachol, K+ or histamine to contraction, interacting with one of the transduction pathways, probably Ca2+. This inhibition of contraction is not related to the high-affinity PBRS.", 
    "33": "The population approach is a general term covering different aspects of kinetic and dynamic data collected mainly from drug-treated patients and new techniques allowing evaluation of sparse observations from each subject. Such data originate from clinically relevant conditions and can give information on several qualities of a drug. An example is given with the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline for which the kinetics and the concentration-effect relationship have been thoroughly documented previously with conventional techniques. We have evaluated retrospective data from a therapeutic drug monitoring service using a nonparametric population kinetic method (NPML) that allows description of kinetic outliers and nonlinear relationships between kinetic parameters and covariates. In addition, drug interactions, nonlinear kinetics and dosing habits were studied with other techniques corroborating previous results and adding new information. The concentration-effect relationship could not be evaluated from our data as information on efficacy and adverse effects was of too low quality. However, several controlled studies have defined a therapeutic concentration interval and a discussion on dosing strategies is based on this interval. Collection of sparse data in patients during phases II-IV of drug development as a complement to conventional studies is highly recommendable.", 
    "34": "Flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) is a benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic that has generated significant media attention in the United States because of its abuse and its association with \"date rape.\" A field investigation was conducted in south Texas to ascertain the nature and consequences of the abuse of flunitrazepam. In semistructured interviews, 66 subjects identified as flunitrazepam users were asked about their use of alcohol and other drugs and their sexual behaviors. Many subjects identified the drugs they had used as \"roches\" and gave descriptions of tablets of other benzodiazepines that were not consistent with flunitrazepam. Almost all subjects used other drugs, primarily alcohol and marijuana. Adverse consequences included amnesia, discoordination, automobile accidents, sexual assault, and respiratory depression or arrest. A significant proportion of the subjects reported that continued use was unappealing to them. The abuse of sedative-hypnotics in southeast Texas involves several benzodiazepines and is not limited to flunitrazepam.", 
    "35": "Bilateral vocal cord abductor paralysis (VCAP) is frequently associated with multiple system atrophy (MSA) and the early clinical manifestation of VCAP is nocturnal inspiratory stridor simulating heavy snoring observed in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. We examined six MSA patients with nocturnal stridor and four disease controls including sleep apnea syndrome. Vocal cord movements were analyzed by laryngofiberscopy during both wakefulness and sleep induced by intravenous administration of diazepam. The results were as follows: First, the stenotic portion in the upper airway tract was the larynx (the vocal cords) in MSA patients with stridor, while the soft palate or the pharynx in the disease controls. Second, in the MSA patients, while awake-laryngofiberscopy showed abduction restriction suggestive of VCAP in only one of the six patients, sleep-laryngofiberscopy showed obvious paradoxical movement of the vocal cord in all the rests, where the vocal cords abducted in expiration and adducted in inspiration. In addition, there were two patterns in the inspiratory vocal cord position during sleep: one pattern where vocal glottis was still opening at the posterior one-third area and the other pattern where vocal glottis was almost completely closed through total length of the cords. Tracheostomy should be considered in the latter stage of VCAP.", 
    "36": "The effects of Vietnamese ginseng (VG) and its major constituent majonoside-R2 on pentobarbital-induced sleep and gastric lesion in psychologically stressed mice were examined. Psychological stress exposure for 30 min significantly decreased the duration of pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, IP)-induced sleep in mice. VG extract (50 mg/kg, PO), VG saponin (25 mg/kg, PO), and majonoside-R2 (3.1-12.5 mg/kg, PO and IP) had no effect on pentobarbital sleep in unstressed control mice, but these drugs significantly recovered pentobarbital sleep decreased by psychological stress to the level of unstressed control animals. On the other hand, Panax ginseng (PG) extract (50-100 mg/kg, PO) failed to affect pentobarbital sleep in psychologically stressed mice. The effect of majonoside-R2 on psychological stress-induced decrease in the hypnotic activity of pentobarbital was significantly blocked by flumazenil (1 mg/kg, IV), a selective benzodiazepine antagonist. Diazepam (0.1 mg/kg, IP) significantly prolonged pentobarbital sleep in unstressed and psychologically stressed groups, and the effect of diazepam was significantly attenuated by the same dose of flumazenil. Naloxone (0.5-5 mg/kg, IP), an opioid antagonist, had no effect on pentobarbital sleep in unstressed or psychologically stressed animals. Psychological stress exposure for 16 h caused gastric lesion in mice. VG extract (25-50 mg/kg, PO) and majonoside-R2 (6.2-12.5 mg/kg, PO), as well as diazepam and naloxone, produced the protective action on gastric lesion in psychologically stressed mice. These results suggest that VG and its major constituent majonoside-R2 have the protective effects on the psychological stress-induced pathophysiological changes and that benzodiazepine receptors are partly implicated in the effects of majonoside-R2.", 
    "37": "Our previous study showed that conditioned fear stress (CFS) increased serotonin (5-HT) metabolism in the medial prefrontal cortex and induced freezing behavior. Although these results could support the 5-HT hypothesis of anxiety, the functional significance of the 5-HT response to stress is unclear. In this study, the effects of 5-HT reuptake inhibitors, agonists, antagonists, and diazepam on freezing behavior induced by CFS were examined using a time-sampling procedure. Various doses of test compounds were administered subcutaneously to rats 24 h after the last session of repeated foot-shock for 5 days. Rats were again placed in the shock chamber without shocks 20 min after injections of drugs, and observed. Diazepam (1 mg/kg) and the 5-HT1A agonist ipsapirone (0.5-10 mg/kg) significantly inhibited freezing behavior. L-5-Hydroxytryptophan (with benserazide) and the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor citalopram (10 mg/kg) reduced freezing behavior. The 5-HT2 antagonists ICI169,369 and ketanserin failed to change freezing behavior. p-Chlorophenylalanine (200 mg/kg) administered 15 h before the test did not affect freezing. The effect of ipsapirone was not modified in rats with lesions of 5-HT neurons, produced by p-chloroamphetamine (2 x 10 mg/kg). In conclusion, these results suggest the anxiolytic potential of ipsapirone and citalopram, and support the hypothesis that the facilitation of 5-HT neurotransmission decreases anxiety.", 
    "38": "Like benzodiazepines receptor (BDZR) ligands, 3 alpha-hydroxylated, 5 alpha, or 5 beta pregnane steroids are sedative, anticonvulsant, and anxiolytic. BDZR ligands also modulate the feeding response. Therefore, in this study we have investigated the effects of four 3 alpha-hydroxylated pregnane steroids-Pregnanolone (3 alpha-hydroxy-5 beta-pregnan-20-one), allopregnanolone (3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one), alphaxalone (3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-11,20-dione), and 5 beta-pregnanediol (5 beta-pregnan-3 alpha,20 alpha-diol) on food intake. In non-food deprived male rats, all four steroids increased the consumption of a palatable diet. For pregnanolone (1-10 mg/kg), hyperphagia was found at lower doses than its anxiolytic effect (5-10 mg/kg) as determined using the elevated plus maze test. The presumed steroid antagonists, isopregnanolone (3 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one) (10 mg/kg) and pregnenolone sulfate (2 mg/kg), and the BDZ antagonist, Ro15-1788 (20 mg/kg), did not reverse the hyperphagic effect of pregnanolone. Picrotoxin, a GABAA receptor antagonist, dose dependently and at a subconvulsive dose (1.5 mg/kg), reversed the hyperphagic effect of pregnanolone and alphaxalone, but had no effect on allopregnanolone- and 5 beta-pregnanediol-induced hyperphagia. These results indicate that the hyperphagic effects of pregnanolone and alphaxalone are mediated by the GABAA receptor but not by direct interaction with BDZ receptors. However, allopregnanolone- and 5 beta-pregnanediol-induced hyperphagia may be mediated by other receptor systems. Because some 3 alpha-hydroxylated pregnane steroids are endogenous progesterone metabolites, they may play an important role in appetite control.", 
    "39": "The effects of acutely administered diazepam and the beta-carboline abecarnil were examined in two animal models of anxiety in rats, and for their effects on food intake and locomotor activity. In the elevated x-maze diazepam (0.6-2.5 mg/kg) and abecarnil (0.03-0.3 mg/kg) induced anxiolytic-like effects. The second paradigm is based upon the suppression of feeding by exposure to a novel environment, adapted from Bodnoff et al. (1989). Food-deprived rats were placed in a corner of the open field containing food in the centre. The number of rats beginning to eat in the first 5 min was recorded. Diazepam (2.5-5.0 mg/kg) and abecarnil (0.01-0.3 mg/kg) increased the number of rats eating. Flumazenil, the benzodiazepine antagonist, was without effect, but antagonised the effects of diazepam and abecarnil. In a seperate series of experiments the effects of diazepam and abecarnil on feeding and locomotor activity were excluded as having influenced the the anxiolytic effects of these compounds in the animal models of anxiety.", 
    "40": "The objective was to compile data on therapeutic approaches employed in palliative care in Australia, including practices relating to combining drugs in syringe drivers for administration by subcutaneous infusion. A questionnaire, with a reply-paid envelope, was sent to 130 teaching hospitals and palliative care services throughout Australia. Ninety-six responses were received (74% response rate). Drugs commonly administered in palliative care included oral morphine (97% of respondents), subcutaneous morphine (76%), oral metoclopramide (82%), subcutaneous metoclopramide (41%), oral dexamethasone (70%), oral haloperidol (50%), subcutaneous haloperidol (43%), oral prochlorperazine (47%), oral codeine (38%) and subcutaneous midazolam (36%). Drugs frequently combined in syringe drivers for subcutaneous infusion included morphine plus metoclopramide (67%), morphine plus midazolam (66%), and all three of these drugs (35%). Only 48% of the palliative care services had a policy on combining drugs in syringe drivers for administration by subcutaneous infusion and 34% had an upper limit on the number of drugs combined in syringe drivers. Twenty-nine per cent of respondents had encountered problems (e.g. incompatibilities) when combining drugs in syringe drivers for administration by subcutaneous infusion. This study has revealed considerable variation in the practice of therapeutics and the combining of drugs in syringe drivers for administration by subcutaneous infusion in palliative care.", 
    "41": "Recent experimental evidence has suggested that peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) may play a role in epilepsy and antiepileptic drug action. Since PBR are also present in circulating lymphocytes, and may interact with anticonvulsant drugs, this study was designed to look for possible modifications of these receptors and their endogenous ligand diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) in the lymphocytes of epileptic patients treated with various drugs. PBR levels were 50% to 80% higher in patients treated with carbamazepine, phenobarbital and valproic acid than in controls and untreated epileptics. DBI levels were significantly increased in the lymphocytes of untreated patients, and showed only a slight further increase after anticonvulsant therapy. The possibility that PBR and DBI modifications in the lymphocytes of epileptic patients may be linked to the immunological alterations reported in these patients and/or may represent possible markers of neurochemical modifications in the central nervous system is discussed.", 
    "42": "Tomaymycin reacts covalently with guanine in the DNA minor groove, exhibiting considerable specificity for the flanking bases. The sequence dependence of tomaymycin bonding to DNA was investigated in synthetic DNA oligomers and polymers. The maximum extent of bonding to DNA is greater for homopurine and natural DNA sequences than for alternating purine-pyrimidine sequences. Saturation of DNA with tomaymycin has little effect on the melting temperature in the absence of unbound drug. Fluorescence lifetimes were measured for DNA adducts at seven of the ten unique trinucleotide bonding sites. Most of the adducts had two fluorescence lifetimes, representing two of the four possible binding modes. The lifetimes cluster around 2-3 ns and 5-7 ns; the longer lifetime is the major component for most bonding sites. The two lifetime classes were assigned to R and S diastereomeric adducts by comparison with previous NMR results for oligomer adducts. The lifetime difference between binding modes is interpreted in terms of an anomeric effect on the excited-state proton transfer reaction that quenches tomaymycin fluorescence. Bonding kinetics of polymer adducts were monitored by fluorescence lifetime measurements. Rates of adduct formation vary by two orders of magnitude with poly(dA-dG).poly(dC-dT), reacting the fastest at 4 x 10(-2) M-1 s-1. The sequence specificity of tomaymycin is discussed in light of these findings and other reports in the literature.", 
    "43": "Neuroimaging techniques have had a dramatic impact on the evaluation and treatment of patients with epilepsy. In order to take full advantage of their potential, it is important to place them in clinical and electrophysiological context and to understand their technical limitations. Positron emission tomography with 18F-2-deoxyglucose and single photon emission computed tomography can provide valuable data for presurgical localization of epileptogenic zones. Interictal cerebral blood flow studies, however, using either positron emission tomography or simple photon emission computed tomography are unreliable. Positron emission tomography cerebral blood flow activation studies, on the other hand, are becoming very useful for presurgical cognitive mapping and may be able to replace the intracarotid amytal test for language and memory lateralization. There are a number of receptor ligands available for both positron emission tomography and simple photon emission computed tomography studies, including benzodiazepine, opiate, and cholinergic tracers. Increased mu opiate, decreased benzodiazepine, and increased monoamine oxidase B receptor binding have been reported.", 
    "44": "[125I]- and [123I]NNC 13-8241 were prepared from the trimethyltin precursor and radioactive iodide using the chloramine-T method. The total radiochemical yields of [125I]- and [123I]NNC 13-8241 were 60-70% and 40-50% respectively, with radiochemical purity higher than 98%. In binding studies with [125I]NNC 13-8241 in rats in vitro and in vivo a high uptake of radioactivity was demonstrated in brain regions known to have a high density of benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors such as the occipital and frontal cortex. SPECT examination with [123I]NNC 13-8241 in a Cynomolgus monkey demonstrated a high uptake of radioactivity in the occipital and frontal cortex. After displacement with flumazenil radioactivity in these brain regions was reduced to the level of a central region including the pons. Four hours after injection about 80% of the radioactivity in monkey plasma represented unchanged radioligand. This low degree of metabolism indicates that NNC 13-8241 is metabolically more stable than the radioligands hitherto developed for imaging of BZ-receptors in the primate brain.",

We have developed a policy on sedation which we believe could result in many more patients electively choosing to have the procedure without sedation, resulting in potential savings on cost and manpower.", 
    "49": "The effect of a socially dominant hamster on the self-stimulation behavior of the subordinate hamster was examined. After determining social ranking, six hamsters were trained to press a lever in an operant chamber in which a dominant hamster was presented over a grid wall. The threshold of rewarding effect was evaluated by using a descending series of current intensity as electrical reward. When a dominant hamster was present, the subordinate hamster showed a shift of intensity-response function to the right (higher intensity). The presence of a subordinate hamster did not influence the response in dominant hamsters. Furthermore, beta-carboline (FG-7142) (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg, IP) caused a decrease in rewarding effect in dose-dependant manner. These results suggest that the presence of a dominant animal may have caused \"a state of anxiety\" somewhat similar to the anxiety caused by the benzodiazepine inverse agonist.", 
    "50": "Midazolam, a potent short-acting benzodiazepine, is a safe and highly effective agent for the control of status epilepticus. Its efficacy in the control of neonatal seizures, however, has not been determined. Six neonates (aged 1-9 days; gestation, 30-41 weeks) developed seizures from a variety of causes. In each case, seizures persisted for > 12 h despite high-dose phenobarbital therapy with or without the addition of phenytoin. Midazolam was then administered by continuous intravenous infusion (0.1-0.4 mg/kg/h) for 1 to 3 days. Within 1 h of initiation of midazolam, seizures were controlled in all six neonates. Electroencephalographic seizures were abolished in four of six neonates; however, two neonates continued to have electrographic seizures (without clinical accompaniment) for a further 12 h. Blood pressure and pulse rate were not changed after the initiation of midazolam, and adverse reactions were not observed in any neonate. Because more than one third of all neonatal seizures are refractory to high-dose phenobarbital and phenytoin, midazolam administered by continuous intravenous infusion may be a valuable adjunctive therapy.", 
    "51": "1. This study compared two hypnotics administrated at comparable therapeutic dosages: triazolam (0.25 mg) and loprazolam (1 mg), were administered using an original scheme (cross-over on the first 2 nights, and continuation of the preferred treatment or new randomization). 2. Sixty-seven outpatients complaining of common insomnia participated in this study conducted by general practitioners. 3. Both drugs provided improvement in sleep quality (decreased sleep latency, increased total duration of sleep, decreased number of night awakenings), and are equally well tolerated. 4. For the first 2 nights, triazolam was evaluated to be more efficient than loprazolam (p < 0.001), and patients felt more rested the following day (p < 0.01) with the former drug. Moreover, triazolam is more frequently preferred than loprazolam by 47.7% and 29.2%, respectively, (p = 0.09). 5.

    "52": "The interaction between morphine and L740,093, a newly developed highly potent antagonist of cholecystokinin-B receptors, was examined in electrophysiological and behavioural studies. Intravenous L740,093 at 0.01 mg/kg had no effect on its own, but significantly potentiated the depressive effect of 1 mg/kg morphine on the nociceptive flexor reflex in decerebrate, spinalized rats. Similarly, subcutaneous L740, 093 at 0.03 mg/kg significantly prolonged the duration of antinociception induced by 10 mg/kg morphine in the rat hotplate test. A bell shaped dose-response curve was noted in the behavioural studies with respect to the interaction between L740,094 and morphine. L740,093, which has excellent CNS penetration, may represent a new tool in studying the involvement of the endogenous cholecystokinin system in the modulation of opioid analgesia and in exploring novel analgesics.", 
    "53": "1. Tardive dyskinesia is more important in postmenopausal women than men of comparable age and a peak of first episodes of schizophrenia is observed in postmenopausal women. The effect of ovariectomy (2 weeks or 3 months) in rats was investigated as a model of decreased gonadal function associated with menopause. 2. Frontal cortex D1 receptor density and affinity were similar in intact male compared to intact female rats and progressively decreased in density with time after ovariectomy, with no change of affinity. Striatal D1 and D2 receptors also decreased in density after ovariectomy for both receptor subtypes, with no change of affinity. Striatal D1 receptor density and affinity were similar in intact male and female rats, whereas the density of D2 receptors was higher in females. Treatment with estradiol for 2 weeks restored the D2 but not the D1 receptor changes. 3. In the substantia nigra pars reticulata, striatum, nucleus accumbens, and entopeduncular nucleus, a progressive increase in [3H]flunitrazepam specific binding associated with GABAA receptors was observed as a function of time following ovariectomy; this was corrected with estradiol treatment. In contrast, the opposite was observed for [3H] flunitrazepam binding in the globus pallidus, where ovariectomy decreased binding, which was corrected with estradiol replacement therapy. 4. Low prefrontal cortex dopamine activity with implications of D1 receptors in negative symptoms of schizophrenia is hypothesized. Furthermore, GABAergic overactivity in the internal globus pallidus-substantia nigra pars reticulata complex is hypothesized in tardive dyskinesia. 5. The present data suggest that gonadal hormone withdrawal by reducing brain dopamine receptors and producing an imbalance of GABAA receptors in the output pathways of the striatum may predispose to schizophrenia and dyskinesia.", 
    "54": "A significant increase in the number of measurable [3H]Ro 5-4864 receptors was found in forebrain membranes of chicks submitted to 15 min of acute swim stress compared to non-stressed chicks. In addition, low subsolubilizing concentrations of Triton X-100 caused a significant increase in the measurable [3H]Ro 5-4864 receptor number in forebrain membranes from non-stressed chicks. However, this increase caused by Triton X-100 was not observed when tested in forebrain membranes from stressed chicks. In all cases the affinity remained unchanged. These results suggest that: (1) acute stress and Triton X-100 induce receptor increase by enhancing [3H]Ro 5-4864 accessibility to a pool of receptors not detected before stress or in the absence of detergent; (2) the pool of non-measured receptors represents about a third of the total in control chicks; (3) the increments are not additive and could involve receptors coming from the same non-measured pool; (4) the receptor increase during a short time of stress could be explained by recruitment of receptors but not by an increase in the receptor protein biosynthesis; (5) stress induces a maximal recruitment of measurable [-3H]Ro 5-4864 receptors.", 
    "55": "The effect of the short-acting benzodiazepine lorazepam on motor cortex excitability was investigated in 11 healthy volunteers using the technique of focal transcranial magnetic stimulation. The threshold intensity for evoking an electromyographic response in the resting and active abductor digiti minimi muscle, the size of the motor evoked potential, the duration of the cortical and peripheral silent periods, the corticocortical inhibition and facilitation after paired magnetic stimuli, and the transcallosal inhibition were used as parameters to assess various aspects of motor system excitability. Baseline values were compared with data obtained 2, 5 and 24 h after a single oral dose of 2.5 mg lorazepam. Resting and active motor thresholds and the size of the motor evoked potential remained unchanged. The duration of the cortical silent period was prolonged with a maximum effect 5 h after drug intake, while the peripheral silent period did not show any lengthening at that time. The corticocortical inhibition showed a tendency toward more inhibition, while the corticocortical facilitation was almost completely suppressed. The transcallosal inhibition showed an inconsistent trend to less inhibition. In parallel to the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam, all effects peaked at 2 h and 5 h, and were (partially) reversible after 24 h. It is hypothesized that most of these findings are due to the reinforcement of GABA action by lorazepam at the level of the motor cortex. The lack of effect on motor threshold and on the size of the motor evoked potential may indicate that these parameters are physiologically distinct from corticocortical excitability and the cortical silent period. The relevance of the present data in clinical epileptology is discussed.", 
    "56": "The behavioral effects of a wide range of BZ (omega) receptor ligands, including non-selective full (alprazolam, clorazepate, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam) and partial (bretazenil, imidazenil and Ro 19-8022) agonists, and selective BZ-1 (omega 1) (abecarnil, CL 218,872, CL 284,846 and zolpidem) receptor ligands, were compared in the rat elevated plus-maze test. Behaviors recorded comprised the traditional indices of anxiety as well as a number of ethologically derived measures. In addition, the specificity of drug effects was evaluated by measuring spontaneous locomotor activity in activity cages in separate groups of animals. Results showed that all compounds tested not only increased the proportion of time spent and proportion of entries into the open arms of the maze (considered as traditional indices of anxiety) but also affected head-dippings and attempts at entry into open arms, which can be considered as indices of risk assessment responses. However, the magnitude of these effects was generally smaller with the BZ-1 (omega 1) selective agents. Moreover, additional differences were apparent on the total number of arm entries measure, which was significantly increased by most full and all partial agonists, but was unaffected by the selective BZ-1 (omega 1) compounds. If it is assumed that total arm entries are contaminated by anxiety, the latter finding indicates a weaker anxiety-reducing potential of selective BZ-1 (omega 1) ligands. Importantly, the increase in total arm entries induced by the non-selective agents was not associated with a similar effect on locomotion as revealed in the actimeter. Finally, anxiolysis produced by the BZ-1 (omega 1) ligands was invariably observed at doses which reduced locomotor activity, suggesting that the anxiolytic-like effects of these compounds are confounded by decreases in locomotor activity.", 
    "57": "The literature on the effects of CCK receptor manipulations in animal models of anxiety is rife with inconsistency, and the data subject to a variety of methodological and interpretative difficulties. In the present paper, the effects of a range of CCK receptor ligands on anxiety in male mice have been assessed using an ethological version of the elevated plus-maze test. Compounds selected for study were the agonists, CCK-4 and CCK-8s (12.5-100 micrograms/kg), and the antagonists, devazepide, L-365, 260 and PD 135158 (1.0 microgram/kg-1.0 mg/kg). CCK-4 failed to produce any significant behavioural effects over the dose range tested, while treatment with the sulphated octapeptide, CCK-8s, induced signs of behavioural inhibition at 100 microgram/kg without altering anxiety-related indices. Furthermore, in contrast to the clear anxiolytic profile of diazepam (1 mg/kg), and despite the comprehensive behavioural profiles yielded by ethological analysis, all three CCK receptor antagonists studied (devazepide, L-365, 260 and PD 135158) were found to be without significant effect under present test conditions. Together, present findings provide little support for the involvement of CCK receptor mechanisms in anxiety and, in particular, the form of anxiety evoked in mice by exposure to a plus-maze.", 
    "58": "Effects of chronic morphine pretreatment on the development of amygdaloid kindling, seizure suppression and benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor binding in rats were evaluated. The morphine-pretreated animals showed faster acquisition of seizure activity. Further evaluation of the postictal seizure suppression immediately after a fully kindled seizure demonstrated that morphine-pretreated rats had a decreased sensitivity to subsequent kindling stimulations. Twenty-four hours after the last electrical stimulation, saline-pretreated fully kindled rats showed enhanced BDZ receptor binding in dentate gyrus, and decreased binding in cingulate cortex ipsilateral to the stimulation site, compared to saline controls. Morphine-pretreated amygdala-kindled rats had significantly higher BDZ binding in piriform, entorhinal and sensorimotor cortices, basolateral and cortical amygdaloid nuclei, dentate gyrus, CAI-3 areas, substantia nigra pars reticulata and periaqueductal gray. The present study indicates that the previous experience with chronic morphine modifies the kindling process and that the enhanced BDZ receptor binding detected in our experiments may be involved in the enhanced postictal seizure suppression observed in these animals.", 
    "59": "We have investigated the production of diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI)-related peptides by astrocytes in primary culture and we have determined the effect of the octadecaneuropeptide DBI[33-50] (ODN) on the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in astrocytes. Immunocytochemical labeling with antibodies against ODN showed that cultured astrocytes retain their ability to synthesize DBI in vitro. Cultured astrocytes were also found to release substantial amounts of ODN-immunoreactive material, and a brief exposure of astrocytes to a depolarizing potassium concentration resulted in a 5-fold increase in the rate of release of the ODN-like peptide. Microfluorimetric measurement of [Ca2+]i with the fluorescent probe indo-1 showed that nanomolar concentrations of ODN induced a marked increase in [Ca2+]i. The stimulatory effect of ODN on [Ca2+]i was not affected by calcium channel blockers or by incubation in Ca(2+)-free medium. In contrast, thapsigargin, an inhibitor of microsomal Ca(2+)-ATPase activity, totally abolished the ODN-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. Repeated pulses of ODN caused attenuation of the response, indicating the existence of a desensitization phenomenon. Preincubation of astrocytes with pertussis toxin totally blocked the effect of ODN on [Ca2+]i. The present study indicates that ODN-related peptides are synthesized and released by glial cells. Our results also show that synthetic ODN induces calcium mobilization from an intracellular store through stimulation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. Taken together, these data suggest that endozepines act as paracrine and/or autocrine factors controlling the activity of astroglial cells.", 
    "60": "Among the CCK derivatives, the tetrapeptide Boc-Trp-Phg-Asp-Nal-NH2 (1) behaves as a short potent CCK-B agonist which led to the development of an efficient peptidase-resistant CCK-B antagonist by bismethylation of its terminal CONH2 group. Further modifications of the N- and C-terminal moieties of 1 have been performed and are described in this paper, together with the pharmacological profile of the novel synthetized compounds. Introduction of more bulky substituents than NalNH2 on the C-terminal part decreased the CCK-B receptor binding affinity. In the series of N-protected tetrapeptides X30-Phg31-Asp32-Nal33-N(CH3)2, the Boc-substituent was shown to be optimal among the N-protecting groups Boc, 2Adoc, propionyl or acetyl when X = Trp. On the other hand, when X = alpha MeTrp, its optimal N-protecting group was 2Adoc and its configuration was preferentially D. In the newly synthesized compounds, 13: 2Adoc-D-alpha MeTrp-Phg-Asp-NalN(CH3)2 and 16: 2Adoc-D-alpha MeTrp-Phg-Asp-NalNH2 had the best CCK-B receptor affinities (KI = 3.5 and 3.4 nM, respectively) and were selected for further biological evaluation. Interestingly, when tested for their capacity to influence inositol phosphate formation, induced by CCK8 in CHO cells transfected with the rat CCK-B receptor, compound 13 behaved as a full CCK-B antagonist with an IC50 value of 18 +/- 1 nM, being as potent as the antagonist L-365,260 and PD-134,308 (IC50 values respectively, 39 +/- 17 and 30 +/- 2 nM), whereas compound 16 was found to behave as a partial CCK-B agonist. Indeed 16 behaved as an antagonist on the firing rate of rat CA1 hippocampal neurons and acted as an agonist in the pentagastrin stimulated gastric acid secretion (EC50 = 12 nmol/kg) in anesthetized rats. Compound 13 in contrast, was found to inhibit the pentagastrin action at a dose (ID50 = 0.56 mumol/kg) similar to the potent antagonist PD-134,308 (ID50 = 0.4 mumol/kg). The antagonist/agonist properties of compounds 13 and 16 show that both N- and C-terminal substituents modulate the pharmacological properties in the Boc-CCK4 derivatives presented here.",

    "62": "1. Cyclothiazide blocks alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor desensitization and potentiates AMPA receptor gated currents. Interactions between cyclothiazide, and the non-competitive antagonist GYKI52466 (GYKI) and competitive antagonist 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulphamoyl-benzo (F) quinoxaline (NBQX) were studied at native and recombinant AMPA/kainate receptors using whole-cell recording in order to characterize the modulation by cyclothiazide of these two antagonist sites. 2. GYKI 100 microM, which is sufficient to eliminate virtually hippocampal kainate (100 microM) currents, failed to prevent access of cyclothiazide to its site of potentiation, and was unable to enhance removal of cyclothiazide potentiation. However, cyclothiazide reduced GYKI (30 microM) block from 84 +/- 8.3% to 38 +/- 12%, and slowed the onset of the block with a time course much faster than the time course for onset and offset of potentiation induced by cyclothiazide. Cyclothiazide had qualitatively similar effects upon antagonism by NBQX 1 microM. 3. Kainate activated desensitizing currents in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurones, which were unaffected by cyclothiazide. GYKI blocked these kainate currents with lower affinity (IC50 > 120 microM) than for hippocampal neurones (IC50 < 30 microM), and cyclothiazide did not affect GYKI antagonism. 4. Steady-state AMPA currents from homomeric GluRA-Dflip receptors in HEK 293 cells were dramatically potentiated (up to 216 fold) by cyclothiazide via reduction of desensitization. In contrast, kainate-gated currents in HEK 293 cells expressing GluR6R receptors exhibited pronounced desensitization that was unaffected by cyclothiazide. GYKI retains its inhibition at both recombinant AMPA and kainate receptors. 5. These results indicate that cyclothiazide allosterically influences two important antagonist sites on AMPA receptors. In addition, AMPA/kainate receptor subunit composition influences the affinity of GYKI for the receptor.", 
    "63": "Rats were administered either 80 escapable shocks or yoked inescapable shocks, were then injected with saline or several ataxic doses of either ethanol or midazolam, and then had their motoric impairment assessed by Rotarod performance. No motoric impairment was observed following saline injection. However, inescapable shock impaired Rotarod performance in response to both ethanol and midazolam at 2 hr, but not immediately poststress. Conversely, escapable shock reduced the ataxic potency of ethanol, although it had no influence on midazolam-induced ataxia. These results indicate functional alterations in behavioral reactivity to low doses of several classes of central nervous system depressants by psychological dynamics of stress exposure. Our findings demonstrate the impact of stress controllability on behavioral reactivity to two classes of drugs of abuse.", 
    "64": "1. The interaction between triazolam and two antifungal agents, fluconazole and terbinafine, was investigated in a double-blind, randomized crossover study of three phases. 2. Twelve healthy young volunteers received 100 mg fluconazole, 250 mg terbinafine or placebo orally once a day for 4 days. On day 4 they took a single 0.25 mg dose of triazolam. Plasma samples were collected and pharmacodynamic effects were measured up to 17 h after the intake of triazolam. 3. Fluconazole increased the area under the triazolam concentration time-curve more than twofold (P < 0.001) and prolonged the elimination half-life of triazolam nearly twofold (P < 0.001). The peak concentration of triazolam was also increased significantly (P < 0.05) by fluconazole. 4. During the fluconazole phase pharmacodynamic effects of triazolam (e.g. digit symbol substitution test, body sway and drowsiness) were enhanced significantly (P < 0.05) when compared with the placebo phase. 5. Terbinafine did not change significantly the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of triazolam. 6. Care should be taken when triazolam is prescribed to patients using fluconazole. Although the interaction is not as strong as that of triazolam with ketoconazole or itraconazole, it is clinically significant. Triazolam and probably other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 can be used in normal doses with terbinafine.",

The pharmacological characteristics of a newly developed serine derivative (R)-1-[3-(3-carboxypyridine-2-yl) thio-2-(indol-2-yl)carbonylamino]propionyl-4-diphenylmethyl- piperazine (TP-680), a cholecystokinin type A (CCKA) receptor antagonist, were studied and compared with those of MK-329 and loxiglumide. 2. TP-680 showed approximately 2 and 22 times greater selectivity for peripheral CCKA receptors relative to brain CCK (CCKB) receptors than MK-329 and loxiglumide, respectively, when IC50 values for inhibition of [125I]-CCK-8 binding in isolated acini and cerebral cortex were compared. 3. TP-680 was approximately 17 times less potent than MK-329, but was 106 times more potent than loxiglumide in inhibiting 100 pM CCK-8-stimulated amylase release from rat pancreatic acini. The antagonism produced by TP-680 was specific for CCK in that the effects of other receptor secretagogues or agents bypassing receptors were not altered. 4. TP-680 caused a parallel rightward shift of the dose-response curve for CCK-8-stimulated amylase release as did MK-329 and loxiglumide. However, in contrast to MK-329 and loxiglumide, TP-680 suppressed the maximal responses of CCK-8-induced amylase release in a concentration-dependent fashion, indicating that TP-680 is an unsurmountable antagonist. 5. Repeated washing of acini after a 30 min treatment with TP-680 restored the responsiveness but not the sensitivity, causing a residual inhibition on the action of CCK-8. 6. The addition of loxiglumide prior to or together with application of TP-680 protected CCK receptors from unsurmountable and irreversible antagonism by TP-680. 7. Our results indicate that TP-680 is a potent and the most selective CCKA receptor antagonist for the pancreas reported to date.", 
    "78": "1. BW 723C86 (3 and 10 mg kg-1, s.c. 30 min pretest), a 5-HT2B receptor agonist, increased total interaction, but not locomotion in a rat social interaction test, a profile consistent with anxiolysis. 2. The effect of BW 723C86 in the social interaction test is likely to be 5-HT2B receptor-mediated as it was prevented by pretreatment with the 5-HT2C/2B receptor antagonist, SB 200646A, (1 and 2 mg kg-1, p.o., 1 h pretest) which did not affect basal levels of social interaction at the doses used. 3. An anxiolytic-like action was also observed in the rat Geller-Seifter conflict test, where BW 723C86 (0.5-50 mg kg-1, s.c. 30 min pretest) modestly, but significantly increased punished, but not unpublished responding. 4. In a rat 5 min elevated x-maze test, BW 723C86 (1-10 mg kg-1, s.c.) had no significant effect. 5. The maximal anxiolytic-like effect of BW 723C86 approached that of the benzodiazepine anxiolytic, chloradiazepoxide (5 mg kg-1, s.c. 30 min pretest) in the social interaction test, but was markedly less in the Geller-Siefter test. The effect of BW 723C86 was also clearly less than chlordiazepoxide in the elevated x-maze procedure where it had no significant effect. 6. In conclusion, BW 723C86 exerted an appreciable anxiolytic-like profile in a rat social interaction test, but had a weaker effect in the Geller-Siefter and was ineffective in the elevated x-maze test used. These effects are likely to be 5-HT2B receptor-mediated.", 
    "79": "A subgroup of abstinent alcoholics, display low levels of plasma gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Two previous studies of plasma GABA in sons of alcoholic fathers (SOAs) have yielded conflicting results. The aim of the current study was to measure plasma GABA both at baseline and after challenge with diazepam, a GABAA receptor agonist, in a group of SOAs already shown to display decreased eye movement, memory, and sedative effects of diazepam. Twenty-seven SOAs and 23 male control subjects received four logarithmically increasing doses of diazepam or placebo in randomized order on 2 days at least 1 week apart. Plasma GABA was measured at baseline and after the last dose. There were no significant differences between SOAs and controls in baseline plasma GABA levels. In the whole sample, there were significant correlations between baseline plasma GABA and both high novelty-seeking and low-harm avoidance scores on the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire. Both SOAs and controls displayed decreases in plasma GABA over time on both testing days, but there was no effect of diazepam on plasma GABA and no significant difference between groups in plasma GABA response to diazepam. These results suggest that neither low plasma GABA at baseline nor altered plasma GABA response to diazepam is associated with increased genetic risk for alcoholism.",

    "84": "A method for determining the equilibrium dissociation constant (KA) of a soluble ligand (L) from a soluble receptor (A) in the presence of another solid phase receptor (R) for the same ligand was developed. The total and nonspecific binding of L to R was measured in the presence and in the absence of A. The separation of bound and free L was done by a rapid filtration technique so that only the complex RL, but not AL, was recovered. An apparent dissociation constant (KR,app) was calculated from the saturation curve obtained in the presence of A. The magnitude of KA could be determined from this KR,app and the value of the equilibrium dissociation constant of the complex R-L (KR) calculated from the saturation curve in the absence of A. The equality of the Bmax values obtained in the presence and in the absence of A assured the accuracy in the determination of KA so that the fulfillment of this condition could be used as an internal control. For the correct definition of nonspecific binding, the displacement agent (L1) should be used at concentrations within the range 10(2).KR < L1 < 10. K4. This fact constraints the applicability of the method to systems where KA/KR > 10(3). The highest sensitivity of the method can be attained when 0.33 < [At]/KA < 3. The equilibrium binding constant of [3H]-flunitrazepam to non-delipidized bovine serum albumin determined by the present approach (31 +/- 7 mumol/L) did not differ significantly from the literature.",

Healthy volunteers were given single oral doses of up to 50 mg of L-365,260 and multiple oral doses of up to 25 mg every 6 hours for 10 days. Plasma concentrations of L-365,260 were quantified by means of high-performance liquid chromatography. Anxiety and hunger were assessed by visual analog scale and the Spielberger State Anxiety Index. Cognitive testing was used to evaluate attention level and short-term memory. L-365,260 was rapidly absorbed and a biphasic pattern of elimination was demonstrated with a terminal half-life (t1/2) of 8 to 12 hours.

    "86": "1. Surgically resected tissue from the tip of the human temporal lobe of seven patients undergoing temporal lobectomy was employed to study functional properties of GABAergic inhibition mediated through activation of GABAA receptors, using patch-clamp recording techniques in acutely isolated neurons and in slices of human temporal cortex. 2. Human temporal cortical pyramidal neurons from surgically resected tissue could be acutely isolated with the use of conventional methods. These neurons appeared normal in morphology, in their intrinsic membrane properties, and in their response to application of exogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). 3. Application of GABA to acutely isolated human temporal cortical neurons elicited a large current with an average reversal potential of -65 mV, presumably mediated through a GABAA-activated chloride conductance. Application of varying concentrations of GABA generated a concentration/response relationship that could be well-fitted by a conventional sigmoidal curve, with an EC50 of 25.5 microM and a Hill coefficient of 1.0 4. Coapplication of the benzodiazepine clonazepam and 10 microM GABA augmented the amplitude of the GABA response. The concentration dependence of this benzodiazepine augmentation could be best-fitted by an equation assuming that the benzodiazepine interacted with two distinct binding sites, with differing potencies. The high-potency site had an EC50 of 0.06 nM and maximally contributed 38.5% augmentation to the total effect of clonazepam. The lower potency site had an EC50 of 16.4 nM, and contributed 66.1% maximal augmentation to the overall effect of clonazepam. These data derived from adult human temporal cortical neurons were very similar to our findings in adult rat sensory cortical neurons. 5. The effects of equimolar concentrations (100 nM) of clonazepam, a BZ1 and BZ2 agonist, and zolpidem, a selective BZ1 agonist, on acutely isolated human temporal cortical neurons were also investigated. Zolpidem and clonazepam were equally effective (71.5 vs. 65.0%, respectively) in potentiating GABA responses elicited by application of 10 microM GABA. This suggests that many of the functional benzodiazepine receptors in these neurons were of the BZ1 variety. 6. GABAergic synaptic inhibition was also studied with the use of patch-clamp recordings in slices of human temporal cortex. Extracellular stimulation at the white matter/gray matter border elicited compound synaptic events in layer II-V cortical neurons. These events usually consisted of an early excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and a late multiphasic inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). Application of either clonazepam or zolpidem (both at 100 nM) to the slice during extracellular stimulation reversibly augmented the late compound IPSP. 7. Spontaneous IPSPs were also recorded in approximately 50% of human temporal cortical neurons. These events did not have a preceding EPSP and were usually monopolar, with a single exponential rise and decay. This supported the idea that these events were triggered by spontaneous activity of GABAergic interneurons. Bath application of either clonazepam or zolpidem (both at 100nM) to the slice during ongoing spontaneous IPSP activity increased the amplitude and lengthened the time constant of decay of these events. 8. To our knowledge, this is one of the first detailed characterizations of the functional properties of GABAA-mediated inhibition in human cortical neurons using patch-clamp recordings in both isolated cells and slices of resected temporal cortex. Isolated pyramidal neurons exhibited GABAA-mediated currents that were comparable in many aspects with GABA currents recorded from adult rat cortical neurons, including similar GABA concentration/response curves, and similar two differing potency site effects for clonazepam augmentation of GABA currents. In addition, evoked and spontaneous IPSPs recorded in human cortical neurons appeared similar to IPSPs in rat cortical", 
    "87": "An hepatocyte culture system was developed for potential use in toxicological studies in vitro. Rat hepatocytes were isolated by two-step collagenase perfusion and cultured on Vitrogen-coated Permanox dishes in a modified Chee's medium containing 1 microM dexamethasone and 1% dimethylsulfoxide. The cells remained highly viable for at least 10 d as determined by lactate dehydrogenase release and total protein levels. Albumin secretion into the medium, as a measure of differentiated function, was maintained at elevated levels over the course of 10 d in culture. A number of CYP activities were determined by the analysis of testosterone metabolism in freeze-thawed cells, diazepam metabolism in live cells, and specific assays for CYP 1A1/2, 2B1/2, 2E1, and 3A. Results of these assays indicated that a wide range of CYP isozymes were maintained, some activities were enhanced under the conditions of culture and some activities were inducible. Activities of the phase II enzymes, glutathione S-transferase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, and glutathione levels were also maintained in the cultured hepatocytes for at least 6 d. These results strongly support the use of this hepatocyte culture system for in vitro toxicological studies.",

Before CPB, in two patients in each group, hypertension was controlled with sufentanil only. One patient in group 1 required a vasodilator in addition to sufentanil. No ischemic events occurred before CPB. After CPB, one patient in group 2 required a vasodilator to control hypertension. Two patients in group 2 required treatment with nitroglycerin for myocardial ischemia. Stable plasma concentrations of sufentanil and midazolam were obtained during and after CPB. The midazolam infusion was continued in both groups at a rate of 1.25 micrograms/kg/min during the first 4 postoperative hours.

However, these methods are too time consuming and labor intensive for most nonresearch laboratories to offer. A fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) method for quantification of lorazepam was developed and validated using a reverse-phase HPLC method as the reference method. The FPIA method involves a single liquid-liquid extraction of 100 microliters of either serum or plasma, then direct analysis using the TDxFLx (Abbott Diagnostics, North Chicago, IL). FPIA calibrations were linear between 50 and 800 ng/ml using five calibrators prepared in human serum. Within-run precision (n = 10) for three serum controls (75, 300, and 600 ng/ml) resulted in coefficients of variation (CVs) of 5.7%, 5.4%, and 4.2%, respectively. Between-day precision studies for the three serum controls were 7.0%, 8.9% and 4.9%, respectively (n = 5). The analytical recovery of the three serum controls was 104.9%, 97.3% and 98.3%, respectively. There was an excellent linear correlation between the FPIA and HPLC determinations of 43 patient specimens (r = 0.990, slope = 0.961, intercept = 16.3). No interferences were found from many commonly prescribed nonbenzodiazepine drugs; however, other benzodiazepines that were tested will cross-react with this procedure and give inaccurate results. Therefore, this method should not be used in patients who are receiving other benzodiazepines in addition to lorazepam.

The challenge dose of 20 mg of temazepam was ingested on the fourth day, after which plasma samples were collected, and psychomotor performance tests were carried out for 24 h. Despite a statistically significant small increase of the area under the temazepam concentration-time curve, there was no clinically significant interaction, as determined by the psychomotor performance tests. The different metabolic pathways and the lack of significant firstpass metabolism of temazepam explain the great difference in the interaction potential of temazepam compared with midazolam and triazolam. Temazepam, unlike midazolam and triazolam, can be prescribed in usual doses for patients receiving itraconazole and other inhibitors of P450 3A4.", 
    "97": "We measured citalopram and desmethylcitalopram concentrations in serum from 169 psychiatric patients, who were treated with common therapeutic drug doses. Altogether 202 serum samples were assayed by a nonenantioselective high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. The results indicate that the kinetic variability (maximum concentration/minimum concentration) in dose- and weight-related serum citalopram (10.6-fold) and desmethylcitalopram (7.2-fold) is large even during monotherapy. Log serum citalopram (r = 0.36, p < 0.05) and desmethylcitalopram (r = 0.51, p < 0.01) concentrations of individual patients increased significantly with increasing drug doses. Dose- and weight-related (calculated as mg/kg dose basis) log serum citalopram (r = 0.29) but not desmethylcitalopram (r = 0.06) concentrations increased with aging (p < 0.001). No sex-related differences were found. Nineteen patients (19 samples) had concomitant treatment with neuroleptics, 84 patients (101 samples) with benzodiazepines, and 18 patients (28 samples) with tricyclic antidepressants. The concentrations in these patients were compared with those of 48 nonsmoking patients (54 samples) without any concomitant psychotropic drug treatment. None of the single neuroleptics alone had a significant effect on dose- and weight-related serum citalopram or desmethylcitalopram concentrations. However, citalopram concentrations increased by 121% (338 +/- 165 vs. 747 +/- 505, mean +/- SD; p < 0.01) and desmethylcitalopram by 85% (124 +/- 53 vs. 229 +/- 138; p < 0.05) when neuroleptics were pooled. Among single benzodiazepines, only alprazolam increased serum citalopram (338 +/- 165 vs. 391 +/- 267; p < 0.01) and desmethylcitalopram (124 +/- 53 vs. 186 +/- 175; p < 0.01) concentrations. When all the benzodiazepines were pooled, they still increased the serum concentration of the parent drug by 23% (338 +/- 165 vs. 414 +/- 303; p < 0.05) and those of the metabolite by 47% (124 +/- 53 vs. 182 +/- 163; p < 0.01). In patients who were simultaneously treated with clomipramine, serum citalopram (338 +/- 165 vs. 655 +/- 409; p < 0.001) and desmethylcitalopram (124 +/- 53 vs. 435 +/- 347; p < 0.001) concentrations were consistently higher than those of the controls. Even when the tricyclic antidepressants were pooled, they increased citalopram concentrations by 44% (338 +/- 165 vs. 486 +/- 312; p < 0.001) and desmethylcitalopram concentrations by 111% (124 +/- 53 vs. 261 +/- 260; p < 0.001). The results suggest that interindividual variability in serum citalopram concentrations is pronounced and that increased serum citalopram levels are related to advancing age and concomitant treatment with other psychotropic drugs. The citalopram dose should therefore ideally be individualized by therapeutic drug monitoring.", 
    "98": "There have been few reports of parasuicide from Pakistan, where the act is considered to be a criminal offence and the Islamic religion strongly disapproves of it. In order to address the problem, a retrospective case report analysis of all index cases of parasuicide presenting over a period of 3.5 years to a university hospital in Karachi, Pakistan, was undertaken. Our results showed that most of the subjects were young adults, with married women representing the single largest group. Self-poisoning with medication was the most common method, and benzodiazepines the most frequently used drug. Interpersonal conflict with the opposite sex was the most common precipitating cause. In Pakistani culture, marriage appears to be a significant source of stress for women. Reports based on official police records do not reflect the true picture of the problem in Pakistan.", 
    "99": "To evaluate prospectively the efficacy and dose requirements of rocuronium administered by continuous infusion for neuromuscular blockade in a paediatric ICU population.", 
    "100": "Neuromuscular function was monitored by train-of-four (TOF) stimulation of the ulnar or peroneal nerve. Rocuronium was administered as a bolus dose (0.6 mg.kg-1) followed by a continuous infusion starting at 0.6 mg.kg-1.hr-1. The infusion was increased or decreased by 0.1 mg.kg-1.hr-1 to maintain one visible twitch of the TOF. All patients also received a benzodiazepine or a barbiturate infusion.", 
    "101": "The study population included 20 patients (12 boys, eight girls) ranging in age from two months to 16 yr and in weight from 3.6 to 64 kg. The duration of the rocuronium infusion varied from 26 to 172 hr for a total of 1492 hr in the 20 patients. The rocuronium infusion requirements for day 1 varied from 0.3 to 0.8 mg.kg-1.hr-1 (0.76 +/- 0.3 mg.kg-1.hr-1). When considering all patients and all patient days, the rocuronium infusion rate required to maintain one twitch of the TOF varied from 0.3 to 2.2 mg.kg-1.hr-1 (mean for all patient days = 0.95 +/- 0.4 mg.kg-1.hr-1). The infusion requirements were 0.5 to 0.8 mg.kg-1.hr-1 in 45 of the 64 patient days (70%) and 0.3 to 1.0 mg.kg-1.hr-1 in 58 of the 64 patient days (90%). No problems with the infusion were noted.",

    "103": "One case of infanticide and abandonment by the natural mother is presented. The body was extensively damaged, evidently by a fox. Fortunately, since the body showed less advanced putrefaction due to cold weather, it was possible to narrow down the cause of death and to detect the drug which had been forced down the victim's throat before the crime. However, our estimates of age and postmortem interval were erroneous. We comment as to why we were misled. Pathological problems associated with \"aspiration of vomitus\" are also discussed.", 
    "104": "A simple and rapid screening procedure with Triage has been developed to detect 7 classes of drugs of abuse, phencyclidine (PCP), benzodiazepines (BZO), cocaine metabolite (COC), amphetamines (AMP), cannabinoids (THC), opiates (OPI), and barbiturates (BAR), in hemolyzed blood. A clear supernatant was obtained by mixing the blood with sulfosalicylic acid. The supernatant was neutralized with ammonium acetate and then screened using Triage. The lower limits of detection of the Triage screening method for PCP, diazepam, benzolyecgonine, methamphetamine, morphine, 11-nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (THC-COOH), phenobarbital, and secobarbital were 50 ng/mL, 900 ng/mL, 1,000 ng/mL, 600 ng/mL, 900 ng/mL, and 900 ng/mL, respectively. The sensitivity of Triage for THC-COOH in deproteinized blood samples was much lower than that in urine samples. No false positive reactions were observed for the 6 classes of the drugs of abuse with the exception of AMP when the blood was decomposed. Phenethylamine, a putrefactive amine, gave positive results for AMP at concentrations over 5,000 ng/mL. The method was applied to 9 hemolyzed blood samples and 3 turbid urine samples from 12 forensic autopsy cases suspected of drug misuse. Among these, 5 were positive for AMP, 1 for OPI, and 4 for BAR. The presence of methamphetamine is only one of the 5, codeine in 1, and phenobarbital in 4 was confirmed by gas chromatography. All 4 samples which were false positive for AMP contained phenethylamine at relatively high concentrations because of moderate to heavy putrefaction. This method, although disadvantageous to test for AMP and THC, is helpful for the forensic toxicologist because any kind of bloody fluid can be tested rapidly with Triage to detect toxic levels of PCP, BZO, COC, OPI, and BAR.", 
    "105": "The in vivo binding kinetics of [11C]iomazenil, a central benzodiazepine antagonist, were analyzed using PET and compartmental modeling. This method is of interest because it allows validation of the SPECT tracer [123I]iomazenil.", 
    "106": "The experimental protocol consisted of serial PET imaging following a single bolus injection of the serial PET imaging following a single bolus injection of the radioligand. Imaging was performed on five healthy young volunteers over 106 min. The tissue time-activity curves of various brain regions were analyzed with models consisting of two (K1, k2\") and three (K1, k2', k3', k4) compartments. Some of the methods use simultaneous fitting of the data from multiple brain regions coupled with common parameters. Distribution volumes and k3-based parameters [(K1/k2') k3' and k3')] were chosen to represent receptor density. Goodness of fit was assessed with F-test statistics and chi-square analysis.", 
    "107": "Compared with the two-compartment model, goodness of fit was significantly improved by all three-compartment configurations. Of the three-compartment models, goodness of fit was similar for the configurations with K1/k2', k4 or no parameter coupled, and slightly worse when both parameters were coupled. The most reliable estimates of receptor density were obtained from the specific distribution volumes (DVs) calculated with the three-compartment model, and the coupling of k4 or both k4 and K1/k2'. Due to oversimplification of the kinetics, the DV values calculated with the two-compartment model were underestimated.", 
    "108": "Reliable quantitative information regarding benzodiazepine receptor density following bolus injection of iomazenil is best obtained by tracer kinetic modeling that uses a three-compartment model and parameter coupling.", 
    "109": "Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine hypnotic that is biochemically distinct from classic benzodiazepine agonists in that it may be selective for the BZ1 receptor subtype and shows a different pattern of distribution of binding sites. The present study compared the learning, recall, performance, subject-rated and observer-rated effects of zolpidem, triazolam, and temazepam in 11 healthy humans. Placebo, zolpidem (5, 10, and 20 mg/70 kg), triazolam (0.125, 0.25, and 0.50 mg/70 kg), and temazepam (15, 30, and 60 mg/70 kg) were administered orally in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design. Zolpidem, triazolam, and temazepam produced orderly dose- and time-related impairment of learning, recall, and performance, and increased subject- and observer-rated estimates of strength of drug effect. The absolute magnitude of these effects at peak effect were comparable across the three compounds. The time to maximal drug effect was faster with zolpidem (0.5-1.0 hours) than with triazolam (1.5-2.0 hours) or temazepam (2-3 hours). These results suggest that despite the somewhat unique benzodiazepine receptor-binding profile of zolpidem, its behavioral and subject-rated effects are similar to those of benzodiazepine hypnotics (i.e., triazolam and temazepam).", 
    "110": "Cocaine intake growth is a well-known fact, and that involves the appearance of unknown or forgotten complications. We have wanted to make a checking of neurologic complications due to the intake of this drug, make a special point of the physiopathological mechanisms and stopping at those related to treatment. We also want to contribute with our experience with regard to these processes.", 
    "111": "A comparison was made of the drug costs and nursing dependency of patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery and routine postoperative recovery for two anaesthetic techniques using either propofol with low dose fentanyl or midazolam with high dose fentanyl. Estimates of resource use were based on a randomised clinical trial undertaken at the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield. Times from entry to the intensive care unit until extubation and discharge were recorded for 70 patients and were transformed to nursing shifts. Nursing dependency was calculated on the basis of one nurse per ventilated patient and 0.5 nurse from the start of the shift after extubation. Nursing costs were allocated on the basis of the patient's status at the beginning of each shift in line with the hospital's staffing policy. All drugs used from the morning of the operation until discharge were recorded. Costs of nursing and drugs were calculated. The total cost of patients in the propofol group was 13.3% less than midazolam patients (p = 0.043, for geometric means Cl 0.4% to 27.8%). The clinical study was not designed for economic endpoints; however, it demonstrated achievable savings in propofol-treated patients.", 
    "112": "Sensory and motor symptoms of the limbs, motor restlessness and an urge to move only at rest are the characteristics of the restless legs syndrome (RLS), which often leads to severe sleep disturbances. The clinical diagnosis can be made on the basis of the typical history, normal neurological findings and, in some cases, a positive family history, and can be confirmed by polysomnography. The indication for treatment depends on the patient's discomfort and the severity of the sleep disturbances. L-DOPA is the treatment of first choice both in idiopathic and uremic RLS. A bedtime dose of 100-200 mg L-DOPA standard plus decarboxylase inhibitor is effective against mild and moderate sleep disturbances in RLS. Titration of the dosage and additional treatment with sustained-release preparations of L-DOPA should be applied individually. Opioids and dopamine agonists are effective alternative treatments in idiopathic RLS. Benzodiazepines are indicated only in individual cases. Besides L-DOPA, uremic RLS patients can be treated with opioids and benzodiazepines. Various approaches in the treatment of idiopathic and uremic RLS are reviewed and the practical management of therapy is outlined.", 
    "113": "123I-iomazenil is a partial inverse agonist of central-type benzodiazepine receptor (BZR). Single photon emission tomography (SPECT) using 123I-iomazenil was performed in 15 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). SPECT images were obtained 3 hours after intravenous injection of 167 MBq of 123I-iomazenil. The ratio of 123I-iomazenil SPECT count in the cerebral cortex to that in the cerebellum was calculated as the binding potential index (BPI). The BPIs in the lower frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortices correlated with the motor disability evaluated by Yahr's stage. The BPI in the upper frontal cortex showed the same tendency as in the other regions but did not reach a significant level. These results suggest that BZR in the cerebral cortex of patients with PD may be impaired in proportion to the severity of the disease and that 123I-iomazenil SPECT is useful for evaluating the pathophysiological condition in PD.", 
    "114": "We assessed the duration of the anti-cholecystokinin (CCK) action of FK480, a new non-peptide CCK-A receptor antagonist developed in Japan, in an in vivo study in rats, comparing it with CR 1505. Pancreatic exocrine secretion stimulated by intravenous infusion of CCK-8 (0.06 microgram/kg per h) was measured at intervals of 0-24 h after the oral administration of FK480 (1.5 mg/kg) and CR 1505 (30 mg/kg). FK480 significantly inhibited both CCK-stimulated pancreatic juice volume flow and amylase output 0, 4, 8, and 12 h after oral administration, whereas the inhibitory effect of CR 1505 had completely disappeared by 8 h after oral administration. It was concluded that orally administered FK480 has a prolonged anti-CCK action.", 
    "115": "Omeprazole effectively suppresses acid secretion, resulting in the long-term elevation of intragastric pH and serum gastrin level. Pirenzepine has been reported to inhibit gastrin secretion. This study was carried out to examine the effects of additional pirenzepine treatment on the hypergastrinemia and gastric acid suppression induced by omeprazole. Concentrations of serum gastrin and plasma somatostatin were measured in 28 peptic ulcer patients before treatment, after omeprazole treatment (20 mg/day) for 2 weeks, and after omeprazole and pirenzepine (100 mg/day) treatment for 2 weeks. The acid inhibitory effect of pirenzepine treatment in addition to omeprazole was evaluated by 24-h intragastric pH measurement in six healthy volunteers. Serum gastrin level was increased significantly, to 2.4-fold the pretreatment level, by omeprazole treatment. Additional treatment with pirenzepine suppressed serum gastrin level to 0.6-fold the omeprazole-treatment level. The serum somatostatin level was not altered significantly either by omeprazole treatment or by omeprazole and pirenzepine treatment. In healthy volunteers whose pH 3 holding time on 24-h intragastric pH monitoring was 70% by omeprazole treatment, omeprazole and pirenzepine treatment markedly increased the pH 3 holding time, to 89%. These findings suggest that pirenzepine is useful in reducing the undesirable effects of omeprazole-induced hypergastrinemia, i.e., the excessive trophic effect of omeprazole on the acid-secreting part of the stomach and the overstimulation of acid secretion. The additional pirenzepine treatment is also effective in suppressing acid secretion.",

Flunitrazepam is the most often administered drug (54%), followed by dipotassium clorazepat (8%), and diazepam (8%). Premedication in the morning on the day of surgery is performed orally in 29 centres (78%), of which 18 centres (49%) prefer flunitrazepam and 6 centres (16%) midazolam as first choice. In contrast, 7 centres (19%) used intramuscularly administered regimens. 5 centres (14%) combined intramuscularly opioids with sedatives for that indication. If anaesthesia was induced late in the morning or in the afternoon, respectively, 11 centres (30%) administered additional benzodiazepines early in the morning. 68% of all centres maintained the administration of chronic treatment with ss-blockers until the morning of the operating day. Chronic treatment with nitrates is continued in 65%, treatment with calcium-channel blockers in 62%. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are continued in 30%, alpha 2-agonists in 27%, other antihypertensive drugs in 19%, and inotropic glycosids in 11%. 31 of 37 centres (84%) discontinued the administration of acetylsalicylic acid 5 or more days prior to surgery, but 68% tolerate individual exceptions from this principle.",

    "120": "Diazepam transfer by the first trimester human placenta was investigated at pregnancy termination between 6 and 12 weeks of gestation. Fetal fluid samples were obtained from the exocoelomic and amniotic cavities of 65 pregnancies between 8 and 25 min following the i.v. administration of 0.1 mg/kg diazepam to the mother. Diazepam was detected in one-third of coelomic fluid samples and two-thirds of amniotic fluid samples. Maternal serum and urine diazepam concentrations correlated negatively and positively respectively, with time from drug injection to sampling. Individual diazepam concentrations were low on the fetal side, and the corresponding concentrations were independent of maternal serum concentrations and the time from drug injection to sampling. Amniotic fluid diazepam content increased significantly with advancing gestational age. A multiple regression analysis showed that the diazepam content of the coelomic fluid was not influenced by maternal serum diazepam concentration, the time from drug injection to sampling or gestational age, whereas only gestational age contributed to the diazepam content of amniotic fluid. These data demonstrate that the placental transfer of diazepam occurs from week 6 of gestation, indicate a preferential transfer of this drug to the amniotic cavity and suggest that diazepam may accumulate in fetal circulation and tissues during organogenesis.", 
    "121": "We have examined the effects of sedation with midazolam 0.1 mg kg-1 and reversal with flumazenil 0.5 mg on beat-to-beat heart rate (HR) variability (HRV), systolic arterial pressure (SAP), finger photoplethysmograph amplitude (PLA) and impedence pneumography in eight volunteers. With the onset of sedation there was a small decrease in SAP and increase in HR (ns). Spectral analysis of the HR time series showed reductions in the proportion of power in the high (> 0.15 Hz) frequency \"ventilatory\" band consistent with midazolam causing vagolysis. During sedation, low frequency (< 0.05 Hz) oscillations of PLA, HR, SAP and ventilation were observed. These were thought to be secondary to activity of coupled cardiorespiratory neurones within the brain stem and the ventilatory periodicity appeared similar to that observed during the early stages of sleep. The diminished high frequency and increased low frequency oscillations induced by midazolam sedation were reversed by administration of flumazenil.", 
    "122": "We performed a double-blind single-dose placebo/hypnotics crossover study randomized within groups to test the potential problems that a group of normal subjects, including subjects who snore, may face using hypnotic medications. Two benzodiazepine hypnotics--triazolam, 0.25 mg, and flunitrazepam, 2 mg tablets--were considered. Subjects were monitored with nocturnal polysomnography, including esophageal pressure (Pes) monitoring as a measure of respiratory efforts, and were given daytime performance tests. Results were analyzed for the total nocturnal sleep period and also by thirds of the night in consideration of the different half-lives of the studied drugs. Three specific respiratory variables were evaluated: mean breathing frequency for selected unit of time, \"Delta Pes\" (esophageal pressure at peak end-expiration minus Pes at peak end-inspiration) expressed in cm H2O, and the ratio of Delta Pes/Delta TI (inspiratory time), taken as an index of respiratory drive calculated for each respiratory cycle. There was no significant increase in either the respiratory disturbance index or the oxygen desaturation index (number of drops in arterial oxygen saturation of 4% or more per hour of sleep, as measured by pulse oximetry). There was a significant increase in mean breathing frequency with flunitrazepam compared with placebo, as well as a significantly larger percentage of time during sleep with Delta Pes above 10 cm H2O (taken as a cutoff point for normal respiratory effort) with both triazolam and flunitrazepam compared with placebo. These respiratory changes, even if significant, were minor but may become a liability in association with specific abnormalities.",

Prior to paralysis, the patients were sedated with lorazepam and morphine to standard end points, and the cardiac output and oxygenation were optimized. The patients were then paralyzed with doxacurium and the ventilator rate adjusted to keep the PaCO2 at baseline value. The hemodynamic and oxygenation profile and pHi were determined prior to paralysis and repeated 2 to 2.5 h later.",

The mean fraction of inspired oxygen, positive end-expiratory pressure, and venous admixture ratio prior to the study was 0.7 +/- 0.14, 11.8 +/- 2.4 cm H2O, and 26 +/- 9%, respectively. Prior to paralysis, the mean set assist controlled ventilation rate was 15 +/- 2 breaths/min and the patient rate was 23 +/- 5 breaths/min.

    "128": "We investigated the effects of brain cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors on the intracellular calcium concentration and protein kinase C in human T cells. CCK-4 produced a transient increase in calcium in the absence of extracellular calcium. CCK-B agonists stimulated calcium mobilization in a dose-dependent manner in T cells. CCK-B antagonists suppressed CCK-4-induced calcium mobilization more potently than CCK-A antagonist. The recovery of desensitization of the CCK-4-induced response was delayed by phosphoserine/phosphothreonine phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A. The responsiveness to CCK-4 was also reduced by phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), and this effect of PDBu was abolished completely by preincubation with staurosporine. CCK-4-induced calcium mobilization was too small to attribute the desensitization to the protein kinase C transduction pathway. T cells from patients with untreated panic disorder exhibited significantly higher cholecystokinin-4-induced calcium mobilization than those from healthy controls or patients with treated panic disorder. These results suggest that cholecystokinin-B receptor function in T cells of patients with panic disorder is enhanced. Cholecystokinin-4-induced calcium mobilization in T cells may be state dependent and useful as a biological marker of panic disorder."
