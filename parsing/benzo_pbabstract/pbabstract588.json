    "0": "The ability of flutoprazepam, a new antianxiety drug of the benzodiazepine class, to inhibit [3H]flunitrazepam binding to mouse brain receptors was investigated in vitro and ex vivo (measurement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding in vitro after in vivo treatment of animals with unlabelled drugs). The Ki values for [3H]flunitrazepam binding in vitro were as follows: flutoprazepam (13.0 nM), diazepam (2.7 nM), nitrazepam (5.3 nM), prazepam (68.5 nM) and chlordiazepoxide (234 nM). Two metabolites of flutoprazepam, N-desalkyl-flutoprazepam (Ki = 3.1 nM) also inhibited [3H]flunitrazepam binding in vitro with higher potencies than that of flutoprazepam. Flutoprazepam was found to be more active in inhibiting [3H]flunitrazepam binding ex vivo and in preventing pentetrazol convulsions than predicted from Ki values. The ID50 values for inhibiting [3H]flunitrazepam binding ex vivo were 0.32 mg/kg, p.o. (flutoprazepam), 0.89 mg/kg, p.o. (diazepam), 0.94 mg/kg, p.o. (nitrazepam), 1.98 mg/kg, p.o. (prazepam) and 23.3 mg/kg, p.o. (chlordiazepoxide), respectively. The correlation between ID50 values ex vivo and ED50 values for preventing pentetrazol convulsions was highly significant (r = 0.929). These results suggest that flutoprazepam can exert its pharmacological activities by itself and that two metabolites also play an important role in the effects of flutoprazepam in vivo.", 
    "1": "The effects of chlordiazepoxide (0,2.5 and 7.5 mg/kg), of valproate (0,100 and 300 mg/kg), and of combinations of these drugs, on hyponeophagia in rats, were studied using a food preference test. Chlordiazepoxide alone reduced the latency for eating, and also enhanced the time of eating and the amount of familiar food eaten at the smaller dose, and of novel food eaten at the larger dose. Valproate alone reduced the latency of eating and enhanced time of eating and the amount of novel food eaten, especially at 300 mg/kg. However, valproate antagonised the effects of chlordiazepoxide on all behavioural measures. These findings are discussed in the context of the GABA hypothesis of the actions of benzodiazepines, with the conclusion that valproate has an atypical pharmacological profile amongst putative GABA agonists, and may have partial agonist activity at the proposed benzodiazepine/GABA receptor complex.", 
    "2": "The benzodiazepine temazepam was given to Charles River CD rats for 2 years in the diet at dosages of 10, 40, and 160 mg/kg day. An 18-month study was performed in Charles River CD-1 mice via dietary admixture at dosages of 10, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day. Mean body weights were significantly decreased for high dose rats of both sexes from Treatment Week 39 until termination. All drug treated male groups had a higher rate of mortality when compared to the male control groups, primarily due to deaths occurring between 19 to 24 months. Compound-related hepatic lipidosis accompanied by an increase in liver weights was observed at the high dose level in the 6- and 12-month and terminal sacrifices, as well as the middle dose level at the 12-month interim sacrifice. No evidence was found of compound induced carcinogenicity at any time period. Mortality for male mice was significantly higher in the two higher dose groups; this resulted from bite wounds associated with a drug-related increase in fighting behavior. An isolated finding of borderline statistical significance (p = 0.0556) was noted for hepatocellular adenomas in high dose female mice (4/100) at the 18-month terminal sacrifice. This incidence is well within the reported historical control range (0-14%). Minimal hepatoproliferative (hyperplastic nodules) and vascular effects (telangiectasis) were seen in the high dose male and female mice at the 18-month terminal sacrifice. Thus, these results were similar to those previously reported for oxazepam although meaningful effects on neoplasia did not occur with temazepam. Unlike in man, temazepam is primarily metabolized to oxazepam in the mouse and thus these results are not adverse with regard to human safety evaluation.", 
    "3": "Experiments on an isolated spinal cord of 8-15-day-old rats have shown that one of the possible mechanisms of the GABA-potentiating action of the benzodiazepine tranquilizer, chlorodiazepoxide, may be a decrease in the intraneuronal concentration of Ca2+. This is evidenced by the enhancement of the GABA-potentiating action of chlorodiazepoxide under Ca2+ deficiency in the medium and in the presence of the blockers of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ ionic channels--Mn2+ and Co2+, and by the reduction of the effect in question under Ca2+ excess in the medium and in the presence of the K+ channels blockers--tetraethylammonium and 4-aminopyridine. The GABA-potentiating action of harmane is likely to be related to the blockade of the voltage-dependent K+ channels and elevation of the intracellular concentration of Ca2+.", 
    "4": "The hypnotic efficacy of temazepam capsules (30 mg) was studied in twelve patients who had objective polysomnographic evidence of sleep onset insomnia. Patients slept in the laboratory, retiring at their usual bedtime after taking placebo or temazepam 30 min earlier, and were monitored for 8 h using standard polysomnographic techniques. Acute (nights 5-7) and chronic (nights 11-13) temazepam improved the sleep of these patients by reducing sleep latency and increasing sleep time compared to the placebo baseline (nights 2-4). No detrimental effects on daytime function the following morning were observed using questionnaires and objective tests of performance. No consistent evidence of disturbed sleep after discontinuation of treatment was obtained over three recovery nights.", 
    "5": "An ideal i.v. sedative for dentistry should provide anti-anxiety and analgesic activity, amnesic action, and patient cooperation without depression of the cardiorespiratory system and with rapid recovery. Lorazepam does not provide any advantages over the currently available agents, but midazolam, a new water-soluble benzodiazepine, and later selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonists may play an important role in outpatient sedation.", 
    "6": "The differential effects of drugs used for intravenous pre-medication are reviewed using the results of controlled clinical trials in dental outpatients. The evaluation of clinical success requires experimental control of factors which can confound both the therapeutic and evaluation processes. The evaluation of drugs which are given primarily to alleviate anxiety requires that this effect be assessed by the patient's self-report rather than by the clinician's estimate of drug effect based on external manifestations. The results of the studies reviewed suggest that intravenous diazepam accomplishes the therapeutic objectives of anxiety relief, decreased pain perception, and amnesia. The addition of a narcotic, while reducing the diazepam dose, does not result in any greater effect, but does improve patient cooperation. It is concluded that diazepam, administered to clinical end-point, accomplishes most of the goals of intravenous pre-medication with minimal potential for adverse effects. The use of additional agents may improve patient cooperation, but this possible advantage must be weighed against the potential for increased systemic effects.", 
    "7": "The purpose of this paper has been to describe the information that must be gathered before a new drug can be used effectively and safely for I.V. sedation. A new drug, midazolam, has been used as an illustrative example.", 
    "8": "The search for new anesthetic and analgesic drugs will be aided by analysis of the structures of chemical compounds which variously stimulate the five proposed opioid receptors or the benzodiazepine receptors. The mechanism of interaction between the benzodiazepines, opioids, and the neuroleptics will be further elucidated. These studies will result in discovery of drugs with fewer side-effects and more specific clinical effects.", 
    "9": "In a 4-week double-blind study comparing alprazolam with diazepam treatments, 48 outpatients suffering from mild to moderate generalized anxiety were evaluated after a 5-day placebo washout, and then after 1, 2, and 4 weeks of treatment. The optimal therapeutic doses without excessive sedation averaged 2 mg for alprazolam and 15.8 mg for diazepam. Results from the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the Clinical Global Impression Scale, a behavior checklist questionnaire, and a symptomatic patients' self-rating scale indicated that patients improved in both treatment groups. Results from the comparative phase suggest that diazepam is more efficient than alprazolam in the reduction of several symptoms of anxiety and depression in particular. Assuming that the first 2-week ratings depend on accuracy of dose adjustment and that week 4 ratings are an important evaluation of long-term efficacy, results from this study suggest that adequate control of anxiety is obtained more readily with diazepam and that symptoms of depression might benefit more from that drug. Few side effects were reported: mainly, drowsiness, tremor, light- headedness , and dry mouth. A toxic reaction to alprazolam, possibly allergic, was observed. Either alprazolam or diazepam appeared to be effective in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, and the statistically significant differences between the two drugs were not clinically striking.", 
    "10": "The extent and nature of the use of medicinal drugs by drivers who had undergone a blood test on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol was ascertained by analysing some 40,000 case records in which the suspect had been questioned about the use of drugs. No chemical analyses were performed. 9.7% of the road users indicated that they used drugs in combination with alcohol, and more than 50% of the drugs used must be considered to have a negative impact on driving performance. The influence of the combined use of benzodiazepines and alcohol on behaviour was also investigated. The finding here was that drivers using these drugs should be warned against the consumption of alcohol.", 
    "11": "Halazepam is a benzodiazepine used in the management of anxiety disorders or short-term relief of anxiety. Our study was undertaken to evaluate its steady-state kinetics and those of its major active plasma metabolite N- desalkylhalazepam . Eleven healthy men aged 19 to 35 yr were given oral, 40-mg halazepam tablets every 8 hr for 14 days. Plasma samples were analyzed by gas chromatography to determine levels of halazepam and N- desalkylhalazepam . Halazepam kinetics can best be described by a two-compartment open model with first-order absorption kinetics. The elimination phase t1/2s of halazepam and N- desalkylhalazepam were 34.7 and 57.9 hr. Steady-state levels were predictable from kinetic data and were reached by the third day for halazepam and by the eleventh day for N- desalkylhalazepam .", 
    "12": "Three patients who met DSM-III criteria for borderline personality disorder and who did not improve while taking a number of other drugs improved substantially while taking alprazolam.", 
    "13": "Of 80 patients given alprazolam, eight became hostile early in treatment. The authors suggest that alprazolam-induced hostility may be more likely in patients with well-suppressed chronic anger and resentment and cite reports of hostility associated with other benzodiazepines.", 
    "14": "Avermectin B1a concentrations corresponding to the KD value of a specific high affinity binding site for [3H]avermectin B1a are sufficient to stimulate the specific high affinity binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to its receptors. This stimulation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding by low concentrations of avermectin B1a was enhanced by chloride ions and picrotoxinin and reduced by the GABA agonists THIP and PSA. The similar modulation by chloride ions, GABA agonists and picrotoxinin and the resistance against washing of membranes of avermectin B1a bound to its specific high affinity binding site or to the site modulating [3H]flunitrazepam binding indicate a close association of the specific high affinity binding site for [3H]avermectin B1a with the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "15": "The slice technique has turned out to be a valuable tool in the study of fundamental epileptic processes. Intracellular recording from brain tissue in vitro may be maintained for hours. The effect of changes in the perfusion medium may be studied easily without interference from the blood-brain barrier and tissue from different brain regions may be studied in isolation. Generally, brain cells in slices behave as brain cells in vivo in spite of the obvious possibilities for distorted metabolism. The cellular basis of the epileptic process is believed to be large depolarizing potentials. Although similar potentials recorded from cells in slices have been shown to be synaptic potentials, abnormal membrane properties are also induced by epileptogenic substances. The spread of the epileptic process may occur by direct electrical coupling via gap junctions, by local increases in extracellular potassium concentration or by synaptic transmission. Reduced GABA'ergic inhibition, account, at least in part, for epileptic discharges induced by epileptogenic drugs. The role for this mechanism in naturally occurring epilepsy is unknown, but it is probably involved somehow. GABA increases the conductance of the neuronal membrane to Cl. In hippocampal dendrites, it probably in addition increases the conductance to Na because here the induced inhibitory response is depolarizing. The somatic and dendritic membranes are also different in their excitatory responses. In the hippocampus, calcium spikes predominate in the dendrites whereas steady discharges consisting of sodium spikes are characteristic of the soma. The same receptor complex seems to be involved in dendrites and soma in the enhancing effect of benzodiazepines on GABA responses. However, GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complexes in other parts of the brain are probably constituted in different ways. We know of many disturbances in the brain which may be involved in epilepsy. A single critical deviation from normal physiology in naturally occurring epilepsy has not been identified. Possibly, the process may be initiated by any one of several factors, which all take part when the disease is established.", 
    "16": "Water-deprived rats were given access to either water or a highly preferred 0.9% NaCl solution in a 30 min drinking test. The animals consumed substantially more saline than water. Chlordiazepoxide (2.5-20.0 mg/kg) was administered IP before the drinking test. Analysis of the results revealed a significant drug treatment X fluid condition interaction. Chlordiazepoxide produced a preferential enhancement of saline intake, achieving a peak effect at 5.0 mg/kg. Consideration of the time-course of drinking showed some complexity in the way in which chlordiazepoxide affected the saline drinking. During the first 6 min of the drinking period, the drug treatments tended to depress consumption, reaching a significant effect at 20.0 mg/kg. However, in the following 16 min interval of the drinking test, chlordiazepoxide significantly elevated saline consumption. The mechanism for this second effect may have been a retardation in the development of satiety. Finally, at the end of the drinking test, when saline consumption had become satiated, chlordiazepoxide exerted no discernible effect. The enhancement of saline consumption by chlordiazepoxide appears to have been benzodiazepine-receptor mediated, since the effect was reversed by treatment with Ro15-1788, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. The implications of a benzodiazepine-induced increase in salt intake are briefly considered. The over consumption of salt is contraindicated in certain clinical conditions. Both stress and hypertension are associated with elevated salt appetite. Treatment of these conditions using benzodiazepines may require due consideration of the possible stimulant effect of these drugs on salt appetite.", 
    "17": "Rats of 18 genotypes derived from the selected Roman strains were tested for hyponeophagia in a control condition and following diazepam (1 mg/kg). Subsequently, benzodiazepine receptor binding was measured in the cortical/striatal region. Hyponeophagia in the control condition correlated strongly with diazepam sensitivity, but benzodiazepine receptor titres did not correlate significantly with either control behavior or drug responsivity. These findings are discussed in the contexts of the arousal hypothesis of hyponeophagia and of postulated relationships between benzodiazepine receptors and emotionality.", 
    "18": "The effect of the Type I benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor agonist, CL 218,872, on convulsions generated by low doses of methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid ( MBCC ), bicuculline, picrotoxin and pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) in mice was examined. Low doses of CL 218,872 enhanced the convulsions produced by all agents except PTZ. An anticonvulsant action of CL 218,872 was observed at higher doses. Since CL 218,872 exhibits proconvulsive effects at low doses, and a proconvulsant action is a characteristic of compounds classified as BDZ antagonists, it appears that CL 218,872 has some antagonist action.", 
    "19": "A number of beta-carboline analogs have been obtained or synthesized, and their in vitro receptor affinities and in vivo antagonist activities determined. The choice of analogs was made in order to explore the importance of the N9 -H, the aromatic nitrogen and the C3-ester moiety for high-receptor affinity and antagonist activity of this class of benzodiazepine antagonist. Among the analogs investigated, we describe the properties of 3-cyano-beta-carboline (1h), the first potent beta-carboline antagonist without a carbonyl at the C3-position. The results obtained indicate: (1) Specific interactions of the C3-substituent with key cationic receptor sites rather than electron-withdrawing properties are important for high-receptor affinity and antagonist activity. (2) Specific in-plane interactions of the aromatic nitrogen with a cationic receptor site, rather than stacking with neutral aromatic residues of the receptor are also important for high affinity and antagonist activity. (3) While the presence of an N9 -H enhances receptor affinity, interaction with an anionic receptor site does not appear essential for antagonist activity.", 
    "20": "37 patients with endoscopically confirmed gastric ulcers received either cimetidine (19 patients) or pirenzepine (18 patients) in a double-blind trial. At 4 weeks, 53% of the patients treated with cimetidine and 44% of those treated with pirenzepine had endoscopically healed ulcers. At 8 weeks, complete healing had occurred in 83% of the patients taking cimetidine and 71% of those taking pirenzepine. These differences are not statistically significant.", 
    "21": "Centrally acting drugs often act 'biphasically', especially on animal locomotor activities: the same drug stimulates and depresses, depending either on dose or on time since administration. We propose a third, hitherto neglected, type of biphasic effect, well illustrated by chlordiazepoxide, which depends, instead, on the length of time an animal is exposed to a test environment: in an unfamiliar Y-maze, rats' spontaneous locomotion (number of entries into the arms of the Y) was stimulated to begin with, but switched to depression in a few minutes. The stimulant phase appeared to be independent of dose, while the depressant phase showed log linear dose dependence.", 
    "22": "[3H]Oxotremorine-M has been used as a ligand to label muscarinic binding sites on membranes prepared from rat fore-brain and heart. In rat brain membranes, two binding sites could be identified: a high affinity low capacity site and a low affinity high capacity site. In contrast, only a high affinity site could be labelled in heart membranes. The potency order of agonists for the high affinity site in brain membranes and heart membranes was the same, suggesting that these binding sites represent the same subtype of muscarinic receptors. However, the affinity of pirenzepine for the brain high affinity site was higher than that for the heart high affinity site suggesting that these sites may represent different receptor populations. The potency order of agonists for the high affinity and low affinity sites in brain membranes were significantly different suggesting that these binding sites represent pharmacologically distinct binding sites. GTP abolished the high affinity sites in heart and brain membranes, but the low affinity site in brain membranes appeared unaffected. These results are consistent with the hypothesis proposing subtypes of muscarinic receptors.", 
    "23": "Mianserin (5-20 mg/kg), like chlordiazepoxide (2.5-10 mg/kg), inhibits the shock-induced suppression of drinking (SSD) in rats. However, in contrast to chlordiazepoxide, the effect of mianserin is not blocked by the benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788 (10 mg/kg). Although mianserin does not inhibit [3H]diazepam binding in vitro it has now been found to enhance [3H]flunitrazepam binding to mouse whole brain in vivo at 10-100 mg/kg p.o. These results suggest that mianserin does influence central benzodiazepine receptors, but the mechanism by which it does so differs from that of chlordiazepoxide.", 
    "24": "The binding of [3H]Ro 5-4864 and [3H]methylclonazepam to membranes prepared from adult rat spinal cord has been studied in vitro. Scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms suggested that both 3H-labeled ligands bind to single binding sites ([3H]Ro 5-4864 Kd = 2 nM, [3H]methylclonazepam Kd = 3.5 nM), although [3H]Ro 5-4864 bound to 3 times the number of sites labeled by [3H]methylclonazepam (respective Bmax values were 15 vs 5.3 pmol/g tissue). Displacement experiments with clonazepam, flunitrazepam and Ro 5-4864 indicated that [3H]Ro 5-4864 and [3H]methylclonazepam binding had the expected pharmacologic specificity for peripheral and central benzodiazepine recognition sites respectively (i.e. [3H]methylclonazepam binding was sensitive to clonazepam but not Ro 5-4864 whereas [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding was potently inhibited by Ro 5-4864 but not clonazepam. Flunitrazepam had similar affinities for both sites). Thus, in addition to central type benzodiazepine receptors, the rat spinal cord contains comparatively high concentrations of peripheral benzodiazepine recognition sites.", 
    "25": "The effects of several beta-carboline and purine ligands for benzodiazepine receptors were studied upon GABA (4-aminobutyric acid) responses and upon diazepam enhancement of GABA responses, using mouse spinal cord neurons in dissociated cell culture. While the potent convulsant beta-carboline DMCM (methyl-6,7-dimethyoxy-4-ethyl-carboline-3-carboxylate), reduced GABA responses, methyl-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta CCMe) and the corresponding ethyl ester (beta CCEt) did not alter GABA responses. The propyl ester (beta CCPr) enhanced GABA responses in a concentration-dependent fashion, while both beta CCMe and beta CCPr blocked diazepam enhancement of GABA responses. beta CCPr may thus have partial agonist activity. Two purines with moderate benzodiazepine receptor affinity, 1-methylisoguanosine (MeIG) and 6-dimethylaminopurine (DMAP), weakly enhanced GABA responses. MeIG also significantly antagonized diazepam enhancement of GABA responses. Inosine and hypoxanthine had no apparent actions upon GABA responses or upon diazepam enhancement of such responses. The results with beta-carbolines are consistent with their behavioural profile in vivo and with neurochemical studies of their effects upon GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complexes. Furthermore, certain purines are also able to interact with these complexes.", 
    "26": "The effects on GABA (4-aminobutyric acid) responses of several benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor ligands were examined using mouse spinal cord neurons in dissociated cell culture. Diazepam, clonazepam and nitrazepam enhanced GABA responses potently at low nanomolar concentrations. Diazepam and clonazepam were most potent with significant enhancement at 1 nM and peak enhancement of 80.7 and 50.2% at 10 nM respectively. Nitrazepam was least potent with no significant enhancement at 1 nM and enhancement of only 20.7% at 10 nM. The benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788, blocked enhancement by diazepam but also weakly enhanced GABA responses at low micromolar concentrations, suggesting partial agonist activity. The convulsant benzodiazepine, Ro 5-4864, did not enhance GABA responses at any concentration tested but antagonized GABA responses at 1 microM and above. Diazepam shifted GABA dose-response curves to the left by decreasing the apparent KD but without altering the apparent Vmax (Lineweaver-Burk analysis). Two nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic/anticonvulsants, CL 218872 and zopiclone, were weak enhancers of GABA responses at high nanomolar concentrations. These results with benzodiazepines, CL 218872 and zopiclone are consistent with their anxiolytic and anticonvulsant profile in vivo and with studies of their effects upon low affinity GABA binding in vitro.", 
    "27": "The pathophysiologic mechanisms of spasmodic torticollis and other idiopathic torsion dystonias remain unknown. Thus, a variety of drugs have been used alone or in combination on an empirical basis to treat these disorders, but to date none have efficacy that is proven and consistent. The drugs in use include anti-cholinergics, benzodiazepines, dopaminergics , and neuroleptics. The variable responses that have been observed are due in part to the heterogeneous nature of these disorders. Trial of several agents or combinations of agents may be necessary before symptoms are satisfactorily controlled. Only when a patient's symptoms are refractory to all medical treatment should he or she be considered a candidate for neurosurgical procedures.", 
    "28": "1-(2-o-Chlorobenzoyl-4-chlorophenyl)-5-glycyl-aminomethyl-3- dimethylcarbamoyl -1H-1,2,4-triazole hydrochloride dihydrate, (450191-S), exhibits pronounced central nervous system (CNS) activities similar to those of benzodiazepines, but it has only low affinity for benzodiazepine receptors. However, when 450191-S was administered to rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg, brain extracts markedly inhibited [3H]diazepam binding to the receptors. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and radioreceptor assay (RRA) were used to isolate three metabolites that could inhibit [3H]diazepam binding prominently. These were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) as compounds having the triazolo-benzodiazepine skeleton. They showed high affinities for benzodiazepine receptors (Ki = 0.9 to 2.1 nM) and exerted potent pharmacological effects similar to those of 450191-S. In addition, their levels in the brain were sufficient to explain the pharmacological activity of 450191-S, which could not be detected in tissue extracts 15 min after administration. These results indicate that the pharmacological activity of 450191-S is largely due to the action of active metabolites, although some points remain to be elucidated to fully account for the large attenuation of the side effect (ataxia) compared with the major effects (anti-convulsant and hypnotic). We also determined the brain levels of metabolites following the administration of 450191-S and evaluated the extent to which each active metabolite contributes to the pharmacological activities of this drug.", 
    "29": "Rats trained to discriminate 3.0 mg/kg of diazepam from saline in a two-lever operant choice task were challenged with the racemic mixture and optical isomers of 3- methylflunitrazepam or pentobarbital. Generalization of the diazepam stimulus was found to occur to (+/-)- and S(+)-3- methylflunitrazepam , with the S(+)-isomer being twice as active as the racemate. Diazepam stimulus generalization also occurred to (+/-)-, S(-)-, and R(+)-pentobarbital, with the S(-)-isomer being approximately twice as active as (+/-)- or R(+)-pentobarbital. In addition, the administration of the imidazobenzodiazepine Ro 15-1788, a selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, prior to benzodiazepine or barbiturate administration competitively antagonized the discriminative stimulus properties of the benzodiazepines but was completely ineffective in attenuating the discriminative stimulus effect of the barbiturates. The results of this study suggest that benzodiazepines exert their stimulus effects by a stereoselective interaction at a benzodiazepine receptor and that stereochemical factors are important in evaluating the stimulus properties of benzodiazepines or barbiturates.", 
    "30": "A case of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome with some peculiar aspects is described. The disease started with painless dyspepsia, watery diarrhea, relevant loss of body weight and absence of peptic ulcer. After a steroid treatment performed at home without any rationale, diarrhea stopped totally for 18 months and body weight returned to normal. Subsequently, the disease recurred with more typical clinical characters: juxtapyloric ulcer, increase in serum gastrin levels and positive secretin test, presence of gastrinomas at angiography. The monitoring of gastric pH showed a persistent hyperacidity during medical treatment with H2 and muscarinic antagonists. The localization of gastrinomas was extrapancreatic, at the root of jejunal mesentery. Excellent results were obtained by surgical treatment which consisted in resection of the principal neoplastic masses with total gastrectomy. The patient's general conditions after two years are good.", 
    "31": "The chronic ventilatory effects of several hypnotics were investigated in six conscious cats recorded during control periods and during three consecutive days' administration of either diazepam (5 mg), pentobarbital (30 mg) or phenobarbital (60 mg). Ventilation was analyzed in terms of tidal volume (VT), breathing rate (BR) and minute ventilation (V = VT X BR). Minute ventilation was increased with diazepam owing to an increase in breathing rate in spite of a small decrease in tidal volume. With pentobarbital, minute ventilation was not changed because the decrease in breathing rate was compensated for by an increase in tidal volume. With phenobarbital, the results were more variable from one animal to another and on average, only tidal volume was increased. The animals were often excited following the administration of diazepam and sometimes drowsy with pentobarbital; with phenobarbital, behaviour varied among animals. Obviously, the present results cannot be extrapolated if different doses and perhaps different duration of drug administration are used. It is suggested that the ventilatory effects of the drugs cannot be explained only by a direct action on the brain stem respiratory network. Since the level of vigilance was altered by the various drugs, it is proposed that the ventilatory changes observed could be secondary to a supra-pontine action of the drugs which could modify both the level of alertness and respiratory activity.", 
    "32": "Ligand binding to alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic, serotonin, benzodiazepine and GABA receptors was studied in neocortex and hippocampus of controls and patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer-type. A selective loss of serotonergic binding sites characterised as a loss of both S1 and S2 sites was observed. The reduction in serotonin receptors did not correlate with a clinical assessment of the degree of dementia, or with the extent of Alzheimer-type neuropathological change.", 
    "33": "A series of healthy volunteers received a single 7.5-mg intravenous dose of diazepam on one occasion and a single 15-mg oral dose of slow-release diazepam (DZ-SR) on another occasion. Diazepam concentrations were measured by gas chromatography in multiple plasma samples drawn during seven days after each dose. Absorption of diazepam from DZ-SR was slow, with mean +/- S.E. peak concentrations attained at 3.8 +/- 0.5 hours after dosage. Absolute bioavailability of DZ-SR averaged 0.98 +/- 0.06. In two other studies, diazepam absorption from DZ-SR was evaluated when coadministered with a standard breakfast or with an antacid preparation (Maalox). Neither food nor antacid altered the rate of diazepam absorption and did not impair the completeness of absorption. Higher peak total plasma diazepam concentrations occurred in the postprandial as opposed to the fasting state, but this was an artifact of reduced protein binding (increased free fraction) due to fasting. Thus, diazepam absorption from DZ-SR is slow and essentially complete.", 
    "34": "The stimulus control of behavior by diazepam (1.0 mg/kg) was investigated where responding was maintained under fixed-ratio (FR) schedules of stimulus-shock termination in rats. The size of the FR requirement was either 1, 5, 10, or 20 responses. At each FR requirement, dose-effect curves were determined for diazepam, flurazepam, pentobarbital and cyproheptadine. Diazepam-like discriminative stimuli were produced by flurazepam and pentobarbital but not by cyproheptadine. The magnitude of the FR requirement had no significant effect on the dose-effect curves for percentage of responses emitted on the diazepam-appropriate choice lever for any of the four drugs. On the other hand, the effects of these drugs on rates of responding depended on the magnitude of the FR requirement. None of the drugs altered response rates under the FR1 schedule. Diazepam tended to increase response rates under the FR5 schedule, but had no effect or decreased rates under the FR10 and FR20 schedules. Flurazepam and pentobarbital predominantly decreased rates at FR requirements of 5, 10 or 20 responses. Cyproheptadine had no significant effect on response rates at any schedule parameter. Together with previous reports, the present results indicate that the discriminative effects of diazepam are similar under schedules employing noxious (this study) or non-noxious (other reports) consequences, even though the effects on response rates of diazepam-like drugs differ depending on the schedule of reinforcement and consequent event maintaining the behavior.", 
    "35": "[3H]Diazepam binding was assayed in situ on living cultures of fetal mouse cerebral cortex or glia in an attempt to further characterize the high and low affinity binding sites. Mixed neuronal-glial cultures were found to have a high (Kd approximately equal to 10 nM) as well as a low (Kd approximately equal to 240 nM) affinity binding site. Glial cultures also had a similarly high affinity site (Kd 13 nM). In both types of cultures, the high affinity site was Ro 5-4864 sensitive and clonazepam resistant. Since Ro 5-4864 has particular affinity for non-neuronal elements and clonazepam for neuronal elements, the data suggest that the high affinity binding site may be localized to glial elements and the low affinity site primarily neuronal.", 
    "36": "Nine poor sleepers of mean age 61 years took part in a double-blind, balanced order study in which, during three periods of 3 weeks, each took lormetazepam 1 mg, lormetazepam 2.5 mg, and flurazepam 30 mg. Using electrophysiological measures, sleep was found to increase by 0.75 h with each treatment condition, mainly through more of stage 2 sleep. The treatments reduced the delay to sleep and led to fewer and shorter awakenings, with little difference among the three treatments. Slow-wave sleep was reduced by flurazepam and by lormetazepam 2.5 mg. After flurazepam intake ceased, there was evidence of persisting drug effects for as long as 7 nights. In contrast, when lormetazepam 2.5 mg ceased, there was significant rebound reduction of sleep duration below baseline for up to 3 withdrawal nights, and there was a similar though non-significant trend after lormetazepam 1 mg had ceased. Wakefulness in the final 2 h of nocturnal recording during the third week of drug intake was significantly reduced below baseline by flurazepam, but was little affected by lormetazepam. The differences among the treatment conditions could be attributed to the long-persistence of flurazepam vs the more rapid elimination of lormetazepam.", 
    "37": "Midazolam 0.07 mg/kg was compared with diazepam 0.12 mg/kg intravenously as an adjuvant to ketamine anaesthesia in healthy patients undergoing minor gynaecological operations of less than 15 minutes duration. The occurrence of induction and emergence sequelae, and patient acceptance of the technique was assessed by means of a questionnaire. The incidence of unpleasant dreams was 6.7% with midazolam and 26.7% with diazepam. There was no significant difference in any other sequelae. Overall patient acceptance was high at 96.7%.", 
    "38": "In a double-blind study, a new fast-dissolving formulation of oxazepam used as sole premedicant in patients undergoing neurosurgery, was assessed with particular reference to its effect on the levels of anxiety, consciousness and orientation of the patients pre- and postoperatively. The results show that when given at least one hour pre-operatively the new preparation is a highly effective anxiolytic with minimal sedative or other side-effects, is convenient to administer and has high patient acceptability.", 
    "39": "Latrodectus mactans has now invaded towns and cities. The spider's venom is a neurotoxin that causes little local reaction but produces pain and spasm in large skeletal muscle groups within 30 minutes to three hours after the bite. Severe envenomation may result in respiratory failure and coma. First aid is of no value. Muscle relaxants are useful in treatment, as is calcium gluconate. Antivenin is indicated for high-risk victims, such as those with hypertension and persons younger than 16 or older than 60 years of age.", 
    "40": "The influence of volatile anaesthetics (halothane, enflurane) on the serum protein binding of three highly bound basic drugs has been studied in vitro by equilibrium dialysis. Radioactive labelled isotopes were used for the determination of drug concentrations. Enflurane, halothane and the halothane metabolite trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) inhibited the binding of diazepam to serum and to its main binding protein, albumin. The binding of diazepam to albumin was inhibited in a competitive manner and was not related to the anaesthetic potency of the vapours. Thus the observed displacement of diazepam should be regarded as a side-effect of the volatile anaesthetics. The binding of propranolol and prazosin in serum was not significantly influenced by the investigated anaesthetics. At clinically relevant concentrations of the anaesthetics, diazepam was displaced significantly only by enflurane with an increase in free fraction of 60% in serum. TFA in concentrations seen after operation significantly increased the free fraction of diazepam up to 90%. We conclude that enflurane anaesthesia may temporarily potentiate the pharmacological effect of diazepam and that, in the postoperative period following halothane anaesthesia, a more rapid elimination of diazepam could be expected.", 
    "41": "In a residential hospital research ward setting, the effects of and preference for placebo, oxazepam (480 mg) and diazepam (40, 80 and 160 mg) were studied in human volunteers with histories of sedative drug abuse. Doses p.o. were administered every 3rd day under double-blind conditions. After an initial exposure to the letter-coded test drugs, a series of choice days was scheduled on which subjects chose between two available drug alternatives. Compared with oxazepam, diazepam produced greater liking (area under the time-action curve), peak liking and euphoria and was judged to be of greater monetary street value. Diazepam was categorized as producing barbiturate-like subjective effects more frequently than was oxazepam (54 vs. 21%), whereas oxazepam was identified as placebo more often than diazepam (32 vs. 4%). Diazepam was associated with a more rapid onset of effect than was oxazepam, and this rapid onset was repeatedly cited by subjects in poststudy written comments as being a desirable feature of the drug effect. In choice tests, 80 and 160 mg of diazepam were preferred to 480 mg of oxazepam on 62.5 and 91.7% of the choice tests, respectively. In choice tests between placebo and drug, placebo was never preferred to diazepam; however, placebo was preferred to oxazepam on 21.4% of choice tests. Overall, these results extend previous experimental observations suggesting that diazepam has a higher abuse liability than oxazepam. The results are also compatible with an analysis of epidemiological data showing that diazepam abuse uniformly exceeds oxazepam abuse on seven epidemiological measures of drug abuse.", 
    "42": "We have studied the influence of the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), the vitamin A derivative retinoic acid and the benzodiazepine diazepam on intercellular communication via established gap junctions in a monolayer of rat liver epithelial cells (RLB) at various times of incubation. Intercellular communication was measured as the transfer of [3H]hypoxanthine-derived nucleotides between RLB hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase+ (HPRT+) and RLB HPRT- cells. TPA only showed transient inhibition of metabolic cooperation: after 4 h of treatment, intercellular communication was reduced to about 40% of the control and longer treatments showed progressively less effect until 24 h of treatment, when no difference was seen between TPA-treated and control preparations. Retinoic acid was a more effective inhibitor: both 3 X 10(-6) M applied for 24 h and 10(-4) M applied for 6.5 h, caused a 50% inhibition of label transfer. The junctional communication could only be blocked at very high concentrations (5 X 10(-4) M) in short-exposure experiments, but this is possibly a consequence of non-specific effects on the cell membrane. When the incubation time was 24 h, a considerable portion of the gap junctions appeared to persist in the 'open' state. Diazepam showed no significant inhibitory effect in the experiments performed.", 
    "43": "The effect of renal disease on lorazepam kinetics was assessed in three groups: six normal subjects, six patients with renal impairment, and four functionally anephric patients. Subjects received single 1.5- or 3-mg intravenous and oral doses; eight subjects (four normal and four with renal impairment) also received 0.5-mg oral doses three times a day. Lorazepam and lorazepam glucuronide were determined in plasma, urine, and feces by a highly sensitive gas chromatographic method. After single doses, t1/2 and V beta increased in patients, but Cls in the patients (about 85 ml/min) did not differ significantly from that in normals (71 ml/min). Absorption of oral dose was more than 90% and was not impaired by the disease state. Renal and fecal excretion of intact lorazepam accounted for only about 2% of the dose. The major route of drug elimination was hepatic biotransformation to lorazepam glucuronide, an inactive, nontoxic metabolite eliminated by the kidney. In both the normal and renally impaired groups, about 64% of the dose was recovered as glucuronide in urine and less than 0.4% in feces. Fecal excretion contributed very little to the overall elimination of lorazepam and its glucuronide in all groups. Only 8% of the intact drug was removed by 6-hr hemodialysis, but 40% was removed as glucuronide conjugate. Lorazepam kinetics after subchronic dosing were linear. The difference in Clo between the normal and renally impaired groups was not significant. Since the mean steady-state concentration depends on drug clearance only, and since clearance is not altered, no dosage adjustment appears necessary for patients with renal disease.", 
    "44": "A double-blind randomized clinical trial of the effectiveness of orally administered diazepam in reducing dental anxiety was conducted. Forty-one subjects were assigned to a diazepam or placebo group and tested, using the Dental Fear Survey and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Diazepam was effective in reducing anxiety scores but not dental fear scores.", 
    "45": "Motor agitation developing in some white rats during painful stimulation of other individual decreases under the action of phenasepam (the most effective drug used in clinic in cases of neurotic alarm). This effect is accompanied by strengthening of tendency to reside in closed space. After phenasepam injection, increased not goal-directed motor activity developing against the background of reduced alimentary reactions also decreases in a part of grey rats selected by their ability to extrapolate, while their alimentary behaviour intensifies. Thus, initial peculiarities of behaviour i.e. enhanced motor activity not directed to fulfillment of the above forms of inborn behaviour (residing in closed space and eating) may be considered as a manifestation of anxiety. In this case, these forms of behaviour have a defensive function.", 
    "46": "10 mg of diazepam in fat emulsion was given for premedication intramuscularly to 106 patients. In 53% of the cases patients were well sedated, 33% were apprehensive, 14% anxious. Pain related to the injection was complained of by 4 patients. Plasma concentration of diazepam at induction (60 minutes after the injection) was 130 ng/ml. Compared to diazepam in propylene glycol, pain at the injection side was less frequent while the level of sedation and the plasma concentration of diazepam were similar.", 
    "47": "Starting from a study of memory performances while prescription in double blind of lorazepam (2 mg/day) versus tiapride (100 mg/day), during ten days, to patients over sixty years of age, the authors try to analyse the links between anxiety, anxiolysis and attention and memory capacities. Results seem to indicate that beyond anxiolysis, these products could have an independent action over memory performances. Statistical trial of results show significantly that performances decrease under lorazepam and increase under tiapride.", 
    "48": "During 18 months 100 children were submitted to a longitudinal study, in order to compare the efficacy of treatment with administration of intermittent rectal diazepam versus oral BID phenobarbital therapy, for prevention of febrile seizures. The group was divide in a randomized trial. Rectal diazepam was administered at dose os 0.5 mg/kg dose and the dose was repeated every eight hours during the period of fever. Diazepam was found to be as effective as oral phenobarbital in the prevention of new febrile seizures.", 
    "49": "Parkinsonian patients are usually given several drugs concomitantly with bromocriptine, with variable results. The possibility of interference of these drugs with the availability of bromocriptine in the brain was investigated by measuring bromocriptine concentrations in the striatum in rats. After a single injection, bromocriptine concentration in the striatum was 13.1 +/- 2.9 ng/mg protein. Naloxone, an opiate receptor blocker, was found to produce the largest increase in bromocriptine content (21.7 +/- 2.5 ng/mg protein). Amantadine, diazepam and haloperidol produced the largest decreases (3.2 +/- 0.9, 3.3 +/- 0.8 and 4.4 +/- 1.2 ng/mg protein, respectively). Rats given L-dopa or benzodiazepine also showed slightly lower levels of bromocriptine.", 
    "50": "The authors describe a positive but transient effect of additional administration of tryptophan in 3 children with Lennox-Gastaut epilepsy in whom anticonvulsants alone failed to control the attacks. Further observations are necessary, especially for studying the correlation of doses with blood drug level.", 
    "51": "The influence of a number of 1,4-Benzodiazepines was investigated on morphine and aminopyrine metabolism and on oestrone and p-nitrophenol glucuronidation, in rat liver microsomes. Benzodiazepines inhibited in a differential degree the N-demethylase activities for morphine and aminopyrine N-demethylation as well as glucuronyltransferase activity for morphine. Oestrone glucuronyltransferase activity was markedly stimulated by certain benzodiazepines whereas p-nitrophenol glucuronidation was not altered. A structure activity relationship in the inhibition of morphine and aminopyrine metabolism by benzodiazepines was observed. In fact, the presence of halogens at C-2, a methyl group at N-1 and a methylene substituent instead of a keto group at C-3 in the benzodiazepine structure increased the inhibitory effect. The possible role of these metabolic pathways of other substituents in the benzodiazepines, is discussed.", 
    "52": "Ten healthy volunteers were injected i.v. with 5 mg Ro 15-1788, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, or placebo in a double-blind randomised design. In the EEG, Ro 15-1788 led--with some topographical variations--to a diminution of theta and alpha power, an increase of alpha mean frequency and a decrease of delta mean frequency. In auditory evoked potentials, the N1P2 and P2N2 amplitudes decreased. The electrophysiological changes induced by Ro 15-1788 are consistent with a central stimulant action. Ro 15-1788 induced some slight behavioural and subjective changes.", 
    "53": "The problem of antiepileptic drug interactions is significant in that many epileptic patients are treated with multiple drug therapy. Moreover, patients may also be receiving additional medication for other concurrent disorders. Most drug interactions are pharmacokinetic, involving changes in absorption, protein binding, metabolism, or excretion. As a result, plasma levels of the antiepileptic drug may decrease leading to exacerbation of seizures. Alternatively, plasma levels may rise resulting in toxic side effects. Similar changes may also occur with drugs given for other disorders. In this paper, possible mechanisms of drug interactions are discussed. This is followed by a description of clinically significant interactions involving phenytoin, carbamazepine, barbiturates, valproic acid, benzodiazepines, and succinimides. Potentially serious drug interactions may be minimized by using as few medications as possible and by regularly monitoring plasma levels of antiepileptic drugs.", 
    "54": "Sex-related differences in the disposition of some analgesics, anxiolytics and hypnotics have recently been reported. With certain benzodiazepines, sex has been shown to be a more important determinant of variability in drug disposition than age, while with other benzodiazepines an age-related decline in clearance was more pronounced in men than women. In young healthy adults these sex-related differences in drug disposition were related to the phase of the menstrual cycle, oral contraceptive steroid administration, and variations in plasma concentrations of albumin, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, free fatty acids and sex hormones. While none of the sex-related differences so far reported necessitates the modification of a therapeutic dosage regimen, it is prudent that future protocols for pharmacokinetic studies should regard age, sex, the menstrual cycle and oral contraceptive steroids as potential sources of variability.",

    "56": "Chemotherapy protocols that induce severe protracted nausea and vomiting are stressful for cancer patients, and the fear that may be associated with chemotherapy often outweighs other negative aspects of the cancer experience. The clinical management of chemotherapy-induced emesis involves pharmacologic approaches, maintenance of hydration, provision of emotional support, and the possible use of behavioral relaxation techniques. We review the literature on the psychological side effects of chemotherapy and offer recommendations for the pharmacologic, supportive, and behavioral treatment of chemotherapy-induced emesis. More effective management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting also enhances patient compliance and therefore potentially decreases overall morbidity and mortality.", 
    "57": "Characterization of the binding of derivatives of beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, a putative endogenous ligand for benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors, has not previously been attempted in normal human brain. In the present study, we demonstrated saturable, high affinity binding of [3H] propyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate [3H] PrCC) in normal human frontal cerebral cortex and cerebellum exhibiting pharmacological specificity similar to [3H] diazepam and [3H] flunitrazepam binding. The binding of [3H] PrCC is increased by chloride and GABA, but decreased by divalent cations, especially calcium. The profile of [3H] PrCC binding in human brain reflects specific interaction with BZ/ionophore/GABA receptor complexes.", 
    "58": "Food intake was monitored in three female and one male adult rabbits following the administration of three drugs known to result in feeding increases in other species. The drugs, diazepam (1.0 mg/kg), cyproheptadine (0.03 mg/kg) and chlorpromazine (1.0 mg/kg) all produced large increases in food intake; of these, only the effect of diazepam, a benzodiazepine, was reversed by doses of the benzodiazepine antagonists Ro 15-1788 (0.3 mg/kg) and Ethyl beta-carboxylate (beta-CCE) (1.0 mg/kg) which, when given alone, did not affect feeding. The results support evidence suggesting that Ro 15-1788 and beta-CCE are specific antagonists of the benzodiazepine receptor and of their effects on a wide range of behaviors.", 
    "59": "Research on the effect of the benzodiazepines, Valium, and Librium on human psychomotor and cognitive functions is reviewed. Benzodiazepines which are the most important antianxiety medications also have anticonvulsant, hypnotic-sedative, and muscle-relaxant properties. Research on the benzodiazepine hypnotic \"hangover\" effects on cognitive and motor behavior is cited. The benzodiazepines Valium and Librium probably interact with neurotransmitters, especially GABA and very likely have specific receptors in the brain and central nervous system. Absorption and elimination rate vary with dosage, method of administration, and age. Valium and Librium have no gravely harmful side effects, little addictive potential; danger from overdosage is minimal. Although controlled studies of the impact of psychoactive drugs on psychomotor and cognitive performance are relatively recent, Valium and Librium apparently have little, if any, adverse effect on well established higher mental functions and may affect the speed with which simple repetitive motor actions are performed. None of their effects are irreversible. Benzodiazepines (BZ) have been remarkable drugs. They have virtually replaced all other forms of antianxiety medications (48, 95, 109, 225). All the BZ drugs additionally have anticonvulsant, sedative-hypnotic, and muscle-relaxant properties (4, 77, 88, 112, 252). Two of the BZ drugs, Valium (diazepam) and Librium (chlordiazepoxide) have been the best sellers of the BZ drug family and the most frequently prescribed drugs in the world (7, 15, 17, 77, 110, 137, 215, 257). The impact of Valium and Librium on human psychomotor and cognitive functions is the focus of this review of research. Since millions of people are using these drugs, how do Valium and Librium affect alertness and responsiveness, for example, in driving a car to work, or operating a machine in a factory (240)? Tranquilizing drugs like Valium and Librium were hailed when they replaced sedatives like barbiturates because they did not cloud the mind. Is decision-making or mental alertness affected in those who use Valium or Librium (69)? In studying the impact of drugs on the central nervous system (CNS) and brain, animal subjects frequently are employed. However, the human condition of anxiety for which Valium and Librium are usually prescribed is hard to evaluate and human subjects vary greatly, so that this review of research has been limited for the most part to studies with human subjects (8, 26, 50, 107, 108, 262, 263, 264).", 
    "60": "Histochemical and biochemical studies demonstrate that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamic acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.15), and GABA aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.19) are present in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. Moreover, [3H]GABA can be taken up and stored by primary cultures of adrenal chromaffin cells. Nicotinic receptor stimulation or KCl depolarization releases the [3H]GABA taken up by these cell cultures. GABA and benzodiazepine recognition sites located in chromaffin cells interact with each other with modalities similar to those described for GABA and benzodiazepine recognition sites located in synaptic membranes prepared from brain tissue. Bicuculline facilitates the release of catecholamine from chromaffin cells induced by nicotinic receptor stimulation but it fails to influence the release of catecholamine evoked by K+ depolarization. Since the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor system appears to modulate nicotinic receptor function, it is suggested that GABA transmission might participate in modulating responsiveness of chromaffin cells to incoming cholinergic stimuli.", 
    "61": "Benzodiazepines in micromolar concentrations significantly inhibit depolarization-sensitive Ca2+ uptake in intact nerve-terminal preparations. Benzodiazepine inhibition of Ca2+ uptake is concentration dependent and stereospecific. Micromolar-affinity benzodiazepine receptors have been identified and characterized in brain membrane and shown to be distinct from nanomolar-affinity benzodiazepine receptors. Evidence is presented that micromolar, and not nanomolar, benzodiazepine binding sites mediate benzodiazepine inhibition of Ca2+ uptake. Irreversible binding to micromolar benzodiazepine binding sites also irreversibly blocked depolarization-dependent Ca2+ uptake in synaptosomes, indicating that these compounds may represent a useful marker for identifying the molecular components of Ca2+ channels in brain. Characterization of benzodiazepine inhibition of Ca2+ uptake demonstrates that these drugs function as Ca2+ channel antagonists, because benzodiazepines effectively blocked voltage-sensitive Ca2+ uptake inhibited by Mn2+, Co2+, verapamil, nitrendipine, and nimodipine. These results indicate that micromolar benzodiazepine binding sites regulate voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels in brain membrane and suggest that some of the neuronal stabilizing effects of micromolar benzodiazepine receptors may be mediated by the regulation of Ca2+ conductance.", 
    "62": "Calcium modulates sodium-independent binding of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to GABAA and GABAB recognition sites located in synaptic membranes of rat brain. At 37 degrees the binding of [3H]GABA to the GABAB recognition site is dramatically stimulated by Ca2+ with an EC50 (half-saturation constant) of congruent to 10 microns, whereas the binding to the GABAA recognition site is only slightly, but significantly, potentiated by Ca2+ with an EC50 of congruent to 0.1-1.0 micron. The effect of calcium on GABAA recognition sites requires a temperature of 37 degrees and the presence of calmodulin. Only GABAA recognition sites are linked to benzodiazepine recognition sites, and the interaction between these sites is modulated by Ca2+ at physiological ion concentrations. When free Ca2+ in the assay medium is below 10 nM, only one population of low-affinity GABAA recognition sites can be measured; however, when free Ca2+ is at the micromolar level, or if diazepam is present, a high affinity-binding site appears in addition to the pre-existing low-affinity component. On the basis of affinity there is a single population of GABAB bindings sites, but the number of sites is about 90% greater at 37 degrees than at 4 degrees. This temperature-dependent increase in the number of GABAB recognition sites is calmodulin-independent, and data with leupeptin, hemin, and antipain suggest that this temperature-dependent increase in GABAB sites might involve the activity of Ca2+-dependent protease(s)."
