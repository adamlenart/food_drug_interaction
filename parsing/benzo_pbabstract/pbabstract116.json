The present study was designed to explore the modulation of the effects of PHOS on convulsions by neurosteroids, progesterone (PROG), and 4'-chlorodiazepam (4'-CD), in both acute and chronic seizure models. In acute study, seizures were induced by either pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) injection or maximal electroshock seizures, while in the chronic study, kindling was induced by injecting PTZ (30\u00a0mg/kg, s.c.) on alternate days three times in a week. Oxidative stress was assessed in the brain by measuring the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and non-protein thiol (NP-SH). PROG and 4'-CD were able to modulate the PHOS-induced convulsions in acute PTZ convulsions as well as in chronic kindling model. However, they failed to reverse the derangements in oxidative stress parameters of MDA and NP-SH produced by PHOS in kindled animals. PROG significantly increased the AChE activity in untreated rats, while PROG and 4'-CD reversed the AChE activity inhibition induced by PHOS. The study indicates a possible anticonvulsive mechanism of neurosteroids, since both PROG and 4'-CD reversed PHOS-induced inhibition of AChE activity. The neurosteroids seem to play a protective role in PHOS-induced convulsions besides their antioxidant property.",

Diazepam and nifedipine were used as model drugs. Two types of carriers were used; polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP K12, K30 and K60) and saccharides (inulin 1.8 kDa, 4 kDa and 6.5 kDa). Solid dispersions with various drug loads were prepared by lyophilization. It was found that the drug solubility in aqueous PVP solutions was significantly increased indicating the presence of drug-carrier interaction while the drug solubility was not affected by the saccharides indicating absence of drug-carrier interaction. X-ray powder diffraction and modulated differential scanning calorimetry revealed that all solid dispersions were fully amorphous. Dissolution behavior of solid dispersion tablets based on either the PVPs or saccharides was governed by both dissolution of the carrier and drug load. It was shown that a fast drug dissolution of solid dispersions with a high drug load could be obtained with carrier that showed interaction with the drug.",

    "14": "Benzodiazepines are potent psychoactive drugs used for their sedative and anxiolytic properties (1, 2). There are two types of benzodiazepine receptors, which have been designated as central benzodiazepine receptors (CBR) and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR). PBR is also known as translocator protein (TSPO). The CBR is found exclusively in the central nervous system on the membranes of neurons and is coupled to the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid receptor/chloride channel (3). In contrast, the PBR is a mitochondrial protein found in brain and peripheral tissues (adrenal gland, heart, lung, kidney, and testis) (4). The brain has lower levels of PBR than do the peripheral tissues. Both glial cells and macrophages contain high levels of PBR (5-7). Increased PBR expression after brain injury or neuroinflammation is associated with microglial activation, such as occurs with the neuronal damage that accompanies several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy.

    "16": "Berberine ([C20H18NO4](+) ), one of the major constituents of the Chinese herb Rhizoma coptidis, is an isoquinoline alkaloid. Plethora of recent reports has indicated its ability to modulate several neurotransmitter systems, especially those implicated in ethanol dependence. Thus, the influence of berberine treatment on the development and expression of ethanol dependence was tested by using the ethanol withdrawal-induced hyperexcitability paradigm. Mice were provided with a nutritionally balanced control liquid diet as the sole nutrient source on day 0; from day 1-4 (ethanol, 3% v/v), from day 5-7 (ethanol, 6% v/v) and from day 8-10 (ethanol, 10% v/v) was incorporated into the liquid diet. On day 11, the ethanol liquid diet was replaced with nutritionally balanced control liquid diet, and ethanol withdrawal-induced hyperexcitability signs were recorded. The results revealed that acute administration of berberine (10 and 20\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently attenuated ethanol withdrawal-induced hyperexcitability signs, and these results were comparable to diazepam (1.25 and 2.5\u2009mg/kg, i.p.). Further, chronic administration of berberine (10 and 20\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) to the ethanol diet fed mice markedly attenuated the ethanol withdrawal-induced hyperexcitability signs. In conclusion, the results and evidence suggest that berberine exhibited an inhibitory influence against ethanol withdrawal-induced hyperexcitability signs, which could be mediated through its neuromodulatory action.",

Control mice were orally treated with an equal volume of vehicle (4% gum acacia), and positive control mice were treated with diazepam (1mg/kg). In the EPM test, out of pool of 19 master fractions (MF) only MF-14, 16 and 17 significantly (30mg/kg, p<0.05, p<0.01 and p<0.001) increased the number of entries in the open arm.

Distinct spatial and temporal trends were considered and a total of 87 water samples were pre-concentrated by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with an ion trap (IT) analyzer and electrospray ionization (ESI). The maximum concentrations found were 178ng/L for carbamazepine, 3.65ng/L for diazepam, 70.3ng/L for fenofibric acid, 3.18ng/L for propranolol, 15.7ng/L for trimethoprim and 53.3ng/L for sulfamethoxazole. Carbamazepine was the most ubiquitous compound with 100% positive detection frequency followed by propranolol (38%), trimethoprim (34%) and sulfamethoxazole (33%). The pharmaceutical compounds were quantified at higher levels in the lower stretch of the estuary, especially near the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The data proves that pollution of the Douro River estuary by pharmaceuticals is consistent and is occurring in a fairly constant manner in time, covering a wide area and displaying hot-spots. Individually, the concentration levels are not likely to cause acute effects, based on reference experimental data. However, the fact that complex mixtures exist gives cause for concern as regards potentially relevant toxicological risks. The study points out the need for continuous monitoring of contamination levels not only in the Douro River estuary but also in other major estuaries.

We investigated the interaction of chronic treatment (4 months) with olanzapine and a cafeteria diet on metabolic parameters, memory tasks (spatial and aversive), the elevated plus maze and locomotor activity induced by d-amphetamine. Male Wistar rats were separated into the following groups: standard diet vehicle, standard diet and olanzapine, cafeteria diet vehicle and cafeteria diet and olanzapine. Olanzapine was administered in the drinking water (approximately 1.5\u2009mg/kg/day), and after 3 days of treatment, the rats exhibited an expected anxiolytic effect and reduced amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion. After 4 months of treatment, cafeteria diet vehicle and cafeteria diet olanzapine rats exhibited an increased body weight and heavier fat pads compared with the standard diet groups. Olanzapine increased only the epididymal and mesenteric fat pads. The cafeteria diet and olanzapine group showed greater glucose intolerance compared with all other groups. The cafeteria diet altered the effects of chronic olanzapine on the performance in the water maze and inhibitory avoidance tasks. Chronic olanzapine treatment failed to affect amphetamine-induced locomotion and to produce anxiolytic effects in the elevated plus maze task, regardless of the diet. Our results suggest that chronic olanzapine caused an increase in fat pads, which is putatively involved in the etiology of many metabolic diseases. Rats on the cafeteria diet were overweight and exhibited glucose intolerance. We did not observe these effects with olanzapine treatment with the standard diet. Moreover, the chronic treatment regimen caused tolerance to the antipsychotic and anxiolytic effects of olanzapine and seemed to potentiate some of the metabolic effects of the cafeteria diet. The cafeteria diet also modified the effects of chronic treatment with olanzapine on cognitive tasks, which may represent an undesirable effect of poor diets in psychiatric patients.",

    "39": "Recent successes as a pharmacological adjunct to exposure therapy has focused attention on the therapeutic potential of the glycine(B) receptor partial agonist, D-cycloserine (DCS), in certain clinical anxiety disorders. Although widely believed to reflect a facilitation of extinction learning, previous research with DCS and other glycine(B) partial agonists suggests the additional possibility of intrinsic anxiolytic activity. In the present study, ethological methods were used to profile the behavioural effects of DCS (7.5-30.0mg/kg) and the positive control chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 15 mg/kg) in mice exposed to the elevated plus-maze for the first time (plus-maze trial 1; Experiment 1) and in mice pre-exposed undrugged to the maze 24h prior to testing (plus-maze trial 2; Experiment 2). The results show that, in test-naive animals, both CDP and DCS (15 mg/kg, but not lower or higher doses) produced significant anxioselective profiles with the effects of DCS statistically weaker than those of CDP. However, as predicted by the plus-maze retest effect, CDP was without behavioural activity in test-experienced animals, while the highest dose of DCS (30 mg/kg) induced behavioural changes more consistent with mild psychomotor stimulation than anxiolysis. Present findings therefore confirm the intrinsic anxiolytic activity of DCS in untrained animals, with the observed bell-shaped dose-response function most probably indicative of varying affinities and intrinsic activities at NMDA receptor subtypes. The contrasting and comparatively limited effects of DCS in test-experienced mice suggest that prior maze exposure radically alters the extent to which NMDA receptor-related mechanisms are involved in future behavioural responses to this test environment.", 
    "40": "As an extension of the early intervention in psychosis paradigm, different focused treatments are now offered to individuals at ultra high risk of psychosis (UHR) to prevent transition to schizophrenia, however the effectiveness of these treatments is unclear. A systematic literature search in PubMed/Medline and PsycINFO was performed to derive information on randomized control trials (RCTs) in UHR samples. Seven reports were identified detailing results from five independent RCT studies. Two studies used antipsychotic drugs (one in combination with cognitive behavior therapy); one study employed cognitive therapy; one study used a two-year program of intensive community care with family psychoeducation; one study assessed the effectiveness of 3-months omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Omega-3 PUFAs) supplementation. Intensive community care and the Omega-3 PUFAs supplementation were effective in reducing the transition to psychosis at 12 months. Overall, rates of transition to psychosis at 1 year were 11% for focused treatment groups (n=180) and 31.6% for control UHR groups (n=157). Receiving any of the focused treatment was associated with a lower risk of developing psychosis if compared with no treatment or treatment as usual (Relative Risk=0.36; 95%CI: 0.22-0.59). The available evidence at 2/3 years follow-up indicates that the effects of focused treatments are not stable after intervention cessation and when treatment is delivered over a restricted time (e.g. 6 months or less), it may achieve only a delay in psychosis onset. Due to the heterogeneity in the interventions considered, the current results do not allow recommendation for any specific treatment.",

Furthermore, laboratory studies have provided evidence that age and inciting stimulus interact to determine the neuronal circuits activated during SE (ie, functional anatomy) and that differences in functional anatomy can partially account for variations in SE outcome. Future laboratory studies are likely to provide an additional understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie SE and its consequences.

In the present study, we first determined the efficacy and binding affinity of the benzodiazepine diazepam and recently synthesized GABA(A) receptor modulators JY-XHe-053, XHe-II-053, HZ-166, SH-053-2'F-S-CH\u2083 and SH-053-2'F-R-CH\u2083 at GABA(A) receptors containing \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13 and \u03b15 subunits. Results from these studies suggest that each compound displayed lower efficacy at GABA(A) receptors containing \u03b11 subunits and varying degrees of efficacy and affinity at GABA(A) receptors containing \u03b12, \u03b13 and \u03b15 subunits. Next, we assessed their anxiolytic effects using a rhesus monkey conflict procedure in which behavior was maintained under a fixed-ratio schedule of food delivery in the absence (non-suppressed responding) and presence (suppressed responding) of response-contingent electric shock. Relatively non-selective compounds, such as diazepam and JY-XHe-053 produced characteristic increases in rates of suppressed responding at low to intermediate doses and decreased the average rates of non-suppressed responding at higher doses. XHe-II-053 and HZ-166 also produced increases in suppressed responding at low to intermediate doses, but were ineffective at decreasing rates of non-suppressed responding, consistent with their relatively low efficacy at GABA(A) receptors containing \u03b11 and \u03b15 subunits. In contrast, SH-053-2'F-S-CH\u2083 and SH-053-2'F-R-CH\u2083 produced only partial increases in suppressed responding and were ineffective on non-suppressed responding, consistent with their profiles as partial agonists at GABA(A) receptors containing \u03b12, \u03b13 and \u03b15 subunits. These behavioral effects suggest that the anxiolytic and rate-reducing effects of GABA(A) receptor positive modulators are dependent on their relative efficacy and affinity at different GABA(A) receptor subtypes.",

We report the cerebral blood flow changes in an obsessive-convulsive patient with severe hoarding. The patient showed hyperperfusion of the fronto-temporal region and hypoperfusion of the striatal, the middle cingulate and the medial temporal regions during the stage with severe symptoms. Following improvement from the hoarding behaviors, the extent of hypoperfusion was expanded in the bilateral striatum, the anterior and middle cingulate gyrus.

This study examined the effects of two anxiolytics (buspirone and diazepam) and two anxiogenics (caffeine and FG142) on male and female gerbil behaviour in the black-white box (BWB). Diazepam was anxiolytic in males but not females. The anxiolytic effects of buspirone were apparent at the lower doses in both males and females. Higher doses resulted in sedative effects in both sexes. Caffeine produced mild anxiogenesis in females at the lowest dose, and in males at the highest dose. FG7142 was mildly anxiogenic in males and not at all in females. Findings are discussed in light of previous research.

Anesthesia depth indicators were observed. There was a significant difference between the MM-0.5 and the MM-1 groups regarding induction time, 8.1 +/- 2.1 min and 5.0 +/- 1.7 min, respectively. The MK induction time was 6.9 +/- 2.5 min, which was not significantly different from the other two groups. All combinations provided effective immobilization for at least 20-25 min. During immobilization, there were significant differences regarding rectal temperature, which was higher in the MK group; and blood pressure, which was higher in the MM-1 group.

    "70": "Schizophrenia (SCZ) is among the most disabling of mental disorders. Several neurobiological hypotheses have been postulated as responsible for SCZ pathogenesis: polygenic/multifactorial genomic defects, intrauterine and perinatal environment-genome interactions, neurodevelopmental defects, dopaminergic, cholinergic, serotonergic, gamma-aminobutiric acid (GABAergic), neuropeptidergic and glutamatergic/N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) dysfunctions, seasonal infection, neuroimmune dysfunction, and epigenetic dysregulation. SCZ has a heritability estimated at 60-90%. Genetic studies in SCZ have revealed the presence of chromosome anomalies, copy number variants, multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms of susceptibility distributed across the human genome, aberrant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in microRNA genes, mitochondrial DNA mutations, and epigenetic phenomena. Pharmacogenetic studies of psychotropic drug response have focused on determining the relationship between variation in specific candidate genes and the positive and adverse effects of drug treatment. Approximately, 18% of neuroleptics are major substrates of CYP1A2 enzymes, 40% of CYP2D6, and 23% of CYP3A4; 24% of antidepressants are major substrates of CYP1A2 enzymes, 5% of CYP2B6, 38% of CYP2C19, 85% of CYP2D6, and 38% of CYP3A4; 7% of benzodiazepines are major substrates of CYP2C19 enzymes, 20% of CYP2D6, and 95% of CYP3A4. About 10-20% of Western populations are defective in genes of the CYP superfamily. Only 26% of Southern Europeans are pure extensive metabolizers for the trigenic cluster integrated by the CYP2D6+CYP2C19+CYP2C9 genes. The pharmacogenomic response of SCZ patients to conventional psychotropic drugs also depends on genetic variants associated with SCZ-related genes. Consequently, the incorporation of pharmacogenomic procedures both to drugs in development and drugs on the market would help to optimize therapeutics in SCZ and other central nervous system (CNS) disorders.",

Using a systematic in vitro-in vivo approach, a cranberry juice product was identified recently that elicited a pharmacokinetic interaction with the CYP3A probe substrate midazolam in 16 healthy volunteers. Relative to water, cranberry juice inhibited intestinal first-pass midazolam metabolism. In vitro studies were initiated to identify potential enteric CYP3A inhibitors from cranberry via a bioactivity-directed fractionation approach involving dried whole cranberry [Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait. (Ericaceae)], midazolam, and human intestinal microsomes (HIM). Three triterpenes (maslinic acid, corosolic acid, and ursolic acid) were isolated.

However, the precise role played by Notch in this cancer remains to be studied extensively. Here, we show that Notch activation by the Jagged1 ligand enhances the proliferation of neuroblastoma cells, and we propose the possible use of Notch-blocking \u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) in neuroblastoma therapy. Two different GSIs, Compound E and DAPT, were tested alone or in combination with 13-cis retinoic acid (RA) on neuroblastoma cell lines. SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cells were chosen as paradigms of lower and higher malignancy, respectively. Used alone, GSIs induced complete cell growth arrest, promoted neuronal differentiation, and significantly reduced cell motility. The combination of GSIs and 13-cis RA resulted in the enhanced growth inhibition, differentiation, and migration of neuroblastoma cells. In summary, our data suggest that a combination of GSIs with 13-cis RA offers a therapeutic advantage over a single agent, indicating a potential novel therapy for neuroblastoma.",

In this study, we examined the glucuronidation of hydroxymidazolam in human liver microsomes (HLMs) and characterized the UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) involved in 1'- and 4-hydroxymidazolam glucuronidation. Among the 12 UGT isoforms tested, the O- and N-glucuronidation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam was mediated by UGT2B4/2B7 and 1A4, respectively. In contrast, the glucuronidation of 4-hydroxymidazolam was mediated by UGT1A4. Consistent with these observations, the UGT1A4 inhibitor hecogenin and the UGT2B7 substrate diclofenac potently inhibited the N- and O-glucuronidation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam in HLMs, respectively. A correlation analysis of UGT enzymatic activity and the formation rate of glucuronide metabolites from 1'- and 4-hydroxymidazolam in 25 HLMs showed that hydroxymidazolam glucuronidation is correlated with UGT1A4-mediated lamotrigine glucuronidation and UGT2B7-mediated diclofenac glucuronidation activity. Taken together, these findings indicate that UGT1A4, 2B4, and 2B7 are major isoforms responsible for glucuronide conjugate formation from 1'- and 4-hydroxymidazolam, which are the two major oxidative metabolites of midazolam.",

Moreover, the association of midazolam and a very small dosage of propofol, given their synergic action, is effective and safe in inducing anaesthesia. Arrhythmic complications are rare and limited to bradyarrhythmias.", 
    "92": "Our earlier studies have demonstrated that the non-selective group III mGlu receptor agonist, ACPT-I, produced anxiolytic rather than antidepressant-like actions after its peripheral administration. Here, we describe the effects of LSP1-2111 ((2S)-2-amino-4-[hydroxy[hydroxy(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-5-nitro-phenyl)methyl]phosphoryl]butanoic acid), a novel orthosteric, preferential agonist of the mGlu4 receptor, a member of the group III mGlu receptors family, in the stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH) and elevated plus-maze (EPM) tests in mice. In both tests an anxiolytic-like effect was clearly seen in doses of 2 and 5\u00a0mg/kg, i.p. The compound did not produce antidepressant-like effects in the tail suspension test (TST) or in the forced swim test (FST) in mice. The potential anxiolytic effect of LSP1-2111 (5\u00a0mg/kg) in the SIH test was inhibited by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (given i.p., 10\u00a0mg/kg), and by a 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist N-{2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl}-N-(2-pyridynyl)cyclohexane-carboxamide (WAY100635) (0.1\u00a0mg/kg, s.c.). At the same time, ritanserin (0.5\u00a0mg/kg i.p.), the 5-HT(2A/C) receptor antagonist, did not change the anxiolytic-like effects of LSP1-2111. Moreover, the compound was not effective in 5-HT depleted animals. The results of these studies indicate that the GABAergic and serotonergic systems are involved in the potential anxiolytic action of LSP1-2111.", 
    "93": "We tested here the hypothesis that the pharmacological modulation of the mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (mNCX) could be a new neuroprotective strategy to rescue stressed vulnerable neurons from death. We used rat hippocampal slices incubated with veratridine to cause neuronal death through a mechanism involving Na(+) and Ca(2+) overload. CGP37157 (CGP), an inhibitor of the mNCX, rescued veratridine vulnerable neurons from death, showing an EC(50) of 5 \u03bcM. This neuroprotection was associated to mitigation of veratridine-elicited overproduction of free radicals and to inhibition of the p38 MAPK-linked apoptotic pathway. These results suggest that the mNCX could become a new target to develop compounds with potential therapeutic neuroprotective actions in neurodegenerative diseases.", 
    "94": "A 22-month-old male neutered Coton De Tulear dog was presented for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy under general anesthesia. The anesthetic plan included premedication with intramuscular meperidine (4 mg kg(-1)) but meperidine was inadvertently administered at ten-fold this dose. Within 5 minutes, the dog was unresponsive to external stimulation, and by 10 minutes post-injection developed generalized signs of central nervous system (CNS) excitement. Initial therapy included inspired oxygen supplementation, and single intravenous (IV) doses of diazepam (0.68 mg kg(-1)) and naloxone (0.03 mg kg(-1)) to no effect. A second dose of diazepam (0.46 mg kg(-1), IV) abolished most of the signs of CNS excitement. General anesthesia was induced and the endoscopy performed. Time to extubation was initially prolonged, but administering naloxone (final dose 0.1 mg kg(-1), IV) to effect enabled extubation. After naloxone, the dog became agitated, noise sensitive, and had leg and trunk muscle twitches. Diazepam (0.30 mg kg(-1), IV) abolished these signs and the dog became heavily sedated and laterally recumbent. Naloxone administration was continued as a constant rate infusion (0.02 mg kg(-1) hour(-1), IV) until approximately 280 minutes post-meperidine injection, at which time the dog suddenly sat up. Occasional twitches of the leg and trunk muscles were observed during the night. The dog was discharged the next day appearing clinically normal.",

Demographic data and patient questionnaire responses were reported as means and standard errors or percents and were analyzed with the t test and chi-square test. Twenty-two patients were enrolled. Hemodynamics were statistically different between the two groups at several time points. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP) were elevated in the standard therapy group, whereas the dexmedetomidine group had a lower BP.

Analyses were carried out to assess the association of treatment outcome with baseline BZD use, with ongoing BZD use and with different patterns of BZD prescription. Baseline BZD use correlated with lower retention rates but not with poorer outcome. Ongoing BZD use correlated with poorer outcomes. Significantly better outcomes were found in the course of phobic anxiety symptomatology for those with regular prescription of BZD. The percentage of BZD positive urine tests decreased more in HAT than in MMT. Poorer outcome for benzodiazepine users may be mediated by a higher severity of addiction.

We describe the case of an infant affected by a tracheal agenesis who underwent a series of operative and diagnostic bronchoscopies for which she received midazolam and fentanyl. After 61 procedures the infant showed a somatosensory response which in our interpretation reflected a placebo effect. Ontogenetic considerations and specific observations indicate that the infant had the appropriate competences in her learning and memory systems and nociceptive and antinociceptive circuits for the placebo effect to take place. Generalizing, the introduction of placebo manipulation in infant pain management may be taken into consideration; its approach through observational and experimental studies is the preliminary target.",

The bax:bcl-2 ratio was increased as a consequence of down-regulation of bcl-2 and up-regulation of bax proteins in response to treatment with PBTDs. In addition, PBTDs were able to induce cell death in primary leukemia cells derived from 23 CML-chemoresistant patients. Furthermore, the effects of PBTDs on the Akt-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway were determined by Western blot. PBTDs possessed inhibitory activity against mTOR and also impeded hyper-phosphorylation of Akt as a feedback of inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin. The results presented in this study demonstrate that we have identified the PBTDs as restoring the apoptotic pathways both in primary leukemia cells derived from CML patients at onset and in primary leukemia cells derived from CML-chemoresistant patients, thus showing their ability to undergo apoptosis. These compounds constitute a promising therapeutic approach for patients with leukemia.

The present study aimed to identify key physicochemical properties influencing the interaction of a series of PBDs (four dimers and 12 monomers) with the three major human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (P-gp, ABCG2, and MRP1). Isogenic cell lines expressing P-gp and ABCG2, cell lines with acquired resistance to cytotoxic agents due to the high expression of ABC transporters, and specific inhibitors against P-gp, ABCG2, and MRP1 were used. P-gp and ABCG2 decreased the permeability of the PBD dimers across cell membranes and their interaction with DNA, reducing DNA damage and the overall cytotoxic effect. PBD monomer SG-2823 formed a conjugate with glutathione and interacted with MRP1, reducing its cytotoxic effect in A549 cells. Structure-activity relationship revealed that the interaction of PBDs with the transporters could be predicted considering the molecular weight, the lipophilicity, the number of (N\u2009+\u2009O) atoms and aromatic rings, the polar surface area, the hydrogen bonding energy, and electrophilic centers.

In many of these cases, catatonia cannot be accounted for by an associated psychotic, affective, or medical disorder. These findings are imminently relevant for classification where catatonia is currently restricted to sections of the psychotic, affective, or medical disorders.

The study group received standardized medical management for severe TBI including opiates, benzodiazepines, elevation of the head of bed, avoidance of hypotension and hypercapnia and hyperosmolar therapy (HOsmRx). In addition, 31 of 55 patients (56%) underwent placement of intraventricular catheters for cerebrospinal fluid drainage. If routine medical management and cerebrospinal fluid diversion failed to control ICP, then the patient was determined to have refractory intracranial hypertension (RICH) and PBC treatment was initiated. PBC was performed with pentobarbital infusion with continuous electroencephalogram monitoring to ensure adequate burst suppression. The measurements include serum sodium (Na) and osmolality (Osm) were assessed as indicators for initiation of PBC and to estimate the 50% mortality cut-points when controlling for ICP.

Of these, 13 (68%) were normal or functionally independent (Glasgow Outcome Scale score 4 or 5). Serum Na and Osm were associated with death (p < 0.05) when controlling for ICP. The 50% mortality cut-points were Na of 160 mEq/L and Osm of 330 mOsm/kg H2O.

Secondarily, the ability of these agents to facilitate intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) was assessed to ensure that any attenuation of CMS-induced anhedonia was not associated with an overt hedonic profile. After 2 weeks of CMS, male Wistar rats were administered asenapine (0.06-0.6 mg/kg), olanzapine (2 mg/kg), risperidone (0.5 mg/kg), or imipramine (10 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection over 5 weeks to examine their ability to reverse CMS-induced reductions in the intake of a sucrose solution. For the ICSS study, rats were trained to deliver an electrical stimulus to the ventral tegmental area. The effects of acute doses of subcutaneous asenapine (0.01-0.3 mg/kg), olanzapine (0.3 and 1 mg/kg), risperidone (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg), and intraperitoneal imipramine (3-30 mg/kg), cocaine (5.0 mg/kg), or amphetamine (1.0 mg/kg) on ICSS were then examined. CMS significantly reduced sucrose intake (P\u2009<\u20090.001). All active agents (0.6 mg/kg asenapine, 2 mg/kg olanzapine, 0.5 mg/kg risperidone, and 10 mg/kg imipramine) reversed the effect of CMS (all P\u2009<\u20090.001). In the ICSS protocol, asenapine (0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg), olanzapine (1 mg/kg), and risperidone (0.3 mg/kg) impaired ICSS performance, whereas positive controls (5 mg/kg cocaine, 1 mg/kg amphetamine) facilitated ICSS. Asenapine reversed CMS-induced anhedonia without facilitating ICSS, providing support for a role of asenapine in treating bipolar disorder and aspects of negative and/or affective symptoms in schizophrenia.", 
    "154": "GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) have long been a focus as targets for alcohol actions. Recent work suggests that tonic GABAergic inhibition mediated by extrasynaptic \u03b4 subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs is uniquely sensitive to ethanol and enhanced at concentrations relevant for human alcohol consumption. Ethanol enhancement of recombinant \u03b14\u03b23\u03b4 receptors is blocked by the behavioral alcohol antagonist 8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (Ro15-4513), suggesting that EtOH/Ro15-4513-sensitive receptors mediate important behavioral alcohol actions. Here we confirm alcohol/alcohol antagonist sensitivity of \u03b14\u03b23\u03b4 receptors using human clones expressed in a human cell line and test the hypothesis that discrepant findings concerning the high alcohol sensitivity of these receptors are due to difficulties incorporating \u03b4 subunits into functional receptors. To track \u03b4 subunit incorporation, we used a functional tag, a single amino acid change (H68A) in a benzodiazepine binding residue in which a histidine in the \u03b4 subunit is replaced by an alanine residue found at the homologous position in \u03b3 subunits. We demonstrate that the \u03b4H68A substitution confers diazepam sensitivity to otherwise diazepam-insensitive \u03b14\u03b23\u03b4 receptors. The extent of enhancement of \u03b14\u03b23\u03b4H68A receptors by 1 \u03bcM diazepam, 30 mM EtOH, and 1 \u03bcM \u03b2-carboline-3-carboxy ethyl ester (but not 1 \u03bcM Zn(2+) block) is correlated in individual recordings, suggesting that \u03b4 subunit incorporation into recombinant GABA(A)Rs varies from cell to cell and that this variation accounts for the variable pharmacological profile. These data are consistent with the notion that \u03b4 subunit-incorporation is often incomplete in recombinant systems yet is necessary for high ethanol sensitivity, one of the features of native \u03b4 subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs.", 
    "155": "Clobazam is a 1,5 benzodiazepine available in France since 1975, used in add-on with the other anticonvulsant drugs in the treatment of refractory epilepsies of child and adult and for the treatment of anxiety of adult. It is mainly metabolized in desmethylclobazam, or norclobazam, active metabolite, present in a concentration approximately eight times superior to that of the parent drug, but with an activity of the order of 20 to 40% of that of clobazam. Elimination half-life of clobazam is of 18 h while that of norclobazam is from 40 to 50 h. There is a large interindividual variability in the plasma concentrations. Furthermore, clobazam being prescribed in add-on with the other anticonvulsant drugs in resistant epilepsies, concentration-effect relationship is difficult to bring to light, since, in many studies, the patients who did not answer received the highest doses. Adverse reactions are moderated, appearing more often for the highest concentrations; also the phenomenon of tolerance seems more frequent in high concentrations. However, because of the kinetic interactions, a dosage of clobazam and norclobazam can be useful in certain cases. There is no validated therapeutic range, but the usual concentrations are in the range of 100-300 microg/L for the parent drug and about ten times more for the metabolite. The level of proof of the interest of the Therapeutic Drug Monitoring for this molecule is estimated in: rather useless.", 
    "156": "Clonazepam is a 1-4 benzodiazepine mainly used to treat epilepsy and epileptiform convulsion state. Rapidly absorbed after oral administration, it is widely distributed in the organism and is extensively converted in metabolites, poorly or not active, eliminated mainly in urine (70%) and feces. Elimination half-life is long, around 40 h. In adult and child, several studies showed a concentration-effect relation. Meanwhile, a large inter-individual variability in the dose-concentration relation was observed. A 15-50 microg/L range of clonazepam blood concentrations appears to be retained as an acceptable target to control a majority of epileptic seizures. The Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) of clonazepam can be considered as possibly useful in case of association with CYP450 inducers or inhibitors, suspicion of poor observance, or toxicity signs.",

No significant differences could be found between different types of NSAIDs, but ibuprofen showed fewer short-term side effects when compared to other NSAIDs. There was a significant difference in favour of NSAIDs when compared to acetaminophen. PREVENTIVE MEDICATION: (44 trials). Overall, the use of antidepressants does not show to be more effective than placebo, and no significant differences between different types of antidepressants were found. Furthermore there is limited evidence concerning the negative effects of propranolol on depression in TTH patients, when compared to placebo or biofeedback. There is conflicting evidence about the effectiveness of benzodiazepines and vasodilator agents compared to placebo. There is no evidence concerning the effectiveness of muscle relaxants compared to placebo. BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY: (44 trials). Eight studies compared relaxation treatment with a waiting list or attention placebo control, and 11 studies compared EMG biofeedback with placebo and in both interventions we found inconsistent results. Most trials lack adequate power to show statistical significant differences, but frequently recovery/improvement rates did not reach clinical relevance. PHYSIOTHERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS: (12 trials).

    "163": "Recent GABA(A) receptor drug discovery efforts have culminated in the development of transgenic mice and subtype-selective pharmacological tools, enhancing our understanding of the major inhibitory neural system in the central nervous system. Notably, subtype-selective tools have demonstrated in both preclinical studies and, to some extent, in man that it is possible to develop drugs that share the clinical benefits of benzodiazepines (e.g., anxiolysis) while obviating some adverse effects of these clinically important drugs. Here, we highlight chronic pain as another therapeutic area in which subtype-selective GABA(A) receptor drugs might have clinical utility. Specifically, based on research in animal models of inflammatory/neuropathic pain, we suggest that subtype-selective positive modulators of GABA(A) alpha(2/3) receptors might reverse a loss of postsynaptic GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory function in spinal cord, leading to analgesia. However, alteration of presynaptic inhibitory neural transmission in chronic pain suggests that drugs that negatively modulate GABA(A) receptors might also be effective analgesics. For example, the non-selective negative allosteric modulator FG-7142 reverses allodynia in an animal model of neuropathic pain. Importantly, these two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. Further clinical exploration in pain of available positive and negative subtype-selective modulators that have been administered to humans would considerably aid back translation, allowing for improved therapeutic development.",

However, a key aspect of the clinical development of such compounds is the demonstration that in man such compounds are devoid of the anxiogenic-like activity associated with non-selective inverse agonists such as FG 7142. The triazolophthalazine \u03b15IA (3-(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)-6-[(1-methyl-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyloxy]-1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-a]phthalazine) is an \u03b15-selective inverse agonist which enhances cognitive performance in rodents and encouragingly in human Phase I Safety and Tolerability studies it was devoid of the anxiogenic-like activity associated with FG 7142. However, in order to appropriately interpret this latter observation, it was considered important to demonstrate that the absence of anxiogenic-like activity occurs at significant levels of receptor occupancy. Consequently, the occupancy of human brain GABA(A) receptors was measured using [\u00b9\u00b9C]flumazenil positron emission tomography in three healthy normal young male volunteers following a single oral dose of 2 mg \u03b15IA. One hour after dosing, mean occupancy levels were 53% and this fell to 16% by 8 h post-dose, with the plasma \u03b15IA concentration corresponding to 50% occupancy being 10 ng/mL. These data clearly show that an \u03b15-selective inverse agonist is not associated with anxiogenic-like side effects at doses that give ~50% occupancy.", 
    "169": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is a major non-psychotomimetic component of Cannabis sativa that has been shown to have an anxiolytic effect in human and animal models. Earlier studies suggest that these effects involve facilitation of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that has also been related to obsessive-compulsive disorder. On the basis of this evidence, this study investigated the effects of CBD in C57BL/6J mice submitted to the marble-burying test (MBT), an animal model proposed to reflect compulsive behaviour. CBD (15, 30 and 60 mg/kg) induced a significant decrease in the number of buried marbles compared with controls (34, 41 and 48%, respectively). A similar, although larger, decrease was also found after the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor paroxetine (10 mg/kg, 77% decrease) and the benzodiazepine diazepam (2.5 mg/kg, 84% decrease). The effect of CBD (30 mg/kg) was still significant after 7 days of daily repeated administration, whereas the effect of diazepam disappeared. Pretreatment with WAY100635 (3 mg/kg), a 5HT1A receptor antagonist, prevented the effects of paroxetine but failed to alter those of CBD. These latter effects, however, were prevented by pretreatment with the CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 (1 mg/kg). These results indicated that CBD and paroxetine decrease the number of buried marbles in the MBT through distinct pharmacological mechanisms. They also suggest a potential role of drugs acting on the cannabinoid system in modulating compulsive behaviour.",

Secretagogues with different mechanisms of action target apical domains in enterocytes that are involved in chloride secretion, such as chloride channels, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, and guanylate cyclase C. As a class, such secretagogues have high efficacy and safety for constipation.

GABAergic dysfunction has been hypothesized to contribute to the occurrence of epilepsy and cognitive and behavioral impairments in this condition. In the present study, analysis of GABA(A) receptor subunit expression and pharmacology was performed in cerebral cortex from four subjects with Angelman syndrome and compared to that from control tissue. The membrane fraction of frozen postmortem neocortical tissue was isolated and subjected to quantitative Western blot analysis. The ratios of beta(3)/beta(2) and alpha(5)/alpha(1) subunit protein expression in Angelman syndrome cortex were significantly decreased when compared with controls. An additional membrane fraction was injected into Xenopus oocytes, resulting in incorporation of the brain membrane vesicles with their associated receptors into the oocyte cellular membrane. Two-electrode voltage-clamp analysis of GABA(A) receptor currents was then performed. Studies of GABA(A) receptor pharmacology in Angelman syndrome cortex revealed increased current enhancement by the alpha(1)-selective benzodiazepine-site agonist zolpidem and by the barbiturate phenobarbital, while sensitivity to current inhibition by zinc was decreased. GABA(A) receptor affinity and modulation by neurosteroids were unchanged. This shift in GABA(A) receptor subunit expression and pharmacology in Angelman syndrome is consistent with impaired extrasynaptic but intact to augmented synaptic cortical GABAergic inhibition, which could contribute to the epileptic, behavioral, and cognitive phenotypes of the disorder.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that GABA system in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) is involved in the pathogensis of anxiety-related disorders. The role of GABAergic system in the BLA was investigated in anxiety-like behavior evoked by prenatal EtOH exposure. The infusion of midazolam (MDZ), a positive modulator of GABA(A) receptor, into the BLA prevented anxiety-like behavior in EtOH-offspring without affecting the corresponding behavior of control offspring. The data suggest that anxiety-like behavior could be causally related to increased neuronal excitability attributable to depressed GABAergic inhibition in the BLA. To test this hypothesis, evoked potential was studied using brain slices from EtOH-offspring. Potential evoked in the BLA by single stimuli applied to external capsule showed multispike responses, indicative of GABAergic disinhibition. These multiple responses were no longer evident after the perfusion with MDZ. In the slices from EtOH-offspring, paired-pulse inhibition (GABA(A)-dependent) was suppressed. Also, in EtOH-offspring, long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced by a single train of high frequency stimulation, which did not induce LTP in control rats. Moreover, MDZ pretreatment prevented the facilitating effect of EtOH on LTP induction. The data provide the functional evidence that prenatal EtOH exposure attenuates GABAergic inhibition in the BLA resulting in neuronal hyperexcitability and anxiety-like behavior of adult rat offspring.",

A climate-controlled burial was also undertaken using defleshed bones to approximate an extended decomposition. Long bones (femora, tibiae) were isolated and separated into tissue type (diaphyseal bone, epiphyseal bone, and marrow), and according to treatment (i.e. buried or non-buried). Following methanolic extraction (bone) or simple homogenization (marrow), samples were analyzed with ELISA. Samples were then pooled according to treatment, extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE) and confirmed with GC-MS. Under the conditions examined, the effects of burial appear to be drug and tissue dependent. Ketamine-exposed tissues demonstrated the greatest differences, especially in bone marrow. In diazepam-exposed tissues, burial did not seem to greatly affect drug response and some gave greater assay response compared to the non-buried set. Overall, the data suggest that fresh tissue samples may not be representative of decomposed samples in terms of skeletal tissue drug levels."
