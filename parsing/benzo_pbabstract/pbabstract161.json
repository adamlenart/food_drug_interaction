    "0": "Atypical antipsychotic drug therapy may result in substantial weight gain, increased adiposity and the promotion of metabolic abnormalities. The mechanism(s) which underlie such effects remain unclear. Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated significant weight gain in female rats maintained on a standard laboratory diet after sub-chronic administration of olanzapine and risperidone, but not ziprasidone. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of antipsychotic drugs on body weight, ingestive behaviour and adiposity in female rats with access to a high fat diet. Adult female rats given free access to a high fat diet received either olanzapine (2 mg/kg), risperidone (0.5 mg/kg), ziprasidone (2.5 mg/kg) or vehicle for 28 days. Body weight, food and water intake in addition to intra-abdominal fat deposition were assessed. Olanzapine initially increased body weight but by the end of the study olanzapine animals appeared to have lost weight compared to the vehicle-treated group. Olanzapine-induced reductions in body weight were accompanied by a significant hypophagia during weeks 3 and 4. Risperidone increased body weight during week 1 only and reduced intake of a high fat diet during weeks 3 and 4. Ziprasidone was without effect on indices of body weight and ingestive behaviour. There were no effects of antipsychotic drugs on intra-abdominal fat deposition. Access to a diet high in fat attenuated weight gain induced by olanzapine and risperidone in female rats.",

    "9": "Mossy fibers (axons arising from dentate granule cells) form large synaptic contacts exclusively onto the proximal apical dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons. They can generate large synaptic currents that occur in close proximity to the soma. These properties mean that active conductance in the proximal apical dendrite could have a disproportionate influence on CA3 pyramidal neuron excitability. Ni(2+)-sensitive T-type Ca(2+) channels are important modulators of dendritic excitability. Here, we use an optical approach to determine the contribution of Ni(2+) (100 microM)-sensitive Ca(2+) channels to action potential (AP) elicited Ca(2+) flux in the soma, proximal apical and distal apical dendrites. At resting membrane potentials Ni(2+)-sensitive Ca(2+) channels do not contribute to the Ca(2+) signal in the proximal apical dendrite, but do contribute in the other cell regions. Spontaneous release from mossy fiber terminals acting on 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX)-sensitive postsynaptic channels underlies a tonic inhibition of Ni(2+)-sensitive channels. Chelating Zn(2+) with CaEDTA blocks CNQX-sensitive changes in Ca(2+) flux implicating a mechanistic role of this ion in T-type Ca(2+) channel block. To test if this inhibition influenced excitability, progressively larger depolarizing pulses were delivered to CA3 pyramidal neurons. CNQX significantly reduced the size of the depolarizing step required to generate APs and increased the absolute number of APs per depolarizing step. This change in AP firing was completely reversed by the addition of Ni(2+). This mechanism may reduce the impact of T-type Ca(2+) channels in a region where large synaptic events are common.",

At the level of the whole heart, we subjected rabbit hearts to ischaemia/reperfusion in order to determine how 4-ClDzp influenced the susceptibility to arrhythmias and contractile dysfunction. In isolated rabbit cardiomyocytes, 4-ClDzp evoked a significant reduction in the cardiac action potential that was associated with a decrease in calcium currents and peak intracellular calcium transients. In intact perfused normoxic rabbit hearts, 4-ClDzp mediated a dose-dependent negative inotropic response, consistent with the observation that 4-ClDzp was reducing calcium influx. Hearts that underwent 30 min of global ischaemia and 30 min of reperfusion were protected against reperfusion arrhythmias and post-ischaemic contractile impairment when 4-ClDzp (24 microM) was administered throughout the protocol or as a single bolus dose given at the onset of reperfusion.

    "24": "Gaboxadol, a selective extra synaptic GABA(A) receptor agonist, has been in clinical development for the treatment of insomnia. Development of tolerance to therapeutic effects (e.g. hypnotic and anticonvulsant and sedative) and withdrawal symptoms (e.g. REM sleep rebound and reduced seizure threshold) upon treatment discontinuation is reported for GABA(A) receptor allosteric modulators acting via the benzodiazepine binding site, e.g. zolpidem and indiplon. We conducted a head to head comparison in rats of the hypnotic (sleep EEG after 21 daily doses and 24 and 48 h after the last dose) and seizure threshold modifying (bicuculline assay 24 h after 28 daily doses) effects of gaboxadol and benzodiazepine ligands. Furthermore, we investigated in further details a previously reported apparent rapid development of tolerance to gaboxadol's effects in a rat rotarod motor coordination assay and related this effect to CNS exposure levels and in vitro potency at extra synaptic GABA(A) receptors. Sleep EEG studies demonstrated lack of tolerance and withdrawal effects after 28 daily doses with gaboxadol, whereas zolpidem produced both tolerance and withdrawal effects under a similar dosing regimen. Daily dosing with gaboxadol, zolpidem or indiplon for 28 days and acute discontinuation of treatment left the threshold to bicuculline-induced seizures unchanged. The rapidly attenuated effect of repeated gaboxadol dosing was confirmed in the rotarod model. However, re-challenge of gaboxadol insensitive animals with gaboxadol produced a maximum response, ruling out that receptor desensitisation accounts for these effects. By comparing CNS exposure at rotarod responses and concentration response relation at cloned GABA(A) receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes it appears that the decline in response in the rotarod model coincides with the steep part of the concentration response curve for gaboxadol at extra synaptic GABA(A) receptors. In conclusion, rat sleep EEG repeated dose studies of gaboxadol confirm a hypnotic-like profile and no withdrawal effects, whereas tolerance and withdrawal effects were shown with zolpidem. Withdrawal from gaboxadol, zolpidem and indiplon did not affect the seizure threshold to bicuculline. Gaboxadol's apparent rapid development of tolerance in the rotarod assay appears to be kinetically determined.", 
    "25": "Even though significant progress has been made, chemotherapy-induced emesis remains a challenging problem. Few studies focus on emesis in patients treated with carboplatin and the observation period is limited to the initial 24 h following chemotherapy. Thus, we investigated if tropisetron (T) monotherapy can adequately prevent acute and delayed emesis in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) (carboplatin-containing) regimen. Furthermore, we explored the merits of adding dexamethasone (D) or alprazolam (A) to T, especially in the setting of a pre-existing high level of stress. We studied 60 patients with advanced NSCLC receiving carboplatin and taxanes in three consecutive cycles. During the first cycle, patients received 5 mg of T intravenously before chemotherapy and the same dose per os on each of the following 3 days. In the second cycle, T was co-administered with 8 mg of D once a day, while, during the third cycle, T was combined with per os A 0.25 mg every 12 h and continued over the following 3 days. Finally, we evaluated the impact of stress on the anti-emetic response achieved with the previously described regimens. The combination of T + A was superior to T monotherapy and the combination of T + D, regarding the prevention of acute and delayed emesis. Both T + A and T + D combinations led to appetite improvement, while patients receiving T + A experienced sedation more frequently. Interestingly, subgroup analysis revealed that patients without underlying stress obtained no further benefit by the addition of A or D, while both T + A and T + D combinations led to a better anti-emetic response in patients with stress. In conclusion, T monotherapy provides a satisfactory result in controlling nausea and emesis caused by a MEC regimen in patients without stress. However, the addition of D and, mainly, A improves its anti-emetic effect in patients with obvious stress.", 
    "26": "Tolerance, dependence, and adverse effects on cognitive functions are well known consequences of long-term use of benzodiazepines (BDZ), especially at high doses; this raises thorny therapeutic problems in their discontinuation. One promising pharmacological agent in BDZ discontinuation might be the newer antiepileptic, pregabalin (PGB), which has already successfully been tested in the treatment of anxiety disorders. We report on a series of four women with long-term, high-dose dependence on BDZ, who were treated with PGB at doses of 225-600 mg. All four patients discontinued BDZ successfully in 3-7 weeks. Moreover, they had an impressive reduction of their previous anxiety levels under BDZ. In addition, the patients showed a clinically significant amelioration in their cognitive functioning. The side effects of PGB were mild and transient, persisting only during the first 2 weeks of treatment. Although our findings are preliminary, they suggest that PGB might be one of the most promising of the newer agents in the treatment of BDZ dependence.",

A neurovirulent strain of the alphavirus Sindbis virus (NSV) causes fatal encephalomyelitis associated with motor neuron death in adult C57BL/6 mice that can be prevented by treatment with the prototypic noncompetitive alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptor antagonist GYKI 52466 [Nargi-Aizenman J, et al. (2004) Ann Neurol 55:541-549]. To determine the mechanism of protection, NSV-infected mice were treated with 7-acetyl-5-(4-aminophenyl)-8(R)-methyl-8,9-dihydro-7H-1,3-dioxolo-(4,5-h)-benzodiazepine (talampanel), a potent, orally available member of the 2,3 benzodiazepine class of noncompetitive AMPA glutamate receptor antagonists. Talampanel-treated mice were protected from NSV-induced paralysis and death. Examination of the brain during infection showed significantly less mononuclear cell infiltration and no increase in astrocyte expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein in treated mice compared with untreated mice. Lack of CNS inflammation was attributable to failure of treated mice to induce activation and proliferation of lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid tissue in response to infection. Antibody responses to NSV were also suppressed by talampanel treatment, and virus clearance was delayed. These studies reveal a previously unrecognized effect of AMPA receptor antagonists on the immune response and suggest that prevention of immune-mediated damage, in addition to inhibition of excitotoxicity, is a mechanism by which these drugs protect from death of motor neurons caused by viral infection.",

Moreover; olanzapine was found to potently inhibit recombinant GSK-3beta in vitro (IC(50) value=91.0 nM). Our findings strongly suggest that olanzapine has significant GSK-3beta inhibition activity that could justify some of its pharmacological effects and glucose metabolic disturbances.", 
    "61": "A combination of in vitro (competitive binding assays) and in vivo (tissues from animals exposed to dietary methyl mercury, MeHg) experimental procedures was employed to assess the effects of mercury (MeHg, HgCl(2)) on the two-key muscarinic cholinergic (mACh) receptor subtypes (M1, M2) in two brain regions (occipital cortex, brain stem) of captive mink (Mustela vison). In vitro, HgCl(2) and MeHg were equipotent in inhibiting [(3)H]-pirenzipine binding to the M1 receptor in the occipital cortex, but in the brain stem, MeHg was about 65x more potent than HgCl(2). For the M2 receptor, both HgCl(2) and MeHg were more potent at inhibiting [(3)H]-AFDX-384 binding in the occipital cortex than in the brain stem. Within each brain region, HgCl(2) was more potent at inhibiting [(3)H]-AFDX-384 binding than MeHg. In vivo exposure of captive mink to MeHg (0.5, 1, and 2ppm MeHg in the diet for 89 days) resulted in greater binding of radioligands to the M1 and M2 receptor in the occipital cortex, but not in the brain stem, when compared to control animals. Based on the in vitro results, we could not conclude which mACh receptor subtype or brain region was most sensitive to Hg, but the in vivo findings suggest that Hg preferentially affects mACh receptor subtype (M1 and M2) levels in the occipital cortex. By studying distinct mACh receptors, these results extend upon previous studies in laboratory rodents and wildlife that showed Hg to affect the global population of mACh receptors.", 
    "62": "Over the past several decades, benzodiazepines and the newer non-benzodiazepines have become the anxiolytic/hypnotics of choice over the more readily abused barbiturates. While all drugs from this class act at the GABA(A) receptor, benzodiazepine-type drugs offer the clear advantage of being safer and better tolerated. However, there is still potential for these drugs to be abused, and significant evidence exists to suggest that this is a growing problem. This review examines the behavioral determinants of the abuse and dependence liability of benzodiazepine-type drugs. Moreover, the pharmacological and putative biochemical basis of the abuse-related behavior is discussed.", 
    "63": "The exploration of the structure-affinity relationships concerning a new class of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligands related to alpidem has been pursued in order to evaluate the consistency of the structure-affinity relationships among different classes (and subclasses) of PBR ligands. The target amide derivatives were prepared following a previously published procedure based on the condensation of pyrrolo[3,4-b]quinoline derivatives 11a,b with glyoxylic acid mono-hydrate and the subsequent amidation of the acids obtained via mixed anhydride. On the other hand, the preparation of compound 9g lacking the pharmacophoric (delta1) carbonyl group involved: (a) the double sequential attack of the dimethylmethyleneammonium salt obtained from bis(dimethylamino)methane and acetyl chloride to pyrrolo[3,4-b]quinoline derivative 11b, (b) the quaternization of the obtained allylamine derivative 13 with methyl iodide, and (c) the palladium-catalyzed allylation of N-methyl-p-anisidine by quaternary allylammonium cation 14. The structure-affinity relationship trends observed in this subclass of tricyclic alpidem-related PBR ligands find correlations in other classes (or subclasses) of PBR ligands. This result supports the initial pharmacophoric hypothesis and suggests a common mode of interaction at the PBR binding site.",

We describe a 58-year-old man with Down syndrome and dementia who was receiving low-dose olanzapine and rivastigmine therapy; he developed NMS 4 months after starting olanzapine. The patient presented with altered mental status, rigidity, fever, diaphoresis, and tremor, and his creatine kinase level was elevated. Olanzapine was discontinued, and the patient fully recovered; antipsychotic therapy was not restarted. Based on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, olanzapine was the probable cause of the patient's NMS. In addition, use of rivastigmine in combination with olanzapine may have placed the patient at greater risk for NMS, possibly due to an acetylcholine-dopamine imbalance. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for NMS even with low doses of antipsychotics, particularly in patients who have a limited ability to communicate. Concomitant administration of cholinesterase inhibitors such as rivastigmine may represent an unrecognized risk factor for NMS development.",

    "84": "Prior to an operation, patients experience a high degree of stress and internal tension. Preoperative drug administration (premedication) is intended to reduce these stresses through anxiolytic and sedative effects. On account of their good anxiolytic actions, there excellent tolerability and only few side effects benzodiazepines are most frequently used for this purpose. To support the induction and continuation of sleep, premedication is usually initiated in the evening before operation with the administration of a benzodiazepine with middle- or long-term activity. The standard drug for the day of operation is the short-acting benzodiazepine midazolam, under the action of which the patient may be transferred to the operation room in a drowsy and calm state. The onset of action of drugs applied as preoperative medication is delayed. Thus, it is of major importance that the premedication be administered at the appropriate time point so that the patient really is shielded fro preoperative stress at the time of the drug's optimal effect. Although midazolam is not the ideal substance for all situations where an anxiolytic premedication is needed, with the exception of a few special indications, no decisive advantages over other drugs have been demonstrated in comparative trials.",

    "89": "Surgery is the primary and most effective treatment of breast cancer, but minimal residual disease is probably unavoidable. Whether residual disease results in clinical metastases depends on numerous factors, including anti-tumor cell mediated immunity and angiogenic and growth signals in sites of residual disease. At least three perioperative factors adversely affect these: 1) the neuroendocrine stress response to surgery, 2) volatile anesthetics, and 3) opioids. Animal studies indicate that regional anesthesia and optimum postoperative analgesia independently reduce the metastatic burden in animals inoculated with breast adenocarcinoma cells following surgery. Retrospective studies in humans also suggest that regional analgesia may reduce recurrence risk after cancer surgery. We will test the hypothesis that local or metastatic recurrence after breast cancer surgery is lower in patients randomized to paravertebral or high-thoracic epidural analgesia combined with sedation or light anesthesia than in patients given intraoperative volatile anesthesia and postoperative opioid analgesia. In a Phase III, multi-center trial, Stage 1-3 patients having mastectomies for cancer will be randomly assigned to thoracic epidural or paravertebral anesthesia/analgesia, or to sevoflurane anesthesia and morphine analgesia. The primary outcome will be cancer recurrence. Enrolling 1100 patients over 5 years will provide 85% power for detecting a 30% treatment effect at an alpha of 0.05. We plan four equally spaced interim analyses, each evaluating efficacy and futility. Confirming our hypothesis will indicate that a small modification to anesthetic management, one that can be implemented with little risk or cost, will reduce the risk of cancer recurrence - a complication that is often ultimately lethal.",

Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were neonatalally treated with quinpirole (1 mg/kg) from postnatal days (P) 1-21 and raised to adulthood. Beginning on P62, rats were administered the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine (2.5 mg/kg) twice daily for 28 days. Starting 1 day after the end of olanzapine treatment, animals were behaviorally tested on the place and match-to-place version of the Morris water maze (MWM) over seven consecutive days, and a yawning behavioral test was also performed to test for sensitivity of the D(2) receptor 1 day following MWM testing. Similar to results from a past study, olanzapine alleviated cognitive impairment on the MWM place version and increases in yawning produced by neonatal quinpirole treatment. Brain tissue analyses showed that neonatal quinpirole treatment resulted in a significant decrease of hipppocampal ChAT and BDNF RNA expression that were unaffected by adulthood olanzapine treatment, although adulthood olanzapine treatment produced a significant increase in cerebellar ChAT RNA expression. There were no significant effects of drug treatment on NGF RNA expression in any brain area. These results show that neonatal quinpirole treatment produced significant decreases of protein RNA expression that is specific to the hippocampus. Although olanzapine alleviated cognitive deficits produced by neonatal quinpirole treatment, it did not affect expression of proteins known to be important in cognitive performance.",

The CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and CXC-chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) have been identified as the major HIV co-receptors and therefore are promising targets for the development of new anti-HIV drugs. CXCR4 is also involved in several diseases such as angiogenesis, metabolic and neurological disorders, rheumatoid arthritis and in different forms of metastatic cancer. Herein, we present a review focusing on small molecule CXCR4 antagonists.

The most advanced CXCR4 antagonists documented are bicyclam derivatives, which are specific CXCR4 antagonists and exhibit potency in the nanomolar range. Further development of selective CXCR4 antagonists continues to be crucial for the design of second generation of anti-HIV drugs. We aim to provide a comprehensive summary of diverse structural templates that could be useful for optimization and discovery of novel CXCR4 antagonists.",

TMD were diagnosed by Research Diagnostic Criteria for temporomandibular disorders proposed by Dworkin and LeResche. The surface electromyography was recorded from left and right masseter muscles and masseter inhibitory reflex (masseter silent period) was recorded after mechanical stimulation. The incidence of TMD appearance was very similar, of approximately 40% in both group of patients. The results of the study also indicated a higher prevalence of joint related TMD, a lower prevalence of muscular subtype of TMD and a lower grade of chronic pain and related disability in the psychiatric group of patients on antidepressive therapy in comparison with findings in the control group. In the patients on antidepressive therapy with TMD masseter silent period was not prolonged , while in the control group of patients with TMD the prolongation of the silent period was observed.

    "109": "Serotonin in the lateral septum (LS) has been implicated in the modulation of defensive behaviors and in anxiety. However, it is currently unknown whether changes in 5-HT mechanisms in this brain area may selectively affect defensive responses associated with specific subtypes of anxiety disorders recognized in clinical settings. To address this question, we evaluated the effect of the intra-LS injection of the 5-HT(1A/7) receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (0.6, 3.0, 15.0 nmol) in male Wistar rats exposed to the elevated T-maze animal model of anxiety. This test allows the measurement of two behavioral defensive responses in the same rat: inhibitory avoidance and escape behavior. In clinical terms, these responses have been respectively related to generalized anxiety and panic disorder. The effects of 8-OH-DPAT were compared to those caused by a standard anxiolytic compound, the benzodiazepine receptor agonist midazolam (MDZ, 20 nmol). We also investigated whether the intra-LS injection of the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY-100635 (0.37 nmol) was able to block the effects of 8-OH-DPAT. All animals were also tested in an open field for locomotor activity assessments. Results showed that whereas intra-LS administration of MDZ decreased avoidance latencies, suggesting an anxiolytic action, 8-OH-DPAT caused the opposite effect. Neither drug affected the escape performance. Intra-LS administration of WAY-100635 blocked the anxiogenic effect caused by 8-OH-DPAT. No changes to locomotion were detected in the open field. The data suggests that LS 5-HT(1A) receptors are involved in the control of inhibitory avoidance behavior and that a failure in this regulatory mechanism may be of importance to the physiopathology of generalized anxiety disorder.",

Post-traumatic stress disorder has recently attracted public attention because of the impact of international terrorism, although the vast majority of post-traumatic stress disorder cases actually relate to civilian events such as car accidents, rape and violent robbery. This disorder requires deeper understanding and consensus among professionals.", 
    "117": "Advances have been made in elucidating the neurobiology of this disorder, partly by using an animal model of post-traumatic stress disorder. Recent studies have focused on memory processes and the therapeutic role played by plasticity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and how this fits (or does not fit) in with the current therapeutic interventions. Guidelines have been established by various bodies in an attempt to streamline treatment options.", 
    "118": "Understanding of post-traumatic stress disorder is incomplete. Future research should attempt to determine what treatments given during the 'window of opportunity' - the time from exposure until post-traumatic stress disorder develops - are effective. Care should be taken not to interfere with spontaneous recovery.", 
    "119": "Several studies and reports suggest an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients treated with conventional antipsychotic drugs, as well as with clozapine. We report the case of a 25-year-old man with early-onset schizo-affective disorder, with no identified risk factor for thromboembolism, who developed pulmonary embolism on three occasions, once shortly after initiating treatment with olanzapine and twice with risperidone. This case indicates that VTE can be associated with the use of olanzapine and risperidone, two atypical agents having similar properties and the same 5HT2 receptors antagonism, possibly implicated in this adverse event. As suggested by this observation, patients who have had one episode of VTE with antipsychotics with an affinity for 5HT2 receptors should receive neuroleptics from other classes, such as amisulpride, which does not interact with 5HT2 receptors. They should also be closely monitored to ensure early detection and prompt treatment of VTE.", 
    "120": "It has been demonstrated that, on abrupt withdrawal, patients with chronic exposure can experience a number of symptoms indicative of a dependent state. In clinical patients, the earliest to arise and most persistent signal of withdrawal from chronic benzodiazepine (Bzp) treatment is anxiety. In laboratory animals, anxiety-like effects following abrupt interruption of chronic Bzp treatment can also be reproduced. In fact, signs that oscillate from irritability to extreme fear behaviours and seizures have been described already. As anxiety remains one of the most important symptoms of Bzp withdrawal, in this study we evaluated the anxiety levels of rats withdrawn from diazepam. Also studied were the effects on the motor performance and preattentive sensory gating process of rats under diazepam chronic treatment and upon 48-h withdrawal on three animal models of anxiety, the elevated plus-maze (EPM), ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) and startle+prepulse inhibition tests. Data obtained showed an anxiolytic- and anxiogenic-like profile of the chronic intake of and withdrawal from diazepam regimen in the EPM test, 22-KHz USV and startle reflex. Diazepam chronic effects or its withdrawal were ineffective in promoting any alteration in the prepulse inhibition (PPI). However, an increase of PPI was achieved in both sucrose and diazepam pretreated rats on 48-h withdrawal, suggesting a procedural rather than a specific effect of withdrawal on sensory gating processes. It is also possible that the prepulse can function as a conditioned stimulus to informing the delivery of an aversive event, as the auditory startling-eliciting stimulus. All these findings are indicative of a sensitization of the neural substrates of aversion in diazepam-withdrawn animals without concomitant changes on the processing of sensory information.", 
    "121": "Prevalence of alcohol dependence remains stable across time between 5-7% in men and 2-3% in women, corresponding to at least 1.5 million patients in France. A review about alcohol dependence is warranted, not only as prevalence of this disease is high, but also because of recent significant improvement in caring for these patients.", 
    "122": "Management of alcohol withdrawal is well codified and chiefly entails the prescription of long half-life benzodiazepines, thiamin, and appropriate rehydratation. The objective is to prevent withdrawal syndrome, which can result in delirium tremens and seizures. Several drugs and therapies have proven efficacy to maintain abstinence. Cognitive behavioral therapies evaluate those factors triggering alcohol consumption, and involve behavioral techniques to promote a change. Motivational interviewing enhances individual effectiveness of treatment, and capacity to maintain abstinence. Three molecules used in France have proven efficacy through several mechanisms: acamprosate which interacts with GABAergic and glutamatergic central transmission; naltrexone, an antagonist of opiate receptors; disulfiram which has antabuse-like effect through inhibition of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase.", 
    "123": "Main research strategies currently developed are: (i) investigating consumption of multiple psychoactive substances, and (ii) understanding the neurobiology of dependence, which may lead to new therapeutic discoveries.", 
    "124": "The aim of the present pilot study was to investigate in a single-blind manner, over a period of 8 weeks, the comparative efficacy and tolerability of risperidone versus olanzapine addition in the treatment of OCD patients who did not show a >or=35% decrease in the YBOCS score after 16-week SRI treatment (defined as resistant). The study consisted of two different phases: a 16-week open-label prospective phase to ascertain resistance to SRI treatment and an 8-week single-blind addition phase for resistant subjects only. Ninety-six subjects with DSM-IV OCD (YBOCS>or=16) entered the open-label prospective phase; at the end of the 16-week period, 50 (52%) were judged to be resistant and were randomized to receive risperidone (1 to 3 mg/d) or olanzapine (2.5 to 10 mg/d) addition for 8 weeks. Overall, patients in both groups responded significantly, without differences between the two treatment groups; although no differences emerged for the proportion of patients reporting at least an adverse event, the profiles of adverse experiences differed significantly, being risperidone associated with amenorrhoea and olanzapine with weight gain.", 
    "125": "Noradrenergic and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neuronal systems within the brain have been implicated in stress and anxiety. Synaptic release of cerebral norepinephrine (NE) is increased during stress, and following intracerebral CRF administration. Benzodiazepines are commonly used anxiolytic drugs but information on their effects on the stress- and CRF-related release of NE is limited. We have used in vivo microdialysis to test the effects of the benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide (CDP) on the noradrenergic responses to footshock and intracerebroventricular CRF in the medial hypothalamus and the medial prefrontal cortex (PFM) of freely moving rats. Footshock (60 x 0.1-0.2 mA shocks in 20 min) significantly increased microdialysate concentrations of NE in the first sample collected after initiating the footshock. In the hypothalamus, microdialysate NE was augmented 64% above baseline. A second footshock session (100 min after the first footshock) increased microdialysate NE to 313% of the baseline. Thus the noradrenergic responses to footshock were enhanced by preceding footshocks. CRF (100 ng) administered into the locus coeruleus (LC) almost tripled microdialysate concentrations of NE in the PFM. CDP (5mg/kg, i.p.) had no statistically significant effects on the basal dialysate concentrations of NE, but it significantly attenuated both footshock- and CRF-induced increases in dialysate NE. CDP may exert a direct inhibitory effect on the noradrenergic neurons, alter the input to LC noradrenergic neurons, or alter the ability of CRF to activate the LC noradrenergic system.", 
    "126": "Sleep deprivation is considered as a risk factor for various diseases. Sleep deprivation leads to behavioral, hormonal, neurochemical and biochemical alterations in the animals. The present study was designed to explore the possible involvement of GABAergic mechanism in protective effect of alprazolam against 72h sleep deprivation-induced behavior alterations and oxidative damage in mice. In the present study, sleep deprivation caused anxiety-like behavior, weight loss, impaired ambulatory movements and oxidative damage as indicated by increase in lipid peroxidation, nitrite level and depletion of reduced glutathione and catalase activity in sleep-deprived mice brain. Treatment with alprazolam (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg, ip) significantly improved behavioral alterations. Biochemically, alprazolam treatment significantly restored depleted reduced glutathione, catalase activity, reversed raised lipid peroxidation and nitrite level. Combination of flumazenil (0.5 mg/kg) and picrotoxin (0.5 mg/kg) with lower dose of alprazolam (0.25mg/kg) significantly antagonized protective effect of alprazolam. However, combination of muscimol (0.05 mg/kg) with alprazolam (0.25 mg/kg, ip) potentiated protective effect of alprazolam. On the basis of these results, it might be suggested that alprazolam might produce protective effect by involving GABAergic system against sleep deprivation-induced behavior alterations and related oxidative damage.",

Here, we review the problems associated with the different drugs from a systems-based viewpoint. Apart from the respiratory depressant effect of opioids, crack cocaine is the most common cause of respiratory complications, mainly linked with its mode of use, with airway burns, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and lung syndromes being well-recognised sequelae. Because of its marked cardiovascular effects, cocaine is also a major cause of coronary syndromes and myocardial infarction. Amphetamines may produce similar effects less commonly. Hyperthermia may occur with cocaine toxicity or with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) due to exertion or from serotonin syndrome. Cerebral haemorrhage may result from the use of amphetamines or cocaine. Hallucinations may follow consumption of LSD, amphetamines, or cocaine. MDMA is a major cause of acute severe hyponatraemia and also has been linked with hepatic syndromes. Collapse, convulsions, or coma may be caused in different circumstances by opioids, MDMA, or gamma hydroxybutyrate and may be aggravated by other sedatives, especially alcohol and benzodiazepines. Recognition of these acute complications is urgent, and treatment must be based on an understanding of the likely underlying problem as well as on basic principles of supportive care.",

Patients with seizures attributable to infections were observed to have responded favorably to lidocaine when compared to those with seizures due to epilepsy (37.9% vs 6.8%; P < 0.05). Subsequent epilepsy was found to occur more frequently in patients with a poor response to lidocaine than in patients with a good response (P < 0.05).

    "150": "Acute agitation in the psychiatric emergency setting is a common presentation, which can endanger the patient, caregivers and professional staff. Rapid and effective treatment, followed by ongoing evaluation and maintenance treatment where appropriate, is key to circumvent negative outcomes. Nonpharmacological measures are the first step in treating the acutely agitated patient, and include verbal intervention and physical restraint. Pharmacological treatment is often required to ensure the safety of the patient, caregivers and the treatment team. The need for drug delivery in uncooperative patients favours the use of intramuscular preparations for the acutely agitated patient. Intramuscular treatment options include benzodiazepines, conventional antipsychotics and atypical antipsychotics. Each of these medications offers a unique pharmacological profile that must be considered when treating acutely agitated patients, who may be unwilling or unable to accurately communicate their co-morbid conditions and concomitant medications.", 
    "151": "Alcohol (ethanol, EtOH) has pleiotropic actions and induces a number of acute and long-term effects due to direct actions on alcohol targets, and effects of alcohol metabolites and metabolism. Many detrimental health consequences are due to EtOH metabolism and metabolites, in particular acetaldehyde, whose high reactivity leads to nonspecific chemical modifications of proteins and nucleic acids. Like acetaldehyde, alcohol has been widely considered a nonspecific drug, despite rather persuasive evidence implicating inhibitory GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) in acute alcohol actions, for example, a GABA(A)R ligand, the imidazobenzodiazepine Ro15-4513 antagonizes many low-to-moderate dose alcohol actions in mammals. It was therefore rather surprising that abundant types of synaptic GABA(A)Rs are generally not responsive to relevant low concentrations of EtOH. In contrast, delta-subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs and extrasynaptic tonic GABA currents mediated by these receptors are sensitive to alcohol concentrations that are reached in blood and tissues during low-to-moderate alcohol consumption. We recently showed that low-dose alcohol enhancement on highly alcohol-sensitive GABA(A)R subtypes is antagonized by Ro15-4513 in an apparently competitive manner, providing a molecular explanation for behavioural Ro15-4513 alcohol antagonism. The identification of a Ro15-4513/EtOH binding site on unique GABA(A)R subtypes opens the possibility to characterize this alcohol site(s) and screen for compounds that modulate the function of EtOH/Ro15-4513-sensitive GABA(A)Rs. The utility of such drugs might range from novel alcohol antagonists that might be useful in the emergency room, to drugs for the treatment of alcoholism, as well as alcohol-mimetic drugs to harness acute positive effects of alcohol.",

The three groups differed regarding dosis and way of application of ketamine (IM10 = 10 mg/kg BW intramuscularly; IM07 = 7 mg/kg BW intramuscularly; SC10 = 10 mg/kg BW subcutaneously). After 30 minutes anaesthesia was partially antagonised with 100 microg/kg BW atipamezole i.m.. Sedation, muscle relaxation, analgesia, and overall anaesthetic impression were compared by a scoring protocol. Reactions to painful stimuli of clamping the spermatic cord or the ovarial ligament including the A. ovarica were judged, too. All animals lost their righting reflex and could be placed in dorsal recumbency. Induction and recovery time were significantly the shortest in study group IM10 with 1.73 +/- 0.3 and 9.73 +/- 4.6 min respectively. Recovery was significantly prolonged in group SC10 with 30.27 +/- 15.6 min. The MMK-anaesthesia with 10 mg/kg ketamine i.m. is very useful for neutering ferrets.

We retrospectively audited all charts with a diagnosis of 'Status Epilepticus' admitted to our hospital from January 1998 to December 2002. A total of 95 episodes of convulsive status epilepticus were recorded. 34 charts were reviewed. Benzodiazepines were the drug class of first choice in 96% of patients.

No one received continuous EEG monitoring during treatment of refractory status epilepticus. Overall mortality was 18%. The results of this study show that there is no consistent protocol was being followed for the management of convulsive status epilepticus in our centre. The drugs of first choice varied between diazepam and lorazepam in most cases. Although phenytoin was used as second line drug, the dose used was frequently suboptimal.

After about 14 hours of sedation, we stopped the infusion of midazolam. From that time, we measured systolic and mean arterial pressure, heart rate, minute volume and oxygen consumption, and evaluated RSS every 5 minutes for 1 hour.

Results show that tolerance in the anxiolytic profile is produced following repeated administration (2 weeks) of diazepam (2 mg/kg) but not buspirone (0.5 mg/kg). The behavioral effects of 8-OH-DPAT at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg were monitored 3 days after repeated administration of saline or buspirone or diazepam. The results show that 8-OH-DPAT elicited forepaw treading was smaller in repeated diazepam but not repeated buspirone injected rats, while hyperlocomotive effects of 8-OH-DPAT were smaller in both repeated buspirone and repeated diazepam injected rats. The results suggest that postsynaptic 5-HT-1A receptor-dependent responses were attenuated following long-term administration of diazepam but not buspirone. Role of 5-HT-1A receptors in the development of tolerance to the anxiolytic effects of diazepam but not buspirone is discussed.",

A total of 30 uncooperative children, aged 3-6 years, belonging to ASA I, II category formed the study group. The efficacy of the three group of drugs was evaluated on the basis of the onset of sedation, duration of action, side effects encountered, and the overall cooperative behavior of the child throughout the course of the procedure, after obtaining parental consent. Results showed that propofol was highly effective in terms of onset of sedation, although increased body movements and crying, pain on injection and intermittent cough was observed as the main side effects of the drug. Midazolam showed the longest duration of action, but was not very effective in terms of treatment completion due to increased movements and crying.

    "171": "The melanocortin system consists of five seven-transmembrane spanning G-protein coupled receptors (MC1-5) that are stimulated by endogenous agonists and antagonized by the only two known endogenous antagonists of GPCRs, agouti and agouti-related protein (AGRP). These receptors have been associated with many physiological functions, including the involvement of the MC4R in feeding behavior and energy homeostasis, making this system an attractive target for the treatment of obesity. Small-molecule mimetics of endogenous ligands may result in the development of compounds with properties more suitable for use as therapeutic agents. The research presented herein involves the synthesis and analysis of 12 melanocortin receptor agonists using the 1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5-dione template and is the first report of these derivatives as melanocortin receptor agonists. Structure-activity relationship studies using this privileged structure template has resulted in molecules with molecular weights around 400 that possess nanomolar agonist potency at the melanocortin receptors examined in this study.", 
    "172": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a multi-system disorder. Mild cognitive deficits are present in a subgroup of non-demented patients with ALS. Detailed neuropsychological assessments reveal deficits of word retrieval including impairments on tests of verbal fluency and confrontation naming. The PET GABA(A) receptor ligand [11C]-flumazenil is a marker of neuronal dysfunction in ALS. This study used [11C]-flumazenil PET to identify correlations between cortical regions and impairments in word retrieval. Twelve patients with ALS underwent [11C]-flumazenil PET and neuropsychological assessment, including tests of written letter fluency and confrontation naming. Poorer performance on verbal fluency correlated with decreased [11C]-flumazenil binding in a region including the right inferior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and anterior insula. Poorer performance on a test of confrontation naming correlated with decreased binding in the left middle frontal gyrus (extending to Broca's area) and left cuneus. This study indicates that [11C]-flumazenil PET can be used to help localize cortical regions associated with cognitive deficits in ALS.",

A stable HEK293 cell line with constitutive expression of the rat GABA(A)R alpha1, beta2, and gamma2 genes was used to establish a functional high-throughput screening (HTS) assay based on measurement of the membrane potential change in living cells. The assay was validated with the FLIPR technology for identification of agonists and positive allosteric modulators using GABA and diazepam as model compounds. The FMP-Red-Dye showed better performance than the FMP-Blue-Dye, and the effects induced by GABA and diazepam were comparable to electrophysiology data. Subsequently, the assay was also validated with an ultra-HTS approach known as microarrayed compound screening (microARCS). The LOPAC library was used in a test screen for an initial assessment of the technology. Finally, the FLIPR and microARCS technologies were tested with a larger screening campaign. A focused library of 3520 putative positive modulators was tested with the FLIPR assay, and a diverse subset of 84,480 compounds was selected for screening with the microARCS technology. All hits were subjected to verification using the FLIPR technology, and confirmed hits were subsequently evaluated by EC50 determination. Finally, selected hits were further confirmed with electrophysiology testing.",

TSPO was localized to the mitochondria of these cells, whereas DBI was cytosolic. As expected, mitochondrial membrane preparations, which were enriched in TSPO, exhibited a high affinity for the TSPO drug ligand, (3)H-labelled PK 11195, as shown by B(max) and K(d) values of 10.0+/-0.5 pmol/mg and 4.0+/-1.0 nM respectively. Intravenous perfusion of PK 11195 increased the salivary flow rate that was induced by muscarinic and alpha-adrenergic agonists, whereas it had no effect when administered alone. Addition of PK 11195 also increased the K(+), Na(+), Cl(-) and protein content of saliva, indicating that this ligand modulated secretion by acini and duct cells.",

Agents that are used to treat this sleep disorder have evolved: benzodiazepines replaced barbiturates, but there is still concern about their residual effects and about the development of dependence and the risk of withdrawal symptoms. Currently the benzodiazepines receptor agonists (zolpidem, zaleplon, zopiclone and eszopiclone) are the agents most widely prescribed. Pharmaceutical technology and the advances in the knowledge of sleep physiology have led to the availability of some novelties like modified release zolpidem (indicated not only to initiate but also to maintain sleep., ramelteon and agomelatine (melatonine receptors agonists). This article summarises these subjects as well as the pharmacology of investigational drugs, such as indiplon (another benzodiazepine receptor agonist), gaboxadol ( a selective extrasynaptic GABAA agonist -SEGA-), and some anticonvulsant drugs that could be useful as hypnotics: tiagabine ( a GABA transporter inhibitor), pregabaline and gabapentine (GABA analogs).

    "195": "Ovarian carcinomas with mutations in the tumour suppressor BRCA2 are particularly sensitive to platinum compounds. However, such carcinomas ultimately develop cisplatin resistance. The mechanism of that resistance is largely unknown. Here we show that acquired resistance to cisplatin can be mediated by secondary intragenic mutations in BRCA2 that restore the wild-type BRCA2 reading frame. First, in a cisplatin-resistant BRCA2-mutated breast-cancer cell line, HCC1428, a secondary genetic change in BRCA2 rescued BRCA2 function. Second, cisplatin selection of a BRCA2-mutated pancreatic cancer cell line, Capan-1 (refs 3, 4), led to five different secondary mutations that restored the wild-type BRCA2 reading frame. All clones with secondary mutations were resistant both to cisplatin and to a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor (AG14361). Finally, we evaluated recurrent cancers from patients whose primary BRCA2-mutated ovarian carcinomas were treated with cisplatin. The recurrent tumour that acquired cisplatin resistance had undergone reversion of its BRCA2 mutation. Our results suggest that secondary mutations that restore the wild-type BRCA2 reading frame may be a major clinical mediator of acquired resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy.", 
    "196": "The definition of status epilepticus (SE) has been reduced from 30 minutes to 5 minutes and this article questions if treatment should not be offered before reaching that window. After provision of first aid, benzodiazepines (BDZ) are the initial form of intervention, with either nasal or buccal midazolam being favored for nonprofessionals. Proper patient supervision, including admission to an intensive care unit for more difficult patients, is endorsed, and the need to warn nonprofessionals of the potential risk of respiratory depression is imperative. The article criticizes the use of phenytoin as the antiepileptic medication (AEM) with which to load patients, as it is no longer a first-line AEM, and argues in favor of using a first-line AEM such as valproate or carbamazepine, or preferably the AEM that previously proved efficacious in a patient with known epilepsy who was noncompliant. Alternative routes of administration of AEMs are discussed, and the use of blood level monitoring, as an adjunct to management, to protect against further episodes of SE, is supported. Touched on in this article are the use of some of the newer AEMs in the management of SE and exploration of treatment strategies that acknowledge that treatment must also include patient education that incorporates techniques to enhance compliance.", 
    "197": "Various synthetic derivatives of natural flavonoids are known to have neuroactive properties. The aim of the present study was to investigate the anticonvulsant effects of rutin (3, 3', 4', 5, 7-pentahydrohyflavone-3-rhamnoglucoside), a flavonoid which is an important dietary constituent of food and plant-based beverages. To this end, we assessed the anticonvulsant effects of rutin in rats treated with pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (90 mg/kg, i.p.) and sought to clarify this mechanism. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of rutin dose-dependently affected minimal clonic seizures (MCS) and generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) induced by PTZ, through increments in seizure onset. Additionally, pretreatment with flumazenil (5 nM, i.c.v.) abolished the anticonvulsant effects of rutin during the onset of both seizures. These results indicate that rutin has anticonvulsant effects in the brain, possibly through positive allosteric modulation of the GABA(A) receptor complex via interaction at the benzodiazepine site.",

    "204": "This study aims to propose a comprehensive new model for schizophrenia, which shows PPI disruption at baseline state as an endophenotype, the development of cross-sensitization to an NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 as a clinical phenotype of the progression into treatment-resistance, and accompanied induction of apoptosis in the medial prefrontal cortex as a critical possibility during the progression. Repeated administration of a high dose of methamphetamine (METH) (2.5 mg/kg), which could increase glutamate levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), induced TUNEL-positive cells in this region, accompanied development of behavioral cross-sensitization to MK-801 in response to a challenge injection of MK-801, and PPI disruption at baseline state without a challenge injection. Olanzapine (OLZ) (1.0 mg/kg) and risperidone (RIS) (0.1 mg/kg), which inhibited and remarkably attenuated METH (2.5 mg/kg)-induced increases in glutamate levels, respectively, blocked not only the induction of TUNEL-positive cells in the mPFC but also the accompanied development of above behavioral abnormalities. These findings suggest that repeating the METH-induced glutamate release produces behavioral abnormalities as a clinical phenotype of schizophrenia, accompanied apoptosis as a critical possibility during the progression, and suggest that sufficient dose of olanzapine and risperidone can block the development of these behavioral abnormalities and accompanied apoptosis during the progression.", 
    "205": "N-Methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor hypofunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and D-serine and glycine add-on therapy to antipsychotics has shown beneficial effects in schizophrenic patients. Nevertheless, previous studies have not shown consistently altered D-serine concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of schizophrenic patients. To confirm and extend these results, CSF concentrations of both endogenous NMDA-receptor co-agonists d-serine and glycine and their common precursor L-serine were analyzed simultaneously in 17 healthy controls and 19 schizophrenic patients before and 6 weeks after daily olanzapine (10 mg) treatment. CSF D-serine, L-serine and glycine concentrations and their relative ratios were similar between schizophrenic patients and controls and no differences were observed before and after olanzapine therapy. Thus, the NMDA-receptor hypofunction hypothesis in schizophrenia is not explained by olanzapine therapy-dependent absolute or relative decreases in CSF D-serine and glycine concentrations in this series of male patients, thereby not providing convenient markers for the disorder.", 
    "206": "Emerging evidence suggests that dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning are altered in pathological gamblers; yet, there are no FDA-approved medications for pathological gambling and there have only been a limited number of clinical trials that have been conducted. Olanzapine was identified as a candidate medication for pathological gamblers because it modifies both dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Moreover, preliminary studies have shown that olanzapine effectively reduces impulsivity in other psychiatric disorders, a pharmacological target of interest for pathological gamblers. In this study, 21 pathological gamblers, whose primary gambling activity was video poker, were enrolled in a seven-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Outcome measures included self-reported urges for gambling, frequency of gambling behavior, and self-reported mood and anxiety levels. The results revealed that all study participants reported reduced levels of gambling urges, gambling behavior, and mood and anxiety symptoms. Olanzapine administration was not associated with an incremental effect versus placebo. While these findings suggest that olanzapine is not an efficacious treatment for video poker pathological gamblers, olanzapine may still be an effective treatment for a specific subset of pathological gamblers, including those with a co-occurring psychiatric disorder."
