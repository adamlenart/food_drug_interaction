Pirenzepine significantly reduced the area under the saliva flow-time curves (7.29 +/- 3.30 g min-1 h without pirenzepine; 4.19 +/- 2.59 g min-1 h with pirenzepine, P less than 0.01). Pirenzepine had no significant effect on plasma paracetamol Cmax (17.5 +/- 7.8 micrograms ml-1 without pirenzepine; 12.6 +/- 7.7 micrograms ml-1 with pirenzepine), plasma tmax (0.2 h (0.2-0.8 h) without pirenzepine; (0.2 h 0.2-0.8 h) with pirenzepine) and plasma AUC(0.6 h) (32.3 +/- 7.2 micrograms ml-1 h without pirenzepine; 30.3 +/- 6.5 micrograms ml-1 h with pirenzepine). 3. Mean ratios of saliva:plasma paracetamol AUC (1.06 +/- 0.24 without pirenzepine; 1.84 +/- 0.48 with pirenzepine, P less than 0.001) and saliva:plasma paracetamol Cmax (1.7 +/- 1.0 without pirenzepine; 6.5 +/- 2.7 with pirenzepine, P less than 0.01) were significantly increased by pirenzepine pretreatment, but there was a poor correlation between the percentage change in the area under the saliva flow-time curve and the percentage change in saliva paracetamol AUC (r = 0.47, P = 0.21). 4. The findings suggest that a) pirenzepine is a more selective antagonist of the muscarinic receptors in salivary glands than those in gastric smooth muscle and b) caution is required when using saliva paracetamol concentrations to determine the pharmacokinetics of the drug in the presence of other agents which may influence salivary flow rate.", 
    "1": "1. Plasma albumin concentration was measured in 118 healthy subjects (aged between 18 and 87 years), in 95 renal patients with creatinine clearances between 15 and 50 ml min-1 (aged between 14 and 79 years) and in 101 uraemic patients maintained on chronic haemodialysis (aged between 27 and 83 years). 2. There was a significant (P less than 0.001) negative correlation between albumin concentration and age in healthy subjects, but no correlation in patients with low creatinine clearance or in uraemic patients. 3. The ex vivo plasma binding of diazepam (1 microM), salicylic acid (2 mM) and digitoxin (37 nM) was studied in groups of age-selected young and aged healthy subjects in patients with low creatinine clearance and in patients with uraemia. The unbound fractions of diazepam and salicylic acid were about double in old compared with young healthy subjects whereas they were similar in young and old patients with lowered creatinine clearance. In uraemic patients, ageing did not affect the binding of salicylic acid whereas the unbound fraction of diazepam was slightly but significantly greater in elderly subjects. The unbound fraction of digitoxin was independent of age in both healthy subjects and in those with renal disease. 4. Decreased plasma binding of diazepam and salicylic acid was partially corrected by extensive dialysis of plasma. The lower plasma binding of diazepam and salicylic acid associated with ageing may be ascribed to the effects of endogenous displacers and to hypoalbuminaemia. The influence of these two factors appears to be drug-dependent.", 
    "2": "Primary care physicians prescribe benzodiazepines for the treatment of anxiety. Although most patients use the benzodiazepines appropriately, some patients experience benzodiazepine abuse, addiction, or physical dependence, each one of which is a distinct syndrome. Benzodiazepine dependence, which relates to the development of tolerance and an abstinence syndrome, can be produced by three disparate benzodiazepine use patterns. These distinct benzodiazepine use patterns can in turn create distinct withdrawal syndromes. High-dose benzodiazepine use between 1 and 6 months can produce an acute sedative-hypnotic withdrawal syndrome. In contrast, low-dose therapeutic range benzodiazepine use longer than 6 months can produce a prolonged, subacute low-dose benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Daily, high-dose benzodiazepine use for more than 6 months can cause a combination of an acute high-dose benzodiazepine withdrawal and a prolonged, subacute low-dose withdrawal syndrome. In addition, patients may experience syndrome reemergence.",

However, all physicians should provide diagnostic and referral services.", 
    "5": "Phenytoin (PHT) is considered a first or second choice in the treatment of status epilepticus that is refractory to benzodiazepines. The use of an intravenous bolus injection of PHT is hazardous due to the risk of cardiac conduction disturbances, dose-dependent side effects in general, as well as the possibility of severe necrotic lesions in case of extravasation. We compared the number and intensity of side effects and serum level profiles of a highly concentrated, non-dilutable bolus (46 mg/ml) of PHT [Fenytoin, DAK] with a dilutable standard solution (1.5 mg/ml) [Phenhydan] administered intravenously in 500 ml saline. Six healthy volunteers received both regiments (9.1 mg/kg). The diluted solution showed a curvilinear saturation curve with a lower concentration maximum (C-max) than the concentrated solution. Lower toxicity of the diluted solution was indicated by a clinical rating of side effects. Based on a higher incidence and degree of side effects following administration of the more concentrated formulation of PHT, compared with the more diluted preparation, we recommend the use of the less concentrated formulation.", 
    "6": "Status epilepticus may be resistant to intravenous anticonvulsive drugs. In these cases treatment with the inhalation anaesthetic agent isoflurane may be helpful in the further management. We describe a 35-year-old female patient who suffered from status epilepticus with partial seizures. In spite of therapy with benzodiazepine and phenytoin the status evolved into tonic clonic seizures. Treatment with thiopentone sodium did not stop seizure activity. Anaesthesia with isoflurane (dosage up to 1.5 vol.%) carried out twice within 72 h finally led to a termination of status epilepticus. From our own experience and reports in the literature we conclude that general anaesthesia with isoflurane can and should be used in the treatment of severe status epilepticus that does not respond to intravenous anticonvulsive agents.", 
    "7": "In this retrospective study, experience in status epilepticus (SE) over an 18-month period at the Port-of-Spain General Hospital is reported. Sixty-three episodes in 41 patients were studied. Fifty-one per cent of patients were under 10 years of age. Fifty-one per cent of patients were classified as remote symptomatic, 29% idiopathic, 15% acute symptomatic and 5% febrile. Bolus doses of diazepam were used in 62 of 63 episodes, phenytoin in 18, diazepam infusion in 9, paraldehyde in 12 and phenobarbitone in 9. Seizures were controlled within half-hour of starting treatment in 55 episodes (87%). In 3 episodes in 2 patients (5%), control was poor and exceeded 18 hours. No deaths were recorded. Two neurological deficits and 8 other morbid events were recorded. Mean hospital stay was 2.9 days. No patient was ventilated or admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. Current drug therapy is highly effective in SE even in institutions where modern intensive care technology is limited. Prognosis is excellent in patients in whom the underlying aetiology is benign.", 
    "8": "In animal models of epilepsy the anticonvulsant profile of loreclezole resembles that of barbiturates and benzodiazepines. We examined whether the increase in seizure threshold to pentylenetetrazole infusion produced by 10 mg/kg of loreclezole, pentobarbital or diazepam could be reversed by a spectrum of benzodiazepine partial inverse to full inverse agonists (FG-7142 beta-carboline carboxylate, CGS-8216, Ro-15-4513 and DMCM) or by a benzodiazepine neutral antagonist (Ro-15-1788). The doses of the benzodiazepine inverse agonists were chosen to produce a 20-40% decrease in seizure threshold. The seizure threshold increase produced by loreclezole and pentobarbital was reduced by all the benzodiazepine inverse agonists and potentiated by Ro-15-1788. Diazepam was antagonized by the benzodiazepine inverse agonists and by the neutral antagonist. The generality of this finding was examined in amygdala-kindled rats. The decrease in the duration of forepaw clonus and the reduction in behavioural stage34 produced by loreclezole, pentobarbital and diazepam was reversed by CGS-8216. Ro-15-1788, which itself showed anticonvulsant effects in this model, antagonized the effects of diazepam, but not loreclezole or pentobarbital. Thus loreclezole behaves more like a barbiturate than a benzodiazepine in these two in vivo models. This suggests a possible mechanism of action of loreclezole at a neuromodulatory site within the GABAA receptor complex, which is unlikely to be a benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "9": "This study found that one-fifth of patients admitted to a general hospital psychiatric unit meet the diagnostic criteria for abuse of, or dependence on, psychoactive substances other than alcohol. Many of the substances involved are prescribed medications. Dependence on benzodiazepines and other sedatives was the most common substance use disorder among patients with a variety of other psychiatric diagnoses. We are also concerned by the extent of reported abuse of analgesic compounds and feel it is necessary to modify our initial diagnostic assessments so that patients with these disorders can be recognized at an early stage and managed appropriately.",

    "17": "The validity of the general neurotic syndrome, a combination of anxiety, depression and dependent personality disorder, was examined in a 2-year study of outpatients with dysthymic, panic and generalized anxiety disorder diagnosed using a structured interview schedule. The general neurotic syndrome, found in a third of the patients, was associated with greater mental disorder and a significantly worse outcome than patients without the syndrome. It did not, however, predict response to treatment. Further analysis revealed that the general neurotic syndrome was a better predictor of short- and long-term outcome than any other variable apart from initial psychopathology score. It is argued that the syndrome may represent a personality diathesis that makes the individual more vulnerable to both anxiety and depressive symptoms.",

    "19": "Reflex myoclonus displays symptomatological heterogeneity involving the cortical and brain stem types that seem to originate above the spinal cord. Three cases of generalized myoclonus proved to be spontaneous and stimulus-sensitive, and increased with action. Segmental spinal myoclonus was spontaneous, stimulus-sensitive and rhythmical and decreased with action. Two cases of post-anoxic myoclonus seemed to be of the reticular reflex in which myoclonus was manifested in all muscles, particularly the proximal ones, and for which the EEG showed no spikes preceding myoclonus. The evoked electromyogram showed a long-loop reflex (LLR) of high amplitude, with no giant somatosensory evoked potential (SEP). Pharmacological examinations showed that the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) enhanced the onset of myoclonus, shortened the latency of the LLR and increased its amplitude, but caused no remarkable changes in SEP. These results indicate that TRH stimulates the medullary reticular neuron, thereby enhancing reticular reflex myoclonus. The myoclonus of a 3rd case was believed to be cortical reflex myoclonus on the basis of the emergence of giant SEP, increased LLR and the onset of spikes in the EEGs preceding myoclonic jerks, as ascertained by jerk-locked averaging analysis with muscular discharge. Pharmacologically, LLR, SEP and myoclonus showed no definite changes in response to TRH. Segmental myoclonus which seemed to have a spinal origin, showed no giant SEP, enhanced LLR or cortical spikes in the electrophysiological studies. No definite clinical or electrophysiological changes in response to TRH were observed. We believe the TRH administration test may be useful in the differential diagnosis of stimulus-sensitive myoclonus. In addition, the origins and nature of these types of reflex myoclonus are discussed.", 
    "20": "The ability of gastrin, histamine, and carbachol to stimulate acid secretion by direct action on gastric parietal cells is well established but the role of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in mediating these effects is the subject of some controversy. To examine this issue further, secretagogue-mediated changes in [Ca2+]i in single isolated canine gastric parietal cells were examined by microspectrofluorometry of fura-2-loaded cells. Resting [Ca2+]i in single parietal cells was 63 +/- 6 (SE) nM. Carbachol, 10(-5) M, induced a maximum elevation in [Ca2+]i with an initial transient rise of 178 +/- 24 (SE) nM, which was maintained in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and a sustained plateau of 112 +/- 20 (SE) nM, which was abolished by removal of extracellular Ca2+. Both effects were reversed by the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine. Gastrin (10(-9)-10(-7) M) also induced a bimodal rise in [Ca2+]i with a maximal initial transient rise of 206 +/- 14 nM and a sustained plateau of 94 +/- 9 nM. Both components of the [Ca2+]i response to gastrin were reversed by the gastrin specific antagonist L 365260. Lower concentrations of gastrin (10(-10) M) induced repetitive transient increases (oscillations) in cytosolic Ca2+. The amplitude of the first spike was less than 50% of the transient rise in [Ca2+]i stimulated by 10(-8) M gastrin. The oscillations occurred at a rate of 0.9/min, gradually decreasing in amplitude within 15 min of secretagogue administration. Histamine (10(-4) M) led to a minimal rise in [Ca2+]i (less than 5% of control) in less than 10% of the canine parietal cells tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "Current pharmacotherapy for panic disorder generally consists of a trial of antidepressants or benzodiazepines for at least 3 months, with continuation for 6 to 12 months when patients respond favorably. However, the most appropriate time to discontinue medication has not yet been determined. The author discusses reasons for discontinuation, both appropriate and inappropriate; optimal timing for discontinuation; outcomes of discontinuation (i.e., remaining well, relapse, rebound, and withdrawal); strategies, including dosage taper, to avoid or minimize unfavorable outcomes; and long-term outcomes in patients treated for panic disorder.

The cumulative percentages of patients with relapse of ulcers at 12 months by life-table analysis were 61% with no treatment, 38% with mealtime antacids, 60% with trimipramine, 52% with pirenzepine, 46% with cimetidine 200 mg, 44% with cimetidine 400 mg, 30% with ranitidine 150 mg, and 40% with sucralfate. Cimetidine 400 mg, antacids, ranitidine 150 mg, and sucralfate were significantly better than no treatment and the other forms of treatment. Ranitidine was significantly better than antacids, cimetidine, and sucralfate in preventing endoscopically documented duodenal ulcer relapse by multiple comparison at 12 months, but not by life-table analysis nor when symptomatic relapses were compared. No significant difference was detected among antacids, cimetidine, and sucralfate. No major side effects occurred with the seven forms of treatment, but those receiving antacids had the highest incidence of minor adverse events (26%).", 
    "27": "This study suggests that mealtime antacids are as effective as H2-receptor antagonists and sucralfate in the maintenance treatment of duodenal ulcer disease, but have to be taken three times a day and had the highest incidence of reported minor adverse events.

    "28": "The brainstem solitary complex, which receives projections from primary sensory afferents of the vagus nerve, appears to be a crucial site for the action of the cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK8), because both peripheral-type (CCKA) and central-type (CCKB) binding sites are present in this structure. In the present study, we investigated the effects of recently developed receptor-specific pharmacological tools on neurons recorded in rat coronal brainstem slices, to ascertain whether CCK acts differently on each type of receptor. CCK8, which interacts with both binding sites, had three effects on neuronal discharge, brief excitation, prolonged excitation and delayed inhibition. BC 264, a novel CCK analog endowed with high affinity and selectivity for CCKB receptors, produced exclusively prolonged excitation. L-365,260, a novel nonpeptide antagonist of CCKB receptors, blocked the prolonged excitation induced by BC 264 or CCK8. L-364,718, a potent antagonist of CCKA receptors, blocked delayed inhibition and replaced brief CCK8-induced excitation by prolonged excitation. Altogether, these results show that CCK8 exerts, on neurons of the solitary complex, mixed effects due to simultaneous activation of CCKA inhibitory and CCKB excitatory binding sites. The hypothesis that exogenous CCK8 acts, in the solitary complex, through CCKA sites to slow down the motility of the digestive tract and through CCKB sites to modulate anxiety will be developed.",

Among these approaches, transdermal and transmucosal applications appear particularly promising because of the accessibility, noninvasiveness, compliance, safety, and efficacy associated with the techniques. Fentanyl, as the prototypical opioid for transdermal and transmucosal applications, and midazolam (a benzodiazepine) will ultimately be replaced with newer synthetic compounds specifically formulated for these routes of administration.",

Effective management requires a differential diagnosis. Adjustment sleep disorder, primary snoring, inadequate sleep hygiene, and mood disorders are common in the aged. The physician needs to review the patient history, including stressful events, medications, medical illness, and the possible presence of a psychiatric disorder. Treatment often involves behavioral changes and conservative use of medications, including antidepressants or benzodiazepines.", 
    "31": "To enhance our understanding of cholinergic mechanisms and muscarinic receptors in bronchoconstriction, we have characterized the muscarinic receptor subtypes in rabbit tracheal smooth muscle using radioligand binding and functional assays. The Kd for [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H](-)QNB) binding determined from saturation isotherms was 12.6 x/divided by 1.1 pM (geometric mean x/divided by SEM), and the Bmax was 269 +/- 7 fmol/mg protein (arithmetic mean +/- SEM). Competitive inhibition studies with the muscarinic antagonists pirenzepine (PZ), 11[[2-[(diethylamino)-methyl]1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H- pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX116), 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide (4-DAMP), and hexahydrosiladifenidol (HHSiD) demonstrated heterogeneity of muscarinic receptor subtypes in rabbit tracheal smooth muscle. PZ bound with low affinity to a single receptor site, indicative of an absence of M1 receptors. AF-DX116 (M2 selective) bound with high affinity to approximately 83% of muscarinic binding sites, and 4-DAMP and HHSiD (M3 antagonists) bound with high affinity to approximately 24 and 28% of muscarinic binding sites, respectively. Additionally, direct binding studies with [3H]4-DAMP demonstrated high-affinity binding with 23% of muscarinic binding sites. Thus, the majority of muscarinic receptors in rabbit tracheal smooth muscle bound with high affinity to an M2-selective antagonist, and the remaining receptor sites bound with high affinity to M3 antagonists. The inhibitory effects of atropine, PZ, AF-DX116, and 4-DAMP on methacholine-induced contraction of rabbit tracheal rings were compared. 4-DAMP was a potent inhibitor of methacholine-induced contraction, but PZ and AF-DX116 demonstrated low potency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "32": "To determine the induction and maintenance characteristics of desflurane in pediatric patients, the authors anesthetized 206 infants and children aged 1 month to 12 yr with nitrous oxide plus desflurane and/or halothane in oxygen. Patients were assigned to one of four groups: anesthesia was 1) induced and maintained with desflurane after premedication with an oral combination of meperidine, diazepam, and atropine; 2) induced and maintained with desflurane; 3) induced with halothane and maintained with desflurane; or 4) induced and maintained with halothane. An unblinded observer recorded time to loss of consciousness (lid reflex), time to intubation, and clinical characteristics of the induction and maintenance of anesthesia. Moderate-to-severe laryngospasm (49%) and moderate-to-severe coughing (58%) occurred frequently during induction of anesthesia with desflurane; the incidence of these was not altered by premedication. In contrast, laryngospasm and coughing were rare during induction of anesthesia with halothane. In unpremedicated patients, time to loss of lid reflex (mean +/- SD) was similar for desflurane (2.4 +/- 1.2 min) and halothane (2.1 +/- 0.8 min). During induction of anesthesia, before laryngoscopy and intubation, mean arterial pressure less than 80% of baseline was more common with halothane; heart rate and mean arterial pressure greater than 120% of baseline were more common with desflurane. Intraoperatively, heart rate greater than 120% of baseline was more common with desflurane; blood pressures were similar for the two anesthetics. The authors conclude that the high incidence of airway complications during induction of anesthesia with desflurane limits its utility for inhalation induction in pediatric patients. Anesthesia can be safely maintained with desflurane if induced with a different anesthetic.",

    "34": "L-T3 (T3) accumulates into cells in a temperature-dependent saturable manner through a purported iodothyronine membrane carrier protein. We report energy-dependent uptake of picomolar [125I]T3 into differentiated cell lines derived from human liver, human neuroblast, and rat pituitary malignancies. Furthermore, this cellular uptake is inhibited by classical and nonclassical benzodiazepine-type drugs (BZs); the apparent half-maximal inhibitory concentrations range from 50 nM to 50 microM, varying with drug and cell type. The site of this T3-BZ interaction was explored with cross-competitive radioligand binding to rat liver cell fractions. No interaction was seen in experiments cross-competing unlabeled T3 (10(-9)-10(-5) M) against [3H]Ro5 4864, a peripheral BZ receptor ligand, for binding sites in a crude rat liver mitochondrial fraction. As well, lormetazepam and triazolam, BZs that potently inhibit cellular uptake of [125I]T3, have no effect on [125I]T3 binding to rat liver nuclear sites. Studies of [3H]diazepam and [3H]Ro5 4864 show very little temperature-dependent uptake into HepG2 cells (less than 0.5% over 90 min) and no effect from coincubation of unlabeled T3 (1 microM). Thus, the possibility that BZs are substrates for the T3 carrier protein and are causing the reduced cellular hormonal accumulation via competitive uptake and dilution of the radiolabeled cellular T3 is unlikely. In summary, 1) drugs from the BZ class inhibit high affinity temperature-dependent cellular accumulation of thyroid hormone into cell lines from rat and human species; 2) the site of action of BZ inhibition does not involve direct antagonism of the T3 nuclear receptor, nor is it likely that the peripheral BZ receptor is the iodothyronine carrier. BZs could be interacting with the purported iodothyronine carrier protein itself to block uptake.",

The patient continued convulsing in the emergency department and was treated with diazepam. Laboratory tests were unremarkable, as were lumbar puncture, computed tomography scan, and blood cultures. Skin decontamination was performed. DEET levels in the urine were 0.003 micrograms/mL. Although seizures and encephalopathic syndrome have been described with DEET in previous case reports involving topical exposure of pediatric patients, atypical aspects with regard to this case include that this patient was a male (most other case reports involve females), exposure was relatively brief compared with other reports, and the patient developed seizures without a prodrome described in previous reports. Avoidance of high-concentration DEET formulations in pediatric patients should be considered.",

The endotoxin-induced hypotensive effect was prevented by phenothiazine pretreatment of the dogs; however, the endotoxin-phenothiazine complex had the same effect as the endotoxin itself. The tumor necrosis factor-inducing ability of endotoxin in human monocytes was prevented by promethazine. The TNF induction by endotoxin was inhibited by promethazine in vivo.", 
    "38": "The use of more than 130 drugs and drug combinations against the alcohol withdrawal syndrome reflects the fact that views on its treatment are far from being unequivocal. Benzodiazepines are the first choice treatment but it should not be disregarded that they have side effects and, above all, a varying risk of dependency themselves. In recent years many trials have focused on carbamazepine in this respect. Its efficacy was proven in various open and double-blind studies, most of them using concomitant sedative drugs, thereby diminishing the reliability of the results. In a double-blind study we compared the efficacy of carbamazepine with that of oxazepam, in 60 in-patients suffering from alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The main rating instrument was the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Scale--Alcohol (CIWA-A). The 7-day trial showed equal efficacy of carbamazepine and oxazepam during the first 5 days and a statistically significant superiority of carbamazepine on days 6 and 7. Four patients in each group had to be dropped from the study due to side effects or after having withdrawn informed consent. There was no decrease in white blood counts under carbamazepine. The experiences with carbamazepine up to now suggest a more widespread use, especially in non-delirious withdrawal states.", 
    "39": "The effects of chronic moderate (15%) ethanol consumption and ageing on rat hepatic cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activities were examined using diazepam, nordazepam, d-benzphetamine, erythromycin, ethylmorphine and nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) as substrates. In addition, the effects of moderate ethanol alone on the oxidation of metoprolol, morphine and temazepam were examined. Cytochrome P450 specific content increased significantly only in the 6-week ethanol-treated rats, and no changes in percentage liver to body weights were apparent in any of the ethanol-treated animals compared with pair-fed controls. Only cytochrome P450IIIA enzyme activities displayed age-related decreases, these being identified in the pair-fed animals. C3-hydroxylation of diazepam and nordazepam (36% of controls) and N-demethylation of erythromycin and ethylmorphine (58% and 64% of controls) were decreased in 6-week ethanol-treated animals, these effects being less pronounced in the 12, 24 and 48-week ethanol-treated groups. The decrease seen for diazepam and d-benzphetamine N-demethylation caused by ethanol consumption was approximately 80% of control groups for the duration of the treatment. NDMA and morphine N-demethylations were increased to 120% of control activities and metoprolol alpha-hydroxylase was increased to 140% of control activities at 6 weeks, whilst metoprolol O-demethylase activity remained unaltered. NDMA N-demethylase activity showed a two-fold induction at 24 and 48 weeks of ethanol treatment, compared with corresponding pair-fed control groups. These results support previous findings from this laboratory showing that the same or similar P450IIIA family isozymes are involved in the C3-hydroxylation of diazepam and nordazepam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "P-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol hydrochloride (p-F-HHSiD) (15, 30 micrograms) and pirenzepine (7.5, 15, 30 micrograms), which are highly selective M3 and M1 muscarinic antagonists, respectively, were injected intracerebroventricularly into freely moving rats. p-F-HHSiD (30 micrograms) reduced wakefulness (W) (from 34.7 +/- 3.1 to 24.9 +/- 1.3 min) and increased slow wave sleep (SWS) (from 56.7 +/- 2.4 to 67.2 +/- 1.5 min); however, it did not modify desynchronized sleep (DS) latency and percentage in 6 h recordings. W and SWS were not affected by pirenzepine (7.5, 15, 30 micrograms) which decreased significantly DS amount but left unaffected DS latency. The results suggest that each muscarinic receptor subtype may induce different and specific changes in sleep phases and cortical desynchronization processes.", 
    "41": "Super-delayed loss of muscarinic-1 (M1) receptors and the protective effect of propentofylline on these changes were examined in the gerbil hippocampus after transient ischemia with radioactive pirenzepine. M1 receptors were markedly decreased in the gerbil hippocampus 14 days after transient ischemia. Single administration of propentofylline (20 mg/kg, ip) just after transient ischemia almost completely prevented the ischemia-induced decrease in the number of M1 receptors, and had no effect in sham-operated controls. These findings suggest that one of the therapeutic efficacies of propentofylline is the result of the normalization of the dysfunction of the acetylcholine neuronal system in cerebrovascular disease.", 
    "42": "This procedure was developed as an overall benzodiazepine confirmation scheme and includes the detection of the most important urinary analytes encountered by clinical toxicology laboratories in North America: alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, alpha-hydroxytriazolam, 2-hydroxyethylflurazepam, oxazepam, temazepam, and lorazepam. Desmethyldiazepam (nordiazepam) was not targeted because it is metabolized to oxazepam. This procedure takes advantage of beta-glucuronidase hydrolysis for analysis of intact benzodiazepine molecules, oxazepam-2H5 as an internal standard, a newly developed extraction solvent, and a silylating moiety that may be more sensitive than trimethylsilyl (-TMS) derivatives, the tertbutyldimethylsilyl (-TBDMS) derivative. For all compounds the extraction efficiency was greater than 90% and the limit of quantitation (LOQ at a S/N of 10) was less than 10 ng/mL. Coefficients of variation for a 200-ng/mL control were less than 5% and less than or equal to 11% for within-run and between-run trials, respectively. Of 13 human specimens screened by EMIT and most with self-reported histories, alpha-hydroxyalprazolam was found in seven (range 49-1264 ng/mL), oxazepam was found in five (72-3897 ng/mL), and lorazepam (476 ng/mL), 2-hydroxyethylflurazepam (2301 ng/mL), and alpha-hydroxytriazolam (106 ng/mL) in one each.", 
    "43": "This preliminary study evaluates the cardiac and neurological risks associated with the sudden antagonism of benzodiazepine (BZD)--induced sedation in dogs intoxicated with tricyclic anti-depressants (TCA). Twelve dogs were anesthetized with midazolam and ventilated with room air. EEG, ECG, and arterial pressure were continuously recorded. An infusion of amitriptyline (6 dogs) or clomipramine (6 dogs) 1 mg/kg. min was maintained until signs of cardiotoxicity (QRS prolongation, hypotension or arrhythmias) occurred. The effects of a bolus of flumazenil 0.2 mg/kg were then observed until 120 minutes. In amitriptyline poisoning, BZD reversal was associated with development of convulsions in 3 dogs, with severe arrhythmias in 4 and with one death. In clomipramine intoxication, 2 dogs developed sudden fatal arrhythmias. These results show that BZD reversal may unmask the convulsant properties and increase the severity of arrhythmias induced by TCA.", 
    "44": "Cost-effective immunoassays for the detection of amphetamines, benzodiazepines, and methadone in urine have been developed using Syva EMIT reagents and a Cobas Bio centrifugal analyser. With this method up to 2470 samples can be assayed with a single 100 test EMIT kit while maintaining acceptable precision. Mean CVs of 3.8-6.6% were obtained for concentrations around the manufacturer's recommended threshold level (300 micrograms/l). Comparison of the methods with the Abbott TDx system showed good correlation for methadone. The methods compared less well for amphetamines, and it was not possible to obtain a useful correlation for benzodiazepines. Heat treatment prior to analysis did not affect the detection of benzodiazepines and methadone; there was a mean decrease of 14% for amphetamines.", 
    "45": "Twenty five female patients (3 groups) operated on for cholelithiasis without premedication have been examined. In patients of group F an effective flormidal dose (EFD) causing an unconscious state upon intravenous injection by a measuring device has been determined. Due to an insufficient sedative effect of moradol it was impossible to determine an effective moradol dose (EMD). In group M+F right after intravenous administration of a standard moradol dose (SMD) flormidal infusion was begun, as in patients of group F. EFD after moradol injection (EFMD) was determined. Making proportions with known EFD, EFMD and SMD values, EMD was calculated. Upon intravenous administration of the calculated EMD by a measuring device the sedative effect was superficial in all the patients of group M and it was impossible to achieve an unconscious state. The interaction of moradol (butorphanol tartrate) and flormidal (midazolam) in the patients' body is of synergic nature.", 
    "46": "Although the diamond anvil cell (DAC) has been used in many forensic science laboratories for the analysis of trace evidence, few applications of this technique for the analysis of controlled substances have been reported. This may be due to both an unfamiliarity on the part of forensic drug chemists with this accessory and the nature and quality of spectra that result from use of a DAC on a dispersive instrument. Along with low energy throughput, which results in relatively high noise levels, strong broad diamond absorptions occur. With the use of a Fourier transform infrared instrument, these do not present a problem and nanogram quantities of materials can be analyzed when the DAC is used with an infrared microscope. Since single crystals can be sampled with the DAC, simple physical separations (involving particle-picking) can be used in certain cases to isolate drugs from particulate mixtures for infrared analysis. This method is especially useful for some \"difficult\" mixtures and residues, and several examples of such analyses involving samples of forensic science interest are presented.", 
    "47": "Several newly discovered potent and selective non-nucleoside inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) are undergoing evaluation in clinical trials. We studied the potential for development of viral resistance to one of the prototype compounds, BI-RG-587, a dipyridodiazepinone derivative. Human immunodeficiency virus-1 resistant to BI-RG-587 emerged after only one cycle of in vitro infection in the presence of the drug. Resistant virus was cross-resistant to the non-nucleoside tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]benzodiazepin-2(1H)-thione derivative R82150 but remained susceptible to 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides and phosphonoformate. Both native (virion-associated) and recombinant RT derived from resistant virus were insensitive to BI-RG-587 and R82150. Nucleotide sequence analysis of multiple drug-resistant and -sensitive recombinant RT clones identified a single predicted amino acid change common to all resistant clones (tyrosine-181----cysteine). These studies suggest that the viral resistance to non-nucleoside RT inhibitors may develop in vivo. This possibility should be carefully monitored in clinical trials of these compounds.", 
    "48": "We examined the effects of bombesin on rat pancreatic digestive enzyme gene expression using cloned complementary DNA probes for amylase, trypsinogen I, chymotrypsinogen B, and lysophospholipase. Rats were injected sc three times daily with 5 nmol/kg body wt bombesin. Pancreata were investigated after 6, 12, 24, 48, and 120 h of hormone treatment. Bombesin administration resulted in a time-dependent increase of pancreatic weight, as well as DNA and protein concentration. Cellular hypertrophy became evident after 48 h, and pancreatic hyperplasia occurred after 5 days of hormone treatment. Bombesin administration resulted in a time-dependent parallel decrease of amylase and lysophospholipase messenger RNA (mRNA) concentrations with maximal inhibition occurring after 120 h of bombesin treatment (13 +/- 1% and 14 +/- 3% of control, respectively, P less than 0.05, n = 6). In contrast, chymotrypsin and trypsin mRNA levels remained unaltered after bombesin treatment for up to 5 days. Amylase and chymotrypsin enzyme levels did not correlate with their respective mRNA concentrations. Both decreased to approximately 50% of control after 12 h and increased to 126 +/- 38% of control and 388 +/- 109% of control (P less than 0.05, n = 6), respectively, after 5 days of bombesin treatment. To test whether the bombesin regulation was mediated by the release of cholecystokinin (CCK), the specific CCK receptor antagonist L-364,718 (1 mg/kg body wt) was injected ip either alone, or 15 min before each bombesin injection for 5 days. Although the antagonist alone significantly reduced the mRNA concentrations for trypsin, chymotrypsin, and lysophospholipase to approximately 50%, it did not block the effects of bombesin on pancreatic digestive enzyme levels. These data therefore indicate that bombesin regulates pancreatic digestive enzyme mRNA and protein concentrations in a nonparallel manner; furthermore, CCK is not involved in mediating the bombesin effects on pancreatic gene expression.", 
    "49": "The effects of electric footshock stress(EFS) and conditioned fear stress(CFS) on dopamine(DA) and serotonin(5-HT) metabolism in seven various brain regions of the rat were studied by measuring dihydroxyphenylacetic acid(DOPAC), homovanillic acid(HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid(5-HIAA). EFS for 30 min increased DOPAC and HVA levels in all seven brain regions and increased 5-HIAA levels in the medial prefrontal cortex(mPFC), nucleus accumbens and amygdala. CFS(exposure to an environment paired previously with footshock) increased plasma corticosterone levels and defecation, and induced freezing behavior. It also increased DOPAC levels in the mPFC, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and lateral hypothalamus, increased HVA levels in the mPFC and amygdala, and increased the 5-HIAA level in the mPFC. In contrast to EFS, which increased DA and 5-HT metabolism in several other brain regions, increased metabolism of both DA and 5-HT was especially marked in the mPFC after CFS. In this model, two classes of anxiolytics were examined for effects on freezing behavior. The benzodiazepine diazepam, a classical anxiolytic, reduced the freezing response. The new anxiolytic ipsapirone, a selective 5-HT1A agonist, also reduced the freezing response. These findings suggest the usefulness of this model for detecting the anxiolytic potential of drugs and examining the relation between 5-HT and anxiety.", 
    "50": "In vivo microdialysis has been used to study the effect of pre- or post-ischaemic administration of the non-NMDA antagonist 1-(4-amino-phenyl)-4-methyl-7, 8-methyl-endioxyl-5H-2,3- benzodiazepine hydrochloride (GYKI 52466), on the increases in extracellular glutamate levels induced by 20 minutes of four vessel occlusion in rats. In control rats, ischaemia resulted in transient increases in glutamate (4 fold), aspartate (6 fold) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (15 fold) and decreases in glutamine (0.5 fold). Intravenous administration of GYKI 52466 (10 mg kg-1 bolus followed by 10 mg kg-1 h-1 infusion) beginning 20 minutes prior to the induction of ischaemia abolished ischaemia-induced glutamate release without affecting the increases in aspartate and GABA and the decrease in glutamine. Administration of GYKI 52466 immediately post-ischaemia resulted in a more rapid return of glutamate levels to basal values.", 
    "51": "Tandospirone is a novel non-benzodiazepine compound possessing potent anxiolytic properties in a water lick conflict paradigm in rats and a high affinity for central 5-HT1A receptors. In the present study, tandospirone was evaluated for anxiolytic activity in a modified Geller-Seifter conflict paradigm in rats. Tandospirone produced significant increases in the punished responding at doses of 1.25, 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg, i.p. or 20 mg/kg, p.o., although it decreased unpunished responding at doses of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg, i.p. or 20 mg/kg, p.o. Likewise, diazepam was also effective after i.p.-administration in this test, and its minimum effective dose was slightly higher than that of tandospirone. This suggests that tandospirone might be as effective in the treatment of anxiety as diazepam. The anticonflict action of tandospirone was not inhibited by Ro-15-1788, a benzodiazepine antagonist, although that of diazepam was completely inhibited. 8-OH-DPAT, a full agonist of 5-HT1A receptors, was also effective in this test with a high potency. Therefore, the possibility exists that the anticonflict action of tandospirone is related to its agonist action on 5-HT1A receptors, not on benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "52": "The present study investigated whether there is any difference between the effects of benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics on agonistic behavior in male mice, using an ethopharmacological technique. Agonistic behavior was evoked using a resident-intruder paradigm. The effects of four doses of the following drugs were assessed in either resident or intruder mice: diazepam (vehicle, 1, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg, p.o.) and tandospirone (vehicle, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg, p.o.). Residents and intruders were drugged on alternate test days, and all animals received different sequences of each of the drug conditions according to a random schedule. The injection-test interval was 30 min. When a resident mice were treated with either diazepam or tandospirone, the frequency of attack bite was suppressed significantly in a dose-dependent manner. When intruder mice were treated with diazepam, attack bites by untreated residents were significantly increased, whereas tandospirone was ineffective. Although diazepam caused a significant decrease in both locomotion and rearing, tandospirone did not cause motor dysfunction. These evidence indicate that tandospirone, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, has different pharmacological properties from diazepam.", 
    "53": "Solid-phase extraction (SPE) by means of disposable columns has become a widely accepted technique for sample pretreatment in toxicology, both for directed analyses and for screening analyses. However, the sample capacity in SPE is usually limited to a few millilitres. Therefore, we have investigated to what extent these problems can be overcome by using Empore extraction disks, consisting of chemically modified C-8 reversed-phase silica, embedded in an inert polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) matrix. Human urine was selected as the matrix and dexetimide and mepyramine were initially used as test drugs because these drugs were available in tritiated form. Additional drugs investigated included codeine, hexobarbital, imipramine, methamphetamine, and nitrazepam. In these investigations, the sample capacity for untreated urine was at least 25 mL, and analyte quantities up to 250 micrograms could be retained by these filters. Washing with water/methanol mixtures was successful in removing substantial amounts of endogenous interferences, and methanol proved to be an acceptable eluent. Thus, these disks seem to have interesting potential for toxicological analysis in that sample concentration and cleanup can be achieved at the same time.", 
    "54": "Personal experience of analgesia-sedation in ESWL is reported, stress being laid on the importance of anxiety treatment by means of premedication with benzodiazepine. In personal experience, this preventive treatment proved very useful in reducing the consumption of opioids and thus in rendering the pain experience of patients undergoing treatment less unpleasant. At the same time it is reported that in some patients it was necessary to administer benzodiazepines with a more marked hypnotic effect. In these cases, the possibility of countering the hypnotic effect with a specific antagonist made it possible to resort to these drugs in patients who were subjected to ESWL in a day-hospital regime.", 
    "55": "Xylazine and medetomidine produce reliable sedation, muscle relaxation, and analgesia in dogs and cats. In addition, alpha-2 agonists have proved very effective as sedative-analgesic adjuncts when coadministered with benzodiazepine or opioid agonists. Alpha-2 agonists should not be classified as monoanesthetics. They are excellent anesthetic adjuncts when combined with dissociatives and opioids. Because of the acute alterations in cardiopulmonary function commonly induced by alpha-2 agonists, it is suggested that their use be restricted to the young healthy patient undergoing routine surgical or diagnostic procedure. The development of more specific and selective alpha-2 agonists will continue to enhance the safety and reliability of this novel class of compounds. The unique spectrum of anesthetic properties induced by alpha-2 agonists has assured them of an increasingly prominent role in the development of new and sophisticated ways of achieving anesthesia.", 
    "56": "The effects of a new anxiolytic, (2-(7-chloro-1,8-naphthyridin-2-yl)-3- [(1,4-dioxa-8-azaspiro[4.5]dec-8-yl)-carbonylmethyl] isoindolin-1-one (DN-2327), on the execution of step-through passive avoidance and delayed spontaneous alternation tasks were assessed and compared with those of diazepam (DZP) and buspirone. DN-2327 and buspirone (both 10 and 20 mg/kg, PO) impaired performance in the 48-h passive avoidance recall test when given prior to the test session, but not when given before the training trial. DZP impaired the performance at doses of more than 5 and more than 10 mg/kg PO when given prior to the test session and when given before the training trial, respectively. The action of DZP (10 mg/kg PO) when given before the training trial was antagonized by flumazenil (20 mg/kg, IP) and tended to be antagonized by DN-2327 (10 and 30 mg/kg, PO), but was not affected by buspirone. No evidence for possible amnesic effects of DN-2327 or buspirone on working memory was found in the delayed spontaneous alternation task, but DZP (3 and 10 mg/kg, PO) caused significant impairment of working memory. Electroshock sensitivities detected by flinch, jump, and vocalization thresholds were not influenced significantly by DN-2327 (30 and 100 mg/kg, PO), DZP (10 and 30 mg/kg, PO) or buspirone (30 and 100 mg/kg, PO).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "58": "1. In order to prove that neuroleptanxiolysis represents a therapeutical alternative in the treatment of patients suffering from anxiety we conducted four investigations. 2. In the first study it was experimentally proved with 45 outpatients suffering from anxiety that fluspirilene (1.5 mg per week) is superior to bromazepam (6 mg/day), especially in patients with a high degree of somatic anxiety. 3. In the second study the tolerance of fluspirilene (1.5 mg per week) was investigated in 1261 patients with anxiety states and psychoreactive disorders under controlled and open conditions for a period of six weeks. Side effects were found in 11.5% of the patients. All side effects had in common that they occurred already within the first few weeks of treatment. 4. In the third study investigating the dose-effect relationship 106 patients received either 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mg fluspirilene per week for a period of 6 weeks. The main result of this study was the verification of a clear dose-effect relationship. 5. The fourth study compared 155 patients who had received long-term treatment with fluspirilene (max 1.5 mg/week) and 121 patients with long-term benzodiazepine treatment. No differences were found with regard to the frequency and intensity of extra-pyramidal disturbances. 6. The therapeutical relevance of the findings was emphasized in the general discussion.", 
    "59": "The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists such as ondansetron have been shown to have anxiolytic-like activity in a wide range of preclinical tests: in the mouse black: white test, the rat social interaction test, the rat elevated X-maze and the marmoset human threat test. Ondansetron, like other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists appears to have important advantages over existing anxiolytic therapies. Thus, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are not sedative, they do not have addictive liabilities, there are no problems of withdrawing from chronic treatment and they can be used following benzodiazepine withdrawal. Such compounds even inhibit the behavioural syndrome associated with withdrawal from drugs of abuse, nicotine, alcohol, cocaine, opiates. The preclinical data, therefore, indicates the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists as novel anxiolytics of the future, and there is new clinical work in support of this suggestion.", 
    "60": "Recent aspects of mechanism of benzodiazepines (BDZ) via indirect GABA-mimetic inhibitory effects at brain-specific BDZ-GABA receptors may contribute to an understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms of anxiety disorders and drug dependencies. The development of various BDZ receptor ligands with diverse psychopharmacological properties may lead to safer drugs with regard to \"drug seeking\" and \"maintaining\" properties. This paper reviews recent research of BDZ receptor pharmacology and clinical aspects of abstinence syndromes including also prospective studies.", 
    "61": "Despite an increased understanding of the potential dangers of benzodiazepines among doctors and patients, and a decline in anxiolytic prescribing, motivating and supporting current benzodiazepine users through withdrawal can be difficult and time consuming for medical services. Self-help organisations offer another approach. This is a study of one such organisation, TRANX (UK), which examined the characteristics of its members and their outcome. The results suggest that this organisation did provide effective counselling and support for its members, and implies that self-help is a realistic alternative or adjunct to orthodox health care for those wishing to withdraw from benzodiazepines.", 
    "62": "The case is described of a patient with atypical affective disorder, episodic behavioural dyscontrol and parkinsonism resulting from presumed encephalitis lethargica. EEG abnormalities were found which were compatible with a post-encephalitic state and suggestive of epileptiform complications. Poor or deleterious response to neuroleptics, sleep disorder, and parkinsonism are features that may allow recognition of this illness in a psychiatric setting.", 
    "63": "The pineal gland and melatonin exert a major influence in the control of brain electrical activity and have been shown to be involved in seizure and sleep mechanisms. Since pinealectomy has been reported to result in seizures in experimental animals, it is assumed that melatonin has anticonvulsant properties. Indeed, limited studies in humans with temporal lobe epilepsy indicate that melatonin attenuates seizure activity. In the present communication we present evidence, based on magnetoencephalographic (MEG) brain measurements, that melatonin may exert proconvulsive activity in humans as well. The proconvulsive properties of melatonin may explain several phenomena associated with epilepsy such as the increased occurrence of seizures at night when melatonin plasma levels are 5 to 8-fold higher than during the day and the observed exacerbation of seizures premenstrually and during pregnancy as well as the attenuation of seizures in the menopause. Furthermore, our findings suggest that anticonvulsants which decrease melatonin secretion, such as the benzodiazepines, may exert their antiepileptic activity by attenuating nocturnal melatonin secretion. Finally, we propose that patients with nocturnal epilepsy or those experiencing exacerbation of seizures premenstrually may benefit from the administration of agents which block the secretion or action of melatonin.", 
    "64": "Ultrastructural investigations of different parts of rat brain after diazepam administration revealed benzodiazepine receptors on the neuronal surface and plasma membrane of astrocytes of the sensorimotor cortex, hippocampus and central grey substance. Subsuperficial cisternae that replenish deficit of plasma membrane required for coated vesicles formation were only seen in the neurons and were absent from the astrocytes. The fate of internalized diazepam in the nerve and glial cells were different: in the neurons, ligand is destroyed in lysosomes and multivesicular bodies, while in the astrocytes, exceptionally in lysosomes.", 
    "65": "In the present work, evidence is presented for the involvement of inferior colliculus in the generation and elaboration of aversive responses which suggests that this structure may be part of a brain system that commands aversive states. Electrical stimulation of the inferior colliculus of rats placed inside an open field allowed the determination of thresholds for the escape response. Afterward these rats were placed inside a shuttle box and submitted to a switch-off paradigm. Electrical stimulation of the inferior colliculus was applied at a current intensity 5% below the escape threshold. This electrical stimulation showed clear aversive properties: the rats quickly learned to interrupt it. Systemic administration (3 and 5.6 mg/kg) as well as inferior colliculus microinjections (10 and 20 nmol) of the anxiolytic compound midazolam caused dose-dependent increases in the latency and reductions in the frequency of switch-off responses to the inferior colliculus electrical stimulation. Similar results were obtained following microinjections into this brainstem structure of the GABA-A agonist muscimol (0.1 and 0.5 nmol). These results suggest that neural substrates commanding defensive behavior in the inferior colliculus may be depressed by benzodiazepines as part of the anxiolytic action of these compounds. This antiaversive action may be produced by the enhancement of GABA-A mechanisms.", 
    "66": "The cold-stimulated thyrotropin (TSH) levels in the rat were decreased by clonazepam (a central type benzodiazepine agonist), diazepam (a mixed agonist), FG 7142 (an inverse central type agonist) and Ro 5-4864 (a peripheral type agonist), clonazepam being the most potent and Ro 5-4864 the least active. Clonazepam and diazepam also decreased while FG 7142 increased prolactin (PRL) levels. Ro 5-4864 did not have any significant action. Clonazepam (1 and 5 mg/kg) and diazepam (15 mg/kg but not 25 mg/kg) decreased even the TRH-induced PRL levels. Only Ro 5-4864 (25 mg/kg) decreased TRH-induced TSH secretion but not significantly. The actions of central type compounds were antagonized by flumazenil but not by PK 11195. The weak effects of Ro 5-4864 were not antagonized by either antagonists. While the peripheral type benzodiazepine agonist only weakly affected the secretion of anterior pituitary hormones, the central type inhibition of TSH appears to be mediated through the hypothalamic TRH and that of PRL rather through the anterior pituitary gland. The sedating (or agitating in case of FG 7142) effect of high doses of benzodiazepine ligands may contribute to the changes in TSH and PRL levels.", 
    "67": "The contractile activity of and binding sites for endothelin-1 (ET-1) were investigated in isolated guinea-pig ileal longitudinal smooth muscle (GPILM). ET-1 produced concentration-dependent contractions of GPILM that either slowly subsided in the continued presence of ET-1 or rapidly subsided following washing of the tissue. The ED50 value for ET-1 contractions was 4.2 +/- 1.3 x 10(-9) M. The removal of extracellular calcium or pretreatment with nifedipine produced a complete inhibition of the contractions to ET-1. The IC50 value of nifedipine for inhibition of ET-1 mediated contractions was 3.0 +/- 0.8 x 10(-8) M. ET-1 produced a marked prolonged homologous desensitization of its contractile response but did not affect the responses mediated by carbachol, histamine, serotonin, substance P, and PLA2. High-affinity binding sites for 125I-labelled ET-1 were identified on microsomal membranes prepared from GPILM with Kd and Bmax values obtained by Scatchard analysis of 3.5 +/- 0.6 x 10(-10) M and 2138 +/- 159 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The binding of 125I-labelled ET-1 to GPILM microsomes was characterized by a rapid association (kob value of 0.077 min-1 at a radioligand concentration of 0.45 nM and an extremely slow dissociation (k1 value of 0.011 min-1; t1/2 value of 793 min). The binding was unaffected by the calcium channel antagonists nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem (10(-6) M); the receptor antagonists phenoxybenzamine, atropine, and naloxone (10(-6) M) and propranolol; and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor antagonists Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195 and psychotomimetic drug phencyclidine (10(-5) M).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "68": "The role of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine acceptor is unclear. It has been suggested that the acceptor ligands, Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195, stimulate mitochondrial respiration by binding to the peripheral-type benzodiazepine acceptor. We determined the effect of the benzodiazepine Ro 5-4864 and of the isoquinoline carboxamide PK 11195 on the respiration rates of liver, kidney and adrenal mitochondria during coupled, uncoupled and phosphorylating respiration. These ligands inhibited uncoupled and phosphorylating respiration, but only at concentrations substantially greater than their KD values for binding to the acceptor. There was a slight stimulation of coupled respiration by these ligands at concentrations similar to their KD values for the acceptor, but this stimulation was markedly greater at higher concentrations. These results suggest that the ligands Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195 affect respiration in a non-specific way, independently of binding to the acceptor. There was no correlation between the effect of these ligands on respiration and the density of the acceptor in mitochondria from liver, kidney and adrenals. We suggest that the earlier reported alteration of respiration by these ligands was due to non-specific effects and was not mediated by the peripheral-type benzodiazepine acceptor.", 
    "69": "It realize a overall and evolutionarily (6 months periods) study concerning the 1,313 drug dependents that were admitted to the Detoxication Unit of the Hospital Psiqui\u00e1trico de Madrid, since October 1985 to March 1990. The sociodemographic, drug dependence history, the Physical and toxicological state at admittance, the inpatient evolution, and the familiar and personal psychopathological history variables were evaluated. It bring out that the 45% are dependents to another drug apart from the heroin, the gradual increase in the mean age and in the use of the cocaine, a decrease in the use of the cannabis, anyway the appearance of the buprenorphine addition. There is a gradual decrease, in the period studied, of the antibodies HIV carrier rates. It shows that there is a relationship between this. The poly drug dependents have more legal incidences, psychopathological personal histories (heroin and alcohol and/or benzodiazepines addiction), use more the i.v. route and the HIV seroprevalence are the greatest.", 
    "70": "This investigation sought to characterize the interaction between benzodiazepine and cholinergic systems in place learning in the Morris water maze. In the first experiment, rats were treated with scopolamine (1 mg/kg) alone or concomitantly with one of two doses of flumazenil (15 and 30 mg/kg) or with chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) alone or concomitantly with flumazenil (15 mg/kg). Chlordiazepoxide and scopolamine severely impaired place learning but not cue learning. The low dose of flumazenil completely reversed the impairment produced by chlordiazepoxide and both high and low doses of flumazenil attenuated the place learning deficit produced by scopolamine. Neither dose of flumazenil affected place learning when administered alone. In the second experiment, rats were administered chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) or scopolamine (1 mg/kg) alone or concomitantly with one of four doses of physostigmine (0.05, 0.10, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg). Once again, both chlordiazepoxide and scopolamine impaired place but not cue learning. Physostigmine reversed the impairment produced by scopolamine in a dose-dependent manner but failed at every dose to attenuate the impairment produced by chlordiazepoxide. The higher doses of physostigmine impaired place learning when administered alone. None of the drug treatments impaired cue learning. Together, these results suggest that the scopolamine-induced impairment of place learning is due to an increase in benzodiazepine/GABA activity, and contradict the notion that benzodiazepines impair memory by cholinergic mechanisms.", 
    "71": "Several lines of evidence suggest that the transient subplate zone of the embryonic mammalian telencephalon could influence cortical development through synaptic or trophic interactions with growing cortical afferents and migrating neurons. Since such interactions may involve neurotransmitters and their receptor molecules, we have examined the expression of GABA and subunits of the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex in the occipital lobe of embryonic rhesus monkeys by immunochemistry and in situ hybridization. We found that during the second half of gestation, when the subplate zone reaches peak maturity in this species, many neurons can be immunolabeled with both GABA antisera and monoclonal antibodies against GABAA receptor subunits. The most robust labeling occurs at approximately embryonic day (E)125 (birth is at E165). Electron microscopic observations of receptor subunit-immunolabeled material confirmed that subunits of the GABAA receptor are localized in the subplate neurons and their dendritic processes. In many instances the reaction product is associated with the plasma membranes of labeled processes, some of which form symmetrical synapses with small unlabeled axon terminals. The results of in situ hybridization are in accord with the results of receptor subunit immunochemistry. From E80 to E141, hybridization signal for GABAA receptor subunit mRNA occurs in the subplate zone and increases steadily to peak levels between E125 and E141. The present results reveal that all the elements necessary for the formation of functional GABAergic synaptic circuitry are present in the subplate zone. Further, the ages showing the most pronounced receptor and transmitter expression in this primate coincide with the ingrowth of major cortical afferent systems. Taken together, these findings suggest that GABAergic local neuronal circuits in the subplate may be involved in the development of long tract connections stationed in this zone prior to their transfer to the overlying cortical plate.", 
    "72": "The distribution of the beta 1 (beta 1) and beta 2 (beta 2) subtypes of the beta-adrenergic receptor was examined in rat and nondiseased control human tissue. The distribution of the beta 1 and beta 2 receptors was also examined in schizophrenic cases, with additional studies in schizophrenic suicide and nonschizophrenic suicide cases. Scatchard analysis of the binding of [125I]iodopindolol (IPIN) to cortical membranes showed a similar Kd in human (177 pM) and rat (161 pM), but a lower maximum binding site (Bmax) in the human tissue (18.7 fmol/mg protein and 55.6 fmol/mg protein). For the autoradiographic studies [125I]IPIN was used to visualize both subtypes (total) or was displaced with the selective beta 1-receptor antagonist ICI-89,406 to visualize beta 2 sites, or with the selective beta 2-receptor antagonist ICI-118,551 to visualize beta 1 sites. Important differences in the regional distribution of the two subtypes of the beta-adrenergic receptors were noted between rat and human. In the nucleus accumbens and ventral putamen (ventral striatum), a patchy distribution of beta 1 receptors was observed that was not evident in the rat. These patches were aligned with markers of the matrix compartment of the striatum. The schizophrenic cases showed significant increases in the labeling of the beta 1-receptor patches with [125I]IPIN. In contrast to the frontal cortex of the nondisease controls, the parietal and temporal cortex showed a high ratio of beta 1 to beta 2 receptors and a highly laminar organization of the subtypes. [125I]IPIN binding to beta 1 receptors was highest in the external laminae with the reverse gradient for the beta 2 subtype. The medial temporal cortex displayed an alteration in the ratio of the 2 subtypes of the beta-adrenergic receptor, with the parahippocampus and hippocampus of the human, in contrast to the rat brain, predominantly expressing the beta 2 receptor. Moreover, there were consistently higher densities of beta 2 receptors in the hippocampus of the right hemisphere than the left hemisphere of the nondisease controls. There was not a left and right hemispheric asymmetry of beta 2 receptors in the hippocampus of elderly schizophrenics or in young schizophrenics who committed suicide. The asymmetry was evident in nonschizophrenic suicides, suggesting that the lack of asymmetry in the hippocampus of schizophrenics is evident early in the disease process. Thus limbic structures show alterations in the patterning of beta 1 and beta 2 receptors in the schizophrenic cases.", 
    "73": "The regional distribution of binding sites on the GABAA receptor and their kinetic parameters were measured by quantitative autoradiography in brains from normal rats and rats with a portacaval shunt, a model of portal systemic encephalopathy in which GABA neurotransmission may be altered. The ligands used were [3H]flunitrazepam (a benzodiazepine-site agonist), [3H]-Ro15-1788 (a benzodiazepine-site antagonist), [3H]muscimol (a GABA-site agonist), and [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (35S-TBPS, a convulsant that binds to a site near the chloride channel). Some brains were analyzed by computerized image analysis and three-dimensional reconstruction. The regional distribution of binding of the benzodiazepines was very similar, but the patterns obtained with [3H]muscimol and [35S]TBPS were different in many areas, suggesting a heterogeneous distribution of several subtypes of the GABAA receptor. The kinetic parameters were determined in brain regions for [3H]flunitrazepam, [3H]Ro15-1788, and [3H]muscimol. For each ligand, the Kd showed a significant heterogeneity among brain regions (at least threefold), contrary to conclusions drawn from earlier studies. In portacaval shunted rats, binding of all four ligands was essentially unchanged from that in control rats, indicating that, if there was an abnormality in GABA neurotransmission during portal systemic shunting, it was not reflected by altered binding to the main sites on the GABAA receptor.", 
    "74": "This study examined in baboons various behavioral effects of zolpidem, a short-acting imidazopyridine hypnotic which has selectivity for subtypes of the benzodiazepine receptor. Intravenous drug self-injection was studied under a fixed-ratio 80- or 160-response schedule with a 3-hr timeout after each injection. Maximal rates of self-injection maintained by zolpidem (0.01-1 mg/kg) were consistently higher than those maintained by vehicle and the benzodiazepine hypnotic triazolam. Substitution of vehicle after about 2 weeks of zolpidem self-injection (7-8 mg/kg/day) resulted in a time-limited suppression of food pellet intake, indicating a drug withdrawal effect. In a drug discrimination study, baboons were trained to discriminate either lorazepam (1.8 mg/kg p.o.) or pentobarbital (10 mg/kg p.o.) from the no-drug condition. Zolpidem (0.1-18 mg/kg p.o.) occasioned both lorazepam- and pentobarbital-appropriate responding (greater than 80%) in a dose-dependent manner. In a final experiment, zolpidem (3.2 or 5.6 mg/kg i.m.) produced ataxia and sedation that progressively decreased over 7 consecutive days of administration. The withdrawal, discriminative stimulus effects and tolerance shown with zolpidem were similar to those shown previously with benzodiazepines under similar conditions. The rates of self-injection of zolpidem were similar to those maintained by intermediate duration barbiturates (e.g., pentobarbital) and higher than those maintained by 11 benzodiazepines studied previously under similar conditions. Further research on the reinforcing effects of zolpidem may provide useful insights into mechanisms underlying the maintenance of behavior by compounds acting through the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "75": "The effects of benzodiazepine withdrawal on intestinal motor activity and propulsion were investigated in two groups of diazepam-dependent rats (15 mg/kg/day for 8 days). Withdrawal was precipitated by injection of two benzodiazepine antagonists (Ro 15.1788 and PK 11.95) acting on central and peripheral-type receptors, respectively. Intestinal motor activity was assessed by implanting electrodes for long-term electromyographic recordings. Gastrointestinal transit was evaluated after gavage by a marker (51CrO4Na2) and radioactivity counting. Both RO 15.1788 (15 mg/kg) and PK 11.195 (5 mg/kg) triggered an abstinence syndrome with behavioral and autonomic signs. At the intestinal level, Ro 15.1788 induced a phase of strong irregular spiking activity (173 +/- 63 min) which remained located in the duodenum. In contrast, PK 11.195 induced a period of propagated myoelectric complexes characterized by phases II and III of high amplitude. The cecal frequency was doubled during the 1st hr after withdrawal induced by the two antagonists. Both Ro 15.1788 and PK 11.195 at this dosage had no effect per se on intestinal motility in vehicle-treated rats. In the second group of rats, gastric emptying was enhanced by 49.4 and 45.6% by Ro 15.1788 and PK 11.195, respectively. In contrast, PK 11.195 was able to accelerate the intestinal transit more than did Ro 15.1788 (geometric center, 5.9 +/- 0.43 and 5.3 +/- 0.49, respectively, vs. 4.1 +/- 0.31 in control rats). Our study shows that precipitated benzodiazepine withdrawal in diazepam-dependent rats induces alterations of the intestinal myoelectrical activity leading to an increase of the gastrointestinal transit. Central and peripheral-type receptors are involved in these effects.", 
    "76": "In an effort to determine subunit compositions of in vivo GABAA receptors, the cellular localization of 13 subunit encoding mRNAs (alpha 1-alpha 6, beta 1-beta 3, gamma 2-gamma 3, delta) was determined in the rat olfactory bulb and cerebellum. Cerebellar granule cells expressed significant quantities of alpha 1, alpha 6, beta 2, beta 3, gamma 2, and delta mRNAs. They contained very much lower levels of alpha 4, beta 1, and gamma 3 mRNAs, and the alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, and gamma 1 genes appeared to be silent. Purkinje cells contained only the alpha 1, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 mRNAs. Putative Bergmann glial cells were found to contain the gamma 1 mRNA and possibly the alpha 2 mRNA. In the molecular layer, only the alpha 1, beta 2 and gamma 2 mRNAs were expressed in stellate/basket cells. The alpha 3 probe hybridized weakly to targets in the molecular layer. The inferior olivary nucleus contained significant quantities of alpha 2, alpha 4, and gamma 1 transcripts, with the alpha 1, alpha 3, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 mRNAs also present. In the olfactory bulb, mitral cells were found to express the alpha 1, beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 mRNAs strongly and the alpha 3 mRNA weakly. Tufted cells contained alpha 1, alpha 3, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 mRNAs and, occasionally, the alpha 2 mRNA. In the internal granule cells the alpha 2, alpha 4, alpha 5, beta 3, and delta mRNAs were all present. Low levels of alpha 3, gamma 1, gamma 2, and gamma 3 mRNAs were also noted in these cells. Periglomerular cells expressed low levels of alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 4, beta 2, beta 3, gamma 1, gamma 2, and gamma 3 mRNAs. No alpha 6 mRNA was present in the olfactory bulb. Correlations that are general ones from other brain regions are the colocalizations of alpha 1 beta 2, alpha 2 beta 3, and alpha 4 delta mRNAs. In both the olfactory bulb and cerebellum, alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 receptor cores are probably employed. The delta-subunit mRNA appears to codistribute with alpha-subunit mRNAs (alpha 4 and alpha 6) associated with GABAA subunits that fail to bind benzodiazepine agonists.", 
    "77": "The expression patterns of 13 GABAA receptor subunit encoding genes (alpha 1-alpha 6, beta 1-beta 3, gamma 1-gamma 3, delta) were determined in adult rat brain by in situ hybridization. Each mRNA displayed a unique distribution, ranging from ubiquitous (alpha 1 mRNA) to narrowly confined (alpha 6 mRNA was present only in cerebellar granule cells). Some neuronal populations coexpressed large numbers of subunit mRNAs, whereas in others only a few GABAA receptor-specific mRNAs were found. Neocortex, hippocampus, and caudate-putamen displayed complex expression patterns, and these areas probably contain a large diversity of GABAA receptors. In many areas, a consistent coexpression was observed for alpha 1 and beta 2 mRNAs, which often colocalized with gamma 2 mRNA. The alpha 1 beta 2 combination was abundant in olfactory bulb, globus pallidus, inferior colliculus, substantia nigra pars reticulata, globus pallidus, zona incerta, subthalamic nucleus, medial septum, and cerebellum. Colocalization was also apparent for the alpha 2 and beta 3 mRNAs, and these predominated in areas such as amygdala and hypothalamus. The alpha 3 mRNA occurred in layers V and VI of neocortex and in the reticular thalamic nucleus. In much of the forebrain, with the exception of hippocampal pyramidal cells, the alpha 4 and delta transcripts appeared to codistribute. In thalamic nuclei, the only abundant GABAA receptor mRNAs were those of alpha 1, alpha 4, beta 2, and delta. In the medial geniculate thalamic nucleus, alpha 1, alpha 4, beta 2, delta, and gamma 3 mRNAs were the principal GABAA receptor transcripts. The alpha 5 and beta 1 mRNAs generally colocalized and may encode predominantly hippocampal forms of the GABAA receptor. These anatomical observations support the hypothesis that alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 receptors are responsible for benzodiazepine I (BZ I) binding, whereas receptors containing alpha 2, alpha 3, and alpha 5 contribute to subtypes of the BZ II site. Based on significant mismatches between alpha 4/delta and gamma mRNAs, we suggest that in vivo, the alpha 4 subunit contributes to GABAA receptors that lack BZ modulation.",

Three had been sentenced by court to forfeit their authorization, and 42 had been deprived of the right, or had voluntarily abdicated the right, to prescribe certain drugs (mainly those containing opiates and benzodiazepines).

    "80": "5 alpha-Pregnane-3 alpha,21-diol-20-one (THDOC; 5 mg/kg) and the triazolobenzodiazepine alprazolam (1 mg/kg) attenuated mild stress-induced increases in plasma corticosterone concentrations via GABAergic mechanisms. Unlike alprazolam, THDOC failed to decrease corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) concentrations in the locus ceruleus. While THDOC may plausibly act via endogenous GABAergic mechanisms to reduce stress-induced endocrine and behavioral responses that are likely mediated in part by CRF neurons, these preliminary findings suggest that, at the dose and time point studied, THDOC does not identically mimic the actions of alprazolam, another drug which potentiates GABAergic activity.", 
    "81": "We have shown previously that chronic treatment of mice with a benzodiazepine agonist, flurazepam, increased the pharmacological actions of the partial inverse agonist, FG7142. We have investigated the neurophysiological basis for this using extracellular recordings of evoked field potentials in area CA1 of isolated hippocampal slices. The slices were prepared 48 h after the end of the chronic in vivo treatment, a time when no evidence of residual benzodiazepine agonist activity was found in the CNS. During perfusion with standard Ringer solution, no significant differences were seen between the field potentials in slices from flurazepam-treated mice and those from control animals. When FG7142 was added to the perfusion medium there was an increase in the secondary discharges that followed the initial population spikes, and an increase in paired pulse potentiation. These increases were significantly greater in slices from flurazepam-treated mice, compared with controls. The results show that the effects of the partial inverse agonist, FG7142, on an isolated neuronal preparation, were increased by chronic administration of a benzodiazepine agonist in vivo. This effect is suggested to be due to a decrease in GABAergic inhibition.", 
    "82": "The reverse transcriptases (RTs) from human immunodeficiency viruses types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2, respectively) are relatively highly related yet there are several significant differences in their catalytic activities. In an attempt to relate these functional dissimilarities to the differences in amino acid sequences, we have employed a novel approach of constructing chimeric molecules composed of complementary amino acid sequences derived from the two HIV RTs. These recombinant proteins were analyzed for their enzymatic activities and for their sensitivity to tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]benzodiazepin-2[1H]-one and thione (TIBO), which selectively inhibits only HIV-1 RT. The active chimeric RTs were used to map the TIBO binding site on the HIV-1 RT molecules and to localize the putative sequences responsible for the high RNase H activity of HIV-1 RT relative to that of HIV-2 RT. The results suggest that TIBO interacts with amino acid residues located around residue 200 within the DNA polymerase domain of HIV-1 RT which shows a relatively low similarity to HIV-2 RT. The difference in the RNase H activity maps to a position in the DNA polymerase domain rather than to the RNase H domain. Out of the 12 chimeric RTs generated, four were either fully active or hyperactive, three others lost most of their catalytic activities, and the rest were totally inactive. The pattern of catalytic activities of these hybrid proteins can be explained by a model for the initial folding of HIV RTs, which entails the formation of three distinct and independently folded regions. Each region can be formed by amino acid sequences derived exclusively from either HIV-1 RT or HIV-2 RT.", 
    "83": "Fear is an affective experience and a normal psychobiologic reaction preparing the organism for defense or avoidance of threats. It is only abnormal when extent, expression and duration do not match the real danger. Three processes are elementary components of fear: 1. the perception of a signal for threat, 2. expectation, defined as inner mobilisation and augmented directional attention, 3. feeling arising from impending loss of control over the inner and outer milieu. Mutual dependence and interference between the three processes are often the basis for vicious circles in pathologic states of fear. Various aspects of fear, mainly of the anticipated fear can be explained by conditioned behaviour, a fact of significance not at last for rational psychotherapy. The form of expression and the extent of a reaction to fear is according to the hypothesis of Gray regulated by a complex functional central nervous system. The primary role of the latter consists in an inhibition of the actual behaviour in order to allow for alternative reactions adapted to the new circumstances. Intensity and quality of alarming signals ultimately determining the outcome of the reaction are mediated by neurotransmitters. These assure the correct transmission within the neuronal network and regulate the extent of activation off all neuronal cells. Three neurotransmitters are assumed to have an essential role in fear: norepinephrine, serotonin and gamma-amino-butyric-acid (GABA). The action of GABA has been documented best so far. An increase of inhibitory GABA-effects is also the main mechanism of action of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like anxiolytics.", 
    "84": "Out-patients attending for removal of at least one lower third molar were randomly allocated to treatment with temazepam elixir (n = 7) or intravenous midazolam (n = 8), as well as local analgesia. Patients were tested prior to drug administration and at the end of surgery. Both drugs increased heart rate and midazolam also decreased diastolic blood pressure. The two drugs caused significant, equal increases in ratings of sedation, but the reduction of anxiety was significant only for midazolam. There was significant amnesia for material presented after drug administration, as well as for dental events and this was significantly greater for midazolam. The effects of these drugs in dental patients were compared with those in normal volunteers treated in an identical manner, but without oral surgery. The drugs had similar significant cardiovascular and amnesic effects in the volunteers and the same effects on mood ratings, even though volunteers and patients differed in their pretreatment levels of anxiety and discontent. The dentist's ratings of the sedation and operating conditions were excellent in both cases. Thus temazepam elixir provided a useful sedative for oral surgery, avoiding the complications of intravenous administration. However, for equivalent levels of sedation, midazolam had greater anxiolytic and amnesic effects than temazepam.",

A comparison of freshly packed columns suggested that similar changes also occurred with the dry silica on storage.

The gamma 3 mRNA is present in cortex, claustrum, caudate putamen, and some thalamic nuclei, particularly the medial geniculate nucleus, where it is the predominant gamma-subunit transcript. The gamma 3 gene is expressed at very low levels in cerebellum and hippocampus. In coexpression experiments with the alpha 1 and beta 2 subunits, gamma 3 imparts benzodiazepine binding to gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors and forms gamma-aminobutyric acid-gated benzodiazepine-modulated chloride channels that exhibit a larger conductance than alpha 1 beta 2 receptor channels. Furthermore, the presence of gamma 3 in place of gamma 2 in alpha 1 beta 2 gamma x receptors generates a marked decrease in the affinity of agonists while leaving the affinity of antagonists or negative modulators largely unaffected.", 
    "98": "In the present study we have examined the interaction between the selective cholecystokinin (CCK)A and CCKB receptor antagonists, devazepide and L365-260 on morphine conditioned place preference (CPP). Using an unbiased procedure, morphine (1.5 mg/kg) produced a reliable CPP which was observed irrespective of the conditioning compartment type. Pretreatment with devazepide (0.001-0.01 mg/kg s.c.) produced a dose related attenuation of this response. At higher doses (0.1-1 mg/kg) this antagonism became variable and dependent on the training compartment with blockade only observed when conditioning was to the white/rough textured environment. This profile has also been reported for the serotonin (5-HT)3 receptor antagonist ondansetron. The CCKB antagonist L365-260 (0.000001-0.01 mg/kg) failed to antagonize the morphine CPP, if anything a mild potentiation was observed. To study this further we examined the interaction between L365-260 (0.01 mg/kg) and a subthreshold dose of morphine (0.3 mg/kg). At these doses neither drug elicited CPP, however when co-administered a significant CPP was recorded. Finally, L365-260 at 1 mg/kg induced a mild but significant CPP when administered alone. These results suggest a differential role of CCK receptor subtypes on reward-related behaviour and complement previous studies suggesting bimodal effects of CCK systems on mesolimbic dopamine function.",

Administration of testosterone acetate (TA) prevented castration-induced PBR depletion. Orchiectomy per se, as well as TA administration to castrated rats, had no effect on central or peripheral BZ receptors in whole brain without the cerebellum.

The sorbents all contain the same loading of BSA (14.4 +/- 0.1%, w/w) and differ only with respect to the cross-linker used for immobilization. Despite their apparent similarity, the sorbents show very different chromatographic properties, not only with respect to retention of analyte enantiomers (k' and alpha), but also with respect to column efficiency (affecting Rs values). The data obtained indicate that the chemical structure of the cross-linking reagent affects to a large extent the accessibility of important chiral binding sites.

    "103": "Studies were made on the potentiation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding to rat brain membranes by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), pentobarbitone and pregnanolone (5 beta-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one). Epipregnanolone, the 3 beta isomer of pregnanolone, inhibited competitively the potentiation by pregnanolone with a Ki of 10.5 microM without affecting that of GABA. The potentiation by pentobarbitone was slightly enhanced. Epipregnanolone alone showed only slight potentiation of benzodiazepine binding. These findings demonstrate that epipregnanolone is a specific antagonist of the neurosteroid site of the GABAA receptor and raise the possibility of a physiological role for 3 beta-hydroxysteroids in modulating this receptor.", 
    "104": "Effects of the 5-HT3 antagonist ICS 205-930 on chlordiazepoxide (CDP) withdrawal were assessed in rats treated for 21 days with doses of CDP up to 40mg/kg/day (b.i.d.). Withdrawal signs recorded were body weight and 24h food intake, which both fell during withdrawal and then recovered. ICS 205-930 (0.001-1.0mg/kg) was administered b.i.d. during withdrawal. At no dose over the wide range tested did ICS 205-930 reduce withdrawal signs. These data contrast with published findings with the 5-HT3 antagonist ondanestron, some of which indicated that ondansetron completely alleviated the \"anxiogenic\" suppression of exploratory behaviour observed during benzodiazepine (BZ) withdrawal. Possible reasons for these differing findings are discussed. Collectively, these findings suggest that 5-HT3 antagonists may have limited utility in the clinical treatment of BZ withdrawal.", 
    "105": "Vestibular rehabilitation is a specific approach to physical therapy aimed at reducing dizziness and imbalance by facilitating central nervous system compensation for peripheral vestibular dysfunction. This article reports preliminary results of studies concerning the relative effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation, general conditioning exercises, and vestibular suppressant medication on dizziness and imbalance in patients with chronic vestibular symptoms of at least 6 months duration. Patients with positional and/or movement-related dizziness and abnormal posturography were randomly assigned to the three treatment groups. Preliminary results suggest that although all three treatment approaches reduce dizziness, only vestibular rehabilitation also improves balance. This study takes the first step toward determining the efficacy of a specific exercise approach for reducing dizziness and imbalance in patients with chronic peripheral vestibular disorders."
