    "1": "Within the Leiden 85-plus Study, a prospective population based study of 599 subjects aged 85 years at baseline, we assessed benzodiazepine use, depressive symptoms, and cognitive function annually during a 5-year follow-up period.", 
    "2": "Benzodiazepine users were more likely to be female, be institutionalized, and have a low education. Benzodiazepine users scored 0.76 points higher on the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale than non-users (95% CI: 0.27-1.25, p = 0.002). They were 1.6-fold more likely to develop new depressive symptoms in 1 year when compared to non-users (95% CI: 1.05-2.55, p = 0.028). Benzodiazepine use did not associate with cognitive function, but discontinued benzodiazepine users had a 4.0 points lower Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score in the year before discontinuation than continued benzodiazepine users (95% CI: 1.31-6.73, p = 0.004).",

    "6": "The in vitro profile was determined using radioligand binding and electrophysiological assays for the GABAA alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, and alpha5 receptors. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was performed in mouse hippocampal slices. Cognitive effects were assessed in rats in the delayed match to position (DMTP) task and the Morris water maze. In monkeys, the object retrieval task was used. Pro-convulsant and anxiogenic potentials were evaluated in mice and rats. In vivo receptor occupancy was determined using [3H]-RO0154513.", 
    "7": "RO4938581 is a potent inverse agonist at the GABAA alpha5 receptor, with both binding and functional selectivity, enhancing hippocampal LTP. RO4938581 reversed scopolamine-induced working memory impairment in the DMTP task (0.3-1 mg/kg p.o.) and diazepam-induced spatial learning impairment (1-10 mg/kg p.o.). RO4938581 improved executive function in monkeys (3-10 mg/kg p.o.). Importantly, RO4938581 showed no anxiogenic and pro-convulsive potential. RO4938581 dose-dependently bound to GABAA alpha5 receptors and approximately 30% receptor occupancy was sufficient to produce enhanced cognition in the rat.",

They constitute the most difficult to treat population in MMT centers as they present extremely difficult and negative behaviors as well as medical problems. Medical hypnosis is a proven effective medical intervention to alleviate pain, lessen anxieties, as well as being partially effective in treating nicotine addiction. One of its advantages is the ability to bypass the critical conscious drug addict's reluctance to the treatment process.",

    "18": "The true incidence of seizures caused by general anesthetic drugs is unknown. Abnormal movements are common during induction of anesthesia, but they may not be indicative of true seizures. Conversely, epileptiform electrocortical activity is commonly induced by enflurane, etomidate, sevoflurane and, to a lesser extent, propofol, but it rarely progresses to generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Even \"nonconvulsant\" anesthetic drugs occasionally cause seizures in subjects with preexisting epilepsy. These seizures most commonly occur during induction or emergence from anesthesia, when the anesthetic drug concentration is relatively low. There is no unifying neural mechanism of anesthetic drug-related seizurogenesis. However, there is a growing body of experimental work suggesting that seizures are not caused simply by \"too much excitation,\" but rather by excitation applied to a mass of neurons which are primed to react to the excitation by going into an oscillatory seizure state. Increased gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibition can sensitize the cortex so that only a small amount of excitation is required to cause seizures. This has been postulated to occur 1) at the network level by increasing the propensity for reverberation (e.g., by prolongation of the \"inhibitory lag\"), or 2) via different effects on subpopulations of interneurons (\"inhibiting-the-inhibitors\") or 3) at the synaptic level by changing the chloride reversal potential (\"excitatory GABA\"). On the basis of applied neuropharmacology, prevention of anesthetic-drug related seizures would include 1) avoiding sevoflurane and etomidate, 2) considering prophylaxis with adjunctive benzodiazepines (alpha-subunit GABA(A) agonists), or drugs that impair calcium entry into neurons, and 3) using electroencephalogram monitoring to detect early signs of cortical instability and epileptiform activity. Seizures may falsely elevate electroencephalogram indices of depth of anesthesia.", 
    "19": "Previous published work with the novel anticonvulsant, analgesic and anti-anxiety medication, pregabalin (Lyrica), has shown that it has anxiolytic-like actions in several animal behavioral models. However, pregabalin is structurally and pharmacologically different from other classes of known anxiolytic drugs, and the mechanisms that alter brain activity to produce anxiolytic-like actions are not well understood. In an effort to determine more about the cellular mechanisms of pregabalin, we studied its effects on hippocampal theta activity of urethane-anesthetized rats that was elicited by electrical stimulation of the nucleus pontis oralis (nPO) in the brainstem. We found that systemic administration of pregabalin significantly reduced the frequency of stimulation-induced hippocampal theta activity similarly to the effects of diazepam. In addition, pregabalin (but not diazepam) significantly altered the stimulus intensity/frequency relationship, and increased slow delta oscillation (<3.0Hz) in spontaneous hippocampal EEG in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that pregabalin may alter evoked theta frequency activity in the hippocampus by reducing neurotransmitter-mediated activation of either the septal nucleus or the hippocampus, and that its actions are unlikely to be mediated by direct activation of GABA neurotransmitter systems. These observations provide further insight to the action of pregabalin, and support the utilization of stimulation-induced theta model in discovery of novel anxiolytic drugs.",

The underlying mechanism, however, is poorly understood. Adiponectin is a recently identified adipocyte-derived protein, with low adiponectin levels being associated with metabolic abnormalities such as obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.", 
    "21": "Fasting adiponectin levels were assessed in a cross-sectional sample of 386 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. All patients were on monotherapy of second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) and underwent an extensive metabolic screening including an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).", 
    "22": "Adiponectin plasma levels were inversely correlated with BMI, and differed significantly between patients with normal weight, overweight or obesity (p<0.05). Patients who met criteria for the metabolic syndrome, according to adapted National Cholesterol Educational Program - Adult Treatment Panel criteria (NCEP-ATP III) (29.3%), had significantly lower adiponectin levels than patients not meeting metabolic syndrome criteria (p<0.0001). Patients without glucose abnormalities (78%) had significantly higher adiponectin levels than patients with diabetes (5.7%) (p<0.05). After controlling for components of metabolic syndrome and sex, antipsychotic medication independently influenced adiponectin levels (p<0.0001), with the lowest mean levels in patients on clozapine and olanzapine.", 
    "23": "Adiponectin levels in schizophrenic patients mirror what is observed in the general population, with the lowest levels in the most metabolically comprised subjects. However, antipsychotic medication may also influence adiponectin regulation independently, a finding that should be confirmed in longitudinal studies.",

    "25": "Morphological variables were measured in three treatment groups (haloperidol=18; risperidone=16; olanzapine=18) and in healthy subjects (N=38) at baseline and after one year. The relationship between brain morphometric changes and changes in clinical scores was also assessed.", 
    "26": "At one year, the three antipsychotics had had an equal effect on the gray matter cortical structure, overall and lobes (all p's>0.121.). A significant time-by-group interaction was found in lateral ventricle volume (F2,47=5.65; p=0.006). Post-hoc comparisons revealed a significant increase in lateral ventricles in patients treated with risperidone (p=0.009). Patients exposed to atypicals (olanzapine and risperidone) exhibited a decrease in caudate nucleus volume (p=0.001). In general, brain changes did not account in any significant manner for clinical changes over time in any treatment group.", 
    "27": "We conclude that low doses of haloperidol, risperidone and olanzapine seem to have an equal effect on the gray matter cortical structure after 1 year of treatment. In contrast to typical antipsychotics, atypicals have differential effects on lateral ventricle and caudate nucleus volumes.", 
    "28": "Suicidal ideation and attempts are common reasons for visits to the emergency department and critical care hospitalizations and a common public health problem. Most patients who make a suicide attempt have a psychiatric disorder, most frequently a mood, psychotic, substance use, or personality disorder. Patients who are at high risk of another attempt and cannot be transferred promptly to a psychiatric service should be managed jointly by the psychiatric and critical care teams with an emphasis on protection of the patient, identification of substance intoxication and withdrawal, making the environment safe, and instituting treatment of the psychiatric disorder. Antidepressants reduce suicide risk but their slow onset of action may make electroconvulsive therapy a desirable alternative for severely depressed patients. Parenteral treatment is possible with benzodiazepines and antipsychotic drugs but not antidepressants.", 
    "29": "Substance use is common among individuals admitted to the critical care setting and may complicate treatment of underlying disorders. It is imperative for the critical care team to have a high index of suspicion for substance intoxication and withdrawal. This article reviews the epidemiology of substance use in this population and the treatment of common withdrawal syndromes. General principles regarding the management of substance withdrawal syndromes include general resuscitative measures, use of a symptom-triggered approach, and substitution of a long-acting replacement for the abused drug in gradual tapering dose. The authors stress the importance of long-term planning as part of the overall treatment protocol beyond the acute presentation.", 
    "30": "1-(2-Chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide (PK11195) is a proven enhancer of apoptotic cell death in a variety of cellular models. This effect is independent of its established cellular target, the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (mBzR), since it is able to promote cell death also in mBzR knockout cells. Thus recently it was suggested that PK11195 might exert its effect by modulating the expression and function of the oncogene Bcl-2. We have previously demonstrated that Bcl-2 modulates cellular Ca2+ homeostasis as its overexpression reduces the Ca2+ concentration in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ([Ca2+](er)), impairing mitochondrial and cytosolic Ca2+ overload during cellular stress and therefore inhibiting the induction of the apoptotic cascade. Here, using ER, mitochondria and cytosolic targeted aequorin probes, we show that cellular treatment with PK11195 induces opposite changes in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis, increasing the [Ca2+](er) and amplifying IP(3) induced Ca2+ transients in mitochondria ([Ca2+](m)) and cytosol ([Ca2+](c)). This work provides evidence for a novel pharmacological effect of PK11195 on Ca2+ signalling which may be linked to its effect on Bcl-2 and account for its role in apoptotic cell death.",

As the United States population continues to age, the prevalence of AD will rise. Accordingly, oral health care providers will be more likely to treat patients affected by this disease; therefore, it is necessary to understand the pharmacologic agents used for the management of AD.

Standardized ratings of tic symptoms, disruptive behaviors, and aggression were obtained, along with adverse events and safety data.", 
    "38": "Over the 6-week trial, olanzapine administration was associated with a significant decrease in total tic severity as measured by the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (30% reduction by week 6; effect size 0.49). A significant majority of subjects were rated as \"much improved\" or \"very much improved\" on the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale (GCI-I) by both clinicians (67%; 8/12) and parents (64%; 7/11). Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms showed significant improvements from baseline for both inattention (33% decrease) and hyperactive/impulsivity (50% decrease) scores (effect sizes 0.44 and 0.43, respectively). Aggression was also decreased as assessed by fewer numbers of aggressive episodes on the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS). Little change in anxiety symptoms was noted. The most widely reported side effects were drowsiness/sedation and weight gain; adverse events were generally well tolerated. Mean weight gain of 4.1 +/- 2.0 kg was observed over the 6-week trial, a mean percent change of 8.4 +/- 4.4 (p < 0.001).",

    "40": "Neuropathic pain is commonly associated with affective disorders such as anxiety and depression. We have previously characterised a rodent model of HIV, anti-retroviral-associated neuropathy in which rats develop hypersensitivity to a punctate mechanical stimulus and display anxiety-like behaviour in the open field paradigm. To assess the potential of this behavioural paradigm for the assessment of pain related co-morbidities in rodent models of pain, here we test the sensitivity of this anxiety-like behaviour to the analgesic agents gabapentin and morphine in comparison to the known anxiolytic drug diazepam. We found that gabapentin (30 mg/kg, i.p.) and morphine (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.), which reduce mechanical hypersensitivity in these rats, significantly reduces measures of thigmotaxis in the open field. The effect of gabapentin and morphine did not differ significantly from diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.). This study highlights the potential use of this rodent model and behavioural paradigm in the validation of the affective component of novel analgesic pharmacological targets and elucidation of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.", 
    "41": "Alleged sexual assault cases, identified from the forensic science Northern Ireland (FSNI) database, which had toxicology assays carried out on either blood or urine samples, were examined for the years 1999 up to and including 2005. In 1999 there were 30 toxicology requests while in 2005 there were 51, representing a 70% increase. The percentage of cases containing alcohol, drugs or both increased from 66% in 1999 to 78% in 2005. The estimated average blood alcohol concentration remained broadly similar throughout the spread of years. It was found to be 218mg% (milligrams per 100 millilitres) in 1999 and 217mg% in 2005. The actual number of cases studied within the 12h cut-off time rose from 9 in 1999 to 22 in 2005. The relationship between negative toxicology results and time delay between the alleged assault and forensic sampling was examined. This showed that between 44% and 74% of cases were found to have a time delay of >12h. Some of these cases may therefore represent false negative results. The presence of drugs, either alone or in combination with other drugs, doubled between 1999 and 2005. Increased identification was found with antidepressants, recreational drugs, benzodiazepines and analgesics, some of which were also associated with alcohol consumption. The findings are sufficient to cause alarm for the health and safety of certain individuals and their increased vulnerability to sexual assault in some social settings. Additionally, the legal implications of what constitutes valid consent needs to be considered further in the light of these findings, if attrition rates are to improve.", 
    "42": "Several experimental studies have shown a negative influence of benzodiazepines on driving skills. The objective of this study is to study the relationship between the blood concentration of benzodiazepines and the influence on performance in field sobriety tests. A retrospective case file evaluation was conducted to select cases of drivers, tested positive for benzodiazepines only in the period from January 1999 to December 2004. Drivers were grouped into the categories sub therapeutic, therapeutic or elevated concentrations. The outcome of the tests (walking, walking after turn, nystagmus, Romberg's test, behavior, pupils and orientation) was binomial. A Chi square test was used to assess differences in proportions of the categorized cases. In total 171 cases were included. Observations of behavior (n=137; p<0.01), walking (n=109; p<0.01), walking after turn (n=89; p=0.02) and Romberg's test (n=88; p<0.05) were significantly related to the benzodiazepine concentration. There was no significant relation between benzodiazepine concentration and effect on pupil size, nystagmus or orientation. The results of our study indicate a relation between the concentration of benzodiazepines and the results of some performance tests. More effort is needed to standardize the tests and to determine the sensitivity and selectivity of the tests for benzodiazepines.", 
    "43": "The naturally occurring pyrrolo[2,1- c][1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD) monomers such as sibiromycin, anthramycin, and tomaymycin form stable covalent adducts with duplex DNA at purine-guanine-purine sites. A correlative relationship between DNA-binding affinity, as measured by enhanced thermal denaturation temperature of calf thymus DNA ( T m), and cytotoxicity is well documented for these naturally occurring compounds and a range of synthetic analogues with sibiromycin having the highest Delta T m value (16.3 degrees C), reflecting favorable hydrogen-bonding interactions between the molecule and DNA bases. We report here that, surprisingly, the structurally simple synthetic C2-(2-naphthyl)-substituted pyrrolo[2,1- c][1,4]benzodiazepine monomer ( 5) has a Delta T m value (15.8 degrees C) similar to that of sibiromycin and significantly higher than the values for either anthramycin (13.0 degrees C) or tomaymycin (2.6 degrees C). 5 also has similar cytotoxic potency to sibiromycin which is widely regarded as the most potent naturally occurring PBD monomer. To investigate this, we have used NMR in conjunction with molecular dynamics to study the 2:1 adduct formed between 5 and the DNA duplex d(AATCTTTAAAGATT) 2. In contrast to the hydrogen-bonding interactions which predominate in the case of sibiromycin and anthramycin adducts, we have shown that the high binding affinity of 5 is due predominantly to hydrophobic (van der Waals) interactions. The high-resolution 2D NOESY, TOCSY, and COSY data obtained have also allowed unequivocal determination of the orientation of the PBD molecule (A-ring toward 3'-end of covalently bound strand), the stereochemistry at the C11 position of the PBD (C11 S), and the conformation of the C2-naphthyl ring which extends along the floor of the minor groove thus optimizing hydrophobic interactions with DNA. These results provide opportunities for future drug design in terms of extending planar hydrophobic groups at the C2 position of PBDs to maximize binding affinity.", 
    "44": "Psychoactive substances may be administered without the knowledge of a victim in order to induce incapacitation and thus facilitate criminal actions. The characteristics of the victims and the drugs used in such suspected chemical submissions (CS) were analyzed in 309 cases collected from October 2003 to December 2007 through a national survey. Out of 309 cases, 158 met all criteria of CS. The victims were mostly female (n = 89, 56%). The type of aggression was mostly sexual assault (in 79 cases 50%). Benzodiazepines and related drugs were detected in 129 victims (82%) and were mostly clonazepam, zolpidem, and bromazepam whereas flunitrazepam and gamma hydroxybutyrate, well known for their use in CS, were identified in 11 (7%) and five (3%) of the 158 victims. CS is not an anecdotal phenomenon in France. Information for health professionals and workers in forensic structures as well as education of the general population associated with preventive measures such as drug dosage form changes should contribute to improved care management of victims and decreased risk.", 
    "45": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line pharmacotherapy treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Clomipramine is effective in OCD but associated with more adverse events. Typically, higher doses of antidepressants are required for OCD. Up to 50% of patients do not respond to initial treatment of OCD. Treatment options for nonresponders include augmentation of antidepressants with atypical antipsychotics, among other strategies. First-line treatments for anxiety disorders include SSRIs, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and pregabalin. Tricyclic antidepressants are equally effective as SSRIs, but are less well tolerated. In treatment-resistant cases, benzodiazepines may be used when the patient does not have a history of dependency and tolerance. Other treatment options include irreversible and reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors, the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine, and other medications. Cognitive-behavioral therapy has been sufficiently investigated in controlled studies of OCD and anxiety disorders and is recommended alone or in combination with the above medications.", 
    "46": "Prolonged benzodiazepine treatment leads to tolerance and increases the risk of dependence. Flurazepam (FZP) withdrawal is associated with increased anxiety correlated with increased alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR)-mediated synaptic function and AMPAR binding in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Enhanced AMPAR synaptic strength is also associated with a shift toward inward rectification of synaptic currents and increased expression of GluR1, but not GluR2, subunits, suggesting augmented membrane incorporation of GluR1-containing, GluR2-lacking AMPARs. To test this hypothesis, the postsynaptic incorporation of GluR1 and GluR2 subunits in CA1 neurons after FZP withdrawal was examined by postembedding immunogold quantitative electron microscopy. The percentage of GluR1 positively labeled stratum radiatum (SR) synapses was significantly increased in FZP-withdrawn rats (88.2% +/- 2.2%) compared with controls (74.4% +/- 1.9%). In addition, GluR1 immunogold density was significantly increased by 30% in SR synapses in CA1 neurons from FZP-withdrawn rats compared with control rats (FZP: 14.1 +/- 0.3 gold particles/mum; CON: 10.8 +/- 0.4 gold particles/mum). In contrast, GluR2 immunogold density was not significantly different between groups. Taken together with recent functional data from our laboratory, the current study suggests that the enhanced glutamatergic strength at CA1 neuron synapses during benzodiazepine withdrawal is mediated by increased incorporation of GluR1-containing AMPARs. Mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity in this model of drug dependence are therefore fundamentally similar to those that operate during activity-dependent plasticity.",

    "51": "The safe and effective treatment of uncooperative or combative preschool children with extensive dental needs is one of pediatric dentist's ongoing challenges. The traditional methods of behavior management are no longer acceptable to parents as they are not ready to spare more time for dental treatment of their children. Keeping this in mind, the present study was designed and carried out to evaluate the sedative effects of oral ketamine and oral midazolam prior to general anesthesia. Twenty uncooperative children in the age-group of 2-6 years were selected after thorough medical examination and investigations. Informed consent was obtained from the parent. This was a randomized double-blind study. An anesthesiologist administered either 0.5 mg/kg midazolam or 5 mg/kg ketamine orally. The heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were recorded at regular intervals. The sedation and anxiolysis scores were also recorded. The parents were asked to answer a questionnaire at the follow-up session the next day on the surgical experience of the parent and the child and side effects experienced, if any. When the data was subjected to statistical analysis, it was observed that both drugs resulted in adequate sedation at the end of 30 min, with oral midazolam providing significantly better anxiolysis. The heart rate and respiratory rate were marginally higher with oral ketamine. The questionnaire revealed a better response with oral midazolam; side effects were more prominent with oral ketamine.", 
    "52": "Deficits in working memory and cognitive control in schizophrenia are associated with impairments in prefrontal cortical function, including altered gamma band oscillations. These abnormalities are thought to reflect a deficiency in the synchronization of pyramidal cell activity that is dependent, in part, on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission through GABA type A (GABA(A)) receptors containing alpha(2) subunits. The authors conducted a proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to test the hypothesis that a novel compound with relatively selective agonist activity at GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(2) subunits would improve cognitive function and gamma band oscillations in individuals with schizophrenia.",

    "56": "Gastroenterologist directed propofol has been proven safe in more than 220,000 published cases. Administration of low doses of opioid and/or benzodiazepine (\"balanced propofol sedation\") is the safest format for gastroenterologist directed propofol. Specific training is needed to undertake gastroenterologist directed propofol administration.", 
    "57": "More than 20 million endoscopic procedures are performed in the United States annually. More than 98% of these endoscopies are performed with sedation. This includes both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Sedation reduces a patient's anxiety and discomfort, often improving their satisfaction with the procedure. Sedation creates a relaxed patient and a relaxed procedure environment allowing for a successful endoscopic examination.", 
    "58": "Endoscopic sedation has traditionally been considered to be an element of the endoscopic examination. Endoscopists, together with endoscopy nurses, administered benzodiazepines and opioids with acceptable safety and efficiency. Today, sedation practices for endoscopy have become more diversified due to the entry of anesthesia specialists into the endoscopy unit, gastroenterologist-directed propofol administration, and prolonged diagnostic and therapeutic procedures that require deeper sedation. The economic implications of these changes in sedation are examined in this article.", 
    "59": "With growing prescription and availability, benzodiazepine usage in France is on the increase among the general population. Although its anxiolytic action has long been proven, many side effects can be observed. TYPOLOGY AND PREVALENCE: Paradoxical reactions of aggressiveness under benzodiazepines have been discussed in the scientific literature since the 1960s. This term was introduced to describe reactions of agitation and disinhibition occurring during anxiolytic or hypnotic treatment. Physical aggression, rape, impulsive decision-making and violence have been reported, as well as autoaggressiveness and suicide. General population studies indicate a prevalence of these reactions of less than 1%, and meta-analysis has shown that use of benzodiazepines generates aggressiveness more frequently than it reduces it. It has also been shown that long-term memory (anterograde amnesia) can be impaired following the ingestion of a benzodiazepine.", 
    "60": "Benzodiazepine-linked disinhibition, auto and heteroaggressiveness, anxiety and criminal acts have been associated with various vulnerability factors. Although the risk of these paradoxical reactions depends on the number of such factors present in a single patient, the effects of the type and dose of benzodiazepine on the frequency and the intensity of paradoxical symptoms are not clear. In terms of personality, several studies have demonstrated the role of low-stress control (specifically high-trait anxiety) on aggressiveness under benzodiazepines. Other authors underline the role of borderline personality disorder as a major risk factor predicting paradoxical reactions. Results of a study on borderline patients show a prevalence of benzodiazepine-linked disinhibition of 58%. On a neuropharmacological level, the influence of the GABA system on the serotonin control and the impact of alcohol seem to be established. Benzodiazepines, specifically when associated with alcohol, seem to facilitate GABAergic transmission, which can be at the origin of the disinhibited behaviours that have been reported.", 
    "61": "In 2000, France was the first country in terms of benzodiazepine use 17.4% of the adult population had been prescribed an anxiolytic. Implications for medicolegal and clinical practice are discussed.", 
    "62": "One approach to treating drug abuse uses antidrug antibodies to immunize subjects against the illicit substance rather than administering therapeutics that target the specific CNS site of action. At present, passive vaccination has recognized efficacy in treating certain gross symptoms of drug misuse, namely, motor activation, self-administration, and overdose. However, the potential for antibodies to prevent drug-induced changes involving finer cognitive processes, such as benzodiazepine-associated amnesia, remains unexplored. To address this concept, a flunitrazepam hapten was synthesized and employed in the generation of a panel of high affinity monoclonal antibodies. Anti-flunitrazepam mAb RCA3A3 ( K d,app = 200 nM) was tested in a mouse model of passive immunization and subsequent mole-equivalent challenge with flunitrazepam. Not only was flunitrazepam-induced sedation prevented but immunization also conferred protection to memory consolidation as assessed through contextual and cued fear conditioning paradigms. These results provide evidence that immunopharmacotherapeutic blockade of drug intoxication also preserves complex cognitive function.",

Despite their common chemical scaffold, these drugs differ in their pharmacokinetic and metabolic properties. In particular, they are biotransformed by different cytochrome P450 isoforms and also by different UDP-glucuronosyltransferase subtypes. The most important studies on the metabolic characteristics of several 1,4-benzodiazepines, carried out from 1998 onwards, are reported and briefly discussed in this review. Moreover, the analytical methods related to these studies are also described and commented upon and their most important characteristics are highlighted. Most methods are based on liquid chromatography, which provides wide applicability and good analytical performance granting high precision, accuracy and feasibility. Mass spectrometry is gaining widespread acceptance, particularly if the matrix is very complex and variable, such as human or animal blood. However, spectrophotometric detection is still used for this purpose and can grant sufficient selectivity and sensitivity when coupled to suitable sample pre-treatment procedures. A monograph is included for each of the following benzodiazepines: alprazolam, bromazepam, brotizolam, clotiazepam, diazepam, etizolam, flunitrazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, oxazepam and triazolam.",

Irreversible tissue damage and penumbra can be reliably identified by multitracer positron emission tomography (PET) which has severe limitations due to complexity, invasiveness and radiation exposure. Therefore other modalities served as surrogate markers, with diffusion/perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW/PW-MRI) and perfusion computed tomography (PCT) being applied widely in clinical routine. In order to evaluate the limitations of DW/PW-MRI a comparative study was performed in acute stroke patients in whom cerebral perfusion was assessed by perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PW-MRI) and H2(15)O-PET, tissue damage was estimated by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) and 11C-flumazenil (FMZ) PET and DW/PW-MRI mismatch was related to the tissue with increased oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) as an indicator of penumbra. The lesions in DW-MRI and in FMZ-PET were reliable predictors of final infarct on late MRI, but DW-MRI showed a high false positive rate. PW-MRI was limited in estimating flow and yielded values comparable to H2(15)O-PET only in the range between 20 and 30 ml/100 g/min. The DW/PW-MRI mismatch overestimated the penumbra as determined by increased OEF. These limitations of DW/PW-MRI have to be considered if used for selection of patients for treatment and might have an impact on the outcome of clinical trials based on this surrogate marker.",

In this prospective observational study, 200 patients presenting for elective colonoscopy under intravenous sedation were interviewed on emergence to determine the incidences of dreaming and recall. Sedation technique was left to the discretion of the anaesthetist. The incidence of dreaming was 25.5%. Patients reporting dreaming were younger than those who did not report dreaming. Doses of midazolam and fentanyl were similar between dreamers and non-dreamers, however propofol doses were higher in patients who reported dreams than those who did not. Patients reported short, simple dreams about everyday life--no dream suggested near-miss recall of the procedure. Frank recall of the procedure was reported by 4% of the patients, which was consistent with propofol doses commensurate with light general anaesthesia. The only significant predictor of recall was lower propofol dose. Satisfaction with care was generally high, however dreamers were more satisfied with their care than non-dreamers.",

Clozapine is commonly prescribed (up to 60%) in China. There is a trend of increasing second-generation antipsychotic use in east Asian countries. Up to 67.5% of patients received newer antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Benzodiazepine medications are used in up to 29.9% of study populations. Socioeconomic factors appear to be one of the major common factors that affect the prescription of antipsychotics and newer antidepressants.

Small-molecule inhibitors of NS5B include nucleoside and nonnucleoside analogs. Here, we report the discovery of a novel class of HCV polymerase nonnucleoside inhibitors, 1,5-benzodiazepines (1,5-BZDs), identified by high-throughput screening of a library of small molecules. A fluorescence-quenching assay and X-ray crystallography revealed that 1,5-BZD 4a bound stereospecifically to NS5B next to the catalytic site. When introduced into replicons, mutations known to confer resistance against chemotypes that bind at this site were detrimental to inhibition by 1,5-BZD 7a. Using a panel of enzyme isolates that covered genotypes 1 to 6, we showed that compound 4a inhibited genotype 1 only. In mechanistic studies, 4a was found to inhibit the RdRp activity of NS5B noncompetitively with GTP and to inhibit the formation of the first phosphodiester bond during the polymerization cycle. The specificity for the HCV target was evaluated by profiling the 1,5-BZDs against other viral and human polymerases, as well as BZD receptors.",

Furthermore, human pharmacodynamic studies utilizing transit, colonic, or rectal sensitivity and brain imaging have been useful in determining therapeutic efficacy (particularly for drugs that act on motor function). This review provides an overview of medications that have not yet been approved for treatment of patients with IBS yet have shown promise in phase IIB trials. These include drugs that act on the serotonin receptor and transporter system: antidepressants, norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, opioids, cholecystokinin antagonists, neurokinin-antagonists, chloride channel activators, guanylate cyclase C agonists, atypical benzodiazepines, probiotics, and antibiotics. The changing landscape in the regulatory approval process has impacted the development of IBS drugs. Guidance documents from regulatory agencies in Europe and the United States have focused on patients' reported outcomes and associated quality of life. After a decade of experience with different end points that have generated some data on psychometric validation and unprecedented information about responsiveness of the binary or global end points to drug therapy, it is necessary to pursue further validation studies before or during pivotal phase IIB or III trials.

    "94": "The European Union (EU) has 25 member-states and 455 million inhabitants. Statistics on traffic accidents in the EU show that more than 45,000 people are killed annually, including 5200 in France. At the same time, nearly two million persons in the EU require medical treatment for traffic-accident-related injuries, including 109,000 in France. In addition, traffic accidents are the major cause of death of those individuals aged 15 to 24 years. One third of the EU inhabitants will be hospitalized during their life due to a traffic accident with a cost over 160 billion euro (2-3% of the Gross Domestic Product). An important contributing factor to crashes is the use of alcohol and/or illicit drugs or medication when driving, as they exert negative effects on cognition and psychomotor functions. For illicit drugs, abuse of cannabis with or without alcohol is a major concern for the EU. In fact, three million Europeans use cannabis daily and 80% of them drive after use. A number of French studies since 1999 have underlined the high prevalence of cannabis found in the blood of injured or killed drivers. From medical or judicial observations, it is clear that cannabis use increases the risk of traffic accidents. Many groups outside Europe have also shown the association between drug abuse and crashes. The number of casualties related to certain medicines, especially benzodiazepines remains at a high level, particularly in the elderly. In many countries the prevalence of medicinal drugs associated with car accidents is higher than with cannabis. Annex III of the European Union Council Directive of July the 29th 1991 in fact states that a driving license should not be issued to or renewed for applicants or drivers who are dependent on psychotropic substances or use them regularly. Recently, France has categorized the medicinal drugs available in the country by using three pictograms: level one yellow, \"be careful\"; level two orange, \"be very careful\"; level three red, \"don't drive\". It is an important campaign that increases awareness among the public and the medical professionals about the potential dangerous effects of medicinal drugs when driving. The EU objective of reducing the number of fatalities to 25,000 by 2010 will require strengthening measures against the use of alcohol, illicit and medicinal drugs by not well-informed drivers. It is not only a really great challenge, but also a significant investment towards improving public health in France as well as in Europe.",

    "100": "Population aging is considered as the most serious problem in developed countries and is going to be a threat for developing countries. Aging is associated with various physiological changes and multiple diseases like diabetes, hypertension, arthritis etc. which alter the pharmacological response to a drug. Moreover, elderly people are more sensitive to frequently used drugs like NSAIDs, benzodiazepines, opioids etc. All these factors alter the drug response resulting in adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and hospitalization, consuming 40% of health service expenditure in developed countries. Hence it is mandatory for physicians to be aware of normal age related physiological and pharmacological changes taking place in old people. This will help to avoid irrational prescribing, minimize ADRs and maximize benefits of drugs in elderly patients. Above all educating the old patients and their care providers regarding the importance and proper use of drugs to their well being is necessary to improve adherence. Hence setting therapeutic guidelines for treating elderly patients will enhance their quality of life.", 
    "101": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors are potential targets for cancer therapeutics through the use of specific ligands such as the pro-apoptotic benzodiazepine RO5-4864. However, the poor water solubility of this compound has been a limitation to its application in vivo. Herein we describe an efficient synthesis for the conjugation, via a cleavable linker arm, of RO5-4864 to a novel tumour-delivery tool, the B-subunit of Shiga toxin (STxB). The conjugate is water soluble and specifically targets cancer cells that overexpress the glycolipid Gb3, the cellular Shiga toxin receptor that is found on several human tumours. After internalisation via retrograde transport, the prodrug is cleaved inside cells to release the active principle. Delivery by STxB therefore increases the cytotoxic activity of RO5-4864 and its tumour specificity.", 
    "102": "Benzodiazepines are a class of psychoactive drugs widely used for their anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant and hypnotic properties. Although the benzodiazepine receptor in the central nervous system has been well studied, the role of peripheral type benzodiazepine receptor, PBR, remains elusive. Here, we show that there are two PBR homologous genes in amniotes, PBR and PBRL, based on phylogenetic analysis. In chickens, PBRL is exclusively expressed during early development in differentiating primitive erythrocytes and this expression is tightly correlated with that of hemoglobin genes. PBR is not expressed in hematopoietic system during this period and is weakly expressed in developing central nervous system. Because one of PBRs' known functions is to regulate heme transport between the mitochondria and cytoplasm, we investigated expression profiles of heme biosynthesis genes. Seven of the eight enzymes involved in heme biosynthesis, with the exception of protoporphyrinogen oxidase, are present in chicken genome. Five of them, delta-aminolevulinate synthase, delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydrogenase, porphobilinogen deaminase, coproporphyrinogen decarboxylase and ferrochelatase, show stage-specific increase in gene expression correlated with primitive hematopoiesis, but not with primitive erythrocyte differentiation. PBRL protein is localized to the mitochondria in culture cells, and pharmacological inhibition of PBRL activity results in a decrease in globin protein levels during primitive erythropoiesis. Our data suggest a developmental role of PBRs in erythropoiesis in chickens, possibly via the regulation of heme availability for the assembly of functional hemoglobins.", 
    "103": "Daily living often requires individuals to flexibly respond to new circumstances. There is considerable evidence that the striatum is part of a larger neural network that supports flexible adaptations. Cholinergic interneurons are situated to strongly influence striatal output patterns which may enable flexible adaptations. The present experiments investigated whether acetylcholine actions in different striatal regions support behavioral flexibility by measuring acetylcholine efflux during place reversal learning. Acetylcholine efflux selectively increased in the dorsomedial striatum, but not dorsolateral or ventromedial striatum during place reversal learning. In order to modulate the M2-class of autoreceptors, administration of oxotremorine sesquifumurate (100 nM) into the dorsomedial striatum, concomitantly impaired reversal learning and an increase in acetylcholine output. These effects were reversed by the m(2) muscarinic receptor antagonist, AF-DX-116 (20 nM). The effects of oxotremorine sesquifumurate and AF-DX-116 on acetylcholine efflux were selective to behaviorally-induced changes as neither treatment affected acetylcholine output in a resting condition. In contrast to reversal learning, acetylcholine efflux in the dorsomedial striatum did not change during place acquisition. The results reveal an essential role for cholinergic activity and define its locus of control to the dorsomedial striatum in cognitive flexibility.", 
    "104": "Three experiments examined whether a drug state serving as a positive feature for pairings between a discrete conditional stimulus (CS, 15-s light or 15-s noise) and sucrose could transfer facilitative control to a CS with which it had never been presented. To do so, a CS was paired with a sucrose reward in the nicotine (0.4 mg/kg), amphetamine (AMP, 1mg/kg), or chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 5mg/kg) drug state; in separate saline sessions the CS was presented but was not followed by any reward. All three drug states facilitated responding to a discrete CS; previous studies found that this facilitation did not depend on direct associations between the drug state and sucrose. When a second discrimination was trained (e.g., CDP: light-sucrose and nicotine: noise-sucrose) the drug states facilitated responding to the CS trained in that state (nicotine: noise) as well as the CS normally presented in the other drug state (e.g., nicotine: light). A novel drug state (e.g., amphetamine) did not affect responding to either CS, indicating that the originally trained drug states had acquired functional similarity based on learning history. Also, a novel or ambiguous CS did not evoke responding in the previously trained drug state, indicating that both the features (drug states) and target conditional stimuli had to be trained in discriminations before transfer could occur.", 
    "105": "A promising way to interfere with biological processes is through the modulation of protein-protein interactions by means of small molecules acting as peptidomimetics. The 1,4-benzodiazepine scaffold has been widely reported as a peptide-mimicking, pharmacogenic system. While several synthetic pathways to C6-8 substituted benzodiazepines have been disclosed, few 1,4-benzodiazepines substituted at C9 have been reported. Herein, we describe a versatile approach to introduce cyclic, protonatable functionality at C8/C9. Introduction of the piperazine system at C8 and C9 gave access to a unique functionalization of the versatile benzodiazepine skeleton, broadening tailoring options on the benzofused side of the molecule, and the possibility of discovering novel peptidomimetics potentially able to modulate protein-protein interactions. Coupling of activated amino acids with poorly reactive anilines under mild conditions, while avoiding racemization, gave easy access to these compounds. Efficient amino acid activation was obtained by exploiting the rapid formation of acid chlorides under low temperature and acid/base free conditions, using triphenylphosphine and hexachloroacetone. This procedure successfully resulted in high reaction yields, did not produce racemization (ee > 98%, as demonstrated by using chiral solvating agents), and was compatible with the acid sensitive protecting groups present in the substrates.",

The effects of Murraya koenigii leaves (MKL) on cognitive functions, total serum cholesterol level and brain cholinesterase activity in young and aged mice fed orally with a diet containing 2%, 4% and 8% w/w of MKL for 30 days consecutively, were investigated. The memory scores were measured using various exteroceptive and interoceptive behavioral models. The MKL diets produced a significant dose-dependent improvement in the memory scores of young and aged mice and significantly reduced the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.). Also, brain cholinesterase activity and total cholesterol levels were reduced by the MKL diets. The underlying mechanism of action for the observed nootropic effect may be attributed to pro-cholinergic activity and a cholesterol lowering property. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to investigate specifically the therapeutic potential of MKL in the management of Alzheimer patients.",

Dynamic, 4-dimensional models of disease progression were created from 4 repeated high-resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging scans of 36 first-episode schizophrenia patients (30 men/6 women; mean age: 24.2 +/- 5.1 SD years) randomized to haloperidol (HAL) (n = 15) or olanzapine (OLZ) treatment (n = 21), imaged at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months (144 scans). Based on surface-based cortical models and point-by-point measures of gray matter volume, we generated time-lapse maps for each treatment. Disease trajectories differed for atypical versus typical neuroleptic drugs. A rapidly advancing parietal-to-frontal deficit trajectory, in HAL-treated patients, mirrored normal cortical maturation but greatly intensified. The disease trajectory advanced even after symptom normalization, involving the frontal cortex within 12 months with typical drug treatment. Areas with fastest tissue loss shifted anteriorly in the first year of psychosis. This trajectory was not seen with OLZ. Whether this association reflects either reduced neurotoxicity or neuroprotection cannot be addressed with neuroimaging; changes may relate to glial rather than neural components. These maps revise current models of schizophrenia progression; due to power limitations, the findings require confirmation in a sample large enough to model group x time interactions.",

Reversible vasogenic oedema affecting the white matter in the posterior regions was the characteristic finding in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. Although the prognosis is favourable, treatment needs to be early and aggressive, with rapid control of the convulsions and arterial hypertension, with the aim of preventing ischemia and cerebral infarct from developing.

Inhibition or loss of PARP activity leads to a recombinogenic phenotype characterized by increased sister chromatid exchange. Deficiency in homologous recombination (HR) owing to loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 is associated with hereditary cancers of the breast, ovary, pancreas and prostate. We investigated the therapeutic potential of PARP inhibitors in HR and BRCA2-defective cells. We exposed cells defective in the HR component XRCC3 (irs1SF) and BRCA2 (V-C8) and their parental (AA8, V79) or deficiency corrected (CXR3, V-C8+B2) cells to the PARP inhibitors NU1025 and AG14361. Mice bearing BRCA2-deficient and BRCA2-proficient tumours were treated with AG14361. All HR-defective cells were hypersensitive to normally non-cytotoxic concentrations of PARP inhibitors. Cells lacking BRCA2 were 20 times more sensitive to PARP inhibitor-induced cytotoxicity. Three out of five BRCA2-defective xenografts responded to the potent PARP inhibitor, AG14361, and one tumour regressed completely, compared with non-responses in the BRCA2-proficient tumours treated with AG14361 or any mice treated with vehicle control. Untreated PARP-1(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) accumulated more DNA double-strand breaks than did PARP-1(+/+) MEFs. We believe the underlying cytotoxic mechanism is due to PARP inhibitor-mediated suppression of repair of DNA single-strand breaks, which are converted to DNA double-strand breaks at replication. These replication-associated double-strand breaks, which are normally repaired by HR, become cytotoxic in cells defective in HR. Using a DNA repair inhibitor alone to selectively kill a tumour represents an exciting new concept in cancer therapy.",

The maintainance of appropriate level of sedation by well trained personnel is the key to achieve this success.", 
    "185": "Duloxetine, a dual-reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine, has been approved for the treatment of major depressive episodes and for female stress urinary incontinence. At present, only sparse experiences are available regarding antidepressive treatment in patients with a psychotic lifetime diagnose, whereas this group of patients often suffer from major depressive episodes. Here, we describe the first case of a male patient with postpsychotic depression who developed the severe side effect of urinary retention during antidepressive treatment with duloxetine combined with olanzapine. After remission of his psychotic episode, the patient presented with depressed mood, psychomotor inhibition, sleep disturbance, and suicidal ideas. Without changing the antipsychotic therapy, we implemented duloxetine (60 mg/d) and the patient significantly improved. However, he increasingly suffered from obstructive voiding difficulties and complained about a weak urinary stream and incomplete voiding leading to unacceptable dribbling. The urinary retention disappeared completely within 1 week after discontinuation of duloxetine. We switched to venlafaxine (150 mg/d) and were able to keep the depression in remission. This case report demonstrates for the first time the onset of urinary retention in postpsychotic depression and during combined treatment with duloxetine and olanzapine. We therefore suggest increased attention on voiding function in particular if several pharmacological agents are combined.",

In this brief case report, we review intrapericardial teratomas and present pertinent diagnostic and management options.", 
    "187": "In this work the implementation of benzodiazepine ion-selective electrodes for pharmaceutical formulations control is described. The solid-contact electrodes for midazolam and diazepam are based on polymeric membranes incorporating respectively beta-cyclodextrin and (2-hydroxiproyl)-gamma-cyclodextrin as ionophores, 2-fluorophenyl 2-nitrophenyl ether as plasticizer and potassium tetrakis (p-chlorophenyl) borate as ionic additive. For conventionally shaped midazolam electrode a slope of 61.9+/-1.3 mVdec(-1), a LLLR of 5.7+/-2.7 x 10(-4)gL(-1) and pH range of 2.6-5.4 was obtained, while the corresponding values for diazepam electrodes were of 67.6+/-3.0 mVdec(-1), 4.9+/-1.5 x 10(-2)gL(-1) and 1.9-2.7 pH units, respectively. Membrane optimization was based on the molar ratio between the ionophore and additive for midazolam and on inclusion cavity of cyclodextrin for diazepam. The miniaturization of the above-described electrodes gave rise to potentiometric detectors for sequential-injection lab-on-valve system with similar characteristics albeit the useful lifetime shortened from 1 year to approximately 15 days under continuous operation. The optimized flow conditions were achieved for sample injection volumes of 20 microL propelled towards the detection cell at the flow rate of 16 microLs(-1) during 80s. Real sample analysis revealed statistical accuracy and between-days precision comparable to the general used chromatographic-based procedure.", 
    "188": "The second generation antipsychotics clozapine and olanzapine are known to cause weight gain. However, only clozapine is associated with drug-induced fever. Cytokines have been linked to the induction of both weight gain and drug-induced fever. We investigated these potential side effects of clozapine and olanzapine and studied their differential effects on cytokine secretion. Thirty patients suffering from schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder or schizoaffective disorder were treated with either clozapine (mean modal dose: 266.7+/-77.9mg) or olanzapine (21.2+/-2.5mg) in a randomized, double-blind, 6-week study. Body mass index (BMI), tympanic temperature, and plasma levels of leptin and cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), soluble TNF receptor 1 and 2 (sTNFR-1/2), soluble interleukin-2 receptors (sIL-2R), interleukin-6) were determined weekly. BMI, leptin and cytokines significantly increased over time, except interleukin-6 and sTNFR-1 in the olanzapine group. All cytokines numerically increased compared to baseline already during the first week of treatment in both groups. Leptin, TNF-alpha, sTNFR-1, sTNFR-2 and sIL-2R levels correlated with the BMI. Five patients who received clozapine (33%) developed drug-induced fever (>/=38 degrees C). In these, interleukin-6 peak levels were significantly (p<0.01) higher than in those patients treated with clozapine who did not develop fever. In conclusion, increase of BMI appears to be related to clozapine's and olanzapine's similar effects on cytokine systems, whilst drug-induced fever appears to be related to clozapine's differential effects on interleukin-6.",

Benzodiazepines and antidepressants were the most frequently taken substances. A significant variation with the time of the day with a peak before midnight was observed for both sexes. Variation with the day of the week was less clear and showed a peak incidence for parasuicides on Mondays. There was no significant variation with the monthly or annual cycle. The frequency of parasuicides was associated with \"bad weather\" (precipitation). No association of parasuicide incidences to the lunar cycle was observed.", 
    "194": "Although diazepam provides limited long term neuroprotection, it may be useful for expanding the therapeutic time window after stroke by delaying neuronal death. However, it is not known to what extent diazepam maintains normal cellular structure and function in the first few days after ischemia. We used histological, immunohistochemical and electrophysiological endpoints to address this question. Gerbils underwent 5 min of global ischemia followed by 10 mg/kg diazepam (D) given 30 and 90 min later. Other animals were subjected to sham surgery, normothermic ischemia (I) or ischemia at 32 degrees C (Hypo). Postischemic brain temperature was regulated at approximately 37 degrees C for 24 h. Gerbils in the D and I groups were sacrificed 1, 2 and 3 days after ischemia. Sham and Hypo gerbils were sacrificed on day 3. CA1 cell counts, MAP2 staining and CA1 field potentials were performed at each survival time. Hypothermia prevented CA1 necrosis, preserved MAP2 integrity and maintained CA1 field potential amplitude. Ischemic gerbils showed a significant reduction in these 3 outcome measures by day 3. Diazepam-treated gerbils exhibited near normal levels of CA1 neurons and MAP2 staining. Most importantly, CA1 field potentials were similar to sham values and significantly preserved relative to non-treated ischemic gerbils. Diazepam maintains near normal structural and functional integrity up to 3 days after a global ischemic insult. As such, this drug may be useful for extending the therapeutic time window after cardiac arrest, stroke and related disorders.",

A new multi-fibre SPME system, which relies on multi-well plate technology and allows parallel preparation of up to 96 samples was used in order to obtain all data points of the binding curve in a single experiment. The binding of diazepam to human serum albumin was used as the model system in order to evaluate the performance of automated SPME. The time required to establish equilibrium was 30 min; this was verified experimentally by constructing extraction time profiles in the presence and absence of receptor molecules. Fibre constant calibration was used to remove inter-fibre variability from the binding data. Using a simple one-site binding model, a binding constant of 9.1 x 10(5)+/-3 x 10(5)l/mol was obtained. This result is in excellent agreement with values for equilibrium dialysis and manual SPME procedures reported in the literature. The proposed method can be further extended to study plasma-protein binding or drug binding to whole blood. In comparison to other methods, SPME is simpler, faster and fully automated, can be combined with any analytical detection method, and can be used to directly study complex samples.",

Two double-blind randomised clinical trials of olanzapine pamoate were conducted and demonstrate efficacy for both the acute treatment of schizophrenia and for the maintenance of antipsychotic response. Long-term open-label studies provide additional information on safety. The overall tolerability profile for olanzapine pamoate is similar to that for the oral formulation; however, with the depot there is a risk of a postinjection delirium sedation syndrome which resembles an overdose of oral olanzapine and which occurs in 0.07% of injections, requiring patients to be observed for 3 h after injection. At present, there are no studies available that directly compare olanzapine pamoate with other antipsychotics other than oral olanzapine.", 
    "204": "A series of imidazopyridine acetamides were synthesized to evaluate the effects of structural changes at both central (CBRs) and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs). These changes include the introduction of polar substituents or ionizable functional groups at the 2- and 8-position of the imidazopyridine skeleton. The results suggest that substituents endowed with hydrogen bonding acceptor and/or donor properties in the para position of the phenyl ring lead to high affinity for PBR. In electrophysiological studies, it was found that compounds 9, 12, 13, and 28 markedly enhanced GABA-evoked Cl (-) currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing alpha 1beta 2gamma 2 GABA A receptors. The capability of flumazenil to reduce the stimulatory effect exerted by compound 9 supports the conclusion that the modulatory effects of the examined compounds occur involving the CBR. The ability of compound 16 to increase GABA A receptor-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents in CA1 pyramidal neurons is indicative of its ability to stimulate the local synthesis and secretion of neurosteroids.",

Our findings are limited by the small sample size and suboptimal frequency of side effect measurements (e.g., measurements of blood pressure and heart rate, reports of hypotensive episodes). Confounding variables that might also play a role in interactions between CLZ and BZDs, but which were not measured in this study, include other types of respiratory compromise, cognitive dysfunction, and organ dysfunction.

Each test session consisted of inhalation of air for 20 min, 10-min rest, inhalation of CO2 7.5% for 20 min, 10-min rest, followed by a single vital capacity inhalation of 35% CO2. The CO2 7.5% was administered at peak drug effect. Subjective effects were measured using Visual Analogue Scales (VAS), the Panic Symptom Inventory and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment inventory. Twelve subjects participated (eight men), with a mean age of 25.9 years. The expected subjective effects of CO2 were seen and these were significantly different from effects of peak air. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the drugs or between drugs and placebo, indeed there was a trend for some VAS anxiety scores to be higher than placebo in the drug groups. There were some significant differences in cardiovascular responses to CO2, with propranolol significantly decreasing heart rate and flupentixol increasing blood pressure when compared with placebo. The lack of subjective anxiolytic actions of the three drugs contrasts with our previous findings with acute benzodiazepines and chronic selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor administration. It may be that prolonged treatment with these agents would be required to show anxiolytic effects, although it may also be that their efficacy is insufficient to be demonstrated in this model. The lack of anxiolytic actions of propranolol, despite a significant reduction in heart rate, is a further support for a central action of CO2 to produce anxiety.",

Subchronic administration of diazepam reduced latencies to clonus, tonic extension and death induced by PTZ. Subchronic vigabatrin produced enhanced latency to the first clonus but faster occurrence of tonic extension and death induced by PTZ. Subchronic gabapentin did not modify PTZ-induced seizures. Autoradiography experiments revealed reduced benzodiazepine receptor binding in several brain areas after subchronic treatment with diazepam or gabapentin, whereas subchronic vigabatrin did not induce significant receptor changes.

Pharmacologic options for insomnia treatment include prescription hypnotics, such as gamma-amino butyric acid-receptor agonists, sedating antidepressants, over-the-counter antihistamines, melatonin-receptor agonists, and alternative therapies. A concern with insomnia medications is the risk of next-day residual effects, which can impair memory and ability to perform certain tasks, such as driving, and may increase the risk of accidents and falls, especially in the elderly.", 
    "238": "To describe the impact of current insomnia treatments on next-day performance.", 
    "239": "The longer-acting benzodiazepines are associated with next-day \"hangover\" effects and, as a result, have been largely replaced by agents in the nonbenzodiazepine class, which typically have shorter half-lives. The hypnotic, sedative activities of these classes of drugs depend on variations in binding characteristics to the alpha1 subunit of the gamma-amino butyric acidA-receptor, which inhibits neuronal activity in broad areas of the brain and is found in areas of the brain responsible for sleep/wakefulness and sedation. However, nonbenzodiazepines with a rapid onset of action and short half-life have shown limited efficacy for maintaining sleep throughout the night. These properties have contributed to the development of modified-release formulations. Zolpidem extended-release is a bilayer tablet that retains the fast onset of action of its parent compound zolpidem while extending the duration of hypnotic activity, owing to a slower-release portion of the tablet.", 
    "240": "Based on clinical evidence, the risk of residual next-day effects of zolpidem extended-release is limited, mainly due to the similarly short half-life in its extended-release formulation."
