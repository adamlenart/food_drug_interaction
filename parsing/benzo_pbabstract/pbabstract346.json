Many of these falls lead to fractures, the most serious type being hip fractures. Whether or not the use of various medications causes falls and fractures has been the subject of more than 50 observational epidemiological studies, most published after 1988. Few of these studies were specifically designed to investigate the associations between medication use and falls, so most have methodological limitations. Uncontrolled confounding factors are a particular problem. It is important to recognise these flaws in study design when reviewing the scientific literature on the link between medications and falls and fractures. Patients taking psychotropic medications appear to have about a 2-fold increased risk of falls and fractures, compared with individuals not taking these drugs. The strongest evidence is for antidepressants; nearly every relevant study has found an association with falls. The relative effect of selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants on falls is still unknown. The effect on the risk of falling of short-acting versus long-acting benzodiazepines is not straightforward: it may be the benzodiazepine dosage that matters, rather than the drug half-life. Whether or not any medications used to treat cardiovascular problems cause falls remains unclear. Current evidence suggests that diuretics, in general, do not cause falls and that thiazide diuretics, in particular, may help prevent fractures by slowing the development of osteoporosis. Some studies have found that use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is associated with falling; this deserves further study. Reducing the use of psychotropic drugs by residents of nursing homes should be a high priority for physicians, pharmacists and nursing staff. Psychotropic drug use should also be kept to a minimum among older people living in the community.", 
    "1": "At present there are no poison center or toxicology services available in Ecuador. In preparation to begin such a service it was decided to evaluate the occurrence and causes of poisoning in Quito (population 1.5 million). A retrospective chart review was performed for all of 1995 of all the patients admitted to the emergency departments of 3 main public hospitals of Quito for poisoning, excluding those who had ethanol and food poisoning. We analyzed sex, age, socio-economic status, origin and principal causes of poisoning; 850 cases were located. Predominant age groups seen were 15-30 y and 31-45 y. Poisoning with drugs was the major cause with 211 cases, followed by organophosphate and phosphorus poisoning. Principal drugs seen in poisoning were benzodiazepine, acetaminophen and aspirin. The occurrence of poisoning in Quito showed unique regional differences that will help prepare local health officials to establish intervention strategies for the reduction of morbidity and mortality from poisoning. Significant efforts in both public and professional education will need to be made to both reduce occurrence and better treat poisonings.", 
    "2": "Membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase (GC) is regulated by muscarinic receptors (mAChRs). Carbamylcholine (CC) induces a \"dual\" biological response on GC activity. Thus, an activation is observed at 0.1 nM and a maximal response at 1 nM CC. However, at higher agonist concentration (> 100 nM), there is an agonist-dependent inhibition of GC. This CC dual response is affected by 4-DAMP and HDD (M3 antagonists), which produce a right-shift of the CC curve; the maximal CC dose response with 4-DAMP is more potent than that with HDD. Moreover, AFDX-DS (an M2 antagonist) increases basal activity and decreases the agonist-dependent inhibition. Neither the CC response nor the CC maximal dose responses are affected by pirenzepine (PZ, M1 antagonist). The agonist-dependent stimulation of GC activity is inhibited by 4-DAMP showing a -log IC50 = 8.4 +/- 0.4, while AFDX116 DS poorly inhibits such activity with a -log IC50 = 5.0 +/- 0.2. The agonist-independent (basal) GC activity also was inhibited by 4-DAMP, in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 = 8.5 +/- 0.2. Nonetheless, other muscarinic antagonists (PZ and HDD) were not able to inhibit this basal GC. Pertussis toxin treatment produces a complete blockade of the agonist-dependent inhibition of GC with a full expression of the agonist-dependent activation of membrane-bound GC. These results indicate that membrane-bound GC is regulated by muscarinic agents through two opposite signaling pathways; one involves the activation of GC via an M3 mAchR coupled to a PTX-insensitive G protein, while the GC inhibition is mediated through a PTX-sensitive Gi/o protein possibly coupled to an M2 mAChR.", 
    "3": "Total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) using propofol, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) or midazolam in combination with sufentanil was investigated in 45 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Anaesthesia was induced with sufentanil, etomidate and pancuronium. After endotracheal intubation, anaesthesia was continued with sufentanil (2 micrograms kg-1 h-1) for all patients. Patients were randomized to receive supplementary propofol (2 mg kg-1 h-1, n = 15), gamma-hydroxybutyrate (20 mg kg-1 h-1, n = 15) or midazolam (0.06 mg kg-1 h-1, n = 15). Haemodynamic measurements were performed after induction and at various times in the pre-bypass period. In the propofol group, a significant decrease in heart rate (HR 12% +/- 3%), cardiac index (CI 23% +/- 4%), mean arterial pressure (MAP 16% +/- 3%) and left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI 17% +/- 4%) occurred until sternotomy was performed. With the exception of cardiac index, both midazolam and gamma-hydroxybutyrate produced similar haemodynamic effects: cardiac index was temporarily decreased (19% +/- 4%) by midazolam and remained unchanged after gamma-hydroxybutyrate. In both groups, sternotomy was followed by temporary hypertension, associated with a significant rise in systemic vascular resistance. No electrocardiographical signs of ischaemia were observed in any patient. In the case of propofol and midazolam, gamma-hydroxybutyrate showed adequate haemodynamic stability especially after induction of anaesthesia and may also be a suitable agent for total intravenous anaesthesia in patients with coronary artery disease. However, during sternotomy, supplementary administration of opioids was required.",

Neuromuscular block was induced with 0.5 mg.kg-1 atracurium and maintained with doses of 0.15 mg.kg-1. Neuromuscular transmission was recorded using train-of-four (TOF) nerve stimulation and mechanomyography. Neostigmine, 0.07 mg.kg-1, was administered when the first twitch in TOF had recovered to 10% of control. Reversal time was defined as: time from administration of neostigmine until TOF ratio recovered to 0.70.", 
    "6": "There was no difference in reversal time between patients with TBW < 80 kg (7.2 +/- 2.6 min, mean +/- SD), and patients with TBW > or = 80 kg (6.9 +/- 3.6 min). When patients were grouped according to BMI there was no difference in reversal time between groups with low BMI (6.9 +/- 2.6 min) or high BMI (7.1 +/- 3.6 min). There was, furthermore, no difference in reversal time between the 15 patients in the study population with the smallest TBW or BMI and the 15 patients with the greatest TBW or BMI.

    "8": "The present study was conducted to clarify the acute effect of tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TRCP), an organophosphate flame-retardant, on spontaneous ambulatory activity (AA) in male ICR mice and to examine the neurochemical mechanism of this effect. Single dose administration of 200 mg/kg i.p. of TRCP increased AA in ICR mice. Neither the nicotinic cholinergic antagonist mecamylamine (MA) nor the muscarinic cholinergic antagonist scopolamine (SCP) affected the AA response to TRCP. On the other hand, the benzodiazepine agonist diazepam (DZ), the GABAA agonist muscimol (MUS) and the GABAB agonist baclofen (BAC) all attenuated the effect of TRCP. DZ and MUS blocked the increase of AA within the first 10 min after administration of TRCP. These drugs did not attenuate the AA-increasing effect of SCP, suggesting that the mechanism of TRCP action is distinct from that of SCP. MUS and BAC did, but DZ did not, inhibit the AA increasing effect of the dopaminergic agonist apomorphine (APO), suggesting that dopamine is involved in the control of AA, and that GABA can affect AA through interaction with dopaminergic neurons. These results suggest that TRCP acts as a GABA antagonist and not as a cholinergic agonist, and that TRCP increases AA in ICR mice through a GABAergic mechanism.", 
    "9": "Because cocaine enhances dopamine brain activity and dopamine signals are transferred through gamma-aminobutyric acid pathways, the authors hypothesized GABA-ergic disruption in cocaine-abusing subjects. This study tests this hypothesis.", 
    "10": "GABA brain function was assessed indirectly by measuring the brain metabolic responses to lorazepam, a drug that facilitates GABA neurotransmission. Thirteen current cocaine-abusing subjects and 14 comparison subjects were scanned twice with positron emission tomography and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose; the first scan was obtained after placebo administration and the second after lorazepam administration (30 micrograms/kg).", 
    "11": "Despite significantly higher plasma lorazepam concentrations in comparison subjects than in cocaine-abusing subjects, lorazepam-induced decrements in whole brain metabolism were significantly greater in cocaine-abusing (mean = 21%, SD = 13%) than in comparison (mean = 13%, SD = 7%) subjects. These differences were largest in striatum, thalamus, and parietal cortex. Lorazepam-induced sleepiness in cocaine-abusing subjects was intense and was significantly greater than in comparison subjects, and it was correlated with lorazepam-induced changes in thalamic metabolism. Whereas regional metabolic measures during placebo administration were significantly higher in cocaine-abusing subjects than in comparison subjects, the measures during lorazepam administration were equivalent for both groups.", 
    "12": "The enhanced sensitivity to lorazepam in cocaine-abusing subjects suggests disruption of GABA pathways that may reflect, in part, cocaine withdrawal. The intense sleepiness induced by lorazepam in some of the abusers, despite their significantly lower plasma concentrations, should alert clinicians of the potential toxicity from accentuated responses to sedative hypnotics in active cocaine-abusing subjects.", 
    "13": "Insomnia is usual, and a serious problem in children with neurological disorders. Few studies have been made of this and above all there are no guide lines or suggestions as to how to treat these problems. The difficulty is made worse by the different characteristics of the insomnia and of the affected children themselves. Poor sleeping is associated with other pathology of the patient (mental retardation, convulsions, etc.).",

    "15": "Neurons and glial cells are capable of synthesizing various bioactive steroids, but the neuronal mechanisms controlling neurosteroid-secreting cells are poorly understood. In the present study, we have investigated the possible effect of an endogenous ligand of benzodiazepine receptors, the triakontatetraneuropeptide [17-50] (TTN), on steroid biosynthesis in the frog hypothalamus. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that most hypothalamic neurons expressing 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta 5-delta 4-isomerase also contained peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor-like immunoreactivity. Confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis revealed that the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor-immunoreactive material was located both in the cytoplasm and at the periphery of the cell bodies. By using the pulse-chase technique, TTN was found to stimulate the conversion of [3H]pregnenolone into various steroids, including 17-hydroxypregnenolone, 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone, in a dose-dependent manner. The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor agonist Ro5-4864 mimicked the stimulatory effect of TTN on the formation of neurosteroids. The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor antagonist PK11195 significantly reduced the effect of TTN on neurosteroid synthesis, while the central-type benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil did not affect the formation of neurosteroids evoked by TTN. These data indicate that TTN stimulates the biosynthesis of 3-keto-17 alpha-hydroxysteroids in frog hypothalamic neurons through activation of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors likely located at the plasma membrane level.", 
    "16": "The purpose of this study is visual evaluation of the distribution of I-123 iomazenil in the brains of patients with various types of mental disorder and to examine whether chronic administration of a clinical dose of benzodiazepine (BZ) affects the binding of I-123 iomazenil to BZ receptors (BZR). The subjects were 10 patients with mental disorders (3 males and 7 females) with a mean age of 26.8 yrs (range 19-39 yrs). Four of 10 patients were administered BZ for over 3 months and the other six were free of BZ for over one month. The SPECT images were obtained at 5-25 min (early) and 170-190 min (delayed), after the bolus i.v. injection of 167 MBq of I-123 iomazenil, with a triple-head gamma camera. The images were visually evaluated and the washout ratios of each region were calculated. In visual analysis, abnormalities were recognized in 5 patients on the delaye SPECT. The abnormalities were recognized more frequently in the superior frontal lobe. The washout ratio was higher in the BZ (+) patient group than in the BZ (-) patient group. I-123 iomazenil is useful, because the SPECT image with I-123 iomazenil reflects the distribution of BZR on the brain and provides the different information from that obtained with perfusion SPECT, X-ray CT or MRI. The rapid washout of I-123 iomazenil from the brains of BZ (+) patients suggests that chronic administration of a clinical dose of BZ affects the binding of I-123 iomazenil to BZR.", 
    "17": "In this study we identified and characterized the receptor related to the modulation of growth of human gastric cancer by gastrin. By performing receptor binding assays on human AGS gastric cancer cells with the selective CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonist [3H]L-365,260, specific and saturable binding were determined. Binding was dependent on protein concentration, time, temperature, and the presence of protease inhibitors, and was located in the membrane fraction. Gastrin, as well as CCK, stimulated gastric cancer cell growth in a receptor-mediated fashion at a concentration consistent with the binding affinity. Receptor gene expression for the CCK-B/gastrin receptor, but not for the CCK-A receptor, was found by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Receptor binding assays as well as transcriptional and growth studies provide evidence that gastrin-stimulated growth of human gastric cancer is mediated by CCK-B/gastrin-like receptors.", 
    "18": "Activated glial cells are implicated in regulating and effecting the immune response that occurs within the CNS as part of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is expressed in glial cells. We examined the utility of using in vitro and in vivo ligand binding to the PBR as a measure of lesion activity in autoimmune CNS demyelinating diseases. Applying a combined autoradiography and immunohistochemical approach to spinal cord and brain tissues from mice with EAE, we found a correlation at sites of inflammatory lesions between [3H]-PK11195 binding and immunoreactivity for the activated microglial/macrophage marker Mac-1/CD11b. In MS tissues, [3H]-PK11195 binding correlated with sites of immunoreactivity for the microglial/macrophage marker CD68, at the edges of chronic active plaques. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with [11C]-PK11195 showed ligand uptake only at sites of active MS lesions defined by magnetic resonance imaging criteria. Our results indicate the potential to develop markers suitable for both in vitro and in vivo use, which will serve to help correlate phenotypic and functional properties of cells which participate in disease or injury responses within the CNS.", 
    "19": "To investigate the characteristics and subjective quality of sleep, the use of hypnotics and their correlates in an urban elderly population, a structured interview was administered to a stratified random sample of 600 elderly subjects in five age groups. Interrupted sleep and napping were common; nonetheless, 88% of the subjects considered their sleep at least satisfactory. According to specific criteria, 17% were good, 72% moderate and 11% poor sleepers. Habitual insomnia was reported by 12% of the subjects. Quality of sleep did not differ between age groups or genders. Hypnotics were habitually used by 8% of the men and 25% of the women. Consumption increased with age in both sexes, and 77% of the hypnotics were benzodiazepines. In multivariate regression analyses, insomnia and habitual use of hypnotics were associated with poor health, but only the latter with age and gender. As a conclusion, most of the subjects considered their sleep satisfactory, and aging itself did not seem to have an effect on the quality of sleep. The use of hypnotics was common, more prevalent in women and increased with age. Aging and poor health were independently associated with the use of hypnotics, but not with poor quality of sleep or insomnia.", 
    "20": "The efficacy of midazolam (0.071 +/- 0.006 microgram/kg) inactivation by flumazenil, a direct antagonist of benzodiazepines, was assessed in 20 patients during local and regional anesthesia. The hemodynamic values were assessed and a complex of psychological tests used. A single intravenous injection of flumazenil in a dose of 0.2 mg (2.8 +/- 0.41 micrograms/kg) resulted in a smooth an reliable arrest of benzodiazepine effect and effective repair of the main psychomotor reactions. Reversion of benzodiazepine effect is possible after an hour, which may require repeated injection of flumazenil.", 
    "21": "This study was aimed at assessing the airtightness of the airways during the use of a laryngeal mask (LM) under conditions of myoplegia and traditional forced ventilation of the lungs (FVL) with carboperitoneum (CP) during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LCE). A total of 146 anesthesias for LCE were carried out using LM (n = 86) or endotracheal tube (ETT) (n = 60). The groups did not differ by the demographic characteristics or concomitant diseases. After premedication and induction of anesthesia it was maintained with N2O:O2--2/1 (Fi O2 = 0.3), fractionated administration of fentanyl (0.1-0.2 mg), and pipecuronium bromide (0.06 mg/kg). A gastric tube was inserted. Two variants of FVL were used: 1) permanent minute respiration volume (MRV) was maintained and 2) MRV was increased in order to maintain the Et CO2 at a constant level. The amount of gastric contents was measured and its pH assessed. Regurgitation and aspiration was assessed (in 33 patients) using methylene blue in gelatin capsules administered orally 10 min before anesthesia. Gas exchange was monitored by the Datex Capnomac-Ultima and by check-ups of acid base balance in the arterial capillary blood, hemodynamics was monitored by noninvasive Criticon Dynamap monitor. Manual FVL with inhalation P no more than 10 cm H2O completely prevented the entry of gas narcotic mixture into the stomach. Application of LM under conditions of total myoplegia and FVL with inhalation P of 23-25 cm H2O provided a satisfactory airtightness of the LM-airways contact without audible (appreciable) leaking of gas narcotic mixture. Leakage of gas narcotic mixture during LM application under total myoplegia and carboperitoneum (with CO2 pressure in the abdominal cavity 12 cm Hg) is no more than 6%, which indicates that LM is a reliable air guide providing good airtightness of the LM-airways contact even under conditions of increased abdominal pressure. No cases of regurgitation and aspiration were observed.", 
    "22": "A high risk of hemodynamic disorders is the main problem associated with regional blocking in elderly patients subjected to abdominal surgery. There are theoretical reasons for ganglionic blocking without hypotonus as a means preventing hemodynamic complications of regional anesthesia in traumatic interventions. Extensive operations on the abdominal organs were performed in 40 patients aged 60 to 82 years. Before surgery the epidural space at the levels from T12 to T7, depending on the level of the intervention, was catheterized. Epidural blocking was combined with drugs for intravenous anesthesia (dipidolor, diazepam, nitrogen oxide). Pentamine in a dose of 1.36 +/- 0.06 mg/kg/h and dopamine in a dose of 3 to 4 micrograms/kg/h were special component of anesthesia. Intubation of the trachea and forced ventilation of the lungs were used; myorelaxants were administered only before intubation. The intra- and postoperative periods were characterized by hemodynamic and metabolic stability and early postoperative rehabilitation. The authors consider that preventive ganglionic blocking without hypotonus attained by a combination of a dosed injection of a ganglion blocker and injection of a highly selective adrenomimetic dopamine in the microcirculation dose ensure the hemodynamic and metabolic stability of balanced anesthesia based on epidural blocking in elderly and senile patients subjected to extensive abdominal interventions. The proposed method of balanced anesthesia is an effective means of neurovegetative inhibition during epidural blocking as the basic component of anesthesia, which permits minimizing the doses of general anesthetics and ensures positive changes in the respiratory system of elderly patients, manifesting by improved pulmonary and bronchial conduction and improvement of blood gas composition.", 
    "23": "The high prevalence of anxiety disorders implies the necessity of adequate treatment by GPs. Regarding psychopharmacological treatment benzodiazepines and antidepressants are the drugs of first choice, low potency neuroleptics, beta-blockers as well as the herbal medicine kava-kava may be indicated in special cases (e.g. low degree of anxiety, abuse or tolerability problems). The separation of generalized anxiety disorder from panic disorder seems to be essential due to treatment implications: antidepressants like Imipramine or SSRIs are the drugs of choice in the latter case. Hints regarding handling as well as possible side-effects of the different psychotropics are given, the combination with psychotherapy (relaxation techniques, behaviour therapy) is recommended being the best way of effective treatment.", 
    "24": "Cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) metabolizes a diverse array of clinically important drugs. For some of these (e.g., cyclosporine, verapamil, midazolam), CYP3A in the intestinal mucosa contributes to their extensive and variable first-pass extraction. To further characterize this phenomenon, we measured CYP3A content and catalytic activity toward the probe substrate midazolam in mucosa isolated from duodenal, jejunal and ileal sections of 20 human donor intestines. For comparison, the same measurements were performed for 20 human donor livers, eight of which were obtained from the same donors as eight of the intestines. Excellent correlations existed between homogenate and microsomal CYP3A content for the three intestinal regions. Median microsomal CYP3A content was greatest in the duodenum and lowest in the ileum (31 vs. 17 pmol/mg of protein). With respect to midazolam 1'-hydroxylation kinetics, the median Km for each intestinal region was similar to the median hepatic Km, approximately 4 microM. In contrast, the median Vmax decreased from liver to duodenum to jejunum to ileum (850 vs. 644 vs. 426 vs. 68 pmol/min/mg). Intrinsic clearance (Vmax/Km) followed a similar trend for the intestinal regions; median duodenal intrinsic clearance was comparable to hepatic intrinsic clearance (157 and 200 microl/min/mg, respectively). Vmax correlated with CYP3A content for all tissues except the ileum. Duodenal and jejunal Vmax and CYP3A content varied by >30-fold among donors. Microsomes prepared from every other 1-foot section of six intestines were also analyzed for CYP3A as well as for two coenzymes. In general, CYP3A activity, CYP3A content and CYP reductase activity rose slightly from duodenum to middle jejunum and then declined to distal jejunum and ileum. Cytochrome b5 content and cytochrome b5 reductase activity varied little throughout the intestinal tract. Regional intrinsic midazolam 1'-hydroxylation clearance was greatest for the jejunum, followed by the duodenum and ileum (144, 50 and 19 ml/min, respectively). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the upper small intestine serves as the major site for intestinal CYP3A-mediated first-pass metabolism and provides a rationale for interindividual differences in oral bioavailability for some CYP3A substrates.", 
    "25": "Alprazolam decreased the reinforcement rate and increased the shorter-response rate of contingency-controlled timing behavior under a differential reinforcement of low-rate schedule (DRL 45-s) in rats. An integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model was developed to describe and characterize the effects of i.v. and s. c. administration of alprazolam. The onset, peak and disappearance of alprazolam effects were evaluated during a 3-hr session. After s. c. alprazolam administration, two peak increases in shorter-response rate occurred at moderate alprazolam serum levels, first in the ascending and then in the descending limb of the concentration-time profile. We used a stimulation-sedation PD model incorporating two opposing effect-link sigmoidal Emax functions to model the two peaks after s.c. alprazolam administration. The model suggested that alprazolam possesses both stimulatory and sedative effects in a continuous but sequential fashion, which corresponded to low- and high-concentration effects as indicated by the EC50 values of 0.09 and 0.18 microg/ml, respectively. Owing to the rapid onset of i.v. administration, the first peak (a transition phase before the onset of the sedative effect) was absent, with the presence of the second peak again coinciding with the offset of the sedative effect. The reinforcement rate (IC50 = 0.02 microg/ml) characterized by the indirect response model to account for the initial hysteresis is an index for evaluating the deficit in timing performance. Although the effects of alprazolam can be described in behavioral terms, simultaneous PK-PD optimization numerically defines the performance and hypothesizes the coexistence of stimulation and sedation components for alprazolam. The stimulation-sedation model may help in delineating the possible mechanisms for adverse rebound side effects and of tolerance in humans.", 
    "26": "1. We discovered a novel gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABA(A)) receptor ligand displaying seemingly opposite functionalities, depending on the alpha isoform of the alpha(x)beta2gamma2 subtypes. PNU-107484A enhanced GABA-induced Cl- currents in the alpha1beta2gamma2 subtype, but inhibited the currents in the alpha3beta2gamma2 and alpha6beta2gamma2 subtypes, and its half-maximal concentrations in the subtypes were 3.1 +/- 0.5, 4.2 +/- 1, and 3.5 +/- 0.2 microM, respectively, without showing much dependency on alpha isoforms. 2. In the alpha1beta2 subtype, the drug at concentrations up to 40 microM showed no effect on GABA-induced Cl- currents, suggesting the requirement of the gamma subunit for its action. 3. PNU-107484A behaved like a positive allosteric modulator of the alpha1beta2gamma2 subtype with its binding site distinct from those for benzodiazepines, barbiturates and neurosteroids. With the alpha3beta2gamma2 subtype, the drug behaved like a non-competitive inhibitor of GABA, thus blocking Cl- currents by GABA alone or in the presence of pentobarbitone and neurosteroids. 4. It appears that PNU-107484A is a unique GABA(A) receptor ligand with alpha isoform-dependent functionalities, which may provide a basis for development of alpha isoform-selective ligands, and it could be useful as a probe to investigate the physiological roles of the various alpha isoform subtypes.", 
    "27": "1. Glutamate receptor activation has been previously shown to result in mitochondrial depolarization and activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in cultured neurones. In this study, we characterized the effects of two putative permeability transition inhibitors, namely trifluoperazine and dibucaine, on mitochondrial depolarization in rat intact, cultured forebrain neurones. 2. Permeability transition was monitored by following mitochondrial depolarization in neurones loaded with the mitochondrial membrane potential-sensitive fluorescent indicator, JC-1. Trifluoperazine (10 20 microM) and dibucaine (50-100 microM) inhibited or delayed the onset of glutamate-induced permeability transition. 3. We also investigated the effects of trifluoperazine and dibucaine on neuronal recovery from glutamate-induced Ca2+ loads. Trifluoperazine affected Ca2+ recovery in a manner similar to the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange inhibitor, CGP-37157, while dibucaine had no apparent effect on Ca2+ recovery. Therefore, inhibition of permeability transition does not appear to be involved in Ca2+ recovery from glutamate-induced Ca2+ loads. 4. Trifluoperazine and dibucaine did not inhibit [3H]-dizocilpine binding at the concentrations that prevented mitochondrial depolarization. 5. These studies suggest that trifluoperazine and dibucaine inhibit permeability transition in intact neurones. Trifluoperazine also appears to inhibit mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange. These drugs should prove to be valuable tools in the further study of the role of mitochondrial permeability transition in glutamate-induced neuronal death.",

The recovery of saccadic eye movements from equal levels of sedation was on average almost half an hour faster for Ro 48-8684 than for midazolam, with considerable interindividual differences (range 2, 55 min). The doses of Ro 48-8684 leading to the same clinical endpoint as midazolam were comparable, but the corresponding predicted effect compartment concentrations of Ro 48-8684 were on average 2.6 times lower (range 1.5, 4.9 times). The slope of the linear concentration-effect-relationship for saccadic peak velocity was on average 2.2 times steeper for 10 mg Ro 48-8684 than for midazolam (range 1.3, 3.3). The slope decreased on average 4.4-fold (range 1.6, 7.3 times), with doses of Ro 48-8684 increasing from 1 to 10 mg.

The infusions were stopped after 20 min or if sedation became too strong for proper performance of the tests. Consequently, infusion rates (mg min(-1)) differed considerably among doses. Blood samples were collected frequently for pharmacokinetic determinations (two-compartment model). Pharmacodynamics were assessed by recording of saccadic eye movements (saccadic peak velocity) and electroencephalography (beta-power). These parameters were used for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling.", 
    "34": "Ro 48-6791 and midazolam were both well tolerated. Most clinical events were dose-dependent central depressant effects. The volume of distribution (V(SS)) and plasma clearance of Ro 48-6791 were on average markedly larger than those of midazolam (171 +/- 65 vs 41 +/- 10 l and 2.2 +/- 0.9 vs 0.42 +/- 0.11 l min(-1), respectively). The doses of Ro 48-6791 leading to loss of saccadic eye movements were on average four times lower than that of midazolam. The corresponding predicted effect compartment concentrations differed by a factor of about six. Doses of Ro 48-6791 and midazolam eliciting similar maximum effects had a comparable onset and duration of action for saccadic peak velocity. Midazolam caused a significantly larger (33%, range 17, 55%) increase in beta-power than Ro 48-6791 at the highest administered dose. Ro 48-6792, a metabolite of Ro 48-6791, showed a considerably longer half-life than the parent compound. Although there were no indications of a discernable effect of Ro 48-6792 in the present study, the effects of possible accumulation during prolonged administration should be investigated further.",

The patients were randomly allocated to an intervention or control group. 4-12 months after receiving the letter, the amount of benzodiazepines (DDD/six months) prescribed had decreased by 51% in the intervention group and by 24% in the control group. The impression of the participating doctors was that the patients appreciated the information and that it was easier than expected to get the patients to reduce benzodiazepine intake. The marked reduction in the control group too indicates that the doctors' active attitude towards dose reduction had been applied towards these patients as well.",

Maximum acceptable daily doses were introduced for psychoactive drugs, and the daily intake was calculated in the individual case, based on information about prescriptions for a minimum period of three months. A total of 46 cases led to reactions during the years 1995 and 1996; these consisted of a warning to the driver (38 cases), a recommendation to the police to suspend the license (23 cases) or advising the licensing authorities to change the conditions of the license (six cases). Combinations of psychoactive drugs were used in 39 cases. One of the benzodiazepines was judged to represent the highest risk in 32 cases, and an opioid analgesic in ten cases. Information was usually obtained from monitoring doctors' prescriptions, rarely directly from the doctors themselves. Greater alertness, combined with objective guidelines, might help reduce the problem. In our opinion, stricter regulations are not necessary.",

These receptors are also targets for many drugs including benzodiazepines, barbiturates and general anaesthetics. Recognition of the heterogeneity of GABAA receptors has opened up new possibilities for the development of more selective therapeutic agents. In particular, subtype-specific receptor ligands varying in intrinsic activity are likely to give rise to fewer side effects than do currently available drugs.",

In one patient alone they were associated with partial motor crises. EEG showed typical hypsarrhythmia in 8 cases, asymmetrical hypsarrhythmia in 1 case and modified hypsarrhythmia in another case. Seven patients were given ACTH, associated with valproic acid in 4 cases and benzodiazepines in 2 cases. The remaining 3 patients were treated with valproate as the only drug. The IS disappeared and the EEG became normal within 14 days of the start of treatment in 9 patients who remain symptom-free after between 2 and 11.9 years follow-up. In one patient there was partial control of the spasms, and the clinical picture cleared up 10 months after starting treatment with vigabatrine. All 10 patients had spastic quadriplegia.

    "48": "The nonselective benzodiazepine (BZ) agonist diazepam is a potent inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity in the rat striatum. To examine this inhibitory action of diazepam further, its effects were examined in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned animals, which reportedly exhibit sensitization of the striatal AC pathway. As previously observed, inhibition of AC activity by diazepam was biphasic, with the first phase being receptor-mediated, whereas the second phase involves a direct action on the enzyme itself. In the presence of NaCl (120 mM), a marked sensitization to the receptor-mediated inhibitory effect of diazepam on AC activity was observed in striatal membranes of lesioned animals. EC50 values were 10.4 +/- 1.1 and 4.8 +/- 0.9 nM (p < 0.05) for intact and lesioned striata, respectively. An examination of [3H]diazepam binding revealed a significant increase in the density of binding sites in denervated striata, with no change in affinity. A time-dependent increase in [alpha-32P]GTP labeling of two distinct striatal proteins with apparent molecular masses of 40 and 45 kDa, suggestive of the alpha subunits of Gi and Gs, respectively, was observed. There was a significant increase in basal [alpha-32P]GTP binding to both proteins in lesioned striata. In addition, diazepam stimulated [alpha-32P]GTP binding to the 40-kDa protein, especially in lesioned striata. These data indicate that the sensitization of the receptor-mediated inhibitory effect of diazepam on AC activity in denervated striata may involve up-regulation of BZ receptors as well as enhanced functional coupling of these receptors to inhibitory G proteins.", 
    "49": "1. Cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin both stimulate gastric somatostatin (SOM) secretion in vitro and thus have the potential to modulate their direct effects on the parietal cell. However, the relative potencies and the mechanisms of action of CCK and gastrin on SOM secretion in vivo have not been determined. 2. The objectives of the present study were to compare the in vivo potencies of the sulphated(s) and non-sulphated (ns) forms of gastrin heptadecapeptide (G-17) and CCK octapeptide (CCK-8) on SOM secretion, and to determine the nature of the receptors involved by repeating the studies in the presence of the CCK-A and CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonists L-364,718 and L-365,260, respectively. All experiments were performed in the chronically cannulated sheep. 3. Dose-response experiments revealed the following potencies for SOM secretion: G-17s = CCK-8s > G-17 ns > CCK-8ns. However, based on the plasma levels achieved and a higher metabolic clearance rate (MCR) for CCK, CCK-8s was the most potent. 4. Both the CCK-A and CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonists suppressed CCK-8s-stimulated SOM output. In contrast, G-17s-stimulated SOM output was inhibited by only the CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonist. 5. Both receptor antagonists increased basal plasma gastrin and CCK levels. 6. The predominant circulating SOM molecular form after both gastrin and CCK stimulation was SOM-14. 7. In conclusion, the sulphated forms of CCK and gastrin are more potent than the non-sulphated forms. Despite sharing a common biologically active carboxy terminus, CCK stimulates SOM secretion by both the CCK-A and CCK-B/gastrin receptors, while gastrin acts via the CCK-B/gastrin receptor alone. These findings explain in part why CCK is a net inhibitor of gastric acid secretion in vivo.", 
    "50": "An approach to determine the stability of benzodiazepines and some of their metabolites (n = 13) by means of a routinely applied gas chromatographic method using electron capture detection was made in this preliminary study. Validation data of the method are given. Spiked blood and plasma samples were stored at 4 degrees C and analysed at selected times up to 240 days. The concentrations of all analytes had decreased to at least 60% of the original levels at the end of the observation period. A clear pattern of breakdown could not be established. The data obtained suggest that results from long-term stored samples should be interpreted cautiously. Further investigations concerning the stability of drugs in blood and plasma samples, additional methods of identification and determination as well as the establishment of optimal storage conditions seem necessary.", 
    "51": "1. GABA-mediated inhibitory responses were induced in spontaneously active Purkinje cells by parallel fibre stimulation in cerebellar slices or in urethane-anaesthetised rats. Effects of agonist and inverse agonist benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor ligands were compared in the preparations. 2. Purkinje cells fired simple spikes at higher rates in slice preparations while complex spikes were seldom (in vivo) or never observed (slice). Cells fired more regularly in vivo resulting in the occurrence of rhythmic postinhibitory responses in the PSTH analysis in some preparations. 3. Single pulse stimulation of parallel fibres at just suprathreshold intensity induced inhibition of Purkinje cell activity in both preparations. At lower firing rates there was a marked increase in the duration of this response, which was more evident in vivo where more slowly firing cells were encountered. 4. BDZ receptor ligands modified inhibitory responses in slice preparations with only weak effects on the firing rates of the cells. These compounds predominately induced changes in firing rate in the anaesthetised rat with little evidence of direct modification of GABA-mediated synaptic transmission. 5. In a few experiments, following injection of the partial inverse agonists beta-CCE and beta-CCM, block of the inhibitory response was observed independent of changes in firing rate. Bidirectional efficacy of BDZ receptor ligand (agonists decrease firing and increase inhibitory response, inverse agonists increase firing and decrease inhibitory response) was demonstrated for modulation of inhibitory responses in slices and for changes in firing rate in vivo. The increased firing rate response in vivo was biphasic the magnitude of the later phase being correlated with efficacy of inverse agonists. 6. It is concluded that cerebellar slice preparations are more appropriate for studying direct effects of BDZ receptor ligands on GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition than in vivo preparations.", 
    "52": "This study a) compared the effects of buprenorphine versus methadone maintenance on benzodiazepine and alcohol use and b) evaluated the prognostic significance of gender and psychopathology and their interaction with maintenance treatment. Eighty male and 36 female patients were randomly assigned to daily sublingual buprenorphine (4 or 12 mg) or oral methadone (20 or 65 mg). Maintenance medication was not associated with significant differences in alcohol or benzodiazepine use. Rates of abstinence from illicit opioids were significantly higher for females, within the buprenorphine 4-mg group, females also had significantly better retention, lower rates of opioid-positive urine samples, and higher rates of abstinence from illicit opioids. Lifetime sedative dependence was associated with significantly better retention, decreased rates of cocaine-positive urine samples, and increased rates of cocaine abstinence; among buprenorphine- but not methadone-maintained patients, it was also associated with increased rates of abstinence from illicit opioids.",

Since 1991, parents with a history of drug abuse may be required to submit to urine drug and alcohol testing when ordered by the Family Courts of this province. The objective of this paper is to present this drug testing program and the results of drug testing on 125 clients from 1994-1996. Urine specimens were collected in the parents' residence by a nurse and transferred directly to the laboratory by the collector or a courier. Specimens were screened by immunoassay and TLC followed by GC-MS confirmation. Results were sent directly to the social worker. In the 3,613 urine specimens analyzed, 50.2% of specimens were negative, 45.6% were positive for one or more drug/metabolite and 4.2% of specimens were dilute (creatinine < 25 mg/dL). The distribution of positive results were: cannabinoids (11.5%), cocaine metabolite (5.0%), benzodiazepines (14.5%), codeine/morphine (7.1%), codeine (6.6%), diphenhydramine (2.2%) and ethyl alcohol (1.6%). Drug testing has been considered a success by these agencies since testing provides an objective indication of recent drug use and the overall prevalence of drug use in this drug abusing population has reduced from 100% to < 50%.",

Analyses were performed on samples from twelve named muscles and femoral venous blood. Standard analytical techniques and instrumentation were used throughout. There was marked within-case variability in drug concentrations with highest:lowest concentrations ranging up to 21.7. Overall highest concentrations were found in the diaphragm and mean diaphragm:blood ratios ranged from 1.1 (temazepam, two cases) and 1.2/1.3 (paracetamol, six cases) up to 6.5/13.5 (amitriptyline, three cases) and 5.3/21.3 (propoxyphene, four cases). Excluding the diaphragm, mean muscle:blood ratios ranged from 0.4 (prothiaden), 0.5 (temazepam), and 0.7 (paracetamol) up to 3.7 (temazepam), 4.3 (propoxyphene) and 5.7 (amitriptyline).

    "55": "The distribution of the nitrobenzodiazepines, flunitrazepam, clonazepam and nitrazepam, and their respective 7-amino metabolites were examined in blood, serum, vitreous humor, liver, bile and urine of decedents taking these drugs. Peripheral blood, serum and liver concentrations were not significantly different to each other. However, vitreous concentrations were one-third of blood, while bile concentrations were 5-12 fold higher. Blood, serum and vitreous contained predominantly the 7-amino metabolite, liver contained only the metabolite, while bile contained significant concentrations of both the parent drug and the 7-amino metabolite. Urine contained only small concentrations of parent drug, however, as expected a number of metabolites were detected. Redistribution studies compared the drug concentrations of femoral blood, taken at body admission to the mortuary, with femoral blood taken at autopsy approximately 39 h later in 48 cases. The concentrations of 7-amino metabolites were not significantly different, however the concentrations of parent nitrobenzodiazepines were significantly higher in the admission specimens. In 6 cases in which subclavian blood was taken, the concentrations were not significantly different to the concentrations in admission blood. Similar findings were observed when femoral and subclavian blood concentrations were compared in 6 cases. There was also no apparent difference in total blood concentrations of nitrobenzodiazepines when blood concentrations taken in hospital shortly prior to death were compared to postmortem blood. Postmortem diffusion into peripheral blood is therefore not a confounding factor in the interpretation of nitrobenzodiazepine concentrations.", 
    "56": "Studies were undertaken to determine the stability of nitrobenzodiazepines and their 7-amino metabolites in water and blood. At 22 degrees C nitrazepam and clonazepam were stable in sterile fresh blood containing preservative over 28 days, whereas 25% of flunitrazepam was degraded. At 37 degrees C all three drugs were substantially lost over 9 h (29-51%). There was only a small loss observed for the 7-amino metabolites and no substantial amounts of parent drug and 7-amino metabolite were degraded in water under these conditions. In the absence of preservative substantial amounts (25-50%) of parent drugs were lost in fresh blood over 10 days at 22 degrees C. In bacterially-contaminated postmortem blood all three drugs were completely degraded over 8 h at 22 degrees C with almost all drug completely converted to the respective 7-amino metabolite. These metabolites were also partially degraded (10-20%) over 45 h at 22 degrees C. All 3 nitrobenzodiazepines were stable in blood stored for up to 24 months at -20 degrees C, or 4 degrees C over 10 months. Their respective 7-amino metabolites were, however, relatively unstable at -20 degrees C with a significant loss (29%) after 2 months. At 4 degrees C a 21% loss occurred after 1 month. Freeze/thawing was found not to affect the concentration of nitrobenzodiazepine and 7-amino metabolites. These results show that the nitrobenzodiazepines and their metabolites are unstable chemically and metabolically in blood. We advise that blood collected for the purpose of nitrobenzodiazepine determinations should be preserved with sodium fluoride, stored at -20 degrees C and assayed as soon as practicable, preferably within a week of collection.",

    "62": "Organophosphorus nerve agents are still in use today in warfare and as terrorism compounds. Classical emergency treatment of organophosphate poisoning includes the combined administration of a cholinesterase reactivator (an oxime), a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist (atropine) and a benzodiazepine anticonvulsant (diazepam). However, recent experiments with primates have demonstrated that such treatment, even when administered immediately after organophosphate exposure, does not rapidly restore normal electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and fails to totally prevent neuronal brain damage. The objective of this study was to evaluate, in a realistic setting, the therapeutic benefit of administration of GK-11 (gacyclidine), an antiglutamatergic compound, as a complement to the available emergency therapy against organophosphate poisoning. GK-11 was injected at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg (i.v) after a 45-min latency period to heavily intoxicated (8 LD50) primates. Just after intoxication, man-equivalent doses of one autoinjector containing atropine/pralidoxime/diazepam were administered. The effects of GK-11 were examined on survival, EEG activity, signs of toxicity, recovery after challenge and central nervous system histology. The present data demonstrate that treatment with GK-11 prevents the mortality observed after early administration of classical emergency medication alone. EEG recordings and clinical observations also revealed that GK-11 prevented soman-induced seizures and motor convulsions. EEG analysis within the classical frequency bands (beta, theta, alpha, delta) demonstrated that central activity was totally restored to normal after GK-11 treatment, but remained profoundly altered in animals receiving atropine/pralidoxime/diazepam alone. GK-11 also markedly accelerated clinical recovery of soman-challenged primates. Lastly, this drug totally prevented the neuropathology observed 3 weeks after soman exposure in animals treated with classical emergency treatment alone. GK-11 represents a promising adjuvant therapy to the currently available emergency polymedication to ensure optimal management of organophosphate poisoning in man. This drug is presently being evaluated in a human clinical trial for a different neuroprotective indication.", 
    "63": "This report includes a recalculation of the pooled data of 2 pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of the interaction between the hypnotic midazolam and the antibiotics erythromycin, clarithromycin (macrolides), and azithromycin (an azalide). Erythromycin and clarithromycin similarly and strikingly impaired the metabolism of midazolam and enhanced its pharmacodynamic activity; little or no effect was found with azithromycin. It was concluded that coadministration of midazolam and azithromycin involves less clinical risk than with the 2 macrolides.", 
    "64": "We describe our experience with three patients in chronic renal failure who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery without cardiopulmonary bypass. Anesthesia was maintained with fentanyl and midazolam. Nitroglycerin and prostaglandin E1 were administered during the surgical procedure. When the coronary artery was clamped for the anastomosis of the graft, cardiac output and arterial pressure decreased in all cases. The patients were treated with ephedrine and dobutamine, which restored the hemodynamics. The important points for the anesthetic management for this operation are follows: the adequate administration of the coronary vasodilator, and attention to the change of hemodynamics on clamping the coronary artery.", 
    "65": "The effects of epidural midazolam on heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) were examined. Under alpha-choloralose anesthesia, 31 male Japanese-white rabbits received epidural catheterization and surgical procedures for measurement of the renal sympathetic nerve activity. Epidural low (0.05%) and high (0.5%) concentrations of midazolam did not affect HR, but significantly decreased MAP and RSNA-spikes (the spike count of RSNA). Intravenous flumazenil significantly increased MAP and RSNA-spikes. These findings suggest that the decrease in RSNA-spikes induced by epidural midazolam is derived from the benzodiazepine receptor. Intramuscular midazolam (0.5%) did not affect HR, but decreased MAP and RSNA-spikes significantly. In the spinal cord dissected rabbits, epidural midazolam (0.5%) did not affect HR and MAP, but significantly attenuated RSNA-spikes. In conclusion, epidural midazolam attenuated RSNA through the benzodiazepine receptors of both the spinal and supraspinal nervous system.", 
    "66": "The goal of the studies described was to evaluate the role of NMDA receptor-mediated glutamate excitotoxicity in the pathogenesis of selective neuronal loss due to thiamine deficiency. Administration of the central thiamine antagonist pyrithiamine to adult male rats resulted in a sequence of neurological symptoms including ataxia and loss of righting reflex followed by convulsions. Prior to the onset of convulsions, neuropathologic evaluation revealed significant neuronal loss in the ventral posterior medial thalamic nucleus. However, in vivo cerebral microdialysis at preconvulsive stages did not demonstrate significant increases of extracellular glutamate in this region and pretreatment with the NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 (1 mg/ kg/12 h, i.p.) did not afford significant neuroprotection. Following the onset of convulsions, microdialysate glutamate concentrations were increased fivefold (P > 0.05) and MK801 treatment resulted in significant attenuation of neuronal loss in some thalamic nuclei. A comparable degree of neuroprotection was afforded by pretreatment with an anticonvulsant dose of diazepam (10 mg/kg/12 h, i.p.) a compound whose action is not NMDA receptor mediated. These findings suggest that NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity is not responsible for early selective neuronal loss in this model of thiamine deficiency encephalopathy and that the neuroprotective effect of MK801 at later stages are at least in part a consequence of its anticonvulsant properties.", 
    "67": "Locomotor activity and antidepressant-like effect in the forced swim test (FST) of 5-HT(1A) agonist LY 228729 were investigated in adult rats prenatally exposed at doses of diazepam (DZ) and alprazolam (ALP) which induce persistent downregulation of GABA/ benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors. Prenatal exposure to ALP and DZ did not modify the efficacy of subchronic LY 228729 to decrease immobility time in the FST. Prenatal DZ and ALP potentiated the facilitatory effect of subchronic LY 228729 on locomotor activity; prenatal DZ was more effective than prenatal ALP. Moreover, prenatal DZ increased stereotypic movements induced by LY 228729. These data suggest that the persistent downregulation of GABA/BZ receptors, induced by prenatal BZs, does not play a role in the anti-immobility effect in the FST of 5-HT(1A) agonist LY 228729 while it can increase locomotor activity and stereotypic movements. Moreover, this study indicates that increases in locomotor activity do not seem to influence the anti-immobility effect in the FST of LY 228729 in rats.", 
    "68": "The M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine in low doses decreases resting heart rate; this effect declines with age (Poller, U., G. Nedelka, J. Radke, K. P\u00f6nicke, and O.-E. Brodde. 1997. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 29:187-193). To study possible mechanisms underlying this effect, we assessed (a) in six young (26 yr old) and six older volunteers (61 yr old), pirenzepine effects (0.32 and 0.64 mg intravenous [i.v.] bolus) on isoprenaline-induced heart rate increases; (b) in five heart transplant recipients, pirenzepine effects (0.05-10 mg i.v. bolus) on resting heart rate in the recipient's native and transplanted sinus nodes; and (c) in right atria from 39 patients of different ages (5 d-76 yr) undergoing open heart surgery, M2 muscarinic receptor density (by [3H]N-methyl-scopolamine binding) and adenylyl cyclase activity. (a) Pirenzepine at both doses decreased heart rate in young volunteers significantly more than in older volunteers; (b) pirenzepine (< 1 mg) decreased resting heart rate in the recipient's native but not transplanted sinus node; and (c) M2 receptor density and carbachol-induced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity decreased significantly with the age of the patients. We conclude that pirenzepine decreases heart rate via inhibition of presynaptic M1 autoreceptors, thereby releasing endogenous acetylcholine, and that the heart rate-decreasing effect of acetylcholine declines with age because right atrial M2 receptor density and function decrease.", 
    "69": "The cardiopulmonary effects of the intravenous administration of clonidine (15 micrograms/kg), ST-91 (30 micrograms/kg) and diazepam (0.4 mg/kg) were compared in five healthy sheep using a randomized cross-over design, to determine whether the hypoxaemic effects of alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonists are due to sedation, or to peripheral alpha 2 adrenoceptor stimulation. All three drugs significantly lowered arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) levels within 2 min of their administration; however, clonidine and ST-91 produced long lasting and severe hypoxaemia with mean PaO2 levels of approximately equal to 40 mm Hg and 50 mm Hg (5.3 kPa and 6.6 kPa), respectively. The fall in PaO2 was considerably less with diazepam (63 mm Hg or 8.4 kPa at 2 min) and by 15 min the values did not differ from placebo treated animals. None of the drugs increased arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) levels when compared to saline treatment and the acid base variables did not show any significant change. A significant increase was recorded in the packed cell volume of the ST-91 treated group throughout the study. Within 2 min of their administration, all drugs caused a significant increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) as compared to the placebo treated group. The MAP remained significantly increased for 5 and 60 min after clonidine and ST-91 treatment, respectively. The study shows that ST-91 and clonidine produce a greater degree of hypoxaemia than occurs with diazepam sedation, and that the hypoxaemic effect of alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonists in sheep are mainly mediated by peripheral alpha 2 adrenoceptors.", 
    "70": "Mammalian albumins have two main structurally selective ligand binding sites. Site I binds drugs such as azapropazone, phenylbutazone and warfarin; whereas benzodiazepines, some dansyl amino acids, such as dansylsarcosine, and short chain fatty acids like octanoic acid interact with site II. However, it is not known if non-mammalian albumins have similar binding loci. In this study, drug binding sites on chicken albumin were investigated using site selective fluorescent probes (warfarin and dansylsarcosine) and p-nitrophenyl acetate (NPA); the hydrolysis of which is selectively inhibited by site II ligands. Azapropazone and phenylbutazone decreased the binding of warfarin and dansylsarcosine to a similar extent. Diazepam and octanoic acid also inhibited binding of the two fluorescent probes in a non-selective manner. However, the fluorescence intensity of the warfarin-chicken albumin complex decreased when the pH was increased from 6.0-9.0; but by contrast, the fluorescence of bound dansylsarcosine remained unchanged. Furthermore, the hydrolysis of NPA was selectively inhibited by dansylsarcosine, diazepam and octanoic acid (ligands selective for site II on mammalian albumins), but not by site I selective ligands such as azapropazone and warfarin. Overall, the results suggest that chicken albumin, like mammalian albumins, has discrete binding sites for warfarin and dansylsarcosine.", 
    "71": "The vasodilating effects of tetrazepam (1,4-benzodiazepine derivative) were studied and compared with those of the K-channel activator, cromakalim and the Ca-channel blocker, diltiazem, in rat aorta smooth muscle and on the spontaneous contractile activity of the rat portal vein. In the aorta, tetrazepam (3 x 10(-7)-10(-4) M) and diltiazem (10(-8)-3 x 10(-6) M) concentration-dependently relaxed aortic rings contracted by 30 mM as well as 80 m KCl. Although cromakalim (10(-8)-3 x 10(-6) M) concentration-dependently relaxed aortic rings contracted by 30 mM KCl, it did not relax those contrated by 80 mm KCl. In the presence of the ATP-sensitive K-channel blocker, glibenclamide (10(-6) and 3 x 10(-6) M), 30 mM KCl concentration-response curves for the relaxant effect of tetrazepam and diltiazem were unaffected but cromakalim caused a progressive shift of these curves upwards. In the portal vein, tetrazepam inhibited spontaneous contractions, decreased amplitude and increased frequency. Similar behaviour was shown with diltiazem (10(-8)-10(-5) M) and in both cases, pre-treatment with glibenclamide (10(-6) M) was ineffective. Although cromakalim (10(-5)-10(-6) M) decreased both amplitude and frequency, this effect was blocked by glibenclamide. These results indicate that the vasodilator action of tetrazepam is not mediated to the opening of ATP-sensitive K-channels, unlike cromakalim. This may be mediated, like those of diltiazem, by the blockade of calcium movements across the cell membrane.", 
    "72": "A model was developed to estimate the medical costs and effectiveness outcomes of three antipsychotic treatments (olanzapine, haloperidol, and risperidone) for patients with schizophrenia. A decision analytic Markov model was used to determine the cost-effectiveness of treatments and outcomes that patients treated for schizophrenia may experience over a 5-year period. Model parameter estimates were based on clinical trial data, published medical literature, and, when needed, clinician judgment. Direct medical costs were incorporated into the model, and outcomes were expressed by using three effectiveness indicators: the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, quality-adjusted life years, and lack of relapse. Over a 5-year period, patients on olanzapine had an additional 6.8 months in a disability-free health state based on Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores and more than 2 additional months in a disability-free health state based on quality-adjusted life years, and they experienced 13% fewer relapses compared with patients on haloperidol. The estimated 5-year medical cost associated with olanzapine therapy was $1,539 less than that for haloperidol therapy. Compared with risperidone therapy, olanzapine therapy cost $1,875 less over a 5-year period. Patients on olanzapine had approximately 1.6 weeks more time in a disability-free health state (based on Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores) and 2% fewer relapses compared with patients on risperidone. Sensitivity analyses indicated the model was sensitive to changes in drug costs and shortened hospital stay. Compared with both haloperidol and risperidone therapy, olanzapine therapy was less expensive and provided superior effectiveness outcomes even with conservative values for key parameters such as relapse and discontinuation rates.",

Using steroidogenic cell submitochondrial fractions, mitochondrial preparations, various cell models, and animal models and with the help of pharmacological, biochemical, morphological, and molecular approaches, we provide evidence that the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor mediates the intramitochondrial cholesterol transport and the subsequent adrenal, gonadal, placental, and brain steroid biosynthesis.",

Previous investigations showed the anaesthetic potency of (S)-ketamine to be three times higher than that of (R)-ketamine. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of (S)-ketamine/midazolam and racemic ketamine/midazolam on endocrine and cardiovascular parameters, recovery, and side effects in unpremedicated patients during knee surgery.", 
    "75": "41 patients scheduled for elective knee surgery were investigated in a prospective, double-blind, and randomised design. For induction of intravenous anesthesia, patients received 0.1 mg/kg midazolam, 0.003 mg/kg atropine, 1 mg/kg (S)-ketamine or 2 mg/kg racemic ketamine, respectively. For tracheal intubation, 1 mg vecuronium and 1.5 mg/kg suxamethonium were injected. After intubation and relaxation with a total dose of 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium, a continuous infusion of 0.5 mg/kg/h (S)- or 1 mg/kg/h racemic ketamine was administered throughout the surgery. In addition, 0.05 mg/kg/h midazolam was infused continuously in both groups throughout surgery. Ventilation was performed with N2O/O2 (FiO2 0.3). Blood samples were taken using a central venous line five times before induction as well as during and after surgery for analysis of adrenaline, noradrenaline (by high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection), anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol (by radioimmunoassay). In addition, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure (SAP, DAP), heart rate (HR), and arterial oxygen saturation were measured. The time intervals between the end of ketamine and midazolam infusion and the return of consciousness and orientation were recorded. The incidence and quality of dreams and other side effects were reported by the patients.",

BW1003C87 (2.5-10 mg/kg, i.p.) had potent and long-lasting (48 h after single administration) effects on amygdala-kindled seizures. The effects of BW1003C87 were completely reversed when the stimulus intensity was increased to 2 or 3 times the threshold determined. Since the same effects on seizure threshold were obtained for phenytoin and carbamazepine in the present study and for lamotrigine in our previous study, we propose that the principal mechanism of these antiepileptic drugs, which act primarily on voltage-sensitive Na+ channels, is significant elevation of the seizure threshold in epileptogenic foci and that BW1003C87 has a profile similar to that of these drugs.", 
    "78": "The effect of pivagabine (4-[(2,2-dimethyl-1-oxopropyl)amino]butanoic acid, CAS 69542-93-4, Tonerg), a synthetic molecule with neuromodulatory activity, was evaluated on a series of behavioural parameters in rats exposed to various stimuli, with the aim of evaluating the response to stress (open field exploration, water maze, psychic conflict), conditioning (active and passive avoidance and avoidance retention, aggressiveness, extinction of conditioned responses), learning and performing of specific psychophysical tests (rota-rod, ballasted swimming, taut thread). Pivagabine induced significant improvement of stress-related tests by reducing the anxiety-producing reactions related to the various experimental settings. In conditioning tests an improvement in learning of conditioned responses was observed at lower dosages (10 and 50 mg/kg); an opposite effect was obtained with higher dosages (100 and 200 mg/kg). Pivagabine did not influence the retention nor the extinction of conditioned responses. Pivagabine induced a marked improvement of all motor performance tests in young and in aged animals. By contrast with benzodiazepines, pivagabine did not alter the ability of learning tasks, the motor performance and the aggressive behaviours. It is likely that the observed effects of pivagabine are mediated by inhibition of release of corticotropin-releasing factor, a neurohormone involved in stress-generating mechanisms.",

    "80": "In this study we investigated the relationship between penicillin-induced hypothermia and petit mal epilepsy induced by this proconvulsant antibiotic. In order to find a possible dose-dependent relationship, we used two doses: 1500.000 and 1000.000 U/kg b.wt., both known as being sufficient to induce absence-like attacks with subsequent spike and wave discharges (SWD) in electrocorticogram (ECoG). Because of experimental data suggesting penicillin binding to benzodiazepine receptor recognition site, we also studied penicillin-induced changes in body temperature after diazepam pretreatment. Results of this study clearly show that penicillin in doses known to induce petit mal-like epilepsy concomitantly induces statistically significant dose-dependent decrease in body temperature. Pretreatment with diazepam completely prevents both penicillin-induced hypothermia and SWDs. On the other hand, both the diazepam and mixed diazepam + penicillin treatments did not significantly alter body temperature. These results suggest, however, that at least some of the penicillin effects described could be assigned to its binding to the benzodiazepine receptor recognition site at GABA(A) ionophore. This may have an important clinical implication because the inhibitory action of penicillin at the benzodiazepine receptor recognition site could account for the mechanism of penicillin-induced unspecific encephalopathies in humans. The relationship between petit mal epilepsy and hypothermia sheds new light on the action mechanisms of penicillin-induced absence seizures.", 
    "81": "Benzodiazepines have been shown to inhibit salivary secretion from the rat salivary gland. This action is mediated by specific benzodiazepine binding sites in the glands. The presence and characteristics of central- and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors in rat parotid and submandibular glands were examined employing [3H]Ro15-1788 and [3H]PK11195 as radioligands. [3H]Ro15-1788 and [3H]PK11195 bound with high affinity for both salivary glands ([3H]Ro15-1788: 24.5 and 37.4 mM, [3H]PK11195: 1.37 and 1.88 nM, for parotid and submandibular glands, respectively). [3H]Ro15-1788 binding sites occupied only 0.22 to 0.43% of the total binding for benzodiazepine receptors in the glands. The rank order of the competing potency of [3H]Ro15-1788 binding (Ro15-1788 = clonazepam > diazepam > flunitrazepam > PK11195 > Ro5-4864) and [3H]PK11195 binding (Ro5-4864 = PK11195 > diazepam = flunitrazepam > clonazepam) demonstrated that [3H]Ro15-1788 and [3H]PK11195 binding sites were characteristic of the central and peripheral type, respectively. These studies show that both central- and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors exist in rat parotid and submandibular glands.",

A decision tree for current practice in the rapid tranquilization of agitated, apparently psychotic patients is described.", 
    "83": "As antipsychotic treatment evolves toward a broader range of efficacy and more benign side effect profiles, our criteria for treatment-refractory schizophrenia may become more subtle. Unidimensional concepts of treatment resistance may be replaced by multiaxial descriptions of the target symptoms, side effects, and compliance issues that limit the ultimate goals of enhanced psychosocial function and quality of life. Augmentation strategies, increasing insight into dose response relationships, and atypical agents may benefit patients who failed to respond to or tolerate previous therapies. The advantages of newer agents in treatment-resistant schizophrenia may arise in part from their preferential targeting of newer agents in treatment-resistant schizophrenia may arise in part from their preferential targeting of mesolimbic compared with motor and tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic pathways.",

Data for each of 252 past medication trials included dose, duration of treatment, side effects, outcome, and reason for discontinuation. T tests and chi-square analyses were used to compare demographic and clinical characteristics of patients failing versus responding to adequate trials and those with and without intolerable medication side effects.", 
    "86": "Of 252 medication trials, 190 used effective antipanic medications, and only 59 (23%) were adequate in dose and duration. The most common reason for treatment failure was intolerable side effects, occurring in 51 (27%) of 190 trials using effective antipanic medications. Patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse effects had higher Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety scores and were less likely to have a history of substance abuse. Discontinuation due to side effects was significantly more common with tricyclic antidepressants than with benzodiazepines. True treatment resistance was reported in 14 (24%) of 59 adequate medication trials. Treatment-resistant patients were younger and had a higher lifetime rate of major depression.", 
    "87": "Although use of ineffective medications or inadequate trials were important factors, the most common reason for treatment failure was side effects, especially with tricyclic antidepressants. True treatment resistance was less common, since few medication trials were adequate in dose and duration, and may be associated with comorbidity.",

Each receptor/channel complex is an assembly of five protein subunits. Six subunit classes have been identified, each containing one to six members; many combinations are expressed throughout the brain. Benzodiazepines and intravenous anesthetic agents are clearly subunit dependent, but the literature to date suggests that volatile anesthetics are not. The physiological role of the delta subunit remains enigmatic, and it has not been examined as a determinant of anesthetic sensitivity.",

Dose-response plots were bell shaped. Compared with alphabeta gamma receptors (EC50 = 225 microM), both alphabeta delta (EC50 = 372 microM) and alphabeta gammadelta (EC50 = 399 microM) had a reduced affinity for isoflurane. Isoflurane (at a concentration close to the EC50 for each subunit) increased the affinity of GABA for its receptor but depressed the maximal response (alphabeta gamma and alphabeta gammadelta). In contrast, the small currents through alphabeta delta receptors were enhanced, even at saturating agonist concentrations.",

The non-sedated patients exhibited no memory loss for the surgical procedure. Recall of the surgery was very variable among the sedated patients, from some remembering all aspects, to others with no recollection after the venepuncture. Overall, the sedated patients exhibited significantly greater amnesia for the surgical procedure. The degree of amnesia in the sedated group was also investigated with respect to pretreatment anxiety levels, sedation level achieved and the dose of midazolam administered. The first two variables did not exhibit any effect on the memory loss, but higher doses (> 5 mg) were associated with more consistent amnesia especially for the later stages of the procedure.",

    "98": "It is known that a methanol/water mixture has a quaternary organization consisting of free water W, free methanol M, and two types of methanol/water clusters. A 1:1 methanol/water cluster has been observed at a high methanol concentration, and a 5:1 cluster has been observed at a low methanol concentration. In the water fraction range used in this paper, 0.2-0.7, the number of MW(5) clusters was always inferior to the number of MW clusters. When a weak polar solute is introduced into such a mixture, it is preferentially solvated by free methanol and the MW water clusters. Using this mixture as the mobile phase, a novel mathematical theory is presented to describe, in this water fraction range, the variations of the retention factor k' of alkyl benzoate esters and benzodiazepines in reversed-phase liquid chromatography. Excellent predictions of k' versus free methanol and methanol/water fractions were obtained. For the first time, using this model, enthalpy, entropy, and the Gibbs free energy of the two solute solvation processes were evaluated. Enthalpy-entropy compensation revealed that the main parameters determining retention in the range of the water fraction (0.2-0.7) increased as follows:\u2009 free methanol \u2194 solute solvation > methanol/water cluster \u2194 solute solvation > RP18 stationary phase \u2194 solute interaction. These results agree well with values obtained when ACN was used instead of methanol.",

As primary premedication they received either zolpidem 8.03 mg or zolpidem 16.06 mg or dipotassium clorazepate 10 mg or dipotassium clorazepate 20 mg or placebo. The secondary premedication was either promethazine 50 mg or placebo. The tablets/dragees were given in the evening before surgery (09.00 p.m.-10.00 p.m.). Every cell of the 5 x 2-factorial design contained 16 men and 16 women. Emotions were measured by a multidimensional rating scale, comprising the aspects elated mood, anxiety, hostility, deactivation, vigilance and introversion. In addition, somatic symptoms and the quality of sleep were measured. Statistics were performed using multivariate analysis of variance.", 
    "101": "No differing effects of zolpidem and dipotassium clorazepate on preoperative mood were found. There was also no difference compared with placebo. Compared with placebo, promethazin leads to greater deactivation. Specific emotions were not affected. In somatic aspects there was a greater amount of cholinergic effects under promethazine, which was mainly expressed by a higher intensity of a dry mouth and weakness in general. Compared with placebo all of the tested drugs led to a better quality of sleep.", 
    "102": "Using multidimensional rating scales and considering emotions as a multifactorial construct, the study shows no different effects of benzodiazepines or benzodiazepin-like drugs on preoperative mood. No differences were also found on comparing these drugs with placebo. However, a better quality of sleep was seen under zolpidem and dipotassium clorazepate compared with placebo. The study shows that a combination with promethazine is recommended, because promethazine has a selective deactivating effect. The study stresses the significance of multidimensional rating scales for the measurement of emotions before anaesthesia.", 
    "103": "The scientific approach to preoperative stress includes the identification of stressors and the measurement of stress responses. The stress responses include physiological (sympathetic nervous system, hypothalamic--hypophyseal and adrenocortical system), psychological (anxiety, depression etc.) and behavioural ones. The choice of variables to be measured should allow answers for our questions, i.e., they must be adequate and economic, without or only minimal disturbance of the preoperative situation. The value of physiological and biochemical parameters is often overestimated. Their assessment is indicated in special scientific settings. For simple questions such as premedication studies, the measurement of blood pressure and heart rate is sufficient. Anxiety should be self-estimated by the patient, using visual analogue scales, questionnaires or adjective check lists. Depression and other emotional stress responses can be assessed if necessary. For physicians and nurses, an observation of the patient's behavioural stress responses is a useful criterion for assessing patient stress. One important stress-reducing approach is prevention: identification and avoidance of stressors. This includes organisation and a high degree of self-control by the medical personnel. Premedication with benzodiazepines is the most successful pharmacological approach.",

    "106": "Bimoclomol (BRLP-42) is a novel antiischemic compound acting against peripheral vascular complications of diabetes mellitus (neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy). In the present study the activity of bimoclomol was tested in experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and arachidonic acid (AA)-induced brain edema in rats to elucidate whether the compound may also have beneficial effect in cerebrovascular disturbances. For comparison, a neuroprotective AMPA antagonist, GYKI-52466, was examined. Injury caused by autologous intracranial blood injection or sodium-arachidonate was evaluated by the damage of blood-brain barrier (BBB) reflected in the extravasation of Evans blue dye into the cerebral tissue. Bimoclomol (2 x 2 mg/kg IV) markedly reduced, while GYKI-52466 (2 x 2 mg/kg IV) moderately diminished the extravasation produced by SAH (39.9%, p < 0.01 and 26.7%, p > 0.05, respectively). In the case of AA-induced brain edema, bimoclomol showed less pronounced (19.6%, p < 0.05) inhibitory action, and GYKI-52466 seemed to be more effective (34.2%, p < 0.05). These results suggest that bimoclomol may be active not only in peripheral micro- and macroangiopathy, but also in some types of cerebrovascular disorders.", 
    "107": "Drug-induced facilitation of exploration of a two-compartment black and white test box was studied in mice applying different stressors before test. Tail suspension suppressed exploration of both compartments and enhanced diazepam- or eltoprazine-induced increase of exploration of the white compartment. (-)-Penbutolol reversed the effects of eltoprazine suggesting involvement of 5-HT(1A/1B) receptors. Buspirone had weak effects both under standard conditions, and after tail suspension. Ritanserin suppressed exploratory behavior, and this effect was potentiated by tail suspension. In conclusion, application of acute tail suspension stress immediately before test in the black and white box enhanced the sensitivity to drugs. In contrast to this, forced swimming suppressed general behavioral activity, but in this case diazepam facilitated the behavior in both compartments. Foot shocks immediately before test reduced activity in the black compartment and did not affect the behavior in the white compartment. Thus different acute stressors modified behavior in the black and white box differently. Chronic stress (crowded housing) produced an anxiolytic-like response.", 
    "108": "A number of A-ring-reduced metabolites of deoxycorticosterone and progesterone, known to exert agonist activity at the GABA(A) receptor complex, have been reported to reduce anxiety-related behavior in rodents. In the present study, the behavioral selectivity of these effects was assessed in an ethological version of the mouse elevated plus-maze paradigm. Anxiolytic-like profiles, characterised principally by reductions in open arm avoidance measures, were observed following systemic treatment with 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha, 21-diol-20-one (5alpha,3alpha-THDOC; 5.0 and 20.0 mg/kg), 5beta-pregnan-3,20-dione (5beta-DHP; 10-20 mg/kg), 5beta-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one (pregnanolone; 20 mg/kg), and 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one (allopregnanolone; 10-20 mg/kg). In contrast, 5alpha-pregnan-3,20-dione (5alpha-DHP; 10.0-20.0 mg/kg) and 5alpha-pregnan-3beta-ol-20-one (2.5-20.0 mg/kg) were without effect under present test conditions. Detailed behavioral analysis further showed that the antianxiety effects of 5alpha,3alpha-THDOC, 5alpha-DHP, pregnanolone and allopregnanolone were not associated with changes in general activity levels. In addition, profile comparisons revealed that the anxiolytic steroids tend to produce a narrower range of behavioral effects than diazepam (1.0 mg/kg) and, in particular, do not reliably decrease measures of risk assessment. It is concluded that neuroactive steroids produce anxioselective effects in the mouse plus-maze and that their profile of action can at least partially be distinguished from that of a well-characterised benzodiazepine.", 
    "109": "Previous studies have demonstrated an innate difference in the sensitivity of ethanol-naive P and NP rats to the acute intoxicating effects of high doses of ethanol. A number of studies have suggested that the acute intoxicating effects of ethanol may be mediated in part through potentiation of GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor function. In the present study, the function of GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptors was studied in ethanol-naive alcohol-preferring (P) and -nonpreferring (NP) lines of rats by measuring 36Cl- influx into cortical microsacs. GABA, in a concentration-dependent manner, increased 36Cl- influx to an equivalent extent into cortical microsacs from P and NP rats (EC50 = 9.0 +/- 1.0 and 10 +/- 1.1 microM; Emax = 30.8 +/- 1.3 and 28.1 +/- 0.9 nmol Cl-/mg protein/3 s, respectively). Pentobarbital (30 microM) enhanced GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake (75 and 71% increase for P and NP rats, respectively) equally well in cortical microsacs from P and NP rats. Likewise, phenobarbital potentiation of GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx was similar in cortical microsacs from P and NP rats. Phenobarbital, at the highest concentration tested (3 mM), directly stimulated 36Cl- influx to a similar extent in P and NP rats. However, ethanol failed to alter GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake into cortical microsacs prepared from ethanol-naive P and NP rats. The present results suggest that the differences between P and NP rats in innate sensitivity to the high dose effects of ethanol do not appear to be due to differences in cortical GABA(A) receptor function.", 
    "110": "The hedonic properties of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) were examined using the place conditioning and the taste conditioning paradigms. Following four conditioning trials, CDP (5-20 mg/kg) produced a conditioned place aversion in an \"unbiased\" paradigm in which the chamber paired with CDP was counterbalanced among two equally preferred chambers. In a \"biased\" place-conditioning paradigm, CDP (5 and 20 mg/ kg) prevented the dissipation of the natural aversion to the nonpreferred chamber. Finally, although CDP unconditionally potentiated sucrose consumption, it produced a sucrose aversion in the taste reactivity test and sucrose avoidance in the taste avoidance test when the taste conditionally preceded injections of CDP. The pattern of findings suggest that, when novel to rats, CDP is hedonically aversive.", 
    "111": "The benzodiazepine flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) was employed to control differentially discriminative performance in 10 Sprague-Dawley rats on a food-motivated FR10 schedule. The training dose was 2.5 mg/kg, and 20 min was employed between intraperitoneal administration and training; both values were employed in this study, which, in reality, is the first time in the drug discrimination literature for the training of this drug. Dose-response experiments indicated decreasing discriminative performance in concert with decreasing time to reach FR10 lever selection as the dose tested decreased from 2.5 to 0.04 mg/kg. The calculated ED50 for discriminative performance, i.e., lever selection of the drug-correct lever, was 0.076 mg/kg. The relatively few sessions needed to reach discrimination criterion, and the fact that the ED50 value was 1/33 of the training dose, suggests that a lower dose of Rohypnol may be used in the future to train rats in this paradigm. Time course experiments indicate decreasing discriminative performance from 20-240 min postadministration with a calculated half-life of 162.3 min. Administration of 450, 600, and 900 mg/kg ethanol (10% w/v) I.P. produced saline-like discriminative responding, whereas the combination of these doses with the 0.08 mg/kg Rohypnol dose produced increasing discriminative performance with the highest ethanol dose producing 72.2% Rohypnol-appropriate lever selections in a mean time to attain lever selection on the FR10 schedule of 12.8 s. These results suggest that a lower training dose of Rohypnol may allow for testing of a smaller ED50 Rohypnol dose with ethanol to produce a more complete generalization. The ability of flumenazil (Ro 15-1788) to dose dependently block the discrimination of Rohypnol suggests that this benzodiazepine produces its action by its agonistic efficacy at these receptors. The coadministration of Rohypnol and ethanol as a popular drug combination in humans is discussed, and evidence is offered as to their synergistic interactions in rat discrimination.",

Tube C, D and E contained, 0.4 mg/l, 4.0 mg/l and 40.0 mg/l of diazepam in culture medium respectively. The mean effective diazepam concentration in plasma is 0.4 mg/l. CBF was measured photometrically. The most vigorous cilia were measured in 5 areas taking 10 readings on each sample, 30 minutes and 1 hour after mixing. Standard deviation (SD) and confidence limits were calculated along with significance testing (p < 0.05) using the paired t-test and ANOVA. The mean of the CBF of tubes A and B were 13.44 (SD 2.65) and 13.67 (SD 2.48). There was a reduction of the CBF with increasing concentrations of diazepam at 30 minutes, 11.32 (SD 2.14), 10.29 (SD 1.58) and 4.14 (SD 1.57) tubes C. D and E respectively. There was a significant lowering in CBF of 17% (p < 0.01) of diazepam at the mean effective plasma level (tube C) when compared against the controls. CBF decreased over time and at 1 hour was 10.57 (SD, 1.36), 9.02 (SD, 1.39) and 3.58 (SD, 1.31) tubes C, D and E respectively. A proposed mechanism of altered intracellular calcium flux via the action diazepam on GABA receptors is described.", 
    "113": "In order to assess the significance of drug levels measured in clinical and forensic toxicology as well as for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) it is essential that good collections of data are readily available. For more than 500 frequently used drugs therapeutic and, if data was available, toxic, and fatal plasma concentrations as well as elimination half-lives were compiled in a table. The compilation includes data for hypnotics like barbiturates and benzodiazepines, diphenhydramine, neuroleptics, antidepressants, sedatives, analgesics, antiinflammatory agents (e.g., NSAIDs), antihistamines, antiepileptics, betaadrenergic antagonists, antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, gyrase inhibitors), diuretics, calcium-channel blockers, cardiac glycosides, antiarrhythmics, antiasthmatics, ACE-inhibitors, opiate agonists, and local anesthetics, among others. In addition, some toxicological relevant xenobiotics were listed. Data have been abstracted from published information, both compilations and primary sources and have been completed with data collected in our own forensic and clinical toxicology laboratories. Wherever possible, ranges for therapeutic plasma concentrations are expressed as trough concentration at steady state. The half-life values given for each drug are chosen to represent the terminal log-linear phase at most. It is the purpose to rapidly assess the significance of drug levels for the therapeutic monitoring of patients, and to facilitate the diagnostic assessment in case of intoxications.", 
    "114": "Abnormalities of platelet serotonin (5-HT) transporter, which are supposed to reflect similar dysfunctions in the central nervous system (CNS), have been reported in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Other platelet parameters altered in OCD are represented by phenolsulfotransferase (PST) activity, an enzyme involved in the catabolism of catecholic neuro-transmitters, and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. Since no information is available on the behavior of these putative markers during antiobsessive treatments, the aim of the present study was to measure and compare 3H-imipramine (3H-IMI) binding, which labels the 5-HT transporter, PST activity, and 3H-PK 11,195 binding, which labels peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, in a group of 18 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) before and after a treatment with fluvoxamine versus clomipramine. The results showed that at baseline the patients had a decreased number of 3H-IMI binding sites, which correlated negatively with the Y-BOCS total score, an increased PST activity and no difference in 3H-PK 11,195 binding, as compared with healthy volunteers. After eight weeks of treatment with either clomipramine or fluvoxamine, which was effective in all patients, the number of 3H-IMI binding sites increased significantly toward normal values, while the PST showed no change. These findings suggest that the reduction in 3H-IMI binding sites in OCD may be related to the severity of the illness and possibly to a positive response to serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, and might be considered as a state-dependent marker, whereas the PST activity would seem to be a trait of the illness.", 
    "115": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, implicated in the transport of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, is predicted by hydropathy analysis to feature five membrane-spanning domains, with the amino terminus within the mitochondrial periplasm and the carboxyl terminus in the external cytoplasm. We have tested these structural predictions directly by immunodetection of c-Myc-tagged peripheral benzodiazepine receptor on intact yeast mitochondria and by specific labeling in yeast membranes of cysteine residues introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. The combined results support the model originally proposed with some minor but important modifications. The theoretical model predicted relatively short alpha-helical domains, only long enough to span a phospholipid monolayer, whereas the results presented here would support a model with extended alpha-helices sufficiently long to span an entire membrane bilayer, with concomitant shorter loop and tail regions.", 
    "116": "Clathrin-coated vesicles are thought to be a vehicle for the sequestration of GABAA receptors. For coated vesicles from bovine cerebrum, we examined the binding properties of [3H]muscimol. a GABAA-specific agonist. [3H]flunitrazepam a benzodiazepine agonist, and [35S]t-butylbiocyclophosphorthionate (TBPS), a ligand for GABAA receptor channels. Under standard conditions, the binding level of [3H]muscimol, [3H]flunitrazepam, and [35S]TBPS to coated vesicles represented 12.3 +/- 1.8%, 7.9 +/- 1%, and 10.2 +/- 1.8%, respectively, of that in crude synaptic membranes. Coated vesicles showed a single [3H]flunitrazepam binding site with a KD value (12 nM) which was 9-fold that for synaptic membranes. The allosteric coupling between binding sites was measured by the addition of GABA to [3H]flunitrazepam and [35S]TBPS binding assays. For [3H]flunitrazepam binding to synaptic membranes, GABA gave an EC50 = 2.0 microM and at saturation (100 microM) an enhancement of 122%. This stimulation was completely blocked by the GABA antagonist SR95531. In contrast, neither GABA nor SR95531 had a significant effect on [3H]flunitrazepam binding to CCVs, indicating that the allosteric interaction between GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites is abolished. Likewise, GABA displaced nearly all of the [35S]TBPS binding to synaptic membranes but had no effect on binding to coated vesicles, indicating that coupling between the GABA binding sites and chloride channel is also impaired. Thus GABAA receptors appear to be uncoupled during normal intracellular trafficking via coated vesicles. The presence of major GABAA receptor subunits on these particles was verified by quantitative immunoblotting. Relative to the levels in synaptic membranes, CCVs contained 110 +/- 14% and 29.5 +/- 3.8%, respectively, of the immunoreactivity for GABAA receptor beta 2 and alpha 1 subunits. Thus, in comparison to GABAA receptors on synaptic membranes, those on CCVs have a reduced alpha 1/beta 2-subunit ratio. It may be suggested that a selective decline in the content of alpha 1 subunits in coated vesicles could in part account for GABAA receptor uncoupling.", 
    "117": "Many of the procedures carried out on paediatric patients are both painful and frightening to the child. To increase the child's comfort and to promote good working conditions, it may be necessary and advisable to sedate the child. In this study, 125 children (63 boys and 62 girls) were sedated with midazolam. For most children (n = 110) the medication was administered as nose drops. The reasons for sedation were echocardiography (n = 51), venous or lumbar punction (n = 53) and computer tomography scan (n = 21). The overall success rate was 78%. Minor complications were registered in four children. Two children vomited and one child developed a facial rash. One child had prolonged sedation, but this did not affect its respiration. We conclude that midazolam given as nose drops is a safe and convenient way of sedating paediatric patients.", 
    "118": "Midazolam is a recently developed water-soluble benzodiazepine that shares anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, hypnotic and anticonvulsant actions with other members of this class. There are limited studies that midazolam can be used successfully to treat seizures in adults and children. In this study, 0.2 mg/kg intramuscular (i.m.) midazolam was administered to 11 children (eight boys and three girls), aged 3 days to 4 years (mean age 1.8 +/- 1.4 years), with seizures of various types. In all but one child, seizures stopped in 15 s-5 min after injection. No side effects were observed. These results suggest that i.m. administration of midazolam may be useful in a variety of seizures during childhood, especially in case of intravenous (i.v.) line problem.", 
    "119": "We have recently reported that the short-acting anesthetic and analgesic drug midazolam can produce analgesia and decrease morphine tolerance and dependence in the rat by interacting with the opioid system. This study was designed to investigate the effect of midazolam, morphine, and both together on met-enkephalin levels in the rat. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: (1) saline-saline; (2) saline-morphine; (3) midazolam-saline, and (4) midazolam-morphine groups. First, a saline or midazolam injection was given intraperitoneally and after 30 min a second injection of saline or morphine was given subcutaneously once daily for 11 days. Animals were sacrificed on the 11th day 60 min after the last injection to measure met-enkephalin by radioimmunoassay. Morphine tolerant animals showed a significant increase in met-enkephalin levels in the cortex (137%) and midbrain (89%), and a significant decrease in met-enkephalin levels in the pituitary (74%), cerebellum (34%) and medulla (72%). Midazolam treated animals showed a significant decrease in met-enkephalin levels in the pituitary (63%), cortex (39%), medulla (58%), kidneys (36%), heart (36%) and adrenals (43%), and a significant increase in met-enkephalin levels in the striatum (54%) and pons (51%). When morphine and midazolam were injected together, midazolam antagonized the increase in met-enkephalin levels in cortex and midbrain region and the decrease in met-enkephalin level in the medulla region observed in morphine tolerant animals. These results indicate that morphine tolerance and dependence is associated with changes in the concentration of met-enkephalin in the brain. Midazolam may inhibit morphine tolerance and dependence by reversing some of the changes induced in met-enkephalin levels in brain by morphine in morphine tolerant and dependent animals.", 
    "120": "Previous studies from our laboratory have provided strong evidence that brain adenosine modulates acute ethanol (i.p.)-induced motor incoordination (MI) through receptor mediated mechanism(s). Recently, we have reported the involvement of the striatum in ethanol-induced MI as well as the striatal adenosinergic modulation of the ethanol-induced motor deficit. The present study was thus designed to further characterize the modulatory effect of striatal adenosine on ethanol-induced MI and to look for its functional correlation with chloride flux within the rat striatum. Intrastriatal microinfusion of adenosine A1 receptor agonist N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) and antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), significantly accentuated and attenuated, respectively, the motor incoordinating effect of ethanol while having no effect on the normal motor coordination in saline-treated control animals. These data confirmed the role of striatal adenosine in ethanol-induced MI. The selectivity of interactions between adenosine A1 agonist and antagonist and ethanol was further confirmed by the study in which neither intrastriatal CHA nor DPCPX significantly altered the MI induced by sodium pentobarbital. Previously, we have shown that intrastriatal Ro15-4513 not only significantly attenuated ethanol-induced MI but also blocked its accentuation by intrastriatal CHA. It is well known that Ro15-4513 antagonizes many, but not all, CNS effects of ethanol by blocking the ethanol potentiation of GABA-stimulated uptake of chloride. Therefore, experiments using striatal microsac preparations were carried out to investigate the possible modulation of chloride conductance by CHA and its relationship to ethanol. High concentrations of CHA (10 and 100 nM) increased the total chloride uptake by the striatal microsacs. Corresponding to the ethanol-adenosine interaction observed behaviorally, a much lower concentration (1 nM) of CHA, being ineffective itself, significantly enhanced the stimulatory action of ethanol on chloride uptake. This effect was blocked by either Ro15-4513 (100 nM) or DPCPX (10 nM). The modulatory effect of GABA and/or ethanol on chloride influx was also evaluated, and the results supported the appropriateness to use striatal microsac preparations in the present study. Overall, the data suggested a functional interaction between ethanol and striatal adenosine and further supported the hypothesis that striatal adenosine might, in part, modulate ethanol-induced MI through its effect on chloride conductance through chloride channels coupled to GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "121": "Intravenous administration of 2 micrograms/kg CCK-8 increased the single unit activity of 54% of hepatic vagal afferent fibers. Conduction velocity tests indicated that all of these units were C fibers. The increase in hepatic vagal activity produced by CCK-8 was significantly reduced by i.v. administration of 200 micrograms/kg of the CCKA receptor antagonist devazepide. Control comparisons indicated that this reduction was not an artifact of tachyphylaxis resulting from repeated administration of CCK-8. Further, the inability of pretreatment with atropine and hexamethonium to reduce the increases in hepatic vagal activity produced by CCK-8 suggests that the latter effect was not secondary to changes in gastrointestinal motor function. These outcomes demonstrate that activation of CCKA receptors by CCK-8 increases hepatic vagal afferent activity and support the view that the duodenal satiety action of CCK is mediated by the hepatic branch.", 
    "122": "To evaluate the role of the mitochondrial peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) in steroidogenesis, we developed a molecular approach based on the disruption of the PBR gene, by homologous recombination, in the constitutive steroid producing R2C rat Leydig tumor cell line. Inactivation of one allele of the PBR gene resulted in the suppression of PBR mRNA and ligand binding expression. Immunoblot and electron microscopic immunogold labeling analyses confirmed the absence of the 18-kDa PBR protein in the selected clone. Although mitochondria from the PBR-negative cells contained high levels of the constitutively expressed 30-kDa steroidogenic activity regulator protein, these cells produced minimal amounts of steroids compared with normal cells (5%). Moreover, mitochondria from PBR-negative cells failed to produce pregnenolone when supplied with exogenous cholesterol. Addition of the hydrosoluble cholesterol derivative, 22R-hydroxycholesterol, increased steroid production by the PBR-negative R2C cells, indicating that the cholesterol transport mechanism was impaired. Stable transfection of the PBR-negative R2C Leydig cells with a vector containing the PBR cDNA resulted in the recovery of the steroidogenic function of the cells. These data demonstrate that PBR is an indispensable element of the steroidogenic machinery, where it mediates the delivery of the substrate cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial side chain cleavage cytochrome P-450.", 
    "123": "GYKI 52466 (1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine) was examined in a battery of analgesia and anti-inflammatory tests in rats and mice, respectively. Its 3-N-acetyl (GYKI 53773) and 3-N-methylcarbamoyl (GYKI 53784) derivatives were also examined in some assays. These 2,3-benzodiazepines, known as prototypic non-competitive antagonists of AMPA receptors, showed a peculiar profile in some routinely used antinociceptive tests. They were found fairly potent in rat tail flick and mouse phenylquinone writhing assays but the dose-response curves were rather shallow as compared to that of morphine. Their action is stereoselective, i.e., the (+) isomers were found inactive, in agreement with the previous in vitro studies. Their antinociceptive effect could not be reversed by naloxone and the GYKI compounds did not potentiate significantly the morphine-induced analgesia. In the mouse hot plate assay the 2,3-benzodiazepines were active only in doses inducing visible motor incapacitation. In rats, GYKI 52466 weakly reduced the hypersensitivity accompanying acute carrageenan edema. However, it potently inhibited the hyperalgesia during Freund adjuvant-induced chronic arthritis. In the latter assay GYKI 52466 also attenuated the body weight loss without altering the paw edema. The present findings confirm reports in the literature which indicate AMPA receptors may contribute to certain forms of pathological hyperalgesia, e.g., to that detectable in inflamed tissues.", 
    "124": "The aim of the present study was to characterize the muscarinic receptor subtype mediating nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) relaxations in the rabbit anococcygeus muscle (RAM) by the use of muscarinic receptor agonists and a battery of key muscarinic antagonists. In addition, experiments were carried out to identify the NANC neurotransmitter(s) involved in the inhibitory NANC neurotransmission. In preparations with histamine-raised tone, the nonselective muscarinic agonists (pD2 values) (+)-muscarine (5.23), cis-dioxolane (5.16), oxotremorine M (4.95) and carbachol (4.06) produced concentration-dependent relaxations corresponding to 72.6-85.0% of the histamine-induced precontraction. In contrast, the subtype-preferring (M1/M4 over M2 and M3 receptors) agonists 4-(3-chlorophenylcarbamoyloxy)-2-butynyltrimethylammonium chloride (McN-A-343), (S)-4-(dimethylamino)-1-methyl-2-butynyl-N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate methobromide [(S)-BN 228], (R)- and (S)-N-methyl-N-(1-methyl-4-pyrrolidino-2-butynyl)acetamide [(R)- and (S)-BM 5] showed no or rather low [(S)-BN 228] muscarinic activity. The low potencies, together with the ineffectiveness of some agonists, indicated a low effective receptor reserve associated with the relaxant response. No contractile responses to (+)-muscarine were observed neither in unstimulated nor in precontracted preparations suggesting that the existence of an excitatory postjunctional muscarinic receptor may be excluded. The nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium had no influence on relaxant responses to (+)-muscarine, but abolished relaxations elicited by (-)-nicotine. This demonstrates that the RAM contains also nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AchRs) mediating inhibitory NANC responses. Relaxations induced by the stimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic AchRs as well as by electrical field stimulation (EFS) were completely abolished by tetrodotoxin and were also sensitive to the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG), indicating that NO plays an important role as an inhibitory NANC transmitter in RAM. All muscarinic antagonists investigated did not influence the histamine-induced precontraction, but shifted the concentration-response curve of (+)-muscarine to the right in a parallel fashion. Schild analysis yielded regression lines of unit slope, indicating competitive antagonism. The following rank order of antagonist potencies (pA2 values) was found: 11-([4-[4-(diethylamino)-butyl]-1-piperidinyl]-acetyl-5,11-dihydro-6H-py rido (2,3-b) (1,4)-benzodiazepine-6-one hydrochloride (AQ-RA 741; 8.08) = himbacine (8.03) > or = tripitramine (7.69) > or = p-fluorohexahydro-sila-difenidol (p-F-HHSiD; 7.48) > or = methoctramine (7.30) > or = pirenzepine (7.18) > or = guanylpirenzepine (6.24). A comparison of the pA2 values determined in the RAM with published data from binding studies at muscarinic M1-M4 and m5 receptors suggests that the functional muscarinic receptor mediating NANC relaxation in the RAM is of the M4 subtype. Taken together, the results obtained in the present study provide convincing evidence that relaxant responses elicited by muscarinic stimuli in RAM are nitrergic in nature and mediated by muscarinic M4 receptors located somadendritically on NANC neurons. Thus, the isolated RAM may serve as a functional muscarinic M4 receptor model.", 
    "125": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of selective cholecystokinin (CCK) antagonists on the development of a preference for the mother by newly born lambs. At birth lambs received an injection of the CCK-A antagonist devazepide (0.01 or 0.1 mg/kg), the CCK-B antagonist PD135158 (0.01 or 0.1 mg/kg), or saline for the controls (1 ml/kg). No major side effects were observed in the first 4 postnatal hours except that lambs receiving PD135158 displayed more exploratory behavior towards the maternal body than lambs from the other groups. When tested in a 2-choice test situation at 24 hr of age, lambs treated with PD135158 or saline spent significantly more time near their dams than near the alien ewes, whereas lambs treated with devazepide did not show any discrimination. The effect of devazepide persisted at 48 hr of age. The use of a CCK-A antagonist, but not a CCK-B antagonist, was concluded to prevent the formation of a preferential relationship between the lamb and its mother, most probably by impairing neonatal learning.", 
    "126": "Small increments in background noise were shown to increase the amplitude of a subsequently elicited acoustic startle reflex (ASR) in rats by as much as 100% under optimal conditions. Increment lead time (5-160 ms) and level (1.5-15 dB), initial noise level (30-70 dB), startle level (95-125 dB), number of test days (1-5), and drug condition (diazepam or saline ip) were varied in 6 experiments. Prepulse facilitation (PPF), measured by difference scores, was greatest for intermediate increments (3 dB) and lead times (20-40 ms) and was replaced by prepulse inhibition (PPI) for higher values, especially in the later test days. Diazepam reduced baseline ASR and diminished PPI, but it did not affect PPF. These data argue against hypotheses that attribute PPF of this sort to either temporal integration within the ASR pathways or to the elicitation of a nonspecific arousal reaction by the prepulse."
