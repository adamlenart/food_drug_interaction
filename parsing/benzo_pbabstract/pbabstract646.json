    "1": "Chlorodesmethyldiazepam (I) concentrations were followed for 72 h in the plasma of four volunteers given 2 mg of the drug orally. The drug appears to be well absorbed, reaching peak plasma levels of 20--30 ng ml-1 1--2 h after administration; 72 h after administration, plasma concentrations are still measurable (5 ng ml-1). The analytical method involved a single extraction of I from the plasma into benzene followed by centrifugation, evaporation, and gas-chromatographic analysis of the samples.", 
    "2": "Ethanol (ETOH), like chlordiazepoxide (CDZ), significantly attenuated the suppressive effect of punishment on licking behavior in water-deprived rats and mice. In rats, the greatest effects of ETOH (1.5 g/kg) were observed between 30 and 60 min following IP administration. tert-Butanol also attenuated the effects of punishment, suggesting that acetaldehyde was not contributing to this effect of ETOH. Since a dose of ETOH that increased punished drinking did not increase unpunished drinking, alteration in thirst motivation would not appear to be responsible for its antipunishment action. However, doses of ETOH or CDZ that significantly increased punished responding increased jump thresholds to aversive shock, suggesting that decreased sensitivity to aversive stimulation may contribute to the anti-punishment action of both agents. In addition to these similarities between ethanol and CDZ, several differences were noted in their effects. For example, CDZ decreased serum corticosterone concentration, whereas ETOH did not. Further, ETOH impaired aerial righting reflex and reduced rectal temperature, whereas CDZ had no effect on these parameters at doses that had anti-punishment activity. Finally, specific binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to crude brain cortical membranes was decreased by CDZ, but not ETOH. Although ETOH and CDZ similarly alter punished behavior, results suggest that ETOH does not act through a direct interaction with a benzodiazepine binding site.", 
    "3": "Rats were trained to lever press for sucrose on a random interval (RI) 64-s schedule. During a 55 min session there were four 3 min \"intrusion periods\" signalled by a flashing house-light. In experiment 1 there were two groups matched for baseline response rate. During the intrusion periods one group received response-independent footshock on an independent RI 64 schedule; the other group received response-contingent shock on this schedule. Shock intensity was varied for each rat to match degree of response suppression between the two groups. Chlordiazepoxide HCl (CDP) in doses 0.5-5 mg/kg alleviated response suppression equally in both groups. Experiment II followed the same procedure, except that all animals had the same shock intensity, producing greater response suppression in the response-contingent shock groups. CDP alleviated response suppression more in the response-contingent shock groups, significantly so at 5 mg/kg, nonsignificantly at 1 mg/kg. These results suggest that previous reports that CDP differentially alleviates the response suppression produced by response-contingent shock are an artefact of rate dependency.", 
    "4": "In 12 healthy volunteers the kinetics and neuropsychological actions of IV diazepam (DZ) (single dose) were studied with and without the presence of its main metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam (NDDZ). Both the maximal plasma concentration and the steepness of the alpha-slope were correlated with variations in the corresponding continuous reaction time (CRT). EEG profiles, CRT and clinical ratings for anxiety and sedation all showed significant changes between the situations with the metabolite present or absent, but no significant correlation could be found with the kinetic pattern of DZ in the two situations. Tolerance to NDDZ did not develop. The results indicate that the presence of the active metabolite changes the pharmacodynamic profile of the parent compound probably by an interaction at the receptor site between DZ and NDDZ. Changes in the spectrum of effects during long-term therapy with DZ may, therefore, partly be explained in this way.", 
    "5": "Twenty milligram diazepam (DZ) was compared with 20 mg of its main metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam (NDDZ) as single dose, oral premedication in a genuine stressful situation. Fifty patients participated in the randomized, double-blind controlled study. Anxiety and sedation were measured the day before an operation and one hour after premedication, just before the operation. NDDZ was significantly less sedative while the degree of anxiety was rated equal in the two groups. The results may support the hypothesis that a competition between DZ and NDDZ can explain the shift in the effect profile of DZ during long term treatment.", 
    "6": "Diazepam, in moderate doses, has been used in a placebo controlled, single blind study to treat dyspnoea in four patients severely disabled from chronic airflow obstruction. The subjects had the 'pink puffer syndrome', usually associated with emphysema and were not hypercapnoeic nor severely hypoxic at rest. With diazepam, they experienced a striking reduction in dyspnoea, and an improvement in effort tolerance; in addition the slope of the ventilation/CO2 response curve was reduced. There were no changes in resting blood gases. Psychiatric examination at the end of the study did not reveal prominent anxiety, although three patients were depressed. The use of diazepam to treat dyspnoea in this syndrome is safe in the absence of any acute infection", 
    "7": "Self-poisoning with tricyclic and related anti-depressant drugs has increased in frequency over the last few years so that, at present, some 20 per cent of patients admitted to hospital following self-poisoning have ingested a drug of this group, either alone or, more commonly, in association with alcohol, a benzodiazepine and/or other drugs. We present the results of a retrospective analysis of 316 admissions to a general medical hospital dealing with patients over 12 years, following self-poisoning with tricylic or related drugs. Although serious toxic effects may sometimes occur, their frequency has probably been over-estimated, at least in older children and adults; in this series the incidence of significant hypotension was 13 per cent, grand mal convulsions 4 per cent, respiratory depression to the degree of requiring mechanical ventilation 2 per cent and severe cardiac arrhythmias or conduction disturbances 1.5 per cent. It is suggested that routine 'prophylactic' treatment against convulsions and cardiac arrhythmias, advocated by some previous authors, is unnecessary and potentially dangerous; indeed, even the establishment of an intravenous infusion may put an extra strain on a depressed myocardium. In this series, supportive treatment alone was sufficient for the majority of patients (81.6 per cent) and additional treatment was given only in the presence of some specific indication. Using such conservative measures, the mortality rate in the 10-year study was only 0.6 per cent. Medical efforts in the future, it is suggested, would be more appropriately directed towards preventing unnecessary prescribing of these drugs for trivial mental upset, rather than the development of new drugs of this type or other 'prophylactic' measures, designed to prevent relatively rare toxic effects.", 
    "8": "Five dogs received a single 1.0 mg/kg dose of diazepam (DZ) IV. Concentrations of DZ and its major metabolite desmethyldiazepam (DMDZ) were simultaneously measured in plasma and cisternal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for up to 8 h after the dose by electron-capture gas-liquid chromatography. DZ was rapidly eliminated from plasma (half-life 0.3--1.3 h); DZ disappearance was mirrored by formation of DMDZ, which in turn was eliminated slowly, Both DZ and DMDZ rapidly penetrated CSF and concentrations in CSF declined parallel with those in plasma. Despite rapid uptake, the extent of CSF transfer of DZ and DMDZ was limited by plasma protein binding. Mean CSF:plasma concentrtion ratios for DZ (range 0.023--0.137) and DMDZ (range 0.047--0.119) were highly correlated with the unbound fraction in plasma (r = 0.95 and 0.80, respectively). Thus DZ and DMDZ concentrations in CSF, presumed to reflect concentrations at the site of action, are determined by unbound plasma concentrations. The intensity of pharmacologic action is more likely to correlate with unbound than with total plasma concentrations.", 
    "9": "The effects of flurazepam (0.0, 0.5, and 3.0 mg/kg) on methylphenidate-induced increases in stereotypy, gnawing, sniffing, and locomotion were evaluated in Swiss-Webster mice in daytime and nighttime experiments. Methylphenidate (50 mg/kg) increased overall stereotypy and stereotyped gnawing behavior; two doses of methylphenidate (25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg) increased locomotion and sniffing behavior. Flurazepam 3.0 mg/kg augmented methylphenidate-induced stereotyped gnawing behavior and stereotypy. Flurazepam significantly decreased locomotion and sniffing, but did not interact with methylphenidate's effects on locomotion and sniffing.", 
    "10": "On the basis of the information about 286 patients with a grave course of epilepsy, but showing an improvement as a result of more individualized treatment a number of today's problems concerning the therapy of this disease are discussed with reference to 102 of those patients. Of these problems the principal are: consideration of the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of antiepileptic drugs while solving the questions on their dosage, intervals between the doses and combined medication; specification of the character of petit mal (absence, pseudoabsence) with the purpose of individualization of the treatment; consideration of the therapy peculiarities in epilepsy of sleep and concomitance of epilepsy and hyposomnia.", 
    "11": "d-Amphetamine (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) and dl-fenfluramine (2.0 and 4.0 mg/kg) reduced food intake in a short exposure feeding test, and their effects were counteraated by chloriazepoxide, particularly at 50 mg/kg. Chloriazepoxide reduced latency to eat, extended the durationof feeding and depressed the rate of feeding. Antagonism occurred in combination with d-amphetamine in relation to latency and duration, but in this experiment d-amphetamine did not affect feeding rate. Antagonism also occurred in combination with fenfluramine, with latency and duration measures, but only at the lower chlordiazepoxide dose. Instead, chlordiazepoxide (10.0 mg/kg) enhanced fenfluramine's effects to reduce feeding duration and feeding rate.", 
    "12": "Diazepam, oxazepam, N-methyloxazepam, nitrazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam prevented seizures in mice produced by lidocaine, mepivacaine, and prilocaine, and in rats by lidocaine when administered IP five minutes before IP local anesthetic. ED50 values for antagonism of lidocaine tremors ranged from 0.7 to 5.2 mg/kg for N-methyloxazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam respectively in mice, and 0.08 to 0.54 mg/kg for N-desmethyldiazepam and oxazepam respectively, and for antagonism of prilocaine convulsions, 0.2 to 0.6 mg/kg for N-methyloxazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam respectively. All compounds tested terminated ongoing lidocaine tremors when injected IV in mice with ED50 values ranging from 1.7 x 10(-3) to 3.0 x 10(-3) mg/kg for N-desmethyldiazepam and N-methyloxazepam respectively, N-methyloxazepam was significantly more potent after IP injection than nitrazepam, oxazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam against lidocaine in mice and more potent than N-desmethyldiazepam and oxazepam against mepivacaine; it was more potent than diazepam and oxazepam against lidocaine in rats. N-desmethyldiazepam was most potent against lidocaine in rats and lest potent in mice. There were no significant differences in ED50 values preventing prilocaine convulsions in mice or after IV injection to terminate ongoing lidocaine seizures. The presence of a methyl and hydroxyl group at position N-1 and C-3 respectively (N-methyloxazepam) was apparently responsible for the higher potency relative to some of the other compounds in preventing lidocaine and mepivacaine tremors in mice and lidocaine tremors in rats. It is concluded however that the magnitudes of differences in potencies of the compounds in antagonizing local anesthetic seizures in mice and rats were not so large as to prefer any single agent over diazepam.", 
    "13": "A comparative analysis of the effect from using the antiepileptic drugs tegretol, morpholep, sucsilep, trimethin, chlonazepam, and sodium valproate in 258 patients with trigeminal neuralgia was carried out. In half of the cases long-time follow-up observations were made. The results of the treatment were analyzed with reference to the time in which the therapeutic effect appeared and reached the maximum, as well as to the stability of the therapeutic remission obtained. Causes of failure of the therapy in some patients and the drugs' side-effects were analyzed.", 
    "14": "Chlordiazepoxide (5 and 10 mg/kg) and diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) reduced the latency to eat and enhanced feeding response to familiar food in a food-preference test. The increased feeding response resulted from an increased frequency of individual eating episodes (bouts) without significant change in the episode duration. Experiment II indicated that this facilitatory action of the two drugs was not dependent on the presence of principal novelty cues in the food-preference test. Diazepam (5 mg/kg), in contrast, enhanced the feeding responses to novel food in the food preference test. Experiment III demonstrated that although diazepam can counteract induced food neophobia, its facilitory action on the response to novel foods may be mediated by a mechanism which can operate independently of food neophobia.", 
    "15": "Chlordiazepoxide (CDP) has been previously shown to possess antinociceptive properties that are resistant, except at high doses, to the opiate antagonist naloxone. The present study evaluated whether CDP's antinociceptive effects were subject to tolerance following repeated injections and whether cross-tolerance might develop between the antinociceptive action of CDP and that of either morphine or cold water swins. CDP increased flinch-jump thresholds following acute administration and exhibited tolerance following repeated injections. Neither morphine-tolerant nor cold water swim-adapted rats displayed an antinociceptive effect when tested with CDP. On the other hand, chronic pretreatment with CDP attenuated the antinociceptive effects of cold water swims, but did not produce any clear effect upon morphine analgesia.", 
    "16": "The effects of naloxone on diazepam-induced release of behavior in aversive situations were investigated in rats. Naloxone (0.5 and 1 mg/kg-1) suppressed diazepam-induced eating in an unfamiliar situation and reduced (1 mg/kg-1) spontaneous food intake. Naloxone (1 mg/kg-1) canceled the increased lever pressing produced by diazepam in a conflict procedure in which one electric shock was delivered at each seventh press. Naloxone (1 mg/kg-1) failed to reverse the enhanced responding for food induced by diazepam in the presence of a signal previously paired with electric foot shocks. In this situation, naloxone alone reinforced the behavioral suppression. These results suggest that transmission mediated by opiate peptides may be involved in only some 'disinhibitory' effects of benzodiazepines. In addition, such a peptidergic transmission may play a role in the control of stress-induced behavioral suppression.", 
    "17": "Previous research has shown that benzo-diazepines and barbiturates can increase the proportion of response bursts emitted by rats on differential reinforcement of low rate (DRL) schedules. A recent report found that caffeine could exert a similar effect in mice and the present study was carried out to compare the actions of caffeine with those of chlordiazepoxide on DRL responding in rats and Mongolian gerbils. Chlordiazepoxide increased response rates, decreased reinforcement frequencies and increased percentages of response bursts in both species. Caffeine also increased response rates and decreased reinforcement frequencies, but in neither species was the percentage of response bursts systematically increased. d-Amphetamine administered to the gerbils also did not increase the percentages of response bursts. Combinations of caffeine and chlordiazepoxide were administered to the rats and produced effects which were generally additive.", 
    "18": "Rats shifted from 32% sucrose to 4% sucrose consumed less 4% than animals without prior experience with 32% sucrose. The influence of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) on this successive negative contrast obtained in sucrose ingestion was investigated in four experiments. The results indicated that (1) rats injected with CDP during both preshift experience with 32% sucrose and post-shift experience with 4% sucrose showed an essentially unchanged contrast effect compared with saline-injected rats, (2) CDP injection for the first time on post-shift day 2 eliminated contrast but post-shift day 1 injections had little effect, (3) animals injected with CDP throughout preshift and switched to saline coincident with the sucrose shift showed a contrast effect at least as great as control animals, and (4) injections of CDP tended to elevate lick rate regardless of other conditions. These results indicate a disinhibitory effect of CDP and possible neophobia operating on the first post-shift day.", 
    "19": "The effects of diazepam-fentanyl combinations on consciousness, superficial nociception, respiration and circulation during N2O+O2 inhalation were studied in 40 premedicated patients during induction of anaesthesia. The balance between antinociception and anaesthesia was closest to the optimum in patients receiving 0.2 mg/kg of diazepam plus 1 micrograms/kg of fentanyl; the eyelid reflex was negative in all patients and only two out of ten patients reacted to abdominal pinching. When only 0.2 mg/kg of diazepam was given with N2O+O2, the eyelid reflex was negative in all patients, but half of them reacted to pinching. When the dose of diazepam was reduced to 0.1 mg/kg and patients received 1 or 2 micrograms/kg of fentanyl, the balance between anaesthesia and antinociception was good, but 30-50% of patients had a positive eyelid reflex and reacted to pinching. No distinct respiratory depression was observed in patients given 0.2 mg/kg of diazepam, whereas seven patients given 0.1mg/kg of diazepam plus 2 micrrograms/kg of fentanyl had apnoea lasting more than 60 s associated with a significant (P less than 0.05-0.001) increase in end-tidal CO2 and PCO2 in arterialised venous blood. No significant changes were observed in blood pressure or heart rate after any of the drug combinations studied. It appears that an optimal balance between anaesthesia and antinociception with minimal side-effects during balanced general anaesthesia requires reinforcement of N2O+O2 anaesthesia not only with fentanyl but also with hypnotics for sedatives.", 
    "20": "The stimulant effects of oxolinic acid were investigated in rats and mice. This drug, given orally, consistantly induced, in doses ranging from 16 to 256 mg.kg-1, locomotor stimulation and stereotyped behavior. These effects were antagonized by pimozide (1 mg.kg-1), alpha-methyltyrosine (64 mg.kg-1) or reserpine (4 mg.kg-1, 24 h before testing) pretreatment, suggesting a facilitatory role of oxolinic acid on catecholaminergic processes. Diazepam (4-16 mg.kg-1) reduced the stimulant effects induced by oxolinic acid but not those induced by amphetamine; oxolinic acid (8 mg.kg-1) markedly reduced the antipunishment effect elicited in rats by diazepam (2 mg.kg-1). Since benzodiazepines have been reported to enhance GABA functioning, these data suggest that oxolinic acid may impair GABA transmission. However, neither muscimol (0.5-1 mg.kg-1) or gamma-acetylenic-GABA (16-64 mg.kg-1) selectively reduced the stimulant effects elicited by oxolinic acid. Therefore, the possible facilitation exerted by this drug on catecholaminergic systems may not derive from the release of an inhibitory GABAergic control.", 
    "21": "Changes in mood after administration of Diazepam and Caffeine were analyzed. Six aspects were studied: pleasantness, activation, extraversion, calmness, social orientation and control. In addition to this check list, mood ratings using magnitude estimation of selected adjectives were obtained. It was found that Diazepam decreased feelings of activation and extraversion and increased calmness. Caffeine had no clear effects on the check list, but on the magnitude estimation scale some effects opposite to those of Diazepam were observed. Men reported a higher degree of pleasantness than women after administration of Diazepam. No differences in heart rate were found. Few distinct scale values were utilized on the magnitude estimation scale and the discriminative power was found to be larger for the check list than for the magnitude estimation scale.", 
    "22": "The effects of pirenzepine and the H2-blocker ranitidine on pepsin secretion were studied in patients with duodenal ulcer. Pirenzepine and ranitidine in doses of 0.3 mg/kg-h inhibited pentagastrin-stimulated pepsin secretion by 63% and 82% respectively. The highest doses used of pirenzepine (0.6 mg/kg-h) and ranitidine (0.9 mg/kg-h) inhibited pepsin secretion by 69 and 93% respectively, whereas acid output was inhibited by 57 and 98%. Pirenzepine inhibited pepsin output more than hydrochloric acid output. However, pepsin output was less inhibited than hydrochloric acid output by ranitidine. These results suggest that pirenzepine might be especially useful in the treatment of those patients with peptic ulcer who have high proteolytic activity of their gastric juice.", 
    "23": "Biochemical studies on the hippocampus of acutely prepared rabbits revealed more than twofold increases in cyclic GMP levels following tetanic potentiation of the pathway from the medial septal region to CA1 pyramidal cells. Diazepam, administered intravenously, prevented the elevation in cyclic GMP levels in this region and also attenuated the post-tetanic potentiation seen following the presentation of trains at frequencies within theta rhythm. The results imply a modulatory role for cyclic nucleotides in the enhancement of pyramidal cell excitability and suggest that the biochemical mechanism for the psychoactive benzodiazepines may well include the suppression of cyclic GMP levels.", 
    "24": "The effects of etazolate and cartazolate, two pyrazolopyridine derivatives with anxiolytic actions, on the receptor binding of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was studied in vitro using membrane fractions prepared from rat brain. Both compounds increased the specific GABA receptor binding. This effect was markedly enhanced in the presence of several anions, predominantly halide ions. Pyrazolopyridines appear to modulate the binding properties of GABA receptors by acting on a site closely related to the chloride ion channel of the membrane. These results indicate that activation of the GABA system is a possible mechanism of action of pyrazolopyridines. In the second part of the study binding experiments were used to provide evidence for the presynaptic localisation of GABA receptors on primary afferent terminals in the dorsal horn of the rat spinal cord. Capsaicin-induced degeneration of primary afferent fibres significantly reduced the number of GABA receptors in the dorsal spinal cord, whereas the number of benzodiazepine and glycine receptors remained unchanged. The results support the role of GABA as transmitter involved in presynaptic inhibition in the spinal cord.", 
    "25": "The paper deals with the etiology and epidemiology of \"blitz\" nodding spasms. The course of the disease was followed in 70 children who received various kinds of therapy within 1965 to 1976. Apparent prevalence of boys, role of genetic factors and the decisive importance of perinatal damages are noted. Even in the initial stage of the disease most children showed apparent signs of psychomotor retardation because of an early damage to the brain. The earliest time of the disease onset was the third week of life. An electroencephalographic examination showed a prevalence of type I (generalized) hypsarrhythmia. Treatment with ACTH and nitrazepam (radedorm) and in some cases also with apidan, lepsiral and chlopazepam was given. Frequent revision of the treatment schemes and combined treatment were found necessary. Only 5 of the 70 children developed in accordance with age; 18 children died of intercurrent infections at an age of under 5 years. Modern drugs (nitrazepam, dipromyl acetate, chlonazepam) did not improve the disease prognosis and could not replace completely the hormonal therapy.", 
    "26": "Many similarities were observed in the behavioral and neurochemical actions of ethanol and chlordiazepoxide (CDZ) suggesting that these agents may share common mechanisms of action. However, similarities in these actions could not be explained by effects on a benzodiazepine binding site, since only CDZ interacted with this locus.", 
    "27": "Penicillin application to the rat brain motor cortex resulted in appearance of interictal discharges and seizures. After diazepam injection (2 mg/kg) a 100% increase in Na, K-ATPase activity of neuronal membranes in the epileptogenic focus was shown as compared to enzyme activity before diazepam injection. Interictal discharges and seizures changed in different ways after intramuscular injection of diazepam. The frequency and amplitude variation of interictal discharges increased but the seizures were suppressed. These effects increased with the dose of diazepam. It is suggested that the different influence of diazepam upon seizures and interictal discharges may reflect different mechanisms of these phenomena.", 
    "28": "Autoanalgesia (behaviorally-activated antinociception) was elicited by lesion-induced hyperemotionality or the classical conditioning of fear to the environmental stimuli associated with measuring antinociception. Both hyperemotionality and antinociception exhibited parallel decline in septal-lesioned rats with daily handling and in VMH-lesioned rats following treatment with diazepam. Autoanalgesia elicited by conditioned fear was blocked by spinal cord transection but not by diazepam. Although opiate binding experiments suggested the involvement of endorphins as mediators of autoanalgesia, hypophysectomy, morphine tolerance or very high doses of opiate antagonists failed to reduce the antinociception. Electrolytic lesions of the nucleus raphe magnus, a descending serotonergic system, did cause a significant reduction in autoanalgesia. Therefore, endorphin systems may be activated by the stress involved in autoanalgesic paradigms as a parallel system, whose functional integrity is not necessary for the expression of behaviorally-induced antinociception.", 
    "29": "Certain benzodiazepine receptors may be associated in different ways with GABA receptors and/or ion recognition sites, to yield multiple receptor complexes. The benzodiazepine recognition site may be the same in all of the complexes. The different elements of the complexes almost certainly interact allosterically (Fig. 5). Different benzodiazepine receptor complexes may mediate different pharmacological effects of these drugs.", 
    "30": "The effect of p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), a specific serotonin (5-HT) depleter, on diazepam withdrawal signs was studied. Rats were made dependent on diazepam by the chronic administration of this drug in the diet. At the time of diazepam withdrawal, the animals were treated with PCPA (200 mg/kg, IP) or the corresponding vehicle (control). After diazepam withdrawal, the maximal body weight losses of control and PCPA-treated animals were 4.1% and 9.0%, respectively. In naive animals, PCPA did not cause any change in body weight. These results suggest that depletion of central 5-HT by PCPA may potentiate the severity of diazepam withdrawal signs.", 
    "31": "A typical case of stiff-man syndrome was studied neurophysiologically and pharmacologically focusing the attention on a central disorder, either spinal or suprasegmental. The results support the hypothesis that a gamma type of hypertonia is one of the causes of the stiff-man syndrome, ruling out the participation of the Renshaw circuits. The syndrome should be considered a central disorder of the descending pathways that control and modify gamma activity and the startle reaction mechanisms, especially affecting the circuits that use Gabaergic mediators.", 
    "32": "Anatomical and behavioral effects of large and of circumscribed kainic acid lesions in the thalamus of the cat are described. Evidence is provided that even \"athalamic\" preparations seem possible and that cats with destruction of more than two thirds of their thalamus show only transitory disturbance of basic functions (eating, drinking, walking). It is concluded that fiber systems, traversing the thalamus, may be of particular importance for maintaining basic functions.", 
    "33": "Alprazolam is a new type triazolobenzodiazepine anxiolytic agent. 115 neurotic patients were treated with alprazolam for 4 weeks in an open label study. The daily dose of alprazolam ranged from 0.4 to 3.2 mg (average: 1.4 mg). 73% of the subjects experienced a slight to remarkable improvement. A particularly high improvement rate was observed in patients with initially severe sleep disturbances. No serious side effects were noted. Comparative characteristics of neurotic patients with insomnia (insomnia neurotic patients) were investigated and the validity of the PNRS-D (Psychoneurotic Rating Scale developed by the authors) in comparison with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale is discussed.", 
    "34": "The effects of pirenzepine on the plasma concentrations of gut hormones in the fasting and postprandial states were studied in six healthy subjects. On separate days and in random order, 10 mg pirenzepine, in 2 ml of solvent, or 2 ml saline (0.15 mol/l) were given intravenously 30 min before a standard normal breakfast (2220 kJ). Pirenzepine was not found to affect basal or postprandial levels of insulin, glucagon, gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), neurotensin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or somatostatin. The basal concentration of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) was lowered (p less than 0.05) and the postprandial elevation reduced, though not significantly. While the basal concentration of motilin was also suppressed (p less than 0.05), the postprandial elevation remained unchanged following pirenzepine. The release of enteroglucagon was reduced significantly in the basal and postprandial states (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.025 respectively). The postprandial gastrin response was prolonged slightly, but insignificantly, by pirenzepine. It is concluded that pirenzepine does not exert any major or unexpected actions on the hormonal control of digestion.", 
    "35": "Intravenous doses of eight antiacetylcholine drugs reduced gastric acid secretion in the rat and caused pupil dilatation in the mouse. Inhibition by these drugs of oxotremorine-induced hypothermia in mice was also assessed. The ratio, ED50 (pupil dilatation)/ED50 (gastric acid inhibition), was greater (more favourable) for pirenzepine and oxyphencyclimine than for atropine, benzhexol, glycopyrronium, isopropamide, poldine or propantheline. However, oxyphencyclimine antagonised central oxotremorine activity at all doses having more gastric inhibitory activity. Pirenzepine is a peripheral antiacetylcholine drug more selective for reducing gastric acid secretion than for increasing pupil diameter and with little central antiacetylcholine effect.", 
    "36": "Our presently somewhat limited knowledge of the modulation of the content, release and turnover of endorphins in brain and pituitary by acute and chronic drug treatment is reviewed and discussed particularly in relation to the problem of addiction. In vitro studies in striatal slices and isolated anterior and intermediate/posterior lobes of the pituitary point to the existence of specific interactions between endorphins and neurotransmitters. In vivo studies have revealed acute GABA-mediated effects of benzodiazepines upon striatal levels of met-enkephalin activity. Morphine exerts no acute effects upon endorphin levels, but decreases the levels of particular endorphins in specific areas of brain and pituitary after long-term treatment; somewhat similar effects are observed after prolonged intake of ethanol, whereas chronic haloperidol treatment results in an increase in levels of endorphins in brain and pituitary. Incorporation studies employing the intermediate/posterior lobe of the pituitary have revealed that the changes in beta-endorphin levels produced by prolonged treatment with morphine or haloperidol reflect a respective depressed or enhanced synthesis of the beta-endorphin precursor pro-opiocortin, whilst the enzymatic processing of this precursor remains unmodified. Studies in cell-free preparations demonstrated that m-RNA extracted from the intermediate/posterior lobes of chronically morphinized rats possesses a decreased \"activity\".", 
    "37": "The controlled clinical studies that have attempted to evaluate the usefulness of benzodiazepines in the treatment of schizophrenic patients are reviewed. It is concluded that the doses used were probably too small and inadequate to induce an ameliorating effect. Benzodiazepines may be promising candidates for antipsychotic drugs since, by facilitating CABAergic neurotransmission, they diminish dopaminergic neurotransmission.", 
    "38": "Central neurotransmitter systems have been activated in anaesthetized rats, while the effects on the urinary bladder have been recorded by cystometric procedures. Stimulation of central catecholamine neurons with the amine precursor L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), after peripheral inhibition of the degradating enzyme dopadecarboxylase, resulted in a hyperactive urinary bladder response. This bladder action seems to be elicited mainly via central dopamine receptors, and mediated via neurons of non-catecholamine type. Activation of central muscarinic receptors with oxotremorine, after pretreatment with methylscopolamine, induced a hyperactive urinary bladder response, which is suggested to originate in pontine-mesencephalic structures as well. There might in some instances be an interaction with muscarinic receptors in the generation of the bladder hyperreactivity to L-DOPA, at the pontine-mesencephalic brain level. The bladder response to stimulation of central muscarinic receptors, on the other hand, seems to be independent of intact adrenergic neurons. The peripheral mediation of the bladder response to L-DOPA is propagated via the pelvic nerves; in the peripheral ganglia via cholinergic receptors, but in the bladder detrusor via non-cholinergic as well as non-adrenergic receptors. Activation of central GABA mechanisms with GABA, muscimol and diazepam strongly inhibited the bladder hyperactivity to L-DOPA. This inhibition probably occurred in the pontine-mesencephalic brain area. The results suggest that excitatory dopaminergic and muscarinic receptors, as well as inhibitory gabaergic receptors in the pontine-mesencephalic brain region, are involved in the modulation of the urinary bladder function.", 
    "39": "Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative, is a hypnotic useful for premedication. Four milligrams given orally, intramuscularly or intravenously, is more effective than many other agents, including diazepam, in attenuating the psychic sequelae of ketamine administration. This study compares the efficacy of intravenous administration of 2 mg of lorazepam with that of 10 mg of diazepam. The results reveal that the lower dose of lorazepam is superior to 10 mg of diazepam in taming ketamine sequelae. Therefore, lorazepam is suggested for use instead of the higher dose of diazepam.", 
    "40": "Fetal movement was examined in 200 pregnancies to establish normal patterns, influencing factors, possible clinical value and practical application. The mean number of movements per hour was 26 in hospitalized and 40 in ambulatory patients. These values remained fairly steady throughout pregnancy except for a significant decrease in the week preceding labor. Individual variations were large. The number of movements was uninfluenced by parity and fetal sex but was lower for small-for-gestational-age babies, in mothers suffering from both hypertension and diabetes and in mothers treated with diazepam. Fetal movement count may be used as a parameter of fetal well-being.", 
    "41": "Ataranalgesia, an intravenous anesthetic technique, based on flunitrazepam and ketamine is described. Using balanced combinations of these drugs, with and without the addition of nitrous oxide and oxygen, this technique can cover a wide spectrum of anesthetic practice including pediatric and cardiovascular surgery. Over a period of six months, ataranalgesia with spontaneous respiration was used in 88% of all medium and minor gynecological procedures performed at our hospital for a total of 1194 anesthetics. Seventy percent of these anesthetics were given to outpatients. Cardiovascular stability was the most prominent feature of the technique. Heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (BP) increases were found to be inversely related to pre-operative values. Circulatory effects were not influenced by variation in premedicants.", 
    "42": "Withdrawal syndromes after discontinuation of benzodiazepine or meprobamate administration are rarely observed, in spite of the large number of prescriptions given. Similar manifestations are noted as after barbiturate withdrawal, and appear 1 to 10 days after sudden interruption of prolonged treatment at high doses. The 6 cases reported include 4 patients with withdrawal syndromes after benzodiazepines (diazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam) and 2 after meprobamate. No evidence of epilepsy was found in the patients, who were hospitalized for treatment after suicidal attempts, or medication overdosage (phenothiazine) in one case. Withdrawal symptoms appeared between the 2nd and 7th day with confusion and/or generalized convulsions and paroxystic changes with slow spike-wave type on EEG tracings. In such cases, precise information must be obtained about previous medication in order that it may be readministered and the diagnosis of epilepsy avoided in patients with withdrawal symptoms.", 
    "43": "The efficacy of halazepam and clorazepate were studied in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Sixty-four patients with symptoms of anxiety were treated single-blind with placebo for one week; at the end of the week, all patients scored 18 or higher on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and were entered into the the double-blind phase of the study. They were randomly assigned to four weeks of treatment with halazepam (80 to 160 mg), clorazepate (15 to 30 mg), or placebo, each administered in a single dose at bedtime. Dosage was adjusted to fit patient needs. Patients were evaluated weekly using both physician and patient rating scales. At 19/20 time points, mean values for improvement from baseline on physician-rated measures of efficacy (global and relative evaluations, Hamilton Anxiety Scale and its two factors, psychic and somatic) showed statistically significant differences (P less than or equal to 0.10, two-tailed) favoring halazepam over placebo. Clorazepate was statistically better at 18/20 time points. Patient-rated measures of efficacy (global evaluations, Hopkins Self-Rating Scale), while showing more variability in response, tended in the same direction. Comparison of the halazepam and clorazepate treatment groups on the physician's rating of relative improvement after three and four weeks of treatment showed patients treated with halazepam significantly more improved than those treated with clorazepate (P less than 0.10). Similar differences in favor of halazepam were observed at the same time points on paired comparison of percent improvement from baseline in scores for physician's global assessment of psychopathology and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale. It is concluded that halazepam and clorazepate, when administered in a single bedtime dose, are safe and effective agents for the relief of anxiety. Daytime somnolence was not a problem with either drug and no serious or unexpected side effects occurred.", 
    "44": "A new benzodiazepine, chlordesmethyldiazepam, was administered at a dose of 6 mg/day to 27 patients (18 neurotics and 9 psychotics) with the common symptom of anxiety. The study period was limited to eight days for the whole group, although the drug has been given to some patients for 38 days. Changes in global scores in neurotic patients were determined by administering the Wittenborn and Hamilton rating scales. In psychotic patients the same rating scales were used in addition to the BPRS. A multistimulator was used to evaluate the performance recording complex reaction times (CRT). The statistical evaluation of results shows a highly significant amelioration of all the studied parameters except for reaction times in the psychotic group.", 
    "45": "Our study show that lorazepam calms the child very well before his operation, as long as a minimum dose of 0.04 mg/kg is administered; if one wishes to increase the chances of provoking complete or incomplete amnesia, the dose must be increased to 0.05 mg/kg, administering a dose of 0.06 mg/kg does not increase the percentage of amnesia but provoked a side effect which is not very agreeable from the point of view of nursing and one to which our anesthetics technique has not accustomed us: sleepiness. Lastly the pre-operatory vomitting being almost certainly linked with the administration per os, an effort should be made to improve the presentation, so keeping the advantages of premedication without giving an injection to the child; furthermore as far as possible, the presentation should permit a sufficiently precise evaluation of the quantity to be administered, even though slight errors are here of no consequence due to the very large margin of security.", 
    "46": "Clobazam (Frisium) was hydrolyzed according to three methods commonly used in the determination of 1.4-benzo-diazepines; the reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and thin-layer chromatography. Five degradation products were obtained for which structure proposals are discussed. After oral intake two of these substances were also detected in human urine. It should be recognized that some of the above mentioned substances may be on-column degradation products of artifacts occurring during hydrolyzation and/or sample clean-up.", 
    "47": "Four benzodiazepine tranquilizers have been tested, alone or in combination with scopolamine, on the spontaneous locomotor activity of BALB/c mice. Scopolamine-induced locomotor stimulation was enhanced by chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, and medazepam, but not by bromazepam. These effects are similar to those exerted by the four benzodiazepines on amphetamine-induced locomotor stimulation and allow the same differentiation between the four derivatives.", 
    "48": "Four benzodiazepine tranquilizers have been tested, alone or in combination with amphetamine, on spontaneous locomotor activity of C57BL/6 mice. Amphetamine-induced locomotor stimulation was enhanced by chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, and medazepam, but not by bromazepam. The results indicate that benzodiazepine derivatives may be somewhat differentiated on the basis of their interactions with amphetamine.", 
    "49": "Twelve healthy male volunteers were treated (double-blind crossover design) with tofisopam (a new 3,4-benzodiazepine), diazepam, or placebo, on 2 consecutive days each. Psychomotor skills were impaired after a single dose of diazepam (10 mg) given on day 1. Measurements on day 2 showed that some tolerance had developed to the diazepam-induced impairment of reactive and coordinative skills, but not to its effects on flicker fusion or on the extraocular muscle balance. Tofisopam failed to impair performance both as a single dose (100 mg) and after repeated doses (100 + 50 + 50 + 100 mg). The subjects felt more fatigue, dizziness, calmness, and passiveness after diazepam than after tofisopam. When either drug was given together with 0.8 g/kg ethanol on day 2, the breath ethanol concentrations were 0.7--1.0 mg/ml and all psychomotor skills were impaired. Diazepam + ethanol particularly impaired memory and learning as well. After this combination the subjects were classified (time anticipation test) as 'disqualified drivers' more often than after placebo. It is concluded that diazepam, as well as either benzodiazepine with ethanol, may reduce the ability to drive vehicles or operate machinery.", 
    "50": "Dipotassium chlorazepate (DPC) was administered to ten patients (five males and five females), ages 18-37 years (mean 27.4), as a once daily dose of 50 mg until a steady state was reached. Plasma concentrations of the main metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam (DMD) were monitored by a high pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method during the medication period and for 5 days after withdrawal of the drug. The plasma half life (t1/2), the elimination coefficient (K beta), the steady state concentration (Css), and the apparent volume of distribution (V beta), were calculated at steady state and the mean values +/- SEM were 44 +/- 5 h. 0.0184 +/- 0.0026 h(-1), 1590 +/- 163 ng/ml and 1.41 +/- 0.17 l/kg, respectively. A moderate inter-individual variability was observed. There was no tendency towards dose dependent elimination.", 
    "51": "The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of single and repeated doses of triazolam (1 mg/kg IP) and desipramine (DMI) (10 mg/kg IP) alone and in combination on certain pharmacologic responses and brain catecholamine levels in rats. The significant findings were: (1) triazolam and DMI given alone and in combination were synergistic with pentobarbital (PB) hypnosis; (2) repeated treatment with DMI alone repressed body weight gain; triazolam potentiated this anorectic effect; (3) triazolam induced muscle relaxation acutely, but was not affected by concomitant DMI treatment; and (4) triazolam and DMI given in combination produced hypothermia although the drugs given separately did not. Development of tolerance to hypothermia and to anorectic effects produced by triazolam and DMI significantly decreased norepinephrine (NE) levels in the hypothalamus as compared to the repeated treatment with triazolam, and significantly increased NE and dopamine (DA) levels in the striatum and DA levels in the cortex, as compared to the single treatments.", 
    "52": "This study evaluated the effects of flurazepam 30 mg, lorazepam 4 mg, triazolam 0.5 mg, and placebo upon sleep and memory in eleven normal male subjects continuously monitored for nighttime EEG, EOG, and EMG recording. Subjects received each drug or placebo for two consecutive nights per week for 4 weeks in a repeated measures, double-blind, Latin Square design. Three hours post-administration, subjects were awakened and presented with a series of tasks. Recall was assessed immediately following task presentation and after the final morning awakening. The results showed that every drug significantly decreased stage 1, increased stage 2, and produced no change in stage 3--4 sleep in comparison to placebo. Only lorazepam significantly decreased REM percent. Post-drug recall was significantly decreased in comparison to placebo at night and was further decreased in the morning. Morning recall was significantly poorer when the return to sleep was 2.5 min or less than when the return to sleep was greater than 5 min following the nighttime awakening in all drug conditions. These results indicate that 1. failure of memory consolidation rather than failure of retrieval is the most likely explanation for the morning memory loss and 2. hypnotic drug properties, measured by latency to fall back asleep, affect memory consolidation.", 
    "53": "[3H]Flunitrazepam ([3H]FNZ) specifically binds to a single class of sites in calf cortex homogenate at a level of about 1 pmol/mg protein. Essentially all binding sites sediment after a 30 min centrifugation at 20,000 X g. The affinity of the sites decreases with increasing temperature both in a homogenate and in a washed membranes preparation. Binding sites in the washed membranes preparation display lower affinity than those in the homogenate (e.g., KD of 14.8 nM vs. 7.6 nM respectively at 37 degrees C), but membrane-sites affinity can be increased by aliquots of high-speed supernatant as well as by GABA (> 10(-7) M). GABA has only a small effect on the on-reaction but slows the off-reaction. The binding sites require chloride ions (approximately 100 mM) for optimal activity, are inhibited by Hg+2, and are partially released into a high-speed supernatant by several detergents.", 
    "54": "The efficacy and side effects of 2 mg of lorazepam, 30 mg of oxazepam, and 20 mg of temazepam as sleeping aids were investigated in 20 psychogeriatric inpatients. The drugs were administered in a random order, double-blind, for 7 night each. All of these short half-life benzodiazepines proved efficacious in maintaining sleep. None of them reduced initial sleep latency. Oxazepam and to a lesser degree temazepam induced withdrawal insomnia during the first night after the treatments. The withdrawal of lorazepam induced a delayed but prolonged insomnia in 3 patients. Both lorazepam and oxazepam had muscle relaxant side effects after awakening.", 
    "55": "Pharmacotherapy is crucial to the emergency psychiatric treatment of patients who are out of control in a variety of psychiatric and medical disorders. The time required for the more definitive pharmacological treatment of the major psychiatric syndromes is such that they can best be only started in the emergency setting. The emergency treatment of patients who are severely agitated, violent, or psychotic is based on IM administration of antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol. In conjunction with psychological support this can provide effective, safe, and humane treatment. Sedative-hypnotics, such as diazepam, can be helpful for less severe anxiety states. This article focused on clinical and pharmacokinetic principles of the use of these medications, the understanding of which can help maximize their effective use in emergencies. Topics which are emphasized include sedative, antipsychotic and disinhibiting effects, side effects, absorption after oral and IM administration, and the concepts of steady-state kinetics and the \"loading dose.\"", 
    "56": "A post-marketing surveillance study of Euhypnos Forte (temazepam 20 mg) capsules for the treatment of insomnia in 10,057 patients previously unresponsive to other hypnotics given in conventional doses. Patients were prescribed a nightly dose of 40 or 60 mg, but 95% actually took 40 mg. At 2 weeks, 89% of patients found the treatment effective, as did 95% at 3 months. Hangover, severe enough to stop treatment, occurred in less than 3% of patients, and other adverse reactions such as headache, dreams, gastrointestinal disturbance and hangover symptoms were reported by only 6% of patients at 2 weeks and 4% at 3 months. The most common reason for stopping treatment was the patient having no further need for hypnotics. Euhypnos Forte was effective in 88% of 3,800 patients who had found nitrazepam unsatisfactory and 90% of 1,013 patients unresponsive to barbiturates.", 
    "57": "Compared to placebo, ketazolam given once daily was more effective in alleviating the symptoms of anxiety than was diazepam given three times a day in this 28-day double-blind study in fifty-six out-patients. Ketazolam patients reported fewer, milder side-effects than diazepam patients. In particular, drowsiness was reported less than 8% as often during ketazolam treatment as during diazepam treatment.", 
    "58": "To date 39 studies have been published on the relationships between the plasma levels of polycyclic antidepressants and their clinical efficacy. The results of 24 of these studies show significant relationships to variable degrees. No correlation was found in the others 15. This quota does not seem to be changed by preliminary results of studies not yet published. The particular analysis of 34 of these studies indicates that plasma levels of two tricyclic (nortriptyline and imipramine) are unequivocally related to clinical efficacy (plasma levels of imipramine are the results of imipramine and desipramine cumulated levels). The correlations are the highest for non delusionnal endogenous depressions. The results are contradictory for amitriptyline, a fact which may be attributed to methodological discrepancies such as: the choice of diagnositc criteria, the choice of sampling week, the number of samples, the sensitiveness and the specificity of the analysis. More recents drugs (butriptyline, maprotiline, mianserine, etc.) have led to a limited number of studies, yet insufficient to allow conclusions. The neuroleptic association increases the plasma levels of polycyclic antidepressants. Benzodiazepines do not change them whereas all the hepatic enzymaic inductors decrease them.", 
    "59": "The efficiency of hemodialysis and controlled sequential ultradiffusion (CSU) for the elimination of toxic drug concentrations was tested by in vitro-investigations. In the 6 benzodiazepin derivatives tested, the clearance is markedly higher at a blood flow of 200 ml/min than at 100 ml/min. Pyrithyldione, glutethimide and phenobarbital are better dialysed than the benzodiazepines with exception of chlordiazepoxide. In comparison with hemodialysis, hemofiltration by means of CSU was less effective because of the small amount of ultrafiltrate obtained.", 
    "60": "Mnemic disturbances occurred in 8 of 14 subjects during a pharmcopsychological investigation of possible interactions between alcohol and dipotassium chlorazepate (Tranxilium). The blood alcohol concentrations were between 0.87% and 1.32%; the serum concentrations of the active metabolite nordiazepam were in the therapeutic range between 145 ng/ml and 345 ng/ml. The constitutional, dispositional, and situative conditions are presented. The forensic medical interpretation of such mnemic disturbances must be made critically and with reservation when evaluating a psychopathological state.", 
    "61": "A survey was carried out among 150 Swedish company doctors to assess their attitudes towards 2 benzodiazepines and 4 neuroleptics widely used as minor tranquillizers. The participants rated their opinions on 6 drug characteristics considered important when prescribing anxiolytics. The profile for the two benzodiazepines, diazepam and oxazepam, showed that whilst these drugs were regarded as having a greater anxiolytic effect than the neuroleptics they were also considered as having a higher amount of negative effects compared to the neuroleptics as a hole. The neuroleptics had a more varied profile than the benzodiazepines. Two of the neuroleptics, flupenthixol and especially fluphenazine, had a more favourable profile than the other two, dixyrazine and thioridazine, being regarded as having a greater anxiolytic effect without a greater amount of negative effects. The more favourable profiles for flupenthixol and fluphenazine are probably an indication that these two drugs are used with satisfactory results in special clinical situations when it is more important to avoid possible side-effects.", 
    "62": "A single bedtime dose of 120 mg of halazepam was effective in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate anxiety. This dose was superior to both placebo and a 60 mg dose in this 2-week study, as shown by both physician and patient rating scales. The safety of single bedtime doses of halazepam was confirmed. All the reported side-effects were known adverse experiences to benzodiazepines in general.", 
    "63": "A double-blind crossover study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of hypnotics in geriatric insomniacs. Twenty-seven patients with a mean age of 70 years (range 60-94 years) received each of five treatments on 5 consecutive nights. The treatment conditions, consisting of chloral hydrate 250 and 500 mg, triazolam 0.25 and 0.50 mg, and placebo, were administered using a Latin Square design. Subjective estimates of sleep were collected in the morning following each treatment night. The patients' global evaluation of effectiveness indicated that triazolam 0.25 mg and 0.50 mg improved sleep more than placebo, while chloral hydrate 250 and 500 mg were not better than placebo. Triazolam 0.50 mg was felt to be significantly better than either dose of chloral hydrate. In addition, triazolam 0.50 mg was found to significantly decrease the patients' estimates of their sleep latency. Patients estimated their total sleep time to be longer following the use of triazolam 0.25 mg as compared to choral hydrate 500 mg, and their estimates of the number of awakenings was significantly lower on triazolam 0.50 mg than it was on chloral hydrate 500 mg or placebo.", 
    "64": "1. Repeated doses of triazolam 0.5 mg and mitrazepam 10 mg were given to two groups of consenting volunteers. 2. Measures of choice reaction time, critical flicker fusion threshold, and mental arithmetic ability were made the morning following nocturnal medication with either the active drug or placebo. 3. The subjects' assessment of sleep and early morning behaviour were obtained on 10 cm-line visual analogue scales. 4. Both drugs were rated as effective hypnotics while, at the same time, ratings of the ease of awakening from sleep and the errors produced in a mental arithmetic task were impaired. 5. Objective measures of performance and subjective reports of \"hangover\" differentiated nitrazepam from triazolam. A significant impairment of early morning performance found with nitrazepam was not found following treatment with triazolam.", 
    "65": "Acute doses of various sedative and anxiolytic preparations were administered to consenting volunteers and the effects measured on both subjective and objective assessments of sleep and early morning behaviour. Nitrazepam was used as the benzodiazepine hypnotic, dichloralphenazone as the standard non-benzodiazepine hypnotic and clobazam as the representative anxiolytic preparation. The acute dose nature of the study produced variable results, but a degree of disruption of performance the morning following nocturnal medication was measured. This suggested that anxiolytics and sedatives might potentiate one another and the resulting disorganisation of behaviour might be important in patient populations having to drive motor vehicles.", 
    "66": "3-N,N-Dimethylcarbamoyloxy-7-chloro-5-phenyl-1-methyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-ben zodiazepin-2-one (Camazepam), a new anxiolytic benzodiazepine with weak muscle relaxant and hypnotic effect, was tested versus diazepam and placebo on reaction time to visual and acustic stimuli with a double-blind cross-over design carried out on 11 healthy volunteer human subjects. The response to acoustic stimuli was more rapid than that to visual stimuli with all the three treatments. The pattern of reaction times after camazepam was similar to that after placebo; diazepam retarded reaction times, with the maximum effect 1 h after the administration. A single dose of camazepam and diazepam considered active on anxiety showed a different effect on reaction times, in that they were not altered by camazepam and were lengthened by diazepam, in comparison with placebo. Data show that 10 mg of camazepam giving an anxiolytic effect do not alter the physical performance."
