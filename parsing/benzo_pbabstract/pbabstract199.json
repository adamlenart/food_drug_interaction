The process used today was developed over many years of rigorous study, experimentation, success, and failure. Early cardiac surgery was performed blindly, through small incisions, on a beating heart. Advances in medicine allowed surgery to be performed on hearts stilled by cardioplegic arrest, while the circulation was continued through the use of a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine. The development of the CPB machine allowed surgeons to perform the delicate work of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), first attempted on dogs, and then humans. This article briefly outlines the historical evolution of cardiac surgery that led to the development of the technology necessary to perform off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB). A case report of a 72-year-old female who underwent OPCAB is outlined. Included is a discussion of some of the benefits and potential complications of CABG and OPCAB. Anesthetic considerations for OPCAB procedures also are presented.", 
    "1": "Although there only have been a limited number of double-blind, placebo controlled trials, antipsychotics are considered to be effective drugs for the treatment of tics in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS). Evidence concerning the efficacy of olanzapine and other atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of tics in GTS is growing, but still limited. Little is known about the use of olanzapine in adult GTS patients and about its effect on comorbid behavioural problems. We report on the use of olanzapine in a 25-year old male GTS patient with comorbid obsessive-compulsive behaviours, who was treated with olanzapine. Tic severity was rated using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (Y-GTSS). Comorbid obsessive-compulsive symptoms were assessed with the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Both scales were performed at admission and after 4 weeks of treatment with olanzapine. Treatment with olanzapine (20 mg) resulted not only in a fast reduction of tic severity and frequency, but also in a reduction of obsessive-compulsive behaviours.", 
    "2": "This case report further supports the available literature on the use of olanzapine as a therapeutic strategy for tics in GTS and draws attention to its possible use for comorbid behavioural disorders. Further research of antipsychotics in GTS should include measurements of comorbid behavioural symptom clusters.",

    "5": "During an 18-month period, 116 children received K/M for procedural sedation analgesia in the ED. For this study, 80 children met inclusion criteria: 33 patients received K/M only; 32 received K/M and morphine, and 15 received K/M and meperidine. In comparing the K/M only group with the K/M morphine and K/M meperidine groups, the mean ketamine and midazolam doses (mg/kg) were not significantly different. In comparing the recovery times (minutes) for the K/M only group (29.7; SD, 15.7) with the K/M morphine (41.1; SD, 22.4) and K/M meperidine (50.1; SD, 24.9) groups, there was a significant difference for both comparisons (95% confidence interval for difference between 2 means, -20.9 to -1.76 and -32.2 to -8.4, respectively).", 
    "6": "Sedation (K/M) recovery time is significantly greater for children receiving initial pain treatment (morphine or meperidine). Children receiving meperidine had the longest recovery time. Considering this prolonged recovery time and the unique adverse effects of meperidine compared with morphine, we recommend meperidine not be used for initial ED pain treatment of children.", 
    "7": "Dual-process theories of recognition memory hypothesize separate underlying familiarity and recollection processes, but the necessity of multiple processes is debated. Previous research has suggested that scalp-recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) may index the activity of separate familiarity and recollection processes. Other research indicates that the amnestic drug midazolam impairs recollection more than familiarity. Here, we used a convergent pharmacological and electrophysiological approach to manipulate and monitor human brain activity and provide evidence for separate processes. Midazolam selectively influenced the putative ERP-correlate of recollection but not the putative ERP-correlate of familiarity. Under control conditions (saline), subjects' accuracy correlated with the recollection-related but not the familiarity-related ERP component, suggesting that recollection was dominant in driving memory. The opposite pattern was observed under midazolam administration, suggesting that when recollection fails, subjects may leverage familiarity to compensate. Thus, in contrast to perspectives holding that familiarity represents the default process, these results suggest that recollection was dominant until its impairment unveiled the influence of familiarity.", 
    "8": "A series of N,N-dialkyl-2-phenylindol-3-ylglyoxylamides bearing the halogens iodine and bromine were synthesised and their binding affinity for the peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites (PBBS) in rat kidney mitochondrial membranes was evaluated using [(3)H]PK11195. Central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) affinities were also evaluated in rat cortices using [(3)H]flumazenil to determine their selectivity for PBBS over CBR. The tested compounds had PBBS binding affinities (IC(50)) ranging from 7.86 to 618 nM, with all compounds showing high selectivity over the CBR (CBR IC(50) > 5000 nM). Among the 12 compounds tested, those with a diethylamide group were the most potent. The highest affinity iodinated PBBS ligand, N,N-diethyl-[5-chloro-2-(4-iodophenyl)indol-3-yl]glyoxylamide, was radiolabelled with iodine-123. This high affinity and selective radioligand may be useful for imaging neurodegeneration, inflammation and tumours using single photon emission computed tomography.", 
    "9": "Clinical evidence suggests that atypical antipsychotic drugs might reduce alcohol drinking and help to maintain abstinence. This study aimed to compare the effects of two widely used atypical antipsychotic drugs clozapine and olanzapine on alcohol intake in alcohol-preferring AA (Alko, Alcohol) rats that were taught to drink 10% alcohol in a 4 h limited access paradigm. Effects of acute clozapine (0, 0.3, 1.0 and 5.0 mg/kg) and olanzapine (0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.25 mg/kg) treatments on the limited access alcohol drinking were studied. In repeated treatment experiment, clozapine (1.0 mg/kg) or olanzapine (0.5 mg/kg) was administered once daily, before limited access alcohol drinking session, over 5 successive days. To reveal any effect of the drugs selective for alcohol drinking, alcohol was exchanged with 0.1% saccharin solution for the 4 h limited access, and acute treatments were repeated. Effects of the drugs on ambulatory locomotor activity were tested with doses that were used in the acute experiments. Acute clozapine treatment had no effect on either alcohol or saccharin drinking, but olanzapine significantly reduced 4 h alcohol drinking. Repeated olanzapine treatment significantly reduced 4 h alcohol drinking when compared with vehicle or clozapine, but a tolerance developed to this effect. Repeated clozapine treatment produced no significant effect compared with vehicle. Both drugs significantly reduced locomotor activity. In conclusion, the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine non-selectively reduced alcohol drinking, while clozapine failed to do so, even if both were administered at pharmacologically effective doses.", 
    "10": "A series of novel pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD) hybrids linked with indole carboxylates is described. These compounds were prepared by linking C-8 of 3 (DC-81) with an indole 2-carbonyl moiety (9) through carbon chain linkers to afford PBD hybrid agents 17-21 in good yields. Preliminary in vivo tests show that these hybrid agents have potent antitumor activity. The cytotoxic studies of the hybrid agents on human melanoma A2058 cells indicate most of the hybrids induced higher cytotoxicity, better DNA-binding ability, an increase in the apoptotic sub-G1 population, and a significant reduction in deltapsi(mt) relative to compound 3. In addition, DNA flow cytometric analysis shows that hybrids actively induce a marked loss of cells from the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, which progresses to early apoptosis as detected by flow cytometry after double-staining with annexin V and propidium iodide (PI). Thus, we suggest that the hybrid agents are potent inducers of cell apoptosis in A2058 cells.", 
    "11": "Dementia is one of the age related mental problems and a characteristic symptom of various neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Certain drugs like diazepam, barbiturates and alcohol disrupt learning and memory in animals and man. However, a new class of drugs known as nootropic agents is now used in situations where there is organic disorder in learning abilities. The present work was undertaken to assess the potential of O. sanctum extract as a nootropic and anti-amnesic agent in mice. Aqueous extract of dried whole plant of O. sanctum ameliorated the amnesic effect of scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg), diazepam (1 mg/kg) and aging induced memory deficits in mice. Elevated plus maze and passive avoidance paradigm served as the exteroceptive behavioral models. O. sanctum extract decreased transfer latency and increased step down latency, when compared to control (piracetam treated), scopolamine and aged groups of mice significantly. O. sanctum preparations could of beneficial in the treatment of cognitive disorders such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "12": "Although benzodiazepines are the standard of care in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal, several studies have suggested that anticonvulsants may be equally effective at alleviating alcohol withdrawal symptoms and may pose less of a risk of causing rebound of symptoms which could contribute to relapse. This report compares treatment outcomes for patients (N=13) treated for alcohol withdrawal with either the anticonvulsant tiagabine or the benzodiazepines oxazepam and lorazepam. The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-revised (CIWA-Ar) was utilized to gauge alcohol withdrawal symptoms over the course of the study. When possible, follow-up data was obtained on alcohol use post-treatment. Both benzodiazepines and tiagabine appeared to reduce CIWA-Ar scores at about the same magnitude. There was a trend for tiagabine patients to have less post-detoxification drinking (Fisher exact test, p = 0.12). The reduction in alcohol withdrawal symptoms and decreased tendency to relapse observed in patients treated with the anticonvulsant tiagabine suggests that a double-blind, placebo controlled trial may be warranted.",

    "45": "The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is an 18-kDa high affinity drug- and cholesterol-binding protein that is involved in various cell functions, including cell proliferation and apoptosis. PBR was shown to be overexpressed in certain types of malignant human tumors and cancer cell lines, correlating with enhanced tumorigenicity and cell proliferation rates. The present study was conducted in order to further define the role of PBR in cancer and to extend our recent findings regarding the possible anticancer effects of the standardized Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761. Treatment with EGb 761 decreased PBR mRNA levels and inhibited the proliferation of breast, glioma and hepatocarcinoma cell lines, further corroborating our previous contention that its mechanism of action is through the modification of PBR expression. In vivo treatment with Ginkgo biloba extract led to dose-dependent decreases in xenograft growth of both MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and U-87 glioma cell lines in nude mice, although the effects were not maintained after 50 days of treatment in the latter. The results obtained in MDA-MB-231 xenografts indicated pronounced inhibition of tumor growth, verified by MRI imaging. These results were obtained using a modified experimental protocol where the animals were treated with the extract before cell inoculation. Although an exact role for PBR in relation to the initiation and progression of various types of cancer remains to be defined, our results indicate that PBR overexpression in certain cancer cells is related to an aggressive phenotype. Since EGb 761 treatment opposes this aggressive phenotype by decreasing PBR overexpression, it could be useful in preventing or treating cancer invasiveness and metastasis.",

We report on a 38-year-old woman with MELAS presenting with multifocal CPSE and periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) on EEG during her first strokelike episode. CT scan documented a right temporo-parieto-occipital strokelike lesion. EEG showed prolonged seizure discharges with alternating focus over the temporo-occipital and frontotemporal regions of the right hemisphere; moreover, right frontotemporal PLEDs were evident when the seizure activity was localized in the temporo-occipital region. The electroclinical status and CT findings normalized gradually on carbamazepine therapy. The four other patients with MELAS described in the literature as presenting with CPSE showed unifocal epileptic discharges on EEG.

A number of anticonvulsants including valproate and carbamazepine have been shown to be safe and effective alternatives to benzodiazepines for treating alcohol withdrawal. These agents are relatively safe, are free from demonstrated abuse liability, and do not usually potentiate the psychomotor and cognitive effects of alcohol. For the treatment of alcohol dependence, there is a growing literature on the utility of medications that have neurochemical effects at opioid, serotonergic, GABAergic, and glutamate receptors. Furthermore, as a class of medication, there appears to be a growing interest in investigating the utility of novel anticonvulsants such as topiramate for the treatment of alcohol dependence.", 
    "54": "Local inhibition within the spinal cord dorsal horn is mediated by the neurotransmitters GABA and glycine and strongly influences nociceptive and temperature signaling. Alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors are expressed by inhibitory interneurons and have been shown to modulate GABA release in other regions of the CNS. In the spinal cord, there is morphological evidence for presynaptic AMPA receptor subunits in GABAergic dorsal horn neurons, but functional data are lacking. To determine if AMPA receptors are indeed functional at presynaptic terminals of inhibitory neurons, we recorded evoked and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSPs) in the superficial dorsal horn of the rat spinal cord. We show that AMPA receptor activation enhances spontaneous release of inhibitory amino acids in the presence of tetrodotoxin onto both lamina II neurons and NK1 receptor-expressing (NK1R+) lamina I neurons. This effect is sensitive to the concentration of extracellular Ca2+, yet is not fully blocked in most neurons in the presence of Cd2+, suggesting possible Ca2+ entry through AMPA receptors. Postsynaptic Ca2+ elevation is not required for these changes. AMPA-induced increases in mIPSP frequency are also seen in more mature dorsal horn neurons, indicating that these receptors may play a role in nociceptive processing in the adult. In addition, we have observed AMPA-induced depression of evoked release of GABA and glycine onto lamina I NK1R+ neurons. Taken together these data support a role for presynaptic AMPA receptors in modulating release of GABA and glycine in the superficial dorsal horn. Because inhibition in the dorsal horn is important for controlling pain signaling, presynaptic AMPA receptors acting to modulate the inhibitory inputs onto dorsal horn neurons would be expected to impact upon pain signaling in the spinal cord dorsal horn.", 
    "55": "Opioid and serotonergic mechanisms of the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) are recruited by conditioned freezing and antinociception. However, it is unclear whether freezing and antinociception induced by stimulation of the vlPAG are interrelated. To address this issue we looked at the effects of the opioid antagonist naltrexone, the 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin, and the benzodiazepine agonist midazolam injected into the vlPAG on the freezing and antinociception induced by electrical stimulation of this region. This antinociception was evaluated by the tail-flick and formalin tests. To further characterize the involvement of the vlPAG in unconditioned fear, the effects of intra-vlPAG injections of midazolam on the exploratory behavior were also assessed in independent groups of rats submitted to the elevated plus-maze test (EPM). The data obtained showed that: (i) electrical stimulation of the vlPAG causes freezing blocked by midazolam but not by naltrexone and ketanserin; (ii) antinociception generated at the level of the vlPAG is inhibited by naltrexone, ketanserin, and midazolam; (iii) activation of benzodiazepine-mediated mechanisms in the vlPAG increased the exploratory behavior of rats in the closed arms but not the avoidance behavior of open arms of the EPM. Thus, freezing and antinociception generated in the vlPAG are dissociated pharmacologically. Whereas antinociception is a multimediated process sensitive to naltrexone, ketanserin, and midazolam, the freezing induced by vlPAG stimulation was reversed only by the benzodiazepine compound. As injections of midazolam into the vlPAG do not cause anxiolytic effects in the EPM, the aversive stimuli inherent of this test seem to bypass the vlPAG.",

    "57": "Neurosteroids represent a class of endogenous compounds that exert rapid, nongenomic effects through neurotransmitter receptor systems such as gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)). Two neurosteroids, allopregnanolone (3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one) and pregnanolone (3alpha-hydroxy-5beta-pregnan-20-one), possess anxiolytic and sedative properties and show substitution for ethanol, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates in drug discrimination assays. A previous study examining the discriminative stimulus effects of 10 mg/kg pregnanolone in DBA/2J and C57BL/6J mice showed pregnanolone's discriminative stimulus to be mediated primarily through GABA(A) positive modulation. This study examined the discriminative stimulus effects of a lower training dose (5.6 mg/kg) of pregnanolone in DBA/2J and C57BL/5J mice. Twelve male DBA/2J mice and 12 male C57BL/6J mice were trained to discriminate 5.6 mg/kg pregnanolone. GABA(A)-receptor positive modulators, neuroactive steroids, NMDA receptor antagonists, and 5-HT(3) receptor agonists were tested for pregnanolone substitution. In DBA/2J and C57BL/6J mice benzodiazepine, barbiturate, and GABAergic neuroactive steroids all substituted for pregnanolone. In the DBA/2J mice, NMDA receptor antagonists showed generalization to the discriminative stimulus cues of pregnanolone, an effect not seen in the C57BL/6J mice. 5-HT(3) receptor agonists and zolpidem failed to substitute for pregnanolone's discriminative stimulus in either strain. AlloTHDOC and midazolam were more potent in producing pregnanolone-like discriminative stimulus effects in DBA/2J mice. These results provide a comprehensive look at pregnanolone's discriminative stimulus effects in two commonly used strains of mice. The present data suggest GABA(A)-receptor positive modulation as the predominant receptor mechanism mediating the discriminative stimulus effects of pregnanolone.

    "62": "Clinical findings indicate that co-administration of the isoxazolyl-penicillin flucloxacillin with cyclosporine may reduce the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine. We have explored in the present study if induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 or P-glycoprotein may offer a mechanistic explanation of the observed effects. Flucloxacillin is neither an inhibitor nor a substrate of drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP3A4, 1A2, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6) or P-glycoprotein as shown by an in vitro assay for CYP inhibition, a fluorescent indicator assay for P-glycoprotein inhibition and a functional P-glycoprotein ATPase assay. However, incubation of human LS 180 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with flucloxacillin led to a dose-dependent induction of MDR1 as well as of CYP3A4 mRNA, which was also confirmed in primary human hepatocytes. At high concentrations, flucloxacillin activated the human Pregnane-X-Receptor, PXR, a ligand-dependent transcription factor that is the target of many drugs that induce CYP3A4, with consequences for the metabolism of other drugs. Liver microsomes from control rats or rats, which received for 3 consecutive days 100 mg/kg of oral flucloxacillin, were used to study the metabolism and metabolite pattern of midazolam, a model substrate of CYP 3A4. There was a trend towards a higher intrinsic microsomal clearance of midazolam using microsomes from flucloxacillin treated rats. In addition, there was a significant increase in the formation of the principal midazolam metabolites 1-hydroxy midazolam, 4-hydroxy midazolam and 1,4-dihydroxy midazolam as compared to controls. These findings indicate that flucloxacillin has the potential to induce expression of both CYP3A4 as well as P-glycoprotein, most likely through activation of the nuclear hormone receptor PXR. This would offer an explanation for the observed clinical drug-drug interactions between the antibiotic and cyclosporine.",

Inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in RTN neurons are largely characterized by slow decay kinetics that result in powerful and prolonged suppression of spikes. Here we show that some individual RTN neurons are characterized by highly variable mixtures of fast, slow and mixed IPSCs. Heterogeneity arose largely through differences in the contribution of an initial decay component (tau(D) approximately 10 ms) which was insensitive to loreclezole, suggesting involvement of the GABA(A) receptor beta(1) subunit. Single-cell RT-PCR revealed the presence of beta(1) subunit mRNA only in those neurons whose IPSCs were dominated by a rapid and prominent initial decay phase. These data show that brief, beta(1)-dependent, loreclezole-insensitive IPSCs are present in a subpopulation of RTN neurons, and suggest that striking differences in IPSC heterogeneity within single neurons can result from of the presence or absence of a single GABA(A) receptor subunit.",

    "71": "Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) symptoms include hyperexcitability, anxiety, and sleep disorders. Chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) treatment of rats with subsequent withdrawal of ethanol (EtOH) reproduced AWS symptoms in behavioral assays, which included tolerance to the sleep-inducing effect of acute EtOH and its maintained anxiolytic effect. Electrophysiological assays demonstrated a CIE-induced long-term loss of extrasynaptic GABAA receptor (GABAAR) responsiveness and a gain of synaptic GABAAR responsiveness of CA1 pyramidal and dentate granule neurons to EtOH that we were able to relate to behavioral effects. After CIE treatment, the alpha4 subunit-preferring GABAAR ligands 4,5,6,7 tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol, La3+, and Ro15-4513 (ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5alpha][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) exerted decreased effects on extrasynaptic currents but had increased effects on synaptic currents. Electron microscopy revealed an increase in central synaptic localization of alpha4 but not delta subunits within GABAergic synapses on the dentate granule cells of CIE rats. Recordings in dentate granule cells from delta subunit-deficient mice revealed that this subunit is not required for synaptic GABAAR sensitivity to low [EtOH]. The profound alterations in EtOH sensitivity and alpha4 subunit localization at hippocampal GABAARs of CIE rats suggest that such changes in these and other relevant brain circuits may contribute to the development of tolerance to the sleep-inducing effects and long-term dependence on alcohol.",

Healthy adults received oral midazolam (0.075 mg/kg) on days 1 (baseline), 7, 9, 13, 20, 27, and 34. Oral pleconaril (400 mg) three times daily for 15 doses was administered on days 2 through 7. Blood samples were collected during each day of midazolam dosing to determine plasma midazolam concentrations. On days 5, 6, and 7, blood samples were collected to determine plasma pleconaril concentrations. Midazolam pharmacokinetics were determined by noncompartmental analyses, with bioequivalence assessed by least-squares geometric mean ratios (LS-GMR) and 90% confidence intervals (90% CI). Eighteen subjects completed the study. Midazolam C(max) (LS-GMR; 90% CI) decreased 24% on day 7 (0.76; 0.66-0.87). Midazolam oral clearance increased 53% on day 7 (1.53; 1.38-1.69). Midazolam oral clearance remained different on days 9 (1.38; 1.25-1.52) and 13 (1.19; 1.07-1.31) versus day 1.

This study describes the patterns of flunitrazepam abuse and malicious use calls received by Texas poison centers during 1998-2003. The distribution of calls by year of call, geographic location of caller, patient gender and age, exposure site, and medical outcome were determined. There was no clear annual trend for abuse calls, but there was a consistent decline in the number of malicious use calls. A significantly higher percentage of abuse calls originated in south and west Texas and of malicious use calls in west Texas. Most abuse patients were males (55%) and adolescents (76%), and most of the exposures occurred in patient's own residence (68%), followed by school (16%). Most of the malicious use patients were females (93%) and adults (74%), and the greatest proportion of the exposures occurred in public areas (47%), followed by the patient's own residence (26%). The highest percentage of both abuse (48%) and malicious use (55%) involved minor effects. However, malicious use calls were significantly less likely to involve no effect (2% vs. 21%) and more likely to involve moderate effects (36% vs. 23%). Reported flunitrazepam abuse and malicious use calls in Texas differed with respect to geographic location of the caller, patient gender and age, exposure site, and medical outcome.

    "82": "Considering the physiological Ca2+ dynamics within the ER (endoplasmic reticulum), it remains unclear how efficient protein folding is maintained in living cells. Thus, utilizing the strictly folding-dependent activity and secretion of LPL (lipoprotein lipase), we evaluated the impact of ER Ca2+ content and mitochondrial contribution to Ca2+-dependent protein folding. Exhaustive ER Ca2+ depletion by inhibition of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases caused strong, but reversible, reduction of cell-associated and released activity of constitutive and adenovirus-encoded human LPL in CHO-K1 (Chinese-hamster ovary K1) and endothelial cells respectively, which was not due to decline of mRNA or intracellular protein levels. In contrast, stimulation with the IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate)-generating agonist histamine only moderately and transiently affected LPL maturation in endothelial cells that paralleled a basically preserved ER Ca2+ content. However, in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ or upon prevention of transmitochondrial Ca2+ flux, LPL maturation discontinued upon histamine stimulation. Collectively, these data indicate that Ca2+-dependent protein folding in the ER is predominantly controlled by intraluminal Ca2+ and is largely maintained during physiological cell stimulation owing to efficient ER Ca2+ refilling. Since Ca2+ entry and mitochondrial Ca2+ homoeostasis are crucial for continuous Ca2+-dependent protein maturation in the ER, their pathological alterations may result in dysfunctional protein folding.", 
    "83": "Bipolar depression remains one of the most difficult to treat of all mental disorders. Until recently, no treatments, including antidepressants, have consistently shown to be effective in this condition. Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the acute treatment of mania and maintenance prevention of relapse into depression or mania. A clinical trial tested the relative effectiveness of the combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine in bipolar type I depression, against olanzapine alone or placebo. The combination produced a very robust clinical effect acutely and a long-term follow-up study indicated that there was a low rate of induction of mania or mixed states. Therefore, the olanzapine/fluoxetine combination represents a viable alternative for bipolar depression. However, uptake of this combined product in practice has been modest. This is likely to be the result of several factors, including resistance to the use of fixed combination preparations and, more recently, evidence of effectiveness of the atypical quetiapine and the anticonvulsant lamotrigine. Perhaps the greatest resistance to the use of olanzapine alone or in combination has been the problem of weight gain and the attendant risk of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Vigorous management of this problem has been shown to mitigate the potential for weight gain and is required if this combination is to be used. However, many clinicians find management of weight gain in olanzapine treated patients a challenge. In addition, weight, waist circumference, lipids and glucose should be monitored.",

Saturation experiments showed that [(123)I]IZOL, bound to a single class of binding site (n(H)=0.99) on adrenal and kidney mitochondrial membranes with a moderate affinity (K(d)=30 nM). The density of binding sites was 22+/-6 and 1.2+/-0.4 pmol/mg protein on adrenal and kidney membranes, respectively. No specific binding was observed in mitochondrial-synaptosomal membranes of brain cortex. In biodistribution studies in rats, the highest uptake of [(123)I]IZOL was found 30 min post injection in adrenals (7.5% ID/g), followed by heart, kidney, lung (1% ID/g) and brain (0.12% ID/g), consistent with the distribution of peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites. Pre-administration of unlabelled IZOL and the specific PBBS drugs, PK 11195 and Ro 5-4864 significantly reduced the uptake of [(123)I]IZOL by 30% (p<0.05) in olfactory bulbs and by 51-86% (p<0.01) in kidney, lungs, heart and adrenals, while it increased by 30% to 50% (p<0.01) in the rest of the brain and the blood. Diazepam, a mixed CBR-PBBS drug, inhibited the uptake in kidney, lungs, heart, adrenals and olfactory bulbs by 32% to 44% (p<0.01) but with no effect on brain uptake and in blood concentration. Flumazenil, a central benzodiazepine drug and haloperidol (dopamine antagonist/sigma receptor drug) displayed no effect in [(123)I]IZOL in peripheral organs and in the brain. [(123)I]IZOL may deserve further development for imaging selectively peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "85": "The cornerstone of recent pharmacoeconomic work in schizophrenia is the hypothesis that the improved efficacy of novel antipsychotic medications will lead to a reduction in medical services utilization, thereby reducing direct medical costs associated with treatment. Creating the most valid design to prospectively examine the effectiveness and costs of competing pharmacotherapies requires a dialectic of opposing research paradigms. The final protocol must represent a series of decisions that strike a careful balance between being scientifically sound (internal validity) and generalizable to the real world of clinical treatment (external validity). The results must be useful to decision-makers in determining to what extent reductions in healthcare expenditures can offset higher drug acquisition costs within their type of treatment environment. This article is a review of several methodological challenges in the design of medical effectiveness trials, including whether to blind the study, definition of the patient population, degree of physician discretion in treatment, and how to collect and analyze data for patients who discontinue their originally assigned medication. The article also provides a discussion of how clinical practices can inform decisions made to meet these challenges. The issues are illustrated through a prospective study designed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the newer antipsychotics in general and olanzapine in particular. Cost-effectiveness studies of novel antipsychotic medications, particularly those with naturalistic designs, will increase in importance as the use of these second-generation agents continues to expand.",

A 20-year old woman with an history of bipolar disorder, experienced an acute manic syndrome that made hospitalization necessary. Fourteen days after loxa-pine prescription, the patient developed a NMS (DSM IV criteria) dyskinesia, dysphagia, fever and alteration of cons-ciousness. Hepatic transaminases and muscular enzymes increased. Neuroleptic was immediately interrupted and benzodiazepines (Lorazepam) was started. Biological parameters were normalized after 7 days, hyperpyrexia decreased and extrapyramidal symptoms disappeared but manic symptoms persisted. Two weeks later, the patient presented nega-tivism, rigidity of the four limb, catalepsia and hyperpyrexia. She also had been anxious for death and presented auditory hallucinations. Bacteriological samples and computed tomography were normal. This catatonic symptoms did not decreased and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was necessary. After six ECT, she started standing up, walking, taking food and speaking. After 12 ECT, the clinical state was the same as it was before the acute episod. The patient was then treated with valproate and lorazepam for anxiety symptoms. Acute catatonie, a rare and life-threatening acute syndrome was described in psychosis before the advent of neuroleptic drugs. It's characterized by hyperexia, stupor alternated with exctement, rigidity. Many etiolologic factors have been reported for this affection: psychogenic, organic or toxic. Neuroletic malignant syndrome is a potentially fatal complication of neuroleptic treatment occuring in about 1% of patients treated with neuroleptic. This syndrome is characterised by consciousness alteration, extrapyramidal symptoms, autonomic and thermic disorders. Similar clinical and biological features in catatonia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) suggest a relationship between both affections and common physiopathological mechanisms and neurochemical basis: a central dopamine deficiency. We believe like many authors that catatonia and NMS are two aspects of a same disease, arising the question of chronology of both affections: NMS precipitates catatonia evolution. In the same way, Revuelta reported a case of patient who presented a lethal catatonia worsened by neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome may be related to a dopamine deficiency, predominantly in the basal ganglia and ant\u00e9rior hypothalamus. Dopaminergic impairment has also been postulated to explain hyperthermia and catatonic signs in acute catatonie. ECT increases cerebral concentrations of dopamine, GABA and noradrelanine. The efficacy of ECT also argues for the dopaminergic hypothesis. A relation between those syndromes are complexes. A catatonic syndrome is regard as an acute form of malignant syndrome. In the other way, a severity scores of malignant syndrome are correlated among catatonic signs. In this case report, we suggest that the neuroleptic malignant syndrome accelerate the evolution to catatonic syndrome.",

The mice were administered either the aqueous G. elata extract orally or received an intraperitoneal injection of the phenolic constituents, 1 h before the behavioral evaluation in the EPM. A single treatment of the aqueous G. elata extract significantly increased the percentage of time spent and arm entries into the open arms of the EPM versus the saline controls. Among the phenolic constituents of G. elata, HA and HD significantly increased the percentage of time spent and arm entries into the open arms of the EPM versus saline controls (p<0.05). Moreover, there were no changes in the locomotor activity and myorelaxant effects in any group compared with the saline controls. In addition, the anxiolytic-like effects of G. elata extract were blocked by both WAY 100635 (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.), a 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, and flumazenil (10 mg/kg, i.p.), a GABA(A) receptor antagonist. The anxiolytic-like effects of HA were inhibited by WAY 100635 and the effects of HD were antagonized by flumazenil. These results indicate that G. elata is an effective anxiolytic agent, and suggests that the anxiolytic-like effects of G. elata via the serotonergic nervous system depends on HA and those effects of G. elata via the GABAergic nervous system depends on HD.",

Some of these medications should not be used if at all possible, while others, if used, need to be used with great caution, watching carefully for signs of problems. This article describes a variety of medications which have an increased potential for causing harm in elderly patients and gives alternatives of safer medications consideration.", 
    "108": "Formalin (0.25, 0.5, 3, and 5%) injected into the knee joint of rats induced a dose-dependent nociception that was featured by 2 phases of intense guarding behavior of the affected limb, interposed by a period of quasinormal gait (quiescent phase). The guarding behavior during a period of forced gait was measured by the total time the paw of the affected limb was not in contact with the surface of a revolving cylinder (paw elevation time [PET]). Pretreatment with morphine (4 mg/kg, subcutaneously) reduced PET in both nocifensive phases, and naloxone (1 mg/kg, subcutaneously) antagonized morphine's effect. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) reduced only the second phase of nocifensive responses. A low dose of the benzodiazepine midazolam (0.25 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) significantly reduced only the second phase of response, but a higher dose (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) had no effect. A subconvulsant, anxiogenic dose of pentylenetetrazol (30 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) also did not affect the PET increase induced by formalin. The antihistamine meclizine (2.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) caused an increase of the response in the second phase, but a higher dose (7.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) caused inhibition. The peripheral antihistamine loratadine (5 and 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) also caused an increase of the second phase. Neither antihistamine altered the first phase of PET. These results reproduced previous findings with classical analgesics in formalin-induced nociception. However, the pronociceptive effect of antihistamines, and the antinociceptive effect of midazolam observed here suggest that formalin-induced incapacitation introduces new characterists of nociceptive system that may complement the study of analgesics.", 
    "109": "Anxiety is thought to influence pain experience in an opposing manner depending on nociception originates in cutaneous or deep somatic/visceral tissues. The present formalin-induced nociceptive test may help to predict more reliably the pain-killing effect of new pharmacologic strategies, with classical or nonclassical mechanisms, for the treatment of clinically relevant pains, which are generally originated in deep structures.", 
    "110": "We report a 79-year-old woman with a decreased level of consciousness. Investigation revealed an elevated serum ammonia and a portal-systemic shunt on angiography. Thus, her symptoms were thought to be due to metabolic encephalopathy. Her electroencephalogram (EEG) showed bilaterally synchronous runs of three-phase waves consistent with the triphasic waves typically seen in metabolic encephalopathy. However, after intravenous administration of diazepam, the EEG abnormalities improved; indicating that her decreased consciousness was of epileptic etiology, consistent with spike-wave stupor. Therefore, even in the presence of a clearly defined metabolic disorder, triphasic waves on the EEG may not be due to metabolic encephalopathy; they may reflect an epileptic state precipitated by the metabolic disorder.", 
    "111": "Electrical status epilepticus during sleep syndrome and its variants are age-dependent epileptic encephalopathies associated with a sleep-related electroencephalographic pattern of continuous spike-waves, combined with motor or cognitive impairment. These epileptic encephalopathies are usually not responsive to conventional antiepileptic drugs. This report describes two children in whom clonazepam had no effect on cognitive and motor disorders but controlled spike activity, preventing a proper diagnosis. Withdrawal of clonazepam was accompanied by the recurrence of continuous spike-waves in slow sleep, permitting the diagnosis of electrical status epilepticus during sleep syndrome and appropriate therapeutic decisions. These two cases of the misleading effect of clonazepam in electrical status epilepticus during sleep syndrome illustrate the puzzling situation that can occur when therapeutic options only consider the electroencephalographic features without prior syndromic diagnosis.", 
    "112": "Muscle overactivity, one of the cardinal features of spasticity, is a common sequel of cerebral palsy. In this group of patients spasticity is responsible for several limitations that interfere with gait, causing variable functional disability. Drugs such as baclofen, tizanidine, or benzodiazepines, or even definitive treatments such as orthopedics or neurosurgeries are generally prescribed with uncertain results. The use of botulinum toxin type A has been frequently suggested for the treatment of spastic equinus foot in cerebral palsy, but few studies with adequate methodology support this idea. The present paper reviews and summarizes the data of published double-blind, randomized clinical trials to assess, with a meta-analysis, if botulinum toxin type A is an adequate treatment for spasticity caused by cerebral palsy. The results reveal a statistical superiority of botulinum toxin type A over placebo on gait improvement, tested using the Physician Rating Scale and Video Gait Analysis (Peto odds ratio = 3.99, 95% confidence interval = 2.20-7.22) in patients with spastic equinus foot. The botulinum toxin group also presented better results in the subjective assessment than the placebo group (Peto odds ratio = 3.49, 95% confidence interval = 1.50-8.12). Adverse events were more frequently observed after the use of botulinum toxin type A, but they were considered mild and self-limited.",

    "117": "The progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone, like benzodiazepines, reduces learning and impairs memory in rats. Both substances act as GABA agonists at the GABA-A receptor and impair the performance in the Morris water maze test. Women are during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and during hormone replacement therapy exposed to allopregnanolone or allopregnanolone-like substances for extended periods. Long-term benzodiazepine treatment can cause tolerance against benzodiazepine-induced learning impairments. In this study we evaluated whether a corresponding allopregnanolone tolerance develops in rats. Adult male Wistar rats were pretreated for 3 days with i.v. allopregnanolone injections (2 mg/kg) one or two times a day, or for 7 days with allopregnanolone injections 20 mg/kg intraperitoneally, twice a day. Thereafter the rats were tested in the Morris water maze for 5 days and compared with relevant controls. Rats pretreated with allopregnanolone twice a day had decreased escape latency, path length and thigmotaxis compared with the acute allopregnanolone group that was pretreated with vehicle. Pretreatment for 7 days resulted in learning of the platform position. However, the memory of the platform position was in these tolerant rats not as strong as in controls only given vehicle. Allopregnanolone treatment was therefore seen to induce a partial tolerance against acute allopregnanolone effects in the Morris water maze.", 
    "118": "Cortical neurosteroid levels vary dramatically across development; during the second week of life elevated levels of allopregnanolone are associated with decreased GABA(A) receptor function. Since GABA(A) receptor modulation plays a role in proliferative regulation in developing neocortex, it is possible that endogenous neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone, acting through GABA(A) receptors, modulate cortical development. We augmented normally low levels with exogenous administration of allopregnanolone (10 mg/kg) during the first week of rodent life. The localization of parvalbumin-labeled cells was markedly altered; the ratio of cell number in the deep (layers V-VI) vs. superficial (layers I-III) layers of adult prefrontal cortex increased two-fold in rats administered allopregnanolone on postnatal day 1 or 5. The mechanism underlying these anatomical changes likely involves GABA(A) receptors because similar changes in interneuron placement were observed after neonatal benzodiazepine administration. Measures of mature cortical function were also altered after neonatal neurosteroid administration, including [(3)H]MK-801 binding, prepulse inhibition and amphetamine-induced locomotor activity. Moreover, neonatal allopregnanolone administration increases the number of parvalbumin-expressing neurons in medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus while the total neuron number is decreased. These findings suggest that connectivity between the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus and prefrontal cortex is likely altered by neonatal neurosteroid administration and may result in a disinhibited frontal cortex. Disinhibition in the prefrontal cortex is associated with behavioral changes relevant to human psychosis and developmental disorders. If neurosteroids play a role in normal development of prefrontal/medial dorsal patency as suggested by these studies, then alterations in neurosteroid levels may contribute to abnormal neurodevelopment.", 
    "119": "Among the strategies that can lead to the discovery of new drugs, the identification and use of privileged structures, molecular fragments that are able to interact with more than one target, gained particular attention, in an attempt to find new drugs in a shorter time with respect to other strategies. These structures, that have been identified mainly by empirical observations, can target only a given protein family, or can be able to interact with more, unrelated targets. This review deals with structures not covered in recent papers on this topic, and emphasizes the importance of understanding the structure-target relationships, that confer the privileged status.",

In this review, an effort has been made to highlight academic and industrial examples of combinatorial synthesis for this type of heterocycles published in the last decade. Therefore, it describes synthetic strategies for the generation of benzodiazepine privileged structures employing the corresponding resin-bound substrates. Further, the most relevant biological properties of these heterocycles have also been incorporated.", 
    "121": "Various agents are utilized in the operating room to produce anesthetic effects. These include barbiturates, halogenated inhalation agents, narcotics, non-barbiturate induction agents, and benzodiazepines. These agents have variable effects upon the EEG and EP (evoked potential) waveforms at different anesthetic levels. Metabolic changes such as body temperature and blood pressure can also elicit changes in the EEG and EPs.", 
    "122": "Receptors have a prominent role in brain function, as they are the effector sites of neurotransmission at the postsynaptic membrane, have a regulatory role on presynaptic sites for transmitter reuptake and feedback, and are modulating various functions on the cell membrane. Distribution, density, and activity of receptors in the brain can be visualized by radioligands labeled for SPECT and PET, and the receptor binding can be quantified by appropriate tracer kinetic models, which can be modified and simplified for particular application. Selective radioligands are available for the various transmitter systems, by which the distribution of these receptors in the normal brain and changes in receptor binding during various physiologic activities or resulting from pathologic conditions can be visualized. The quantitative imaging for several receptors has gained clinical importance-for example, dopamine (D2)) receptors for differential diagnosis of movement disorders and for assessment of receptor occupancy by neuroleptics drugs; serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptors and the 5-HT transporter in affective disorders and for assessment of activity of antidepressants; nicotinic receptors and acetylcholinesterase as markers of cognitive and memory impairment; central benzodiazepine-binding sites at the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor complex as markers of neuronal integrity in neurodegenerative disorders, epilepsy, and stroke and as the site of action of benzodiazepines; peripheral benzodiazepine receptors as indicators of inflammatory changes; opioid receptors detecting increased cortical excitability in focal epilepsy but also affected in perception of and emotional response to pain; and several receptor systems affected in drug abuse and craving. Further studies of the various transmitter/receptor systems and their balance and infraction will improve our understanding of complex brain functions and will provide more insight into the pathophysiology of neurologic and psychiatric disease interaction.",

Uncomplicated seizure control was achieved in 30% with the combination of first and second line therapy. Rapid sequence induction (RSI) of anaesthesia was required in 70% for the control of ongoing seizure activity (21 cases) or to support severe respiratory depression (five cases). This requirement for RSI was increased to 85% in those with seizure duration in excess of 30 min and 89% of those who received prehospital treatment. Of those who required RSI, 35% were treated for periods in excess of 60 min before this intervention was performed.",

Presently, SSR149415 and SSR125543 were evaluated in a differential reinforcement of low-rate 72 s (DRL-72 s) schedule, a procedure known to respond differentially to antidepressants and anxiolytics. Male Wistar rats were trained to lever-press for food reinforcement, but only lever-presses occurring after a 72 s delay were reinforced; otherwise, presses were not rewarded, and the timer was reset to 0 s. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, and the benzodiazepine anxiolytic, diazepam, were tested in parallel. SSR149415 (10-30 mg/kg, i.p.) and SSR125543 (30 mg/kg, i.p.) increased the percentage of responses emitted in the inter-response time (IRT) bin (49-96 s), which resulted in a greater number of reinforced presses. Both compounds shifted the frequency distribution of responses toward longer IRT durations, with a preservation of the bell shape of the IRT distribution curve. Fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) had an effect on DRL-72 s similar to that of SSR149415 and SSR125543. By contrast, diazepam increased the number of responses in IRT bin (0-12 s), and the IRT distribution curve was shifted toward shorter IRT durations and flattened. In summary, these results show that SSR149415 and SSR125543 displayed antidepressant-like activity in a DRL-72 s schedule in rat, confirming their therapeutic potential for the treatment of pathological states induced by chronic frustration such as depression.", 
    "138": "Myc proteins regulate cell growth and are oncogenic in many cancers. Although these proteins are validated molecular anticancer targets, new therapies aimed at modulating myc have yet to emerge. A benzodiazepine (Bz-423) that was discovered in efforts to find new drugs for lupus was found recently to have antiproliferative effects on Burkitt's lymphoma cells. We now show that the basis for the antiproliferative effects of Bz-423 is the rapid and specific depletion of c-myc protein, which is coupled to growth-suppressing effects on key regulators of proliferation and cell cycle progression. c-Myc is depleted as a result of signals coupled to Bz-423 binding its molecular target, the oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein subunit of the mitochondrial F(1)F(o)-ATPase. Bz-423 inhibits F(1)F(o)-ATPase activity, blocking respiratory chain function and generating superoxide, which at growth-inhibiting concentrations triggers proteasomal degradation of c-myc. Bz-423-induced c-myc degradation is independent of glycogen synthase kinase but is substantially blocked by mutation of the phosphosensitive residue threonine 58, which when phosphorylated targets c-myc for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Collectively, this work describes a new lead compound, with drug-like properties, which regulates c-myc by a novel molecular mechanism that may be therapeutically useful.", 
    "139": "An understanding of the molecular basis of drug action provides opportunities for refinement of drug properties and for development of more potent and selective molecules that act at the same biological target. In this work, we have identified the active enantiomers in racemic mixtures of structurally related benzophenone derivatives of 1,5-benzodiazepines, representing both antagonist and agonist ligands of the type A cholecystokinin receptor. The parent compounds of the 1,5-benzodiazepine CCK receptor photoaffinity ligands were originally prepared in an effort to develop orally active drugs. The enantiomeric compounds reported in this study selectively photoaffinity-labeled the CCK receptor, resulting in the identification of a site of attachment for the photolabile moiety of the antagonist probe deep within the receptor's membrane-spanning region at Leu(88), a residue within transmembrane segment two. In contrast, the agonist probe labeled a region including extracellular loop one and a portion of transmembrane segment three. The antagonist covalent attachment site to the receptor served as a guide in the construction of theoretical three-dimensional molecular models for the antagonist-receptor complex. These models provided a means for visualization of physically plausible ligand-receptor interactions in the context of all currently available biological data that address small molecule interactions with the CCK receptor. Our approach, featuring the use of novel photolabile compounds targeting the membrane-spanning receptor domain to probe the binding site region, introduces powerful tools and a strategy for direct and selective investigation of nonpeptidyl ligand binding to peptide receptors.",

The median number of situational attacks and the median agoraphobia ratings rose progressively across diagnostic subtypes. Anticipatory anxiety, HAM-A, HAM-D, and disability scores were higher in PDA than in PD. Full and limited symptom panic attacks were positively correlated. The proportion of total attacks that were limited rose during the first two weeks of treatment, suggesting conversion of full to limited symptom attacks before complete disappearance. Spontaneous and situational attacks were correlated minimally or not at all. Agoraphobia ratings were more positively correlated with situational than with spontaneous panic attacks. Few of the correlations among measures at baseline were high.",

Spontaneous and situational attacks are relatively independent, and situational attacks are more closely related to agoraphobia. These findings are consistent with previous work suggesting that spontaneous attacks reflect a biological component, whereas situational attacks reflect a cognitive component in the psychopathology-- and possibly the pathogenesis-- of panic disorder. This provides a rationale for the use of combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy in the treatment of panic disorder. Future investigations of panic disorder should carefully separate panic attack subtypes.",

In the central nervous system (CNS), the Rho signaling pathway regulates the neuronal response to growth inhibitory proteins and regeneration of damaged axons, and Rho activation is also correlated with an increased susceptibility to apoptosis. To evaluate whether traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in changes in Rho activation in vulnerable regions of the brain, GTP-RhoA pull down assays were performed on rat cortical and hippocampal tissue homogenates obtained from 24 h to 3 days following lateral fluid percussion brain injury (FPI). Following FPI, a significantly increased RhoA activation was observed from 24 h to 3 days post-injury in the cortex and by 3 days in the hippocampus ipsilateral to the injury. We also detected activated RhoA in the cortex and hippocampus contralateral to the injury, without concomitant changes in total RhoA levels. To determine if immediate post-traumatic events such as seizures may activate Rho, we examined RhoA activation in the brains of rats with kainic acid-induced seizures. Severe seizures resulted in bilateral RhoA activation in the cortex and hippocampus. Together, these results indicate that RhoA is activated in vulnerable brain regions following traumatic and epileptic insults to the CNS.",

The efficacy of the reversal agents flumazenil, yohimbine, and atipamezole was also evaluated.", 
    "166": "In parakeets, intranasal administration of midazolam (7.3 mg/kg [3.32 mg/lb]) or detomidine (12 mg/kg [5.45 mg/lb]) caused adequate sedation within 2.7 and 3.5 minutes, respectively. Combinations of midazolam (3.65 mg/kg [1.66 mg/lb]) and xylazine (10 mg/kg [4.55 mg/lb]) with ketamine (40 to 50 mg/kg [18.2 to 22.7 mg/lb]) also achieved adequate sedation. Compared with detomidine, duration of dorsal recumbency was significantly longer with midazolam. Intranasal administration of flumazenil (0.13 mg/kg [0.06 mg/lb]) significantly decreased midazolam-associated recumbency time. Compared with the xylazineketamine combination, duration of dorsal recumbency was longer after midazolam-ketamine administration. Intranasal administration of flumazenil, yohimbine, or atipamezole significantly decreased the duration of sedation induced by midazolam, xylazine, or detomidine, respectively.",

    "168": "Eszopiclone, a single-isomer, non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agent, is approved for use in the US for the treatment of insomnia for patients who have difficulty falling asleep (sleep latency) as well as for those who have difficulty staying asleep (sleep maintenance). Efficacy in sleep maintenance has not been consistently demonstrated with previous hypnotics, and long-term efficacy and safety data are lacking for these agents. In clinical trials, eszopiclone 3 mg significantly improved objective and subjective sleep measures in transient and chronic insomnia in adults. Nightly treatment with eszopiclone 1 mg effectively induced sleep in elderly patients and the 2-mg dose effectively induced and maintained sleep. The ability of eszopiclone 2 mg to significantly improve next-day functioning and daytime alertness (as demonstrated by a reduction in the number and duration of naps) in the elderly is an important finding in clinical trials, and is unique to the class of hypnotic agents for the treatment of insomnia. Eszopiclone was well tolerated in clinical trials < or = 12 months duration, with no clinically significant evidence of pharmacological tolerance, rebound insomnia or dependence. The most frequently reported adverse event was unpleasant taste. Eszopiclone is the only non-benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic (in the Schedule IV class under the Controlled Substances Act) to be evaluated as a long-term treatment for chronic insomnia.", 
    "169": "Local anesthesia, the well-known method of sedation, usually is insufficient for dental implantation and the augmentation of the alveolar ridge, because the operations last for 1 to 2 hours and patients may experience fear and strain. This article examines a new complex sedation method using ketorolac, midazolam, and a local anesthetic 4% solution of articaine hydrochloride and epinephrine (Septanest) in combination with a vasoconstrictor. This method was applied to 67 patients operated on for dental implantation with screw implants or for the alveolar ridge augmentation with biocompatible materials. The control group, which consisted of 20 patients, received local anesthesia with articaine-epinephrine only. Most of the control patients were found to have experienced fear and strain during the aforementioned surgical procedures; their blood pressure and pulse rate increased, and more than half of them experienced pain. No disorders of hemodynamics or the psychoemotional status of the patients were observed during sedation with ketorolac, midazolam, and articaine-epinephrine. Furthermore, anterograde amnesia was determined for the 80% of the patients in the test group.",

Midazolam was administered to 22 patients by intravenous bolus injection (0.15 +/- 0.08 mg/kg) and/or continuous intravenous infusion (0.33 mg +/- 0.11 mg/kg/hr), both of which were judged as effective in 71% and 76% of the patients, respectively. Seven patients showed decrease of blood pressure possibly related with administration of midazolam, but five of them were managed by decreasing dose of the drug or observation of clinical pictures. We consider that midazolam is effective and relatively safe for the management of neonatal seizures.", 
    "171": "Imaging of interictal 18F-FDG PET and ictal SPECT is useful for identifying regions of seizure in epilepsy. Epileptic foci usually show decreased and increased flow/metabolism in the interictal and ictal phase respectively. A fusion technique of high resolution PET and MRI has become indispensable to preoperative evaluation for epileptic surgery. Subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to MRI (SISCOM) is also an useful technique for localizing significant flow increase in the focus. Central type benzodiazepine receptor imaging using 11C-flumazenil PET or 123I-iomazenil SPECT is an alternative and sensitive technique for localizing epileptogenic regions. This receptor imaging delineates epileptic foci more precisely than 18F-FDG PET. There has been considerable interest in the role that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may play in the assessment of patients with epilepsy. The application of fMRI paradigms used in cognitive neuroscience to patients with epilepsy is complicated. Although fMRI is increasingly being used clinically to establish language dominance, further work is required to localize accurately those specific language functions that are most at risk following surgery. Memory paradigms are not yet validated for use in surgical planning, although methodological and technical advances should make this possible in the near future.",

We report a case of arterial anatomical variation in which the treatment was propranolol and clonazepam, showing tinnitus improvement.", 
    "173": "The expedient synthesis of various 1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5-dione compounds, particularly those having substituents at the C3-, N1- and N4-positions is achieved. The important features in these synthetic strategies include: (i) using the coupling reaction of isatoic anhydride with alpha-amino ester for direct construction of the core structure of 1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5-dione; (ii) using potassium carbonate as the base of choice for selective alkylation at the N1-site, while using lithiated 2-ethylacetanilide as the required base to furnish the N4-alkylation; and (iii) using 2-nitrobenzoyl chloride as a synthetic equivalent of anthranilic acid to facilitate the polyethylene resin-bound liquid-phase combinatorial synthesis. The prepared 1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5-dione compounds are evaluated for endothelin receptor antagonism by a functional assay that measures the inhibitory activity against the change of intramolecular calcium ion concentration induced by endothelin-1. The preliminary results indicate that 1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5-diones bearing two flanked aryl substituents at the N1- and N4-sites show better inhibitory activity than the corresponding unalkylated and N-monoalkylated compounds. A promising candidate, 1-benzyl-7-chloro-3-isopropyl-4-(3-methoxybenzyl)-1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5-dione (17b), exhibits an IC50 value in low nM range.", 
    "174": "The purpose of the present study was to examine the efficacy of a triple combination of drugs with adequate anticonvulsant effects and a dual combination with inadequate anticonvulsant effects followed by adjunct therapy. The results showed that combined intramuscular injections of HI-6 (42 mg/kg), atropine (14 mg/kg), and avizafone (3 mg/kg) administered 1, 16, and 31 min. after exposure to a soman dose of 4 x LD(50) completely terminated seizures with a moderate mortality rate (25%). When the soman dose was lowered to 3 x LD(50) the anticonvulsant effect was complete, and no rats died within 24 hr. Rats challenged with 5 x LD(50) of soman all died within 10 min. Without avizafone in the combination, seizures induced by 3 or 4 x LD(50) of soman could not be terminated unless an adjunct therapy consisting of procyclidine (6 mg/kg), diazepam (10 mg/kg), and pentobarbital (30 kg/kg) was given, and the mortality rate was comparatively high (78%). Administration of the adjunct therapy alone 6-16 min. after 4 x LD(50) of soman stopped the seizure activity, but all the rats died within 24 hr. Marked neuropathology was found in the piriform cortex and amygdala, whereas the hippocampal CA1 field was effectively protected when both the triple combination and the dual combination plus adjuncts had stopped seizures 35-55 min. after onset. It is concluded that termination of soman-induced seizures at an early stage (<20 min.) is crucial to avoid neuronal pathology.", 
    "175": "Ropivacaine is a relatively new amide-type local anaesthetic, mainly used for surgery and postoperative pain relief. In this study we have investigated the interaction between the CYP3A4 metabolite of ropivacaine, 2',6'-pipecoloxylidide (PPX), and premedication with, i.e., psychotropic and antianxiety agents (diazepam, midazolam), hypnotics (thiamylal), local anaesthetics (lidocaine), depolarizing muscular relaxants (vecuronium), antihypertensive (clonidine) and H(2)-receptor antagonist (cimetidine) using human liver microsomes in vitro. The effects of the interaction between PPX and premedications were examined using a human liver microsomal preparation in vitro. The concentrations of ropivacaine and PPX were determined by HPLC with UV detection. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and the maximal velocity of total metabolic formation (V(max)) of PPX, the main metabolite of ropivacaine in human liver microsomes, were 17.7 (microM, mean) and 711 (nmol/min./mg protein, mean), respectively. Five premedications (diazepam, lidocaine, cimetidine, vecuronium and clonidine) did not inhibit ropivacaine metabolism in human liver microsomes at concentrations within the therapeutic range. However, midazolam and thiamylal weakly inhibited ropivacaine metabolism in competitive manner (IC(50) 7.8 microM and 250 microM, respectively). The results show lack of interaction between ropivacaine and seven premedication medicines within the therapeutic range of ropivacaine using human liver microsomes in vitro.", 
    "176": "Benzodiazepines are well established as inhibitory modulators of memory processing. This effect is especially prominent when applied before the acquisition phase of a memory task. This minireview concentrates on the putative subtype selectivity of the acquisition-impairing action of benzodiazepines. Namely, recent genetic studies and standard behavioral tests employing subtype-selective ligands pointed to the predominant involvement of two subtypes of benzodiazepine binding sites in memory modulation. Explicit memory learning seems to be affected through the GABAA receptors containing the alpha1 and alpha5 subunits, whereas the effects on procedural memory can be mainly mediated by the alpha1 subunit. The pervading involvement of the alpha1 subunit in memory modulation is not at all unexpected because this subunit is the major subtype, present in 60% of all GABAA receptors. On the other hand, the role of alpha5 subunits, mainly expressed in the hippocampus, in modulating distinct forms of memory gives promise of selective pharmacological coping with certain memory deficit states.", 
    "177": "The interaction between p53 and murine double minute 2 (MDM2) provides an attractive drug target in oncology. Small molecule inhibitors of this interaction have not only provided strong evidence for blocking the protein-protein interaction, but are also extremely useful as biological probes and ultimately as novel therapeutics. Here, a comprehensive review of the patented small molecule inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 interaction are provided. These inhibitors are divided into eight classes of compounds that include cis-imidazolines, benzodiazepines, fused indoles, substituted piperazines, substituted piperidines, aryl boronic acids, spiro-indoles, and alpha-helix mimetic compounds. The best documented class of compounds, cis-imidazolines (e.g., Nutlins) are selective and potent inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 interaction, and selected examples exhibit potency in the nanomolar range. Nutlins induce apoptosis in p53 wild-type cells and show in vivo efficacy in mice xenograft models. Additional strategies briefly discussed in this review, and which are under current exploration in targeting the p53 pathway, include the inhibition of MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitylation and restoration of DNA-binding activity of mutant p53 protein using small molecules.", 
    "178": "The association among local and regional anesthesia is a very useful and common practice. However, some patients may become anxious and require sedation. Benzodiazepines, opioids and propofol are widely used for this aim. Alpha2-adrenergic agonists have hypnotic and sedative properties and represent an alternative to promote hemodynamic stability and minor respiratory depression. This study aimed at evaluating the safety and the interference of intravenous dexmedetomidine or midazolam on sensory and motor block duration spinal anesthesia.",

    "182": "The present study attempted to pharmacologically characterize the muscarinic receptor subtypes mediating contraction of human umbilical vein (HUV).HUV rings were mounted in organ baths and concentration-response curves were constructed for acetylcholine (ACh) (pEC50: 6.16+/-0.04; maximum response 80.00+/-1.98% of the responses induced by serotonin 10 microM). The absence of endothelium did not modify the contractile responses of ACh in this tissue. The role of cholinesterases was evaluated: neither neostigmine (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) nor iso-OMPA (butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor) modified ACh responses. When both enzymes were simultaneously inhibited, a significantly but little potentiation was observed (control: pEC50 6.33+/-0.03; double inhibition: pEC50 6.57+/-0.05). Atropine, nonselective muscarinic receptors antagonist, inhibited ACh-induced contraction (pKB 9.67). The muscarinic receptors antagonists pirenzepine (M1), methoctramine (M2) and pFHHSiD (M3) also antagonized responses to ACh. The affinity values estimated for these antagonists against responses evoked by ACh were 7.58, 6.78 and 7.94, respectively. On the other hand, PD 102807 (M4 selective muscarinic receptors antagonist) was ineffective against ACh-induced contraction.In presence of a blocking concentration of pirenzepine, pFHHSiFD produced an additional antagonism activity on ACh-induced responses. The M1 muscarinic receptors agonist McN-A-343 produced similar maximum but less potent responses than ACh in HUV. The calculated pA2 for pirenzepine against McN-A-343 induced responses was 8.54. In conclusion, the data obtained in this study demonstrate the role of M1 muscarinic receptor subtypes and suggest the involvement of M3 muscarinic receptor subtypes in ACh-induced vasoconstriction in HUV rings. In addition, the vasomotor activity evoked by ACh does not seem to be modulated by endothelial factors, and their enzymatic degradation appears to have little functional relevance in this tissue.", 
    "183": "We report a case of recurrent psychosis, spanning decades, with full inter-episode recovery and minimal functional impairment. While it is difficult to classify this disorder using DSM IV-TR criteria, Leonhard and others have described a 'cycloid psychosis' that correlates well with the phenomenology and course of this case. We believe this may represent a subset within the ICD-10 category of 'acute and transient psychotic disorders'. While this disorder, of unknown incidence, is not well reported in the U.S., it is worthy of further investigation and clinical attention given its generally favorable prognosis and potentially distinct pathophysiology and treatment.", 
    "184": "The results of mostly short-term treatment studies in human patients and animals suggest that second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) such as risperidone (RISP) and olanzapine (OLZ) compared to first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) such as haloperidol (HAL) and chlorpromazine (CPZ) have neuroprotective effects. The animal studies indicate that these effects are probably mediated through increased expression of neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). However, since antipsychotics are commonly used for very long-term treatment periods, particularly in schizophrenic patients, it is important to measure the effects of chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs on the aforementioned growth factors. This study determined the effects of 90- and 180-day treatments with two FGAs, HAL and CPZ, and two SGAs, RISP and OLZ, on the levels of NGF and BDNF protein in hippocampus and striatum of rat. Furthermore, since a preliminary study showed that 90-day treatment of HAL caused significant reductions in the expression of both NGF and BDNF the HAL-treated animals were then switched to SGAs for the next 90 days to assess the potential for restoration of trophic factor levels. After the 90-day treatment, NGF levels in the hippocampus were reduced by 60-70% with HAL or CPZ, and by only 25-30% with RISP or OLZ compared to levels with vehicle only. After the 180-day treatment, NGF levels were further reduced with HAL, RISP, and OLZ, but not with CPZ. The magnitude of the NGF decreases in the striatum was larger (70-90%) with all the antipsychotics compared to the hippocampus. However, the pattern of BDNF changes in the hippocampus differed significantly from the striatum after 90- or 180-day treatment with the antipsychotics. In hippocampus, compared to controls, BDNF levels remained unchanged with OLZ both after 90 and 180 days of treatment. Whereas, larger decreases in BDNF levels were observed with HAL or CPZ and intermediate decreases were observed with RISP after 90 days of treatment that continued to decline up to 180 days. Furthermore, switching HAL animals after 90 days of treatment to either RISP or OLZ for the next 90 days significantly restored levels of both NGF and BDNF in both the brain regions. These data indicate that SGAs compared to FGAs induce less deleterious effects on neurotrophic factor levels in the brain and may also offer ability to reverse the more pronounced negative effects of FGAs as well. These data may have significant clinical implications for long-term antipsychotic selection as well as the common practice of antipsychotic switchover.", 
    "185": "Magnolia dealbata Zucc. is considered to have tranquilizer and anticonvulsant properties in Mexican traditional medicine. In the present study we report the effects of a crude extract of Magnolia dealbata (30, 100 and 300 mg/kg) on mouse central nervous system (CNS). Pharmacological effects were tested on ambulatory activity, anti-anxiety response, sodium pentobarbital-induced hypnosis and pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures in comparison to honokiol, buspirone, ethosuximide and diazepam as corresponding reference drugs. No changes in spontaneous locomotor activity were produced posterior to Magnolia dealbata administration; however, a significant and dose-dependent diminution in the anxiety response was observed in experimental models such as plus-maze, head-dipping and exploratory rearing tests. Magnolia dealbata not only prolonged the time of sodium pentobarbital-induced hypnosis and delayed the onset of PTZ-induced mioclonus and clonus, but also hindered the presence of tonic seizures and avoided mortality. The hypnotic, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects obtained in these experiments support the hypothesis that Magnolia dealbata possesses CNS activity and reinforces the popular use in Mexican traditional medicine.", 
    "186": "The mainstay of dyspnea palliation remains altering its central perception. Morphine is the main drug and anxiolytics have a less established role. This trial assessed the role of midazolam as adjunct therapy to morphine in the alleviation of severe dyspnea perception in terminally ill cancer patients. One hundred and one patients with severe dyspnea were randomized to receive around-the-clock morphine (2.5 mg every 4 hours for opioid-na\u00efve patients or a 25% increment over the daily dose for those receiving baseline opioids) with midazolam rescue doses (5 mg) in case of breakthrough dyspnea (BD) (Group Mo); around-the-clock midazolam (5 mg every 4 hours) with morphine rescues (2.5 mg) in case of BD (Group Mi); or around-the-clock morphine (2.5 mg every 4 hours for opioid-na\u00efve patients or a 25% increment over the daily dose for those receiving baseline opioids) plus midazolam (5 mg every 4 hours) with morphine rescue doses (2.5 mg) in case of BD (Group MM). All drugs were given subcutaneously in a single-blinded way. Thirty-five patients were entered in Group Mo, 33 entered in Mi, and 33 entered in MM. At 24 hours, patients who experienced dyspnea relief were 69%, 46%, and 92% in the Mo, Mi, and MM groups, respectively (P = 0.0004 and P = 0.03 for MM vs. Mi and MM vs. Mo, respectively). At 48 hours, those with no dyspnea relief (no controlled dyspnea) were 12.5%, 26%, and 4% for the Mo, Mi, and MM groups, respectively (P = 0.04 for MM vs. Mi). During the first day, patients with BD for the groups Mo, Mi, and MM were 34.3%, 36.4%, and 21.2%, respectively (P = NS or not significant), whereas during the second day, these percentages were 38%, 38.5%, and 24%, respectively (P = NS). The data demonstrate that the beneficial effects of morphine in controlling baseline levels of dyspnea could be improved with the addition of midazolam to the treatment.", 
    "187": "The objective is to investigate whether sedation techniques for oral surgery can be improved by combining the use of inhalation of nitrous oxide/oxygen with intravenous Midazolam. Prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial: Patients requiring extractions or surgery were randomly allocated to subgroups receiving either intravenous Midazolam or nitrous oxide/oxygen or a combined technique using nitrous oxide/oxygen and intravenous Midazolam. Safety parameters, amount of sedative agents administered, recovery time and co-operation scores were recorded. Patients receiving the combined sedation technique were initially titrated with 10% nitrous oxide, increasing by increments of 10% up to a maximum of 40% nitrous oxide and 60% oxygen. Midazolam was then titrated (initially 2 mg wait 2 min with increments of 1mg every minute until appropriately sedated) whilst still administering 40% nitrous oxide. When a combined technique of N(2)O/O(2) and Midazolam was used there was a statistically significant reduction in the amount of Midazolam required to achieve effective sedation (P<0.001), an overall significant reduction in recovery time (P<0.001) and a significant improvement in co-operation (P<0.01) and arterial oxygen saturation (P<0.001). This combined technique was found to be safe and reliable, requiring reduced doses of Midazolam and demonstrable improvement in patient recovery and co-operation.", 
    "188": "According to recent epidemiological reports, almost 40% of American population use complimentary and alternative medicine (CAM) during their lifetime. Patients detected with HIV or cancer often consume herbal products especially St. John's wort (SJW) for antidepressants in combination with prescription medicines. Such self-administered herbal products along with prescribed medicines raise concerns of therapeutic activity due to possible drug-herbal interactions. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) together constitute a highly efficient barrier for many orally absorbed drugs. Available literature, clinical reports and in vitro studies from our laboratory indicate that many drugs and herbal active constituents are substrates for both P-gp and CYP3A4. Results from clinical studies and case reports indicate that self-administered SJW reduce steady state plasma concentrations of amitriptyline, cyclosporine, digoxin, fexofenadine, amprenavir, indonavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, benzodiazepines, theophyline, irinotecan, midazolan and warfarin. This herbal agent has been also reported to cause bleeding and unwanted pregnancies when concomitantly administered with oral contraceptives. Most of these medicinal agents and SJW are substrates for P-gp and/or CYP3A4. In vitro studies from our laboratory suggest that short-term exposure with pure herbal agents such as hypericin, kaempferol and quercetin or extract of SJW resulted in higher uptake or influx of ritonavir and erythromycin. Hypericin, kaempferol and quercetin also caused a remarkable inhibition of cortisol metabolism with the percent intact cortisol values of 64.58%, 89.6% and 90.1%, respectively, during short-term in vitro experiments. Conversely, long-term exposure of herbal agents (hyperforin, kaempferol and quercetin) showed enhanced expression of CYP3A4 mRNA in Caco-2 cells. In another study, we observed that long-term exposure of hypericin, kaempferol, quercetin and silibinin resulted in higher MDR-1 mRNA expression in Caco-2 cells. Therefore, herbs can pharmacokinetically act as inhibitors or inducers. Medicinal agents that are substrates P-gp-mediated efflux and/or CYP-mediated metabolism are likely to be potential candidates for drug-herbal interactions. The duration of exposure of cells/healthy volunteers/animals to herbals appears to be critical for drug-herbal interaction. An increase in plasma drug concentration is possible during concomitant administration of SJW and prescribed drugs. In contrast, prolonged intake of herbal supplement followed by drug administration may result in subtherapeutic concentrations. Therefore, clinical implications of such drug herbal interactions depend on a variety of factors such as dose, frequency and timing of herbal intake, dosing regimen, route of drug administration and therapeutic range. In vitro screening techniques will play a major role in identifying possible herb-drug interactions and thus create a platform for clinical studies to emerge. Mechanisms of drug-herbal interaction have been discussed in this review article.",

    "190": "Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine commonly used for conscious sedation for a variety of procedures. Severe adverse reactions, including respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and anaphylactoid reaction, have been described by manufacturers. We report a patient who developed facial edema after iv injection of midazolam during caesarian section. A 26-year-old woman with a history of atopy and pollen allergy was scheduled for caesarian section. Spinal anesthesia was induced with bupivacaine without significant medical problems. Shortly after receiving 2 mg of iv midazolam 15 minutes after delivery for conscious sedation, she developed pruritus and severe facial edema. Airway obstruction did not occur and no specific medical treatment was necessary. However she was not able to open her eyes for 8 hours because of severe eyelid swelling. We should be more careful in administering midazolam which is generally regarded as safe and well tolerated."
