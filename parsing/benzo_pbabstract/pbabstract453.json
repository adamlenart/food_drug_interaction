    "0": "The ability of a supralethal dose of chlorpyrifos to produce delayed neuropathy was examined using assessments of clinical signs, electromyography (EMG), motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV), lymphocyte neuropathy target esterase activity (LNTE), and histologic changes in nervous system tissues. Cats were exposed to a single, im injection of corn oil (vehicle control), DFP (positive control) at 5.0 mg/kg, or chlorpyrifos at 300 mg/kg and observed for 60 days. Atropine and 2-PAM were administered to chlorpyrifos exposed cats one to two times a day for 14 to 24 days in response to the appearance of cholinergic signs. Anorectic cats during the acute toxicosis were force fed by hand and hydration was maintained by administering fluids sc. Onset of ataxia (mean +/- SD) for the positive control and chlorpyrifos exposed cats were 16.2 +/- 1.8 days (range of 14-19 days) and 19.0 +/- 1.4 days (range of 17-21 days), respectively. Functional deficits for both groups were confined to the hindlimbs and characterized by a crouched-waddling gait, hypermetria, and proprioceptive deficits. Maximal inhibition of LNTE activity was 96% at 24 hr postdosing in the positive control group and 46% at 7 days postdosing in the chlorpyrifos group. No EMG or MNCV abnormalities were detected in any of the treatment groups. Axonal degeneration was similar for the positive control and chlorpyrifos exposed cats. Ascending tracts of the cervical spinal cord and descending tracts of the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord were most severely affected and peripheral nerves were only mildly affected. The clinical and histologic effects produced indicate that chlorpyrifos can cause delayed neuropathy in the domestic cat. The moderate but prolonged inhibition of LNTE produced by chlorpyrifos is atypical of classic organophosphorus delayed neurotoxicants.", 
    "1": "In order to identify subtypes of muscarinic receptor on the rat pancreas, the effects of new muscarinic receptor antagonists, [11-[[2-(diethylamino)-methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116) and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperadine-methiodide (4-DAMP), on amylase secretion stimulated by carbachol and binding of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) were evaluated using isolated rat pancreatic acini. Atropine, pirenzepine, AF-DX 116 and 4-DAMP inhibited carbachol-stimulated amylase release in a dose-dependent manner. All these antagonists caused a concentration-dependent rightward shift of the dose-response curve for carbachol-stimulated amylase release without altering the maximal response. Schild plots revealed that pA2 values for atropine, pirenzepine, AF-DX 116 and 4-DAMP were 9.15, 6.78, 6.09 and 8.79, respectively. Every slope of Schild plots was not different from unity, suggesting that these antagonists act as competitive inhibitors. These antagonists also inhibited the binding of [3H]QNB in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibition constants were 1.21 x 10(-9) M (atropine), 1.26 x 10(-7) M (pirenzepine), 0.57 x 10(-6) M (AF-DX 116) and 2.75 x 10(-9) M (4-DAMP). Thus, the order of inhibitory potencies was atropine > or = 4-DAMP > pirenzepine > AF-DX 116. These findings suggest that 4-DAMP-sensitive M3 receptor may play an important role in the pancreatic exocrine functions.", 
    "2": "Mice challenged with the anxiolytic benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide exhibited significant increases in the percent of total entries into and percent of total time spent on open arms of an elevated plus maze. Systemic pretreatment with the nitric oxide synthase-inhibitor L-NG-nitro arginine (L-NOARG) antagonized these effects of chlordiazepoxide. This inhibitory effect of L-NOARG was stereospecifically and completely reversed by intracerebroventricular administration of L-arginine but not D-arginine. These findings suggest a possible role of nitric oxide in the anxiolytic effect of chlordiazepoxide in the elevated plus maze.", 
    "3": "The presence of benzodiazepine-like molecules was detected radioimmunologically in bovine rumen contents and in incubates of ruminal contents with homogenates of several common grasses. A similar production was found \"in vivo\" in samples obtained from a grazing cow with a rumen cannula.", 
    "4": "In an analysis of the withdrawal syndrome of 12 patients dependent on benzodiazepines (BZD), important factors such as underlying psychiatric disease, precipitating life events, complaints leading to BZD use, and also positive and negative psychological and social consequences, duration of intake, dose and type of BZD dependence are discussed. Withdrawal was completed under standardized inpatient conditions reducing the BZD dose to 50% of the previous dose once every 5 days and maintaining control through regular measurements of the BZD urine concentrations. The course of the somatic, psychological and perceptual withdrawal phenomena was documented according to Lader's BZD withdrawal symptom checklist (Lader, M. (1983) J. Clin. Psychiatry 44, 121-127). The reduction scheme proved to be safe and efficient; no major withdrawal syndromes developed. Abstinence phenomena largely disappeared within 10 days of discontinuation.", 
    "5": "Concern about physical dependence seems to be the major limiting factor in the long-term treatment with benzodiazepines (BZD). The severity of the withdrawal syndrome is determined by multiple factors, e.g. dose, duration of use, frequency of dose interval, mode of discontinuation, the pharmacologic characteristics of the BZD, personality and previous or concurrent use of cross-dependent drugs and/or alcohol. There is evidence that BZD with a short elimination half-life cause a more severe withdrawal syndrome than those with a long elimination half-life. Besides pharmacokinetic properties, pharmacodynamic factors such as potency may also covary with the liability of a BZD to induce physical dependence. There is an increasing body of literature indicating that quickly eliminated, high potency BZD such as alprazolam and lorazepam may be more likely to cause severe withdrawal reactions than slowly eliminated compounds such as diazepam or less potent derivatives such as oxazepam. Alprazolam seems to play an exceptional role, insofar as relatively soon after its introduction to the market a number of case reports of withdrawal psychoses, seizures and intense rebound anxiety were published. Data reviewed from the literature correspond well with the results of interviews conducted with 31 clinicians across the United States with experience in detoxifying patients dependent on BZD, 84% of these physicians mentioning alprazolam as especially problematic with respect to the intensity and/or duration of the withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "6": "The relaxing effect and the systemic tolerance of a single oral dose of Valverde relaxation drag\u00e9es have been examined double-blinded against 3 mg of bromazepam and placebo in groups of 20 healthy male volunteers each treatment. The systemic tolerance was assessed at the end of the examination, relying on spontaneous remarks or comments made on side effects upon questioning. As the four plants from which Valverde has been extracted (valerian, balm, passion-flower, and pestilence wort) have a reputation of being tranquilizing agents with spasmolytic effect, not only this effect needs to be demonstrated, but also sedative side effects and impairment of vigilance must be assessed to explore the risk for accident proneness. We expected that the relaxing-tranquilizing effect of bromazepam as well as of Valverde relaxation drag\u00e9es compared with placebo is perceived subjectively. A potentially existing impairment of performance due to Valverde was assumed to be milder than impairment due to bromazepam. The study, however, inspite of a sophisticated test battery with extended testing, could not detect any effect for either of the two drugs; nor could it detect a side effect. The sedation and reduction of vigilance observed in a pre-study without placebo controls (Gerhard and Hobi, unpublished) was explained by natural fatigue which appeared in the course of the morning also under placebo. Therefore, sedative side effects, leading to an impairment in performance, can be excluded for both drugs at the studied dose level.", 
    "7": "The author presents an account of selected important findings in endocrinology during the last year. The mediator of action of STH, IGF-I, was tested as a protein anabolic in a child with Laron's nanism. STH is about to be tested as a geriatric drug. A non-peptide vasopressin antagonist was described. Melatonin is being tested in sleep disorders. A combination of methimazol and thyroxine is more suitable for treatment of Graves-Basedow's disease than the goitrogen alone. Dermal vasoconstriction can be an indicator of the effectiveness of glucocorticoids in asthma. Significant advances were made in the sphere of the new hormone, NO: it is not only an effective vasorelaxing agent but also a neuromodulator and participates in the natural lymphocytic cytotoxicity. Marked advances were made as regards knowledge of the endogenous ligand for benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "8": "Novel methods for the isolation of gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor alpha subunit iso-oligomers have been developed. Thus, populations of GABAA receptors containing the GABAA receptor alpha 1 subunit, the alpha 2 subunit, and the alpha 3 subunit have been purified from sodium deoxycholate extracts of bovine cerebral cortex with the retention of specific [3H]flunitrazepam-binding activity by anti-alpha 1 324-341, anti-Cys alpha 2 414-424, or anti-Cys alpha 3 454-467 antibody affinity chromatography, respectively. The relative abundance of the different specificity alpha subunits in these preparations was compared with benzodiazepine affinity chromatography-purified GABAA receptors by immunoblotting. In each case, it was found that although the immunoreactivity with the specific alpha subunit antibody that was used for purification was enriched in immunoaffinity-purified receptors, reactivity with the other alpha subunit specificity antibodies, together with anti-gamma 2 1-14 Cys immunoreactivity was found. Immunoprecipitation of GABAA receptors purified by anti-alpha 1 324-341 antibody affinity chromatography by all three anti-alpha subunit antibodies employed, together with the use of anti-alpha 1 324-341 and anti-Cys alpha 2 414-424 antibody affinity columns in series, further substantiated the partial co-purification of the different polypeptides. These results demonstrate the copurification of the gamma 2 subunit with each population of alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3 subunit-enriched GABAA receptors. They also show the existence of minor populations of GABAA receptors that contain alpha 1 alpha 2, alpha 1 alpha 3, and alpha 2 alpha 3 subunit pairs within single oligomers.", 
    "9": "This experiment examined the effects of pre-training systemic injections of the benzodiazepine (BZ) diazepam (DZP) on learning and retention of an inhibitory avoidance response in rats with bilateral lesions of the amygdaloid complex (AC) induced by intra-amygdala injections of the excitotoxin N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA). Unoperated, sham-operated and AC-lesioned rats received i.p. injections of DZP (1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg) or vehicle 30 min prior to training in a continuous multiple-trial inhibitory avoidance task. Retention was tested 48 h later. The acquisition and retention of the AC-lesioned rats were impaired, relative to that of the unoperated and sham controls. In the unoperated and sham controls, DZP impaired retention but did not affect acquisition. In contrast, in animals with AC lesions, DZP did not affect either acquisition or retention. These findings suggest that the amnestic effects of DZP are mediated, at least in part, through influences involving the AC.", 
    "10": "Studies of the effect of diazepam and related compounds on the rewarding properties of brain stimulation as measured by response rates have not yielded clear results, with self-stimulation performance reported to be potentiated, diminished, or unchanged following drug administration. In this study, the effect of two doses of diazepam (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg) and its vehicle on self-stimulation thresholds was examined in eight rats with electrode placements scattered along a 4 mm length of the medial forebrain bundle. Stimulation of the lateral preoptic area and the anterior and mid-lateral hypothalamus produced overt seizures. Rate-period curves were generated for a wide range of currents and the resulting period-current trade-off functions were compared across doses. In seizure-prone sites upward shifts in period threshold were observed after 2.5 mg/kg of diazepam with little additional increases incurred by the 5.0 mg/kg dose. The majority of non-seizure sites showed no effects of diazepam upon period threshold. The results suggest that diazepam alters brain-stimulation reward thresholds by suppressing competing seizure activity.", 
    "11": "The human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) trans-activator Tat is an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs because inhibition of Tat would arrest the virus at an early stage. The drug Ro 5-3335 [7-chloro-5-(2-pyrryl)-3H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2(H)-one], inhibited gene expression by HIV-1 at the level of transcriptional trans-activation by Tat. The compound did not inhibit the basal activity of the promoter. Both Tat and its target sequence TAR were required for the observed inhibitory activity. Ro 5-3335 reduced the amount of cell-associated viral RNA and antigen in acutely, as well as in chronically infected cells in vitro (median inhibition concentration 0.1 to 1 micromolar). Effective inhibition of viral replication was also observed 24 hours after cells were transfected with infectious recombinant HIV-1 DNA. The compound was active against both HIV-1 and HIV-2 and against 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT)-resistant clinical isolates.", 
    "12": "We investigated the binding affinity of new tetrapeptides derived from the C-terminal sequence of CCK8 to central CCKB and peripheral CCKA receptors. Compound 1 (Boc-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2) showed high affinity for central CCKB receptors (Ki 4.2 x 10(-8) M, pancreas/cortex ratio = 283). Compounds 2 (Suc-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2) and 3 (Suc-Trp-Leu-Asp-Phe-NH2) also exhibited high affinity (Ki 2.7 x 10(-8) M and 5.6 x 10(-8) M, respectively) but their CCKB selectivity was nearly 50 times higher (Ki ratio greater than 14,000). Replacement of Met or Leu by other amino acids resulted in less effective tetrapeptides.", 
    "13": "The respective role of central vs. peripheral CCK-B receptors in the recently reported anxiolytic effects of CCK-B antagonists remains to be firmly established. We therefore investigated the in vivo binding properties of cerebral CCK receptors after i.c.v. injection into mice of [3H]pBC 264 ([3H]propionyl-Tyr(SO3H)-gNle-mGly- Trp-(NMe)Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2), a highly potent, peptidase-resistant and selective CCK-B agonist. The specific binding of [3H]pBC 264 was reversible and saturable. The dose producing 50% receptor occupancy was 25 pmol and the Bmax was 0.9 pmol/brain 15 min after injection. I.c.v. administered CCK8 (ID50 8500 pmol) was 200-fold less potent than pBC 264 (ID50 43 pmol) in inhibiting specific [3H]pBC 264 binding; CCK8NS, CCK5 and CCK4 being slightly less potent than CCK8. Aminopeptidases play a major role in degrading CCK8 since the protected analog pCCK8 or CCK8 in the presence of an aminopeptidase inhibitor exhibited higher affinities than CCK8. I.v. administration of pBC 264 (20 mg/kg) inhibited [3H]pBC 264 specific binding by about 72%, confirming its ability to enter the brain. In contrast, CCK4 was unable to modify [3H]pBC 264 binding. As expected, the CCK-A antagonist (L364,718) did not inhibit [3H]pBC 264 binding, while at the highest dose used (40 mg/kg i.p.) the CCK-B antagonist (L365,260) inhibited binding by 20%. Several hypotheses are discussed to account for the very low i.v. doses of CCK4 and L365,260 needed to produce anxiogenic and anxiolytic responses, respectively.", 
    "14": "A [35S]cRNA probe was used for the visualization of GABAA/benzodiazepine (GABAA/BZ) receptor alpha 1 subunit mRNA in developing reeler mutant mouse cerebellum. A clear hybridization signal was observed throughout the malformed reeler cerebellum from birth. Labeling was associated with Purkinje cell bodies located in three subcortical masses. Additional labeled Purkinje cells were observed within the granule cell layer and at their normal position at the interface between the molecular and granule cell layers. All reeler Purkinje cells had comparable levels of grain density, regardless of their location within the cerebellar cortex. These results indicate that Purkinje cell malpositioning, and the resulting absence of a major complement of afferents throughout development, does not impair the expression of mRNA coding for the alpha 1 subunit of the GABAA/BZ receptor.", 
    "15": "Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against the GABAA-receptor beta 3 subunit peptide sequence, KQSMPREGHGRHMDR-NH2 coupled to keyhole limpet haemocyanin. These anti-beta 3 379-393 antibodies immunoprecipitated in a dose-dependent manner specific benzodiazepine agonist binding sites from Na+ deoxycholate extracts of bovine cerebral cortex. In immunoblots, anti-beta 3 379-393 antibodies recognised two species with Mr 59,900 and Mr 57,200 in all preparations tested, which included crude detergent-solubilised, benzodiazepine affinity chromatography-purified receptor, anti-alpha 1 324-341 antibody, anti-Cys alpha 2 414-424 antibody and anti-Cys alpha 3 454-467 antibody immunoaffinity-purified GABAA-receptor subpopulations. These results provide evidence for the ubiquity and promiscuity of the GABAA-receptor beta 3 subunit.", 
    "16": "In vitro autoradiography on tissue sections and receptor assay in cortical membrane homogenates revealed that pirenzepine high-affinity muscarinic sites (M1) decrease in affinity in the prefrontal cortex and in other cortical areas of aged rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). Carbachol competition experiments detected only a single, low-affinity class of sites in old monkeys, while two classes of sites (low and high affinity) were observed in young adults. The change in affinity in the aged monkeys is not accompanied by a decrease in the density of these sites and, further, the age-related decline in the affinity of the M1 site is reversible. In the presence of Mg2+, the M1 muscarinic receptors in the aged monkeys were capable of forming carbachol high-affinity sites. These results provide evidence for age-dependent functional changes in receptor activity in cerebral cortex and indicate that these receptors maintain a degree of plasticity that could be a strategic target for research aimed at treatment of memory disorders in aged humans.", 
    "17": "Alcohol-induced delirium tremens (DT) is a well-known disease with an unpredictable, either favorable or fatal, spontaneous course. The cardinal symptoms are disorientation, hallucinations and autonomic lability. The pathogenesis of DT is still unknown, and the numerous hypothesis have spawned as many therapeutic approaches. Drugs with a cross-tolerance to alcohol have so far proved best. Benzodiazepines and clomethiazole have been considered the drugs of first choice for the past 20 years and more. Improvements in intensive care has helped lower the mortality rate to 3 to 8%. Major tranquilizers with a strong antipsychotic effect and anti-epileptic agents can effectively expand the sedative management of DT. Cerebral convulsions at the beginning of DT appear to dispose the patient to a prolonged course, and preexisting or concomitant disease affecting other organs (complicated DT) clearly prolongs the duration of delirium. The risks and contraindications of clomethiazole are emphasized. The course and outcome of DT is unpredictable--in our patients we found a mortality rate of 3.7% and 12.3% end up in a defective state.", 
    "18": "The muscarinic (M) receptors involved in the vasodilation elicited by acetylcholine (ACh) and in the carbachol inhibition in electrically induced [3H]noradrenaline (NA) release in cat cerebral arteries was investigated. For this, atropine, pirenzepine, AF-DX 116, 4-DAMP, non-specific, M1, M2 and M3 receptor antagonists, respectively, were used. ACh elicited concentration-dependent relaxations up to 10(-6) M which were attenuated by these antagonists; the order of potency (pA2 values) to inhibit the ACh-induced relaxation was: atropine (10.1) 4-DAMP (8.9) greater than pirenzepine (7.6) greater than AF-DX 116 (5.9). The electrical stimulation (200 mA, 0.3 ms, 2 Hz, during 1 min) of these arteries preincubated with [3H]NA caused tritium release which was inhibited by carbachol (10(-6) M). The 4 antagonists attenuated the action of the M agonist; the order of potency (pIC50 values) was: atropine (8.7) greater than 4-DAMP (8.1) greater than AF-DX 116 (7.9) greater than pirenzepine (5.8). The action of McN-A-343, a putative M1 agonist, was also investigated. This agent produced small vasodilator responses and elevated concentrations (5 x 10(-5) M) inhibited the stimulated NA release, which was partially antagonized by atropine (10(-7) M) and pirenzepine (10(-8) and 10(-7) M). These results suggest the existence of M3 and M2 receptors mediating the relaxation induced by ACh and the NA release inhibition evoked by carbachol, respectively.", 
    "19": "Recently we cloned the cDNA coding for the putative human peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (hPBR). This report describes the expression of this cDNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the characterization of the recombinant protein. The expression was achieved by placing the receptor cDNA under the control of a galactose-regulated artificial promoter. After galactose induction, the transformed cells expressed a functional hPBR which displayed a Kd for the specific peripheral-type ligand [3H]PK11195 of 9.9 +/- 1.3 nM and a maximal binding capacity of 249,300 +/- 50,400 sites/cell. The pharmacological characterization of the recombinant receptor, determined in competitive ligand binding experiments, agrees closely with that described for the natural receptor expressed by human cells. Furthermore, the binding was stereospecific as shown by the displacement of the [3H]PK11195 binding by PK14067 (-Q1) and not by PK14068 (+Q1). Photolabeling experiments showed that transformed cells expressed a 18 kDa protein which was specifically labeled with [3H]PK14105. Altogether these results show that the cDNA transfected in yeast encodes a 18 kDa protein with the expected characteristics of the hPBR.", 
    "20": "The intriguing structural similarities of glutamic acid based cholecystokinin (CCK) antagonists (A-64718 and A-65186) and the benzodiazepine CCK antagonist MK-329 (L-364,718) have been reported. Efforts to include the weak CCK antagonist benzotript into this construct utilizing a similar approach have resulted in a novel series of benzotript-based hybrid antagonists N alpha-(3'-quinolylcarbonyl)-(R)-tryptophan di-n-pentylamide (9, A-67396), N alpha-(4',8'-dihydroxy-2'-quinolylcarbonyl)-(R)-tryptophan di-n-pentylamide (23, A-70276), and N alpha-(3'-quinolylcarbonyl)-(R)-5'-hydroxytryptophan di-n-pentylamide (36, A-71134) which possess respectively binding affinities of 23, 21, and 11 nM for the pancreatic CCK-A receptor and which inhibit CCK8-induced amylase secretion. Compound 9 possesses a selectivity of greater than 500-fold for the pancreatic CCK-A receptor over the CCK-B receptor.", 
    "21": "To investigate the effects of experimentally-induced diabetes on prostatic muscarinic cholinergic receptors, the binding characteristics of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) to prostatic membrane particulates were examined in four groups of rats: control, diabetic, diabetic insulin treated, and diabetic myo-inositol treated. Diabetes was induced by i.v. injection of streptozotocin (STZ), 65 mg/kg. Diabetic and diabetic myo-inositol-treated rats had hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, glucosuria, polydipsia, and polyuria as well as significantly smaller prostates and lower body weights compared to control and diabetic insulin-treated animals. The densities of muscarinic receptors (Bmax) as determined by saturation studies with [3H]QNB in the prostatic plasma membranes of control, diabetic, diabetic insulin-treated and diabetic myo-inositol-treated rats were 80 +/- 8, 51 +/- 5, 78 +/- 3, and 47 +/- 7 fmol/mg of protein, respectively. [3H]QNB binding to muscarinic receptors was inhibited by muscarinic antagonists with the following rank order of Ki values: atropine much less than pirenzepine less than AF-DX 116. The pharmacological profile of the muscarinic receptors was similar in all groups examined and was consistent with the predominance of the M3 muscarinic receptor subtype in prostatic membrane particulates. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes caused a variety of abnormalities including a down-regulation in the density of M3 muscarinic receptors in the rat prostate and that insulin, but not myo-inositol could prevent the development of these abnormalities.", 
    "22": "Clinical studies suggest that carbamazepine may attenuate effects of alprazolam discontinuation. Since discontinuation of chronic alprazolam in a mouse model is associated with behavioral alterations and upregulation at the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor, we studied the effects of carbamazepine administration after alprazolam (2 mg/kg/day) discontinuation. Open-field activity was increased in mice 4 days after alprazolam discontinuation, but this effect was reduced significantly by continuous infusion of carbamazepine, 25 or 100 mg/kg/day. Benzodiazepine receptor binding in vivo was increased in cortex at 2 and 4 days after alprazolam discontinuation, and in hypothalamus at 4 days; with carbamazepine, 100 mg/kg/day, binding in both regions at these time points was similar to control values. Similar results were observed in cortex with benzodiazepine receptor binding in vitro. GABA-dependent chloride uptake was also increased at 4 days alprazolam administration. Treatment with carbamazepine attenuated (P less than 0.10) this increase. Carbamazepine alone after vehicle did not alter benzodiazepine binding or GABA-dependent chloride uptake. These results indicate that carbamazepine administration after alprazolam discontinuation attenuates behavioral and neurochemical alterations associated with discontinuation.", 
    "23": "Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has been suggested as a means to reduce the amount of intravenous analgesia/sedation in patients undergoing extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). A retrospective analysis of 79 ESWL procedures on 73 consecutive unselected patients was done in an attempt to determine the effectiveness of TENS in reducing the amount of intravenous fentanyl citrate and/or midazolam HCl needed to control pain and anxiety during the ESWL procedure. The study was divided into two parts: (1) all patients receiving TENS (n = 44) versus a non-TENS group (n = 35), and (2) comparison of the early (n = 22) and late non-TENS (n = 22) groups against each other; separately the late non-TENS group was compared to the entire TENS group. In the study, TENS reduce the amount of fentanyl citrate needed to control anxiety by 22.9% (P less than 0.025). No difference was noted when the early and late non-TENS group of patients were compared to each other. A gender difference was noted with a significant reduction in the dose of fentanyl citrate only in female patients receiving TENS (45.4%). Likewise, there was a significant reduction in the dose of midazolam HCl only in males who had TENS (38.9%). The data suggests that TENS may be a useful addition to reduce the amount of sedation and analgesia during ESWL.", 
    "24": "Single focal injection of the excitatory amino acids (EAAs) kainic acid (KA, 1.1 nmol/microliters) and (S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (S)-AMPA, 6 nmol/microliters) into rat dorsal hippocampus resulted in widespread neurodegeneration with 90-100% loss of hippocampal pyramidal cells in CA1, CA2, CA3 and CA4 subfields, and 50-70% loss of dentate granule (DG) cells. Focal injection of NMDA (30 nmol/microliters) under the same conditions resulted in 70-90% loss of CA1 cells with less damage in CA2, CA3, CA4 and DG cells (30-50%, 10-30%, and 30-50%, respectively). The non-NMDA antagonists NBQX (2,3-dihydro-6-nitro-7-sulphamoyl-benzo(f) quinoxaline) and GYKI 52466 (1-(amino)phenyl-4-methyl-7,8-methylendioxy-5H-2,3,benzodiazepine. HCl) co-injected (24 nmol/microliters) with EAAs or given as i.v. infusion (30 mg/kg/3h), protected against KA toxicity in CA1, CA2 and DG cells, with no protection in CA3 and CA4. NBQX i.v. protected against (S)-AMPA toxicity in the DG cells but no protection was observed against (S)-AMPA toxicity in hippocampal subfields (CA1, CA2 and CA4). Intravenous administration of NBQX and GYKI 52466 (30 mg/kg/3 h) also failed to protect against NMDA toxicity in the hippocampus. Systemic injections of D(-)-CPPene, (E)-4-(3-phos-phonoprop-2-enyl)-piperazine-2-carboxylic acid, (10 and 5 mg/kg, i.p., 20 min prior and 3 h post EAA injection) protected against NMDA and KA toxicity in the CA1, CA2 and DG subfield with no protective effect against (S)-AMPA toxicity.", 
    "25": "The binding parameters of benzodiazepine receptors labeled with [3H]flunitrazepam were investigated in the brain of male adult eels at the trophic phase (4 years old) and of male silver eels (6 year old ocean migrants). The density of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites was significantly decreased (-26%) in the brain of silver eels compared with younger counterparts. In contrast, the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) was not significantly different in the two experimental groups. These results are discussed in terms of the possible involvement of stress, behavioral and environmental factors and age-related degenerative processes.", 
    "26": "Both triazolam (Tz) and exercise can phase advance free-running locomotor activity rhythms in intact hamsters. Furthermore, Tz increases activity at the time of injection, and this appears to be the mechanism whereby Tz produces phase shifts. This study tested the phase-shifting effect of Tz in SCN-lesioned (SCN-X) hamsters that had regained circadian rhythms of locomotor activity after transplantation of fetal SCN into the third ventricle. The results indicate that in both groups, increases in locomotor activity are seen at the time of Tz injection, and most intact animals, but no grafted animals show a phase advance in response to Tz administration. Given that hamsters bearing SCN grafts have limited neural connections between the host brain and transplanted SCN tissue, the results suggest that a site outside the SCN, with afferents to these nuclei, mediates the phase-shifting effect of Tz and of exercise.", 
    "27": "Autoradiography was used to visualise N-methyl-D-aspartate, phencyclidine, strychnine-insensitive glycine, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid, kainic acid, benzodiazepine, gamma-aminobutyric acid type A, sigma, serotonergic, dopaminergic, alpha 2-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, muscarinic cholinergic, nicotinic, opioid, neurotensin, substance P, adenosine A1 and neuropeptide Y receptors in the human primary motor (Brodmann's area 4) and somatosensory cortex (Brodmann's areas 3, 2 and 1). With the exception of serotonin type 2 receptors, all receptor types examined had a similar distribution in area 4 which showed little dependence on the underlying distribution of cell somata, often continuing unaltered through the somatosensory cortex despite marked cytoarchitectural changes. The highest densities occurred in the outer (most superficial) 30-40% of the cortical grey matter, followed by a band of relatively low binding and then moderate levels in the inner (deeper) region. In many instances, an additional band of dense binding could be discerned in the region of laminae IV/Va running unbroken through both gyri. The distribution of most receptor types in the somatosensory cortex also followed this pattern, except for opioid and kainic acid receptors which showed higher levels in the inner rather than the outer third of this region. At the edge of area 4, a change occurred such that a high density outer band appeared, giving these receptor types the same pattern in area 4 as the majority. Serotonin type 2 receptor levels were quite low in the outermost region of area 4, although the pattern was otherwise similar to that of the other receptors. Thus, with the exception of serotonin receptors, the similarity in many binding site distributions recently noted in area 4 of the rhesus monkey also tends to occur in the human area 4, to the extent that 2 ligands will reverse their usual cortical binding pattern to conform with the common area 4 pattern.", 
    "28": "The consumption of benzodiazepines and potent analgesics by old age pensioners and early retirees in Odense who had the right to receive medicine free-of-charge was accounted for where the month of March 1990 was concerned. Approximately 26% received financial support for benzodiazepines, 13% for analgesics while further 6% received support for both benzodiazepines and analgesics. The majority of the users were over 60 years and there twice as many women as men. No significant differences were observed in the sex and age distributions between the groups of pensioners who received benzodiazepines and/or analgesics and the group which received only other medicine. Both the direct and the indirect expenses are discussed. Furthermore, it is concluded that, in some of the pensioners, over-consumption is involved and that it is again necessary to emphasize the indications for prescription of these preparations.", 
    "29": "It is generally believed that benzodiazepines are effective and safe drugs for use in alcohol withdrawal states. The authors describe three cases in which benzodiazepines aggravated or caused confusion in alcoholic patients admitted to a general hospital for emergency medical treatment. Strategies to avoid this problem are discussed.", 
    "30": "Brief exposure to an elevated plus-maze (EPM) induces antinociception in male mice, a reaction that is not blocked by opiate receptor manipulations but which is completely inhibited by the benzodiazepine receptor agonist, diazepam. The present study examined the effects of a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic, buspirone, on EPM antinociception and behaviour. EPM antinociception was completely abolished by 10mg/kg buspirone but was largely unaffected by lower doses (0.1-1.0mg/kg) of the compound. Behaviourally, 1-10mg/kg buspirone produced changes indicative of anxiety reduction, although the high dose anxiolytic profile was at least partially compromised by a general reduction in behaviour. Data are discussed in relation to the proposal that anxiety may be a critical factor in non-opioid forms of adaptive pain inhibition.", 
    "31": "Benzodiazepines are generally reported to be active in tests based on punished responding and in procedures involving exploratory behaviour, but the effects of 5-HT drugs thus far reported are inconsistent. The effects of the two 5-HT(1A) agonists 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone were studied in a passive avoidance test and in an elevated plus-maze test. In the passive avoidance test 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone, as well as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, were effective, while, in the elevated plus-maze test, the two benzodiazepines were active whereas buspirone and 8-OH-DPAT were not. Comparing the effects of the 5-HT(1A) agonists with the two benzodiazepines in the passive avoidance test it is suggested that this test can be predictive for drugs influencing anxiety. The elevated plus-maze test has many advantages, such as the absence of noxious stimuli, compared to punishment procedures, but since the 5-HT(1A) agonists do not act as anxiolytic compounds in this test, it is suggested that the test does not provide a suitable model of anxiety.", 
    "32": "The effects of gepirone at 3, 9 and 27mg/kg (b.i.d.) on benzodiazepine (BZ) withdrawal signs were studied in rats pretreated with chlordiazepoxide for 21 days at doses up to 40mg/kg b.i.d. The BZ withdrawal indices studied were weight loss and anorexia. At 9 and 27, but not 3mg/kg (b.i.d.) gepirone potentiated the weight loss and anorexia seen during BZ withdrawal. These effects could not be attributed simply to high dose drug-induced \"malaise\" inhibiting food intake, since in drug-naive animals gepirone stimulated food intake and increased bodyweight. These data show clearly that gepirone potentiates BZ withdrawal signs. Similar findings have been reported recently in studies with ipsapirone (Goudie and Leathley, 1991). Such effects could be mediated by the a(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist actions of 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine (1-PP), an active metabolite of both gepirone and ipsapirone. Such findings may explain why prior BZ experience impairs the clinical response to buspirone-type anxiolytics acting at the 5-HT(1A) receptor.", 
    "33": "To determine whether platelet-activating factor is a specific mediator of cyclic flow variations in damaged stenotic arteries and whether it contributes to reocclusion after thrombolysis, femoral arteries in anesthetized dogs were subjected to mural injury and high grade stenosis to induce cyclic flow variations (28 +/- 4/h) or methods selected to elicit platelet-rich and fibrin-rich thrombosis. Oral administration of a novel triazolobenzodiazepine (U46,195 [10 mg/kg]) that selectively inhibits platelet-activating factor abolished cyclic flow variations within 120 min and for greater than or equal to 2 h thereafter compared with persistent flow variations in dogs given saline solution. Platelet aggregation induced ex vivo with platelet-activating factor was inhibited in parallel with in vivo inhibition of cyclic flow variations after administration of U46,195. However, buccal mucosa bleeding time was not affected. After thrombosis, administration of U46,195 before thrombolysis was induced with human recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (1.7 mg/kg intravenously over 60 min) prevented reocclusion within 120 min in six of eight and six of seven arteries by platelet-rich and fibrin-rich thrombosis, respectively. In contrast, in dogs given saline solution, reocclusion occurred in eight of eight (p = 0.007 compared with U46,195) and five of eight arteries by platelet-rich and fibrin-rich thrombosis, respectively. Thus, both cyclic flow variations and reocclusion after thrombolysis appear to be mediated in part by platelet-activating factor. The results suggest that inhibition of platelet-activating factor with specific antagonists may be useful in reducing platelet-mediated occlusion of coronary arteries without eliciting bleeding.", 
    "34": "Multiple bone marrow aspirations or biopsies and lumbar punctures are a necessary part of the diagnosis and treatment of many pediatric cancer patients. Pharmacologic sedation may decrease the distress associated with these procedures. Midazolam (MDZ, Versed) is a water-soluble, rapid-onset, short-duration benzodiazepine that has not been studied widely in children. We prospectively evaluated safety and recovery parameters for intravenous MDZ used for conscious sedation by oncologists (without an anesthesiologist in attendance) for 70 procedures (bone marrow aspirations, lumbar punctures, or bone marrow aspirations plus lumbar punctures) in 24 ambulatory pediatric cancer patients, aged 1.5 to 15.5 years. MDZ was used alone or in combination with morphine or fentanyl. Respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and heart rate were monitored. Sedation, anxiolysis, and recovery were assessed with a behavior score and a modified recovery room discharge score. Restraint was not required in 45% of the procedures. In no case was a respiratory rate less than 12 observed. In nine procedures (13%), an oxygen saturation less than or equal to 90 occurred, all within 10 minutes after the last dose of MDZ. Ten procedures (14%) required verbal stimulation to take deeper breaths. Two patients did not respond immediately to verbal stimulation and received face-mask oxygen. Hypoxemia was not correlated with opioid use. Hypoxemia appears to be related to total MDZ dose and may occur with normal respiratory rates; all cases resolved with verbal stimulation or face-mask oxygen without specific airway maneuvers or assisted ventilation. Heart rate and blood pressure remained stable in all 70 procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "35": "The influence of sedative and anxiolytic benzodiazepines on human monocyte function was assessed in 11 patients undergoing anesthesia prior to control endoscopy of the urinary tract. A single i.v. injection of 0.08 mg/kg midazolam induced a marked and delayed inhibition of the lipopolysaccharide-induced production of interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 by monocytes isolated from peripheral blood. Corticosteroids were not responsible for the observed immunosuppression. These studies demonstrate that, when administered in man, benzodiazepines markedly alter the capacity of monocytes to synthetize major mediators of the host inflammatory response.", 
    "36": "This study was undertaken to determine whether intermittent pancreatic juice diversion (PJD) from the intestine can induce pancreatic and duodenal growth. Concomitant infusions of SMS 201-995, a somatostatin analog, and L-364,718, a cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist, were used to establish the involvement of endogenous CCK. Fed rats equipped with biliary, duodenal, and pancreatic cannulae had their pancreatic juice diverted 8 h/day for 4 days and were infused or not with either SMS 201-995 (5 micrograms/kg.h) or L-364,718 (0.5 mg/kg.h) during diversion. After 4 days, rats were killed, and their pancreas and duodenum were excised for measurements of parameters indicative of growth. In normally fed rats with pancreatic juice returned, SMS 201-995 inhibited daily pancreatic secretions of volume and protein, whereas L-364,718 inhibited only protein output. These two inhibitors had no effect on normal pancreatic and duodenal growth. PJD was associated with increased volume and protein output, increased plasma CCK level, and pancreatic growth. All of these effects were completely blocked by SMS 201-995 and L-364,718, with the exception of plasma CCK level by the CCK antagonist. None of these treatments affected duodenal growth. These results suggest that intermittent infusions of these two inhibitors had no effect on normal pancreatic and duodenal growth, but were successful in preventing pancreatic growth induced by PJD. They also indicate that endogenous CCK is involved in PJD-induced pancreatic growth.", 
    "37": "We studied the effect of prolonged sedation (greater than 24 h) with isoflurane on plasma inorganic fluoride concentrations and renal function in 60 critically ill patients allocated randomly to receive either isoflurane or midazolam for sedation. In the isoflurane group, plasma fluoride increased from a mean concentration of 3.1 mumol/L to 20.0 mumol/L at the end of sedation, continued to increase to a peak of 25.3 mumol/L 16 h later, and then decreased exponentially (t1/2 = 111 h) to reach normal levels by the fifth day. In the midazolam group, the plasma fluoride increased from a mean concentration of 4.2 mumol/L to a peak of 6.8 mumol/L 12 h after starting the sedation and then decreased toward normal. Serum and urinary electrolytes, urine osmolality, and creatinine clearance during and after sedation were similar in the two groups. Isoflurane sedation was associated with an increase in plasma fluoride concentration without any clinical deterioration of renal function.", 
    "38": "Management of extensive trauma often requires immediate tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The role of anesthetic induction agents and neuromuscular blockade in the airway management of the trauma victim is disputed. To better define the role of these agents in the acute management of trauma, the adult trauma registry of The Johns Hopkins Hospital was reviewed to determine the frequency of use of these agents in acute airway management and to assess the effect of these agents on the incidence of complications. Ninety-seven patients were reviewed. Thirty-one patients were intubated because of cardiopulmonary arrest. Of the remaining 66 patients, oral intubation was initially attempted in 54. When drugs were used to facilitate intubation (n = 36), the success rate was 92 per cent on the first attempt, and 100 per cent on the second attempt. When drugs were not used (n = 18), 39 per cent could not be intubated (n = 7). Subsequent drug administration resulted in successful intubation of five of seven of these patients. Nasal intubation (no drugs) was only successful in 60 per cent of the patients (50 per cent on first attempt). Four patients required a cricothyrotomy. Two other patients vomited, and one patient aspirated. None of these patients received drugs prior to the first attempt at intubation. No hemodynamic or neurologic complications, related to relaxant or induction agent use, were observed. These findings suggest that oral intubation with drugs to facilitate airway management is most likely to result in successful intubation on the first attempt and that drug use in the trauma setting is safe.", 
    "39": "The binding characteristics and distribution of M1 and M2 muscarinic cholinergic receptors and high-affinity choline uptake sites were studied in the striatum of the rat at 3-4 and 9-12 weeks of age after exposure to unilateral perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. High-affinity choline uptake sites were labeled with [3H]hemicholinium-3, M1 receptors with [3H]pirenzepine, and M2 receptors with [3H]AF-DX 116. Saturation experiments revealed a significant decrease in the maximal binding capacity (Bmax) for [3H]pirenzepine-labeled M1 receptors in the lesioned caudate/putamen complex in immature rats with moderate brain injury, in comparison with controls. In contrast, the Bmax value for [3H]hemicholinium-3-labeled high-affinity choline uptake sites was significantly increased. No changes in dissociation constants (KD) were observed. These changes were most pronounced in the dorsolateral region of striatum. Striatal regional distribution of [3H]AF-DX 116 was not affected. In mature rats, binding of [3H]pirenzepine returned to control values, whereas [3H]hemicholinium binding showed a persistent increase (23%). The increase in [3H]hemicholinium-3 binding, as a specific marker of cholinergic nerve terminals, is consistent with our prior morphologic studies demonstrating relative preservation of cholinergic neurons and neuropil, and supports the concept that striatal cholinergic systems are resistant to hypoxic-ischemic injury.", 
    "40": "Muscle pain occurs in various neuromuscular disorders with characteristic physiological or biochemical abnormalities. There is, however, a group of patients in whom there is no clear physiological or structural basis for their pains. This syndrome has been called fibrositis or fibromyalgia. Sleep abnormalities have been reported in some of these patients, but have not been confirmed by others. We studied 8 patients with this disorder and found sleep abnormalities that were characterized by nocturnal myoclonus, alpha-delta sleep, and abnormalities compatible with depression. Polysomnography was, therefore, instrumental in helping direct the treatment of these patients. Therapeutic approaches aimed to correct the specific disorders were effective in improving the pain symptoms.", 
    "41": "Many studies have shown a relationship between fragmented nocturnal sleep and daytime sleepiness. In the current study, 9 patients, aged 55-79, with fragmented nocturnal sleep secondary to periodic leg movements and objective daytime sleepiness, as verified by Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), had 12 weeks of treatment with 0.125 mg of triazolam following 2 screening nights and 2 placebo baseline nights; 2 final placebo nights were placed 5 nights following the last medication night. The medication increased total sleep time and sleep efficiency throughout the administration period, as compared to average placebo values; total leg movements were not changed. Generally, daytime performance, as measured by a vigilance task, and objective alertness, as measured by MSLT, were improved following the use of triazolam. No adverse reactions or significant side effects were noted. It was concluded that 0.125 mg triazolam, when used for up to 3 months, could improve sleep and daytime function in older patients with periodic leg movements, fragmented sleep, and daytime sleepiness.", 
    "42": "This study was designed to determine the role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in postprandial motility pattern of the duodenum and gallbladder (GB) in conscious dogs provided with chronic duodenal electrodes for recording of myoelectric activity and GB fistulas for measurement of intraluminal pressure and volume of GB and to calculate the GB motility index (MI) and GB emptying rate. During naturally occurring activity front (phase III MMC) in the duodenum there was significant increase in the MI of GB accompanied by about 20-30% reduction in the GB volume. These changes in duodenal and GB motility pattern could be duplicated by i.v. motilin. Feeding abolished the appearance of spontaneous activity front in the duodenum and greatly increased motility of GB while reducing its volume. Administration of CCK receptor antagonists in fed dogs failed to affect the motility changes induced by meal in the duodenum but abolished these of the GB. Vagal cholinergic stimulation with insulin, 2DG or urecholine caused similar effects to that induced by food i.e. increased duodenal spike activity, abolished phase III of the MMC, decreased GB volume and increased GB motility. Pretreatment with CCK antagonists did not affect significantly duodenal spike activity or GB motility but significantly increased the GB volume. Atropine 125 micrograms/kg) blocked almost completely spontaneous activity front in the duodenum and accompanying alterations in the motility and volume of GB. We conclude that CCK contributes to the MMC related alterations in the GB motor activity and is essential in cholinergic stimulation induced of the GB emptying but not in vagally induced duodenal and GB motility.", 
    "43": "The effects of diazepam and chlorpromazine on response suppression in a social situation were studied in pigeons. Three groups of pigeons were trained to peck a key on a variable-interval 60-s schedule of reinforcement, then exposed to the pain reaction of adjoining pigeon to electric shock. Although every pigeon showed suppression of response, the suppression decreased with repeated exposures. A conditioning group received the electric shock with the exposure to the pain reaction of adjoining bird; a shock exposure group received the electric shock without any explicit conditioned stimulus; and a control group did not receive any shock. After these treatments every group was exposed to the pain reaction of the adjoining bird. The conditioning group and the shock exposure group showed clear response suppression, but the control group did not. Although chlorpromazine generally reduced response rate in all groups, diazepam selectively abolished the response suppression.", 
    "44": "Conventional benzodiazepine anxiolytics cause unwanted daytime sedation which increases the risk of behaviorally toxic reactions and may interfere with the therapeutic process. Recently a number of 'serotonergic' anxiolytics have been developed and most are under investigation in ongoing clinical trials. One, buspirone, has emerged into clinical practice. It is said to possess a much lower sedative potential than benzodiazepines and to be a safer and more effective anxiolytic for that reason. An extensive literature concerning buspirone's behavioral effects generally supports these assertions. Nonetheless, studies conducted to date are of variable quality; have revealed some adverse effects of buspirone; and, have left several critical questions unanswered. The present review seeks to provide a comprehensive picture of the drug's known effects on human performance and related variables, such as sleep and subjective reactions. It discusses deficiencies of particular studies and the limitations of present knowledge. Finally it suggests how future studies might be better designed to provide information of greater clinical relevance.", 
    "45": "Effects of a benzodiazepine receptor agonist (diazepam) and an antagonist (Ro 15-1788, flumazenil) administered separately or in combination on field potentials recorded from the hippocampal dentate area were examined in unanesthetized, unrestrained rats. Population excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked by stimulation of the perforant path were depressed significantly by diazepam (4 mg/kg, i.p.). However, diazepam did not affect the firing (spike) threshold of dentate granule cells. The injection of Ro 15-1788 (4 mg/kg, i.p.) alone affected neither excitatory synaptic transmission nor population spike threshold. Strength of gamma-amino butyric acid-mediated recurrent inhibition as measured by the paired-pulse technique was potentiated by diazepam but unaffected by Ro 15-1788. However, the diazepam-enhanced inhibition was reversed by a subsequent administration of Ro 15-1788. Previous studies indicate that Ro 15-1788 acts not only as a selective benzodiazepine antagonist but also as a partial agonist-antagonist or an inverse agonist depending probably on doses. The present study demonstrated that Ro 15-1788 acted as a pure antagonist at low doses. These data suggest that the clinical use of Ro 15-1788 at high doses against comas induced by unidentified drugs could worsen the conditions and that low doses are recommendable for initial treatments because of its pure antagonist action.", 
    "46": "83 adults undergoing dental surgical procedures in local anesthesia were monitored continuously with a pulse oximeter for hypoxemia. 30 patients received as premedication either a combination of a neuroleptic drug and an opiate or a benzodiazepine. There was a drop in the oxygen saturation in 80% of the patients with premedication but only in 66% of the patients without. There were statistical highly significant more periods of hypoxemia in patients with premedication compared to the others. (1548 periods versus 659 periods p less than 0.001). The kind of premedication/sedation does not influence the number of hypoxic episodes. We conclude that especially patients with premedication should only be treated by surgeons with sufficient clinical experience in coping with emergency situations.", 
    "47": "Placebo and triazolam (0.125, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/70 kg of body weight) were administered to male subjects under double-blind conditions prior to experimental sessions which provided three operant response options. These options were: 1) responding maintained by the presentation of points exchangeable for money, 2) responding which ostensibly resulted in the subtraction of points from a fictitious person was termed aggressive since this responding resulted in the delivery of an aversive stimulus to another person, and 3) responding which ostensibly protected the subject's point counter from subtractions initiated by the other person and was termed escape. Aggressive and escape responding were initiated by subtracting points from the subject. Point subtractions were attributed to the other person. Aggressive and escape responding were maintained by initiation of provocation-free intervals (PFI), during which no further point subtractions were presented. Triazolam produced dose-dependent decreases in point-maintained and escape responding. The effects of triazolam on aggressive responding varied across subjects.", 
    "48": "Epidemiological characteristics of acute drug poisoning in children were investigated over a period of two years (1988-1989). The total number of poisonings was 450. Among causes of poisoning psychopharmaca, especially benzodiazepine, came first (33.3%). They were followed by drugs affecting the nervous system (9.1%), usually by analgoantipyretics, and by drugs affecting the cardiovascular system (7.8%). In 10.6% of the cases poisoning was due to two or more drugs. In 12.3% of the poisonings drug was unknown. Sodium fluoride was the most frequent single cause of acute poisoning. The average age of the poisoned children was 5.1 years. Poisoning with drugs was more frequent among girls than among boys (55:45%). In more than half poisoning accidents there was no one present when poisoning occurred. A major number of poisonings were an attention-getting gesture or a suicidal attempt. There were 11 cases of repeated poisoning with the same drug.", 
    "49": "The aim of this study was to compare the anticonvulsive and protective effects of diazepam and midazolam in rats poisoned by chemical warfare agents. In rats treated with soman, sarin or VX, the anticonvulsive effects of midazolam and diazepam were of similar magnitude. Atropine and oxime HI-6 decreased the toxicity of soman, sarin and VX 1.65, 2.06 and 18.3 times, respectively. The introduction of diazepam and midazolam in the therapy of rats poisoned by VX and sarin led to further improvement of protective indices. Midazolam was even more effective than diazepam. A reliable protective effect was obtained with the lowest dose of both benzodiazepines used (0.5 mg/kg). The specific benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil abolished, almost completely, the protective effect of both benzodiazepines. These data confirmed a significant role of the gabaergic system in poisoning with organophosphorus compounds, especially during the initial stage of intoxication.", 
    "50": "Patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) receive numerous medications from multiple providers. As a result, it is important that medication usage is properly documented in each patient's medical record. Lack of adequate documentation may confound a provider's assessment of drug efficacy, potentially leading to an increased incidence of drug interactions and adverse effects. The objective of this study was to determine if discrepancies exist between patient-reported medication usage and that documented in the medical record by healthcare providers. Data were obtained using structured telephone surveys and medical chart review. Study participants were recruited from the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center AIDS Clinic. Results obtained for 41 patients demonstrated discrepancies between patient-reported medication usage and that documented in the medical record ranging from 9 to 92 percent, depending on the class of drug. The largest differences were observed with the \"as-needed\" class of drugs: benzodiazepines (92 percent), morphine (60 percent), and codeine (56 percent). Differences were also noted for scheduled medications: ketoconazole (54 percent), clotrimazole (45 percent), acyclovir (38 percent), zidovudine (15 percent), and pentamidine (9 percent). These observed discrepancies reaffirm the need for accurate exchange of information between provider and patient to promote the most effective, rational, and safe drug therapy. Careful reviews of medication usage at each visit and use of pharmacy-based medication profiles are potential mechanisms to improve documentation of medication usage in HIV-infected patients.", 
    "51": "Intranasal delivery of flurazepam, midazolam, and triazolam was studied in a dog model as a possible alternate route of drug administration for treatment of insomnia. Four beagles received each hypnotic by both intranasal and oral routes on two separate occasions. Plasma concentrations for each hypnotic after dosing were measured by electron-capture gas-liquid chromatography. The mean intranasal absorption rates (tmax) of flurazepam, midazolam, and triazolam were 1.7, 2.0, and 2.6 times faster, respectively, compared with oral dosing. The mean dose-normalized peak concentrations (Cmax) after intranasal delivery were 16.4, 2.9, and 3.4 times higher, respectively, versus oral administration. The mean dose-normalized AUCs estimated for these compounds after nasal administration were 2.4-, 2.5-, and at least 2-fold larger than after oral administration for midazolam, triazolam, and flurazepam, respectively. If these observations can be extrapolated to humans, the faster absorption achieved by the intranasal route would appear to benefit insomniacs characterized by difficulty in falling asleep because of an anticipated faster sedative effect onset. The higher peak concentrations and larger amounts absorbed in the case of intranasal midazolam and triazolam delivery may lead to dose reduction.", 
    "52": "In progressive stages of infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the majority of patients develop a pathophysiologically not yet completely explainable bone marrow failure with anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The clinically most widely used HIV-inhibiting antiviral drugs azidothymidine (AZT) and dideoxyinosine (ddI) frequently are hematotoxic to the host, resulting in dose reduction or discontinuation of antiviral therapy. In recent studies, a novel series of benzodiazepine derivatives highly active against HIV-1 was synthesized. These antiviral compounds have a much more favorable therapeutical index than the well-known 2'3'-dideoxyribosides, like AZT. In the experiments presented here, the authors investigated the most promising derivative R82913 [(+)-S-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-9-chloro-5-methyl- 6-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)-imidazo[4,5,1-jk] [1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-thione] (TIBO) with regard to its toxicity on bone marrow-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells from six HIV-1+ and HIV- persons, respectively. In methylcellulose assays for hematopoietic colony growth any hematotoxic effects of R82913 in vitro were excluded, as both groups showed no difference of progenitor cell growth with or without the TIBO derivative, even at concentrations 6.7 x 10(4) times higher than the 50% inhibitory concentration for cytopathicity by HIV-1.", 
    "53": "During the past two decades, substantial progress has been made in the understanding of the clinical features, classification, pathophysiology, central nervous system consequences, and treatment of status epilepticus. The most commonly used drug regimens have advantages and disadvantages, and, in this review, I recommend a protocol for the treatment of status epilepticus. An important concept in the approach to patients in generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus is that treatment should be administered within a predetermined time frame. Clinical and experimental research indicates that continuous seizure activity for longer than 60 to 90 minutes may result in irreversible brain damage. As our understanding of the basic mechanisms of neuronal function and seizure generation advances, it is expected that more specific and novel approaches to the treatment of status epilepticus will emerge.", 
    "54": "The mechanism of release from sustained-release adinazolam mesylate tablets was assessed by the Higuchi equation and by analysis of drug release profiles through 60% released using the Peppas equation. Computed values of the diffusional exponent, n, ranged from 0.59 to 0.66. Values of n in this range are consistent with a mixed mechanism of release, with diffusion of drug through the hydrated polymer matrix and relaxation of this matrix being the principal processes controlling release. The rate of in vitro drug release was increased for half tablets relative to whole tablets and is attributed to an increase in the surface to volume ratio of half tablets of about 16%. This increase in surface-to-volume ratio of half tablets was reflected by an increase in the constant, k, from the Peppas equation of 20-23% and by an increase in the slope of Higuchi plots of 12-18% for four lots of tablets. In vivo/in vitro relationships from two bioavailability studies were thoroughly evaluated. Using either a linear or a quadratic relationship, an in vivo/in vitro correlation exists for sustained-release adinazolam mesylate tablets.", 
    "55": "High-dose fentanyl has become a popular anesthetic agent for cardiac anesthesia because of its cardiac stability. Little attention has yet been paid to the relationship between the dose and problems during the early postoperative period. This study was designed to investigate whether higher doses of fentanyl combined with diazepam would influence the early-stage of postoperative conditions. Sixteen patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery were studied. All of them had adequate cardiac performance, and were randomly divided into two groups, 9 in Group I and 7 in Group II. Group I received fentanyl (less than 100 micrograms/kg) combined with diazepam (less than 0.2 mg/kg). In Group II the doses of both drugs were greater than that used in Group I. The cardiovascular changes, the maximal infusion rates of dopamine, nitroglycerin (NTG), and sodium nitroprusside (Nipride) were observed. Meanwhile, the awakening time from anesthesia, the time of extubation, and the duration of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) were also recorded. The results showed that there were no significant differences between both groups regarding the factors studied except the maximal infusion rate of Nipride and the awakening time of post-anesthesia. We suggest that higher doses of fentanyl combined with diazepam can reduce the dosage of vasodilator but do not prolong the time of extubation and stay in ICU.", 
    "56": "Elderly persons are apt to receive multiple drugs for many diseases. Prescribers should take extra care in persons aged over 65-70 years, and especially the very old. The main problem of the elderly is the unpredictability of their response to drugs. Self-medication with both prescribed and over-the-counter drugs worsens this problem. Drug actions may be altered by impairment of the liver, kidneys and brain, or acute illness, or both. Unwanted (adverse) drug reactions often produce rapid and unduly severe illness in the old. Some antibacterial antibiotics like the sulphonamides are best avoided. Taking many drugs together promotes adverse interactions between the drugs. Drugs with a narrow therapeutic ratio, such as warfarin, digoxin, the aminoglycosides, and many antiarrhythmic drugs, cause clinical problems. Old persons respond more abruptly to drugs like benzodiazepines, opioid analgesics, and antiparkinsonian drugs. Anaesthesia given on top of psychotropic drugs may damage the central nervous system. The elderly brain is more sensitive to induction agents and short-acting intravenous anaesthetics, like alfentanil and midazolam; the elderly liver is more easily damaged by inhalational anaesthetics like halothane. The overall benefit:risk ratio should be judged for every drug in each patient. Wherever possible, drug treatment should be avoided. If drugs are given, safe drugs with broad therapeutic ratios and tissue- or receptor-specific actions are preferable. Drug doses are usually, but not always, reduced. Benefit from a drug should be assessed early. Severe unpredictable adverse reactions need immediate cessation of the drug and prompt patient support. The practitioner should frequently review the patient's continuing need for drugs.",

Prior to clonazepam treatment and after a 5-week treatment period, patients underwent a 35% carbon dioxide challenge procedure. Following clonazepam treatment, a significant reduction in carbon dioxide vulnerability was observed.", 
    "58": "The potentiation of fluoxetine by buspirone is described in three cases of treatment-resistant depression. All three patients improved markedly with very few side-effects from the medication. The possibility of synergy between drugs that affect serotonin reuptake inhibition, 5HT1A receptors and 5HT2 receptors is discussed.", 
    "59": "Brief exposure to an elevated plus-maze has been shown to induce antinociception in male mice, a reaction that is not attenuated by manipulations of opiate receptors but which is fully blocked by diazepam. The present study examined the effects of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil (5-20 mg/kg), on behavioural and antinociceptive responses to the elevated plus-maze in male DBA/2 mice. The results showed that, in the absence of an effect on total arm entries or rearing, flumazenil increased the time spent on the closed arms of the maze (an anxiogenic profile) and significantly enhanced antinociception induced by the elevated plus-maze. Data are discussed in relation to an \"endogenous ligand theory\" and it is concluded that the present findings are consistent with the proposed involvement of anxiety in at least certain forms of adaptive inhibition of pain.", 
    "60": "The application of visual evoked potentials (VEP) as a monitoring tool was studied in 40 comatose neurological intensive care patients. With increasing depth of coma, the number of detectable VEP components decreased. In deeply comatose patients, VEP were regularly displayed as a negative wave with a latency of app. 100 ms and an amplitude of app. 8 microV (N100). The administration of promethazine or flunitrazepam used as sedatives produced a decrease of amplitude and an increase of latency of N100 that was reversed within 30 or 60 min respectively. In 10 patients, in which intraventricular pressure (IVP) was measured continuously by means of an intraventricular catheter, it was found that increases of IVP produced a considerable decrease of the amplitude and area of N100; after reduction of the increased IVP, both parameters quickly recovered. These observations indicate that VEP may be a useful tool for neuro-monitoring in neurological intensive care patients.", 
    "61": "To determine the combined effects of the H2-receptor antagonist famotidine (FAM) and M1-receptor antagonist pirenzepine (PZ) on tetragastrin-stimulated acid production, 10 mg of FAM was intravenously injected into 6 healthy volunteers, alone and in combination with 20 mg of PZ. Physiologic saline was administered separately for control purposes. Compared with physiologic saline, both FAM and the FAM + PZ combination significantly reduced gastric secretion, acidity, acid output, and pepsin secretion. Concomitant use of PZ significantly enhanced FAM-induced reduction of overall gastric secretion, but did not enhance decreases in acid output, acidity, or pepsin secretion. These results indicate that combination therapy with intravenous FAM and PZ may be more useful than monotherapy with FAM in the treatment of gastroduodenal bleeding.", 
    "62": "Drug absorption from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the impact of GI surgery and disease on drug absorption are discussed. Recommendations are made to manage problems of drug malabsorption. Absorption from the GI tract is a first-order process described by its rate and extent. GI surgery changes the anatomy of the GI tract and alters important variables in the absorption process. In the wake of procedures which diminish small bowel surface area, the extent of absorption of phenytoin, digoxin, cyclosporin, aciclovir, hydrochlorothiazide and certain oral contraceptives is reported to be reduced. The underlying cause of the reduction is unknown. When gastric emptying time or pH are altered by surgery, the rate of drug absorption appears to be reduced. However, it is not clear which variable is more important in determining therapeutic effects. The effects of coeliac and inflammatory bowel diseases on the distribution and clearance of drugs must be considered before attributing abnormal serum concentrations of drugs to malabsorption. GI disease may slow gastric emptying and delay the complete absorption of drugs when their rate of absorption depends on gastric emptying time. Other inflammatory GI diseases such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the gut, Beh\u00e7et's syndrome and scleroderma involving the GI tract may directly reduce absorption of drugs such as cyclosporin, amitriptyline, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and penicillamine. GI diseases which alter gut pH affect the absorption only of drugs with limited water solubility and pH-dependent dissolution such as ketoconazole. Clinicians should be aware of the variable absorption seen after GI disease and surgery and monitor their patients accordingly.", 
    "63": "Midazolam is often used for the premedication of children in the pre-school age group. Different noninvasive routes of administration have been described. In a prospective study we compared the effects of oral, rectal, and nasal midazolam in commonly used dosages. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Ninety children undergoing surgery under general anesthesia were assigned to oral (0.4 mg/kg) (MO), rectal (0.5 mg/kg) (MR), or nasal (0.2 mg/kg) midazolam (MN), according to the child's and/or parent's preferred route of administration, after having obtained the parent's informed consent. It was applied on the ward before transport to the operating room. The following parameters were assessed by the observer and the anesthesiologist at different times: sedation, acceptance (child, anesthesiologist), mood, emotion, resistance, pain, nausea and vomiting, blood pressure, and heart and respiratory rates. The Wilcoxon test (P less than 0.05) was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS. All groups were comparable with respect to age, weight, and surgery experience. There was no difference in the anesthesiologist's acceptance of the premedication or the cooperation of the children. The children accepted MO significantly better compared to MN and MR. The fastest onset of sedation was found after MR. Immediately after MN many children became euphoric, and it turned out that the effect of MN was rather euphoric than sedative. The effect of MO was good in many children, but less predictable. This led to a significant delay in transport to the operating room. MO children experienced more nausea and vomiting (P less than 0.05) in the postoperative period. There were no differences in physiological parameters. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS. The results can be explained by the different characteristics of absorption and patient acceptance. The route of administration according to the child's or parent's choice can be recommended but does not guarantee success. MR had the fastest onset of sedative action due to faster absorption of the drug. MN had a euphoric effect that resulted almost immediately. Oral premedication was best accepted, nasal administration worst. MO produced more side effects than MR and MN in the postoperative period. If the child accepts the rectal route of administration, this should be preferred because of the high success rate and few side effects.", 
    "64": "The literature shows that benzodiazepines, in view of their anxiolytic, sedative, amnesic, muscle relaxant and anticonvulsive action, are the most important substances for premedication. Eminent workers regard anxiolysis as the most important aim of premedication. In the present clinical study, oral administration of the two different benzodiazepine derivatives, flunitrazepam (F) and chlorazepate dipotassium (CD) have been explored with a view to side effects, tolerance, quality of sleep during the night, anxiolytic effect and sedation. The study involved 108 women patients aged from 20 to 60 years (ASA class I or II), all scheduled to undergo gynecological surgery in general anesthesia. There were also 20 women who received no premedication. The three groups of patients were further divided into early (operation started before 10:30 a.m.) and late-operation (operation started after 10:30 a.m.) groups. The test drugs were administered as follows: 43 women received 50 mg CD p.o. on the evening before the operation, followed by 25 mg p.o. in the morning; 45 women received 2 mg F p.o. on the evening before the operation, followed by 1 mg p.o. in the morning. All patients took the preoperative premedication at 7 o'clock in the morning. Following this medication, the anxiolytic, sedative, and amnesic effects, side effects, vigilance and O2 saturation (SaO2) were determined at defined points during the day of the operation and the 1st postoperative day. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded and interpreted as physiological stress parameters. Anxiolysis was determined using the Erlangen Anxiety Scale (EAS) of Galster and Sp\u00f6rl; the degree of sedation was assessed by the anesthesiologist; amnesia was determined by the patients' recognition of picture cards; vigilance and side-effects were assessed by standardized questionnaires. Both active drugs clearly improved the quality of sleep in the night before the operation over that experienced with no premedication. There were no significant differences among the three groups in the physiological stress parameters. The preoperative SaO2 saturation was decreased significantly by oral F, but it was always more than 95%. CD had little influence on the SaO2. Unwanted somatic symptoms were found a little more frequently in the group without any premedication. There were no signs of restricted tolerance for either of the test drugs. In the premedicated groups, pre- and postoperative anxiety decreased significantly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "65": "Human endozepine, an 86 amino acid polypeptide, was originally isolated from human brain tissue as a putative ligand of the benzodiazepine receptor. Complete amino acid sequencing of the human and bovine proteins revealed significant homology with the partial sequence of diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), a protein from rat brain. Both endozepine and DBI have been shown to elicit behavioral effects, suggesting that they function as pharmacologically-active ligands of the GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor complex. Subsequent cDNA cloning of human and bovine endozepine, rat DBI and human DBI has shown that these proteins are encoded by the same gene. A related cDNA, encoding a transmembrane protein of 533 amino acids with a domain homologous to DBI, has also been cloned from bovine brain.", 
    "66": "Diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) is a peptide, initially identified for its ability of displacing the binding of diazepam. The screening of lambda gt 10 cDNA libraries from rat brain with a 47merdeoxyoligonucleotide probe, complementary to a small portion of DBI coding region, allowed the isolation of cDNA clones encoding the entire aminoacid sequence of DBI. This sequence, when compared to that of mouse, human and bovine, revealed that DBI is a well conserved peptide, suggesting a similar function in different species. In order to characterize the function of DBI, studies on the regulation of DBI gene expression were undertaken. The expression of DBI mRNA occurs unevenly in the brain, as well as in peripheral tissues. Moreover, the biosynthesis of DBI is up-regulated in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex of rats made tolerant to diazepam, suggesting that changes in the biosynthesis of DBI might be one of the mechanisms eliciting tolerance to benzodiazepine. In peripheral tissues, the expression of DBI mRNA changes during development. In liver, the content of DBI mRNA was found maximal at postnatal day 1. In contrast, in kidney and heart a linear increase in levels of DBI mRNA was observed from postnatal day 1 to the adult stage, where it reached its maximum level. The tissue specific regulation of DBI mRNA expression, both pharmacologically or developmentally, leads to the hypothesis that DBI might have different functions in different tissues. This would be in line with recent findings that DBI might be also involved in the regulation of an important step of cell metabolism.", 
    "67": "The experiments were carried out on white mice whose brain was irradiated transcranially with laser light in infrared range. Exposure to irradiation was 20 min. In one group of animals only laser light was used, in others laser was combined with morphine (3mg/kg), clonidine (0.5 mg/kg), and diazepam (1 mg/kg) injected intraperitoneally. The nociceptive reactions were studied with the help of \"tail-flick\" and \"hot-plate\" tests. It was found that laser light did not modify significantly the results of both tests. Moreover, it didn't influence the antinociceptive properties of morphine, clonidine and diazepam in the \"hot-plate\" test. In the \"tail-flick\" test laser light did not affect the action of clonidine, but provided naloxone-independent antinociceptive reaction with diazepam and increased the antinociceptive effect of morphine. Laser irradiation of the brain did not cause any significant morphological changes. These results suggest the possibility of modulating antinociceptive actions of morphine and diazepam by laser irradiation of the brain.", 
    "68": "The muscarinic antagonist AF-DX 384 (5,11-dihydro-11-(((2-(2-((dipropylamino)methyl)-1- piperidinyl)ethyl)amino)carbonyl)-6H-pyrido(2,3b)(1,4)-benzodiazepin+ ++-6-one methansulfonate) was used to label cholinergic muscarinic receptors of the M2 subtype in rat brain. In the brainstem [3H] AF-DX 384 labeled a single population of binding sites with Kd = 3-4 nM and Bmax = 430-610 fmol/mg of protein. The pharmacological profile of these sites was similar to that observed with the muscarinic M2 agonist [3H] AF-DX 116. Muscarinic M2 receptors were unequally distributed in rat brain regions: in brainstem, about 80% of total muscarinic receptors (measured with [3H] quinuclidinyl benzilate) were labeled by [3H] AF-DX 384, while in other brain areas they represented only a fraction of total binding. Because of its high specific binding, high affinity and specificity, [3H] AF-DX 384 represents a useful novel ligand to study M2 receptors in brain tissue.", 
    "69": "Autoradiography of [3H] quinuclidinyl benzilate was used to demonstrate the distribution of muscarinic acetylcholine binding in the spinal cord of sheep. Binding was confined to the grey matter of the cord, and was most densely distributed in the substantia gelatinosa region of the dorsal horn, the lamina X region around the central canal, the intermediolateral columns and in various regions of the ventral horn. The use of specific M1 and M2 receptor subtype ligands, pirenzipine and 4-DAMP indicated that both receptor subtypes were present in most regions of dense binding.", 
    "70": "In this study the anxiety-related components of rhesus monkey infant behavior at an early stage of social development were examined. Eight rhesus infants (age 30-40 weeks) belonging to 3 captive groups were administered with an anxiogenic drug (beta-CCE; 0.2 mg/kg) and an anxiolytic drug (midazolam; 0.2 mg/kg). Saline solution was used as placebo. All infants were tested twice with each drug (four times with placebo) and their behavioral interactions with their mother and other social companions were recorded in 1-hr observation sessions. No convulsant or sedative effects of the drugs were observed. beta-CCE was associated with an increase in time spent by the infant with its mother and a concomitant reduction in proximity with other individuals and in social play. Midazolam did not affect the mother-infant interaction but increased the infant's locomotor activity away from the mother and its proximity and social play with juveniles and subadults when compared to peers. These results suggest that, although infant anxiety can be experimentally induced, it is not a major component of the mother-infant relationship. Infant anxiety, however, might affect the formation of other social bonds and play a part in the development of avoidance responses toward other individuals.", 
    "71": "The in vitro effect of the halothane metabolite, trifluoroacetic acid, on the protein binding of three different benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam and midazolam) has been investigated. Furthermore, protein binding of these drugs was studied in serum from patients under the effect of halothane anesthesia (1-2.5%; 2.5 h). Trifluoroacetic acid, 4 mmol/l, displaced diazepam and midazolam from serum and produced a marked increase in the free percentage, but did not influence lorazepam binding. Moreover, 48 h after the end of halothane anesthesia, there were changes in protein binding of diazepam (3.9 +/- 0.3% at 48 h vs. 3.3 +/- 0.3% before halothane anesthesia; p less than 0.05). It can be concluded that halothane anesthesia (1-2.5%; 2.5 h) may temporarily potentiate the pharmacological effect of diazepam in the postoperative period following anesthetic procedures.", 
    "72": "At least three pharmacologically different muscarinic receptor subtypes (M1, M2 and M3) have been identified in rat brain. While M1 and M2 subtypes can be directly labelled by selective ligands (3H-pirenzepine and 3H-AF-DX 116, respectively), there are no truly selective ligands for the M3 subtype. In the present study, we have investigated a possible method of studying the pharmacological M3 subtype in rat forebrain using the non-selective labelled antagonist 3H-N-methyl-scopolamine (3H-NMS) in the presence of unlabelled pirenzepine to protect the M1 subtype. The results obtained in kinetic experiments using 3H-NMS in presence of 30.10(-9) M unlabelled pirenzepine (Kon 1.2.10(-8) M-1 m-1, Koff 4.7.10(-2) m-1 and Kd 0.4.10(-9) M) are compatible with the studies carried out in rat pancreatic islets and submaxillary gland which contain predominantly the M3 subtype. We have also performed inhibition experiments with the selective antagonist AF-DX 116. Due to the small proportion of M2 receptors present in rat forebrain, this drug is able to discriminate between M1 and non M1 non M2 receptor subtypes in competition experiments with 3H-NMS versus AF-DX 116 (Ki values 0.28.10(-6) M and 4.3.10(-6) M, respectively). When the competition experiments were performed using 3H-NMS in presence of 30.10(-9) M unlabelled pirenzepine, the Ki value obtained was 3.8.10(-6) M, very close to the value obtained for the non M1 non M2 receptor in competition experiments with 3H-NMS versus AF-DX 116 and in excellent agreement with the affinity of this drug for the glandular M3 subtype. All these data suggest that the approach using the non-selective antagonist 3H-N-methyl-scopolamine in presence of unlabelled pirenzepine allows the study of the pharmacological M3 subtype in rat forebrain.", 
    "73": "The clinical effects and pharmacokinetics of ketamine and midazolam, administered continuously for prolonged sedation were studied in 7 critically ill patients under mechanical ventilation. Initially ketamine 1 mg.kg-1 and midazolam 0.1 mg.kg-1 were administered intravenously and these were followed by infusion at a rate of 1.0 mg.kg-1.hr-1 of ketamine and 0.05 mg.kg-1.hr-1 of midazolam. The infusion rate was changed every 30 minute with increments of 0.5 mg.kg-1.hr-1 of ketamine and 0.05 mg.kg-1.hr-1 of midazolam until the sedative score by Ramsy RAE reached rank 4 (i.e. slow response to loud verbal commands). The plasma concentrations of ketamine were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography and those of midazolam using gas chromatography. The mean maintenance doses of ketamine and midazolam were 2.25 +/- 0.61 mg.kg-1.hr-1 and 0.11 +/- 0.05 mg.kg-1.hr-1 (mean +/- SD), respectively. There were no significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate before and after the injection of ketamine and midazolam in all the patients. The plasma concentrations of ketamine and midazolam were 2.98 +/- 0.20 micrograms.ml-1 and 494.1 +/- 66.7 ng.ml-1, respectively. The time to clear response to verbal commands after cessation of the continuous infusion was 168 +/- 109 min. The plasma concentrations of ketamine and midazolam decreased rapidly, and plasma half-life of ketamine was about 1 hour and for midazolam less than 2 hours. In conclusion, continuous infusion of ketamine and midazolam was very useful to sedate critically ill patients under mechanical ventilation, with minimal effect on the cardiovascular system and rapid recovery of consciousness.", 
    "74": "Midazolam (0.2 mg.kg-1) was administered to ten patients undergoing neurosurgical operation and its influence on CBF was studied under modified NLA. Simultaneously, the plasma concentration of midazolam was measured. Heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure showed no significant changes after injection in comparison with the control. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) decreased for about 15-20% after 5 minutes, 10 minutes and 15 minutes in comparison with the control. However, 30 minutes later, CBF showed a trend to return to the control. This change in CBF is related to the changes of cerebro-vascular resistance. We applied cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) to evaluate cerebral metabolism. OEF was constant, showing no significant changes. It is concluded that cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2) has decreased together with the decrease in CBF. The plasma concentration of midazolam was 250-300 ng.ml-1 or greater after 5 minutes, 10 minutes and 15 minutes. We think that the sedative dose of midazolam can also sufficiently reduce CBF and CMRO2. The results suggest that midazolam is a safe and effective agent to use for anesthesia and provides adequate sedation for patients with intracranial hypertension."
