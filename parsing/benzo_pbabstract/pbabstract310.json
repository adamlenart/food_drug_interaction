Cerebral flow was estimated from diazepam uptake. Physical integrity of the BBB was assessed with sucrose/inulin spaces; functional integrity was assessed with glucose uptake, which was saturable with a Km of approximately 17 mmol/L and Vmax of 310 mmol x 100 g(-1) x min(-1). Brain uptake of a Pgp substrate (colchicine) was significantly enhanced (two- to fourfold) in mdr1a(-/-) mice. These data suggest that the model is applicable to elucidating the effects of efflux transporters, including Pgp, on brain uptake.", 
    "1": "Increases in cortical cerebral blood flow are induced by stimulation of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. This response is mediated in part by nitric oxide (NO) and reportedly involves both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, some of which are possibly located in the vessel wall. In the present study, the vasomotor response(s) elicited by acetylcholine (ACh) on isolated and pressurized bovine and/or human intracortical penetrating arterioles were investigated, and pharmacological characterization of the receptor involved in this response was carried out. Acetylcholine (10(-11) to 10(-4) mol/L) dose dependently dilated bovine and human intracortical arterioles at spontaneous tone (respective pD2 values of 6.4+/-0.3 and 7.2+/-0.3 and E(Amax) of 65.0+/-26.8 and 43.2+/-30.1% of the maximal dilation obtained with papaverine) and bovine arterioles after preconstriction with serotonin (pD2 = 6.3+/-0.1, E(Amax) = 80.0+/-17.9% of induced tone). In contrast, nicotine (10(-8) to 10(-4) mol/L) failed to induce any vasomotor response in bovine vessels whether at spontaneous or at pharmacologically induced tone. Application of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA; 10(-5) mol/L) elicited a gradual constriction (approximately 20%) of the arterioles, indicating the presence of constitutive NO release in these vessels. Nomega-Nitro-L-argigine (10(-5) to 10(-4) mol/L) also significantly blocked the dilation induced by ACh. The muscarinic ACh receptor (mAChR) antagonists pirenzepine, 4-DAMP, and AF-DX 384 dose dependently inhibited the dilatation induced by ACh (10(-5) mol/L) with the following rank order of potency: 4-DAMP (pIC50 = 9.2+/-0.3) > pirenzepine (pIC50 = 6.7+/-0.4) > AF-DX 384 (pIC50 = 5.9+/-0.2). These results suggest that ACh can induce a potent, dose-dependent, and NO-mediated dilation of bovine and/or human intracortical arterioles via interaction with an mAChR that best corresponds to the M5 subtype.", 
    "2": "The effect of vitamin E and clobazam on lipid peroxides [LP] in the rat brain and the pattern of electroshock-induced seizures were assessed. Significant increase in the concentration of brain LP at the peak of seizures was found. Both vitamin E and clobazam reduced the levels of LP in the rat brain after electroshock. Clobazam combined with vitamin E inhibited markedly formation of LP in the rats with electroshock-induced seizures. Vitamin E augmented anticonvulsant effect of clobazam though itself it had not exhibited any anticonvulsant effect in this model of seizures. The action of two drugs combined resulted in reducing the intensity and the duration of seizures, and only minimal seizures were observed. In our opinion the obtained results possess some interesting clinical aspect They suggest that the combined treatment with clobazam and vitamin E of epileptic patient may decrease the intensity of epileptic seizures due to inhibition of LP formation.", 
    "3": "The distribution of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) in the retina of the albino rabbit, Lepus cunicula, was studied by autoradiography using [3H]-PK11195, a isoquinoline carboxamide, as a tracer. Autoradiograms obtained by directly placing the slides containing the retina sections on tritium-sensitive film provide evidence for the presence of PBRs in rabbit retina. Furthermore, the dark field examination of photomicrographs taken from autoradiograms showed two dense horizontal bands corresponding to the outer and inner photoreceptor segments, and to the inner plexiform layer. The retinal regions where [3H]-PK11195 binding was more dense are rich in mitochondria, suggesting that as in other neuronal tissues, retinal PBRs are involved in the mitochondrial activity.", 
    "4": "Thermal desorption gas chromatography (TDGC) was applied to the analysis of 13 kinds of tablets containing different benzodiazepines (BZDs). An aliquot of ground tablet sample (0.1-1 mg), weighed into a platinum sample cup, was placed in a furnace pyrolyzer where the sample was heated up to a suitable temperature (150-500 degrees C) so that BZD was desorbed from the sample powder. The desorbed components of BZDs were immediately transferred into a separation column by a helium carrier gas without using any trapping techniques. The desorbed components were identified by TDGC-mass spectrometry. Among various BZDs, fludiazepam, nimetazepam and mexazolam in tablet samples were determined by the present method. Thus, the results obtained were in good agreement with the specified values. Correlation coefficients of the calibration lines for the three BZDs' ranged from 0.997 to 0.999 for several micrograms to about 10 microg of the components. Relative standard deviations of this method were < 4.1% for 4 or 5 runs.",

Despite nationally recommended discharge criteria, in busy outpatient settings, children may be sent home into the care of their parents after a brief recovery from sedation, placing them at risk for adverse events in an unmonitored setting. Previous studies have not addressed issues such as requirement for escalation of care after discharge (ie, emergency department visits or hospitalization), or parental satisfaction with their child's sedation experience. This study was undertaken to evaluate the recovery and delayed adverse events after discharge of children who received sedation for magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography.",

Sedative drugs were ordered at the discretion of the radiologist responsible for the procedure in accordance with institutional sedation guidelines and in consideration of the child's health status. Pediatric nurses in the diagnostic areas administered the sedative agent(s) and monitored children according to preestablished institutional guidelines. Demographics, sedative(s) administered, and adverse events including hypoxemia (decrease in SpO(2) by >/=10% of baseline) and sedation events such as inadequate, failed, or excessive sedation, were documented on the institutional quality assurance tool. Children were discharged from the hospital when they met the following preestablished discharge criteria: return to baseline vital signs, level of consciousness close to baseline, and the ability to maintain a patent airway. The following day, parents were telephoned and questioned regarding the child's alertness, side effects, and whether medical follow-up had been sought. Parents also rated their overall satisfaction with the sedation experience.", 
    "7": "Three hundred seventy six children comprised the sample. Eighty nine percent of children received chloral hydrate (CH; 64 +/- 13 mg/kg), and 11% midazolam (.15 +/-.13 mg/kg) as the primary sedative. There was an 8% incidence of failed sedation, and a 1.6% incidence of hypoxemia during the procedure. Three children required prolonged monitoring in the postanesthesia care unit before discharge; 1 child attributable to an allergic reaction, a second attributable to wheezing and oxygen desaturation, and the third attributable to prolonged sedation from CH and midazolam. These children were discharged home from the postanesthesia care unit without additional sequelae. Side effects after discharge included: motor imbalance (31%), gastrointestinal effects (23%), agitation (19%), and restlessness (14%). Agitation and restlessness lasted greater than 6 hours in more than one third of children who experienced these effects. CH was more commonly associated with imbalance compared with midazolam, and restlessness and prolonged imbalance were associated with younger age. Medical advice was sought after discharge for 15 (4%) children, 3 of whom required a visit to the emergency department for excessive or prolonged sedation. Each of these children had received CH as a sole sedative in recommended doses (61-77 mg/kg). In 1 of these cases, the procedure had been aborted because of inadequate sedation in the hospital, yet the child became difficult to arouse at home. Only 48% of children returned to baseline activity and behavior within 8 hours of the procedure; however, 89% were back to baseline status within 24 hours. Notably, 5% of all children did not return to baseline activity until the second day after the procedure. Although not statistically significant, infants <12 months old experienced delayed recovery (ie, >/=24 hours) more frequently compared with older c",

    "12": "The partial allosteric modulators (PAMs) of gamma-aminobutyric acid-gated Cl(-) current intensities at gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors have high affinity but low intrinsic efficacy on benzodiazepine recognition sites. Unlike the full allosteric modulators (FAM), like alprazolam, triazolam, and diazepam, PAMs are virtually devoid of unwanted side effects, including tolerance. Imidazenil (IMD) is a PAM that elicits potent anxiolytic and anticonvulsant actions in rodents and nonhuman primates and retains its anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects, even in rodents that are tolerant to FAMs. IMD antagonizes the side effects of FAMs in rodents and nonhuman primates. Using patas monkeys and a multiple schedule with repeated acquisition and performance of chain responses, we report that IMD administration for 17 days antagonized without showing tolerance ALP-induced disruption of acquisition.", 
    "13": "The circadian activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is regulated by caloric flow in rats. During the dark cycle, it has been shown that, in fasted rats, the time-course profile of plasma concentrations of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and corticosterone parallels the profile of food intake in ad libitum fed animals. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is involved in regulating food intake in rodents. CCK-8 reduces food intake by acting on CCK-A receptors subtype. This work aims at establishing an eventual relationship between the modulatory role of CCK on food intake and its effect on HPA axis activity during fasting. We studied the effect of CCK-A and CCK-B receptor antagonists on food intake during the first period of the dark cycle. Under these conditions we observed that the CCK-A receptor antagonist, SR-27897 (0.3 mg kg(-1)), but not the CCK-B receptor antagonist, L-365260 (1 mg kg(-1)), increases food-intake. In a second series of experiments we observed that the increase of both ACTH and corticosterone plasma level elicited by fasting, was prevented by SR-27897, but not by L-365260. These results indicate that CCK-A receptor blockade during fasting prevents the activation of the HPA axis.",

    "15": "Four new antipsychotic medications--clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine--have been introduced in the United States during the past decade. These new medications now account for the majority of antipsychotic prescriptions. The author reviews specific issues related to the use of traditional antipsychotic medications and then highlights the emerging clinical research data regarding the new medications, which have all been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of schizophrenia. Clinical research data indicate that they are also more useful for a broader array of symptoms associated with schizophrenia than traditional compounds. Furthermore, movement disorder side effects are substantially decreased--a property that leads to higher acceptability. Surprisingly, there has been little relationship between the pivotal trials designed for FDA approval and current dosing strategies in broader clinical settings. These dosing issues are described. New uses, including treatment of mood disorders and conduct disorder, are also discussed. These medicines offer substantial hope for improved treatment of schizophrenia.",

Both anorexic patients had a chronic illness and had failed multiple other treatments. Olanzapine administration was associated with weight gain and maintenance as well as reduced agitation and resistance to treatment. These case histories support further exploration of this class of drugs in anorexia nervosa.", 
    "17": "A huge number of natural and synthetic compounds modulate the function of the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAA-R) by interacting with several allosteric binding sites which may differ in the various GABAA-R subtypes. The benzodiazepine receptor (BDZ-R) is the most intensively studied allosteric site. It is the first allosteric modulatory site on a neurotransmitter receptor that has been found to mediate two opposite functions: facilitation and depression of GABAA-R function. The effects of BDZ-R ligands on behavior range from agonistic (anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, myore-laxant/ataxic and hypno-sedative effects) to inverse-agonistic (anxiety and panic, hypervigilance and convulsions). Of particular interest for the future are BDZ-R partial agonists, as they lack several of the undesired properties of classic full agonists. Furthermore the GABAA-R system shows a high plasticity. This polymorphism raises the possibility that ligands selective for distinct subtypes of BDZ-R may emerge as useful drugs. In both cases the possibility exists of achieving very subtle manipulations of GABAA-R function by using allosteric modulators.", 
    "18": "Sterile cultivated plant cell tissues and cell regenerates of several species were tested for their binding affinity to the central human benzodiazepine receptor. Binding activity was found in extracts of Artemisia dracunculus cell tissue (IC(50) = 7 microg/ml) and, to a lesser extent, in plant regenerates of potato herb (Solanum tuberosum). Preparative HPLC led to the isolation of fractions with a significant displacing potency in the benzodiazepine receptor binding assay. Using on-line HPLC-electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) in the \"selected reaction monitoring\" (SRM) mode, delorazepam and temazepam were found in amounts of about 100 to 200 ng/g cell tissue of Artemisia dracunculus, whereas sterile potato herb contained temazepam and diazepam ranging approximately from 70 to 450 ng/g cell tissue. It is the first report on the endogenous formation of benzodiazepines by plant cells, as any interaction of microorganisms and environmental factors was excluded.", 
    "19": "Rate equations for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and release and plasma membrane Ca2+ transport were determined from the measured fluxes in the preceding study and incorporated into a model of Ca2+ dynamics. It was asked if the measured fluxes are sufficient to account for the [Ca2+]i recovery kinetics after depolarization-evoked [Ca2+]i elevations. Ca2+ transport across the plasma membrane was described by a parallel extrusion/leak system, while the rates of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and release were represented using equations like those describing Ca2+ transport by isolated mitochondria. Taken together, these rate descriptions account very well for the time course of recovery after [Ca2+]i elevations evoked by weak and strong depolarization and their differential sensitivity to FCCP, CGP 37157, and [Na+]i. The model also leads to three general conclusions about mitochondrial Ca2+ transport in intact cells: (1) mitochondria are expected to accumulate Ca2+ even in response to stimuli that raise [Ca2+]i only slightly above resting levels; (2) there are two qualitatively different stimulus regimes that parallel the buffering and non-buffering modes of Ca2+ transport by isolated mitochondria that have been described previously; (3) the impact of mitochondrial Ca2+ transport on intracellular calcium dynamics is strongly influenced by nonmitochondrial Ca2+ transport; in particular, the magnitude of the prolonged [Ca2+]i elevation that occurs during the plateau phase of recovery is related to the Ca2+ set-point described in studies of isolated mitochondria, but is a property of mitochondrial Ca2+ transport in a cellular context. Finally, the model resolves the paradoxical finding that stimulus-induced [Ca2+]i elevations as small as approximately 300 nM increase intramitochondrial total Ca2+ concentration, but the steady [Ca2+]i elevations evoked by such stimuli are not influenced by FCCP.", 
    "20": "We studied how mitochondrial Ca2+ transport influences [Ca2+](i) dynamics in sympathetic neurons. Cells were treated with thapsigargin to inhibit Ca2+ accumulation by SERCA pumps and depolarized to elevate [Ca2+(i); the recovery that followed repolarization was then examined. The total Ca2+ flux responsible for the [Ca2+](i) recovery was separated into mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial components based on sensitivity to the proton ionophore FCCP, a selective inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca2+ transport in these cells. The nonmitochondrial flux, representing net Ca2+ extrusion across the plasma membrane, has a simple dependence on [Ca2+](i), while the net mitochondrial flux (J(mito)) is biphasic, indicative of Ca+) accumulation during the initial phase of recovery when [Ca2+](i) is high, and net Ca2+ release during later phases of recovery. During each phase, mitochondrial Ca2+ transport has distinct effects on recovery kinetics. J(mito) was separated into components representing mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and release based on sensitivity to the specific mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca2+ exchange inhibitor, CGP 37157 (CGP). The CGP-resistant (uptake) component of J(mito) increases steeply with [Ca2+](i), as expected for transport by the mitochondrial uniporter. The CGP-sensitive (release) component is inhibited by lowering the intracellular Na(+) concentration and depends on both intra- and extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration, as expected for the Na(+)/Ca2+ exchanger. Above approximately 400 nM [Ca2+](i), net mitochondrial Ca2+ transport is dominated by uptake and is largely insensitive to CGP. When [Ca2+](i) is approximately 200-300 nM, the net mitochondrial flux is small but represents the sum of much larger uptake and release fluxes that largely cancel. Thus, mitochondrial Ca2+ transport occurs in situ at much lower concentrations than previously thought, and may provide a mechanism for quantitative control of ATP production after brief or low frequency stimuli that raise [Ca(2+)](i) to levels below approximately 500 nM.", 
    "21": "The direct impact of ethanol on native, non-NMDA glutamate receptors was examined in acutely isolated MS/DB neurons from rat. The impact of ethanol functional tolerance and physical dependence on non-NMDA receptor function was also determined. Non-NMDA receptors were defined pharmacologically as predominantly the AMPA subtype, because both AMPA- or kainate-activated currents were blocked by GYKI 52466, a selective AMPA receptor antagonist. The relative magnitude of potentiation of AMPA-activated currents by 10 or 100 microM cyclothiazide was consistent with recombinant AMPA flop-subtype receptors. Finally, the selective kainate receptor agonist, SYM 8021, induced little current in MS/DB neurons. AMPA receptor currents when activated by kainate were sensitive to ethanol, showing inhibition of approximately 5 - 50% when 10 - 300 mM ethanol and kainate were briefly co-applied (3 s). Ethanol (100 mM) also inhibited both the initial transient peak and sustained currents activated by AMPA. Inhibition was sustained during continuous ethanol superfusions of 5 min, suggesting a lack of acute tolerance to ethanol-induced AMPA receptor blockade. Rapid application of 3 - 3000 microM kainate activated concentration-dependent currents in MS/DB neurons from Control and Ethanol Dependent animals that were not significantly different. Also, direct ethanol inhibition (300 mM) of kainate-activated currents was not reduced by ethanol dependence, suggesting a lack of functional tolerance. These results suggest that native AMPA receptors on MS/DB neurons are inhibited by pharmacologically-relevant concentrations of ethanol. However, these receptors, unlike NMDA receptors, do not undergo adaptation with sustained ethanol exposure sufficient to induce physical dependence.

    "22": "Benzodiazepines (BZDs), barbiturates, ethanol, and general anesthetics potentiate the action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the type A GABA receptor (GABA(A)R) and have profound effects on mood, arousal, and susceptibility to seizures. GABA(A)R number and subunit mRNA levels change in animal models of epilepsy and anxiety and following exposure to GABA(A)R agonists and positive modulators, but the mechanism of receptor down-regulation remains unknown. Persistent exposure (48 h) of brain neurons in primary culture to GABA results in a 30% decrease in the levels of mRNA encoding the alpha1, beta2S, and gamma1 GABA(A)R subunit isoforms, which form a receptor enhanced by nonselective BZDs. Down-regulation of alpha1 mRNA (t1/2 = 8 h) precedes down-regulation of receptor number (t1/2 = 25 h), suggesting that GABA-induced GABA(A)R down-regulation is a consequence of decreased mRNA levels. The apparent half-life of the alpha1 mRNA in the presence of alpha-amanitin (9 h) is consistent with the time course of alpha1 mRNA down-regulation. Moreover, the stability of the alpha1, beta2S, and gamma1 subunit mRNAs is not altered by chronic GABA exposure. The results demonstrate that GABA(A)R subunit mRNA down-regulation is not a consequence of accelerated mRNA degradation and argue that GABA-induced GABA(A)R down-regulation is due to inhibition of transcription.", 
    "23": "Exposure of rat cerebellar granule cells cultured to maturity in vitro to forskolin, N6,2'-O-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (Bt2cAMP), and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) down-regulated GABA(A) receptor alpha6 and beta3 subunits but up-regulated alpha1 and beta2 subunits with respect to vehicle-treated controls. Dideoxyforskolin had no effect on subunit expression. Protein kinase A inhibitors, H-89 and Rp-adenosine 3',5'cyclic monophosphothioate, prevented these effects on alpha1 but not alpha6 subunit expression. Flunitrazepam-sensitive [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites were increased by 144 +/- 20% following forskolin treatment. [3H]Ro 15-4513 photoaffinity labelling showed that the GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit was the principal locus of the increased flunitrazepam-sensitive [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding. Forskolin decreased flunitrazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites by 25 +/- 8% and resulted in a 20% decrease in the irreversible incorporation of radioactivity in the alpha6 subunit. Steady-state levels of GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNAs were determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR in forskolin-treated cultures. Forskolin, Bt2cAMP, and IBMX down-regulated GABA(A) receptor alpha6 subunit mRNA expression; alpha1 and beta3 mRNA levels were unaffected, whereas beta2 subunit mRNA was up-regulated. Dideoxyforskolin had no significant effect on alpha1, alpha6, beta2, and beta3 mRNA levels. Thus, in mature cerebellar granule cells, GABA(A) receptor expression can be regulated by intracellular cyclic AMP levels. This occurs at the level of gene transcription and/or translation by mechanisms that are only partially governed by protein kinase A.", 
    "24": "We compared the effects of handling or maternal separation from the day following birth until postnatal day 14 on behavioral responses to novelty and on GABAA and central benzodiazepine (CBZ) receptor levels in the rat. As adults, handled animals showed reduced startle responsivity, increased exploration in a novel open field, and decreased novelty-induced suppression of feeding relative to the handled (H) and/or maternal separation (MS) groups. As compared with handled animals, both nonhandled (NH) and MS animals displayed: (1) reduced GABAA receptor levels in the locus coeruleus (LC) and the n. tractus solitarius (NTS); (2) reduced CBZ receptor sites in the central and lateral n. of the amygdala, the frontal cortex, and in the LC and NTS; and (3) reduced levels of the mRNA for the gamma 2 subunit of the GABAA receptor complex, which confers high affinity BZ binding, in the amygdaloid nuclei as well as in the LC and NTS. Both the amygdala and the ascending noradrenergic systems have been considered as critical sites for the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines. These data suggest that early life events influence the development of the GABAA receptor system, thus altering the expression of fearfulness in adulthood.",

Patients receiving midazolam reported remembering significantly less about their operation than controls (p = 0.04) and showed significantly lower state-anxiety after their operation than before (p < 0.02). This change was not noted in the placebo group. There was no significant difference in the psychomotor performance of patients given midazolam compared with controls 2 h after surgery.",

Four treatments were compared: dextropropoxyphene napsylate 100 mg, morphine sulphate 10 mg, lorazepam 0.5 mg and placebo. Four doses of each drug were given at 4-h intervals to each subject on four separate study days at least 1 week apart. Cognitive function was assessed using choice reaction time, number vigilance, memory scanning, immediate and delayed word recall, word recognition, picture recognition, critical flicker fusion threshold (CFFT) and subjective measures of alertness, calmness and contentment. Lorazepam impaired the speed of responding on all tasks in which speed was recorded (except digit vigilance) and increased subjective ratings of calmness. Morphine had one major effect, which was to increase the accuracy of responding on the choice reaction time task, at every assessment. Morphine produced some sporadic effects in other tests and an increase in subjective calmness. Dextropropoxyphene impaired performance on choice reaction time and picture recognition. These data show that oral morphine may enhance performance in some measures of cognitive function, whereas dextropropoxyphene (in usual therapeutic doses) seems more likely to cause impairment. Neither opioid has substantial effects on cognition and psychomotor function compared with lorazepam.", 
    "30": "Despite widespread use of adjunctive benzodiazepines during ketamine sedation, their efficacy in reducing recovery agitation in children has never been studied. We wished to characterize the nature and severity of recovery agitation after ketamine sedation in children treated in the emergency department and to determine whether the addition of adjunctive midazolam reduces the magnitude of such recovery agitation.", 
    "31": "The study was a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial of adjunctive midazolam versus placebo during ketamine sedation. We enrolled 104 children aged 12 months to 15 years (median age, 6 years) at a combined university medical center and children's hospital. Subjects received either intravenous midazolam (0.05 mg/kg up to 2 mg) or placebo after intravenous administration of a ketamine loading dose (1.5 mg/kg). Treating physicians and nurses independently noted the presence of crying, hallucinations, and nightmares during recovery and graded recovery agitation by using a 100-mm visual analog scale. Preprocedure agitation and external stimulation during recovery were also graded. The time from ketamine injection until each subject met the recovery criteria was recorded.", 
    "32": "Fifty-three subjects received midazolam, and 51 received placebo. Potentially confounding variables were similar between the groups. Sedation efficacy, adverse effects, and recovery time were also similar between groups. Interobserver agreement between physician and nurse assessments was substantial. Median physician assessment of recovery agitation was 4 mm (interquartile range, 2 to 19) in the midazolam group and 5 mm (interquartile range, 3 to 14) in the placebo group (difference -1; 95% confidence interval -3 to 2; P =.705). Recovery agitation was moderately correlated with preprocedure agitation (rho=0.486) but not with external stimulation during recovery (rho=0.147).", 
    "33": "Recovery agitation is common but generally of very low magnitude after ketamine sedation in children in the ED. We observed a median physician rating of 5 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale, a score that we believe to be clinically insignificant. The degree of recovery agitation after ketamine sedation is significantly related to the degree of preprocedure agitation. In this study, concurrent midazolam did not diminish such agitation and had no measurably beneficial effect. Use of adjunctive benzodiazepines in pediatric ketamine sedation appears unnecessary.",

Midazolam was the most potent inhibitor of nucleoside transporter (ventricle:pKi = 5.22+/-0.41, Ki = 6 microM). In isolated hearts, midazolam (5, 10, 20 microM) significantly augmented coronary flow in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of adenosine (30 nM), an effect reversed by ZM 241385, a selective A2A-receptor antagonist. In contrast, midazolam did not increase the effect of adenosine (30 nM) on atrioventricular conduction. Similarly, midazolam potentiated A2A- but not A1-receptor-mediated effects of endogenous adenosine released during hypoxia.",

    "39": "The effects of midazolam on either electrically evoked or spontaneous inhibitory transmission and on a response to exogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a GABA(A)-receptor agonist, muscimol, or glycine were evaluated in substantia gelatinosa neurons of adult rat spinal cord slices by using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique.", 
    "40": "Bath-applied midazolam (1 microM) prolonged the decay phase of evoked and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), mediated by GABA(A) receptors, without a change in amplitudes, while not affecting glycine receptor-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents in both the decay phase and the amplitude. Either GABA- or muscimol-induced currents were enhanced in amplitude by midazolam (0.1 microM) in a manner sensitive to a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil (1 microM); glycine currents were, however, unaltered by midazolam.", 
    "41": "Midazolam augmented both the duration of GABA-mediated synaptic current and the amplitude of GABA-induced current by acting on the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor in substantia gelatinosa neurons; this would increase the inhibitory GABAergic transmission. This may be a possible mechanism for antinociception by midazolam.",

Continuous video electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring with surface or intracranial electrodes was used to evaluate interictal EEG activity, ictal discharges, and the occurrence and semiology of clinically manifest epileptic seizures.", 
    "44": "Interictal epileptiform potentials did not change in frequency or distribution after FMZ. In patients not pretreated with BZDs, epileptic seizures could not be provoked. In eight of the 49 patients pretreated with BZDs, epileptic seizures occurred within 30 min of FMZ application.

Felbamate (FBM; 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg), dizepam (DZP; 10 mg/kg), or phenytoin (PHT; 50 mg/kg) were injected i.v. 10 min after SSSE induction.

Total time spent in seizures after FBM and 290 +/- 251 min (50 mg/kg), 15.3 +/- 9 min (100 mg/kg), and 7 +/- 1 min (200 mg/kg), whereas control animals spent 410 +/- 133 min seizing. This effect of FBM was stronger than that of DZP (10 mg/kg, 95 +/- 22 min) and comparable to that of PHT (50 mg/kg, 6.3 +/- 2.5 min). In the applied doses, FBM (200 mg/kg) was more effective than PHT (50 mg/kg) or DZP (10 mg/kg) in shortening seizure duration and decreasing spike frequency, when administered on the pleateau of SSSE (injection 40 min after the end of PPS). Anticonvulsant action of FBM was confirmed by milder neuronal injury compared with control animals.", 
    "49": "Felbamate, a clinically available AED with a moderate affinity for the glycine site of the NMDA receptor, displayed a potent seizure-protective effect in an animal model of SSSE.

    "50": "A new in vitro model for ethanol-induced gastric damage is described. The stomach was dissected from the rat, a polyethylene cannula introduced into the remnants of the esophagus, and the pyloric end tied off. With the cardiac and pyloric regions of the stomach secured by thread to a vertical glass rod or tube, the whole was suspended in an organ bath containing aerated Krebs solution. Fifteen minutes later, ethanol was introduced via the esophageal cannula. After an additional 60 min, the stomach was removed from the Krebs solution, opened along the mid line, and the lesions studied. Comparisons were made with a conventional in vivo model. Results show that the lesion number, length, and total lesion area obtained by the in vitro model were comparable to those obtained in the older in vivo model. Histopathologically, lesions induced by both models were also comparable. Clonazepam, a drug previously used in the in vivo model, was tested in this model. Results indicate that clonazpam protected against ethanol-induced gastric damage in vitro. The new model provides a method to study the action of drugs on the stomach alone and to exclude in indirect actions of drugs via other sites in the body.", 
    "51": "The sharp interruption of the intracortical instillation of exogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), generates an epileptic focus in mammals. Seizures elicited by GABA withdrawal last several days or weeks. The present work reports that GABA withdrawal-induced hyperexcitability can be produced in vitro: a sudden withdrawal of GABA (5 mM; 120 min) or benzodiazepine (60 microM flunitrazepam) from the superfusion, induced a gradual increase in the amplitude of the evoked population spike (PS) recorded on neocortical slices. PS enhancement reached 150% above the control value 2.5 h after GABA withdrawal. GABA withdrawal-induced hyperexcitability was facilitated by progesterone. PS enhancement induced by GABA withdrawal was associated with an impairment of GABA transmission occurring before epileptiform discharges were fully established. Paired pulse inhibition and evoked [3H]-GABA release appear decreased; suggesting that cortical hyperexcitability as a result of GABA withdrawal involves pre-synaptic changes. Specific muscimol binding decreased during GABA superfusion but recovered after GABA withdrawal. However, the sensitivity of the post-synaptic response to 3alpha-OH-5alpha-pregnan-20-one or allopregnanolone (alloP) was enhanced after GABA withdrawal, suggesting a functional change in the GABA(A) receptors. The changes described may be the cellular correlates of the withdrawal syndromes appearing after interruption of the administration of GABA(A) receptor agonists.", 
    "52": "Olanzapine (Zyprexa), a neuroleptic, has obtained marketing authorization for treatment of schizophrenia. The clinical file is satisfactory, but in the absence of relevant trials, it has not yet been demonstrated that olanzapine has a specific activity on the positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The global efficacy of olanzapine was not substantially different from that of haloperidol in two of the three comparative trials published to date. The only relevant comparative trial fails to demonstrate the superiority of olanzapine over risperidone. Olanzapine has fewer adverse neurologic effects than haloperidol, but there is no evidence that it differs from other recent neuroleptics in this respect. Olanzapine can have anticholinergic adverse effects and frequently causes weight gain. Active surveillance is required because subclinical cases of elevated transaminase levels, increased blood pressure, and QT prolongation were observed in clinical trials (2500 patients treated).",

The slow small fall in [Mg2+]i on Ca2+ depletion and a rapid recovery on Ca2+ repletion were unaffected by ruthenium red, clonazepam, CGP-37157 or cyclosporin A. A delayed sustained larger rise in [Mg2+]i was inhibited. The marked sustained fall in NADH autofluorescence that occurs on Ca2+ overload was attenuated and transient in the presence of ruthenium red, CGP-37157 and cyclosporin A.",

    "57": "The efficacy of trazodone and clorazepate to relieve anxiety and depressive symptoms in 21 HIV-positive subjects with adjustment disorders was determined in a 28-day single-centre, randomized, double-blind study. Subjects were evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Revised Symptom Checklist, the European Organization for Research and the Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, and a binary criterion based on the Clinical Global Impression. The incidence of successful treatment was 80% for trazodone compared with 64% for clorazepate; the sample number was too small to establish a significant difference. Bayesian analysis revealed the probability of making a wrong decision in prescribing trazodone rather than clorazepate reduced from 35% to 18% in this small sample. Clinical evaluations using the different scales suggest some benefit from trazodone, although this was not significant. Safety of both treatments was similar. Trazodone is devoid of the risk of abuse and dependence, and may be a valuable alternative to benzodiazepines for the treatment of HIV-related adjustment disorders.", 
    "58": "The recent introduction of several antipsychotic medications has raised expectations for better pharmacological management of schizophrenia. Although conventional and new neuroleptics (Risperidone, Olanzapine, Seroquel and soon to be released Ziprasidone) are generally comparable in terms of efficacy; the new antipsychotic medications possess a better side-effects profile and are overall, much better tolerated. The reintroduction of Clozapine as an effective antipsychotic for treatment refractoriness has also improved management for a segment of the schizophrenic population who failed to respond adequately to other antipsychotic medications. Such increased benefits from new antipsychotic medications come with a higher acquisition cost that has somewhat strained the historically low psychiatric budgets. The question then was whether the expected benefits of the new antipsychotics can offset the high cost of these medications in the long-term. In that context, quality of life assessment has provided a tool for the comparative analysis of new and conventional antipsychotic medications, particularly regarding their impact on functional status and satisfaction. In a recently concluded study, we demonstrated that the new antipsychotic medications are subjectively much better tolerated and have a more favourable impact on quality of life compared with conventional neuroleptics. The ultimate question is whether such favourable benefits can translate in the future into better compliance with medications and improved long-term outcomes.", 
    "59": "In order to study the influence of hair bleaching on benzodiazepines concentrations, hair was treated with a bleaching product (Poly Blonde, Schwarzkopf & Henkel) for 20 min. The treated hair specimen was obtained from a person who died after an overdose of several illicit drugs associated with benzodiazepines. Bleached and non bleached hair were washed (acetone and water), pulverised and then incubated for 2 h in a thioglycolic solution. In the extracts obtained by solid-phase extraction on C18 columns, the different drugs with the corresponding deuterated standards were derivatized and determined by GC-MS in a SIM mode. These results show that the concentrations of all the drug detected decreased in bleached hair in comparison with non treated hair. Whereas the diminution was less important for cocaine and benzoylecgonine (decrease of 24.6 and 36.4%, respectively), concentrations for codeine, 6-monoacetylmorphine and morphine decreased more significantly (decrease of 57.5, 88.6 and 67.4%, respectively) as well as those of diazepam, nordazepam and 7-aminoflunitrazepam (decrease of 39.7, 67.7 and 61.8%, respectively). The results in this study agree with those of other authors that bleaching affects the stability of cocaine and opiates incorporated in hair. These findings also point out that bleaching influences the stability of entrapped benzodiazepines in hair. Finally, these results reconfirm that it is very important to consider the cosmetic history of a hair sample in the interpretation of hair analysis results.", 
    "60": "Antipsychotic drugs are very useful in treatment of psychosis and severe agitation in the elderly. Their use for other behavioral problems is contraindicated. Antipsychotics have many potential side effects (e.g., sedation, cardiovascular effects, anticholinergic effects, incontinence, reduced appetite, such motor disturbances as drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, TD). Prevention, by using the minimum dose and duration of treatment possible, is the key to managing motor side effects. If prevention fails, drug-induced parkinsonism and dystonia may improve with use of anticholinergics, and akathisia may improve with use of benzodiazepines or low-dose propranolol. There is no proven treatment for TD, which is most likely to be observed during dose reduction or after discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs. Compared with older agents, newer antipsychotic drugs are less likely to cause parkinsonism, akathisia, and dystonia and may cause TD less often. More research is needed to clarify use of the new drugs in the elderly.", 
    "61": "To evaluate the degree of drug-drug interaction concerning metabolic inhibition in the liver quantitatively, we tried to predict the plasma concentration increasing ratio (R) of midazolam (MDZ) by erythromycin (EM), diltiazem (DLZ), or verapamil (VER) in rats. MDZ was administered through the portal vein at the steady state of plasma concentration of these inhibitors. The R values in the area under the plasma concentration curve of MDZ in the presence of EM, DLZ, and VER were 2.02, 1.64, and 1.30, respectively. The liver to plasma unbound concentration ratios of EM, DLZ, and VER at the steady state after infusion were 20.8, 1.02, and 3.01, respectively, suggesting concentrative uptake of EM and VER into the liver. The predicted R value in the presence of EM calculated by use of plasma unbound concentration was 1.03, whereas the value calculated with liver unbound concentration was 1.61, which was very close to the observed value. These findings indicated the need to consider the concentrative uptake of inhibitors into the liver for the quantitative prediction of metabolic inhibition. However, the predicted values in the presence of DLZ or VER calculated by use of liver unbound concentration were still underestimated. This result may be due to the metabolic inhibition by the metabolites of both inhibitors. Therefore, when predicting the degree of metabolic inhibition quantitatively, the inhibitory effect by coadministered drugs and the disposition of these metabolites in the liver must also be considered.", 
    "62": "To study age-related changes in drug metabolism, we examined the in vitro biotransformation of midazolam (MDZ), a human cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A substrate, using liver microsomes from three age groups of male CD-1 mice ranging from 6 weeks to 2 years old. MDZ was metabolized to two major products, alpha-OH- and 4-OH-MDZ, which were quantified by HPLC. For both metabolites, V(max) values were reduced in old livers (P <.05), while K(m) values did not change with age. The net intrinsic clearance (the sum of V(max)/K(m) for both pathways) also was reduced in the old animals (P <.05). The capacity of ketoconazole, a CYP3A inhibitor in humans, to inhibit the biotransformation of MDZ and of alprazolam, another human CYP3A substrate, did not differ significantly with age. At 100 microM alprazolam, 0.5 microM ketoconazole inhibited metabolite formation by >80%. At 30 microM MDZ, 2.5 microM ketoconazole impaired 4-OH-MDZ formation by 88%, whereas it reduced alpha-OH-MDZ formation by only 46%. Immunoinhibition studies with polyclonal anti-rat CYP3A1/2 and CYP2C11 antibodies confirmed that 4-OH-MDZ formation was largely CYP3A-dependent, while alpha-OH-MDZ formation was mediated by CYP3A and -2C isoforms. Western blot analysis revealed decreased microsomal content of CYP3A in old livers. Net intrinsic clearance of MDZ was correlated with total CYP3A content (P <.001). These results demonstrate a reduction in MDZ biotransformation in old male mice, which may be attributable, in part, to decreased CYP3A content in old livers. Changes in expression and activity of CYP2C isoforms also may contribute to age-related changes in MDZ biotransformation, but this requires more investigation.", 
    "63": "Peripheral muscarinic receptors play key roles in the control of heart rate and smooth muscle activity. In this study, bradycardic and smooth muscle contractile responses to the muscarinic agonist carbamylcholine were compared in isolated tissues from M(2) and M(4) muscarinic receptor knockout mice and their wild-type littermates. Carbamylcholine (1 x 10(-8)-3 x 10(-5) M) produced similar concentration-dependent bradycardia in spontaneously beating atria from M(4) receptor knockout and wild-type control mice. In contrast, carbamylcholine did not produce bradycardia in atria derived from M(2) receptor knockout mice, whereas such atria were responsive to adenosine-induced bradycardia. Carbamylcholine-induced contractile responses were similar in stomach fundus, urinary bladder, and tracheal preparations from M(4) receptor knockout mice and their wild-type littermates for each tissue (-logEC(50) values ranging from 6.20 +/- 0.10 to 6.76 +/- 0.08), suggesting that M(4) receptors do not participate in smooth muscle contraction in these tissues. In contrast, approximately 2-fold higher carbamylcholine concentration was required for contraction of stomach fundus, urinary bladder, and trachea from M(2) receptor knockout mice (-logEC(50) = 6.39 +/- 0.05, 6.07 +/- 0.06, and 6.27 +/- 0.12, respectively) than from wild-type littermates (-logEC(50) = 6.68 +/- 0.07, 6.27 +/- 0.07, and 6.56 +/- 0.06, respectively). Furthermore, the affinity of the M(2) \"selective\" receptor antagonist AF-DX116 in inhibiting carbamylcholine-induced smooth muscle contraction was significantly reduced in M(2) receptor knockout mice compared with tissues from wild-type littermates. Collectively, these results provide direct and unambiguous evidence that M(2) receptors mediate muscarinic receptor-induced bradycardia and play a role in smooth muscle contractility, whereas M(4) receptors are not involved in stomach fundus, urinary bladder, or tracheal contractility.", 
    "64": "A crucial characteristic of antipsychotic medication is the occupancy of the dopamine (DA) D2 receptor. We assessed striatal DA D2 receptor occupancy by olanzapine and risperidone in 36 young patients [31 males, 5 females; mean age 21.1 years (16-28)] with first episode schizophrenia, using [123I]iodobenzamide (IBZM) SPECT. The occupancy of DA D2 receptors was not significantly different between olanzapine and risperidone. However, in subgroups of most prescribed doses, DA D2 occupancy was higher in the risperidone 4-mg group (79%) compared to the olanzapine 15-mg group (62%). [123I]IBZM binding ratios decreased with olanzapine dose (r = -0.551; P < 0.01), indicating higher DA D2 receptor occupancy with higher olanzapine dose. Akathisia and positive symptoms were correlated with [123I]IBZM binding ratio (r = -0.442; P < 0.01; and r = -0.360; P < 0.05, respectively). Prolactin (PRL) levels were elevated in the risperidone, but not in the olanzapine group, at comparable D2 receptor occupancy levels. In the olanzapine group, PRL levels were correlated with [123I]IBZM binding ratio (r = -0.551; P < 0.01). In conclusion, both olanzapine and risperidone induce a high striatal D2 receptor occupancy, dependent on dose and group formation. The lower incidence of prolactin elevation with olanzapine, compared to risperidone, may not be attributed to a lower D2 receptor occupancy.",

Patients obtained the degree of sedation they required to undergo the operation by pressing the button independently of the dose or incremental interval.

    "70": "Three alkaloid fractions were obtained from seeds of Erythrina americana: free alkaloids in hexane, free alkaloids in methanol and liberated alkaloids. The pharmacological evaluation of these fractions on rats showed that, administered in a dose of 3 mg/kg, the three fractions diminished the aggressive behavior. This is comparable when diazepam is used as a control. An interaction between the cholinergic and GABAergic system could be suggested.", 
    "71": "Since 1992, we have used hypnosis routinely in more than 1400 procedures in plastic surgery. Our clinical success and experience with this technique led us to test wether hypnosis using active patient collaboration, could be used as an effective adjunct to conscious intravenous sedation (\"hypnosedation\", (HS)) for endocrine surgery, as an alternative to general anaesthesia. On a total of 1905 cervical endocrine surgical procedures performed between 1995 and 1998, 296 thyroidectomies and 33 cervical explorations for hyperparathyroidism were conducted under HS. Conversion to GA was needed in three cases (0.9%). All patients having HS reported a very pleasant experience and had significantly less postoperative pain while analgesic use was significantly reduced in this group. Hospital stay was also significantly shorter, providing a substantial reduction of the costs of medical care. The postoperative convalescence was significantly improved after HS and full return to social or professional activity was significantly shortened. We conclude that HS is a very efficient technique that provide physiological, psychological and economic benefits to the patient.", 
    "72": "Thalamocortical spike-and-wave discharges characterize the nonconvulsive absence seizures that occur spontaneously in genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), a selected strain of Wistar rats. GABA is crucial in the generation of absence seizures. The susceptibility to convulsions induced by threshold doses of various GABA receptor antagonists and inhibitors of GABA synthesis, kainic acid and strychnine, was compared in GAERS and in nonepileptic rats from a selected control strain (NE). The brain structures involved in the drug-elicited convulsive seizures were mapped by c-Fos immunohistochemistry. Injection of various antagonists of the GABA(A) receptor, bicuculline and picrotoxin, and inverse agonists of the benzodiazepine site (FG 7142 and DMCM) induced myoclonic spike-and-wave discharges followed by clonic or tonic-clonic seizures with high paroxysmal activity on the cortical EEG. The incidence of the convulsions was dose-dependent and was higher in GAERS than in NE rats. Mapping of c-Fos expression showed that the frontoparietal cortex was constantly involved in the convulsive seizures elicited by a threshold convulsant dose, whereas limbic participation was variable. In contrast, GAERS were less susceptible than NE rats to the tonic-clonic convulsions induced by the inhibitors of glutamate decarboxylase, isoniazide and 3-mercaptopropionic acid. The GABA(B) receptor antagonist CGP 56999 and kainic acid induced a similar incidence of seizures in GAERS and NE rats and predominantly activated the hippocampus. No difference in the tonic seizures elicited by strychnine could be evidenced between the strains. These results suggest that an abnormal cortical GABAergic activity may underlie absence seizures in GAERS.", 
    "73": "In human brain, nonartherosclerotic calcification is associated with normal aging and several pathological conditions without any clear significance. In all situations, calcification appears predominantly in the basal ganglia, but is also frequent in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. alpha-Amino-(3-hydroxi-5-methyl-4-isoxazol-4-il)-propionic acid-induced lesion of the globus pallidus is associated in rats with the formation of calcium deposits similar to those observed in the human brain. To determine whether direct neuronal activation may induce calcification, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) was microinjected in rat hippocampus, globus pallidus, and lateral prefrontal cortex. Two months later, neuronal death was associated with calcium deposits that were characterized in terms of distribution and size. A unique population of deposits was present in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, whereas in the globus pallidus two main groups could be differentiated. Calcification was always associated with a significant microglial reaction as shown by the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor autoradiography. Monoamine oxidase B autoradiography, reflecting the astroglial reaction, was also significantly increased. Our results provide evidence that acute NMDA neuronal activation leads with time to calcification associated with a glial reaction and indicate that nonartherosclerotic calcification in the human brain may develop from an acute NMDA receptor activation. A key role of the metabotropic mGluR1 receptor is also suggested.", 
    "74": "The acute effects of systemic administration of the antipsychotic drug, zotepine, on extracellular dopamine (DA) in the frontal cortex of freely-moving rats were studied using in vivo microdialysis and compared with the actions of clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol. Treatment with zotepine (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) resulted in a prolonged elevation of cortical DA levels for up to 180 min post-drug. A maximal rise of +333% was observed at 120 min post-zotepine treatment. Clozapine (10.0 mg/kg, i.p.) also evoked a rise in extracellular DA which was similar in duration (200 min) to that resulting from treatment with zotepine. A maximal rise of +223% was observed at 100 min post-clozapine treatment. Olanzapine (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) resulted in an immediate increase in DA levels which was maximal 40 min post-treatment (+280%) with levels returning to pre-injection values by 100 min after dosing. In contrast, haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) had no measurable influence on cortical DA levels. Local perfusion with the NA uptake inhibitor, nisoxetine (10 microM), resulted in an increase in cortical DA levels which was maximal at 100 min post-onset of perfusion (+257% above baseline). Administration of zotepine (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) during nisoxetine perfusion elevated DA levels to a maximum of +301% above baseline, 60 min post-zotepine. These results show that acute administration of each of three drugs with an atypical antipsychotic profile causes an elevation of cortical DA in freely-moving rats at doses relevant to those derived from animal models which predict antipsychotic activity. As a dysfunction in cortical DA is thought to be involved in both the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and cognitive deficits in schizophrenic patients, it is possible that zotepine's ability to elevate cortical DA levels may underlie its effectiveness in successfully treating these components of schizophrenia. Furthermore, the ability of zotepine to elevate cortical DA is more likely to derive from its inhibition of the NA transporter rather than DA receptor blockade in this region.", 
    "75": "Because radioactive labeled ligands in receptor assays have several disadvantages, we synthesized a number of fluorescent-labeled benzodiazepines. Several fluorophores were attached at different positions of 1,4-benzodiazepine molecules in order to assess the impact of the fluorophores and their coupling position on the affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor. Besides the 1,4-benzodiazepines, the 1,2-annelated 1,4-benzodiazepines were also used for labeling. A metabolite of flumazenil (18), desethylflumazenil (Ro15-3890, 19), was labeled with the fluorophore 4-bromomethyl-7-methoxycoumarin, with and without the incorporation of a spacer chain, yielding the methyl-methoxycoumarin (Mmc) derivatives Mmc-Ro15-3890 (20a) and Mmc-O-CO-(CH2)3-Ro15-3890 (20b), respectively. After the synthesis, the fluorescent-labeled benzodiazepines were purified by HPLC, using an analytical RP-C18 column. For the purification of 20b, the chromatographic system was optimized, using multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques. The binding affinities for the benzodiazepine receptor and the fluorescence characteristics were determined for the resulting products.", 
    "76": "Ballota nigra is a European plant known for its neurosedative properties. In this study, the ability of five phenylpropanoids (verbascoside, forsythoside B, arenarioside, ballotetroside, and caffeoyl malic acid) isolated from a hydroalcoholic extract, to bind to benzodiazepine, dopaminergic, and morphinic receptors was investigated. To carry out these studies, affinity tests with rat striata, entire brains and receptor rich preparations were employed. In addition, the phenolic aspect of these five phenylpropanoid esters led to investigate antioxidant activities using cell-free experiments and cellular experiments including isolated polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). Effects of phenylpropanoid esters against reactive oxygen species as superoxide anion, peroxide hydrogen, hypochlorous acid and hydroxyl radical were tested. These molecules are liberated by PMN during inflammatory disorders, so that reproduction of this process in vitro stimulating PMN by chemical stimulants was undertaken. Results show that four of the five compounds are able to bind to the studied receptors. Inhibitory concentrations at 50% were determined and vary from 0.4 to 4.7 mg/ml. This may be in relation with the Ballota nigra known neurosedative activities. Results concerning antioxidant investigations evidence an ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species. Inhibitory concentrations at 50% obtained are comparable to those of known antioxidant drugs (mesna or N-acetyl cysteine). Moreover, the use of different stimuli having various pathways of action on PMN oxidative metabolism permits to establish that each phenylpropanoid ester has its own particular way of action by using proteine kinase C or phospholipase C pathways.", 
    "77": "The present study evaluated the effect of subchronic oral treatment of psychosocially stressed male tree shrews with diazepam on locomotor activity, marking behavior, avoidance behavior, and urinary cortisol and noradrenaline. To mimic a realistic situation of anxiolytic intervention, the treatment started 14 days after the beginning of psychosocial stress; at that time, the stress-induced behavioral and endocrine alterations had been established. The drug (5 mg/kg/day) was administered orally in the morning, while the psychosocial stress continued during the whole treatment period; the therapeutic action of diazepam treatment was followed across 7 days. Twenty-four hours after the last application serum concentrations of diazepam and its major metabolites were determined via HPLC. The results revealed concentrations of 7 ng/ml for diazepam, 106 ng/ml for nordiazepam, 22 ng/ml for temazepam, and 30 ng/ml for oxazepam. Treatment of subordinate animals with diazepam did not reveal a beneficial effect to any of the parameters studied. This contrasts to earlier findings showing that the behavioral and neuroendocrine alterations produced by this stress paradigm are sensitive to chronic treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine. The present results support the view that in male tree shrews the state induced by psychosocial stress might be more depression related than anxiety related.",

Some PIs 1 and abecarnil showed anticonvulsant properties against seizures induced by PTZ with a potency lower than that observed in audiogenic seizures. The pharmacological actions of 1d, 1f, and 1i were significantly reduced by a treatment with flumazenil (8.24 micromol/kg IP), suggesting a clear involvement of benzodiazepine mechanisms in the anticonvulsant activity of these compounds or their metabolites. The anticonvulsant activity of 1d, 1f, and 1i was also evaluated against seizures induced by two beta-carbolines namely methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) and methyl-6, 7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), in DBA/2 mice: they gave better protection against seizures induced by beta-CCM than the ones by DMCM. The potency of various BDZs and PIs as inhibitors of specific [3H]flumazenil binding to neuronal membranes, was also evaluated. The radioligand binding study, carried out on stable cell lines expressing definite combinations of benzodiazepine receptor subunits, demonstrated that 1b, 1e, 1d, and 1h have preferential interaction with alpha(1), beta(3), gamma(2), receptor subtypes.", 
    "79": "Naloxone has previously been shown to block the effects of benzodiazepines in the Swiss but not in the BALB/c strain. We have also reported that naloxone potentiates subeffective doses of benzodiazepines in Swiss mice. In the present studies we first determined whether naloxone could block anxiolytic-like effects of meprobamate in Swiss and BALB/c mice. Then we evaluated if subeffective doses of meprobamate could be potentiated in Swiss as well as in BALB/c mice. The elevated plus-maze test and the light/dark choice procedure were used. The lowest dose of meprobamate with anxiolytic-like effects was 60 mg/kg in the BALB/c mice. This dose was effective in both the plus-maze and in the light/dark choice procedure. In Swiss mice the same dose was effective in the plus-maze, whereas 120 mg/kg was required in the light/dark choice procedure. When an effective dose of meprobamate was combined with naloxone, 10 mg/kg, no blockade of anxiolytic-like effects was obtained in any strain in any procedure. To the contrary, when a subeffective dose of meprobamate was combined with naloxone, 10 mg/kg, an anxiolytic-like effect was obtained in both strains in both procedures. The present series of experiment shows that the ability of naloxone to block anxiolytic-like drug effects do not apply to meprobamate. However, the naloxone-induced potentiation of subeffective doses previously observed after treatment with benzodiazepines or buspirone was present also after treatment with meprobamate. Moreover, although blockade of anxiolytic-like drug effects with naloxone has not been observed in BALB/c mice, potentiation was as evident in that strain as in the Swiss. This suggests that the mechanisms behind naloxone's blockade of anxiolytic-like effects are independent from those behind its potentiation of such effects.", 
    "80": "In mammalian CNS, the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PTBR) is localized on the outer mitochondrial membrane within the astrocytes and microglia. PTBR transports cholesterol to the site of neurosteroid biosynthesis. Several neurodegenerative disorders were reported to be associated with increased densities of PTBR. In the present study, we evaluated the changes in the PTBR density and gene expression in the brains of rats as a function of time (6 h to 14 days) after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Sham-operated rats served as control. Between 3 and 14 days after TBI, there was a significant increased in the binding of PTBR antagonist [(3)H]PK11195 (by 106 to 185%, P < 0.01, as assessed by quantitative autoradiography and in vitro filtration binding) and PTBR mRNA expression (by 2- to 3. 4-fold, P < 0.01, as assessed by RT-PCR) in the ipsilateral thalamus. At 14 days after the injury, the neuronal number decreased significantly (by 85 to 90%, P < 0.01) in the ipsilateral thalamus. At the same time point, the ipsilateral thalamus also showed increased numbers of the glial fibrillary acidic protein positive cells (astrocytes, by approximately 3.5-fold) and the ED-1 positive cells (microglia/macrophages, by approximately 36-fold), the two cell types known to be associated with PTBR. Increased PTBR expression following TBI seems to be associated with microglia/macrophages than astrocytes as PTBR density at different periods after TBI correlated better with the number of ED-1 positive cells (r(2) = 0.95) than the GFAP positive cells (r(2) = 0.56). TBI-induced increased PTBR expression is possibly an adaptive response to cellular injury and may play a role in the pathophysiology of TBI.",

Known predictors of functional decline unlikely to be amenable to intervention included age, education, medical comorbidity, cognitive function, smoking history, and presence of previous spine fracture.

A prediction rule based on these eight modifiable predictors classified women in the derivation set into three risk groups for decline in vigorous activities (12%, 25%, and 39% risk) and two risk groups for decline in basic activities (2% and 10% risk). In the validation set, the probabilities of functional decline were nearly identical.",

Three intramuscular (i.m.) anesthetic combinations were evaluated: (1) tiletamine/zolazepam (T/Z) at a dose of 8.5 mg/kg in 12 nine-banded long-nosed armadillos (NBA) and 10 great long-nosed armadillos (GLA), (2) ketamine at 40 mg/kg combined with xylazine at 1.0 mg/kg (K/X) in 18 NBA and nine GLA, and (3) ketamine at 7.5 mg/kg combined with medetomidine at 75 microng/kg (K/M) in 17 NBA and 12 GLA, antagonized by 375 microg/kg atipamezole. Induction was smooth, ranged from mean +/- SD = 2.8+/-0.6 to 4.3+/-1.8 min, and did not differ significantly between protocols, species, or sex. In NBA, immobilization time ranged from 43.8+/-27.8 to 66.5+/-40.0 min and did not differ between protocols or sex. Muscle relaxation was judged to be better with K/X and K/M versus T/Z. In GLA, the response to the anesthetic protocols was more variable and immobilization time ranged from 30.4+/-6.2 to 98.4+/-33.7 min. The main difference was observed in GLA females receiving the T/Z combination, in which immobilization time was significantly longer versus males, but also versus GLA K/M group, and versus NBA T/Z group. Effects on body temperature, heart rate and respiratory rate were limited. Thirty six to 50% of the individuals showed hypoxemia (SpO2 < 85%) throughout anesthesia and values <80% also were recorded but the hypoxemia was not associated with clinical signs. With T/Z and K/X, recovery was irregular and prolonged up to 2 to 3 hr in some individuals. In K/M groups, first standing was observed 1.0 to 16.4 min after i.m. atipamezole injection without adverse effects. Finally, the three anesthetic combinations used in this study were effective and safe agents for 30 to 40 min immobilizations including minor surgery procedures. The ability to antagonize the medetomidine-induced sedation with atipamezole significantly reduces the recovery time, making the K/M combination preferable, especially in field conditions.",

Zolpidem use is gaining favor because of its efficacy and its side effect profile, which is milder and less problematic than that of the benzodiazepines and barbiturates used to treat insomnia. Still, side effects are not uncommon with zolpidem use. We report a series of cases in which the patients developed delirium, nightmares and hallucinations during treatment with zolpidem. We will review its pharmacology, discuss previous reports of central nervous system side effects, examine the impact of drug interactions with concurrent use of antidepressants, examine gender differences in susceptibility to side effects, and explore the significance of protein binding in producing side effects.",

Residual sedation was measured with sleep latency testing (5 and 6.5 h postdrug), digit symbol substitution, symbol copying, and subjective sleepiness by visual analog scale, each twice each morning. Zaleplon did not differ from placebo on any measure of residual sedation; flurazepam showed significant sedation on all measures.

    "91": "The function and specific structural aspects of the tryptophan-rich sensory protein (TspO) of Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 were studied using site-directed mutagenesis involving some 17 different amino acids. The choice of these amino acids changes was dictated from an analysis of the TspO family of proteins derived from the data bases. These studies demonstrated the importance of several highly conserved tryptophan residues in the sensory transduction pathway involving TspO through the proposed binding of an intermediate(s) in the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway. These studies also revealed that the substitution of one or several of the amino acid residues dramatically affected, either directly or indirectly, the levels of TspO in the membranes of R. sphaeroides. Mounting evidence is presented suggesting that TspO normally forms a dimer within the bacterial outer membrane, and the dimer form of TspO may be the active form for TspO function. Because our earlier studies provided us with a functional framework within which to view these amino acid substitutions, we are able to suggest a preliminary model for TspO structure-function. Not only do these studies tell us more about TspO, but they also shed light on the TspO homologue, the drug-binding component of the mitochondrial peripheral benzodiazepine receptor. Mounting evidence draws numerous parallelism between these proteins and supports the significance of using TspO as a model for the structure and function of the mitochondrial protein.", 
    "92": "Testosterone, terfenadine, midazolam, and nifedipine, four commonly used substrates for human cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4), were studied in pairs in human liver microsomes and in microsomes from cells containing recombinant human CYP3A4 and P-450 reductase, to investigate in vitro substrate-substrate interaction with CYP3A4. The interaction patterns between compounds with CYP3A4 were found to be substrate-dependent. Mutual inhibition, partial inhibition, and activation were observed in the testosterone-terfenadine, testosterone-midazolam, or terfenadine-midazolam interactions. However, the most unusual result was the interaction between testosterone and nifedipine. Although nifedipine inhibited testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation in a concentration-dependent manner, testosterone did not inhibit nifedipine oxidation. Furthermore, the effect of testosterone and 7,8-benzoflavone on midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and 4-hydroxylation demonstrated different regiospecificities. These results may be explained by a model in which multiple substrates or ligands can bind concurrently to the active site of a single CYP3A4 molecule. However, the contribution of separate allosteric sites and conformational heterogeneity to the atypical kinetics of CYP3A4 can not be ruled out in this model.",

Recently, clonazepam has attracted interest as drug for the treatment of manic-depressive psychosis. Chouinard et al (1983), Victor et al (1984), Freinhar and Alvarez (1985) and Santos and Morton (1987) have reported on the antimanic properties of clonazepam, and Jones and Chouinard (1985), Zetine and Freedman (1986), Mas et al (1993) and Kishimoto et al(1987) have reported on the antidepressive properties of clonazepam. We have observed the antimanic and antidepressive properties of clonazepam as well. Clonazepam is a useful therapeutic adjunct and the onset of its effect is rapid. We cannot, however, advocate the use of only the therapeutic agent for amelioration of manic-depressive psychosis. Clonazepam is a useful supplement and has a diverse optimum daily dose for acute manic and depressive states. Clonazepam should, at the time, be considered only as an alternative treatment for patients nonresponsive to conventional therapy, and should be used at a dosage of 3-6 mg/day for depressive state and 10 mg/day for acute manic state in combination with other psychotropic drugs.", 
    "113": "It is well established that in the absence of photic cues, the circadian rhythms of rodents can be readily phase-shifted and entrained by various nonphotic stimuli that induce increased levels of locomotor activity (i.e., benzodiazepines, a new running wheel, and limited food access). In the presence of an entraining light-dark (LD) cycle, however, the entraining effects of nonphotic stimuli on (parts of) the circadian oscillator are far less clear. Yet, an interesting finding is that appropriately timed exercise after a phase shift can accelerate the entrainment of circadian rhythms to the new LD cycle in both rodents and humans. The present study investigated whether restricted daytime feeding (RF) (1) induces a phase shift of the melatonin rhythm under entrained LD conditions and (2) accelerates resynchronization of circadian rhythms after an 8-h phase advance. Animals were adapted to RF with 2-h food access at the projected time of the new dark onset. Before and at several time points after the 8-h phase advance, nocturnal melatonin profiles were measured in RF animals and animals on ad libitum feeding (AL). In LD-entrained conditions, RF did not cause any significant changes in the nocturnal melatonin profile as compared to AL. Unexpectedly, after the 8-h phase advance, RF animals resynchronized more slowly to the new LD cycle than AL animals. These results indicate that prior entrainment to a nonphotic stimulus such as RF may \"phase lock\" the circadian oscillator and in that way hinder resynchronization after a phase shift.", 
    "114": "Sedative agents are routinely administered to critically ill patients, both on and off extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), to enable patients to be comfortable and facilitate patient management. It has been observed empirically in our paediatric intensive care unit that doses of sedative drugs required to achieve desired levels of sedation in ECMO patients are far greater than those used in non-ECMO patients. These differences could not simply be accounted for by differences in patient types, clinical status or sedation levels. We therefore undertook an in vitro evaluation of drug binding in ECMO circuits. This study investigated how the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and silicone rubber components of neonatal ECMO circuits affect drug delivery in patients through drug sorption. Phase 1 investigated drug uptake by the two polymers in static solutions of known concentrations of four commonly used sedative drugs: lorazepam, midazolam, diazepam and propofol. Phase 2 involved the setting up of a complete neonatal ECMO circuit, injecting the drug solutions pre reservoir at a flow rate of 350 ml/min and collecting samples post-oxygenator for analysis. Phase 1 results revealed significant uptake of drugs with losses in the range 40-98% and in the order propofol > diazepam > midazolam > orazepam. Phase 2 results were similar and in the first 40 min of running an ECMO circuit only 10% of propofol passed through the circuit. These results may help to explain observed clinical phenomena and raise important issues regarding drug dosing in ECMO patients.",

Recent studies of patients with ischaemic cerebrovascular diseases have demonstrated reduced central benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) binding in the normal appearing cortical areas, which might be more direct evidence of changes of the neurons. Although pathophysiology of the decreased BZR is unclear, a decrease in the cortical BZR binding with neuronal loss would cause atrophy of the corpus callosum.

In vivo ECG recordings in intact anaesthetized dogs indicated no significant chromanol 293B (1 mg kg-1 i.v.) effect on the QTc interval (332.9 +/- 16.1 ms before versus 330.5 +/- 11.2 ms, n = 6, after chromanol 293B), while D-sotalol (1 mg kg-1 i.v.) significantly increased the QTc interval (323.9 +/- 7.3 ms before versus 346.5 +/- 6.4 ms, n = 5, after D-sotalol, P < 0.05). 4. The current density estimated during the normal ventricular muscle action potential (i.e. after a 200 ms square pulse to +30 mV or during a 250 ms long 'action potential-like' test pulse) indicates that substantially more current is conducted through IKr channels than through IKs channels. However, if the duration of the square test pulse or the 'action potential-like' test pulse was lengthened to 500 ms the relative contribution of IKs significantly increased. 5. When APD was pharmacologically prolonged in papillary muscle (1 microM E-4031 and 1 microg ml-1 veratrine), 100 nM L-735,821 and 10 microM chromanol 293B lengthened repolarization substantially by 14.4 +/- 3.4 and 18. 0 +/- 3.4% (n = 8), respectively. 6. We conclude that in this study IKs plays little role in normal dog ventricular muscle and Purkinje fibre action potential repolarization and that IKr is the major source of outward current responsible for initiation of final action potential repolarization. Thus, when APD is abnormally increased, the role of IKs in final repolarization increases to provide an important safety mechanism that reduces arrhythmia risk.",

    "138": "We have recently reported that parkinsonian patients show a significant GH response to gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), but not to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic drug administration. In order to establish whether muscarinic cholinergic receptors mediate the GH secretion induced by GHB, normal men and parkinsonian patients were tested with GHB both in the absence and in the presence of the anticholinergic agent, pirenzepine. Both normal controls and parkinsonian patients showed a significant serum GH rise in response to GHB (25 mg/kg body weight p.o.) even though a slightly, but significantly lower response was observed in parkinsonian patients. Pretreatment with pirenzepine (100 mg p.o. 2 h before GHB) completely suppressed the GHB-induced GH release in both normal controls and parkinsonian patients. These data indicate that a cholinergic mechanism mediates the GH response to GHB in normal men. In addition the data indicate that this pathway is preserved in the parkinsonian brain.", 
    "139": "This article reviews the pharmacologic treatment of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. These disorders are quite common and can be considered a \"silent epidemic\" because they are more often reported by the children and adolescents than by their parents. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), benzodiazepines, buspirone, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been used to treat anxiety disorders in children and adolescents with varying degrees of success. Considering safety and efficacy, the SSRIs appear to be the first-line treatment for anxiety disorders in youth, but more studies are needed to confirm preliminary results. Tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines may be considered when the child has not responded to SSRIs or when adverse effects have exceeded benefits. Although nonpharmacologic approaches for the treatment of anxiety in children and adolescents are beyond the scope of this article, their importance is to be underscored and they should be considered as part of the treatment plan. Over the next decade, research data will be generated regarding the treatment of anxiety disorders in youth. Ongoing research studies include the use of fluoxetine (B. Birmaher, personal communication, 1999) and fluvoxamine (J. Walkup, personal communication, 1999) for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, or social phobia; and buspirone for generalized anxiety disorder in children. Despite these efforts, there is a need for more studies to examine the safety and efficacy of different pharmacologic treatments, as well as longitudinal studies to monitor for long-term tolerability and side effects. Pharmacokinetic studies for children and adolescents will provide information on the metabolism and absorption of these medications and delineate the developmental differences between children and adolescents when compared to adults. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, studies that compare medication, psychosocial treatments, and their combination are needed.",

Because the definition of \"normal\" sleep is not well established, the estimates of the prevalence and severity of insomnia vary widely. Insomnia is often secondary to underlying psychiatric and medical conditions, and these should be evaluated and treated as a first measure. Nonpharmacological interventions for insomnia including sleep hygiene manoeuvres and exercise are recommended, although the success of these interventions has not been well documented. Benzodiazepines have been the pharmacologic agents of choice for the treatment of insomnia, but there is reason to exercise caution with their use; their overall benefit compared with placebo appears to be minor, and they are often associated with adverse cognitive effects. Unfortunately, no other class of drugs has proven to be superior to the benzodiazepines in terms of benefit:risk ratio. Given the importance of sleep for health and normal daily functioning the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of insomnia should be a research priority.",

Patients received midazolam 0.05 mg kg-1 i.v. (group TM, n = 12) or no midazolam (group T0, n = 13). ED50 and ED95 values and group medians for times and doses at the end-points were measured. Midazolam premedication reduced significantly thiopental ED50 and ED95 values at all end-points (exception for ED95 for BUR). Potentiation was greatest for the motor end-point (dropping the infusion bag (DF)) (ED95 +52%, ED50 +23%, median +39%), and smallest for painful stimulation (LRP) (median +18%; ED50 +13%). For LRP and DF, premedication was associated with significant, non-parallel increases in the slope of the thiopental dose-response curves, resulting in marked potency ratio changes from ED50 to ED95 (LRP +31%, DF +29%). There were no such increases for LVC or BUR. The interaction between midazolam and thiopental varied with the anaesthetic end-point and may also depend on the dose of thiopental. Our data suggest that the mechanism of interaction between midazolam premedication and thiopental was different for motor effects or analgesia (DF, LRP) compared with hypnotic effects or cortical depression (LVC, BUR), in agreement with the different central nervous system substrates underlying these distinct anaesthetic end-points.",

Neuropsychological tests were performed before surgery and at discharge, where blood concentrations (free fraction) of benzodiazepines were also measured. POCD was found in 17 patients (48.6%). Diazepam or desmethyldiazepam was detected in 34 patients; median postoperative blood concentrations were 0.06 and 0.10 mumol kg-1, respectively. In a multiple regression analysis considering age, duration of anaesthesia and blood concentrations of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam, only age was found to correlate with the composite z-score (F test, P < 0.01). The postoperative cognitive dysfunction we found in elderly patients after operation could not be explained by benzodiazepine concentrations detected in blood.", 
    "150": "A novel bacterial esterase that cleaves esters on halogenated cyclic compounds has been isolated from an Alcaligenes species. This esterase 713 is encoded by a 1062 base pair gene. The presence of a leader sequence of 27 amino acids suggests that this enzyme is exported from the cytosol. Esterase 713 has been over-expressed in Agrobacterium without this leader sequence. Its amino acid sequence shows no significant homology to any known protein sequence.", 
    "151": "The crystal structure of esterase 713 has been determined by multiple isomorphous replacement and refined to 1. 1 A resolution. The subunits of this dimeric enzyme comprise a single domain with an alpha/beta hydrolase fold. The catalytic triad has been identified as Ser206-His298-Glu230. The acidic residue of the catalytic triad (Glu230) is located on the beta6 strand of the alpha/beta hydrolase fold, whereas most other alpha/beta hydrolase enzymes have the acidic residue located on the beta7 strand. The oxyanion hole is formed by the mainchain nitrogens of Cys71 and Gln207 as identified by the binding of a substrate analogue, (S)-7-iodo-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-4-methyl-3-oxo-1H-1, 4-benzodiazepine-2-acetic acid. Cys71 forms a disulphide bond with the neighbouring Cys72.",

    "153": "The present analysis addressed behavioral changes after treatment with 4.5 mg/kg or 18.5 mg/kg of the GABA-uptake inhibitor tiagabine combined with either the benzodiazepine diazepam (1.5 mg/kg) or the imidazopyridine zolpidem (0.05 mg/kg), the latter two acting differentially on GABA(A) receptor subtypes. The study included 97 male PVG/OIaHsd rats. A standard open field, an enriched open field, and an elevated plus-maze was used to study rat behavior. Treatment with the low dose of tiagabine alone induced no specific behavioral effects, whereas the high dose had an anxiolytic-like potential. Furthermore, diazepam but not zolpidem displayed anxiolytic-like effects. Combination of each benzodiazepine receptor agonist with tiagabine at the low dose decreased explorative activity. Diazepam plus the high dose of tiagabine increased the activity in the open-field test. Zolpidem together with 18.5 mg/kg tiagabine had an angiogenic-like effect compared to pure tiagabine treatment. These results provide evidence for a pharmacodynamic interaction between the GABA-uptake inhibitor tiagabine and diazepam or zolpidem. The interaction might be relevant in the clinic when combining the anticonvulsant tiagabine and a benzodiazepine receptor agonist.", 
    "154": "6-Chloro-3'-nitroflavone integrates a list of nearly 70 flavone derivatives synthesized in our laboratories. The effects of 6-chloro-3'-nitroflavone on the benzodiazepine binding sites (BDZ-BSs) of the GABA(A) receptor were examined in vitro and in vivo. 6-Chloro-3'-nitroflavone inhibited the [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FNZ) binding to rat cerebral cortex membranes with a Ki of 6.68 nM and the addition of GABA to extensively washed membranes did not modify its affinity for the BDZ-BSs (GABA-shift = 1.16+/-0.12). The binding assays performed in rat striatal and cerebellar brain membranes showed that this compound has similar affinity to different populations of BDZ-BSs. Electrophysiological experiments revealed that 6-chloro-3'-nitroflavone did not affect GABA(A)-receptors (GABA(A)-Rs) responses recorded in Xenopus oocytes expressing alpha1beta2gamma2s subunits, but blocked the potentiation exerted by diazepam (DZ) on GABA-activated chloride currents. In vivo experiments showed that 6-chloro-3'-nitroflavone did not possess anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, myorelaxant actions in mice or amnestic effects in rats; however, 6-chloro-3'-nitroflavone antagonized diazepam-induced antianxiety action, anticonvulsion, short-term, and long-term amnesia and motor incoordination. These biochemical, electrophysiological, and pharmacological results suggest that 6-chloro-3'-nitroflavone behaves as an antagonist of the BDZ-BSs.", 
    "155": "The present study was designed to investigate the role of an anxiolytic effect in the development of a drug-associated place preference in rats exposed to conditioned fear stress, using the conditioned place-preference paradigm. The administration of a low dose of ethanol (300 mg/kg, IP) and the anxiolytic drugs, buspirone (1 and 2 mg/kg, IP) and diazepam (1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg, IP), did not produce a place preference in rats that were not exposed to conditioned fear stress. In rats that were exposed to conditioned fear stress, ethanol produced a significant place preference, while buspirone and diazepam failed to produce a place preference. In addition, ethanol, buspirone, and diazepam produced no place preference in rats treated with an anxiogenic dose of pentylenetetrazole (20 mg/kg, IP). A significant decrease in locomotor activity was observed in rats exposed to conditioned fear stress. Ethanol, but not buspirone and diazepam, significantly recovered or increased locomotor activity in rats exposed to conditioned fear stress. Further, the locomotor-stimulating effect of ethanol was markedly enhanced by repeated exposure to conditioned fear stress. These results suggest that the stimulating effect may be strongly related to the development of the rewarding effect of a low dose of ethanol under psychological stress, and that the conditioned place preference paradigm with conditioned fear stress may be useful for studying the rewarding mechanism of ethanol with regard to the interaction between ethanol and psychological stress.", 
    "156": "Electrolytic lesions of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) have been previously reported to increase anxiety-like behavior in rats. The aim of the present study was to compare these behavioral changes with those produced by an anxiogenic compound, the partial inverse agonist at benzodiazepine receptors, beta-CCE. Three groups of rats, sham-lesioned treated with vehicle, sham-lesioned treated with 10 mg/kg of beta-CCE, and PPTg-lesioned rats treated with vehicle, were tested in the elevated plus-maze, the social-interaction test, and for spontaneous locomotion. Histology showed that lesions were concentrated on the caudal half of the PPTg. Measures of both the PPTg-lesioned and beta-CCE-treated rats indicated increased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus-maze and in the social-interaction test. Spontaneous locomotion, measured in the open- field arena, did not differ between sham controls and PPTg-lesioned rats, but was decreased in rats treated with beta-CCE. Our results confirmed that electrolytic lesions of the caudal PPTg produce increased anxiety-like behavior. This behavior is quantitatively and qualitatively similar to that produced by 10 mg/kg of beta-CCE.", 
    "157": "Functional changes in opioid receptors involved in analgesia of repeated cold stress (RCS)-loaded mice were investigated. The antinociceptive potency of morphine (4 mg/kg, PO) was not affected in normal mice by norbinaltorphimine (10 mg/kg, SC), but treatment with this agent resulted in a lower level of morphine-induced antinociception in RCS-loaded animals. The antinociceptive activity of U-50488H (3 mg/kg, SC) was increased in RCS-loaded mice. In contrast to hypersensitivity to U-50488H (1 and 10 microg, IT) noted in RCS-loaded mice, the antinociception induced by DAMGO (0.1 and 1 microg, ICV) was reduced compared to that of normal animals. Diazepam (1 mg/kg/day SC) was given during RCS loading, and this agent prevented the development of hyperalgesia and the decrease in the antinociceptive activity of DAMGO (1 microg, ICV) in RCS-loaded mice, but there was no effect on the enhancement of the antinociceptive potency of U-50488H (10 microg, IT). These results indicate that the RCS-loaded mice were hyposensitive to supraspinal mu-opioid receptor-mediated antinociception, whereas their antinociceptive activities through kappa-opioid receptor in the spinal cord were increased. Hypofunction of the supraspinal mu-opioid receptor due to anxiety may explain the mechanism involved in the lowering of the nociceptive threshold in RCS-loaded animals.", 
    "158": "This series of experiments investigated the effect of the benzodiazepine diazepam on memory formation in day-old chicks trained on a single-trial, passive-avoidance task. The findings indicate that diazepam has a dose-specific and time-dependent effect on memory processes. A 0.125-mg/kg dose of diazepam administered immediately after training led to amnesia in these subjects only after 30 min following learning. Pretreatment with bicuculline and flumazenil were effective in ameliorating the memory deficits caused by diazepam, and consolidated memory function in saline-treated controls following strong and weak aversant training. These findings suggest that benzodiazepine effects on memory are mediated by their effects on arousal, possibly by the release of noradrenaline, which is critical to the establishment of long-term memory.", 
    "159": "Rat stomach ECL cells are rich in histamine and chromogranin A-derived peptides, such as pancreastatin. Gastrin causes the parietal cells to secrete acid by flooding them with histamine from the ECL cells. In the past, gastric histamine release has been studied using anaesthetized, surgically manipulated animals or isolated gastric mucosa, glands or ECL cells. We monitored gastric histamine mobilization in intact conscious rats by subjecting them to gastric submucosal microdialysis. A microdialysis probe was implanted into the submucosa of the acid-producing part of the stomach (day 1). The rats had access to food and water or were deprived of food (48 h), starting on day 2 after implantation of the probe. On day 4, the rats received food or gastrin (intravenous infusion), and sampling of microdialysate commenced. Samples (flow rate 1.2 microl min(-1)) were collected every 20 or 60 min, and the histamine and pancreastatin concentrations were determined. The serum gastrin concentration was determined in tail vein blood. Exogenous gastrin (4-h infusion) raised microdialysate histamine and pancreastatin dose-dependently. This effect was prevented by gastrin receptor blockade (YM022). Depletion of ECL-cell histamine by alpha-fluoromethylhistidine, an irreversible inhibitor of the histamine-forming enzyme, suppressed the gastrin-evoked release of histamine but not that of pancreastatin. Fasting lowered serum gastrin and microdialysate histamine by 50%, while refeeding raised serum gastrin and microdialysate histamine and pancreastatin 3-fold. We conclude that histamine mobilized by gastrin and food intake derives from ECL cells because: 1) Histamine and pancreastatin were released concomitantly, 2) histamine mobilization following gastrin or food intake was prevented by gastrin receptor blockade, and 3) mobilization of histamine (but not pancreastatin) was abolished by alpha-fluoromethylhistidine. Hence, gastric submucosal microdialysis allows us to monitor the mobilization of ECL-cell histamine in intact conscious rats under various experimental conditions not previously accessible to study. While gastrin receptor blockade lowered post-prandial release of ECL-cell histamine by about 80%, unilateral vagotomy reduced post-prandial mobilization of ECL-cell histamine by about 50%. Hence, both gastrin and vagal excitation contribute to the post-prandial release of ECL-cell histamine.", 
    "160": "The isoprenoids geranylgeraniol and farnesol are required for lipid modification of several important cellular proteins. In this study the effect of perillyl alcohol (PA), an inhibitor of geranylgeranyl transferase, was examined on proliferation and apoptosis of immortalized human vascular smooth muscle cells (HVSMCs) derived from saphenous vein. PA induced a time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation over 3 days and 48 h exposure to PA inhibited [methyl-3H-thymidine incorporation induced by 10% fetal calf serum in a concentration-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that PA reduced the proportion of cells in S phase and increased apoptosis. PA-induced apoptosis was confirmed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) reagent-based immunocytochemistry. In contrast, the selective inhibitors of farnesyl transferase B581 and BZA-5B were without effect. In view of the proposed role of proliferation and apoptosis in myointimal hyperplasia, inhibitors of geranylgeranyl transferases may have therapeutic potential in cardiovascular disease.", 
    "161": "The increased prevalence of sleep disturbance in old age is accompanied by a higher prescription rate of hypnotics, predominantly benzodiazepines in the elderly.

On each of the 3 study nights a sleep EEG was registered from 10 p.m. to 6.30 a.m. and cognitive performance tests were applied at 8 p.m., 2 a.m. (when subjects were awake for 30 min), 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.", 
    "164": "After zopiclone treatment, sleep continuity had significantly improved and sleep stage 4 was increased compared to temazepam and placebo. In addition, both active substances significantly reduced REM density. Neither active compound substantially altered psychomotor and memory performance.", 
    "165": "Zopiclone and temazepam can be considered as effective hypnotics in elderly subjects when administered in that dosage. The superiority of zopiclone on sleep architecture may be related to a more specific action of zopiclone at the GABA-A benzodiazepine receptor complex. The suppression of REM density by both compounds and their subtle effects on cognition may reflect a GABAergic mediated reduction of cholinergic neuro-transmission."
