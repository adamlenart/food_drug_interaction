    "0": "Within the framework of its' Environment Research and Development Programme, the European Communities (EC) Directorate General (DG) XII has supported a research project aimed at developing and validating assay systems for the detection and evaluation of chemicals capable of inducing numerical chromosome changes such as aneuploidy and polyploidy. A range of test chemicals were selected, which include a core set comprising; colchicine, econazole nitrate, chloral hydrate, hydroquinone, diazepam, thiabendazole, cadmium chloride, thimerosol, pyrimethamine and vinblastine sulphate. These test chemicals were used to evaluate the ability of test systems ranging from tubulin polymerisation, fungal cultures, cultured mammalian cells and intact rodents to detect chemical aneugens and to assess the significance of such activity to exposed human populations.", 
    "1": "Two in vitro cytogenetic assays were evaluated for their ability to detect aneugenic and polyploidy-inducing agents using a battery of 10 known or suspected aneugens supplied as part of the EEC 4th Environmental Research and Development Programme. The compounds tested were colchicine, vinblastine, chloral hydrate, thiabendazole, hydroquinone, thimerosal, cadmium chloride, econazole nitrate, pyrimethamine and diazepam. The cell division aberration assay employed a differential chromosome/spindle staining procedure to detect perturbations of the mitotic division apparatus. This assay was carried out in two pulmonary-derived Chinese hamster cell lines; the immortal DON:Wg3h culture and a low passage LUC2 culture. The second assay involved quantification of metaphase chromosomes, for which only the LUC2 cell line was used, due to the stability of its diploid karyotype. All the chemicals induced spindle disturbances in the immortal line. In addition, all the compounds except cadmium chloride yielded positive results in the LUC2 culture, although many were not as potent. In the low passage line, 8 of the compounds (colchicine, vinblastine, chloral hydrate, thiabendazole, thimerosal, econazole nitrate, pyrimethamine and diazepam) induced aneuploidy and/or tetraploidy. Cadmium chloride was negative in the chromosome enumeration assay and hydroquinone yielded inconclusive results. The study of cell division aberrations was much less time-consuming and technically complex than the counting of metaphase chromosomes. In addition, it provided a degree of mechanistic understanding of the mode of action of some aneugenic and polyploidy-producing agents. However, the enumeration of chromosomes provides a more definitive data set for the evaluation of a chemical's aneugenic potential.", 
    "2": "The test chemicals included in the EC Aneuploidy Project were evaluated for their ability to induce aneuploidy or aneuploidy related endpoints in assays using in vitro tubulin polymerisation, fungi and wheat. The results obtained demonstrated considerable qualitative and quantitative differences between the responses of the assays to the 10 test chemicals. Fungal assays failed to respond to the potent mammalian spindle poisons colchicine and vinblastine and only three chemicals were positive in all three fungal test systems i.e. chloral hydrate, thimerosol and thiabendazole. The in vitro tubulin polymerisation assays produced unambiguous positive results with three chemicals i.e. colchicine, thimerosol and vinblastine sulphate. The hexaploid wheat assay produced a positive response with 8 of the test chemicals i.e. colchicine, econazole, thimerosol, pyrimethamine, thiabendazole, cadmium chloride, vinblastine and diazepam. However, the wheat assay was relatively insensitive to the potent spindle poison colchicine.", 
    "3": "The present study was carried out with the 10 known or suspected spindle poisons of the Commission of the European Communities program to study aneuploidy induction. We have investigated these substances on the assembly of isolated bovine microtubules at 10, 100 and 1000 microM and studied morphology by electron microscopy. The substances could be grouped into two categories, strong and weak inhibitors. Colchicine, vinblastine and thimerosal were strong inhibitors; cadmium chloride, thiabendazole, chloral hydrate, hydroquinone, diazepam and econazole were weak inhibitors, the latter three causing aberrant forms visible on electron microscopy. Pyrimethamine did not inhibit the assembly of microtubules, but produced aberrant forms.", 
    "4": "The synopsis of the in vivo test results in the first collaborative CEC Aneuploidy Project with 10 selected chemicals, colchicine (COL), econazole (EZ), chloral hydrate (CH), hydroquinone (HQ), diazepam (DZ), thiabendazole (TB), cadmium chloride (CD), thimerosal (TM), pyrimethamine (PY) and vinblastine (VBL), allowed several conclusions. (1) The spindle poisons, COL and VBL, were positive in all bone marrow and germ cell tests; (2) the clastogen HQ also induced aneuploidy in somatic and germinal cells; (3) the other seven compounds gave contradictory results either between laboratories or between test systems which require further experimental clarification; (4) CREST labeling or in situ hybridization for centromere identification showed about 70% fluorescent signals in micronuclei induced by COL or VBL but only about 15% in HQ induced micronuclei; (5) the tests for induction of a delay in cell division progression can be recommended as a prescreen for possible aneugens; (6) all test methods applied in these experiments require standardization with respect to sample size, sampling times and statistical treatment of the data. A second CEC Aneuploidy Programme has started recently to answer some of the questions raised by the first study regarding tissue and sex specificities.", 
    "5": "Within the context of a coordinated program to study aneuploidy induction sponsored by the European Community, nine chemicals were tested in mouse bone marrow and spermatocytes after intraperitoneal injection. In somatic cells, cell progression delay, hyperploidy, polyploidy induction and induction of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocyte (MnPCE) were studied. In germ cells hyperploidy induction was evaluated. The chemicals selected were: colchicine (COL), econazole (EZ), hydroquinone (HQ), thiabendazole (TB), diazepam (DZ), chloral hydrate (CH), cadmium chloride (CD), pyrimethamine (PY) and thimerosal (TM). Using literature data on c-mitotic effects in bone marrow as a reference, the same doses were tested in somatic and germ cells in order to compare the effects induced. Bone marrow cells were sampled 18 or 24 h after treatment. Germ cells were sampled 6, 8 or 18 h after treatment. Effects of COL and HQ in bone marrow have been reported elsewhere. Somatic effects were induced by CH (hyperploidy and cell cycle lengthening), TB (MnPCEs and cell cycle lengthening) and by PY (MnPCEs). EZ, DZ, CD and TM did not induce any kind of somatic effects. An increase in the incidence of hyperploid spermatocytes was induced by COL, at three dose levels, and by one dose of HQ and TB. All the other chemicals did not induce germinal aneuploidy at any dose or time tested. The hyperploidy control frequency ranged between 0.4 and 1.0% in somatic cells and from 0.3 to 0.9% in germ cells. In both somatic and germ cells, the maximum yield of induced hyperploidy did not exceed 3.5%. The time period of target cell sensitivity is probably restricted and this, associated with the heterogeneity and the asynchrony of cellular maturation processes, may account for our data. Under these circumstances, the negative data should be interpreted with some caution, particularly in germ cells, where additional indicators of chemical-cell interaction and cell cycle effects were not provided by standardized approaches. The possibility of increasing the size of analyzed cell samples could be considered in the light of automatic scoring procedures.", 
    "6": "Ten known or suspected aneugens were analyzed in a variety of in vitro mammalian cell cultures using different endpoints which included: micronuclei, kinetochore-positive micronuclei in binucleated cells, changes in the number of chromosomes or aberrations of mitosis and division. Human lymphocytes, human diploid fibroblasts and Chinese hamster transformed cells were used as target cells. The relative merits of different in vitro test systems employed are briefly discussed here.", 
    "7": "We have investigated the potential value of estimating number and size of micronuclei in cytokinesis-blocked human peripheral blood lymphocytes as a measure of the aneuploidy-inducing ability of 5 chemicals in the EEC trial. Colchicine induced metaphase arrest, high numbers of cells with micronuclei and also of cells with completely fragmented nuclei. The majority of micronuclei were very significantly larger in relation to the main nucleus than a comparable set taken from untreated control cultures. In the same assay system, diazepam weakly increased the incidence of MN in a dose-related fashion. There was a slight increase in MN but only at toxic doses when cells were treated with econidazole, chloral hydrate or hydroquinone. For each of these 4 drugs, statistical treatment of the data confirmed a difference in size distribution of the MN as compared to those found in negative control cultures. Although this approach has potential, it may not be optimal to detect weak aneuploidy-inducing agents.", 
    "8": "The effect of lindane administration on the specific binding of ligands to different sites on the GABAA receptor-ionophore complex was studied in the rat brain by receptor mapping autoradiography. [3H]Muscimol (Mus), [3H]flunitrazepam (Flu), and t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) were used as specific ligands of GABA, benzodiazepine, and picrotoxinin binding sites, respectively. Rats received a single oral dose of 30 mg/kg lindane and they were classified into two groups according to the absence or presence of convulsions. Vehicle-treated groups acted as controls. The effect of the xenobiotic on ligand binding was measured in different brain areas and nuclei 12 min or 5 h after its administration. Lindane induced a generalized decrease in [35S]TBPS binding, which was present shortly after dosing. In addition, [3H]Flu binding was increased in lindane-treated animals, this modification also appearing shortly after administration but diminishing during the studied time. Finally, lindane induced a decrease in [3H]Mus binding, which became more evident over time. These modifications were observed both in the presence and in the absence of convulsions. However, an increase in [3H]-Mus binding was detected shortly after lindane-induced convulsions. The observed decrease in [35S]TBPS binding is in agreement with the postulated action of lindane at the picrotoxinin binding site of the GABAA receptor chloride channel. The effects observed on the binding of [3H]Flu and [3H]Mus may be secondary to the action of lindane as an allosteric antagonist of the GABAA receptor.", 
    "9": "It has been suggested that lorazepam has a definite role as an antiemetic drug in antiemetic cocktails. In this study we examined the antiemetic efficacy of metoclopramide (200 mg) and methylprednisolone (1000 mg) with or without lorazepam.", 
    "10": "Sixty patients treated with cisplatin-containing regimens were entered into a randomized, double-blind study with cross-over. Lorazepam 2.5 mg or placebo were administered orally the evening before therapy and just after the beginning of fluid infusion for chemotherapy. Degree of nausea and number of vomiting episodes, together with somnolence, were recorded on a data flow sheet and visual-analogue scales.", 
    "11": "100 cycles (50 patients) are evaluable. In 39 cycles there was no nausea and vomiting, in 74 cycles acceptable control of emesis was reached (0-2 episodes of vomiting), without significant differences among the two arms. However, nausea was shorter in lorazepam arm (p < 0.01), and 80% of the patients preferred treatment with lorazepam (p < 0.003). Anxiety was reduced in the patients treated with lorazepam (p < 0.4).", 
    "12": "Lorazepam improves tolerability to cisplatin-containing chemotherapy, mainly by influencing the psychological status of the patient and favoring the amnestic process.", 
    "13": "A predominant form of the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor-Cl- channel complex is believed to consist of three different 48-55 kDa subunits (alpha, beta, gamma) with unknown stoichiometry. Plasmids containing the rat GABAA receptor cDNAs coding for alpha 1, beta 2, and gamma 2 were co-transfected, along with a plasmid encoding G418 resistance, into human embryonic kidney cells previously transformed with Adenovirus 5 (HEK-293) [J. Gen. Virol., 36 (1977) 59-72]. Four percent of the G418 resistant colonies were found to express mRNA for all three of the GABAA subunits constitutively. A single cell clone derived from one of the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 expressors has demonstrated stable electrophysiological characteristics over 25 passages. The GABA-activated Cl- current in this cell line is blocked by picrotoxin and bicuculline, and is modulated by a variety of agonist and inverse agonist ligands including diazepam, Ro 154513, zolpidem, and beta-CCE. The cell line has been used successfully over a 12-month period as a screen for novel drugs modulating GABA-mediated polarization of neuronal cells.", 
    "14": "The anticonflict activity of the ergot alkaloid, dihydroergosine, a drug which binds to 5-hydroxytryptamine1 (5-HT1) receptors and to gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor-associated Cl- ionophore, was studied in water-deprived rats. In vitro effects of this drug on [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam binding to the crude synaptosomal pellet of the human frontal cortex post-mortem were also investigated. Dihydroergosine, given 2 h prior to testing, enhanced drinking under punished (0.8 mA) conditions, and diminished it under unpunished conditions. The mechanism of this effect was (-)-propranolol- and pindolol-insensitive and picrotoxin-sensitive. Flumazenil either failed to affect, or at a higher dose (10 mg/kg), counteracted the dihydroergosine-induced enhancement of punished drinking. This dose of flumazenil was itself anxiogenic. Dihydroergosine had mild sedative and analgesic properties. Low concentrations of dihydroergosine (10 nM to 100 microM) enhanced the binding of [3H]muscimol but not of [3H]flunitrazepam. The results suggest that dihydroergosine may possess anxiolytic properties presumably mediated by its specific action at the GABA/benzodiazepine/chloride channel complex.", 
    "15": "Aspects of psychiatric emergencies of special interest to the general physician are discussed. The perception that a problem constitutes an emergency is often subjective and sometimes reflects the anxieties of others rather than a real need for urgent treatment. Keeping calm and unhurried in front of an agitated patient might be as important as the use of a neuroleptic. The rather unusual psychopathological phenomena catalepsy and psychogenic twilight state (psychogenic trance) are mentioned in view of their importance for urgent assessment of mental status. The scope of the problem of suicide is outlined as far as the general physician is involved. Special attention is paid to panic disorder and attacks, a relatively new concept in medicine. Since the symptoms mimic those of cardiac, endocrine and convulsive disorders, patients with such symptoms often come to the attention of general physicians and frequently use the services of emergency departments. Early identification and treatment of panic disorder might help to avoid unnecessary repeated emergency department visits, and at the same time reduce the associated high risk of suicide and other psychiatric disorders such as depression as well as drug and alcohol abuse.", 
    "16": "A panic attack is characterized by the abrupt onset of apprehension or fear, accompanied by symptoms such as dyspnea, palpitations, chest pain, dizziness, sweating, the feeling of going mad or the fear of dying. The feeling of anxiety often recedes into the background and such patients present to nonpsychiatric physicians with mainly somatic symptoms. The consequences of frequent panic attacks, named panic disorder, are agoraphobia with impairment of psychic and social functioning, increased prevalence of alcohol abuse, depression and, in particular, suicidal attempts. It is of the utmost importance that physicians recognize the somatic symptoms of panic anxiety and plan integrated treatment. The main therapeutic resources at present include antidepressants, selected benzodiazepines and behavioral treatments and are very successful in improving panic attacks and their consequences, which may long go undiagnosed.", 
    "17": "We report a case of a woman hospitalized after chloroquine overdose whose whole blood concentration on admission was 7.87 micrograms/ml. High blood concentrations of chloroquine induce cardiotoxicity and have been associated with death when they exceed 3.0 micrograms/ml. Early administration of massive doses of diazepam has been described to reduce the mortality due to chloroquine toxicity, but the protective mechanism has remained unknown. This patient was treated with diazepam (2.0 mg/kg over 30 min followed by a dosage of 1.0 to 2.0 mg/kg over 24 h), yet she remained awake despite the high plasma concentrations of diazepam and nordiazepam which would normally be associated with sedation. This suggests an antagonistic effect of chloroquine on the benzodiazepine-induced sedation due to an interaction between these drugs at their site of action.", 
    "18": "The drug use on Cura\u00e7ao was evaluated with the help of the prescription forms of twelve community pharmacies at Cura\u00e7ao over a period of three months. The emphasis of the study was on three therapeutic groups: the systemic antibiotics, the psycholeptics and the anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic drugs. Within the group of systemic antibiotics broad-spectrum antibiotics were very frequently prescribed compared with the small-spectrum penicillins. The consumption of psycholeptics, particularly benzodiazepines, on Cura\u00e7ao is remarkably low in comparison with drug utilization data of Denmark and the Netherlands. In contrast, the number of defined daily doses per 1,000 persons per day of antirheumatic drugs is higher compared with data from these two countries. Within the analysed groups, large differences occur between the two most important kinds of insurance, i.c., the poor people (PP) and social insurance bank (SVB) insurance. The PP-insured patients consume in the case of antibiotics and antirheumatic drugs almost twice as many and in the case of psycholeptics even five times as many as the SVB-insured patients do. A few calculations of prices prove that the extra amount of drugs consumed by PP-insured has important financial consequences.", 
    "19": "Catecholamine terminals in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus of 60-day-old rats were destroyed by the stereotaxic injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the PVN (6-OHDA; 9 micrograms/1.5 microliters bilaterally), and the rats were tested 2 weeks later. Lesions led to a 70% reduction of norepinephrine in the hypothalamus and a loss of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the PVN. Furthermore, 6-OHDA lesions in the hypothalamus disrupted stressor-induced (15 min of restraint) changes in GABAA receptor function in the cerebral cortex (assessed by measuring chloride-facilitated benzodiazepine binding) but did not alter stressor-induced increases in plasma corticosterone levels. Additionally, the lesion did not change the responsiveness of the GABAA receptor to the corticosterone metabolite, allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone. These results indicate that stressor-induced changes in cortical GABAA receptor function are not driven by the stressor-induced release of corticosterone. A separate group of animals were tested for behavioral responses to challenge, and while 6-OHDA-induced lesions did not alter total scores in the test of environment-specific social interaction, the lesions did induce a change in composition of the behavior. Lesioned animals demonstrated increased physical (vigorous contact) interactions, similar to behavior previously observed in younger rats. The results of the behavioral study support a role for the GABAA receptor in the cerebral cortex in mediating appropriate behavioral responses to challenge in the adult rat. Thus, a hypothalamic lesion that prevented challenge-induced changes in GABAA receptor function in the cortex (with no change in the corticosterone response to the stressor) also led to altered behavioral responses to challenge.", 
    "20": "Diazepam (10 mg/kg i.p.) or MK-801 (0.25 mg/kg i.p.) offered complete protection against corneal electroshock (30 mA x 0.2 s)-induced tonic seizures and lethality but failed to protect from aminophylline (150 mg/kg i.p.) + electroshock (15 mA x 0.2 s)-induced tonic seizures and lethality in mice. The diazepam (2.5 mg/kg i.p.) and MK-801 (0.25 mg/kg i.p.) combination completely protected the mice from aminophylline + electroshock-induced seizures and lethality. Sodium valproate (500 mg/kg i.p.) protected the mice from electroshock (30 mA) per se and aminophylline + electroshock (15 mA)-induced seizure and lethality. The present study established the neurosensitizing potential of a single, non-convulsive dose of aminophylline for electroconvulsion due to subthreshold intensity electroshock and demonstrated the prophylactic efficacy of sodium valproate and the synergistic therapeutic potential of diazepam and MK-801 combination against such seizure attacks.", 
    "21": "The epidemiology, phenomenology and treatment of panic disorder have been thoroughly studied in recent years. The symptomatology of panic attacks may mimic cardiopulmonary, neurological and gastrointestinal disease. Forty Danish panic patients with panic disorder of ten years' duration had had contact with several medical specialists, hospital emergency and outpatient services. Thus, 28% had visited neurologists, 8% cardiologists and 20% an emergency service. One third had been admitted to hospital departments. Almost all patients had consulted psychiatrists or psychologists. Ninety had been treated with a benzodiazepine, 35% with tricyclic antidepressants and 57% with neuroleptics. To prevent costly medical testings and delay in accurate diagnosis in psychiatric and somatic settings, the phenomenology of panic disorders should be recognized by all medical specialists and general practitioners.", 
    "22": "Panic accompanies several diseases both psychological and somatic. It may be secondary, i.e. produced by other symptoms and morbid processes. It may also be primary--\"neurotic\". In such cases there are two forms of panic: generalized and paroxysmal. Attacks of panic are seen in 1.6-2.9% of women and in 0.4-1.7% of men. Main pathogenetic role is played by the psychologic factors (psychical trauma precedes the onset of diseases). The role of biological factors is also important. It is believed that disorders of the noradrenergic, serotonin-ergic, and GABA-ergic transmission may produce the attacks of panic. Psychotherapy is a treatment of choice. Pharmacotherapy plays only an adjuvant role. Antidepressants (tricyclic of II generation) are most frequently used for this purpose and--exceptionally due to possible addiction--benzodiazepines. The highest impact on the development of disease has first contact physician attitude. Patient and thoughtful listening to the patient, explanation of the complaints and their source often produce and improvement, and even complete recovery.", 
    "23": "A series of imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine esters have been synthesized with varying ester side chains and 8-position substituents. The affinities of these compounds were evaluated at both \"diazepam-insensitive\" (DI) and diazepam-sensitive (DS) subtypes of the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR). A profound steric effect of the 3-position ester side chain moiety was observed on ligand affinity at DI. In contrast, ester size had a less robust effect on ligand affinity at DS. The tert-butyl ester compound 8 displayed the highest affinity (Ki = 1.7 nM) for DI within a series of 8-chloro esters. Furthermore, halogens at the 8-position resulted in an enhancement of both ligand affinity and selectivity at DI among the series of tert-butyl esters examined. The 8-nitro derivative 23 and 8-isothiocyanato congener 25 had high affinities for both DI and DS but exhibited little subtype selectivity (10.8 and 2.7 nM at DI versus 14 and 3.7 nM at DS, respectively). The 8-azido tert-butyl ester 29 exhibited a significantly higher affinity (Ki = 0.43 nM) and selectivity (DI/DS ratio of 0.2) than the corresponding ethyl ester, the prototypic DI ligand 1 (Ro 15-4513). Among the compounds synthesized, 29 is the highest affinity ligand for DI described to date while its 8-bromo analog 18 is the most selective ligand (DI/DS ratio of 0.17) for this novel BZR subtype.", 
    "24": "Using in situ hybridisation, the effects of acute and chronic diazepam administration and diazepam withdrawal on preprocholecystokinin (CCK) mRNA levels in discrete regions of rat brain were determined. In cerebral cortex and a subpopulation of hippocampal neurones, CCK mRNA levels were increased after a single injection of diazepam and 24 h after withdrawal from chronic diazepam treatment, but not after chronic diazepam treatment. These results show that, in some neuronal groups, CCK mRNA expression is regulated by benzodiazepines, although there is no clear link between CCK mRNA levels and anxiety state.", 
    "25": "Lanthanides at micromolar concentrations stimulated binding of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS), a highly sensitive marker for allosteric modulation of the chloride channel of GABAA receptors, to purified rat cerebrocortical synaptosomal membranes in the absence of GABA. This trivalent cation effect appeared to reflect a specific and direct interaction with GABAA receptors, and could not be mimicked by divalent metal ions including Ca2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Sr2+, Mg2+ and Mn2+. On the other hand, Zn2+, a known allosteric regulator of GABAA receptors, inhibited TBPS binding, but its presence could not prevent stimulation of TBPS binding by La3+. We further examined the lanthanide binding site by monitoring La3(+)-induced changes in TBPS binding. La3+ reduced the Kd for TBPS without affecting Bmax. Stimulation of TBPS by La3+ was not additive with the increased TBPS binding induced by other agonists, including GABA (at nanomolar concentrations), neurosteroids or benzodiazepines (in the absence of GABA). GABA at micromolar concentrations inhibited TBPS binding and its inhibitory effect was potentiated by neurosteroids and benzodiazepines, but not by La3+. Thus, GABA, in the presence of La3+, inhibited TBPS binding in a monophasic manner with a Hill coefficient of approximately 2 and an IC50 of 6 microM. In the absence of La3+, the dose-response profile for GABA became biphasic with an appearance of a stimulatory phase at concentrations of GABA lower than 1 microM. Analysis of the initial stimulation yielded a Hill coefficient of 1 and an EC50 of 88 nM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "This is the first report showing, in an in vivo study, that systemic morphine produced a marked (89%, P < 0.01) increase of the cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) immunoreactivity in the perfusate of the rat spinal cord, an effect completely reversed by naloxone. Since CCK-8 has been shown to possess potent anti-opioid activity at a spinal level, a blockade of the spinal cholecystokinin effect would be expected to potentiate opiate analgesia. With tail flick latency as a nociceptive index, it was found that intrathecal (i.t.) injection of a novel CCKB antagonist L-365,260 produced a marked potentiation of the analgesic effect induced by the mu-opioid agonists morphine (4 mg/kg s.c.) or ohmefentanyl (32 ng i.t.). Similar effects were obtained with the CCKA antagonist devazepide at a dose 40-50 times higher than that of L-365,260. Both devazepide and L-365,260 showed a bell-shaped dose-response curve. The results confirm the notion that an increased release of CCK-8 may constitute a self-limiting process for opioid effects at the spinal level, and that it is the CCKB receptor which mediates the anti-opioid effect of CCK-8 in the rat spinal cord.", 
    "27": "The clinical efficacy of a combination of medetomidine, butorphanol and midazolam for anaesthesia in dogs, and its reversal by atipamezole, was evaluated in two experimental groups of four adult beagle dogs and compared with a control group of four dogs receiving only midazolam and butorphanol. The anaesthetic procedure was used for surgical procedures in another group of 14 dogs. After the injection of medetomidine, a rapid loss of coordination followed by mild sedation was observed. Anaesthesia was attained 2 +/- 1 minutes after the administration of butorphanol and midazolam and lasted 82 +/- 5 minutes, the dogs recovered 51 +/- 6 minutes later and there were no side effects. Analgesia and skeletal muscle relaxation were optimal throughout the period of anaesthesia. Statistically significant bradycardia and hypothermia were observed but there were no significant effects on respiratory function. After atipamezole the dogs recovered their normal posture, heart rate and body temperature in less than 20 minutes. In the control group, the short-lived light sedation was accompanied by inadequate analgesia and poor muscle relaxation. In the surgical group, no differences, except in drug requirements, were recorded in comparison with the experimental groups. Good analgesia and muscle relaxation, total absence of side effects and stability in vital body functions were observed. The injection of atipamezole was always effective, devoid of side effects and induced recovery in less than 20 minutes.", 
    "28": "In young hamsters, a single injection of the short-acting benzodiazepine, triazolam, can induce permanent phase shifts in the circadian clock, while repeated injections of triazolam entrain the circadian clock to the period of the injections. Triazolam appears to act on the circadian clock by inducing an acute increase in the activity of the animals, which in turn phase-shifts the circadian clock. Surprisingly, single injections of benzodiazepines do not phase-shift the activity rhythm of old hamsters, despite the fact that such treatment induces similar acute changes in the activity state of young and old animals. We compared the entraining effects of repeated injections of triazolam on the circadian clock of young and old hamsters; while six out of seven young hamsters were entrained to the triazolam injections, only one out of seven old animals was entrained by this treatment. Three of the remaining six old hamsters showed a lengthening of the activity rhythm, while no consistent effect on the period of the activity rhythm was observed in the remaining three old animals. These results indicate that the circadian system of old hamsters becomes selectively unresponsive to synchronizing signals mediated by the activity-rest state, and suggest that aging is associated with a weakened coupling between the activity-rest cycle and the circadian clock.", 
    "29": "Glutamate excitotoxicity is mediated by both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor and non-NMDA receptor (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)/kainate (KA)) mechanisms but the lack of specific antagonists has limited the characterization of AMPA/KA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. The 2,3-benzodiazepine GYKI 52466 is a newly described non-competitive AMPA/KA receptor antagonist. We have investigated the neuroprotective efficacy of GYKI 52466 in an embryonic rat hippocampal culture model of non-NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity using KA as an agonist at the AMPA/KA receptor. Overnight treatment with 500 microM KA resulted in prominent neuronal excitotoxicity as assessed by lactate dehydrogenase efflux. GYKI 52466 attenuated KA excitotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 9 microM. Together with competitive antagonists (e.g., various quinoxalinediones), non-competitive antagonists like GYKI 52466 can now be used to dissect mechanisms of non-NMDA receptor mediated excitotoxicity.", 
    "30": "The effects of divalent and trivalent cations on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced chloride current were studied with rat dorsal root ganglion neurons in primary culture using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Lanthanum (La3+) reversibly potentiated the GABA-induced current with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 231 microM and the maximal potentiation to about 300% of control. La3+ did not seem to compete with chlordiazepoxide, pentobarbital or picrotoxin for binding sites, which indicated that the La3+ binding site was distinct from any of the benzodiazepine, barbiturate and picrotoxin binding sites on the GABA receptor-channel complex. Copper (Cu2+) reversibly suppressed the current induced by GABA with an EC50 of 19 microM in a non-competitive manner. Zinc (Zn2+) and Cu2+ had a very similar action on GABA response in terms of potency and efficacy. The degree of suppression of GABA-induced current by Cu2+ and Zn2+ was not affected by La3+, whereas Cu2+ antagonized the blocking action of Zn2+ in a concentration-dependent manner. Therefore, La3+ does not interfere with the binding site(s) for Cu2+ and Zn2+, whereas Cu2+ and Zn2+ may share a common site. These results are consistent with the presence of at least two distinct binding sites for polyvalent cations on the GABA-receptor channel complex: one for positive regulation by La3+ and the other for negative regulation by Cu2+ and Zn2+. These two sites are likely to be located at or near the external orifice of the chloride channel.", 
    "31": "Benzodiazepines are primarily used for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, insomnia and status epilepticus. These drugs can also be useful in hyperaroused states, catatonic stupor, manic episodes, and akathisia. This paper will review indications for their use in various psychotic conditions.", 
    "32": "Combined effects of adrenergic and intravenous anesthetic agents on phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover were studied using rat liver prisms incubated with [3H]myo-inositol. Rat liver prisms responded to epinephrine, norepinephrine and phenylephrine dose-dependently with an increase in inositol monophosphate (IP1) formation but they did not respond to ephedrine. Dopamine-induced effects were seen only at concentrations as high as 10(-4) mol.l-1. The enhancement of IP1 formation induced by epinephrine was potentiated by thiamylal at concentrations of 10(-5) mol.l-1 and 10(-4) mol.l-1, remained unaffected by ketamine, fentanyl or midazolam, but was dose-dependently inhibited by droperidol. The present results from in vitro studies of liver cell metabolism suggest that alpha-adrenergic agents in combination with barbiturates may potentiate liver cell damage by activation of PI turnover and interrelated intracellular Ca++ accumulation.", 
    "33": "The literature concerning the interactions between volatile anaesthetics, nitrous oxide and other compounds is reviewed. The majority are well known and most can be managed by careful dosage of the anaesthetics. The following interactions should be stressed since these are less predictable or potentially fatal. Of the cardiovascular drugs mainly the Ca++ channel blockers require attention. The volatile anaesthetics act synergistically with these drugs on the inhibition of cardiac conduction and may induce cardiac arrest. Aminoglycoside therapy should prompt an alternative to enflurane because of increased nephrotoxicity with this combination. Thiopentone induction makes the dog heart more susceptible to arrhythmias, especially during anaesthesia with volatile anaesthetics. Probably pentobarbitone, etomidate or a benzodiazepine should be preferred as an alternative to thiopentone when the use of adrenergic drugs peroperatively is anticipated. Nitrous oxide augments the sequelae after coronary air emboli and impaired cerebral perfusion in animals. The necessity of this drug should therefore be considered when anaesthetizing patients undergoing open heart surgery and patients with severe carotid or cerebral arteriosclerosis.",

In practice, SOL can be quantified easily on the basis of visual examination. We have developed a computer algorithm allowing an automatic estimation of this parameter. The agreement between both strategies, visual and computer analysis, was tested using data from a pharmacological sleep study with 16 elderly insomniacs, which was aimed at comparing the effects of lormetazepam and zopiclone on polysomnography. A high correlation was found between the visual and the computer-based determination of SOL. Drug-related differences in SOL could be shown with both approaches.",

Depletion of some free amino acids was observed in the lymphocytes (mixed T- and B-lymphocytes) and PMN leukocytes (91-95%) neutrophils especially after chronic DZ-treatment. A dose-dependent depletion in the lymphocyte amino acids, Tau, Gly, Ala, Met and Ile, was found after both acute and chronic DZ-treatment. A similar depletion of Tau, Asp, Glu and Met appeared in the PMN leukocytes after single doses as well as chronic DZ-treatment. These results suggest that administration of 1.0-8.0 mg/kg of DZ in single dose or after chronic administration may interfere with the transport of certain important amino acids and/or protein turnover in PB lymphocytes and PMN leukocytes. On the other hand, the basic amino acids Lys, His and Arg were significantly increased in PMN leukocytes after chronic administration of 1.0 mg/kg DZ. It was suggested that the increased levels of the basic amino acids in the neutrophils may interact with the intracellular changes in pH that normally accompany the respiratory burst.", 
    "44": "The steady-state plasma concentrations of mianserin and its major active metabolite, desmethylmianserin, were measured in 76 depressed patients receiving 30 mg of mianserin at bedtime. There were considerable inter-individual variations in the steady-state plasma concentrations of these compounds; the plasma concentrations of mianserin plus desmethylmianserin were within the therapeutic range suggested previously by us in only 43% of the patients. With advancing age, the plasma concentrations of mianserin increased significantly, while those of mianserin plus desmethylmianserin remained unchanged. Sex, smoking, and coadministration of benzodiazepines did not affect the drug's metabolism. There was no evidence that the kinetics of these compounds were nonlinear with increasing doses. The present study thus suggests that measuring the plasma concentrations of mianserin and desmethylmianserin contributes to rational treatment with this drug, that age, sex, smoking, and coadministration of benzodiazepines are not important factors in determining the dose, and that these compounds have linear kinetics.", 
    "45": "In a double-blind crossover study, the pharmacokinetics and effects on night-time respiration and body movements of midazolam 7.5 mg, flunitrazepam 1 mg, and placebo were studied in 5 elderly insomniac patients with the static charge sensitive bed-method (SCSB). In a supine position, the gastrointestinal absorption rate of flunitrazepam (tmax 0.6 h) was faster than that of midazolam (tmax 0.95 h). The elimination phase half-life of midazolam was about twice as long as reported earlier in healthy adult volunteers, but ageing did not affect the elimination of flunitrazepam. The shape of the serum concentration-time curve of both benzodiazepine derivatives was quite similar. The sleep of these five insomniacs became more peaceful and the respiration more regular during midazolam and flunitrazepam, compared with placebo. Both benzodiazepines significantly decreased body movements and the cumulative movement time remained shorter throughout the night, compared with placebo. Total variability (VI) was clearly decreased with flurazepam, and a similar but not statistically significant tendency was seen with midazolam, compared with placebo. Accordingly, the proportion of quiet sleep (QS) increased (p = 0.014) and the proportion of active sleep (AS) decreased (p = 0.019) with both benzodiazepines, compared with placebo. This reflects the changed control of respiration by higher brain structures. No signs of increased respiratory resistance (i.e. ballistocardiographic respiratory amplitude variation BRV < 60%) were seen with either of the drugs or placebo. There were no differences in the subjects' own estimation of their sleep during medication with these drugs. Only the sleep onset latency was shorter with flunitrazepam compared with midazolam and placebo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

For a period of two years, a prospective collection of data on 692 psychiatric consultations showed that 60% of all consultations came from internal medicine departments. Medical and psychiatric comorbidity was found in 50% of the patients; depression was diagnosed in 27.5% of the cases but schizophrenia in only 1.7%. Suicidal ideation was reported by 24% of the patients, 11.6% of them wishing to die imminently. More than 50% of suicidal patients were under 35 years of age; 42% of them were dependent on alcohol. Almost 30% of the patients seen in consultation admitted to being addicted to alcohol, 22% to benzodiazepines and 14% to illicit drugs. Among the ex-alcoholic patients, a significant dependence in benzodiazepine use was found. The patients with addictions to street drug had a greater suicide risk and were at the same time abusing alcohol.

Protein free and protein containing (albumin 10 g litre-1) buffers were used to examine the effect of the anaesthetics on enzyme activity and diazepam binding to albumin. Both anaesthetics (in concentrations of 0.5, 1.5 and 3.0 mmol litre-1) reduced the elimination of diazepam slightly in the absence of albumin, while the presence of the protein increased elimination to a maximum of 30% at the greatest concentration of the anaesthetics. These data support previous observations that volatile anaesthetics may interact pharmacokinetically with both liver enzyme activity and drug binding to albumin.",

Metabolic effects of sedation were assessed using a Deltatrac metabolic monitor. Initiation of sedation induced a 25% decrease in VO2 in both groups. The decrease was about 40% at 16 h. VO2 increased within 30 min after discontinuation of propofol and stabilized at values considerably less than the immediate postoperative value. A similar but slower increase was noted with flunitrazepam. While the propofol loading dose reduced the Buffington index and should therefore be avoided, no cardiovascular side effects were noted with the maintenance infusion. Weaning from ventilatory support was achieved within 15 (2) min and 264 (108) min after discontinuation of propofol and flunitrazepam, respectively.",

    "53": "1. Cholecystokinin (CCK) has been shown to diminish opioid analgesia. Here we investigate whether changes in the physiological levels of spinal CCK are responsible for the enhanced potency of spinal morphine in animals following carrageenin inflammation, as compared with normal animals. 2. Single dorsal horn nociceptive neurones were recorded in intact halothane-anaesthetized rats in the presence and absence of carrageenin-induced inflammation and comparisons were made between the two groups of animals. Inflammation was induced by the injection of 100 microliters of 2% lambda-carrageenin into the hind paw. 3. The inhibitory effect of intrathecal morphine on the C-fibre-evoked responses of the neurones was enhanced in the carrageenin-treated animals such that the effects of 0.25 microgram and 10 micrograms of morphine in normal animals were comparable to those of 0.01 microgram and 2.5 micrograms in the carrageenin animals. The effect of 0.2 mg kg-1 of the CCKB antagonist, L-365,260, on the antinociceptive potency of intrathecal morphine was examined in both groups of animals. In normal animals, L-365,260 produced a significant enhancement in the effect of morphine indicating a tonic CCK modulation in these animals, but it had no effect on the inhibitions produced by either dose of morphine in the carrageenin animals. 4. The inhibition of the C-fibre-evoked response produced by intrathecal morphine in the presence of 1 microgram of CCK was examined in both groups of animals. CCK attenuated the effects of morphine only in animals with carrageenin inflammation, having no effect on the action of morphine in normal animals. 5. The effects of both CCK and L-365,260 were therefore dependent on the inflammatory state of the animal, with each drug being active in opposite situations.6. We propose that in normal animals, morphine may produce a maximal stimulation of the release of CCK such that exogenous CCK is unable to reduce further the analgesic effects under these conditions.However, the differential effects of the agonist and antagonist in the normal and inflamed rats points to a role of CCK in the enhanced opiate actions. This enhancement of the potency of spinal morphine in inflammation is best explained by a reduction in spinal CCK release by morphine in this state.",

Virginiamycin, a macrolide reported to bind selectively to CCKB/gastrin receptors has been studied in a functional test, namely cholecystokinin-induced contraction of guinea-pig ileum myenteric plexus (LMMP). 2. Virginiamycin (1-10 microM) antagonized the selective CCKB agonist cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4). The antagonism appeared not to be competitive as the highest concentration (10 microM) caused a reduction of its maximal effect. An apparent pA2 of 6.64 +/- 0.06 (s.e.) could be estimated if this depression was ignored. The selective CCKB antagonist, L-365,260 (0.01-0.3 microM) antagonized competitively the CCK-4 induced contraction and a pKB of 8.60 +/- 0.16 (s.e.) was estimated. 3. The combined dose-ratio analysis for virginiamycin, tested at 3 and 10 microM in association with 0.03 and 0.1 microM L-365,260, respectively, resulted in observed log dose-ratios of 1.39 and 1.53. That was consistent with both antagonists acting on the same receptor in LMMP. 4. These data, represent the first evidence of the antagonism of virginiamycin in a functional assay and they support the hypothesis of homogeneity between CCKB receptors in the CNS and in peripheral tissues.",

Nine IOP measurements were taken in each patient starting before premedication and ending 3 min after endotracheal intubation. In both groups, there was a decrease in IOP after induction of anesthesia with thiopental and alfentanil. Succinylcholine administration and endotracheal intubation had no further effect on IOP in the clonidine group.

The aims of the study were to determine the pharmacokinetics of ketamine and evaluate the suitability of ketamine as an analgesic and sedative in postoperative pediatric cardiac patients. The children were between one week and 30 months old. Five children were given 1 mg/kg/h of ketamine and five children had 2 mg/kg/h. Blood was sampled during infusion and up to 24 hours after infusion for plasma concentrations of ketamine and the main plasma metabolite, norketamine, which were determined by gas chromatography and were compared to the degree of sedation. The children were arousable when ketamine concentrations were below 1.0 to 1.5 micrograms/mL. Plasma ketamine concentrations at steady state were within a narrow range for each infusion regimen and the calculated pharmacokinetic parameters were similar. Mean plasma clearance of ketamine was 0.94 +/- 0.22 L/kg/h. The elimination half-life was 3.1 +/- 1.6 hours, but in some children late samples indicated an even longer elimination half-life. Norketamine did not reach a steady state, but at the end of the infusion, the mean plasma concentration was higher than that of ketamine. The elimination half-life of norketamine was estimated to be 6.0 +/- 1.8 hours.

We asked 67 consecutive patients who presented for elective ambulatory surgery at a university medical center to volunteer for serum and urine testing with the assurance of confidentiality. All patients denied nonprescription drug use. Initial testing was for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and alcohol. Of the 64 patients who agreed to be tested, 16 patients tested positive for at least one of the above substances; 4 patients demonstrated residua of 2 or 3 substances. No distinctive characteristic of those with evidence of drug use could be identified. We believe that the 25% of patients who tested positive in this group is a conservative estimate of possible unrecognized drug use.

    "65": "Both gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) can stimulate pepsinogen release from chief cells, but controversy exists about the receptors or intracellular mediators involved. In the present study, we prepared isolated chief cells from guinea pig stomach (> 90% pure) to investigate the ability of gastrin and CCK to alter cell function. The COOH-terminal octapeptide of CCK (CCK-8) caused an eightfold increase in pepsinogen release (EC50, 54 nM). Both CCK-8 and gastrin increased inositol phosphates, with CCK-8 (1 microM) and gastrin (3 microM) causing a 40- and 14-fold increase in [3H]IP1, 10- and 6-fold for [3H]IP2, and 8- and 4-fold for [3H]IP3. CCK-8 caused a half-maximal increase in [3H]IP3 at 2 nM, and the dose-response curve was monophasic, whereas with gastrin the curve was biphasic, with an EC50 of the initial component (20% maximal) at 38 nM and the second component at 10 microM. L-364,718 (0.1 microM) inhibited the secondary increase seen with gastrin concentrations > 10 nM. The CCK-A-selective agonist A-71378 was 85-90% as efficacious as CCK-8 and was equally potent. With 0.1 microM L-364,718, A-71378 caused no increase in [3H]inositol phosphates until > 10 nM, whereas CCK-8 caused 15% of maximal increase at concentrations > 0.3 nM. Similar results were obtained with cytosolic calcium measured using fura-2 or on CCK-8- or gastrin-stimulated pepsinogen release. These results demonstrate that gastrin and CCK-8 can alter chief cell function by interacting with either a CCK-A or CCK-B/gastrin receptor. Both receptors are coupled to phospholipase C and cause changes in inositol phosphates, cytosolic calcium, and pepsinogen release; however, the intracellular amplification differs between the two receptor subtypes. Activation by CCK-related peptides of the CCK-A receptor subtype accounts for 85-90% of the maximal changes in cellular function, and activation of the CCK-B/gastrin receptor accounts for 10-20% of maximal changes.", 
    "66": "The effect of guanidinoethanesulfonic acid (GES) on rat electrocorticograms (ECoG) and the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and GABA-agonists on the ECoG changes induced by GES were studied. Sporadic spike discharges began 2-5 min after 1 mumol GES/10 microliters on filter paper was applied to the pia mater of the left sensorimotor cortex; spike discharges extended to the opposite cerebral hemisphere 60 min after the onset of the ipsilateral spike discharges. The spike discharges with a frequency of 5-10 spikes/min lasted until the end of the 4 hour recording. The induced spike discharges were suppressed when the original GES soaked filter paper was replaced by one containing GES (1 mumol) supplement combined with taurine (1 mumol/10 microliters). GABA (1 mumol) and its receptor agonist, muscimol (10 nmol) and (3R)-(-)-4-amino-3-hydroxybutyric acid (1 mumol) also suppressed the GES-induced spike discharges when applied topically. Diazepam (DZP) (10 mg/kg) suppressed the GES-induced spike discharges 10 min after i.p. injection, but phenobarbital (20 mg/kg) increased the frequency and voltage of spike discharges 100 min following subcutaneous administration. Intraperitoneal injection of either valproate (200 mg/kg) or phenytoin (25 mg/kg), after the completion of the spike discharges, showed no effect. These findings suggest that neurotransmission or neuromodulatory effects of taurine participate in GES-induced seizure activity, and that GABAA and DZP receptors may play a role in the mechanism that suppresses GES-induced seizures.", 
    "67": "Baboons were given continuous intragastric infusions of 100 mg/kg/day of pentobarbital before and during these experiments. The baboons responded under a fixed-ratio (FR) 30-response schedule of food presentation from 10:00 A.M. of one day to 8:00 A.M. of the next day. Terminating pentobarbital administration (i.e., substituting water for pentobarbital) from 8:00 A.M. of one day to 8:00 A.M. of the next day produced large decreases in the number of pellets earned. Repeated 24-h terminations of pentobarbital administration at 1-week intervals produced similar decreases in the pellets earned. In another experiment, the effects of terminating pentobarbital administration for several days were examined. The number of pellets earned decreased within 2 h of terminating pentobarbital administration was maximally suppressed during the first day, and recovered over 3 to 5 days. When different doses of pentobarbital were substituted for 24 h, the disruption of responding seen after pentobarbital termination was attenuated in a dose-dependent manner. In another experiment, the effects of substituting lorazepam, ethanol or chlorpromazine for pentobarbital for 24 h were examined. Lorazepam produced a dose-dependent attenuation of the effects of pentobarbital termination, whereas ethanol did not. Chlorpromazine did not attenuate the effects of pentobarbital termination in two of the three baboons tested, and produced erratic results in the third.",

ND and parent OX have similar pharmacokinetic profiles. Steady-state plasma levels of ND and OX cannot be predicted from single-dose pharmacokinetics. Reduced plasma clearance of ND and altered plasma protein binding were observed in dogs physically dependent upon ND. The benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, significantly reduces steady-state plasma levels of total and free ND.", 
    "70": "The effect of infantile handling stimulation and/or perinatal flumazenil (Ro 15-1788; a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist; 3.7 mg/kg/day) administration on exploratory and emotional-related behavior was investigated using adult females from the Roman high- and low-avoidance (RHA/Verh and RLA/Verh) lines. When rats (6 months old) were exposed to a hexagonal tunnel maze including an illuminated central arena, it was found that RHA/Verh rats were more active, explored more maze area, showed more outward preference, and more frequently entered the illuminated center than RLA/Verh rats. In addition, postnatal stimulation decreased emotional-related behavior in both lines of rats, as expressed by increased entry into, and time spent in, the central arena. Perinatal flumazenil treatment decreased entry into the maze central arena in both rat lines but this effect was counteracted by postnatal (handling) stimulation. Thus, the present study extends to adult RHA/Verh and RLA/Verh rats the positive long-lasting effects of postnatal handling and shows postnatal handling x flumazenil interactions in some behavioral parameters related to the pattern of exploration and exploratory efficiency.", 
    "71": "A rapid, simple, stability-indicating assay procedure for otilonium bromide, a smooth muscle relaxant agent, and diazepam in composite tablet analysis was developed with high-performance liquid chromatography. The tablet matrix was dissolved with water, and drugs were extracted with acetonitrile containing an internal standard. An aliquot was centrifuged and chromatographed on a 5-microns, reversed-phase column with 0.5 M sodium acetate trihydrate buffer containing 5 mM 1-heptanesulfonic acid monohydrate sodium salt:methanol (30:70; v/v; adjusted to pH 6.0 with glacial acetic acid) as the mobile phase. The selectivity of the chromatographic system was demonstrated by resolving both compounds from various potential degradation products of each compound. The method is linear, quantitative, and reproducible.", 
    "72": "While flumazenil reverses benzodiazepine-induced sedation, its ability to antagonize the ventilatory depressant effects of benzodiazepines has not been fully established. A randomized, double-blind study was conducted to determine whether flumazenil effectively reverses midazolam-induced depression of the hypoxic ventilatory response.", 
    "73": "Twelve healthy male volunteers received intravenous midazolam 0.12 +/- 0.01 mg.kg-1 followed by either flumazenil 1.0 mg or placebo. Hypoxic ventilatory response was measured using an isocapnic rebreathing technique: as Spo2 decreased to 70% VE and tidal volume were continuously recorded. Hypoxic response determinations were performed before and after midazolam, as well as 3, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min after flumazenil or placebo.", 
    "74": "After midazolam, the slope of the hypoxic ventilatory response curve (VE vs. SpO2) decreased to 0.59 +/- 0.05 (means +/- SE) times its premidazolam baseline; likewise, at Spo2 = 90%, minute ventilation (VE90) and tidal volume (TV90) decreased to 0.70 +/- 0.04 and 0.62 +/- 0.03 times baseline, respectively. Three minutes after flumazenil, the slope increased to 1.10 +/- 0.13 times baseline (P < 0.05 vs. postmidazolam), while following placebo, it was only 0.81 +/- 0.09 times baseline (P = NS vs. postmidazolam, P < 0.05 between treatments). VE90 and TV90, after flumazenil, increased to 1.45 +/- 0.15 and 1.27 +/- 0.09 times baseline, respectively (P < 0.05 vs. postmidazolam); these increases were significantly greater than the corresponding changes observed after placebo (P < 0.05 between treatments).", 
    "75": "It was concluded that, after sedation with midazolam, flumazenil causes a greater increase in hypoxic ventilatory response during isohypercarbic conditions than does placebo, and may, therefore, be useful in the treatment of midazolam-induced ventilatory depression.", 
    "76": "Zolpidem is a rapid-onset, short-duration imidazopyridine hypnotic drug and is specific agonist of the omega-1 (BZD1) receptors. Its hypnotic characteristics resemble those of triazolam. The aims of this study were to assess the effects of zolpidem on memory (the main objective), psychomotor performances, and postural sway (secondary objectives) in 18 healthy subjects and to compare them with those of triazolam and placebo. Short- and long-term memory (paired words associate and pictures test), psychomotor performances (critical flicker fusion frequency, choice reaction time, digit symbol substitution test), and postural sway were evaluated before and 1.5, 4, 6, and 8 h after the administration of a single dose of zolpidem (10 mg), triazolam (0.25 mg), and placebo. For each assessment, the maximal effect for both hypnotic drugs occurred 1.5 hour after intake. Both drugs decreased psychomotor performance, impaired memory, and increased postural sway. The effects of both hypnotic agents were short lasting, and no alterations were found 6 and 8 hours, respectively, after drug intake. No clinically relevant differences were found between zolpidem and triazolam for memory, psychomotor performance, postural sway, or adverse effects. It may be concluded that zolpidem, like triazolam, impairs short- and long-term memory, psychomotor performances, and postural sway and that these effects are of short duration.", 
    "77": "The prolactin-releasing effects of buspirone, an azaspirodecanedione anxiolytic drug unrelated to the benzodiazepines in structure and pharmacologic properties, was examined in developing and adult male and female rats. The possibility that effects of this drug on hormone release could be modulated by neonatal brain sexual differentiation was also evaluated. A single injection of buspirone, 2 or 10 mg/kg body wt, increased serum prolactin (PRL) levels in both sexes; the increase was significant from Day 12 onward. The PRL-releasing effect increased with age. No significant sexual differences were observed in younger rats, but in peripubertal and adult animals, the hyperprolactinemic response was higher in the female. Neonatal androgenization of females or orchidectomy of males failed to modify the PRL-releasing action of buspirone. Serum titers of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone were not modified by buspirone at any age. The present results show for the first time the ontogeny of the PRL-releasing effect of buspirone in male and female rats, and provide evidence that the response is higher in the female and that the effect does not depend on brain sexual differentiation.", 
    "78": "This pilot randomized study compared MDL 72,222, a highly selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, with a high-dose metoclopramide regimen (HDM) for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. MDL 72,222 was given in 20 mg intravenous doses 30 minutes before chemotherapy, as well as 2, 6, and 12 hours after chemotherapy infusion. The HDM was composed of diphenhydramine 50 mg i.v., metoclopramide 2 mg/kg i.v., and lorazepam 0.04 mg/kg i.v. administered 30 minutes before chemotherapy and 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to either MDL 72,222 (n = 12) or the HDM (n = 12) and were matched for age, weight, Karnofsky performance status, and chemotherapy. More patients in the MDL 72,222 group had received prior cisplatin. The MDL 72,222 group and the HDM group received a mean cisplatin dose of 66 mg/m2 and 62 mg/m2, respectively. Patients were observed for retching and/or emesis for 24 hours and completed a visual analog scale (VAS) for nausea. Six MDL 72,222 and five HDM patients had no vomiting. One MDL 72,222 and two HDM patients had one episode of emesis within 24 hours of chemotherapy. The median number of emetic episodes in the first 24 hours was 0.5 for MDL 72,222 and 1.0 for HDM patients. HDM patients were frequently asleep and were not awakened for evaluation of nausea with the VAS; 58% (70 of 120) of the HDM (mean score: 19.1 mm) and 14% (17 of 119) of the MDL 72,222 (mean score: 17.1) patients could not have VAS scores obtained (X2 = 50.74, p < 0.001). MDL 72,222 had similar efficacy with less sedation, and further trials are warranted.", 
    "79": "Post surgical stress ulcers of the upper digestive tract, once developed, is difficult to control depending on the primary disease and associated complications. As to the cause of postoperative stress ulcers, decreased defensive factors such as gastric mucosal blood flow and increased gastric secretions have been pointed out. Recently, pirenzepine hydrochloride has been shown to be a specific antagonist of muscarinic cholinergic M1 receptors and a suppressant of gastric acid secretion. Therefore we studied its effect on gastric secretions in postoperative patients. Twenty one patients admitted for abdominal surgery, excluding gastric surgery, were selected and randomly assigned to the pirenzepine group (10 cases) or control group (11 cases). Since the serum half life of pirenzepine is 10 hours, 20mg of pirenzepine was administered intravenously immediately after the operation and twice daily (9 a.m. and 9 p.m.) from postoperative day 1 until day 7. Gastric secretions and gastric pH were measured preoperatively and daily until day 7. In the control group, significant increases in the volume of secretion and significant decreases in gastric pH were observed after the operation. In contrast, the pirenzepine group had a significantly decreased amount of gastric secretion and the gastric pH was higher than those in the control group. Thus we conclude that pirenzepine decreases gastric secretion and increases gastric pH in postoperative patients. Pirenzepine can be regarded as an effective agent for the control of postoperative gastric hypersecretion and possibly a good prophylactic for postoperative stress ulcers.", 
    "80": "The memory enhancing properties of sabeluzole nad flunarizine were evaluated in two experimental paradigms in male rats. First, we studied the protective action of both drugs against a chlordiazepoxide-induced impairment of habituation. Sabeluzole (5 or 25 mg/kg) or flunarizine (10 mg/kg) were administered sc 1 hr before and chlordiazepoxide (20 mg/kg) immediately after the acquisition session. In the retention session 72 hr later, chlordiazepoxide treated animals displayed higher locomotor and exploratory activities and this effect was blocked by pretreatment with sabeluzole or flunarizine. The results suggest that both drugs prevented amnesic effect of chlordiazepoxide. The second paradigm was the social memory test in which the time spent in social investigation behaviour toward a familiar or a novel juvenile conspecific was used to measure the duration of the memory that the animal forms of the juvenile. Sabeluzole (25 mg/kg) or flunarizine (3 mg/kg) were injected to the adults immediately after the initial exposure. Reexposure to the same or a novel juvenile was done 2 hr later. In contrast to controls, sabeluzole-treated animals showed a significant reduction in social investigation during reexposure to the same juvenile. Since there was no effect on investigation of a novel juvenile, results suggest that sabeluzole-treated rats are able to remember longer the individual characteristics of juvenile rats obtained through olfactory cues during a short social interaction. The time spent by adults treated with flunarizine in the investigation the same juvenile during reexposure was similar to that observed during the initial exposure. It means that flunarizine was ineffective in enhancing short-term olfactory memory.",

    "82": "Benzodiazepines (BZs), which have been marketed by pharmaceutical companies since the sixties, are the most commonly prescribed psychotropic drugs. Diazepam, the prototype of this class of drugs, has a vast spectrum of therapeutic indications. It possesses, over a narrow dose-range, the well-known neuropsychopharmacological profile consisting of anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, and muscle relaxant effects, and CNS depression. Recently, BZ ligands that retain anxiolytic and antiepileptic properties at doses that are unable to produce a CNS depression have been developed. The pharmacological profiles of these drugs are discussed in light of: the heterogeneity of the structure of the GABAA receptor complex; intrinsic efficacy of the ligand; action of the BZ ligand on the mitochondrial BZ receptor.", 
    "83": "Benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor binding in the brain was determined in five chronic alcohol-dependent men and in five healthy male control subjects using [11C]flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) and positron emission tomography (PET). Magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate brain anatomy and pathology, and to define regions of interest in the brain. [11C]Flumazenil binding was quantified by applying a saturation procedure with two PET experiments, the first with high (400-3400 Ci/mmol) and the second with low (approximately 1 Ci/mmol) specific radioactivity. Radioactivity in the pons was taken as an estimate of free and nonspecifically bound radioligand. Equilibrium was defined to prevail when the derivative of specific binding (dCb(t)/dt) was equal to zero. The values were used in a Scatchard analysis for determination of the maximum density of binding sites (Bmax) and the equilibrium binding constant (Kd). The mean values of Bmax and Kd were about the same in the two groups, but the Bmax variance for the alcoholics was significantly greater for all regions of interest as compared with the healthy volunteers. The results may indicate that chronic alcohol consumption has multiple effects on the BZ receptor complex.", 
    "84": "Muscarinic receptors present in cultured human iris sphincter and ciliary smooth muscle cells were characterized by both ligand ([3H]QNB binding) and functional (phosphoinositide hydrolysis) studies. Ligand binding studies showed that [3H]QNB represented a single population of binding sites with KD values of 4.02 x 10(-11) M in the ciliary and 5.6 x 10(-11) M in the iris sphincter cells. In competition studies, the selective antagonist, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine-methobromide (4-DAMP) was the most potent in displacing [3H]QNB with selectivity of 150-350-fold over pirenzepine (M1) and 450-1700-fold over AF-DX 116 (M2). 4-DAMP recognized one site in the iris sphincter cells (Ki = 0.34 nM) but two sites in the ciliary cells (KH = 0.9 nM and KL = 49 nM). 4-DAMP was also the most potent in inhibiting carbachol-induced hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids (PI) in both cell types. However, the IC50 values for PI hydrolysis were several fold lower than those for [3H]QNB binding. Using these selective antagonists, our data supports the presence of functional muscarinic receptors of M3 subtype in human iris sphincter and ciliary cells. It also shows the presence of a second low affinity site in the ciliary smooth muscle cells that is recognized by 4-DAMP.", 
    "85": "The allosteric modulation of the progesterone metabolite 3 alpha- hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (DHP) on [3H]Flunitrazepam and [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding was investigated on a soluble receptor preparation. Better results in the solubilization occurred by the use of the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS with the inclusion of the phospholipid asolectin: this treatment was found suitable to study the steroidal modulation on [3H]Flunitrazepam and [35S]TBPS binding. We found that DHP was able to enhance [3H]Flunitrazepam binding in the presence of Cl- ions, while [35S]TBPS binding was inhibited by DHP. Scatchard analysis of specific [35S]TBPS and [3H]Flunitrazepam binding yielded in a single straight line both in the controls and in the presence of the hormone; DHP increased the apparent affinity of [3H]Flunitrazepam binding without altering the apparent Bmax value. In the case of [35S]TBPS, DHP decreased the apparent Bmax value whereas the Kd value remained nearly the same.", 
    "86": "gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) produces absence-like seizures when given to animals. One of the distinguishing characteristics of experimental generalized absence seizures is that they are exacerbated by GABAA agonists. Therefore, the hypothesis that GHB-induced absence seizures result from an interaction between GHB and the GABAA receptor complex was tested. The effect of GHB on the function of various components of the GABAA receptor complex in the cortex of the rat, was determined in a series of in vitro experiments. Similar studies were carried out at various times following systemic administration of the prodrug of GHB, gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) and changes in the GABAA receptor were correlated with electrographic and behavioral changes. gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid had no effect on the binding of [3H]muscimol, [3H]flunitrazepam and [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) or on the uptake of 36Cl- into synaptoneurosomes in the in vitro studies. Nor were changes observed after the administration of GBL before the onset of GHB-induced absence seizures. However, at the onset of GHB-induced spike wave discharge, there was a significant (P < 0.04) decrease in the binding of [35S]TBPS, associated with a significant decrease in muscimol-stimulated uptake of 36Cl- with no other biochemical change. One minute after onset of GHB-induced absence seizure, a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the binding of [3H]muscimol was noted. Ten minutes later the decrease in muscimol-stimulated uptake of 36Cl- had normalized, while the changes in binding of [3H]muscimol and [35S]TBPS persisted. Because GABAA function remained unchanged in the in vitro studies, as well as prior to the onset of GHB-induced absence seizures in the in vivo experiments, these studies do not support the hypothesis that GHB interacts directly with the GABAA receptor complex to produce absence-like seizures.", 
    "87": "Benzodiazepines are pharmacological agents widely used for their anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties. However, as these drugs are known to antagonize the binding and action of thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) in pituitary tissue, the possibility that they may modulate GH secretion was investigated in domestic fowl, in which TRH is a GH-releasing factor. Chlordiazepoxide (an antagonist of central-type benzodiazepine receptors) had no significant effect on the basal release of GH from incubated chicken pituitary glands, but at concentrations > 10 mumol/l chlordiazepoxide suppressed somatotroph responsiveness and sensitivity to TRH stimulation. At this concentration, chlordiazepoxide competitively displaced the binding of [3H]3-methyl-histidine2-TRH ([3H]MeTRH) to chicken pituitary membranes. The prior incubation of pituitary glands with chlordiazepoxide had no significant effect on the number of [3H]MeTRH-binding sites, which were also unaffected by the administration of chlordiazepoxide in vivo. However, contrary to its effects in vitro, chlordiazepoxide reduced basal GH secretion in vivo, whilst potentiating the GH response to systemic TRH challenge. These results demonstrate benzodiazepine antagonism of TRH-binding sites in domestic fowl and a biphasic modulation of GH secretion, which may be mediated through opposing actions at pituitary and central sites.", 
    "88": "The present study was designed to investigate the effects of diazepam, a benzodiazepine (BZ) with high affinity to central BZ receptors and moderate affinity to mitochondrial BZ receptors, and of Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195, ligands specific for mitochondrial BZ receptors, on cardiac function in the isolated working rat heart model. Five concentrations of these drugs (10(-9)-10(-5) mol/l) were used, and the chronotropic (heart rate) and inotropic [maximum elastance of the left ventricle at end systole (Emax), maximal first derivative of left ventricular (LV) pressure (dP/dtmax), LV pressure at dP/dtmax (pressure at dP/dtmax), aortic flow, stroke work, and total pressure-volume area] cardiac parameters were measured. Diazepam, Ro 5-4864, and PK 11195 showed no significant chronotropic activity up to 10(-5) mol/l. Diazepam did not alter the inotropic properties of the heart. Ro 5-4864 at 10(-5) mol/l significantly decreased the indices of contractility, namely, Emax, dP/dtmax, and pressure at dP/dtmax. Aortic flow, stroke work, and total pressure-volume area were significantly depressed at the same concentration. The negative inotropism of PK 11195 appeared to be identical, by most indices, to that of Ro 5-4864, both qualitatively (same pattern) and quantitatively (similar maximal variations); however, for some indices a depressant effect was also found at 10(-7) mol/l. These results show that at high concentrations Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195, but not diazepam, have a depressant effect on mechanical function.", 
    "89": "Disruption of responding for food reinforcement may reflect the motivational state subsequent to the onset of an aversive event and has previously been shown to be sensitive to spontaneous withdrawal from ethanol and precipitated opiate withdrawal. The purpose of this study was to attempt to precipitate ethanol withdrawal with bicuculline methiodide, a competitive GABAA receptor antagonist, and Ro 15-4513, a benzodiazepine inverse agonist. A quantitative operant measure of food-motivated behavior was used to evaluate the reactivity of the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex during chronic ethanol treatment in rats. In the present study, rats were trained to lever-press for food reinforcement on a fixed ratio 15 schedule and then maintained for 2 weeks on a liquid diet containing 35% ethanol-derived calories or a control liquid diet that was prepared isocalorically with sucrose. Chronic ethanol treatment attenuated the disruptive effects on operant responding that were produced by bicuculline methiodide (100 ng ICV) and Ro 15-4513 (3 and 6 mg/kg). The inability of these drugs to \"precipitate\" EtOH withdrawal may reflect the noncompetitive interaction of ethanol with the GABA-benzodiazepine-ionophore receptor complex. These data are consistent with recent biochemical studies indicating that chronic ethanol treatment modulates the GABAA-benzodiazepine-ionophore receptor complex by altering the expression of specific molecular components and inhibiting the activity of the receptor complex.", 
    "90": "Pharmacologic effects in brain caused by systemic administration of neuropeptides are prevented by poor transport of the peptide through the brain vascular endothelium, which comprises the blood-brain barrier in vivo. In the present study, successful application of a chimeric peptide approach to enhance drug delivery through the blood-brain barrier for the purpose of achieving a central nervous system pharmacologic effect is described. The chimeric peptide was formed by linkage of a potent vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) analogue, which had been monobiotinylated, to a drug transport vector. The vector consisted of a covalent conjugate of avidin and the OX26 monoclonal antibody to the transferrin receptor. Owing to the high concentration of transferrin receptors on brain capillary endothelia, OX26 targets brain and undergoes receptor-mediated transcytosis through the blood-brain barrier. Systemic infusion of low doses (12 micrograms/kg) of the VIP chimeric peptide in rats resulted in an in vivo central nervous system pharmacologic effect: a 65% increase in cerebral blood flow. Biotinylated VIP analogue without the brain transport vector was ineffective.", 
    "91": "Angiotensin-II (Ang-II), K+, and ACTH are important stimulators of aldosterone secretion that require Ca2+ influx to be active. However, Ang-II and K+ are linked to the Ca2+ messenger system, while ACTH is coupled to the cAMP pathway. Peripheral-type binding sites for benzodiazepines are particularly abundant in steroidogenic tissues and have been proposed to be involved in the steroidogenic action of ACTH in Y-1 adrenocortical cells. We report here that in adrenal glomerulosa cells, peripheral-type [4'-chlor-diazepam (CDZ), 1-(2-chlorophenyl)N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)3-isoquinolinecarboxamid e (RP 52028), and flunitrazepam], but not a central-type (flumazenil) benzodiazepine reversibly abolished the stimulation of aldosterone output induced by Ang-II or K+, while they had no significant effect on basal aldosterone secretion. This inhibitory effect depended upon drug concentration (IC50 30 microM for CDZ) and affected the potencies of both stimulators, without altering their respective EC50 values. Similar results were obtained when aldosterone production was stimulated with ACTH, forskolin, or (Bu)2cAMP. Aldosterone production from exogenous 25-hydroxycholesterol or progesterone was partially inhibited by CDZ. In glomerulosa cells loaded with a fluorescent Ca2+ probe, benzodiazepines blocked Ca2+ influx triggered by K+ or Ang-II without affecting the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores induced by Ang-II. T- and L-type Ca2+ channel activities, monitored with the patch-clamp technique, were both inhibited within the same range of concentrations as aldosterone synthesis and Ca2+ influx. These results indicate that in adrenal zona glomerulosa cells, peripheral-type benzodiazepines block Ca2+ influx through voltage-activated channels. The combined action of peripheral-type benzodiazepines on calcium influx and precursor conversion may be responsible for the observed inhibition of Ang-II-, K(+)-, or ACTH-induced aldosterone secretion.", 
    "92": "Antisera were produced in rabbits against synthetic peptides based on subtype-specific regions of the cDNA sequences of the alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, and alpha 4 (also termed alpha 5) subunits of mammalian GABAA receptors. The antigen peptides were chosen from the putative cytoplasmic loop between the proposed third and fourth membrane spanning helices; they were not only subtype-specific sequences, but also their hydrophilicity and predicted secondary structures suggested high potential antigenicity. In all cases, antipeptide antisera recognized on western blots the corresponding alpha-subunit polypeptide of the GABAA receptors purified from bovine brain by benzodiazepine-affinity chromatography, and were able to immunoprecipitate binding activity from detergent-solubilized purified receptors. The four antisera each recognized a unique polypeptide, and only one, in the purified receptor, with alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, and alpha 4 identified at 51, 52, 56, and 57 kDa, respectively. This represents the first identification of the alpha 4 gene product on a gel. Both the relative amount of staining in immunoblots and the fraction of receptor binding that could be immunoprecipitated by saturating concentrations of each of the four subtype-specific antibodies varied in a consistent manner between receptors purified from different brain regions. Thus, cerebral cortex receptor contained all four alpha polypeptides on western blots, and significant activity could be precipitated by all four. Hippocampal receptor lacked alpha 3 immunoreactivity on blotting and by immunoprecipitation; alpha 1 was less, whereas both alpha 2 and alpha 4 were more abundant in hippocampus than in cortex by both techniques. Cerebellum receptor contained only alpha 1 of the four alpha subunits tested, and the anti-alpha 1 antibodies immunoprecipitated > 90% of the binding activity. The variable amounts of staining and immunoprecipitation from the three brain areas by the four antisera demonstrate the presence of heterooligomeric receptor complexes with different alpha-subunit constituents in cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. The sum of cortical receptor activity precipitated individually by the four anti-alpha antisera was > 150%, indicating that some heterooligomers are likely to contain more than one class of alpha subtype, although most receptor complexes probably contain only one alpha subtype. These alpha-subunit subtype-specific antibodies should be useful in analyzing structure, function, and localization of GABAA/benzodiazepine receptors in mammalian brain.", 
    "93": "Monitoring anticonvulsant drugs may be unnecessary for many patients except those in high-risk groups such as those with metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and history of past drug reactions. Several studies reviewed kinetic differences between children and adults. Plasma carnitine is often reduced by administration of anticonvulsants, although the clinical significance of this is uncertain. Midazolam and analgesics such as fentanyl have become popular for sedation for pediatric procedures. Several studies reviewed safety and kinetics of this method of sedation. The midazolam decreases memory for the procedure and reduces anticipatory anxiety. Several studies also reviewed use of methylphenidate for hyperactivity and risks of tricyclic antidepressants in children.", 
    "94": "Effects of prenatal undernutrition, stress and diazepam treatment on learning acquisition, and subsequent retention of a spatial discrimination task was assessed in the offsprings. Undernutrition of the dams was induced by restricting food intake to half, throughout the period of gestation, whereas footshock stress and diazepam (0.5 mg/kg, ip) treatment was given from day 13 to 20 of gestation, this being the critical period for neural development in this species. The pups born were subjected to spatial discrimination learning, and retention of the learning acquisition after an interval of one week, in a single unit black/white T-maze, at 8-9 weeks of age. The results indicate that prenatal undernutrition induces significant learning and retention deficits in the offspring, whereas the effect of prenatal stress was limited to only deficit in learning acquisition. Prenatally administered diazepam induced significant deficits in learning acquisition and subsequent retention of the discrimination task in pups culled from normally nourished dams. However, offsprings from diazepam administered undernourished dams exhibited less marked cognitive deficits, which may be attributable to the altered emotional reactivity of pups born to undernourished mothers. Prenatally administered diazepam also induced differential effects in stressed and non-stressed dam offsprings, though the effects were statistically insignificant. The results suggest that prenatal insults, in the form of undernourishment, stress and anxiolytic drugs, leave a lasting imprint on cognitive behaviour of the offspring. The final effect on this behaviour may be determined by the co-existence of these prenatal factors, particularly at a time when the foetus is vulnerable because of neural development and differentiation.", 
    "95": "The solid-phase extraction (SPE) of seven 1,4-benzodiazepines (oxazepam, diazepam, temazepam, nordazepam, brotizolam, adinazolam and midazolam) using prazepam as internal standard was investigated. The 1,4-benzodiazepines were recovered from an aqueous buffer of suitable pH, using C18 Sep-Pak cartridges and mixtures of methanol-water as elution solvent. The recovery of oxazepam using different sorbent materials (C2, C8, C18, cyanopropyl, phenyl and cyclohexyl Bond-Elut) was also examined as a function of pH and the composition of the elution solvent. The SPE of oxazepam was investigated using spiked urine samples and the C2 cartridge gave rise to the cleanest urine extracts. The recoveries of the other 1,4-benzodiazepines from spiked urine and plasma samples using the C2 cartridge was then found to be higher than 90%, without any interference from endogenous compounds of the samples. Finally, the influence of other factors such as drug concentration, sample volume and the number of times the SPE cartridge had been used was also examined.", 
    "96": "A case of severe tetanus with autonomic dysfunction is reported, describing the adequate response to continuous infusions of both propofol and midazolam, and the successful use of clonidine to control sympathetic over-activity. Tolerance was not observed during the 34 days of propofol and midazolam sedation. Continuously infused clonidine provided good control in combination with sedation and paralysis in this case, and no episodes of cardiovascular derangement were seen, possibly due to the adequate management of filling pressure. Vecuronium was a suitable and manageable muscle relaxant to control skeletal muscle spasms and to facilitate mechanical ventilation.", 
    "97": "Muscarinic cholinoceptor subtypes in the rat prostatic membrane were characterized by using [3H]-methyl-quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) in ligand binding studies. [3H]-Methyl-QNB saturation experiments showed the existence of a homogeneous population of binding sites with a high affinity (KD value) of 0.24 +/- 0.04 nM and a maximum binding site number (Bmax) of 219 +/- 65 fmol/mg protein. Inhibition of [3H]-methyl-QNB binding by nonlabelled compounds was in the following order of effectiveness in rat prostate: atropine > 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) > hexahydro-sila-difenidol hydrochloride, p-fluoroanalog (p-F-HHSiD) > pirenzepine > methoctramine > [11-((2-((dimethylamino)-methyl)-1-piperidinyl)acetyl)-5,11-dihydro-6H- pyrido(2,3-b)(1,4)benzodiazepine-6-one] (AF-DX 116). This ranking order was similar to that for the salivary gland (M3 subtype), but not for the brain (M1 subtype) or the heart (M2 subtype). These results indicate that the muscarinic cholinoceptors in the rat prostate belong mainly to the M3 subtype. Furthermore, Bmax values for muscarinic cholinoceptors in the aged rat prostate (approximately 1-year-old) were smaller than those in the young rat prostate (6- to 8-week-old) (87 +/- 13 vs. 183 +/- 32 fmol/mg protein). However, KD values for muscarinic cholinoceptors, and Bmax and KD values for beta-adrenoceptors showed no change. These results suggest that the number of prostatic muscarinic cholinoceptors decreases with aging.", 
    "98": "The affinities of various muscarinic antagonists to human detrusor muscle were determined using radioligand binding techniques. Saturation experiments with 3H-QNB revealed that there were significant amount of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in human detrusor muscle. Displacement of 3H-QNB binding by various muscarinic subtype selective drugs was studied in the inhibition experiment. Pirenzepine, AFDX-116 and 4-DAMP inhibited the 3H-QNB binding to human detrusor muscle with the Ki values (nM) (mean +/- S.D., n = 6) of 243 +/- 62.5, 59.7 +/- 15.3 and 2.69 +/- 0.96, respectively. These data indicate that M3-selective drug possesses the highest affinity to human detrusor muscle. The Ki values of oxybutynin and tiquizium bromide were similar to those of 4-DAMP, suggesting that these two drugs have strong affinities to human detrusor muscle.", 
    "99": "A prospective double blind randomized study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of flumazenil in patients for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, sedated with midazolam or diazepam. Flumazenil significantly reduced the degree of sedation in both treatment groups without significant intergroup differences. There was no evidence of rebound sedation during the observation period of 4 hours. Anterograde amnesia was effectively antagonized in both groups. Flumazenil was a well tolerated safe and effective benzodiazepine antagonist. The combination of benzodiazepine with flumazenil makes it possible to reduce the recovery period and may be useful in outpatients undergoing endoscopy."
