Animal models of epilepsy (maximal electroshock (MES), n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), isonicotinic hydrazide acid (INH), picrotoxine (PIC) and strychnine (STR)-induced convulsions or turning behavior were used to evaluate anticonvulsant activity while diazepam-induced sleep test was used to evaluate sedative activity of the plants. Four doses of extracts were used for each plant (100, 200, 500 and 1000 mg/kg). At a dose of 1000 mg/kg, Millettia thonningii protected 60 and 90% of mice against MES and PTZ-induced convulsions, respectively. At the same dose, Millettia thonningii also protected 80% of mice against NMDA-induced turning behavior. At a dose of 1000 mg/kg, Ocinum sanctum provided complete protection against MES, PIC and STR- induced convulsions and 83.3% of protection in PTZ test. Securitaca longepedunculata completely protected (100%) mice in PIC test at a dose of 200 mg/kg, in MES test at a dose of 500 mg/kg and in PTZ test at a dose of 1000 mg/kg. 66.7% of mice were protected against STR-induced convulsions. All the three plants showed also sedative properties for they increased significantly and in a dose dependent manner the total sleep time induced by diazepam. The total sleep time of the control groups was multiplied by a factor of 3 at least by each extract. The presence of sedative and anticonvulsant activity in the three plants could explain their use in traditional medicine in the treatment of epilepsy and insomnia in Cameroon.",

A male in his 50s presented with a 10 year history of believing that parasites were colonizing his skin and biting into his skin and eyes. The patient had received extensive medical evaluations that found no evidence that symptoms were due to a medical cause. He was persistent in his belief and had induced bilateral corneal abrasions and skin damage by using heat lamps and hair dryers in an attempt to disinfect his body. The patient was treated with olanzapine along with treatment for his skin and eyes. His delusional belief system persisted but no further damage to his eyes and skin was noted on initial follow-up.",

In this report, the authors describe the case of a young woman who presented for care after a 13-year period of catatonia-like symptoms, including mutism, refusal to eat and persistent neck flexion. Medical management included placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastric tube for nutritional support. A thorough medical investigation later revealed the presence of a cervical spine haemangioma that was treated surgically, with improvement in neck posturing. Psychopharmacological treatment included lorazepam, aripiprazole and memantine. Addition of fluvoxamine to target obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)-like symptoms resulted in clinical improvement, suggesting OCD as a possible cause of this patient's chronic catatonic state.",

She presented with negativism and poor communication. Physical examination, routine tests, brain CT and electroencephalogram were normal. Urine toxicology was positive for benzodiazepines. Twelve days after, she presented with catatonia and immobility. Additional examinations, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing and brain CT, were again normal. Risperidone was administered, and psychotherapy intensified. In the third week, the condition worsened, with intense pyramidal signs and decerebration that led to a vegetative state. Brain MRI revealed diffuse leukoencephalopathy. Extensive metabolic and CSF studies were persistently negative. Brain biopsy was compatible with chronic cerebral hypoxia/anoxia. A diagnosis of delayed hypoxic-ischemic leukoencephalopathy was made. Supportive measures were intensified. She was discharged from the hospital after 4 months in a minimally conscious state and was capable of elementary communication and recognising faces.", 
    "4": "This case report provides a different perspective on the management of a patient with a psychotic illness. The detained patient, a man aged 50, had specific delusional beliefs about toxins affecting his kidneys, such that he needed to drink water to 'detoxify' himself. This resulted in him developing life-threatening hyponatraemia. It became clear that he was very resistant to taking oral medication and was reluctant to engage with any psychological treatment. A novel approach was considered, involving the 'off licence' use of short acting intramuscular olanzapine for the successful treatment of the psychotic illness. The case demonstrates the safe use of intramuscular olanzapine for 155 days, which is the longest reported case for the use of intramuscular olanzapine for the treatment of a psychotic illness. The individual was later discharged on oral olanzapine.", 
    "5": "Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders. They are frequently treated with benzodiazepines, which are fast acting highly effective anxiolytic agents. However, their long-term use is impaired by tolerance development and abuse liability. In contrast, antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered as first-line treatment but have a slow onset of action. Neurosteroids are powerful allosteric modulators of GABA(A) and glutamate receptors. However, they also modulate sigma receptors and they are modulated themselves by SSRIs. Both pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown that neurosteroid homeostasis is altered in depression and anxiety disorders and antidepressants may act in part through restoring neurosteroid disbalance. Moreover, novel drugs interfering with neurosteroidogenesis such as ligands of the translocator protein (18\u2009kDa) may represent an attractive pharmacological option for novel anxiolytics which lack the unwarranted side effects of benzodiazepines. Thus, neurosteroids are important endogenous neuromodulators for the physiology and pathophysiology of anxiety and they may constitute a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of these disorders.", 
    "6": "Neurosteroids represent a class of endogenous steroids that are synthesized in the brain, the adrenals, and the gonads and have potent and selective effects on the GABAA-receptor. 3\u03b1-hydroxy A-ring reduced metabolites of progesterone, deoxycorticosterone, and testosterone are positive modulators of GABA(A)-receptor in a non-genomic manner. Allopregnanolone (3\u03b1-OH-5\u03b1-pregnan-20-one), 5\u03b1-androstane-3\u03b1, 17\u03b1-diol (Adiol), and 3\u03b15\u03b1-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (3\u03b15\u03b1-THDOC) enhance the GABA-mediated Cl(-) currents acting on a site (or sites) distinct from the GABA, benzodiazepine, barbiturate, and picrotoxin binding sites. 3\u03b15\u03b1-P and 3\u03b15\u03b1-THDOC potentiate synaptic GABA(A)-receptor function and activate \u03b4-subunit containing extrasynaptic receptors that mediate tonic currents. On the contrary, 3\u03b2-OH pregnane steroids and pregnenolone sulfate (PS) are GABA(A)-receptor antagonists and induce activation-dependent inhibition of the receptor. The activities of neurosteroid are dependent on brain regions and types of neurons. In addition to the slow genomic action of the parent steroids, the non-genomic, and rapid actions of neurosteroids play a significant role in the GABA(A)-receptor function and shift in mood and memory function. This review describes molecular mechanisms underlying neurosteroid action on the GABA(A)-receptor, mood changes, and cognitive functions.", 
    "7": "This review highlights the role of major endogenous neurosteroids in seizure disorders and the promise of neurosteroid replacement therapy in epilepsy. Neurosteroids are endogenous modulators of seizure susceptibility. Neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone (3\u03b1-hydroxy-5\u03b1-pregnane-20-one) and allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (3\u03b1,21-dihydroxy-5\u03b1-pregnan-20-one) are positive modulators of GABA-A receptors. Aside from peripheral tissues, neurosteroids are synthesized within the brain, mostly in principal neurons. Neurosteroids potentiate synaptic GABA-A receptor function and also activate \u03b4-subunit-containing extrasynaptic GABA-A receptors that mediate tonic currents and thus may play an important role in neuronal network excitability and seizure susceptibility. Our studies over the past decade have shown that neurosteroids are broad-spectrum anticonvulsants and confer seizure protection in various animal models. They protect against seizures induced by GABA-A receptor antagonists, 6-Hz model, pilocarpine-induced limbic seizures, and seizures in kindled animals. Unlike benzodiazepines, tolerance does not occur to their actions during chronic administration. Our recent studies provide compelling evidence that neurosteroids may have antiepileptogenic properties. There is emerging evidence that endogenous neurosteroids may play a key role in the pathophysiology of catamenial epilepsy, stress-sensitive seizure conditions, temporal lobe epilepsy, and alcohol-withdrawal seizures. It is suggested that neurosteroid replacement with natural or synthetic neurosteroids may be useful in the treatment of epilepsy. Synthetic analogs of neurosteroids that are devoid of hormonal side effects show promise in the treatment of diverse seizure disorders. Agents that stimulate endogenous production of neurosteroids may also be useful for treatment of epilepsy.",

    "17": "Consumption of Anaphe larva had been reported to cause seasonal ataxia and impaired consciousness. Therefore this study examined the neuropharmacological and mechanism(s) of action of aqueous extract of Anaphe venata in rats. Behavioural effects namely rearing, stretching, sniffing and ataxia were determined after the intraperitoneal administration of aqueous extract of Anaphe larva in rats. Animals were divided into groups and graded doses (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, i.p.) of extract were administered. The control group was administered normal saline (vehicle). The effects of scopolamine (3 mg/kg, i.p.), flumazenil (2 mg/kg, i.p.), naloxone (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.), and thiamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.) on the observed behavioral changes were also examined. The effects of the extract administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 200 mg/kg on the amphetamine-induced stereotypy and locomotion were evaluated. Aqueous anaphe extract induced significant (p< 0.01) stretching and ataxia behavioural effects while it inhibited rearing behaviour when compared with the vehicle-treated group. However, it had no significant effect on sniffing behaviour. Scopolamine reversed all the effects of the extract on rearing, stretching and ataxia. Both Flumazenil and naloxone only reversed the effects of the extract on stretching and ataxia-induced behaviours significantly. However, thiamine potentiated both stretching and ataxia-induced behaviours. The extract inhibited the amphetamine-induced stereotype behaviour and locomotion. In conclusion, these results showed that these anaphe-induced behavioural effects are mediated via cholinergic, GABAergic, opioidergic and dopaminergic receptor systems with strong muscarinic-cholinergic receptors involvement in ataxia-induced behaviour. We therefore suggest that muscranic-cholinergic like drugs may be of benefit in the management of patients that present with clinical condition of seasonal ataxia.",

BIS monitoring in combination with routine pulse oximetry and blood pressure measurement is getting dental sedation safer. Independently of the bolus or continuous intravenous midazolam infusion the investigators approved high efficacy of bispectral index in benzodiazepine dose titration. Successful dental treatment under conscious sedation and no evident associated with analgesia complications show the importance of BIS-monitoring in the improvement of safe sedation and dental treatment in patients with metabolic syndrome.",

The influence of smoking, gender, age, as well as polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and ABCB1 genes on the serum and CSF drug levels was also analyzed. Thirty-seven white outpatients (10 smokers and 27 nonsmokers) were included. From 29 of them, CSF was collected successfully. A strong correlation (Spearman rank correlation [rs] = 0.93; P < 0.05) was found between serum and CSF concentrations of OLA and a somewhat weaker correlation (rs = 0.5; P < 0.05) between those of DMO. The CSF concentrations of OLA and DMO were on average 12% and 16% of those in serum. Extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 had higher (P < 0.05) daily doses than poor metabolizers when the influence of smoking was taken into account. Smokers had lower (P < 0.01) concentration-to-dose ratios of OLA in serum (mean, 2.23 ng/mL per mg vs 3.32 ng/mL per mg) and CSF (0.27 ng/mL per mg vs 0.41 ng/mL per mg) than nonsmokers. The concentration-to-dose ratio for serum DMO decreased with increasing age (rs = -0.41; P < 0.05). Carriers of ABCB1 1236T/2677T/3435T haplotype had higher serum (mean, 37.7 ng/mL vs 22.5 ng/mL; P = 0.035) and CSF (4.7 ng/mL vs 2.6 ng/mL; P = 0.018) OLA concentrations than patients without this haplotype. The present study shows a strong correlation between serum and CSF concentrations of OLA, indicating that concentrations of OLA in serum reflect those in CSF.", 
    "25": "Several important and previously unrecognized roles for the neurotransmitter glutamate in the biology of primary brain tumors have recently been elucidated. Glutamate is produced and released from glioma cells via the system x(c) (-) cystine glutamate transporter as a byproduct of glutathione synthesis. Glutamate appears to play a central role in the malignant phenotype of glioma via multiple mechanisms. By binding to peritumoral neuronal glutamate receptors, glutamate is responsible for seizure induction and similarly causes excitotoxicity, which aids the expansion of tumor cells into the space vacated by destroyed tissue. Glutamate also activates ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors on glioma cells in a paracrine and autocrine manner. \u03b1-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoaxazolepropionate acid (AMPA) glutamate receptors lack the GluR2 subunit rendering them Ca(2+) permeable and capable of activating the AKT and MAPK pathways. Furthermore, these receptors are critical in aiding the invasion of glioma cells into normal brain. AMPA-Rs accumulate at focal adhesion sites where they may indirectly mediate interactions between the extracellular matrix and integrins. Glutamate receptor stimulation results in activation of focal adhesion kinase, which is critical to the regulation of growth factor and integrin-stimulated cell motility and invasion. The multitude of effects of glutamate on glioma biology supports the rationale for pharmacological targeting of glutamate receptors and transporters. Several ongoing and recently completed clinical trials are exploring the therapeutic potential of interrupting glutamate-mediated brain tumor growth.", 
    "26": "We studied the time course for the reversal of rifampin's effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral midazolam (a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 substrate) and digoxin (a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate). Rifampin increased midazolam metabolism, greatly reducing the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(0-\u221e)). The midazolam AUC(0-\u221e) returned to baseline with a half-life of ~8 days. Rifampin's effect on the AUC(0-3 h) of digoxin was biphasic: the AUC(0-3 h) increased with concomitant dosing of the two drugs but decreased when digoxin was administered after rifampin. Digoxin was found to be a weak substrate of organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B3 in transfected cells. Although the drug was transported into isolated hepatocytes, it is not likely that this transport was through OATP1B3 because the transport was not inhibited by rifampin. However, rifampin did inhibit the P-gp-mediated transport of digoxin with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) below anticipated gut lumen concentrations, suggesting that rifampin inhibits digoxin efflux from the enterocyte to the intestinal lumen. Pharmacokinetic modeling suggested that the effects on digoxin are consistent with a combination of inhibitory and inductive effects on gut P-gp. These results suggest modifications to drug-drug interaction (DDI) trial designs.", 
    "27": "The authors examined benzodiazepine and sedative-hypnotic positive cases of drivers under the influence (DUI) in Finland from 1997 to 2008. Factors studied were the number of cases positive for the most commonly encountered of these pharmaceuticals, simultaneous use of amphetamine and/or cannabis, and the relationship between the number of DUI cases and overall sales in Finland for the individual pharmaceuticals. Data for 20037 cases positive for the relevant drugs were retrieved from the laboratory database of the Alcohol and Drug Analytics Unit, National Institute for Health and Welfare. Toxicological results were from blood analysis. Drug sales figures for each pharmaceutical were obtained from the Finnish Medicines Agency. An increase in DUI cases that were positive for the drugs studied was evident, which reflected the overall increase in positive DUI cases detected annually. The proportion of relevant cases was typically 75% or higher of all positive DUI cases up to 2003, the year that the Finnish zero tolerance law was introduced, and then decreased to 66.2% in 2008. Diazepam was consistently the most commonly detected nonmetabolite drug. The prevalence of clonazepam and alprazolam increased sharply from 2004 onward. Metabolites of diazepam, nordiazepam, temazepam, and oxazepam, were other common findings. Associated use of amphetamine and/or cannabis was also common in these DUI cases, typically between 56% and 66% of cases. An increase in the number of DUI cases showing combined use of benzodiazepines and sedative-hypnotics with amphetamines in particular was apparent after zero tolerance legislation and the introduction in 2005 of an effective on-site screening device for the stimulant. Ratios of DUI cases to sales figures showed an increase in detection of clonazepam-positive DUI cases from 2003. Diazepam, midazolam, and alprazolam also exhibited relatively high ratios, which increased from 1997 to 2008.",

Classical benzodiazepines exert a positive allosteric effect by increasing the apparent affinity of channel opening by the agonist \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA). We concentrate here on the major adult isoform, the \u03b1(1)\u03b2(2)\u03b3(2) GABA(A) receptor. The classical binding pocket for benzodiazepines is located in a subunit cleft between &alpha;(1) and \u03b3(2) subunits in a position homologous to the agonist binding site for GABA that is located between \u03b2(2) and \u03b1(1) subunits. We review here approaches to this picture. In particular, point mutations were performed in combination with subsequent analysis of the expressed mutant proteins using either electrophysiological techniques or radioactive ligand binding assays. The predictive power of these methods is assessed by comparing the results with the predictions that can be made on the basis of the recently published crystal structure of the acetylcholine binding protein that shows homology to the N-terminal, extracellular domain of the GABA(A) receptor. In addition, we review an approach to the question of how the benzodiazepine ligands are positioned in their binding pocket. We also discuss a newly postulated modulatory site for benzodiazepines at the \u03b1(1)/\u03b2(2) subunit interface, homologous to the classical benzodiazepine binding pocket.",

The subsequent imposition of the rigid conceptual dichotomy between depression and anxiety strengthened a notion that the focus of psychiatry should be on the 'depression side' of this divide. Having promoted cognitive-behavioural therapy as the best treatment for anxiety disorders, clinical psychologists have largely 'taken over' the anxiety disorders from psychiatrists. It is suggested that psychiatrists' surrender of the anxiety disorders may have negative consequences for the future of psychiatry.",

Polymorphisms in the D2 (DRD2 rs1076560) and AKT1 (AKT1 rs1130233) genes have been associated with their respective protein expression and with higher-order cognition and brain function, including attention. Given the strong potential for their relationship, we investigated the interaction of these polymorphisms on multiple molecular and in vivo phenotypes associated with this signaling pathway. We measured AKT1 and GSK-3\u03b2 proteins and phosphorylation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, functional MRI cingulate response during attentional control, behavioral accuracy during sustained attention, and response to 8 wk of treatment with olanzapine in a total of 190 healthy subjects and 66 patients with schizophrenia. In healthy subjects, we found that the interaction between the T allele of DRD2 rs1076560 and the A allele of AKT1 rs1130233 was associated with reduced AKT1 protein levels and reduced phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2, as well as with altered cingulate response and reduced behavioral accuracy during attentional processing. On the other hand, interaction of these two alleles was associated with greater improvement of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores in patients with schizophrenia after treatment with olanzapine. The present results indicate that these functional polymorphisms are epistatically associated with multiple phenotypes of relevance to schizophrenia.

In addition some opioids have anticholinergic effects. Other drugs may induce delirium by dehydration (loop diuretics like furosemide) or sedation (benzodiazapines like lorazepam).

The performance of the devices was assessed by their ability to detect substances using cut-offs which were set at sufficiently low levels to allow optimal detection of positive DUID cases. The devices were evaluated for the detection of amphetamine(s), cannabis, cocaine, opiates and benzodiazepines when the relevant test was incorporated. Methamphetamine, MDMA and PCP tests that were included in some devices were not evaluated since there were too few positive samples. The device results were compared with confirmation analysis results in oral fluid. The opiates tests appeared to perform relatively well with sensitivity results between 69 and 90%. Amphetamines and benzodiazepines tests had lower sensitivity, although the DrugWipe test evaluated was promising for amphetamine.

For more generalized spasticity, a number of useful oral agents and intrathecal baclofen are available, each with their positive and negative attributes. Fundamental knowledge of pharmacologic properties and toxicities of these medications is required for safe and appropriate use. To achieve optimum results, spasticity treatment should be part of an integrated therapeutic approach in which patients, caregivers, therapists, physicians, and surgeons have an open and clear communication about the overall rehabilitation process of the patient.

The aim of this study was (1) to further characterize the central and peripheral toxic effects of ivermectin in animals and (2) to determine possible therapeutic strategies for use in cases of ivermectin poisoning. We tested the effects of experimental doses of ivermectin previously reported to cause various intensities of CNS depression. However, in our study, ivermectin at 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 mg/kg i.v. did not produce visible CNS depression in rats and 10 mg/kg resulted in sleepiness and staggering 10 to 40 min after application, while a dose of 15 mg/kg caused CNS depression very similar to general anesthesia. Ivermectin dose-dependently potentiates thiopentone-induced sleeping time in rats. Flumazenil (0.2 mg/kg), the benzodiazepine antagonist, did not affect the action of thiopentone; however, it significantly reduced sleeping time in rats treated with a combination of ivermectin (10 mg/kg) and thiopentone (25 mg/kg; from 189.86 \u00b1 45.28 min to 83.13 \u00b1 32.22 min; mean \u00b1 SD).

Sedating antidepressant drugs are used for treating primary insomnia, but their sleep-promoting effects have been demonstrated primarily in depressed patients. Several second-generation antipsychotic drugs are used in low doses to promote sleep, but they also have inherent antidepressant effects.

All trials assessed the participants' anxiety levels using the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). Across all trials 280 patients were exposed to silexan 80 mg/day, 37 were treated with lorazepam 0.5 mg/day and 192 received placebo. Average within group HAMA total scores at baseline ranged between 24.7 and 27.1 points. Patients treated with silexan showed average HAMA total score decreases by between 10.4 \u00b1 7.1 and 12.0 \u00b1 7.2 points at week 6 and by between 11.8 \u00b1 7.7 and 16.0 \u00b1 8.3 points at week 10.

Disruption of sleep is a modifiable risk factor that may contribute to delirium and cognitive dysfunction in ICU patients. Among the functions of sleep are repair of defective processes and restoration of the brain to a state in which it is ready to acquire new knowledge. It is logical that disruption of these processes may produce acute confusion. Delirium develops through a complex interaction between the patient's baseline vulnerability (patient's predisposing risk factors before hospitalization) and precipitating factors or insults (modifiable events that occur during hospitalization). The latter factors include both sleep disruption and sedation. We present a hypothesis that these two factors are causally linked through effects on memory. Our hypothesis explains why patients randomized to receive an \u03b1(2) adrenoceptor agonist are less likely to develop delirium (and the attendant cognitive dysfunction) than those randomized to receive benzodiazepines.",

Stress disorder symptoms include re-experiencing the traumatic event, avoiding stimuli associated with the traumatic event, and increased physical arousal. These symptoms can also be seen in healthy individuals, and should only lead to disorder diagnosis when they cause distress or impairment. Treatment options for stress disorders include observation, psychological interventions, and medication. Approximately half of those with diagnosable stress disorders will return to nondiagnosable status over time without therapeutic intervention. Psychological interventions with empirical support concentrate on providing either noninvasive support in the short term, such as psychological first aid (PFA), or more long-term controlled re-experiencing of the precipitating trauma, such as many exposure-based therapies. Exposure-based treatments can result in temporary increases in symptoms before long-term gains are realized, so they are not recommended for wilderness settings. Medications to treat stress disorders include benzodiazepines, propranolol, and antidepressant medications. Benzodiazepines are often carried in wilderness first aid kits, but they provide very limited stress disorder symptom relief. Propranolol is being explored as a method of preventing traumatic stress disorders, but the data are not currently conclusive. Antidepressant medications are a good long-term strategy for stress disorder treatment, but they are of limited utility in wilderness settings as they are unlikely to be included in expedition medical kits and require approximately 4 weeks of administration for symptom reduction. Recommendations for wilderness treatment of stress disorders focus on increasing knowledge of stress disorder diagnosis and PFA.", 
    "138": "During 8 sampling campaigns carried out over a period of two years, 72 samples, including influent and effluent wastewater, and sludge samples from three conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), were analyzed to assess the occurrence and fate of 43 pharmaceutical compounds. The selected pharmaceuticals belong to different therapeutic classes, i.e. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, lipid modifying agents (fibrates and statins), psychiatric drugs (benzodiazepine derivative drugs and antiepileptics), histamine H2-receptor antagonists, antibacterials for systemic use, beta blocking agents, beta-agonists, diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and anti-diabetics. The obtained results showed the presence of 32 target compounds in wastewater influent and 29 in effluent, in concentrations ranging from low ng/L to a few \u03bcg/L (e.g. NSAIDs). The analysis of sludge samples showed that 21 pharmaceuticals accumulated in sewage sludge from all three WWTPs in concentrations up to 100 ng/g. This indicates that even good removal rates obtained in aqueous phase (i.e. comparison of influent and effluent wastewater concentrations) do not imply degradation to the same extent. For this reason, the overall removal was estimated as a sum of all the losses of a parent compound produces by different mechanisms of chemical and physical transformation, biodegradation and sorption to solid matter. The target compounds showed very different removal rates and no logical pattern in behaviour even if they belong to the same therapeutic groups. What is clear is that the elimination of most of the substances is incomplete and improvements of the wastewater treatment and subsequent treatments of the produced sludge are required to prevent the introduction of these micro-pollutants in the environment.",

In Lyon's prison, BDZs and/or opioid maintenance treatment are often prescribed to patients with mental disorders. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the impact of psychiatrist and pharmacist collaboration on reducing the BDZs dose prescribed to prisoner patients. Since 2001, clinicians and pharmacists have been holding monthly meetings to develop prescribing guidelines and discuss those patients receiving high-dose BDZs. All prescribed psychotropic drugs were noted for each included patient in the control (before guidelines) and intervention groups. Criteria used to define each patient profile included age, diagnosis (mental disorder), and concomitant treatment (opioids, antidepressants). To compare each group, the daily dose of prescribed BDZs was used as a quantitative variable and expressed in diazepam equivalent. Four hundred and seventy-three patients were included, 222 in the control group and 251 in the intervention group. The two groups showed no difference in terms of diagnosis. The daily dose of BDZ was higher in the control group when all patients were considered (mean(CONTROL GROUP) = 46 mg in diazepam equivalent vs. mean(INTERVENTIION GROUP) = 34 mg) and for each of the following patient categories: 'mental disorder' (48 mg vs. 30 mg), 'no opioid treatment' (44 mg vs. 31 mg), 'buprenorphin treatment' (58 mg vs. 63 mg), 'no antidepressant treatment' (41 mg vs. 29 mg), and 'antidepressant treatment' (53 mg vs. 38 mg). The results of this retrospective study show the positive impact of multidisciplinary intervention on reducing the prescribed daily dose of BDZs. This experience confirms the positive impact that pharmacist feedback on prescriptions and the development of treatment guidelines by clinician and pharmacist collaboration have on improving the prescribing practice in a prison environment.",

One difficulty in drug identification is that the doses administered are often low. Toxicology laboratories need sophisticated equipment and expertise to ensure that the perpetrator is prosecuted or, alternatively, to rule out DFC. More information is needed, not only for the public but also for physicians and toxicologists. Benzodiazepines and related compounds are identified in about 75% of DFC cases.",

Acute dystonic movements should be treated with anticholinergic agents while agitation and anxiety might respond to short-term application of benzodiazepines.

    "151": "Alcohol use causes many physiological changes in brain with behavioral sequelae. We previously observed (J Neurosci 27:12367-12377, 2007) plastic changes in hippocampal slice recordings paralleling behavioral changes in rats treated with a single intoxicating dose of ethanol (EtOH). Here, we were able to reproduce in primary cultured hippocampal neurons many of the effects of in vivo EtOH exposure on GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs). Cells grown 11 to 15 days in vitro demonstrated GABA(A)R \u03b4 subunit expression and sensitivity to enhancement by short-term exposure to EtOH (60 mM) of GABA(A)R-mediated tonic current (I(tonic)) using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques. EtOH gave virtually no enhancement of mIPSCs. Cells pre-exposed to EtOH (60 mM) for 30 min showed, 1 h after EtOH withdrawal, a 50% decrease in basal I(tonic) magnitude and tolerance to short-term EtOH enhancement of I(tonic), followed by reduced basal mIPSC area at 4 h. At 24 h, we saw considerable recovery in mIPSC area and significant potentiation by short-term EtOH; in addition, GABA(A)R currents exhibited reduced enhancement by benzodiazepines. These changes paralleled significant decreases in cell-surface expression of normally extrasynaptic \u03b4 and \u03b14 GABA(A)R subunits as early as 20 min after EtOH exposure and reduced \u03b15-containing GABA(A)Rs at 1 h, followed by a larger reduction of normally synaptic \u03b11 subunit at 4 h, and then by increases in \u03b14\u03b32-containing cell-surface receptors by 24 h. Measuring internalization of biotinylated GABA(A)Rs, we showed for the first time that the EtOH-induced loss of I(tonic) and cell-surface \u03b4/\u03b14 20 min after withdrawal results from increased receptor endocytosis rather than decreased exocytosis.",

We examined the effects of three anilino enaminones on neuronal activity of output neurons, mitral cells (MC), in an olfactory bulb brain slice preparation using whole-cell patch-clamp recording. These compounds are known to be effective in attenuating pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions. Among the three compounds tested, 5-methyl-3-(4-trifluoromethoxy-phenylamino)-cyclohex-2-enone (KRS-5Me-4-OCF\u2083) showed potent inhibition of MC activity with an EC\u2085\u2080 of 24.5 \u03bcM. It hyperpolarized the membrane potential of MCs accompanied by suppression of spontaneous firing. Neither ionotropic glutamate receptor blockers nor a GABA(B) receptor blocker prevented the KRS-5Me-4-OCF(3)-evoked inhibitory effects. In the presence of GABA(A) receptor antagonists, KRS-5Me-4-OCF(3) completely failed to evoke inhibition of MC spiking activity, suggesting that KRS-5Me-4-OCF\u2083-induced inhibition may be mediated by direct action on GABA(A) receptors or indirect action through the elevation of tissue GABA levels. Neither vigabatrin (a selective GABA-T inhibitor) nor 1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-[2-[[(diphenylmethylene)amino]oxy]ethyl]-3-pyridinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride (NNC-711) (a selective inhibitor of GABA uptake by GABA transporter 1) eliminated the effect of KRS-5ME-4-OCF\u2083 on neuronal excitability, indicating that the inhibitory effect of the enaminone resulted from direct activation of GABA(A) receptors. The concentration-response curves for GABA are left-shifted by KRS-5Me-4-OCF\u2083, demonstrating that KRS-5Me-4-OCF\u2083 enhanced GABA affinity and acted as a positive allosteric modulator of GABA(A) receptors. The effect of KRS-5Me-4-OCF\u2083 was blocked by applying a benzodiazepine site antagonist, suggesting that KRS-5Me-4-OCF\u2083 binds at the classic benzodiazepine site to exert its pharmacological action. The results suggest clinical use of enaminones as anticonvulsants in seizures and as a potential anxiolytic in mental disorders.",

This \u03b16 polymorphism might explain various differences in pharmacological properties and density of GABAARs between the rat lines. In the present study, we have used nonselected outbred Sprague-Dawley rats homozygous for the \u03b16-100RR (RR) and \u03b16-100QQ (QQ) genotypes to show that these RR and QQ rats display similar differences between genotypes as AT and ANT rat lines.

The results suggest the involvement of \u03b16-R100Q polymorphism in these line differences and in the differences previously found between AT and ANT rats. In addition, the \u03b16-R100Q polymorphism induces striking differences in [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding kinetics to recombinant \u03b16\u03b23\u03b32s receptors and cerebellar DZ-IS sites.

It is characterized by delayed sleep onset, problems in maintaining sleep, early morning awakening or the feeling of non-restorative sleep coupled with significant daytime impairments on an emotional, social or professional level. It can occur as a co-morbid condition in any other medical or mental disorder, but also as a primary condition. Within the last decade new diagnostic and differential diagnostic approaches have been suggested that enhance diagnostic precision. Epidemiological data and data relating to the health care and cost situation of chronic insomnia suggest a huge burden for society. Chronic insomnia leads to a clear-cut increased risk for psychopathology (i. e., affective disorders) and probably also for cardiovascular and metabolic dysfunction. The pathophysiology of the condition is still poorly understood and will profit from integrating modern neuroscientific approaches (animal studies, molecular biology, neuroimaging, neurophysiology, etc.). Current treatment strategies are mainly based on cognitive behavioural interventions (CBT-I) and hypnotic treatment with benzodiazepine receptor agonists and sedating antidepressants. Although the effectiveness of these treatments has been clearly demonstrated, a substantial proportion of patients proves to be treatment-resistant or profits only poorly. The question of long-term pharmaceutical treatment of chronic insomnia, at least in Europe, is unresolved and urgently needs answers. Novel rational treatment avenues require clues on causes and mechanisms from integrated neuroscientific approaches. The important issues concerning insomnia treatment in the future especially in Europe will be reviewed and discussed critically.", 
    "162": "Benzodiazepines (BDZs) enhance GABA(A) receptor inhibition by direct actions on central BDZ receptors (CBRs). Although some BDZs also bind mitochondrial receptors [translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO)] and promote the synthesis of GABA-enhancing neurosteroids, the role of neurosteroids in the clinical effects of BDZs is unknown. In rat hippocampal slices, we compared midazolam, an anesthetic BDZ, with clonazepam, an anticonvulsant/anxiolytic BDZ that activates CBRs selectively. Midazolam, but not clonazepam, increased neurosteroid levels in CA1 pyramidal neurons without changing TSPO immunostaining. Midazolam, but not clonazepam, also augmented a form of spike inhibition after stimulation adjacent to the pyramidal cell layer and inhibited induction of long-term potentiation. These effects were prevented by finasteride, an inhibitor of neurosteroid synthesis, or 17PA [17-phenyl-(3\u03b1,5\u03b1)-androst-16-en-3-ol], a blocker of neurosteroid effects on GABA(A) receptors. Moreover, the synaptic effects were mimicked by a combination of clonazepam with FGIN (2-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)-1H-indol-3-yl]-N,N-dihexylacetamide), a selective TSPO agonist, or a combination of clonazepam with exogenous allopregnanolone. Consistent with these in vitro results, finasteride abolished the effects of midazolam on contextual fear learning when administrated 1 d before midazolam injection. Thus, dual activation of CBRs and TSPO appears to result in unique actions of clinically important BDZs. Furthermore, endogenous neurosteroids are shown to be important regulators of pyramidal neuron function and synaptic plasticity.",

Pretreatment with UDCA significantly enhanced the binding. This correlated well with significant enhancement by UDCA of the plasma midazolam concentration. The brain benzodiazepine receptor binding of oral midazolam was significantly enhanced by pretreatment with ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A, whereas it was significantly reduced by treatment with dexamethasone, an inducer of this enzyme. These effects paralleled changes in the plasma concentration of midazolam.",
