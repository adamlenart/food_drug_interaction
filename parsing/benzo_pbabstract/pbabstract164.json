The purpose of this review is to focus upon the rationale behind the chemical modifications of several recently marketed AEDs or drugs in development and to categorize them according to the main purposes for the improvements: better efficacy or tolerability accompanied by improved pharmacokinetic properties.", 
    "1": "AEDs that have been chemically modified to new derivatives during the last years are reviewed based on recent publications and PubMed-searches.", 
    "2": "Improvement in pharmacokinetic parameters may affect both tolerability and efficacy. Modifications to improve tolerability include various valproate analogues, divided into aliphatic amides, cyclic derivatives or amino acid conjugates. Furthermore, there are the carbamazepine analogues oxcarbazepine and eslicarbazepine, the felbamate analogues fluorofelbamate and carisbamate (RWJ 33369), and the lamotrigine analogue JZP-4. The levetiracetam analogues brivaracetam and seletracetam and the derivatives of gabapentin, pregabalin and XP13512, have improved selectivity compared to their parent compounds. Other new drugs have new mechanisms of action related to GABA and glutamate receptors; the glutamate antagonists like topiramate (talampanel and NS-1209), and GABA(A) receptor agonists, benzodiazepine or progesterone analogues (ELB-139 and ganaxolone).",

    "4": "Cannabis is the most frequently detected illicit drug in the Western world, e.g. in cases of driving under the influence of drugs (DUID), whereas benzodiazepines comprise the most abused licit drugs and have been linked with drug-facilitated sexual assault cases (DFSA). In recent years, remarkable advances in sensitive analytical techniques have enabled the analysis of drugs in alternative matrices such as oral fluid and hair. These specimens allow easy, non-invasive sampling, which can be achieved under close supervision to prevent adulteration or substitution of the samples. The volume is often limited and to achieve the required analytical sensitivity, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) methods for the detection of cannabis and benzodiazepines in oral fluid and hair were developed. After validation, these methods were applied to genuine samples to assess: (a) the validity of oral fluid to detect recent cannabis consumption, (b) the Dr\u00e4ger Drug Test as an on-site oral fluid test, and (c) the applicability of hair testing in forensic cases. The latter led to new insights into metabolic conversions between benzodiazepines; this knowledge may avoid potentially erratic conclusions regarding DFSA. Finally, benzodiazepines are also frequently encountered in post-mortem cases. An LCMS-MS method to detect benzodiazepines in larvae and puparia of insects rearing on corpses was developed and validated. In conclusion, this research aimed at combining the usefulness of alternative matrices with the analytical power of LC-MS-MS. Final outcome is a number of sensitive and validated methods ready for use in routine analysis.", 
    "5": "Malignant migrating partial seizures in infancy are rare epilepsy syndrome that begins in the first 6 months of life and characterized by multiple continuous electroencephalographic and electroclinical focal ictal patterns which involved different independent areas of both hemispheres with arrest of psychomotor development. The present detailed review is based on the personal observation of 8 patients newly diagnosed at the Russian Children Clinical hospital, Moscow, Russia. At least three ictal patterns recorded from different independent areas of both hemispheres were fixed by video-EEG-monitoring in all patients. The high polymorphism and very frequent seizures (not less than five types at every child) were observed. The cases were pharmacoresistant, with the absence of reaction to antiepileptic therapy and progressive deterioration in 4 (50%) patients. Decreasing of seizure frequency by 50% was achieved in 3 (37.5%) patients treated with the combination of valproates, benzodiazepines and barbiturates and by 75% in 1 (12.5%) patient case treated with valproates, benzodiazepines and levetyracetam (keppra). The authors proposed a definition of this epileptic syndrome as: \"malignant epilepsy of infancy with migrating multifocal seizures\".", 
    "6": "Heptachlor has been widely used as an insecticide. It is a GABA-A antagonist and causes seizures. It also increases peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) in brain. PBRs are found on the outer mitochondrial membrane in glia, rather than in neurons, and are necessary for steroidogenesis in brain. We compared the effects of acute oral administration of heptachlor (60 mg/ml oil/kg body wt) at 10 ages from postnatal day (PND) 0 to 60 on brain PBR expression and seizure severity in both male and female rats at 1 and 2 hr after administration. From PND 10 through 60, brain PBR expression was increased about 175-225% of controls at both 1 and 2 hr after heptachlor in females. In males however, PBRs were only increased at 30-60 days at 1 hr but not at any age at 2 hr. At 2 hr after heptachlor at 30-60 days in males, PBRs were significantly lower than at 1 hr and even tended to be lower than control levels. By contrast, seizure intensity was greater in males than in females from 10 through 20 days of age at 1 hr and was even greater at 2 hr from 16 through 30 days of age, reflecting the lower PBR levels at 2 hr than at 1 hr in males. Thus, the gender difference in PBR expression was the opposite of the gender difference in seizure intensity. PBRs in brain synthesize several neurosteroids, including allopregnanolone, which is a potent anticonvulsant agent. We hypothesize that the gender differences in seizure intensity after heptachlor were due to the action of heptachlor in greatly increasing PBR expression in females but not in males. Thus the greater expression of PBRs in females would result in more synthesis of allopregnanolone than in males. Therefore, because of allopregnanolone's anticonvulsant effects, seizure intensity was less in females than in males. By comparison, maximal electroshock (MES) caused seizures and increased PBRs in brain in both male and female developing rats with no gender differences at 10-20 days of age.", 
    "7": "The purpose of the study was to present recommendations, relevant to the management of neonates and infants aged 0-1 years, treated in intensive care settings. They include general principles and recommendations for pain and sedation assessment, sedation and pain management and advice on the use of pharmacological strategies. The bolus (on demand) administration of sedative agents should be avoided because of increased risk of cardiovascular depression and/or neurological complications. Midazolam administration time should be limited to 72 hours because of tachyphylaxis, and the possibility of development of a withdrawal syndrome and neurological complications (grade A, LOE 1b). The level of sedation and pain should be regularly assessed and documented, using presented scales; the COMFORT scale is preferred. Opioids, given in continuous infusion, are the drugs of choice for neonatal sedation. To avoid withdrawal syndrome, the total doses and time of administration of sedative agents should be limited. Methadone is a drug of choice in the treatment of a withdrawal (Grade B, LOE 2). Intravenous ketamine is recommended, when short-term sedation/anaesthesia is required (Grade C, LOE 3) for painful and/or stressful intensive care procedures. (Grade C, LOE 2). Muscle relaxants should be used for endotracheal intubation and in the situations when mechanical ventilation is not possible due to maximal respiratory effort of the patient.",

    "37": "Dexmedetomidine is being used off-label as an adjunctive agent for sedation and analgesia in pediatric patients in the critical care unit and for sedation during non-invasive procedures in radiology. It also has a potential role as part of anesthesia care to prevent emergence delirium and postanesthesia shivering. Dexmedetomidine is currently approved by the US FDA for sedation only in adults undergoing mechanical ventilation for <24 hours. Pediatric experiences in the literature are in the form of small studies and case reports. In patients sedated for mechanical ventilation and/or opioid/benzodiazepine withdrawal, the loading dose ranged from 0.5 to 1 microg/kg and was usually administered over 10 minutes, although not all patients received loading doses. This patient group also received a continuous infusion at rates ranging from 0.2 to 2 microg/kg/h, with higher rates used in burn patients and those with withdrawal following > or =24 hours of opioid/benzodiazepine infusion. The dexmedetomidine dosage used for anesthesia and sedation during non-invasive procedures, such as radiologic studies, ranged from a loading dose of 1-2 microg/kg followed by a continuous infusion at 0.5-1.14 microg/kg/h, with most patients spontaneously breathing. For invasive procedures, such as awake craniotomy or cardiac catheterization, dosage ranged from a loading dose of 0.15 to 1 microg/kg followed by a continuous infusion at 0.1-2 microg/kg/h. Adverse hemodynamic and respiratory effects were minimal; the agent was well tolerated in most patients. The efficacy of dexmedetomidine varied depending on the clinical situation: efficacy was greatest during non-invasive procedures, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and lowest during invasive procedures, such as cardiac catheterization. Dexmedetomidine may be useful in pediatric patients for sedation in a variety of clinical situations. The literature suggests potential use of dexmedetomidine as an adjunctive agent to other sedatives during mechanical ventilation and opioid/benzodiazepine withdrawal. In addition, because of its minimal respiratory effects, dexmedetomidine has also been used as a single agent for sedation during non-invasive procedures such as MRI. However, additional studies in pediatric patients are warranted to further evaluate its safety and efficacy in all age ranges.", 
    "38": "2,3-Benzodiazepine derivatives are drug candidates synthesized for potential treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases involving the excessive activity of AMPA receptors. Here we describe a rapid kinetic investigation of the mechanism of inhibition of the GluR2Qflip AMPA receptor channel opening by two 2,3-benzodiazepine derivatives that are structurally similar (BDZ-2 and BDZ-3). Using a laser-pulse photolysis technique with a time resolution of approximately 60 mus, we measured the effects of these inhibitors on both the channel opening rate and the whole-cell current amplitude. We found that both compounds preferably inhibit the open-channel state, although BDZ-2 is a more potent inhibitor in that it inhibits the open-channel state approximately 5-fold stronger than BDZ-3 does. Both compounds bind to the same noncompetitive site. Binding of an inhibitor to the receptor involves the formation of a loose, partially conducting channel intermediate, which rapidly isomerizes to a tighter complex. The isomerization reaction is identified as the main step at which the receptor distinguishes the structural difference between the two compounds. These results suggest that addition of a bulky group at the N-3 position on the diazepine ring, as in BDZ-3, does not alter the mechanism of action, or the site of binding, but does lower the inhibitory potency, possibly due to an unfavorable interaction of a bulky group at the N-3 position with the receptor site. The new mechanistic revelation about the structure-reactivity relationship is useful in designing conformation-specific, more potent noncompetitive inhibitors for the GluR2 AMPA receptor.", 
    "39": "Gelastic seizures comprise a very rare form of epilepsy. They present with recurrent bursts of laughter voices without mirth and are most commonly associated with the evolution of a hypothalamic hamartoma. The purpose of this article is to describe the second reported ictal fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography study in a unique case of an infant with intractable gelastic seizures since the neonatal period associated with a hypothalamic hamartoma. The patient presented at 4 months old with recurrent, almost persistent, gelastic seizures consisting of laughter bouts without mirth. The seizures were noticeable at the first week of life and increased in frequency to last up to 12 hours, namely status gelasticus. These gelastic fits were accompanied with focal motor seizures, including unilateral right-eye blinking and mouth twitching. Developmental mile-stones were intact for age. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cortex demonstrated a large hypothalamic hamartoma within the third ventricle, hampering cerebrovascular fluid drainage of the lateral ventricles. An electroencephalography was nondiagnostic. Ictal fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography demonstrated a large circumscribed hypermetabolic region within the location of the hypothalamic hamartoma, representing localized intense epileptiform activity. The infant became instantly free of all seizure types given minute doses of oral benzodiazepine (clonazepam) and remains completely controlled after 12 months. Her overall development remains intact. This ictal fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography is the second reported study verifying that the main source of the epileptic activity inducing gelastic seizures originates from the hypothalamic hamartoma itself; therefore, a complementary fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography study should be considered in any patient presenting with intractable gelastic seizures, especially in those associated with hypothalamic hamartoma, in order to localize the region of epileptiform activity amenable to surgical resection if intensive drug therapy fails.",

Despite intensive research efforts, the pharmacological actions accounting for the clinical efficacy of valerian remain unclear. Thus, it was the aim of this study to evaluate CNS-related effects of different valerian extracts using behavioral paradigms (mice and rats). Following oral administration two commercially available preparations (extraction solvents: 45% methanol m/m and 70% ethanol v/v), a 35% ethanolic v/v extract and a refined extract derived from it (patented special extract phytofin Valerian 368) were tested for sedative (locomotor activity, ether-induced anaesthesia) and anxiolytic (elevated plus maze) activity. Using the forced swimming and the horizontal wire test the latter two extracts were additionally tested for antidepressant and myorelaxant properties. Up to maximum dosages of 500 or 1000 mg/kg bw none of the valerian extracts displayed sedative effects. Neither spontaneous activity was reduced nor the duration of ether-induced narcosis was prolonged. In contrast, results obtained in the elevated plus maze test revealed a pronounced anxiolytic effect of the 45% methanolic and 35% ethanolic extract as well as of phyotofin Valerian 368 in a dose range of 100-500 mg/kg bw. Additionally and different from its primary extract (35% ethanolic extract) phytofin Valerian 368 showed antidepressant activity in the forced swimming test after subacute treatment. Myorelaxant effects were not observed in dosages up to 1000 mg/kg bw. Due to these findings it is proposed that not sedative but anxiolytic and antidepressant activity, which was elaborated particularly in the special extract phytofin Valerian 368, considerably contribute to the sleep-enhancing properties of valerian.",

In this study, we analyze the topogenesis of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), which integrates into the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) through five hydrophobic transmembrane segments (TMSs) and functions in cholesterol import into the inner membrane. Analyses of in vitro and in vivo import into TOM component-depleted mitochondria reveal that PBR import (1) depends on the import receptor Tom70 but requires neither the Tom20 and Tom22 import receptors nor the import channel Tom40, (2) shares the post-Tom70 pathway with the C-tail-anchored proteins, and (3) requires factors of the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Furthermore, membrane integration of mitofusins and mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase, the MOM proteins with two and four TMSs, respectively, proceeds through the same initial pathway. These findings reveal a previously unidentified pathway of the membrane integration of MOM proteins with multiple TMSs.",

On the other hand, Becquemont et al. demonstrated that UDCA had no influence on intestinal CYP3A activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of UDCA on the intestinal and hepatic CYP3A activities by administration of midazolam (MDZ), as a specific probe for CYP3A activity, in humans. This was a randomized, open-label, crossover study with two phases in 14 healthy volunteers. The volunteers received UDCA (300 mg/day) or placebo orally for 9 days. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenous MDZ (5 microg/kg) and oral MDZ (15 microg/kg) were assessed on days 8 and 9, respectively. The pharmacodynamics of MDZ was estimated by measuring peak saccadic velocity, postural away length, critical fusion flicker frequency, and visual analogue scale. UDCA did not affect the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of intravenous and oral MDZ administrations. Our study suggests that the clinical dosage of UDCA could not affect both hepatic and intestinal CYP3A activities and that the drug interaction between UDCA and substrates for CYP3A is unlikely in humans.",

Midazolam had no sedative action in the youngest rats; sedation increased gradually through postnatal development.", 
    "57": "The results show a striking reversal in the effects of midazolam on nociception and sedation in rats between postnatal days 3 and 10. Midazolam fails to sedate young rats and sensitizes their flexor reflex activity. The sedative and desensitizing effects of midazolam are not observed until later in life after maturation in supraspinal centers.

To target CML stem/progenitor cells, we investigated BMS-214662, a cytotoxic farnesyltransferase inhibitor, previously reported to kill nonproliferating tumor cells. IM or dasatinib alone reversibly arrested proliferation of CML stem/progenitor cells without inducing apoptosis. In contrast, BMS-214662, alone or in combination with IM or dasatinib, potently induced apoptosis of both proliferating and quiescent CML stem/progenitor cells with less than 1% recovery of Philadelphia-positive long-term culture-initiating cells. Normal stem/progenitor cells were relatively spared by BMS-214662, suggesting selectivity for leukemic stem/progenitor cells. The ability to induce selective apoptosis of leukemic stem/progenitor cells was unique to BMS-214662 and not seen with a structurally similar agent BMS-225975. BMS-214662 was cytotoxic against CML blast crisis stem/progenitor cells, particularly in combination with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and equally effective in cell lines harboring wild-type vs mutant BCR-ABL, including the T315I mutation. This is the first report of an agent with activity in resistant and blast crisis CML that selectively kills CML stem/progenitor cells through apoptosis and offers potential for eradication of chronic phase CML.",

Recently, our group has generated cytochrome P450 3A knockout mice to study this drug-handling system in vivo. In the present study, we have characterized the Cyp3a knockout mice by studying the metabolism of midazolam, one of the most widely used probes to assess CYP3A activity. We expected that the midazolam metabolism would be severely reduced in the absence of CYP3A enzymes. We used hepatic and intestinal microsomal preparations from Cyp3a knockout and wild-type mice to assess the midazolam metabolism in vitro. In addition, in vivo metabolite formation was determined after intravenous administration of midazolam. We were surprised to find that our results demonstrated that there is still marked midazolam metabolism in hepatic (but not intestinal) microsomes from Cyp3a knockout mice. Accordingly, we found comparable amounts of midazolam as well as its major metabolites in plasma after intravenous administration in Cyp3a knockout mice compared with wild-type mice. These data suggested that other hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes could take over the midazolam metabolism in Cyp3a knockout mice. We provide evidence that CYP2C enzymes, which were found to be up-regulated in Cyp3a knockout mice, are primarily responsible for this metabolism and that several but not all murine CYP2C enzymes are capable of metabolizing midazolam to its 1'-OH and/or 4-OH derivatives. These data illustrate interesting compensatory changes that may occur in Cyp3a knockout mice. Such flexible compensatory interplay between functionally related detoxifying systems is probably essential to their biological role in xenobiotic protection.",

The rationale for dexmedetomidine use, its dosing, use of other sedatives, and treatment duration were also recorded. Twenty treatment courses in 17 patients (median age 5 mo, range 1 mo-17 yrs) were evaluated. Ten patients (59%) had chronic neurologic impairments (including Down syndrome in nine [53%]). Thirteen (76%) had undergone cardiac surgery, two (12%) had respiratory failure, one (6%) had endocarditis, and one (6%) had undergone scoliosis repair. In 15 (75%) of 20 cases, dexmedetomidine was started to minimize the use of midazolam before extubation; in 13 (87%) of these cases, the patients were extubated within 24 hours.

In the present study, we investigated the possible interaction between cannabinoidergic and GABAergic systems in the anxiety-like behaviour of mice. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55212-2 (0.25-5 mg/kg), the endocannabinoid transport inhibitor AM404 (0.25-2 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.25-8 mg/kg) dose dependently exhibited an anxiolytic effect evaluated in terms of increase in the percentage of time spent in the open arms in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test. Administration of certain fixed-ratio combinations (3:1 and 1:1) of WIN55212-2 and diazepam produced a synergistic anxiolytic effect, while the 1:3 combination produced an additive effect. In hole-board test, administration of certain ratios of WIN55212-2-diazepam combination significantly altered the animal behaviour compared to groups that received each drug alone. Co-administration of AM404 (1 and 2 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) abolished the anxiolytic effect of the former drug in EPM and the latter in hole-board test, respectively. The combination of an ineffective dose of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor, URB597 (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) on anxiety-related responses with an ineffective dose of diazepam (0.25 mg/kg, i.p.) led to a synergistic effect. Co-administration of the CB1 receptor antagonist, AM251 (5 mg/kg) and an effective dose of diazepam (2 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated diazepam-induced elevation of percentage of time spent in open arm, while lower dose of AM251 (0.5 mg/kg) failed to inhibit diazepam-induced anxiolytic effect. Taken together, the present study showed that co-administration of exogenous cannabinoids and diazepam produce additive or synergistic effect at different combinations. Moreover, it has been shown that enhancement of the function of endocannabinoids could increase the anxiolytic effect of diazepam.", 
    "81": "In addition to its clinical antimanic effects, lithium also has efficacy in the treatment of depression. However, the mechanism by which lithium exerts its antidepressant effects is unclear. Our objective was to further characterize the effects of peripheral and central administration of lithium in mouse models of antidepressant efficacy as well as to investigate the role of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors in these behaviors. We utilized the mouse forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST), intracerebroventricular (ICV) lithium administration, AMPA receptor inhibitors, and BS3 crosslinking followed by Western blot. Both short- and long-term administration of lithium resulted in robust antidepressant-like effects in the mouse FST and TST. Using ICV administration of lithium, we show that these effects are due to actions of lithium on the brain, rather than to peripheral effects of the drug. Both ICV and rodent chow (0.4% LiCl) administration paradigms resulted in brain lithium concentrations within the human therapeutic range. The antidepressant-like effects of lithium in the FST and TST were blocked by administration of AMPA receptor inhibitors. Additionally, administration of lithium increased the cell surface expression of GluR1 and GluR2 in the mouse hippocampus. Collectively, these data show that lithium exerts centrally mediated antidepressant-like effects in the mouse FST and TST that require AMPA receptor activation. Lithium may exert its antidepressant effects in humans through AMPA receptors, thus further supporting a role of targeting AMPA receptors as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of depression.", 
    "82": "The effect of lesion of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neurons, produced by p-chloroamphetamine (p-CA; 2 x 10 mg/kg), and the influence of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (10 mg/kg) on the anticonflict action of N-[3,5-dichloro-2-(methoxy)phenyl]-4-(methoxy)-3-(1-piperazinyl)benzenesulfonamide (SB-399885), a selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist, were investigated in the Vogel conflict drinking test in rats. In addition, the interaction between SB-399885 (0.3 mg/kg) and diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) was evaluated in that test. All the compounds tested were administered intraperitoneally. The anticonflict activity produced by SB-399885 (3 mg/kg) was not modified in p-CA-pretreated rats, but it was totally blocked by flumazenil. Combined administration of non-active doses of SB-399885 (0.3 mg/kg) and diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) produced a pronounced anticonflict effect in rats. The present results suggest that the anticonflict activity of SB-399885 is not conditioned by the integrity of 5-HT neurons, and that benzodiazepine receptors are indirectly involved in its effect, possibly due to a functional interaction between 5-HT6 receptors and the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/benzodiazepine system.",

A 76-year-old hypertensive man was admitted to our hospital after suffering multiple syncopal events for the past 2 years prior to admission. He received bilateral surgical and endovascular revascularization for stenotic lesions of the ICA orifices 4 years ago. Intervention consisted of carotid endarterectomy and carotid stenting for the right and left ICAs, respectively. Head T2-weighted magnetic resonance images demonstrated multiple high intensity signals in the basal ganglia bilaterally. To investigate his autonomic function, head-up tilt test, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements, and Valsalva's maneuver were performed. The patient demonstrated marked orthostatic hypotension without increment of heart rate, increased variability of blood pressure and abnormal hypertensive surges in a single 24 hour period, and abnormal response of heart rate during Valsalva's maneuver. These findings were indicative of impaired baroreflex-mediated vasomotor and heart rate control. Other examinations involving hematological analysis, cardiac function assessment, and scintigraphy for pheochromocytoma were within normal limits except for a marked increase in plasma norepinephrine during hypertensive surge. We therefore considered that he had baroreflex failure resulting from previous bilateral ICA orifice revascularization. The patient was given diazepam during hospitalization. After then, his blood pressure stabilized somewhat and syncopal attacks were controlled. Our case suggests that patients, who undergo bilateral ICA orifice revascularization and present with syncopal attacks, should be considered baroreflex failure even if the patient is post-operative several years. Long-term follow up should therefore be necessitated in patients who undergo bilateral carotid revascularization.",

Her condition deteriorated rapidly, and seizures were refractory to any treatment. Seizure frequency and severity increased, incapacitating the patient completely. When seizure control was not achieved by any other treatment, the patient decided to undergo experimental therapy with the ion magnetic inductor. Treatment with the ion magnetic inductor notably reduced the seizure frequency and intensity. After treatment the patient was able to return to work and other normal activities. The long-term effects are not yet known, but there have been no adverse events to date. The patient is still undergoing ion magnetic inductor treatment daily in the same way other epileptic patients must continue with the use of antiepileptic drugs for life. There is evidence in the literature that other types of electromagnetic therapy, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), may be useful for treating refractory seizures.

We developed a novel PET radioligand, [(11)C]PBR28, that was able to image and quantify PBRs in healthy monkeys and in a rat model of stroke. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of [(11)C]PBR28 to quantify PBRs in brain of healthy human subjects. Twelve subjects had PET scans of 120 to 180 min duration as well as serial sampling of arterial plasma to measure the concentration of unchanged parent radioligand. One- and two-tissue compartmental analyses were performed. To obtain stable estimates of distribution volume, which is a summation of B(max)/K(D) and nondisplaceable activity, 90 min of brain imaging was required. Distribution volumes in human were only approximately 5% of those in monkey. This comparatively low amount of receptor binding required a two-rather than a one-compartment model, suggesting that nonspecific binding was a sizeable percentage compared to specific binding. The time-activity curves in two of the twelve subjects appeared as if they had no PBR binding-i.e., rapid peak of uptake and fast washout from brain. The cause(s) of these unusual findings are unknown, but both subjects were also found to lack binding to PBRs in peripheral organs such as lung and kidney. In conclusion, with the exception of those subjects who appeared to have no PBR binding, [(11)C]PBR28 is a promising ligand to quantify PBRs and localize inflammation associated with increased densities of PBRs.",

The majority of the drugs tested were readily detected in CSF specimens. The average CSF/blood ratio for most drugs was in the range of 0.05-0.50. Interpretation of these results is difficult because protein binding, half-life, hydrophobic properties, and pKa of a drug, in addition to survival time after drug use, influence the CSF/blood ratio.

We recruited sexual assault complainants at four clinics in different parts of the U.S. to anonymously provide urine and hair specimens, and to answer questions about suspected drugging, drug use, and the sexual assault incident. Urine and hair specimens were tested for 45 drugs, including ethanol, and those pharmacologically capable of inducing sedation, amnesia, or impairment of judgment. Analytical test results were used to estimate the proportion of subjects, and the proportion of all complainants to the clinic in the same time period, who were victims of DFSA.

This study reviews 176 fatalities ascribed to methadone toxicity by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Kentucky between 2000 and 2004. Postmortem toxicological analysis recorded a more than 10-fold increase in methadone toxicity fatalities, rising from 6 cases in 2000 to 68 cases in 2003. Of the 176 methadone-related fatalities, methadone was the only drug detected in postmortem blood and urine toxicological analyses in 11 (6.25%) cases. The mean methadone blood concentration of all 176 cases was 0.535 mg / L (0.02-4.0). The following psychoactive medications were detected: antidepressants (39.8%), benzodiazepines (32.4%), and other opioids in addition to methadone (27.8%). Cannabinoids were detected in 44 (28.4%) cases and cocaine or metabolite in 34 (21.9%) cases. Of the 95 cases with a known history of methadone use, 46 (48.4%) involved prescription by private physician.

This study reports the results of a meta-analysis of existing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of AAs as a monotherapy or augmentation therapy for the treatment of patients with PTSD. Seven RCTs were identified through extensive scans of databases, which included PubMed, MedLine, the National PTSD Center Pilots database, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Abstracts Library of the American Psychiatric Association with predefined inclusion criteria. Dichotomous and continuous measures were performed using a fixed effects model, heterogeneity was assessed, and subgroup analyses were done. Data from seven RCTs involving a total of 192 PTSD patients (102 randomized to AAs and 90 randomized to placebo) were analyzed. The results show that AAs may have a beneficial effect in the treatment of PTSD, as indicated by the changes from baseline in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale total scores [standardized mean difference (SMD)=-0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) (-0.75, -0.14), P=0.004].

In the current study we examined training-induced changes in the expression of GABA(A)-related genes and the binding of GABA receptor radioligands in the amygdala after the acquisition and extinction of Pavlovian fear. Using in situ hybridization, we examined the expression pattern changes of mRNAs for GABAergic markers in the lateral, basolateral and central subdivisions of the amygdala in C57Bl/6J mice. These markers included GABA-synthesizing enzymes (GAD67 and GAD65), major GABA(A) receptor subunits (alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, alpha5, beta2 and gamma2) and the expression of mRNAs that are involved in a variety of GABA-related intracellular processes, including GABA transporter-1 (GAT1), GABA(A) receptor-associated protein and the GABA(A) clustering protein, gephyrin. With fear conditioning, we found decreased mRNA levels of alpha1, alpha5 and GAD67, as well as deceased benzodiazepine binding in the amygdala. Fear extinction induced an increase in mRNA levels of alpha2, beta2, GAD67 and gephyrin, as well as a decrease in GAT1. Together, these findings indicate that the acquisition of fear induced a downregulation of mRNA markers related to a decrease in amygdala GABAergic function, whereas the acquisition of fear extinction produced an upregulation of GABAergic markers related to enhanced GABAergic transmission.",

    "156": "Benzodiazepines are known to modulate the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis by antagonizing the effects of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRH). Besides regulating the HPA axis CRH evolves properties of a neurotransmitter in the limbic system that is closely involved in the delivery of the emotional consequences of the stress response. At a superordinated level Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and Cholecystokinin (CCK) affect the release of CRH and modulate thereby the intensity of the physiological stress response. Benzodiazepine treatment interferes not only with the release of CRH but also with the release of NPY and CCK. Alterations in the intracortical ratio of NPY, CCK and CRH are correlated with behavioural changes like increased respectively decreased anxiety and subsequent alterations in the activity of the HPA axis. Recent research offers the possibility that the alterations of plasma levels of these neuropeptides are not only a secondary phenomenon due to drug intake, but that low levels of those neuropeptides that modulate anxiety and fear can possibly explain addiction to substances that counterbalance these deficits. Depending on the available results possible implications of NPY and CCK on benzodiazepine addiction and withdrawal symptoms are reviewed, thereby providing topics for further research.",

Eh treatment (200 mg/kg, p.o.; seven days) showed marked anti-anxiety activity in chronic immobilization stress. In contrast, the forced swim stress-induced anxiety was only partially decreased by Eh. Co-treatment of rats with flumazenil (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), bicuculline (1 mg/kg, i.p.) or picrotoxin (1 mg/kg, i.p.) resulted in a significant reduction of anxiolytic effect of Eh indicating that its actions are mediated through GABA(A) receptor-benzodiazepine receptor-Cl(-) channel complex.

Because patients with manic symptoms often experience clinical benefit from treatment with anticonvulsant drugs, it was hypothesized that retigabine, a novel compound with anticonvulsant efficacy, may also possess antimanic activity. The amphetamine (AMPH)+chlordiazepoxide (CDP)-induced hyperactivity model has been proposed as a suitable model for studying antimanic-like activity of novel compounds in mice and rats. The aims of the present study in rats were therefore (1) to confirm previous findings with lithium and lamotrigine, and (2) to evaluate the effect of the novel compound retigabine on AMPH+CDP-induced hyperactivity in rats. In all experiments, co-administration of AMPH and CDP induced a significant increase (191-295%) in locomotor activity. Lithium chloride (0.9 mg/kg) and lamotrigine (20 mg/kg), which are known to effectively stabilize mood in humans, both significantly decreased AMPH+CDP-induced locomotor activity without affecting basal locomotor activity. The results furthermore indicate that retigabine, like lithium and lamotrigine, significantly and dose-dependently attenuates the induced hyperactivity at a lowest effective dose of 1.0 mg/kg, whereas basal locomotor activity is reduced only at doses 4.0 mg/kg. In conclusion, retigabine was found to have an antimanic-like effect in the AMPH+CDP-induced hyperactivity model, suggesting a potential role for retigabine in the treatment of mania and possibly in the management of bipolar disorder.", 
    "169": "J. H. Kim, G. McNally, and R. Richardson (2006) reported that pretest injection of FG7142, a GABA inverse agonist, alleviated infantile amnesia in rats. From this, it was concluded that GABAergic neurotransmission is involved in the forgetting seen in the developing rat. The present study extends that finding by examining the role of GABA in the reactivation of a forgotten memory in the infant rat. Sixteen-day-old rats were conditioned to fear a white noise. When tested 3 days later, rats that had not received a reminder treatment exhibited substantial forgetting. Reactivation of memory (as assessed by high levels of freezing) was observed in rats that were given a reminder shock and injected with saline the day before test. However, rats given a reminder shock and injected with midazolam immediately afterward failed to exhibit the reactivation effect. A subsequent experiment replicated this finding and further showed that midazolam did not reduce the memory reactivation effect when injected 2 hr after the reminder episode. From this, it appears that alterations in GABAergic neurotransmission may be an underlying process mediating memory reactivation in the infant rat.",

We investigated the involvement of two norepinephrine transporter gene polymorphisms in response to antipsychotics, comparing patients with strong and weak response to olanzapine and risperidone. We prospectively assessed short-term drug response in 75 Caucasian schizophrenic patients treated with these drugs, using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. We then assessed the association between two SLC6A2 gene polymorphisms and drug response in this sample. No significant difference in genotype distribution was found between responders and non-responders, for the G1287A or T-182C polymorphism. The improvement in PANSS positive subscore was significantly greater in patients homozygous for the A1287 allele than in other patients, and significantly smaller in patients homozygous for the C-182 allele than in other patients. Our results suggest that these polymorphisms are specifically involved in the variation of positive symptoms in schizophrenic patients.", 
    "171": "Diazepam (DZP) enhances GABA action at GABA(A) receptor. Chronic prenatal administration of DZP delays the appearance of neonatal reflexes. We examined whether maternal intake of DZP might affect respiratory control system in newborn rats (0-3 day-old). This study was conducted on unrestrained animals and medulla-spinal cord preparations. In addition, the level of expression of the genes encoding for the alpha1 and alpha2 subunits of the GABA(A) receptor was assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. In rats exposed to DZP, the respiratory frequency was significantly lower and the tidal volume higher than in controls with no significant alteration of the minute ventilation. The recovery from moderate hypoxia was delayed compared to controls. The respiratory-like frequency of medullary spinal cord preparation from DZP-exposed neonates was higher than in the control group. Acute applications of DZP (1 microM) to these preparations increased respiratory-like frequency in both groups, but this facilitation was attenuated following prenatal DZP exposure. The present data indicate that prenatal exposure to DZP alters both eupneic breathing and the respiratory response to hypoxia. These effects might partly be ascribed to the down-regulation of the expression of genes encoding GABA(A) receptor subunits. On the other hand, the effects of DZP exposure on reduced preparations suggested changes in the GABA(A) receptor efficiency and/or disruption of the normal development of the medullary respiratory network.", 
    "172": "Ligand-gated ion channels respond to specific neurotransmitters by transiently opening an integral membrane ion-selective pore, allowing ions to move down their electrochemical gradient. A distinguishing feature of all members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily is the presence of a 13-amino acid disulfide loop (Cys-loop) in the extracellular ligand-binding domain. Structural data derived from the acetylcholine receptor place this loop at the interface between the ligand-binding domain and the transmembrane pore-forming domain where it is ideally located to participate in coupling ligand binding to channel opening. We have introduced specific mutations into a conserved motif at the mid-point of the Cys-loop of the GABA A receptor subunits alpha1, beta2 and gamma2S where the sequence reads aromatic, proline, aliphatic (ArProAl motif). Receptors carrying a mutation in the Cys-loop of one of their subunits were expressed in L929 cells and responses to both GABA and drugs were assessed using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Drug potentiation and direct activation were significantly enhanced by mutations in this Cys-loop but these effects were subunit-dependent. Currents in response to agonists were larger when mutations were carried in the alpha and beta subunits but not in the gamma subunit. In contrast, potentiation of current responses by diazepam, etomidate and pentobarbital were all enhanced when mutations were carried in the alpha and gamma subunits, but not the beta subunit. Since the disruption of interactions mediated through the ArProAl motif enhances the mutant receptor's response to both agonist and drugs we suggest that this motif in the Cys-loop of the wild-type receptor participates in interactions that create activation barriers to conformational changes during channel gating.", 
    "173": "In the search for AMPA receptor (AMPAR) antagonists, 2,3-benzodiazepines represent a family of specific noncompetitive antagonists with anticonvulsant and neuroprotective properties. We have previously shown that 2,3-benzodiazepin-4-ones possess marked anticonvulsant properties and high affinity for the noncompetitive binding site of the AMPAR complex. In this paper, we report the synthesis and pharmacological characterization of a full set of 2,3-benzodiazepin-4-ones in order to better define the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of this class of compounds. Binding assays and functional tests were performed to evaluate the antagonistic activity at the AMPARs. Through these results we have identified a potent AMPAR antagonist, 1-(4-amino-3-methylphenyl)-3,5-dihydro-7,8-ethylenedioxy-4H-2,3-benzodiazepin-4-one (5c). This compound noncompetitively inhibited AMPAR-mediated toxicity in primary mouse hippocampal cultures with an IC(50) of 1.6muM and blocked kainate-induced calcium influx in rat cerebellar granule cells with an IC(50) of 6.4muM. Thus, 5c has the in vitro potential as therapeutic drug in the treatment of various neurological disorders.", 
    "174": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the intestinal cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (CYP3A) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) functions using midazolam and rhodamine-123 as specific substrates of CYP3A and P-gp, respectively. Perfused everted intestinal segments from rats were employed to determine the effects of DHA on midazolam metabolism and rhodamine-123 transport. In addition, the effects of DHA on in vitro midazolam metabolism in rat intestinal microsomes and on midazolam bioavailability in rats were examined. The intestinal extraction ratio (ER G) of midazolam was determined to be 0.43 and decreased significantly to 0.12, 0.07, and 0.06 in the presence of 50, 100, and 200 microM DHA, respectively, in a concentration-dependent manner. The results from an in vitro study using rat intestinal microsomes demonstrated that DHA competitively inhibited the intestinal CYP3A activity with Ki of 15.7 and 27.1 microM for the formations of 1'-OH midazolam and 4-OH midazolam, respectively. Moreover, the oral administration of DHA (100mg/kg) increased the AUC infinity, Cmax, and oral bioavailability (F) of midazolam by about 50% in rats, without affecting the T 1/2, V dss/F, or CL tot/F. In contrast, DHA did not change the serosal-to-mucosal transport of rhodamine-123 in the perfused everted intestine and oral administration of DHA (100mg/kg) had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered midazolam in rats, thus suggesting that DHA has little effect on the intestinal P-gp activity and hepatic clearance of midazolam. This study provided the first direct evidence to show that DHA has an inhibitory effect on the intestinal pre-systemic metabolism of a CYP3A substrate and that DHA has little, if any, effect on the P-gp activity in the gut.", 
    "175": "3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and methamphetamine (METH) are amphetamine analogues with similar persistent neurochemical effects in the mouse which some have described as neurotoxicity. We attempted to identify dose regimens of MDMA and METH with similar effects on behavioral and physiological variables in the mouse, then quantified the effects of these dose regimens on neurochemistry and microglial markers. Four discrete injections of saline, MDMA (10, 20, or 30 mg/kg), or METH (5 or 10 mg/kg) were administered to mice at 2 h intervals. Body weight was quantified immediately before each injection, and 2 h after the last injection, while core temperature and locomotor activity were continuously monitored via radiotelemetry. Mice were killed 72 h after the final injection and brains were rapidly dissected on ice. Dopamine content in various brain regions was quantified via high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), and microglial activation was assessed by saturation binding of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligand 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide ([(3)H]PK11195). Specific dose regimens of MDMA and METH induced similar reductions in body weight, depletions of dopamine and its metabolites, and similar hyperthermic and locomotor stimulant effects, but only METH activated microglia in striatum. These results suggest that repeated high doses of MDMA and METH that produce hyperthermia, locomotor stereotypy, weight loss and neurochemical depletion are not consistently accompanied by microglial activation. The finding that METH, but not MDMA, induces microglial effects in the striatum consistent with neurotoxicity might imply different mechanisms of toxic action for these two psychostimulants.", 
    "176": "The second generation antipsychotic drugs, such as risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine, are effective in treating patients with schizophrenia and have been considered as the first line therapy. Recently, increasing attention has been drawn to the potential diabetogenic effect of these novel antipsychotics. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of metformin treatment on the olanzapine-induced metabolic disturbance in schizophrenic patients. Twenty-four schizophrenic subjects who had received olanzapine treatment at least 3 months were assigned to the therapy with metformin 1500 mg/day for 8 weeks. The metabolic parameters were quantitatively assessed at baseline, weeks 2, 4, and 8 by using the intravenous glucose tolerance test. After an 8-week treatment with metformin, the body weight, fasting levels of glucose, triglyceride, and insulin, insulin secretion, and insulin resistance significantly decreased. Half of study subjects with metabolic syndrome obtained improvement after the metformin trial. Subjects' psychopathological condition remained unchanged during the study period. The olanzapine-induced metabolic disturbance could be reversed after 8-week metformin treatment. Based on the results of this study, we hypothesize that metformin could modulate the effect of olanzapine-induced metabolic disturbance.", 
    "177": "The main method of evaluating the DNA interstrand cross-linking ability of cancer chemotherapeutic agents in naked DNA currently involves the electrophoresis of relatively long radiolabeled duplex DNA fragments (typically approximately 2000 bp) on neutral gels after incubation with the agent of interest. Denaturation by heating is carried out prior to loading, and a neutral gel allows reannealing of cross-linked DNA. To avoid the use of radioactivity we have developed a new method based on ion pair reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS) that allows characterization and quantitation of drug-DNA interstrand cross-links formed within short oligonucleotide duplexes (i.e., 12 bp). Advantages of this assay include rapid throughput, as compared to electrophoretic methods, and the use of readily available short nonradiolabeled oligonucleotides of any sequence, thereby facilitating investigation of sequence selectivity. A further advantage is that all species separated by the chromatographic process can be positively identified by MS. Using this new method, we have investigated the rate of DNA cross-linking and sequence selectivity of the interstrand cross-linking agent SJG-136, a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer currently in phase I clinical trials. The assay was found to be sufficiently sensitive and selective to allow separation of the unbound and drug-bound oligonucleotide species by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and to allow positive identification of these individual species by MS. A further benefit, as compared with electrophoretic methods, is that kinetic information can be obtained and compared for different binding sequences.", 
    "178": "Anticonvulsants have been used for the treatment of impulsive aggression since the 1980s. A 50-year-old man suffered from irritability and agitation after developing a right ipsilateral frontal lobe infarction as a result of Moyamoya disease; these symptoms caused difficulties with his working and interpersonal relationships. The patient had been treated using multiple benzodiazepine agents for 2 years but his symptoms had not improved. However, after treatment with carbamazepine (CBZ; 200 mg) was begun, the patient's irritability and agitation gradually decreased. The efficacy of CBZ treatment in this patient suggests a method for controlling benzodiazepine-resistant impulsive aggression.", 
    "179": "Reported herein is a case of methamphetamine psychosis in which tardive dystonia was treated successfully with clonazepam. The patient was a 69-year-old man who had taken methamphetamine habitually for approximately 40 years. Auditory hallucinations had developed 25 years previously, for which haloperidol had been prescribed. Tardive dystonia had developed in December 2005. Haloperidol was withdrawn and risperidone or olanzapine alone had been administered, but neither had improved the dystonic posture. However, when clonazepam was added, a gradual improvement in the dystonic posture became evident. Tardive dystonia is currently treated on a trial-and-error basis. Accumulation of further cases similar to the present one is very important for establishing an effective treatment.", 
    "180": "The objectives of this retrospective, naturalistic study were to provide preliminary data on the effects of 6 months treatment with risperidone, olanzapine and quetiapine on behavioral disturbances, within a sample of outpatients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, and on predictors of response. Between July 2005 and December 2005, data were collected from 58 consecutive outpatients with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease with behavioral disturbances, who received a 6-month treatment with risperidone, olanzapine or quetiapine. Primary outcome measures were Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score and its items forming the basic core of behavioral disturbances in Alzheimer's disease: delusions, hallucinations and agitation/aggressiveness. Secondary outcome measures were Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Activities of Daily Living, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and Clinical Insight Rating scale. Correlations between baseline MMSE score and improvements in behavioral disturbances were investigated. At 6 months mean NPI total score had fallen 43.5% in the risperidone group, 45.6% in the olanzapine group and 33.3% in the quetiapine group, with no significant between-group differences. Global cognitive function showed no significant change from baseline to end-point. Incidence of adverse events was low. A significant correlation was found between MMSE score and NPI total score and NPI item agitation decreases. Risperidone, olanzapine and quetiapine produced significant improvements in behavioral disturbances and were well tolerated. No significant differences emerged among treatments. The preliminary results also suggest that baseline cognitive function might influence treatment response.", 
    "181": "Experience programs synaptic development to match the needs of the environment. This process depends on the nature and timing of the experience. Exposure to stress during adolescence selectively reduces synaptic density in the prefrontal cortex (a later maturing region), while sparing hippocampal synapses (an earlier maturing region). To determine whether the anatomical effects of an adolescent social stressor in rats endures into adulthood and are reversible, male subjects were isolation or group housed between days 30 and 35 and then treated with vehicle, adinazolam, MK-801, or tianeptine between days 40 and 55. At day 60, immunohistochemistry revealed a 13.5% +/- 5.3% reduction in synaptophysin in the infralimbic cortex and cingulate gyrus in isolation-housed subjects. MK-801 and adinazolam restored cortical synaptic density to within 2% of group-housed values, suggesting that the synaptic loss induced by stress during adolescence is modulated through reduced glutamatergic activity directly by NMDA antagonism or indirectly by enhancing GABAergic activity. Tianeptine did not modulate adolescent stress effects in the prefrontal cortex. None of these drugs increased cortical synaptophysin in group-housed controls. Increased synaptophysin was observed in the group-housed condition in the hippocampus, striatum, and nucleus accumbens following drug exposure. Although stress did not decrease synaptic density in these regions, drug exposure failed to increase synaptic density when compared with the controls. Taken together, stress-induced changes in cortical, but not hippocampal, synaptic density initiated during adolescence endure into adulthood. These cortical changes can be reversed through a reduction of glutamatergic activity, but not serotonin augmentation.", 
    "182": "An RP-HPLC method for the simultaneous separation and determination of olanzapine (OLZ) and its process impurities in bulk drugs and pharmaceutical formulations was developed. The separation was accomplished on Inertsil ODS 3V (4.6 mm x 250 mm; particle size 5 microm) column using 0.2 M ammonium acetate (pH = 4.50) and ACN as mobile phase in gradient elution mode. The analytes were monitored by a photo diode array (PDA) detector set at 254 nm and the flow rate was kept at 1.0 mL/min. The chromatographic behavior of all the compounds was examined under variable compositions of different solvents, buffer concentrations, and pH. The method was validated in terms of accuracy, precision, and linearity. Four unknown process impurities observed consistently during the analysis of different batches of OLZ were isolated and characterized by ESI-MS/MS, (1)H NMR, and FT-IR. The proposed RP-HPLC method was successfully applied to the analysis of commercial formulations. The method could be of use not only for rapid and routine evaluation of the quality of OLZ in bulk drug manufacturing units but also for the detection of its impurities in pharmaceutical formulations.", 
    "183": "Higher doses of benzodiazepines induce sedation. However, in low to moderate doses, benzodiazepines can increase aggressive behavior both after acute and chronic administration. The determinants for increasing aggression after chronic intake of flunitrazepam, a so-called date rape drug, in violence-prone individuals are incompletely understood.", 
    "184": "The aim of this study is to assess the effects of acute and chronic treatment with flunitrazepam on male aggression in resident rats.

The salient aggressive and non-aggressive elements in the resident rat's behavior were analyzed. Initially, the dose-dependent effects of flunitrazepam (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.18, and 0.3 mg/kg) or vehicle were determined in all rats; subsequently, 0.3 mg/kg per day flunitrazepam was administered for 42 days (n = 15), and a parallel group was treated with vehicle (n = 20). After the chronic treatment, the flunitrazepam (0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.18, and 0.3 mg/kg) effects were again assessed.", 
    "186": "The most significant finding is the escalation of aggression after chronic treatment with flunitrazepam. A previously sedative 0.3 mg/kg dose of flunitrazepam engendered very high levels of attack bites, sideways threats, and aggressive postures (total aggression) after 6 weeks of daily administration. Individual differences emerged, and these were associated with decreased binding to benzodiazepine receptors, mainly in the limbic structures such as the cingulate cortex (cingulate areas 1 and 2) and caudate-putamen (posterior part) of aggressive animals, suggesting that these areas are pivotal in the control of emotional and aggressive behavior.",

    "188": "The subunit composition of GABA(A) receptors influences their biophysical and pharmacological properties, dictates neuronal location and the interaction with associated proteins, and markedly influences the impact of intracellular biochemistry. The focus has been on alpha and gamma subunits, with little attention given to beta subunits. Dentate gyrus granule cells (DGGCs) express all three beta subunit isoforms and exhibit both synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors that mediate 'phasic' and 'tonic' transmission, respectively. To investigate the subcellular distribution of the beta subunits we have utilized the patch-clamp technique to compare the properties of 'tonic' and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) recorded from DGGCs of hippocampal slices of P20-26 wild-type (WT), beta(2)(-/-), beta(2N265S) (etomidate-insensitive), alpha(1)(-/-) and delta(-/-) mice. Deletion of either the beta(2) or the delta subunit produced a significant reduction of the tonic current and attenuated the increase of this current induced by the delta subunit-preferring agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol (THIP). By contrast, mIPSCs were not influenced by deletion of these genes. Enhancement of the tonic current by the beta(2/3) subunit-selective agent etomidate was significantly reduced for DGGCs derived from beta(2N265S) mice, whereas this manipulation had no effect on the prolongation of mIPSCs produced by this anaesthetic. Collectively, these observations, together with previous studies on alpha(4)(-/-) mice, identify a population of extrasynaptic alpha(4)beta(2)delta receptors, whereas synaptic GABA(A) receptors appear to primarily incorporate the beta(3) subunit. A component of the tonic current is diazepam sensitive and is mediated by extrasynaptic receptors incorporating alpha(5) and gamma(2) subunits. Deletion of the beta(2) subunit had no effect on the diazepam-induced current and therefore these extrasynaptic receptors do not contain this subunit. The unambiguous identification of these distinct pools of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors should aid our understanding of how they act in harmony, to regulate hippocampal signalling in health and disease.", 
    "189": "The effects of oxytocin on gastric emptying, gastrointestinal transit, and plasma levels of cholecystokinin (CCK) were studied in ovariectomized rats. Gastrointestinal motility was assessed in rats 15 min after intragastric instillation of a test meal containing charcoal and Na2 51CrO4. Gastric emptying was determined by measuring the amount of radiolabeled chromium contained in the small intestine as a percentage of the initial amount received. Gastrointestinal transit was evaluated by calculating the geometric center of distribution of the radiolabeled marker. Blood samples were collected for CCK radioimmunoassay. After administration of oxytocin (0.2-0.8 mg/kg), gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit were inhibited, whereas plasma concentration of CCK was increased in a dose-dependent manner. Atosiban, an oxytocin receptor antagonist, effectively attenuated the oxytocin-induced inhibition of gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit. However, administration of atosiban alone had no effect on gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit. The selective CCK1 receptor antagonists, devazepide and lorglumide, effectively attenuated the oxytocin-induced inhibition of gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit. L-365, 260, a selective CCK2 receptor antagonist, did not alter the oxytocin-induced inhibition of gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit. These results suggest that oxytocin inhibits gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit in ovariectomized rats via a mechanism involving the stimulation of CCK release and CCK1 receptor activation.",

    "194": "Given the well-established role of benzodiazepines in treating anxiety disorders, beta-carbolines, spanning a spectrum from full agonists to full inverse agonists at the benzodiazepine allosteric site for the GABA(A) receptor, can provide valuable insight into the neural mechanisms underlying anxiety-related physiology and behavior. FG-7,142 is a partial inverse agonist at the benzodiazepine allosteric site with its highest affinity for the alpha1 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptor, although it is not selective. FG-7,142 also has its highest efficacy for modulation of GABA-induced chloride flux mediated at the alpha1 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptor. FG-7,142 activates a recognized anxiety-related neural network and interacts with serotonergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic, and noradrenergic modulatory systems within that network. FG-7,142 has been shown to induce anxiety-related behavioral and physiological responses in a variety of experimental paradigms across numerous mammalian and non-mammalian species, including humans. FG-7,142 has proconflict actions across anxiety-related behavioral paradigms, modulates attentional processes, and increases cardioacceleratory sympathetic reactivity and neuroendocrine reactivity. Both acute and chronic FG-7,142 treatment are proconvulsive, upregulate cortical adrenoreceptors, decrease subsequent actions of GABA and beta-carboline agonists, and increase the effectiveness of subsequent GABA(A) receptor antagonists and beta-carboline inverse agonists. FG-7,142, as a partial inverse agonist, can help to elucidate individual components of full agonism of benzodiazepine binding sites and may serve to identify the specific GABA(A) receptor subtypes involved in specific behavioral and physiological responses.",

In vitro characterization of raltegravir inhibition potential was assessed against a panel of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. An open-label, 2-period study was conducted to assess the effect of raltegravir on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, a sensitive CYP 3A4 probe substrate: period 1, 2.0 mg of midazolam; period 2, 400 mg of raltegravir every 12 hours for 14 days with 2.0 mg of midazolam on day 14. There was no meaningful in vitro effect of raltegravir on inhibition of a panel of CYP enzymes and induction of CYP 3A4. In the presence of raltegravir, midazolam area under the curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) and maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) geometric mean ratios were similar (geometric mean ratios and 90% confidence intervals: 0.92 [0.82, 1.03] (P = .208) and 1.03 [0.87, 1.22] (P = .751), respectively). No substantial differences were observed in T(max) (P = .750) or apparent half-life (P = .533) of midazolam. Plasma levels of midazolam were not substantially affected by raltegravir, which implies that raltegravir is not a clinically important inducer or inhibitor of CYP 3A4 and that raltegravir would not be expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of other drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 to a clinically meaningful extent.",

We assessed basic sociodemographic information, self-reported khat use, and how respondents perceived the use of khat, cannabis (which includes both hashish and marijuana), psychoactive tablets (e.g., benzodiazepines), alcohol, solvents, and hemp seeds in their units. The cautious interpretation of our data suggest that sociodemographic characteristics and drug use among military personnel differ substantially between northern and southern/central Somalia. In total, 36.4% (99% confidence interval [CI] 19.3%-57.7%) of respondents reported khat use in the week before the interview, whereas in some regions of southern/central Somalia khat use, especially excessive use, was reported more frequently. Self-reported khat use differed substantially from the perceived use in units. According to the perception of respondents, the most frequent form of drug use is khat chewing (on average, 70.1% in previous week, 99% CI 63.6%-76.5%), followed by smoking cannabis (10.7%, 99% CI 0%-30.4%), ingesting psychoactive tablets (8.5%, 99% CI 0%-24.4%), drinking alcohol (5.3%, 99% CI 0%-13.8%), inhaling solvents (1.8%, 99% CI 0%-5.1%), and eating hemp seeds (0.6%, 99% CI 0%-2.0%).

Then, spleen cells were collected and the in vitro activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) was measured using flow cytometry. The in vitro activity of CTL against EL4 was significantly greater after propofol injection compared with its vehicle (Intralipid) or saline. Midazolam had no effect on CTL activity. We also studied whether tumor growth in vivo was affected by the administration of propofol. Tumor growth was significantly suppressed in mice that were given propofol, compared with tumor growth in mice given saline. Therefore, it is concluded that propofol may have a beneficial effect on antitumor immunity in mice.", 
    "208": "The direct radioreceptor assay was used to elucidate the interactions of clinically employed atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine with the specific binding sites in rat brain membranes. Tritium-labeled olanzapine was obtained by isotope exchange method. HPLC and mass spectrometry assays confirmed the identity of [3H]-olanzapine to the initial compound. The specific [3H]-olanzapine binding sites of the two types were identified in frontal cortex by means of the method of Scatchard's plots. High affinity sites showed steady-state dissociation binding constant (KD) of 1.7 nM, which is indicative of olanzapine affinity to 5-HT-2a and histamine receptors. However, according to available literature data, the density of these receptors is several times smaller than that determined in our study (maximum number of binding sites corresponded to B(max) = 1.4 pmol/mg protein), thus allowing an assumption about the existence of yet unknown binding sites of the antipsychotic drug under consideration. Moderate affinity binding sites of olanzapine in frontal cortex (KD= 68.5 nM, B(max) = 10.8 pmol/mg protein) apparently correspond to dopamine, muscarinic, and alpha-1-adrenoceptors. [3H]olanzapine binding sites of the two types were also determined in striatum. The moderate-affinity sites of the receptor interaction had KD = 18.0 nM and B(max) = 13.0 pmol/mg protein. These values in fact correspond to D2 receptors, whose density prevails in this cortical region. The low-affinity binding sites of olanzapine in striatum had KD = 117.0 nM and B(max) = 32.5 pmol/mg protein."
