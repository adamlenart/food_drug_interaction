Since pharmaco-kinetic processes, i.e., absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of drugs, largely determine the intensity and duration of drug action, such knowledge is useful as a guideline for drug therapy in the newborn period. Both in vitro and in vivo studies dealing with pre-and postnatal drug metabolism in humans and animal species are reviewed. The liver is considered the principle organ of drug metabolism. Animal fetuses seem to have a negligible capacity to oxidize and conjugate drugs. After birth the capacity increases at different rates, depending on the species, the type of reaction, and the type of drug. There is, on the other hand, evidence that drug metabolism occurs in human fetuses. The human fetal liver contains the drug-metabolizing enzyme system early in gestation. The data which argues for and that arguing against the concept of low drug-oxidizing capacity in the newborn is summarized. The old concepts regarding drug metabolism during the early part of life need reevaluation.", 
    "1": "1. The intravenous administration of 5 and 10 mg of diazepam caused anterograde amnesia in 50 and 90% of adults, the peak effect occurring in 2-3 min and action persisting for 20-30 minutes.2. Hyoscine (0.4 and 0.6 mg) caused amnesia in 35 and 50% of patients with peak effect not occurring until 50-80 min after injection and action persisting for at least 120 minutes.3. With neither drug was there any relationship between the incidence of amnesia and the degree of drowsiness.4. Amnesia was not observed after saline or after 50 mg pethidine.5. On questioning 6 h after a short operation many patients had no memory of an object which they clearly recognized and described 1 h after surgery."
