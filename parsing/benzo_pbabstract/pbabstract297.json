We assessed whether fentanyl-induced brain damage is attenuated by using anticonvulsant drugs. Using halothane/nitrous oxide anesthesia, 40 Sprague-Dawley rats underwent tracheal intubation, arterial and venous cannulation, and insertion of biparietal electroencephalogram electrodes and a rectal temperature probe. Halothane was discontinued. The dose of IV fentanyl shown previously to cause maximal brain damage was given to all animals and N(2)O was discontinued. Control rats were given fentanyl only. Rats in the three study groups also received midazolam, phenytoin, or N(2)O/naloxone. After characteristic seizure activity began with fentanyl loading the study drug was started. After a 2-h infusion, wounds were closed, and animals recovered overnight and underwent cerebral perfusion-fixation. Neuropathologic alterations were ranked on a scale of 0-5 for both neuronal death (0 = normal, 5 = more than 75% neuronal death) and for malacia. Significantly fewer rats in the N(2)O/Naloxone, Phenytoin, and Midazolam Groups sustained any brain damage compared with controls. Protection against opioid neurotoxicity is achieved with midazolam, naloxone, and phenytoin. If opioid neurotoxicity is clinically relevant, a small change in anesthetic practice might reduce any potential neurologic morbidity.",

    "2": "Clinically unaffected sons of male alcoholics differ from controls without a family history of alcoholism in two respects: increased autonomic reactivity to aversive as well as non-aversive stimuli and increased attenuation of these responses by alcohol. This pattern of autonomic hyper-reactivity and alcohol-induced stress response dampening (SRD) might be a trait marker of genetic vulnerability and is often interpreted in terms of a diathesis stress model of alcohol dependence. Forty-five alcohol-dependent men (mean age: 39.20 years) and 37 healthy controls (mean age: 35.03 years) participated in a double-blind cross-over study in two experimental sessions each. The benzodiazepine lorazepam was selected as an alcohol substitute. Autonomic reactivity and lorazepam-induced SRD were assessed during incentive and non-incentive reaction time tasks as well as mental arithmetics. Alcohol-dependent men showed elevated resting heart rate levels and increased number of non-specific electrodermal responses. Evidence for autonomic hyper-reactivity was found for a subgroup of alcoholics with a family history of alcoholism.", 
    "3": "The primary goal of treatment in nonepileptic seizures (NES) is to improve the patient's quality of life by terminating seizure production or reducing seizure frequency. Initial treatment consists of explaining the diagnosis and its psychological nature to patients without judging them or giving the NES excessive attention. Next, help patients identify stresses and refer them for mental health treatment. Neurologists should continue to see patients intermittently to wean anticonvulsants, and encourage compliance with mental health care. Psychiatric treatment of NES has the following three aims: 1) Help patients identify and eliminate contributing stresses. 2) Teach better coping mechanisms and increased expression of suppressed feelings that are being communicated somatically. 3) Diagnose and treat comorbid psychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety, dissociation, or post-traumatic symptoms. The mainstay of psychiatric treatment for NES is some kind of individual or family psychotherapy or hypnosis. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant medications (first-line drugs) or tricyclic antidepressants (second-line drugs) may be needed to treat comorbid depression, panic, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but medications should nearly always be combined with psychotherapeutic approaches. Benzodiazepines should be used only with psychotherapy to teach better coping. Families or caregivers may need to learn behavior modification to minimize covert environmental rewards for NES. With proper diagnosis and treatment, about 45% of patients will become seizure-free, and another one third of patients will show reduced seizure frequency.", 
    "4": "Many poststroke complications are preventable. There are few data comparing the efficacy of specific, standard physiotherapeutic approaches with each other or with the incidence of spontaneous recovery. More intensive physiotherapeutic approaches may be of benefit, but the available data are inconclusive. Innovative physiotherapeutic approaches, such as robot training and forced-use therapy, are promising but require further study. Certain classes of drugs affecting central neurotransmitters (eg, alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor agonists, alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonists, haloperidol, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and benzodiazepines) may interfere with recovery and should be avoided if possible until definitive data become available. Pharmacotherapy to improve poststroke recovery remains experimental.", 
    "5": "Therapy for most people with dystonia is symptomatic, directed at lessening the intensity of the dystonic contractions. For a small minority of patients (eg, those with dopa-responsive dystonia, Wilson's disease, or psychogenic dystonia), specific therapy directed at one of the many causes of dystonia is available. Before initiating treatment, clinicians need to decide if a patient has a form of dystonia amenable to such therapy. The most sensitive and least costly method to diagnose DRD is a therapeutic trial of levodopa. It is, therefore, recommended to treat all those with dystonia beginning in childhood or adolescence with low-dose levodopa. For patients with generalized or segmental signs who do not respond to levodopa, other oral medications, including anticholinergics, baclofen, and benzodiazepines, may provide mild to moderate relief; these medications are often given in combinations. For those with focal dystonia, most having adult-onset disease, botulinum toxin A injections often effectively control contractions. The injections produce transient weakness and need to be repeated, generally every 3 to 5 months. There is growing renewed interest in surgical treatment. Peripheral denervating procedures may be helpful for patients with torticollis who do not obtain adequate benefit with botulinum toxin A. The central procedures of pallidotomy and pallidal stimulation are under study; their place in the treatment of the many dystonia subtypes (eg, limb vs axial, generalized vs focal, primary vs secondary) still needs to be established. There are very few studies evaluating physical and psychological therapies or the impact of diet or lifestyle in dystonia. Most clinicians consider physical therapy, including massage, a potential adjunct to medical therapy, and psychological support and stress reduction may help individuals cope with this chronic and frequently disabling condition.", 
    "6": "Although there are many published studies on the treatment of tardive dyskinesia (TD), relatively few treatments have proven to be consistently useful in clinical practice. Reviewed critically, most treatments have produced only slight to moderate benefit in less than half the patients treated. Emphasis instead is on prevention, prompt detection, and management of early and potentially reversible cases. If a patient develops dyskinesia while taking an antipsychotic drug (APD), ideal management is immediate discontinuation of the APD, if this is psychiatrically feasible. The manifestations of TD should be documented and the patient examined to exclude other possible causes of dyskinesia. APDs should then be withheld in the hope that the dyskinesia will disappear. Although the dyskinesia may fade within several weeks, it has the potential to recur if APD treatment is reintroduced. Psychiatric reevaluation to consider alternative psychiatric diagnoses or treatments is strongly advised. If there is no alternative to reintroducing an APD for psychiatric treatment, then an atypical neuroleptic should be considered. Because dyskinesia is very often not disturbing enough to require treatment, the need for treatment of TD should be carefully assessed. For mild dyskinesia, low doses of a benzodiazepine (eg, clonazepam) may reduce the amount of both dyskinesia and associated anxiety. Anticholinergic drugs are unhelpful and may aggravate TD but, similar to their effect in idiopathic dystonia, may be effective in tardive dystonia. Botulinum toxin injections are of considerable value in managing localized forms of tardive dystonia, such as retrocollis or blepharospasm. Tetrabenazine and reserpine are presynaptic dopamine depletors that may have considerable efficacy in TD, especially tardive dystonia; however, their use is often limited by side effects. Based on the rationale that TD may be due to formation of free radicals, vitamin E has been used for treatment of TD, with mixed results. In some patients with persistent and disabling TD that fails to remit even after the patient is no longer taking an APD, it may be necessary to resume treatment eventually with a typical APD. This approach should be considered only as a last resort to suppress TD, however, because it carries the risk of preventing remission and possibly aggravating TD. In this case, further attempts to taper and discontinue the APD are recommended. At present, there is no evidence that established TD continues to progress in severity with continued APD exposure. This nonprogressive character of TD may provide to be a consolation to the patient and family and is also of potential medical-legal importance.", 
    "7": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may produce a variety of neuropsychiatric problems, including impaired cognition, depression, mania, affective lability, irritability, anxiety, and psychosis. Despite the common occurrence of these symptoms following TBI, there are relatively few studies that provide clear guidance regarding management. Many symptoms (eg, irritability, affective lability, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and impaired cognition) are primarily consequences of brain injury rather than symptoms of a comorbid psychiatric disorder such as major depression. Although it is difficult to study the complicated treatments needed for such symptom complexes, we are able to recommend an approach to the evaluation and treatment of neuropsychiatric problems following traumatic brain injury. A thorough assessment of the patient is a prerequisite to the prescription of any treatment. This assessment should include a thorough developmental, psychiatric, and medication history; a detailed mental status examination; a complete neurologic examination; and quantification of neuropsychiatric symptoms using standardized and accepted inventories (eg, Neurobehavioral Rating Scale, Neuropsychiatric Inventory ). All symptoms must be evaluated in the context of the patient's premorbid history and current treatment because neuropsychiatric symptoms may be influenced by either factor or by both factors. Psychotherapy is an important component of the treatment of neuropsychiatric problems following TBI. Additionally, patients should be encouraged to become involved with local TBI support groups. When medications are prescribed, it is essential to use cautious dosing (low and slow) and empiric trials with continuous reassessment of symptoms using standardized scales and monitoring for drug-drug interactions. In general, medications with significant sedative, antidopaminergic, and anticholinergic properties should be avoided, and benzodiazepines should be used sparingly, if at all. Although patients with TBI may be particularly susceptible to adverse effects of psychopharmacologic medications, at times dosages similar to those used for the non-brain-injured psychiatric patient may be needed. When a single medication does not provide adequate relief of symptoms or cannot be tolerated at therapeutic doses, an alternative strategy is to augment the effect of one medication by using a second low-dose agent with a different mechanism of action.", 
    "8": "Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) is a medical emergency that must be treated rapidly and aggressively to prevent neuronal damage. Treatment should be initiated with intravenous lorazepam, 0.1 mg/kg, given at a rate of no more than 2 mg/min. If convulsions persist for more than 10 minutes or recur more than 20 minutes after lorazepam therapy is started, then fosphenytoin (20 mg of phenytoin equivalents per kilogram) should be infused at a rate of no more than 150 mg/min. If convulsions still continue, intravenous general anesthesia with pentobarbital, benzodiazepine drip, or propofol should be initiated after respiratory support has been established. All patients with GCSE who do not recover consciousness should be monitored with electroencephalography (EEG), and any residual epileptiform activity on EEG, including periodic epileptiform discharges (PEDs), should be considered evidence of continuing GCSE and treated aggressively.", 
    "9": "With suitable pharmacotherapy, patients with any degree of restless legs syndrome (RLS) should be able to obtain substantial relief of symptoms. The best therapeutic success is attained when the physician tailors therapy to the patient's specific symptoms and can flexibly try a variety of agents, if needed. Therapy should be reserved for those in whom RLS cannot be managed with just sleep hygiene and related practices. It should not be withheld, however, if a patient reasonably believes that his or her quality of life is being impaired by RLS. The optimal initial approach to RLS in the general patient is usually the use of a dopaminergic agent: low-dose levodopa in milder cases, a dopamine agonist in more severe ones. Patients whose problems are primarily sleep related can initially be treated with a benzodiazepine. Patients who have symptoms primarily while awake can initially be treated with a dopaminergic agent or an opioid. Patients whose RLS discomfort is truly painful can initially be treated with gabapentin. Combination therapy with two or three agents from different classes can be useful as well. Determination of iron status is the most important initial laboratory evaluation in patients with RLS. Iron supplementation should be used as indicated. In the future, delivery modes other than oral administration of medications may be of significant benefit, especially in more severe cases.", 
    "10": "I believe there are four essential elements in the management of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): to establish a good physician-patient relationship; to educate patients about their condition; to emphasize the excellent prognosis and benign nature of the illness; and to employ therapeutic interventions centering on dietary modifications, pharmacotherapy, and behavioral strategies tailored to the individual. Initially, I establish the diagnosis, exclude organic causes, educate patients about the disease, establish realistic expectations and consistent limits, and involve patients in disease management. I find it critical to determine why the patient is seeking assistance (eg, cancer phobia, disability, interpersonal distress, or exacerbation of symptoms). Most patients can be treated by their primary care physician. However, specialty consultations may be needed to reinforce management strategies, perform additional diagnostic tests, or institute specialized treatment. Psychological co-morbidities do not cause symptoms but do affect how patients respond to them and influence health care-seeking behavior. I find that these issues are best explored over a series of visits when the physician-patient relationship has been established. It can be helpful to have patients fill out a self-administered test to identify psychological co-morbidities. I often use these tests as a basis for extended inquiries into this area, resulting in the initiation of appropriate therapies. I encourage patients to keep a 2-week diary of food intake and gastrointestinal symptoms. In this way, patients become actively involved in management of their disease, and I may be able to obtain information from the diary that will be valuable in making treatment decisions. I do not believe that diagnostic studies for food intolerances are cost-effective or particularly helpful; however, exclusion diets may be beneficial. I introduce fiber supplements gradually and monitor them for tolerance and palatability. Synthetic fiber is often better-tolerated than natural fiber, but must be individualized. In my experience, excessive fiber supplementation often is counterproductive, as abdominal cramps and bloating may worsen. Antidiarrheal agents are very effective when used correctly, preferably in divided doses. I use them in patients in anticipation of diarrhea and especially in those who fear symptoms when engaged in activities outside the home. I encourage patients to make decisions as to when and how much to use. However, almost always, a morning dose before breakfast is used (loperamide, 2 to 6 mg) and, perhaps again later in the day when symptoms of diarrhea are prominent. I prefer antispasmodics to be used intermittently in response to periods of increased abdominal pain, cramps, and urgency. For patients with daily symptoms, especially after meals, agents such as dicyclomine before meals are useful. For patients with infrequent but severe episodes of unpredictable pain, sublingual hyoscyamine often produces rapid relief and instills confidence. In general, I recommend that oral antispasmodics be used for a limited period of time rather than indefinitely, and generally for periods of time when symptoms are prominent. For chronic visceral pain syndromes, I recommend small doses of tricyclic antidepressants. These agents are especially effective in diarrhea-predominant patients with disturbed sleep patterns but may be unacceptable to patients with constipation. I educate patients that side effects occur early and benefits may not be apparent for 3 to 4 weeks. I consider using SSRIs in low doses in patients with constipation-predominant IBS; cisapride, 10 to 20 mg three times per day, also may be beneficial. When taken with drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450, cisapride has been associated with serious cardiac arrhythmias caused by QT prolongation, including ventricular arrhythmias and torsades de pointes. These drugs include the azole fungicides; erythromycin, clarithromycin, and troleandomycin; some antidepressants; HIV protease inhibitors; and others. In patients with IBS with mild to moderate co-morbid depression, I have found that the use of SSRIs such as paroxetine, fluoxetine, or sertraline may be beneficial. It is important to tell patients that anxiety and disturbed sleep may occur during the first 10 days and benefits may not occur for 3 to 4 weeks. I prescribe a small amount of a short-acting benzodiazepine such as alprazolam, 0.5 mg two times per day, to control these symptoms. For generalized anxiety without depression, buspirone or clonazepam may be useful. I have found that patients who also have associated panic disorder may benefit from a benzodiazepine, tricyclic antidepressant, or an SSRI. However, these patients are best managed in conjunction with a psychiatrist or psychologist. I consider the use of alternative therapies in patients who fail to respond to conventional measures and who are receptive to alternative strategies. These include general relaxation techniques such as biofeedback and hypnosis therapies.", 
    "11": "Imidazobenzodiazepines such as RY-80 have been reported to exhibit both high affinity and selectivity for GABA(A) receptors containing an alpha(5) subunit. A single amino acid residue (alpha(5)Ile215) has been identified that plays a critical role in the high-affinity, subtype-selective effects of RY-80 and structurally related ligands. Thus, substitution of alpha(5)Ile215 with the cognate amino acid contained in the alpha(1) subunit (Val211) reduced the selectivity of RY-80 for alpha(5)beta(3)gamma(2) receptors from approximately 135- to approximately 8-fold compared with alpha(1)beta(3)gamma(2) receptors. This mutation produced a comparable reduction in the selectivity of RY-24 (a structural analog of RY-80) for alpha(5)beta(3)gamma(2) receptors but did not markedly alter the affinities of ligands (e.g., flunitrazepam) that are not subtype-selective. Conversely, substitution of the alpha(1) subunit with the cognate amino acid contained in the alpha(5) subunit (i.e., alpha(1)V211I) increased the affinities of alpha(5)-selective ligands by a approximately 20-fold and reduced by 3-fold the affinity of an alpha(1)-selective agonist (zolpidem). Increasing the lipophilicity (e.g., by substitution of Phe) of alpha(5)215 did not significantly affect the affinities (and selectivities) of RY-80 and RY-24 for alpha(5)-containing GABA(A) receptors. However, the effect of introducing hydrophilic and or charged residues (e.g., Lys, Asp, Thr) at this position was no greater than that produced by the alpha(5)I215V mutation. These data indicate that residue alpha(5)215 may not participate in formation of the lipophilic L(2) pocket that has been proposed to contribute to the unique pharmacological properties of alpha(5)-containing GABA(A) receptors. RY-80 and RY-24 acted as inverse agonists in both wild-type alpha(5)beta(3)gamma(2) and mutant alpha(5)I215Kbeta(3)gamma(2) receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. However, both RY-24 and RY-80 acted as antagonists at mutant alpha(5)I215Vbeta(3)gamma(2) and alpha(5)I215Tbeta(3)gamma(2) receptors, whereas the efficacy of flunitrazepam was similar at all three receptor isoforms. The data demonstrate that amino acid residue alpha(5)215 is a determinant of both ligand affinity and efficacy at GABA(A) receptors containing an alpha(5) subunit.", 
    "12": "Allosteric modulation is a mechanism for modifying pharmacological receptor activity that has largely been ignored in terms of therapeutic drug design, although benzodiazepine receptor ligands are an example of the serendipitous discovery of this class of compound. The current mathematical models of allosteric interactions at (particularly G-protein-coupled) receptors concentrate on the effects of the allosteric ligand on orthosteric ligand binding and ignore potential effects of these compounds on the ability of orthosteric ligands to cause receptor activation. In this report a mathematical model of allosteric interactions at pharmacological receptors has been investigated that explicitly includes effects of the allosteric ligand on receptor activation. This model uses the two-state model of receptor activation as its basis and is qualitatively consistent with currently reported behavior of allosteric modulators. The predictions of this model suggest a series of criteria that should be tested before the effects of an allosteric modulator can be quantified in a nonsystem-dependent manner. It has also been used to provide a potential mechanistic explanation for the functional effects of the A(1) adenosine receptor allosteric enhancer PD 81,723 and a recently reported allosteric modulator of type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors.", 
    "13": "The alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor is an ionotropic glutamate receptor that mediates fast excitatory synaptic transmission throughout the central nervous system. In addition to the glutamate binding site, allosteric modulatory sites on the receptor are inferred from the ability of synthetic compounds to affect channel function without interaction with the glutamate binding site. We have identified a novel class of potent, noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonists typified by CP-465, 022 and CP-526,427. The latter compound was radiolabeled and used to elucidate the pharmacology of one allosteric modulatory site. [(3)H]CP-526,427 labels a single binding site in rat forebrain membranes with a K(d) value of 3.3 nM and a B(max) of 7.0 pmol/mg of protein. The [(3)H]CP-526,427 binding site does not seem to interact directly with the glutamate binding site but overlaps with that for another class of AMPA receptor antagonists, the 2,3-benzodiazepines. This binding site is distinct from that for the antagonist Evans blue and for several classes of compounds that modulate AMPA receptor desensitization. These results indicate the existence of at least two physically distinct allosteric sites on the AMPA receptor through which channel activity or desensitization is modulated.", 
    "14": "Increasing evidence implicates apoptosis as a major mechanism of cell death in methamphetamine (METH) neurotoxicity. The involvement of a neuroimmune component in apoptotic cell death after injury or chemical damage suggests that cytokines may play a role in METH effects. In the present study, we examined if the absence of IL-6 in knockout (IL-6-/-) mice could provide protection against METH-induced neurotoxicity. Administration of METH resulted in a significant reduction of [(125)I]RTI-121-labeled dopamine transporters in the caudate-putamen (CPu) and cortex as well as depletion of dopamine in the CPu and frontal cortex of wild-type mice. However, these METH-induced effects were significantly attenuated in IL-6-/- animals. METH also caused a decrease in serotonin levels in the CPu and hippocampus of wild-type mice, but no reduction was observed in IL-6-/- animals. Moreover, METH induced decreases in [(125)I]RTI-55-labeled serotonin transporters in the hippocampal CA3 region and in the substantia nigra-reticulata but increases in serotonin transporters in the CPu and cingulate cortex in wild-type animals, all of which were attenuated in IL-6-/- mice. Additionally, METH caused increased gliosis in the CPu and cortices of wild-type mice as measured by [(3)H]PK-11195 binding; this gliotic response was almost completely inhibited in IL-6-/- animals. There was also significant protection against METH-induced DNA fragmentation, measured by the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end-labeled (TUNEL) cells in the cortices. The protective effects against METH toxicity observed in the IL-6-/- mice were not caused by differences in temperature elevation or in METH accumulation in wild-type and mutant animals. Therefore, these observations support the proposition that IL-6 may play an important role in the neurotoxicity of METH.", 
    "15": "In an attempt to establish the enantiomeric specificity of metabolism for a series of racemic cholecystokinin-B receptor antagonists, chiral LC-MS-MS conditions were established using a Pirkle DNBL chiral stationary phase operating in the reversed-phase mode. Rat liver microsomal incubations of the compounds were analysed using these conditions and it was demonstrated that resolution of oxygenated and demethylated metabolites could be achieved. A single model compound was investigated in detail by obtaining product-ion spectra on all mono-oxygenated species in an attempt to correlate these and identify enantiomeric pairs of metabolites. In this example a lack of differentiation in the product ion spectra did not allow correlation but the results suggest that such an approach may still be viable for the chiral metabolic analysis of racemic material.", 
    "16": "In a clinical trial, we examined short- and medium-term reduction of dental fear in patients with dental phobia. Ninety-one patients selected one of two treatments or no intervention before oral surgery (control group). One group comprised a one-session psychological treatment and included 25 patients. The second group chose oral selected midazolam and included 30 patients. Thirty-six patients chose the control group. In total, 50 patients completed the study (10 controls, 20 in the midazolam group, an d 20 in the treated group). The degree of fear was assessed by the Corah Dental Anxiety Scale. Before the operation, both interventions caused the degree of fear to fall significantly compared with the control group. Two months later, the midazolam group showed a return to baseline fear, whereas the psychologically treated group showed further improvement. Medium-term results after one year showed that compliance and reduction of fear remained only in the psychologically treated group.", 
    "17": "We studied 60 patients to find out whether anxiety affects the dose of midazolam necessary for sedation, and whether operating time, dose of midazolam, or technique have any influence on levels of amnesia and anxiety. A pilot study preceded the main study in which 20 patients were given local anaesthesia only and 20 local anaesthesia and intravenous sedation. Patients in the main study group (n = 60) received both local anaesthesia and intravenous sedation. The dose required for sedation was not linked to amnesia, pulse rate, blood pressure, or preoperative anxiety. Sedation did significantly reduce postoperative anxiety scores, (P< 0.001) and amnesia was affected by operating time; complete surgical amnesia seemed to last about 25 minutes.", 
    "18": "The study assessed the dosage, clinical sedative effect, and safety of intranasal midazolam in 32 children. Data were complete for 29 patients (21 with lacerations and 8 cases of dental trauma). Sedation was adequate to ensure successful completion of treatment under local with or without topical anaesthetic in 22 of the 29 cases (76%). They became sedated at a mean (SD) of 14 (5) minutes, with completion of treatment at 20 (13) minutes. Sedation was achieved with a mean (SD) of 5 (2)mg of midazolam. There were no signs of respiratory depression or of oxygen desaturation below 94% on pulse oximetry. No supplemental oxygen was required and there were no other complications. We conclude that intranasal midazolam is a safe and effective alternative to general anaesthesia in the definitive treatment of children with oral and maxillofacial injuries.", 
    "19": "The applications of LC-API-MS in routine forensic toxicological casework were presented. This technique has been used for routine determination of several groups of drugs: opiate agonists (like morphine, codeine, dihydrocodeine and their glucuronides, methadone, buprenorphine) cocaine and its metabolites (benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester), amphetamine and other psychoactive phenethylamines, like MDMA, MDE or MDA, benzodiazepine derivatives (flunitrazepam and metabolites, triazolam, bromazepam), hallucinogens (LSD, psilocybin, psilocin) and olanzapine, A common solid-phase extraction procedure for all drugs (with exception of LSD) has been developed. Among two ionization sources, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization appeared more universal and assured generally higher sensitivity. Only in the case of very polar drugs (e.g. psilocin or psilocybin) electrospray ionization was more sensitive. LC-API-MS became a very powerful and flexible method for dedicated analyses of substances of forensic interest. The use of this technique for general, broad applicable screening depends on the establishing of interlaboratory database of standardized mass spectra.", 
    "20": "Benzodiazepine receptor (BDZR) ligands are structurally diverse compounds that bind to specific binding sites on GABAA receptors and allosterically modulate the effect of GABA on chloride flux. The binding of BDZR ligands to this receptor system results in activity at multiple behavioral end points including anxiolytic, sedative, hyperphagic, anticonvulsant and hyperthermic effects. In the work presented here, 17 structurally diverse BDZR ligands of the receptors initiating the anxiolytic response have been studied using a systematic computational procedure developed in our laboratory. Using this procedure, a five component 3D recognition pharmacophore was obtained consisting of two proton acceptors, a hydrophobic group, an aromatic electron accepting ring and a ring containing polar moieties, all found in a common geometric arrangement in the 15 compounds with an effect at the anxiolytic end point and absent in two control compounds. The 3D pharmacophore developed was validated by searching 3D databases and finding known BDZR ligands active at the anxiolytic end point, including 1,4-BDZ derivatives, imidazo BDZ and beta-carboline ligands.", 
    "21": "Conflicting data have been reported concerning the modification of cytochrome P450 expression in the regenerating liver.

    "22": "In this PBL model and in sham models, we studied the expression and the metabolic activities of two major cytochromes, CYP3A and CYP2E1, and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase protein (iNOS). They were simultaneously measured in the atrophying and regenerating liver lobes following PBL using Western Blot and HPLC methods.", 
    "23": "The metabolic activities of both cytochromes were transiently and simultaneously down-regulated in the regenerating and atrophying lobes during the first 2-5 h after PBL. No significant modification was observed at the protein level. In contrast, iNOS protein was significantly induced in both lobes. Similar results were observed after sham operation.", 
    "24": "The reduction of these CYP activities in both lobes after PBL and in sham livers suggests that other mechanisms than the regenerating process itself or the reduction of the liver mass might account for such down-regulation during the early phase of liver regeneration. The activation of nitric oxide (NO) and/or pro-inflammatory cytokine production provides clues to pathways liable to affect the CYP activities in the regenerating liver.",

    "30": "Studies were conducted to characterize assays for the isolation and quantitation of rat cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A isoforms from hepatic and intestinal tissues. Isolated intestinal microsomes were analyzed for their alkaline phosphatase activity and CYP 3A immunoreactivity. The involvement of CYP 3A in the in vitro hydroxylation of midazolam (MDZ) was also evaluated using isoform specific chemical and antibody inhibitors. The effect of glycerol (a common constituent of the microsomal reconstitution buffer) concentration on in vitro MDZ hydroxylation was also investigated. Additionally, to verify that the intestinal preparation was adequate for use in studies investigating the induction of CYP3A at the MRNA, protein, and catalytic activity within a single animal, a separate induction study was carried out with the CYP 3A inducer dexamethasone (DEX). A reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and a quantitative Western blotting method were used to reliably detect differences in CYP 3A mRNA and immunoreactivity between DEX- and vehicle (VH)-treated tissues. The in vitro hydroxylation of MDZ evaluated CYP 3A catalytic activity and identified increases in CYP 3A activity caused by DEX in comparison to VH.

Short exposure to KA resulted in the death of motor neurons, while dorsal horn neurons were unaffected. This selective motor neuron death was completely dependent on extracellular Ca(2+) and insensitive to inhibitors of voltage-operated Ca(2+) or Na(+) channels. It was also completely inhibited by the specific AMPA antagonist LY300164 and by Joro spider toxin (JSTx), a selective blocker of AMPA receptors that lack the edited GluR2 subunit. KA selectively killed those motor neurons that stained positive for the Co(2+) histochemical staining, a measure for the presence of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors. These results suggest that Ca(2+) entry via Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors is responsible for the selective motor neuron death. As the Ca(2+) permeability of the AMPA receptor is regulated by its GluR2 subunit, we stained motor neurons for GluR2. Immunoreactivity was present in all motor neurons, albeit to a variable degree. However, double-staining experiments demonstrated that motor neurons clearly expressing GluR2, also expressed Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors. This indicates that despite the abundant expression of GluR2, this subunit is excluded from a subset of AMPA receptors and that the activation of these receptors is responsible for the selective motor neuron death.", 
    "32": "Zolpidem is a widely used hypnotic agent acting at the GABA(A) receptor benzodiazepine site. On recombinant receptors, zolpidem displays a high affinity to alpha 1-GABA(A) receptors, an intermediate affinity to alpha(2)- and alpha(3)-GABA(A) receptors and fails to bind to alpha(5)-GABA(A) receptors. However, it is not known which receptor subtype is essential for mediating the sedative-hypnotic action in vivo. Studying alpha1(H101R) mice, which possess zolpidem-insensitive alpha(1)-GABA(A) receptors, we show that the sedative action of zolpidem is exclusively mediated by alpha(1)-GABA(A) receptors. Similarly, the activity of zolpidem against pentylenetetrazole-induced tonic convulsions is also completely mediated by alpha(1)-GABA(A) receptors. These results establish that the sedative-hypnotic and anticonvulsant activities of zolpidem are due to its action on alpha(1)-GABA(A) receptors and not on alpha(2)- or alpha(3)-GABA(A) receptors.",

    "37": "The aim of this study is to find out the effects of different doses of midazolam, when used epidurally, on somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) by delaying neuronal conduction. Thirty two New Zeland albino male rabbits were divided into four groups. All rabbits were anesthetised with ketamine and xylasine combination and atracurium was used as muscle relaxant. 10 mg/kg/hr ketamine infusion was used for maintenance of anesthesia. After insertion of the epidural catheter surgically; Group 1 received 1.5 ml isotonic saline (Control), Group 2 received 150 microg/kg, Group 3 received 250 microg/kg, and Group 4 received 500 microg/kg midazolam epidurally. With the stimulation of sciatic nerve. SEP records were recorded from the epidural space. Records were received before the injection of the drug, and 20, 40, 60 minutes after injection of the drug. \"Latency\" results were increased according to control in all groups (including isotonic saline-control-group). Increase in latency in the control group was interpreted as due to the effect of temperature mismatch of the saline and the rabbits. While in the first and second group amplitudes showed no differences, group 3 and 4 showed decreases of up to 50%. Epidurally administered midazolam up to 150 microg/kg caused no change in SEP records, but 250 and 500 microg/kg doses caused decreases in SEP records which can lead to misinterpretation as neurological damage.",

Despite the risk of adverse reactions, analgesics can be used safely for chronic pain in older patients when physicians prescribe with care. Nonopoid analgesics include acetaminophen, aspirin, NSAIDs, and COX-2 inhibitors. Opoid analgesics may be useful, but they should be continued only if side effects can be controlled and the patient demonstrates improved function. Adjuvant medications include antidepressants, anticonvulsants, neuroleptics, and oral membrane stabilizers. Benzodiazepines may be harmful in older patients, and muscle relaxants tend to be overused. Topical agents may be useful for certain neuropathic pain conditions.", 
    "41": "Sixty chemical immobilizations of red deer (Cervus elaphus hippelaphus) have been carried out during an etho-ecological study from August 1994 to December 1996 in a 35 ha pen in the district of Nitra (Slovac Republic). Our objective was to determine the efficacy and standard dosages of Zoletil and Rompun for the immobilization of adult red deer in feral conditions as an alternative to the use of the highly toxic opioids. We therefore compared an Immobilon-Rompun combination (ImRo) with a 1:1 mixture of Zoletil and Rompun (ZoRo) as an injectable solution. Use of both combinations led to the immobilization of >92% of deer with an injection volume <3 ml. Mean (SD) dose to achieve immobilization was 35 (14) microg/kg ethorphine + 0.14 (0.056) mg/kg acepromazine + 0.36 (0.14) mg/kg xylazine compared to 1.2 (0.8) mg/kg tiletamine + 1.2 (0.8) mg/kg zolazepam + 2.3 (1.6) mg/kg xylazine. This corresponds to a volume of 1.8 (0.7) ml/100 kg body mass (BM) for ImRo (range = 1.0 to 4.6) and to 2.3 (1.6) ml/100 kg BM for ZoRo (range = 0.7 to 4.0), respectively. Heart rate, respiratory rate and oxyhaemoglobin saturation values did not differ significantly between the two groups during immobilization. Three deer (5%) died during immobilization, but fatalities could not be directly associated with the drug effect. Mean (SD) time from darting to complete immobilization was 5.5 (4.2) min for ImRo and 7.5 (6.1) min for ZoRo, respectively. Differences were not statistically significant. Anesthesia with both combinations of immobilizing agents could be reversed within 2 min using sarmazenile-yohimbine for ZoRo and diprenorphine-yohimbine for ImXy immobilizations, respectively. We conclude that the 1:1 combination of Zoletil and xylazine is a valuable alternative to the use of opioids for the immobilization of adult red deer including feral adult animals.", 
    "42": "A pharmacokinetic and tissue residue study was conducted to assess the risks associated with human consumption of polar bears in arctic Canada that have been exposed to the immobilizing drug Telazol, a mixture of tiletamine hydrochloride and zolazepam hydrochloride. Twenty-two bears were remotely injected with about 10 mg/kg of Telazol. Following immobilization, serum samples were collected serially at regular intervals until the bears awakened. Sixteen of the bears were relocated and killed under permit by local hunters at various times from 0.5 to 11 days after dosing. Serum, kidney, muscle and adipose tissue samples were collected immediately after death. All samples were stored at -70 C until analysis by HPLC. The concentration-time data of tiletamine and zolazepam in serum during the immobilization period were fitted to curves by computer and the pharmacokinetic parameters assessed. In addition, the serum and tissue samples collected at the time of death were analyzed for both parent drugs, for one metabolite of tiletamine (CI-398), and for three metabolites of zolazepam (metabolites 1, 2 and 4). A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination best fit the time-series data for the drugs in serum during the immobilization period. This model gave half-lives (mean +/- SE) for tiletamine and zolazepam of 1.8+/-0.2 h and 1.2+/-0.08 h, respectively, clearance values of 2.1+/-0.3 l x h(-1) x kg(-1) and 1.1+/-0.1 l x h(-1) x kg(-1), and volumes of distribution of 5.2+/-0.6 l/kg and 1.8+/-0.2 l/kg. The concentrations of both drugs and their metabolites declined rapidly to trace levels by 24 h post-dosing, although extremely low concentrations of some metabolites were encountered sporadically over the entire sampling period. In particular, zolazepam metabolite 2, remained detectable in fat and muscle tissue at the end of the study, 11 days after dosing. It was concluded that during immobilization, both tiletamine and zolazepam levels decline rapidly in a monoexponential fashion, and their pharmacokinetic parameters in polar bears are similar to those observed in other species. Tissue levels of the drugs and their metabolites declined sufficiently rapidly that individuals eating meat from exposed bears would be unlikely to experience pharmacological effects from the drugs. Nevertheless, slight exposure to the drugs and/or their metabolites might be possible for an indeterminate time after dosing.",

    "44": "Myoclonus is defined as shock-like, brief involuntary abnormal movements in muscle jerking caused by external stimuli; and it arises from progressive myoclonus epilepsy, post-anoxic encephalopathy and Alzheimer's disease, causing disabling symptoms. It is a rare syndrome but very difficult to control. Piracetam (2-oxo-1-pyrrolidineacetamide, Myocalm) was developed more than 30 years ago as a cyclic derivative of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA); it has been used in European countries for the treatment of memory loss and other cognitive defects in patients. Some reports have suggested that piracetam has anti-myoclonus activities, but the mechanisms of myoclonus are not well-identified, and thus there have been few preclinical studies on piracetam for the treatment of myoclonus. We investigated the effect of piracetam and clonazepam, an anti-epileptic drug, on high dosage urea-induced myoclonus using an electromyogram in rats. The incidence of myoclonus induced by urea 4.5 g/kg (i.p.) was significantly reduced by piracetam at 300 mg/kg (i.p.) and by clonazepam at 0.3 mg/kg (p.o.). The coadministration of piracetam 100 mg/kg (i.p.) and clonazepam at 0.03-0.1 mg/kg (p.o.) significantly reduced the incidence of myoclonus, although separate administration was not effective. After oral administration of piracetam, it is rapidly and completely absorbed and excreted almost unchanged in the urine; however, it does show a little binding to human serum protein. Repeated oral administration of piracetam for 7 days in phase-I trials did not show any accumulation of the drug. In the placebo-controlled double-blind crossover trial of piracetam conducted in the UK, there was a significant improvement in cortical myoclonus. In phase-II trials, piracetam inhibited myoclonus and showed an improvement in the quality of life (QOL) of the patients. These results show that piracetam has a beneficial use in clinics for severe myoclonus patients when it is combined with anti-epileptic drugs, demonstrating an improvement in the myoclonus and QOL of patients.", 
    "45": "To help determine which drugs can be used with relative safety during pregnancy, we reviewed the literature on the possible teratogenic, perinatal, behavioral or developmental effects of the various groups of commonly used psychiatric drugs, and their effects on lactation. Tricyclic antidepressants, fluoxetine, phenothiazines, and most benzodiazepines are not considered to be teratogenic and may be used during pregnancy. All anti-epileptic drugs seem to have an embryotoxic and teratogenic potential and we recommend, if possible, avoiding these drugs. Lithium administration during the first trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of cardiac malformations, but the risk is not as high as originally reported. Therefore lithium may be continued whenever it seems to be the \"drug of choice\" if fetal echocardiography and ultrasonography are performed. There is a lack of information on the teratogenic effect of the newer drugs, and in spite of the fact that similar \"older\" drugs do not seem to adversely affect the fetus, they should be used with care. Although the data on the development of children following in-utero exposure to psychiatric drugs is limited, there seems to be no evidence of any long-term adverse effects on the development of children exposed to most psychotropic medications. However, children exposed in utero to anti-epileptic drugs may exhibit long-term developmental problems. Most of the drugs are detected in breast milk only at low concentrations. In nursing women taking these drugs, breastfeeding is possible. The infant should be carefully monitored for any clinical side effects and whenever observed, nursing should be discontinued. In light of our knowledge today, there seems to be only rarely an indication for pregnancy interruption following maternal exposure to psychiatric drugs during pregnancy.", 
    "46": "Sedation allows patients to tolerate unpleasant procedures while maintaining adequate cardiorespiratory function and the ability to respond purposefully to verbal command. For ophthalmic surgery patient's anxiety and discomfort can be relieved during placement of a peribulbar block and during surgery by intravenous sedation. Intravenous sedation should only be administered by an anesthetist. Three different classes of drugs are used for intravenous sedation: analgesics (fentanyl and alfentanil), benzodiazepines (midazolam) and profofol, an intravenous anesthetic. Sedation may result in ventilatory, cardiovascular and neurologic complications. Excessive sedation can induce hypoventilation from central ventilatory depression or airway obstruction. Uncontrolled and unexpected movements of the head could result in major surgical complications. For the prevention of the complications related to sedation the same monitoring as for general anesthesia is essential.", 
    "47": "There are few data on predictive factors for alcohol relapse or long-term functional outcome after liver transplantation for alcoholic liver disease (ALD). In all 56 surviving UK patients (47 men, 9 women; mean age: 51 years; range: 33 to 69 years) who underwent transplantation for ALD at King's College Hospital over a 10-year period, alcohol relapse and outcome were assessed by outpatient and case-note review and by postal questionnaire containing (1) the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), (2) the Short-Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey, and (3) a drug and alcohol questionnaire. At a median of 2.5 years (range: 0.5 to 10 years), 13 of the 47 respondents (28%) and 2 of the 9 nonrespondents (22%) had evidence of potentially harmful drinking (>3 units daily) at some time posttransplantation. An additional 13 patients admitted to drinking some alcohol at least once, corresponding to an overall relapse rate of 50%. The patients with harmful drinking (1) had started drinking regularly at a younger age (18 v 25 years; P =.01), (2) began drinking heavily at a younger age (30 v 40 years; P =.01), (3) had shorter pretransplantation abstinence periods (10 v 23 months; P =.02), and (4) had a longer time since transplantation (median, 5.7 v 1.5 years; P =.0004) than those with no or mild alcohol relapse. They were also more likely to report sleep disturbance (NHP sleep problem score, 45 v 16; P =.01) and use benzodiazepines regularly (7 of 13 v 3 of 34 patients; P =.002). Despite these differences, health dimension scores in the SF-36 and NHP posttransplantation were similar between the groups and to those of UK community controls. In the long term, at least 50% of the patients will drink again at some time posttransplantation, although at lower levels of alcohol intake than previously. Those patients with multiple predictive factors for alcohol relapse may be at greatest risk for harmful drinking and be the group that would benefit most from professional counseling. Overall, the quality of life after liver transplantation for ALD is high and broadly similar to the levels expected in the normal population.", 
    "48": "We report the case of a 9-year-old boy with delayed postanoxic encephalopathy. The patient improved after a period of coma and adult respiratory distress syndrome caused by benzodiazepine intoxication. Initial improvement appeared to be complete, but 9 days after discharge from the pediatric intensive care unit, extrapyramidal rigidity of the left arm became manifest. This event was followed by progressive neurologic impairment with involuntary, non-repetitive, but occasionally stereotyped movements, affecting distal, proximal and axial musculature in various combinations. On physical examination, passive movement of the left arm showed a plastic, lead-pipe rigidity with a ratchet-like cogwheel quality. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. Axial T 2 -weighted images of the brain showed characteristic signs of an ischemic area in the basal ganglia which were more evident in the right region, a finding consistent with anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Delayed postanoxic encephalopathy is a relatively uncommon and unexplained phenomenon which becomes manifest after an initial hypoxic-ischemic event that causes stupor or coma. The pathogenesis is unknown. Exceptionally, this syndrome can affect the basal ganglia more than the cerebral cortex and white matter. Initial improvement is followed after a variable period of time by relapse, progressing for weeks to months until the patient is left with permanent sequelae.", 
    "49": "In the present work we studied the anticonvulsive effects of the essential oils (EOs) from three chemotypes of Lippia alba (Mill.) N.E.Brown (Verbenaceae). Animals (female Swiss mice, 25 g) were treated with the EO and, 30 or 60 min after intraperitoneal (i.p.) or oral (p.o.) administration, respectively, injected with pentylenetetrazole (80 mg/kg, i.p.) and observed for 30 min. The results showed that EO I (200 and 400 mg/kg), EO II (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg), and EO III (400 mg/kg), i.p., produced an increased latency time for the first convulsion as related to controls. Death latency was greater in the groups receiving EO I (50 and 100 mg/kg), EO II (100 and 200 mg/kg), and EO III (200 mg/kg), i.p. Orally, while no effect was demonstrated with EOs at doses of 200 or 400 mg/kg, significant increases in the latency of convulsion and latency of death were observed with EO I at the highest dose (800 mg/kg). Similarly, EO III at this dose was also effective as far as latency of convulsion is concerned. Animals treated with citral (100 mg/kg, i.p.), beta-myrcene or limonene (200 mg/kg, i.p.), EOs chemical constituents, presented significant increases in the latency of convulsion and percentage of survival as compared to controls. After oral administration these effects were observed only with a higher dose (400 mg/kg). The association of EOs with diazepam significantly potentiated their effects, suggesting a similar mechanism of action and indicating that citral, beta-myrcene, and limonene are probably the EOs active compounds.", 
    "50": "Long-term alcohol abuse is known to target specific areas of the brain such as the superior frontal cortex (SFC), resulting in neuronal cell loss. Abnormal transmission of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA may contribute to this damage. Previous work in our laboratory has found differential expression and distribution of certain a subunit genes of the GABAA receptor in the SFC of human alcoholic brain, suggesting that differences in GABAA receptor subunit expression could give rise to the locally altered GABAA pharmacology which is associated with alcohol abuse. A competitive RT-PCR assay has been developed to study the expression of the GABAA receptor beta-subunit genes beta1, beta2, and beta3. A single set of primers homologous to all three beta isoform sequences has been shown to amplify each of the beta isoforms from mRNA isolated from human brain tissue obtained at autopsy. An internal standard has been designed which is identical to the target except for a 61-bp deletion and a unique restriction enzyme (RE) site. This is co-amplified with the target sequences to allow amplification efficiency to be assessed and thus enable the quantitation of gene expression. A range of GABAA receptor ligands were used to look at differential distribution of receptor subtypes in the cortical laminae by autoradiography. Differences in distribution of the ligands were demonstrated, consistent with a hypothesis of alcohol-induced variations in the expression of receptor subunits.", 
    "51": "Flunitrazepam (FNTZ) effects on molecular packing and surface curvature in artificial model membranes were investigated. FNTZ, from the subphase under dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (dpPC) monolayers at the air-water interface, expanded the surface pressure-area isotherm and induced an increment in the limiting area; in this conditions, the collapse pressure of dpPC decreased, indicating a lowering in the stability of the monolayer. Thermodynamic-geometric correlations based on molecular parameters predicted a decrement in the aggregation number and stability, and an increase in the curvature of the self-aggregated structure of dpPC in aqueous medium in the presence of FNTZ. Accordingly, negative-staining electron microscopy of dpPC aqueous dispersions showed that the mean diameter of dpPC vesicles decreased 2 and 2.87 times in the presence of 10 nM and 50 \u00b5M FNTZ, respectively, compared with control samples. The release of a soluble marker entrapped in dpPC liposomes increased slightly respect to the control in the presence of FNTZ. In dpPC-dpPE mixed liposomes 50 \u00b5M FNTZ induced a decrement in the amount of the aminophospholipid exposed to the outer monolayer. Concluding, an FNTZ-induced expansion of dpPC-water interface region affected the constraints imposed on the lipid-water system by the molecular geometry, interacting free energies and entropy that determine the shape of a multimolecular structure. In liposomes composed of a pure phospholipid, the bilayer expansion leaded, through a structure instability, to reduce the liposome size; in mixed liposomes, phospholipid molecules translocation could be observed as another compensating mechanism of the initial perturbation. These results may be relevant for understanding benzodiazepines' effects non-mediated by membrane receptors.",

These measurements are relative indices of benzodiazepine receptor concentration (B'max). To evaluate the ability of such indices in accurately accessing the B'max the authors compared them with absolute values of B'max, measured using positron emission tomography (PET). The authors performed SPECT, PET, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies on a group composed of seven subjects. For SPECT studies, the authors administered a single injection of [123I]iomazenil and estimated the total and specific distribution volumes (DV(T SPECT), DV(S SPECT)) and the binding potential (BP) using unconstrained (BP(SPECT)) and constrained (BP(C SPECT)) compartmental models. For PET studies, the authors used a multiinjection approach with [11C]flumazenil and unlabeled flumazenil to estimate absolute values of receptor concentration, B'max, and some other binding parameters. The authors studied the correlation of different binding parameters with B'max. To study the robustness of the binding parameter measurements at the pixel level, the authors applied a wavelet-based filter to improve signal-to-noise ratio of time-concentration curves, and the calculated kinetic parameters were used to build up parametric images. For PET data, the B'max and the DV(PET) were highly correlated (r = 0.988). This confirms that it is possible to use the DV(PET) to access benzodiazepine receptor density. For SPECT data, the correlation between DV(SPECT) estimated using a two- and three-compartment model was also high (r = 0.999). The DV(T SPECT) and BP(C SPECT) parameters estimated with a constrained three-compartment model or the DV(T''SPECT) parameter estimated with a two-compartment model were also highly correlated to the B'max parameter estimated with PET.

Subsequently we analyze the pharmacokinetic characteristics, efficacy and toxicity of phenobarbitone, phenytoin, diazepam and valproate given parenterally. Although the efficacy of the four drugs is similar when given parenterally, fewer side-effects are seen with valproate.",

In this paper we include the recommended measures for the treatment of acute seizures and status epilepticus in childhood and suggest the development of similar measures for adult patients.", 
    "70": "This investigation is the Danish contribution to a Nordic comparative study of other drugs than alcohol found in road users.", 
    "71": "255 blood samples received from the police for alcohol and/or drug determination during one week in 1996 were investigated for drugs.", 
    "72": "56 (22%) of the 255 blood samples were positive for other drugs than alcohol. Cannabis was detected in 11%, benzodiazepines, mainly diazepam and flunitrazepam, in 9% and amphetamine in 5% of the blood samples.", 
    "73": "The police suspected other drugs than alcohol in 3% of the 255 blood samples, but drugs were detected in 22%. This investigation showed that the frequency of other drugs than alcohol was similar in Denmark and Norway for the blood samples with an alcohol concentration above the statutory limit. This contrasts with the fact that the number of blood samples from road users investigated for substances other than alcohol is about 200/year in Denmark and 4000/year in Norway.", 
    "74": "Ganaxolone (3alpha-hydroxy-3beta-methyl-5alpha-pregnane-20-one), an orally active synthetic analog of the neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone, is a positive allosteric modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors with anticonvulsant properties. We sought to determine whether tolerance occurs to the anticonvulsant activity of ganaxolone in the pentylenetetrazol seizure test and whether there is cross-tolerance with diazepam. Rats were treated with two daily injections of a 2 x ED(50) dose of ganaxolone (7 mg/kg s.c.), diazepam (4 mg/kg i.p.), or vehicle for 3 or 7 days. On the day after the chronic treatment periods, the anticonvulsant potencies of ganaxolone and diazepam were determined. The ED(50) values for ganaxolone after 3- and 7-day treatment with ganaxolone were not significantly different from that in naive rats (ED(50) = 3.5 mg/kg). In contrast, in animals that were treated chronically with ganaxolone for 7 days, there was a significant reduction in the anticonvulsant potency of diazepam (ED(50) = 4.0 versus 1.9 mg/kg for naive controls). Chronic treatment with diazepam was not associated with a reduction in the potency of ganaxolone, but there was a reduction in the potency of diazepam (ED(50) = 3.7 mg/kg). Plasma ganaxolone determinations indicated that the pharmacokinetic properties of ganaxolone were unchanged after 7-day chronic ganaxolone treatment. The estimated equilibrium plasma concentrations of ganaxolone associated with threshold (750-950 ng/ml) and 50% seizure protection (1215-1295 ng/ml) were similar in naive and chronically treated rats. We conclude that there is no tolerance to the anticonvulsant activity of ganaxolone nor is there cross-tolerance to ganaxolone when tolerance develops to diazepam. However, there is cross-tolerance to diazepam with chronic ganaxolone treatment.", 
    "75": "The pharmacological effects of ethanolic Vitex agnus-castus fruit-extracts (especially Ze 440) and various extract fractions of different polarities were evaluated both by radioligand binding studies and by superfusion experiments. A relative potent binding inhibition was observed for dopamine D2 and opioid (micro and kappa subtype) receptors with IC50 values of the native extract between 20 and 70 mg/mL. Binding, neither to the histamine H1, benzodiazepine and OFQ receptor, nor to the binding-site of the serotonin (5-HT) transporter, was significantly inhibited. The lipophilic fractions contained the diterpenes rotun-difuran and 6beta,7beta-diacetoxy-13-hydroxy-labda-8,14-dien . They exhibited inhibitory actions on dopamine D2 receptor binding. While binding inhibition to mu and kappa opioid receptors was most pronounced in lipophilic fractions, binding to delta opioid receptors was inhibited mainly by a aqueous fraction. Standardised Ze 440 extracts of different batches were of constant pharmacological quality according to their potential to inhibit the binding to D2 receptors. In superfusion experiments, the aqueous fraction of a methanolic extract inhibited the release of acetylcholine in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the potent D2 receptor antagonist spiperone antagonised the effect of the extract suggesting a dopaminergic action mediated by D2 receptor activation. Our results indicate a dopaminergic effect of Vitex agnus-castus extracts and suggest additional pharmacological actions via opioid receptors.", 
    "76": "GH secretagogues (GHS) possess potent GH-releasing activity but also stimulate PRL, ACTH and cortisol (F) secretion. To further clarify the endocrine activities of GHS, in 9 obese patients, 9 patients with Cushing's disease and 14 controls we studied the ACTH, F, GH and PRL responses to hexarelin (HEX, 2.0 micrograms/kg i.v.), a peptidyl GHS, alone and preceeded by alprazolam (ALP, 0.02 mg/kg p.o.), a benzodiazepine. The HEX-induced ACTH response in controls was similar to that in obese patients (delta peak: 9.9 +/- 1.9 and 24.7 +/- 7.6 ng/L, respectively) and both were lower (p < 0.002) than that in Cushing's patients (peak: 210.7 +/- 58.4 ng/L). The GH response to HEX in controls (peak: 58.1 +/- 10.3 x g/L) was higher (p < 0.001) than those in obese and Cushing's patients (18.2 +/- 3.8 and 12.6 +/- 5.4 x g/L, respectively) which, in turn, were similar. The PRL responses to HEX in controls, obese and Cushing's patients (peak: 11.9 +/- 1.6, 18.0 +/- 4.5 and 12.4 +/- 1.4 x g/L, respectively) were similar. In controls the HEX-induced ACTH response was abolished by ALP (peak: 8.6 +/- 2.4 vs 28.0 +/- 6.7 ng/L, p < 0.03) which, on the other hand, only blunted that in obese (peak: 12.7 +/- 2.1 vs 42.4 +/- 8.4 ng/L, p < 0.02) and did not modify that in Cushing's patients (205.6 +/- 55.4 vs 175.9 +/- 47.6 ng/L). ALP blunted the GH response to HEX in controls (peak: 31.0 +/- 7.1 x g/L, p < 0.03) while did not modify those in obese and in Cushing's patients (14.5 +/- 5.3 and 13.3 +/- 11.1 x g/L, respectively). ALP did not modify the HEX-induced PRL response in controls, obese and Cushing's patients (peak: 13.8 +/- 0.9, 16.3 +/- 2.4 and 19.2 +/- 1.1 x g/L, respectively). In conclusion, alprazolam inhibits the ACTH response to hexarelin in normal and obese subjects while fails to modify the exaggerated ACTH response in Cushing's Disease suggesting that GHS activate the HPA axis via the hypothalamus in normal and obese subjects but not in patients with Cushing's disease. Alprazolam is also able to blunt the GH-releasing activity of hexarelin in normal subjects but not the low GH response to the hexapeptide in obese and Cushing's patients. The PRL-releasing activity of hexarelin in controls, obese and hypercortisolemic patients is similar and is not modified by alprazolam pretreatment.", 
    "77": "In vivo treatment of mice with peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands exerts an inhibitory effect on the inflammatory response in two models of acute inflammation. In the first model, pretreatment of the animals (24 h) with 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide (PK11195) and 7-chloro-5-(4-Chlorophenyl)-1, 3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2 (Ro5-4864), at different doses (0.00001-10 mg/kg, i.p.) dose dependently inhibited the formation of mouse paw oedema induced by carrageenan with mean ID(50s) of 0.009 (95% confidence limits=0.0076-0.013) and 0.04 (95% confidence limits=0.025-0.0086) mg/kg, respectively. Both ligands (0. 1 mg/kg, i.p.) inhibited in the same way the mouse paw oedema induced by carrageenan in animals with and without adrenal glands. PK11195 and Ro5-4864 (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) inhibited the mouse paw oedema induced by several inflammatory mediators. In the second model, the pretreatment (24 h) with peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) exerted an inhibitory effect on neutrophil influx and produce a marked inhibition of carrageenan-produced interleukin-13 and interleukin-6 in pleural exudation. Our results extend previous findings that peripheral benzodiazepine receptor is involved in the inflammatory response, and suggest that this action may be linked to the action of different inflammatory mediators, probably mainly by the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.", 
    "78": "A 57 year old woman with post-traumatic complex partial seizures was admitted because of recurrent episodes of altered mental state over the preceding 4 years, each lasting up to 5 days. There was a history of dietary protein intolerance since childhood and two of her daughters had died in the neonatal period from unexplained encephalopathies. In hospital she developed fluctuating confusion, amnesia, and sudden episodes of unresponsiveness. An EEG was consistent with complex partial status epilepticus but there was no response to benzodiazepines. Nasogastric feeding and sodium valproate were given and shortly afterwards she lapsed into a deep coma. Blood ammonia and urinary orotate were raised, and genetic testing confirmed that she was a carrier of a mutation in exon 3 of the ornithine transcarbamylase gene (C to T at position 92). Treatment with protein restriction, carnitine, and sodium phenylbutyrate led to a full recovery over a period of 3 months. To our knowledge this is the oldest age of onset yet described in a manifesting carrier. She is the fifth patient with heterozygous ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency reported to have had a severe reaction to sodium valproate. Hyperammonaemic encephalopathy should be considered in patients of any age who experience fluctuating confusion.", 
    "79": "If changes in thermoregulation mediate sleepiness induced by sedative/hypnotics, then a reduction in the soporific efficacy (tolerance) of these agents may be accompanied by a concomitant reduction in their thermoregulatory effects. We compared the thermoregulatory and soporific effects of acute temazepam (30 mg at 1400) in 11 young male subjects before and immediately after 7 consecutive days of temazepam (30 mg). Subjects lay supine (0800-2030), while foot (T(ft)) and rectal (T(c)) temperatures were recorded. Sleep onset latency (SOL) was measured hourly using 20-min multiple sleep latency tests. Relative to placebo, temazepam significantly reduced both T(c) and SOL (-0.31 degrees C and 14.1 min) while increasing T(ft) (3.39 degrees C). A significant tolerance developed after the week of temazepam, with a mean reduction in soporific efficacy of 4.0 +/- 0.8 min. This was accompanied by a concomitant attenuation in both T(c) (-0.16 degrees C) and T(ft) (1.44 degrees C). Furthermore, SOL was temporally related to T(ft) and the maximum rate of decline in T(c) before and after tolerance. Together, these results indicate that the thermoregulatory system may be functionally involved in the regulation of sleepiness.", 
    "80": "The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the antipsychotic agent olanzapine on glucose-insulin homeostasis to explain possible mechanisms behind olanzapine-associated weight gain.", 
    "81": "Fourteen patients on treatment with olanzapine (all meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or related psychoses) were studied. Fasting blood samples for glucose, insulin, the growth hormone (GH)-dependent insulin-like growth factor I, and the insulin-dependent insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) were analyzed, as well as GH, leptin, and blood lipid levels and the serum concentrations of olanzapine and its metabolite N-desmethylolanzapine. In addition, body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Moreover, weight change during olanzapine treatment was determined.", 
    "82": "Twelve of the 14 patients reported weight gain between 1 and 10 kg during a median olanzapine treatment time of 5 months, whereas data were not available for the other 2 patients. Eight patients (57%) had BMI above the normal limit. Eleven patients were normoglycemic, and 3 showed increased blood glucose values. Most patients (10/14; 71%) had elevated insulin levels (i.e., above the normal limit). Accordingly, the median value of IGFBP-1 was significantly lower for the patients in comparison with healthy subjects. Moreover, 8 (57%) of 14 patients had hyperleptinemia, 62% (8/13) had hypertriglyceridemia, and 85% (11/13) hypercholesterolemia. Weight change correlated positively to blood glucose levels and inversely to the serum concentration level of N-desmethylolanzapine. Additionally, the levels of blood glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol correlated inversely to the serum concentration of N-desmethylolanzapine.", 
    "83": "Olanzapine treatment was associated with weight gain and elevated levels of insulin, leptin, and blood lipids as well as insulin resistance, with 3 patients diagnosed to have diabetes mellitus. Both increased insulin secretion and hyprleptinemia may be mechanisms behind olanzapine-induced weight gain. Moreover, it is suggested that the metabolite N-desmethylolanzapine, but not olanzapine, has a normalizing effect on the metabolic abnormalities.",

    "85": "Twenty-five infertile women with premature ovarian failure underwent bilateral ovarian biopsy plus chromoperturbation. Twelve patients were treated with minilaparoscopy (minilap group) and preoperatively received mepivacaine for subcutaneous local anesthesia and midazolam plus fentanyl for conscious sedation. Following minilaparoscopy, 40 mL of 0.5% intraperitoneal subdiaphragmatic lidocaine and 5 mL of ropivacaine, 7.5 mg/mL, for infiltration of the trocar insertion sites were administered. Thirteen women (control group) were treated with the traditional laparoscopic approach under general anesthesia. If necessary, ketoprofene or intramuscular ketorolac was administered following surgery. Postoperative pain score was evaluated by a 1-10 visual analogic scale immediately after surgery and in the following 24 hours; in addition, the quantity of ovarian biopsy material for the pathologist and the discharge and operative times were evaluated.", 
    "86": "The minilap group had lower postoperative pain scores postoperatively. Operative time was similar in both groups. The rate of discharge two hours after surgery was significantly higher in the minilap group. In all cases the amount of ovarian tissue was sufficient for diagnosis. Twenty-one patients were affected by premature menopause and four by resistant ovary syndrome. The need for postoperative analgesics was significantly higher in the control group.", 
    "87": "Minilap allows the performance of bilateral, multiple ovarian biopsy under local anesthesia and conscious sedation in association with chromoperturbation and the obtaining a sufficient amount of ovarian tissue for histopathologic diagnosis. Intraperitoneal lidocaine administration and ropivacaine infiltration of the trocar sites were beneficial for patients undergoing operative minilap in a day-surgery setting. The effect of these drugs was obviously temporary; however, low postoperative pain scores and low additional analgesic requirement permitted early discharge, within two hours after surgery.", 
    "88": "Ethanol is thought to produce its discriminative stimulus effect by actions on two or more neurotransmitter systems. To test this idea further, rats were trained to discriminate mixtures of two drugs from vehicle in two-lever procedures with food reinforcers presented on a tandem variable-interval fixed ratio schedule. After drug-appropriate responding with the training mixtures reached 85%, generalisation to ethanol was examined in extinction tests. Rats trained to discriminate a mixture of chlordiazepoxide (5.0 mg/kg, s. c.) plus dizocilpine (0.08 mg/kg, i.p.) yielded a mean of 76% drug-appropriate responding when tested with ethanol (3.0 g/kg, i.g. ). However, when rats were trained with an 8.0 mg/kg dose of pentobarbitone in a mixture with 0.08 mg/kg of dizocilpine, the same dose of ethanol produced only 33% drug-appropriate responding. After retraining with pentobarbitone (12 mg/kg) plus dizocilpine (0.04 mg/kg), ethanol (3.0 g/kg, i.g.) produced 75% drug-appropriate responding. Pentobarbitone and dizocilpine administered alone produced full, dose-related generalisation, but there was no generalisation to (+)-amphetamine (0.025-0.8 mg/kg, s.c.). Thus, ethanol substituted for mixtures in which the GABA(A)-modulatory component had equal or greater salience than the NMDA-antagonist component. Doses of ethanol that generalised with the drug mixtures always reduced overall rates of responding as compared with control rates. Nevertheless, these data provide further support for the hypothesis that ethanol produces a compound stimulus comprised of elements resembling the effects of positive modulators of GABA(A) receptors and those of NMDA antagonists.", 
    "89": "The role of AMPA and GluR5-containing kainate receptors in the development and expression of amygdala kindling was examined using the selective 2,3-benzodiazepine AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI 52466 [(1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2, 3-benzodiazepine] and the decahydroisoquinoline mixed AMPA receptor and GluR5 kainate receptor antagonist LY293558 {(3S,4aR,6R, 8aR)-6-[2-(1(2)H-tetrazole-5-yl)ethyl]decahydroisoquinoline- 3-carboxy lic acid)}. Administration of GYKI 52466 (5-40 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and LY293558 (10-40 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) prior to daily kindling stimulation in mice produced a dose-dependent suppression of the rate of development of behavioral kindled seizure activity and reduced the duration of the stimulation-induced electrographic afterdischarge. In drug-free stimulation sessions after the initial drug-treatment sessions, there was an acceleration in the rate of kindling development compared with the rate during the preceding drug-administration period; the \"rebound\" rate was also greater than the kindling rate in saline-treated control animals. In fully kindled animals, both GYKI 52466 and LY293558 produced a dose-dependent suppression of evoked seizures (ED(50), 19.3 and 16.7 mg/kg, respectively). Although AMPA receptors appear to be critical to the expression of kindled seizures, since kindling development progressed despite the suppression of behavioral seizure activity, AMPA receptors are less important to the kindling process. LY293558 was modestly less effective at suppressing behavioral seizures during kindling and was not superior to GYKI 52466 in retarding the overall extent of kindling development, indicating that GluR5 kainate receptors do not contribute to epileptogenesis in this model.", 
    "90": "Porcine Leydig cells in primary cultures are resistant to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) cytotoxicity. Here we report that these cells can be rendered sensitive to TNFalpha killing by treatment with the translational inhibitor cycloheximide, suggesting the existence of proteins that can suppress the death stimulus induced by the cytokine. In search of these cytoprotective proteins, we focused on the constituents of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PT pore), whose opening has been shown to play a critical role in the TNFalpha-mediated death pathway. We found that TNFalpha up-regulated mRNA and protein expression of the mitochondrial peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), an outer membrane-derived constituent of the pore. A strong correlation was established between the resistance of the cells to TNFalpha killing and the density of PBR-binding sites. Concomitantly, TNFalpha down-regulated Bcl-2 mRNA and protein expression. As Bcl-2 has been shown to be an endogenous inhibitor of the PT pore, we hypothesize that the TNFalpha-induced up-regulation of PBR expression may compensate for the decrease in Bcl-2 levels to prevent the opening of the PT pore.", 
    "91": "Deliberate self-harm is a major problem in the developing world, responsible for around 600 000 deaths in 1990. The toxicity of available poisons and paucity of medical services ensure that mortality from self-poisoning is far greater in the tropics than in the industrialized world. Few data are available on the poisons most commonly used for self-harm in different parts of the world. This paper reviews the literature on poisoning, to identify the important poisons used for self-harm in these regions. Pesticides are the most important poison throughout the tropics, being both common and associated with a high mortality rate. In some regions, particular pesticides have become the most popular method of self-harm, gaining a notoriety amongst both health-care workers and public. Self-poisoning with medicines such as benzodiazepines and antidepressants is common in urban areas, but associated with few deaths. The antimalarial chloroquine appears the most significant medicine, self-poisoning being common in both Africa and the Pacific region, and often fatal. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is used in many countries but in few has it reached the popularity typical of the UK. Domestic and industrial chemicals are responsible for significant numbers of deaths and long-term disabilities world-wide. Self-poisoning with plant parts, although uncommon globally, is locally popular in some regions. Few of these poisons have specific antidotes. This emphasizes the importance of determining whether interventions aimed at reducing poison absorption actually produce a clinical benefit, reducing death and complication rates. Future research to improve medical management and find effective ways of reducing the incidence of self-harm, together with more widespread provision of interventions proven to be effective, could rapidly reduce the number of deaths from self-poisoning in the developing world.", 
    "92": "The anaesthetic and cardiopulmonary effects of combinations of medetomidine (Me), midazolam (Mi) and butorphanol (Bu) were evaluated in dogs. The characterization of anaesthetic effects was assessed using a scoring system. The combinations tested were 20 or 40 micrograms/kg Me and 0.5 mg/kg Mi (20Me-Mi or 40Me-Mi) followed by either an intravenous injection of physiological saline solution (PSS) or Bu (0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg). The mixture of Me and Mi was injected intramuscularly, followed 15 min later by an intravenous injection of Bu or PSS in all six groups. The combined Me-Mi induced deep sedation but not profound anaesthesia. The effect of the subsequent Bu administration was observed in the scores related to its analgesic effect. There were no significant differences between the two doses of Bu, following either 20Me-Mi or 40Me-Mi in the duration of anaesthesia, heart and respiratory rates, rectal temperature, and anaesthetic and analgesic scores except for palpebral reflex, and interdigital web clamping scores. Therefore, we concluded that the addition of 0.1 mg/kg Bu to Me-Mi elicits adequate anaesthesia with adequate analgesic effect, and side-effects such as bradycardia, hypertension, and slight respiratory acidosis in some dogs.",

    "94": "From 1976 through 1998, data were collected from hospital patients in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore based on demographic factors, reproductive and medical history, and medication use. In the present analyses, cases of epithelial ovarian cancer (n = 748) were compared with cancer controls (n = 1496) and noncancer controls admitted for trauma and acute infection (n = 1496). We estimated Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios adjusted for age, study center, and year of interview.",

For tricyclics and benzodiazepines the upper 95% confidence limits were less than 1.6. For phenothiazines the upper limit was 2.6 with cancer controls and 1.4 with noncancer controls. Only five cases used SSRIs, yielding unstable results. Odds ratios were not increased among women who had used any drug class for at least 5 years, nor among women who had first used them 10 or more years previously.",

    "97": "A 33-yr-old pregnant woman developed recurrent motor-ataxia-like abnormal motion of the lower legs during the recovery from spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric tetracaine for repeated cesarean section. This symptom was thought to be due to the disturbance of coordination associated with the loss of positional sensation because deep sensory blockade seemed to be stronger and longer than motor blockade. The etiology of this abnormal motion could not be explained clearly, but her anatomical structure of the spine and her sensitivity to local anesthetic may have been related to this phenomenon.", 
    "98": "Potential for inhibition of CYP3A activity by simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, was evaluated in 12 healthy male subjects who received placebo or 80 mg of simvastatin, the maximal recommended dose, once daily for 7 consecutive days. On day 7, an intravenous injection of 3 microCi [14C N-methyl]erythromycin for the erythromycin breath test (EBT) was coadministered with a 2 mg oral solution of midazolam. The values for percent 14C exhaled during the first hour (for EBT) and the pharmacokinetic parameters of midazolam (AUC, Cmax, t1/2) were not affected following multiple once-daily oral doses of simvastatin 80 mg. The 95% confidence interval was 0.97 to 1.18 for EBT and 0.99 to 1.23 for midazolam AUC. In addition, the total urinary recoveries of midazolam and its 1'-hydroxy metabolites (free plus conjugate) obtained from both treatments were not statistically different (p > 0.200). These data demonstrate that multiple dosing of simvastatin, at the highest recommended clinical dose, does not significantly alter the in vivo hepatic or intestinal CYP3A4/5 activity as measured by the commonly used EBT and oral midazolam probes.", 
    "99": "Considering the large yield of viable cells comparable to human liver, primary porcine hepatocytes offer a valuable resource for constructing a bioartificial liver device. In this study, the ability of cultured primary porcine hepatocytes to detoxify xenobiotics has been examined using various known substrates of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. Present investigation demonstrated the stability of the isoenzymes responsible for the metabolism of diazepam in native state and stabilization of other isoenzymes, as judged by ethoxycoumarin o-dealkylase (ECOD), ethoxyresorufin o-dealkylase (EROD), benzyloxyresorufin o-dealkylase (BROD), and pentoxyresorufin o-dealkylase (PROD) activities following induction in culture environment, for a period of 8 days. Resorufin O-dealkylase activities were found to be the most unstable and deteriorated within first 5 days in culture. These activities were restored following induction with 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) or sodium phenobarbital (PB) to 20-fold of 1 activity for EROD, and 60 and 174% of day 1 activity for PROD and BROD on day 8, respectively. Metabolism of methoxyresorufin was most strikingly increased following induction with 3-MC to approximately 60-fold of day 1 activity, on day 8. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-dependent glucuronidation of phenol red, however, stayed intact during the course of our study without induction. Our study indicated that porcine hepatocytes in vitro maintain many important liver-specific functions including detoxification (steady state and inducibility).", 
    "100": "We present the case of a 42-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia who developed signs and symptoms consistent with Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) after 3 weeks of treatment with Olanzapine. The patient presented with hyperpyrexia, tremors, labile blood pressure, and mental status changes that had progressed over the preceding 24 h. Laboratory data revealed a metabolic acidosis and an escalating creatinine phosphokinase. Olanzapine is a relatively new atypical anti-psychotic agent first introduced in November of 1996 under the trade name of zyprexa. Olanzapine differs from typical anti-psychotic agents in that it has a lower affinity for dopaminergic receptors and binds antagonistically to serotonin receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway. These unique properties result in relatively fewer extra-pyramidal symptoms when compared to traditional anti-psychotics. Because of olanzapine's favorable side-effect profile, it has quickly gained popularity in the psychiatric community. Although NMS is a recognized complication of anti-psychotic use, there has been only one case of olanzapine induced NMS reported in the literature. The POISON-INDEX system, used by toxicologists throughout the United States, does not list NMS as a potential reaction to olanzapine. The pharmacists at our institution were also unaware that NMS was a possible complication of olanzapine. We present this case to make clinicians aware of the potential for Olanzapine induced NMS.", 
    "101": "A variety of nucleophiles, including amines, thiolates, and alkoxides, were employed to open the aziridinium ions Az. The latter are opened stereospecifically and regioselectively at the C-3 position by a wide range of amines, and thiolate nucleophiles attack predominately at the C-2 position. Poor regioselectivities (ca. 1:1) were observed using nucleophiles derived from phenols, carboxylic acids, and imides. Base-mediated ring closure of the aziridinium opening products, from primary amines, gave beta-lactams and a 1, 5-benzodiazepin-2-one in high yields.",

    "103": "The clinical features, outcomes, differential diagnoses, epidemiology, risk factors, and treatment approaches to tardive drug-induced extrapyramidal syndromes (EPS) are reviewed. Tardive forms of dyskinesia (TD), dystonia (TDt), akathisia (TA), Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (TGTS), myoclonus (TM), and parkinsonism (TP) are described. Moreover, pharmacological and topographical subtypes of TD are discussed. While TD, TDt, and TA are clearly delineated syndromes, there are limited data on TGTS, TM, and the questionable TP. TDt is distinguished from TD by clinical and treatment-related variables. Epidemiological studies provide evidence of better prognosis for TD compared with both TDt and TA. Two distinct groups of variables were found to be associated with a higher risk for TD: an exogenous factor (neuroleptic treatment variables and alcohol or drug abuse) and a factor of predisposition (elderly, female, affective disorder diagnosis, presence of EPS, diabetes mellitus type II, and signs of central vulnerability). In contrast, being younger and male was associated with TDt. A significant relationship between the hyperkinetic forms of tardive EPS was confirmed. Therapeutic strategy differs for the mild, moderate, and severe forms of tardive EPS. Using low doses of antipsychotics is a good preventive approach. Reducing the dose or switching to an atypical antipsychotic is the usual, but not yet fully explored, first therapeutic step. Clozapine, an antipsychotic with antidyskinetic and antidystonic effectiveness, is the second treatment step. Various suppressors of tardive movements were tested in controlled trials, mainly in TD. GABAergic benzodiazepines (clonazepam), adrenergic antagonists (propranolol, clonidine), antioxidants (alpha-tocopherol), and calcium channel blockers (nifedipine) are useful in the third step of treatment of more severe tardive EPS. Unlike TD, TDt and (partially) TA improve on higher doses of anticholinergic medication. Local injection of botulinum A toxin markedly ameliorates focal tardive dystonia over several months. Less verified therapeutic interventions are discussed.", 
    "104": "Our previous work has shown that chronic haloperidol treatment decreases striatal symmetric synapses preferentially in rats which develop oral dyskinesias (vacuous chewing movements (VCMs)). The present experiment tests the hypothesis that olanzapine, which does not cause dyskinesia in humans or rats, would not cause the ultrastructural changes produced by haloperidol. After 6 months of treatment, VCM scores for the olanzapine group (5.1 +/- 4.5) were similar to those of controls (5.2 +/- 3.9), whereas rats in the haloperidol group were either nondyskinetic (4.3 +/- 2.2) or dyskinetic (16.9 +/- 6.7). The volume of the striatum (mm(3)), did not differ among the groups: control, 37.5 +/- 4.7; olanzapine, 36.4 +/- 4.3; haloperidol, nondyskinetic, 40.5 +/- 6.3; haloperidol, dyskinetic, 36.6 +/- 5.9. Synaptic density (per 1 microm(3)), obtained from the central region of the striatum, did not differ between the olanzapine (0.699 +/- 0.146) and control groups (0.652 +/- 0.108). The number of asymmetric synapses in the olanzapine group (0.624 +/- 0.136) was also similar to that of controls (0.550 +/- 0.090). The number of symmetric synapses in the olanzapine group (0.074 +/- 0.032) was not significantly different from that of controls (0.096 +/- 0.043). Thus, olanzapine, in contrast to haloperidol, did not produce dyskinesias or synapse loss. These results strengthen the correlation between the expression of VCMs and striatal synaptic changes and indicate that olanzapine has fewer behavioral and anatomical side effects than does haloperidol.", 
    "105": "Co-induction is the concurrent administration of two or more drugs that facilitate induction of anaesthesia. Some combinations have been shown to have pharmacological advantages. In addition to the safety and comfort of the patient, it is also important to find a cost effective combination in view of the rather stringent economy of the times. This project was undertaken to study the response of Nigerian patients to co-induction (midazolam and propofol) by comparison with the traditional thiopentone or propofol alone, and to study the cost implications. 45 patients who came in for various surgical procedures were randomly assigned to three different groups. The first group was induced with thiopentone alone. The second group had a combination of midazolam and propofol and the third group had propofol alone. In all other respects except for the surgery the patients had the same treatment. The induction was satisfactory in all groups. The cardiovascular and respiratory changes were within clinically acceptable limits but the emergence was best with propofol, followed by midazolam/propofol and thiopentone in that order. Although thiopentone was the cheapest in terms of absolute cost, the combination of midazolam and propofol was most cost-effective.", 
    "106": "A method for the detection of diazepam in horse hair samples by low resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was developed. Two other techniques, gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) and high-performance liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical-ionisation mass spectrometry (HPLC-APCI-MS-MS) were applied on some selected samples. Sample preparation was performed according to a technique previously described for human hair, involving incubation with Sorensen buffer and solvent extraction. Hair samples from different sites such as coat on the neck, coat on the back, mane and tail were collected from two thoroughbreds which had received several dosages of diazepam corresponding to a total dose of 750 mg and 200 mg of diazepam respectively. In the first experiment, by low resolution GC-MS using single ion monitoring, diazepam was detected in the mane for at least 85 d after the last administration. In the second one, using the same method, diazepam was detected in the coat on the neck up to 25 d following the last administration. Low resolution GC-MS data were confirmed by the two other techniques. Furthermore, GC-HRMS even made possible the detection of diazepam up to 38 d after the administration of 200 mg of diazepam.", 
    "107": "In preparation of a trial on the neuroprotective effect of GABAergic activation by a benzodiazepine, we performed a feasibility study in 104 patients with acute (less than 24 h) stroke. 5 mg diazepam twice daily for 5 days (n = 44) was well tolerated, feasible, and appeared to be safe. Testing a dose of 10 mg twice daily for 5 days (n = 17) was stopped early because of drowsiness around day 5, interfering with regular patient care. A dose of 10 mg twice daily for 3 days was well tolerated, despite reported drowsiness in 12 of 43 patients. First-dose application by rectiole was feasible in 97% of the 104 patients. No blood pressure drop or respiratory arrest or insufficiency were detected, whereas the 2-week case fatality rate was similar to that of controls matched for age, sex, and stroke severity. We conclude that testing the GABAergic activity during the acute phase of stroke by 10 mg diazepam twice daily for 3 days is well tolerated and practically feasible, and it does not subject patients to an increased risk of potential serious adverse effects. Preparations for a large randomized trial are in a final stage.", 
    "108": "Regional variations and substrates of high-frequency rhythmic activity induced by cholinergic stimulation were studied in hippocampal slices with 64-electrode recording arrays. (1) Carbachol triggered beta waves (17.6 +/- 5.7 Hz) in pyramidal regions of 75% of the slices. (2) The waves had phase shifts across the cell body layers and were substantially larger in the apical dendrites than in cell body layers or basal dendrites. (3) Continuous, two-dimensional current source density analyses indicated apical sinks associated with basal sources, lasting approximately 10 msec, followed by apical sources and basal sinks, lasting approximately 20 msec, in a repeating pattern with a period in the range of 15-25 Hz. (4) Carbachol-induced beta waves in the hippocampus were accompanied by 40 Hz (gamma) oscillations in deep layers of the entorhinal cortex. (5) Cholinergically elicited beta and gamma rhythms were eliminated by antagonists of either AMPA or GABA receptors. Benzodiazepines markedly enhanced beta activity and sometimes introduced a distinct gamma frequency peak. (6) Twenty Hertz activity after orthodromic activation of field CA3 was distributed in the same manner as carbachol-induced beta waves and was generated by a current source in the apical dendrites of CA3. This source was eliminated by high concentrations of GABA(A) receptor blockers. It is concluded that cholinergically driven beta rhythms arise independently in hippocampal subfields from oscillatory circuits involving (1) bursts of pyramidal cell discharges, (2) activation of a subset of feedback interneurons that project apically, and (3) production of a GABA(A)-mediated hyperpolarization in the outer portions of the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons.",

    "110": "The kinetics of the formation of 6 beta-naltrexol from naltrexone were examined in eight human liver cytosol preparations using h.p.l.c. to quantify 6 beta-naltrexol and, the extent of inhibition of 6 beta-naltrexol formation was determined using chemical inhibitors. The formation of 6 beta-naltrexol and the back reaction of 6 beta-naltrexol to naltrexone were also examined in a microsomal preparation.", 
    "111": "The Vmax, Km and CLint values for the formation of 6 beta-naltrexol from naltrexone were in the ranges of 16-45 nmol mg-1 protein h-1, 17-53 microM and 0.3-2.2 ml h-1 mg-1 protein, respectively. The steroid hormones testosterone (Ki = 0.3 +/- 0.1 microM) and dihydrotestosterone (Ki = 0.7 +/- 0.4 microM) were the most potent competitive inhibitors of 6 beta-naltrexol formation, with naloxone, menadione and corticosterone also producing > 50% inhibition at a concentration of 100 microM. The opioid agonists morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone and hydromorphone, and a range of benzodiazepines showed < 20% inhibition at 100 microM. In the microsomal preparation, there was no formation of naltrexone from 6beta-naltrexol nor any formation of 6beta-naltrexol from naltrexone.", 
    "112": "The intersubject variability in the kinetic parameters of 6beta-naltrexol formation could play a role in the efficacy of and patient compliance with naltrexone treatment. This variability could be due in part to a genetic polymorphism of the dihydrodiol dehydrogenase DD4, one of the enzymes reported to be responsible for the formation of 6beta-naltrexol from naltrexone. DD4 also has hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity which could account for the potent inhibition by the steroid hormones testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. The clinical significance of the latter finding remains to be established.", 
    "113": "The hygroscopicity of the contents of clorazepate dipotassium (Mendon) capsules (CM) was investigated by storage at various relative humidities (RHs). The CM adsorbed water vapor significantly at more than 75% RH. At the same time, a marked discoloration of CM from white to yellow was also observed during storage. On the basis of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform (FT) Raman spectroscopy, the discoloration seemed to be due to the change in clorazepate dipotassium to nordiazepam and other substances. It was found that, when opening of the Mendon capsule is necessary to prepare the powdered dosage form, the CM should be stored below 60% RH to avoid the adsorption of water vapor and discoloration.", 
    "114": "We tested the hypothesis that the release of PYY by fat confined to the proximal small intestine is dependent on CCK. Using a multi-fistulated model, plasma PYY levels were compared in 6 dogs after 60 mM oleate was perfused into the proximal one-half of the small intestine following i.v. administration of saline or devazepide, a CCK-A antagonist. Plasma PYY increased with fat (P < 0. 05), but plasma PYY level was lower following devazepide at 60 min and 90 min (P < 0.05). We conclude that CCK serves as a foregut signal linking fat in the proximal gut with the release of distal gut PYY.", 
    "115": "The effect of caseinomacropeptide (CMP) (the [106-169] fragment of kappa-casein produced during digestion of milk protein), was studied in anesthetized rats using bile diversion for a pure pancreatic juice collection system. Intraduodenal administration of CMP induced a dose-related specific stimulation of pancreatic secretion which was nearly abolished by devazepide, atropine, hexamethonium, vagotomy or perivagal capsaicin pretreatment. Moreover, CMP did not inhibit in vitro trypsin activity. These results demonstrate that CMP is more likely to stimulate pancreatic secretion specifically through cholecystokinin release and activation of a vago-vagal cholinergic reflex loop than by inhibition of luminal trypsin, in anesthetized rats.", 
    "116": "In the CNS, inhibitory synaptic function undergoes profound transformation during early postnatal development. This is due to variations in the subunit composition of subsynaptic GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) at differing developmental stages as well as other factors. These include changes in the driving force for chloride-mediated conductances as well as the quantity and/or cleft lifetime of released neurotransmitter. The present study was undertaken to investigate the nature and time course of developmental maturation of GABAergic synaptic function in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. In neonatal [postnatal day (P) 1-7] and immature (P8-14) CA1 neurons, miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were significantly larger, were less frequent, and had slower kinetics compared with mIPSCs recorded in more mature neurons. Adult mIPSC kinetics were achieved by the third postnatal week in CA1 neurons. However, despite this apparent maturation of mIPSC kinetics, significant differences in modulation of mIPSCs by allosteric agonists in adolescent (P15-21) neurons were still evident. Diazepam (1-300 nM) and zolpidem (200 nM) increased the amplitude of mIPSCs in adolescent but not adult neurons. Both drugs increased mIPSC decay times equally at both ages. These differential agonist effects on mIPSC amplitude suggest that in adolescent CA1 neurons, inhibitory synapses operate differently than adult synapses and function as if subsynaptic receptors are not fully occupied by quantal release of GABA. Rapid agonist application experiments on perisomatic patches pulled from adolescent neurons provided additional support for this hypothesis. In GABA(A)R currents recorded in these patches, benzodiazepine amplitude augmentation effects were evident only when nonsaturating GABA concentrations were applied. Furthermore nonstationary noise analysis of mIPSCs in P15-21 neurons revealed that zolpidem-induced mIPSC augmentation was not due to an increase in single-channel conductance of subsynaptic GABA(A)Rs but rather to an increase in the number of open channels responding to a single GABA quantum, further supporting the hypothesis that synaptic receptors may not be saturated during synaptic function in adolescent neurons. These data demonstrate that inhibitory synaptic transmission undergoes a markedly protracted postnatal maturation in rat CA1 pyramidal neurons. In the first two postnatal weeks, mIPSCs are large in amplitude, are slow, and occur infrequently. By the third postnatal week, mIPSCs have matured kinetically but retain distinct responses to modulatory drugs, possibly reflecting continued immaturity in synaptic structure and function persisting through adolescence.", 
    "117": "A descriptive study using data from the medical records of 448 children with febrile convulsion was carried out to determine the seizure characteristics and use of anti-convulsant therapy for febrile convulsions in a Malaysian hospital. There was a higher incidence of multiple seizures and a lower incidence of focal seizures in the local population than in studies done among Western populations. The majority of initial seizures occurred within 24 h of fever onset. Transient neurological abnormalities following an acute seizure were common. A quarter of children referred by general practitioners had been given anti-convulsants prior to referral but up to 20% of general practitioners had used ineffective routes for administering diazepam. However, diazepam used in the hospital was found to be effective in controlling acute febrile seizures.", 
    "118": "Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of 1) different concentrations of dietary fat and 2) i.v. administration of a cholecystokinin receptor antagonist (MK-329) on feed intake and plasma concentrations of hormones and metabolites in dairy cattle. In Experiment 1, 4 lactating Holstein cows were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square design. Treatments were diets with 1) no fat added, 2) 30 g fat/kg feed (calcium salts of long-chain fatty acids as fat supplement), 3) 60 g fat/kg, and 4) 90 g fat/kg added. Cows were fed once daily a diet of concentrate, corn silage, alfalfa haylage, and alfalfa pellets. Dry matter intake decreased linearly with increasing concentrations of dietary fat (P < 0.0001). Overall plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids (P < 0.0001), triacylglycerol (P < 0.0006), and cholecystokinin (P < 0.02), increased linearly with each level of dietary fat, but there was a linear decrease in plasma insulin (P < 0.0008). In Experiment 2, 4 nonpregnant and nonlactating Holstein heifers were used in a cross-over design in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Treatments were diet (fatty acids, 27 g/kg vs 103 g/kg diet dry matter) and i.v. injections (MK-329 vs vehicle). Heifers were fed once daily a total mixed ration of corn silage, cracked corn and soybean meal with or without fat supplement. Diets were switched by period and either MK-329 (70 microg/kg body weight) or its vehicle was injected i.v. at 2 hr postfeeding. Daily dry matter intake was decreased by feeding the high fat diet (P < 0.02) but was not affected by injections. Injection of MK-329, however, increased dry matter intake by 92% in heifers fed the high fat diet during the first 2 hr postinjection compared to vehicle injection. Plasma pancreatic polypeptide concentration was increased by the high fat diet at 2 hr postfeeding (P < 0.02) but was lowered by MK-329 at 1 hr postinjection (P < 0.001). Plasma insulin was lowered by the high fat diet (P < 0.01) but was not affected by injections. The elevated plasma cholecystokinin concentration may have mediated depressed feed intake of dairy cattle fed the high fat diets.", 
    "119": "The ability of the GABA(A)-receptor-subtype-selective hypnotic zaleplon to produce physical dependence was compared to the nonselective benzodiazepine triazolam. Progressively increasing doses of zaleplon and triazolam were given to baboons by intragastric infusion once each day, with doses increasing every 17 days. Next, the highest dose was given for 10-34 additional days by continuous infusion. Both drugs produced increases in food-maintained lever pressing, ataxia, and time to complete a fine motor task. Plasma levels increased dose-dependently; drug was detectable 24 h after higher doses. Flumazenil produced a mild or intermediate precipitated-withdrawal syndrome on day 14 of all dosing conditions. When drug delivery ended after 85-100 days, a benzodiazepine-type withdrawal syndrome occurred. Physical dependence potential of zaleplon and triazolam appear similar.", 
    "120": "Zaleplon is a chemically novel hypnotic that preferentially binds alpha(1)-subunit containing subtypes of the alphabetagamma configuration of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptor. Zaleplon and the non-subtype-selective hypnotic triazolam occasioned 100% drug-appropriate responding in baboons trained to discriminate lorazepam or pentobarbital from vehicle. Flumazenil shifted the zaleplon generalization gradient at least five-fold to the right. A plasma elimination half-life of 6-8 h for oral 10 mg/kg zaleplon and 0.32 mg/kg triazolam was paralleled by discriminative control for 7 h. Zaleplon maintained self-injection greater than vehicle, as did comparison doses of the similarly selective hypnotic zolpidem and triazolam. Concurrent food-maintained responding increased during self-injection of all three drugs. Preferential binding at this alpha(1)-containing GABA(A) subtype did not diminish the benzodiazepine (Bzs)-like behavioral effects of zaleplon.", 
    "121": "Event-related potentials (ERPs) from the auditory system were investigated in 28 post-operative cardiac patients in order to assess their relevance in the monitoring of patient sedation level. Midazolam (17 patients) and propofol (11 patients) were the sedative agents used. The auditory ERP components of N100 (HAB100) and mismatch negativity (MMN) were considered. A single sweep method based on the AutoRegressive with eXogenous input (ARX) model, which is able to enhance the evoked responses to each single stimulus, was used to process each sweep and to compute traditional parameters on a sweep-by-sweep basis. Differences in the measured parameters were related to variations in the patient sedation levels classified through Ramsay score. Significant differences (P<0.05) in both MMN and HAB100 parameters were found between light sedation (LS) and deep sedation (DS) levels.", 
    "122": "Child abuse is associated with markedly elevated rates of major depression and other psychiatric disorders in adulthood. This article reviews preclinical studies examining the effects of early stress, factors that modify the impact of these experiences, and neurobiological changes associated with major depression. Preclinical studies demonstrate that early stress can alter the development of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic corticotropin releasing hormone, monoaminergic, and gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine systems. Stress has also been shown to promote structural and functional alterations in brain regions similar to those seen in adults with depression. Emerging data suggest, however, that the long-term effects of early stress can be moderated by genetic factors and the quality of the subsequent caregiving environment. These effects also can be prevented or reversed with various pharmacologic interventions. Preclinical studies of early stress can provide valuable insights in understanding the pathophysiology and treatment of major depression. They also can provide an important tool to use to investigate interactions between genes and environments in determining an individual's sensitivity to stress. More research is needed to understand how inherent factors interact with experiences of abuse and other psychosocial factors to confer vulnerability to develop depression.", 
    "123": "Studies of the hippocampus as a target of stress and stress hormones have revealed a considerable degree of structural plasticity in the adult brain. Repeated stress causes shortening and debranching of dendrites in the CA3 region of the hippocampus and suppresses neurogenesis of dentate gyrus granule neurons. Both forms of structural remodeling of the hippocampus appear to be reversible and are mediated by glucocorticoid hormones working in concert with excitatory amino acids (EAA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, along with transmitters such as serotonin and the GABA-benzodiazepine system. Glucocorticoids, EAA, and NMDA receptors are also involved in neuronal damage and death that is caused in pyramidal neurons by seizures and by ischemia. A similar mechanism may be involved in hippocampal damage caused by severe and prolonged psychosocial stress. Studies using magnetic resonance imaging have shown that there is a selective atrophy of the human hippocampus in a number of psychiatric disorders, as well as during aging in some individuals, accompanied by deficits in declarative, spatial, and contextual memory performance. It is therefore important to appreciate how hippocampal dysfunction may play a role in the symptoms of the psychiatric illness and, from a therapeutic standpoint, to distinguish between a permanent loss of cells and a reversible remodeling to develop treatment strategies to prevent or reverse deficits. Remodeling of the hippocampus may be only the tip of the iceberg; other brain regions may also be affected.", 
    "124": "A few studies have tried antipsychotic augmentation in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients who are non-responders to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of olanzapine addition to fluvoxamine-refractory OCD patients and to assess if a comorbid chronic tic disorder or a concomitant schizotypal personality disorder was associated with response. Twenty-three OCD non-responders to a 6-month, open-label trial with fluvoxamine (300 mg/day) entered a 3-month open-label trial of augmentation with olanzapine (5 mg/day). OC symptom change was measured with the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. Differences between responders and non-responders were assessed with regard to age, sex, duration of illness, baseline Y-BOCS score, and comorbidity with chronic tic disorders or schizotypal personality disorder. A significant decrease of mean Y-BOCS score between pre- and post-treatment (26. 8+/-3.0 vs. 18.9+/-5.9) was found at endpoint. Ten patients (43.5%) were rated as responders. The most common side effects were mild to moderate weight gain and sedation. In our sample, three patients (13. 04%) had a chronic motor tic disorder, and four (17.39%) had a codiagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder. Concomitant schizotypal personality disorder was the only factor significantly associated with response. It appears that augmentation of olanzapine in fluvoxamine-refractory OCD may be effective in a large number of patients, including those with comorbid schizotypal personality disorder.",

    "129": "Piracetam [2-oxo-1-pyrrolidineacetamide], a cyclic GABA, has been used in Europe for the treatment of patients with cognitive disorders. We investigated the effect of piracetam on urea-induced myoclonus in rats. Myoclonus was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 4.5 g/kg urea, and was recorded with EMG and video apparatus. The incidence of induced myoclonus decreased significantly by intraperitoneal injection of 300 mg/kg piracetam and oral administration of 0.3-10 mg/kg clonazepam. Furthermore, the combined application of 100 mg/kg piracetam and 0.03-0.1 mg/kg clonazepam was effective in ameliorating the myoclonus, although separate administrations were not effective. These findings suggest that piracetam is an effective drug for treating myoclonus, particularly when it is used in combination with clonazepam.", 
    "130": "The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) expression and localization correlate with human breast cancer cell proliferation and aggressive phenotype expression. The standardized extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves (EGb 761) and isolated ginkgolide B (GKB) were shown to decrease PBR mRNA expression in adrenal cells. We examined the effect of EGb 761 and GKB on PBR expression and cell proliferation in human breast cancer cells. EGb 761 and GKB decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner PBR expression and cell proliferation in the highly aggressive, rich in PBR, human breast cancer cell line MDA-231 whereas they did not affect the proliferation of the non-aggressive human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, which contains very low PBR levels. This effect was reversible and not due to the antioxidant properties of the compounds tested. Using a human cDNA expression array we determined that EGb 761 treatment altered, in addition to PBR, the expression of 36 gene products involved in various pathways regulating cell proliferation. These in vitro data were further validated in an in vivo model where EGb 761 and GKB significantly inhibited the nuclear PBR expression and growth of MDA-231 cell xenografts in nude mice. Taken together, these data suggest that the manipulation of PBR expression could be used to control tumor growth and that EGb 761 and GKB, under the conditions used, exert cytostatic properties.",

Inhibition of platelet function is now emphasised more than ever for prevention and treatment of almost all vascular diseases, since thrombosis is established as the key pathogenic event causing acute ischaemic coronary and cerebrovascular syndromes. Although acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) has been shown to reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke, its effect is weak and more effective antithrombotic agents are required to manage patients at high-risk for recurrent vascular events. Platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor (GPIIb/IIIa) blockade represents a significant advance in interventional cardiology and treatment of acute ischaemic syndromes. The past several years have seen the introduction of many platelet GPIIb/IIIa blockers into the clinical arena targeting the unique platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor for the adhesive proteins, fibrinogen and von Willebrand Factor. Platelet GPIIb/IIIa blockers administered intravenously have proven efficacious in mitigating arterial thrombosis in acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction) and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) such as balloon dilatation and stent implantation. Currently, orally-active platelet GPIIb/IIIa blockers are being developed to provide additional benefits for primary and secondary prevention of thrombosis as chronic treatment, especially in high-risk patients. Lotrafiban (SmithKline Beecham) is a member of the latest generation of orally-active platelet GPIIb/IIIa blockers undergoing Phase III clinical trials to test the relative effectiveness versus other oral platelet inhibitors for ischaemic conditions including unstable angina, restenosis after PCI and stroke. Lotrafiban is converted from an esterified prodrug by plasma and liver esterases to a peptidomimetic of the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid amino acid sequence. This sequence itself mimics the binding site of fibrinogen and von Willebrand Factor to the platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor. Preliminary results of the clinical trial APLAUD (antiplatelet useful dose) show that lotrafiban is clinically safe and well-tolerated in patients with recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, transient ischaemic attack (TIA), or stroke when added to aspirin therapy. With lotrafiban, a worldwide large-scale Phase III clinical trial BRAVO (blockage of the GPIIb/IIIa receptor to avoid vascular occlusion) is currently underway. In general, GPIIb/IIIa blockade seems clinically very promising. A number of unresolved issues, however, remain to be elucidated."
