Ten patients with sub-clinical or latent hepatic encephalopathy (LHE) and ten normal controls were cognitively assessed pre- and post-infusion of 0.2 mg of the benzodiazepine (BZ) antagonist flumazenil in a placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind design. Flumazenil infusion resulted in a significant improvement in simple reaction time in patients, but not in controls. Saline infusion had no effect on any of the cognitive measures in either group. Flumazenil appeared to have a particular enhancing effect on the cognitive, as opposed to the motor, component of the reaction time task. This finding supports the view that the benzodiazepine/GABA system is implicated in the bradyphrenia that is characteristic of chronic liver disease, even before hepatic encephalopathy is apparent. We conclude that benzodiazepine receptor antagonism may improve cognitive function, particularly speed of information processing, in patients with latent hepatic encephalopathy.", 
    "1": "3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or \"Ecstasy\") was first synthesised 80 years ago, but has recently received prominence as an illegally synthesised recreational drug of abuse. There is a widely held belief among misusers that it is safe. In the last 2-3 years there have been a number of reports of the drug producing severe acute toxicity and death and there are concerns that it may cause long term toxic damage to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) nerve terminals. There is a considerable literature on the acute pharmacological effects of MDMA in experimental animals, and this is reviewed. The drug produces both hyperthermia and the \"serotonin syndrome\", a series of behavioural changes which result from increased 5-HT function. Acute clinical toxicity problems following MDMA ingestion also include hyperthermia and the appearance of the serotonin syndrome. The hyperthermia appears to precipitate other severe clinical problems and the outcome can be fatal. In agreement with others, we suggest that the recent increase in the number of reports of MDMA toxicity probably results from the widespread use of the drug at all night dance parties or \"raves\". The phenomenon of amphetamine aggregation toxicity in mice was reported 40 years ago. If applicable to MDMA-induced toxicity in humans, all the conditions necessary to induce or enhance toxicity are present at raves: crowded conditions (aggregation), high ambient temperature, loud noise and dehydrated subjects. Administration of MDMA to rodents and non-human primates results in a long term neurotoxic decrease in 5-HT content in several brain regions and there is clear biochemical and histological evidence that this reflects neurodegeneration of 5-HT terminals. Unequivocal data demonstrating that similar changes occur in human brain do not exist, but limited and indirect clinical evidence gives grounds for concern. There are also data suggesting that long term psychiatric changes can occur, although there are problems of interpretation and these are reviewed. Suggestions for the rational treatment of the acute toxicity are made on the basis of both pharmacological studies in animals and current clinical practice. Cases presenting clinically are usually emergencies and unlikely to allow carefully controlled studies. Proposals include decreasing body temperature (possibly with ice), the use of dantrolene and anticonvulsant and sedative medication, particularly benzodiazepines. The use of neuroleptics requires care because of the theoretical risk of producing the neuroleptic malignant syndrome and the possibility of precipitating seizures. In rats, chlormethiazole antagonises the hyperthermia produced by MDMA and has been shown clinically to block MDMA-induced convulsive activity.", 
    "2": "In the treatment and therapy of patients suffering a stroke, it is very important to predict whether viable neurones, even those of poor function, remain intact in the lesions of the brain. To determine whether viable neurones of low functional activity are represented in in vivo neuroreceptor imaging, we undertook experiments in gerbils with cerebral infarction, in which we examined histological changes and the results of dual-tracer in vivo autoradiography of glucose utilization with 14C-labelled deoxyglucose and benzodiazepine receptor binding with 123I-labelled Ro 16-0154. The unrelated findings of cerebral glucose metabolism and benzodiazepine receptor binding were observed in the primary infarct lesion and in remote areas, including the ipsilateral striatum and thalamus. Our experiments showed that when viable neurones with low functional activity remain intact, normal in vivo binding to benzodiazepine receptors is demonstrated as hypometabolism of glucose utilization. This functional, contrast-enhanced technique with 123I-labelled Ro 16-0154 may have an important role to play in the prediction of neuronal cell viability after recent brain infarction in experimental animals and humans using single photon emission tomography (SPET).", 
    "3": "Brain death was diagnosed by analyzing drug distribution in human tissues. Concentrations of diazepam and phenobarbital in human tissues, administered therapeutically to 3 patients in a critical condition, were determined by gas chromatography with a nitrogen phosphorus detector and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In 2 patients administered drugs while the brain was functioning, drug concentrations in the brain were high compared with those in the other tissues. In the other patient given the drugs after vital signs of the brain ceased, the level of drugs in the brain was much lower than seen in other tissues. We propose that a forensic diagnosis of patients who are brain dead can be made by comparing the concentrations of drugs in the brain given at the time of critical condition with concentration of these agents in other tissues. When cerebral function ceased can be roughly estimated by the variable distribution patterns of drugs and time of administration of these drugs.", 
    "4": "The benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist RO 15-3505 was tested for its ability to improve impaired recent memory of aged mice. All mice successfully acquired a learning set for accurate identification of the correct arm of a T-maze and could perform with nearly 100% accuracy after 1-min delays. However, performance of the aged mice approached chance levels after 2-h delays. When injected just before testing on a series of 2-h retention tests, RO 15-3505 (from 2.5-3505 (from 2.5-10.0 mg/kg) resulted in a marked improvement of response accuracy. These results confirm the role of benzodiazepine receptor mechanisms in the modulation of memory processes, and suggest that the memory-facilitating effects RO 15-3505 or similar benzodiazepine receptor ligands may be generalized to aged rodents with impaired memory function.", 
    "5": "We studied the effect of copulation on GABA and benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors in the male mouse. After copulation, there was an 18% increase in the in vitro number of [3H]muscimol binding sites in frontal cortex. No changes were observed in central BZD binding sites labelled either in vivo by [3H]flunitrazepam or in vitro (in olfactory bulbs and in frontal cortex) by [3H]flumazenil, but further in vitro studies demonstrated that the GABA-stimulated [3H]flunitrazepam binding was reduced in both frontal cortex and olfactory bulbs. Copulation increased the number of peripheral BZD binding sites labelled by 3H-Ro 5-4864 in olfactory bulbs by 22% and in heart by 36%, but not in frontal cortex or in testes. The changes of GABA/BZD and peripheral BZD receptors in mouse suggest that the GABAergic system may be affected by copulation.", 
    "6": "The effects of conditioned fear stress (CFS) on 5-HT release in the medial prefrontal cortex were studied by in vivo microdialysis. CFS (exposure to an environment in which foot-shock had been delivered previously) induced a marked suppression of motility-that is, freezing behavior. The extracellular concentration of 5-HT in the medial prefrontal cortex increased during this freezing behavior, but no significant changes were observed in the concentration of its metabolite, 5-HIAA. The increased 5-HT concentration returned to pretreatment levels when the animals were returned to their home cages. Diazepam (0.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) reduced the CFS-induced freezing behavior and prevented the increases in extracellular 5-HT levels. A 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, tropisetron (10 and 100 micrograms/kg), also inhibited both the CFS-induced increase in 5-HT release and the freezing behavior. These findings suggest that there is a relationship between anxiety and 5-HT release in the prefrontal cortex and that the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist tropisetron might have anxiolytic properties.", 
    "7": "The effect of food palatability and duration of food deprivation on the modulation of food intake by two benzodiazepine receptor (BDZR) ligands, CGS 9896 and CGS 8216, were investigated. Three diets differing in palatability (high, medium, or standard) and three different periods of food deprivation (0, 16, or 24 h) were used in all combinations to compare the effect of these variations on the observed modulation of food consumption by both BDZR ligands. Increasing diet palatability and/or food deprivation increased the baseline food consumption and reduced the sensitivity of the test to the detection of the hyperphagic effect of CGS 9896 but increased the sensitivity to detect the anorexic effect of CGS 8216. Only for the intermediate conditions of food deprivation (16 h) and for a standard or medium palatable diet were both significant hyperphagic effect of CGS 9896 and anorexic effect of CGS 8216 detected. Neither increased palatability nor hunger enhanced the modulation of feeding, indicating that neither \"taste preference\" nor \"hunger\" is the key factor in the mechanism of BDZR ligand-induced feeding response.", 
    "8": "The purpose of the present study was to determine if chronic treatment with a nonsedative benzodiazepine partial agonist would confer tolerance to the rate-decreasing effects of other benzodiazepine ligands in a fixed-interval procedure in rats. A separate group of rats was treated chronically with the sedative benzodiazepine full agonist, chlordiazepoxide, for comparison. It was hypothesized that tolerance would develop rapidly to chlordiazepoxide due to loss of reinforcement density at rate-decreasing doses and that there would probably be cross-tolerance to other rate-decreasing benzodiazepine ligands such as midazolam and abecarnil. Because bretazenil does not produce rate decreases, however, it was not expected that tolerance would be found to chlordiazepoxide, midazolam, or abecarnil. After 8-12 weeks of chronic treatment with either chlordiazepoxide or bretazenil, however (final dose of benzodiazepine = 30 mg/kg/day), tolerance was found to the rate-decreasing effects of chlordiazepoxide, midazolam, and abecarnil in both groups. It is concluded that such tolerance was most likely due to a saturation of benzodiazepine receptors by this high-affinity partial agonist.", 
    "9": "In conflict paradigms, benzodiazepines (BZs) often exhibit maximal anticonflict effects only after three to four BZ exposures (anxiolytic initial subsensitivity; AIS). The present experiments examined 1) whether AIS occurs with non-BZ anxiolytics and 2) whether prior exposure to non-BZs prevents the occurrence of BZ AIS. Female rats were trained to stable responding levels on a repeated-measures punished drinking paradigm. In Experiment 1, dose-response curves for the effects of the BZs chlordiazepoxide and diazepam, the barbiturates (BBs) pentobarbital and amobarbital, and the non-BZ, non-BB agent carbamazepine were determined in five groups of rats (one group/drug); dose-response curves were determined on two occasions for each drug. There was an AIS with both BZs, with the anticonflict effect being significantly greater for dose-response determination #2. There was no AIS with the BBs (robust and dose-dependent increases in punished responding on both determinations) or with carbamazepine (weak anticonflict effect on both determinations). In Experiment 2, the rats from Experiment 1 received a single-dose challenge with chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg). This challenge resulted in a robust anticonflict effect in subjects with a history of repeated BZ treatment; in contrast, subjects with a history of repeated BB or carbamazepine treatment exhibited smaller anticonflict responses. These data suggest that 1) the AIS does not occur with non-BZ anxiolytics and 2) the BZ AIS cannot be prevented by repeated exposure to non-BZs.", 
    "10": "In previous studies in which the anti-pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) effect of benzodiazepines was used to measure tolerance, the results depended on the benzodiazepine used for chronic treatment as well as the benzodiazepine given acutely to test for tolerance. In this study, the time course of tolerance reversal was studied in rats given two treatments known to cause anticonvulsant tolerance, 1-week flurazepam (FZP), and 3-week diazepam (DZP). Neither treatment altered convulsive threshold for IV PTZ, but both treatments decreased the convulsive threshold for bicuculline. Withdrawing DZP, but not FZP, treatment resulted in a loss of body weight. Twelve hours after 1-week FZP treatment, all benzodiazepines were significantly less effective, showing tolerance. Forty-eight hours after the 1-week FZP treatment, tolerance was still observed with DZP, FZP, and zolpidem, but was no longer present with clonazepam or bretazenil. After the 3-week DZP treatment, rats were tolerant to all benzodiazepines tested at 12 h of withdrawal, but had lost tolerance to all the drugs except bretazenil by 48 h. The results suggest differences in the way these benzodiazepines interact with their receptors, allowing differential expression of tolerance, and that chronic DZP and FZP treatments affected interactions of the benzodiazepines with their receptors, but not in the same fashion.", 
    "11": "Effects of ethanol (EtOH, 0.65 + 0.35 g.kg-1), diazepam (DZ, 15 and 30 mg), lorazepam (LZ, 2 mg) on divided attention were measured in two placebo-controlled crossover studies with healthy young subjects. The test comprised four parallel computer screens with a ball moving along a circular obstacle course on each screen at different rates. When the ball entered an obstacle on any screen, the subject had to press the respective button. The obstacles varied in numbers and shapes, and randomly changed their location every 10 s. Concomitant aural stimuli were responded to by pushing the foot pedals. The primary visual variables were the absolute and percent numbers of correct responses on each screen. Concentrated attention was measured with a symbol digit substitution (SDST) and digit copying (DDCT) tests, for 3 min each. In Study I, with 12 subjects, the tests (4 min) were made before the treatment (placebo, EtOH, DZ) and 1, 3, and 6 h after intake. EtOH impaired attention on the lateral but not on medial screens, with and without aural stimuli, the \"special\" obstacles of deviating shape being the most sensitive targets to EtOH effects. DZ 15 mg did not modify divided attention whereas it impaired SDST performance and was subjectively slightly more potent than EtOH on visual analog scales. DZ 30 mg impaired attention on the lateral screens, with and without aural stimuli, but without preference to \"special\" obstacles. It also reduced responses to aural stimuli, strongly impaired SDST and DDCT, and caused subjective sedation. In Study II, with 9 subjects, the test run without aural stimuli was easier but lasted for 15 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "Tilivalline (1a), a metabolite isolated from Klebsiella pneumoniae var. oxytoca, belongs to a group of pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines, a characteristic skeleton of anthramycin-type antitumor antibiotics. We have accomplished a completely stereoselective, efficient and convenient synthesis of 1a utilizing a new Mannich type intramolecular cyclization as a key step. Further, a computational chemical analysis clarified the effect of zinc chloride on the high stereoselectivity in the tilivalline synthesis. To aim both the extension of the scope of the new Mannich type intramolecular cyclization and the studies on the structure-biological activity relationship, we further extended the method to the synthesis of tilivalline derivatives and 2-(3'-indolyl)-1,4-benzodiazepines (50). Investigation on the cytotoxicity of 1a and its analogs has revealed that 1a shows the strong cytotoxicity toward mouse leukemia L 1210 cells and the replacement of the indole function of 1a with cyano one increases the cytotoxicity of 1a about 100 times (IC50 = 0.05 microgram/ml).", 
    "13": "Injection of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) chlordiazepoxide (CDP) into the medial septum (MS) produced a dose-dependent retrograde working memory deficit in a delayed non-match-to-sample radial-arm maze task. CDP (30 nmol; 10 micrograms) decreased the number of correct choices and increased the number of errors without altering latency to make arm choices. The effects of CDP were site specific; injection into regions proximate to the MS, including the lateral septum, the anterior cingulate, and the nucleus basalis magnocellularis, did not affect any index of performance. The second experiment demonstrated that CDP impaired working memory only when rats were injected either 0 or 60 min, but not 15, 30, or 45 min, following training. The MS appears (a) to contribute to both early (encoding/ maintenance) and late (retrieval/utilization) phases of working memory and (b) to be a critical site of action for BDZ-induced deficits in spatial working memory.", 
    "14": "To divert from use of psychotropic drugs can take from of a classic toxicomania, sometimes isolated, frequently in association with other toxics: alcohol, opioids. Drugs frequently concerned are anxiolytics: benzodiazepines with a short half-life. Use during more than four months, dependent personality, are risk-factors. Among the other psychotropics, only certain stimulant antidepressants, like amineptine, justify of a particular attention. Drugs of which indication is not psychotropic can induce abuses: more than morphine itself, drugs including opioids or relating are in great demand by drug-addicts: antalgic like dextropropoxyphene or anticough like Neocodion, this one off the prescription. Anorectics, ephedrine vasoconstrictors and beta-stimulants abuse remains frequent.", 
    "15": "Drug addiction is a serious behavioral disorder. It is a long term evolving process characterized by dependency. It is not only biological and psychological but also social. It should be differentiated from occasional drug use, from drug abuse with minor consequences as well from medical drug dependency in which the individual does not seek a psychological effect. Drug addiction causes are multiple and include psychological, family, social and obviously biological factors (drug addicting potential). In to-day clinical practice, addiction to benzodiazepines or opioids prescribed for maintenance therapy and the newly described secondary addiction of later onset are predominant. Severe social consequences and many psychiatric and medical disorders in particular due to HIV infection also result from drug addiction. Depressive and psychotic disorders cause specific therapeutic problems when patients deny their troubles or when drug use produces special relief. These psychological disorders frequently underlie medical care needs.", 
    "16": "The purpose of this study was to determine if a pediatric sedation program improved head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan success rates and procedure duration times compared with the year preceding the program. Sedation was successful in 189 (85.1%) of 222 children before the program compared with 211 (98.1%) of 215 children during the program (P < 0.001). Mean procedure duration times for head MRI scans with and without contrast were shorter in the program compared with before the program (58.7 +/- 1.4 min versus 71.8 +/- 3.0 min, P < 0.001, and 46.7 +/- 1.2 min versus 58.5 +/- 1.9 minutes, P < 0.001, respectively). No major complications occurred during the 15-month period in the sedation program. We conclude that sedation for pediatric MRI, managed by an organized pediatric sedation program, is highly successful, efficient, and safe.", 
    "17": "Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist used to reverse sedation and respiratory depression induced by benzodiazepines. Seizures and cardiac arrhythmias have complicated its use in adult patients. Overdose patients who have coingested tricyclic antidepressants have a higher risk of these complications.

We report the occurrence of a generalized tonic-clonic seizure in a pediatric patient following the administration of flumazenil.", 
    "18": "GABA and GABAA receptors have been studied in the substantia nigra of the rat following quinolinic acid lesions in the striatum. The regional distribution of GABA and GABAA receptors was investigated using immunohistochemical techniques with monoclonal antibodies to GABA and to the beta 2.3 subtypes of the GABAA receptor complex. The distribution, density and cellular localization of GABAA receptors were studied using quantitative receptor autoradiography and 6-hydroxydopamine-induced degeneration of dopaminergic pars compacta neurons. The subunit configuration of GABAA receptors was investigated using in situ hybridization histochemistry and subunit subtype-specific oligonucleotide probes. The results showed that in the normal substantia nigra GABA and GABAA receptors were mainly localized within the pars reticulata. GABAA receptors were mainly of the BZI variety, had a subunit subtype configuration that included alpha 1 and beta 2.3 subtypes, and showed a rostrocaudal gradient in the density of receptors; the density of receptors in the caudal third was 56% higher than that in the rostral third of the pars reticulata. Following quinolinic acid-induced degeneration of the striatonigral pathway, there was a marked loss of GABA immunoreactivity and a 59% increase in the density of GABAA receptors in the substantia nigra pars reticulata. There was a corresponding regional topography in the pattern of loss of GABA immunoreactivity and in the pattern of increase in GABAA receptors in the pars reticulata; the topography varied with the size and placement of the lesion in the striatum and correlated with the known topographical organization of the striatonigral projection. The quantitative autoradiographic results showed that following quinolinic acid lesions in the striatum: (i) the greatest increase in the density of GABAA receptors occurred in the middle third (91% increase) of the pars reticulata; (ii) the receptors were mainly of the GABAA/BZI variety; and (iii) 6-hydroxydopamine-induced degeneration of the dopaminergic pars compacta neurons did not significantly affect the density of receptors, indicating that the increased receptor binding was mainly localized on non-dopaminergic pars reticulata neurons. The immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization studies showed that, as in the normal substantia nigra, GABAA receptors in the substantia nigra pars reticulata on the lesioned side contained the alpha 1 and beta 2.3 GABAA receptor subtypes; the alpha 1 and beta 2.3 subtypes (but not the alpha 2) were increased after quinolinic acid lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "19": "The effect of intraventricular administration of antiepileptic drugs on an experimental model of epileptic seizures in rats has been investigated. Animals were tested in the electroshock test measuring the time duration of the tonic phase of the convulsion. Drugs tested were sodium phenobarbital (200-500-1000 micrograms), phenytoin (50-100-200-500 micrograms), midazolam (100-200-500 micrograms) and sodium valproate (500-1000-2000 micrograms), delivered via a catheter stereotactically placed into the lateral ventricle. Control animals were tested with saline. All antiepileptic drugs showed different degrees of reduction in the duration of the tonic phase before reaching doses that produced neurological symptoms. Our results demonstrate the feasibility to control experimental seizures by means of intraventricular injection of antiepileptic drugs.",

All the compounds were evaluated for in vitro alpha(1) adrenoceptor affinity by radioligand receptor binding assays. The most active derivative in displacement of [3H]prazosin from rat cortical membranes was 1b (K(i) = 219 nM). At 1 microM concentration, compounds 1 and 2 had no effect on the benzodiazepine or 5-HT(1A) receptor. The biological activity profile of 1b makes it a possible lead compound for the design of new selective alpha1 adrenoceptor ligands.", 
    "21": "There are currently three recognized menstrual-related sleep disorders: premenstrual insomnia, menopausal insomnia and premenstrual hypersomnia. Another category, premenstrual parasomnia (sleep behavior disorder), is now suggested. Case 1, a 17-year-old female, presented with a 6-year history of exclusively premenstrual sleep terrors and injurious sleep-walking that began 1 year after menarche. During the four nights preceding each menses, she would scream and run from her bed. There was no history of premenstrual syndrome. Neurological evaluations had been unrevealing, apart from mild mental retardation and attention deficit disorder; there was no psychiatric history. Polysomnography 3 days before the onset of menses confirmed the diagnosis of sleep-walking. Pharmacotherapies were not satisfactory, but self-hypnosis at bedtime was rapidly effective with benefit sustained at 2.5-year follow-up. Case 2, a 46-year-old woman without psychiatric disorder, presented with a 5-year history of sleep terrors and injurious sleep-walking that initially was not menstrually related, but beginning 8 months prior to referral, she developed an exclusively premenstrual parasomnia that, after polysomnography, was partially controlled with bedtime self-hypnosis and clonazepam, 0.25 mg.", 
    "22": "11C-Flumazenil and 123I-iomazenil are PET and SPECT ligands that bind with high affinity and selectivity to central benzodiazepine receptors. These radiopharmaceuticals are highly suitable for the localization of epileptogenic foci in partial epilepsy. With 11C-flumazenil it is possible to localize epileptogenic foci more accurately than with 18FDG. This PET ligand is also superior to the SPECT ligand and therefore with its increased availability it will possibly become more important in the presurgical assessment of patients with medically intractable temporal and especially extratemporal lobe epilepsy. Due to the high amount of cortical GABAergic synapses, 11C-flumazenil and 123I-iomazenil seem suitable as markers for the integrity of neuronal structure. With the help of these ligands, functionally disturbed areas of the brain can be differentiated from structural changes in patients with cerebral infarcts, cortical dysplasias, traumatic brain lesions or systemic degeneration. Another potential field of clinical use could be the individual pharmacological monitoring of drugs interacting with the GABAA-receptor complex. Imaging of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor seems to be exclusively of scientific interest.", 
    "23": "In 31 adult patients who had undergone spinal or epidural anesthesia, we evaluated the effect of flumazenil in reversing midazolam, flunitrazepam or diazepam. The patients received midazolam 5 mg, flunitrazepam 1 mg or diazepam 5 mg 15 min after the spinal or epidural anesthesia. After the completion of operation, flumazenil (0.2 mg-1.0 mg) was administered until the patient became awake. Blood pressure, pulse rate and respiratory rate before and after administration of flumazenil showed no statistically significant changes in these groups. There were no significant differences in necessary amount of flumazenil among these groups. The time necessary for the patient to be awake in midazolam group was significantly shorter than that in flunitrazepam or diazepam group. Half of the patients in flunitrazepam and diazepam groups slept again after leaving the operating room, but they presented no clinical problems. In conclusion, we consider that flumazenil does not affect circulation and respiration, so it seems to be safe and effective for reversing benzodiazepins in clinical situation.", 
    "24": "This study was designed to determine whether differences in alpha-1 acid glycoprotein and free drug concentrations result in an altered response to triazolam. Twelve normal-weight and 12 obese adult male subjects received intravenous doses of triazolam, 0.5 mg, on two occasions separated by 1 week. There was a small difference in the alpha-1 acid glycoprotein concentrations between groups but no difference in free fraction of triazolam. There was a longer terminal half-life (t1/2 beta) in the obese subjects (3.16 +/- 0.87 vs. 3.83 +/- 1.24, p = 0.0098). Overall, week 1 data revealed no difference in effect between normal and obese subjects. However, response data reveal a pattern of increased sensitivity with the second exposure to triazolam. For example, area under the effect curve (AUEC) on all tests was significantly greater in week 2 for both groups of subjects. For a memory test and sedation from 0 to 12 hours, AUEC/free AUC ratios were significantly greater in week 2 for all subjects. The obese had a higher ratio on week 2 than on week 1 for all psychomotor tests and sedation (0 to 4.5 hours; p < 0.05). The results of modeling psychomotor impairment-concentration data pooled by group for each week continue the pattern: week 1 data are similar between the obese and normal-weight subjects. Although EC50 values are up to 15% lower in week 2 for the normal-weight subjects, EC50 values are as much as 66% lower in week 2 for the obese, where a lower EC50 indicates greater sensitivity. Logistic regression of the recognition data is consistent with these results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "Evidence of time-dependent sensitization (TDS) to triazolam was observed in three separate clinical studies. Study 1 was conducted in 12 normal-weight and 12 obese men; an intravenous bolus dose of triazolam, 0.5 mg, was administered on two occasions. Study 2 was a balanced crossover of three 0.25-mg oral doses and one 0.20-mg oral dose of triazolam in 11 men. Study 3 was a balanced crossover of one placebo, one 0.5-mg, and two 0.4-mg oral doses of triazolam. In all three studies, treatments were separated by 6 days and included serial blood sampling for characterization of pharmacokinetics. Psychomotor response was assessed with the Digit Symbol Substitution Test and the Continuous Performance Test (CPT). Sedation was rated by an observer. For each measure, an effect ratio was calculated as the area under the effect curve divided by the area under the triazolam concentration curve; this parameter relates the extent of response relative to drug concentration in plasma. Effect ratios increased progressively by week for CPT; the percentage increase ranged from 31.9% in the study 1 normal subjects (week 1 to week 2; p = 0.08) to 631% in study 2 (week 1 to week 4; p = 0.0013). Similar increases were observed for other responses. Overall, the effect ratio data demonstrate increasing responsiveness per unit of triazolam concentration when triazolam was administered as a single dose at 1-week intervals. This observation was incidental to the original objectives of the studies. However, the data suggest that definitive studies to verify the occurrence of this phenomenon need to be conducted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "Seventy five ASA 1 and 2 children, aged between six months and five years were randomized to receive oral midazolam 0.5 mg.kg-1, rectal thiopentone 35 mg.kg-1 or no premedication to compare the safety and efficacy of, and parental attitudes to, both premedicants. Cardio-respiratory variables were from the time of premedication to awakening from anaesthesia. In addition, anxiety and sedation scores and patients' acceptance of both premedicant and mask at induction, were all recorded using four-point rating scales. Times to recovery and discharge, and parental satisfaction with the premedication their child had received were also recorded. Children receiving rectal thiopentone had higher sedation scores and were more accepting of the mask than were the other two groups (P < 0.001). Their acceptance of the premedication was similar to that of the midazolam group. Times to spontaneous eye opening and discharge were longer in the thiopentone group (P < 0.005). Parental preoperative satisfaction rating was higher for thiopentone, but not midazolam, than no premedication (P < 0.05). When asked their premedication preferences for subsequent general anaesthetics, a higher proportion of parents whose children were not premedicated requested an alternative regimen (P < 0.01). In conclusion the study found that premedication with rectal thiopentone provided superior induction characteristics to oral midazolam, but with a longer recovery period.", 
    "27": "Benzodiazepines affect steroidogenesis in at least four ways depending on concentration and adrenocortical cell type. Firstly, at micromolar concentrations, they inhibit steroidogenic enzymes. Competition for microsomal 17- and 21-hydroxylase activity explains the inhibition of ACTH-stimulated aldosterone and cortisol synthesis by diazepam and midazolam. At slightly higher concentrations, we have evidence that 11 beta-hydroxylase activity is also inhibited. Secondly, at sub-micromolar concentrations, calcium influx is inhibited. T-type and L-type calcium channels appear to be blocked, this impairs signal response coupling and, in particular, decreases angiotensin- and K(+)-stimulated aldosterone synthesis in zona glomerulosa cells. Thirdly, the mitochondrion of steroidogenic tissues is a sensitive site for the stimulatory effects of benzodiazepines. Aldosterone synthesis from added HDL-cholesterol by cultured bovine zona glomerulosa cells is stimulated by diazepam, RO5-4864 and PK11195. The fourth site of benzodiazepine's effect on steroidogenesis is particular to zona glomerulosa cells. In addition to cholesterol side chain cleavage, the final part of the aldosterone biosynthetic pathway, the conversion from deoxycorticosterone is controlled. Although high micromolar concentrations of diazepam appear to be inhibitory, lower nanomolar concentrations stimulate the synthesis of aldosterone from added deoxycorticosterone. In vivo, a fifth site of benzodiazepine activity may influence plasma steroid concentrations. Competition between steroids and benzodiazepines for hepatic clearance enzymes may affect half lives of both drugs and hormones.", 
    "28": "Steroidogenesis begins with the metabolism of cholesterol to pregnenolone by the inner mitochondrial membrane cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage (P450scc) enzyme. The rate of steroid formation, however, depends on the rate of (i) cholesterol transport from intracellular stores to the inner mitochondrial membrane and (ii) loading of P450scc with cholesterol. We demonstrated that a key element in the regulation of cholesterol transport is the mitochondrial peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) and that the presence of the polypeptide diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) was vital for steroidogenesis. We also showed that DBI, as the endogenous PBR ligand, stimulates cholesterol transport. In addition, DBI directly promotes loading of cholesterol to P450scc. We review herein our studies on the structure, function, topography and hormonal regulation of PBR and DBI in steroidogenic cells. Based on these data we propose a model where the interaction of DBI with PBR, at the outer/inner membrane contact sites, is the signal transducer of hormone-stimulated and constitutive steroidogenesis at the mitochondrial level. Hormone-induced changes in PBR microenvironment/structure regulate the affinity of the receptor. PBR ligand binding to a higher affinity receptor results in increased cholesterol transport. In addition, hormone-induced release (processing?) of a 30,000 Mw DBI-immunoreactive protein from the inner mitochondrial membrane may result to the intramitochondrial production of DBI which directly stimulates loading of P450scc with cholesterol. Thus, in vivo, hormonal activation of these two mechanisms results in efficient cholesterol delivery and utilization and thus high levels of steroid synthesis.",

    "30": "Tremor is commonly encountered in medical practice, but can be difficult to diagnose and manage. It is an involuntary rhythmic oscillation of a body part produced by reciprocally innervated antagonist muscles. Tremors vary in frequency and amplitude and are influenced by physiologic and psychological factors and drugs. Categorization is based on position, posture, and the movement necessary to elicit the tremor. A resting tremor occurs when the body part is in repose. A postural tremor occurs with maintained posture and kinetic tremor with movement. Various pathologic conditions are associated with tremors. Essential tremor, which is the most common, is postural and kinetic, with a frequency between 4 and 8 Hz, and involves mainly the upper extremities and head. Essential tremor responds to treatment with primidone, beta-blockers, and benzodiazepines. Parkinson's disease causes a 4- to 6-Hz resting tremor in the arms and legs that responds to the use of anticholinergics and a combination of carbidopa and levodopa. Tremor can also be a manifestation of Wilson's disease, lesions of the cerebellum and midbrain, peripheral neuropathy, trauma, alcohol, and conversion disorders. Treatment should be directed to the underlying condition. Stereotactic thalamotomy of thalamic stimulation is a last resort.", 
    "31": "The dried flower heads of Matricaria recutita L. (Asteraceae) are used in folk medicine to prepare a spasmolytic and sedative tea. Our fractionation of the aqueous extract of this plant led to the detection of several fractions with significant affinity for the central benzodiazepine receptor and to the isolation and identification of 5,7,4'-trihydroxyflavone (apigenin) in one of them. Apigenin competitively inhibited the binding of flunitrazepam with a Ki of 4 microM and had no effect on muscarinic receptors, alpha 1-adrenoceptors, and on the binding of muscimol to GABAA receptors. Apigenin had a clear anxiolytic activity in mice in the elevated plusmaze without evidencing sedation or muscle relaxant effects at doses similar to those used for classical benzodiazepines and no anticonvulsant action was detected. However, a 10-fold increase in dosage produced a mild sedative effect since a 26% reduction in ambulatory locomotor activity and a 35% decrement in hole-board parameters were evident. The results reported in this paper demonstrate that apigenin is a ligand for the central benzodiazepine receptors exerting anxiolytic and slight sedative effects but not being anticonvulsant or myorelaxant.", 
    "32": "Helicobacter pylori is present worldwide but few large population studies exist on the epidemiology of the infection. A random cross sectional study was performed of H pylori infection in the adult population of San Marino, a European country with high gastric cancer rate, to assess its prevalence and to evaluate its relations with gastrointestinal disease. In 2237 subjects (77% of the initial sample) H pylori IgG antibodies were detected with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting. A questionnaire including questions about occupation, place of birth, and smoking was given to all subjects. Dyspepsia, peptic ulcer, and gastric cancer in the subjects, relatives, and partners as well as use of drug, dental treatment/prostheses, and gastrointestinal endoscopies, were evaluated by multivariate analysis. H pylori prevalence was of 51%, increased with age from 23% (20-29 years) to 68% (> or = 70 years), and was higher among manual workers. H pylori was independently associated with ulcer (OR = 1.63, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 1.16 to 2.27), H2 antagonists (OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.21 to 3.10), and benzodiazepines (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.02 to 2.42), dental prostheses (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.49), gastroscopy in the past five years (OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.05 to 2.14), peptic ulcer in siblings (OR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.09 to 2.12), gastric cancer in father (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.02 to 2.52). The association of seropositivity with history of ulcer, gastric cancer in family, gastroscopy, and H2 antagonists suggests that H pylori is an epidemiological key factor in the pathogenesis of gastroduodenal diseases in this area.",

    "37": "Cholinergic mechanisms are known to play a key role in the regulation of breathing, but the distribution of muscarinic receptor (mAChR) subtypes has not been localized within brain stem respiratory nuclei. This study examined the hypothesis that mAChR subtypes are heterogeneously distributed across brain stem nuclei that control breathing. With the use of in vitro receptor autoradiography, the results provide the first selective labeling and quantitative mapping of M1, M2, and M3 mAChR subtypes in cat brain stem regions known to regulate breathing. Among brain stem nuclei known to contain respiratory-related neurons, the greatest amount of mAChR binding was measured in the lateral and medial parabrachial nuclei and the lateral nucleus of the solitary tract. Fewer mAChRs were localized in nuclei comprising the ventral respiratory group (nucleus ambiguous, retrofacial nucleus) and ventral medulla (retrotrapezoid nucleus and ventrolateral medulla). The data provide an essential first step for future studies aiming to specify the regulatory role of mAChR subtypes within brain stem respiratory nuclei.", 
    "38": "Fundamental studies in laboratory animals show that certain drugs influence behavioural recovery after brain injury. Although some drugs have the potential to enhance recovery, others may be detrimental. The purpose of the present study was to determine how often these potentially detrimental drugs are used in the management of patients with traumatic brain injury. The medical records of 100 patients with head trauma admitted to a university hospital during one year were reviewed and the frequencies of medication prescriptions during the stay in hospital were recorded. Only 14% of patients with head injury were taking medications at the time of injury. All of the patients were prescribed medications during their stay in hospital. Seventy two per cent of the patients received one or a combination of the drugs (neuroleptics and other central dopamine receptor antagonists, benzodiazepines, and the anticonvulsants phenytoin and phenobarbitone) that animal studies suggest may impair recovery. Until the true impact of these classes of drugs on the recovery process is better understood, care should be exercised in their use.", 
    "39": "We report here that carbamazepine and phenytoin, two widely used antiepileptic drugs, potentiate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced Cl- currents in human embryonic kidney cells transiently expressing the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 subtype of the GABAA receptor and in cultured rat cortical neurons. In cortical neuron recordings, the current induced by 1 microM GABA was enhanced by carbamazepine and phenytoin with EC50 values of 24.5 nM and 19.6 nM and maximal potentiations of 45.6% and 90%, respectively. The potentiation by these compounds was dependent upon the concentration of GABA, suggesting an allosteric modulation of the receptor, but was not antagonized by the benzodiazepine (omega) modulatory site antagonist flumazenil. Carbamazepine and phenytoin did not modify GABA-induced currents in human embryonic kidney cells transiently expressing binary alpha 1 beta 2 recombinant GABAA receptors. The alpha 1 beta 2 recombinant is known to possess functional barbiturate, steroid, and picrotoxin sites, indicating that these sites are not involved in the modulatory effects of carbamazepine and phenytoin. When tested in cells containing recombinant alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2, alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 2, or alpha 5 beta 2 gamma 2 GABAA receptors, carbamazepine and phenytoin potentiated the GABA-induced current only in those cells expressing the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 receptor subtype. This indicates that the nature of the alpha subunit isoform plays a critical role in determining the carbamazepine/phenytoin pharmacophore. Our results therefore illustrate the existence of one or more new allosteric regulatory sites for carbamazepine and phenytoin on the GABAA receptor. These sites could be implicated in the known anticonvulsant properties of these drugs and thus may offer new targets in the search for novel antiepileptic drugs.",

To determine whether substance users (SUs) differed from controls, 398 burn patients were studied, of whom, 161 had a positive drug screen for either ethanol, cannabinoids, cocaine metabolites, amphetamines, phencyclidine, or benzodiazepines. SUs versus controls showed no difference in age, but had a significantly greater percentage of total burn surface area (TBSA) (25 vs. 17%), inhalation injury (29 vs. 7%), and mortality (14 vs. 3%). The alcohol users (AUs) and drug users (DUs) were similar in relation to sex, age, inhalation injury, percentage of TBSA, and type of burn. DU patients experienced the same increase in inhalation injury as the AU group compared to controls. The mortality of AU patients was twice that of DU patients and six times that of controls. The best independent predictors of death were age, inhalation injury, percentage of TBSA (p < 0.001), and ethanol use (p < 0.02).", 
    "41": "Repeated administration of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, 30 mg/kg, thrice a week) to mice for 9 weeks and subsequent challenge of the animals with the same dose of PTZ on the last chronic dose produced chemical kindling. The mice showed myoclonic jerks, clonus, Straub's tail, falling back response and full blown convulsions. The anticonvulsant profile of chronic administration of BR-16A (100 and 500 mg/kg) was studied in this model of epilepsy. BR-16A offered protection against PTZ-induced chemical kindling. The per cent animals showing myoclonic jerks and clonus was reduced to 40 and 34 with 100 mg/kg and 54 and 27 with 500 mg/kg of BR-16A, respectively. The protective effect was compared with diazepam (1 mg/kg, ip). The results demonstrated GABAA receptor mediated PTZ-induced kindling and protective effect of BR-16A therein.",

After screening for recent benzodiazepine use or non-hepatic causes of encephalopathy, 18 patients entered a double-blind cross-over study. The 13 remaining patients, most of them with renal failure or recent use of benzodiazepines, were given flumazenil in an open study. In the controlled study, flumazenil (1.0 mg) or placebo was given in a single injection on two separate days to study the immediate effect; half the patients received a continuous infusion of flumazenil (0.25 mg/h) or placebo for two 3-day periods to study a potential steady state effect. In the open study, a single bolus of flumazenil (1.0 mg) was given.",

However, the EEG grade did not change in any of the patients, and the changes in the mean dominant frequency as measured by spectral analysis did not differ between flumazenil and the placebo. Furthermore, patients on flumazenil did not differ significantly from those on placebo during the infusion period. Subgroup analysis of underlying liver disease and the causes of encephalopathy revealed a trend for clinical improvement only in the patients with chronic liver disease, but without significant changes in the mean dominant frequency. In the open study, the clinical grade of encephalopathy decreased in 3 patients and, in contrast to the controlled study, the EEG also improved in 2 patients and the mean dominant frequency increased significantly.

    "45": "Changes in GABAA receptor function were studied in pentobarbital (PB)-dependent rats. Physical dependence on PB in male Lewis rats was induced by the drug-admixed food method. The 36Cl- influx into cerebral cortical synaptoneurosomes induced by 10 microM GABA in the PB-dependent rat was significantly decreased compared with the control. The enhancement of GABA-dependent 36Cl- influx by the addition of PB, ethanol (EtOH) and flunitrazepam (FZ) was not recognized in the PB-dependent group. The addition of picrotoxin and bicuculline had no effect on GABA-dependent 36Cl- influx in PB-dependent rats. In the [3H]muscimol binding assay of low affinity sites of the GABAA receptor, Kd was significantly increased and Bmax was significantly decreased in PB-dependent rats compared with the control. However, these values were similar between PB-dependent and control rats in the study of [3H]FZ binding to benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors. The present study indicates that GABAergic transmission involving GABA-dependent chloride channels was altered in PB dependent rats. This alteration of the GABAA/BZ/chloride channel complex function may be related to the cross-tolerance among barbiturates, BZ and EtOH.", 
    "46": "Synaptoneurosomes are entities in which a presynaptic sac (synaptosome) is attached to a resealed postsynaptic vesicle (neurosome). Biochemical studies have demonstrated that the synaptoneurosomes retain several receptor-mediated activities such as accumulations of cyclic AMP and ion fluxes. GABAA receptor-mediated 36Cl- uptake and modulatory effects of the uptake by benzodiazepines, barbiturates and neurosteroids have been reported in rat brain synaptoneurosomes. The in vitro protocol of the GABAA receptor ligand-stimulated 36Cl- influx proves to be of value for the screening of new compounds such as anxiolytics.", 
    "47": "1. The functional antagonism between methacholine- or histamine-induced contraction and beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation was evaluated in bovine tracheal smooth muscle in vitro. In addition, the putative contribution of muscarinic M2 receptors mediating inhibition of beta-adrenoceptor-induced biochemical responses to this functional antagonism was investigated with the selective muscarinic antagonists, pirenzepine (M1 over M2), AF-DX 116 and gallamine (M2 over M3), and hexahydrosiladiphenidol (M3 over M2). 2. By use of isotonic tension measurement, contractions were induced with various concentrations of methacholine or histamine, and isoprenaline concentration-relaxation curves were obtained in the absence or presence of the muscarinic antagonists. Antagonist concentrations were chosen so as to produce selective blockade of M2 receptors (AF-DX 116 0.1 microM, gallamine 30 microM), or half-maximal blockade of M3 receptors (pirenzepine 0.1 microM, AF-DX 116 0.5 microM, hexahydrosiladiphenidol 0.03 microM). Since these latter antagonist concentrations mimicked KB values towards bovine tracheal smooth muscle M3 receptors, antagonist-induced decreases in contractile tone were compensated for by doubling the agonist concentration. 3. It was found that isoprenaline-induced relaxation of bovine tracheal smooth muscle preparations was dependent on the nature and the concentration of the contractile agonist used. Thus, isoprenaline pD2 (-log EC50) values were decreased 3.7 log units as a result of increasing cholinergic tone from 22 to 106%, and 2.4 log units by increasing histamine tone over a similar range. Furthermore, maximal relaxability of cholinergic tone decreased gradually from 100% at low to only 1.3% at supramaximal contraction levels, whereas with histamine almost complete relaxation was maintained at all concentrations applied. As a result, isoprenaline relaxation was clearly hampered with methacholine compared to histamine at equal levels of contractile tone.4. In the presence of gallamine, isoprenaline relaxation was facilitated for most concentrations of methacholine, and for all concentrations of histamine. These changes could be explained by the decreased contraction levels for both contractile agonists in the presence of gallamine.5. Isoprenaline-induced relaxation of cholinergic contraction was also facilitated by AF-DX 116 as well as by pirenzepine and hexahydrosiladiphenidol, and these (small) changes were again related to the(small) decreases in cholinergic contraction levels that were present in these experiments despite the additional administration of the agonist to readjust contractile tone. Similarly, changes in isoprenaline relaxation of histamine-induced tone could be explained by different contraction levels.6. These results can be explained by the sole involvement of muscarinic M3 receptors, and provide no evidence for a role of muscarinic M2 receptors in functional antagonism in bovine trachea. Furthermore,they stress the importance of taking into account non-cholinergic controls as well as contraction levels in these experiments.", 
    "48": "1. The cardiovascular actions of cholecystokinin and related peptides were investigated in the pithed rat. The receptors and the mechanisms involved in these experiments were characterized. 2. Sulphated cholecystokinin octapeptide (sCCK-8, 0.1-100 nmol kg-1, i.v.) elicited a dose-dependent bradycardia and increase in mean arterial blood pressure. Neither gastrin-17 nor pentagastrin had any effect at concentrations up to 100 nmol kg-1. 3. Both the pressor response and bradycardia elicited by sCCK-8 were reduced by the selective CCKA receptor antagonists, devazepide (0.5-50 nmol kg-1) and lorglumide (1-7 mumol kg-1). The selective CCKB receptor antagonists, CI-988 (1 mumol kg-1) and L-365,260 (15 mumol kg-1) did not inhibit the effects of sCCK-8. 4. The pressor response induced with sCCK-8 was reduced by treatment with either phentolamine (3 mumol kg-1) or guanethidine (2 mumol kg-1) and was unaffected by treatment with propranolol, atropine or hexamethonium. The pressor response also persisted following bilateral adrenalectomy. 5. The bradycardia induced with sCCK-8 was unaffected by treatment with phentolamine, propranolol, guanethidine, atropine, hexamethonium or bilateral adrenalectomy. 6. The tetrapeptide of cholecystokinin (CCK-4) elicited a dose-dependent pressor response but did not induce bradycardia. The pressor response was unaffected by devazepide (50 nmol kg-1), L-365260 (15 mumol kg-1) or phentolamine (3 mumol kg-1). 7. In the pithed rat, sCCK-8 acted via CCKA receptors to increase arterial blood pressure indirectly, at least in part, through activation of alpha-adrenoceptors. The observed bradycardia was also mediated byCCKA receptors but possibly through a direct action on the heart.", 
    "49": "Interaction between azithromycin and midazolam was investigated in a double-blind, randomized crossover study of 2 phases. Ten healthy volunteers were given azithromycin (500 mg on day 1 and 250 mg on days 2-5) or placebo pretreatments. On day 5 they ingested 15 mg midazolam. Plasma samples were collected and psychomotor performance measured for 17 h. Azithromycin treatment increased the median (range) concentration peak time of midazolam from 1.0 (0.5-2) h to 1.25 (0.5-5) h and decreased plasma concentrations of midazolam during initial 3 hours after the intake of midazolam (p < 0.05). Mean +/- SE mean peak concentration of midazolam was decreased from 86 +/- 17 ng ml-1 to 57 +/- 9 ng ml-1 (p < 0.05). Azithromycin did neither increase the total area under concentration-time curve nor change the elimination half-life of midazolam. In Maddox wing test the maximum effects of midazolam were reached later during azithromycin phase, but no other changes were observed in pharmacodynamics of midazolam. Azithromycin may delay the absorption of midazolam, which can postpone the onset of action of midazolam.",

    "51": "The fine subcellular organization of the GABAA receptor complex in the adult rat spinal ventral horn was analysed by immunocytochemistry using a specific polyclonal antiserum raised against the gamma 2 subunit. This subunit confers benzodiazepine sensitivity on the chloride channel of the GABAA receptor. With both fluorescent and peroxidase staining, the immunoreactivity was mainly observed in the grey matter and more specifically in the dorsal and ventral horns on medium and large neurons. A high number of immunostained somata were clustered in regions corresponding to motor nuclei. On the neuronal surface, labelling appeared as fluorescent dots over the more diffuse staining that was present on the soma and proximal part of dendrites. At the ultrastructural level, peroxidase end product was in most cases associated with the internal side of postsynaptic differentiations facing terminal boutons enriched with pleiomorphic small clear vesicles. The positively stained synapses were encountered on proximal dendrites of neurons and throughout the neuropil of the ventral horn (layers VII-IX). An immunoreactivity on the postsynaptic membrane was occasionally found to decorate large pieces of membrane not directly apposed to presynaptic active zones. In addition, presynaptic labelling was observed at axoaxonic contacts and at extrasynaptic sites on membranes within boutons, sometimes themselves apposed to gamma 2 immunoreactivity. Finally, we also observed gamma 2 immunoreactivity at the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane of some glial elements. These results give morphological evidence for the involvement of GABAA receptors in both post- and presynaptic inhibition in the rat spinal ventral horn. The presence of gamma 2 subunit immunoreactivity at these different synaptic contacts suggests that the two types of inhibition can be modulated by benzodiazepine drugs. The findings also provide anatomical evidence for the possible regulation of GABA release through an autoreceptor, and for GABAergic communication between neuronal and glial components.",

In the cerebellum, Bmax was decreased by 74% but the binding affinity increased 5-fold as the Kd decreased from 10 to 2 nM. The ethanol-withdrawn group did not differ significantly from the ethanol-treated group. No changes were observed in the cerebrum and liver. These results further support the idea that [3H]PK 11195 binding may be a useful marker for ethanol consumption.

YM060, YM114 and granisetron dose-dependently antagonized the depolarization of the rat vagus nerve induced by 5-HT, with decreases in the slope and maximal response at higher concentrations. Apparent pA2 values for these antagonists were 10.27 +/- 0.09, 10.12 +/- 0.16 and 9.44 +/- 0.40, respectively. Ondansetron produced a clear rightward shift of the concentration-response curve to 5-HT. The pA2 value was 8.63 (8.23-9.68). YM060 and YM114 at up to 10(-5) M produced no significant depression of the depolarizing responses to DMPP and GABA.

An excellent correlation (r = 0.97) was obtained between pA2 values in the vagus nerve and pKi values in the cerebral cortex. YM060, YM114, granisetron and ondansetron showed low affinities for 5-HT1A, 5-HT2 receptor, adrenergic alpha 1, alpha 2, dopamine D2, muscarinic M2, mu-opioid, benzodiazepine and histamine H1 receptors. These results support the possibility that the same type of 5-HT3 receptor occurs in rat vagus nerve and cerebral cortex.", 
    "61": "Effects of methylmercury (MetHg) on the specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding were studied in rat cortical and cerebellar P2-fractions in vitro. MetHg did not affect significantly the specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding in unwashed P2-fraction but increased it marginally (by 16%) at 100 microM in washed P2-fraction, in both brain regions. Muscimol (3 microM), a GABAA agonist, stimulated the [3H]flunitrazepam binding by 30% to 50% depending on the brain region. In washed cerebellar membranes the enhancing response of muscimol was 10 to 14% lower after preincubation of the tissue with MetHg but in cerebral cortex MetHg did not modulate the muscimol response at all. The results indicate that Met-Hg may have region specific effects on GABAA receptors in vitro and the effect may depend on the occupational state of the GABA binding domain of the receptor complex.", 
    "62": "Since the development of tolerance to morphine antinociception in formalin-treated mice was delayed and diazepam normalized the delay, the involvement of GABAergic systems in the process was investigated. Gamma amino-n-butyric acid (GABA) at 10 mg/kg and the GABAA-receptor agonist muscimol at 0.05 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min before daily morphine injection at 10 mg/kg, s.c. completely reversed the delay in the development of morphine tolerance in the formalin-treated mice. The GABAA antagonist bicuculline at 1 mg/kg and the Cl(-)-channel blocker picrotoxin at 1 mg/kg extinguished the reverse effect of muscimol and GABA, respectively. In contrast, the GABAB antagonist CGP 35348 (3-aminopropane-diethoxymethyl-phosphinic acid) up to 100 mg/kg, i.p. failed to abolish the GABA effect; and baclofen, a GABAB-receptor agonist, at 0.5 and 2 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min before morphine was without effect on the delay. On the other hand, bicuculline was incapable of abolishing the reverse effects of diazepam on the delay of tolerance development; and likewise, the reverse effect of muscimol was not affected by flumazenil. No appreciable influence of these GABA-related compounds was seen on morphine antinociception itself nor the development of tolerance in normal mice. These results suggest that the benzodiazepine-GABAA-Cl- channel complex is involved in the mechanism underlying the delay of the development of morphine tolerance in formalin-treated mice; however, it is deduced that benzodiazepine-receptor and GABAergic systems are not always functionally coupled to each other in the mechanisms.", 
    "63": "We used the short-lived radionuclide, 82Br- to follow gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) receptor-mediated halide exchange into membrane vesicles from rat cerebral cortex in millisecond and second time regions using quench-flow technique. The radioisotope was prepared by neutron capture [81Br-(n,gamma)82Br-] on irradiation of a natural isotope of bromine, 81Br- in a neutron flux. 82Br- decays by beta-emission with secondary gamma-emission. Possible advantages of 82Br- over 36Cl- in anion tracer measurements include, (a) a short lifetime (t1/2 = 35.3 hr), which alleviates contamination and disposal problems, (b) high counting efficiency (1.54) due to the secondary radiation, (c) measurement with a gamma-counter as well as a beta-counter, (d) a simple preparation not requiring subsequent purification steps giving a specific activity depending on the irradiation time. With 6 hr irradiation time the specific activity was sufficient to make measurements with < 1 mM Br-, which is less than the bromide concentration known to affect the properties of GABAA receptor. The radiotracers, 82Br- and 36Cl- could be compared with the same solution composition. In conditions where a direct effect of binding of halide to receptor does not contribute to a difference in measured ion-flux, 82Br- was translocated only marginally faster than 36Cl-. The effect of chlordiazepoxide (CDPX) (2-250 microM) on the progress of GABA (10 microM)-mediated 82Br- uptake was measured in a time range of 200 msec to 20 sec using quench-flow technique. The two phases of anion exchange previously reported in this experimental model with GABA alone were observed. The rate of 82Br- exchange was increased 2.3-fold at 30-60 microM CDPX and was not further increased with increasing [CDPX]. The rate of halide exchange is a measure of open channel concentration. The isotope exchange rate constant, J, in a membrane vesicle preparation, is a measure of the membrane permeability per internal volume/surface area, J = PmA/V. Receptor desensitization rate was also increased by CDPX, but unlike the isotope exchange rate, it continued to increase up to at least 250 microM CDPX.", 
    "64": "The present study is to investigate structural changes of adinazolam mesylate in aqueous solution under various pH conditions by NMR spectroscopy. By plotting of the signal integration and chemical shifts of the side chain, pKa values for imine hydrolysis and the side chain amine were determined. Conformational analysis of the side chain was performed with deuterium-induced isotope effects on chemical shifts, nuclear Overhauser effects, relaxation times, and energy calculations. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange due to an active methylene at the 4-position under basic conditions was revealed.", 
    "65": "Simultaneous binding of two drugs to human serum albumin (HSA) was investigated by difference circular dichroism (delta CD) spectroscopy. Phenylbutazone and diazepam were chosen as specific markers for binding areas I (cumarines) and II (indoles), respectively, and their stereospecific interactions with protein were selectively characterized. Displacers were drugs known to specifically bind to areas I (salicylate) and II (racemic ibuprofen). The results indicate two different interaction mechanisms: a direct competition one (diazepam-ibuprofen and phenylbutazone-salicylate) and an indirect competition one (diazepam-salicylate and phenylbutazone-ibuprofen). The two major binding areas on HSA are distinct, but not independent, entities. Finally, the dissociation constants of marker ligands and competitors complexed to HSA were determined by quantitative analysis of CD data.", 
    "66": "The role of benzodiazepine (BZD)-gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptors in the pathogenesis of absence seizures is uncertain. In this study, we examined the effect of absence seizures on the binding of flumazenil to the BZD binding site of the GABAA receptor. Five patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) were studied at rest and during absence seizures with [11C]flumazenil and positron emission tomography (PET). Normalized regional cerebral time-activity curves from the resting and ictal scans were compared with each other and with computed simulations showing the effects of changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and [11C]flumazenil binding. No evidence was found for a change in [11C]flumazenil binding with absence seizures. This result, together with those of a recent study showing no abnormality of [11C]flumazenil binding interictally in patients with childhood and juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE) does not support a primary role for the BZD binding site of the GABAA receptor in the pathogenesis of absence seizures.", 
    "67": "1. The effects of chronic administration of five antidepressant drugs on the benzodiazepine and 5-HT2A binding sites in the same rat brain were assessed. 2. Clomipramine, desipramine, maprotiline, fluoxetine, and phenelzine (all 10 mg/kg/day) were administered s.c. for 21 days by Alzet osmotic minipumps. 3. Results showed that none of the drugs changed the density or affinity of benzodiazepine binding sites, yet at the same dose all the drugs with the exception of fluoxetine decreased binding to 5-HT2A receptors in the same animals.", 
    "68": "Possible involvement of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) in hemin/protoporphyrin-induced erythroid differentiation of human leukemia K562 cells was investigated by the use of the ligands, diazepam and PK11195. Diazepam itself exhibited differentiation-inducing activity on K562 cells. The PBR-specific antagonist, PK11195, dose-dependently inhibited both diazepam-induced and hemin/protoporphyrin-induced K562 cell differentiation. The results imply that PBR is involved in the erythroid differentiation of K562 cells.", 
    "69": "The main interest of the present study was to determine possible alterations in fatty acid composition in rat plasma and liver phospholipids (PL) caused by chronic ethanol consumption, diazepam treatment and chronic consumption of alcohol and diazepam together. Chronic ethanol consumption (11 g/kg/d) elevated the proportion of plasma saturated (SFA) and mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and decreased the most important polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in plasma and liver PL. The alterations in fatty acid composition in liver PL indicate that ethanol can change the composition of cell membrane lipids. Diazepam treatment (10 mg/kg/d) elevated the contents of SFA and MUFA in plasma PL. On the other hand, diazepam produced a drastic decrease in 22:6n-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in plasma and liver PL. These changes in plasma PL fatty acid composition indicated a disturbance of fatty acid metabolism. The changes in fatty acid contents of plasma and liver PL were the greatest in rats treated with a combination of ethanol and diazepam, in which there was a summation of the effects of ethanol or diazepam alone, and the effects were intensified by an ethanol-diazepam interaction.", 
    "70": "A study was carried out to compare the effectiveness of two doses of temazepam elixir for the behaviour management of paediatric dental patients. Twenty-two children aged 2-5 years (mean 4.06 years), classified as ASA Class I and II (American Society of Anesthesiologists Classification), were assigned to receive either 0.3 or 0.5 mg/kg temazepam elixir in a double-blind randomized cross-over study. All treatment sessions were videotaped and rated independently by three paediatric dentists for the degree of crying, movement, sleep and overall behaviour at 15-minute intervals while being treated. The results showed no statistically significant differences between the two doses.", 
    "71": "Central benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors are located only in the central nervous system and mediate the clinical effects obtained by various BZs. In addition, there is another receptor that binds BZs with different drug specificities, which is located mainly on the outer mitochondrial membrane of various peripheral tissues. Peripheral BZ receptors (PBR) are composed of three subunits: an isoquinoline binding site, a voltage-dependent anion channel, and an adenine nucleotide carrier, with molecular weights of 18, 32, and 30 kDa, respectively. Complementary DNA of the isoquinoline binding subunit has been cloned in rat, calf, and human. The major role of PBR is in the regulation of steroid biosynthesis. Various PBR ligands stimulate the conversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone and the production of steroid hormones. The naturally occurring diazepam-binding inhibitor stimulates in vivo steroidogenesis via binding to PBR. In the female, PBR density is increased in rat and human ovary proportional with greater cell maturation and differentiation. In the male, testosterone modulates PBR density in the genital tract. These results show the strong relationship between PBR and the endocrine system.", 
    "72": "The paw test was used to detect the preclinical profile (classical versus atypical) of five putative, atypical neuroleptics, namely olanzapine, sertindole, risperidone, prothipendyl and ORG 5222. In the paw test classical neuroleptics increase the hindlimb reaction time (HRT), a parameter with predictive validity for antipsychotic efficacy, at doses comparable to those necessary for increasing forelimb reaction time (FRT), a parameter with predictive validity for extrapyramidal side-effects, whereas atypical neuroleptics increase HRT at doses that are much smaller than those increasing FRT. All tested compounds showed the profile of atypical neuroleptics in the paw test. Using the FRT/HRT ratio of minimum effective doses as overall predictor of a favourable ratio of extrapyramidal and therapeutic effects of these drugs, the following order was found: olanzapine (20) > sertindole = risperidone = prothipendyl (10) > ORG 5222 (3). The ability of compounds to attenuate locomotor activity elicited either from the olfactory tubercle (10 micrograms dopamine: OT test) or from the nucleus accumbens (1 microgram ergometrine: ACC test) was used to establish whether the compounds preferentially act in one of these structures. Previous research has shown that classical neuroleptics are far less potent in the OT test than in the ACC test, whereas atypical neuroleptics are far more potent in the OT test than in the ACC test. All five agents preferentially acted in the olfactory tubercle. The order of potency in the olfactory tubercle was as follows: sertindole > ORG 5222 > risperidone > olanzapine > prothipendyl. It is concluded that risperidone, prothipendyl, ORG 5222, sertindole and olanzapine not only show the profile of atypical neuroleptics in the paw test, but also preferentially act in the olfactory tubercle, but not in the nucleus accumbens, viz. two features that they share with the atypical neuroleptics clozapine and thioridazine and with the putative, atypical neuroleptics raclopride and remoxipride.", 
    "73": "In this study, we evaluated the effects of diazepam (0.2, 0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 mg/kg; IM) on the primacy and recency memory effects in four rhesus monkeys trained on a six-item serial probe recognition (SPR) task. Only the highest dose of diazepam (3.2 mg/kg) consistently affected the shape of the monkeys' serial position curves. Accuracy on the probe trials was disrupted for list items which occurred in the middle portion and recency memory component of the serial position curve, without affecting the primacy component. Diazepam, however, also produced several nonspecific effects on SPR performance. Both the 1.6 and 3.2 mg/kg diazepam doses disrupted accuracy on the non-matching probe trials, and the 3.2 mg/kg dose caused an increase in response latencies which were unrelated to any one component of the serial position curve. This is the first demonstration in nonhuman primates showing that the primacy and recency memory effects can be differentiated on the basis of diazepam dose.", 
    "74": "The state-dependent effect of the BZ-receptor agonist diazepam (1.25-10 mg/kg), the partial agonist FG 8205 (0.5-4.0 mg/kg) and the BZ1-receptor agonist zolpidem (0.25-2 mg/kg) were investigated in rats. During daily sessions, animals were trained to acquire FR10 lever pressing for food reinforcement whilst under the influence of the agonists, using an operant technique. Forty-eight hours after the final training session under drug, their performance of the FR10 was evaluated during a test session, carried out following vehicle administration only. Neither diazepam, nor FG 8205 impaired acquisition of the task. In the group treated with 2 mg/kg zolpidem, six out of eight rats failed to learn within 20 sessions, but the smaller doses were without effect on acquisition. When drug treatment was withdrawn, there was evidence that all three of the agonists tested produced state-dependency. This was apparent in the form of longer latencies to obtain reinforcement and decreased lever pressing rates. The significance of these findings are discussed in the context of the relationship between the state-dependent effects of BZ-receptor agonists and their other properties, and the receptor subtypes which might underly these effects.", 
    "75": "The effect of anesthetics on hemodynamic variables (HV) has been clarified, but ambiguity existed concerning their effect on oxygenation variables (OV). Radical cystectomy provided a clinical setting for studying the effect of anesthetics on perioperative HV and OV. Patients subjected to radical cystectomy (n = 33) were assigned through balanced randomization to receive one of four anesthetic modalities, namely; group I: inhalation anesthesia using N2O:O2, halothane, d-tubocurarine (n = 11); group II: inhalation anesthesia using N2O:O2, halothane, d-tubocurarine, and supplemented with epidural analgesia (EA) (n = 11); group III: total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) using ketamine 10-30 ug.kg-1.min-1, propofol 2 mg.kg-1.h-1, d-tubocurarine, and supplemented with continuous EA (n = 6): and group IV:TIVA using ketamine 20-50 ug.kg-1.min-1, midazolam in increments of 1.5 to 5 mg, and supplemented with intermittent EA (n = 5). Monitoring entailed continuous ECG, pulse oximerty, invasive arterial pressure, and pulmonary artery catheter for HV (HR, MAP, PAP, PAOP, CO, SVR, and PVR) and OV. (PaO2, SaO2, PvO2, SvO2, a-vDO2, O2ext, Qs/Qt, DO2, and VO2). The heart rate was lower in TIVA while other HV did not show striking differences, Group I showed higher arterial oxygen tension than group II and IV. Mixed venous oxygen tension and saturation were higher in group I over group IV. Other OV did not show remarkable differences. In conclusion, HV and OV in 4 anesthetic modalities did not elicit striking differences.", 
    "76": "Many therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines are mediated by neuronal high-affinity binding sites, i.e. benzodiazepine receptors (BR), located on GABAA receptors. Recently, endogenous BR ligands have partially been identified which, as agonists, either increase or, as inverse agonists, decrease GABAergic inhibition in the brain. BR antagonists, previously described as intrinsically inactive, induce effects in animals and humans under particular circumstances emphasizing a functional relevance of endogenous BR ligands. Several brain disorders, e.g. anxiety, insomnia, epilepsy, spasticity, alcoholism, coma, dementia, may be associated with a disequilibrium of opposing endogenous BR ligands changing the excitability of neurons implicated in aforementioned diseases. It is proposed that, depending on the relative role endogenous BR ligands play in the pathophysiology of these disorders, BR antagonists might demonstrate a variable efficacy in improving their symptomatology. In fact, such therapy would restore the homeostatic balance among various endogenous BR ligands being disturbed during an illness.", 
    "77": "Psychoactive drugs such as chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, propranolol and diazepam were evaluated for their ability to block stress induced changes in Wistar albino rats. The stress induced changes were monitored as the difference in plasma corticosterone (PCS) levels, before and after the administration of minimum effective doses of psychoactive drugs. Significant results were obtained with diazepam at the dose of 5-10 mg/kg and to a lesser extent with propranolol 20 mg/kg. Other drugs, at their minimum effective doses showed no significant change in plasma corticosterone levels.", 
    "78": "We studied two patients with herpes encephalitis (HSE) by [99mTc]HMPAO and [123I]iomazenil single photon emission computed tomography. Increased uptake of HMPAO was seen for up to 63 days in the HSE affected brain area. Iomazenil binds to benzodiazepine receptors and can measure neurone loss. Decreased iomazenil uptake was observed a few days after onset, at a time when hyperfixation of HMPAO occurred. Because in HSE neurone loss occurs simultaneously with hyperfixation of HMPAO, it is unlikely that this hyperfixation is caused by increased neuronal activity, as in epilepsy. This suggests that the hyperfixation of HMPAO in HSE occurs in glia and is sustained by inflammation-related hypermetabolism and acidity. The early neurone loss in HSE stresses the importance of immediate antiviral treatment.", 
    "79": "Insomnia is a complex complaint which is often multifactorial in origin. Pharmacotherapy can only be an adjunct in the treatment of insomnia and hypnotics should be given on an intermittent basis for short periods of time. An overview is presented of the currently available hypnotics, of which benzodiazepines are still the most widely prescribed. New drugs which bind to specific receptor subtypes or which are partial benzodiazepine receptor agonists might overcome the disadvantages associated with chronic benzodiazepine use, but more long-term investigations are needed.", 
    "80": "Previous studies reported a positive correlation between ligand affinities at diazepam-insensitive GABAA receptors and substitution for the discriminative stimulus effects of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil, in pigeons. In the present experiments, bretazenil and Ro 14-5974 (ethyl-(S)-11,12,13,13 a-tetrahydro-9-oxo-9H-imidazo[1,5-a]-pyrrolo-[2,1-c] [1,4]benzodiazepine-1-carboxylate) partially substituted for, and blocked the discriminative stimulus effects of midazolam, congruent with their actions at diazepam-sensitive GABAA receptors in vitro. In addition, bretazenil and Ro 14-5974, but not their R-enantiomers, had high affinity for diazepam-insensitive receptors and fully substituted for the discriminative stimulus effects of flumazenil. The R-enantiomers of these compounds had low affinity (Ki > 1 microM) for diazepam-sensitive and diazepam-insensitive receptors, and did not share discriminative stimulus effects with flumazenil or midazolam. Ro 19-0528 (7-chloro-3-(3-cyclopropyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)-4,5-dihydro-5-met hyl-6H- imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepin-6-one), a structurally related compound with full agonist actions at diazepam-sensitive GABAA receptors, had high diazepam-insensitive receptor affinity (Ki = 96 nM) and partially substituted for the discriminative stimulus effects of flumazenil. These results are consistent with stereospecific mediation of the discriminative stimulus effects of flumazenil through high affinity binding to diazepam-insensitive receptors in pigeons.", 
    "81": "Dopamine D1 and D2 receptors as well as the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex in the striatum and the globus pallidus (internal: GPi and external: GPe) were studied by autoradiography using [3H]SCH 23390, [3H]spiperone, and [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FNZ) respectively, in five groups of cynomolgus monkeys. These included (i) untreated 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-monkeys; (ii) MPTP monkeys treated chronically with levodopa injections; (iii) MPTP monkeys treated chronically with injections of the novel D2 agonist U91356A; (iv) MPTP monkeys treated chronically with U91356A delivered through an osmotic mini-pump; and (5) naive controls. Animals treated in a pulsatile mode with U91356A or levodopa injections showed progressive sensitization to their respective drug and developed choreic dyskinesia. In contrast, animals treated in a continuous mode with U91356A showed behavioral tolerance but did not develop dyskinesia. A trend for a down-regulation of putaminal D2 receptors was observed following D2 agonist stimulation with U913356A. Striatal [3H]FNZ binding was significantly decreased only in animals treated in a continuous mode with U91356A. The dopamine receptor decrease in the striatum could be implicated with the development of tolerance but cannot explain the appearance of dyskinesia. Denervation by MPTP was associated with a decrease of the GPe/GPi [3H]FNZ binding ratio which reflects an imbalance of striatal output pathways; this ratio was not reversed by any of the treatments although changes were observed in the GPe and GPi. Indeed, pulsatile U91356A treatment restored the decreased [3H]FNZ binding in the GPe near control values and levodopa showed a similar tendency. A significant increase of [3H]FNZ binding in the GPi only of dyskinetic monkeys, namely those treated with pulsatile U91356A or levodopa was seen compared to untreated MPTP or naive controls. This GABAA receptor up-regulation might lead to a supersensitive state of the GPi to gabaergic input which may be involved in the mechanism underlying the development of dopaminomimetic-induced dyskinesia.", 
    "82": "In this study, pregnenolone sulfate, progesterone and some of its main reduced metabolites were tested for anxiolytic properties in rats using the burying behavior paradigm. All steroids were subcutaneously injected. Progesterone (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mg/rat) and its 3 alpha-5 alpha-reduced metabolite (0.125, 0.250, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/rat) produced a clear dose-dependent anxiolytic response, without affecting the spontaneous ambulatory behavior. 5 alpha-Pregnanedione decreased burying behavior only at the highest dose (4.0 mg/rat). Pregnenolone sulfate (1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mg/rat), 5 beta-pregnanedione and 3 beta- or 5 beta-pregnenolones were devoid of effects. The 3 beta-5 beta-reduced metabolite of progesterone (2.0 and 4.0 mg/rat) decreased motor activity, without altering the burying behavior. These results demonstrate that the 3 alpha-5 alpha metabolite of progesterone shows the highest anxiolytic potency in the burying behavior test, when compared with all steroids evaluated. The data are discussed in terms of the close structure-activity relationship requirements of steroids to stimulate the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor-chloride ionophore complex.", 
    "83": "We examined the effect of cholecystokinin octapeptide sulfated type (CCK-8S) on dysfunction of CA1 pyramidal neurons induced by in vitro ischemic insult in hippocampal slices of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). CCK-8S shortened the time required for partial recovery from block of a population spike produced by ischemia. Furthermore, CCK-8S reduced ischemic insult-induced accumulation of K+ in extracellular space. Suppression of the K+ conductance by the CCKB receptor activation is suggested to contribute to neuroprotection by CCK-8S.", 
    "84": "The present study investigated the effect of long-term treatment with omeprazole on pepsinogen-producing cells and examined whether the selective CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonist was able to prevent the omeprazole-induced changes, if occurred, in rat stomach. Rats were treated with omeprazole and/or the CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonist for 28 days. As a result, omeprazole markedly reduced mucosal pepsinogen activity and its mRNA concentration in rat stomach. Morphologically, in fundic glands omeprazole drastically decreased the proportion of mature chief cells and reciprocally increased that of immature chief cells which were positive for class III mucin. These effects of omeprazole were attenuated by an addition of the CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonist. Our results suggest that omeprazole retards the differentiation of chief cells in fundic mucosa probably through hypergastrinemia in adult rat.", 
    "85": "In a previous study, it was found that down-regulation of benzodiazepine (BZ) binding in rats treated 4 weeks with flurazepam was relatively greater and more widespread when measured with [3H]zolpidem, a selective 'BZ1 receptor' ligand, than that measured with the non-selective ligand, [3H]flunitrazepam. In the present study, the time course for down-regulation of [3H]zolpidem binding was studied in rats treated with flurazepam. [3H]Zolpidem binding was also studied in rats given a midazolam treatment shown to cause tolerance. Rats were chronically treated with flurazepam for 1 or 2 weeks, or with midazolam for 3 weeks, then killed immediately after the treatment. Another group of rats was acutely treated with desalkyl-flurazepam and killed 30 min later. After 2 weeks of flurazepam treatment, the Bmax of [3H]zolpidem binding was decreased by 22% in cerebral cortex, 26% in cerebellum and 33% in hippocampus, with no change in the Kd in any region. After 1 week of flurazepam treatment, the Bmax was decreased by 23% in cerebellum and 14% in hippocampus, but not changed in cerebral cortex. The Kd was increased in cerebral cortex, but not in cerebellum or hippocampus. Neither the Bmax nor the Kd of [3H]zolpidem binding was affected by acute desalkyl-flurazepam treatment, or by 3 weeks of midazolam treatment. These results, in combination with previous findings, which showed no change in [3H]flunitrazepam binding after 1 or 2 week flurazepam treatment, and no change in cerebellum even after the 4 week treatment, may indicate a shift in BZ receptor subtypes in flurazepam-tolerant rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "86": "Seven compounds having varying affinities for peripheral benzodiazepine (p sites) were evaluated in vitro as inhibitors of arachidonic acid-induced rabbit platelet aggregation and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) synthesis. With the exception of flumazenil, all compounds inhibited both parameters with IC50 values ranging from 0.19 to 3.5 microM, with a significant correlation between the inhibition of aggregation and the synthesis of thromboxane B2. The antiaggregatory effect was stereoselective, and inhibition was increased when cellular penetration was favoured by increasing the volume of the organic solvent. The order of potency these compounds is consistent with an effect at intracellular p sites (Ro5-4864 > PK14067 > PK 11195 > PK 14068 > or = clonazepam > or = diazepam > flumazenil). However, the correlation between the aggregation inhibition and the synthesis of TXB2 suggests that microsomal cyclooxygenase may be the intracellular target of these ligands. We therefore propose that this enzyme possesses a site for benzodiazepine ligands which may share certain characteristics with the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "87": "The syntheses of a series of novel imidazobenzodiazepines and their affinities for diazepam sensitive (DS) and diazepam insensitive (DI) GABAA receptors are described. Imidazobenzodiazepines belong to one of the very few chemical families which exhibit high to moderate potency for DI GABAA receptors. Although imidazobenzodiazepines such as Ro 15-4513, 20, are the most potent DI GABAA receptor ligands described to date, their selectivity for DI versus DS GABAA receptors is only marginal. Previous structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of imidazobenzodiazepines have indicated that the 3- and 8-positions are critical for high-affinity binding to DI GABAA receptors (J. Med. Chem. 1993, 36, 479-490. J. Med. Chem. 1993, 36, 1001-1006. J. Med. Chem. 1993, 36, 1820-1830). In order to determine why the ester function is critical to high affinity at the DI site, we have synthesized several derivatives which have substituents other than an ester at the C(3) position including 3-alkyl-, 3-alkylketo-, 3-alkyl ether, and 3-dialkylamino-substituted imidazobenzodiazepines. The SAR analysis of these compounds when combined with that of several pyrazoloquinolinones indicates that interactions at H1 and L1 as well as interactions at H2 anti to the imidazole N(2) and at a lipophilic pocket (labeled LDi) about the 3-position are required in order for imidazobenzodiazepines to exhibit selectivity and high affinity for DI GABAA receptors. Furthermore, the imidazobenzodiazepines substituted with an electron-donating group (alkoxy function) at position 8 revealed that the change of the substituent at C(8) from an electron-withdrawing to a donating function did not substantially alter either ligand affinity or selectivity for DI GABAA receptors. Thus, a pharmacophore is proposed for DI GABAA receptor ligands, which is characterized by the requirement of a lipophilic pocket LDi about the C(3) position of imidazobenzodiazepines. Using this model, two pyrazoloquinolinone derivatives were designed and synthesized. Their affinities and selectivities for DI GABAA receptors are consistent with those predicted by the DI GABAA receptor pharmacophore. In addition, examination of the in vitro binding data of 3-alkyl ether analogs confirms that the anti conformation of the ester group at the C(3) position of imidazobenzodiazepines (Ro15-4513, 20 series) is preferred at both DI and DS GABAA receptors. This constitutes the first evidence (other than molecular modeling) to support the auxillary involvement of H2 at the DI site and is important with regard to the synthesis of other DI GABAA receptor selective ligands in the future.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "88": "Biologically active amidated gastrin is synthesized by carboxyl-terminal alpha-amidation of a glycine-extended progastrin post-translational processing intermediate (G-Gly). Although plasma levels of G-Gly are equivalent to those of gastrin, G-Gly has essentially no acute effect on gastric acid secretion. However, we have observed that inhibition of gastrin amidation leads to increased plasma concentrations of G-Gly and enhanced gastric acid secretion. We hypothesized, therefore, that G-Gly might have a chronic effect to increase H+,K(+)-ATPase expression in gastric parietal cells. In the present studies, we observed that a 2-day preincubation with G-Gly significantly enhanced histamine-stimulated [14C]aminopyrine uptake by isolated canine gastric parietal cells but acutely administered G-Gly had no effect. On Northern blot analysis, both G-Gly and gastrin dose-dependently increased H+,K(+)-ATPase alpha-subunit gene expression with maximal induction (225 +/- 35 and 170 +/- 29% of basal, mean +/- S.E.) achieved at concentrations of 10(-9) M G-Gly and 10(-8) M gastrin, respectively. Using an H+,K(+)-ATPase alpha-subunit gene-luciferase chimeric reporter construct transfected into primary cultured parietal cells, we observed that both G-Gly and gastrin increased luciferase activity in a manner similar to that obtained by Northern blot analysis. L365,260, a specific gastrin/CCKB receptor antagonist, completely reversed the stimulation of luciferase activity induced by gastrin but had no effect on G-Gly-stimulated activity. Gastrin increased [Ca2+]i, although G-Gly did not, however, genistein (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) significantly reduced induction of luciferase activity by both G-Gly and gastrin. Specific binding of 125I-Leu15-G2-17-Gly to gastric parietal cells was dose-dependently displaced by G2-17-Gly but not by gastrin nor L365,260. Gastrin peptides truncated at the carboxyl- (G1-13) and amino terminus (G5-17-Gly) both induced H+,K(+)-ATPase alpha-subunit gene expression and inhibited 125I-Leu15-G2-17-Gly binding, but were less potent than G2-17-Gly. These data indicate that G-Gly may have a functional role in potentiating gastric acid secretagogue action via enhanced expression of the gene responsible for H+ generation through action at a novel receptor that can be distinguished from the gastrin/CCKB receptor. Thus, both the substrate and product of the terminal progastrin processing reaction appear to have complementary functions in regulation of gastric acid secretion.", 
    "89": "Urinary glucuronide metabolites of the benzodiazepines were converted back to the parent molecules after treatment with B-glucuronidase. The benzodiazepines were extracted by a one-step liquid/liquid extraction from urine or by a liquid/solid phase extraction. For the limit of detection (LOD), a standard solution of diazepam and oxazepam was serially diluted and analyzed to the point at which a reproducible analytical result was no longer obtained. Using a temperature program and a splitless mode of injection, excellent quantitation was achieved within an 8-min run time. Based upon specimens obtained from patients under a physician's care, we have determined that urinary concentrations of the benzodiazepines > 200 ng/ml are most likely due to abuse rather than to a prescribed ingestion under strict medical surveillance. Therefore, the calibration standard and cutoff concentration for a positive result was set at 200 ng/ml.", 
    "90": "We have defined the effect and acceptability of a locally developed general practice programme for the modification of prescribing. This voluntary programme consisted of prescription analysis and feedback, followed by visits from a pharmacist, a therapeutic bulletin on benzodiazepine prescribing, and use of a locally compiled preferred medicines list. A 3-month prescription sample from 26 general practitioners (GPs) fulfilling a stable practice definition was used to compare prescribing pre-project and mid-project. For 20 out of 26 GPs, prescribing of medicines on the preferred medicines list had increased significantly 8 months after the intervention programme had been introduced. Total prescription numbers and total medicines expenditure decreased by 8.3 and 4.9%, respectively, from 1988 to 1989. The decrease in benzodiazepine prescribing was marked (mean -22.2%, range -50.3 to +4%). The cooperative multimodel approach was highly successful in modifying prescribing in general practice.", 
    "91": "Benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) ligands are elevated in animals and humans with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) and contribute to the pathogenesis of the associated hepatic encephalopathy (HE). As gut factors are proposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of HE, we investigated gut flora as a source of BZR ligands. Rats received daily oral neomycin, vancomycin and metronidazole (AB +) or saline (AB -) before and concurrent with the induction of FHF with thioacetamide. BZR ligands were extracted from brain and plasma and quantified using radiometric techniques. Plasma BZR ligand concentrations in AB(+) and AB(-) rats with HE were higher than AB(+) and AB(-) control rats. Brain BZR ligand concentrations increased in AB(+) and AB(-) rats with HE. Stool cultures from antibiotic treated rats with HE indicated the presence of multidrug resistant Acinetobacter lwoffii. Although no significant concentrations of BZR ligands were detected in culture media inoculated with A. lwoffii, administering A. lwoffii to normal rats significantly elevated BZR ligand levels in brain, but not plasma. Thus, antibiotic treatment of rats is associated with the growth of a resistant strain of bacterium which produces an inactive BZR ligand precursor. BZR ligands may be synthesized from these precursors in the brain and efficiently cleared by a normal liver following brain-to-plasma transfer. Impairment of this clearance process in FHF facilitates their accumulation, enabling agonist BZR ligands to contribute to the pathogenesis of HE by further enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission.", 
    "92": "As our knowledge of post-traumatic stress disorder grows, so new treatment strategies develop. This article evaluates the benefits and limitations of drug treatment, with reference to underlying neurobiological changes seen in the condition. Drug treatment has a beneficial role if used as part of a flexible, client-centred approach.", 
    "93": "A simple and sensitive HPLC method is described for the determination of the nitrobenzodiazepines, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam and clonazepam and their respective 7-amino metabolites in post-mortem blood. Using a single-step extraction the nitrobenzodiazepines were recovered from 0.5 ml of blood using butyl chloride. The solvent was evaporated to dryness and the reconstituted residue injected onto an HPLC system. Separation was achieved using a phenyl-bonded reversed-phase column with an acetonitrile-phosphate buffer mobile phase. Ultraviolet detection (240 nm) was used for quantitation. A linear response was observed between 0.01 and 0.60 mg/l. Assay precision between and within assays was less than 20% for all analytes. The limits of detection ranged from 0.001 to 0.008 mg/l with a limit of quantitation of 0.01 mg/l for all analytes.", 
    "94": "We describe the biological properties of a new class of potent farnesyltransferase (FT) inhibitors designed as bisubstrate analog inhibitors. These inhibitors incorporate the structural motifs of both farnesyl pyrophosphate and the CAAX tetrapeptide, the two substrates of the reaction catalyzed by FT. Both the phosphinate inhibitor, BMS-185878, and the phosphonate inhibitor, BMS-184467, exhibited higher in vitro FT selectivity than some of the previously reported CVFM peptidomimentics and benzodiazepine analogs. Xenopus oocyte maturation induced by microinjected oncogenic Ras proteins was blocked by coinjected BMS-184467 and BMS-185878. However, both inhibitors showed poor cell activity presumably because of the doubly charged nature of the compounds. Thus, masking the charge on the carboxylate ion markedly improved the cell permeability of BMS-185878, leading to BMS-186511, the methyl carboxyl ester prodrug. BMS-186511 inhibited FT activity in whole cells as determined by inhibition of p21 Ras protein processing, inhibition of farnesylation of proteins including Ras and the accumulation of unfarnesylated Ras proteins in the cytosolic fraction. While the cellular effects of these bisubstrate analog inhibitors had no significant effect on growth of untransformed NIH3T3 cells, they produced pronounced inhibition of Ras transformed cell growth. Both the anchorage dependent and independent growth of ras transformed cells were severely curtailed by micromolar concentrations of BMS-186511. We also found that both H-ras and K-ras transformed cells are affected by this bisubstrate inhibitor. However, K-ras transformed cells appear to be less sensitive. The inhibition of FT activity in cells and the ensuing inhibition of ras transformed cell growth is further manifested in distinct morphological changes in cells. Cells flattened, became less refractile and grew in contact inhibited monolayer. Moreover, the highly diffused character of the actin cytoskeleton in the ras transformed cells was dramatically reverted to an organized network of stress cables crisscrossing the entire cells upon treatment with BMS-186511. All of these effects of BMS-186511 are limited to ras transformed cells that utilize farnesylated Ras, but are not seen in transformed cells that use geranylgeranyl Ras or myristoyl Ras. Significantly, these FT inhibitors did not produce any signs of gross cytotoxicity in untransformed, ras transformed cells or other oncogene transformed cells.", 
    "95": "Ion entry into neurons occurs either through receptor-operated channels (ROC) or voltage-operated channels (VOC). The function of ROC depends crucially on the action of agonists, antagonists or compounds modulating particular types of receptors (GABA A, NMDA, Ach N receptors). The function of VOC is closely connected with the activity of protein kinases and the processes of phosphorylation of membrane proteins (K+, Na+, Ca2+ channels). Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate brain. The GABA A receptor is a oligomeric complex of multiple binding sites and chloride channel. This complex contains recognition sites for GABA, anxiolytics such as benzodiazepine, anxiogenic--beta-carboline, and convulsant such as picrotoxin. Chloride ion channel plays a crucial role in anxiogenic, anxiolytic and convulsant activities. Glutamic acid is the main endogenous neurotransmitter for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type excitatory amino acid receptor. NMDA receptors connected with Ca2+ channel, have multiple modulatory sites which are affected by a wide range of compounds. There are NMDA and competitive NMDA antagonists site, the glycine site, the phencyclidine (PCP) site and the binding site of Mg2+ ions in this receptor complex. Calcium entry through NMDA receptors may be important in the etiology of many psychiatric disorders. VOC mediate rapid, voltage-gated changes in ion permeability during action potentials in neurons. Electrophysiological studies indicate the existence of three types of VOC (K+, Na+, Ca2+ channels). In number of neurons various subtypes of Ca2+ channels (P, T, N and L-type) occur together. Among them, the L-type calcium channel has been first described and most thoroughly studied. The L-type calcium channel is localized on nerve terminals in the pre and postsynaptic parts, as well as on cell bodies and may be involved in the mechanism of action of psychotropic drugs. Chronic treatment with various psychotropic drugs changes the density of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in the central nervous system. Thus calcium entry through both VOC and ROC may be important in the etiology of many psychiatric disorders.", 
    "96": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) acts on pharmacologically and functionally distinct receptors. These sites designated GABA-A and GABA-B receptors, differ with regard to their ionic characteristic and pharmacological properties. The most important distinction is, that the GABA-A receptor is associated with chloride channel and with membrane recognition sites for benzodiazepines. During the past decade numerous studies have made it possible to obtain more detailed knowledge of the structure and properties of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, which is made up of at least two distinct sites designated as BZD-1 and BZD-2 receptors. Third type, designated as peripheral type is located in the mitochondrial membrane and may regulate a steroidogenesis in the CNS. Molecular cloning studies showed a heterogeneity of GABA-A receptors, which are composed of multiple subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, delta and ro), which form distinct isoreceptors. New classes of GABA-BZD agonists such as zolpidem act selectively upon certain isoreceptors thus showing characteristic pharmacological properties. Recent studies provided detailed information on the interaction of ethyl alcohol (Et-OH) with GABA-BZD receptor complex. The most important finding is, that there are Et-OH sensitive and Et-OH resistant GABA-A receptor isoforms. Recent evidence reinforces the possibility, that reduced activity of the brain GABA-ergic system is associated with mechanism of depression.", 
    "97": "In order to determine the prevalence of sleeping disorders and their relationship with sociodemographic and medical variables in elderly attending to general morbidity physicians, 144 individuals from 65 years and up from 2 primary care centers in Santiago were interviewed. An structured interview which included sociodemographic data, reason of the visit, and benzodiazepine use; CIS-R, GHQ-12; BI; MMSE, and a questionnaire for physicians were applied. Mean age of the sample was 72.9 +/- 6.2 years old, most women, schooling less than 8 years, 52.1% had no partner, mean family income was U$A 112 +/- 61.8. There was a significant statistical association between sleeping and psychiatric disorders. General physicians made significantly more the diagnosis of psychiatric disorder among individuals with sleeping disorder, being also them who received significantly more benzodiazepine and antidepressive prescriptions.", 
    "98": "The effects of pretreatment with a benzodiazepine (diazepam) on the cardiovascular system of rats exposed to noise were evaluated. Animals were given diazepam before noise treatment; time exposure was one and six consecutive hours. Examination of preparations (corresponding portions of right atrium and ventricle), obtained using the histofluorescence method, showed that noise treatment increased the density of noradrenergic pattern. In diazepam-pretreated tissues the fluorescent fibres resulted to be thinner and less numerous, in particular after one hour of noise exposure. Our present data demonstrate that diazepam exerts a protective action on the heart, more evident after one hour of treatment.", 
    "99": "In this study we compared the performance of male Wistar rats, weighing 250-300 g, submitted to the standard plus maze (vertical surfaces of the closed arms with opaque walls) to their performance in a modified maze with raised Plexiglas edges in the closed arms (transparent walls). The animals (N = 12 for each group) continued to show a clear preference for the closed arms with transparent walls of the modified elevated plus maze. In addition, exploratory activity was higher in the open arms of the modified plus maze (4.25 +/- 0.42 entries and 53.50 +/- 5.10 s) as compared to that of the standard plus maze (2.10 +/- 0.25 entries and 24.00 +/- 4.91 s). Intraperitoneal injection of midazolam produced an increase in the number of entries (6.40 +/- 1.21 and 8.50 +/- 1.15 for 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg, respectively) and in the time spend in the open arms (85.32 +/- 14.56 and 125.50 +/- 22.16 s for 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg, respectively) while pentylenetetrazole caused a decrease in the number of entries (3.68 +/- 0.54 and 2.33 +/- 0.62 for 5.0 and 10 mg/kg, respectively) and in the time spent in the open arms of the modified maze (39.60 +/- 6.67 and 23.60 +/- 6.40 s for 5.0 and 10 mg/kg, respectively). The anxiolytic effect of midazolam and the anxiogenic effect of pentylenetetrazole were similar to those usually reported in the literature by authors using the standard test. These results behaviorally and pharmacologically validate the elevated plus maze with transparent walls and suggest that this test could be a useful tool for the study of anxiolytic drugs and the neurobiology of anxiety.", 
    "100": "The main neurotransmitter of the mouse urinary bladder is ATP, which is hydrolyzed to AMP and adenosine; the latter compound, in contrast to ATP, relaxes the smooth muscle. Diazepam also relaxes the urinary bladder and, since some peripheral and central effects of the benzodiazepines are thought to be induced by inhibition of adenosine uptake or by inhibiting calcium channels, the effects of diazepam, adenosine, R-phenylisopropyladenosine, cyclohexyladenosine, and of the calcium channel antagonists, diltiazem, verapamil and nifedipine, were studied on the contractile responses of the mouse isolated urinary bladder. The contractile responses of the bladder's smooth muscle were elicited by transmural stimulation and by application of ATP or acetylcholine. All drugs mentioned decreased the contractile responses of the bladder. The inhibitory effect of diazepam was similar to that induced by adenosine, R-phenylisopropyladenosine, cyclohexyladenosine, and nifedipine. 8-Phenyltheophylline, an adenosine receptor antagonist, did not decrease the relaxatory response of diazepam, which might exclude a P1 purinoceptor-mediated mechanism in the response studied. Diazepam did not significantly change the inhibitory effects of diltiazem and nifedipine on the contractile response to acetylcholine. The similar patterns of relaxant effects, exerted by diazepam, adenosine analogues and calcium channel antagonists, suggest the interference of benzodiazepine, and adenosine and its analogues on calcium channels of the urinary bladder smooth muscle. The inability of diazepam to further increase the effects of diltiazem and nifedipine on the responses to acetylcholine, reinforces the hypothesis that diazepam is acting through a common mechanism with calcium antagonists."
