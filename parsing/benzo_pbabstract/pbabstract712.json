    "0": "The effects of 5 mg of diazepam intravenously were assessed in 23 patients with liver disease, 10 of whom had clinical evidence either in the past or at the time of study of hepatic encephalopathy. Transient drowsiness occurred in all patients, but prolonged deterioration in conscious level was not observed. Serial electroencephalographic recordings showed the development of activity at faster frequencies, similar to that found in normal subjects, a change which is different from that usually observed in cirrhotic patients after administration of chlorpromazine and morphine when slow-wave activity is increased.", 
    "1": "The induction of anaesthesia with intravenous diazepam is a valuable contribution to the simpler use of cardioversion and is the method of choice because it is readily available for elective cardioversion. Fifty-six cardioversion procedures were carried out by this method in an African hospital. No special premedication or drug preparation was used. There were no hazards apart from transient apnoea in two patients and persisting amnesia in one patient.", 
    "2": "Six patients with persistent phenothiazine dyskinesia were treated in a double-blind controlled trial with tetrabenazine 100 mg in divided dosage. In three patients the abnormal movements were abolished and in two others there was some improvement, but this was no greater than that achieved with the diazepam control. Tetrabenazine may be useful in the treatment of some patients with persistent phenothiazine dyskinesia.", 
    "3": "Laparoscopic sterilization was performed on 50 racially distributed patients, aged 18-42 years, who were selected at random from the Outpatient Laparoscope Sterilization Clinic and offered sterilization under local anesthesia. The patients were injected with a systemic analgesic as well as a local anesthetic. One incision was made in the inferior rim of the umbilicus. The tubes were cauterized and a section removed. Patients were discharged after 2-3 hours in the recovery room with a prescription for an analgesic. Competent general anesthesia is considered safer than local anesthesia. Pain stimuli under local anesthesia can produce vasovagal responses at a higher rate than with general anesthesia."
