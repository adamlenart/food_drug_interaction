The animals were tested by open field and elevated plus maze tests for anxiety-like behavior, and Morris water maze test for spatial memory. In open field, (a) diazepam was more effective in reducing the anxiety, (b) control subjects were more mobile than pinealectomized subjects and (c) 100\u03bcg/kg melatonin administrations reduced the velocity of the animals. In elevated plus maze, (a) 100\u03bcg/kg melatonin administrations increased the distance totally travelled and (b) enhanced the time spent in open arms, however, after the pinealectomy, 1\u03bcg/kg melatonin administrations decreased it and (c) control animals were less mobile than pinealectomized ones. In Morris water maze, (a) diazepam group travelled more distance than the others in control condition whereas, in pinealectomy condition high dose of melatonin and saline groups travelled more distance than the others, (b) in pinealectomy condition subjects who received 100\u03bcg/kg melatonin also travelled more distance than those who received 1\u03bcg/kg melatonin and diazepam, (c) the subjects who received 1\u03bcg/kg spent less time than those who received other treatments, and (d) in control condition subjects who received 100\u03bcg/kg melatonin were slower than those who received the other treatments.

    "14": "Benzodiazepines and zolpidem are controlled in many countries due to their inherent adverse effects of a high degree of tolerance and dependence. Recently, as some of these drugs have become distributed illegally and available through media such as the Internet, their abuse is becoming a serious social problem. Hair is a useful specimen to prove chronic drug use. In the present study, a simultaneous analytical method for the detection of 27 benzodiazepines and metabolites and zolpidem in hair was established and validated using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The drugs and their metabolites in hair were extracted using methanol, filtered and injected on the LC-MS/MS. The following validation parameters of the method were satisfactory: selectivity, linearity, matrix effect, recovery, process efficiency, intra- and inter-assay precision and accuracy and processed sample stability. The limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) were the total drug detected from the sample. The LODs ranged from 0.005 ng (zolpidem) to 0.5 ng (bromazepam and chlordiazepoxide) and the LOQs were 0.25 ng in every analyte except for bromazepam and chlordiazepoxide, for which they were 0.5 ng. The developed method was successfully applied to five legal cases involving use of benzodiazepines and zolpidem and to an animal study on drug incorporation into hair. Diazepam and its three metabolites, as well as lorazepam, were detected in hair from both the multiple- and single-dose administration groups of lean Zucker rats. The concentration of diazepam was higher than those of its metabolites in both dark grey and white hair from the multiple-dose administration groups, with the mean concentration ranges from 0.16 to 0.51 ng/mg and from 0.10 to 0.24 ng/mg, respectively. The mean concentration ranges of lorazepam were from 0.05 to 0.37 ng/mg in dark grey hair and from 0.11 to 0.45 ng/mg in white hair from the multiple-dose administration groups. Hair pigmentation did not have any significant effect on the degree of the deposition of drugs and their metabolites in hair.",

The population in this 12-month study consisted of 528 community-dwelling subjects aged 65 years or older with a history of at least one fall. The subjects were divided retrospectively into three groups according to the use of any FRID, any psychotropic drug, and benzodiazepine or related drug (BZD/BZDRD). The subjects in the intervention group (IG) ceasing the drug use were compared with the subjects in IG and the control group (CG) not ceasing the use of the corresponding type of drugs during the intervention period. Falls were recorded from medical records. For the year after the 12-month intervention the relative risk ratio (with 95% confidence intervals=CI) for controls in CG compared with the withdrawal group in IG was 8.26 (1.07-63.73) among the users of psychotropics and 8.11 (1.03-63.60) among the users of BZDs/BZDRDs. Withdrawal of psychotropics, especially BZDs/BZDRDs may have played an important role by lowering the risk of falls requiring medical treatment during the year after the 12-month multifactorial intervention.",

    "20": "The inclusion of hyperspectral imaging systems in the manufacturing and development of pharmaceutical products is allowing a successful improvement in the quality control of solid dosage forms. The correct distribution not only of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) but also of the rest of excipients is essential to assure the correct behavior of the tablet when ingested. This is especially relevant in tablets with low content of potent APIs, in which the prescribed intake dosage frequently corresponds to half-a-tablet. Therefore, the aim of this work is to study the surface distribution of the compounds in tablets with low API content. The proposed procedure includes the scanning of the tablet surface using near infrared hyperspectral spectroscopy in association with multivariate curve resolution (MCR) techniques to obtain selective pictures for each individual compound and to allow the fast assessment of their distribution in the measured surface. As an example, a set of commercial Lorazepam tablets (approximately 1% mass fraction of API, and four excipients) were analyzed. The results obtained show the capacity of the proposed methodology as an expedite approach to evaluate the uniformity of the contents between and within tablets. A method to estimate the homogeneity distribution of API in the two halves of the tablet is also proposed.",

The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), also known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), is expressed in activated immune cells such as macrophages, but also in a number of cancer cell lines such as those of breast cancer. There is an increasing clinical interest in TSPO expression as it has been proposed as a poor prognostic factor for survival in lymph-node negative breast cancer patients. This study aims to assess of the presence of neoplastic cell-associated TSPO and tumor macrophage-associated TSPO in mouse xenografts generated from the MDA-MB-231 and the MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines, as well as 25 different breast tumors originally derived from patient-tissue but propagated in mice using two antibodies, each specific to either the human or the murine form of TSPO. Autoradiography with the TSPO ligand [\u00b9\u2078F]DPA-714 and immunohistochemistry were also performed on the excised tumor tissues from the MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and one of the patient-derived xenografts (HBCx-12B). High TSPO expression (either cancer or stromal cell-associated, or both) was measured in 20/25 (80%) of the patient-derived breast cancer xenografts. [\u00b9\u2078F]DPA-714 showed displaceable binding to both the human and murine TSPO on tumor tissue sections. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that a significant portion of the tumor stromal TSPO expression colocalized with F4/80 positive macrophages cells. This study constitutes a first report of the tumor TSPO expression by mixed cell populations, and it may have important implications for cancer biology as well as for the development of imaging and therapeutic ligands targeted to TSPO.",

    "41": "\u03b3-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. The inhibitory action of GABA is mediated by the receptors present on the cell membrane and results in a reduction of neuronal excitability. At least three types of GABA receptors have been characterized. Table 1 summarizes some of the general properties of these three types of GABA receptors. GABAA receptors are ligand-gated chloride channels. They mediate fast inhibition and have a wide distribution throughout the central nervous system. GABAA receptors have a diverse molecular composition. At least 16 subunits in six groups have been identified. Pharmacologically, these receptors are antagonized by bicuculline. GABAA receptors are also the targets of many therapeutic compounds (such as general anaesthetics, sedative drugs, and alcohols). These compounds allosterically modulate GABAA receptor channel activities. GABAB receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily. The inhibition of GABAB receptors is mediated by indirect gating of either potassium or calcium channels. GABAB receptors are activated by baclofen and antagonized by phaclofen and saclofen. The subunits of GABAB receptors have recently been cloned. GABAC receptors are the newly identified member of the GABA receptor family. They are also linked to chloride channels, with distinct physiological and pharmacological properties. In contrast to the fast and transient responses elicited from GABAA receptors, GABAC receptors mediate slow and sustained responses. Pharmacologically, GABAC receptors are bicuculline- and baclofen-insensitive and are not modulated by many GABAA receptor modulators (such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates). GABA \u03c1 subunits are thought to participate in forming GABAC receptors on the neuronal membrane, but the exact molecular composition of these receptors is yet to be determined. GABAC receptors are expressed in many brain regions, with prominent distributions on retinal neurons, suggesting that these receptors play important roles in retinal signal processing.", 
    "42": "Combinations of positive modulators of benzodiazepine and neuroactive steroid sites on GABA(A) receptors have been shown to act in an additive or supra-additive manner depending on the endpoint under study, but they have not been assessed on experimentally induced conflict or drug self-administration. The present study examined the interactive effects of the benzodiazepine triazolam and the neuroactive steroid pregnanolone in a rhesus monkey conflict procedure (a model of anxiolysis) and on a progressive-ratio schedule of drug self-administration (a model of abuse potential). Both triazolam and pregnanolone decreased rates of nonsuppressed responding, whereas only triazolam consistently increased rates of suppressed responding (i.e., had an anticonflict effect). Fixed-ratio mixtures of triazolam and pregnanolone also decreased rates of nonsuppressed responding and did so in an additive manner. In contrast, mixtures of triazolam and pregnanolone produced either additive or supra-additive rate-increasing effects on suppressed responding, depending on the proportion of drugs in the mixture. Both triazolam and pregnanolone were self-administered significantly, and triazolam and pregnanolone mixtures had either proportion-dependent additive or infra-additive reinforcing effects. These results suggest that combinations of triazolam and pregnanolone may have enhanced anxiolytic effects with reduced behavioral disruption and abuse potential compared with either drug alone.", 
    "43": "Oral fluid is of increasing interest as an alternative sample matrix in drugs of abuse analysis. Compared to the conventional sample matrix blood, sample volumes of oral fluid are smaller and the concentrations of some drugs can be much lower. This imposes some restrictions on the analysis method, which has to be able to detect and quantify multiple analytes from a small sample volume at low concentrations. A sensitive multi-component method for quantitative determination of 50 drug compounds from oral fluid samples collected with the StatSure SalivaSampler\u2122 device was developed. The compounds analysed include cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, opioids, benzodiazepines and other psychoactive medicines. Both liquid-liquid-extraction (LLE) and solid-phase-extraction (SPE) are employed in the sample pre-treatment and the samples are analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with the mass selective detector (MSD) operating in either electron ionization (EI) or negative-ion chemical ionization (NICI) mode. The method was fully validated, and the validated parameters included linearity, selectivity, accuracy, precision, and extraction efficiency. Stability of the collected samples during storage at -18\u00b0C was also studied, and even after over a year's storage all analyte concentrations were more than 60% of the original concentrations. The described method is suitable for routine analysis of oral fluid samples and it has been applied to analysis of more than 4000 oral fluid samples collected anonymously from volunteer road users in Finland during 2007-2009 as a part of the EU project DRUID (Driving under the Influence of Drugs, Alcohol and Medicines).

    "49": "As current treatments for glioblastoma commonly fail to cure, the need for more effective therapeutic options is overwhelming. Here, we summarize experimental evidence in support of the suggestion that metformin and olanzepine have potential to enhance the cytotoxic effects of temozolomide, an alkylating chemotherapeutic agent commonly used to treat glioblastoma. Although the primary path leading to temozolomide-induced cell death is formation of O-6-methylguanine and apoptotic signalling triggered by O-6-methyl G:T mispairs, that apoptotic signalling goes through a step mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Metformin or olanzapine have been shown independently to enhance AMPK activation. Metformin to treat diabetes and olanzapine to treat psychiatric disorders are well tolerated and have been used clinically for many years. Thus it should be feasible to increase AMPK activation and add to the pro-apoptotic effects of temozolomide, by adding metformin and olanzapine to the therapeutic regimen. Clinical assessment of the potential benefit of such combined therapy against glioblastoma is warranted.", 
    "50": "The Bispectral Index System is a useful guide for timing of adequate intubation conditions in office-based pediatric general anesthesia without neuromuscular blockade. As the number of cases in the office-based setting increase, many clinicians opt to intubate patients without neuromuscular blockade to avoid airway complications associated with skeletal muscle relaxation. Conventionally, this technique is conducted using the traditional monitoring criteria of vital signs, end-tidal inhalation agents, as well as anesthesiologist timing and knowledge of the pharmacodynamics of the anesthetic agent to help determine the proper depth of anesthesia for adequate intubating conditions. This study retrospectively assesses the use of the Bispectral Index System (BIS) as a guide for timing of nonparalytic tracheal intubation in pediatric office-based general anesthesia. Anesthetic records for 168 children, American Society of Anesthesiology physical status I and II, and ranging in age from 18 months to 17 years were retrospectively analyzed. Intubation outcomes were based on 6 preset criteria to reflect the adequacy of the technique. The mean BIS value during the time of intubation was 34.7. There were no complications encountered. A BIS mean value of 34.7 provided adequate intubation conditions without muscle relaxation in office-based pediatric anesthesia without complications.",

Oral and intravenous MDZ areas under the plasma concentration-time curves were significantly increased by RTV or NFV and were decreased by rifampin. Irrespective of method of administration, RTV decreased net intestinal and hepatic CYP3A activity, whereas NFV decreased hepatic but not intestinal CYP3A activity. The magnitude of these DDIs was more accurately predicted using PI CYP3A inactivation parameters generated in sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes rather than human liver microsomes.",

It also decreased body temperature and LMA but increased HR and mean ABP after the first few administrations but these effects disappeared over the 20days of treatment. Following discontinuation, both morphine- and chlordiazepoxide-treated rats showed a dose-related decrease in food intake and loss of weight on days 2 and 3 of discontinuation. Morphine discontinuation also induced a nocturnal hypothermia and a diurnal hypertension (i.e. during the light phase) which lasted for 4-5days and also moderate diurnal increases in locomotor activity and heart rate over the first 3days of discontinuation. Chlordiazepoxide discontinuation induced small increases in telemetry parameters some of which, such as the effect on locomotor activity, lasted for more than 5days. The intensity and duration of effects for both substances were broadly dose-related.",

Because of the high consumption of benzodiazepines worldwide, this class of drugs and their metabolites are frequently present in both clinical and forensic cases. For these reasons, the analysis of benzodiazepines and their metabolites in biological fluids is of great interest to clinicians and forensic toxicologists. This paper reviews procedures for multi-analyte single-stage (LC-MS) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using different mass analyzers for the screening, identification and/or quantification of drugs, poisons and/or their metabolites in blood, plasma, serum or urine published since 2001.

Immune system alterations are a major cause of burn-induced mortality. We wanted to determine whether the BDZ, midazolam given daily at an anxiolytic dose, had any influence on the burn injury-induced inflammatory response in the blood and wound. Mice received a 15% total body surface area flame burn and received either midazolam 1 mg/kg i.p. or saline 0.1 ml daily. Blood and skin wounds were harvested 24 h after injection on post-burn day 2, 3, 7, or 8. Mice treated with midazolam had significantly lower serum IL-1\u03b2 (p=0.002), TNF-\u03b1 (p=0.002), IL-6 (p=0.016), IL-10 (p=0.009), and TGF-\u03b2 (p=0.004) than saline-treated mice, with little impact on serum chemokine levels. In the wound, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 were the only cytokines significantly influenced by the drug, being lower (p=0.018) and higher (p=0.006), respectively. The chemokines in the wound influenced significantly by midazolam were MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, and MIP-2 while MCP-1 and KC were not. There were more inflammatory cells at the burn wound margin in midazolam-treated mice on post-burn day 3. Although serum nitrate/nitrite was significantly increased by midazolam (p=0.03), both eNOS and iNOS mRNA expression in the wound were similar to the saline group. We found that midazolam given daily after burn injury significantly influenced the inflammatory response. The clinical implications of these findings on wound healing and shock following burn injury, especially larger burns, deserve further investigation.", 
    "79": "Psychotropics are widely prescribed in Alzheimer disease (AD) without regard to their pathobiological effects. Results summarize a comprehensive survey of psychotropic effects on messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression for 52 genes linked to AD. Pending future investigations, current data indicate that atypical antipsychotics, lithium, and fluoxetine reduce AD risk, whereas other drug classes promote risk. Risk may be attenuated by antipsychotics and lithium (down-regulate TNF), atypical antipsychotics (down-regulate TF), risperidone (down-regulates IL1B), olanzapine (up-regulates TFAM, down-regulates PRNP), fluoxetine (up-regulates CLU, SORCS1, NEDD9, GRN, and ECE1), and lithium coadministered with antipsychotics (down-regulates IL1B). Risk may be enhanced by neuroleptics (up-regulate TF), haloperidol (up-regulates IL1B and PION), olanzapine (down-regulates THRA and PRNP, up-regulates IL1A), and chlorpromazine, imipramine, maprotiline, fluvoxamine, and diazepam (up-regulate IL1B). There were no results for dextromethorphan-plus-quinidine. Fluoxetine effects on CLU, NEDD9, and GRN were statistically robust. Drug effects on specific variants, polymorphisms, genotypes, and other genes (CCR2, TF, and PRNP) are detailed. Translational AD risk applications and their limitations related to specific genes, mutations, variants, polymorphisms, genotypes, brain site, sex, clinical population, AD stage, and other factors are discussed. This report provides an initial summary and framework to understand the potential impact of psychotropic drugs on AD-relevant genes.", 
    "80": "Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are used commonly to treat anxiety disorders, have characteristic anxiogenic effects following acute administration. Treatment with anxiolytic benzodiazepines (BZs) may reduce these effects, although little is known about potential drug interactions. Our study evaluated acute anxiogenic-like effects of SSRIs, alone and combined with a BZ. Adult male BALB/c mice received fluoxetine (3.0-30.0mg/kg, i.p.) or citalopram (3.0-30.0mg/kg, i.p.) alone or in combination with diazepam (0.3-10.0mg/kg, i.p.), after which they were evaluated with the light/dark and open-field tests for anxiogenesis/anxiolysis. In addition, release of the stress hormone corticosterone was assessed following combined SSRI/BZ administration. In the light/dark and open-field tests, acute SSRIs produced a behavioral profile consistent with anxiogenesis, while diazepam produced an anxiolytic-like profile. Pre-treatment with diazepam (0.3-10mg/kg) reversed the effects of an anxiogenic-like dose of an SSRI (18mg/kg fluoxetine, 30mg/kg citalopram) in both light/dark and open-field tests. Diazepam, fluoxetine or citalopram, and their combination all significantly increased plasma corticosterone levels to the same degree. These findings suggest that a BZ-type drug can attenuate acute anxiogenic-like effects of an SSRI via a mechanism independent of corticosterone regulation.", 
    "81": "Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a devastating long-term disease for which a significant symptom is mania. Rodent models for mania include psychostimulant-induced hyperactivity and single gene alterations, such as in the Clock or DAT genes, but there is still a pressing need for additional models. Recently, our lab isolated a line of mice, termed Madison (MSN), that exhibit behavioral characteristics that may be analogous to symptoms of mania. In this study we quantified possible traits for mania and tested the response to common anti-BPD drugs in altering the behavioral profiles observed in this strain. Relative to other mouse lines, MSN mice showed significant elevations of in-cage hyperactivity levels, significant decreases in daytime sleep, and significant increases in time swimming in the forced swim test. In terms of sexual behavior, the MSN mice showed significantly higher number of mounts and a trend toward higher time mounting. In separate studies, olanzapine and lithium (or respective controls) were administered to MSN mice for at least 2weeks and response to treatments was evaluated. Olanzapine (1mg/kg/day) significantly decreased in-cage hyperactivity and significantly increased time sleeping. Lithium (0.2-0.4% in food) significantly decreased in-cage hyperactivity. Given the behavioral phenotypes and the response to anti-BPD treatments, we propose that MSN mice may provide a possible new model for understanding the neural and genetic basis of phenotypes related to mania and for developing pharmaceutical treatments.", 
    "82": "Insomnia is a common problem for people with chronic pain. Cortical GABAergic neurons are part of the neurobiological substrate that underlies homeostatic sleep regulation. In the present study, we confirmed that sciatic nerve ligation caused thermal hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia in mice. In this experimental model for neuropathic pain, we found an increase in wakefulness and a decrease in non-rapid eye movement sleep under a neuropathic pain-like state. Under these conditions, membrane-bound GABA (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid) transporters (GATs) on activated glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes were significantly increased in the cingulate cortex, and extracellular GABA levels in this area after depolarization were rapidly decreased by nerve injury. Furthermore, sleep disturbance induced by sciatic nerve ligation was improved by the intracingulate cortex injection of a GAT-3 inhibitor. These findings provide novel evidence that sciatic nerve ligation decreases extracellular-released GABA in the cingulate cortex of mice. These phenomena may, at least in part, explain the insomnia in patients with neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain-like stimuli suppress the GABAergic transmission with increased GABA (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid) transporters located on activated astrocytes in the cingulate cortex related to sleep disturbance.", 
    "83": "The rodent ventrobasal (VB) thalamus contains a relatively uniform population of thalamocortical (TC) neurons that receive glutamatergic input from the vibrissae and the somatosensory cortex, and inhibitory input from the nucleus reticularis thalami (nRT). In this study we describe \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptor-dependent slow outward currents (SOCs) in TC neurons that are distinct from fast inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) and tonic currents. SOCs occurred spontaneously or could be evoked by hypo-osmotic stimulus, and were not blocked by tetrodotoxin, removal of extracellular Ca(2+) or bafilomycin A1, indicating a non-synaptic, non-vesicular GABA origin. SOCs were more common in TC neurons of the VB compared with the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, and were rarely observed in nRT neurons, whilst SOC frequency in the VB increased with age. Application of THIP, a selective agonist at \u03b4-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors, occluded SOCs, whereas the benzodiazepine site inverse agonist \u03b2-CCB had no effect, but did inhibit spontaneous and evoked IPSCs. In addition, the occurrence of SOCs was reduced in mice lacking the \u03b4-subunit, and their kinetics were also altered. The anti-epileptic drug vigabatrin increased SOC frequency in a time-dependent manner, but this effect was not due to reversal of GABA transporters. Together, these data indicate that SOCs in TC neurons arise from astrocytic GABA release, and are mediated by \u03b4-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors. Furthermore, these findings suggest that the therapeutic action of vigabatrin may occur through the augmentation of this astrocyte-neuron interaction, and highlight the importance of glial cells in CNS (patho) physiology.",

To identify patients who were co-administered ECC or other contraceptives, a questionnaire was sent to the physician who ordered serum monitoring of olanzapine for women aged 18-40 years during an 18 month period. The physicians were asked to provide information about contraceptive use and smoking habits. When questionnaires were returned by the physicians, the respective serum concentration data were included in the analysis. Patients were stratified into users of ECC, progestogen-based contraceptives (PBC) or no contraceptives. Dose-adjusted serum concentrations of olanzapine and the metabolite N-desmethyl olanzapine were compared between the subgroups.",

In this work, we report and characterize a novel fluorescent benzodiazepine antagonist of the type 1 cholecystokinin receptor (3-(3-(7-fluoro-1-(2-isopropyl(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)-2-oxoethyl)-2,4-dioxo-5-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[b][1,4]-diazepin-3-yl)ureido)benzoic acid) that can be used as a receptor ligand in a fluorescence polarization assay, which is ideally suited for the identification of small molecule allosteric modulators of this physiologically important receptor. By binding directly to the small molecule-docking region within the helical bundle of this receptor, this indicator can be displaced by many small molecule candidate drugs, even those that might not affect the binding of an orthosteric cholecystokinin-like peptide ligand. The biological, pharmacological, and fluorescence properties of this reagent are described, and proof-of-concept is provided in a fluorescence polarization assay utilizing this fluorescent benzodiazepine ligand.",

This report was designed to review drug-related deaths due to cocaine, and the concomitant use of other drugs/medications. A retrospective review of drug deaths at the Bexar County Medical Examiner's Office in San Antonio, Texas, was undertaken for cases where cocaine was one of the drugs implicated in causing death. Analysis was performed comparing the concentrations of cocaine and benzoylecgonine present and the absence or presence of other drugs. The data obtained showed that cocaine was toxic over a large range with deaths occurring at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 78 mg/L. Analyses also indicated an increased lethality when cocaine is used in combination with ethanol, heroin, opiates, and antidepressant/antipsychotic medications, which is consistent with previous reports and research. Antihistamine data showed that there may be relationship between increased toxicity and co-ingestion, although more research is necessary.",

Management of delirium involves ensuring safety, improving functioning, identifying and treating the illness underlying the delirium, and use of antipsychotics or benzodiazepines to control behavioural symptoms and prevent mortality. Haloperidol continues to be the most commonly used antipsychotic in delirium. However, in recent times data have emerged which suggest that atypical antipsychotics may be as efficacious as haloperidol in the treatment of delirium. This review intends to review the data with respect to usefulness of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of delirium. Besides atypical antipsychotics, data with respect to another group of medications - cholinesterase inhibitors are also reviewed. Electronic and manual searches were conducted to identify all the relevant studies and case reports/case series. Evidence suggests that risperidone, olanzapine and quetiapine are as efficacious as haloperidol in the treatment of delirium but have lesser side effects. Data for other atypical antipsychotics are scarce. The data on cholinesterase inhibitors for treatment and prevention of delirium are beginning to accumulate, but do not seem to be convincing. Our review suggests that risperidone, olanzapine and quetiapine are good alternatives to haloperidol in the treatment of delirium.",

    "100": "This was a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, double-dummy, comparative study. A total of 48 patients were enrolled, of which 45 patients completed the study. Patients who entered the study were required to take the study drug orally once daily at bedtime for two weeks. Each patient kept a sleep diary and answered a questionnaire. We used these documents to measure and evaluate changes from baseline to Week 2 in sleep latency, duration and quality of sleep, the number of awakenings and incidence of rebound insomnia.", 
    "101": "The data revealed a significant decrease in sleep latency from baseline to Week 2 for patients receiving zaleplon 10 mg and zolpidem 10 mg. Patients receiving zaleplon exhibited a marginally greater, but not statistically significant, reduction in sleep latency than those who received zolpidem. There was no significant difference in the frequency of adverse effects between the zaleplon and zolpidem groups; however, during this clinical trial there was one lethal event caused by a traffic accident in the zaleplon group.", 
    "102": "There was no significant difference between zaleplon and zolpidem in the efficacy of reducing sleep latency or adverse effects. A large pharmacovigilance study is needed before concluding that either zolpidem or zaleplon is free from next-day residual effects.",

Admission numbers including those of adolescent and adult substance users were compared for both study periods. Study samples comparing demographic profile, admission status, length of stay, psychopathology, treatment requirements and referral pattern to other disciplines between MA users and non-users were collected for the 2006 period.", 
    "105": "There was a significant (p <0.01) increase in adolescent substance user admissions between the study periods. A significant (p <0.01) increase in adolescent and adult MA user admissions was also noted. MA users were significantly (p = 0.04) younger than non-MA users, whilst the former presented mainly with psychotic features associated with aggression, requiring involuntary admission of an average of 8 weeks. MA users required significantly (p = 0.007) more benzodiazepines compared to non-MA users.", 
    "106": "Although MA use is relatively recent to the Western Cape, its adverse psychiatric effects and consequences have become a major challenge. These effects in both adolescent and adult patient populations and the associated impact on psychiatric services demand urgent intervention strategies as well as prospective study.", 
    "107": "GABA(A) receptors are members of the Cys-loop family of neurotransmitter receptors, proteins which are responsible for fast synaptic transmission, and are the site of action of wide range of drugs. Recent work has shown that Cys-loop receptors are present on immune cells, but their physiological roles and the effects of drugs that modify their function in the innate immune system are currently unclear. We are interested in how and why anaesthetics increase infections in intensive care patients; a serious problem as more than 50% of patients with severe sepsis will die. As many anaesthetics act via GABA(A) receptors, the aim of this study was to determine if these receptors are present on immune cells, and could play a role in immunocompromising patients.", 
    "108": "We demonstrate, using RT-PCR, that monocytes express GABA(A) receptors constructed of \u03b11, \u03b14, \u03b22, \u03b31 and/or \u03b4 subunits. Whole cell patch clamp electrophysiological studies show that GABA can activate these receptors, resulting in the opening of a chloride-selective channel; activation is inhibited by the GABA(A) receptor antagonists bicuculline and picrotoxin, but not enhanced by the positive modulator diazepam. The anaesthetic drugs propofol and thiopental, which can act via GABA(A) receptors, impaired monocyte function in classic immunological chemotaxis and phagocytosis assays, an effect reversed by bicuculline and picrotoxin.", 
    "109": "Our results show that functional GABA(A) receptors are present on monocytes with properties similar to CNS GABA(A) receptors. The functional data provide a possible explanation as to why chronic propofol and thiopental administration can increase the risk of infection in critically ill patients: their action on GABA(A) receptors inhibits normal monocyte behaviour. The data also suggest a potential solution: monocyte GABA(A) receptors are insensitive to diazepam, thus the use of benzodiazepines as an alternative anesthetising agent may be advantageous where infection is a life threatening problem.", 
    "110": "Propofol is a widely used drug in anesthesia practice, and its pharmacological characteristics are well known. However, propofol is not known for neuromuscular effects. As part of clinical neuromuscular monitoring, the neuromuscular responses to train-of-four (TOF) stimulation were monitored and recorded. We observed, in two cases of balanced anesthesia maintained by desflurane and fentanyl, that administration of a small dose of propofol during almost complete recovery from rocuronium in two patients resulted in marked decreases of both T1 (first twitch response of the TOF) and the TOF ratio. This neuromuscular block dissipated in both patients without any subsequent neuromuscular effects. These two observations provide visual confirmation of the possible impact of propofol on recovery from a rocuronium neuromuscular blockade.", 
    "111": "The use of herbal and complementary medicine is common. Many herbal products are known to produce serious adverse effects. Borage oil is derived from the seeds of the borage plant (Borago officinalis) an abundant source of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), and Borage oil has been promoted as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, diabetic neuropathy, and menopause-related symptoms. We report a case of status epilepticus in a patient who consumed borage oil for one week.", 
    "112": "The propensity to develop an anxiety disorder is thought to be determined by genetic and environmental factors. Here we investigated the relationship between a genetic predisposition to trait anxiety and experience-based learned fear in a psychopathological mouse model. Male CD-1 mice selectively bred for either high (HAB), or normal (NAB) anxiety-related behaviour on the elevated plus maze were subjected to classical fear conditioning. During conditioning both mouse lines showed increased fear responses as assessed by freezing behaviour. However, 24 h later, HAB mice displayed more pronounced conditioned responses to both a contextual or cued stimulus when compared with NAB mice. Interestingly, 6 h and already 1 h after fear conditioning, freezing levels were high in HAB mice but not in NAB mice. These results suggest that trait anxiety determines stronger fear memory and/or a weaker ability to inhibit fear responses in the HAB line. The enhanced fear response of HAB mice was attenuated by treatment with either the \u03b1(2,3,5)-subunit selective benzodiazepine partial agonist L-838,417, corticosterone or the selective neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist L-822,429. Overall, the HAB mouse line may represent an interesting model (i) for identifying biological factors underlying misguided conditioned fear responses and (ii) for studying novel anxiolytic pharmacotherapies for patients with fear-associated disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder and phobias.", 
    "113": "Critically ill patients are prescribed sedatives and analgesics to decrease pain and anxiety, improve patient-ventilator dyssynchrony and ensure patient safety. These medications may themselves lead to delirium and ICU-acquired weakness, which are associated with worse clinical outcomes. This review will focus on the epidemiology of these two disease processes and discuss strategies aimed at reducing these devastating complications of critical illness.", 
    "114": "Delirium and ICU-acquired weakness are associated with longer hospital stay, increased cost and decreased quality of life after discharge from the ICU. Delirium has also shown to be associated with increased mortality. Strategies aimed at reducing sedative exposure through protocols and coordination of daily sedation and ventilator cessation trials, avoiding benzodiazepines in favor of alternative sedative regimens and early mobilization of patients have all shown to significantly improve patient outcomes.", 
    "115": "Delirium and ICU-acquired weakness are complications of critical illness associated with worse clinical outcomes and functional decline in survivors. An evidence-based approach based on the following tenets - minimization of sedative medication, particularly benzodiazepines, delirium monitoring and management and early mobilization may mitigate these complications.", 
    "116": "Traumatic brain injury is the leading cause of death in young patients and stroke is the leading cause of major disability in elderly patients. Both injuries are often followed by cerebral plasticity changes and increased intracerebral pressure (ICP). Aim of the review is to present current knowledge about amphetamines and other therapeutics concerning the recovery of brain injury based on contemporary findings.", 
    "117": "On the one hand beneficial effects for cognitive and physical outcome after brain injury by coupling amphetamine with physical therapy could be demonstrated; on the other hand its efficacy was shown in only two out of 10 clinical trials.", 
    "118": "Impairment after brain injury is reduced if adequate early treatment is established. On the basis of current findings amphetamine after brain injury cannot be recommended. In patients with an increased ICP the maintenance of an adequate cerebral perfusion pressure is required. In patients with increased ICP under controlled ventilation, the combination of ketamine with, for example, a short-acting benzodiazepine and opioid or methohexital is equally well tolerated. Ketamine decreases ICP without lowering blood pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure. Its neuroprotective property might reduce the exacerbation of brain injury following N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor activation, neuronal apoptosis and systemic inflammatory responses.",

Mitogens and oncogenic signals strongly activate this cellular MAP kinase pathway, thereby passing down proliferative, survival, chemoresistance, invasive, and angiogenic signals in tumor cells. Recently, several pharmacologic small molecule inhibitors of this pathway have been developed. Among them, the BMK1 inhibitor XMD8-92 blocks cellular BMK1 activation and significantly suppresses tumor growth in lung and cervical tumor models and is well tolerated in animals. On the other hand, MEK5 inhibitors, BIX02188, BIX02189, and compound 6, suppress cellular MEK5 activity, but no data exist to date on their effectiveness in animals.", 
    "120": "Acute seizures are readily recognizable episodes requiring urgent treatment. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of suppository use of rectal diazepam solution [Stesolid rectal tube (SRT), Alpharma, Inc., Lierskogen, Norway] with those of intravenous diazepam (IVD), Li Ta Pharma Co, Ltd., Taichung, Taiwan for control of acute seizures in children with intractable epilepsy.", 
    "121": "Subjects were patients, aged 1-18 years, with intractable epilepsy under at least three kinds of antiepileptic treatments. Caregivers were trained to rectally administer SRT or IVD (dosage varying from 0.2 to 0.5mg per kilogram of body weight) and to monitor respiration condition, seizure severity, and adverse drug effects.", 
    "122": "Among the 24 subjects, 9 males and 15 females, treated for a period of 3 months, the ages ranged from 2 to 18 years, with a mean of 9.1 years. Seizure types were generalized tonic and/or clonic. Seizure frequency varied from once per week to 20 times per day. Twenty-one (87.5%) of them had mental retardation and/or developmental delay, and 103 of the 127 (81.1%) IVD administrations and 90 of the 103 (87.3%) SRT administrations resulted in rapid cessation of seizures within 10 minutes. Each first dose failed to control seizures in 24 and 13 episodes, respectively. A second dose of IVD achieved cessation of seizure in 21 of the 24 episodes and a second dose of SRT in 12 of the 13 episodes within another 10 minutes. Four episodes (3 with rectal IVD and 1 with SRT) of prolonged seizure beyond 20 minutes needed IVD injection at our emergency room. Sedation occurred in 17% of patients, which was attributed to IVD in 8% and SRT in 9% of patients. No respiratory depression was attributable to IVD or SRT. There was no significant statistical difference in efficacy and safety between these two forms of diazepam.",

These metal compounds undergo the various types of reactions in good yields and exclusively depending on the nature of substituents R(1) and R(3). Thus, metal compounds 1a-c carrying alkyl substituents R(1) and R(3) form 3H-benzodiazepines 6a-c after electrophilic quench of the intermediate cyclic anion 7 in a 7-endo-trig electrocyclic reaction with a mo\u0308bius aromatic transition structure 1(-)-TS. Similarly, a benzothienyl derivative 5n is converted into diazepine 6d. Potassium compounds 1d-h, which are N-methyl and aryl substituted at R(3), form 1,2-dihydrophthalazines 8a-e in a predominantly charge-controlled 6-exo-trig cyclization reaction. In contrast, aryl-aryl-substituted systems 5i-m did not lead to cyclic products upon deprotonation, but the intermediate open-chain metal compounds 1i-m were trapped by acid chlorides at N1 to yield the hydrazides 10a-e. We interpret thermodynamics and kinetics of these reactions in the context of the Baldwin rules on the basis of quantum chemical calculations and discuss the transition structures considering the results of NICS and NBO-charge calculations. Examples of the products 6, 8, and 10 could be characterized by X-ray diffraction.", 
    "125": "The pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs) are naturally occurring antitumor antibiotics and a PBD dimer (SJG-136, SG2000) is in Phase II trials. SG2000 is a propyldioxy linked PBD dimer which binds sequence selectively in the minor groove of DNA forming DNA interstrand and intrastrand cross-linked adducts, and also mono-adducts depending on sequence. SG2057 is the corresponding dimer containing a pentyldioxy linkage. SG2057 has multilog differential in vitro cytotoxicity against a panel of human tumour cell lines with a mean GI(50) of 212 pM. The agent is highly efficient at producing DNA interstrand cross-links in cells which form rapidly and persist over a 48\u00a0h period. Significant antitumor activity was demonstrated in several human tumor xenograft models. Cures were obtained in a LOX-IMVI melanoma model following a single administration and dose-dependent activity, including regression responses, observed in SKOV-3 ovarian and HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia models following repeat dose schedules. In the advanced stage LS174T model, SG2057 administered either as a single dose, or in two repeat dose schedules, was superior to irinotecan. SG2057 is therefore a highly active antitumor agent, with more potent in vitro activity and superior in vivo activity to SG2000, warranting further development.", 
    "126": "\u03b1-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid-type (AMPA-type) glutamate receptors (AMPARs) play an important role in plasticity at central synapses. Although there is anatomical evidence for AMPAR expression in the peripheral nervous system, the functional role of such receptors in vivo is not clear. To address this issue, we generated mice specifically lacking either of the key AMPAR subunits, GluA1 or GluA2, in peripheral, pain-sensing neurons (nociceptors), while preserving expression of these subunits in the central nervous system. Nociceptor-specific deletion of GluA1 led to disruption of calcium permeability and reduced capsaicin-evoked activation of nociceptors. Deletion of GluA1, but not GluA2, led to reduced mechanical hypersensitivity and sensitization in models of chronic inflammatory pain and arthritis. Further analysis revealed that GluA1-containing AMPARs regulated the responses of nociceptors to painful stimuli in inflamed tissues and controlled the excitatory drive from the periphery into the spinal cord. Consequently, peripherally applied AMPAR antagonists alleviated inflammatory pain by specifically blocking calcium-permeable AMPARs, without affecting physiological pain or eliciting central side effects. These findings indicate an important pathophysiological role for calcium-permeable AMPARs in nociceptors and may have therapeutic implications for the treatment chronic inflammatory pain states.", 
    "127": "There are no controlled human studies to determine the efficacy of benzodiazepines or antipsychotic medications for prevention or treatment of acute cocaine toxicity. The only available controlled data are from animal models and these studies have reported inconsistent benefits. The objective of this study was to quantify the reported efficacy of benzodiazepines and antipsychotic medication for the prevention of mortality due to cocaine poisoning. We conducted a systematic review to identify English language articles describing experiments that compared a benzodiazepine or antipsychotic medication to placebo for the prevention of acute cocaine toxicity in an animal model. We then used these articles in a meta-analysis with a random-effects model to quantify the absolute risk reduction observed in these experiments. We found 10 articles evaluating antipsychotic medications and 15 articles evaluating benzodiazepines. Antipsychotic medications reduced the risk of death by 27% (95% CI, 15.2%-38.7%) compared to placebo and benzodiazepines reduced the risk of death by 52% (42.8%-60.7%) compared to placebo. Both treatments showed evidence of a dose-response effect, and no experiment found a statistically significant increase in risk of death. We conclude that both benzodiazepines and antipsychotic medications are effective for the prevention of lethality from cocaine toxicity in animal models.", 
    "128": "A fast, sensitive and selective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the determination of alfentanil and midazolam in human plasma has been developed and validated. Alfentanil and midazolam were extracted from plasma using a mixed-mode cation exchange solid phase extraction method, with recoveries of both compounds greater than 80% at 3 different concentrations (1, 10 and 100ng/ml). Compounds were analyzed on a C(18) column with a water and methanol mobile phase gradient with acetic acid as an additive, at a flow rate of 0.3ml/min. The working assay range was linear from 0.25 to 100ng/ml for each compound. The signal to noise ratio was 80 and 40 for alfentanil and midazolam, respectively, at the lowest concentration calibration standard, with less than 10% matrix suppression by human plasma at this concentration. Alfentanil and midazolam were stable in human plasma during storage at -80\u00b0C, processing, and analysis. The procedure was validated and applied to the analysis of plasma samples from healthy human subjects administered oral and intravenous alfentanil and midazolam.", 
    "129": "I.c.v. administration of the octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), a peptide derived from diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI), induces anorexigenic and anxiogenic-like actions in rodents. We have recently shown that, in goldfish, i.c.v. injection of ODN also reduces food consumption via the metabotropic endozepine receptor. However, there is little information regarding the structure of DBI and the psychophysiological roles of endozepines in fish. Therefore, in the present study, we isolated and cloned a cDNA encoding goldfish DBI. The deduced sequence exhibits high similarity with non-mammalian DBIs, and we investigated the effect of homologous ODN on psychomotor activity in goldfish. i.c.v. injection of synthetic goldfish ODN at 10 pmol/g body weight (BW) stimulated locomotor activity. Since intact goldfish placed in a tank with both black and white background areas prefers the black compartment, we developed a method for measuring the time taken for fish to move from the black to the white area. I.c.v. administration of diazepam (35 and 350 pmol/g BW) decreased, whereas i.c.v. administration of ODN (10 pmol/g BW) or the central-type benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist FG-7142 (9 pmol/g BW) increased the time taken to move from the black to the white background area. The anxiogenic-like effect of ODN was blocked by the central-type benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (100 pmol/g BW), but was not affected by the metabotropic endozepine receptor antagonist cyclo1-8[d-Leu(5)]octapeptide (100 pmol/g BW). These data indicate that ODN can potently affect locomotor and psychomotor activities in goldfish and that this action is mediated via the central-type benzodiazepine receptor-signaling pathway.", 
    "130": "Two new methods based on cloud point extraction (CPE) technique were developed and optimized for the extraction and preconcentration of oxazepam from human urine, as an azo or fluorescent derivative. The first method is a spectrophotometric one, which is based on the acid hydrolysis of the oxazepam to a benzophenone, diazotization of the benzophenone, and then the coupling with oxine to form an azo dye. The second method is a spectrofluorimetric one, which involves reduction of the target compound using Zn\u00b0/HCl at room temperature with the formation of a highly fluorescent derivative. The main factors affecting the chemical reactions and CPE were investigated and optimized systematically. Under optimum experimental conditions, the calibration graphs were linear in the range of 0.1 to 1.5 (0.05 to 2.0) \u00b5g/ml with correlation coefficients of 0.9989 (0.9985), for the CPE-spectrophotometric (CPE-spectrofluorimetric) method. The limit of detection was found to be 0.034 (0.018) \u00b5g/ml and the relative standard deviation was calculated to be 1.35 (2.52)%. Recoveries in the spiked samples ranged from 87 to 94%. Finally, the proposed methods were applied to the determination of oxazepam in human urine.",

    "133": "The review focuses on new drug treatment. The treatment of tonic-clonic status epilepticus is usually divided into three stages. In the first stage (stage of early status epilepticus), buccal midazolam has become an important out-of-hospital treatment option. In the second stage (stage of established status epilepticus) modern treatment choices include valproate, levetiracetam and lacosamide. In the third stage (stage of refractory status epilepticus), a variety of anaesthetics and nonpharmacological therapies can be administered. Treatment should also be focused on the causes of status epilepticus, and immunological therapy is sometimes given in cryptogenic refractory status epilepticus.",

In stage 2 and stage 3 of status epilepticus, the therapies have almost invariably been assessed in open studies only, and there is a need for multicentre randomized controlled therapy comparisons.", 
    "135": "Dextromethorphan (DXM) has unique toxicity that may be difficult to diagnose. We present a case of a young woman who presented to our emergency department (ED) initially diagnosed with recurrent seizures. Paramedics brought a 19-year-old woman to the ED. Witnesses noted \"shaking,\" which the patient did not recall. The patient denied fever, antecedent trauma, or neurological complaint. She was recently administered lamotrigine for bipolar disorder. She was a former alcoholic with no history of developing withdrawal. She admitted to marijuana use but denied use of any other illicit substances. Her vital signs and physical examination were unremarkable. She had a normal brain computed tomography, electrocardiogram, and laboratory evaluation. There was no alcohol detected. Her urine drug screen was negative for opiates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, amphetamines, barbiturates, phencyclidine, and tricyclic antidepressants. She was diagnosed with new-onset seizure and discharged home. No abnormalities were seen in the brain magnetic resonance imaging scan and electroencephalogram. She was scheduled for a cardiac syncope workup, but never followed through. Two months later, she presented to the hospital again for a similar complaint. Coworkers reported witnessing sudden tonic-clonic movements and confusion. On ED presentation, the patient was tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 beats/min and had horizontal nystagmus. She was alert with a flat affect. She did not recall events but answered questions appropriately. Repeat radiographic and laboratory evaluations were normal including urine drug screen and computed tomography. Upon questioning, she admitted to abusing DXM for the past several months. A serum DXM level at this time was 988.3 ng/mL. She was admitted to the hospital for 24 hours without sequelae. All further diagnostic testing was cancelled, and she was referred to a drug rehabilitation program. Abuse of DXM is increasing in incidence. The serum level of our patient was almost 10-fold greater than the reported therapeutic level. The toxicity of DXM is unique, and abuse should be considered in all patients presenting to the ED with new-onset seizure. Dextromethorphan abuse should be considered in young adults who present with previously undiagnosed seizure activity.",

Laboratory screens were conducted on preserved blood using ELISA testing for cannabis metabolite and methylamphetamines and a fully validated LC-MS/MS method for 105 drugs including THC, amphetamines, opioids, benzodiazepines, antidepressants and antipsychotics and a number of other psychoactive substances using a minimum of two transitions per drug. Conventional GC-testing for ethanol was used to screen and quantify the presence of alcohol. 1714 drivers were tested and showed alcohol in 29% (\u2265 0.01 g/100mL) and drugs in 35%. The positive rate for the three drugs prohibited by legislation was 12.5%. The prevalence of THC, MA and MDMA was 9.8%, 3.1%, and 0.8%, respectively. The range of THC concentrations in blood was 2-42 ng/mL (median 7) of which 70% had a concentration of 10 ng/mL or higher. The range of concentrations for MA and MDMA was 0.02-0.4 and 0.03-0.3mg/L (median for both drugs was 0.05 mg/L). Drugs of any type were detected in 35% of cases.

    "141": "Baicalein (BA), one of the main flavonoids obtained from the Chinese medicinal herb Scutellaria baicalensis, usually exerts several pharmacological effects. In the central nervous system (CNS), BA exerts a protective effect on neurons against several neuronal insults among other effects, but it is not clear if this effect is due to its metabolite, baicalin. The purpose of the present study was to assess the anxiolytic-like and related properties of BA following its central administration (i.c.v.) in mice. BA (0.02, 0.2pmol) exerted an anxiolytic-like effect at low doses, increasing the time spent in open arms and the head-dipping whereas reducing the stretched-attend postures in the elevated plus-maze. BA also increased the duration of ether-induced sleep without affecting the pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced convulsions. In addition, pretreatment with flumazenil (FMZ), PTZ, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and dl-p-chlorophenilalanine ethyl ester (PCPA) were conducted in order to investigate its mechanism of action. PTZ and DHEAS, but not FMZ or PCPA, antagonized the BA's anxiolytic-like effect. Taken together our results showed that BA, when directly injected into the CNS, promotes anxiolytic-like and sedative effects, pharmacological activities dependent on GABAergic non-benzodiazepine sites but not on the 5-HT system.", 
    "142": "The mitochondrial permeability transition is an increase of permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane to ions and solutes with an exclusion size of about 1500Da. It is generally accepted that the permeability transition is due to opening of a high-conductance channel, the permeability transition pore. Although the molecular nature of the permeability transition pore remains undefined, a great deal is known about its regulation and role in pathophysiology. This review specifically covers the characterization of the permeability transition pore by chemical modification of specific residues through photoirradiation of mitochondria after treatment with porphyrins. The review also illustrates the basic principles of the photodynamic effect and the mechanisms of phototoxicity and discusses the unique properties of singlet oxygen generated by specific porphyrins in discrete mitochondrial domains. These experiments provided remarkable information on the role, interactions and topology of His and Cys residues in permeability transition pore modulation and defined an important role for the outer membrane 18kDa translocator protein (formerly known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor) in regulation of the permeability transition.", 
    "143": "The second generation antipsychotic drugs are effective treatments for psychotic disorders. Many of these compounds, including the drug olanzapine, have been associated with metabolic side-effects, including weight gain, impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, which increase the risk of developing cardiometabolic disorders. Rodent models of olanzapine-induced metabolic side-effects have been used to study the physiology of these effects, but only at a single time point after drug treatment. The purpose of the present study was to examine longitudinal changes with chronic antipsychotic drug treatment. Adult female rats were treated with either olanzapine (15 mg/kg) or vehicle for five consecutive days each week, followed by a 48 h washout period. Animals were then challenged with either olanzapine (15 mg/kg) or vehicle, and fasting glucose and insulin values were recorded, as well as glucose clearance in the glucose tolerance test. Treatment with olanzapine was continued for 10 weeks, with weekly tests of metabolic indices. Rats treated acutely with olanzapine showed both glucose dysregulation and insulin resistance; for the group treated during the week with olanzapine, these effects did not change by the end of ten weeks of treatment.

The aim of this study was to determine the influence of vinyl polymer coating on the in vitro delivery characteristics of intranasal lorazepam microparticles. A series of four, similarly sized (ca. 10 \u03bcm), lorazepam-rich microparticles with different polymer coats were generated. The absorption of the polymer coats appeared to disrupt lorazepam solid state dimer formation in the microparticles, which manifested in a reduction in drug melting point. Mildly cohesive particles (aerodynamic diameter of 32 \u03bcm) that allowed rapid drug release (ca. 80% in 5 min) were generated when partially hydrolysed PVA dominated the microparticle coat, whilst fully hydrolysed PVA reduced particle cohesion and retarded drug release (ca. 15% release in 5 min). Infrared analysis showed that the properties of the microparticles were dictated by the strength of the hydrogen bonding in the polymer coat and not the strength of coat adsorption that was facilitated by hydrogen bond formation between the hydroxyl groups of the PVA and the hydroxyl group at position C3 of the lorazepam diazepine ring.",

    "182": "Duloxetine, a potent reuptake inhibitor of serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine, is effective for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic neuropathic pain, stress urinary incontinence, generalized anxiety disorder and fibromyalgia. Duloxetine achieves a maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) of approximately 47\u2009ng/mL (40\u2009mg twice-daily dosing) to 110\u2009ng/mL (80\u2009mg twice-daily dosing) approximately 6 hours after dosing. The elimination half-life of duloxetine is approximately 10-12 hours and the volume of distribution is approximately 1640\u2009L. The goal of this paper is to provide a review of the literature on intrinsic and extrinsic factors that may impact the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine with a focus on concomitant medications and their clinical implications. Patient demographic characteristics found to influence the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine include sex, smoking status, age, ethnicity, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 genotype, hepatic function and renal function. Of these, only impaired hepatic function or severely impaired renal function warrant specific warnings or dose recommendations. Pharmacokinetic results from drug interaction studies show that activated charcoal decreases duloxetine exposure, and that CYP1A2 inhibition increases duloxetine exposure to a clinically significant degree. Specifically, following oral administration in the presence of fluvoxamine, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and C(max) of duloxetine significantly increased by 460% (90% CI 359, 584) and 141% (90% CI 93, 200), respectively. In addition, smoking is associated with a 30% decrease in duloxetine concentration. The exposure of duloxetine with CYP2D6 inhibitors or in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers is increased to a lesser extent than that observed with CYP1A2 inhibition and does not require a dose adjustment. In addition, duloxetine increases the exposure of drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6, but not CYP1A2. Pharmacodynamic study results indicate that duloxetine may enhance the effects of benzodiazepines, but not alcohol or warfarin. An increase in gastric pH produced by histamine H(2)-receptor antagonists or antacids did not impact the absorption of duloxetine. While duloxetine is generally well tolerated, it is important to be knowledgeable about the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions between duloxetine and drugs that inhibit CYP1A2 or drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 enzymes.",

    "192": "Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is iatrogenic (drug-induced); hence the best strategy is prevention. Try to limit exposure to any dopamine receptor blocking agents (DRBAs) if possible. These agents may be unavoidable in some psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, but alternative therapies can be used in many situations, such as in the treatment of depression, anxiety, gastrointestinal conditions, and other neurologic conditions, including migraines and sleep disorders. When DRBAs are necessary, physicians should prescribe the smallest possible dose and try to taper and stop the drug at the earliest signs of TD. Abrupt cessation should be avoided, as this can worsen symptoms of TD. Always discuss and document the possibility of TD as an adverse effect when starting patients on DRBAs. If TD is mild and tolerable, the withdrawal of the offending agent is possible, and exposure to DRBAs was short, physicians should consider avoiding treatment and waiting for spontaneous recovery. When treatment is necessary, tetrabenazine (TBZ) is considered a potential first-line agent and is known to be one of the most effective drugs in treating TD, but it is expensive and adverse effects such as depression, akathisia and parkinsonism frequently occur. Therefore, second-line agents with better tolerability profiles are often tried first in practice. These include amantadine, benzodiazepines, beta-blockers, and levetiracetam. When using TBZ, adverse effects should be aggressively monitored. (Depression often can be managed with antidepressants, for instance). In patients with psychosis, withdrawal of the antipsychotic may not be possible. Switching to clozapine or quetiapine is one option to minimize TD. When these agents are contraindicated and the patient must continue using other atypical antipsychotic drugs, try to add dopamine-depleting agents such as TBZ or reserpine, but watch for the development of parkinsonism. When the symptoms are focal, such as tongue protrusion or blepharospasm, botulinum toxin injections can be very effective if spontaneous recovery does not occur. As a last resort, when disabling, life-threatening symptoms of TD persist despite all of the above-mentioned methods, some advocate resuming treatment with the DRBA to suppress symptoms of TD. This has the potential to worsen TD in the long run.",

    "197": "Approximately 30 years ago, the myth that nervous system immaturity precluded neonates from pain perception and its negative effects was rejected. Neurobiologists further explored neurodevelopmental nociception. These observations strongly suggest that early pain experience contributes to neurodevelopmental outcome, pain thresholds, pain or stress-related behaviour and physiological responses in later life. Effective management of pain therefore remains an important indicator of the quality of care provided to neonates, not only from an ethical, but also from a short and long-term outcome perspective. Simultaneously, neonatal care itself has changed and data on neuro-apoptosis and impaired synaptogenesis following exposure to analgosedatives emerged. When developmental pharmacology concepts are applied to neonatal analgosedation, this means that this should be based on systematic assessment, followed by titrated administration of the most appropriate analgesic(s) with subsequent re-assessment to adapt treatment.

The absorption of three concentrations (2.6, 5.2, and 10.4 microg x mL(-1)) of forsythoside A in different intestinal segments was studied with phenol red as the marker by rat circulation in situ. The results showed that the residue of forsythoside A with different concentrations had little significant difference from that obtained after perfusing via duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon, which indicated that the absorption of forsythoside A was passive diffusion and had no difference in different segments of rat intestine. The residue of forsythoside A increased to 466.160 and 463.429 microg respectively when cyclosporine (4 microg x mL(-1)) or midazolam (50 micromol x L(-1)) was added to the circulation fluid, which showed significant difference compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the residue of forsythoside A showed a tendency of increase with the increase of cyclosporine or midazolam.

    "203": "Adult male CD-1 mice (30-35 g) subjected to telemetric electroencephalography.", 
    "204": "Minocycline was administered daily. Mice were subjected to baseline data collection on the first day of minocycline administration and, on subsequent days, 2 S-DEP sessions, 1 and 3 h in duration, followed by recovery sleep. Following EEG studies, mice were euthanized either at the end of a 3 h S-DEP or as time-of day controls for sampling of brain messenger RNAs. Gene expression was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction.", 
    "205": "Minocycline-treated mice exhibited a reduction in time spent asleep, relative to saline-treated mice, in the 3-h interval immediately after administration. S-DEP resulted in an increase in EEG slow wave activity relative to baseline in saline-treated mice. This response to S-DEP was abolished in animals subjected to chronic minocycline administration. S-DEP suppressed the expression of the microglial-specific transcript cd11b and the neuroinflammation marker peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, in the brain at the mRNA level. Minocycline attenuated the elevation of c-fos expression by S-DEP. Brain levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNAs interleukin-1\u03b2 (il-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (il-6), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (tnf\u03b1) were unaffected by S-DEP, but were elevated in minocycline-treated mice relative to saline-treated mice.", 
    "206": "The anti-neuroinflammatory agent minocycline prevents either the buildup or expression of sleep need in rodents. The molecular mechanism underlying this effect is not known, but it is not mediated by suppression of il-1\u03b2, il-6, and tnf\u03b1 at the transcript level."
