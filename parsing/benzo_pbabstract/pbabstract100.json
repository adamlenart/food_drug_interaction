WIN (15 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly enhanced the anticonvulsant action of ETS, PB and VPA, but not that of CZP against PTZ-induced clonic seizures. The ED(50) values of ETS, PB and VPA were reduced from 148.0, 13.9 and 137.1mg/kg to 104.0, 8.3 and 85.6 mg/kg, respectively (P<0.05). WIN (5 and 10mg/kg, i.p.) had no impact on the anticonvulsant action of all studied AEDs against PTZ-induced clonic seizures. WIN (15 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly elevated total brain concentrations of ETS and VPA, but not those of CZP and PB in mice. Moreover, WIN combined with CZP, ETS, PB and VPA significantly impaired motor performance, long-term memory and muscular strength in mice subjected to the chimney, passive avoidance and grip-strength tests, respectively. Pharmacodynamic enhancement of the anticonvulsant action of PB by WIN against PTZ-induced clonic seizures is favorable from a preclinical viewpoint. Advantageous effects of WIN in combination with ETS and VPA against PTZ-induced seizures were pharmacokinetic in nature. However, WIN combined with CZP, ETS, PB and VPA impaired motor coordination and long-term memory as well as reduced skeletal muscular strength in the experimental animals.", 
    "1": "Although the acute toxicity of organophosphorus nerve agents is known to result from acetylcholinesterase inhibition, the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of neuropathology following nerve agent-induced seizure are not well understood. To help determine these pathways, we previously used microarray analysis to identify gene expression changes in the rat piriform cortex, a region of the rat brain sensitive to nerve agent exposure, over a 24-h time period following sarin-induced seizure. We found significant differences in gene expression profiles and identified secondary responses that potentially lead to brain injury and cell death. To advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in sarin-induced toxicity, we analyzed gene expression changes in four other areas of the rat brain known to be affected by nerve agent-induced seizure (amygdala, hippocampus, septum, and thalamus).", 
    "2": "We compared the transcriptional response of these four brain regions to sarin-induced seizure with the response previously characterized in the piriform cortex. In this study, rats were challenged with 1.0 \u00d7 LD\u2085\u2080 sarin and subsequently treated with atropine sulfate, 2-pyridine aldoxime methylchloride, and diazepam. The four brain regions were collected at 0.25, 1, 3, 6, and 24 h after seizure onset, and total RNA was processed for microarray analysis.", 
    "3": "Principal component analysis identified brain region and time following seizure onset as major sources of variability within the dataset. Analysis of variance identified genes significantly changed following sarin-induced seizure, and gene ontology analysis identified biological pathways, functions, and networks of genes significantly affected by sarin-induced seizure over the 24-h time course. Many of the molecular functions and pathways identified as being most significant across all of the brain regions were indicative of an inflammatory response. There were also a number of molecular responses that were unique for each brain region, with the thalamus having the most distinct response to nerve agent-induced seizure.",

    "5": "Organophosphorus nerve agents irreversibly inhibit acetylcholinesterase, causing a toxic buildup of acetylcholine at muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. Current medical countermeasures to nerve agent intoxication increase survival if administered within a short period of time following exposure but may not fully prevent neurological damage. Therefore, there is a need to discover drug treatments that are effective when administered after the onset of seizures and secondary responses that lead to brain injury.", 
    "6": "To determine potential therapeutic targets for such treatments, we analyzed gene expression changes in the rat piriform cortex following sarin (O-isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate)-induced seizure. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were challenged with 1 \u00d7 LD50 sarin and subsequently treated with atropine sulfate, 2-pyridine aldoxime methylchloride (2-PAM), and the anticonvulsant diazepam. Control animals received an equivalent volume of vehicle and drug treatments. The piriform cortex, a brain region particularly sensitive to neural damage from sarin-induced seizures, was extracted at 0.25, 1, 3, 6, and 24 h after seizure onset, and total RNA was processed for microarray analysis. Principal component analysis identified sarin-induced seizure occurrence and time point following seizure onset as major sources of variability within the dataset. Based on these variables, the dataset was filtered and analysis of variance was used to determine genes significantly changed in seizing animals at each time point. The calculated p-value and geometric fold change for each probeset identifier were subsequently used for gene ontology analysis to identify canonical pathways, biological functions, and networks of genes significantly affected by sarin-induced seizure over the 24-h time course.",

    "9": "Stem cell-based therapies are being considered for various neurologic diseases, such as epilepsy. Recent studies have suggested that some effects of transplanted stem cells are due to bystander effects that modulate the host environment, rather than direct effects of cell replacement. The extract from human adipose stem cells (ASCs) that secrete multiple growth factors including cytokines and chemokines may be a potential source of bystander effects for the treatment of epilepsy, in which inflammation is thought to play an important role. Here, we investigated the effects of a cytosolic extract of human ASCs (ASCs-E) in a mouse model of epilepsy.", 
    "10": "Human ASCs-E, boiled ASCs-E, or fibroblast-extract (fibroblast-E) was intraperitoneally administrated to C57BL/6 mice 15 min before pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) or during chronic epileptic stage. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage was evaluated by measuring Evans blue dye extravasation. Spontaneous recurrent seizure (SRS) was investigated by long-term video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring. The mice performed elevated plus maze, open-field, light/dark transition, and novel object recognition tasks.", 
    "11": "Acute application of human ASCs-E before SE led to earlier attenuation of seizure spike activities after treatment with diazepam, reduction of BBB leakage, and inhibition of the development of epilepsy. Human ASCs-E treatment (for 7 days) during the chronic epileptic stage suppressed SRS and reduced abnormal epileptic behavioral phenotypes. However, neither boiled ASCs-E nor fibroblast-E had any effects in the experimental epilepsy model.",

    "14": "An efficient one-pot reductive tandem mono-N-alkylation of both aromatic and aliphatic azides using dialkylboron triflates as alkylating agents has been examined under standardized reaction conditions. This methodology after optimization has been employed toward the syntheses of various secondary alkyl as well as aryl amines, including the synthesis of N10-butylated pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-5,11-diones via in situ azido reductive-cyclization process. This protocol is particularly attractive to provide an environmentally benign and practical method for mono-N-alkylation from organic azides without the use of toxic catalysts or corrosive alkylating agents. In addition, the mechanistic aspects have been investigated and the intermediates associated with this selective transformation have been intercepted and characterized by online monitoring of the reaction by ESI-MS/MS.", 
    "15": "The association of solid phase extraction with molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is applied to the direct extraction and quantitation of benzodiazepines in human plasma. The target analytes are sequestered by MIP and directly analyzed by ESI-MS. Due to the MIP highly selective extraction, ionic suppression during ESI is minimized; hence no separation is necessary prior to ESI-MS, which greatly increases analytical speed. Benzodiazepines (medazepam, nitrazepam, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam and midazolam) in human plasma were chosen as a proof-of-principle case of drug analyses by MIP-ESI-MS in a complex matrix. MIP-ESI-MS displayed good figures of merits for medazepam, nitrazepam, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide and midazolam, with analytical calibration curves ranging from 10 to 250 \u03bcg L(-1) (r > 0.98) with limit of quantification <10 \u03bcg L(-1) and acceptable within-day and between-day precision and accuracy.",

The majority of cases are associated with an underlying mood or psychotic disorder, while others are caused by medical conditions. Currently, benzodiazepines are the first-line psychopharmacologic agents in the treatment of catatonia. However, several cases have been reported in which treatment with memantine proved to be effective. We present the case of a 92-year-old female with major depressive disorder and associated catatonic symptoms. In this case, the patient's symptoms remitted quickly after the initiation of memantine. We review the possible causes of catatonia and pharmacologic treatments for the condition and highlight the possible benefits of N-methylD-aspartic acid receptor antagonists such as memantine in the treatment of catatonia.", 
    "17": "Due to sensitive limits of detection of chromatographic methods and low limit values regarding the screening of drugs under the terms of impairment in safe driving (\u00a7 24a StVG, Street Traffic Law in Germany), preliminary immunoassay (IA) tests should be able to detect also low concentrations of legal and illegal drugs in serum in forensic cases. False-negatives should be avoided, the rate of false-positive samples should be low due to cost and time. An optimization of IA cutoff values and a validation of the assay is required for each laboratory. In a retrospective study results for serum samples containing amphetamine, methylenedioxy derivatives, cannabinoids, benzodiazepines, cocaine (metabolites), methadone and opiates obtained with CEDIA drugs of abuse reagents on a Hitachi 912 autoanalyzer were compared with quantitative results of chromatographic methods (gas or liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS or LC/MS)). Firstly sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and overall misclassification rates were evaluated by contingency tables and compared to ROC-analyses and Youden-Indices. Secondly ideal cutoffs were statistically calculated on the basis of sensitivity and specificity as decisive statistical criteria with focus on a high sensitivity (low rates of false-negatives), i.e. using the Youden-Index. Immunoassay (IA) and confirmatory results were available for 3014 blood samples. Sensitivity was 90% or more for nearly all analytes: amphetamines (IA cutoff 9.5 ng/ml), methylenedioxy derivatives (IA cutoff 5.5 ng/ml), cannabinoids (IA cutoff 14.5 ng/ml), benzodiazepines (IA cutoff >0 ng/ml). Test of opiates showed a sensitivity of 86% for a IA cutoff value of >0 ng/ml. Values for specificity ranged between 33% (methadone, IA cutoff 10 ng/ml) and 90% (cocaine, IA cutoff 20 ng/ml). Lower cutoff values as recommended by ROC analyses were chosen for most tests to decrease the rate of false-negatives. Analyses enabled the definition of cutoff values with good values for sensitivity. Small rates of false-positives can be accepted in forensic cases.", 
    "18": "Cocaine toxicity is a prevalent problem in the Unites States for which there is currently no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy. We have developed a bacterial cocaine esterase (CocE) towards this indication. A thermostabilized mutant of CocE (DM-CocE) retains the hydrolytic activity of the wild-type esterase, rapidly hydrolyzing cocaine into the inactive metabolites ecgonine methyl ester and benzoic acid, and can prevent cocaine toxicities in rodent and non-human primate models. To advance DM-CocE towards clinical use, we examine here how the hydrolytic activity of DM-CocE is altered by some drugs commonly co-administered with cocaine.", 
    "19": "We employed a spectrophotometric cocaine hydrolysis assay to evaluate whether pharmacologically relevant doses of alcohol, nicotine, morphine, phencyclidine, ketamine, methamphetamine, naltrexone, naloxone, or midazolam would alter the Michaelis-Menten kinetics of DM-CocE for cocaine. Mass spectrometry was used to evaluate interaction with diazepam as this drug interferes with the absorbance spectra of cocaine critical for the spectrophotometric assay.", 
    "20": "Alcohol, nicotine, morphine, phencyclidine, ketamine, methamphetamine, naltrexone, naloxone, and midazolam did not alter cocaine hydrolysis by DM-CocE. However, diazepam significantly slowed DM-CocE cocaine hydrolysis at very high concentrations, most likely through interaction of the phenyl ring of the benzodiazepine with the active site of DM-CocE.", 
    "21": "DM-CocE does not display significant drug interactions, with the exception of diazepam, which may warrant further study as DM-CocE progresses towards a clinically used pharmacotherapy for cocaine toxicity. Alternate benzodiazepines, e.g., midazolam could be used to avoid this potential interaction.", 
    "22": "For fast and reliable screening, identification, and quantification of as many analytes as possible, multi-analyte approaches are very useful in clinical and forensic toxicology. Using ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, such an approach has been developed for blood plasma analysis after simple liquid-liquid extraction. In the present paper, validation and application is described for 31 neuroleptics, 28 benzodiazepines, and Z-drugs (zaleplone, zolpidem, and zopiclone). The validation parameters included recovery, matrix effects, process efficiency, ion suppression/enhancement of co-eluting analytes, selectivity, crosstalk, accuracy and precision, stabilities, and limits of quantification and detection. The results showed that the approach was selective, sensitive, accurate, and precise for 24 neuroleptics and 21 benzodiazepines and Z-drugs. The remaining analytes were unstable and/or too low dosed. Cost- and time-saving one-point calibration was applicable only for half of the analytes. The applicability was successfully shown for most of the drugs by analyzing authentic plasma samples and external quality control samples.",

No significant differences in craving between clozapine and olanzapine were found. These results are in concordance with findings in the literature on this subject and could be explained by differences in three dopamine mediated mechanisms of these compounds: 1) occupancy rate of dopamine D(2) receptors, 2) dissociation rate of dopamine D(2) receptors, 3) D(1)/D(2) occupancy ratio. Risperidone and clozapine show a maximal difference in D(2) receptor occupancy rate, dissociation rate and D(1)/D(2) ratio. Olanzapine is intermediate between risperidone and clozapine in these characteristics.", 
    "66": "The essential oil (EO) from Cymbopogon citratus (DC) Stapf is reported to have a wide range of biological activities and is widely used in traditional medicine as an infusion or decoction. However, despite this widely use, there are few controlled studies confirming its biological activity in central nervous system.", 
    "67": "The anxiolytic-like activity of the EO was investigated in light/dark box (LDB) and marble-burying test (MBT) and the antidepressant activity was investigated in forced-swimming test (FST) in mice. Flumazenil, a competitive antagonist of benzodiazepine binding and the selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY100635 was used in experimental procedures to determine the action mechanism of EO. To exclude any false positive results in experimental procedures, mice were submitted to the rota-rod test. We also quantified some neurotransmitters at specific brain regions after EO oral acute treatment.", 
    "68": "The present work found anxiolytic-like activity of the EO at the dose of 10mg/kg in a LDB. Flumazenil, but not WAY100635, was able to reverse the effect of the EO in the LDB, indicating that the EO activity occurs via the GABA(A) receptor-benzodiazepine complex. Only at higher doses did the EO potentiate diethyl-ether-induced sleeping time in mice. In the FST and MBT, EO showed no effect. Finally, the increase in time spent in the light chamber, demonstrated by concomitant treatment with ineffective doses of diazepam (DZP) and the EO, revealed a synergistic effect of the two compounds. The lack of activity after long-term treatment in the LDB test might be related to tolerance induction, even in the DZP-treated group. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between groups after either acute or repeated treatments with the EO in the rota-rod test. Neurochemical evaluation showed no amendments in neurotransmitter levels evaluated in cortex, striatum, pons, and hypothalamus.", 
    "69": "The results corroborate the use of Cymbopogon citratus in folk medicine and suggest that the anxiolytic-like effect of its EO is mediated by the GABA(A) receptor-benzodiazepine complex.", 
    "70": "Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) are the electrical response of the brain while performing a particular task. Methods traditionally used to study ERPs measure the amplitude and duration of the waveform in order to quantify the changes, being signal morphology dependent. However, the frequency characteristics of those events remain uncovered. The aim of this work was the study of new measures to characterize, by means of time-frequency representation (TFR) techniques, the ERPs recorded while subjects conducted a choice reaction time task (Ericksen flanker task) following the administration of different alprazolam doses. Several measures defined from energy, instantaneous frequency and group delay functions were obtained by means of TFR techniques applied to the Choi-Williams distribution (CWD) of EEG signals. These measures, which are signal morphology independent, were studied in four frequency bands, \u03b4 (0-4 Hz), \u03b8 (4-8 Hz), \u03b1 (8-15 Hz), \u03b2 (15-30 Hz), and for certain time periods. Based on these measures, differences between ERPs were analyzed by comparing the different response types (successes or successfully corrected failures) of the subject performing the task, and comparing the applied drug doses. For each subject, the CWD of EEG signals was applied in two different ways: (a) all ERPs were averaged per channel, and then the CWD was applied; (b) the CWD was applied to each one of the ERPs. When the CWD was applied to each ERP, the energy measures in the \u03b4, \u03b8 and \u03b2 bands, the instantaneous frequency measures in the \u03b1 and \u03b2 bands, and the group delay measures in the \u03b4, \u03b8 and \u03b1 bands showed a statistically significant level p < 0.0005 in the analysis of the response type. Also, the energy measures in the \u03b8 and \u03b2 bands and the instantaneous frequency measures in the \u03b1 band showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.0005) between placebo and low and high drug doses. In contrast, poor results were obtained when all epochs of each subject were averaged per channel. Finally, it was concluded that these results showed that the new proposed measures based on the energy offered a new and more robust way to characterize ERP signals.", 
    "71": "It is well known that an emotionally arousing experience usually results in a robust and persistent memory trace. The present study explored the potential mechanisms involved in the influence of stress on the consolidation of a contextual fear memory in animals subjected to a weak fear training protocol, and whether pretreatment with intra-basolateral amygdala or systemic administration of midazolam (MDZ) prevents the potential stress-induced influence on fear memory formation. A previous restraint session facilitated fear retention, this effect was not due to a sensitized effect of restraint on the footshock experience. MDZ, both systemically or intra-basolateral amygdala infusion prior to the restraint, attenuated the stress-induced promoting influence on fear memory formation. In addition, stress exposure activated the ERK1/2 pathway in basolateral amygdala (BLA) after the weak training procedure but not after the immediate footshock protocol. Similar to our behavioral findings, MDZ attenuated stress-induced elevation of phospho-ERK2 (p-ERK2) in BLA following the acquisition session. Given that the activation of ERK1/2 pathway is essential for associative learning, we propose that stress-induced facilitation of p-ERK2 in BLA is an important mechanism for the promoting influence of stress on the consolidation of contextual fear memory.", 
    "72": "There is increased understanding that distinct GABA(A) receptor subtypes mediate different effects of classical benzodiazepines. Here, we aimed to define the contributions of \u03b1(1)-containing subtypes of the subtype-selective GABA(A) receptor positive allosteric modulators TPA023, ocinaplon, and NG2-73 using drug discrimination. We characterized these compounds with defined subunit preferences in rats that were trained to discriminate either the non-selective benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 5.0 mg/kg) or the \u03b1(1)-selective drug zolpidem (1.5 mg/kg). In short, CDP but not zolpidem generalized to the CDP cue. In contrast, zolpidem-trained rats showed opposite effects and generalized to zolpidem but not to CDP, while the response rate reducing effects of both ligands were comparable. Moreover, TPA023, lacking efficacy at the GABA(A) receptor \u03b1(1) subunit, occasioned dose-dependent CDP-appropriate responding but generalized only to around 10% to zolpidem. Both ocinaplon and NG2-73 completely generalized to both the CDP and zolpidem cue. Overall, our data confirm and extend the previous findings in rats that compounds that lack efficacy at \u03b1(1)-containing GABA(A) receptors generalize to CDP, whereas the opposite holds true for \u03b1(1)-preferential compounds, which generalize to the \u03b1(1)-selective positive allosteric modulator zolpidem. Also, our data support the hypothesis that subtle in vitro differences in \u03b1 subunit efficacy and/or affinity may eventually have large consequences in vivo. Together, our data demonstrate a reliable in vivo method to determine the contribution of the subtype-selective mechanism(s) of action for novel and subtype-selective GABA(A) receptor positive allosteric modulators, suggesting that a complex activation of multiple \u03b1 subunits accounts for drug discrimination between non-selective and selective GABA(A) receptor ligands.", 
    "73": "Selenomethionine (Se-Met) is the major dietary form of selenium (Se). Detrimental effects have been associated with exposure to elevated dietary selenium. Previous studies have demonstrated effects of Se on the endocrine system, in particular effects on cortisol and thyroid hormones. However, no information is available regarding effects of Se on sex steroid hormones. In the present study, effects of dietary exposure to an environmentally relevant concentration (4.54 mg/kg wet weight (ww)) of Se-Met for 126 days on concentrations of sex steroid hormones in blood plasma of female rainbow trout were determined. Furthermore, the molecular basis for effects of Se-Met on plasma sex steroid hormone concentrations was investigated. Concentrations of androstenedione (A), estrone (E1), and estradiol (E2) were 39.5-, 3.8-, and 12.7-fold greater in plasma of treated females than the untreated controls, respectively. Testosterone (T) was detected only in plasma of treated females. The greater E2 concentration stimulated greater transcript abundance of vitellogenin (vtg) and zona-radiata protein (zrp). Female rainbow trout exposed to Se-Met had greater transcript abundance of key steroidogenic proteins and enzymes, including peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (pbr), cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage (P450scc), and 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3\u03b2-hsd). Exposure to Se-Met did not affect transcript abundance of luteinizing hormone (lh) or follicle stimulating hormone (fsh). Similarly, there was no change in transcript abundance of luteinizing hormone receptor (lhr) or follicle stimulating hormone receptor (fshr). Long-term exposure to dietary Se-Met has the potential to stimulate vitellogenesis in female rainbow trout by directly stimulating ovarian tissue steroidogenesis. This is the first study to report effects of Se on sex steroid hormone production in fish.",

    "100": "2,3-Benzodiazepine derivatives are AMPA receptor inhibitors, and they are potential drugs for treating some neurological diseases caused by excessive activity of AMPA receptors. Using a laser-pulse photolysis and rapid solution flow techniques, we characterized the mechanism of action of a 2,3-benzodiazepine derivative, termed BDZ-f, by measuring its inhibitory effect on the channel-opening and channel-closing rate constants as well as the whole-cell current amplitude of the homomeric GluA2Q AMPA receptor channels. We also investigated whether BDZ-f competes with GYKI 52466 for binding to the same site on GluA2Q(flip). GYKI 52466 is the prototypic 2,3-benzodiazepine compound, and BDZ-f is the N-3 methylcarbamoyl derivative. We found that BDZ-f is a noncompetitive inhibitor with a slight preference for the closed-channel state of both the flip and the flop variants of GluA2Q. Similar to other 2,3-benzodiazepine compounds that we have previously characterized, BDZ-f inhibits GluA2Q(flip) by forming an initial, loose intermediate that is partially conducting; however, this intermediate rapidly isomerizes into a tighter, fully inhibitory receptor-inhibitor complex. BDZ-f binds to the same noncompetitive site as GYKI 52466 does. Together, our results show that the addition of an N-3 methylcarbamoyl group to the diazepine ring with the azomethine feature (i.e., GYKI 52466) is what makes BDZ-f more potent and more selective toward the closed-channel conformation than the original GYKI 52466.

However, the use of propofol has increased enormously in the past decade and several studies show advantages of propofol over the traditional regimes in terms of faster recovery time. It is important to be aware that the complication rate of endoscopies increases when sedation is used; therefore, a thorough risk evaluation before the procedure and monitoring during the procedure must be performed. In addition, properly trained staff and emergency equipment should be available. The best approach to sedation in endoscopy is to choose a sedation regimen for the individual patient, tailored according to the clinical risk assessment and the anxiety level of the patient, as well as to the type of planned endoscopic procedure.", 
    "107": "Olanzapine is an antipsychotic used in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and treatment-resistant depression. Glucuronidation by the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) family of enzymes is the major mode of olanzapine metabolism, and polymorphisms in these enzymes could contribute to interindividual variability in olanzapine metabolism and therapeutic response.",

    "109": "Cell lines overexpressing the individual UGTs 1A4 and 2B10 exhibited glucuronidation activity against olanzapine. The UGT1A4 variant exhibited a 3.7-fold (P<0.0001) higher Vmax/KM for the formation of the olanzapine-10-N-glucuronide isomer 1, and a 4.3-fold (P<0.0001) higher Vmax/KM for the formation of the olanzapine-10-N-glucuronide isomer 2 than wild-type UGT1A4. The UGT2B10 variant exhibited no glucuronidation activity against olanzapine. In a screening of 105 HLM specimens, there was a 2.1-fold (P=0.04) and 1.6-fold (P=0.0017) increase in the rate of olanzapine-10-N-glucuronide isomer 1 and olanzapine-4'-N-glucuronide formation, and a 2-fold (P=0.02) increase in the overall olanzapine glucuronidation formation, in HLM with the UGT1A4 (*3/*3)/UGT2B10 (*1/*1) genotype compared with HLM with the UGT1A4 (*1/*1)/UGT2B10 (*1/*1) genotype.

    "115": "The coumarins imperatorin and osthole are known to exert anticonvulsant activity. We have therefore analyzed the modulation of GABA-induced chloride currents (I(GABA)) by a selection of 18 coumarin derivatives on recombinant \u03b1(1)\u03b2(2)\u03b3(2S) GABA(A) receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes by means of the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique. Osthole (EC(50)=14 \u00b1 1 \u03bcM) and oxypeucedanin (EC(50)=25 \u00b1 8 \u03bcM) displayed the highest efficiency with I(GABA) potentiation of 116 \u00b1 4 % and 547 \u00b1 56 %, respectively. I(GABA) enhancement by osthole and oxypeucedanin was not inhibited by flumazenil (1 \u03bcM) indicating an interaction with a binding site distinct from the benzodiazepine binding site. In general, prenyl residues are essential for the positive modulatory activity, while longer side chains or bulkier residues (e.g. geranyl residues) diminish I(GABA) modulation. Generation of a binary classification tree revealed the importance of polarisability, which is sufficient to distinguish actives from inactives. A 4-point pharmacophore model based on oxypeucedanin - comprising three hydrophobic and one aromatic feature - identified 6 out of 7 actives as hits. In summary, (oxy-)prenylated coumarin derivatives from natural origin represent new GABA(A) receptor modulators.",

This study investigated the possibility of drug aetiology of immune haemolytic anaemia (IHA) in 134 patients with new onset of IHA who were identified in the Berlin Case-Control Surveillance Study between 2000 and 2009. Single drugs related to IHA in three or more patients and assessed more than once as a certain or probable cause of IHA in a standardized causality assessment included diclofenac, fludarabine, oxaliplatin, ceftriaxone and piperacillin. In a case-control study including all 124 IHA cases developed in outpatient care and 731 controls, significantly increased odds ratios (OR) were observed for beta-lactam antibiotics (OR=8\u00b78; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3\u00b72-25\u00b72), cotrimoxazole (OR=6\u00b75; CI 1\u00b71-37\u00b79), ciprofloxacin (OR=6\u00b79, CI 1\u00b73-38\u00b75), fludarabine (OR=22\u00b72; CI: 2\u00b78-454\u00b75) and lorazepam (OR=5\u00b73; CI: 1\u00b72-21\u00b72). Excluding new onset cases with a chronic IHA disease course, an increased risk became also apparent for diclofenac with an OR of 3\u00b71 (CI 1\u00b73-7\u00b70). This is the first case-control study investigating drugs as risk factors for IHA. It corroborates an increased risk for several drugs that have been implicated as a cause of IHA in the standardized causality assessment of individual cases.", 
    "118": "To investigate the binding mode of Zolpidem to GABA(A) and to delineate the conformational changes induced upon agonist binding, we carried out atomistic molecular dynamics simulation using the ligand binding domain of GABA(A) \u03b1(1) receptor. Comparative molecular dynamics simulation of the apo and the holo form of GABA(A) receptor revealed that \u03b3(2)/\u03b1(1) interface housing the benzodiazepine binding site undergoes distinct conformational changes upon Zolpidem binding. We notice that C loop of the \u03b1(1) subunit experiences an inward motion toward the vestibule and the F loop of \u03b3(2) sways away from the vestibule, an observation that rationalizes Zolpidem as an alpha1 selective agonist. Energy decomposition analysis carried out was able to highlight the important residues implicated in Zolpidem binding, which were largely in congruence with the experimental data. The simulation study disclosed herein provides a meaningful insight into Zolpidem-GABA(A)R interactions and helps to arrive at a binding mode hypothesis with implications for drug design.",

In this paper, 60 benzodiazepine derivatives displaying potent activities against ET(A) and ET(B) subtypes of endothelin receptor were selected to establish the 3D-QSAR models using CoMFA and CoMSIA approaches. These models show excellent internal predictability and consistency, external validation using test-set 19 compounds yields a good predictive power for antagonistic potency.

Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is known to affect insulin secretion by pancreatic \u03b2 cells. Recently, a meta-analysis study reported an association between a GIP receptor (GIPR) gene polymorphism (rs10423928) and insulin secretion measured by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). We assessed the influence of this GIPR gene polymorphism on glucose metabolism in 60 schizophrenic patients treated with olanzapine and 103 healthy controls. The GIPR gene polymorphism was determined using TaqMan methods. We performed repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and one-way ANOVA for the glucose and insulin levels during OGTTs in four groups divided by the GIPR gene polymorphism and cohort (schizophrenia or control). We found significant effects of the GIPR gene and cohort on the insulin levels at 30 min. Our findings suggest that schizophrenic patients with the A allele of GIPR rs10423928 are at risk of developing hyperinsulinemia when treated with antipsychotics.",

The enantiomer-specific activity for endocrine disruption in mice remains unclear. In the present study, the four individual PM enantiomers were separated by preparative HPLC. Then, three week-old male ICR mice (after maternal ablactation) were orally administered (+)-cis, (-)-cis, (+)-trans, and (-)-trans-PM separately daily for 3 weeks at doses of 0, 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively. The results showed that 100 mg/kg of (+)-cis, (-)-cis and (-)-trans-PM treatments resulted in serious testicular histopathological damage, decreases in testis weight and serum testosterone (T) concentrations. Moreover, the transcription status of some key genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and transport as well as T synthesis in the testes were also influenced selectively by PM enantiomers, especially by the (+)-cis-PM. Additionally, peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) and 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17\u03b2-HSD) mRNA levels decreased significantly in the (+)-cis-PM group regardless of the administrated doses, while steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) levels were significantly down-regulated by (+)-cis and (-)-trans-PM. Moreover, significant differences were mainly found in HMG-CoA reductase, PBR, StAR and 17\u03b2-HSD mRNA levels between different enantiomers. Combined with the effects on physiology, histopathology and the expression of genes related to T synthesis, (+)-cis-PM showed the greatest endocrine disruption activities, (-)-cis and (-)-trans-PM were moderate, while (+)-trans-PM exhibited the lowest. These results suggested significant PM enantioselectivity in the reproductive toxicity of mice during puberty exposure.",

    "135": "Inhibition in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) is mediated by \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The fast inhibitory actions of GABA are mediated by GABA type A receptors (GABA(A)Rs); they mediate both phasic and tonic inhibition in the brain and are the principle sites of action for anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and sedative-hypnotic agents that include benzodiazepines, barbiturates, neurosteroids, and some general anesthetics. GABA(A)Rs are heteropentameric ligand-gated ion channels that are found concentrated at inhibitory postsynaptic sites where they mediate phasic inhibition and at extrasynaptic sites where they mediate tonic inhibition. The efficacy of inhibition and thus neuronal excitability is critically dependent on the accumulation of specific GABA(A)R subtypes at inhibitory synapses. Here we evaluate how neurons control the number of GABA(A)Rs on the neuronal plasma membrane together with their selective stabilization at synaptic sites. We then go on to examine the impact that these processes have on the strength of synaptic inhibition and behavior.", 
    "136": "A number of compounds already in use as medications for various indications substitute for ethanol at clinically relevant brain pathways, in particular, at gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. Nevertheless, although substitute medications have been recognized for heroin and tobacco dependence, patients with alcohol dependence are rarely offered an analogous approach. Benzodiazepines may have paradoxical effects, and abuse and dependence are known. Baclofen (GABA(B) agonist) has not been associated with dependence or misuse and has been effective in several trials in preventing relapse, although research is required to establish the optimal dosing regimen. GABA-ergic anticonvulsants, helpful in treating withdrawal, have yet to emerge as effective in relapse prevention. Clomethiazole and sodium oxybate, the latter having been shown to be effective in relapse prevention, have incurred a reputation for dependence and abuse. However, data have emerged showing that the risk of abuse of sodium oxybate is lower than many clinicians had foreseen. For a condition where existing therapies are only effective in a proportion of patients, and which has high morbidity and mortality, the time now seems right for reappraising the use of substitute prescribing for alcohol dependence.",

    "141": "Memories are often classified as hippocampus dependent or independent, and sleep has been found to facilitate both, but in different ways. In this Opinion, we explore the optimal neural state for cellular and systems consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memories that benefit from sleep. We suggest that these two kinds of consolidation, which are ordinarily treated separately, overlap in time and jointly benefit from a period of reduced interference (during which no new memories are formed). Conditions that result in reduced interference include slow wave sleep (SWS), NMDA receptor antagonists, benzodiazepines, alcohol and acetylcholine antagonists. We hypothesize that the consolidation of hippocampal-dependent memories might not depend on SWS per se. Instead, the brain opportunistically consolidates previously encoded memories whenever the hippocampus is not otherwise occupied by the task of encoding new memories.", 
    "142": "Phospholipase C-\u03b72 (PLC\u03b72) is a novel enzyme whose activity in a cellular context is largely uncharacterised. In this study the activity of PLC\u03b72 was examined via [(3)H]inositol phosphate release in COS7 cells expressing the enzyme. PLC\u03b72 activity increased approximately 5-fold in response to monensin, a Na(+)/H(+) antiporter. This was significantly inhibited by CGP-37157 which implies that the effect of monensin was due, at least in part, to mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchange. Direct activation of PLC\u03b72 by <1\u03bcM Ca(2+) was confirmed in permeabilised transfected cells. The roles of the PH and C2 domains in controlling PLC\u03b72 activity via membrane association were also investigated. A PH domain-lacking mutant exhibited no detectable activity in response to monensin or Ca(2+) due to an inability to associate with the cell membrane. Within the C2 domain, mutation of D920 to alanine at the predicted Ca(2+)-binding site dramatically reduced enzyme activity highlighting an important regulatory role for this domain. Mutation of D861 to asparagine also influenced activity, most likely due to altered lipid selectivity. Of the C2 mutations investigated, none altered sensitivity to Ca(2+). This suggests that the C2 domain is not responsible for Ca(2+) activation. Collectively, this work highlights an important new component of the Ca(2+) signalling toolkit and given its sensitivity to Ca(2+), this enzyme is likely to facilitate the amplification of intracellular Ca(2+) transients and/or crosstalk between Ca(2+)-storing compartments in vivo.", 
    "143": "Reliable on-site oral fluid screening devices are a useful and convenient means of policing traffic. In Finland, benzodiazepines represent a particular challenge to traffic safety. This study presents a retrospective examination of toxicological analysis results from whole blood in cases which gave a positive screening result for benzodiazepines in oral fluid using the DrugWipe Single device (Securetec). Use of oral fluid on-site screening tests and blood confirmation analyses reflects the real situation in many countries. The data were compiled from the databases of Alcohol and Drug Analytics Unit at the National Institute for Health and Welfare. Confirmation analysis results in whole blood were obtained using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Data were from 224 real cases in which the Finnish police had conducted a DrugWipe Single benzodiazepines test on drivers suspected of driving under the influence of drugs (DUID). The benzodiazepine concentrations encountered in positive oral fluid screening cases in this study indicate that the device is able to detect these substances even at relatively low levels. However, the DrugWipe device does not enable any distinction between therapeutic use and harmful use of benzodiazepines at higher doses.", 
    "144": "Signaling by muscarinic agonists is thought to result from the activation of cell surface acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) that transmit extracellular signals to intracellular systems. In N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, we detected both plasma membrane and intracellular M(1) -mAChRs using both biochemical and pharmacological methods. In intact cells, both plasma membrane and intracellular M(1) -mAChRs were detected by the hydrophobic ligand probe, 1-quinuclidinyl-[phenyl-4-(3) H]-benzilate ([(3) H]-QNB) whereas the hydrophilic probe, 1-[N-methyl-(3) H] scopolamine ([(3) H]-NMS), detected only cell surface receptors. These probes detected comparable numbers of receptors in isolated membrane preparations. Immunohistochemical studies with M(1) -mAChR antibody also detected both cell-surface and intracellular M(1) -mAChRs. Carbachol-stimulated phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and Ca(2+) mobilization were completely inhibited by a cell-impermeable M(1) antagonist, muscarinic toxin -7 and the G(q/11) inhibitor YM-254890. However, carbachol-stimulated extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 activation was unaffected by muscarinic toxin-7, but was blocked by the cell-permeable antagonist, pirenzepine. extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation was resistant to blockade of G(q/11) (YM-254890) and protein kinase C (bisindolylmaleimide I). Our data suggest that the geographically distinct M(1) -mAChRs (cell surface versus intracellular) can signal via unique signaling pathways that are differentially sensitive to cell-impermeable versus cell-permeable antagonists. Our data are of potential physiological relevance to signaling that affects both cognitive and neurodegenerative processes.",

Although the essential role of 5-HT(2A) receptors in atypical antipsychotic drug actions is widely accepted, the contribution of 5-HT(2A) down-regulation to their efficacy is not known. We hypothesized that down-regulation of cortical 5-HT(2A) receptors contributes to the therapeutic action of atypical antipsychotic drugs. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effect of chronically administered antipsychotics (clozapine, olanzapine, and haloperidol) and several 5-HT(2A) antagonists [ketanserin, altanserin, \u03b1-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(4-fluorophenylethyl)]-4-piperidinemethanol (M100907), \u03b1-phenyl-1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinemethano (M11939), 4-[(2Z)-3-{[2-(dimethylamino)ethoxy]amino}-3-(2-fluorophenyl)prop-2-en-1-ylidene]cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-one (SR46349B), and pimavanserin], on the phencyclidine (PCP)-induced hyperlocomotor response and cortical 5-HT(2A) receptor levels in C57BL/6J mice. Clozapine and olanzapine, but not haloperidol, induced receptor down-regulation and attenuated PCP-induced locomotor responses. Of the selective 5-HT(2A) antagonists tested, only ketanserin caused significant receptor protein down-regulation, whereas SR46349B up-regulated 5-HT(2A) receptors and potentiated PCP-hyperlocomotion; the other 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists were without effect. The significance of these findings with respect to atypical antipsychotic drug action is discussed.",

    "158": "Oral mucositis (OM) is a devasting toxicity associated with cytotoxic cancer therapy. Antrum mucosal protein (AMP)-18 and a synthetic peptide surrogate, exhibit cell protective and mitogenic properties in in vitro and in vivo models of gastrointestinal epithelial cell injury. The mucosal barrier-protective effects may be mediated by AMP-18's capacity to increase accumulation of specific tight junction (TJ) and adherens junction proteins, and also protect against their loss after injury. Here we asked if AMP peptide could protect the oral mucosa and speed healing from radiation-induced injury. We found AMP peptide prevented radiation-induced OM in a murine model. The peptide also stimulated HaCaT cell growth used to model the oral mucosa. Binding of recombinant human (rh) AMP-18 to the plasma membrane of keratinocytes in normal human oral mucosal tissue suggested that its effects may be receptor mediated. Using an immobilized His-tagged rhAMP-18 fusion protein the receptor was identified as the cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor (CCKBR) by affinity purification and mass spectrometry analysis. CCKBR was expressed and co-immunoprecipitated with exogenous rhAMP-18 in diverse epithelial cell lines. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that rhAMP-18 colocalized with CCKBR on the surface of CCKBR-transfected cells. Furthermore, rhAMP-18-stimulated signaling pathways were blocked by a CCKBR-specific antagonist, YM022. rhAMP-18 enhanced viability and growth of CCKBR-transfected, but not empty vector-transfected cells. These results suggest the importance of epithelial junctional integrity in the pathogenesis of OM and demonstrate that AMP-18, by targeting TJ proteins through the activation of CCKBR, could provide a novel strategy for the prevention and treatment of OM.", 
    "159": "A fast liquid chromatographic/tandem mass spectrometric method was developed for the simultaneous determination in human urine of seventeen benzodiazepines, four relevant metabolites together plus zolpidem and zopiclone. The sample preparation, optimized to take into account the matrix effect, was based on enzymatic hydrolysis and liquid-liquid extraction. The separation of the twenty-three analytes was achieved in less than eight minutes. The whole methodology was fully validated according to UNI EN ISO/IEC 17025:2005 rules and 2006 SOFT/AAFS guidelines. Selectivity, linearity range, identification (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) limits, precision, accuracy and recovery were evaluated. For all the species the signal/concentration linearity was satisfactory in the 50-1000 ng/mL concentration range. The limits of detection ranged from 0.5 to 30 ng/mL and LOQs from 1.7 to 100.0 ng/mL. Precisions were in the ranges 5.0-11.8%, 1.5-11.0% and 1.1-4.4% for low (100 ng/mL), medium (300 ng/mL) and high (1000 ng/mL) concentration, respectively. The accuracy, expressed as bias% was within \u00b1 25 % for all the analytes. The recovery values, evaluated at 300 ng/mL concentration, ranged from 56.2% to 98.8%. The present method for the determination of several benzodiazepines, zolpidem and zopiclone in human urine proved to be simple, fast, specific and sensitive.

Given the potential of GABA(A) positive modulators to manage certain aspects of stimulant abuse and dependence (i.e., drug-induced seizures, anxiety and stress), but the relatively small impact on the acute abuse-related effects of methamphetamine observed here, additional research with GABA(A) positive modulators is warranted, but should consider their use as an adjunct component of combination behavioral and/or drug treatment.",

To characterize recent trends in drug overdose death rates in Florida, CDC analyzed data from the Florida Medical Examiners Commission. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which found that, from 2003 to 2009, the number of annual deaths in which medical examiner testing showed lethal concentrations of one or more drugs increased 61.0%, from 1,804 to 2,905, and the death rate increased 47.5%, from 10.6 to 15.7 per 100,000 population. During 2003-2009, death rates increased for all substances except cocaine and heroin. The death rate for prescription drugs increased 84.2%, from 7.3 to 13.4 per 100,000 population. The greatest increase was observed in the death rate from oxycodone (264.6%), followed by alprazolam (233.8%) and methadone (79.2%). By 2009, the number of deaths involving prescription drugs was four times the number involving illicit drugs. These findings indicate the need to strengthen interventions aimed at reducing overdose deaths from prescription drugs in Florida. Medical examiner records are a timely, population-based source for data regarding overdose deaths from specific drugs.

    "178": "Signal-regulated changes in cell size affect cell division and survival and therefore are central to tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis. In this respect, GABA receptors (GABA(A)Rs) are of particular interest because allowing anions flow across the cell membrane modulates the osmolyte flux and the cell volume. Therefore, we have here investigated the hypothesis that GABA may regulate neural stem cell proliferation by inducing cell size changes. We found that, besides neuroblasts, also neural precursors in the neonatal murine subependymal zone sense GABA via GABA(A) Rs. However, unlike in neuroblasts, where it induced depolarization-mediated [Ca(2+)](i) increase, GABA(A) Rs activation in precursors caused hyperpolarization. This resulted in osmotic swelling and increased surface expression of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs). Furthermore, activation of GABA(A) Rs signaling in vitro in the presence of EGF modified the expression of the cell cycle regulators, phosphatase and tensin homolog and cyclin D1, increasing the pool of cycling precursors without modifying cell cycle length. A similar effect was observed on treatment with diazepam. We also demonstrate that GABA and diazepam responsive precursors represent prominin(+) stem cells. Finally, we show that as in in vitro also in in vivo a short administration of diazepam promotes EGFR expression in prominin(+) stem cells causing activation and cell cycle entry. Thus, our data indicate that endogenous GABA is a part of a regulatory mechanism of size and cell cycle entry of neonatal stem cells. Our results also have potential implications for the therapeutic practices that involve exposure to GABA(A) Rs modulators during neurodevelopment.",

India, which is in a phase of social transition, also faces this rising menace. Despite the nature and extent of this problem, this area has been under-researched. Data from India are sparse barring a few newspaper and police reports. Keeping abreast of current trends in club drug use prepares the clinician to recognize the clinical effects of club drug use, to manage club drug related emergencies, and to generate social awareness.", 
    "212": "Little is known about psychopharmacological prescription practice in low-income countries. The present study aimed for an analysis of pharmacological treatment strategies for inpatients with schizophrenia in Tashkent, the capital city of Uzbekistan, facing a low-income situation as compared with four German cities in a high-income Western situation.", 
    "213": "We conducted a cross-sectional quantitative survey of age, gender, diagnoses, and psychotropic medication of 845 urban psychiatric inpatients of the Tashkent psychiatric hospital and of 922 urban psychiatric inpatients in four German cities on 1\u2009day in October 2008. We compared the current treatment strategies for specific diagnostic categories between the two settings.", 
    "214": "In Tashkent, patients diagnosed with schizophrenia were treated with clozapine (66%), haloperidol (62%), or both (44%). More than one-third of the patients treated for schizophrenia were prescribed amitriptyline. The usual treatment strategy for schizophrenia was the combination of two or more antipsychotics (67%). In German cities, the preferred antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia were olanzapine (21%), clozapine (20%), quetiapine (17%), risperidone (17%), and haloperidol (14%); the most common treatment strategy for patients with schizophrenia was the combination of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines; 44% of the patients were treated with two or more antipsychotics at a time.", 
    "215": "In both settings, psychotropic combination treatments are common for the treatment of schizophrenia contrasting current guideline recommendations. Its rationale and effectiveness needs to be tested in further studies.", 
    "216": "The investigation of deaths of individuals whose bodies are decomposed, mummified, or skeletonized is particularly difficult for medical examiners and medicolegal death investigators. Determination of the cause and manner of death in such cases frequently requires consultation with experts in a variety of disciplines in the forensic sciences and necessitates correlation of the autopsy results, scene investigation, medical and social history of the deceased, and laboratory studies. The authors report an unusual case of an apparent homicide/suicide involving 2 individuals and a canine that went undetected for almost 4 years. Determination of the cause and manner of death in these cases involved a multidisciplinary, intercontinental investigation and necessitated the performance of toxicologic studies on specimens not commonly analyzed. These cases illustrate the importance of the multidisciplinary approach to medicolegal death investigations and the necessity of considering nontraditional sources of potential information and specimens for laboratory analysis in selected cases.", 
    "217": "Daily interruption of continuous infusion of sedatives has improved outcomes in patients receiving mechanical ventilation in open-label studies.", 
    "218": "To assess the feasibility of a protocol for a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial study on the impact of routine daily interruption of sedation in patients receiving mechanical ventilation.", 
    "219": "A total of 50 patients receiving mechanical ventilation were randomized to daily interruption of fentanyl and/or midazolam infusions for up to 6 hours or to usual management of sedation. Blinding was achieved by using replacement infusions (saline or active drug in saline).", 
    "220": "The recruitment target of 80 patients was not met in an extended time frame. Propofol was used outside the protocol in 27% of patients in the intervention group and 17% of patients in the control group (P = .10). A total of 15% of the intervention group and 12% of the control group never had replacement infusions started (P = .77), and replacement infusions were started on only approximately one-third of eligible days in patients who received replacement infusions. The mean doses of fentanyl and midazolam were similar. The blinding strategy was safe and effective: no patients had unplanned extubations, and the most frequent reason for ending replacement infusions was completion of the maximum 6-hour period.", 
    "221": "The double-blinded design for assessment of sedation interruption in patients receiving mechanical ventilation was safe and effective. Slow recruitment of patients and frequent noncompliance with the protocol suggest that modifications to the protocol are needed.", 
    "222": "This follow-up study provides an additional 7 years of data (December 2001 through November 2008) pertaining to complications that occurred in patients who received intravenous sedation in the practice of a single board-certified oral and maxillofacial surgeon. Together with the previously published 7 years of data (December 1994 through November 2001), this study summarizes the frequency of various complications encountered in patients sedated intravenously by the surgeon over a 14-year period.", 
    "223": "The files of intravenous sedation cases from the second 7-year period were reviewed for complications. These data were then compared, contrasted, and combined with the previously published sedation cases from the first 7 years.", 
    "224": "A total of 3,320 sedations were performed by the surgeon during this second 7-year period, with only 1.57% of patients having complications (52 patients having 60 adverse events). These results showed a slight decline in the frequency of complications. Over the entire 14-year period of study, a total of 6,209 sedations were performed by the surgeon, with 1.96% of patients having complications (122 patients having 137 adverse events). There were no deaths, and no patients required emergency transport to a hospital.", 
    "225": "The results of this follow-up study confirm the previous findings. The administration of intravenous sedation by the operating surgeon for outpatient oral surgery is safe, with a low frequency of complications. Numerous patients were also made aware of previously undiagnosed medical problems, improving overall patient health."
