    "0": "Differential degree of tolerance has been reported to develop for anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant effects of benzodiazepines (BZDs). Acute treatment with BZDs reportedly reduces the formation of gastric stress ulcers and attenuates stress-induced immunosuppression. The present study investigates whether tolerance develops to these antistress effects of BZDs by using diazepam and chlordiazepoxide as representative drugs. A single dose of diazepam (5 mg/kg, i.p.) or chlordiazepoxide (20 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a significant reduction in locomotor activity, a measure of sedative effect and antagonized the effect of restraint stress (RS) on gastric mucosal lesions and anti-sheep red blood cell (SRBC) antibody titre. With chronic treatment (X 7 d), there was a marked tolerance to the sedative effect of both the studied BZD drugs, while much less tolerance developed to their ulcer protective action. However, no tolerance was observed to the attenuating effect of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide on RS-induced immunosuppression. Thus, the results of the present study indicate that different mechanisms may be involved in the development of tolerance to the sedative, antiulcer and immunomodulatory effects of BZDs.", 
    "1": "Zolpidem, a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic, was identified in the blood of 29 subjects arrested for impaired driving. Zolpidem concentrations ranged from 0.05 to 1.4 mg/L (mean 0.29 mg/L, median 0.19 mg/L). In the subjects whose cases we reviewed where zolpidem was present with other drugs and/or alcohol, symptoms reported were generally those of CNS depression. Symptoms included slow movements and reactions, slow and slurred speech, poor coordination, lack of balance, flaccid muscle tone, and horizontal and vertical gaze nystagmus. In five separate cases, where zolpidem was the only drug detected (0.08-1.40 mg/L, mean 0.65 mg/L, median 0.47 mg/L), signs of impairment included slow and slurred speech, slow reflexes, disorientation, lack of balance and coordination, and \"blacking out.\" Although no quantitative relationship between blood concentrations and degree of driving impairment is currently possible, it is reasonable to conclude that because of its specific activity as a sleep inducer, blood concentrations consistent with therapeutic doses of zolpidem have the potential to affect driving in a negative way, and that concentrations above the normal therapeutic range would further impair a person's level of consciousness and driving ability.", 
    "2": "The influence of midazolam and diazepam on antinociceptive effect of morphine (10 mg/kg), metamizol (500 mg/kg) and indomethacin (10 mg/kg) was investigated in a mouse model using the tail-flick and hot-plate tests. All drugs were injected intraperitoneally. Benzodiazepines were administered to mice 30 min before applying the analgesic drugs. Measurement of nociception was performed within 2 h after benzodiazepine administration. Diazepam at doses of 0.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg injected with morphine was found to decrease the antinociceptive effect of morphine. Similarly, diazepam decreased the antinociceptive effect of metamizol (only in the tail-flick test) and indomethacin. Midazolam used at doses of 1.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg decreased the antinociceptive effect of morphine, metamizol (only in the tail-flick test) and indomethacin.",

Cyclopenin (5) and a compound (6a/6b) structurally related to cyclopenin also were isolated from the fungus, and their structures were established by spectroscopic analysis. The biological activities of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were examined by a bioassay with root-lesion nematodes.", 
    "4": "Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic indicated for the management of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who have failed to respond adequately to standard drug treatment. The significant risk of agranulocytosis and seizure associated with clozapine has led to the restrictions in its use. Additionally, drug-induced sedation, sialorrhea, enuresis, and weight gain are often cited as problematic consequences of clozapine treatment. Our primary objective was to determine the effectiveness and safety of a method of slow cross-titration from clozapine to olanzapine among patients responsive to clozapine treatment but experiencing medication-induced adverse events.", 
    "5": "Changes in symptomatology, mood, subjective response, and safety were examined in 20 outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who converted from clozapine to olanzapine. Patients were considered clozapine-responsive as evidenced by improved social function and decreased symptoms with clozapine therapy; however, they were interested in alternative pharmacologic treatment because of clozapine-related side effects.", 
    "6": "Equivalent efficacy of olanzapine to clozapine was found in 90% of the patients (18/20) in the study group, without rehospitalization or suicidal behavior in any of the patients. Also notable was a reduction in drug-induced side effects and improved subjective response to pharmacotherapy.", 
    "7": "The successful conversion from clozapine to olanzapine has the potential to provide great benefits for the patient, including reducing drug-induced side effects while maintaining symptom control. These preliminary results suggest that further research on converting clozapine responders to olanzapine is warranted.", 
    "8": "An application of recursive cascade correlation (CC) neural networks to quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies is presented, with emphasis on the study of the internal representations developed by the neural networks. Recursive CC is a neural network model recently proposed for the processing of structured data. It allows the direct handling of chemical compounds as labeled ordered directed graphs, and constitutes a novel approach to QSAR. The adopted representation of molecular structure captures, in a quite general and flexible way, significant topological aspects and chemical functionalities for each specific class of molecules showing a particular chemical reactivity or biological activity. A class of 1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones is analyzed by the proposed approach. It compares favorably versus the traditional QSAR treatment based on equations. To show the ability of the model in capturing most of the structural features that account for the biological activity, the internal representations developed by the networks are analyzed by principal component analysis. This analysis shows that the networks are able to discover relevant structural features just on the basis of the association between the molecular morphology and the target property (affinity).", 
    "9": "Two mouse lines were selectively bred according to their sensitivity (BS line) or resistance (BR line) to seizures induced by a single i.p. injection of methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM), an inverse agonist of the GABA(A) receptor benzodiazepine site. Our aim was to characterize both lines' sensitivities to various physiological effects of other ligands of the GABA(A) receptor. We measured diazepam-induced anxiolysis with the elevated plus-maze test, diazepam-induced sedation by recording the vigilance states, and picrotoxin- and pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures after i.p. injections. Results presented here show that the differential sensitivities of BS and BR lines to beta-CCM can be extended to diazepam, picrotoxin, and pentylenetetrazol, suggesting a genetic selection of a general sensitivity and resistance to several ligands of the GABA(A) receptor.", 
    "10": "A method is presented for unattended fully automated extraction and on-line determination of the atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine in serum. An ASPEC automatic sample-preparing apparatus with Isolute cyanopropyl-bonded silicagel cartridges was used for solid-phase extraction of the drugs from serum. The adsorbed drugs were eluted with methanol and an aliquot injected into a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) apparatus. Trifluoperazine was used as internal standard, and the analytes were separated on an unmodified silicagel column using methanol-ammonium acetate buffer pH 9.9 (85:15) as mobile phase. Ultraviolet detection at 257 nm was used for quantitation. Within the therapeutic range for the serum concentration of olanzapine, the interday variations for the quantitative determinations were <8%. Comparisons between concentrations measured using liquid-liquid extraction and the present on-line extraction method showed good agreement. Other drugs often used in combination with olanzapine did not interfere with the quantitative determinations. The method has been in routine use for more than 1 year for therapeutic drug monitoring.", 
    "11": "A prospective study assessed whether routine urine drug screens might alter the management of overdose patients. Urine was collected from 107 patients with a diagnosis of deliberate self-poisoning seen in the emergency department (ED) of a teaching hospital. The mean age of patients was 36 years (range 13-86 years) and 64% were female. All patients recovered after standard investigations and management, which did not include knowledge of urinary drug screen results. Two hundred ninety-seven compounds were detected in the 107 urine samples. Twenty percent were drugs administered in the ED. Sixty-five percent of patients were found to have taken more than one drug. Benzodiazepines were detected in 18% of samples, paracetamol in 10%, and alcohol in 8%. Sixty-one drugs, in 35 people, were identified that the patients did not report taking. Of these, paracetamol (10), benzodiazepines (9), and tetrahydrocannabinol (8) were the most common. All patients in whom paracetamol was found had already had paracetamol detected in blood and appropriate management instituted. If the results of urine screening had been immediately available this would not have affected the management or outcome of any patient.", 
    "12": "Both benzodiazepines and conventional anticonvulsants have been evaluated as treatments for social phobia (social anxiety disorder). Among the benzodiazepines, clonazepam is the best studied, although there is reason to expect that all benzodiazepine anxiolytics would be effective for this condition. Among the anticonvulsants, gabapentin and pregabalin, an analogue of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), have been shown to be more effective than placebo in double-blind studies. Other than a small negative open study of valproic acid for social phobia, there is a paucity of information on whether other anticonvulsants might be useful for this condition.",

The most active dose was 5.0 mg/kg. The blood glucose level was diminished by doses of 1.25, 2.5, 7.5 and 15.0 mg/kg and it was not changed by the rest of the other doses.", 
    "14": "Intraperitoneal administration of 5 mg/kg zopiclone a cyclopyrolone acting on the central benzodiazepine receptors was found to produce significant reduction of total lipids, total cholesterol and triglyceride in rats randered hyperlipidemic by intraperitoneal injection of Triton W-1339. Blood glucose level was also reduced. Flumazenil (10 mg/kg) potentiated the hypoglicemic effect of zopiclone but had no additional effect on serum lipids. PK 11195 (25 mg/kg) antagonized the hypolipidemic effects of zopiclone.", 
    "15": "1. The central benzodiazepine receptors are not involved in the hypolipidemic activity of zopiclone. 2. The peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors are partly responsible, for the hypolipidemic activity of this cyclopirrolone. 3. The changes of blood glucose level induced by these drugs does not seem to be related to benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "16": "Benzodiazepines have dependency-producing properties, and the majority of patients who are prescribed benzodiazepines and are treated for benzodiazepine dependency are women. Inability to cope with withdrawal symptoms may lead to continued consumption of benzodiazepines, often with the development of tolerance and dose escalation as a consequence.", 
    "17": "In the present study we analyzed gender-related differences in reactions to placebo injections in a placebo-controlled study of the effects of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil among patients previously treated for benzodiazepine dependency and healthy controls.", 
    "18": "Ten patients and ten controls (five males and five females in each group) received two placebo injections (separated by 15 min) on two separate occasions (1-13 weeks apart). The patients had been benzodiazepine free for 47 (4-266) weeks on the first occasion. Subjective ratings of symptoms, thought to be important during/after withdrawal of benzodiazepines, were made before and after each injection, as well as registrations of blood pressure and heart rate.", 
    "19": "An overall difference existed between previously benzodiazepine-dependent subjects and healthy controls, with patients scoring higher on negative and somatic aggregates and lower on a positive aggregate. A four-way interaction (group x gender x occasion x time) was found for negative and somatic aggregates, which could mainly be explained by the reactions of female patients. Thus, females had the highest base-line ratings and were the only group that showed a significant reduction in symptom ratings after placebo injections on the first occasion. Gender differences were also found for systolic and diastolic blood pressure. There was no significant response to placebo among male patients or for controls (males or females) for ratings of any variable.", 
    "20": "The results suggest that there might be gender-specific differences in reactions to placebo injections, with female patients being more affected. Arguments for and against explanatory factors such as expectation, provider factors, habituation, regression toward the mean, and reduction of anxiety are presented.", 
    "21": "The anxiogenic DMCM, an inverse benzodiazepine agonist, was used to explore the relationship between negative affective states and pain. Past work suggests that the outcome obtained may depend on both the intensity of the affective state and the way in which pain is inferred.", 
    "22": "The present study was designed to test the impact of relatively low doses of DMCM on multiple measures of pain reactivity and learning.", 
    "23": "In experiment 1, systemic injections of 0.00, 0.015, 0.06, and 0.25 mg/kg DMCM were administered before vocalization and tail movements were assessed in response to a gradually incremented shock and radiant heat stimulus. Experiment 2 tested the effects of DMCM on Pavlovian conditioning. DMCM-treated subjects experienced a context paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) and conditioned freezing was assessed the next day.", 
    "24": "Experiment 1 showed that DMCM inhibits both a spinal nociceptive reflex (tail-flick to heat) and a supraspinal measure of pain (vocalization to shock). Because these inhibitory effects could reflect a disruption in motor function, experiment 2 employed a remote test based on Pavlovian conditioning. A moderate dose of DMCM undermined learning, implying that the drug decreased the affective impact of the aversive US.", 
    "25": "DMCM induces hypoalgesia on a wide range of assays. Furthermore, pharmacologically inducing a negative affective state blocks Pavlovian fear conditioning. It is suggested that DMCM induces a state of panic and that this state inhibits pain.", 
    "26": "The introduction of conventional antipsychotics revolutionized the management of psychotic disorders in the 1950s. The use of these agents has been marked by several shortcomings, including their association with severe motor disturbances and their limited efficacy in treating the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Patients noncompliance has largely been the result of subjectively distressing extrapyramidal motor side-effects (EPMS). It was therefore necessary to develop antipsychotic drugs with selective pharmacological profiles, e.g. limbic selectivity. A defining characteristic of atypical neuroleptics is a higher ratio of serotonin receptor blockade to D2 receptor blockade. Their primary advantage is their superior side-effect profile. The implications of EPMS reduction touch several domains of pathology in schizophrenia such as short- and long-term movement disorders, noncompliance, relapse rate, negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. Novel antipsychotics may represent the second pharmacological revolution in the treatment of psychotic disorders. There is, however, still a need for a critical evaluation of the risk-benefit-ratio of differing atypical agents.", 
    "27": "A HPLC-UV determination of clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam in human serum and urine is presented. After simple liquid-liquid extraction with dichloromethane the compounds and an internal standard diazepam were separated on a Supelcosil LC-8-DB column at ambient temperature under isocratic conditions using the mobile phase: CH3CN-water-0.5 M KH2PO4-H3PO4 (440:540:20:0.4, v/v and 360:580:60:0.4, v/v for serum and urine, respectively). The detection was performed at 228 nm with limits of quantification of 2 ng/ml for serum and 1 ng/ml for urine. Relative standard deviations for intra- and inter-assay precision were found below 8% for both compounds for all the tested concentrations. The described procedure may be easily adapted for several 1,4-benzodiazepines.", 
    "28": "The analysis of clobazam by high-performance liquid chromatography and UV detection is described herein. After adding an internal standard, 600 microl of plasma were extracted under basic conditions onto disposable cartridges packed with celite. The organic extract was then evaporated to dryness and the residue reconstituted in 200 microl of mobile phase. A 20 microl aliquot was injected into chromatograph. The HPLC system was equipped with an Ultrasphere C8 analytical column coupled with an UV detector set at 235 nm. The mobile phase was an acetate buffer 20 mM, pH 5.5, containing acetonitrile and triethylamine 70:30:0.01 (v/v); the flow-rate was 1.8 ml/min. Using this method, clobazam can be detected with a sensitivity limit of 6 ng/ml and the RSD% intra- and inter-assay were lower than 5%. For its ruggedness and reliability, the proposed method is particularly suitable for therapeutic drug monitoring in epilepsy.", 
    "29": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method with amperometric detection for the analysis of the novel antipsychotic drug olanzapine and its metabolite desmethylolanzapine in human plasma has been developed. The analysis was carried out on a reversed-phase column (C8, 150 x 4.6 mm I.D., 5 microm) using acetonitrile-phosphate buffer, pH 3.8, as the mobile phase. The detection voltage was + 800 mV and the cell and column temperature was 30 degrees C. The flow-rate was 1.2 ml min(-1). Linear responses were obtained between 5 and 150 ng ml(-1), with repeatability <3.3%. A careful pretreatment of the biological samples was implemented by means of solid-phase extraction (SPE) on C8 cartridges. The method requires 500 microl of plasma for one complete analysis. Absolute recovery exceeded 97% for both olanzapine and desmethylolanzapine, and the detection limit was 1 ng ml(-1) for both analytes. Repeatability, intermediate precision and accuracy were satisfactory. This sensitive and selective method has been successfully applied to therapeutic drug monitoring in schizophrenic patients treated with Zyprexa tablets.", 
    "30": "About 30-60% of patients with schizophrenia show resistance to neuroleptic treatment. In about 5-20% of them the resistance to antipsychotic treatment appears during the first therapy (primary resistance), however in the rest of patients, treatment resistance develops during 5 to 10 years of the illness (secondary resistance). In addition, another group of 5 to 20% of schizophrenics shows intolerance of therapeutic dosages of neuroleptic drugs. Before the diagnose of treatment resistance has been made, there is the need to reconfirm the diagnosis of schizophrenia, exclusion of other psychiatric disorders, assessment of patients' compliance, drug dosing, as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors which have an impact on the therapeutic effect of antipsychotic treatment. Clozapine seems to be a \"gold standard\" for treatment of drug-resistant schizophrenic patients, however new atypical antipsychotics should be considered as a new therapeutic strategy, even before clozapine. The use of adjunctive treatment with carbamazepine, lithium, valproic acid, benzodiazepines and others, is a reasonable strategy, however dangerous drug interaction has to be taken into account.", 
    "31": "The use of benzodiazepines is not negligible in pregnant woman and self-medication is considerable. To investigate the effects on the fetus of benzodiazepines used during pregnancy, we reviewed animal and clinical studies completed with observations of CRPV (Centres R\u00e9gionaux de Pharmacovigilance). Pooled results indicate that the risk of malformations associated with first-trimester exposure to benzodiazepines remains small. However, in a fetus exposed essentially to long-acting benzodiazepines on a long-term basis, neonatal hypotonicity, failure to feed and/or withdrawal syndrom could be observed.", 
    "32": "Natural cell death is a degenerative phenomenon observed during the normal development of the nervous system. The neuroprotective effects of cytokines produced by neuronal, glial or infiltrating cells on neurons have been extensively studied. In this work we studied the role of interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-4 on the survival of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) after 48 h in culture. Our results demonstrate that the effect of both ILs was dose-dependent and the treatment with either IL-2 (50 U/ml) or IL-4 (5 U/ml) induced a 2-fold increase in RGC survival. The effect of IL-4, but not of IL-2, was totally abolished by either 20 microM 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine, an inhibitor of cell proliferation, or by 1 microM telenzepine, an inhibitor of M1 muscarinic receptor. Our results suggest that both cytokines could play an important role during the development of retinal tissue as well as during retina trauma.",

    "37": "The present study investigated the effects of acute and chronic intraperitoneal administration of Triazolam on g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in different brain areas of albino rats. Three experiments were conducted. In the first, five groups of rats were acutely treated with different doses of Triazolam (0.25 mg/kg-4.0 mg/kg). In the second experiment, rats were treated chronically with a single daily dose of Triazolam (started with 0.25 mg/kg and increased by time to 1.0 mg/kg) for 5 weeks, simulating clinical use. In the third, rats were treated chronically with three daily doses of Triazolam (started with 0.25 mg/kg and increased by time to 0.5 mg/kg) for 20 days, representing a form of drug abuse. Brain levels of GABA and plasma levels of Triazolam were measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The acute Triazolam administration produced an increase in GABA levels in all brain areas studied. The chronic administration of single daily dose of Triazolam produced normal GABA levels in all brain areas except brain stem where the levels were significantly decreased; this indicates the development of tolerance to Triazolam action on increasing GABA content. The chronic administration of three daily doses of Triazolam produced a decrease in GABA levels in all brain regions studied. In conclusion, chronic single daily dose treatment (representing normal use) produces tolerance to Triazolam effects on brain GABA levels, while chronic three daily doses administration (akin to drug abuse) causes a fall in GABA levels.", 
    "38": "As part of a prospective clinical study investigating the effects of atypical neuroleptics on autonomic neurocardiac function (ANF), serial standardized recordings of conventional electrocardiograms and computer-calculated measurements of 5-minute resting heart rate variability (HRV) were obtained from 51 medication-free inpatients with schizophrenia (DSM-III-R-diagnosed) before and after an average of 14.1 days of treatment with amisulpride 400 mg/day (N = 12), olanzapine 20 mg/day (N = 13), sertindole 12 mg/day (N = 13), or clozapine 100 mg/day (N = 13). Reference values for the HRV data were obtained from a large group of well-matched healthy controls (N = 70). The most important findings were the following: (1) clozapine, olanzapine, and sertindole all prolonged mean frequency-corrected QTc times, which, in the case of sertindole, proved to be significant (Wilcoxon test p <0.05); (2) sertindole and clozapine significantly increased the mean resting heart rate; and (3) only clozapine significantly reduced the parasympathetic resting tone. The results of the HRV studies are discussed considering the in vitro receptor profiles of the atypical neuroleptics under study. Potential implications for the cardiac safety and tolerance of these drugs are also discussed.", 
    "39": "Opipramol, a drug widely prescribed in Germany, is a tricyclic compound with no reuptake-inhibiting properties. However, it has pronounced D2-, 5-HT2-, and H1-blocking potential and high affinity to sigma receptors (sigma-1 and sigma-2). In early controlled trials, anxiolytic effects were revealed. However, those studies were performed before the concept of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was established. Because of the interesting receptor-binding profile and promising results of the early clinical trials, the authors performed a state-of-the-art placebo-controlled trial using alprazolam as an active control. Three hundred seven outpatients with GAD were included. After a 7-day single-blind placebo washout, patients were randomly assigned to receive either opipramol (final dose, 200 mg/day), alprazolam (2 mg/day), or placebo and were treated for 28 days. The efficacy of both active compounds was higher than the effects with placebo treatment. There were statistically significant differences (p < 0.05, according to the analysis of covariance) in the main outcome criterion (baseline-adjusted final means of an intent-to-treat analysis of the total scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety) and in secondary efficacy parameters, with global improvement of 47% for placebo and significantly more for opipramol (63%) and alprazolam (64%). Regarding safety and tolerability, no substantial differences in the number of adverse events observed between treatment groups were obvious. Sedation seemed more pronounced with alprazolam treatment than with opipramol or placebo. In this trial, it was demonstrated for the first time that opipramol, a strong but nonselective sigma site ligand, possesses anxiolytic efficacy superior to placebo in the treatment of GAD.", 
    "40": "Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic that is effective in the treatment of schizophrenia. Olanzapine plasma concentrations > or = 9.3 ng/mL (24 hours postdose) have been identified as a predictor of clinical response in acutely ill patients with schizophrenia. The authors report a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of 12-hour olanzapine concentrations and treatment response from the North American Double-Blind Olanzapine Trial. After a 4- to 7-day placebo lead-in, patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for schizophrenia were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine, haloperidol, or placebo. Patients who were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine were given daily doses ranging from 2.5 to 17.5 mg/day for up to 6 weeks. Blood samples for the determination of olanzapine plasma concentrations were obtained between 10 and 16 hours (11.7 +/- 1.7 hours) after the last dose was administered. Therapeutic response data and olanzapine concentrations used for analysis were obtained from the endpoint visit for each patient if the patient had been receiving a fixed olanzapine dose for at least the last 2 weeks of the study. Plasma concentrations from previous visits were used if endpoint concentrations were invalid. Response was defined as a > or = 20% reduction in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores and a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity scale score of < or = 3 or a final BPRS score of < or = 35. The final ROC analysis included data from 84 patients and suggested an olanzapine concentration > or = 23.2 ng/mL to be a predictor of therapeutic response. Fifty-two percent of patients with 12-hour olanzapine concentrations > or = 23.2 ng/mL responded, whereas only 25% of patients with concentrations < 23.2 ng/mL responded. Furthermore, an olanzapine concentration > or = 23.2 ng/mL was a predictor of response in the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (> or = 20% decrease and endpoint CGI < or = 3). Olanzapine concentrations were found to be a function of olanzapine dose (in milligrams per day) and gender such that prospective olanzapine dosing is feasible. A 12-hour olanzapine plasma concentration of > 23.2 ng/mL was a predictor of therapeutic response in acutely ill patients with schizophrenia. Males required a higher olanzapine dose to reach this threshold concentration than their female counterparts.", 
    "41": "More than 50% of patients who seek psychiatric care for panic disorder have previously received prescriptions for a benzodiazepine (BZ). Research on the treatment of generalized anxiety suggests that a history of BZ exposure might decrease the efficacy and tolerability of treatment with a serotonergic anxiolytic. This study examines the effect of prior BZ treatment on the efficacy and tolerability of sertraline treatment for panic disorder. Data were pooled (N = 705) from four double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of the efficacy of sertraline for the treatment of panic. Two of the studies were 12-week fixed-dose studies with starting doses of 50 mg, whereas 2 were flexible-dose studies of 10-week duration with starting doses of 25 mg. The effect of study treatment on the frequency of panic attacks, Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Improvement Scale, and tolerability was examined for patients with or without prior BZ treatment. The efficacy of sertraline was not affected by prior treatment with BZs. The mean endpoint reduction in panic attack frequency was identical in patients with or without prior BZ use: 79% vs. 80% (not significant). A history of good versus poor response to prior BZ treatment did not significantly influence CGI responder rates for sertraline-treated patients (67% vs. 61%, respectively). Sertraline CGI responder rates were significantly greater than placebo response, which was 47% for the good-response prior-BZ subgroup (p = 0.007), and 36% for the poor-response BZ subgroup (p = 0.013). Placebo response was lower in patients with any prior BZ use by 10% on an intent-to-treat last-observation-carried-forward analysis (p = 0.106) and by 15% on a completer analysis (p = 0.045). Prior BZ use did not influence either rates of adverse events or discontinuation rates within the first 3 weeks in patients treated with either sertraline or placebo. Sertraline is both well-tolerated and has significant efficacy in patients with panic disorder, including the subset of patients with panic disorder who have previously been treated with BZs.",

Fifty eight persons were poisoned by ethanol, in remaining 63 cases intoxications were mixed e.g. including benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, carbamazepine, amphetamine, phenothiazines, barbiturates, theophylline, salicylates. In the mixed poisonings group two men (3.2%) died at the age above 50 years old suffering from congestive heart failure, bronchopneumonia and ventricular fibrillation. In the ethanol intoxication group there was no fatal case.", 
    "44": "Over the period of 1995-1999 a total number of 439 cases were admitted to the Clinic of Acute Poisonings, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland, due to poisoning with opiates, opioids, amphetamine, cannabis products, LSD and cocaine. Most of the patients were males, the male to female ratio was 1:1.5 (266 to 173). The distribution by age indicated the persons aged 21-30 yr as the highest risk group, then those aged 14-21 yr. Over the period under study the structure of poisonings changed significantly. Since 1997 the number of poisonings with amphetamine and cannabis products increased dramatically, while that of opiate poisonings declined. Approximately 84% of cases were found to be addicted to a combination of drugs and psychotropic agents, mostly benzodiazepine and ethyl alcohol. Drug addiction was reported by over 80% patients with opiate poisoning, 44.8% with tetrahydrocannabinole poisoning and only 9.5% with amphetamine poisoning. The efficacy of treatment in cases of drug addiction is very low. Repeated treatment was reported by almost 100% of patients who had attempted to quit drug abuse. Among opiate poisoning cases, only 8 out of 45 patients did not question the effectiveness of the withdrawal treatment.",

The seizures are generalized and usually occur abruptly between 6-8 hours after cessation of alcohol use (peak 12-24 hours). These patients are often uncooperative and therefore need careful assessment. Lorazepam is the first-line drug for termination and prophylaxis of alcohol-withdrawal seizures.", 
    "46": "Sixteen children, aged from 2 months to 14 years, with a diagnosis of acute seizures and seen at Dr. Sami Ulus Child Health and Disease Center, were included in this study. Midazolam (5 mg/mL) 0.2 mg/kg was administered intranasally in 30 seconds by an injector. The heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation were recorded at 0, 5, and 10 minutes after administration. The seizures of three (18.7%) patients terminated within 1 minute, of seven (43.7%) patients in 1 to 2 minutes, and of three (18.7%) patients in 2 to 5 minutes. However, three (18.7%) patients did not respond to treatment. As a result, it was concluded that intranasal midazolam administration is easy and effective. The half-life of midazolam is shorter than diazepam, and midazolam has fewer complications when compared with diazepam. It is easier to use in nasal drop and spray forms.",

Women took more psychiatric drugs (45%), as did persons living alone or who had been bereaved (50%). The proportion of patients taking psychiatric drugs was greater when there was worse autonomy according to the Katz index (67%), a cognitive deficit on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) of Pfeiffer (62%), and in the presence of comorbidity (56%) (p < 0.01).",

Patients 1 to 3 had a maternal deletion of 15q11-q13 leading to the loss of beta3 subunit of gamma-aminobutyric acidA/benzodiazepine (GABA(A)/BZ) receptor, whereas Patient 4 had a mutation in the ubiquitin protein ligase (UBE3A) saving the beta3 subunit gene. [11C]FMZ binding potential in the frontal, parietal, hippocampal, and cerebellar regions was significantly lower in Patients 1 to 3 than in Patient 4. We propose that the 15q11-q13 deletion leads to a reduced number of GABA(A)/BZ receptors, which could partly explain the neurological deficits of the AS patients.", 
    "54": "The compound stimulus hypothesis of ethanol discrimination predicts that a history of training to discriminate drugs that mimic individual elements of the ethanol stimulus should attenuate stimulus control by other stimulus elements (associative blocking). Rats were trained initially to discriminate either chlordiazepoxide (5 mg / kg s.c., n = 10) or dizocilpine (0.08 mg / kg i.p., n = 10) from vehicle in two-lever procedures with food reinforcers presented on a tandem variable-interval fixed ratio schedule. Control rats received 'sham training' (vehicle injections only, n = 9). All subjects were then trained to discriminate ethanol (1.5 g / kg intragastrically (i.g.)) until discrimination accuracy reached 95%. Chlordiazepoxide (1.25-10.0 mg / kg s.c.) produced more drug-appropriate responding in rats with a previous history of training to discriminate chlordiazepoxide than in either of the other two groups, but stimulus control by dizocilpine was not attenuated. Equivalent results were obtained in rats with a previous history of training to discriminate dizocilpine. Ethanol (0.375-3.0 g / kg i.g.) produced similar dose-related increases in drug-appropriate responding in all three groups. Thus, previous discrimination training modified the characteristics of ethanol discrimination in a way that may be explained by persistence of the original discriminations. The lack of evidence for associative blocking contrasts with results of previous experiments on the discrimination of compound stimuli produced by administering drug mixtures. The findings provide limited support for the hypothesis that ethanol produces a compound stimulus that includes elements of positive modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptors and of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonism.", 
    "55": "In an earlier study, we postulated that the residual effects of hypnotics could induce a spatial attention disengagement deficit independent of any decrease in alertness. To test this hypothesis, we compared the residual effects of zolpidem, zopiclone and flunitrazepam in two ocular saccade tests, gap and overlap. In the gap paradigm, the lateral target is illuminated 200 ms after the extinguishing of the central target. In the overlap paradigm, the central target stayed on when the lateral target was illuminated. Zopiclone increases latency in the overlap, but not in the gap test, which appears to be specific to a deficit of disengagement of spatial attention. Zopiclone impairs the saccadic precision in gap, but not in overlap, which may be interpreted as an impairment of visuospatial memory. The effects of zolpidem are limited to visuospatial impairment. The effects of flunitrazepam are massive and probably the results of a decrease in alertness.", 
    "56": "The aim of this study was to compare the degree of striatal dopamine D2 receptor availability in patients treated with recommended (5-20 mg, mean dose 11.9 +/- 6.3 mg daily) and higher doses (25-40 mg, mean 32.1 +/- 5.6 mg daily) of the novel antipsychotic drug olanzapine by means of [123I] IBZM Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The results were compared to those of a group of 10 untreated, healthy, age- and sex-matched controls. The degree of dopamine D2 receptor occupancy in the patient group was correlated with the presence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). A total of 20 patients who met the DSM III R criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder received a clinically effective antipsychotic monotherapy with olanzapine. The mean daily dose of olanzapine ranged from 0.05-0.6 mg/kg body weight. The dopamine D2 receptor binding was reduced in all patients treated with olanzapine. Specific IBZM binding expressed as the [STR-BKG]/BKG ratio ranged from 0.13-0.61 (healthy controls 0.95). The D2 receptor availability revealed an exponential dose-response relationship (r = - 0.85, p < 0.001). The frequency of EPS induced by olanzapine was considerably lower. Only one patient, treated with 40 mg olanzapine, suffered from severe EPS symptoms and had to be given biperiden. There were no significant differences in the presence of EPS symptoms between patients with recommended doses and those with higher doses of olanzapine.", 
    "57": "The hypothesis that long-lasting potentiation (LLP) in amygdala efferents to the periacqueductal gray (PAG) of the right hemisphere mediates initiation of lasting increases in defensive response to rats induced by FG-7142 was supported in this study. GABA transmission was potentiated with Vigabatrin (gamma vinyl GABA, GVG), a suicide inhibitor of GABA transaminase. It was predicted that increasing GABA transmission would interfere with LLP and behavioural changes. The hypothesis was confirmed, for the most part. GVG given 1 day prior to FG-7142 prevented increased defensive response to rats as well as LLP in right amygdala efferent transmission to the PAG. It did not prevent LLP in the left amygdalo-PAG pathway, although LLP duration was shortened. Nor did it prevent LLP in the right amygdalo-ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) pathway, and LLP in this pathway was associated with a slightly increased response to vocal threat, but not to rats. GVG given without FG-7142 had no behavioural effects, although it did potentiate transmission in the left amygdalo-PAG pathway. The effects of increasing GABA transmission are consistent with the hypothesis that FG-7142 changes behaviour by inducing a failure of GABA transmission, which in turn facilitates NMDA transmission and NMDA dependent limbic LLP. Finally, the hypothesis that altering GABA tone would change the efficacy of Flumazenil from a neutral antagonist to an inverse agonist was tested on limbic transmission. The hypothesis was confirmed in the left amygdalo-VMH pathway, but no other. It was concluded that mechanisms other than a change in GABA tone account for the drug-dependent reversal of LLP in the right amygdalo-PAG by Flumazenil. The findings of the present study suggest that response to FG-7142 may be a useful model of the effects of traumatic stressors on limbic system function in anxiety.", 
    "58": "The hypothesis that benzodiazepine receptors mediate initiation of lasting behavioural changes induced by FG-7142 was supported in this study. Behavioural changes normally induced by FG-7142 were blocked by prior administration of the competitive benzodiazepine receptor blocker, Flumazenil. When cats were subsequently given FG-7142 alone, the drug produced lasting behavioural changes in species characteristic defensive responses to rodent and cat vocal threat. FG-7142 also induced long-lasting potentiation (LLP) of evoked potentials in a number of efferent pathways from the amygdala in both hemispheres. Flumazenil given prior to FG-7142 blocked LLP in all but one of the amygdala efferent pathways, suggesting benzodiazepine receptor dependence of initiation of LLP. Three physiological changes were most closely correlated with behavioural changes. LLP in the right amygdalo-ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) and amygdalo-periacqueductal gray (PAG) pathways coincided closely with behavioural changes, as did a reduced threshold for the right amygdalo-VMH evoked potential. Administration of Flumazenil after FG-7142 returned defensive behaviour to pre FG-7142 baseline levels in a drug-dependent manner. At the same time LLP only in the right amygdalo-PAG pathway was reduced by Flumazenil. LLP in other pathways and amygdalo-VMH threshold were unaltered by Flumazenil. Moreover, covariance analyses indicated that increased defensiveness depended solely on LLP in the right amygdalo-PAG. These findings support the view that maintenance of lasting increases in defensive behaviour depend upon LLP of excitatory neural transmission between amygdala and lateral column of the PAG in the right hemisphere. Moreover, FG-7142 may be a useful model of the effects of traumatic stressors on limbic system function in anxiety, especially in view of the recent data in humans implicating right hemispheric function in persisting negative affective states in post-traumatic stress disorder.", 
    "59": "We reported a 6-year-old girl with Rett syndrome with severe apnea attacks following hyperventilation during wakefulness for which oral diazepam, 1.5 mg per day, showed marked effect. We evaluated the efficacy of diazepam by polysomnography. Polygraphical examinations revealed decrease of apnea attacks from 15.7/hour to 0.6/hour and of the duration of the longest apnea attack from 40 seconds to 18 seconds. These results support the previous reports which suggests involvement of the cerebral cortex and the reticular formation for respiratory disturbance in Rett syndrome.",

Intra-accumbens perfusion with the 100 and 1000 nM concentration of CCK-8S was associated with a significant decrease (-16+/-3% and -23+/-3% vs basal, respectively) in ventral pallidum GABA levels. The CCK-8S (1000 nM) induced decrease in ventral pallidal dialysate GABA levels was abolished when PD134308, TTX and bicuculline, but not L-364,718, were included into the perfusion medium of the accumbens probe. The data indicate that nucleus accumbens CCK-8S exerts a CCK2 receptor mediated inhibition of ventral pallidal GABA levels. Furthermore, the TTX and bicuculline sensitivity of this effect suggests that this is possibly mediated via CCK2 receptors probably located on local GABA interneurons.", 
    "61": "The effects of Uncaria tomentosa total alkaloid and its oxindole alkaloid components, uncarine E, uncarine C, mitraphylline, rhynchophylline and isorhynchophylline, on the impairment of retention performance caused by amnesic drugs were investigated using a step-down-type passive avoidance test in mice. In this test, the retention performance of animals treated with the amnesic and test drugs before training was assessed 24 h after training. Uncaria tomentosa total alkaloid (10-20 mg kg(-1), i.p.) and the alkaloid components (10-40 mg kg(-1), i.p.), as well as the muscarinic receptor agonist oxotremorine (0.01 mg kg(-1), i.p.), significantly attenuated the deficit in retention performance induced by the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine (3 mg kg(-1), i.p.). The effective doses of uncarine C and mitraphylline were larger than those of other alkaloid components. Uncarine E (20 mg kg(-1), i.p.) also blocked the impairment of passive avoidance performance caused by the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine (15 mg kg(-1), i.p.) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (+/-)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP; 7.5 mg kg(-1), i.p.), but it failed to affect the deficit caused by the benzodiazepine receptor agonist diazepam (2 mg kg(-1), i.p.). Rhynchophylline significantly reduced the mecamylamine-induced deficit in passive avoidance behaviour, but it failed to attenuate the effects of CPP and diazepam. These results suggest that Uncaria tomentosa total alkaloids exert a beneficial effect on memory impairment induced by the dysfunction of cholinergic systems in the brain and that the effect of the total alkaloids is partly attributed to the oxindole alkaloids tested. Moreover, these findings raised the possibility that the glutamatergic systems are implicated in the anti-amnesic effect of uncarine E.", 
    "62": "The authors investigated the role of phobic responsivity in the generation of phobia-relevant illusory correlations. As a means of disentangling the contributions of prior fear and elicited fear responses, half of a group of phobic women received 1 mg alprazolam (n = 21), and half received a placebo (n = 22). A group of nonfearful women (n = 24) was included to control for prior fear per se. Participants were exposed to slides of spiders, weapons, and flowers that were randomly paired with a shock, a siren, or nothing. Postexperimental covariation estimates and on-line outcome expectancies were assessed. Irrespective of both prior and elicited fear, participants postexperimentally overassociated spiders and shock. Yet, only women with spider phobia displayed a persisting fear-confirming expectancy bias. This bias was similar for the placebo and alprazolam groups. Thus, the bias appeared to be due to preexisting phobogenic beliefs, whereas phobic responsivity played a negligible role.",

The present study investigated the anxiolytic and antidepressant actions of the bioactive glycowithanolides (WSG), isolated from WS roots, in rats. WSG (20 and 50 mg/kg) was administered orally once daily for 5 days and the results were compared by those elicited by the benzodiazepine lorazepam (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) for anxiolytic studies, and by the tricyclic anti-depressant, imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), for the antidepressant investigations. Both these standard drugs were administered once, 30 min prior to the tests. WSG induced an anxiolytic effect, comparable to that produced by lorazepam, in the elevated plus-maze, social interaction and feeding latency in an unfamiliar environment, tests. Further, both WSG and lorazepam, reduced rat brain levels of tribulin, an endocoid marker of clinical anxiety, when the levels were increased following administration of the anxiogenic agent, pentylenetetrazole. WSG also exhibited an antidepressant effect, comparable with that induced by imipramine, in the forced swim-induced 'behavioural despair' and 'learned helplessness' tests. The investigations support the use of WS as a mood stabilizer in clinical conditions of anxiety and depression in Ayurveda.",

Although there is little argument that generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus (GNSE) does not cause lasting deficits, there is still debate regarding the morbidity of complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). Because the EEG is used for diagnosis, a strong argument can be made that NCSE is significantly under-recognized and diagnosed. Furthermore, since the documented cases of permanent neurologic sequelae are few, the potential permanent morbidity from CPSE may be significantly exaggerated. The literature indicates that comatose patients have a poor prognosis largely as a result of comorbid conditions and coma, whereas lightly obtunded or slightly confused patients with NCSE have little or no sequelae. Patients with NCSE may suffer (hypotension and respiratory suppression) from iatrogenic 'aggressive' treatment with intravenous anti-epileptic drugs (IV-AEDs), and the findings in the literature indicate that subjects treated with benzodiazepines may have a worse prognosis. The clinician must balance the potential but rare neurologic morbidity associated with NCSE against the not infrequent morbidity caused by IV-AEDs.

    "85": "Retigabine (N-(2-amino-4-(4-fluorobenzylamino)phenyl) carbamic acid ethyl ester, CAS 150812-12-7, D-23129) is a novel anticonvulsant currently undergoing phase II clinical trials. The compound was shown to possess broad spectrum and potent anticonvulsant properties both in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism of action of this drug is currently not fully understood. In previous studies a potent opening effect on K+ channels and an increased release of newly synthesized gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the interaction of retigabine with GABA, kainate and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) induced currents as well as with voltage gated Na+ and Ca++ channels. Retigabine concentration dependently potentiated GABA induced currents in rat cortical neurones. Significant effects were only seen with concentrations of 10 mumol/l and above. The action of retigabine was not antagonised by flumazenil indicating interaction with other than benzodiazepine binding sites. In comparison with the K+ channel opening effect which can be seen at concentrations as low as 0.1 mumol/l the contribution of this mechanism to the anticonvulsant activity of retigabine may be minor. Inhibitory effects observed on voltage activated Na+ and Ca++ channels as well as on kainate induced currents were only observed at the highest concentration tested (100 mumol/l) and can be considered non specific. No significant interaction with NMDA induced currents was observed.",

    "91": "The pronounced benzodiazepine (antiphobic) modulation of the amplitude-temporal parameters of different components of the thalamocortical responses (TCR) of the sensorimotor cortex is observed in rabbits in their early postnatal ontogeny. This modulation is of a dose-dependent character and is registered not after the injection of tazepam in a concentration of the \"therapeutic tranquilizing window\" but also in the psychotoxic plasma range. A gradual increase in blood tazepam concentration in a young rabbit pup is accompanied by the wave-like and differential decrease in the amplitude of the second and third positive (P2 and P3) and third negative (N3) TCR components, while the second negative (N2) and fourth positive (P4) components tend to a wave-like increase. The dose-dependent dynamics of tazepam modulation of the P2, P3, and N3 latencies is characterized by a wave-like and differential increase. The latency of P4 decreases slightly and that of the N2 increases with a low degree of significance. The selective dynamics of benzodiazepine modulation appears to be related with peculiarities of the electrogenesis of each of the components. The dose-dependent modulation of the level of cortical DC potential is of the same character as the respective amplitude changes in P2, P3, and N3, but its fluctiatuons are more pronounced.", 
    "92": "The effect of activation of GABAA, benzodiazepine, and D2 dopamine receptors on extinction of passive avoidance and their dependence on the initial state of aggressive and submissive C57BL/6J mice were studied. It was found that in mice with the submissive stereotype of behavior produced by experience of defeats in daily agonistic confrontations, extinction of the conditioned reaction occurred faster than in control mice. The activation of D2 receptors by quinpirole and of benzodiazepine receptors by medasepam before training restored the retrieval of the memory trace. A prolongation of extinction was observed in aggressive mice in comparison with control and submissive animals, and activation of GABAA by muscimol and benzodiazepine receptors by medazepam led to acceleration of extinction. Activation of D2 receptors was ineffective. Thus, the difference in initial behavioral strategy determined both the development of extinction of the passive avoidance and variability of participation of D2, GABAA, and benzodiazepine receptors in the maintenance of availability of the memory trace to retrieval.",

They kept a daytime sleepiness test and a sleep log, and their wrist-activity was monitored simultaneously. Subjectively, BL increased daytime sleepiness and naps, and decreased night-time sleep. Triazolam decreased daytime sleepiness and naps, and increased night-time sleep. Actigraphic night-time sleep and naps on the first day were similar to these results.

    "108": "Propofol and midazolam are commonly used as sedatives for critically ill patients. These patients usually suffer from the pathologic effects of oxidative stress, predominantly caused by an imbalance between the generation of reactive oxygen species and the antioxidant defense system. Therefore, the antioxidant activities of propofol and midazolam may be of clinical importance. We investigated the activities of these two sedatives against hydrophilic or lipophilic peroxyl radicals in a homogeneous solution and in the presence of erythrocyte membranes. A chemical analysis of the homogeneous solution revealed that propofol efficiently scavenged hydrophilic peroxyl radicals (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 1.3 x 10(-4) M), whereas midazolam efficiently scavenged lipophilic radicals (IC50 = 1.5 x 10(-5) M). Further, in membrane systems, propofol inhibited the oxidative damage induced by either hydrophilic or lipophilic radicals (IC50 = 1.5 x 10(-5) M for hydrophilic radicals and IC50 = 3.0 x 10(-4) M for lipophilic radicals), whereas midazolam did very little. In previous studies, we demonstrated that antioxidant activity is highly affected by the location and properties of the reaction site. The discrepancy in antioxidant activity between a homogeneous condition and in the presence of membranes can be well explained by this concept, and again emphasizes the importance of membranes in determining antioxidant activity. To further understand the biologic significance of these antioxidant properties, the effect of the two agents on endothelium-dependent relaxation was studied. Application of oxidative stress to aortic rings by treating them with peroxyl radicals led to a significant blockade of acetylcholine-induced relaxation after submaximal contraction with phenylephrine. Propofol pretreatment greatly attenuated the impairment in comparison with midazolam, which agrees with the concept of antioxidant activity in the presence of membranes. The results of the present study suggest that propofol has a greater potential to reduce oxidative stress than midazolam.", 
    "109": "Some of anesthetic drugs cause cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial depression, blood pressure as well as hepatic and renal blood flow decrease. The aim of the following research study was the evaluation of midazolam effect on hemodynamic parameters in propranolol-treated rabbits. The following parameters: cardiac output and stroke volume, peripheral blood resistance, heart rate and blood pressure were estimated in the hemodynamics study. Blood pressure was significantly higher in case of propranolol and midazolam therapy as compared with midazolam alone. Blood pressure inconstancy did not exceed 20% of the initial value. Midazolam did not improve the depressive effect of propranolol on heart rate. The peripheral vascular resistance in coherent propranolol and midazolam therapy oscillated at the values observed after sole midazolam administration. After midazolam administration with propranolol, insignificant increase of cardiac output and stroke volume during the first minutes of experimental protocol correlated with marked decrease of peripheral blood resistance at the same time.", 
    "110": "The stress hormones plasma concentration after intravenous anesthetics (thiopentone, propofol, midazolam) administration in patients who underwent non-toxic struma operation was estimated. The goal of the study was to answer what stage of the general anesthesia and the surgery is the most dangerous for the cardiovascular system in term of stress hormones concentration and which of induction anesthetics used significantly alleviates undesirable reactions to surgical trauma and general anesthesia. 45 women aged 43 +/- 11, who underwent non-toxic struma operation and 16 women who underwent biliary gall-stones operation served as the 'study group and controls', respectively. Both groups were divided into 3 subgroups (in each a different anesthetic was used). Blood samples were taken at moments of increased stress during general anesthesia and operation. Intubation performed by laryngoscopy was found as the most stressful moment at which stress hormones are released intensively and can initiate cardiovascular disorders. According to our investigations, the suppression of the stress hormones (noradrenaline and cortisol) release was observed when propofol and midazolam were used for anesthesia induction for non-toxic struma surgery in contrast to thiopentone administration.", 
    "111": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor is an important site of action of a variety of chemicals, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines, picrotoxin, bicuculline, general anesthetics, alcohols, and certain insecticides. Fipronil is the first phenylpyrazole insecticide introduced for pest control. It is effective against some insects that have become resistant to the existing insecticides. To elucidate the mechanism of fipronil interaction with the mammalian GABA system, whole-cell patch-clamp experiments were performed using rat dorsal root ganglion neurons in primary culture. Fipronil suppressed the GABA-induced whole-cell currents reversibly in both closed and activated states. The IC(50) values and Hill coefficients for fipronil block of the GABA(A) receptor were estimated to be 1.66 +/- 0.18 microM and 1.23 +/- 0.14 for the closed receptor, respectively, and 1.61 +/- 0.14 microM and 0.96 +/- 0.06 for the activated receptor, respectively. The association rate and dissociation rate constants of fipronil effect were estimated to be 673 +/- 220 M(-1) s(-1) and 0.018 +/- 0.0035 s(-1) for the closed GABA(A) receptor, respectively, and 6600 +/- 380 M(-1) s(-1) and 0.11 +/- 0.0054 s(-1) for the activated GABA(A) receptor, respectively. Thus, both the association and dissociation rate constants of fipronil for the activated GABA(A) receptor are approximately 10 times as large as those for the closed receptor. Experiments with coapplication of fipronil and picrotoxinin indicated that they did not compete for the same binding site to block the receptor. It is concluded that although fipronil binds to the GABA(A) receptor without activation, channel opening facilitates fipronil binding to and unbinding from the receptor.", 
    "112": "The effects of long-term treatment with imipramine or mirtazapine, two antidepressant drugs with different mechanisms of action, on the response of cortical dopaminergic neurons to foot-shock stress or to the anxiogenic drug FG7142 were evaluated in freely moving rats. As expected, foot shock induced a marked increase (+ 90%) in the extracellular concentration of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex of control rats. Chronic treatment with imipramine or mirtazapine inhibited or prevented, respectively, the effect of foot-shock stress on cortical dopamine output. Whereas acute administration of the anxiogenic drug FG7142 induced a significant increase (+ 60%) in cortical dopamine output in control rats, chronic treatment with imipramine or mirtazapine completely inhibited this effect. In contrast, the administration of a single dose of either antidepressant 40 min before foot shock, had no effect on the response of the cortical dopaminergic innervation to stress. These results show that long-term treatment with imipramine or mirtazapine inhibits the neurochemical changes elicited by stress or an anxiogenic drug with an efficacy similar to that of acute treatment with benzodiazepines. Given that episodes of anxiety or depression are often preceded by stressful events, modulation by antidepressants of the dopaminergic response to stress might be related to the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of these drugs.", 
    "113": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can be divided into two groups: those administered as the prodrug, i.e., the lactone form (e.g., simvastatin and lovastatin), and those administered in the active form, i.e., the acid form (e.g., pravastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, and cerivastatin). In this study, the influence of the lactone and acid forms of various HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on metabolism by CYP3A4, a major cytochrome P450 isoform in human liver, was investigated by determining the in vitro inhibition constant (K(i) value) using an antianxiety agent, mexazolam, as a probe substrate. In human liver microsomes, all the lactone forms tested inhibited the oxidative metabolism of mexazolam more strongly than did the acid forms, which have lower partition coefficient (logD(7.0)) values. In addition, the degree of inhibition of mexazolam metabolism tended to increase with an increasing logD(7.0) value of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors among the lactone and acid forms. In particular, pravastatin (acid form), which has the lowest logD(7.0) value, failed to inhibit CYP3A4 activity. Taking account of the lipophilicity of the inhibitors, in conjunction with the CYP3A4-inhibitory activity, could be very useful in predicting drug interactions between substrates of CYP3A4 and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.", 
    "114": "A new parallel liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) system has been developed, in which the mass detector was shared between two staggered parallel chromatographic runs. Since the chromatography for biofluids assay generally requires good analyte retention and thus tends to leave large blank chromatographic windows, this parallel system allowed the efficient use of the mass detector during these blank windows, resulting in significantly improved sample throughput. Also, in order to remove the bottleneck in sample extraction for this parallel separation system, a high-flow extraction device was used to perform on-line extraction. This allowed for the direct injection of biofluids onto the system. The performance and capability of this system was evaluated in tests that contained a single analyte (oxazepam) and multiple analytes (12-in-1). The results indicated that the data generated from this system were comparable to those obtained on a conventional single-column system. An application of the system for high-throughput pharmacokinetic screening of drug candidates was also demonstrated.", 
    "115": "The effects of three chronically administered antipsychotic drugs on selected neurochemical markers of dopaminergic and GABAergic transmission were compared within the cerebral regions making up the basal ganglia-thalamocortical parallel processing neuronal pathways. All three drugs reduce psychosis in humans, whereas only haloperidol, but not olanzapine or sertindole, induce purposeless oral chewing movements (CMs) in rats or cause high rates of parkinsonism or tardive dyskinesia in humans. Male Sprague Dawley rats were treated with haloperidol, sertindole, or olanzapine delivered in drinking water for 6 months at doses which produce drug plasma levels in rat in the human therapeutic range. Results show the expected dopamine D2 receptor upregulation in striatum predominantly with haloperidol, although mild D2 upregulation was apparent in striatum after olanzapine. GAD67 mRNA was increased in striatum and decreased in globus pallidus by haloperidol and sertindole, but not by olanzapine. In the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR), both olanzapine and sertindole failed to induce GABA(A) receptor upregulation or D1 receptor downregulation, but haloperidol did both, confirming a previous report. In thalamus, all three drugs increased GAD expression in the reticular nucleus, whereas only haloperidol decreased GABA(A) binding in the mediodorsal nucleus, actions consistent with a reduction in nigrothalamic, GABA-mediated neural transmission. These results are consistent with the idea that the two new antipsychotics tested have mild and regionally restricted actions within the basal ganglia nuclei and a common action on increasing GAD expression in the reticular nucleus of the thalamus (RtN). Haloperidol, in contrast, has a broad and potent action in basal ganglia, causing changes in SNR and in the mediodorsal nucleus, while also altering GAD mRNA in RtN, potentially reflective of its dyskinetic and antipsychotic actions.", 
    "116": "Diazepam is used clinically for its myorelaxant, anxiolytic, sedative, and anticonvulsant properties. Although the anxiolytic action is mediated by alpha2 gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) receptors, the sedative action and in part the anticonvulsant action are mediated by alpha1 GABA(A) receptors. To identify the GABA(A) receptor subtypes mediating the action of diazepam on muscle tone, we have assessed the myorelaxant properties of diazepam in alpha2(H101R) and alpha3(H126R) knock-in mice harboring diazepam-insensitive alpha2 or alpha3 GABA(A) receptors, respectively. Whereas in alpha2(H101R) mice the myorelaxant action of diazepam was almost completely abolished at doses up to 10 mg/kg, the same dose induced myorelaxation in both wild-type and alpha3(H126R) mice. It was only at a very high dose (30 mg/kg diazepam) that alpha2(H101R) mice showed partial myorelaxation and alpha3(H126R) mice were partially protected from myorelaxation compared with wild-type mice. Thus, the myorelaxant activity of diazepam seems to be mediated primarily by alpha2 GABA(A) receptors and at high concentrations also by alpha3 GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "117": "The objective of this study was to examine the role of oxygen radicals, protein kinase C (PKC), and ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels in mediating flumazenil-produced preconditioning. Chick cardiomyocyte death was quantified using propidium iodide, and oxygen radical generation was assessed using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin oxidation. Preconditioning was initiated with 10 min of ischemia followed by 10 min of reoxygenation. Alternatively, flumazenil was infused for 10 min and removed 10 min before ischemia. Flumazenil (10 microM) and preconditioning increased oxygen radicals [1,693 +/- 101 (n = 3) and 1,567 +/- 98 (n = 3), respectively, vs. 345 +/- 53 (n = 3) in control] and reduced cell death similarly [22 +/- 3% (n = 5) and 18 +/- 2% (n = 6), respectively, vs. controls 49 +/- 5% (n = 8)]. Protection and increased oxygen radicals by flumazenil were abolished by pretreatment with the antioxidant thiol reductant 2-mercaptopropionyl glycine (800 microM; 52 +/- 10%, n = 6). Specific PKC inhibitors Go-6976 (0.1 microM) and chelerythrine (2 microM), given during ischemia and reoxygenation, blocked flumazenil-produced protection (47 +/- 5%, n = 6). The PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (0.2 microM), given during ischemia and reoxygenation, reduced cell death similarly to that with flumazenil [17 +/- 4% (n = 6) and 22 +/- 3% (n = 5)]. Finally, 5-hydroxydecanoate (1 mM), a selective mitochondrial K(ATP) channel antagonist given during ischemia and reoxygenation, abolished the protection of flumazenil and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Thus flumazenil mimics preconditioning to reduce cell death in cardiomyocytes. Oxygen radicals activate mitochondrial K(ATP) channels via PKC during the process.", 
    "118": "Although cardiac Purkinje cells (PCs) are believed to be the source of early afterdepolarizations generating ventricular tachyarrhythmias in long Q-T syndromes (LQTS), the ionic determinants of PC repolarization are incompletely known. To evaluate the role of the slow delayed rectifier current (I(Ks)) in PC repolarization, we studied PCs from canine ventricular false tendons with whole cell patch clamp (37 degrees C). Typical I(Ks) voltage- and time-dependent properties were noted. Isoproterenol enhanced I(Ks) in a concentration-dependent fashion (EC(50) approximately 30 nM), negatively shifted I(Ks) activation voltage dependence, and accelerated I(Ks) activation. Block of I(Ks) with 293B did not alter PC action potential duration (APD) in the absence of isoproterenol; however, in the presence of isoproterenol, 293B significantly prolonged APD. We conclude that, without beta-adrenergic stimulation, I(Ks) contributes little to PC repolarization; however, beta-adrenergic stimulation increases the contribution of I(Ks) by increasing current amplitude, accelerating I(Ks) activation, and shifting activation voltage toward the PC plateau voltage range. I(Ks) may therefore provide an important \"braking\" function to limit PC APD prolongation in the presence of beta-adrenergic stimulation.",

    "133": "Twelve patients with PD received biperiden hydrochloride (a muscarinic antagonist that crosses the blood-brain barrier), pirenzepine hydrochloride (a muscarinic antagonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier), or placebo 2 hours before a 35% carbon dioxide-65% oxygen respiratory challenge (vs air as a placebo) on 3 separate days, in a double-blind, random crossover design.", 
    "134": "According to patients' self-ratings of subjective anxiety, inhalation of the carbon dioxide/oxygen mixture provoked a significant and intense response after treatment with pirenzepine and placebo. After biperiden treatment, however, hypercapnia elicited a response profile similar to that elicited by air, whereby subjective anxiety remained similar to preinhalation levels.", 
    "135": "Consistent with the hypothesis of the study, a centrally active muscarinic antagonist can block the response to carbon dioxide commonly observed in subjects with PD.", 
    "136": "The cardiovascular effects of halogenated anesthetic agents in children with normal hearts have been studied, but data in children with cardiac disease are limited. This study compared the effects of halothane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, and fentanyl-midazolam on systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics and myocardial contractility in patients with congenital heart disease.", 
    "137": "Fifty-four patients younger than age 14 scheduled to undergo congenital heart surgery were randomized to receive halothane, sevoflurane, isoflurane, or fentanyl-midazolam. Cardiovascular and echocardiographic data were recorded at baseline and at randomly ordered 1 and 1.5 minimum alveolar concentrations, or predicted equivalent fentanyl-midazolam plasma concentrations. The shortening fraction and ejection fraction (using the modified Simpson rule) were calculated. Cardiac index was assessed by the velocity-time integral method.", 
    "138": "Halothane caused a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure, ejection fraction, and cardiac index, preserving only heart rate at baseline levels. Fentanyl-midazolam in combination caused a significant decrease in cardiac index secondary to a decrease in heart rate; contractility was maintained. Sevoflurane maintained cardiac index and heart rate and had less profound hypotensive and negative inotropic effects than halothane. Isoflurane preserved both cardiac index and ejection fraction, had less suppression of mean arterial pressure than halothane, and increased heart rate.", 
    "139": "Isoflurane and sevoflurane preserved cardiac index, and isoflurane and fentanyl-midazolam preserved myocardial contractility at baseline levels in this group of patients with congenital heart disease. Halothane depressed cardiac index and myocardial contractility.", 
    "140": "Patients with end-stage liver disease routinely undergo an upper endoscopy for the diagnosis and management of complications of portal hypertension. These cirrhotic patients inherently have additional risks and higher rates of complications secondary to their liver disease and the presence of portal hypertension. Additional considerations and precautions must be taken into account to ensure that the endoscopic procedure is performed with the minimal risks possible. This article discusses the management of cirrhotic patients undergoing endoscopy. It addresses clinical clues for identifying the cirrhotic patient, the use of medications and monitoring equipment for vital signs during endoscopy, blood product administration in acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and elective and urgent procedures to diagnose and treat cirrhotic patients."
