These procedures may actually produce pain, or they may be perceived as causing pain and anxiety. The article will also focus on the design of a patient-specific outpatient treatment plan for managing and reducing short-term procedural-induced anxiety, as perceived pain and anxiety or pain and anxiety themselves may be a reason for which patients are noncompliant with their office visits. The treatment plan will focus on pre-procedure, peri-procedure, and post-procedure interventions using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anxiolytics (benzodiazepines, opiate agonists, and sedative hypnotics). The plan also includes adjuvant therapy to decrease the patient's perception of pain, anxiety, fear of procedure, and fear of outcomes in order to facilitate a higher degree of compliance with office procedures. This article also accounts for the patient's physiology, pathophysiology, pathology, and iatrogenic effects from drug treatment plans.", 
    "1": "The main aim of the present work was to study whether the effect of diazepam upon successive negative contrast in one-way avoidance learning-induced by shifting rats from a large reward (30s spent in the safe compartment) to a small reward (1s)-is mediated by the action of this drug on the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor. Therefore, we studied the influence of flumazenil (FL), a BZ antagonist, on the effect of diazepam (DZ) on negative contrast. The i.p. administration of 5 and 12mg/kg, but not of 2mg/kg of FL, reliably antagonized the abolition by DZ (1mg/kg) on successive negative contrast. Moreover, FL (12mg/kg) did not affect either the avoidance response or the contrast effect. These results suggest that the GABA system is involved in the successive negative contrast effect in one-way avoidance learning, and that this experimental procedure may be useful in studies of anti-anxiety agents.", 
    "2": "A pilot study was designed to assess the feasibility of a shared regional drug use evaluation (DUE) program involving patients. A retrospective DUE on the use of benzodiazepines, chloral hydrate and neuroleptics for bedtime sedation was performed on geriatric patient populations from two hospitals. Regional program staff coordinated the DUE, including development of the criteria and chart review. The participating Pharmacy departments performed the internal administrative and Pharmacy and Therapeutics committee communications. Forty patient charts from two sites were reviewed. The DUE results indicated different rates of drug use and discontinuation of therapy between the two geriatric patient populations. The overall rates of inappropriate drug use were similar. One undesirable clinical outcome occurred. Benzodiazepine use for more than 30 days was high in both groups. Identification of the justification for drug use, dosage reduction and drug discontinuation did not occur in the majority of patients. The pilot study identified areas where use of bedtime sedation could be improved, and allowed development of DUE criteria for future evaluation.",

A 6-point scale was used to assess response to medication, and a 12-point recovery score was used to determine readiness for discharge. Both groups were similar in age and sex distribution. There were no significant adverse effects in either group. Patients tolerated the IN regimen better than the IM regimen.

    "12": "This investigation was designed with the objective of improving on currently available antiemetic regimens to counteract the disabling side effects of cancer chemotherapy. The combination of lorazepam, dexamethasone, and promethazine was compared with dexamethasone and promethazine without lorazepam in a double-blind crossover study. The initial study population consisted of 92 women (most with breast cancer) and 7 men; all received moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy. Complete data for both periods of therapy were available for 73 of these patients. Crossover analysis showed a highly significant effect of lorazepam in reducing the severity of nausea (p = .003); the severity of vomiting was also reduced, but less dramatically (p = .051). The frequency of all degrees of nausea and vomiting was less with lorazepam, but the difference was not statistically significant. It is concluded that lorazepam added to dexamethasone and promethazine provides an effective regimen for counteracting the emetic side effects of cancer chemotherapy.", 
    "13": "Many agents are available for sedation of agitated, delirious patients. In general, they should be administered intravenously to achieve a painless, more rapid, and more reliable onset of action. Proper selection of an agent requires understanding the basic principles discussed in this article, including the T-1/2 alpha and T-1/2 beta and the side-effect profile associated with each class of drugs, as well as for each agent. As a group, BNZs tend to be the safest and most predictable, and can be titrated easily when administered intravenously. Neuroleptic agents such as haloperidol may act synergistically with BNZs, resulting in control of agitation without significantly depressing the patient's level of consciousness or respiratory drive. Barbiturates, highly effective sedatives, more profoundly depress the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, and probably should be reserved for the severely agitated patient who cannot be controlled otherwise. Etomidate and propofol, useful for short-term procedures, probably should be avoided for long-term use in the agitated patient because of potentially serious side effects. Opioids should be used to provide adequate pain relief and to supplement other sedatives. Inadequate doses or dosing regimens should be avoided. Once sedation has been achieved, control usually can be maintained with continuous intravenous infusions of BNZs, perhaps in combination with a continuous infusion of an opioid or intermittent administration of a neuroleptic agent. With goal-oriented titration of the pharmacologic therapy, patients can be maintained safely in a sedate, calm state; intermittent periods of agitation, alternating with periods of severely depressed level of consciousness, can be avoided. Finally, when pharmacologic suppression of agitation and delirium is needed, the patient must be evaluated fully to determine the underlying cause of the confusional state.",

Increases in the powerbands delta and theta indicated induction of sleep approximately 15-20 minutes after application and were not looked upon as an effect of the benzodiazepine exclusively. These increases were noticed first in the central, occipital and temporal areas and after 30 minutes in the frontal parts of the cortex. Flunitrazepam plus morphine showed qualitatively similar but quantitatively less pronounced results. Topographical differences were similar to the results of an application of flunitrazepam alone.",

The low-frequency/high-frequency (LF/HF) ratio of HR variability increased after arrival in the operating room in elderly patients who received no premedication, but not in young patients. In elderly patients who received midazolam or diazepam, the LF/HF ratio did not increase. However, diazepam increased the low-frequency component and the total power of HR variability in both young and elderly patients. We conclude that cardiac sympathetic nerve activity increased after arrival in the operating room in the elderly, that midazolam or diazepam reduced this increase and that diazepam caused an increase in the total power of HR variability that has not been observed for other agents.",

The interactions of diazepam with neuromuscular blocking agents have been extensively studied, yet the results reported are somewhat controversial and inconclusive.", 
    "21": "The interaction of diazepam with one of the neuromuscular blocking agents, vecuronium, was studied in 20 ASA I-II patients undergoing elective surgery. They were randomly assigned to two groups with ten in each group. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl, thiopental and vecuronium and maintained with 1% halothane and 70% N2O in O2. The experimental group received diazepam (0.2 mg/kg) 3 minutes prior to vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg) during induction while the control group received vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg) straight without diazepam. Control records of the integrated electromyography showed the response to train-of-four supramaximal stimulation by a Datex Relaxograph during induction. In no time when the first twitch (T1) recovered to 25% of the control, it was topped up again with another intraoperative dose of vecuronium (0.025 mg/kg). From the derived data, the following parameters were calculated and analysed: (1) onset time T10 (the time from the end of injection of vecuronium during induction to depression of T1 to 10% of control twitch height); (2) duration time T25 (the time from administering vecuronium during induction to the time when T1 recovered to 25% of the original twitch height); (3) topup time T25-25 (the time from administering the top dose of vecuronium to the time when T1 returned to 25% of control twitch height again) and (4) recovery time T25-50 (the time of recovery of T1 from 25% to 50% of the control twitch height at the end of the operation).",

    "24": "Immunosuppression therapy with cyclosporine is often hampered by significant interindividual variability in the metabolic clearance of the drug. It has been suggested that much of the variability in cyclosporine clearance is due to differences in the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) content in the liver and intestinal mucosa. A study was conducted in liver transplant recipients to characterize hepatic CYP3A variability during the first 10 days after surgery. The formation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam (1'-OH MDZ) was followed in the plasma after i.v. midazolam (MDZ) administration to 21 multiple-organ donors and to recipients of 10 of the 21 donor livers. Liver biopsy tissue was obtained from donors and recipients after the in vivo pharmacokinetic test. For liver donors, the plasma 1'-OH MDZ/MDZ concentration ratio 30 min after the i.v. MDZ dose was well correlated with the hepatic CYP3A4 content (r = .87, P < .001). Much of the variability in the two parameters was attributed to the administration of enzyme-inducing drugs before organ procurement. The mean hepatic CYP3A4 content and plasma 1'-OH MDZ/MDZ concentration ratio in six inducer-treated donors was 4.7-fold and 2.3-fold higher than the respective mean value for all other donors. The hepatic CYP3A4 content and plasma 1'-OH MDZ/MDZ ratio for liver recipients, studied on postoperative day 10, was negatively correlated with the respective parameter measured in donors on day 0 (r = -0.60 for CYP3A4 and r = -0.79 for 1'-OH MDZ/MDZ; P < .05 and P < .01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "The clearance of midazolam (MDZ) in humans is principally due to metabolic biotransformation catalyzed by CYP3A isoforms. A study was conducted in patients who had undergone liver transplants that provides evidence that MDZ can be used as an in vivo probe of interindividual hepatic CYP3A variability. The clearance of MDZ and cyclosporine after i.v. administration were determined in 10 patients approximately 10 days after transplant surgery. Liver biopsy specimens were obtained within 24 hr of the pharmacokinetic study and CYP3A content and MDZ 1'-hydroxylation activity were measured in 13,000 x g tissue supernatants (S-13). The in vitro rate of 1'-hydroxy-MDZ formation was found to correlate significantly with the total CYP3A content in hepatic S-13 fractions (r = .84, P < .01). The total MDZ clearance measured in vivo was highly correlated with the hepatic CYP3A content measured in vitro (r = .93, P < .001) and with in vivo cyclosporine clearance (r = .81, P < .001). For five of the patients, the intrinsic clearance of midazolam to 1'-hydroxy-MDZ (Vmax/Km) in vitro measured in S-13 preparations was scaled for total liver mass and applied to the well stirred model of hepatic clearance to yield a prediction of MDZ clearance in vivo. The mean MDZ clearance predicted from in vitro 1'-hydroxylation data was identical to the mean clearance observed in vivo (0.60 +/- 0.24 versus 0.59 +/- 0.25 liter/min). Together, the results suggest that variability in hepatic CYP3A expression in liver transplant recipients, and possibly in other populations, can be determined by the measurement of MDZ metabolic clearance.", 
    "26": "To study the role of the striatum in modulating the effects of adenosine agonists and benzodiazepine inverse agonists on acute ethanol-induced motor impairment, we evaluated the effect of direct intrastriatal Ro15-4513 [0.625, 1.25 and 2.5 ng], a partial inverse agonist of benzodiazepine receptor, on ethanol-induced motor incoordination. A significant and nearly dose-dependent antagonism by Ro15-4513 was observed, which suggests involvement of the striatum in ethanol-induced motor incoordination. No effect of IST Ro15-4513 on motor incoordination induced by Na-pentobarbital (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was noted, indicating the selectivity of the antiethanol action of Ro15-4513. The IST adenosine agonist N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) markedly accentuated ethanol-induced motor incoordination in a dose-related manner, suggesting a striatal adenosinergic modulation of ethanol-induced motor incoordination. The IST Ro15-4513 also significantly antagonized the accentuating effects of CHA on ethanol-induced motor incoordination. No change in normal motor coordination was observed after IST CHA or Ro15-4513 when followed by saline administration instead of ethanol. No accentuating effect by intrahippocampal CHA on ethanol-induced motor incoordination was seen, which suggests the selectivity of striatal adenosinergic modulation of ethanol-induced motor incoordination. There was no significant radioactivity present in the systemic circulation, in the CSF or in brain areas other than striatum after intrastriatal [3H]Ro15-4513 or [3H]CHA and ethanol injection. Data obtained so far support the involvement of striatum in ethanol's ataxia as well as striatal adenosinergic modulation of the central effect(s) of ethanol, possibly through Ro15-4513-sensitive mechanism(s).", 
    "27": "The hydrochloride salt of (S)-3-methyl-5-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl) isoxazole (ABT-418), a potent activator of select subtypes of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors enhanced retention in memory tests and induced anxiolytic-like effects in mice in the elevated plus maze. In the present studies in rats, ABT-418 induced a significant increase in the time spent by the rats in the open arms of the elevated plus maze (0.62 mumol/kg i.p.); the effect persisted up to 60 min after the injection and was blocked by mecamylamine (15 mumol/kg), a centrally acting nicotinic acetylcholine receptor channel blocker. ABT-418 was 6-fold and 1.6-fold more potent than diazepam and ondansetron, respectively. The anxiolytic-like effect of ABT-418 was observed after oral administration in rats (10-30 mumol/kg) and at slightly higher doses in 20-month-old rats (1.9 mumol/kg i.p.). Major metabolites of ABT-418 [(S)-1-methyl-5-(3-methyl-5-isoxazolyl)-2-pyrrolidinone, cis-ABT-418 N-oxide and trans-ABT-418 N-oxide] were inactive in the plus maze in mice up to 6.2 mumol/kg, did not affect body temperature and had minimal effects on locomotion. Like (-)-nicotine, ABT-418 was effective (4 and 13 mumol kg-1 day-1) to induce anxiolytic-like effects after a 14-day treatment through minipumps implanted subcutaneously. Acute administration of ABT-418 (0.62 mumol/kg i.p.) also attenuated the anxiogenic-like effect elicited by withdrawal from chronic (-)-nicotine treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "Oral benzodiazepine self-administration was examined in four adult male rhesus monkeys with histories of ethanol- and pentobarbital-reinforced behavior. Drug solutions and vehicle were concurrently available for 3-hr each day under fixed-ratio (FR) reinforcement schedules. Initially, the monkeys rejected a midazolam solution (0.1 mg/ml) after direct substitution of the drug for an 8% ethanol solution. However, midazolam self-administration was subsequently established by using a fading procedure in which increasing amounts of drug (0.0125-0.2 mg/ml) were gradually added to an 8% ethanol solution, followed by gradual reduction of the ethanol concentration to zero. Midazolam was an effective reinforcer for three of four monkeys tested, i.e., responding that was maintained by the drug solution exceeded that maintained by the drug vehicle. The fourth monkey also self-administered midazolam but drug-maintained responding was not consistently greater than vehicle-maintained responding. The responding maintained by the drug was an inverted-U-shaped or bitonic function of midazolam concentration. The midazolam intake (in milligrams per kilogram) increased as a function of increases in the drug concentration. At the higher concentrations, marked sedative intoxication was observed. There was an inverse relationship between FR size (varied from FR 8 to FR 32) and the amount of drug self-administered. The three monkeys in which midazolam functioned as a reinforcer were then tested with diazepam (0.2 mg/ml), which maintained drug self-administration behavior on direct substitution for 0.2-mg/ml midazolam. Diazepam-maintained responding usually exceeded water responding as the diazepam concentration was increased to 0.8 mg/ml. These data demonstrate robust reinforcing effects of both \"short-\" and \"long-acting\" benzodiazepines delivered by the oral route.", 
    "29": "Various chiral stationary phases were investigated in sub- and supercritical fluid chromatography for the separation, without derivatization, of basic (beta-blockers, benzodiazepines) and acidic (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, beta-agonists) pharmaca. For all racemates, baseline separation was achieved within short analysis times. For several solutes, the high resolution obtained allowed injection of milligram amounts and semipreparative collection of the enantiomers. The parameters affecting enantioselectivity (column efficiency, influence of modifiers and basic or acidic additives, and temperature) have been studied. Enantiomerization of 3-OH-benzodiazepines could be suppressed by working at low temperatures or by using acetonitrile as a comodifier. Serial coupling of different chiral stationary phase columns resulted in a column triplet (Chiralpak AD, an amylose derivative; Chiralcel OD, a cellulose derivative; and Chirex 3022, a Brush-type with pi-donor characteristics) on which all solutes investigated could be baseline separated.", 
    "30": "Often obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) patients are labeled as treatment refractory when some first-line options have not been fully explored. Most patients should be encouraged to participate in behavior therapy, even when pharmacotherapy alone has been partially successful. Antiobsessional agents such as clomipramine, fluoxetine, and fluvoxamine should be considered first-line drugs. Their prescription for a sufficient time and at therapeutic doses is imperative. Enhancement strategies for a selected group of OCD patients include low-dose high-potency neuroleptics. In addition, clonazepam can be helpful in augmenting the response to a first-line drug. Results from controlled studies with lithium and buspirone have been disappointing. If most of these pharmacologic alternatives fail, MAOIs appear to be the next best choice. Since in the future most referrals for treatment-refractory OCD patients will emanate from nonpsychiatrists, following a systemic strategy in their evaluation and pharmacologic management is most important.", 
    "31": "Zolpidem is a new imidazopyridine-hypnotic that selectively binds to the central omega 1-receptor subtype. A double-blind, randomized, three-way, crossover placebo-controlled study was carried out in nine healthy male volunteers to assess the possible antagonism of central nervous system--depressant effects of zolpidem by flumazenil. Subjects received zolpidem (0.21 mg/kg) or placebo, intravenously, followed 17 minutes later by flumazenil (0.04 mg/kg) or placebo. Vigilance and performance were assessed by a trained anesthetist with use of ciliary reflex, response to a verbal instruction, subjective sedation, a tracking task, and a free recall task. Zolpidem produced a clinically relevant hypnotic effect in five subjects and significantly impaired performance in all nine subjects up to 90 minutes after dosing. Flumazenil rapidly antagonized clinical sedation in the five subjects who were asleep and significantly reversed the performance decrement within 3 minutes, without any escape phenomenon. Flumazenil did not change zolpidem plasma concentrations, confirming the pharmacodynamic nature of the interaction. Flumazenil may thus be a safe and effective antidote in patients with zolpidem overdosage.", 
    "32": "We report the presence of serum autoantibodies directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase in a patient with epilepsy and palatal myoclonus not associated with brain lesions. Glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody reactivity was dependent on the presence of carboxy-terminal amino acids, similar to that reported in patients with stiff-man syndrome. Marked reduction in the frequency of epileptic attacks and improvement in palatal myoclonus occurred when benzodiazepine was administered and phenytoin was gradually tapered. Testing for anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies may be indicated in patients with palatal myoclonus and with convulsive disorders refractory to therapy.", 
    "33": "We studied the comparative vascular effects of midazolam and lorazepam in 52 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery procedures. After administration of fentanyl, 100 micrograms/kg intravenously, the patients were randomized to receive either midazolam 0.1 mg/kg (M high), midazolam 0.05 mg/kg (M low), lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg (L high), lorazepam 0.05 mg/kg (L low), or placebo during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Compared to the placebo and L-low groups, the high-dose midazolam group had more effect on systemic vascular resistance (SVR) starting at 5 min after study drug administration (P < 0.02). M high and L high required increased quantities of phenylephrine administered to maintain the mean arterial pressure (MAP) at > 50 mm Hg after rewarming and removal of the aortic cross-clamp (P < 0.03). In the first 12 h of the postoperative period, the M-high group required phenylephrine (PHE) infusion for hypotension associated with decreased SVR more often than placebo (8/10 vs 1/11 patients, P < 0.008, chi 2). In conclusion, midazolam more effectively attenuated the increase in SVR that occurred during CPB than patients receiving either placebo or lorazepam. The hemodynamic effects from a single dose of 0.1 mg/kg midazolam administered at the start of CPB may persist into the postoperative period.", 
    "34": "The purpose of this study was to compare the perioperative effects of the intramuscular (i.m.) alpha 2 agonist, dexmedetomidine (DEX), and midazolam (MID) premedication. The study comprised 192 women (64 per group) scheduled for abdominal hysterectomy. The doses of the study drugs were chosen to obtain equal sedative effects. The three groups were: 1) i.m. DEX (2.5 micrograms/kg) and intravenous (i.v.) placebo (DexPla group), 2) i.m. DEX and i.v. fentanyl (FENT) (1.5 micrograms/kg) (DexFent group), and 3) i.m. MID (0.08 mg/kg) and i.v. FENT (MidFent group). I.m. drugs were administered 45-90 min before induction of anesthesia. Preoperative sedation and anxiolysis after DEX was comparable to that after MID. The maximum arterial blood pressure response to endotracheal intubation was blunted in the DexFent group, while in the two other groups blood pressure increased 30-34 mm Hg after endotracheal intubation. The mean isoflurane concentration during surgery was 0.14% in the DexFent group, 0.24% in the DexPla group, and 0.34% in the MidFent group (P < 0.001). During surgery, bradycardia (heart rate < 40 bpm) was observed in 6.2% of DEX patients, and no MID patients, whereas postoperatively 14.1% of DEX patients and 1.6% of MID patients had bradycardia. Fewer patients suffered from postoperative shivering after DEX (10%) than after MID (52%). We conclude that DEX has many desirable effects, but side effects such as bradycardia may limit its routine use in ASA physical status I-II patients.", 
    "35": "The mechanism by which lipid in the duodenum inhibits gastric emptying was investigated in awake rats fitted with chronic gastric and duodenal cannulas. Perfusion of the duodenum with lipid (Intralipid, 5 and 10%; total amount 50 and 100 mg) caused a significant inhibition (26 and 78%, respectively) of gastric emptying of a nonnutrient liquid (0.9% saline). Functional ablation of the capsaicin-sensitive vagal, but not the spinal, sensory innervation to the upper gastrointestinal tract significantly attenuated by 57% lipid-induced inhibition of gastric emptying. In intact rats, administration of a specific cholecystokinin (CCK)-A receptor antagonist, devazepide, significantly attenuated by 66% the response to lipid. Administration of devazepide in perivagal capsaicin-treated rats did not further reduce the response to lipid. These results suggest that lipid in the duodenum inhibits gastric emptying via a mechanism involving an action of CCK at type A receptors and capsaicin-sensitive vagal afferents.", 
    "36": "Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provides cost-effective information on regional cerebral perfusion and, indirectly, on regional cerebral metabolism. Its ease of use facilitates the application of SPECT in clinical neurology. SPECT is emerging as a useful tool for the management of patients with stroke, epilepsy, recurrent brain neoplasms, and some forms of dementia. The applications being investigated, such as in vivo receptor labeling for benzodiazepines, serotonin, dopamine, and muscarinic receptors, may expand the clinical usefulness of this technique in the future.", 
    "37": "The optimal therapeutic approach for the patient with refractory generalized status epilepticus remains to be defined. We describe four patients with refractory generalized status epilepticus who were successfully treated with intravenous midazolam. Each patient had prolonged convulsive status epilepticus unresponsive to standard doses of intravenous benzodiazepines, phenytoin, and phenobarbital. The patients subsequently received midazolam administered as an intravenous bolus (200 micrograms/kg) followed by a continuous infusion (0.75 to 11 micrograms/kg/min) lasting 8 hours to 10 days. Clinical examination and scalp electroencephalographic monitoring documented the cessation of seizure activity within minutes of the loading dose in all patients. No significant adverse effects occurred during midazolam treatment. The one patient with prolonged midazolam infusion required fluid boluses and pressors for moderate hypotension, and the remainder of the patients safely tolerated midazolam despite preexistent hemodynamic instability. All patients recovered and maintained good seizure control. Intravenous midazolam appears to be an effective treatment for refractory generalized status epilepticus, and may represent a substantial improvement over current therapeutic approaches such as pentobarbital anesthesia.", 
    "38": "In infancy, two brothers developed recurrent attacks of alternating or bilateral hemiplegia arising exclusively out of sleep. The episodes were terminated by even brief sleep. Neither child had hypotonia, dystonic attacks, paroxysmal eye movement abnormalities, or other features characteristic of the now-classic form of alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC). The development of the brothers has so far remained normal. Both parents have a history of migraine. In the older boy, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of muscle showed increased inorganic phosphate similar to what is found in children with AHC. In the younger brother and parents, MRS of muscle was normal. Other investigations were unrevealing. Flunarizine greatly reduced the duration of attacks. This genetically determined disorder represents a specific entity that is probably migraine-related and is easily misdiagnosed as AHC. Because of its benign course, particularly as far as mental development is concerned, it must be distinguished from classic AHC, which has a terrible prognosis.", 
    "39": "The diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI; also called acyl coenzyme A-binding protein or endozepine) is a 10-kDa polypeptide found in organisms ranging from yeasts to mammals. It has been shown that DBI and its processing products are involved in various specific biological processes such as GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor modulation, acyl coenzyme A metabolism, steroidogenesis, and insulin secretion. We have cloned and sequenced the Drosophila melanogaster gene and cDNA encoding DBI. The Drosophila DBI gene encodes a protein of 86 amino acids that shows 51 to 56% identity with previously known DBI proteins. The gene is composed of one noncoding 5' and two coding exons and is localized on the chromosomal map at position 65E. Several transcription initiation sites were detected by RNase protection and primer extension experiments. Computer analysis of the promoter region revealed features typical of housekeeping genes, such as the lack of TATA and CCAAT elements. However, in its low GC content and lack of a CpG island, the region resembles promoters of tissue-specific genes. Northern (RNA) analysis revealed that the expression of the DBI gene occurred from the larval stage onwards throughout the adult stage. In adult flies, DBI mRNA and immunoreactivity were detected in the cardia, part of the Malpighian tubules, the fat body, and gametes of both sexes. Developmentally regulated expression, disappearing during metamorphosis, was detected in the larval and pupal brains. No expression was detected in the adult nervous system. On the basis of the expression of DBI in some but not all tissues with high energy consumption, we propose that in D. melanogaster, DBI is involved in energy metabolism in a manner that depends on the substrate used for energy production.", 
    "40": "Three novel antisera to the gamma 2 subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor/benzodiazepine receptor (GABAAR/BZDR) complex have been made. Anti-gamma 2S and anti-gamma 2L are specific antibodies to synthetic peptides that recognize the gamma 2S (short) and gamma 2L (long) forms, respectively, of the gamma 2 subunit. An antibody (anti-gamma 2IL2) to staphylococcal protein A fusion protein of the large intracellular loop (gamma 2IL) located between the putative transmembrane segments M3 and M4 of gamma 2S recognizes both gamma 2S and gamma 2L subunits. The antibodies immunoprecipitated both the solubilized and affinity-purified GABAAR/BZDR from rat and bovine brain. Immunoblots with membranes from rat brain cerebral cortex as well as with affinity-purified receptor from bovine cortex show that anti-gamma 2S and anti-gamma 2L recognize peptides of 45,000 and 47,000 M(r), respectively. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that gamma 2S is more prevalent in hippocampus, whereas gamma 2L is more abundant in cerebellum. Intermediate values for each form are found in the cerebral cortex. The results suggest that in the rat brain there is a considerable amount of colocalization of gamma 2S and gamma 2L in the same receptor complex. In the cerebral cortex, 15% of the BZDRs contain both gamma 2S and gamma 2L subunits and 41-48% of the gamma 2L subunit coexists with gamma 2S in the same receptor complex. In cerebellum, in 27% of the clonazepam-sensitive and 39% of the clonazepam-insensitive BZDRs the gamma 2S and gamma 2L coexist in the same receptor complex. The latter are presumably localized in granule cells and also contain alpha 6. In addition, almost all (93%) the clonazepam-insensitive BZDRs that contain gamma 2L also contain a gamma 2S subunit in the same receptor complex. The most likely interpretation of the results is that there is an important population of granule cell receptors that contain alpha 6, gamma 2S, and gamma 2L coexisting in the same receptor complex. Nevertheless, 31% of the cerebellar receptors that contain alpha 6 subunit(s) have neither gamma 2S nor gamma 2L subunits. There are also species differences with respect to the relative abundance of gamma 2S and gamma 2L. These results might be relevant for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying some of the GABAAR/BZDR-mediated effects of ethanol intoxication involving cerebellar granule cells.", 
    "41": "We previously demonstrated that the mitochondrial peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is coupled to hormone-activated steroidogenesis by regulating the intramitochondrial cholesterol transport, the rate-determining step of steroid biosynthesis. In the present study we examined whether PBR is the site of hormone action using the hCG-responsive MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cell line as a model system. Within 15 sec of the addition of hCG to Leydig cells a 3-fold cAMP-dependent increase in PBR binding was observed. This rapid increase returned to basal levels within 60 sec. No effect was observed after 1 min in the continued presence of hCG. Scatchard analysis revealed that in addition to the known high affinity (5.0 nM) benzodiazepine-binding site, a second, hormone-induced, higher affinity (0.2 nM) benzodiazepine-binding site appeared. We then examined whether in such a short time frame steroid synthesis occurs. Fifteen-second incubation of MA-10 cells with the inhibitor of cholesterol metabolism aminoglutethimide together with hCG also resulted in an increased rate of pregnenolone formation by their isolated mitochondria that were washed and incubated in aminoglutethimide-free buffer. The dose response of benzodiazepine binding to hCG closely parallels the increase in steroid formation by the mitochondria of stimulated cells. Addition of the selective inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, H-89, completely blocked hormone-induced PBR binding and steroid formation, whereas addition of the inactive analog H-85 was without any effect. The addition of flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine previously shown to inhibit the trophic hormone action on steroidogenesis, completely abolished the hCG-induced rapid stimulation of steroid synthesis. These results demonstrate that in MA-10 cells, the most rapid effect described thus far of hCG and cAMP, is the transient induction of a higher affinity benzodiazepine-binding site, which occurs concomitantly with an increase in the rate of steroid formation. This, in turn, suggests that these hormones alter PBR to activate cholesterol delivery to the inner mitochondrial membrane and subsequent steroid formation.", 
    "42": "A method for the separation and determination of benzodiazepines by micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) has been developed. Separation buffers consisted of aqueous solutions of glycine and triethanolamine (pH 9.0), containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as surfactant and methanol as organic modifier. The effect of the concentration of SDS, methanol, glycine and triethanolamine on migration times and resolution was studied. Ten benzodiazepines were baseline separated at a 25 mM SDS concentration and 20% v/v methanol in a 75 mM glycine-250 mM triethanolamine buffer. Under these conditions, the within-day reproducibilities were 0.3-0.5% for migration times and 1.7-1.9% for peak areas at a concentration of 10 micrograms/mL. The limits of detection and quantification for oxazepam were 0.2 and 0.7 micrograms/mL, respectively, using an injection time of 5 s.",

After withdrawal of the drug and subsequent central retinal laser therapy her visual acuity stabilized at 0.7 (follow-up time 6 years). With no similar reports in literature, it is suggested that the association between amiodarone therapy and the central retinopathy was accidental only.", 
    "44": "The comparative toxicokinetics of oxazepam were studied in F344 rats, B6C3F1 mice, and Swiss-Webster mice of both sexes after an i.v. dose of 20 mg/kg and oral gavage doses of 50, 200, and 400 mg/kg. In addition, the toxicokinetics of oxazepam in a 3-week dosed-feed study of male B6C3F1 mice at 125 and 2500 ppm were also investigated. Results indicated that the elimination of oxazepam from plasma after i.v. injection in both rats and mice were first-order and could be best described by a two-compartment model with a terminal elimination half-life of 4-5 h for rats and 5-7 h for mice. After oral gavage dosing the peak oxazepam plasma concentrations in most rodents were reached within 2-3.5 h. At all doses studied, female rodents had significantly higher plasma concentrations than males. Absorption of oxazepam was significantly extended at higher oral doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg. At 50 mg/kg, the bioavailability of oxazepam in rats (< 50%) was lower than in Swiss-Webster mice (> 80%). The bioavailability of oxazepam in both B6C3F1 and Swiss-Webster mice decreased with increasing dose. A dose proportionality of Cmax was not observed in rats and mice after gavage doses of 50, 200, and 400 mg/kg. Plasma concentrations of oxazepam in the dosed-feed study increased with the concentration of oxazepam in the feed, a quasi-steady-state of plasma concentrations of oxazepam was reached after approximately 4 days ad libitum exposure. In B6C3F1 mice, the estimated relative bioavailability of oxazepam from dosed feed (relative to gavage study at 50 mg/kg) was about 43%.", 
    "45": "In the course of our study concerning gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors, we have synthesized and characterized a new labeled gastrin ligand, 125I-BH-[Leu15]-gastrin-(5-17) [(3-[125I]iodo-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionyl-[Leu15]-gastrin-(5-17)]. Binding of 125I-BH-[Leu15]-gastrin-(5-17) to isolated canine fundic mucosal cells was specific, saturable and of high affinity. 125I-BH-[Leu15]-gastrin- (5-17) and 125I-BH-CCK-8[(3-[125I]iodo-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionyl-CCK-8] interact with isolated canine fundic mucosal cells with small differences in maximal binding capacities and affinities, 3800 +/- 900 binding sites/cell (Kd = 0.52 +/- 0.23 nM) and 6200 +/- 1100 binding sites/cell (Kd = 0.31 +/- 0.18 nM), respectively. The relative order of potencies for gastrin and CCK analogs in displacing 125I-BH-[Leu15]-gastrin-(5-17) binding correlated well with those obtained using 125I-BH-CCK-8. Selective CCK/gastrin antagonists L-364,718 (MK-329) and L-365,260 also inhibited 125I-BH-[Leu15]-gastrin-(5-17) binding. These results indicate that 125I-BH-[Leu15]-gastrin-(5-17) binds to gastrin receptors in isolated canine fundic mucosal cells. We have also characterized 125I-BH-[Leu15]-gastrin-(5-17) binding to the human Jurkat lymphoblastic cell line (Jurkat cells) known to express the CCK-B/gastrin receptor. Saturation experiments have shown that both 125I-BH-[Leu15]-gastrin-(5-17) and 125I-BH-CCK-8 interact with a single class of high-affinity binding sites in the Jurkat cell line.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "47": "This study examined both the function of the GABAA receptor complex and the expression of its alpha 1, alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunits within the hypothalamus as compared to that of the cerebral cortex. A large number of different GABAA receptor subunit combinations potentially exist in various brain regions which, presumably, would intimate differing receptor structure and function. Here, we present evidence that the average functional characteristics of GABAA receptors within the rat hypothalamus are considerably different from those of the cerebral cortex. We assessed two neurochemical measures of GABAA receptor function: namely, chloride-facilitation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding and GABA-mediated 36chloride uptake. [3H]Flunitrazepam binding in the rat cortex was facilitated by increasing concentrations (12.5-500 mM) of chloride, and this facilitation was responsive to 15 min restraint. Yet, hypothalamic [3H]flunitrazepam binding was not responsive to increasing chloride-concentration in either the basal or restraint conditions. Also, maximal facilitation of GABA-mediated 36chloride uptake was significantly blunted in the hypothalamus relative to cortex (7.4 +/- 0.9 versus 35.8 +/- 1.5 nmoles/mg protein, respectively). While in vitro addition of 10 microM diazepam shifted GABA-mediated 36chloride uptake curves of the cortex to the left, diazepam addition appeared to be without effect in the hypothalamus. However, the blunted maximal facilitation of GABA on hypothalamic 36chloride uptake made accurate determination of the EC50 for the diazepam-potentiation difficult. In addition to these functional disparities between the regions, differences in subunit expression were also apparent. Distributions of alpha 1, alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunit immunoreactivities within cingulate, parietal and temporal cortices and 8 major hypothalamic regions were assessed. Staining of the alpha 1 subunit was prevalent throughout the hypothalamus and cortex, and dense in both regions. However, the alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunits, while of intermediate density in cortex, were of low density or absent (alpha 3) in the hypothalamus. The alpha 2-immunoreactivity was restricted to cell bodies of the arcuate nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus and overlying dorsal area and to neuropil staining of the median eminence. Thus, functional responsiveness of the GABAA receptor differs in the hypothalamus relative to the cortex and this would seem related to the presence of different receptor alpha subunits in homogenate preparations of the two regions.",

    "49": "Synthesized Mn-TPPS, a paramagnetic metalloporphyrin, is expected to be a tumour specific contrast media for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. We investigated the enhancing characteristics of Mn-TPPS using a transplanted rat C6 glioma model with peripheral type benzodiazepine (PBD) receptors since porphyrins are thought to possibly be endogenous ligands for PBD receptors. An Mn-TPPS enhancement study was then performed either with or without pretreatment while using peripheral and central type benzodiazepine receptor specific ligands (PK11195 and clonazepam, respectively). A signal intensity analysis disclosed the selective and prolonged enhancement of the brain tumour even at 17 h after the Mn-TPPS injection. This specific enhancement of the tumour, however, was not inhibited nor replaced by benzodiazepines. The tissue concentration of Mn-TPPS was significantly higher in the glioma tissue than the other tissues, while PK11195 pretreatment could not reduce the intratumoural Mn-TPPS concentration. A subcellular distribution study disclosed that Mn-TPPS was readily incorporated into the tumour cells. On the other hand, Mn-TPPS was not specifically distributed in the mitochondrial fraction where PBD receptors exist. The present study therefore indicates that Mn-TPPS could be incorporated into tumour cells and supports the potential use of this agent to improve the diagnostic specificity of MR imaging for brain tumours.", 
    "50": "Sedative effects of combinations of medetomidine at 20 micrograms/kg--midazolam at 0.3 mg/kg (Me-Mi) and medetomidine at 20 micrograms/kg--butorphanol at 0.1 mg/kg (Me-B) were evaluated comparing with those of medetomidine alone (20, 40 and 80 mu/kg). All dogs given Me-Mi or Me-B were smoothly and rapidly induced to more profound and longer sedation than those by medetomidine alone. Especially, Me-Mi produced desirable sedation with moderate reflex depression, analgesia, excellent muscle relaxation and immobilization without further side effects. This potent effect of this combination seemed to be induced by a synergistic interaction between medetomidine and midazolam. This combination is available and valuable as a chemical restraint agent in dogs for various diagnostic or therapeutic procedures accompanied by light pain.",

Atipamezole also effectively reversed changes in heart rate, respiratory rate and body temperature produced by medetomidine-midazolam. The possible use of atipamezole as a reversal agent might enhance the value and availability of medetomidine-midazolam for a chemical restraint agent in dogs.", 
    "52": "To provide initial information on the potential mechanisms underlying the discriminative stimulus effects of melatonin, rats were trained to discriminate melatonin (150 mg/kg, IP) from saline in a two-choice discrete-trial avoidance paradigm. Stimulus generalization curves for melatonin were steep; complete generalization with melatonin occurred at 100-150 mg/kg. Triazolam generalized completely with melatonin (n = 7). Flurazepam generalized completely with melatonin in only two out of six rats; however, partial generalization was produced in the remaining four animals. The melatonin-appropriate responding produced by triazolam was antagonized completely (in six out of seven rats) by 0.3-10 mg/kg flumazenil (Ro 15-1788). In contrast, the dose of flumazenil sufficient to block completely the melatonin-like discriminative effects of triazolam failed to block the stimulus effects of the training dose of melatonin. Pentobarbital produced primarily melatonin-appropriate responding, with complete generalization with melatonin in five out of seven rats. Diphenhydramine generalized completely with melatonin in two out of seven rats; however, little or no partial generalization was observed in the remaining five rats. These results suggest that melatonin may produce its discriminative effects through sites on the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex distinct from the benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "53": "The sedative, amnestic, and performance disruptive effects of benzodiazepine (Bz) receptor selective and non-selective hypnotics were studied in 23 healthy, normal subjects, aged 26.8 +/- 1.0 years. Triazolam (0.25 and 0.50 mg), zolpidem (10 and 20 mg) and placebo were administered, double-blind, at bedtime in a repeated measures design. During an awakening 90 min later (at approximate peak concentration of each drug) a 30-min performance battery which included memory, vigilance, and psychomotor tasks was completed. Each drug and dose impaired memory (both immediate and delayed), vigilance, and psychomotor performance relative to placebo. Among active drugs impairment was greatest with zolpidem 20 mg, next triazolam 0.50 mg, then zolpidem 10 mg, and finally triazolam 0.25 mg. Next morning delayed recall was also impaired by all drugs and doses (i.e. anterograde amnesia). The amnestic and performance-disruptive effects paralleled the relative hypnotic effects of the drugs and doses. No receptor selectivity in these pharmacodynamic effects was observed.", 
    "54": "Droperidol can reduce the high incidence of vomiting after pediatric strabismus surgery; however, its use may be associated with sedation, delayed hospital discharge, dysphoria and extrapyramidal signs. Midazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine with antiemetic properties, has few side effects and may be a suitable alternative. We prospectively compared the antiemetic effect of these two drugs in 393 healthy children aged 18 months to 14 years undergoing outpatient strabismus surgery. The children were randomly assigned to receive midazolam hydrochloride (50 micrograms/kg) (199 patients) or droperidol (50 micrograms/kg) (194 children). The incidence rates of vomiting in the two groups were 45% and 37% respectively, a nonsignificant difference. The incidence of vomiting was not affected by the duration of anesthesia, but the number of muscles repaired was a significant predictor of postoperative vomiting (p < 0.001).", 
    "55": "Tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of carbamazepine (CBZ) in the amygdala kindling paradigm is a contingent process, since it only develops in rats treated with CBZ before the kindling stimulation and not in those animals treated after the stimulation. The present study was designed to investigate the GABAA receptor system in CBZ contingent tolerance. Receptor autoradiography utilizing various radioligands that bind to different components of the GABAA receptor system and in situ hybridization with oligonucleotides that recognize different subunits of the GABAA receptor were performed. Kindling increased binding to benzodiazepine, picrotoxin, and GABA recognition sites selectively in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Kindling also increased levels of mRNA for the alpha 4, beta 1, and beta 3 subunits but did not change alpha 1, alpha 2, or gamma 2 subunit levels. Rats tolerant to CBZ showed decreased [3H]muscimol binding, diazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding, and decreased alpha 4 subunit mRNA content compared to non-tolerant rats, whereas [3H]flunitrazepam binding, [35S]TBPS binding, and the levels of beta 1, and beta 3 subunit mRNAs remained elevated. The data suggest an indirect interaction of CBZ with the GABAA receptor system, since CBZ reportedly does not bind to this receptor system.", 
    "56": "Chick embryos with an undeveloped blood-brain barrier were used to examine the down-regulation of GABAA receptors in vivo. The GABAA receptor agonist isoguvacine (5 mumol) was applied to the vascularized chorioallantoic membrane of 8 day embryos. This treatment was repeated on embryonic days 11, 14, and 17, and the embryos were sacrificed on day 18 (stage 42). Isoguvacine administration reduced the clonazepam-displaceable binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to washed cerebellar membranes by 34.0 +/- 3.0% compared to vehicle-treated controls. Binding reductions of lower magnitude were found in membranes from the cerebrum and optic lobes. Administration of isoguvacine had no significant effect on the wet weights of whole embryos or cerebella, the yield of cerebellar membranes, or the binding of [3H]N-methylscopolamine. The reduction of [3H]flunitrazepam binding to cerebellar membranes was dose-dependent, allowing a half saturation value of 8 microM isoguvacine to be estimated. Scatchard analysis showed that the Bmax for [3H]flunitrazepam binding was reduced by 28.3 +/- 6.7% compared to controls, without a change in the Kd. Embryonic exposure to isoguvacine also caused a reduction of 43.6 +/- 6.0% in the binding of the GABAA receptor channel ligand [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate to washed cerebellar membranes. Taken together, these results indicate that isoguvacine induces a down-regulation of the receptor subunits in vivo. However, measurements of cerebellar GABAA receptor mRNAs for the alpha 1, beta 2L, beta 2S, beta 4, gamma 1, gamma 2L, and gamma 2S subunits by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed no significant alterations by isoguvacine administration. The data suggest that translational or post-translational mechanisms, rather than those modulating the synthesis or stability of subunit mRNAs, take precedence in establishing GABAA receptor down-regulation.", 
    "57": "Using an earthworm (Eisenia foetida) dorsal muscle preparation, it was shown that tetrahydroberberine (THB, 10(-7)-10(-4) mol/L) did not affect both GABA and ACh receptors. DA receptor antagonist haloperidol (HAL) also exerted no effect. Owing to the blocking action of isonicotinyl hydrazine (INH) and thiosemicarbazide (TSC) on biosynthesis of GABA, and of picrotoxin (PT) and bicuculline (Bic) on the GABA-BZ receptor complex mediated transmission, all these agents could induce convulsion in mice. This action could be antagonized by amino- oxyacetic acid (AOAA) and benzodiazepine (BZ), but not by DA receptor antagonists THB and HAL. All the above observations indicate that the GABA inhibition is not involved in the central action of THB.",

    "59": "An inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonist Ro 19-4603, administered intraperitoneally, was found to induce two types of motor seizures, i.e. minimal, predominantly clonic and major, generalized tonic-clonic, in rats at all developmental stages studied (7, 12, 18 and 25 days old). The developmental profile of the two types of seizure was different. Minimal seizures could be induced easily in the two youngest groups, whereas there were no marked differences in the induction of major seizures between the age groups. A lethal outcome was more common in 18- and 25-day-old rats than in younger animals. The convulsant action of the benzodiazepine agonist/inverse agonist Ro 19-4603 shows only quantitative changes during post-natal development in the rat.", 
    "60": "The present study was designed to investigate age-dependent changes of muscarcinic M1 and M2 cholinergic receptors in the rat hippocampus using radioreceptor assay and autoradiographic techniques with [3H]pirenzepine and [3H]AF-DX 116 as ligands. The analysis was performed on 2-, 12- and 27-month-old male Wistar rats, considered young, adult and old, respectively. Moreover, the influence of a 6-month treatment with choline alphoscerate on the density and pattern of M1 and M2 cholinergic receptors was assessed. Choline alphoscerate (L-alpha-glyceryl phosphorylcholine) is a precursor in the biosynthesis of several brain phospholipids which increases the availability of acetylcholine in various tissues. Muscarinic M1 cholinergic receptors were significantly decreased with increasing age whereas M2 cholinergic receptors did not show changes. Choline alphoscerate treatment countered, in part, the loss of muscarinic M1 receptor sites in old rats. Light microscope autoradiography revealed a loss of silver grains developed after exposure of sections of hippocampus to [3H]pirenzepine in the stratum oriens of CA1 and CA3 fields in rats of 12 and 27 months in comparison with young animals. Choline alphoscerate restored, in part, the decrease of silver grains noted in old rats. Quantitative analysis of the density of silver grains developed in the cell body of pyramidal neurons of CA1 and CA3 fields processed for the demonstration of muscarinic M1 receptor sites revealed a decrease of these grains in rats of 27 months in comparison with younger cohorts. These findings suggest that the reduction in muscarinic M1 sites noticeable between 2- and 12-month rats is probably dependent on the loss of nerve cells and/or terminals in these hippocampal fields rather than to a reduction of their density per neuron. Treatment with choline alphoscerate increased the expression of muscarinic M1 cholinergic receptors within the cell body of pyramidal neurons of CA1 and CA3 fields compared to age-matched control old rats. Consistent with radioreceptor assay data, no changes in the density of muscarinic M2 cholinergic receptors in the animal groups examined were demonstrated by light microscope autoradiography. The possible pharmacological relevance of the increased expression of muscarinic M1 cholinergic receptors elicited by choline alphoscerate in the hippocampus of aged rats is discussed.", 
    "61": "Detomidine, a potent alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, was chosen for study alone and in combination with ketamine with or without diazepam. Four regimens were evaluated: detomidine (150 micrograms/kg of body weight) alone (D); ketamine (35 mg/kg) and detomidine (150 micrograms/kg) (KD); ketamine (35 mg/kg) and high-dose detomidine (300 micrograms/kg) (KDh); and ketamine (35 mg/kg), diazepam (1 mg/kg), and detomidine (150 micrograms/kg) (KDD). The same six rabbits were anesthetized with each combination at weekly intervals. Atropine (0.04 mg/kg) was administered as a preanesthetic 5 min prior to test substance administration. All agents were administered IM, except for diazepam, which was administered IV. Heart and respiratory rates, mean arterial blood pressure, and arterial blood gas tensions were measured. Pedal, palpebral, and righting reflexes also were evaluated. Cardiopulmonary depression, as indicated by decrease in heart and respiratory rates, blood pH, PO2, and increase in PCO2, was observed in all groups. With the exception of heart rate, detomidine used alone caused the least depression of these parameters. Reflexes were consistently lost only after KDh and KDD administrations. The pedal reflex, used as an index of anesthetic depth, was lost in response to KDh and KDD for 56.7 +/- 11.6 and 43.8 +/- 7.4 min, respectively (mean +/- SEM). Three of the six rabbits were anorectic after KDh administration. Necropsy and histologic evaluation revealed myocardial necrosis and fibrosis in five animals. Due to the inconsistent reflex loss in response to KD and D and inappetance associated with KDh, these combinations were not considered safe or reliable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "62": "Diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) is the precursor of a family of peptides, including an octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), that share with DBI the ability to specifically displace benzodiazepines (BZD) from their receptors. An association of ODN with the peripheral type BZD receptors (PBR) has been reported in the brain and a few peripheral tissues. In order to investigate whether DBI and PBR are present in ovarian tissue, we have localized DBI by means of immunocytochemistry, in situ hybridization and autoradiography of PBR in the rat ovary. Immunocytochemical localization was achieved by means of rabbit antibodies developed against rat ODN. Immunostaining was located in the cytoplasm of the theca interna, corpus luteum and interstitial gland cells, but not in the granulosa cells. Hybridization signal obtained following in situ hybridization with a [35S]-labelled single-stranded RNA probe complementary to DBI mRNA was observed in all the steroid-secreting cells, including granulosa cells of developing and mature follicles. Autoradiographic localization of PBR obtained by incubating ovary sections with [3H] PK11195, a ligand selective for PBR, revealed the presence of specific labelling in all the steroid-secreting cells. These results, which demonstrate for the first time that the ovarian steroid-secreting cells contain both PBR and its endogenous ligand, suggest that the BZD receptor might be involved in the regulation of ovarian function.", 
    "63": "Midazolam has been demonstrated to preserve the response of cerebral blood flow to CO2. However, the responsiveness of cerebral vessels or microcirculation during midazolam administration related to alteration of cerebral blood flow has not been explored. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of midazolam on cerebral microcirculation. Nine cats were paralyzed and mechanically ventilated under nitrous oxide/oxygen anaesthesia. Using the closed cranial window technique and laser Doppler flowmetry, diameter of pial vessels and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were examined on the surface of the cerebral cortex which was perfused by the middle cerebral artery. Before midazolam administration, haemodynamic variables, blood gases, rCBF, and diameter of pial vessels were determined as a control under normocapnia, hypocapnia, and hypercapnia conditions. After midazolam administration, given initially at 0.8 mg.kg-1.min-1 for 10 min and subsequently at 0.04 mg.kg-1.min-1 (total dose 10 mg.kg-1), the same variables were again analyzed. With regard to CO2 responsiveness, an 8.85% increase in rCBF was demonstrated for a Paco2 elevation of 1 kPa before midazolam administration, compared with a 7.47% increase after midazolam administration. With regard to the correlation between CO2 response and vessel diameter, arterioles less than 50 microns in diameter were more sensitive than those more than 50 microns in diameter, although there were no significant differences before or after midazolam administration. We conclude that CO2 responsiveness is preserved in terms of rCBF and vessel diameter after high doses of midazolam (10 mg.kg-1) in cats.", 
    "64": "Changes in the EEG power spectrum were studied in 50 patients (ASA status I or II), receiving either 2 mg.kg-1 of racemic ketamine or 1 mg.kg-1 of S-(+) ketamine in a randomized and double-blind manner after prior administration of 0.1 mg.kg-1 of midazolam. The patients receiving intramuscular premedication with midazolam about 45 minutes prior to induction of anaesthesia showed, in a deliberately quiet environment and mostly in the early morning, a delta dominated EEG (56% delta power) with a reduced alpha peak (17% alpha power) and an average median of 4 Hz as the baseline findings of the EEG power spectrum. The intravenous administration of midazolam led to activation of the lower beta range (13-18 Hz) and the subsequent injection of ketamine caused an increase in activity in the fast beta range (21-30 Hz), both being accompanied by a reduction of delta power from 56% to 40%. Correspondingly, an increase in the median frequency was noted. Causing nearly the same changes in EEG, S-(+) ketamine was confirmed to be twice as potent as racemic ketamine.", 
    "65": "Flumazenil is an imidazobenzodiazepine, an antagonist of central benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors. BDZ binding sites are a modulatory component located on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor macromolecule. We studied the effect of monocular enucleation on [3H]flumazenil binding in deprived and intact visual areas and nonvisual areas of the adult mouse brain under in vivo conditions. [3H]flumazenil binding was examined at seven time points up to 56 days postenucleation. In some monocularly deprived mice, changes in local blood flow accompanied with the BDZ receptor response were evaluated by coinjection of [3H]flumazenil and 99mTc-HMPAO. Monocular enucleation produced a transient increase in [3H]flumazenil binding in the deprived visual cortex and superior colliculus. At 17 days postenucleation, [3H]flumazenil binding in the anterior and posterior portions of the visual cortex and the superior colliculus increased by 28%, 15% and 23%, respectively, and declined to control levels at 45 days postenucleation. The increase in [3H]flumazenil was accompanied with a decrease in blood flow. Alterations in BDZ receptors and blood flow were selective to deprived visual structures. The regional correlation between the metabolic deficit and the BDZ response provides further support that the increase in BDZ receptor binding is confined to regions of reduced neuronal activity. [11C]flumazenil is an excellent radiotracer for in vivo imaging of benzodiazepine receptors in human brain using positron emission tomography (PET). This study suggests the suitability of [11C]flumazenil for in vivo PET study of BDZ receptor response to deafferentation of visual structures in human brain.", 
    "66": "The effects of fasting and feeding of a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet on the glucuronidation and enterohepatic circulation (EHC) of lorazepam were examined in seven healthy men (age 18-30 years) and seven matched patients with Gilbert's syndrome. A simultaneous intravenous/oral dosing regimen was used, with half of each group receiving treatment with neomycin and cholestyramine (neo/chol) to block the EHC of the drug. Feeding increased the clearance of free lorazepam from 10.96 +/- 0.56 (mean +/- SD) to 14.11 +/- 1.21 mL/min/kg (P = 0.05) in patients with Gilbert's syndrome when examined in the presence of neo/chol. Clearances, on the other hand, decreased with feeding in control Gilbert's patients (7.61 +/- 0.54 versus 8.82 +/- 0.48 mL/min/kg), although the differences were not significant (P = 0.09). In contrast to both of these groups, feeding decreased lorazepam clearances (13.33 +/- 0.32 to 12.45 +/- 0.52 mL/min/kg, P = 0.17) in neo/chol-treated normals and increased clearances (9.95 +/- 1.84 to 12.38 +/- 2.05 mL/min/kg, P = 0.04) in control normals. Lorazepam clearances were also 20-40% lower in patients with Gilbert's syndrome compared with normals when studied fasting and with neo/chol, or fed and in the control state (P < 0.05 for both). Thus, the glucuronidation and EHC of lorazepam is sensitive both to diet and to the presence or absence of the Gilbert's trait.", 
    "67": "This study examined the relationship between drug preferences as measured in a laboratory-based choice procedure and measures of personality and attitudes toward drugs. Healthy volunteers participated in laboratory-based double-blind studies measuring preference for ethanol or diazepam vs placebo. Frequency of drug choice was examined in relation to subjects' scores on personality questionnaires. Drug choice was not related to any of the personality measures examined. Personality scores were, however, related to both gender and habitual drug use. These data suggest that personality does not strongly influence responses to single doses of drugs as assessed under controlled conditions. Personality may, nevertheless, affect drug use in natural settings via other mechanisms (e.g., interacting with psychosocial variables).", 
    "68": "The postpartum period is a time of great physical and emotional changes. The incidence of psychiatric illness is higher in this period than at any other time in a women's life. Therefore, the question of whether women receiving psychotropic drugs should continue breast feeding is an important one. Drug excretion in breast milk depends mostly on passive diffusion of the unionised unbound drug. Passive diffusion is affected mainly by the drug disposition in lactating mothers, by the physicochemical properties of the molecule and by the protein and lipid contents of breast milk. Indeed, breast milk can be considered as a compartment with bidirectional transfer rather than a reservoir into which drug accumulates. Benzodiazepines are the most prescribed psychotropic drugs. Generally there does not seem to be any contraindication to breast feeding after a single dose, provided the dose administered is relatively low. If higher doses are to be used or long term administration is required, then breast feeding should probably be discontinued, particularly with drugs with a long elimination half-life. On the basis of the average concentration of phenobarbital (phenobarbitone) in milk, breast feeding is not recommended. For glutethimide, breast feeding would appear to be safe for the infant when a single dose is taken occasionally. Zopiclone may also be prescribed on a short term basis to breast feeding mothers. Due to limited available data or to the large amount transferred to milk, administration of phenothiazines and nonphenothiazine tricyclic, butyrophenone, and benzamide antipsychotics to breast feeding mothers cannot be recommended. Breast feeding is not always considered an absolute contraindication to lithium therapy, but the mother should watch for signs of toxicity in her baby. Whether clomipramine should be contraindicated during breast feeding depends on the concentration of active metabolites in breast milk, and this has not yet been determined. It is probably safe for mothers to breast feed while receiving amitriptyline, but before more conclusive recommendations are made more infants should be studied. The available data suggest that the amount of doxepin and its metabolite in breast milk is small. However, the metabolite of doxepin may accumulate in the infant with risk of sedation and respiratory depression: therefore, an alternative antidepressant should be selected for breast feeding mothers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "69": "Ten patients with head trauma received an intravenous bolus of sufentanil (2 micrograms kg-1) followed at 30 min by infusion of sufentanil (median 150 micrograms h-1) and midazolam (median 9.0 mg h-1) over 48 h. Median (range) values of pharmacokinetic parameters for sufentanil were: t1/2,z = 16 (7-49) h; CL = 1215 (519-2550) ml min-1; CLR = 7 (2-38) ml min-1; Vss = 10.0 (6.8-24.2) 1 kg-1. Decreases in intracranial pressure (ICP) (from 16.1 +/- 1.7 to 10.8 +/- 1.3 mm Hg; P < 0.05) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) (from 85.5 +/- 3.9 to 80.2 +/- 4.9 mm Hg; P < 0.05) were observed within 15 min of the bolus injection of sufentanil and remained unchanged thereafter. Thus, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP = MAP-ICP) was stable.", 
    "70": "1. The effect of erythromycin on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral zopiclone, a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic, was investigated in a double-blind, cross-over study. 2. Ten healthy volunteers were given placebo or 500 mg erythromycin orally three times a day for 6 days followed by an oral dose of 7.5 mg zopiclone. 3. Erythromycin increased plasma zopiclone concentration by 4-fold at 0.5 h (P < 0.05) and by 2-fold at 1 h (P < 0.05). There were increases of 3- and 2-fold in the AUC(0,1 h) and AUC(0,2 h) values (P < 0.05). The total AUC of zopiclone increased by 80% (P < 0.05) but the peak concentration by only 40% (P < 0.05). The peak time of zopiclone concentration was reduced from 2 to 1 h (P < 0.001). 4. Significant pharmacodynamic differences between the treatments were observed from 0.5 h to 2 h with respect to saccadic latency and digit symbol substitution tests. 5. The interaction between erythromycin and zopiclone resulted mainly in accelerated absorption which may lead to a faster hypnotic effect in patients.", 
    "71": "1. This four-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study compared the efficacy and safety of adinazolam-SR, at three dosage levels, with placebo. Forty (40) patients were randomized at our site: 10 to adinazolam 30 mg/day, 10 to 60 mg/day, 10 to 90 mg/day, and 10 to placebo. All patients were moderately anxious with Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) scores of > or = 21 at baseline. 2. The data were analyzed by pooling the three adinazolam groups and comparing them with the placebo group using t-tests. HAM-A scores decreased significantly more in the pooled adinazolam-SR treatment group than in the placebo group at both Week one (p < .02) and at Week two (p < .01), as well as at endpoint (p < .03). 3. At endpoint the adinazolam-treated group included 8 \"responders\" (> or = 50% reduction on the baseline HAM-A score) while none of the placebo patients were responders (p < .05). Dose-response effects were evaluated and relationships were not statistically significant. 4. The results indicate that adinazolam-SR was clearly superior to placebo for the treatment of patients suffering from Generalized Anxiety Disorder.", 
    "72": "In order to investigate the effects of early protein malnutrition and environmental stimulation upon the response to the anxiolytic properties of diazepam, two animal models of anxiety (elevated plus-maze and light-dark transition tests) were used. Rats were malnourished by feeding their dams a 6% protein diet during the lactation period (0-21 days of age) while well-nourished controls received a 16% protein diet. From 21 to 70 days of age all rats received a balanced lab chow diet. Environmental stimulation consisted of 3-min daily handling from birth to 70 days of age. Additional stimulation was provided from 21 to 70 days of age by rearing the rats in an enriched living cage. Eight groups of rats were studied in a 2 (malnourished or well-nourished) x 2 (stimulated or nonstimulated) x 2 (diazepam or vehicle) design. At 70 days of age, independent groups of rats treated with diazepam (2.5 mg/kg, IP) or vehicle were submitted to testing in the elevated plus-maze or light-dark transition procedures. The results showed that both diazepam and environmental stimulation reduced anxiety in the elevated plus-maze; stimulation changed the anxiolytic response to diazepam and the two diet conditions altered differentially the response to both pharmacological and stimulation procedures. These results suggest that environmental stimulation can affect differentially the behavioral response of malnourished and well-nourished rats treated with diazepam.", 
    "73": "The release of [3H]-5-HT and [14C]-GABA from hippocampal and amygdaloid slices was studied in a group of rats in which an anxiogenic response had been found on withdrawal of chronic diazepam treatment (2 mg/kg/day for 21 days). Basal release and uptake of [3H]-5-HT and [14C]-GABA and K(+)-evoked release of [14C]-GABA were not significantly changed in either brain region following diazepam withdrawal. However, there was a significant increase in K(+)-evoked [3H]-5-HT release from the amygdala, but not from the hippocampal, slices. These results demonstrate that increased 5-HT release from the hippocampus is not necessary to mediate the anxiogenic withdrawal response, and that raised 5-HT release in the amygdala may be sufficient to mediate this response. The results are discussed with respect to conditions, such as noise during diazepam treatment, that might produce regionally specific changes in 5-HT tone and hence modify the pattern of changes found during diazepam withdrawal.", 
    "74": "The effects of short- and long-term administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine were investigated in a rat social interaction test. A single administration of paroxetine at oral doses of 0.3, 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg had no effect on social interaction between pairs of male rats under bright light (high anxiety) conditions. After 21 days of daily administration, paroxetine given orally at 3 mg/kg significantly (p < 0.01) increased the time spent in social interaction by pairs of rats tested under the same conditions, with no effect on locomotor activity, indicating an anxiolytic-like effect. The magnitude of increase (+97%) was comparable to that seen after a single dose of chlordiazepoxide (4 mg/kg orally). Although there was also an increase in time spent in social interaction after 21 days of repeated oral administration of paroxetine at 0.3, 1, and 10 mg/kg (+44, +56, and +54% increases, respectively), statistical significance was not achieved. These results indicate that in the long term paroxetine has an anxiolytic action, and thus support the clinical evidence for its therapeutic use in the treatment of anxiety disorders in addition to its established role as an antidepressant.", 
    "75": "We have investigated the direct effect of GABA receptor agonists on the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and the membrane potential of rat lactotrophs in primary culture. [Ca2+]i was recorded in single identified lactotrophs by dual emission microspectrofluorimetry using indo-1 as intracellular fluorescent calcium probe. Whole cell and perforated patch-clamp were performed. A short application of GABA (10(-5) M, 10 s) induced a marked transient [Ca2+]i increase in 66% of lactotrophs, which could be readily mimicked by muscimol (10(-5) M). By contrast, neither L-homocarnosine (10(-3) M) nor baclofen (10(-5) M), a GABAB agonist, had any effect on [Ca2+]i. The GABA-induced [Ca2+]i increase was antagonized by picrotoxin (10(-5) M), bicuculline methiodide (10(-5) M) and strychnine (10(-4) M), demonstrating GABAA receptor specificity. Furthermore, clonazepan (1.5 x 10(-4) M) could potentiate the GABA effect on [Ca2+]i. The [Ca2+]i increase disappeared in the absence of Ca2+ in the extracellular medium or in the presence of Ca2+ channel blockers (cadmium, PN 200-110). GABA and muscimol depolarized the membrane potential with a concomitant fall in cell input resistance, thus suggesting, as in other cell types, the opening of receptor-operated chloride channels. When Ca2+ entry was prevented by the use of cadmium (500 x 10(-6) M), GABA still elicited membrane depolarization but did not raise [Ca2+]i. Our results suggest that a short application of GABA leads to Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in single lactotrophs. This Ca2+ influx is due to depolarization of the prolactin cell.", 
    "76": "A new point-of-care urine drugs-of-abuse testing device, the BIOSITE TRIAGE, was evaluated for detection of benzodiazepines (BNZs). TRIAGE utilizes a unique, competitive, visual immunoassay methodology to simultaneously detect seven classes of drugs of abuse. Because of the unique ASCEND Multimmunoassay technology, conflicting results may arise when TRIAGE is compared with conventional immunoassay techniques. Apparent TRIAGE BNZ false-positive results may occur when gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) confirmation utilizes oxazepam as the analyte used to confirm the presence of BNZs. TRIAGE BNZ results were correlated with those of Syva EMIT, (n = 106, overall agreement 85%). Both negative and positive urine samples were tested by GC-MS for the following drugs: oxazepam, nordiazepam, desalkylflurazepam, OH-ethylflurazepam, lorazepam, temazepam, alpha-OH-alprazolam and alpha-OH-triazolam. Urine samples were extracted using the new ANSYS SPEC.3ML.MP3 solid-phase extraction microcolumn. The ANSYS procedure for BNZs was modified to include desalkylflurazepam, OH-ethylflurazepam, lorazepam, temazepam, alpha-OH-alprazolam, and alpha-OH-triazolam. Deuterated oxazepam and alpha-OH-alprazolam were used as internal standards. Limits of quantitation (LOQs) ranged from 25 to 100 ng/mL with a limit of detection of 25 ng/mL for all analytes. Individual analytes demonstrated within-run precision and between-run precision ranging from 0.9 to 4.7% CV and 1.3 to 16.9% CV, respectively. All analytes were linear from their LOQs to 1000 ng/mL.", 
    "77": "The history of psychopharmacology shows the differences existing between various groups of substances, natural, and more recent synthetic ones. At present, benzodiazepine anxiolytic agents are being singled out for their abuse and addiction potential. There has been a return to and widespread use of traditional natural therapies and more modern psychotherapy. Patients are more than every wary of synthetic agents. The production of herbal substances is nowdays organized on an industrial scale. The properties of \"alternative\" herbal agents are illustrated that have been known for centuries and are now studied with the methods of biochemistry. A large number of studies are concerned in several countries with the actions of traditional plants. The WHO encourages this tendency which in some countries has attained official status in schools of medicine, and amounts to a marked reduction in the cost of health. Nevertheless, the past and present importance of the research on synthetic drugs (antibiotics, and even psychoactive substances) cannot be denied. The attention of science in this field is aimed at finding new molecules that are possibly free of addictive properties but are effective in behavioral therapy. A recent example is buspirone. Finally, a psychotherapeutic method is briefly described. In his comment and conclusions the author poses important questions concerning the organization of medical and pharmaceutic studies in the near future.", 
    "78": "A stimulus cue of 1-amino-5-bromouracil (ABU, CAS 127984-93-4) was compared with that of diazepam (DZP) using a drug discrimination paradigm in rats. Groups of rats were trained to discriminate DZP (1 mg/kg i.p.) or ABU (20 mg/kg i.p.) from vehicle. Generalization of the cue of the trained drug to pentobarbital was shown in DZP- and ABU-trained rats at a dose of 5 mg/kg. The stimulus cue of ABU showed a tendency to generalize to DZP in ABU-trained rats but generalization of that of DZP to ABU in DZP-trained rats was only partial. Also partial generalization of that of DZP to imipramine and clonidine was found but not to 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetraline (8-OH-DPAT) in DZP-trained rats. Full generalization of the stimulus cue of ABU to imipramine and partial generalization of that of ABU to clonidine and 8-OH-DPAT was observed in ABU-trained rats. The results suggest that the discriminative stimulus properties of ABU differ from those of DZP.", 
    "79": "We studied 30 children undergoing circumcision randomly allocated to receive either thiopentone 4 mg.kg-1, propofol 2.5 mg.kg-1 or midazolam 0.5 mg.kg-1 (n = 10) IV over 30 seconds at induction of anaesthesia. Blood pressure and pulse rate during the first 15 minutes of induction were recorded by a Finapres 2300e and a Cardiocap CM-104, and changes from preinduction baseline compared between the three induction agents and the two recording instruments. Postoperatively, blood levels of the induction agents were measured and recovery from anaesthesia was assessed by clinical criteria, mood and sedation scores and psychomotor performance. The Cardiocap data revealed no statistically significant haemodynamic differences between the three induction agents. Finapres data demonstrated that propofol caused a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure when compared to thiopentone at one minute (P = 0.01) and the MAP remained significantly lower than midazolam at five minutes (P = 0.02), illustrating an advantage of continuous over intermittent non-invasive blood pressure monitoring. The midazolam group took longer to identify themselves compared to both the propofol (P = 0.005) and the thiopentone groups (P = 0.02), but there was no difference in the groups in time to eye-opening. Psychomotor performance on awakening was significantly worse in the midazolam group compared to the propofol (P < 0.03) and thiopentone groups (P < 0.02). Most children had recovered to 80% of their best, practised, unmedicated, preoperative performance four hours after awakening, irrespective of the induction agent administered. Drug blood levels correlated weakly with both methods of psychomotor assessment (r > or = 0.6). Of the three induction agents, thiopentone caused the least haemodynamic perturbation on induction, and anaesthesia induced with midazolam caused the greatest psychomotor impairment on awakening. Within one hour patients in all drug groups were equally awake, co-operative and co-ordinated.", 
    "80": "We studied 30 children, aged 4 to 12 years, undergoing elective circumcision, premedicated with midazolam 0.5 mg.kg-1 and atropine 0.02 mg.kg-1 by mouth. A modified postbox test and the coding component of the Wechsler intelligence scale (WISC-R) was used to assess the preoperative effect of premedication on psychomotor function. Mood and sedation were also scored and related to serum midazolam concentrations. The children showed a significant decline in psychomotor performance 30 and 60 minutes after premedication when compared with their best unmedicated performance recorded the previous evening. This decline in psychomotor performance was only weakly associated with serum midazolam concentrations (r = 0.1). The postbox toy ratio is a suitable measurement of psychomotor performance in children because of its simplicity and ease of use in the clinical environment, although it may suffer the \"test-retest\" limitations of similar types of assessment. The sedative and anxiolytic effects of midazolam provide a quiet environment for a smooth induction of anaesthesia.", 
    "81": "The trial included 24 children (aged 2-7 yr) referred for dental treatment under general anesthesia, since conventional behavioral management methods had failed to achieve treatment acceptance. As an alternative, they received, on two separate occasions with \"identical\" dental treatment, conscious sedation by rectal administration of either midazolam (0.3 mg/kg body weight (bwt)) or midazolam (0.3 mg/kg bwt) plus ketamine (1.0 mg/kg bwt). This allowed a double-blind, crossover design. The aims were to assess conscious sedation, combined with local anesthesia, as an alternative to general anesthesia, and further to evaluate the effects obtained by addition of a low dose of ketamine to rectally administered midazolam. The feasibility of dental treatment was rated as excellent or good for 16 of the 24 children when premedicated with midazolam, and for 18 of the 24 children when ketamine was added to midazolam. At least some treatment could be given to all children. Verbal contact was maintained with all children throughout both treatment sessions. The children were significantly less anxious when they arrived for the second session. Amnesia and drowsiness were significantly increased when ketamine was added to midazolam. The combination also tended to be more efficient in relief of anxiety and prevention of pain, but there were large variations in the children's responses to the drugs. Midazolam significantly reduced the blood oxygen level, but not with ketamine added. For most children, both regimens proved to be appropriate as alternatives to general anesthesia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "82": "To evaluate the anxiolysis property of midazolam, 60 patients undergoing minor gynecological surgery were given midazolam 0 mg (n = 20), 2.5 mg (n = 20) or 4 mg (n = 20) intramuscularly as premedication 1 h before their entrance to operating theater. The degree of anxiety was evaluated objectively using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). STAI test was performed twice: on the day before operation and 1 h after receiving preanesthetic premedication. In only midazolam 4 mg group, anxiety was reduced significantly in the operating room compared to the day before operation. It is concluded that midazolam (4 mg) is suitable to reduce the preoperative anxiety in patients who are to undergo minor gynecological surgery.",

In only one patient, there was an initial involvement of the shoulder girdle muscles. Electromyography in all four patients at rest recorded continuous electric activity resembling an interference pattern. Following sudden exteroceptive stimuli the activity increased in amplitude and density this corresponded clinically to painful spasms. All patients had oligoclonal banding in CSF. In the serum and CSF of three patients IgG subtype autoantibodies were detected. These have been found to be directed against GABAergic nerve terminals in the rat and human cerebellum and, more specifically, to glutamic acid decarboxylase. All patients improved on clonazepam. Trials of intermittent high-dose methylprednisolone administration gave relief from rigidity in one patient and permitted reduction of clonazepam in another.

Of the intent-to-treat group of 209 patients, 184 completed 3 weeks of medication and were evaluated according to protocol. There was a completer rate for the 6 weeks of 94% (CT), 97% (XR), and 87% (placebo). On global measures, Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, phobia rating, and work disability measures, both active treatment groups were equally effective and significantly more efficacious than the placebo cell on endpoint MANOVA analysis.

The trial drug was injected into the deltoid muscle 45 min before the peri-ocular block. Dexmedetomidine 1.0 microgram.kg-1 decreased intra-ocular pressure before, during and after surgery. The maximum reduction in mean (SD) intra-ocular pressure occurred in the dexmedetomine group just before discharge from hospital (17.7 (2.8) mmHg to 11.5 (2.9) mmHg) (p < 0.001 compared with midazolam and placebo). In contrast, midazolam did not differ from saline placebo. Dexmedetomidine and midazolam produced a similar sedative effect of short duration. Dexmedetomidine induced a moderate decrease in blood pressure (p < 0.001 compared with placebo) and a slight but statistically significant decrease in heart rate throughout the study period (p < 0.001 compared with placebo). Dexmedetomidine 1.0 microgram.kg-1 intramuscularly, effectively reduced intra-ocular pressure and produced short-acting sedation with marginal cardiovascular effects; it may be a useful premedicant drug for elderly patients undergoing day-case cataract surgery under regional anaesthesia.", 
    "89": "Peripheral administration of the brain/gut peptide cholecystokinin (CCK) has been demonstrated to inhibit food intake in a variety of species, and administration of the specific type A CCK receptor antagonist devazepide increases food intake in a variety of experimental paradigms. The potency of CCK to inhibit intake depends upon a variety of factors, but CCK is generally less potent under conditions of elevated food intake. At different developmental stages, rats' intake requirements differ as growth rates change. To determine whether CCK plays a variable role in the control of intake in rats of different ages, we examined the feeding-inhibitory effect of various doses of CCK and the feeding-enhancing potential of various doses of devazepide on glucose consumption (0.5 kcal/ml) in male and female rats at 45-70 and 110-130 days of age. CCK was more potent in older male and female rats than in younger rats, and inhibited intake in a dose-related fashion. In younger rats, the efficacy of CCK was attenuated and the inhibition was not dose related. Administration of devazepide had no effect on intake in younger rats of either sex, but significantly increased glucose consumption in the older rats. These data suggest that during a period of rapid growth and high levels of food intake relative to body weight, adolescent rats are relatively insensitive to exogenous CCK and endogenous CCK does not appear to play a significant role in controlling their intake.", 
    "90": "Semiempirical quantum mechanical and molecular mechanics calculations were carried out to identify and characterize the steric and electronic properties that modulate ligand recognition and activation of the cerebellar GABAA/benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor. For this hypothesis development, thirteen compounds belonging to structurally diverse chemical families were selected for study. Among the compounds selected were nine that bind and four that do not bind with appreciable affinity to this receptor and some that are known agonists, antagonists and inverse agonists, as measured by their modulation of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) enhanced chloride ion flux in cerebellum. The stereoelectronic requirements for recognition deduced from commonalities among the ligands are the presence of at least two of three hydrogen bonding centers, and a lipophilic aromatic ring, in a specific spatial relationship. The results suggest that the selectivity for the cerebellar or Type I subtype, demonstrated by some of these ligands, could be failure to meet the requirements for binding at other receptors because of the absence of one of the proton accepting centers or the larger surface area and volume of these ligands. The requirement for activation, deduced from comparisons of agonist, antagonist, and inverse agonist properties is the presence of an electron accepting aromatic ring in a specific geometric arrangement with respect to the components of recognition. The validity of the '3D-Pharmacophore' developed was probed by using it for predictions of the behavior of 11 additional compounds not used for its development.", 
    "91": "During November and December of 1988, 1990, and 1991, a total of 22 free-ranging Juan Fern\u00e1ndez fur seal (Arctocephalus philippii) females from Alejandro Selkirk Island, Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Archipelago, Chile, were immobilized with a combination of ketamine and diazepam. Atropine sulphate was used to decrease respiratory secretions. The mean (+/- SD) induction dosages of ketamine and diazepam were 3.64 +/- 1.3 mg/kg and 0.12 +/- 0.07 mg/kg, respectively. Mean (+/- SD) induction time and time to recovery for females injected intramuscularly (IM) (15 +/- 7 min and 47 +/- 16 min) were significantly greater than for females injected intravenously (IV) (0.6 +/- 0.4 min and 26 +/- 11 min). Mean (+/- SD) heart rates and core temperatures were significantly higher for females injected IV (173 +/- 15.71 beats/min and 37.6 +/- 0.83 C) than for females injected IM (135 +/- 27.06 beats/min and 36.5 +/- 1.15 C). In addition, the IV route resulted in better levels of immobilization compared to the IM route. The degree of immobilization was not related to the dosages of ketamine and diazepam administered. Two animals died after drug administration.", 
    "92": "Abdominal epilepsy is a rare cause of abdominal pain. We report an adult patient with intermittent, paroxysmal epigastric abdominal pain, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, restlessness and anxiety. Physical examination was normal. Blood analysis disclosed only leucocytosis with neutrophilia. X ray examinations, ultrasound and CT abdominal scan, mesenteric arteriography and exploratory laparotomy did not show evidence of pathology. The electroencephalogram (EEG) showed bilateral theta slow activity during hyperventilation. We started treatment with carbamazepine and the patient remained asymptomatic for nine months. However he had a relapse because he did'nt take his medication regularly. At that time the serum levels of carbamazepine were low. The EEG showed bursts of diffuse paroxysmal acute waves. Once therapeutic serum levels of carbamazepine were achieved the pain disappeared. He has remained asymptomatic during the last twelve months, while taking his treatment regularly.", 
    "93": "The rat perfused hindlimb preparation was investigated as a model to study the dermal clearance and tissue distribution of three solutes with differing physicochemical properties ([3H]water, [3H]diazepam, and [14C]lignocaine). The dermal clearance of each solute increased and the depth of tissue preparation decreased with increasing perfusion flow rate. The half-life for solute efflux from tissues into perfusate, and the peak times for amount of solute in tissue were in the order water > lignocaine > diazepam. Topical iontophoresis, which has previously been shown to achieve similar clearances from topical sites to those seen following passive dermal application, resulted in a clearance of lignocaine in the perfused hindlimb comparable with that obtained in the preparation following passive absorption through exposed dermis. The distribution of capillary blood flow in the perfused hindlimb was quantified using 51Cr-labelled 15-microns microspheres, with greater increases in flow found in deeper muscle tissues with increasing perfusion flow rate compared with superficial layers. Microsphere studies in anaesthetized rats also demonstrate slight differences in the distribution of flow within the hindlimb compared with the perfused preparation. We conclude that the rat perfused hindlimb preparation successfully combines many of the advantages of in-vitro and in-vivo methods and has potential for routine use in the study of solute dermal absorption kinetics.", 
    "94": "The influence of flumazenil-precipitated diazepam withdrawal on intestinal myoelectric activity and colonic transit was evaluated, in diazepam-dependent rats. Administered intraperitoneally, flumazenil (15 mg kg-1) induced a strong stimulation of the duodenal spiking activity lasting 197 +/- 20 min, and accelerated colonic transit corresponding to a significantly (P < 0.05) increased value of the geometric centre (3.52 +/- 0.23 vs 2.44 +/- 0.1 for the control). Both devazepide and L365260 administered intracerebroventricularly at a dose of 10 micrograms kg-1 abolished the flumazenil-induced withdrawal effect on the duodenum, whereas at a lower dose (1 microgram kg-1) only L365260 was able to antagonize this effect. In the same way, devazepide, loxiglumide and L365260 suppressed the effect of precipitated withdrawal on colonic transit when administered intracerebroventricularly at a dose of 10 micrograms kg-1, whereas similar blockade was obtained at a dose of 5 micrograms kg-1 with L365260, and 10 ng kg-1 with PD135-158. It is concluded that in rats precipitated diazepam-withdrawal altered intestinal motility and colonic transit and that these effects are mediated by central release of cholecystokinin (CCK) or activation of CCK-ergic neurons.", 
    "95": "The effect of drugs bilaterally injected into the basolateral/medial nuclei of the amygdala on the behavior of male Wistar rats (300-330 g) in the elevated plus-maze was measured. The benzodiazepine agonist midazolam (MDZ, 20 and 40 nmol, 0.2 microliters; N = 8-14) significantly increased open-arm exploration (% open-arm entries: control = 20.27 +/- 3.71; 40 nmol MDZ = 42.63 +/- 7.16), having thus an anxiolytic effect. On the contrary, the non-selective 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin (KET, 1 and 10 nmol, 0.2 microliters; N = 8-11) had an anxiogenic effect (% open-arm entries: control = 35.61 +/- 6.41; 10 nmol KET = 18.65 +/- 3.89). The 5-HT1A full agonist 8-OH-DPAT (2, 4, and 8 nmol, 0.2 microliters; N = 9-12) did not significantly change rat behavior in the plus-maze. While the present anxiolytic effect of midazolam agrees with results reported by others using punished behavior, the effect of the serotonergic drugs does not. Therefore, the effect of 5-HT acting drugs injected into the amygdala may be determined by the type of experimental model of anxiety used.", 
    "96": "Benzodiazepines has been largely used to control anxiety and other clinical pictures since it began to be traded in the 60's. In recent years, many studies have shown that they are used indiscriminately, contributing to increase associated morbidity, and to search for other more accessible tranquilizers. PURPOSE--To estimate the prevalence of benzoadiazepine and over-the-counter tranquilizers use in adults living in Porto Alergre-RS, Brazil. METHODS--480 inhabitants of Porto Alegre, aged 18 or older, selected through a random cluster sampling procedure (sectors of the Brazilian Census), were interviewed in their homes during June, 1991. RESULTS--The prevalence for BDZ use during life, in the past year and in the past month was, respectively, 46.7%, 21.3% and 13.11%. Prevalence was significantly higher among women and widowers or divorced. The majority of those who used BDZ during the past month did so at least 2 or 3 days per week. More than 40% reported frequent over-the-counter substances use to \"tranquilize\", with a 28.8% prevalence for past month use. CONCLUSION--Chemical substance use to alleviate anxiety and other symptoms is generally spread. Legislation, not always respected, has been insufficient to discipline its use. Understanding the complexity of reasons for the situation to be unchanged is needed. Also necessary is the investment in education on adequate use of BDZ, both for physicians and population, and the search for legal measures that should be more efficient.",

    "101": "The present study investigates the role of serotonergic systems in anabolic steroid-induced aggression. An animal model of aggressive dominance was used to assess the chronic effects of testosterone propionate. When rats that had become dominant following administration of testosterone propionate received serotonergic agonists with selectivity for the 5-HT1A receptor (8-OH-DPAT, buspirone, gepirone), the 5-H1B receptor (eltoprazine, TFMPP), or the 5-HT2A/2C receptor (DOM), a dose-dependent decrease in dominance was demonstrated. Pretreatment with three serotonergic antagonists (pizotyline, pirenpirone, and pindolol) blocked agonist-induced reductions in dominance in varying degrees. Nonserotonergic agonists with CNS depressant effects were also tested in dominant animals. The benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide, did not reduce dominance except at doses that interfered with motor behavior. The opioid agonist, morphine, dose dependently decreased dominance, but this effect was reversible with administration of the serotonergic antagonist, pirenpirone, suggesting the antidominant effect of morphine had a serotonergic component. Biochemical experiments demonstrated that following chronic testosterone propionate, there was a decrease in levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the hippocampus but not in the striatum or the frontal cortex. Chronic testosterone propionate also caused an increase in the affinity of [3H]8-OH-DPAT for the 5-HT1A receptor but no corresponding change in the density of 5-HT1A binding sites in the hippocampus. There was also no change in the properties of the 5-HT2 receptor in the frontal cortex following chronic testosterone propionate. These data suggest that serotonergic systems may play an important role in the control of anabolic steroid-induced aggressive dominance.", 
    "102": "Block of AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate) and kainate currents by GYKI 52466 [1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8- methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine], a noncompetitive non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (AMPA/kainate) receptor antagonist, and two 3-N-substituted 3,4-reduced GYKI 52466 analogs was assessed in whole cell voltage-clamp recordings from cultured rat hippocampal neurons. In addition, the activity of the analogs was determined in the maximal electroshock seizure test and for protection against kainate-induced seizures in mice. The analogs of GYKI 52466 tested were the 3-N-methylcarbamyl [GYKI 53655; 1-(4-aminophenyl)-3-methylcarbamyl-4- methyl-3,4-dihydro-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine] and the 3-N-acetyl [GYKI 53405; 1-(4-aminophenyl)-3-acetyl-4-methyl-3,4-dihydro-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2, 3- benzodiazepine]. GYKI 53655 produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of AMPA- and kainate-induced currents with IC50 values of 1.1 and 1.5 microM, respectively; the corresponding values for GYKI 53405 were 3.8 and 5.0 microM. As blockers of AMPA currents, the analogs were 8- and 2.3-fold, respectively, more potent than the parent GYKI 52466. Kinetic analyses indicated increased association rates for the two 3-N-substituted analogs (2.5-2.6 x 10(5) M-1 sec-1) compared with GYKI 52466 (1.6 x 10(5) M-1 sec-1). The dissociation rates of GYKI 52466, GYKI 53405 and GYKI 53655 were inversely correlated with increasing blocking potency (2.9, 1.7 and 0.6 sec-1, respectively). Thus, the increased affinity of the 3-N-substituted analogs relates to their increased binding and decreased unbinding rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "103": "A cholecystokinin monoclonal antibody (CCK MAb) was used to immunoneutralize CCK to test the hypothesis that CCK produces satiety by an endocrine mechanism. We first characterized the effects of CCK MAb on pancreatic secretion. Conscious rats with jugular vein and bile-pancreatic duct cannulas received CCK MAb or control antibody intravenously 30 min before a 2-h maximal dose of CCK-8 (200 pmol.kg-1.h-1 i.v.) or access to food. CCK MAb caused dose-related inhibition of amylase secretion. CCK MAb (2 mg/kg) completely blocked the response to CCK-8 and inhibited the response to food by 89%. In feeding experiments, rats with free access to food received CCK MAb or control antibodies (2 mg/kg iv) 2 h after lights off. CCK MAb had no effect on 1.5- or 3.5-h food intake. Another group of rats received CCK MAb (4 mg/kg i.v.) or a combined injection of type A and type B CCK receptor antagonists devazepide and L-365,260 (1 mg/kg each i.v.). CCK MAb had no effect on feeding, whereas the receptor antagonists stimulated 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-h intake by 62, 45, 43, and 29%. These results suggest that endogenous CCK stimulates pancreatic enzyme secretion at least partially by an endocrine mechanism and produces satiety by a nonendocrine mechanism.",

The most important results of systematic studies in self-poisoning individuals over the last 20 years are summarized. Trichlorfon and diazepam caused a higher rate of aneuploidy in peripheral lymphocytes. The frequency of chromatid aberrations was lower in self-poisoned pregnant women than in self-poisoned non-pregnant women and these findings suggest a possible protective effect of pregnancy. Intrauterine growth retardation was found in children born after self-poisoning.", 
    "105": "For cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the endobronchial route represents a good means of administering drugs with a systemic effect, such as adrenaline and atropine, even without a venous line. Via this route, however, higher doses are needed (2.5 times as much as those normally given intravenously). In order to produce a larger surface area within the bronchio-alveolar space and thus speed up absorption, the drugs are diluted in 5-10 ml solvent (isotonic saline solution or distilled water). For endobronchial administration of a drug, various techniques are employed, for example, simply injecting it into the upper end of the (endotracheal) tube, puncture of the tube the use of an application probe introduced into the endobronchial tube, aspiration or venacaval catheter, or the EDGAR tube with an injection needle incorporated within the tube wall. After injection, the diluted medication is distributed into the tiny branches of the bronchial tree by repeated hyperventilation. Despite the need for an adequate alternative to the venous route in the field of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, we still have very few reliable facts about the endobronchial application technique."
