    "0": "In the staircase test, a naive mouse is placed in a Plexiglas chamber containing a five-step staircase, and the number of rearings and steps climbed are recorded for 3 min. A claim for drug-class specificity has been made because conventional anxiolytics reduced rearings at doses that did not reduce steps climbed, while non-anxiolytics affected both measures in parallel. In the present study chlordiazepoxide, meprobamate, and ethanol registered the expected true positive effect by reducing rearings at doses that did not reduce steps climbed. Nicotine, which has some clinical anxiolytic action, registered a small true positive. The benzodiazepine anxiolytic alprazolam reduced both measures, a false negative, although it reduced rearings more than steps climbed. The putative novel anxiolytics CGS 9896, ketanserine, and tracazolate registered negatives, as did the known clinical anxiolytic buspirone. The non-anxiolytics phencyclidine and phenacetin registered true negatives, but morphine registered a clear false positive. The anxiogenics FG 7142 and pentylenetetrazol produced no significant effects. Because of the equivocal false negative for alprazolam, the clear false negative for buspirone, and the clear false positive for morphine, we concluded that the test lacks the degree of therapeutic-class specificity previously proposed but may still be useful in basic research.", 
    "1": "This review describes the behavioural and biochemical profile of tofisopam, a 3,4-benzodiazepine that differs considerably in its effects and mechanisms of action from classical 1,4-benzodiazepines. In man tofisopam appears to possess anxiolytic activity without appreciable sedative and muscle relaxant side effects; in animals, however, tofisopam totally lacks anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties in tests sensitive to the effects of 1,4-benzodiazepines. Tofisopam also has mixed dopamine agonist and antagonist-like properties in several in vivo and in vitro tests in animals. The possible relevance of the latter effects to the unusual behavioural profile of tofisopam are discussed, and its effects compared with those of buspirone, a novel anxiolytic that has similar activity at benzodiazepine and dopamine systems. It is proposed that these two drugs may represent a novel class of compounds that reduce anxiety by increasing the ability of patients to cope with daily tasks, rather than classical anxiolytics, that reduce anxiety by tranquilization.", 
    "2": "Buspirone is a novel anxiolytic whose pharmacological profile differs from that of the benzodiazepines and includes dopaminergic agonist effects. Because of these properties, buspirone's usefulness in the management of idiopathic Parkinson's disease was evaluated in a controlled study of 16 outpatients with stage I-IV disease. At doses of 10 to 60 mg/day, no significant group or individual effects could be discerned on standardized disability, dyskinesia, anxiety, or depression scales. At high dose levels (100 mg/day) however, there was a significant worsening of disability ratings and a decrease in dyskinesia scores; anxiety ratings were also significantly increased. The results indicate that buspirone is well tolerated by parkinsonian patients at conventional antianxiety doses of 10 to 40 mg. Clinical effects of high dose treatment, on the other hand, resemble those associated with a reduction in central dopamine mediated synaptic function. Since buspirone reportedly produces dose-dependent stimulation of norepinephrine containing neurons in the locus ceruleus and behavioral symptoms of such activation were observed, these clinical observations support the concept that central noradrenergic stimulation can adversely affect parkinsonian symptoms.", 
    "3": "Zolpidem is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic drug which displaces benzodiazepines from their binding sites in different brain structures. Previous work has demonstrated several differences between zolpidem and benzodiazepines, including differences between the stimulus properties of zolpidem and chlordiazepoxide. In the present study the discriminative stimulus properties of zolpidem were analysed by training rats to discriminate between this drug and saline. It was found that stimulus control developed readily with 2 mg/kg but not with 1 mg/kg zolpidem. The effect was dose-related, had a short duration of action and was antagonised by Ro 15-1788. Furthermore, stimulus control produced by zolpidem was associated with marked reductions in rates of responding. Injections of chlordiazepoxide, triazolam, lorazepam, zopiclone, CL 218,872 and pentobarbital produced dose-related responding on the zolpidem-associated lever but haloperidol did not. However, in general, the doses of those drugs which produced drug-lever responding also reduced response rates. It is possible that the above mentioned differences between the discriminative stimulus produced by zolpidem in rats and those produced by other sedatives may be due to a selective action of zolpidem on a sub-type of benzodiazepine binding site.", 
    "4": "The four most frequently used groups of drugs in psychiatric therapy are: neuroleptics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and lithium salts. Their introduction came largely during the past 3 decades. This review summarizes the history of the research that led to their discovery and to the present concept of their modes of action.", 
    "5": "A 14-year-old previously fit schoolboy was admitted with staphylococcal pneumonia secondary to influenza A infection. His condition deteriorated as he developed adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); during a stormy recovery exceptionally high doses of benzodiazepines and opiates were given in order to suppress voluntary breathing during a successful period of assisted ventilation. It is possible that benzodiazepine-opiate antagonism developed. Subsequent studies in laboratory mice indicate that the respiratory depressant effects of morphine can be antagonized by prior treatment with lorazepam.", 
    "6": "The pharmacokinetics of the newer 1, 4 benzodiazepine temazepam were evaluated in 16 healthy subjects aged 18-92 years and in 15 cirrhotic patients, to ascertain the effect of ageing and liver disease. The data were analysed both by classic two compartment and by non-compartmental methods. The mean elimination half-life in the control subjects was 15.5 h, considerably longer than previous estimates. No correlation was found between age and pharmacokinetic parameters. The cirrhotic group showed no statistically significant difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters nor in the urinary recovery of the dose from the control group. Temazepam plasma protein binding was assessed in a second group of 9 cirrhotics of similar severity to the main group and in matched controls. When these binding data were applied to the mean clearance data, a modest although not statistically significant, reduction in free drug clearance was observed in the cirrhotic group. This study adds further support to the observation that drugs which undergo ether glucuronidation have normal elimination patterns in patients with liver disease. Temazepam may prove to be a useful hypnotic sedative in patients with liver disease.", 
    "7": "Congestive heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by striking abnormalities of the autonomic nervous system. The mechanisms and biological importance of these disturbances are not clearly defined. Nonetheless, it is possible that autonomic disturbances play an important role in the pathophysiology and prognosis of heart failure, and therefore drugs that alter autonomic function may provide additional therapeutic options in the management of this syndrome.", 
    "8": "A variety of the anticonvulsant drugs, including carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, phenobarbital, clonazepam, valproic acid, and ethosuximide, are available for use in the treatment of patients with seizure disorders. These anticonvulsants vary in their efficacy against experimental seizures in animals and against seizures in humans. The mechanistic basis for this variability in anticonvulsant drug action remains uncertain, but numerous mechanisms of action have been proposed. We have used mouse neurons in primary dissociated cell culture to study the action of these anticonvulsant drugs on several aspects of membrane excitability and synaptic transmission. We have proposed that the anticonvulsant drugs can be classified according to their actions on sustained high frequency repetitive firing (SRF) of action potentials and on postsynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses. Phenytoin and carbamazepine were both effective against SRF but did not modify postsynaptic GABA responses at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Phenobarbital, benzodiazepines, and valproic acid modified both SRF and postsynaptic GABA responses. Ethosuximide had no effect on SRF or GABAergic mechanisms. Based on these results, we have proposed that blockade of SRF may underlie the action of phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, valproic acid, and benzodiazepines against generalized tonic-clonic seizures in humans and maximal electroshock seizures in animals. Enhancement of GABAergic synaptic transmission may underlie efficacy of benzodiazepines and valproic-acid drugs against generalized absence seizures in humans and pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in experimental animals. The mechanism of action of ethosuximide against generalized absence seizures in humans and pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in experimental animals may be by a third, as yet unknown, mechanism.", 
    "9": "In an age of widespread availability of psychoactive drugs, use of multiple sedatives is very common. Why such multiple drug use prevails is poorly understood. Sequential drug use may leave sequential problems. Concomitant use of several drugs can produce a host of interactions. Increasingly, the metabolic basis of sedative interactions are becoming known. Cross-tolerance between sedatives permit substitution of one for another and reduced sedation when combined. Metabolic interactions at the hepatic oxidation enzyme level may greatly affect drug disposal rates. Recognition of polysubstance abuse can assist in management. Treatment ranges from urgent life support to abrupt or slow withdrawal, to substitution long-term treatment usually requiring specialized care, with abstinence the preferred goal. However, polysubstance abusers seem to have low probabilities of achieving lasting abstinence.", 
    "10": "All patients in alcohol withdrawal should have a full assessment for detecting medical complications. The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA-A) scale permits a quantitative assessment for following the clinical course and therapeutic response in patients in withdrawal. Most patients with mild withdrawal symptoms do not require hospitalization and respond to non-pharmacologic supportive care. Early initiation of treatment with supportive nursing care and, if necessary, benzodiazepines usually will prevent progression to serious withdrawal reactions and provide the patient with sufficient symptomatic relief. Pharmacotherapy can be considerably simplified by using the loading dose technique, i.e., giving diazepam every 1-2 hr initially until the patient shows signs of clinical improvement and/or mild sedation. If long half-life drugs (e.g., diazepam) are used, further therapy is rarely needed and complications are prevented. Short-acting benzodiazepines can also be given in a similar fashion in the milder clinical syndrome. Phenytoin should only be given to patients with a preexisting seizure disorder. Phenothiazines, barbiturates, paraldehyde, and antihistamines have no role in the treatment of withdrawal because of their toxicity or lack of efficacy. Haloperidol is effective in the control of hallucinations in patients also treated with a benzodiazepine. The treatment of alcoholic intoxication and withdrawal is only the first step toward full rehabilitation.", 
    "11": "Rats that are placed in a novel environment containing a probe will explore the environment and the probe. Exploration of the probe is reduced when the probe is electrified. We here report that chlordiazepoxide blocks this inhibition, and have determined some of the pharmacological features of this new experimental procedure. The procedure appears to be sensitive to the effects of several benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and related compounds. Limited activity was observed with most 5-HT antagonists, ritanserin, an anticholinergic, a beta-adrenergic blocker and a neuroleptic. Of the antidepressants, only imipramine had some limited activity. Inactive compounds in this procedure include benzodiazepine antagonists, buspirone, convulsants, opiates, an opiate antagonist, stimulants, a putative DA agonist and antagonist, histamine antagonists, a cholinomimetic, anticholinergics, a NE antagonist, alpha 2 agonists, an alpha 2 antagonist, MAO inhibitors, 5-HTP and LSD.", 
    "12": "The performance of 43 long-term users (average = 5 years) of benzodiazepine (BZ) medications was examined on a battery of behavioral tasks, cognitive tests, and subjective mood rating scales. The performance of the chronic BZ users did not differ significantly from age- and sex-matched anxious subjects, except that critical flicker fusion (CFF) thresholds were lower and subjective ratings of tranquilization were higher in the BZ users. Twenty-two subjects were reexamined in order to determine the acute effects of BZ medications in long-term users. The acute administration of BZ medications significantly increased CFF thresholds, improved digit-symbol substitution test performance, impaired the delayed recall of verbal material, increased subjective ratings of tranquilization, and reduced physical sedation. Motor performance tests were not impaired and subjective feelings of sedation were not increased after the acute administration of BZs by chronic users. During withdrawal from long-term BZ use (17 subjects), CFF thresholds were elevated, subjective ratings of physical sedation and anxiety were increased, but performance on other psychomotor and cognitive tests was not altered. The results suggest that tolerance develops selectively to different behavioral and subjective effects of BZ medications with their continued use. Tolerance failed to develop to the antianxiety effects, the reduction of CFF threshold, and to the impairment of short-term memory caused by BZs. However, chronic users of BZ medications failed to demonstrate psychomotor-impairing or sedating effects to BZ medications. The results have implications for evaluating the safety of the long-term use of BZ medications.", 
    "13": "A double-blind, parallel group, randomized trial was carried out to compare the hypnotic efficacy, tolerance and psychometric effects of two doses of loprazolam and placebo in 89 elderly hospital in-patients. All had disturbed sleep patterns, which were not the result of serious psychiatric or physical illness and, after a 1 or 2 day single-blind placebo baseline period, they received either 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg loprazolam or placebo administered double-blind for 5 days. The sleep of patients in all three treatment groups, as measured by patient self-rating scales, substantially improved during the study, with loprazolam being superior to placebo for measures of sleep latency, satisfaction with sleep, number of nocturnal awakenings and feeling refreshed on waking. Differences in hypnotic efficacy between the 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg loprazolam groups were not significant. The incidence of side-effects was low and, although there was a significant relationship with loprazolam treatment, this was not dose-related. Performance tests for residual effects (critical flicker fusion threshold and choice reaction time) showed no difference between the placebo and active treatment groups, suggesting that loprazolam, even in a dose of 1.0 mg, is unlikely to produce hangover effects. It is concluded that the findings confirm that loprazolam is an effective and well-tolerated hypnotic in the elderly and that a 0.5 mg dose would be an appropriate initial dose for older patients.", 
    "14": "The hemodynamic effects of vecuronium 0.2 mg/kg were investigated in 11 patients with coronary artery disease. Vecuronium, at a dose double the ED90, produced 90% neuromuscular block in a mean time of 163 +/- 7 s, and was not associated with any significant hemodynamic changes. The results suggest that vecuronium can safely be used in cardiac patients.", 
    "15": "The behavioral effects of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 were studied in squirrel monkeys after acute injections of benzodiazepines. Monkeys responded under a multiple schedule of food presentation with alternating fixed-interval (FI) and fixed-ratio (FR) components, Chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg) increased FI responding and had little effect on FR responding 1 h after it was administered; FI responding was still elevated during the session on the following day. When Ro 15-1788 (0.1-3 mg/kg) was administered 1 h after chlordiazepoxide, it antagonized the effects of chlordiazepoxide in a dose-related manner. When Ro 15-1788 was administered 1 day after chlordiazepoxide, however, doses of 1 or 3 mg/kg suppressed both FI and FR responding. Suppression of schedule-controlled responding was also observed when Ro 15-1788 (3 mg/kg) was administered 1 day after diazepam (3 or 5.6 mg/kg) or N-desmethyldiazepam (5.6 mg/kg). The results show that Ro 15-1788 can precipitate disruption of schedule-controlled behavior 1 day after acute treatment with benzodiazepines.", 
    "16": "The involvement of noradrenaline in the potentiation of head-twitching by drugs acting at GABA and related receptors has been examined in mice. The direct 5-HT agonist 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine was used to induce the head-twitch. The dopamine beta-oxidase inhibitor FLA-63 depleted whole brain noradrenaline by 90% and potentiated head-twitching when this was measured 4 h after injection. The GABAA-receptor agonists muscimol and 3-aminopropanesulphonic acid (3-APS), a low dose of pentobarbitone, diazepam and picrotoxin (PTX) potentiated control head-twitch rates but had no further effect when head-twitching had been potentiated by FLA-63. The potentiating action of FLA-63 was prevented by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol; the latter having no effect on control head-twitch rates. Muscimol and diazepam potentiation was examined and found to be blocked by metoprolol. The GABAB-receptor agonist baclofen reduced head-twitching. This was also prevented by FLA-63. The role of beta-adrenoceptors in modulating these actions of GABA-related drugs is discussed.", 
    "17": "Reliable benzodiazepine prescription data are now available for the Federal Republic of Germany by the establishment of GKV-Index. In 1981, 4 benzodiazepines were among the 25 highest ranking drugs in the FRG according to total number of prescriptions. A decline of benzodiazepine prescriptions was observed in 1983 and 1984; two short-acting compounds achieved a higher ranking position. Benzodiazepines make up to about two thirds of all psychotropic drugs prescribed. These data are compared to some figures from Scandinavian countries. In addition, prescription data of 369 outpatients of 42 psychiatrists in private practice in Berlin (West) are presented. Some data on the occurrence of abuse and dependence on benzodiazepines are presented coming from 4 different sources: The spontaneous ADR monitoring of the Medicines Commission of the German Medical Profession; a hospital-based study at the university of G\u00f6ttingen; a collaborative hospital-based ADR monitoring (AMUP); an outpatient study with psychiatrists in private practice.", 
    "18": "Clinical studies on spontaneous afternoon cortisol levels in depressed patients revealed that oxazepam given a few hours before blood sampling, may suppress the cortisol levels. This was confirmed in a volunteer study, where oxazepam 30 and 60 mg caused a dose-dependent suppression of the cortisol level only lasting 2 or 3 hours in spite of persisting high oxazepam levels in plasma. Subsequently, a study in 28 depressed patients showed a substantial suppression of afternoon cortisol after oxazepam 45 mg given 2 hrs prior to sampling. It may be postulated that this effect is mediated through GABA-ergic receptors inhibiting the hypothalamic release of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF). This is interesting since CRF may have neurotropic effects related to the behavioral responses to stress, and the inhibitory effect thus may represent a mechanism of action for the anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepines.", 
    "19": "According to ideas about the diffusion layer in the process of dissolving solids the release of medazepam as a model substance for heavy-soluble, weak alkaline substances is modified by incorporation of solid acids of different solubility and dissociation rate into the matrix. The determination of the solubility and a \"virtual\" pH-value within the matrix tablets leads to the evaluation of the liberation. A relatively continuous release of medazepam following different pH-values in the medium was obtained by microencapsulation of the citrus acid incorporated. Using the ideas of the diffusion layer to explain the conditions within the matrix it becomes possible to control and influence the drug release from the matrix tablet.", 
    "20": "The pharmacokinetics of oral midazolam (Dormicum, 15 mg) and loprazolam (Dormonoct, 1 mg) were studied in eight healthy young volunteers in a cross-over design. Plasma concentrations of midazolam were measured with a gas chromatographic method and loprazolam concentrations were determined by a radio-receptor technique. Absorption of midazolam proceeded very rapidly (median tmax = 0.4 h) and a rapid onset of sedative action was observed. Loprazolam absorption was relatively slow (median tmax = 3 h) and its absorption profile was often irregular. Most subjects fell asleep before peak concentrations were reached. Median peak concentrations were 94 ng ml-1 and 3.1 ng ml-1 for midazolam and loprozolam, respectively. The median elimination half-life of midazolam was 1.8 h and that of loprazolam 15 h. It is possible that the elimination half-life of loprazolam as determined by radioreceptor assay is determined by active metabolites rather than by loprazolam itself. Midazolam elimination half-life was the same when determined by radioreceptor assay or by GLC. There was no significant correlation between the half-lives of the two drugs.", 
    "21": "Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the soft gelatin capsule and tablet form of temazepam were compared. In a single blind study, six healthy volunteers, in the supine position, took either a tablet of temazepam 20 mg or a soft gelatin capsule of temazepam 20 mg. Sixty gynaecological in-patients received either a tablet or a soft gelatin capsule of temazepam 20 mg the night before surgery as premedication. Subjective parameters were assessed in the morning. The soft gelatin capsule yielded clearly higher serum concentrations during the first hour after administration. In the pharmacodynamic parameters there were slight but insignificant differences in favour of the capsule form. As a premedicant the capsule resulted in a significantly (P less than 0.01) shorter delay in the onset of sedative action and to an almost significant (P less than 0.05) delay in falling asleep; also an almost significantly (P less than 0.05) longer action of sleep in comparison with the tablet.", 
    "22": "In a randomised, double-blind, parallel groups study, 40 patients referred for surgical removal of impacted third molars received either (a) temazepam 40 mg orally followed at 35 min by IV saline or (b) oral placebo followed by IV diazepam 10 mg (Diazemuls). Patients were divided into High-Anxious and Low-Anxious groups by median split of their anxiety scores on the Speilberger State Anxiety Scale at the time of oral medication. Compared with placebo, temazepam significantly attenuated anticipatory anxiety in the High-Anxious group while in the Low-Anxious group no difference was found between the treatments. Preoperative but not intraoperative heart-rate distinguished between the High-Anxious and Low-Anxious groups and neither oral temazepam nor IV diazepam abolished the heart-rate response to the traumatic stages of the surgical procedure. The results are interpreted as providing support in a \"real life\" human stress setting for Gray's neuropsychological model of anxiety.", 
    "23": "The relationship between wet-dog shaking (WDS) and after-discharge (AD), and the effects of neuroleptics on WDS and AD elicited by hippocampal stimulation, were investigated. AD elicited by hippocampal stimulation consisted of primary and secondary phases. The intensity of the WDS during a 150 sec observation period showed two peaks. The intensity of WDS was reached at the 1st and 2nd peak in the 1st and the 2nd phase of AD, respectively. Haloperidol and chlorpromazine significantly and dose-dependently blocked the appearance of WDS. In particular, the number of WDS decreased during the early 1st phase and the 2nd phase of AD, after hippocampal stimulation. When the hippocampus was stimulated at intervals of 24 hr for 3 successive days a week, the number of WDS during 10-40 sec after stimulation decreased gradually and a small peak appeared during 40-60 sec in the 3rd and 4th week group. This pattern is similar to that seen in the chlorpromazine- and haloperidol-injected group. The possibility that seizure susceptibility, when the hippocampus is stimulated repeatedly, mimicks findings in case of blockage of dopaminergic function by the injection of neuroleptics, has to be considered.", 
    "24": "Three benzodiazepines, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and flurazepam, were demonstrated to reverse the suppressed food intake in mice in response to cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK8). CCK8 (200 ng) was administered intracisternally, and the benzodiazepines intraperitoneally at doses of 0.1 to 1 mg/kg. The three benzodiazepines slightly depressed the feeding by themselves, but significantly reversed the satiety effects of CCK8. Naloxone (2 mg/kg) decreased the food intake but failed to reverse the CCK8 satiety action. The benzodiazepines were considered to antagonize the satiety action of CCK8 in the central nervous system through unknown mechanisms.", 
    "25": "A recent study has shown that the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, has an additional action, in micromolar concentrations, to inhibit the binding of [3H]benzodiazepines to their receptors in the CNS. An important question raised by this finding is to what extent the behavioural effects of yohimbine can be attributed to this action. Yohimbine (1.25-2.5 mg/kg) produced a dose-related decrease in exploratory head-dipping and locomotor activity in the holeboard test. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine, in small doses (0.01-0.025 mg/kg), antagonized the reduction in exploratory head-dipping and locomotor activity produced by yohimbine (2.5 mg/kg). The benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (5-10 mg/kg), which reduces the activity of noradrenergic neurones, antagonized the effects of yohimbine less effectively. The inability of flumazepil (10-20 mg/kg; Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) to reverse the effects of yohimbine suggested that the low-affinity effect of yohimbine to displace the binding of benzodiazepines from their receptors, is not important in its behavioural effects in the holeboard, but that these effects are attributable to the alpha 2-antagonist action of yohimbine. These conclusions are consistent with previous results in an animal test of anxiety.", 
    "26": "The high-affinity binding of thirteen ligands to putative neurotransmitter receptors was studied in temporal cortex of control and Alzheimer-type dementia (ATD) patients. A selective reduction of serotonin S2 receptors was observed in the ATD patients, to 57% of controls with no change in S1 receptors. Of the other ligand binding sites studied, only 3H-flunitrazepam binding was significantly reduced, to 84% of controls. Ligand binding sites which were unchanged in ATD temporal cortex included those labelled by adrenergic, adenosine, histamine, opiate, GABA, benzodiazepine and cholinergic ligands.", 
    "27": "Structure-activity of primary afferent depolarising action (PAD) mediated by gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) analogues suggests a difference between subsynaptic receptors located at fibre terminations within the dorsal horn and axonal receptors which are distributed throughout non-synaptic regions. The interaction of the bicuculline-sensitive GABA receptor (GABA A) ionophore complex with barbiturates and benzodiazepines suggests that at least three binding sites are required to explain the independent GABA-mimetic, GABA-potentiating and picrotoxin-reversing effects of such agents. Difficulties with explanation of the depressant effects of baclofen on spinal transmission, in terms of the bicuculline-resistant GABA (GABA B) receptor hypothesis, are mentioned. Glutamate-induced PAD of low threshold afferents is mediated indirectly through release of potassium. However, such terminals possess receptors (possibly autoreceptors for L-glutamate), activated by (+)2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate, which cause depression of transmitter release. Primary afferent C-fibres possess receptors which are selectively activated by kainate and which mediate picrotoxin-resistant PAD. Such receptors may be involved in the presynaptic conditioning of C-fibre transmitter release. The peripheral terminals of vestibular primary afferents, in amphibia, possess excitatory amino acid receptors which are probably activated by the transmitter released from hair cells.", 
    "28": "Interaction between the clinical, EEG-effects and phenazepam concentration in the blood was studied in 111 patients with neurotic disorders after intake of the test drug dose (2 mg) administered singly and on the 14th day of the treatment. It was established that EEG changes commonly induced by benzodiazepines supervene primarily within the interval of 1 to 3 h after a single intake which correlates with the maximal degree of the tranquilizing, somnolent and myorelaxant drug action. It was demonstrated that the clinical and EEG-effects occur before attainment of the maximal phenazepam concentration and then become less potent, with preservation of the high blood drug level. Intake of the test dose during the treatment course is characterized, as compared with the effect of a single intake, by less marked clinical action of the drug and the lack of significant changes on the EEG and in the blood phenazepam concentration.", 
    "29": "It has been shown in experiments on noninbred male rats that 17 beta-acetylamino-5-androstene-3 beta,16 beta-diol, 17 beta-amino-5-androstene-3 beta,16 beta-diol hydrochloride, and 17 beta-acetylamino-4-androstene-3,16-dione have an anxiolytic action. These compounds do not exhibit any myorelaxant, anticonvulsant or antineurotic activity common to benzodiazepine tranquilizers. The anxiolytic effect of the compounds under consideration is coupled with the ability to reduce the level of alcoholic motivation in rats.", 
    "30": "The metabolic fate of oxazepam in the rat is more complex than in larger animal species. Condensation of the diazepinyl ring and phase 1 transformations which lead presumedly via an epoxide to metabolites hydroxylated on the 5-phenyl moiety of oxazepam occurs in addition to glucuronidation, which has often been reported to be predominant in larger species. Unchanged oxazepam is the major compound in plasma, liver, and kidney, but phase 1 and phase ii metabolites also are found. In brain, though, only oxazepam is recognized, and a brain/plasma ratio of approximately 3-5:1 demonstrates that the drug has considerable affinity for that tissue. Excretion of oxazepam and its biotransformation products occurs mainly by the fecal route (70.7 +/- 6.0% of the dose) via biliary secretion. Glucuronides and sulfates of the hydroxylated metabolites and oxazepam and its glucuronide are secreted into bile, but only oxazepam, 4'-hydroxyoxazepam, and unknown polar metabolites constitute most of the fecal radioactivity, suggesting that enterohepatic circulation and intestinal metabolism are significant in the rat.", 
    "31": "The most potent agents currently available for suppressing myoclonic activity in animals and humans act to enhance GABA-mediated inhibition and/or to diminish amino acid-induced excitation. Postsynaptic GABA-mediated inhibition plays an important role at the cortical level, diminishing the effect of augmented afferent activity and preventing pathologically enhanced output. Enhancement of GABAergic inhibition, principally at the cortical level but also at lower levels, by clonazepam and by valproate appears to be a predominant element in their antimyoclonic action. Studies in various animal models, including photically induced myoclonus in the baboon, P papio, indicate the value of other approaches to enhancing GABA-mediated inhibition. Among such approaches meriting evaluation in humans are inhibition of GABA-transaminase activity by gamma-vinyl GABA and action at some of the benzodiazepine receptors to enhance the action of GABA, as by the novel anticonvulsant beta-carbolines. Excitatory transmission mediated by dicarboxylic amino acids appears to play a role in myoclonus, especially at the spinal level, but also in the brainstem, cerebellum, basal ganglia, and cortex. Among various novel agents that act at the postsynaptic receptor site to antagonize such excitation, those specifically blocking excitation induced by aspartate and/or NMDA prevent myoclonic activity in a wide range of animal models. Further research is required before such agents can be evaluated in humans.", 
    "32": "14C-Estazolam (2 mg) administered orally to dogs and human subjects was rapidly and completely absorbed with peak plasma levels occurring within one hour. In humans, plasma levels peaked at 103 +/- 18 ng/ml and declined monoexponentially with a half-life of 14 h. The mean concn. of estazolam in dog plasma at 0.5 h was 186 ng/ml. Six metabolites were found in dog plasma at 0.5 and 8 h, whereas only two metabolites were detected in human plasma up to 18 h. Metabolites common to both species were 1-oxo-estazolam (I) and 4-hydroxy-estazolam (IV). Major metabolites in dog and human plasma were free and conjugated 4-hydroxy-estazolam; the concn. were higher in dogs. After five days, 79% and 87% of the administered radioactivity was excreted in dog and human urine, respectively. Faecal excretion accounted for 19% of the dose in dog and 4% in man. Eleven metabolites were found in the 0-72 h urine of dogs and humans; less than 4% dose was excreted unchanged. Four metabolites were identified as: 1-oxo-estazolam (I), 4'-hydroxy-estazolam (II), 4-hydroxy-estazolam (IV) and the benzophenone (VII), as free metabolites and glucuronides. The major metabolite in dog urine was 4-hydroxy-estazolam (20% of the dose), while the predominant metabolite in human urine (17%) has not been identified, but is likely to be a metabolite of 4-hydroxy-estazolam. The metabolism of estazolam is similar in dog and man.", 
    "33": "In a paradigm of female aggression, maternal aggression, low doses of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) enhanced aggression, whereas the serenic drug fluprazine dose-dependently decreased aggression. In this study one selected dose of CDP (5 mg/kg PO) clearly enhanced aggression of female lactating rats against a naive male intruder. This dose of CDP however, was not able to antagonize the dose-dependent decrease observed after fluprazine treatment (5, 10, 20 mg/kg IP). These data suggest that fluprazine and CDP do not simply have opposite effects at the same site of action. It is suggested that fluprazine decreased the offensive motivation of animals, whereas CDP increased attacks indirectly by reduction of the approach-avoidance conflict in a social context.", 
    "34": "A group of 45 male alcoholics were studied during acute withdrawal. Patients were kept in hospital and treated with amobarbital (15 patients), oxazepam (15 patients), and melperone (15 patients) respectively in a double-blind design. Clinical symptoms were rated with a modified version of the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale after 1, 4 and 7 days. Blood pressure, body temperature and pulse rate were also recorded. Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid was collected after 1 and 7 days. A group of healthy males served as controls. The three treatment groups showed only small differences with regard to the investigated clinical items, except for a higher incidence of epileptic fits being evidenced in the melperone group. Levels of HVA in the cerebrospinal fluid did not differ between the treatment groups and the controls and did not change during treatment. Statistically significant correlations were noted between levels of HVA and auditory and visual hallucinations as well as concentration difficulties. Assuming that HVA levels reflect the activity of the central nervous dopamine system, the findings indicate a connection between central dopamine metabolism, psychotic symptoms and possibly other symptoms during acute alcohol withdrawal in man.", 
    "35": "Serotonin (5-HT) and catecholamine (CA) turnover rates in midbrain-hindbrain were investigated in rats treated with the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (CDP) or with the anxiolytic triazolopyridazine CL 218,872. A single injection of CDP (2.5-20 mg/kg) decreased 5-HT but not CA turnover rates. Seven daily CDP injections decreased the turnover rates of both 5-HT and CA. In contrast, neither acute nor chronic administration of CL 218,872 (2.5-20 mg/kg) altered baseline turnover rates of 5-HT or CA. Since CL 218,872 has a selective affinity for Type I benzodiazepine receptors, these results suggest that stimulation of Type I receptors is not sufficient to decrease 5-HT or CA turnover rates in midbrain-hindbrain. More importantly, these results question the long-held belief that benzodiazepines exert their anxiolytic and depressant effects through reductions in 5-HT and CA turnover respectively.", 
    "36": "Alprazolam, when added under double-blind conditions to a stable neuroleptic regimen in two patients with schizophrenia, resulted in clinically apparent improvement in positive and negative schizophrenic symptoms. Both patients showed significant worsening of symptoms following reduction or discontinuation of alprazolam.", 
    "37": "In this study we examined the role of M1- and M2-muscarinic receptors in the mediation of circular smooth muscle esophageal contractions elicited by pharmacological cholinergic stimulation and during peristalsis in anesthetized opossums. Esophageal-body contractions were induced by bethanechol administration, whereas peristalsis was elicited by pharyngeal stroking or cervical vagal stimulation. Contractions were measured by a low-compliance manometric recording system. The incidence and amplitude of bethanechol-induced contractions were antagonized by 4-diphenylacetoxy-n-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) and atropine but not pirenzepine. 4-DAMP and atropine caused an increased velocity, decreased amplitude, and preferential reduction of the incidence of primary peristaltic contractions in the proximal smooth muscle esophagus. During long-train vagal stimulation, intra-stimulus A-waves had a velocity similar to primary peristalsis, whereas poststimulus B-waves showed a velocity considerably faster than primary peristalsis. Short-train vagal stimulation produced a contraction sequence, termed an \"S-wave,\" that had a velocity similar to that of the A-wave. At low doses 4-DAMP increased the velocity and decreased the amplitude of A-wave and S-wave contractions, and at high doses 4-DAMP abolished both the A-wave and S-wave contractions. B-wave contractions were minimally affected by 4-DAMP. Pirenzepine had no effect on contractions induced by swallows or vagal stimulation. We conclude that M2-muscarinic receptors mediate esophageal contractions in the circular smooth muscle during primary peristalsis and during A-waves and S-waves induced by vagal stimulation, and M1-receptors do not have any important role in the excitatory neural pathway to the esophagus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "38": "The kinetics of a single oral dose of the benzodiazepine hypnotic temazepam was evaluated in nine patients with biopsy-proven cirrhosis and in seven healthy controls matched for age and sex. Peak serum temazepam concentrations were reached later in cirrhotics than in controls (2.9 versus 0.6 h after dosage; p less than 0.05), indicating slower temazepam absorption in patients with cirrhosis. Temazepam volume of distribution was smaller in cirrhotics compared to controls, and elimination half-life shorter (10.6 versus 14.6 h). However, these differences were not significant. There were no significant differences between cirrhotics and controls in clearance of total temazepam (1.03 versus 1.03 ml/min/kg), clearance of unbound temazepam (27 versus 31 ml/min/kg), or free fraction in serum (3.9 versus 3.5% unbound). In two cirrhotic patients who received 20 mg of temazepam daily for 8 days, the extent of accumulation was consistent with the dosage interval relative to the elimination half-life, and was similar to the accumulation profile in healthy volunteers. Thus the onset of temazepam hypnotic activity may be delayed in cirrhotic patients, but the rate of elimination and the extent of accumulation are not altered compared to healthy persons of similar age and sex.", 
    "39": "Seizures were observed following the withdrawal of alprazolam administered in therapeutic dose for 10 weeks. A review of available case reports suggests that seizures, like other withdrawal phenomena, are more apt to occur with short-acting benzodiazepines. To prevent their occurrence these drugs should be discontinued gradually and consideration given to substituting long-acting drugs during the withdrawal period. Physicians should remain alert to the fact that seizures may occur as early as 24 hours after the abrupt withdrawal of short-acting benzodiazepines.", 
    "40": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an uncommon but difficult to manage problem. Behaviour therapy is the treatment of choice, with clomipramine as an adjunct in patients with coexisting depression. However, the incidence of side effects with the doses required (up to 200 mg daily, or occasionally higher) is high, and the side effects may be intolerable to some patients. Benzodiazepines have no effect on the core symptoms of OCD, and their usefulness as long term anxiolytics is outweighed by the risks of physical and psychological dependence. There is no place for antipsychotic drugs in managing obsessive-compulsive disorder.", 
    "41": "Pirenzepine, a potent antimuscarinic agent with apparent selectivity for a subtype (M1) of muscarinic receptors, was used in tritiated form to characterize its binding to human brain tissue. Specific [3H]pirenzepine binding showed rapid association and dissociation. From kinetic and competitive binding experiments, its KD was 5.5 nM and 9 nM, respectively. Regional distribution of [3H]pirenzepine binding determined in parallel with [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding, a nonselective muscarinic antagonist, indicated a significant correlation for the maximum number of binding sites for the two radioligands in 13 brain regions, with the highest amount of binding for each in the putamen and the least in the cerebellum. Binding for [3H]pirenzepine averaged 57% of that for [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate, with a range of 20% (cerebellum) to 77% (frontal cortex). Most antidepressants and neuroleptics tested had affinities for [3H]pirenzepine binding sites that were not significantly different from their previously reported values obtained with the use of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate.", 
    "42": "A specific ligand for peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors, Ro5-4864, was synthesised and labelled with 11C for use in positron emission tomography (PET). Four patients with suspected glioma, two patients with high grade astrocytoma and two with low grade astrocytoma, as well as one patient with meningioma were examined with PET after the administration of 200 MBq 11C-Ro5-4864. The images as well as kinetic analyses revealed lower uptake of the ligand in tumor as compared with cortical tissue. Markedly elevated uptake in the thalamus suggests a functional role of the ligand.",

Responses of single motoneurones to thermal and mechanical stimuli were reduced to a similar degree by both mu and kappa agonists and these effects were reversed by low doses of naloxone.", 
    "44": "Circadian rhythms were measured in alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic, acetylcholine muscarinic (ACh), and benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor binding in small regions of rat brain. Rhythms in alpha 1-receptor binding were measured in olfactory bulb, frontal, cingulate, piriform, parietal, temporal and occipital cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus, pons-medulla, caudate-putamen and thalamus-septum. No rhythm was found in cerebellum. Rhythms in alpha 2-receptor binding were measured in frontal, parietal and temporal cortex, and pons-medulla. No rhythm was found in cingulate, piriform or occipital cortex, or hypothalamus. Rhythms in binding to beta-receptors were measured in olfactory bulb, piriform, insular, parietal and temporal cortex, hypothalamus and cerebellum. No rhythms were found in frontal, entorhinal, cingulate, or occipital cortex, hippocampus, caudate-putamen, or pons-medulla. Rhythms in ACh receptor binding were measured in olfactory bulb, parietal cortex and caudate-putamen. No rhythms were found in frontal or occipital cortex, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, thalamus-septum, pons-medulla or cerebellum. Rhythms in BDZ receptor binding were measured in olfactory bulb, olfactory and occipital cortex, olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, caudate-putamen, hippocampus and cerebellum. No rhythms were found in parietal cortex, pons-medulla or thalamus-septum. The 24-hr mean binding to receptors varied between 3- and 10-fold, the highest in cortex and the lowest, usually, in cerebellum. The piriform cortex was particularly high in alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors; the nucleus accumbens and caudate, in ACh receptors; and the amygdala, in BDZ receptors. Most adrenergic and ACh receptor rhythms peaked in subjective night (the period when lights were off under L:D conditions), whereas most BDZ receptor rhythms peaked in subjective day (the time lights were on in L:D). Perhaps in the rat, a nocturnal animal, the adrenergic and ACh receptors mediate activity and the functions that accompany it, and the BDZ receptors mediate rest, and with it, sleep.", 
    "45": "Pirenzepine is a newly developed anticholinergic drug that reduces gastric acid secretion and is therefore used in Europe and Japan to treat patients with peptic ulcer. The inhibitory effect of pirenzepine on pancreatic exocrine function and its reversibility were studied in the isolated pancreatic acini and the isolated perfused pancreas of rats. In the isolated acini, pirenzepine caused a concentration-dependent rightward shift in the dose-response curve for carbamylcholine-stimulated amylase secretion without altering the maximal increase. Addition of 10 microM pirenzepine at the beginning as well as after 10 or 20 min of stimulation with 1 microM carbamylcholine rapidly abolished pancreatic secretions in both the isolated acini and isolated perfused pancreas. The inhibitory effect of pirenzepine was fully reversible in the isolated acini, whereas pirenzepine caused a small residual inhibition on pancreatic exocrine secretion in the isolated perfused pancreas. These results suggest the existence of pirenzepine-sensitive receptors in the pancreatic vagal pathway at a site remote from the acinar cell. The present data indicate that pirenzepine may have an influence on pancreatic exocrine function by inhibiting not only acinar cell cholinergic receptor but also endogenous cholinergic activity of the pancreas when a large dose is given.", 
    "46": "Subchronic (6 days) but not acute injections of nicotine (0.4 mg/kg SC) increased spontaneous activity (P less than 0.01) in an elevated X-maze composed of two open and two enclosed runways. Neither acute nor subchronic nicotine altered significantly the ratio of open:enclosed runway entries (O/E ratio). Diazepam (5 mg/kg PO) had no significant effects on spontaneous activity but increased the O/E ratio (P less than 0.05). Acute nicotine increased (P less than 0.01) whereas subchronic nicotine caused a small decrease (P less than 0.05) in the plasma corticosterone concentration. Both acute and subchronic diazepam decreased the levels of the hormone (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05, respectively) although the reduction elicited by chronic diazepam was less than that caused by acute diazepam (P less than 0.05). In the experiments with diazepam the plasma corticosterone concentration correlated negatively with the O/E ratio (r = -0.58; P less than 0.05), whereas in the experiments with nicotine plasma corticosterone correlated negatively (r = -0.46; P less than 0.05) with enclosed runway entries. Nicotine injections were associated with a regionally-selective reduction in the 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) concentration in the hippocampus (P less than 0.05) and a reduction in hippocampal 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) which approached statistical significance. Chronic, but not acute, diazepam increased (P less than 0.01) hypothalamic 5-HT. The changes in 5-HT and 5-HIAA did not appear to be directly related to the behavioural or adrenocortical responses to either of the drugs.",

    "48": "Established social groups of talapoin monkeys show rank-related differences in aggressive, social and sexual behaviours and visual monitoring, as well as in endocrine and monoamine profiles. Here we describe the effects on these variables of an \"anxiogenic drug\", beta-carboline carboxylic acid ethyl ester (beta-CCE), and an anxiolytic drug (midazolam) given to either dominant or subordinate male talapoins. In dominant animals beta-CCE increased aggression and visual monitoring but reduced sexual behaviour. Treatment of subordinate animals with beta-CCE served only to increase visual monitoring. Conversely, treatment with a non-sedative acute dose of midazolam in dominants reduced aggressive behaviour and increased sexual behaviour, whereas in subordinates no behavioural changes were noted. Significant effects on endocrine and neurochemical variables were not seen with the acute drug treatments employed. Nevertheless, the results show that drugs which modulate anxiety produce status-dependent behavioural effects.", 
    "49": "Administration of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) (5 mg/kg) decreased plasma corticosterone (CS) levels of mice exposed to noise stress and increased CS levels in nonstressed mice (20 and 40 mg/kg). The increase in CS may be related to an observed decrease in locomotor activity. Quipazine (0.5 mg/kg), a serotonergic agonist, failed to alter CS levels in animals without prior drug treatment and attenuated the rise in CS of nonstressed mice. These results contradicted a possible serotonergic facilitatory effect on CS regulation. Administration of apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg) or clonidine (0.1 mg/kg) prevented the significant reduction of CS levels in stressed mice treated with low doses of CDP. Apomorphine, alone, increased CS of nonstressed mice to levels approximating those of vehicle-treated stressed mice. Thus, a norepinephrine inhibitory effect was not evident and possible dopaminergic involvement in CS response regulation was suggested. It seemed likely that the effect of CDP on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system was dependent upon the endocrine state of the animal. Mice exposed to stress and exhibiting higher levels of CS were affected differently by CDP treatment than their nonstressed counterparts.", 
    "50": "The effect of buspirone on neurotransmitter systems in rat hippocampus has been evaluated in vitro and in vivo. In vitro buspirone does not affect the specific binding of 3H-flunitrazepam, 3H-GABA, 3H-dexetimide, but displaces 3H-5HT binding with nanomolar affinity. Oral administration of buspirone does not modify the hippocampal concentrations of GABA, acetylcholine, choline and of 3H-flunitrazepam specifically bound in vivo, but results in a dose-dependent reduction of 5HIAA and noradrenaline concentrations. While the effect on noradrenaline is also obtained in striatum of buspirone-treated animals, the effect on 5HIAA shows a regional specificity. The in vitro and in vivo data suggest that buspirone specifically activates 5HT neurons in hippocampus, and are compared with those obtained with diazepam.", 
    "51": "Chronic administration of the benzodiazepine clonazepam increased the number of [3H]5-HT (5-HT1) and [3H]SPIP (5-HT2) binding sites in rat frontal cortex. In each instance, binding changes reflected increases in the maximum densities of binding sites (Bmax) with no change in ligand affinities (KD). Increases in binding required continued clonazepam exposure (10 days) at high doses. [3H]5-HT binding was significantly elevated at daily dose levels (i.p.) of 5.0 mg/kg but not 2.5 mg/kg. [3H]SPIP binding was significantly increased at drug doses of 2.5 mg/kg but not 1.0 mg/kg. Binding changes were regional in that they occurred in membranes from frontal cortex but not brainstem. A second benzodiazepine, diazepam, did not affect either binding site at daily doses of 30 mg/kg. These data suggest that serotonin receptor changes seen after chronic clonazepam may occur as a compensatory response to decreases in the presynaptic release of serotonin.", 
    "52": "Clonazepam is a potent anticonvulsant 1,4-benzodiazepine that controls some types of myoclonus. Its primary mode of action is to facilitate GABAergic transmission in the brain by a direct effect on benzodiazepine receptors. GABA receptors lie on the cell bodies of dorsal raphe neurons, and GABA acts to inhibit raphe cell firing, an action potentiated by benzodiazepines. Clonazepam does not alter 5-HT synthesis but decreases 5-HT utilization in brain and blocks the egress of 5-HIAA from the brain. It is not known whether the actions of clonazepam in altering 5-HT function are responsible for its antimyoclonic action, since these are observed only after large doses. Also, the effects of clonazepam are the exact opposite of those predicted from the beneficial effects of 5-HTP in human myoclonic disorders. Finally, why clonazepam, more than other benzodiazepines, is of benefit in the treatment of myoclonus is not clear. This may be due to some pharmacokinetic feature of the drug in conjunction with its potency at benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "53": "p,p'-DDT-induced myoclonus in mice has been proposed as a model of stimulus-sensitive action myoclonus responsive to L-5-HTP and clonazepam treatment. However, we have been unable to confirm the ability of clonazepam to reduce myoclonus induced by p,p'-DDT in the rat. A detailed pharmacological, biochemical, and physiological investigation in the latter species shows p,p'-DDT-induced myoclonus not to resemble stimulus-sensitive action myoclonus occurring in humans. Precursors of 5-HT (L-tryptophan and L-5-HTP) reduced the intensity of myoclonus, but the 5-HT agonists quipazine and Org 6582 did not. 5-HT antagonists (methergoline, methysergide, and cinanserin) did not potentiate myoclonus induced by p,p'-DDT. In contrast, administration of MAOIs (pargyline, nialamide, and tranylcypromine) markedly attenuated the myoclonus. No observable changes in cerebral 5-HT biochemical parameters occurred at the onset of myoclonus, although brain tryptophan and 5-HIAA were increased following periods of prolonged myoclonus. Electrophysiological analysis of p,p'-DDT-induced myoclonus in the rat revealed changes in EEG and EMG activity that were different from those observed in human reticular reflex myoclonus. In conclusion, in contrast to the mouse, myoclonus induced by p,p'-DDT in the rat does not appear to be a suitable model of 5-HT-sensitive action myoclonus in man.", 
    "54": "A 72-year-old woman suffered a respiratory arrest following intoxication with barbiturates. Her examination 27 months after the anoxic incident revealed involuntary jerks of trunk and limb muscles triggered by willed movements. On a regimen of 1 g L-5-HTP and 100 mg l-alpha-methyldopa hydrazine (carbidopa), action myoclonus disappeared completely. This medication had to be discontinued because of a regressive hysterical reaction. Two months later, she was found unconscious; resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful. Autopsy showed death was caused by choking on food. Coronal slices of the cerebral hemispheres and transverse section of the brainstem and cerebellum revealed no lesion. No evidence of hypoxic damage could be demonstrated in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, pallidum, subthalamus, thalamus, or other diencephalic structures. In the caudal half of the midbrain tegmentum, a marked astrocytic reaction of some duration was encountered in the lateral parts of the supratrochlearis nucleus, the lateral subnucleus of the mesencephalic gray, and the immediately adjacent cuneiform and subcuneiform nuclei. In the former nucleus, sites of presumed nerve cell disintegration were found, but the neuronal populations of this nucleus and of the other raphe nuclei were well maintained. The other brainstem structures and the cerebellum were normal. Our neuropathological findings suggest that hypoxic myoclonus (a) does not seem to be explained by demonstrable neuronal loss in motor structures, such as cerebellum, thalamus, or basal ganglia and (b) does not appear to be causally related to a detectable reduction in the serotonin-containing neurons of the brain but rather to a functional derangement of anatomically intact serotonergic pathways originating perhaps from other, as yet unidentified, damaged neuronal structures.", 
    "55": "Intra-arterially administered substance P inhibited neurally activated contractions of the circular muscle of canine small intestine in vivo (lowest effective dose approximately 10(-13) mol). Excitation of intestine required higher (10(-10) mol) doses. The inhibitory effect required functioning nerves, since tetrodotoxin treatment eliminated it. However, inhibition of neurogenic contraction by substance P was unaffected by nicotinic or opiate receptor antagonists or by catecholamine depletion but was reduced by a selective substance P antagonist. Since the inhibition by substance P was also greatly reduced by treatment with atropine or pirenzepine and acetylcholine given intra-arterially produced a similar inhibitory response, stimulation of release of acetylcholine to inhibitory muscarinic receptors on nerves appeared to be the mechanism of this action. Direct smooth muscle effects were ruled out; substance P did not inhibit contractions to intra-arterial acetylcholine or those following tetrodotoxin. In vitro in ileal strips, no inhibition by substance P of any contractile response was found. We propose that the local release of substance P into the myenteric plexus produces inhibition and suggest that this constitutes a physiological function of the neuropeptide. This action may be absent in vitro.", 
    "56": "We have previously demonstrated that the acute administration of morphine increases the level of endogenous substances, which have antinociceptive activity, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The present study was conducted to determine whether other opioid analgesics exert a similar effect. CSF was withdrawn from the cisterna magna of anesthetized rabbits before and after s.c. injections of meperidine, pentazocine, levorphanol and methadone, and was bioassayed for opioid-like activity in the mouse tail-flick and phenylquinone writhing tests. The opioid-like activity of CSF taken 60 min after meperidine (50 mg/kg) was significantly increased in both bioassays, and the CSF level of meperidine was insufficient to account for this effect. Pentazocine (25-75 mg/kg) also significantly increased opioid-like activity in rabbit CSF, but the effects of methadone (5-10 mg/kg) and levorphanol (20 mg/kg) were less marked. Dextrorphan (20 mg/kg), diazepam (10 mg/kg) and pentobarbital (20 mg/kg) administration did not significantly increase opioid-like activity in CSF. It is concluded that the antinociceptive action of some opioid analgesics in rabbits may be mediated in part by the release of endogenous antinociceptive substances.", 
    "57": "The effects of 2-chloroadenosine, aminophylline, bicuculline, beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid methylester and Ro 15-1788 on seizures produced by pilocarpine were examined in rats. In animals pretreated with aminophylline at doses of 25-100 mg/kg, non-convulsant dose of pilocarpine, 100 mg/kg, resulted in severe motor limbic seizures, which rapidly developed into the status epilepticus. Electroencephalographic monitoring showed progressive evolution of seizure activity with initial high-voltage fast activity followed by high-voltage spiking and electrographic seizures. Morphological analysis of frontal forebrain sections with light microscopy demonstrated widespread damage to the hippocampal formation, thalamus, amygdala, olfactory cortex, substantia nigra and neocortex. Bicuculline, 2 mg/kg, beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid methylester, 5 mg/kg, and Ro 15-1788, 50 mg/kg, did not augment seizures produced by pilocarpine, 100 mg/kg. 2-Chloroadenosine, 5 and 10 mg/kg, blocked the appearance of behavioral and electrographic seizures produced by pilocarpine, 380 mg/kg, and prevented the occurrence of brain damage. The results indicate that purinergic mechanisms are involved in the buildup of pilocarpine-induced convulsions and seizure-related brain damage in rats.", 
    "58": "One-hour immobilization stress increased levels of the major metabolite of brain noradrenaline (NA), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl-ethyleneglycol sulfate (MHPG-SO4), in nine brain regions of rats. Diazepam at 5 mg/kg attenuated the stress-induced increases in MHPG-SO4 levels in the hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, cerebral cortex and locus coeruleus (LC) region, but not in the thalamus, pons plus medulla oblongata excluding the LC region and basal ganglia. The attenuating effects of the drug on stress-induced increases in metabolite levels in the above regions were completely antagonized by pretreatment with Ro 15-1788 at 5 or 10 mg/kg, a potent and specific benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor antagonist. When given alone, Ro 15-1788 did not affect the increases in MHPG-SO4 levels. Behavioral changes observed during immobilization stress such as vocalization and defecation, were also attenuated by diazepam at 5 mg/kg and this action of diazepam was antagonized by Ro 15-1788 at 10 mg/kg, which by itself had no effects on these behavioral measurements. These findings suggest: (1) that diazepam acts via BDZ receptors to attenuate stress-induced increases in NA turnover selectively in the hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, cerebral cortex and LC region and (2) that this decreased noradrenergic activity might be closely related to relief of distress-evoked hyperemotionality, i.e., fear and/or anxiety in animals.", 
    "59": "The intravenous administration of relatively low doses of ethanol (0.25-2.00 g/kg) produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the firing rate of the neurons located in the substantia nigra, pars reticulata (PR neurons). This effect was eliminated both by picrotoxin and bicuculline, two blockers of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission, and potentiated by muscimol (a direct GABA agonist) and diazepam (a representative of the benzodiazepine class which facilitate GABA transmission). The specific benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788, blocked the potentiating effect of diazepam on the ethanol effect but failed to antagonize ethanol-induced inhibition of the firing rate of the neurons. These results indicate that ethanol might inhibit the firing of PR neurons through a GABAergic mechanism. Moreover, since PR neurons are thought to exert an inhibitory control on nigral dopaminergic neurons, it is suggested that the depression of the activity of such inhibitory interneurons may be responsible for ethanol-induced stimulation of dopaminergic activity.",

    "61": "One- and two-dimensional 400-MHz proton NMR experiments are used to examine the solution structure of the covalent adduct formed by the interaction of anthramycin methyl ether with the self-complementary deoxyoligonucleotide d(ATGCAT)2. The concentration dependence of chemical shifts and nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) experiments are utilized to assign the adenine H2 protons within the minor groove for both free d(ATGCAT)2 and the adduct. These studies demonstrate that one of the four adenine H2 protons is in close proximity to the bound anthramycin and this results in its upfield shift of 0.3 ppm compared to the adenine H2 protons of the free duplex. Effects of the covalent attachment of anthramycin to the d(ATGCAT)2 duplex result in an increased shielding of selected deoxyribose protons located within the minor groove of the adduct, as demonstrated by two-dimensional autocorrelated (COSY) NMR techniques. Interactions between the protons of the covalently attached anthramycin and the d(ATGCAT)2 duplex are determined by utilizing two-dimensional NOE (NOESY) techniques. Analysis of these data reveals NOE cross-peaks between the anthramycin methyl, H6, and H7 protons with specific deoxyoligonucleotide protons within the minor groove, thus allowing the orientation of the drug within the minor groove to be determined. Nonselective inversion recovery (T1) relaxation experiments are used to probe the structural and dynamic properties of the anthramycin-d(ATGCAT)2 adduct. These data suggest that the binding of anthramycin alters the correlation time of the d(ATGCAT)2 duplex and stabilizes both of the internal A X T base pairs with respect to solvent exchange.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

CL 218872, Ro 5-4864, phenytoine, progabide, propranolol, yohimbine and various CNS stimulants predominantly induced vehicle-appropriate responding. Chlordiazepoxide, pentobarbital, CL 218 872, PK 8165, pentylenetetrazol, CGS 8216 and beta-CCM failed to block the Ro 15-1788 cue.

    "63": "All E1 mice provoked by postural stimulation since the age of 4 weeks had convulsions between 22 and 24 weeks of age, the refractory period ranging from 20 to 30 min. As compared to ddY mice, the maximal number of high-affinity [3H]muscimol binding sites was larger and the affinity was lower in the brains of the E1 mice, which had or had not experienced repeated seizures caused by postural stimuli. The basal and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-stimulated [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites, and GABA concentration in the brains of the E1 mice did not differ from those of the ddY mice. In E1 mice following provoked convulsions, there were no temporary changes in [3H]muscimol binding, or [3H]flunitrazepam binding with or without exogenous GABA stimulation. The GABA concentration in the brains of the E1 mice increased immediately after seizures, and returned to the control values within 60 min.", 
    "64": "Electrophysiological and pharmacological studies have shown that peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors modulate voltage-sensitive calcium channels in the heart. We have compared these binding sites with binding sites for [3H]dihydropyridines, which are believed to label such channels. Although no direct or allosteric interaction could be demonstrated between the two sites, their subcellular distribution--sarcolemma and ryanodine-sensitive sarcoplasmic reticulum--was parallel. Size determination of the two sites suggests that the receptors for these two classes of compounds are separate molecules packaged in the same membrane compartment.", 
    "65": "The effect of acute and long term administration of diazepam upon local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) in discrete regions of the central nervous system of the rat was studied by means of a quantitative autoradiographic [14C]2-deoxy-D-glucose technique. A single injection of diazepam (1.0 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg i.v.) reduced LCGU up to 30% in particular brain areas, such as the lateral and ventral thalamic nuclei, the medial geniculate body and the mamillary body, whereas the activity in many other structures was not significantly altered. That the effects may be mediated via specific benzodiazepine receptors was indicated by the ability of the selective benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 (imidazobenzodiazepine) to attenuate these actions. Rats treated chronically with diazepam (20 mg/kg day for a period of 14 days) still displayed slight reductions of LCGU in certain areas affected acutely such as the lateral thalamic nucleus. In contrast to its effects in rats chronically treated with vehicle, an acute diazepam injection failed to significantly modify LCGU in rats chronically treated with diazepam. Furthermore, in chronic diazepam-treated animals Ro 15-1788 produced an increase of LCGU to values above control levels in those brain regions in which a decrement was seen upon acute diazepam administration to naive rats. These findings indicate an adaptation to and a possible development of physical dependence upon chronic drug treatment.", 
    "66": "Chlordiazepoxide pretreatment decreased basal levels of plasma arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and attenuated picrotoxin-induced increases in plasma AVP and blood pressure compared to saline-pretreated spinal animals. Prior administration of RO 15-1788 blocked the effects of chlordiazepoxide on basal plasma AVP as well as picrotoxin-evoked changes in plasma AVP and blood pressure. Thus, interactions at the benzodiazepine receptor may influence basal and evoked changes in plasma AVP concentration.", 
    "67": "A monoclonal antibody capable of inhibiting opioid binding to rat neural membranes has been produced. Spleen cells from a BALB/c mouse, immunized with a partially purified opioid receptor complex, were fused with P3-X63.Ag8.653.3 myeloma cells. The cell line OR-689.2.4 secreted an IgM that was capable of partially inhibiting opioid binding to rat neural membranes under equilibrium binding conditions, while not affecting the binding of nonopioid ligands. Control mouse immunoglobulins and heat-denatured OR-689.2.4 did not inhibit opioid binding to membranes. The purified immunoglobulin inhibited the binding of [3H]dihydromorphine in a titrable, saturable, and reversible manner, as well as the binding of the delta-ligand [3H][D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin, the kappa-ligand [3H] ethylketocyclazocine, and 3H-labeled antagonists. In addition to blocking the binding of opioids to membranes, the immunoglobulin could also displace bound [3H]dihydromorphine from neural membranes. The 125I-labeled immunoglobulin specifically bound to neural membranes with a Kd of 1.3 nM and a maximal number of binding sites of 41.8 fmol/0.25 mg of membrane protein. In a titrable manner, the immunoglobulin precipitated opioid binding sites from a solubilized preparation of neural membranes. When OR-689.2.4 conjugated to Sepharose was incubated with the partially purified opioid receptor complex, labeled with 125I, a 35,000-dalton protein was specifically bound by the immunoglobulin. This antibody provides a tool for probing the multiple opioid binding sites.", 
    "68": "The response to narcotics, sedatives, hypnotics, antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs is modified in elderly patients. The effects of these drugs are enhanced, and dosage reduction is required. This phenomenon is gradual and occurs before any sign of senile dementia. The choice of a drug within a therapeutic class may depend on the severity of adverse reactions, some of which are particularly disturbing in elderly patients.", 
    "69": "Compounds have been reported that act on the benzodiazepine receptor as full agonists (diazepam and CL218872), full antagonists (CGS8216 and RO15-1788), on partial agonists (CGS9896). We examined the effect of these compounds on [3H]GABA binding to membrane fragments from rat brain. Incubations were performed at 37 degrees C in a buffer containing EGTA to reduce free calcium ion levels. Centrifugation was then used to separate bound from free [3H]GABA. Diazepam caused a 20-45% enhancement of [3H]GABA binding and this effect was inhibited by 5 mM CaCl2. The magnitude of the enhancement of [3H]GABA by CL218872 was similar to that of diazepam. In contrast, the benzodiazepine antagonists, RO15-1788 and CGS8216 caused little enhancement of [3H]GABA binding. Finally, the partial agonist CGS9896 was distinguishable from both the benzodiazepine antagonists and full agonists by an intermediate level of enhancement of [3H]GABA binding. The extent of enhancement of [3H]GABA binding appears to be predictive of the pharmacological efficacy of compounds acting at the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "70": "TVX Q 7821 is a putative non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic which has a high affinity to 5-HT1 receptors. In this study some of the binding characteristics of the radiolabeled drug using rat brain cryostat sections and the autoradiographic localization of binding sites using the LKB-Ultrofilm technique have been investigated. Parallel experiments have been performed using [3H]serotonin ( [3H]5-HT). Both [3H]TVX Q 7821 and [3H]5-HT bound specifically and in a saturable manner to tissue sections, the Kd values being 6.8 and 3.7 nmol/l, respectively. Quantitative autoradiography using computer-assisted image analysis revealed a mean inhibition by TVX Q 7821 of [3H]5-HT binding of 56% in many brain areas. The inhibition ranged from 80% in the hippocampus and entorhinal area to practically none in the substantia nigra and the dorsal subiculum. Color coded autoradiograms obtained either with [3H]5-HT or [3H]TVX Q 7821 showed a nearly identical pattern of labeling with high receptor densities in the hippocampus, the entorhinal area, the septum, the interpeduncular nucleus and the dorsal raphe. However, in some brain areas striking differences in the intensity of labeling were found. [3H]5-HT but not [3H]TVX Q 7821 bound strongly in the substantia nigra, the dorsal subiculum and the globus pallidus. It is proposed that TVX Q 7821 binds to a subtype of 5-HT1 receptor (the so-called 5-HT1A sites as recently proposed). Thus, the putative anxiolytic TVX Q 7821 may provide a means for the study of the functional role of 5-HT1 receptors.", 
    "71": "Two patients are described who suffered severe complications after inadvertent intra-arterial administration of diazepam. The effects of intra-arterial diazepam are discussed and the prevention of this disaster is emphasized.", 
    "72": "In this study, the effect of the chronic administration of the benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor ligand FG 7142 on the rat conflict test was examined. Rats chronically treated with FG 7142 (15 mg/kg, i.p. twice a day for 10 days) had an enhanced sensitivity to punishment at 4 and 15 days after the last treatment. This 'proconflict' effect was prevented by the concurrent administration of the BZD antagonist Ro 15-1788. The hypothesis that the long-lasting proconflict effect of chronic FG 7142 administration is the consequence of a persistent down-regulation of the GABAergic transmission is discussed.", 
    "73": "Ro 5-4864, the prototype ligand of the peripheral benzodiazepine binding site caused a decrease of the action potential duration in isolated guinea-pig cardiac myocytes. Voltage-clamp experiments showed that, at concentrations below 3 X 10(-6) M, Ro 5-4864 caused a parallel outward shift of the membrane current elicited by depolarization to + 10 mV from a holding potential of -50 mV. The peak inward Ca2+ current (ICa) and the inwardly rectifying K+ current were not affected. ICa was reduced by Ro 5-4864 at concentrations above 3 X 10(-6) M. At these concentrations, Ro 5-4864 also caused a negative inotropic effect in isolated guinea-pig papillary muscles, reduced K+ depolarization-induced contractures of the isolated rat aorta and inhibited [3H]nitrendipine binding to guinea-pig cardiac membranes. These data provide no evidence that the peripheral high affinity benzodiazepine binding site is coupled to the cardiac Ca2+ channel. The possibility cannot be excluded that a postulated micromolar affinity benzodiazepine receptor is associated with the Ca2+ channel.", 
    "74": "Adult Binghamton Heterogeneous (HET) stock mice were administered one of three doses of diazepam (0.1, 2.5, or 5.0 mg/kg) immediately followed by a second injection of either the slow calcium channel blocker, nimodipine (Bay e 9736), or its vehicle. Hypothermic responses and muscular incoordination were measured twenty and sixty minutes later as assessed by changes in rectal temperature and motoric activity on a rotating rod. Nimodipine (5 mg/kg) alone did not significantly affect body temperature or motor coordination. However, when administered in combination with the two highest doses of diazepam, nimodipine significantly potentiated the hypothermic response produced by these doses both twenty minutes and sixty minutes post-injection. Administration of high doses of diazepam (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg) resulted in significant motor incoordination at both observation periods, but this effect was not potentiated by nimodipine.", 
    "75": "Dogs were treated with clonazepam, 0.5 mg/kg orally, b.i.d., for 3-6 weeks. The development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effect was followed by weekly determinations of the convulsive threshold by infusion of pentetrazole, 10 min after i.v. injection of 0.1 mg/kg clonazepam. In all 6 dogs tolerance was apparent after 1-2 weeks of treatment; in 1 dog the anticonvulsant effect had been totally lost after 3 weeks of treatment. Tolerance is regarded to be \"functional\" since the elimination half-life of clonazepam increased considerably with the duration of the treatment. One day after withdrawal of clonazepam the convulsive threshold had fallen below the control value in all dogs, but 1 week later it had recovered to the control level. Other signs of physical dependence after withdrawal were hyperthermia in 2 dogs as well as anorexia with weight loss in 5 out of the 6 dogs. In anesthetized dogs, relaxed by suxamethonium and ventilated, the effect of repeated injections of clonazepam on the EEG spiking activity maintained by an infusion of pentetrazole was studied; there was no indication for the development of acute tolerance."
