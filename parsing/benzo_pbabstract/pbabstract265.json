    "2": "159 drivers (19%) were considered as not impaired and 659 (81%) as impaired. None of the background factors, e.g. gender, age or time of day when apprehended, related significantly to either the physician's conclusion or to blood levels of benzodiazepines. Impaired subjects had significantly higher blood levels of diazepam (n=411) (P<0.001), oxazepam (n=73) (P<0.05) and flunitrazepam (n=211) (P<0.05) than those not impaired. The risk of being assessed as impaired did rise with increasing benzodiazepine blood level, with odds ratios (ORs) for being assessed as impaired of 1.61, 3.65 and 4.11 for the three supratherapeutic drug levels. The corresponding OR found for different elevated blood-alcohol concentrations were 1.49, 2.94 and 10.49.",

    "6": "Eighty-four methadone-related deaths were identified. The majority (64%) were accidental; 74% of these were caused by a combination of drug effects. Overall, benzodiazepines were present in 74% of all decedents. Thirty-six (43% of all decedents) were registered in MMT when they died. Twenty-two decedents were registered with Next Step, of whom two died in the first week of treatment. In contrast, 14 decedents were registered with the CBMP, of whom eight died in the first week of treatment. The mortality rate in MMT peaked in 1998 (7.7 per 1,000 clients treated), one year after expansion into the private sector. A range of co-existing health conditions were present among decedents including: blood-bome viruses (BBVs), chronic pain/injury, asthma, epilepsy, diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, cardiac disease, pancreatitis, gall stones, paraplegia, cerebral palsy, schizophrenia, depression, suicidal ideation and arthritis.",

Data describing the clinical history and circumstances of death were extracted from witnesses' and police statements.", 
    "11": "Methadone contributed to the deaths of 57 of the 87 adult coronial cases in which it was detected in NSW in 1994. The most commonly reported early signs of severe methadone toxicity were ataxia, slurred speech and evident euphoria. The late signs were unconsciousness, loud snoring and brown pulmonary oedema fluid coming from the mouth or nose. Death occurred an average 5.1 and 6.0 hours after oral ingestion and intravenous injection of methadone, respectively. Benzodiazepines were significantly more likely to have contributed to deaths from methadone toxicity among maintenance patients and people taking methadone tablets for pain relief than deaths involving diverted methadone syrup and deaths to which methadone did not contribute (OR 4.8, 95% 1.7 to 14.4).",

The requirement for benzodiazepines in drug use may result from dissociated tolerance to opioids. Withdrawal insomnia was shown to develop in all the cases studied. The differentiation between objective and subjective requirements for hypnotics was carried out. The author suggests the term \"hypnophilia\". The interrelation between hypnophilia and higher anxiety is emphasized. Clozapine is a drug of choice in treatment of insomnia in opioid addicts.", 
    "14": "The pyrazolopyrimidine zaleplon is a hypnotic agent that acts at the benzodiazepine recognition site of GABA(A) receptors. Zaleplon, like the hypnotic agent zolpidem but unlike classical benzodiazepines, exhibits preferential affinity for type I benzodiazepine (BZ(1)/omega(1)) receptors in binding assays. The modulatory action of zaleplon at GABA(A) receptors has now been compared with those of zolpidem and the triazolobenzodiazepine triazolam. Zaleplon potentiated GABA-evoked Cl(-) currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing human GABA(A) receptor subunits with a potency that was higher at alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors than at alpha2- or alpha3-containing receptors. Zolpidem, but not triazolam, also exhibited selectivity for alpha1-containing receptors. However, the potency of zaleplon at these various receptors was one-third to one-half that of zolpidem. Zaleplon and zolpidem also differed in their actions at receptors containing the alpha5 or gamma3 subunit. Zaleplon, zolpidem, and triazolam exhibited similar patterns of efficacy among the different receptor subtypes. The affinities of zaleplon for [(3)H]flunitrazepam or t-[(35)S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([(35)S]TBPS) binding sites in rat brain membranes were lower than those of zolpidem or triazolam. Furthermore, zaleplon, unlike zolpidem, exhibited virtually no affinity for the peripheral type of benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "15": "Drug-induced iatrogenic hallucinations and psychosis occur in about 30% of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and are the single most important precipitant for nursing home placement, which carries a grave prognosis. In addition, parkinsonism is a frequent accompaniment to the more common dementing syndromes, Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The five most recent antipsychotic drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States have been marketed as \"atypical\" antipsychotics (AA) due to their relative freedom from extrapyramidal symptoms when used in schizophrenia patients. The use of these newer antipsychotic drugs in PD and other parkinson-sensitive populations represents the most stringent test to their freedom from motor side effects. To date, clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine have been studied in parkinson-vulnerable populations. This article reviews the data and highlights the differences that these four drugs have on motor function. It also emphasizes the challenges in evaluating the available data on the motor effects of AA, especially on the non-PD elderly and cognitively impaired population. Suggestions are made for future research to improve the interpretability of these studies.", 
    "16": "This report may be the first case of perioperative management in a patient with dentato-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy (DRPLA). A 19-yr-old man with DRPLA was admitted for recurrent aspiration pneumonia. Medications included phenobarbital, carbamazepine and clonazepam. The planned surgical procedure was tracheostomy and tracheoesophageal separation. He recovered from these procedures uneventfully. Two months later, however, he was readmitted for plastic surgery of narrowing tracheostoma. All of these procedures were performed under general anesthesia, induced using propofol (or thiamylal) and vecuronium, and maintained with sevoflurane. Thiamylal, propofol and benzodiazepines were effective in the prevention of myoclonus-like seizure. No adverse effects of muscle relaxant were observed.", 
    "17": "One unique characteristic of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and LSD-like substances is the recurrence of some of the symptoms which appeared during the intoxication after the immediate effect of the hallucinogen has worn off. This recurring syndrome, mainly visual, has not been clearly understood, appreciated or distinguished from other clinical entities by clinicians. The terms Flashback and Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD) are used interchangeably in the professional literature. Flashback is a usually short-term, non-distressing, spontaneous, recurrent, reversible and benign condition accompanied by a pleasant affect. In contrast, HPPD is a generally long-term, distressing, spontaneous, recurrent, pervasive, either slowly reversible or irreversible, non-benign condition accompanied by an unpleasant dysphoric affect. Flashback and HPPD appear to be part of a vast and broad spectrum of non-psychopathological and psychopathological states reported by hallucinogen users. Pharmacological agents such as clonidine, perphenazine and clonazepan have been shown to ameliorate this syndrome in some of the individuals seeking treatment.", 
    "18": "1) To study the prevalence, course and correlates of benzodiazepine (BZD) abuse in an Israeli methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) clinic; and 2) to present preliminary results of an open clinical study on the treatment of BZD addiction in MMT patients using BZD maintenance.", 
    "19": "Study 1 was carried out on 196 patients who were in MMT for at least one year. Objective information on drug use (urine testing) was recorded, and the one-year retention rate was measured. Demographic data and history of abuse were obtained, and a self-rated psychopathology and psychological distress questionnaire was administered. The second study was an open one. Twenty BZD-addicted patients were given clonazepam maintenance treatment (CMT) and were started on a daily regimen of 6 mg. followed by a gradual tapering until an individual dose was reached. This maintenance dose was the lowest level at which the patient still expressed satisfaction with the BZD dose without reporting craving or overdose. Failure was defined by three daily consecutive BZD uses above the permitted dose.", 
    "20": "BZD abuse was significantly reduced during the first year of MMT (from 55 to 43%, P < .000), although a number of patients started to abuse BZDs during this period. BZD abusers (BAs) were found more often to be polydrug abusers, their methadone dosage was higher than non-abusers (NBAs), they started to abuse drugs in general and heroin in particular earlier than NBA, and they had higher self-rated psychopathology and psychological distress scores. The second study showed that CMT was successful in 75% of the patients over a period of six months and that it is, therefore, a promising mode of treatment for BZD-dependent MMT patients.", 
    "21": "MMT patients who abuse BZDs are at an increased risk for continuing polydrug abuse. Although our results are to be taken cautiously due to the inherent limitation of a non-controlled non-randomized pilot study, ongoing maintenance with clonazepam seems to be well tolerated and a stabilizing and satisfying pharmacotherapy for BZD dependent MMT patients.", 
    "22": "The aqueous extract of Centranthus longiflorus ssp. longiflorus (CLE) was investigated for sedative, anticonvulsant and behaviour modifying activity using thiopental sleeping, caffeine induced convulsion and forced swimming depression tests. When the effects of the aqueous extract of CLE (100 mg/kg) was compared to diazepam, it showed similar sedative and anticonvulsant effects to those produced by diazepam (5 mg/kg).", 
    "23": "Issues to consider when evaluating maintenance drug therapy for patients with schizophrenia are discussed; these include potential adverse effects of antipsychotic therapy, such as weight gain, diabetes mellitus, extrapyramidal symptoms, sexual dysfunction, cognitive dysfunction, and cardiac effects, as well as quality of life. Patients with schizophrenia are more likely to be overweight than the general population. Olanzapine and clozapine have been associated with the greatest weight gain of the newer antipsychotics. While patients with schizophrenia are at increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus independent of antipsychotic therapy, diabetes may be more prevalent in patients taking the newer agents. Acute extrapyramidal symptoms occur in 75-90% of patients receiving first-generation antipsychotics like thioridazine and haloperidol. The probability of tardive dyskinesia (TD) occurring with second- and third-generation agents is less than 1% per year, compared with about 5% per year for the traditional antipsychotics. When patients are switched from a traditional antipsychotic to clozapine or olanzapine, TDs usually abate somewhat. Thioridazine causes a pronounced prolongation of the QTc interval, which can lead to ventricular arrhythmias. The slight increase in QTc interval caused by ziprasidone most likely will not be a problem in healthy individuals. Newer antipsychotics are associated with improved neurocognitive functioning and most cause less prolactin elevation, compared with traditional agents. The newer antipsychotic agents are not devoid of adverse effects, but those that do occur can be managed. Once issues related to adherence are resolved, rehabilitation of patients with schizophrenia will be a high priority.", 
    "24": "The safety and efficacy of i.m. ziprasidone and olanzapine for treating acute agitation in patients with schizophrenia are described, along with factors to consider when evaluating the cost-effectiveness of these agents. Agitation is defined as excessive motor and verbal activity. Acute agitation has traditionally been treated with the combination of haloperidol 5 mg and lorazepam 2 mg i.m. Controlled trials have shown, however, that combination therapy of haloperidol or droperidol plus lorazepam i.m. is better than single-drug treatment at one hour but not earlier. Phase II and III clinical trials showed that both i.m. ziprasidone mesylate 10 mg and 20 mg and olanzapine 2.5 mg-10 mg controlled agitation faster in patients with schizophrenia than p.o. ziprasidone 2 mg and placebo. In addition, i.m. olanzapine 10 mg controlled agitation faster in patients with schizophrenia faster than haloperidol in 15 minutes. Olanzapine i.m. was also superior to placebo in patients with dementia and in patients with bipolar disorder with and without psychotic symptoms, suggesting that agitation may be a syndrome that is similar across a multitude of disease states. Dystonic reactions occurred in 2.6% of patients taking ziprasidone, compared with 9.2% of patients taking haloperidol. No patients receiving olanzapine experienced a dystonic reaction. Ziprasidone has been associated with prolonged QTc Intervals. Pharmaco-economic evaluations should include costs associated with repeat i.m. injections for agitated patients, increased time in the emergency room, case of switching from i.m. to oral therapy, adverse effects, and relapse, as well as medication costs. I.m. olanzapine and ziprasidone show promise for treating acute agitation in patients with schizophrenia, especially because of their safer adverse effect profile and faster onset of effectiveness compared with haloperidol.", 
    "25": "The ability of clonazepam and zolpidem to displace [3H]flumazenil binding was measured in the human hippocampal formation, frontal cortex (BA9) and the cerebellum using in situ radioligand binding and autoradiography. The use of high resolution phosphorimaging in all regions indicated the displacement of [3H]flumazenil by clonazepam was monophasic with K(i) values ranging from 2.73+/-0.17 to 6.49+/-0.21 nM. [3H]flumazenil binding that was not displaced by clonazepam ranged from 3.39+/-0.86 to 7.15+/-1.11%. The ability of zolpidem to displace [3H]flumazenil was also monophasic in the frontal cortex and cerebellum with K(i) values of 37.53+/-1.79 and 31.80+/-1.68 nM, respectively. In contrast, within all hippocampal regions, zolpidem displacement of [3H]flumazenil was biphasic, with K(i) values for the high affinity site ranging from 0.13+/-0.04 to 0.54+/-0.03 nM, whereas the low affinity site was between 84.98+/-1.58 and 98.84+/-1.89 nM. In addition, zolpidem insensitive [3H]flumazenil binding was observed to vary markedly between brain regions, ranging between 37.85+/-1.60 and 6.13+/-0.83%. In conclusion, the present results indicate that in situ radioligand binding and high-resolution phosphorimaging techniques can be utilized to measure the differential displacement of [3H]flumazenil by zolpidem and clonazepam. Moreover, our data suggests that the differential distribution of the zolpidem insensitive component of [3H]flumazenil binding is an indicator of GABA/BZ receptors assembled by different subunits within the human brain.", 
    "26": "Recent publications defined requirements for inter-subunit contacts in a benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R alpha 1 beta 3 gamma 2). There is strong evidence that the heteropentameric receptor contains two alpha 1, two beta 3, and one gamma 2 subunit. However, the available data do not distinguish two possibilities: When viewed clockwise from an extracellular viewpoint the subunits could be arranged in either gamma 2 beta 3 alpha 1 beta 3 alpha 1 or gamma 2 alpha 1 beta 3 alpha 1 beta 3 configurations. Here we use molecular modeling to thread the relevant GABA(A)R subunit sequences onto a template of homopentameric subunits in the crystal structure of the acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP). The GABA(A) sequences are known to have 15-18% identity with the acetylcholine binding protein and nearly all residues that are conserved within the nAChR family are present in AChBP. The correctly aligned GABA(A) sequences were threaded onto the AChBP template in the gamma 2 beta 3 alpha 1 beta 3 alpha 1 or gamma 2 alpha 1 beta 3 alpha 1 beta 3 arrangements. Only the gamma 2 alpha 1 beta 3 alpha 1 beta 3 arrangement satisfied three known criteria: (1) alpha 1 His(102) binds at the gamma 2 subunit interface in proximity to gamma 2 residues Thr(142), Phe(77), and Met(130); (2) alpha 1 residues 80-100 bind near gamma 2 residues 91-104; and (3) alpha 1 residues 58-67 bind near the beta 3 subunit interface. In addition to predicting the most likely inter-subunit arrangement, the model predicts which residues form the GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "27": "The inability to delay gratification (reinforcement or reward) is one index of impulsive behavior. In order to measure the willingness of pigeons to delay reinforcement, an adjustable delay schedule was developed that allowed daily approximations of an indifference point between immediate brief access to reinforcer and delayed, longer access to reinforcer. Acute administration of the anxiolytic alprazolam (5 mg/kg) decreased the length of delay tolerated before a larger reinforcement. Likewise, acute administration of the anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg) produced a similar, although not significant, effect. Neither acute nor five daily injections of 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT(1A) agonist, or WAY100635, a 5-HT(1A) antagonist, affected the length of the delay period. Chronic (17 day), but not acute injections of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine (10 mg/kg), citalopram (10 mg/kg) and paroxetine (3 mg/kg) increased the delay period. When given in addition to 1 mg/kg of 8-OH-DPAT, but not 1 mg/kg WAY100635, the effect of fluoxetine was accelerated in that the increase in delay was observed earlier in the treatment. These data support the use of SSRIs to decrease impulsive behavior. Addition of a 5-HT(1A) agonist, but not a 5-HT(1A) antagonist, to the SSRI may hasten the therapeutic activity of the SSRI in treating impulsivity.", 
    "28": "5-HT(1A) receptor knockout (KO) mice have been described as more anxious in various anxiety paradigms. Because anxiety is often associated with autonomic changes like elevated body temperature and tachycardia, radiotelemetry was used to study these parameters in wild type (WT) and KO mice in stress-/anxiety-related paradigms. Basal body temperature (BT), heart rate (HR), and their diurnal rhythmicity did not differ between well-adapted WT and KO mice. In a simple stress-test, the Stress-induced Hyperthermia (SIH), injection-stress resulted in an exaggerated stress-response in KO mice. Furthermore, the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist flesinoxan dose-dependently antagonized SIH and stress-induced tachycardia in WT, but not in KO, mice. In both genotypes, diazepam blocked SIH, but not stress-induced tachycardia. Finally, KO mice displayed an exaggerated stress response in HR and BT to novelty stress; this was supported by behavioral indications of enhanced anxiety. The present findings show that 5-HT(1A) receptor KO mice display a more \"anxious-like\" phenotype not only at a behavioral, but also at autonomic levels.", 
    "29": "Neurokinin NK1 receptor antagonists may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of anxiety and depression. Species variants in the NK1 receptor result in reduced affinity of NK1 receptor antagonists at rat and mouse NK1 receptors, making it difficult to test NK1 antagonists in traditional preclinical models of anxiety and depression. Gerbil NK1 receptors are similar in homology to the human NK1 receptor. In a companion article, we described the anxiety-like behavioral profile of gerbils on an adapted elevated plus-maze, and the ability of anxiolytic drugs to produce anti-anxiety effects in the gerbil elevated plus-maze. The aim of the present study was to determine whether oral (p.o.) administration of the NK1 receptor antagonists MK-869, L-742,694, L-733,060, CP-99,994, and CP-122,721 produced anxiolytic-like effects in the gerbil elevated plus-maze. Upon testing, all five NK1 antagonists produced anxiolytic-like effects. MK-869 (0.01-3 mg/kg) was the most potent NK1 antagonist, producing anxiolytic-like effects on percentage of open arm time, percentage of open arm entries, stretch-attend postures, and head dips at 0.03-0.3 mg/kg doses. L-742,694 (1-30 mg/kg) and L-733,060 (1-10 mg/kg) produced anxiolytic-like effects on percentage of open arm time and stretch-attend postures at 3-10 mg/kg doses. CP-99,994 (3-30 mg/kg) only produced an anxiolytic-like effect on stretch-attend postures. CP-122,721 (3-30 mg/kg) produced an anxiolytic-like effect on percentage of open arm time at 30 mg/kg. The order of potency of the NK1 antagonists to increase percentage of open arm time was very similar to their potency to block NK1 agonist-induced foot-tapping. These studies demonstrate that neurokinin NK1 receptor antagonists produce anxiolytic-like effects in a novel gerbil elevated plus-maze, and suggest that this is an appropriate model to test NK1 antagonists for preclinical anxiolytic activity.",

    "31": "Retrospective chart reviews were conducted at two large public psychiatry units situated in inner city general hospitals. Pro re nata medication prescription, administration and outcomes were examined during inpatient episodes of care for 184 consecutive admissions of patients diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. Patient demographics, diagnoses, and regularly prescribed medication were also recorded. All admissions were drawn from a three-month period from December 1998-February 1999.", 
    "32": "The most prevalent diagnoses were schizophrenia related disorders (n = 111) and mania (n = 34). Substance use disorders (n = 49) were the most common comorbid dis-orders. Pro re nata medication was administered during the acute phase of 82% of admissions. Drugs prescribed Pro re nata were mostly typical antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and/or anti-cholinergics. Coprescription of typical antipsychotics PRN with regularly scheduled atypical antipsychotics was common (64%). Pro re nata medications accounted for 31% of the total antipsychotic dose and 28% of the total anxiolytic dose administered during acute treatment. Higher daily doses of PRN medication were given to manic patients, males, younger patients and those with substance use disorders. Pro re nata prescriptions usually specified a maximum daily dose (87%) but rarely gave indications for use (6%). Administration records frequently lacked a specified reason for use (48%) or a notation of outcome (64%). Unit staff noted medication-related morbidity in 37% of patients receiving PRN medication, compared to 3% of patients receiving only regularly scheduled medication. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were most frequently associated with administration of PRN haloperidol (Relative Risk vs other PRN medications = 5.61, 95% CI = 2.36-13.73).", 
    "33": "Pro re nata medications comprised a significant part of the treatment which psychotic patients received. The common practice of coprescribing PRN typical antipsychotics with scheduled atypical antipsychotics is potentially problematical since administration of PRN medication is associated with significant medication related morbidity. Preferential use of benzodiazepines as PRN agents may minimize this morbidity and foster subsequent compliance with regularly prescribed antipsychotics.",

The groups did not differ in the number of selected indications for using anticholinergics. For agitation, the majority of nurses viewed both benzodiazepines (56%) and antipsychotics (86%) as effective, with 60% preferring an antipsychotic. For the acute control of psychotic symptoms, 99% of nurses believed antipsychotics were effective and 58% benzodiazepines, with 87% preferring an antipsychotic. A large majority of doctors viewed both PRN benzodiazepines, 94%,and antipsychotics, 81%, as effective for agitation, and 55% preferred to use a benzodiazepine. For psychotic symptoms, 80% believed PRN antipsychotics were effective, but only 32% viewed benzodiazepines as effective, and 64% preferred to use an antipsychotic. Nursing staff identified more non-pharmacological techniques for managing both agitation and psychotic symptoms and reported using these more often than doctors. Junior staff, both nursing and medical, had less knowledge of non-pharmacological alternatives to PRN medication than senior staff.", 
    "37": "Disparities existed between doctors and nurses views on the indications for PRN medication in the acute management of psychoses, thus it is important for doctors to specify indications when writing PRN prescriptions. Despite evidence for the safety and effectiveness of benzodiazepines, there was widespread reluctance to use them as PRN medication in acute psychoses. Beliefs of some staff about PRN medications were at odds with the known properties of these medicines. Educational interventions for both nurses and doctors are required to achieve best practice in PRN medication.",

Neuroleptic compounds are not only used in cases of schizophrenia, but also in cases of severe depression with delusional symptoms. We want to present the case of a 67 year old female patient who developed haloperidol induced dyskinesea and stress unto the successful treatment of this complication with olanzapine in combination with paroxetine. Under this regime not only the improvement of the depression, but also of the tardive dyskinesea was impressive.", 
    "40": "Previous clinical trials have clearly shown the superiority of olanzapine to haloperidol in the improvement of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in schizophrenic patients. The primary purpose of this study was to compare EPS profiles in Japanese schizophrenic patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine, or a typical antipsychotic, haloperidol, as measured by the Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS). The DIEPSS, which consists of eight individual parameters and one global assessment (overall severity), was used to evaluate 182 patients enrolled in this 8-week study. The primary safety analysis was maximum change (that could be either a decrease or increase) from baseline in DIEPSS total score. Secondary analyses included change from baseline to maximum in DIEPSS total score, change from baseline to endpoint (LOCF) in DIEPSS total score, and the rank sum of the maximum change (that could be either a decrease or increase) from baseline in the DIEPSS individual items. Incidence of treatment-emergent EPS adverse events using the DIEPSS scale was also analyzed. The olanzapine group showed statistically significant superiority to the haloperidol group on the primary analysis (p<0.001). Secondary analyses also demonstrated olanzapine's superiority in DIEPSS total, parkinsonism, akathisia and overall severity scores (all p< or =0.014). Categorical analysis of treatment-emergent akathisia and parkinsonism syndromes at endpoint showed improvement in the olanzapine group but worsening in the haloperidol group. The results from this study suggest that olanzapine, as in Caucasian populations, is a safe treatment in Japanese patients chronically ill with schizophrenia.",

Novel antipsychotic drugs were significantly tolerated better, and had a positive impact on treatment-adherence, psychosocial functioning and quality of life. Among the novel drugs, risperidone was significantly better in improving negative symptoms, while olanzepine was particularly well tolerated and effective against comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms. Patients treated with quetiapine reported fewer side effects, and showed a significantly greater improvement in neurocognitive deficits.",

    "45": "We report the anticonvulsant action in DBA/2 mice of two mGlu Group III receptor agonists: (R,S)-4-phosphonophenylglycine, (R,S)-PPG, a compound with moderate mGlu8 selectivity, and of (1S,3R,4S)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid, ACPT-1, a selective agonist for mGlu4alpha receptors. Both compounds, given intracerebroventricularly at doses which did not show marked anticonvulsant activity, produced a consistent shift to the left of the dose-response curves (i.e. enhanced the anticonvulsant properties) of 1-(4'-aminophenyl)-3,5-dihydro-7,8-dimethoxy-4H-2,3-benzodiazepin-4-one hydrochloride, CFM-2, a noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist, and 3-((+/-)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-1-phosphonic acid, CPPene, a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, in DBA/2 mice. In addition, (R,S)-PPG and ACPT-1 administered intracerebroventricularly prolonged the time course of the anticonvulsant properties of CFM-2 (33 micromol/kg, i.p.) and CPPene (3.3 micromol/kg, i.p.) administered intraperitoneally. We conclude that modest reduction of synaptic glutamate release by activation of Group III metabotropic receptors potentiates the anticonvulsant effect of AMPA and NMDA receptor blockade.", 
    "46": "In the present study, we demonstrate the involvement of GABA(A) receptors in the ethanol-mediated modulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of ethanol (3.5 g), flurazepam (75 mg) or (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d] cycloheptane-5,10-iminemaleate (MK-801) (0.4 mg/kg body weight) decreased, while picrotoxin (10 mg/kg body weight) increased, the phosphorylation of ERK following 10 min of their injection. However, the picrotoxin-induced phosphorylation of ERK was inhibited by ethanol, but was not affected by MK-801. These results indicate that ethanol's inhibitory effect on ERK phosphorylation may involve the modulation of GABA(A) receptor function.",

    "48": "To compare the sedative effects of oral and rectal administration of midazolam in children undergoing dental treatment under general anaesthesia and to assess acceptance of sedative administration, acceptance of application of the facemask, and amnesia.", 
    "49": "Fifty children aged 2-7 y were randomly allocated to receive either liquid oral or rectal sedation, with 25 children in each group.", 
    "50": "The sedative effect of rectal administration was higher, but not statistically significantly, than that of oral administration (p = 0.07). No significant differences in acceptance of sedative administration, acceptance of mask application or amnesia were found between the groups.", 
    "51": "Both the oral and the rectal routes can in most cases be appropriate. However, the better sedative effect of rectal administration of midazolam makes it a more favourable route in pre-cooperative and non-compliant children.", 
    "52": "The major aim of the study was to investigate whether differences concerning acceptance of dental treatment and amnesia after rectal sedation with midazolam can be explained by temperament traits in the child. Fifty children (1.5 4.0 years), consecutively referred for dental extractions because of dental trauma or caries, were sedated with midazolam 0.3 mg kg(-1) rectally. Level of sedation (state of mind) was assessed according to Wilton before and 10 min after administration of the sedative. The children's acceptance of procedures during the oral examination, the administration of the sedative, and the dental treatment were assessed according to Holst. Acceptance of an injection of local anesthesia and tooth extraction was dichotomized as satisfactory (n = 26) or unsatisfactory (n = 24). The parent assessed temperament using the Emotionality Activity Sociability (EAS) Scale of Child Temperament. Amnesia was evaluated by the parent on the following day. The relation between temperament and outcome variables was analyzed using a multiple logistic regression analysis. Children regarded as shy by the parent were at significantly greater risk of unsatisfactory acceptance of the dental treatment (P< 0.05). High scores of negative emotionality were significantly related to less amnesia (P < 0.05). We conclude that parental ratings of their child's temperament are valuable in predicting a child's acceptance of dental treatment under sedation.", 
    "53": "An international symposium on the impact of environmental hazards, chemicals and drugs on the developing immune system of children was held in Berlin (Germany) organized by the BgVV. Epidemiological evidence indicates that an immature immune system challenged early in life by bacterial antigens may prevent, to some extent, allergic reactions including asthma bronchiale triggered by environmental pollutants. However, the prevalence for infectious disease is increased in childhood, especially when exposure to contaminants takes place in the period of pregnancy and breast-feeding. The effects of chlorinated biphenyls, dioxin, endotoxins, hexachlorobenzene, and direct and indirect in utero tobacco smoke exposure are examples. All participants recommend comparative and follow-up epidemiological studies and clinical examination of infants and children at risk during upbringing. There is ample evidence from experimental studies that indicates adverse effects on the developing immune system after in utero and postnatal exposure to chemicals and drugs. The adverse reactions of aciclovir, benzodiazepines, hexachlorobenzene, organotins (di-n-octyltin dichloride, tributyltin oxide), pesticides (methoxychlor, heptachlor) and polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) are presented and reviewed. To determine the predictive value of test data in risk assessment for neonates and children, development, differentiation and maturation of the immune system in humans and laboratory rodents is compared in their pre- and postnatal stages. Considering some differences in immunocompetence at birth and after lactation, and differences in the time frame for maturation of the immune system, reaction types are thought to be common, comparable and similar in human childhood and early adolescence and the postnatal lifetime of laboratory rodents. The participants of the symposium felt strongly that regulatory steps urgently need to be initiated to incorporate some relevant aspects into existing test guidelines for testing developmental immunotoxicity. In this context, it is recommended that animals culled otherwise in one- and two-generation studies be examined for developmental immunotoxicity according to the valid methods and parameters discussed. The majority of participants agreed that a safety factor of 10 is too low in risk assessment and management to protect a sensitive subpopulation of children against man-made environmental pollutants.", 
    "54": "Chronic experiments with 10 dogs were conducted to study effects of bilateral microinjections of the nonselective agonist of the muscarinic receptors carbachol, nonselective blocker of the muscarinic receptors scopolamine and selective blocker M1 of the muscarinic receptors pyrensepine on the instrumental defensive reflex in the neostriatum to sustain a given flexion amplitude and posture adjustment. Microinjections of carbachol were found to increase tone and stem the phase of the reflex, make posture adjustment more orderly and amplitudinous. Repeated microinjections gave the instrumental movement a ramp-like form. Chronic carbachol microinjections (over several years) resulted in akinesis and rigidity in dogs. However, these led to impairment of the diagonal pattern of posture adjustment as in pathologic so in normal dogs. These developments were partially meliorated by dopamine, scopolamine and pyrensepine which sharply increased the phase component of the instrumental movement. These findings are interpreted in the light of the concept of two neostriatum efferent outputs with opposite effects on respective targets and the muscarinic and dopamine receptors as their triggers and blockers. Results of the experiment bring to the conclusion that activation or blockage of the muscarinic receptors in the neostriatum can modify an existing motor behavior and compensate motor pathology in dogs.",

Data sources included nursing home and pharmacy records; nurses' assessments of residents' behavior, pain, sleep, and demand for medication; and researchers' observations of resident requests for medication. Measures of benzodiazepine use included benzodiazepine prescriptions, prevalence and extent of as-needed drug use, and chronic use as defined by Health Care Financing Administration guidelines.", 
    "57": "A quarter of the residents received prescriptions for benzodiazepines. Of these, 71 percent received prescriptions to aid sleep or to be taken at bedtime; 32 percent used benzodiazepines for a longer period than recommended; and 26 percent requested medication. Logistic regression analysis showed that residents with depression, pain, or sleep problems were more likely to have received benzodiazepines and to have requested medication. Chronic use was significantly higher among residents with depression, sleep problems, or multiple benzodiazepine regimens and among those who requested medication. Demand and sleep problems also were associated with higher rates of any as-needed use and with higher numbers of as-needed doses used.",

    "59": "We hypothesized that the digestion of proteins gives rise to peptides that initiate several satiety signals from the gut, and that the signals arising will be dependent on the protein source. The role of peripheral opioid and cholecystokinin (CCK)-A receptors was investigated. Casein, soy protein, and casein and soy hydrolysates were administered to rats by gavage (0.5 g protein/4 mL water). Food intake was measured over 2 h. The opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone methiodide (1.0 mg/kg) given intraperitoneally (i.p.), increased food intake when given at the same time as the hydrolysate preloads, 25 min after the casein preloads and 55 min after the soy protein preloads. The CCK-A receptor antagonist, devazepide (which reverses protein-induced food intake suppression), when given at 0.25 mg/kg, i.p., 60 min before preloads of each of three soy hydrolysates, also blocked suppression of food intake, but the strength and duration of the interaction depended on the preparation. When the two receptor antagonists were both administered with soy or casein preloads, their effects were additive. We conclude that peptides arising from digestion contribute to satiety by independent activation of both opioid and CCK-A receptors.",

Throughout the study, diazepam, flumazenil and picrotoxin were administered i.p. 30 min before sacrificing animals and obtaining slice preparations, while GABA was added directly into the medium in the reaction chamber. GABA decreased QO(2) in concentrations of 5 x 10(-4), 10(-2) and 5 x 10(-2)mol l(-1), while 10(-5) and 10(-6)mol l(-1) GABA had no effect, as well as diazepam, flumazenil and picrotoxin. All diazepam doses (1, 2.5 and 5 mg kg(-1)) increased action of 5 x 10(-4)mol l(-1) GABA, whereas 2.5 mg kg(-1) dose amplified the effect of 10(-6)mol l(-1) GABA. Flumazenil and picrotoxin (5 mg kg(-1) both) blocked diazepam's effects. Flumazenil augmented 10(-6)mol l(-1) GABA effects, while picrotoxin and flumazenil abolished the effects of 5 x 10(-4)mol l(-1) GABA. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the influence of modulation of GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor function on cerebral metabolism of oxygen in in vitro settings. The results are in accordance with those obtained in numerous in vivo studies, pointing to the moderate level of influence of GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex on QO(2) regulation.",

We now describe this movement disorder occurring in a patient who developed a myelitis of unknown aetiology. A typically striking remission followed treatment with carbamazepine. It is suggested that the effect of the drug and the disorder itself may both be explained on the basis of altered sodium channels.", 
    "62": "Solid-phase extraction (SPE) is becoming a commonly used extraction technique. Most existing SPE methods extract a single drug from a relatively clean biological matrix (e.g., plasma, serum, or urine) using a silica-based column. These methods, however, are generally not satisfactory for forensic applications because the majority of biological samples are not as clean (e.g., whole blood, bile, tissues). Silica-based columns also may have reproducibility and stability problems. Polymer-based columns have been developed to overcome some of these limitations. In this study, sequential extraction of acidic, neutral, and basic drugs from whole blood using a polymer-based column, Oasis MCX, was undertaken. The extraction procedure developed involved a conditioning step using methanol followed by water; a three-step wash sequence using water, 0.1 M hydrochloric acid, then water/methanol (95:5); and two elution steps. One elution step was for acidic and neutral drugs utilizing acetone/chloroform (1:1), and a second used ethyl acetate/ammonium hydroxide (98:2) for basic drugs. Of the drugs tested, 75% were extractable from whole blood and detectable at therapeutic concentrations. Good recoveries and clean extracts were achieved for the basic drugs; however, the extracts were not as clean for acidic drugs. Unfortunately, the Oasis MCX procedure was not suitable for extracting all drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines).",

Midazolam administration induced acute behavioural changes, and increased reflex suppression after propofol induction. Compared to the control group, the dose required to obtain loss of the pedal reflex was significantly reduced by 37%, and the end-tidal isoflurane concentration during maintenance, reduced by 23%.",

They also had been using more long-acting benzodiazepines (p = 0.003), in higher dosages (p = 0.019). However, this did not result in more difficulty in tapering off benzodiazepines, either at post-test, or at follow-up 2.3 years later. Somatic comorbidity was not associated with the level of psychopathology and not related to the outcome of the discontinuation programme.", 
    "67": "Comorbid anxiety disorders are associated with a more severe disease status in depressed chronic benzodiazepine users, but have no influence on the benzodiazepine discontinuation.

Despite several provisions within PRWORA that focus on the use of illegal drugs, few studies have attempted to identify the prevalence of illegal drug use among welfare recipients. Moreover, no scholarly works have compared rates of drug use in welfare-receiving populations to those of non-welfare-receiving populations with an objective measure of drug use. In the current study, urine specimens were collected from 1,572 arrestees interviewed through Houston's Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) Program in 1999. Drug positive rates are compared between welfare-receiving arrestees (n = 116), non-welfare receiving arrestees living below the poverty level (n = 539), and non-welfare receiving arrestees living above the poverty level (n = 917). Welfare-receiving arrestees were more likely to be female, older, less educated, and to test positive for opiates and benzodiazepines than the other subgroups. Implications for welfare reform policy are discussed in light of the current findings.",

    "70": "Cocaine use has increased considerably during the last twenty years and several related complications can be identified. Clinical features of cocaine intoxication are variable, but predominantly involve cardiovascular events. Chest pain is the most main complaint; myocardial ischemia must be ruled out. Other cardiovascular manifestations are left ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmia, endocarditis and aortic dissection. Non-cardiac complications include neurological (seizures, stroke, cerebral hemorrhage), respiratory (asthma, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary edema), renal (acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis) and obstetrical disorders. Detection of cocaine in the urine provides the diagnosis. Symptomatic treatment is generally given, combining conventional treatment of the complication and broad use of benzodiazepines.", 
    "71": "The purpose of this study was to analyze the impact of high-dose buprenorphine substitution therapy in opiate-dependent patients in terms of use of psychoactive substances, associated risks, social integration, and the social cost generated by the use of these substances. This was a longitudinal quantitative survey carried out in 1083 patients who were evaluated at three times: at the beginning of substitution therapy (D0), at 6 months and then at 12 months follow up (M6, M12). Data were collected with an anonymous self-administered questionnaire, completed in the presence of an investigating physician. Results demonstrated that patients treated with high-dose buprenorphine for 6 months, consumed fewer psychoactive drugs (heroin, cocaine, benzodiazepines) and had fewer associated risks. Additionally, several criteria involved in social integration showed improvement; morbidity and mortality decreased after the first 6 months of substitution therapy. These improvements were followed by a reduction in the social cost of drug use generated by the group of patients considered. These initial results require confirmation in the final analysis of the study taking into account the 12-month follow up.", 
    "72": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of interactions between memory modulatory systems on inhibitory avoidance retention in rats. Adult female Wistar rats were trained and tested in a step-down inhibitory avoidance task (0.3 mA footshock). The training-test interval was 24 h. The animals received an intraperitoneal injection of saline or midazolam (1 mg/kg) 15 min before training, and saline, adrenaline (25 microg/kg), naloxone (0.4 mg/kg), dexamethasone (0.3 mg/kg) or glucose (320 mg/kg) immediately after training. In saline-pretreated rats, adrenaline, naloxone, dexamethasone and glucose enhanced memory retention. Pretreatment with midazolam prevented the facilitatory effects of those treatments. These findings suggest that the facilitation of learning by post-training memory-enhancing treatments is prevented by midazolam.", 
    "73": "Tonic immobility (TI) is considered to be an innate fear response characterized by a temporary state of profound and reversible motor inhibition. TI occurs in a wide range of species in a predator-prey confrontation and is hypothesized to be a terminal defence response occurring when there is physical contact between prey and predator. The objective of the present study was to investigate the validity of the TI model in guinea pigs for detection of anxiolytic and/or antidepressant drug activity. Compounds that reduced TI include the serotonin (5-HT) releaser fenfluramine, the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and buspirone, the 5-HT(2C/2B) receptor antagonist SB206553, the 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist MDL 100.151 -- but only at doses thought also to inhibit 5-HT(2C) receptors--the noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor desipramine, the benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG-7142, the alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine, the neurokinin (NK)(1) receptor antagonist L-733.060, and the NK(2) receptor antagonist SR-48968. Compounds that increased TI include the benzodiazepine agonists diazepam and alprazolam, and the alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine. The selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors citalopram, paroxetine and fluoxetine, the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY100.635, the 5-HT(2C) receptor agonist MK-212, the 5-HT/NA reuptake inhibitor imipramine, the NA reuptake inhibitor talopram, the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil, the alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor antagonist idazoxan and the psychostimulant amphetamine did not have any effect. These findings indicate that the serotonergic, noradrenergic and neurokinin systems are involved in mediating or modulating TI behaviour in guinea pigs. The potential of TI as a behaviour for detecting anxiolytic-like effect may be questioned due to the contradictory effect of the benzodiazepine ligands, which may be attributed to the sedative and/or ataxic effects of the compounds. Nevertheless, there is preclinical evidence suggesting that 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists, 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonists and NK(1) and NK(2) receptor antagonists possess anxiolytic potential. Only when results of clinical investigations of the anxiolytic potential of non-benzodiazepine ligands (for example the NK receptor antagonists) are available, will it be possible to determine fully the predictive validity of the TI model.", 
    "74": "Experimental scratching in animals has hitherto been provoked by substances injected into the skin or central nervous system. We aimed to investigate if spontaneous scratching in the rat can be reduced by sedatives and antipruritics, and to assess if spontaneous scratching is elicited from the skin or the central nervous system. It may also be a complex behaviour related to the rat species, different from clinical itch. Eight male hairless rats were studied for 6 weeks. The animals were recorded on videotape in the middle of the day and at night, and the scratching activity was counted. The following substances were tested sequentially: midazolam, mepyramine, a eutectic mixture of lignocaine and prilocaine (EMLA, betamethasone dipropionate and a vehicle. On days 1-3 of each sequence, the test material was applied to a 42-cm(2) area on the rostral part of the back. Subsequent treatment of the whole body was made on day 4. Midazolam was injected intraperitoneally from day 1 to day 4. After 4 days of treatment, there was a wash-out phase of 3 days until the next sequence. We found a positive correlation between minutes awake and number of scratch episodes. Spontaneous scratching was lower after mepyramine on day 4 (p = 0.046) and after midazolam injections on days 1-3 (p = 0.009) and day 4 (p = 0.003). The local anaesthetic, EMLA, did not significantly influence spontaneous scratching. In conclusion, only the drugs with sedative properties suppressed spontaneous scratching, which is probably a cerebral phenomenon or otherwise explained general behaviour, rather than a reaction to skin stimuli. Thus, for testing of topically applied antipruritics, spontaneous scratching cannot be used as an animal model. Furthermore, evaluation of provocative scratching should eliminate/exclude spontaneous scratching.", 
    "75": "Alprazolam is a hypnotic/tranquilizer that has been shown to specifically inhibit the platelet-activating factor (PAF)-induced aggregation of human platelets. The goal of this study was to elucidate whether alprazolam modulates IL-1alpha-initiated responses. For this purpose we investigated the effects of alprazolam on the IL-1alpha-induced production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1)) in a human glioblastoma cell line, T98G, and explored the signaling pathways involved. We found that alprazolam inhibited IL-1alpha-elicited MCP-1 production within a range of 0.1-3 micro M. In contrast, it did not inhibit IL-1alpha-induced IL-8 production. Although NF-kappaB is involved in regulating the IL-1alpha-induced expression of MCP-1 and IL-8, the degradation of IkappaB-alpha stimulated by IL-1alpha was not inhibited by alprazolam. Alprazolam prevented NF-kappaB from binding to the MCP-1 promoter region (the A2 and A1 oligonucleotide probes), but binding of NF-kappaB to IL-8/NF-kappaB was not inhibited. Moreover, alprazolam inhibited c-Rel/p50 binding to the A2 oligonucleotide probe, but not p50/p65 from binding to the IL-8/NF-kappaB site. While AP-1 is involved in regulating the IL-1alpha-induced expression of IL-8, but not MCP-1, alprazolam potentiated the binding of c-Jun/c-Fos to the AP-1 oligonucleotide probe. These results show that the inhibition of IL-1alpha-mediated MCP-1 production by alprazolam is mainly due to inhibition of c-Rel/p65 and c-Rel/p50 binding to the MCP-1 promoter region, since alprazolam did not affect the IL-1alpha-mediated activation of NF-kappaB (p50/p65) or AP-1 (c-Jun/c-Fos) binding to the IL-8 promoter region. In conclusion, a new action of alprazolam was elucidated, as shown in the inhibition of c-Rel/p65- and c-Rel/p50-regulated transcription.", 
    "76": "The study objective was to prospectively evaluate the frequency and severity of behavioral reactions occurring in children receiving ketamine sedation in the emergency department (ED). A behavioral observational study was conducted. Ketamine was given in a standardized protocol with midazolam, atropine, and a prehypnotic suggestion. Descriptions of behavioral reactions were recorded immediately after the procedure, and longitudinal follow-up was made in 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month. A total of 301 patients were enrolled. Mild reactions described as not unpleasant occurred in 7/205 (3.4%, 95% CI 0.9-5.9%) of the younger age group, and 2/96 (2.1%, 95% CI 0-5.0%) of the older age group. Unpleasant reactions occurred in 2/205 (1.0%, 95% CI 0-2.4%) of the younger age group, and 4/96 (4.2%, 95% CI 0-8.2%) of the older age group. We observed no clinically important difference in the proportion of older versus younger children experiencing behavioral reactions after IV ketamine sedation.", 
    "77": "Patients with Tourette's syndrome often develop multiple psychopathological symptoms beyond the basic symptoms (motor and vocal tics). We describe a female patient who had been treated over years with cognitive-behavioural methods under the diagnosis of anxiety disorder without success. Her obsessive-compulsive and tic symptoms had been ignored because they had not been reported by the patient, who was accustomed to them. Our case underlines the necessity of specific exploration and taking of a case history, especially when symptoms are atypical and do not improve under treatment. This gives cause for some critical remarks on the principle of comorbidity.", 
    "78": "According to several studies in the USA, alcohol abuse is common among elder people, particularly among those admitted to hospital. Corresponding data for Germany are lacking as yet. In this study, the frequency of addiction problems in the elderly admitted to hospital was investigated using the data from 1990 to 1998 of the psychiatric department at the General University Hospital of L\u00fcbeck, Germany. Furthermore, the documentations of all consultations in that period were reevaluated. The psychiatric consultation service covers two general hospitals providing inpatient treatment for about 200,000 inhabitants. Diagnoses were made according to the ICD-10 criteria. In 17.7% of the males older than 64 years and in 4.2% of the elderly females admitted to the psychiatric department, alcohol dependency was diagnosed, while 5.8% of the elderly patients showed substance abuse, most often of benzodiazepine. Among the patients visited in the psychiatric consultation service, 10.8% of the elderly males and 3.2% of the elderly females were alcohol addicts and 3.9% substance abusers. The frequency of alcohol-induced neuropsychiatric complications, particularly withdrawal delirium and amnestic syndrome, increased with age. Also, benzodiazepine withdrawal delirium most frequently occurred in older patients. These results underscore that, although the prevalence rate seems to be lower than among the younger population, in the elderly population substance abuse still is a relevant medical problem, since the rate of neuropsychiatric complications increased with age.", 
    "79": "Benzodiazepines (BZs) are commonly used in conjunction with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in the treatment of panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA). However, empirical evidence provides little support for the utility of this combined treatment approach over CBT alone. Westra and Stewart [Clin. Psychol. Rev. 18 (1998) 307] have proposed that pm or as-needed use of BZs may inhibit positive CBT outcome to a greater extent than regularly scheduled BZ use. Using a naturalistic design, the present study investigated the impact of manner of BZ use on treatment outcome from CBT in 43 patients with PDA. Among various BZ parameters (chronicity, frequency, dose, and frequency of prn use), pm use of BZs for coping with anxiety symptoms was a significant negative predictor of degree of change in both anxiety sensitivity and anxious arousal from pre- to post-CBT. Although no significant between-group differences were evident in pre-treatment symptomatology, unmedicated subjects demonstrated the most positive overall CBT outcome, while pm BZ users evidenced the fewest gains. Regular BZ users were generally not significantly differentiated from unmedicated subjects in CBT outcome and both tended to obtain post-treatment scores in the nonclinical range. Implications of these findings for clinical management of BZ use throughout CBT for PDA are discussed.",

    "84": "Prior test experience compromises the anxiolytic efficacy of benzodiazepines (BZs) either in rats or mice, a phenomenon not exclusive to the elevated plus-maze (EPM) animal model of anxiety, which is referred to as \"one-trial tolerance.\" However, it remains to be determined whether a similar event occurs when testing other drugs that also possess binding-sites on the GABA(A) receptor, such as ethanol and barbiturates. In the present study, we have addressed this issue using maze-naive and maze-experienced (free exploration of the EPM 48 h earlier for 5 min) rats pretreated with ethanol (1.0-1.4 g/kg) or phenobarbital (20-60 mg/kg) and submitted to the EPM. The results confirmed the anxiolytic profile of both drugs, represented by increased open arm exploration and decreased risk assessment behavior, in maze-naive rats. However, in maze-experienced rats, neither ethanol nor phenobarbital anxiolytic effects were observed, suggesting that prior maze experience compromised the drugs' anxiolytic activity. Thus, the \"one-trial tolerance\" phenomenon might also be extended to other drugs that bind to the GABA(A) receptor complex.", 
    "85": "In the present study, the effects of prenatal protein malnutrition on stimulus control exerted by the benzodiazepine (BZ), chlordiazepoxide (CDP) and the GABA-A receptor agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol (THIP) were characterized. The adult, male offspring of female Sprague-Dawley rats fed either low (6% casein) or adequate (25% casein) protein diets 5 weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy served as subjects. Subjects were first trained to discriminate CDP (8.0 mg/kg ip) from saline using drug discrimination procedures. Once a criterion level of performance was achieved, generalization tests were performed to lower doses of CDP (4.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.5 and 0.25 mg/kg) and then to several doses of THIP (10.0, 7.5, 5.6 and 3.2 mg/kg). Lastly, the ability of a single dose of THIP (3.0 mg/kg) to enhance discriminative control by several low doses of CDP (4.0, 2.0, 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg) was assessed. Although both diet groups acquired the original CDP/saline discrimination at the same rate, malnourished rats exhibited significantly more generalization to low doses of CDP than their well-nourished counterparts. Neither diet group exhibited significant generalization to THIP nor a difference in THIP's ability to enhance the CDP cue. These results suggest that a subject's sensitivity to the stimulus properties of drugs can be selectively modified by prenatal malnutrition.",

Step-wise regression analysis indicated that penta-parametric regression expression containing Sz, B, Ip1, Ip2 and Ip3 is the most potent and selective for CCK-A affinity. The predictive potential of the model is discussed on the basis of cross-validation parameters as well as by estimating root mean square (RMSR) of the residuals.", 
    "87": "Two days following one-week administration of the benzodiazepine, flurazepam (FZP), rats exhibit anticonvulsant tolerance in vivo, while reduced GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition and enhanced EPSP amplitude are present in CA1 pyramidal neurons in vitro. AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated synaptic transmission in FZP-treated rats was examined using electrophysiological techniques in in vitro hippocampal slices. In CA1 pyramidal neurons from FZP-treated rats, the miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude was significantly increased (33%) without change in frequency, rise time or decay time. Moreover, mEPSC amplitude was not elevated in dentate granule neurons following 1-week FZP treatment or in CA1 pyramidal neurons following acute desalkyl-FZP treatment. Regulation of AMPAR number was assessed by quantitative autoradiography with the AMPAR antagonist, [(3)H]Ro48-8587. Specific binding was significantly increased in stratum pyramidale of hippocampal areas CA1 and CA2 and in proximal dendritic fields of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Regulation of AMPAR subunit proteins was examined using immunological techniques. Neither abundance nor distribution of GluR1-3 subunit proteins was different in the CA1 region following FZP treatment. These findings suggest that enhanced AMPAR currents, mediated at least in part by increased AMPAR number, may contribute to BZ anticonvulsant tolerance. Furthermore, these studies suggest an interaction between GABAergic and glutamatergic systems in the CA1 region which may provide novel therapeutic strategies for restoring BZ effectiveness.", 
    "88": "Commercial solvents such as toluene are commonly used as drugs of abuse by children and adolescents. The cellular and molecular sites and mechanisms of actions of these compounds are not well studied but their effects on behavior resemble those of central nervous system depressants such as alcohol, barbiturates and benzodiazepines. In this study, the effects of toluene on voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs) were measured in pheochromocytoma cells. The KCl-induced rise in intracellular calcium as measured by calcium imaging was almost completely blocked by the dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist nifedipine verifying that undifferentiated pheochromocytoma cells express mainly the L-type of calcium channel. Toluene (0.3-3000 microM) by itself did not affect intracellular calcium levels in resting cells but dose-dependently inhibited the KCl-induced rise in calcium. This inhibition was substantially reversed upon washout of the toluene-containing solution. KCl-dependent increases in intracellular calcium in cells differentiated with nerve growth factor (NGF) were largely insensitive to nifedipine. Toluene produced a greater inhibition of the KCl response in NGF treated cells as compared with undifferentiated cells. A similar finding was obtained when whole-cell patch-clamp-electrophysiology was used to directly monitor the effects of toluene on voltage-activated calcium currents in undifferentiated and differentiated cells. These results show that dihydropyridine sensitive and insensitive calcium channels are inhibited by toluene and may represent important sites of action for this compound.",

A subset of new ligands bind the PBR (rat brain and testis) with picomolar affinity, representing the most potent ligands that have been identified to date, and elicited effects on endogenous rate of steroidogenesis in MA10 Leydig cells, having similar potency and effect as PK11195. Several compounds, differently substituted at C-7, were used as molecular yardsticks to probe the spatial dimension of the lipophilic pocket L4 in the receptor binding site.",

Discovery 1995, 12, 193-248) for ligands binding to the benzodiazepine site of the GABA(A) receptor, 40 new flavone derivatives have been synthesized and their affinities for the benzodiazepine site have been determined. Two new regions of steric repulsive interactions between ligand and receptor have been characterized, and the receptor region in the vicinity of 6- and 3'-substituents has been mapped out. 2'-Hydroxy substitution is shown to give a significant increase in affinity, which is interpreted in terms of a novel hydrogen bond interaction with the previously proposed hydrogen bond-accepting site A2. On the basis of the results of these studies and the refined pharmacophore model, 5'-bromo-2'-hydroxy-6-methylflavone, the highest affinity flavone derivative reported so far (K(i) = 0.9 nM), was successfully designed. A comparison of the pharmacophore model with a recently proposed alternative model (Marder; et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2001, 9, 323-335) has been made.",

In regard to other types of sedative agents, most practitioners use little, if any, sedation. Eighty-two percent use sedation for less than 11% of their patients. Of the 1,778 respondents, 1,224 used drugs other than nitrous oxide. In a typical three-month period, they performed 77,112 sedations. Of that number, 61,662 (80%) were administered by only 478 practitioners who use sedation on the average of once or greater each day.", 
    "94": "In comparison with previous surveys in 1985, 1991 and 1995, these results demonstrate an overall increased use of sedation by pediatric dentists. However, the increased use is due primarily to an increase in the numbers of practitioners who are heavier users of sedation (once or greater each day).", 
    "95": "We investigated whether evoked potentials to omitted stimuli could be measured in rats. Such an animal model would provide a measure of aspects of information processing concerned with expectancy and time estimation. In a first experiment, omission evoked potentials (OEPs) were elicited in rats by omitting stimuli (10%) from a train of tone pips with a fixed ISI (3 s). A control session consisted of omitting stimuli (10%) from a train of tone pips with a variable ISI (2.5-3.5 s). In a second experiment, OEPs were measured in rats that received 4 mg x kg(-1) diazepam or vehicle sc. In the first experiment, half of the animals showed OEPs that consisted of a late-latency positive wave, the other rats showed a slow negative drift. No OEPs were found in the control session. Rats showing OEPs consisting of a positive wave in Experiment 1 were passed to Experiment 2. In the vehicle condition of the second experiment, all rats showed OEPs. In the diazepam condition no OEPs were found. We found that OEPs can be measured in rats. In addition, OEPs are disrupted by diazepam. We propose that OEPs provide an elegant tool to elicit selectively endogenous EP components.", 
    "96": "The Fourie EEG spectral analysis of thr sensomotor cortex and dorsal hypocampus in freely moving rats could reveal the common pharmacological EEG effects of different antihypoxic agents (gutimin, amtizole, emoxipine, and 3-OPK). All the agents decreased the total EEG power (they all reduced the absolute power in all frequency bands) and simultaneously enhanced (2 relative power. The former suggests that there was a decrease in the energetic level of bioelectric fluctuations, which may indicate that the brain reduces its energetic functioning level. The latter means that antihypoxic drugs activate the central nervous system. This effect may normalize EEG activity during hypoxic conditions, which causes the enhancement of slow-wave activity and reduces fast EEG activity. The pharmacological EEG effects of different groups of psychotropic drugs (nootropic drugs, psychostimulants, antidepressants, benzodiazepine tranquilizers, etc.) versus antihypoxants are discussed.",

Jugular bulb blood oxygen saturation (SjO2), arterialvenous oxygen content difference (Da-vO2) and cerebral oxygen extraction rate(CEO2) were measured at various periods of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The results showed: SjO2 decreased significantly, Da-vO2 and CEO2 increased markedly during rewarming period in control group; but in propofol group and midazolam group, SjO2, CEO2 and Da-vO2 did not decline significantly compared with baseline.

    "102": "Research into the molecular mechanisms of epileptic brain injury is hampered by the resistance of key mouse strains to seizure-induced neuronal death evoked by systemically administered excitotoxins such as kainic acid. Because C57BL/6 mice are extensively employed as the genetic background for transgenic/knockout modeling in cell death research but are seizure resistant, we sought to develop a seizure model in this strain characterized by injury to the hippocampal CA subfields. Adult male C57BL/6 mice underwent focally evoked seizures induced by intraamygdala microinjection of kainic acid. Kainic acid (KA) effectively elicited ipsilateral CA3 pyramidal neuronal death within a narrow dose range of 0.1-0.3 microg, with mortality < 10%. With employment of the most consistent (0.3 microg) dose, seizures were terminated 15, 30, 60, or 90 min after KA by diazepam. Damage was largely restricted to the ipsilateral CA3 subfield of the hippocampus, but injury was also consistent within CA1, suggesting that this mouse model better reflects the hippocampal neuropathology of human temporal lobe epilepsy than does the rat, in which CA1 is typically spared. Confirming this CA1 injury as seizure specific and not a consequence of ischemia, we used laser-Doppler flowmetry to determine that cerebral perfusion did not significantly change (97% to 118%) over control. Degenerating cells were > 95% neuronal as determined by neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) counterstaining of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeled (TUNEL) brain sections. Furthermore, TUNEL-positive cells often exhibited the morphological features of apoptosis, and small numbers were positive for cleaved caspase-3. These data establish a mouse model of focally evoked seizures in the C57BL/6 strain associated with a restricted pattern of apoptotic neurodegeneration within the hippocampal subfields that may be applied to research into the molecular basis of neuronal death after seizures.",

Separation was achieved using an untreated fused-silica capillary (48 cm (effective length 40 cm) x 50 num) at 25 kV; detection was performed by UV at 220 nm. The microemulsion system consisted of 70 mM octane, 800 mM 1-butanol, 80 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 10 mM borate buffer, pH 9. Very high efficiencies (up to 400 000 plates) and resolution better than 3 were achieved. Since this technique is not compatible with mass spectrometry (MS) detection, a capillary electrochromatographic (CEC) method was developed to separate flunitrazepam and its metabolites. The effects of mobile phase composition and pH as well as voltage and temperature were systematically investigated. The optimized CEC method allowed the baseline separation of the investigated compounds. For the on-line coupling of CEC with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, the column was connected to a void fused-silica capillary using a Teflon connection. This configuration was found efficient and suitable for hyphenation of commercial CEC and MS instrumentation using commercially available CEC columns.",

A scheme for quantitative determinations of a wider range of toxicological analytes such as opioids, benzodiazepines and tricyclics in human blood has been piloted by the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Scheme (UKNEQAS). Specialist schemes are available for drugs of abuse testing in urine and for hair analysis. Whilst these programmes provide much useful information on the performance of analytical techniques, they fail to monitor the integrated processes that are needed in investigation of toxicological cases. In practice, both qualitative and quantitative tests are used in combination with case information to guide the evaluation of the samples and to develop an interpretation of the analytical findings that is used to provide clinical or forensic advice.

Qualitative and quantitative analyses of a mixture of three selected benzodiazepines (diazepam, nordazepam and bromazepam) were used to compare gas chromatography (GC-TOF-MS, quadrupole GC-MS, GC-ECD) and liquid chromatography (HPLC-DAD) data. Method validation parameters like LOD, LOQ, S/N-ratios reflect the capabilities of GC-TOF-MS. Five-point calibrations for bromazepam in human peripheral blood (50, 100, 160, 200, 300 ng/ml) using medazepam as internal standard (1000 ng/ml) were performed. The calibrations using GC-TOF-MS (using the fragments of m/z 236 and 288), GC-ECD (dual system) and HPLC-DAD (at 235 nm) all showed correlation coefficients close or superior to 0.99. Quadrupole GC-MS data was not used in the comparison of extracted samples due to the low sensitivity in the full scan mode. Two analyses of real cases concerning bromazepam are presented. In the first case, the presence or absence of bromazepam could not be established with both HPLC-DAD and GC-ECD due to background signals. The extracted ion chromatograms and spectrum traces after the analysis with the GC-TOF-MS could clearly excluded the presence of bromazepam. The second case illustrates the quantitation of bromazepam, where both HPLC-DAD and GC-ECD were unable to give satisfactory results, again due to interfering background signals. The analyses performed on the GC-TOF-MS-system demonstrated high sensitivity and also high selectivity due to the high quality of mass spectra obtained. The advantages of GC-TOF-MS make it a promising analytical technique for forensic toxicology.",

    "120": "Hyperammonemia resulting from inherited urea cycle enzyme deficiencies or liver failure results in severe central nervous system dysfunction including brain edema, convulsions and coma. Neuropathologic evaluation in these disorders reveals characteristic alterations of astrocyte morphology ranging from cell swelling (acute hyperammonemia) to Alzheimer Type II astrocytosis (chronic hyperammonemia). Having no effective urea cycle, brain relies on glutamine synthesis for the removal of excess ammonia and the enzyme responsible, glutamine synthetase, has a predominantly astrocytic localization. Accumulation of ammonia in brain results in a redistribution of cerebral blood flow and metabolism from cortical to sub-cortical structures. In addition to changes in astrocyte morphology, increased brain ammonia concentrations result in alterations in expression of key astrocyte proteins including glial fibrillary acidic protein, glutamate and glycine transporters and \"peripheral-type\" (mitochondrial) benzodiazepine receptors. Such changes result in alterations of astrocytic volume and increased extracellular concentrations of excitatory and inhibitory substances. In addition, the ammonium ion has direct effects on excitatory-inhibitory transmission via distinct mechanisms involving cellular chloride extrusion and postsynaptic receptor function. Acute ammonia exposure leads to activation of NMDA receptors and their signal transduction pathways. Chronic hyperammonemia also results in increased concentrations of neuroactive L-tryptophan metabolites including serotonin and quinolinic acid. Therapy in hyperammonemic syndromes continues to rely on ammonia-lowering strategies via peripheral mechanisms (reduction of ammonia production in the gastrointestinal tract, increased ammonia removal by muscle).",

    "126": "Zinc is strikingly co-localized with glutamate-containing vesicles in the synaptic terminals of retinal photoreceptors, and it is thought to be co-released with glutamate onto postsynaptic neurons such as horizontal cells and bipolar cells. Here we examined exogenous zinc modulation of glutamate receptors on cultured retinal horizontal cells using patch-clamp recording and endogenous zinc effect on intact horizontal cells using intracellular recording techniques. Application of 3, 30, and 300 microM zinc reduced the whole cell peak current of response to 200 microM glutamate by 2, 30, and 56%, respectively. Zinc suppression of glutamate response persisted in the presence of 10 microM cyclothiazide (CTZ). Glutamate responses of outside-out patches were completely abolished by 30 microM 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466), and the receptor desensitization was blocked by 30 microM CTZ, indicating that receptor target for the zinc action on horizontal cells is alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproponic acid (AMPA) receptors. Zinc decreased the amplitude of outside-out patch peak current without an effect on either its 10-90% rise time or the rate of receptor desensitization. Dose-response curves for glutamate show that zinc reduced the maximal current evoked by glutamate and increased EC(50) from 50 +/- 3 to 70 +/- 6 microM without changing the Hill coefficient. Chelation of endogenous zinc with 1 mM Ca-EDTA depolarized horizontal cells in the intact retina by 3 mV, consistent with relief of the partial glutamate receptor inhibition by zinc. Overall, the results describe a unimodal form of zinc modulation of AMPA-type glutamate receptor responses not previously described in native neuronal preparations and a novel role for endogenous zinc in modulating neurotransmission.",

On the basis of brain imaging and human genetics, a deficit in GABAergic inhibition (GABA, \u03b3-aminobuiyric acid) has been identified as contributing to the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders, epilepsy, and schizophrenia. Therapeutically, GABA(A) receptors play a major role as targets for benzodiazepine drugs. The therapeutic relevance of the multitude of structurally diverse GABA(A) receptor subtypes has only recently been identified. \u03b1(1)-GABA(A) receptors were found to mediate sedation, anterograde amnesia, and part of the seizure protection of these drugs, whereas \u03b1(2)-GABA(A) receptors, but not \u03b1(3)-GABA(A) receptors, mediate anxiolysis. Rational drug targeting to specific receptor subtypes has now become possible. Only restricted neuronal networks will be modulated by the upcoming subtype-selective drugs.

Specific diagnosis is a precondition to successful therapy: despite substantial overlap, each disorder responds preferentially to specific pharmacotherapy. Comorbidity with depression is common; hence the success of the SSRIs, which were originally designed to treat depression. Assessment (multidomain measures versus individual end points) remains problematic, as-frequently-do efficacy and tolerability The ideal anxiolytic remains the Holy Grail of worldwide psychopharmacologic research.", 
    "129": "This paper follows the preclinical work on the effects of stress on neurobiological and neuroendocrine systems and provides a comprehensive working model for understanding the pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Studies of the neurobiology of PTSD in clinical populations are reviewed. Specific brain areas that play an important role in a variety of types of memory are also preferentially affected by stress, including hippocampus, amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, and cingulate. This review indicates the involvement of these brain systems in the stress response, and in learning and memory. Affected systems in the neural circuitry of PTSD are reviewed (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis), catecholaminergic and serotonergic systems, endogenous benzodiazepines, neuropeptides, hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (HPT-axis), and neuro-immunological alterations) as well as changes found with structural and functional neuroimaging methods. Converging evidence has emphasized the role of early-life trauma in the development of PTSD and other trauma-related disorders. Current and new targets for systems that play a role in the neural circuitry of PTSD are discussed. This material provides a basis for understanding the psychopathology of stress-related disorders, in particular PTSD.", 
    "130": "Ultrafast liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) bioanalysis was demonstrated with the use of packed silica columns operated under elevated flow rates. A special effort has been made to achieve ultrafast analysis without sacrificing chromatographic resolution. Two multiple analyte/metabolites assays, (1) morphine/morphine-6-glucuronide(M6G)/morphine-3-glucuronide(M3G) and (2) midazolam/1'-hydroxymidazolam/4-hydroxymidazolam, were used to demonstrate the speed, sensitivity, peak shape and separation of the ultrafast methods utilizing silica columns. In both methods adequate chromatographic separation was a necessity because quantitation results would be otherwise compromised due to cross interference between different selected reaction monitoring (SRM) transitions. Baseline resolutions between morphine, M6G and M3G in human plasma extracts were achieved within 30 s on a 50 x 3 mm Betasil silica column operated at 4 mL/min of isocratic acetonitrile/water mobile phase. The total injection-to-injection cycle time was 48 s with a simple, single-autosampler/single-column setup, when a Shimadzu SIL-HT autosampler was used. Baseline resolution between 1'-hydroxymidazolam and 4-hydroxymidalolam in monkey plasma extracts was achieved within 33 s using similar conditions. Due to the absence of carry-over in this case, no rinsing of the injection needle was necessary, resulting in a cycle time of only 39 s/sample. These ultrafast methods were successfully used to analyze extracted biological samples and proved to be reproducible, reliable and generated equivalent pharmaco-kinetic (PK) results to those obtained by regular flow LC/MS/MS analysis to support discovery PK studies.", 
    "131": "It has previously been shown that drugs, such as benzodiazepines, that inhibit seizure activity during ethanol withdrawal, fail to alleviate the potentiated withdrawal seen following repeated episodes of withdrawal when administered during each withdrawal episode. Acute administration of the N-methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor competitive antagonist, CGP39551, has been shown to inhibit seizure activity during ethanol withdrawal, and, when administered during the periods of repeated diazepam withdrawal, it blocked the reduction in pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) seizure threshold seen following a final, untreated withdrawal.", 
    "132": "The aim of the current study was to determine if CGP39551 could alter final ethanol-withdrawal symptoms when administered during the acute intermittent withdrawal periods.", 
    "133": "Mice were chronically treated with ethanol-containing liquid diet for either 30 days continuously (single withdrawal) or with 8-h withdrawal periods on day 16 and day 23 of treatment (repeated withdrawal). Control animals received a control diet for the same period of time. On the final withdrawal animals were tested for behavioural signs of withdrawal. The effect of CGP39551 administered acutely on withdrawal [up to 5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)] or during the intermittent withdrawal periods (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was examined.", 
    "134": "Acute administration of CGP39551 failed to inhibit handling-induced convulsions in the single-withdrawal or repeated-withdrawal group and had no effect on either decreased exploration or increased sensitivity to PTZ seen in withdrawal. Surprisingly, when CGP39551 was administered during periods of repeated ethanol withdrawal a potentiation of seizure activity was seen in the final, untreated withdrawal. This potentiation of seizure activity, compared with vehicle-treated animals, was not seen when CGP39551 was given whilst animals had access to ethanol (single-withdrawal group and repeated-withdrawal group where CGP39551 treatment was non-contingent with withdrawal episodes). However, the decrease in exploration seen during withdrawal was potentiated in repeated-withdrawal animals treated with CGP39551 irrespective of the time at which the CGP39551 was administered.", 
    "135": "Treatment with an NMDA receptor-competitive antagonist potentiated the ethanol-withdrawal syndrome in animals with previous experience of ethanol withdrawal.", 
    "136": "Chronically administered antidepressant drugs, particularly selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are clinically effective in the treatment of all anxiety disorders, while the clinical effectiveness of \"traditional\" anxiolytics, such as benzodiazepines (BDZs), is limited to generalised anxiety disorder or acute panic attacks. This implies that animal models of anxiety should be sensitive to SSRIs and other antidepressants in order to have predictive validity. We reviewed the literature on the effects of antidepressants in the so-called animal models of anxiety and found that only the isolation-induced calls in guinea-pig pups may reveal anxiolytic-like action of all antidepressant classes after acute administration. Some other models, such as marble-burying or conditioned-freezing behaviours, and isolation- or shock-induced ultrasonic vocalisation models, may detect anxiolytic-like activity of acutely administered antidepressants, although the sensitivity of these models is usually limited to SSRIs and other drugs affecting 5-HT uptake. The predictive validity of models of \"anxiety\", such as the plus-maze and light-dark transition tests or stress-induced hyperthermia, appears to be limited to BDZ-related drugs. Far less work has been done on chronic administration of antidepressants in animal anxiety models. Unless and until such studies have been undertaken, the true predictive value of the anxiety models will remain unknown.", 
    "137": "To explain the variability of docetaxel pharmacokinetics through study of CYP3A phenotype and genotype, and MDR1 genotype.", 
    "138": "We studied the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of docetaxel in patients in whom it was indicated and who had not received known CYP3A4 substrates. Midazolam was administered intravenously to these patients at least 2 days before docetaxel treatment, and systemic clearances of both drugs were correlated. Patients were characterized for polymorphisms in the CYP3A4 promoter region, CYP3A5, and the C3435T polymorphism of MDR1.", 
    "139": "Thirty-two patients were enrolled, of whom 31 had full pharmacokinetic data sets. Docetaxel clearance correlated with midazolam clearance, body-surface area, serum albumin, and performance status. Docetaxel and midazolam clearances were normally distributed. In multiple linear regression analyses, midazolam clearance and performance status were the only significant covariates of docetaxel clearance, and the area under the curve of docetaxel, serum levels of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, and ALT were significant predictors of nadir neutrophil count. No polymorphisms were detected in the 5' regulatory region of CYP3A4. Nine patients of 25 studied were homozygous for the CYP3A5*3 genotype, and had lower mean clearance of midazolam but not docetaxel. The T/T genotype at the C3435T of MDR1, which is associated with reduced P-glycoprotein function, was found in eight of 27 patients.", 
    "140": "Midazolam may be used as a probe drug for CYP3A activity to predict docetaxel clearances, hence reducing interindividual variability. Homozygotes for CYP3A5*3 and C3435T of MDR1 are common in our population, and their effects on pharmacokinetics of relevant substrates should be studied further.", 
    "141": "Between 1994 and 1997, the Food and Drug Administration approved three new atypical antipsychotic medications for the treatment of schizophrenia. The authors tracked prescription patterns for these medications, an atypical antipsychotic approved in 1989, and conventional neuroleptics in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to determine how the new drugs have diffused in a national health care system.", 
    "142": "Pharmacy claims data were collected for all patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia in the VA. Patients who received stable 3-month prescriptions of any antipsychotic medication were followed over fiscal year 2000 to determine how often they were switched to another drug, how much time elapsed before they were switched, the drug to which they were switched, and whether they subsequently switched back to the original drug.", 
    "143": "Of the 21,873 patients with schizophrenia who had stable 3-month prescriptions of any antipsychotic medication, 5,426 (25%) had their medications switched during the next year. Half of these patients (N=2,708) switched back to their original drug, usually within 30 days. Patients who had stable prescriptions of clozapine were the least likely to be switched (18%), and patients who had stable prescriptions of quetiapine were the most likely to be switched (37%). When medications were switched, 35% of the patients were switched to olanzapine; only 1% were switched to clozapine, and only 14% were switched to quetiapine.", 
    "144": "Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia is a dynamic process. One-quarter of patients with stable antipsychotic drug regimens had their medication changed within 1 year. Quetiapine was the least prescribed of the newer drugs. These results suggest that it is important that all of these medications are included in formularies.", 
    "145": "The aim of the study was to compare the clinical efficacy of three different analgesic drugs with respect to their level of sedation, analgesia and quick mobilisation without cardiopulmonary depression, for outpatient extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) procedure.", 
    "146": "Sixty outpatients undergoing elective ESWL using a third generation lithotriptor were studied. The patients were randomly divided into three groups of twenty patients. All patients received midazolam (2 mg) intravenously five minutes before the procedure. In group F, fentanyl was given (1 microg kg(-1) IV) at the same time with midazolam. In group D, diclofenac sodium was given (1 mg kg(-1), IM) intramuscularly 45 minutes before ESWL. In group T, tramadol was given (1.5 mg kg(-1)) 30 minutes before ESWL. Arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation were recorded before the procedure, after sedation, at the first minute, and every ten minutes during the procedure. Pain intensity was identified with a Visual Analogue Scale. The level of sedation was evaluated by using the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale. All patients were asked to assess their satisfaction with the seven point Verbal Rating Scale before discharge. Side-effects were also recorded during the procedure.", 
    "147": "The incidence of nausea and vomiting was higher in fentanyl group compared with the other groups. In patients who received fentanyl, the decrease of oxygen saturation at the first and tenth minute of the procedure was statistically significant (p < 0.05).", 
    "148": "Diclofenac sodium and tramadol were found to be safe and effective analgesics with lower side-effects than fentanyl.", 
    "149": "Target-controlled infusions of anaesthetic agents have become increasingly available. They can involve the use of propofol in combination with an opioid or a benzodiazepine. The effect site concentration of propofol infusions has been advocated as a method of estimating drug distribution. We investigated the influence of co-induction with remifentanil and midazolam on effect site propofol requirements at induction of anaesthesia using target-controlled infusions.", 
    "150": "Sixty-six consenting adult patients were randomly allocated to three treatment groups. Each group received induction of anaesthesia with a different total intravenous technique. One group was induced with target-controlled propofol alone; another received target-controlled propofol and target-controlled remifentanil (3 ng mL-1); and the last received midazolam (0.03 mg kg-1), target-controlled remifentanil (3 ng mL-1) and target-controlled propofol. Computer simulation was used to calculate effect site concentrations. We recorded propofol dose and effect site concentration at loss of verbal response.", 
    "151": "The effect site concentration (Ce50) of propofol alone was 2.19 micrograms mL-1. This was reduced to 1.55 micrograms mL-1 during co-induction with remifentanil and further reduced to 0.64 microgram mL-1 with midazolam premedication (P < 0.001; ANOVA).", 
    "152": "We conclude that co-induction with remifentanil alone or with midazolam can be used to reduce propofol doses at induction of anaesthesia using target-controlled infusions. We believe that using effect site concentration may prove a useful tool in routine clinical practice.", 
    "153": "Status epilepticus is usually initially treated with a benzodiazepine such as diazepam. During prolonged seizures, however, patients often lose their sensitivity to benzodiazepines, thus developing pharmacoresistant seizures. In rats, administration of LiCl followed 20-24 h later by pilocarpine induces a continuous, self-sustained, and reproducible form of status epilepticus that can be terminated with diazepam when it is administered soon after the pilocarpine injection. However, when administered after a 45 min delay, diazepam is less effective. Previous findings have suggested that the development of pharmacoresistance is related to the stage of status epilepticus. In the present study, we characterized the seizure stage-dependence of diazepam pharmacoresistance. Following administration of different doses of diazepam at varying time intervals after specific behaviorally- and electrographically-defined seizure stages, stage-, time-, and dose-dependent pharmacoresistance to diazepam developed. We also studied two other antiepileptic drugs commonly used in the treatment of status epilepticus, phenobarbital and phenytoin. Consistent with previous studies, our results indicated a similar relationship between stage, time and dose for phenobarbital, but not for phenytoin. Our data are consistent with rapid modulation of GABA(A) receptors during status epilepticus that may result in pharmacoresistance to antiepileptic drugs that enhance GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition."
