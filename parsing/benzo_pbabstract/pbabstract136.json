    "4": "For the elimination of postoperative complications, which are evident in infants with congenital palatine and upper lip cleft after halothane anesthesia during standard premedication (Atropine, Dimedrol) the usage of agents of benzodiazepine group with anti-hypoxic effects is advised. The latter may modulate the blocked ion channels by neuromediators, which are activated by GABA and GABA receptor function. The neuro-protective ability of halothane is demonstrated. To reveal the mechanisms of positive effects using benzodiazepine group for premedication we have investigated the effects of midazolam of brain cell functional activity of experimental animals (white rats) in conditions of halothane anesthesia. For the estimation of white rat brain cells functional activity the nuclear transcriptional activity was studied (based on the intensity of [14C]-UTF inclusion), also the glutamic acid decarboxilaze activity (GAD65/67) using immunohistochemistry. It is estimated that halothane inhibits the transcription in rat brain cells. During midazolam premedication the halothane inhibitory effect on RNA synthesis is not revealed. After an hour of pseudo-operation halothane also induces proved decrease of quantity of GAD65/67 positive cells in CA3 hippocampal field. At the same time the quantity of similar cells are increased in CA1 field. The increase of GAD65/67 positive cells in CA1 is more evident during midazolam premedication. Based on the data received we can conclude that the positive effect of midazolam results in increase of GAD65/67 positive cells in CA1 hippocampal field.",

To date, rational design efforts to identify potent and selective GABA(A) subtype ligands have been hampered by the absence of suitable high-throughput screening approaches. The authors describe 384-well population patch-clamp (PPC) planar array electrophysiology methods for the study of GABA(A) receptor pharmacology. In HEK293 cells stably expressing human alpha1beta3gamma2 GABA(A) channels, GABA evoked outward currents at 0 mV of 1.05 +/- 0.08 nA, measured 8 s post GABA addition. The I(GABA) was linear and reversed close to the theoretical E(Cl) (-56 mV). Concentration-response curve analysis yielded a mean pEC(50) value of 5.4 and Hill slope of 1.5, and for a series of agonists, the rank order of potency was muscimol > GABA > isoguvacine. A range of known positive modulators, including diazepam and pentobarbital, produced concentration-dependent augmentation of the GABA EC( 20) response (1 microM). The competitive antagonists bicuculline and gabazine produced concentration-dependent, parallel, rightward displacement of GABA curves with pA(2) and slope values of 5.7 and 1.0 and 6.7 and 1.0, respectively. In contrast, picrotoxin (0.2-150 microM) depressed the maximal GABA response, implying a non-competitive antagonism. Overall, the pharmacology of human alpha1beta3gamma2 GABA(A) determined by PPC was highly similar to that obtained by conventional patch-clamp methods. In small-scale single-shot screens, Z' values of >0.5 were obtained in agonist, modulator, and antagonist formats with hit rates of 0% to 3%. The authors conclude that despite the inability of the method to resolve the peak agonist responses, PPC can rapidly and usefully quantify pharmacology for the alpha1beta3gamma2 GABA(A) isoform. These data suggest that PPC may be a valuable approach for a focused set and secondary screening of GABA(A) receptors and other slow ligand-gated ion channels.",

The objective of this claims database analysis is to describe prescription and medical use in patients with newly diagnosed and established fibromyalgia. Privately insured patients with 2+ myalgia/myositis claims (1999 to 2005) were categorized as newly diagnosed or established; this dichotomy involves comparisons between prediagnosis (S1) and postdiagnosis (S2) stages in the newly diagnosed and between newly diagnosed (S2) and established patients (S3).

Then his antipsychotic drug was shifted to oral olanzapine 10 mg/day. The next day, he received intramuscular injection of olanzapine 5 mg and soon developed hypothermia, rhabdomyolysis, hypotension and bradycardia. These symptoms subsided gradually in the next 2 weeks after supportive treatment was given. Such adverse effects were not observed in the following 7 months. Possible pharmacological mechanisms were discussed. Physicians should be cautious about patients' clinical symptoms after giving olanzapine injection or rapid titration in dosage.", 
    "20": "Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), previously known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), is predominantly located in the mitochondrial outer membrane and plays an important role in steroidogenesis, immunomodulation, cell survival and proliferation. Previous studies have shown an increased expression of TSPO centrally in neuropathology, as well as in injured nerves. TSPO has also been implicated in modulation of nociception. In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that TSPO is involved in the initiation and maintenance of inflammatory pain using a rat model of Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)-induced monoarthritis of the tibio-tarsal joint. Immunohistochemistry was performed using Iba-1 (microglia), NeuN (neurons), anti-Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein, GFAP (astrocytes) and anti-PBR (TSPO) on Days 1, 7 and 14 after CFA-induced arthritis. Rats with CFA-induced monoarthritis showed mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia on the ipsilateral hindpaw, which correlated with the increased TSPO expression in ipsilateral laminae I-II on all experimental days. Iba-1 expression in the ipsilateral dorsal horn was also increased on Days 7 and 14. Moreover, TSPO was colocalized with Iba-1, GFAP and NeuN within the spinal cord dorsal horn. The TSPO agonist Ro5-4864, given intrathecally, dose-dependently retarded or prevented the development of mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in rats with CFA-induced monoarthritis. These findings provide evidence that spinal TSPO is involved in the development and maintenance of inflammatory pain behaviors in rats. Thus, spinal TSPO may present a central target as a complementary therapy to reduce inflammatory pain.", 
    "21": "Trace conditioning is considered a model of higher cognitive involvement in simple associative tasks. Studies of trace conditioning have shown that cortical areas and the hippocampal formation are required to associate events that occur at different times. However, the mechanisms that bridge the trace interval during the acquisition of trace conditioning remain unknown. In four experiments with fear conditioning in rats, we explored the involvement of the entorhinal cortex (EC) in the acquisition of fear under a trace-30 s protocol. We first determined that pretraining neurotoxic lesions of the EC selectively impaired trace-, but not delay-conditioned fear as evaluated by freezing behavior. A local cholinergic deafferentation of the EC using 192-IgG-saporin did not replicate this deficit, presumably because cholinergic interneurons were spared by the toxin. However, pretraining local blockade of EC muscarinic receptors with the M1 antagonist pirenzepine yielded a specific and dose-dependent deficit in trace-conditioned responses. The same microinjections performed after conditioning were without effect on trace fear responses. These effects of blocking M1 receptors are consistent with the notion that conditioned stimulus (CS)-elicited, acetylcholine-dependent persistent activities in the EC are needed to maintain a representation of a tone CS across the trace interval during the acquisition of trace conditioning. This function of the EC is consistent with recent views of this region as a short-term stimulus buffer.",

We reconstituted the mitochondrial targeting and insertion of TSPO into the OMM to analyze the signals and mechanisms required for this process. Initial studies indicated the formation of a mitochondrial 66 kDa complex through Blue Native-PAGE analysis. The formation of this complex was found to be dependent on the presence of ATP and the cytosolic chaperone Hsp90. Through mutational analysis we identified two areas necessary for TSPO targeting, import, and function: amino acids 103-108 (Schellman motif), which provide the necessary structural orientation for import, and the cholesterol-binding C-terminus required for insertion. Although the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex proteins Tom22 and Tom40 were present in the OMM, the TOM complex did not interact with TSPO. In search of proteins involved in TSPO import, we analyzed complexes known to interact with TSPO by mass spectrometry. Formation of the 66 kDa complex was found to be dependent on an identified protein, Metaxin 1, for formation and TSPO import. The level of import of TSPO into steroidogenic cell mitochondria was increased following treatment of the cells with cAMP. These findings suggest that the initial targeting of TSPO to mitochondria is dependent upon the presence of cytosolic chaperones interacting with the import receptor Tom70. The C-terminus plays an important role in targeting TSPO to mitochondria, whereas its import into the OMM is dependent upon the presence of the Schellman motif. Final integration of TSPO into the OMM occurs via its interaction with Metaxin 1. Import of TSPO into steroidogenic cell mitochondria is regulated by cAMP.",

    "44": "The Translocator protein (TSPO), formerly known as the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, is an 18 kDa mitochondrial protein primarily involved in steroid biosynthesis in both peripheral and glial cells. It has been extensively reported that TSPO regulates the rate-limiting translocation of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane before its transformation by cytochrome P450(scc) into pregnenolone, which is further converted into an array of different steroids. In the brain, neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone and pregnenolone, acting as positive modulators of gamma-aminobutyric type A (GABA(A)) receptors, exert anxiolytic activity. Specific ligands targeting TSPO increase neurosteroid production and for this reason they have been suggested to play an important role in anxiety modulation. Unlike benzodiazepines (Bzs), which represent the most common anti-anxiety drugs administered around the world, selective TSPO ligands have shown anxiolytic effects in animal models without any of the side effects associated with Bzs. Therefore, specific TSPO ligands that are able to promote neurosteroidogenesis may represent the future of therapeutic treatment of anxiety disorders. Furthermore, TSPO expression levels are altered in several different psychiatric disorders in which anxiety is the main symptom. This article reviews the primary and patent literature over the last decade concerning the development of novel TSPO ligands that have resulted effective in various models of anxiety, taking into special consideration their structure-activity relationships.",

The lack of adequate data had created uncertainty about the safety of CCBs in pregnancy. Teratogenicity with these agents has been demonstrated in animals, but no cases of possible human malformation or deformity have been reported. Data from human studies suggest that CCBs may cause a clinically insignificant fall in maternal mean arterial pressure, but have little to no effect on uterine perfusion. In many countries, CCBs remain unlicensed for use in pregnancy and it is unlikely the manufacturers will ever apply for this status to change.

The presence of involuntarily consumed medications and drugs of abuse is demonstrated by routine toxicological analysis only in relatively few cases (ca. 2%). The substances most commonly found are benzodiazepines, followed by other hypnotics. In Europe, the illegal substance gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB, \"Liquid Ecstasy\"), often mentioned as a \"date-rape drug,\" is only rarely detected with sufficient medicolegal certainty. This may be due to its rapid elimination (it is detectable in blood for up to 8 hours, in urine for up to 12 hours) as well as its physiological occurrence in the body. If the toxicological analysis of blood and urine is negative in a case of suspected DFSA, then the analysis of a hair sample about four weeks after the assault can detect the presence of drugs consumed at that time. If the victim has long hair, it may be possible to detect knock-out drugs taken more than four weeks earlier. In Europe, convictions for drug-facilitated crimes are comparatively rare, mainly because of the difficulty of demonstrating conclusive evidence.",

All patients were treated with 0.75 to 1.3 g of racemic CYC as a 2-hour infusion and with 1 mg intravenous midazolam as a drug-metabolizing marker. CYC enantiomers and midazolam concentrations in plasma were measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The following differences (Wilcoxon test, P < or = .05) were observed between the (S)-(-) and (R)-(+) enantiomers: AUC(0-infinity) 152.41 vs 129.25 microg.h/mL, CL 3.28 vs 3.89 L/h, Vd 31.38 vs 29.74 L, and t((1/2)) 6.79 vs 5.56 h for group 1 and AUC(0-infinity) 167.20 vs 139.08 microg.h/mL, CL 2.99 vs 3.59 L/h, and t((1/2)) 6.15 vs 4.99 h for group 2. No differences (Mann test, P < or = .05) were observed between groups 1 and 2 in the pharmacokinetic parameters of both enantiomers. No significant relationship was observed between midazolam clearance (2.92-16.40 mL/min.kg) and clearance of each CYC enantiomer. In conclusion, CYC kinetic disposition is enantioselective, resulting in higher exposures of the (S)-(-) enantiomer in lupus nephritis patients, and the pharmacokinetic parameters of both enantiomers are not altered by the worsening of renal condition.", 
    "66": "Translocator protein 18 kDa, the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor by its earlier name, is a mitochondrial membrane protein associated with the mitochondrial permeability pore. While the function of the protein is not properly understood, it is known to play roles in necrotic and apoptotic processes of the neural tissue. In the healthy adult brain, TSPO expression is restricted to glial cells. In developing or damaged neural regions, however, TSPO appears in differentiating/regenerating neurons. Using immunocytochemical, molecular biological and cell biological techniques, we demonstrate that TSPO mRNA and protein, while missing from mature neurons, are present in neural stem cells and also in postmitotic neuronal precursors. Investigating some distinct stages of in vitro differentiation of NE-4C neural stem cells, TSPO 18 kDa was found to be repressed in a relatively late phase of neuron formation, when mature neuron-specific features appear. This timing indicates that mitochondria in fully developed neurons display specific characteristics and provides an additional marker for characterising neuronal differentiation.",

The ideal sedative agent for functional MRI (fMRI) should only minimally hamper the neurophysiologic effect of the administered sensorial stimulation. This study compares the effect of propofol and midazolam on the fMRI auditory activation pattern in children. Fourteen children in the 3 to 7 year age group without neurologic or auditory deficits were randomly assigned to receive propofol or midazolam for sedation during auditory fMRI. Two patients in the midazolam group were excluded due to positive baseline MRIs. The children were stimulated using a passive listening task. The fMRI signal was modeled using various functions (hemodynamic response function, temporal derivative, and dispersion derivative) to check for the differing temporal characteristics of the signal between the groups. Patients in the propofol group showed activation only in the primary auditory cortex and exhibited a pattern more similar to that of nonsedated adults. Patients in the midazolam group exhibited a more complex pattern, presenting activation areas other than the primary auditory cortex; a delay in the functional response and higher duration variability were also observed. Our sample sizes are too small to derive a conclusive inference. Our preliminary study encourages the hypothesis that propofol is preferable to midazolam to maintain sedation in 3 to 7-year-old children during auditory fMRI because it facilitates the elicitation of a more focused auditory cortical activation pattern with less temporal and spatial dispersion.", 
    "74": "The objective of this study was to assess the impact of high levels of insomnia on response to pregabalin (PGB) in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Pooled data were analyzed from six double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4- to 6-week trials of outpatients who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition) criteria for GAD with a minimum Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) score = 18. Response was evaluated for three fixed-dose PGB groups (150, 300-450, 600 mg/day), and for a benzodiazepine group (alprazolam or lorazepam). A 'high-insomnia' subgroup was defined by a baseline HAM for Depression (HAM-D) insomnia factor score greater than 3 (maximum = 6). At baseline, 1002 (54%) patients met the criteria for the high-insomnia subgroup, and 852 (46%) for the low-insomnia subgroup. Mean baseline HAM-A scores were 1-2 points higher in high-insomnia versus low-insomnia patients. In high-insomnia patients, PGB produced significantly greater improvement in HAM-A total scores at last observation carried forward endpoint on 300-450 mg (-13.1+/-0.6) and 600 mg (-11.2+/-0.5) dose groups compared with placebo (-8.3+/-0.5; P<0.0001 for both comparisons); the improvement on PGB 150 mg was not significant (-9.9+/-0.7; P = 0.051). Improvement was significant in the benzodiazepine group (-11.0+/-0.6; P<0.0001). In the high-insomnia subgroup, treatment with PGB significantly (P<0.001) improved the HAM-D insomnia factor scores on both the 300-450 mg (-2.73) and 600 mg (-2.35) doses, and on benzodiazepines (-2.52) compared with placebo (-1.51); improvement on PGB 150 mg (-1.69) was not significant. Rates of treatment-emergent insomnia were lower on PGB compared with placebo in both the high- and low-insomnia subgroups. In conclusion, PGB was well tolerated, and improved overall anxiety symptoms, while specifically improving insomnia in patients with GAD presenting with high levels of concurrent insomnia.",

Seventy-six patients with schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (diagnosis < 5 y), and a maximum lifetime antipsychotic treatment < 16 weeks participated in the study. Efficacy of ziprasidone (80-160 mg/d) and olanzapine 10-20 mg was measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale, the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS), and the Heinrich Quality of Life Scale (HQLS); tolerability assessments included laboratory assessments, body weight, and electroencephalogram.",

Ziprasidone was associated with decreasing levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, and transaminases, while these parameters increased in the olanzapine group (all P values < .05). There were no significant differences in fasting glucose and prolactin levels or in cardiac or sexual side effects. Patients on ziprasidone used biperiden for extrapyramidal side effects more frequently (P < .05).",

    "79": "Most antianxiety drugs (anxiolytics) work by modulating neurotransmitters in the brain. Benzodiazepines are fast and effective anxiolytic drugs; however, their long-term use is limited by the development of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. Ligands of the translocator protein [18 kilodaltons (kD)] may promote the synthesis of endogenous neurosteroids, which also exert anxiolytic effects in animal models. Here, we found that the translocator protein (18 kD) ligand XBD173 enhanced gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated neurotransmission and counteracted induced panic attacks in rodents in the absence of sedation and tolerance development. XBD173 also exerted antipanic activity in humans and, in contrast to benzodiazepines, did not cause sedation or withdrawal symptoms. Thus, translocator protein (18 kD) ligands are promising candidates for fast-acting anxiolytic drugs with less severe side effects than benzodiazepines.", 
    "80": "The tachykinin NK(3) receptor shows promise as a novel target for antipsychotics, but knowledge of downstream activity following tachykinin NK(3) receptor activation is lacking. To determine the practical utility of senktide-induced tail whips in mice as a tool for determining and characterizing downstream activity following tachykinin NK(3) receptor activation, mice were injected with 0.05 nmol of senktide i.c.v. and the number of tail whip bouts was counted for 20 min. Strain differences were observed, with NMRI mice showing a stronger tail whip response than C57Bl/6J mice. Tachykinin NK(3) receptor specificity was confirmed by the absence of the senktide-induced tail whip response in tachykinin NK(3) receptor knockout mice. Effects of tachykinin receptor pharmacological agents were tested by pretreatment with tachykinin NK(3) receptor antagonists (SB222200, talnetant and osanetant), which attenuated senktide-induced tail whips, and the tachykinin NK(1) receptor antagonist MK869, which had no effect on senktide-induced tail whips. Pharmacological interactions with other neurotransmitter systems were determined by pretreatment with dopamine D(1), D(2), and D(3) receptor antagonists, atypical antipsychotics, serotonin 5HT(1a) receptor antagonists, serotonin 5HT(2a/c) receptor antagonists, benzodiazepine and putative anxiolytics, antidepressants, and an anticholinergic. Senktide-induced tail whips were attenuated by dopamine D(2) receptor antagonists, atypical antipsychotics, serotonin 5HT(2a/c) antagonists, and benzodiazepine anxiolytics, but unaffected by drugs from other classes. Thus, the senktide-induced tail whip response is easily quantifiable, specific to the tachykinin NK(3) receptor, and provides valuable information on the downstream pharmacology of tachykinin NK(3) receptor activation.",

Approximately, two-thirds of the users (67%) were students or currently working and 32% were unemployed. Twenty-two percent of the cannabis users received unemployment, welfare or disability benefits and 11% declared no source of revenue. Most of the users (63%) decided on their own to seek care at the setting. Seventy-three percent of the subjects had seen a psychologist or a psychiatrist in the past, with or without relation to cannabis use. By far, most of the users were cannabis dependent (82%) and 9% cannabis abusers in the last 12 months according to DSM-IV criteria prior to their visit. Seven percent of the cannabis users had alcohol dependence and 7% were abusers. The 12 months prevalence of cocaine or ecstasy dependence was 2% and the prevalence of benzodiazepines, heroin or stimulants dependence 1%. The main substances used over lifetime were tobacco (99%); alcohol (96%); cocaine (41%); benzodiazepines and hypnotics (41%); ecstasy (40%) and heroin (23%). Four percent of cannabis users had a history of intravenous drug use. The main consumption mode of cannabis in France is the blunt. About three-quarters of the consumption is in the form of resin (hashish) and one-quarter as marijuana (grass). The average consumption of cannabis in the last six months was equivalent to 5.8 blunts per day (S.D.=4.4) and 12 g per week (S.D.=10.5), and the average monthly cost was 159 euro (S.D.=133) (234 USD, S.D.=196). The prevalence of psychiatric disorders according to DSM-IV criteria in the sample is high. A current mood disorder was present in 48% and an anxiety disorder in 55% of the cannabis users in the last 12 months. The prevalence of affective disorders in the last 12 months was major depressive disorder (38%), dysthymia (19%), hypomania (3%) and mania (1%). The prevalence of anxiety disorders in the last 12 months was social phobia (29%); generalised anxiety disorder (17%); panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (16%); obsessive compulsive disorder (12%); agoraphobia without panic disorder (9%) and post-traumatic stress disorder (5%). The prevalence of schizophrenia was 4%. The prevalence of bulimia was 4% and no anorexia. Women are more likely to report an affective disorder (64% versus 41%; p=0.04) or a post-traumatic stress disorder (17% versus 0%; p<0.001) in the last 12 months. The prevalence of family history for psychiatric disorders was 52% and for addiction, 59%.",

Indeed, other than tobacco dependence, 80% of the users were only dependent on, or abused on cannabis in the last 12 months. In comparison with the cohort of French cannabis users (n=4202) seen at specific outpatient settings for marijuana users in 2005, cannabis users seen in Lariboisi\u00e8re Hospital are older, the percentage of females is greater, they are more dependent on marijuana and have a high prevalence of affective and anxiety disorders.", 
    "86": "In spite of its seriousness, dependence on alcohol and benzodiazepines during substitution treatment are poorly documented. Its frequency is nonetheless significant. According to studies, between one and two thirds of patients are affected. This consumption is under verbalized by patients and underestimated by carers. In one study, where the average diazepam doses were from 40 to 45 mg per day, 30% of the patients were taking 70 to 300 mg per day, two thirds having experimented with a fixed dose of 100mg. Benzodiazepines, especially diazepam and flunitrazepam, were studied versus placebo. Thus, 10 to 20mg of diazepam gave rise to euphoria, a sensation of being drugged, sedation and lessening of cognitive performance. The aim of this consumption is to potentiate the euphoria induced by opioids, a \"boost\" effect during the hour after taking it, or the calming of the outward signs of withdrawal. The most sought after molecules are the most sedative, those with pronounced plasmatic peaks, and the most accessible.", 
    "87": "In multidependant subjects, opioid dependence had been earlier in adolescence, with a number of therapeutic failures. They had been faced with repetitive rejection and separation during childhood, medicolegal and social problems. Somatization, depression, anxiety and psychotic disorders are frequent in this subgroup. Heavy drinkers under methadone treatment are highly vulnerable to cocaine. Their behaviour is at risk, with exchange of syringes; their survival rate is 10 years less than that of moderate consumers of alcohol. Most are single, with a previous prison, psychiatric or addictive cursus and they present significant psychological vulnerability. For some authors, benzodiazepines indicate a psychiatric comorbidity. Methadone significantly reduces the consumption of alcohol by nonalcoholic heroin addicts. Although alcohol is an enzymatic inductor of methadone catabolism, with bell-shaped methadone plasma curves over 24 hours, a substitution treatment is recommended. It has a minimum impact on care, in spite of efficiency and retention in therapeutical programs, allowing the subject's inclusion in the framework of a more regular and sustained medical follow-up. Treatment of benzodiazepine dependence by a progressive regression of doses has little efficacy in subjects which cannot control how much medication they are taking. Certain authors have suggested maintenance treatments of clonezepam. The most appropriate therapeutic propositions are: (1) maintenance of therapeutic links though a framework of deliverance from flexible substitution treatment; (2) prevention by cautious prescribing and control of dispensing medication; (3) parallel treatment of psychiatric comorbidities and related personality disorders; (4) individual psychiatric treatment, either institutional or in consistent networks.", 
    "88": "Our earlier studies have demonstrated that (1S,3R,4S)-1-aminocyclo-pentane-1,3,4-tricarboxylic acid ACPT-I, a group III mGlu receptor agonist, produced anxiolytic-like and antidepressant-like actions after central administration. Here we describe the anxiolytic-like effects of ACPT-I after intraperitoneal administration in the stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH), elevated plus-maze (PMT) tests in mice and in the Vogel test in rats. However, the compound did not produce antidepressant-like effects in the tail suspension test (TST) or in the forced swim test (FST) in mice. The potential anxiolytic effect of ACPT-I (20 mg/kg) in the SIH test was inhibited by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (given i.p., 10 mg/kg), and by a 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist N-{2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl}-N-(2-pyridynyl) cyclohexane-carboxamide (WAY100635) (0.1 mg/kg s.c.). At the same time, ritanserin (0.5 mg/kg i.p.), the 5-HT2A/C receptor antagonist, did not change the anxiolytic-like effects of ACPT-I. The results of these studies indicate that the GABA-ergic and serotonergic systems are involved in the potential anxiolytic action of ACPT-I.",

Misconceptions and worrying over the lack of sleep and its consequences can contribute to reinforcing these disorders; (2) How can patients who complain of poor-quality sleep be helped, without resorting to treatments that can have adverse effects? To answer this question, we conducted a systematic review of the literature based on the standard Prescrire procedure; (3) One effective approach is to explain the basic physiology of sleep, to discuss misconceptions, and to adopt a strategy of \"stimulus control\". This method has a similar efficacy to prescribing a benzodiazepine. and the effect is longer lasting; (4) Moderate, regular physical exercise, especially in the morning, seems to help some patients, but the evidence is weak; (5) Some clinical trials of phytotherapy have shown a positive risk-benefit balance of weak aqueous or hydroalcoholic valerian extracts. Efficacy is limited, however; (6) A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials showed that benzodiazepines and related drugs increase the duration of sleep and help patients to fall asleep sooner. However, none of these trials provides comparative data spanning periods of more than two weeks. Efficacy is uncertain in the longer term, as patients quickly develop a tolerance to the hypnotic effects of benzodiazepines; (7) The adverse effects of benzodiazepines include frequent memory disorders, daytime drowsiness, falls, fractures and road accidents, and a withdrawal syndrome after treatment cessation. Related drugs such as zolpidem and zopiclone provoke similar adverse effects; (8) Sedative antihistamines have not been as well-evaluated as benzodiazepines in this setting. Small comparative trials of doxylamine and diphenhydramine showed no major difference in efficacy versus benzodiazepines and related drugs.

No significant differences among the four groups were apparent for respiratory rate. PaCO2-MV response plots were derived from linear regression analysis of data for mean MV and mean PaCO2 at each FiCO2 to compute apneic CO2 thresholds and CO2 sensitivities. The apneic CO2 thresholds of Groups P and M were larger than those of Groups C and D. The CO2 sensitivities of Group D were slightly lower than in Group C. No similar significant difference between the CO2 sensitivities of other group pairs was apparent. MAP in Group D was lower than in Groups C and M.

    "111": "Glutamate released from synaptic vesicles mediates excitatory neurotransmission by stimulating glutamate receptors. Glutamate transporters maintain low synaptic glutamate levels critical for this process, a role primarily attributed to astrocytes. Recently, vesicular release of glutamate from unmyelinated axons in the rat corpus callosum has been shown to elicit AMPA receptor-mediated currents in glial progenitor cells. Glutamate transporters are the only mechanism of glutamate clearance, yet very little is known about the role of glutamate transporters in normal development of oligodendrocytes (OLs) or in excitotoxic injury to OLs. We found that OLs in culture are capable of sodium-dependent glutamate uptake with a K(m) of 10 +/- 2 microm and a V(max) of 2.6, 5.0, and 3.8 nmol x min(-1) x mg(-1) for preoligodendrocytes, immature, and mature OLs, respectively. Surprisingly, EAAC1, thought to be exclusively a neuronal transporter, contributes more to [(3)H]l-glutamate uptake in OLs than GLT1 or GLAST. These data suggest that glutamate transporters on oligodendrocytes may serve a critical role in maintaining glutamate homeostasis at a time when unmyelinated callosal axons are engaging in glutamatergic signaling with glial progenitors. Furthermore, GLT1 was significantly increased in cultured mature OLs contrary to in vivo data in which we have shown that, although GLT1 is present on developing OLs when unmyelinated axons are prevalent in the developing rat corpus callosum, after myelination, GLT1 is not expressed on mature OLs. The absence of GLT1 in mature OLs in the rat corpus callosum and its presence in mature rat cultured OLs may indicate that a signaling process in vivo is not activated in vitro.",

Stable outpatients with persistent symptoms or troublesome side effects were switched using one of three 1-week taper/switch strategies as determined by the investigator. Efficacy was assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score, Clinical Global Impression, Positive and Negative Symptom Scale, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale, and tolerability by using standard measures of weight change, extrapyramidal symptoms, and laboratory findings. Suboptimal efficacy was the primary reason for switching. The preferred switch strategy was immediate discontinuation, and the preferred dosing regimen was 120 mg/day. Completer rates were 68, 60, and 86% in the haloperidol, risperidone, and olanzapine pre-switch groups, respectively. At week 12, a switch to ziprasidone resulted in statistically significant improvement from baseline on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score, Clinical Global Impression-Improvement, Positive and Negative Symptom Scale, and Global Assessment of Functioning scales, reduction in extrapyramidal symptoms and a neutral impact on metabolic parameters. Switch from olanzapine and risperidone resulted in weight reduction and from haloperidol in some weight increase. In conclusion, oral ziprasidone of 80-160 mg/day with food was a clinically valuable treatment option for stable patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder experiencing suboptimal efficacy or poor tolerability with haloperidol, olanzapine, or risperidone.", 
    "133": "Interactive context processing is a cognitive ability that is altered in psychotic states, including schizophrenia. This deficit has been linked to prefrontal cortical dysfunction in humans. The degraded contingency effect (DCE) is a simple form of interactive context processing by which contextual information interferes with a target conditioned stimulus for control over conditioned responding. We have previously shown that the DCE was disrupted by the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine and that this disruption was specifically restored by cholinergic drugs displaying an antipsychotic-like profile, such as physostigmine or xanomeline. The DCE was selectively associated with an increase in Fos immunoreactivity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), an increase that was not observed in the presence of atropine. Here, we set out to test the actions of typical, atypical and potential antipsychotics on atropine-induced disruption of the DCE and the related mPFC Fos-immunoreactivity profile. Low doses of haloperidol, olanzapine, clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine reversed atropine-induced disruption of the DCE, but with different dose-dependent curves (linear shapes for haloperidol and N-desmethylclozapine, inverted U shapes for olanzapine and clozapine). The level of Fos within the mPFC paralleled the pharmacological profile of the different drugs. Compared to contingent control groups, an increased level of Fos immunoreactivity within the mPFC was observed only with doses that reversed atropine-induced disruption of the DCE. These results suggest that the deficit of interactive context processing, which is a hallmark of psychotic states, might originate from a mere deficit of fundamental associative processes. This deficit might result from a cholinergic blockade of the PFC.",

Within just a few years, its initial concept aimed at production of libraries containing huge number of compounds (thousands to millions), so called screening libraries, has shifted towards preparation of small and medium-sized rationally designed libraries. When applicable, the use of solid supports for the generation of libraries has been a real breakthrough in enhancing productivity. With a limited amount of resin and simple manual workups, the split/mix procedure may generate thousands of bead-tethered compounds. Beads can be chemically or physically encoded to facilitate the identification of a hit after the biological assay. Compartmentalization of solid supports using small reactors like teabags, kans or pellicular discrete supports like Lanterns resulted in powerful sort and combine technologies, relying on codes 'written' on the reactor, and thus reducing the need for automation and improving the number of compounds synthesized. These methods of solid-phase combinatorial chemistry have been recently supported by introduction of solid-supported reagents and scavenger resins. The first part of this review discusses the general premises of combinatorial chemistry and some methods used in the design of primary and focused combinatorial libraries. The aim of the second part is to present combinatorial chemistry methodologies aimed at discovering bioactive compounds acting on diverse GPCR involved in central nervous system disorders.",

For the assessment of pharmacological and genetic experimental disease models, conventional social interaction tasks bear the uncertainty that any drug-induced abnormality of the investigator may feed back to the drug-free companion modifying its reactions. A considerable technical improvement was recently reported by Moy et al. [Moy SS, Nadler JJ, Perez A, Barbaro RP, Johns JM, Magnuson T, et al. Sociability and preference for social novelty in five inbred strains: an approach to assess autistic-like behaviours in mice. Genes Brain Behav 2004;3:287-302] in which the drug free partner is confined to a small cage and social contacts of the investigator are recorded uncontaminated of any social reactions of the stranger. Using this novel behavioural paradigm, we here show in C57Bl/6 female mice that sociability (social interaction with a stranger mouse) is not impaired after administration of the anxiolytic diazepam (0.1-1 mg/kg) or the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine hydrobromide (0.1-1 mg/kg). However, social memory tested after a short time interval was impaired by both drugs in a dose-dependent manner (diazepam: > or = 0.5mg/kg; scopolamine: > or = 0.3mg/kg). The scopolamine-induced short-term memory deficit was reversed to normal by the choline esterase inhibitor donepezil (1 mg/kg). Given this dependence of social recognition on the cholinergic system, combined with the clinical observation of reduced social contacts in dementia patients, sociability may offer a novel endpoint biomarker with translational value in experimental models of cognitive dysfunction.",

Because many PET centers would benefit from a longer-lived (18)F-labeled radioligand (half-life, 110 min), the objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of a closely related aryloxyanilide ((18)F-N-fluoroacetyl-N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxyaniline [(18)F-PBR06]) to quantify TSPOs in the healthy human brain.", 
    "173": "A total of 9 human subjects were injected with (18)F-PBR06 (approximately 185 MBq) and scanned for 5 h, with rest periods outside the camera. The concentrations of (18)F-PBR06, separated from radiometabolites, were measured in arterial plasma.", 
    "174": "Modeling of regional brain and plasma data showed that a 2-tissue-compartment model was superior to a 1-tissue-compartment model. Even if data for all time points were used for the fitting, concentrations of brain activity measured with PET were consistently greater than the modeled values at late (280-300 min) but not at early time points. The greater values may have been caused by the slow accumulation of radiometabolites in the brain. To determine an adequate time for more accurate measurement of distribution volume (V(T)), which is the summation of receptor binding and nondisplaceable activity, we investigated which scan duration would be associated with maximal or near-maximal identifiability. We found that a scan of 120 min provided the best identifiability of V(T) (approximately 2%). The images showed no significant defluorination.", 
    "175": "(18)F-PBR06 can quantify TSPOs in the healthy human brain using 120 min of image acquisition and concurrent measurements of radioligand in plasma. Although brain activity is likely contaminated with radiometabolites, the percentage contamination is thought to be small (<10%), because values of distribution volume are stable during 60-120 min and vary by less than 10%. (18)F-PBR06 is a longer-lived and promising alternative to (11)C-labeled radioligands to measure TSPOs as a biomarker of inflammation in the brain.",

However, there was no correlation between BP(ND) and V(T) because of the interindividual variation of K(1)/k(2). BP(ND) obtained with data from a scan time of 60 min was in good agreement with that from a scan time of 90 min (r = 0.87).", 
    "179": "Regional distribution of (11)C-AC-5216 was in good agreement with previous PET studies of PBRs in the human brain. BP(ND) is more appropriate for estimating (11)C-AC-5216 binding than is V(T) because of the interindividual variation of K(1)/k(2). (11)C-AC-5216 is a promising PET ligand for quantifying PBR in the human brain.",

In the present study, we have used local injections paradigm, in order to localize structures implied in anxiolytic-like effects of two drugs in na\u00efve and experienced mice: a benzodiazepine, diazepam that is only active in na\u00efve mice; and a 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist, DOI that exert its anxiolytic-like effect both in na\u00efve and experienced mice. Periacqueductal grey substance, three sub-regions of hippocampus (CA1, CA2 and CA3) and two nuclei of amygdala (BLA and LA) have been studied. Local injections did not cause any modifications of ambulatory activity. DOI injections elicit anxiolytic-like effects only when injected into CA2, in na\u00efve and experienced mice. Diazepam had an anxiolytic-like effect in na\u00efve mice, only when injected into lateral nucleus of amygdala; and in experienced mice when injected into PAG. These results help us to better understand the way of action of these two compounds and the structures functionally involved in their effects and in one-trial tolerance (OTT).", 
    "186": "This review gives an overview of those in vivo imaging studies on synaptic neurotransmission, which so far have been performed on patients with movement disorders and/or dementia. Thereby, the focus is on disease-related deficiencies within the functional entity of the dopaminergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic or opioid synapse. In vivo investigations have yielded highly consistent results on the dysfunction of synaptic constituents in the majority of diseases covered by this overview. Findings show presynaptic dysfunctions in idiopathic as well as early-onset Parkinson's disease with decreases in striatal dopamine synthesis (57 out of a total of 59 reports on both types of Parkinson's disease), storage (nine out of nine reports), release (two out of three reports) and transporter binding (95 out of 95 reports). In contrast, the \"Parkinson plus\" syndromes multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy are characterized by both pre- and postsynaptic deficiencies with reductions in striatal dopamine synthesis (11 out of a total of 11 reports on both types of \"Parkinson plus\" syndromes), storage (four of four reports), and transporter binding (27 out of 27 reports) as well as D1 (two out of two reports) and D2 receptor binding (34 out of 36 reports). This does not hold for the \"Parkinson plus\" syndromes dementia with Lewy bodies and corticobasal degeneration. For these diseases, for the time being, firm evidence of alterations in D1 and/or D2 receptor binding is lacking. In patients with Huntington's disease, mainly postsynaptic dysfunctions with reductions of striatal D1 (six out of six reports) and D2 receptor binding (15 out of 15 reports) were observed. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by both pre-and postsynaptic deficiencies of the cholinergic system with decreases of cortical acetylcholine storage (one out of two reports) and both musarinic (seven out of 10 reports) and nicotinic cholinergic receptor binding (three out of six reports). Moreover, reductions in cortical (one out of three reports) and limbic 5-HT1A (three out of three reports) and cortical (four out of four reports) and limbic 5-HT2A receptor binding (one out of two reports) were observed. Moreover, there is evidence for a cortical (four out of six reports) and cingulate (three out of three reports) increase of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor binding indicative of microglial activation. In the majority of investigations on patients with Alzheimer's disease, no alterations of presynaptic dopamine function were found, whereas all other forms of dementia including corticobasal degeneration, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease dementia and frontotemporal dementia were characterized by presynaptic dopaminergic deficiencies with reductions in striatal dopamine synthesis (10 out of a total of 10 reports on these types of dementia), storage (four out of four reports) and transporter binding (29 out of 29 reports). Taken together, in vivo imaging methods can be employed for the diagnosis of idiopathic and early-onset Parkinson's disease as well as \"Parkinson plus\" syndromes and Huntington's disease. Moreover, differentiation is feasible between, firstly, Parkinson's disease and the \"Parkinson plus\" syndromes multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, secondly, multiple system atrophy/progressive supranuclear palsy and the other \"Parkinson plus\" syndromes dementia with Lewy bodies and corticobasal degeneration, and, thirdly, Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.", 
    "187": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a common pediatric neurologic emergency that requires rapid assessment and management. Treatment of pediatric SE involves two equally important factors. First, rapid identification of the underlying etiology is essential, as decisions on how to treat and prognosticate depend on the cause of SE. Second, the timing of treatment initiation with adequate doses is crucial, as early action is most effective in terminating SE and decreasing morbidity and mortality. Currently, early treatment with adequate doses of a benzodiazepine is appropriate, followed by treatment with phenytoin, phenobarbital, or valproic acid. If the seizure does not stop or repetitive seizures continue, the addition of other medications (eg, levetiracetam) or pharmacologic coma induction may be indicated. This review evaluates treatment protocols for acute SE, prolonged SE, and nonconvulsive SE, including some management strategies that use newer anticonvulsants.", 
    "188": "In principle, the use of anticonvulsant drugs does not differ between acute and remote symptomatic seizures, but control of acute symptomatic seizures requires simultaneous treatment of the underlying etiology. Prevention of remote seizures when the risk is known to be high has been the subject of intense efforts at antiepileptogenesis, but the optimal duration of treatment after an injury is not yet known. Appropriate evaluation of a seizure depends on individual circumstances, but findings on examination, laboratory tests (serum electrolytes, magnesium, glucose, assessment of hepatic and renal function), and brain imaging (CT scan or MRI) are necessary to determine the most likely cause. Lumbar puncture is always required when there is suspicion of meningitis or encephalitis. Preferred medications for treatment of acute symptomatic seizures or status epilepticus are those available for intravenous use, such as benzodiazepines, fosphenytoin or phenytoin, valproate, levetiracetam, and phenobarbital. Diazepam is also available as a gel for rectal administration. Seizures that occur in patients with epilepsy because of missed antiepileptic drugs or inadequate serum levels should be treated with additional doses of their regular medications; loading doses can be administered with minimal toxicity in tolerant patients. Surgery is rarely necessary in the acute setting except for intracerebral lesions with rapidly rising intracranial pressure and impending herniation. After seizures are controlled, the provoking condition must also be determined and treated.",

Other outcomes, classified as nonresolution of ADRB, self-discharged or discharged by the ORC for inability to adhere to the opioid treatment agreement (N = 86, 44.1%) and acceptance of referral for addiction treatment (N = 20, 10.2%). A history of cocaine abuse increased the odds of failing the program by five times (odds ratio [OR] = 4.97, P = 0.001). Each additional pain diagnosis reduced the odds of failure by 16% (OR = 0.837, P = 0.008).

    "196": "During reward expectation, both, patients with schizophrenia and healthy control subjects, showed activation of the ventral striatum and midbrain in the vicinity of the ventral tegmental area. Significant categorical group differences emerged in the anterior cingulate cortex with only healthy controls showing increasing activation with increasing reward. In the patients, activation of this region was inversely correlated with positive symptoms. During outcome, both, patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls, showed activation of the ventral striatum and the mesial prefrontal cortex. Significant categorical group differences emerged in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex for the salience contrast with healthy controls showing a U-shaped activation curve, i.e., higher activation for either omission or receipt of reward compared to no reward.",

    "198": "Conformational changes in proteins are fundamental to all biological functions. In protein science, the concept of protein flexibility is widely used to describe protein dynamics and thermodynamic properties that control protein conformational changes. In this study, we show that urea, which has strong sedative potency, can be administered to fish at high concentrations, and that protein functional changes related to anesthesia induction can be measured in vivo. Ctenopharyngodon idellus (the grass carp) has two different types of N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, urea-insensitive and urea-sensitive, which are responsible for the heat endurance of fish. The urea-sensitive NMDA receptor showed high protein flexibility, the gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor showed less flexibility, and the protein that is responsible for ethanol anesthesia showed the lowest flexibility. The results suggest that an increase in protein flexibility underlies the fundamental biophysical mechanisms of volatile general anesthetics.",

Animals in group K-P were induced with intramuscular injections of ketamine 5 mg kg and pentobarbital 20 mg kg body weight, and those in group P were induced with pentobarbital 30 mg kg alone. After intubation and intravenous catheterization, group K-P was maintained by continuous infusion of ketamine and pentobarbital, and pentobarbital was withdrawn after cardiopulmonary bypass started. Group P received a continuous infusion of pentobarbital throughout the operation. In addition, both groups were injected hourly with midazolam and pipecuronium bolus to achieve optimal surgical conditions.",

Clinical presentations are variable ranging from an abnormal sleep pattern to somnolence and deep coma. Decerebrate and decorticate posturing, have been rarely reported with hepatic encephalopathy. We report a case of a 59-year-old-man with a history of Child-Pugh B liver disease secondary to chronic alcoholism who was admitted because of coma. He had a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt 3 months prior to his presentation. He was found to have decerebrating posture.

Stupor and fast activity have been related to the effects on gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors mediated by endozepines or by exogenous drugs such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates. The action of valproate in GABA metabolism and in GABA neuronal networks could produce a similar result through a hyperrecruitment of GABA-mediated postsynaptic transmission.", 
    "205": "Congenital myasthenic syndrome is difficult to diagnose, especially in the neonate when classic myasthenic signs may not be present. Congenital myasthenic syndrome with episodic apnea is a rare cause of recurrent apnea in infancy. We present an infant with nine severe episodes of apnea in her first 6 months who underwent a prolonged evaluation before ptosis was evident, leading to a diagnosis of choline acetyltransferase deficiency, a form of congenital myasthenic syndrome. Midazolam appeared to resolve the apnea on five occasions. The diagnosis was supported by edrophonium testing and repetitive nerve stimulation. Mutation analysis demonstrated compound heterozygous p.T354M and p.A557T mutations, the latter of which is novel. The patient's respiratory status stabilized on pyridostigmine, and she is ambulatory at age 3 years. Pyridostigmine is the primary therapy for choline acetyltransferase deficiency, but the efficacy of midazolam during this patient's episodes of apnea is interesting, and warrants further study.", 
    "206": "Stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH) is the transient rise in body temperature after encountering a stressor. The SIH response can be blocked by administration of various anxiolytic drugs prior to inducing stress. However, a drug injection involves handling and injection stress and therefore induces a SIH response itself. In the standard SIH test, drugs are therefore injected 60 min before stress induction to allow injection-induced hyperthermia to decline. This makes it difficult to study putative anxiolytic compounds with a short half-life. The present study therefore aimed to compare the effects of standard (stressful) and stress-free anxiolytic drug administration on the subsequent SIH response with a 10-minute injection-stressor interval.", 
    "207": "Anxiolytic drugs with short half-lives (midazolam, 8-OH-DPAT, nicotine) were injected subcutaneously in rats using either a stressful (manual injection) or stress-free injection (subcutaneous cannula) method 10 min before novel cage stress. Body temperature and locomotor activity were measured using telemetric transmitters.", 
    "208": "Stressful and stress-free drug administration resulted in comparable drug effects on the stress-induced hyperthermia and locomotor responses in rats.", 
    "209": "The present study shows that both stressful and stress-free drug injection shortly before a stressor results in reproducible attenuation of the SIH response in rats. In rats, a short injection-stressor interval can therefore be applied using the SIH model, enabling the study of putative anxiolytic drugs with short half-lives.", 
    "210": "Although it has been well established that GABA(A) receptors are molecular targets of a variety of allosteric modulators, such as benzodiazepines, the pharmacological properties of presynaptic GABA(A) receptors are poorly understood. In this study, the effects of diazepam and Zn(2+) on presynaptic GABA(A) receptors have been investigated by measuring the GABA(A) receptor-mediated facilitation of spontaneous glutamate release in mechanically dissociated rat CA3 pyramidal neurons. Diazepam significantly enhanced the muscimol-induced facilitation (particularly at submicromolar concentrations) of spontaneous glutamate release and shifted the concentration-response relationship for muscimol toward the left, whereas Zn(2+) (<OR= 100 muM) had little effect on the muscimol-induced facilitation of spontaneous glutamate release. In contrast, Zn(2+) significantly suppressed the muscimol-induced currents mediated by GABA(A) receptors expressed on dentate gyrus granule cells, which are parent neurons of mossy fibers, whereas the effect of diazepam on GABA(A) receptors expressed on dentate gyrus granule cells was lesser than that on presynaptic GABA(A) receptors. The results suggest that the pharmacological properties of GABA(A) receptors differ considerably between presynaptic (axon terminals) and somatic regions in the same granule cell and that presynaptic GABA(A) receptors should be considered as one of the important pharmacological targets of many drugs affecting GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "211": "Benzodiazepines are commonly prescribed for the therapy of disorders such as anxiety and sleep disturbance, but develop dependence in many patients.

    "212": "Drug interactions occur frequently with triazole antifungal agents because of their properties as inhibitors of 1 or more phase 1 (cytochrome P450) biotransformation enzymes and, possibly, as inhibitors or substrates of a phase 2 biotransformation enzyme or transporter protein. Multimorbid patients, including those with hematologic malignancies or other cancers, hematopoietic stem cell or organ transplant recipients, patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, and those in the intensive care unit, are at increased risk for drug interactions because they typically require several concomitant medications. They may also be extremely vulnerable to the clinical signs and symptoms of drug interactions. This review describes clinically significant drug interactions most frequently seen in multimorbid patients who receive systemic therapy with triazole antifungals for the prophylaxis or treatment of invasive fungal infections; including interactions with corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, anti-infective drugs, benzodiazepines, opioid analgesics, statins, anticoagulants, anticonvulsants, and drugs affecting gastric pH. The review also describes recommendations concerning contraindications and dose-modification strategies. The azoles differ markedly in their pharmacokinetic and antifungal properties, safety and tolerability, and drug-interaction profiles. Many drug interactions can be prevented if clinicians are thoroughly familiar with the pharmacokinetic profiles of different azoles, follow contraindications and dose-modification recommendations, and switch azoles when possible to achieve the best combination of clinical efficacy and safety. Therapeutic drug monitoring can help optimize treatment and prevent underdosing or overdosing of drugs. Education of patients and their families about signs and symptoms of possible drug interactions is also beneficial.",

Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl and propofol. After endotracheal intubation, anaesthesia was maintained with the mixture of N(2)O and O(2) (1:2), the infusion of propofol and remifentanil. Remifentanil was administered in iv continuous infusion in the dose of 0.04 microg kg(-1) min(-1) followed by 0.08 microg kg(-1) min(-1). Muscle relaxants were not used. Anaesthesia was uneventful, except for transient bradycardia (HR-43 min(-1)). The patient recovered 5 min after surgery and was extubated after the further 3 min. No postoperative muscle weakness and respiratory failure were observed.",

Clinical signs of the depth of anaesthesia were classified to one of five OAA/S levels. Standard vital parameters were observed and brain electrical activity was measured using the bispectral index (BIS) and burst suppression ratio (BSR).

In twenty cases, burst suppression occurred and the correlation coefficient between BIS and DF was much lower (r=0.5860+/-3650), when compared to the group of 10 patients in which no burst suppression was detected (r=0.711+/-0.251). Appropriate correction was made using the following formula: D(FK)=D(F)-(D(F) x BSR). The mean correlation coefficient between BIS values and D(FK) in the BS group was r=0.629+/-0.331.

Volatile anesthetics, nitrous oxide, and opioids are known anesthetic risk factors for PONV, and thus preventive measures are justified. Propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), ondansetron, and dexamethasone each are reported to reduce PONV by approximately 30%. Avoiding or reducing perioperative narcotic analgesics, use of an 80% oxygen concentration, and proper intravenous fluid administration also reduce PONV.

On the basis of a random sample of 187,413 people enrolled in Taiwan's National Health Insurance program on January 1, 2000, data of 2000-2002 healthcare and pharmacological services utilization were retrieved. Long-term use (LTU) was defined by having received BZD prescriptions for 180 or more days within any given calendar year. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were carried out to assess the strength of associations while adjusting for the effects of individual sociodemographics, service providers, and pharmacological agents simultaneously. Results indicated that males, elderly, and those with physical or mental disorders were more likely to become long-term users of BZDs. Having received BZD prescriptions in multiple pharmacological agents, short-acting or mixed-type agents, and hypnotic indication were associated with a roughly 2- to 5-fold increased risk of BZD LTU soon after prescription initiation. With respect to discontinuation, the effects of pharmacological characteristics seem more salient as compared to those of individual and service-provider factors. Future strategies targeting individual factors and modifying service-provider prescription behaviors may be considered to reduce possible negative consequences of BZD LTU.", 
    "226": "The aim of this investigation was to prepare and characterize microemulsions/mucoadhesive microemulsions of Diazepam (D), Lorazepam (L) and Alprazolam (A), evaluate their pharmacodynamic performances by performing comparative sleep induction studies in male albino rats to assess their role in effective management of insomnia patients. Microemulsions of Diazepam (DME), Lorazepam (LME) and Alprazolam (AME) were prepared by titration method and characterized for drug content, globule size distribution and zeta potential, nasal toxicity and sleep induction. DME, LME and AME were transparent and stable with mean globule size and zeta potential in the range of 95.6 nm to 141.7 nm and -2.205 to -0.111 mV respectively. The prepared microemulsions exhibited reversible nasal toxicity. Onset of sleep and duration of sleep were observed in the following order: Lorazepam > Alprazolam>Diazepam. Faster onset of sleep following intranasal administration of microemulsions (<20 min) compared to oral administration (29-33 min) and control group (>45 min) for all three drugs suggested selective nose-to-brain transport of drug(s). Intranasal administration of microemulsion based formulations resulted in even faster onset of sleep (<12 min) with intranasal mucoadhesive microemulsion(s) resulting in fastest onset of sleep (<9 min). Duration of sleep was longest with the intranasal mucoadhesive microemulsions. These results are suggestive of larger extent of distribution of drug(s) to brain after intranasal administration of mucoadhesive microemulsion(s). These results are further corroborated with by loss or rightening reflex and startle reflex at earlier time points (within 10 min and 15 min respectively) with mucoadhesive microemulsions. Thus, the results of this investigation indicated rapid and larger extent of drug transport to the rat brain resulting in rapid induction of sleep followed by prolonged duration of sleep in rats following intranasal administration of mucoadhesive microemulsion(s). However, the role of microemulsion based formulations developed in this investigation in clinical practice can only be established after animal studies in two different animal models followed by extensive clinical trials."
