    "0": "This study compared the ability of two on-site testing devices, Instant-View Test Card and OnTrak TesTcup Pro 5, to discriminate negative from positive urine samples for cannabinoids, cocaine metabolite, opiates, amphetamines, and benzodiazepines. The on-site devices were evaluated in a precision study with fortified urine samples and in a clinical study with samples submitted for forensic urine drug testing. For precision, seven stocks were prepared per device. Each stock had all five analytes added in a random fashion at 0, 25, 50, 75, 125, 150, or 175% of cutoff. Ten aliquots per stock were assigned random numbers and analyzed by two individuals. The respective accuracies (defined as \"% below cutoff samples that were negative + % above cutoff samples that were positive\") for Instant-View Test Card and TesTcup were 74.3 and 87.1 for amphetamines; 82.1 and 90.7 for benzoylecgonine; 88.6 and 90.7 for benzodiazepines; 83.6 and 94.3 for morphine; 82.1 and 87.9 for cannabinoids; and 82.1 and 90.1% overall. In contrast to the on-site testing devices, instrumental testing with OnLine reagents had perfect precision. For the clinical study, submitted samples that had reached their disposal date were rescreened for the five drug groups. Fifty that had absorbance changes near the negative control for all five drug groups were selected as \"negatives\"; 240 samples with positive or multi-positive results (some between the 75% control and cutoff) and confirmed by GC-MS were chosen as \"positives\" (at least 45 per drug group). The non-positive drug groups in these samples added 150 additional presumptively negatives per drug group. Samples were assigned random numbers, and two individuals tested each sample. The respective accuracies in respect to GC-MS results for Instant-View Test Card and TesTcup were 95.8 and 91.7 for amphetamines; 100 and 100 for benzoylecgonine; 96.7 and 96.5 for benzodiazepines; 98.8 and 99.2 for opiates; 94.4 and 95.0 for cannabinoids; and 97.1 and 96.5% overall. The clinical study revealed that the Instant-View Test Card had low cross-reactivity (i.e., false negatives) for samples with amphetamine only and oxycodone. TesTcup had low cross-reactivity for samples with amphetamine only and hydrocodone and/or hydromorphone; it also had more cross-reactivity towards (i.e., false positives) sympathomimetic amines. In summary, the Instant-View Test Card was less precise than the TesTcup at or near the cutoff; with clinical samples, however, the percent accuracies of the two devices were similar.", 
    "1": "A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) method has been developed and validated for the determination of benzodiazepines, on the market in Norway, and/or their metabolites in human urine. The following compounds were included: 7-aminonitrazepam, 7-aminoclonazepam, 7-aminoflunitrazepam, alprazolam, alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, oxazepam, 3-OH-diazepam, and n-desmethyldiazepam. The method includes hydrolysis of urine samples (0.5 mL) with beta-glucuronidase at 60 degrees C for 2 h before solid-phase extraction with a polymer-based mixed-mode column. The analytes were quantified in multiple reaction monitoring mode using two transitions. Deuterated analogues were used as internal standards for all analytes except 7-aminonitrazepam and alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, which were quantified using 7-aminoclonazepam-d(4) and alprazolam-d(5), respectively. The concentration range was 0.1-8.0 microM for 7-aminonitrazepam, 7-aminoclonazepam, 7-aminoflunitrazepam, alprazolam, and alpha-hydroxyalprazolam and 0.5-40 microM for the other compounds. The average recovery for the different analytes ranged from 56% to 83%. The between-day precision of the method was in the range of 3-12%. The limits of quantification were found to be between 0.002 and 0.01 microM for the different compounds. Comparison with other analytical methods was performed for method validation, using approximately 500 samples provided by the routine laboratory at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. The LC-MS-MS method has proven to be robust and specific for the determination of benzodiazepines in urine. It has been routinely used for approximately 1800 samples in the past 7 months.", 
    "2": "1. Antagonists of the V(2) vasopressin (AVP) receptor are aquaretic agents, inhibiting water resorption without stimulating electrolyte excretion. In this set of experiments, a novel V(2) receptor antagonist, RWJ-351647, was characterized in vitro and in vivo. 2. RWJ-351647 displaced (3)H-AVP binding from cloned human V(2) and V(1A) receptors with Ki values of 1 nmol/L and 24 nmol/L. In assays using transfected HEK293 cells expressing either human or rat V(2) receptors, RWJ-351647 inhibited AVP-induced cAMP accumulation with Ki values of 3 nmol/L and 6 nmol/L, respectively. 3. RWJ-351647 was very selective in binding assays and showed only weak functional antagonist activity at either the cloned human V(1B) and oxytocin receptors or the human platelet V(1A) receptor. No agonist activity was seen with the compound at any receptor. 4. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats showed RWJ-351647 to be 41.9% bioavailable after a single oral administration. After repeated daily dosing over 5 days, the oral bioavailability remained at 43.9% with no change in the compound peak plasma levels or clearance rate. 5. In efficacy studies, RWJ-351647 increased urine output and decreased urine osmolality with oral doses as low as 0.1 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, respectively. In a multiple dose study in primates, RWJ-351647 maintained a consistent aquaretic effect over 10 days without increasing sodium or potassium excretion. 6. In summary, RWJ-351647 was shown to be a selective and potent V(2) receptor antagonist with sustainable aquaretic activity in both rats and primates. The preclinical data suggest that RWJ-351647 is a potent and effective aquaretic agent with potential for use in diseases characterized by water retention.", 
    "3": "1. Some anaesthetic agents such as barbiturates and opioids possess cardioprotective properties in rats, rabbits, dogs and pigs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of some commonly used anaesthetic agents (pentobarbital, isoflurane and a mixture of midazolam, fentanyl and fluanisone) on the tolerance of the isolated mouse heart to ischaemia-reperfusion injury. 2. The isolated, Langendorff-perfused hearts were subjected to 45 min of global ischaemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion. Left ventricular pressures, heart rate and coronary flow were measured and infarct size was determined using triphenyltetrazolium staining. 3. There were no differences in haemodynamic variables during reperfusion between groups. Infarct size was not influenced by the choice of anaesthesia. 4. None of the anaesthesia protocols exerted significant protective effects on the ischaemic-reperfused isolated mouse heart performance. In mice, isoflurane as well as pentobarbital, opioids and benzodiazepines may be safely used for anaesthesia without a risk of protective side-effects in isolated mouse heart studies.", 
    "4": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterised by an urge to move the legs, uncomfortable sensations in the legs and worsening of these symptoms during rest with at least temporary relief brought on by activity. RLS occurs in 3-15% of the general population and in 10-30% of patients on maintenance dialysis. RLS may lead to severe sleep onset or maintenance insomnia, and greatly impaired quality of life. Current recommendations suggest dopaminergic therapy (levodopa or dopamine receptor agonists: pramipexol, ropinirole, pergolide or cabergoline) as the first-line treatment for RLS. This group of medications is effective in reducing RLS symptoms in the general population; limited information is available on the effect of these drugs in patients with renal failure. However, it must be noted that most published studies in uraemic patients had short treatment periods and insufficient statistical power because of small sample size. Frequent adverse effects of levodopa, seen mainly with continuous use, may limit its use significantly. Rebound and augmentation, problems relatively frequently seen with levodopa, seem to be less prevalent with the use of dopamine receptor agonists, although properly designed comparative trials are still needed to address this question. Alternative treatment options for RLS are gabapentin, benzodiazepines and opioids. For all of these medications, there are only very limited data available on their effectiveness and safety profile in patients on maintenance dialysis. Referral to a specialist for RLS management should be considered for patients with refractory RLS.",

    "7": "Four days following 14 Gy gamma-radiation, or 2 injections of 400 mg/kg 5-fluorouracil, INS-GAS mice exhibited significantly increased small intestinal and colonic crypt survival compared with their wild-type counterparts (FVB/N). INS-GAS mice treated with 3% DSS for 5 days showed less weight loss and increased colonic crypt regeneration at 8 days compared with FVB/N. Increased small intestinal and colonic crypt survival was also demonstrated following gamma-radiation in FVB/N mice rendered hypergastrinemic using omeprazole. The increased crypt survival in INS-GAS mice following 14 Gy gamma-radiation was inhibited by administration of a CCK-2 receptor antagonist (YF476). Increased abundance of the CCK-2 receptor was demonstrated in intestinal epithelia following 14 Gy gamma-radiation by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Similarly, increased CCK-2 receptor mRNA abundance and increased 125I-gastrin binding was demonstrated in IEC-6 cells following 4 Gy gamma-radiation.",

Waist circumference (WC), BWG, body mass index (BMI) fasting glucose, insulin, and lipids were evaluated at baseline and at Weeks 7 and 14 of treatment.", 
    "11": "At Week 14, BWG (kg) was similar in the metformin group (5.5 kg) and the placebo group (6.3 kg), P = 0.4. There were no differences between the changes in BMI, WC, glucose, insulin, insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), and plasma lipid levels observed in the treatment group and the placebo group; however, glucose levels decreased significantly after metformin administration (P = 0.02). The HOMA-IR decreased significantly in both groups, but 3 subjects from the placebo group developed fasting glucose levels greater than 5 mmol/L. After taking metformin, triglyceride levels increased, but the cholesterol profile improved significantly.",

    "13": "In parallel with improvements in understanding pain neurophysiology, many chemicals have recently been investigated for spinal anaesthesia and analgesia. However, studies discussing the effects of these drugs on neural tissue indicate that knowledge about some aspects of neurotoxicity is limited. Forty-nine New Zealand albino rabbits, weighing 2.2 +/- 0.2 kg, were randomly assigned to seven groups of seven animals each. Single dose groups received intrathecally through the atlantooccipital membrane 0.9% saline 1.5 ml; midazolam 100 microg/kg (low dose midazolam group) or 500 microg/kg (high dose midazolam group); neostigmine 10 microg/kg (low dose neostigmine group) or 50 microg/kg (high dose neostigmine group). Two groups had seven days of repeated dosing with either midazolam 100 microg/kg/day (repeat midazolam group) or 10 microg/kg/day neostigmine (repeat neostigmine group). The animals were sacrificed on day 8, and two spinal cord sections from the fourth cervical level and fourth lumbar level were removed and prepared for histopathological study. Transmission electron microscopic evaluations were performed on transverse spinal cord sections by a neuropathologist blinded to the group allocation. Twenty myelinated axons and neurones in the cervical and lumbar sections were investigated for the histopathological study. This study indicates that midazolam and neostigmine have different neurotoxic effects that depend on the dose and the repetition of dosing when these drugs are administered intrathecally.",

    "15": "A 10 month-old female ingested an unknown amount of citalopram. Approximately 40 min after ingestion, the child developed horizontal nystagmus, followed by a generalized, tonic-clonic seizure that lasted 2 to 3 min very shortly thereafter. The child received 1 mg of midazolam intramuscularly (IM), followed by 1 mg of midazolam intravenously (IV) for termination of this seizure, and was given a loading dose of 20 mg/kg of fosphenytoin IV. Elective orotracheal intubation was done to protect the airway. Despite the use of midazolam and fosphenytoin, the child had another seizure approximately 85 min following the ingestion. A third seizure was noted at approximately 100 min post-ingestion. In the course of treatment, activated charcoal was administered via nasogastric tube, and IV midazolam and phenobarbital were given. The child was transferred to a nearby facility with pediatric intensive care capabilities in stable condition. The child did not experience any hypotension or dysrhythmia, and the electrocardiographic QTc and QRS complex were normal throughout the clinical course. During the subsequent 48 h, the child awoke and regained normal function. This child's recovery was uneventful, and the child was discharged home without sequelae. Plasma levels of citalopram were 1400 ng/ml, 583 ng/ml, 416 ng/ml, and 296 ng/ml, at one, six, 13, and 23 h post-ingestion, respectively. The first level likely represents a predistributional level with subsequent levels giving an elimination t1/2 of 17.38 h.",

This article reviews the various classes of psychotropic drugs that are commonly used to treat psychiatric disorders--antidepressants, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, lithium and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors--in terms of their safety during pregnancy. Evidence-based information from epidemiologic studies indicates that most psychotropic drugs are relatively safe for use during pregnancy. There is also an increasingly large body of evidence-based information in the literature indicating that it may be more harmful to both the mother and her baby if she is not treated appropriately when suffering from a severe psychiatric disorder. Therefore, it is important for women with psychiatric disorders and their healthcare providers to have access to evidenced-based information about the safety of these drugs when taken during pregnancy to ensure that women make an informed decision as to whether they should continue with the pharmacotherapy they have been using to treat their condition.", 
    "22": "Benzodiazepines are the most widely used psychotropic agents in the world. Abuse and dependence are reported in the general population and among drug misusers, including those dependent on heroine. Benzodiazepine use by heroine users increases their risk of overdose, not only from heroin but also substitution drugs such as methadone and more recently buprenorphine. Hence, detoxification from benzodiazepines is desirable.",

    "24": "Relevant studies were sought through systematic searches of Medline and Toxibase (a database focusing on substance abuse).", 
    "25": "There were fewer controlled studies than expected about benzodiazepine detoxification, and all of them excluded subjects who misused opiates or were in opiate substitution treatment. The best evidence supports a procedure where the patient is switched to a long-lasting benzodiazepine and the dose then tapered by 25% of the initial dose each week. Diazepam is the drug most often used in the framework. In opiate users, diazepam may raise special problems of misuse, as suggested by clinical and epidemiologic studies. Nonetheless, diazepam is the only benzodiazepine found to be effective for this withdrawal in controlled studies and some studies indicate that unprescribed diazepam use in heroin users is sometimes motivated by the desire to alleviate withdrawal symptoms and discomfort.", 
    "26": "Although diazepam appears to have potential for abuse, the available data does not rule out its therapeutic interest for benzodiazepine withdrawal in patients on opiate substitution treatment in an adequate treatment setting. Specific studies of this population are needed.", 
    "27": "Treatment strategies against acute neuroleptic-induced akathisia (NIA) include anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents, dopamine agonists, GABAergic agents, beta-blockers, benzodiazepines, and serotonin antagonists. However, many patients who have acute akathisia fail to respond. In previous studies, mianserin and vitamin B6 were found to be effective in the treatment of acute akathisia. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of B(6), mianserin and placebo in the treatment of acute NIA. Sixty schizophrenia and schizoaffective inpatients who have NIA were randomly divided to receive vitamin B(6) 1,200 mg/d, mianserin 15 mg/d, or placebo for 5 days, in a double-blind design. The Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and Clinical Global Impression were used to assess the severity of NIA and psychotic symptoms. The assessment was made at baseline and daily for the duration of the study. Compared with the placebo group, the vitamin B(6)-treated and mianserin-treated patients showed a significant improvement in the subjective (P < 0.0001), subjective distress (P < 0.0001), and global (P < 0.0001) subscales. The objective subscale did not show significant positive results (P = 0.056), but there was a trend toward symptom amelioration in both groups. A reduction of at least 2 points on the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale global subscale was noted in the vitamin B(6) group (13/23, 56%) as well as in the mianserin groups (13/20, 65%), and in only one patient in the placebo group (1/17, 6%; P < 0.0005). Our results indicate that high doses of B(6) and a low dose of mianserin may be a useful addition to current treatments of NIA. The efficacy of vitamin B(6) and mianserin suggests that the pathophysiology of acute NIA is heterogeneous with the various subtypes of acute NIA responding differently to the various pharmacological approaches.", 
    "28": "Conventional methods to forecast CYP3A-mediated drug-drug interactions have not employed stochastic approaches that integrate pharmacokinetic (PK) variability and relevant covariates to predict inhibition in terms of probability and uncertainty. Empirical approaches to predict the extent of inhibition may not account for nonlinear or non-steady-state conditions, such as first-pass effects or accumulation of inhibitor concentration with multiple dosing. A physiologically based PK model was developed to predict the inhibition of CYP3A by ketoconazole (KTZ), using midazolam (MDZ) as the substrate. The model integrated PK models of MDZ and KTZ, in vitro inhibition kinetics of KTZ, and the variability and uncertainty associated with these parameters. This model predicted the time- and dose-dependent inhibitory effect of KTZ on MDZ oral clearance. The predictive performance of the model was validated using the results of five published KTZ-MDZ studies. The model improves the accuracy of predicting the inhibitory effect of increasing KTZ dosing on MDZ PK by incorporating a saturable KTZ efflux from the site of enzyme inhibition in the liver. The results of simulations using the model supported the KTZ dose of 400 mg once daily as the optimal regimen to achieve maximum inhibition by KTZ. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the most influential variable on the prediction of inhibition was the fractional clearance of MDZ mediated by CYP3A. The model may be used prospectively to improve the quantitative prediction of CYP3A inhibition and aid the optimization of study designs for CYP3A-mediated drug-drug interaction studies in drug development.", 
    "29": "Small molecule antagonists of protein-protein interactions represent a particular challenge for pharmaceutical discovery. One approach to finding molecules that can disrupt these interactions is to seek mimics of common protein structure motifs. We present an analysis of how molecules based on the 1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5-dione scaffold serve to mimic the side-chains presented by the hydrophobic face of two turns of an alpha-helix derived from the tumor suppressor protein p53, and thus antagonize the HDM2-p53 protein-protein binding interaction.",

J. Mol. Graphics Modelling 2004, 23, 253-261). Pharmacophore-guided optimization of this lead compound yielded a number of high-affinity ligands for the benzodiazepine site including compounds 20 and 23-25 displaying sub-nanomolar affinities. A few of the compounds have been tested on the alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2S) and alpha(3)beta(2)gamma(2S) GABA(A) receptor subtypes, and two of the compounds (5 and 19) display selectivity for alpha(1)- versus alpha(3)-containing receptors by a factor of 22 and 27, respectively.

    "32": "N-(heteroarylmethyl)indol-3-ylglyoxylamides (1-26) were synthesized and evaluated as ligands of the benzodiazepine receptor (BzR) to probe the hydrogen bonding properties of the so-called S(1) site of the BzR by means of suitable heterocyclic side chains. SARs were developed in light of our hypothesis of binding modes A and B. Pyrrole and furan derivatives adopting mode A (2, 8, 10, 20, 22) turned out to be more potent (K(i) values < 35 nM) than their analogues lacking hydrogen bonding heterocyclic side chains. These data suggest that the most potent indoles interact with a hydrogen bond acceptor/donor (HBA/D) group located within the S(1) site of the BzR. Compounds 1, 2, 8, 19, 20, and 22, tested at recombinant rat alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2), alpha(2)beta(2)gamma(2), and alpha(5)beta(3)gamma(2) BzRs, elicited selectivity for the alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2) isoform. On the basis of published mutagenesis studies and the present SARs, we speculate that the S(1) HBA/D group might be identified as the hydroxyl of alpha(1)-Tyr209 or of other neighboring amino acids.", 
    "33": "Capability of evolutionary neural network (ENN) based QSAR approach to direct the descriptor selection process towards stable descriptor subset (DS) composition characterized by acceptable generalization, as well as the influence of description stability on QSAR model interpretation have been examined. In order to analyze the DS stability and QSAR model generalization properties multiple random dataset partitions into training and test set were made. Acceptability criteria proposed by Golbraikh et al. [J. Comput.-Aided Mol. Des., 17 (2003) 241] have been chosen for selection of highly predictive QSAR models from a set of all models produced by ENN for each dataset splitting. All QSAR models that pass Golbraikh's filter generated by ENN for each dataset partition were collected. Two final DS forming principles were compared. Standard principle is based on selection of descriptors characterized by highest frequencies among all descriptors that appear in the pool [J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci., 43 (2003) 949]. Search across the model pool for DS that are stable against multiple dataset subsampling i.e. universal DS solutions is the basis of novel approach. Based on described principles benzodiazepine QSAR has been proposed and evaluated against results reported by others in terms of final DS composition and model predictive performance.", 
    "34": "(1) The aim of replacement therapy for heroin addiction is to suppress craving for other opiates and to prevent opiate withdrawal symptoms. (2) In France, methadone was the first drug to be licensed for this use, in 1995, with very strict prescribing and dispensing conditions. Buprenorphine was approved in 1996, and was subject to less restrictive conditions. (3) In 2003 in France, an estimated 80 000 people were receiving replacement therapy with buprenorphine and 14 000 with methadone. (4) A meta-analysis of 13 comparative trials involving a total of 2544 patients showed that buprenorphine 6 to 12 mg initially reduced both opiate and benzodiazepine use, whereas doses of 2 to 4 mg had no marked impact on heroin use. This meta-analysis concluded that buprenorphine and methadone had similar efficacy in clinical trials in which the dose was adjusted to outcome. There were more dropouts with buprenorphine than with methadone. A daily dose of 16 mg appeared to be roughly equivalent to 60 mg/day methadone. (5) France appears to be the only country to have relied primarily on buprenorphine as replacement therapy for heroin addiction. This has been the case in France since 1996. The frequency of heroin overdose has fallen markedly in France since 1996, possibly due in part to the availability of replacement therapies. Overall mortality among drug users has also declined, but this is largely due to more effective treatment of HIV infection. (6) In France, a two-year cohort study of patients treated with buprenorphine and a survey conducted during the first year of buprenorphine replacement were funded by the manufacturer, Schering-Plough. The results showed that more than two-thirds of patients remained on treatment, and that, overall, the patients' general condition improved. (7) Opioid-like adverse effects are infrequent under normal conditions of use. There are reports of cases of hepatitis in patients taking buprenorphine, with or without a benzodiazepine. Attribution to buprenorphine is unclear, however, due to the lack of appropriate analyses. (8) Some of the key adverse effects occur during misuse: buprenorphine tablets are often injected, especially during the first few months of treatment (sometimes for more than two years). Injection carries a risk of infections; other potential long-term effects are poorly understood. Compared with methadone users, and regardless of the substances involved, buprenorphine users appear more likely to self-inject. (9) The consequences of sniffing crushed buprenorphine tablets have not been studied. (10) Deaths have been reported following buprenorphine overdose, but they appear to be less frequent than with methadone (0.2 and 0.7 deaths per 1000 users, respectively in 1998). (11) Approaches designed to help patients stop self-injecting have not been tested in comparative trials. Prescriptions of methadone syrup or an injection opiate may be worth trying when all other measures fail.",

All measures were collected at baseline and at the end of the 8-week treatment.", 
    "39": "After treatment, insulin, C-peptide, and IRI were significantly increased in the four groups, but not fasting glucose levels. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly increased in the clozapine and olanzapine groups. Patients treated with clozapine and olanzapine had higher fasting insulin, C-peptide, and IRI levels than those treated with risperidone and sulpiride. Among the four antipsychotics, the increases of mean BMI from high to low were as follows: clozapine, olanzapine, sulpiride, and risperidone.", 
    "40": "This study confirmed that the four antipsychotic drugs were associated with an increase of insulin, C-peptide, and IRI. It was found that clozapine and olanzapine were associated with an increase in cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

    "42": "Authors discuss problems with identification and determination of flunitrazepam and zolpidem in biological material (BM). Over the recent years, these two structurally different substances have become the most frequently used as well as abused hypnotic drugs. This study presents applicability of immunochemical methods in the screening of flunitrazepam, one of the most commonly prescribed drugs among the benzodiazepines. Herein described techniques, a liquid-liquid (L-L) extraction, solid phase extraction (SPE) and the so-called \"freeze out\" method are used for isolation of the above mentioned compounds from BM. Besides the thin layer chromatography (TLC) and gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) applied in qualitative analysis, the study also describes a gas chromatography with electron capture detector (GC-ECD) and gas chromatography with nitrogen phosphorus detector (GC-NPD) optimized for the determination of flunitrazepam and zolpidem in blood (serum). Successful analyses of these two substances are of major importance, especially in interpreting the results of forensic toxicological examinations.", 
    "43": "In addition to controlling systemic blood pressure, angiotensin II (Ang II) has several roles in the brain, including the regulation of cerebrovascular flow and the reaction to stress. In order to clarify the central effects of Ang II and its type 1 (AT1) receptors, we reviewed the literature reporting recent research on the effects of pretreatment with the AT1-receptor blocker, candesartan, on experimental ischemia, cerebrovascular remodeling, and inflammation in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), and the responses to stress induced by isolation and by cold-restraint. Angiotensin II regulates the brain circulation through stimulation of AT1-receptors located in the cerebrovascular endothelium and central pathways. SHRs express greater numbers of endothelial AT1-receptors and a central sympathetic overdrive, resulting in pathological cerebrovascular growth, inflammation, decreased cerebrovascular compliance, and enhanced vulnerability to brain ischemia. Sustained central AT1-receptor antagonism reverses these effects. Sustained reduction of AT1-receptor stimulation before stress prevents the hormonal and sympathoadrenal stress responses during isolation and prevents the gastric ulceration stress response to cold-restraint, indicating that increased AT1-receptor stimulation is essential to enhance the central sympathetic response and the formation and release of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and arginine vasopressin that occur during stress. AT1-receptor blocking agents reverse the cortical alterations in CRF1 and benzodiazepine receptors characteristic of isolation stress, effects probably related to their anti-anxiety effect in rodents. Sustained reduction of Ang II tone by AT1-receptor antagonism could be considered as a preventive and therapeutic approach for brain ischemia and stress-related and mood disorders. Additional preclinical studies and controlled clinical trials are necessary to confirm the efficacy of this novel therapeutic approach.", 
    "44": "This study assesses the efficacy of an educational and dietary approach in preventing olanzapine-induced weight gain. Eighteen patients affected by schizophrenic disorders were treated with olanzapine and weighed twice-weekly for 24 weeks. A psychoeducational intervention and referral to a nutritionist was introduced from the beginning of olanzapine treatment in 9 patients, and from the 9th week of therapy in 8 patients. Results showed that after 8 weeks of olanzapine treatment, weight gain was contained in the subjects receiving intervention unlike patients without preventive intervention (+0.99+/-3.34 kg vs. +2.96+/-3.08 kg; p<.03). At the end of the trial these patients partly shed their gain (-1.77 kg), presenting a final weight which was not significantly different from baseline (+1.19 kg). Subjects receiving the psychoeducational approach from the beginning were significantly heavier than at baseline (+3.4 kg). Poor dietary compliance correlated significantly with an increase in body weight, while higher mean dosages of olanzapine correlated with better weight-gain control.",

    "46": "C-type natriuretic peptide, widely distributed in the CNS, may work as a neuromodulator. In this work, we investigated modulation by C-type natriuretic peptide of functional properties of glutamate receptors in rat retinal GABAergic amacrine cells in culture. Immunocytochemical data revealed that natriuretic peptide receptor-B was strongly expressed on the membrane of cultured GABAergic amacrine cells. By whole cell recording techniques we further identified the glutamate receptor expressed on the GABAergic amacrine cells as an AMPA-preferring subtype. Incubation with C-type natriuretic peptide suppressed the AMPA receptor-mediated current of these cells in a dose-dependent manner by decreasing the efficacy and apparent affinity for glutamate. The effect of C-type natriuretic peptide was reversed by HS-142-1, a guanylyl cyclase-coupled natriuretic peptide receptor-A/B antagonist. Meanwhile, the selective natriuretic peptide receptor-C agonist cANF did not change the glutamate current. In conjunction with the immunocytochemical data, these results suggest that the C-type natriuretic peptide effect may be mediated by natriuretic peptide receptor-B. Furthermore, incubation of retinal cultures in the C-type natriuretic peptide-containing medium elevated cGMP immunoreactivity in the GABAergic amacrine cells, and the C-type natriuretic peptide effect on the glutamate current was mimicked by application of 8-Br-cGMP. It is therefore concluded that C-type natriuretic peptide may modulate the glutamate current by increasing the intracellular concentration of cGMP in these cells via activation of natriuretic peptide receptor-B.", 
    "47": "Two commercially available drug-screening assays were evaluated: the Roche kinetic interaction of microparticles in solution (KIMS) assay and the Microgenics cloned enzyme donor immunoassay (CEDIA). Urine samples from known drug-abuse patients were analyzed for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, benzoylecgonine, cannabinoids, LSD, methadone and opiates. Samples with discordant findings for the two assays were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or gas chromatography/electron capture detection (GC/ECD). Amphetamines showed 96.0% concordant results, with two false positive findings by CEDIA, three by KIMS and a further two false negatives by KIMS. Barbiturates showed 99.4% concordant results, with one false negative by KIMS. Benzodiazepines showed 97.4% concordant results, with two false negatives by KIMS (cutoff 100 microg/L, CEDIA cutoff 300 microg/L). Benzoylecgonine showed 17.8% concordant positive and 82.2% concordant negative results and no false finding by either assay. Cannabinoids showed 99.3% concordant results, with one sample negative by KIMS at a cutoff of 50 microg/L and positive by CEDIA (cutoff 25 microg/L). For LSD, 6.7% of findings were not in agreement. Methadone showed 97.5% concordant results, with two false positives by CEDIA, and one false positive and one false negative by KIMS. Opiates showed 96.9% concordant results, with no false KIMS results, but four false positives by CEDIA. The results indicate that the agreement of the CEDIA and KIMS results for the eight drugs is rather good (93.3-100%).",

The groups were compared after 12 to 48 months (mean, 18.2 months).", 
    "50": "For the patients 6 to 36 months old, the success rate was 80% in the group who received general anesthesia and 88.9% in the group who received topical anesthesia with intranasal midazolam; the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (P > .05). For the patients older than 36 months, the success rate was 20% in the group who received general anesthesia and 25% in the group who received topical anesthesia with intranasal midazolam; there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (P > .05).",

Our results show that this is suitable for children until 4 years of age with the support of intranasal midazolam sedation. Probing under topical anesthesia with intranasal midazolam is cost-effective, safe, and comparable in efficacy to probing under general anesthesia but with less risk.", 
    "52": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a useful method to study pharmacological effects on motor cortex excitability. Zolpidem is a selective agonist of the benzodiazepine receptor subtype BZ1 and has a distinct pharmacological profile compared to diazepam. To study the different effects of these two drugs on the cortical inhibitory system, TMS was performed before and after administration of a single oral dose of zolpidem (10 mg) and diazepam (5 mg) in six healthy volunteers. TMS tests included the determination of resting and active motor threshold (MT) and measurements of the amplitudes of motor evoked potentials, intracortical facilitation (ICF), short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI), and long-latency intracortical inhibition (LICI), and determination of the cortical silent period (CSP). Both drugs were without effect on the active or resting MT and decreased the ICF. Prolongation of the CSP and enhancement of LICI only in the presence of zolpidem point to a specific BZ1-related mechanism underlying the long-lasting component of cortical inhibition. This selective modulation of the CSP and the LICI points to a specific role of BZ1 receptors in the control of inhibitory neuronal loops within the primary motor cortex.",

    "65": "Learning and memory are central topics in behavioral neuroscience, and inbred mice strains are widely investigated. However, operant conditioning techniques are not as extensively used in this field as they should be, given the effectiveness of the methodology of the experimental analysis of behavior. In the present study, male C57B1/6 mice, widely used as background for transgenic studies, were trained to lever press on discrete-trial fixed-ratio 5 or fixed-interval (11 s or 31 s) schedules of food reinforcement and then exposed to 15 extinction sessions following vehicle or chlordiazepoxide injections (15 mg/kg i.p., administered either prior to all extinction sessions, or prior to the final 10 extinction sessions). Extinction of operant behavior was facilitated by drug administration following training on either schedule, but this facilitation only occurred once a number of extinction sessions had taken place. The extinction process proceeded more rapidly following fixed-interval training. Resistance to extinction was equally high following training with either schedule type, and was reduced by drug administration in both cases. These phenomena were evident in individual cumulative records and in analyses of group data. Results are interpreted in terms of phenomena of operant extinction identified in Skinner's (1938) Behavior of Organisms, and by behavioral momentum theory. These procedures could be used to extend the contribution of operant conditioning to contemporary behavioral neuroscience.",

    "67": "To clarify the drug-base interaction between diazepam (DZP) suppository and oleaginous base, we investigated the effect of simultaneous combination of oleaginous base on the absorption and on the anticonvulsant effect of DZP Suppository in rats. Simultaneous insertion of DZP suppository and oleaginous base significantly decreased maximum concentration (C(max)) and area under the blood concentration-time curve (AUC) of plasma DZP concentrations. Administration of DZP suppositories (2.5, 5 mg/kg) dose-dependently suppressed the pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures, and the anticonvulsant effect of DZP suppository (5 mg/kg) was reduced by simultaneous insertion of oleaginous base. In an in vitro study using a suppository release apparatus, simultaneous combination of DZP suppository and oleaginous base (1.5-98 mg) significantly decreased the accumulative release of DZP in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggested that when DZP suppository and oleaginous base are inserted simultaneously, the released DZP distributes partially to the oleaginous base, and this phenomenon is related to the decreases in the plasma concentration and the anticonvulsant effect of DZP.",

    "72": "Many medications have been used over the past thirty years for the treatment of opioid withdrawal, including propoxyphene, methadone, clonidine, parenteral buprenorphine, and, more recently, sublingual buprenorphine. Each has been found to have clinical strengths and limitations. Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic analgesic with opiate activity primarily due to the binding of a metabolite to the micro receptor. Despite this micro receptor activity, tramadol appears to have low abuse potential and is a non-scheduled analgesic. The pharmacologic profile of tramadol makes it a candidate for opiate withdrawal treatment. A chart review was undertaken to retrospectively compare treatment outcomes of heroin-dependent patients when detoxified with parenteral buprenorphine (1996-1997) versus tramadol (1999-2000). Inclusion criteria for this study were heroin as drug of choice, current opioid physical dependence (ie, withdrawal symptoms), no current abuse of oral opioid analgesics, and no alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. Patient cases that met inclusion criteria were group-matched between buprenorphine and tramadol on the basis of age, sex, and amount of heroin used (bags/day). Charts were audited for patient demographics, daily heroin use at admission, withdrawal symptoms, and discharge status. In total, 129 patient charts were reviewed, and 115 met all inclusion criteria and were group-matched (45 patients in the buprenorphine group, seventy in the tramadol group). There were no differences in demographics between the two groups of patients. Fifty-six percent of the buprenorphine group and 71% of the tramadol group completed detoxification; tramadol-treated patients had significantly higher average withdrawal symptoms when compared to the buprenorphine group and a greater reduction in withdrawal symptoms over time. Finally, the number of side effects was small and did not differ between the groups. The results of this study are consistent with previous pilot reports that indicated few clinical differences between parenteral buprenorphine and oral tramadol protocols when used in the management of acute heroin withdrawal. As a consequence, tramadol shows some promise as an opioid withdrawal management medication.",

Patients stayed longer in treatment when taking risperidone (82 +/- 19 days) or ziprasidone (74 +/- 21 days) compared with olanzapine (44 +/- 30 days) or typicals (47 +/- 36 days). Eighty-eight percent of risperidone patients and 64% of ziprasidone patients successfully completed the program, while only 33% of olanzapine patients and 40% of patients on typicals successfully completed the program. Risperidone and ziprasidone were associated with significantly better program performance than olanzapine or depot typicals in this population. Possible reasons for this difference are discussed.",

Reports have also shown that second-generation antipsychotic drugs are also efficacious in relieving catatonia. This report describes two schizophrenia patients who demonstrated recurrent catatonic features mutism and stupor. Both patients were treated with lorazepam, diazepam or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Patient 1 responded well and rapidly to lorazepam each time catatonia happened; but catatonia recurred once a year under treatment with many antipsychotic drugs. Patient 2 had catatonia features associated with discontinuing or decreasing clozapine. With each recurrent episode, the duration of catatonia increased, requiring an increased dosage of benzodiazepine. The patient's response to lorazepam and ECT gradually decreased, until the patient had almost no response to lorazepam, diazepam or ECT.

Risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine may be all similarly effective in the treatment of delirium, whereas there may be limited efficacy in the use of olanzapine in the hypoactive subtype of delirium in elderly populations, which may generalize to the other atypical antipsychotics. The use of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of delirium is safe and carries a low burden of side effects.",

    "79": "In recent years great progress has been made in understanding the function of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors; their pharmacology and potential therapeutic applications. It should be stressed that there are already N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists in clinical use, such as memantine, which proves the feasibility of their therapeutic potential. It seems unlikely that competitive NMDA receptor antagonists and high-affinity channel blockers will find therapeutic use due to limiting side-effects, whereas agents acting at the glycineB site, NMDA receptor subtype-selective agents and moderate-affinity channel blockers are far more promising. This is supported by the fact that there are several glycineB antagonists, NMDA moderate-affinity channel blockers and NR2B-selective agents under development. Positive and negative modulators of AMPA receptors such as the AMPAkines and 2,3-benzodiazepines also show more promise than e.g. competitive antagonists. Great progress has also been made in the field of metabotropic glutamate receptors since the discovery of novel, allosteric modulatory sites for these receptors. Selective agents acting at these transmembrane sites have been developed that are more drug-like and have a much better access to the central nervous system than their competitive counterparts. The chapter will critically review preclinical and scarce clinical experience in the development of new ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptor modulators according to the following scheme: rational, preclinical findings in animal models and finally clinical experience, where available.",

The respective GABA(A) receptor subtypes, therefore, provide new opportunities not only for understanding GABA-dependent pathophysiologies but also for targeting of selective neuronal circuits by drugs. The pharmacological relevance of GABA(A) receptor subtypes is increasingly being recognized. A new central nervous system pharmacology is on the horizon. The development of anxiolytic drugs devoid of sedation and of agents that enhance hippocampus-dependent learning and memory has become a novel and highly selective therapeutic opportunity.",

Many studies have assessed the effectiveness of antipsychotic augmentation in SRI-refractory OCD. In this systematic review, we evaluate the efficacy of antipsychotic augmentation in treatment-refractory OCD. The electronic databases of PubMed, PsychINFO (1967-2005), Embase (1974-2000) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, as of 2005, Issue 3) were searched for relevant double-blind trials using keywords 'antipsychotic agents' or 'neuroleptics' and 'obsessive-compulsive disorder'. Search results and analysis were limited to double-blind, randomized control trials involving the adult population. The proportion of subjects designated as treatment responders was defined by a greater than 35% reduction in Yale Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) rating during the course of augmentation therapy. Nine studies involving 278 participants were included in the analysis. The meta-analysis of these studies demonstrated a significant absolute risk difference (ARD) in favor of antipsychotic augmentation of 0.22 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.13, 0.31). The subgroup of OCD patients with comorbid tics have a particularly beneficial response to this intervention, ARD=0.43 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.68). There was also evidence suggesting OCD patients should be treated with at least 3 months of maximal-tolerated therapy of an SRI before initiating antipsychotic augmentation owing to the high rate of treatment response to continued SRI monotherapy (25.6%). Antipsychotic augmentation in SRI-refractory OCD is indicated in patients who have been treated for at least 3 months of maximal-tolerated therapy of an SRI. Unfortunately, only one-third of treatment-refractory OCD patients show a meaningful treatment response to antipsychotic augmentation. There is sufficient evidence in the published literature, demonstrating the efficacy of haloperidol and risperidone, and evidence regarding the efficacy of quetiapine and olanzapine is inconclusive. Patients with comorbid tics are likely to have a differential benefit to antipsychotic augmentation.",

Among patients who discontinued their previous antipsychotic because of inefficacy (N=184), olanzapine was more effective than quetiapine and ziprasidone, and risperidone was more effective than quetiapine. There were no significant differences between antipsychotics among those who discontinued their previous treatment because of intolerability (N=168).",

Time to discontinuation because of inadequate therapeutic effect was significantly longer for clozapine than for olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone. At 3-month assessments, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total scores had decreased more in patients treated with clozapine than in patients treated with quetiapine or risperidone but not olanzapine.

The 'chasing the dragon' technique was used for inhalation, in which the fumes of heroin base, heated on aluminum foil, were inhaled. Heroin doses varied between 66 and 450 mg. Heroin, 6-acetylmorphine and morphine data were fitted simultaneously using sequential two-compartment models.

The clearances of morphine and the morphine-glucuronides were estimated to be 73.6 L/h (95% CI 62.8, 84.4) and between 6 and 10 L/h, respectively. The terminal half-life of 6-acetylmorphine was 13% lower in cocaine users (p < 0.05). No other significant relationships between covariates and pharmacokinetic parameters were discovered.",

    "100": "Weight gain can be an adverse effect of antipsychotics and is an important factor for long-term health and treatment compliance. Many reports have shown that the alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor may be related to eating behaviors or lipolytic activities, both associated with body weight change. We hypothesized that there might be a relationship between the alpha(2a)-adrenergic receptor -1,291 C/G polymorphism and olanzapine-induced weight gain. A group of 62 Korean schizophrenic patients participated in a study; weight and height measurements were obtained prior to starting olanzapine and measured again after long-term treatment. Genotyping for the -1291 C/G polymorphism was performed on all participants. Body weight changes from baseline to endpoint were significantly associated with genotypes (P = 0.028). The frequency of the G allele was significantly higher in subjects who had severe weight gain (defined as a more than 10% weight gain from baseline) compared to subjects who did not have extreme weight gain (less than 10% weight gain from baseline) (X(2) = 6.120, P = 0.013; OR = 2.58, 95% CI = 1.21-5.51). Therefore, the findings from this study support a relationship between the -1291 C/G polymorphism of the alpha(2a)-adrenergic receptor and weight gain in Korean schizophrenic patients receiving olanzapine treatment.",

The present study was accomplished in two phases: Phase 1: Preliminary dose finding pilot study on 10 children. Phase 2: Single dose, randomized parallel clinical trial on 40 children between the ages of 2 and 5 years. These children were randomly assigned to two groups consisting of 20 subjects each. Group M, received Midazolam intramuscularly, while Group N received Midazolam intranasally. Both the intranasal and intramuscular groups showed highly significant decrease in crying levels, motor movements and sensory perception levels, post-sedation (P P < 0.001). Midazolam could be safely and successfully employed by intranasal and intramuscular routes for Paediatric conscious sedation in a routine dental setup with basic facilities at a dosage of 0.2 mg/ kg body weight. Whenever the clinical situation warrants a faster action, peak and recovery, the intranasal route should be the obvious choice.", 
    "102": "Although GABA(A) receptors have long been implicated in mediating ethanol (EtOH) actions, receptors containing the \"nonsynaptic\" delta subunit only recently have been shown to be uniquely sensitive to EtOH. Here, we show that delta subunit-containing receptors bind the imidazo-benzodiazepines (BZs) flumazenil and Ro15-4513 with high affinity (K(d) < 10 nM), contrary to the widely held belief that these receptors are insensitive to BZs. In immunopurified native cerebellar and recombinant delta subunit-containing receptors, binding of the alcohol antagonist [(3)H]Ro15-4513 is inhibited by low concentrations of EtOH (K(i) approximately 8 mM). Also, Ro15-4513 binding is inhibited by BZ-site ligands that have been shown to reverse the behavioral alcohol antagonism of Ro15-4513 (i.e., flumazenil, beta-carbolinecarboxylate ethyl ester (beta-CCE), and N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG7142), but not including any classical BZ agonists like diazepam). Experiments that were designed to distinguish between a competitive and allosteric mechanism suggest that EtOH and Ro15-4513 occupy a mutually exclusive binding site. The fact that only Ro15-4513, but not flumazenil, can inhibit the EtOH effect, and that Ro15-4513 differs from flumazenil by only a single group in the molecule (an azido group at the C7 position of the BZ ring) suggest that this azido group in Ro15-4513 might be the area that overlaps with the alcohol-binding site. Our findings, combined with previous observations that Ro15-4513 is a behavioral alcohol antagonist, suggest that many of the behavioral effects of EtOH at relevant physiological concentrations are mediated by EtOH/Ro15-4513-sensitive GABA(A) receptors.",

Five daily 15 min-operant sessions were carried out on each experiment. Unpunished, unrewarded and punished operant behavioral periods were identical both in their duration and in their reward system (the FR1 schedule) in order to measure response suppression, which has not been considered in previous studies with the Geller-Seifter paradigm.

The animal model of perinatally protein-deprived rats along with the Geller-Seifter's operant behavioral paradigm may represent a more sensitive approach to model human anxiety sensitive to antidepressant treatments by considering the combined impact of both early biological trauma and adult learned experiences under the same design.", 
    "107": "In the present study, the mechanism behind flurothyl-induced seizures was examined using drugs acting on the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex in Mongolian gerbils. In addition, amino acid concentrations in the brain were also investigated. In behavioral experiments, the incidence of tonic extensor was 83.3% in both the control and picrotoxin (0.5 mg/kg)-treated groups, 0% in the valproate (200 mg/kg)-treated group, and 50% in the picrotoxin plus valproate-treated group. However, picrotoxin did not antagonize the effect of valproate on clonic seizure latency at all. Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, was found to have an inhibitory effect on the anticonvulsant action of diazepam (0.5 mg/kg). The incidence of tonic extensor was 83.3% in flumazenil (10 mg/kg)-treated group, 0% in the diazepam (0.5 mg/kg)-treated group, and 83% in the flumazenil plus diazepam-treated group as well as the control group. Flumazenil also completely reversed the effect of diazepam on clonic seizure latency. In biochemical experiments, the concentration of the inhibitory amino acid, GABA, was significantly increased in the hippocampus (P<0.05) and cerebellum (P<0.01) in diazepam-treated animals. The increase of GABA in the hippocampus and cerebellum was antagonized by the administration of flumazenil. These results suggested that the anticonvulsant action of diazepam may be linked to increase in hippocampus and cerebellum GABA concentrations. The findings suggest that the mechanism of flurothyl-induced seizures, in part, is related to the highly sensitive benzodiazepine site of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex.",

CYP3A phenotyping in vivo showed that CYP3A4*20 exhibits a clear genotype-phenotype correlation, demonstrated by the subject's low systemic midazolam clearance (2.99 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1)). Genotyping of a white German population (n = 428) and relatives of the subject, as well as a review of published CYP3A4 sequencing data, suggests that CYP3A4*20 is a rare variant allele (<0.06% in white subjects).",

Across follow-up, lower frequency heroin use was associated with reduced likelihood of frequent use of other opioids, cocaine, amphetamine and benzodiazepines.

Since cerebral glutamate levels are elevated for many hours in progressing stroke, we investigated the novel AMPA glutamate receptor antagonist ZK 187638 in rodent models of stroke using up to 12 h delays in the start of therapy after permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). In rats, ZK 187638 reduced total infarct volume by 43% and 33% when therapy was started immediately or with a delay of 6 h, respectively, but no effect was observed after a 12 h delay. Dose-dependent decreases of total infarct volume (up to 42%) were measured in mice given the first injection of ZK 187638 6 h after permanent MCA occlusion. In conclusion, the AMPA receptor antagonist ZK 187638 has a therapeutic time window of at least 6 h after permanent focal cerebral ischemia in rodents.",

Cinacalcet, an allosteric enhancer of the calcium-sensing receptor, is used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism. Allosteric ligands might be especially valuable to control receptors for which the design of selective orthosteric agonists or antagonists has been elusive, such as muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.",

Seventy-six cases were identified from a total of 434 (17.5%) cases of adult sexual assault. The median delay from alleged incident to time of examination was 20 h. Alcohol consumption in the hours prior to the assault was reported by 77%. Alcohol was still present in 37% when subsequently examined, with an average blood alcohol concentration of 0.11% at the time of examination. Forty-nine percent reported using prescription medications and 26% reported the use of recreational drugs. Drugs not reportedly consumed by the subject were detected in 15 cases (20%) of the study group or 3% of all adult sexual assault cases. The drugs detected included cannabis (four cases), antidepressants (4), amphetamines (3), benzodiazepines (4) and opiates (3). The study indicates that covert administration of drugs in the setting of adult sexual assault appears uncommon. The true incidence however may be higher (due to non or delayed reporting) or lower (due to inaccurate self reporting of drug consumption) however the frequent findings of high concentrations of alcohol has implications for the health and safety of these individuals.", 
    "129": "Cure of cognitive disorders such as amnesia, attention deficit, and Alzheimer's disease is still far from being realized in the field of medicine. Nootropic agents such as piracetam, aniracetam, and choline esterase inhibitors like donepezil are being used for improving memory, mood, and behavior, but the resulting side effects associated with these agents have made their applicability limited. In Ayurveda, the roots of Nardostachys jatamansi have been clinically employed for their anti-ischemic, antioxidant, anticonvulsant, and neuroprotective activities. The present study was undertaken to assess the potential of N. jatmansi as a memory enhancer. The elevated plus maze and the passive avoidance paradigm were employed to evaluate learning and memory parameters. Three doses (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, p.o.) of an ethanolic extract of N. jatamansi were administered for 8 successive days to both young and aged mice. The 200 mg/kg dose of N. jatmansi ethanolic extract significantly improved learning and memory in young mice and also reversed the amnesia induced by diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.). Furthermore, it also reversed aging-induced amnesia due to natural aging of mice. As scopolamine-induced amnesia was reversed, it is possible that the memory improvement may be because of facilitation of cholinergic transmission in the brain. Hence, N. jatmansi might prove to be a useful memory restorative agent in the treatment of dementia seen in elderly persons. The underlying mechanism of action can be attributed to its antioxidant property.",

Three potential pharmacological mechanisms for this tolerance are examined, using nitrendipine (L-type calcium channel blocker), theophylline (adenosine A1/A2 antagonist) and flumazenil (benzodiazepine antagonist). Rats received 10 days of exposure to an ethanol-containing liquid diet (6.5% w/v). A radiant heat tail-flick assay was used to assess hyperalgesia at 12 h after removal of the liquid diet, as well as tolerance to the effects of cumulative doses of ethanol (0.5-2 g/kg). Co-administration of flumazenil (10 mg/kg, i.p., b.i.d.), nitrendipine (5 mg/kg, i.p., b.i.d.) or theophylline (1 mg/kg, i.p., b.i.d.) with chronic ethanol prevented development of the hyperalgesia produced by ethanol withdrawal, but only theophylline reduced tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of ethanol administered during ethanol withdrawal. In contrast, when administered during ethanol withdrawal, theophylline (1-10 mg/kg) blocked the anti-hyperalgesic effects of ethanol during ethanol withdrawal, whereas nitrendipine (5-25 mg/kg) enabled ethanol to produce levels of antinociception comparable to non-dependent rats. These findings indicate that L-type calcium channels and adenosine receptors play important, but differing roles in the development of hyperalgesia during withdrawal, and to tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of ethanol.", 
    "144": "Hypersalivation has been reported as a side effect of atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine and olanzapine. As it is very common for antipsychotics to cause dry mouth due to anticholinergic effects, hypersalivation seems to be paradoxical. We present the case of a 34-year-old Japanese man with delusional disorder, somatic type (DSM-IV). He had chronic neck pain as well as somatic hallucination with hypochondriacal delusion for 4 years. Since combination therapy with atypical antipsychotics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been introduced in the treatment of refractory psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, olanzapine (10 mg/day) was added to fluvoxamine treatment (200 mg/day) in this case. Subsequently, hypersalivation was induced without any extrapyramidal symptoms. It is suggested that hypersalivation was an adverse effect of olanzapine. Possible interaction olanzapine with fluvoxamine might increase the risk of the adverse effect.

The benzodiazepine agonist lorazepam was used as a reference drug and showed a benzodiazepine effect: it reduced the rearing activity in mice in a dose-dependent manner, at doses that did not suppress climbing. Dissociation between the rearing and climbing behavior was not obtained with the administration of the opioid benzodiazepine, tifluadome, although tifluadome was antagonized by the BZ antagonist, flumazenil and not by naloxone, an opioid antagonist. An administration of opioids that act on the different subtype receptors morphine, U50 and SNC80, induced a dose dependent decrease in both the rearing and climbing activity, meaning no behavioral dissociation. Naloxone was found to have an antagonistic effect on morphine and U50-488H (micro and kappa subtype receptors, respectively), but no antagonistic effect on the delta subtype receptor agonist, SNC80. The administration of nalorphine to mice had no effect on both the rearing and climbing, in the staircase paradigm. When combining naloxone with the mentioned nalorphine, results showed the same effect, which was achieved with all the other opiates. This data, once again, supports the validity of the mouse staircase test for the identification of anxiolytic agents with a GABA(A) receptor complex-mediated activity, and for the ability to differentiate between diverse effects of the different opioids.",

Falls are the most common type of accident in this age group and can result in fractures and subsequent disabilities, increased fear of falling, social isolation, decreased mobility, and even an increased mortality. Several forms of exercise have been associated with a reduced risk of falling and with a wide range of physiological as well as psychosocial health benefits. Tai Chi Chuan seems to be the most promising form of exercise in the elderly, but the evidence is still controversial. In this article the design of a randomized clinical trial is presented. The trial evaluates the effect of Tai Chi Chuan on fall prevention and physical and psychological function in older adults.",

People will be randomly allocated to either the Tai Chi Chuan group (13 weeks, twice a week) or the no treatment control group. The primary outcome measure is the number of new falls, measured with a diary. The secondary outcome measures are balance, fear of falling, blood pressure, heart rate, lung function parameters, physical activity, functional status, quality of life, mental health, use of walking devices, medication, use of health care services, adjustments to the house, severity of fall incidents and subsequent injuries. Process parameters will be measured to evaluate the Tai Chi Chuan intervention. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be carried out alongside the evaluation of the clinical results. Follow-up measurements will be collected at 3, 6 and 12 months after randomization.",

Endoscopic procedures were performed within a hospital setting (55.2) more often than at an ambulatory center (35.8%) or private office (8.8%). The vast majority of EGDs and colonoscopies (>98%) were performed with endoscopic sedation. Almost three quarters (74.3%) of the respondents used a narcotic and benzodiazepine for sedation, while propofol was preferred by 25.7%. Sedation practices varied considerably within different geographic regions of the United States. Respondents routinely monitored vital signs and pulse oximetry (99.2% and 98.6%, respectively), and supplemental oxygen was administered to all patients during EGD by 72.7% of endoscopists. Endoscopist satisfaction with sedation was greater among those using propofol than conventional sedation (10 vs 8, p < 0.0001).",

A Barrett's esophagus diagnosis was associated with asthma medication use (OR 5.8; 95% CI 2.2, 14.9), but not with the other medications studied.

    "157": "Innovative approaches to care may be necessary to provide the most effective symptom management to hospice patients. One approach is prescribing newer pharmacotherapy options with the potential to improve symptom management in hospice. Such therapies are sometimes prescribed outside of Food and Drug Administration indications and are typically more costly than older agents used for the same symptoms. Another approach is the collaborative practice (CP) care model, whereby clinical pharmacists are given prescriptive authority according to evidence-based protocols and algorithms within boundaries approved by a physician. The agents typically included in CP protocols are those with wide therapeutic indices and with substantial evidence to support their use. The purpose of this study was to examine both approaches to management of pain, insomnia, and nausea, comparing symptom scores for those patients who received noncollaborative drug therapies (transdermal fentanyl, zolpidem, and ondansetron) to those who received agents under CP (oral sustained-release opioids, temazepam, and prochlorperazine). The object of the study was to investigate outcomes associated with newer drug therapy options as compared to older agents for the management of pain, insomnia, and nausea. A secondary goal is to compare symptom outcomes for patients receiving pharmaceutical care under CP and non-CP models. The study design was retrospective with a cohort. A total of 50 patients were randomly selected for each cohort of the pain and insomnia study arms. Only 45 patients prescribed oral ondansetron met inclusion criteria for the nausea group; 45 patients prescribed prochlorperazine were randomly selected as the comparator group. Patients were compared on their degree of response to the prescribed therapy. Response was classified as complete, partial, no improvement from baseline, worsened, or unknown. A complete response was defined as the symptom score improving to a 0 of 10, regardless of the previous value documented. A partial response was defined as any improvement in score that did not result in a 0 of 10. No improvement from baseline reflected a lack of overall change in score throughout the series of data points collected. A worsened response was any score found to be higher than the score documented at the time of dispense. The unknown category reflects any set of scores that had an \"N/A \" documented at the time of medication dispense or when documented for both attempts subsequent to dispensing the medication. A complete response was present in 14 of 50 (28 [corrected] percent) of the patients prescribed oral therapy [corrected] as compared with 12 of 50 (24 [corrected] percent) of those prescribed fentanyl [corrected] (p = .82). Responses defined as partial, no improvement over baseline, worsened, and unknown were also comparable between the two cohorts. A complete response was seen in 26 patients prescribed temazepam (52 percent), whereas only 11 (22 percent) of patients initially prescribed zolpidem achieved the same response (p = .0037). Both groups had a similar distribution of partial, no improvement over baseline, and worsened responses. For the nausea arm of the study, a difference was found in the number of complete responses, favoring prochlorperazine (22 of 45, 48.9 percent for prochlorperazine, 12 of 45, 26.7 percent for ondansetron, p = .0504), as well as an increased number of worse responses seen with ondansetron patients (p = .0513); however, neither difference was statistically significant. Newer pharmacotherapy options for the management of pain, insomnia, and nausea were not found to be superior when compared to older agents prescribed under CP.",

This monthly requirement forced the physician as well as the patient to evaluate whether the existing prescription pattern was indicated, or whether a drug-reducing regime should be introduced. The prescription pattern was monitored using the Ordiprax System (Institute for Rational Pharmacotherapy, IRF), which records pharmacy's sales of prescription drugs as prescribed by clinical practices. Two individual clinics in Thybor\u00f8n - Harbo\u00f8re Community, covering some 2300 patients, were surveyed.

Oxazepam 2 was activated via its 3-chloro-1,4-benzodiazepine intermediate 3 and was reacted with a large series of aliphatic and aromatic amines. The substituted 3-anilino-1,4-benzodiazepine structure was identified as lead structure in a diverse series of 3-amino-1,4-benzodiazepines 4-38 and the full SAR (structure-activity relationship) optimisation provided 3-anilinobenzodiazepines 16-38 with CCK1 receptor selectivity to CCK2. The compounds 18, 24, 28 and 33 have shown affinities at the CCK1 receptor of 11, 10, 11 and 9 nM, respectively. These equipotent CCK1 ligands were fully evaluated in behaviour pharmacological essays. An antidepressant effect was identified in the tail suspension- and the Porsolt swimming-test. The ED50 values for 24 and 28 were determined in these assays as 0.46 and 0.49 mg/kg. The mixed antagonist 37 showed in addition to the antidepressant effects anxiolytic properties.",

Body weights were assessed daily and prolactin assayed at the end of the regimen. Ziprasidone caused significant weight gain, as did olanzapine, while stimulating distinct patterns of prolactin secretion. Thus, assessment of body weight provides only limited predictive validity in differentiating between weight gain-inducing and weight-neutral drugs.", 
    "169": "Pigeons trained to discriminate 0.1 mg/kg flumazenil, proposed as an in-vivo model to study interactions with diazepam-insensitive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors, were tested with various GABAergic and non-GABAergic compounds. As a result of its pharmacological selectivity, the model was suitable for further examining previously reported flumazenil-like effects of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). Flumazenil and the GABAA negative modulator Ro 15-4513 produced 82-100% flumazenil-appropriate responding. Diazepam and the direct-acting GABAA agonists muscimol and 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridine-3-ol (THIP) produced 38-64% flumazenil-appropriate responding. GHB, its precursors 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BD) and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), and the GABAB agonists baclofen and SKF97541 produced 0-24% flumazenil-appropriate responding. Baclofen shifted the flumazenil dose-response curve to the right and down, possibly involving perceptual masking of the discriminative stimulus effects of flumazenil by agonist activity at GABAB receptors. These masking effects of baclofen were blocked by the GABAB antagonist CGP35348. When CGP35348 was given together with GHB to block its GABAB agonist effects, GHB did not produce flumazenil-appropriate responding. Conceivably, effects of GHB at non-GABAB receptors (e.g. diazepam-sensitive GABAA receptors and GHB receptors) may interfere with the expression of its flumazenil-like discriminative stimulus effects. The asymmetric substitution between GHB and flumazenil is consistent with the hypothesis that the discriminative stimulus effects of GHB consist of several components, not all of which are mimicked by flumazenil.",

Although the majority of users of mental health services are not violent, it is clear that a small yet significant minority are violent in inpatient settings and in the community. The assessment of a violent patient may be very difficult due to the lack of a full medical and psychiatric history and the non-cooperativeness of the patient. Thus a full assessment is important for the early decisions that the clinician has to take in a very quick and effective way. The primary task and the short term outcome in a behavioral emergency is to act as soon as possible to stop the violence from escalating and to find the quickest way to keep the patient's agitation and violence under control with the maximum of safety for everybody and using the less severe effective intervention. The pharmacological treatment of acute, persisting and repetitive aggression is a serious problem for other patients and staff members. Currently, there is no medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of aggression. Based on rather limited evidence, a wide variety of medications for the pharmacological treatment of acute aggression has been recommended: typical and atypical antipsychotics and benzodiazepines.",

Escalating doses of opioids and benzodiazepines provide little additional benefit while increasing the incidence of side effects. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a novel alpha2-adrenergic agonist that provides sedation, anxiolysis, and analgesia with much less respiratory depression than other sedatives. In addition, DEX stimulation of alpha2 receptors on pancreatic beta cells may inhibit insulin secretion. Hyperglycemia has not been studied specifically in patients receiving DEX. Therefore, we hypothesized that DEX would improve sedation compared with our standard sedation regimen. In addition, we studied the effects of DEX on blood glucose levels. We performed a retrospective chart review of 65 pediatric burn patients (42 boys, 23 girls) in the intensive care unit admitted between 2001 and 2004 who received DEX infusion because of failure to achieve adequate sedation with our standard regimen of opioids and benzodiazepines. We recorded age, TBSA burn size, weight, dose and duration of infusion, adequacy of sedation before and after initiation of DEX, blood glucose levels before and after DEX, and the presence or absence of mechanical ventilation. The mean age was 5 years (range, 0.6-17), burn size was 36% TBSA (range, 3-94), and weight was 26 kg (range, 8-100).

Infusions were weaned over the course of 12 to 24 hours without evidence of rebound hypertension or withdrawal. With DEX titration, all patients were rated \"adequately sedate,\" even though all were sedation failures with opioids and benzodiazepines. Eleven of 42 patients receiving ventilatory support were extubated while on DEX infusion, and no patient showed evidence of DEX induced respiratory depression.

The improvement of existing in vitro techniques and the development of new ones, such as intestinal slices, allow a better understanding of the intestine as a metabolic organ. In this paper, the formation of metabolites of several human CYP3A substrates by liver and intestinal slices from rat and mouse was compared. The results show that liver slices exhibited a higher metabolic rate for the majority of the studied substrates, but some metabolites were produced at a higher rate by intestinal slices, compared with liver slices. Coincubation with ketoconazole inhibited the metabolic conversion in intestinal slices almost completely, but inhibition was variable in liver slices. To better understand the role of CYP3A in mice, we studied the relative mRNA expression of different CYP3A isoforms in intestine and liver from mice because, in this species, CYP3A expression has not been well described in these organs. It was found that in mice, CYP3A13 is more expressed in the intestine, whereas CYP3A11, CYP3A25, and CYP3A41 are more expressed in the liver, comparable to similar findings in the rat. Altogether, these data demonstrate that, in addition to liver, the intestine from mouse and rat may have an important role in the process of first-pass metabolism, depending on the substrate. Moreover, we show that intestinal slices are a useful in vitro technique to study gut metabolism."
