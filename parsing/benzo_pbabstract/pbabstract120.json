    "0": "Anxiety is a core symptom of schizophrenia that elicits significant subjective burden of disease and contributes to treatment resistance in schizophrenia. Anxious syndromes might be attributed to incompletely remitted delusions, the negative syndrome, depressive episodes, panic attacks, social phobia, avoidance after hospitalization, and down-tapering of benzodiazepine medication. Pregabalin, an antagonist at the alpha2delta subunit of voltage-gated Ca channels, modulates several neurotransmitter systems and was found to alleviate anxiety in different mental disorders. In schizophrenia, this treatment option has not been evaluated before.Here, we report a case series of 11 schizophrenic patients who had treatment-resistant anxiety and received augmentation with pregabalin. This observational analysis reveals that the strategy was able to significantly reduce scores on the Hamilton anxiety scale; furthermore, we observed improvements of psychotic positive and negative symptoms and mood as assessed by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia. After augmentation, both a complete discontinuation of concomitant benzodiazepine treatment as well as a dose reduction of antipsychotics could be achieved. We did not observe pharmacokinetic interactions or adverse events.These observations suggest that treating anxious syndromes in schizophrenia with pregabalin can be effective and tolerable. Further investigations should differentiate schizophrenic subsyndromes of anxiety and evaluate benefits and risks of pregabalin in comparison to placebo and active competitors.",

Special features of the MRI working environment, recent studies about sedation or anaesthesia, and success rates and risk profiles in this setting are presented. Finally, information for physicians to decide between sedation or anaesthesia in individual situations is presented.", 
    "2": "Owing to advances in MRI and its crucial role in the diagnosis of various diseases, deep sedation or anaesthesia for MRI in children is requested increasingly. According to current guidelines maximum patient safety and welfare has to be ensured. Recently different sedation regimens comparing effectiveness, safety and outcome have been published. Chloral hydrate, pentobarbital and midazolam are unfavourable for MRI sedation. Dexmedetomidine appears to be convenient for sedation in patients without cardiac risk. Propofol can be effectively used for sedation or anaesthesia in the presence of anaesthesiologists or paediatric intensivists. General anaesthesia should be preferred in preterm or small children as safety and success are predictable.", 
    "3": "The MRI unit is a work station where all processes have to be well planned and staff trained to guarantee maximum patient safety, superior quality of imaging and economic needs. For optimal performance trained, experienced and certified personnel, appropriate drugs for the individual patient risk profile and sufficient monitoring equipment are essential.", 
    "4": "The intent of our study was to compare the effects of dexmedetomidine versus midazolam on perioperative hemodynamics, sedation, pain, satisfaction and recovery scores during colonoscopy.", 
    "5": "A total of 60 ASA I-II patients, between 20 and 80 years of age were included in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups. Midazolam 0.05 mg kg(-1) and fentanyl citrate 1 microg kg(-1) were administered intravenously to cases in Group I (n = 30). An initial loading dose of 1 microg kg(-1) dexmedetomidine was administered intravenously in 10 min to cases in Group II (n = 30) before the procedure and as a continuous infusion dose of 0.5 microg kg(-1) h(-1) just before the procedure started. Also 1 microg kg(-1) fentanyl citrate was administered intravenously immediately before the procedure. Peripheral oxygen saturation (S(pO2)), mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS), Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores and colonoscopist satisfaction scores of the cases were recorded.", 
    "6": "Although statistically significant values were not detected between the two groups with regard to mean arterial pressure, in Group I heart rates were higher and S(pO2) scores were lower in a statistically significant manner. When the groups were compared with regard to RSS, the RSS scores of Group I at the 10th and 15th minutes were significantly lower than Group II. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups when compared with regard to NRS scores. Satisfaction scores were significantly lower in Group II.", 
    "7": "Dexmedetomidine provides more efficient hemodynamic stability, higher Ramsay sedation scale scores, higher satisfaction scores and lower NRS scores in colonoscopies. According to our results we believe that dexmedetomidine can be used safely as a sedoanalgesic agent in colonoscopies.", 
    "8": "Data from the EMBLEM Study, a 2-year, prospective, observational study of health outcomes associated with acute treatment of patients experiencing a manic/mixed episode of bipolar disorder, was used to compare the effectiveness of olanzapine monotherapy versus risperidone monotherapy, and to investigate whether the treatment effects were similar to those reported in a 3-week, randomized controlled trial assessing the same treatments. Symptom severity measures included the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), the 5-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Disorder Scale. A total of 245 EMBLEM inpatients were analyzed with YMRS >or=20: olanzapine (n=209), risperidone (n=36). Both the treatment groups had similar improvements in YMRS from baseline to 6 weeks, but there was a significantly greater improvement in 5-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale in the olanzapine group. There was a similar improvement in Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Disorder Scale in both the groups and the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events and weight gain did not differ between the treatment groups. The EMBLEM results partly support those of the randomized controlled trial, which suggests olanzapine and risperidone have similar improvements in mania but that olanzapine monotherapy may be more effective than risperidone monotherapy in the treatment of depressive symptoms associated with mania. Limitations include differences in study design, patient population, and length of follow-up.", 
    "9": "This study evaluated the role of prodynorphin gene in the regulation of anxiety and associated molecular mechanisms. Emotional responses were assessed using the light-dark test, elevated plus maze and social interaction tests in prodynorphin knockout and wild-type mice. Corticotrophin releasing factor and proopiomelanocortin gene expressions in the hypothalamus were evaluated after restraint stress using in situ hybridization. The anxiolytic efficacy of bromazepam and GABA(A) receptor subunits gene expression in the amygdala were also assessed in both genotypes. The deletion of prodynorphin increased anxiety-like behaviours and proopiomelanocortin gene expression in the arcuate nucleus (two-fold). Moreover, the anxiolytic action of bromazepam was significantly attenuated in the mutant mice. Decreased GABA(A)\u03b3(2) and increased GABA(A)\u03b2(2) gene expression receptor subunits were found in the amygdala of prodynorphin knockout mice. These results indicate that deletion of prodynorphin gene is associated with increased anxiety-like behaviours, enhanced sensibility response to stress stimuli, reduced anxiolytic efficacy of bromazepam and altered expression of the GABA(A) receptor subunits.", 
    "10": "Zolpidem is a hypnotic drug used in sleep disorders. It binds selectively to alpha 1 subunit of the GABA A benzodiazepine receptor. Zolpidem reduces sleep latency, number of arousals and increases the total time of sleep. However, it is considered that it may increase phase 3 of non rapid eye movement sleep, where somnambulism can take place. Our aim is to report 8 cases of sleep related eating disorders associated with the use of this drug. We have evaluated the medical history of 8 patients who had received zolpidem for sleeping disorders and who have presented sleep related eating disorders. Eight patients (6 women, 2 men) aged between 32 to 72 years old, which received 10 mg of zolpidem/night except 1 that received 12.5 mg, were presented. They have referred strange eating behavior compatible to sleep related eating disorder. Symptoms appeared at a mean of 39.8 days after starting the medication. The numbers of nocturnal episodes recorded by the family or by the patient were 1 to 8 episodes of nocturnal eating per night. The morning after, patients found leftovers from the night before which they did not recall to have eaten. The remission was complete after discontinuing zolpidem. Zolpidem may induce sleep related eating disorder in about 1% of patients, although we consider there may be a subdiagnosis of this phenomenon. It will be important to bear in mind and look for this side effect because all the episodes could easily be controlled by withdrawing the drug.", 
    "11": "beta-Glucuronidase is an enzyme often employed to de-conjugate beta-glucuronides during urinary drug testing for benzodiazepines. It is commonly accepted that use of beta-glucuronidase is a preferred method of hydrolysis over acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, which is known to induce benzodiazepine degradation and transformation. Literature to date, however, has not reported any cases of benzodiazepine transformation initiated by commercial beta-glucuronidase products. In this study, urine specimens containing either oxazepam or oxazepam glucuronide were incubated with beta-glucuronidase enzymes obtained from Escherichia coli, Helix pomatia, and Patella vulgata under various incubation conditions. After liquid-liquid extraction, the extract was analyzed by both liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for the presence of benzodiazepines. All three enzyme preparations examined were capable of reducing oxazepam or oxazepam glucuronide into nordiazepam (desmethyldiazepam). Nordiazepam formation was positively correlated with incubation temperature, incubation time, oxazepam concentration, and enzyme concentration. Under all enzymatic hydrolysis conditions investigated, the percentage of nordiazepam formation is < 2.5% relative to the amount of oxazepam present in the system. The findings of this study have both clinical and forensic implications, and it is clear that the detection of nordiazepam in biological samples subjected to testing involving enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis should be interpreted with care.", 
    "12": "Fast-acting medications for the management of anxiety are important to patients and society. Measuring early onset, however, requires a sensitive and clinically responsive tool. This study evaluates the psychometric properties of a patient-reported Global Anxiety-Visual Analog Scale (GA-VAS).", 
    "13": "Data from a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of lorazepam and paroxetine in patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder were analyzed to assess the reliability, validity, responsiveness, and utility of the GA-VAS. The GA-VAS was completed at clinic visits and at home during the first week of treatment. Targeted psychometric analyses--test-retest reliabilities, validity correlations, responsiveness statistics, and minimum important differences--were conducted.", 
    "14": "The GA-VAS correlates well with other anxiety measures, at Week 4, r=0.60 (p<0.0001) with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety and r=0.74 (p<0.0001) with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety subscale. In terms of convergent and divergent validity, the GA-VAS correlated -0.54 (p<0.0001), -0.48 (p<0.0001), and -0.68 (p<0.0001) with the SF-36 Emotional Role, Social Function, and Mental Health subscales, respectively, but correlated much lower with the SF-36 physical functioning subscales. Preliminary minimum important difference estimates cluster between 10 and 15 mm.",

    "16": "Consumption of benzodiazepines (BZDs) is common among seniors. When used over a long period of time, BZDs can induce dependence. The present study aimed to equip nurses with valid screening questions for detecting BZD dependence among seniors, applicable to clinical practice and based on the DSM-IV-TR version. A random sample of 707 BZD users aged 65 years and over was screened for BZD dependence using the DSM-IV-TR criteria for substance dependence. To predict a diagnosis of BZDs dependence, sensitivity and specificity were computed for each pair of items. Results showed that an affirmative answer to 'Have you try to stop taking this medication?' and 'Over the past 12 months, have you noticed any decrease in the effect of this medication?' led to a sensitivity of 97.1% and a specificity of 94.9% to detect BZD dependence. Asking these two simple questions can be easily integrated into clinical practice and have considerable potential for identifying cases of BZD dependence.",

    "20": "The Harden and Bruehl criteria were confirmed in 95 patients (49%). These patients used a higher than average number of analgesics, opiates, and anti-oxidants, and frequently received prescriptions for benzodiazepines instead of anti-depressants. The mean disease duration was 29 +/- 4.6 months and the mean visual analogue score for pain was 8.1 +/- 0.19. A subgroup of patients had a colder temperature in the affected extremity compared with the unaffected extremity. This subgroup showed a longer disease duration and higher visual analogue scale pain.", 
    "21": "The diagnostic criteria used to determine CRPS should be further improved. A large number of referred patients experienced substantial pain, without receiving adequate medication. Disease-related medication is unrelated to CRPS-specific disease activity. Knowledge of underlying mechanisms is warranted before an adequate pharmaceutical intervention can be considered.", 
    "22": "Benzodiazepines are widely used for different purposes because of their pharmacological properties, but their abuse potential may represent a limitation to their use. Data suggest that this abuse potential may vary between products and available dosages. Doctor shopping (the simultaneous use of several physicians by a patient) is one of the most important ways in which prescription drugs, in particular benzodiazepines, are diverted.",

    "24": "All prescriptions reimbursed during the year 2003 in Haute-Garonne, France (one million inhabitants) for benzodiazepines that were available in ambulatory care through community pharmacies as solid oral forms were extracted from a reimbursement database. The benzodiazepines were alprazolam (0.25 mg, 0.50 mg), bromazepam 6 mg, clonazepam 2 mg, clorazepate (5 mg, 10 mg, 50 mg), diazepam (1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg), flunitrazepam 1 mg, lorazepam (1 mg, 2.5 mg) and tetrazepam 50 mg. For each patient, the quantities prescribed, dispensed and obtained by doctor shopping (i.e. overlap between prescriptions from different prescribers) were computed. Benzodiazepines were compared using their 'doctor shopping indicator' (DSI, the percentage of each drug obtained through doctor shopping among the total reimbursed quantity).", 
    "25": "About 128 000 patients received at least one benzodiazepine during the year. Four groups of benzodiazepines were identified according to their abuse potential: very high abuse potential (flunitrazepam, DSI = 42.8%); high abuse potential (diazepam 10 mg, DSI = 3.2%; clorazepate 50 mg, DSI = 2.7%); intermediate abuse potential (alprazolam 0.50 mg, bromazepam, clonazepam, DSI ranging from 1.8% to 1.9%); and low abuse potential (other benzodiazepines and dosages, DSI ranging from 0.3% to 1.1%).",

    "28": "An efficient and simple route for preparation of substituted 1,5-benzodiazepine-2-one containing peptoid backbone is presented. The classical Ugi reaction is considerably extended by application of o-phenylenediamine and diketene as amine and oxo component. 1,3-Dihydro-1,5-benzodiazepine-2-one is generated in situ from these two building blocks combined with isocyanide and aromatic or aliphatic carboxylic acid to assemble the multifunctionalized titled scaffold in high yields. The reaction is performed in the mixture of toluene/CH(2)Cl(2) under reflux condition without catalyst. Conformational isomerism is seen in the solution phase because of restricted free rotation around amide and C-CO bands due to steric bulk of substitutions. In single crystal state, the product is found to possess dimeric structure arising from intermolecular hydrogen bonding.", 
    "29": "The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is an endogenous signalling system which includes the endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and specific G-protein-coupled endocannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2). Recent studies have described important roles of the peripheral ECS in human atherosclerosis, cardiometabolic disorders, heart failure, and systemic inflammation. We sought to study changes in plasma endocannabinoid concentrations during cardiac surgery (CS) under general anaesthesia with isoflurane/sufentanil, and during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).", 
    "30": "We studied 30 patients undergoing CS with CPB. All patients received midazolam and sufentanil for induction and isoflurane and sufentanil for maintenance of general anaesthesia. Blood samples were drawn before and after induction of general anaesthesia, after the beginning of surgery, during and after weaning from CPB, and after admission to intensive care unit (ICU) after surgery. Endocannabinoid measurements were performed by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry.", 
    "31": "Induction of general anaesthesia led to a significant decline in plasma AEA concentrations [from mean (sd) 0.39 (0.03) to 0.27 (0.03) ng ml(-1), P<0.01]. CPB induced a pronounced increase in 2-AG concentrations [from 112.5 (163.5) to 321.0 (120.4) ng ml(-1), P<0.01], whereas AEA concentrations remained persistently low until admission to the ICU. 2-AG concentrations returned to preoperative values after surgery.", 
    "32": "General anaesthesia with isoflurane significantly reduces plasma AEA concentrations. This could be a consequence of stress reduction after loss of consciousness. The significant increase in 2-AG after initiation of CPB may be part of an inflammatory response. These findings suggest that anaesthesia and surgery have differential effects on the ECS which could have substantial clinical consequences.", 
    "33": "The aim was to describe the prescription patterns of benzodiazepines (BZD) and cyclopyrrolones (Z-drugs) in a population of medical and surgical patients prior to, during and after hospital admission.",

While in hospital, 50% were users and 17% were users at discharge and 30% during the six months follow-up period (p < 0.0001). Changes in the usage pattern were mainly due to a significant increase in Z-drug use during hospital admission combined with a decrease in BZD and Z-drug use at discharge. During hospitalisation, 40% of the 94 pre-admission non-users of BZD/Z-drugs received BZD/Z-drugs. At the time of discharge, 61% of pre-admission users had become non-users, and 8.5% of the non-users had become users. Over the 6-month post-discharge period, 29 patients (21%) received >or= 3 prescriptions for BZD/Z-drugs (chronic users) compared with 21 (16%) before admission.",

Since most fatal poisonings occur outside hospital, these must be included when studying characteristics of such deaths. The pattern of toxic agents differs between fatal and non-fatal poisonings. By including all poisoning episodes, cause-fatality rates can be calculated.", 
    "38": "Fatal and non-fatal acute poisonings in subjects aged > or =16 years in Oslo (428 198 inhabitants) were included consecutively in an observational multi-centre study including the ambulance services, the Oslo Emergency Ward (outpatient clinic), and hospitals, as well as medico-legal autopsies from 1st April 2003 to 31st March 2004. Characteristics of fatal poisonings were examined, and a comparison of toxic agents was made between fatal and non-fatal acute poisoning.",

The male-female ratio was 2:1, and the mean age was 44 years (range 19-86 years). In 92 cases (89%), death occurred outside hospital. The main toxic agents were opiates or opioids (65% of cases), followed by ethanol (9%), tricyclic anti-depressants (TCAs) (4%), benzodiazepines (4%), and zopiclone (4%). Seventy-one (69%) were evaluated as accidental deaths and 32 (31%) as suicides. In 70% of all cases, and in 34% of suicides, the deceased was classified as drug or alcohol dependent. When compared with the 2981 non-fatal acute poisonings registered during the study period, the case fatality rate was 3% (95% C.I., 0.03-0.04). Methanol, TCAs, and antihistamines had the highest case fatality rates; 33% (95% C.I., 0.008-0.91), 14% (95% C.I., 0.04-0.33), and 10% (95% C.I., 0.02-0.27), respectively.",

    "41": "A method of synthesis of pyrrolo[1,2-a][1,4]benzodiazepines is described. This method is based on the recyclization of N-(furfuryl)anthranilamides under treatment with an aq. HCl/AcOH system and allows one to form both diazepine and pyrrole rings in one step. The reaction proceeds via furan ring opening into a diketone moiety followed by consecutive interaction of the NH(2)-group with both carbonyl functions. The process is not efficient in the presence of alkyl or aryl groups on amide nitrogen due to competitive furfuryl cation elimination. But alkylation of pyrrolo[1,2-a][1,4]benzodiazepines yields efficiently the corresponding N-alkyl derivatives. Steric effects also prevent cyclization due to reversibility of diazepine ring formation under these reaction conditions. However, the corresponding pyrrolo[1,2-a][1,4]benzodiazepines can be obtained by a stepwise process, i.e., 1) furan ring opening with aq. HCl/AcOH and 2) cyclization of isolated aminodiketones under treatment with glacial acetic acid. Another efficient procedure for the synthesis of pyrrolo[1,2-a][1,4]benzodiazepines consists of acid-catalyzed furan ring opening of N-(furfuryl)-2-nitrobenzamides followed by treatment of the formed nitrodiketone with Fe/AcOH. It leads to a one pot reduction of nitro group to amine, cyclization into diazepine and pyrrole ring formation. This procedure is efficient both for substrates with steric demands and for N-alkyl- or N-aryl-N-(furfuryl)amides. The proposed approach can be also applied to the synthesis of parent pyrrolo[1,2-a][1,4]diazepines or their analogues annulated to heterocycles.",

For all patients, the midpupil-to-upper eyelid margin distance, the heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and oxygen saturation were recorded before and 1 hour after the administration of oral medication. The level of sedation at the time of surgery was measured with the Michigan University scale.", 
    "44": "The depth of sedation was significantly more pronounced with midazolam (median score = 2) than with diazepam (median score = 1). Clonidine slightly increased the level of sedation of both diazepam and midazolam. The diastolic arterial blood pressure drop with midazolam associated or not with clonidine was significantly greater than with diazepam. The mean upper eyelid margin position shift (-1.42 mm) verified when clonidine was associated with midazolam was also significantly greater than with diazepam.", 
    "45": "Oral sedation with diazepam or midazolam associated or not with clonidine is safe for ASA grade I-II patients. The systemic effects of diazepam and midazolam were small and very similar. The sedation induced by midazolam was clearly greater than that induced by diazepam.

Participants in each age group were divided into quartiles (Q1-Q4) separately for men and women according to the degree of mental distress, measured by increasing Hopkins Symptom Checklist-10 score (HSCL-10 score) at baseline. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess predictors of anxiolytic drug use.",

A survey was conducted of all Emergency Departments in England and Wales regarding their use of intranasal medication in children. Approximately 50% use intranasal medication, commonly intranasal diamorphine with sporadic use of other opiates. Intranasal midazolam is used for sedation but is less well tolerated than when administered orally. Intranasal diamorphine, however, is safe and effective in the management of pain in the paediatric emergency setting and its ease of administration makes it ideal for use in the already traumatised child.",

Significant within-group improvements in the DRS-R-98 scores over time were observed at every time point in both treatment groups; however, differences in the change of the DRS-R-98 score from baseline were not significant between the treatment groups. On the first day after drug treatment, there was a trend toward greater improvement in the DRS-R-98 score in the olanzapine group compared with the risperidone group, but it did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.076). The response rates did not differ significantly between the two groups (risperidone group: 64.7%, olanzapine group: 73.3%). However, the response to risperidone was significantly poorer in patients >or=70 years of age compared with those aged <70 years. There was no significant difference in the safety profiles, including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPSs), between the two groups.",

    "63": "Diabetes mellitus occurs in schizophrenia patients at higher rates than in the general population. Reasons for this elevated risk are poorly understood and have not been examined prospectively in antipsychotic-na\u00efve, first-episode patients. This study aims to determine which antipsychotics are associated with diabetes development in antipsychotic-na\u00efve schizophrenia patients. All antipsychotic-na\u00efve patients diagnosed with schizophrenia in Denmark between 01 January 1997 and 31 December 2004, followed until 31 December 2007, allowing for >or=3 years follow-up, unless death or diabetes onset occurred. Risk factors for the time to diabetes onset were assessed, including antipsychotics taken for at least 180 defined daily doses in the first year after first antipsychotic prescription ('initial treatment'). Risk factors for diabetes incidence were assessed, including antipsychotic use within 3 months before diabetes onset or study end ('current treatment'). Of 7139 patients, followed for 6.6 years (47,297 patient years), 307 developed diabetes (annual incidence rate: 0.65%). Time to diabetes onset was significantly shorter in patients with higher age (hazard ratio (HR): 1.03, confidence interval (CI): 1.02-1.03) and those with 'initial' treatment of olanzapine (HR: 1.41, CI: 1.09-1.83), mid-potency first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) (HR: 1.60, CI: 1.07-2.39), antihypertensive (HR: 1.87, CI: 1.13-3.09), or lipid-lowering drugs (HR: 4.67, CI: 2.19-10.00). Significant factors associated with diabetes within 3 month of its development included treatment with low-potency FGAs (odds ratio (OR): 1.52, CI: 1.14-2.02), olanzapine (OR: 1.44, CI: 1.98-1.91), and clozapine (OR: 1.67, CI: 1.14-2.46), whereas aripiprazole was associated with lower diabetes risk (OR: 0.51, CI: 0.33-0.80). In addition to general diabetes risk factors, such as age, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, diabetes is promoted in schizophrenia patients by initial and current treatment with olanzapine and mid-potency FGAs, as well as by current treatment with or low-potency first-generation antipsychotics and clozapine, whereas current aripiprazole treatment reduced diabetes risk. Patients discontinuing olanzapine or mid-potency FGA had no increased risk of diabetes compared with patient not treated with the drugs at anytime.", 
    "64": "There are indications that atypical antipsychotics differ in the probability of causing motor retardation. Whereas olanzapine seems to exert sedation, risperidone might slow patients because of parkinsonism or increased negative symptoms. Objective data on gross motor activity are not available. We present actigraphic data of 16 schizophrenia patients treated with olanzapine (mean dose, 21.1 mg/d) and 23 with risperidone (mean dose, 4.7 mg/d) to investigate possible differences in their effects on motor activity. Participants wore actigraphs continuously for 24 hours at the nondominant arm. Groups did not differ in age, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores, duration of illness, and number of episodes. Patients treated with olanzapine had higher activity levels than those treated with risperidone (P = 0.024); this effect was robust and also present after covarying for chlorpromazine equivalents and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores. Movement index (proportion of active episodes) and the average duration of immobility, however, failed to show any difference between groups. The results indicate that patients on olanzapine are more active during the day than patients on risperidone. It remains unclear whether this difference is due to subthreshold parkinsonism with risperidone or stronger beneficial effects of olanzapine on psychomotor slowing. Because the average duration of immobility remained unaffected, sedation is not likely to be the cause for the observed differences.", 
    "65": "As benzodiazepines (BZDs) have anxiolytic effects, it is expected that they influence the stress system. During short-term treatment, BZD use was found to suppress cortisol levels. However, little research has been done on the effects of long-term BZD administration on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.",

Male Wistar rats were given a single dose per group: extract of Mar (100 microL/kg), Dz (5 mg/kg), Mar plus Dz, and NaCl for control. Sixty mins after treatment, animals were sacrificed, and their brains extracted and homogenised to measure GSH, TBARS and 5-HTP levels. Na + , K + ATP ase and total ATP ase activities. GSH and TBARS did not show differences respect to controls. Na + , K + ATP ase activity was similar as well. However, groups treated with Mar, total ATPase activity decreased significantly (p < 0.05). Levels of 5-HTP decreased significantly (p = 0.0001) in rats treated either with Mar and or Dz. Mar and Dz induced biochemical effects on the serotonergic metabolism, which can alter the development and function in rat brain, because it has also been involved in scavenging free radicals present there.", 
    "71": "Use of antipsychotic medications has been associated consistently with weight gain and metabolic disturbances, and a subsequent increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Two experiments tested whether CORT 108297, a newly identified selective glucocorticoid antagonist could (i) reduce and (ii) prevent olanzapine-induced weight gain in rats. In the first experiment, rats dosed only with olanzapine gained a statistically significant amount of weight. When vehicle was added to their olanzapine dose, they continued to gain weight; when CORT 108297 was added to their regimen, they lost a significant amount of weight. Rats administered CORT 108297 plus olanzapine had significantly less abdominal fat than those who received olanzapine alone. In the second experiment, rats receiving olanzapine plus CORT 108297 gained significantly less weight than rats receiving only olanzapine. Increasing doses of CORT 108297 were associated with less weight gain.", 
    "72": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a challenging clinical complication of liver dysfunction with a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities that range from mild disturbances in cognitive function and consciousness to coma and death. The pathogenesis of HE in cirrhosis is complex and multifactorial, but a key role is thought to be played by circulating gut-derived toxins of the nitrogenous compounds, most notably ammonia. Therapeutic treatment options for HE are currently limited and have appreciable risks and benefits associated with their use. Management of HE primarily involves avoidance of precipitating factors, limitation of dietary protein intake, and administration of various ammonia-lowering therapies such as non-absorbable disaccharides and select antimicrobial agents. Non-absorbable disaccharides, such as lactulose, have traditionally been regarded as first-line pharmacotherapy for patients with HE. However, multiple adverse events have been associated with their use. In addition, recent literature has questioned the true efficacy of the disaccharides for this indication. Neomycin, metronidazole and vancomycin may be used as alternative treatments for patients intolerant or unresponsive to non-absorbable disaccharides. Antimicrobials reduce bacterial production of ammonia and other bacteria-derived toxins through suppression of intestinal flora. Neomycin has been reported to be as effective as lactulose, and similar efficacy has been reported with vancomycin and metronidazole for the management of HE. However, the adverse effects frequently associated with these antimicrobials limit their use as first-line pharmacological agents. Neomycin is the most commonly used antimicrobial for HE and, although poorly absorbed, systemic exposure to the drug in sufficient amounts causes hearing loss and renal toxicity. Long-term neomycin therapy requires annual auditory testing and continuous monitoring of renal function. Long-term use of metronidazole has been associated with neurotoxicity in patients with cirrhosis, including dose-dependent peripheral neuropathy. Vancomycin may be a safer option for HE in patients with chronic liver disease; however, limited experience, possible bacterial overgrowth and risk for enteric bacteria resistance preclude the routine use of vancomycin for HE. Rifaximin is a novel antimicrobial agent with a wide spectrum of activity that has shown promise as an alternative antimicrobial treatment option for HE. Several clinical trials have compared rifaximin to the disaccharides, lactulose and lactitol, and the antimicrobial neomycin. Rifaximin appears to be at least as effective as conventional drug therapy and has been associated with fewer adverse effects due to its limited systemic absorption. The available clinical data appear to support a favourable benefit-risk ratio for rifaximin, which has shown efficacy with an improved tolerability profile. Future studies are needed in order to truly characterize its cost effectiveness in today's healthcare environment. Other less frequently utilized alternative treatment options include administration of benzodiazepine receptor antagonists, branched-chain amino acids, ornithine aspartate, zinc supplementation, sodium benzoate, dopamine receptor agonists, acarbose and probiotics. Presently, there is relatively limited clinical data supporting their routine use in HE.",

The complex psychopharmacological effect of mexidol, thymogen and hyperbaric oxygenation was significantly higher compared to traditional therapy (neuroleptics and benzodiazepine anxiolytics) applied to patients with OCN and GTD.", 
    "74": "434 patients were treated with clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine or typical neuroleptics. Main types of undesirable effects (side-effects and complications) that affected the effectiveness of treatment were singled out. It has been shown that the reduction of effectiveness may lead to the revision of treatment plan on life-saving indications or due to ethical considerations, the maintenance of therapeutic collaboration or the negative attitude of relatives to treatment. The data obtained suggest a different effect of side-effects on the effectiveness of treatment with atypical and typical antipsychotic drugs.", 
    "75": "We examined 72 patients with headache of tension (HAT), 56 women and 16 men, aged from 18 to 45 years (mean age 32,7+/-8,5 years). Frequent HAT was diagnosed in 48 cases and chronic HAT - in 24 cases. Clinical-psychological and electroencephalographic study was conducted before and after the treatment with adaptol. The results were compared to those of the control group. This group included 30 patients treated with alprazolam. Two clinical variants of the disease were singled out: asthenic (25 patients) and anxiety (47 patients). The correctness of the identification was confirmed by electroencephalographic data. The higher efficacy of adaptol was noted in frequent HAT. During the treatment, there was the reduction of severity of cephalgia syndrome and of anxiety and asthenic scores as well, while depression scores did not change. Adaptol was more effective compared to alprazolam.", 
    "76": "The evidence evaluating daily interruption of sedation (DIS) in mechanically ventilated patients, the benefits of this intervention, and the barriers to its incorporation into clinical practice are reviewed.", 
    "77": "Recent epidemiologic studies have identified a high prevalence of oversedation in the intensive care unit (ICU). The practice of DIS, which involves withholding all sedative and analgesic medications until patients are awake on a daily basis, can limit excessive sedation. DIS has been shown to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay, lessen the number of neurodiagnostic tests to assess for changes in mental status, decrease the frequency of complications associated with critical illness, and reduce the total dose of benzodiazepines and opiates administered. Although recent studies support the use of DIS, it remains underutilized in clinical practice and additional trials may be needed before this intervention will gain widespread acceptance. Barriers to the use of DIS include a lack of nursing acceptance and concerns regarding patient removal of invasive devices, patient discomfort, respiratory compromise, and withdrawal syndromes. Some clinicians are also concerned about the possibility of long-term psychological sequelae and the risk of myocardial ischemia during DIS in patients with coronary risk factors.", 
    "78": "DIS limits oversedation in the ICU without compromising patient comfort or safety and should be incorporated into the routine care of mechanically ventilated patients. Clinicians should be aware of the numerous barriers that prevent the use of DIS and address these at their institution to increase its use.",

As part of a quality assurance program we used our computerized anesthetic record system database to evaluate incidence of patients having very severe postoperative pain (grade 4 on a subjective pain scale ranging from 0 to 4) in the Post Anesthetic Care Unit during a two year period. These patients were compared to a control group matched on age, type and date of surgery. Demographic characteristics, type and duration of the surgery, preoperative and intra-operative medications were compared between groups.",

Patients in the cases study group had significantly more preoperative psychoactive medication: antidepressant and benzodiazepine 13 vs. 2, (p<0.05).", 
    "81": "The incidence of severe postoperative pain scores were less than 1% in our institution. In patients with preoperative opioid treatment, adaptation of analgesic treatment has probably prevented the occurrence of severe pain.

    "82": "This trial assessed the effects of two doses of clonidine compared with placebo on the quality and speed of recovery in children premedicated with oral midazolam and anaesthetised with sevoflurane for cataract surgery. One hundred and twenty American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I to II children (aged one to six years), premedicated with oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg and undergoing elective unilateral cataract surgery with sevoflurane anaesthesia were studied. Children were randomised to intravenous clonidine 1 microg/kg (group C1, n=39), 2 microg/kg (group C2, n=41) or normal saline (group NS, n=40). Clinically successful sub-Tenon local anaesthesia block was required for a patient to be included in the analysis. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative agitation. Postoperative agitation was defined as a Pain Discomfort Score of -3 using items 3 to 5 only, which was assessed 15 minutely until discharge. Agitation was observed in 11/40 (27.5%) children in the NS group compared to 2/39 (5.1%) in group Cl and none in group C2 (P < 0.001). Rescue medication to treat severe agitation was required in 5/40 (12.5%) in the NS group, 1/39 (2.6%) in group C1 and none in group C2 (P = 0.025). Time to meet discharge criteria was significantly shorter in group C1 compared to the other two groups (48.4 +/- 14.0 minutes compared to C2 79.5 +/- 12.8 minutes and NS 73.1 +/- 20.4 minutes, P < 0.001). There were no significant effects on blood pressure and heart rate. Intravenous clonidine 1 microg/kg is effective for reducing agitation after sevoflurane anaesthesia and midazolam premedication in children undergoing cataract surgery. Intravenous clonidine 2 microg/kg was also effective and for a longer period, but was associated with a longer time to discharge.", 
    "83": "The objective of our study was to determine the maximal non-reactive concentrations for midazolam and ketamine in healthy volunteers using both prick and intradermal skin tests. Twenty-one healthy Caucasian volunteers were tested for midazolam and ketamine using more clustered concentrations (identical for both prick and intradermal tests) than those resulting from decimal dilutions. The criteria for positivity were based on dilutions of drugs that cause wheal and flare reactions in subjects without history of allergy. For the prick method, the concentrations that did not produce wheal and flare were 1 mg/ml for midazolam and 10 mg/ml for ketamine. For intradermal tests, using serial dilutions, we found that the highest concentration for which the subjects did not pass the positivity criteria was 0.25 mg/ml for both drugs.", 
    "84": "Nausea and vomiting are frequent adverse effects of patient-controlled analgesia with opioids. This study was designed to compare the effect of midazolam to that of ondansetron for prevention of nausea and vomiting during morphine patient-controlled analgesia. In a randomised, double-blind, prospective trial, 90 patients were allocated to one of three groups of 30 each, to receive one of three patient-controlled analgesia regimens to manage postoperative pain: a combination of midazolam and morphine (group M), a mixture of ondansetron and morphine (group O) or morphine alone (group C). Patients were assessed for the incidence of nausea and vomiting, the degree of sedation (awake, mild, moderate, deep) and other side-effects during the first 24 hours after the operation. The frequency of nausea and vomiting was significantly lower in groups M (27%) and O (37%) compared with group C (70%) (P < 0.05). The incidence of mild sedation in group M was significantly higher than that in groups O or C (P < 0.05). We conclude that midazolam is as effective as ondansetron in preventing opioid-induced nausea and vomiting following total abdominal hysterectomy and has acceptable side-effects.",

Kainate receptors (KARs) play an important role in sensory transmission. Five different KAR subunits have been cloned and the expression of the KAR subunits showed developmental changes. In this study, RT-PCR, western blotting, immunohistochemistry and a patch clamp technique were used examine the functional expression of the GluR5 subunit in the SG of the Vc in juvenile, peripubertal and/or adult mice. The levels of mRNA and protein expression of the GluR5 subunit in the SG of the Vc were higher in the juvenile mice than in the peripubertal or adult mice. In addition, the KA and ATPA, a GluR5 KAR agonist, induced membrane depolarization on the SG neurons in both juvenile and adult mice in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the juvenile SG neurons showed a stronger response to KA and ATPA than those of adults. The membrane depolarization by KA was suppressed slightly in the presence of the AMPA receptor antagonist, GYKI 52466. These results show that the GluR5 KAR subunits are expressed functionally on the SG neurons of the Vc in mice, and the expression levels of the GluR5 subunits decrease with postnatal development. These postnatal changes in the GluR5 KAR subunit may be a possible mechanism for age-dependent pain processing.",

Fibers derivatized using n-butyl, n-octyl, n-octadecyl and n-triacontyl groups were shown to extract benzodiazepines successfully. The coatings were determined to have an average thickness of ca. 8 microm, as determined by a scanning electron microscope, permitting equilibrium times as fast as 2 min. The fibers also showed very good ruggedness towards a vast range of solvents and prolonged use. It was determined that greater extraction efficiencies could be obtained using triacontyl as an extraction phase. The C18 and C30 fibers were also found to provide good linearity (>0.99) for the model analytes over two orders of magnitude, with limits of detection in the sub ng mL(-1) levels. C30 fibers were used to establish a correlation between structurally diverse beta-blockers and their literature reported Log P values. The C30 fibers provided a good correlation (R(2)=0.9255) between beta-blockers ranging in hydrophobicity from Log P(literature) 0.16-4.15 and their respective experimentally determined Log K(spme) values.", 
    "121": "In humans, slow-wave sleep (SWS) consists of stages 3 and 4 of non rapid eye movement (nonREM) sleep. The low-frequency, high-amplitude slow waves that dominate the electroencephalogram (EEG) during SWS can be quantified as slow-wave activity (SWA). SWS and SWA are regulated very accurately in response to variations in the duration and intensity of wakefulness and sleep. SWA declines more or less independently of circadian phase during the course of a sleep episode, indicating that it is primarily under homeostatic rather than circadian control. An age-related decline in SWS and SWA is well established. In some studies, apprehension, depression and insomnia have been associated with reductions in SWS and SWA. Experimental reductions of SWS through SWS deprivation (without altering total sleep time or REM duration) have been reported to lead to an increase in daytime sleep propensity and reductions in performance. SWS and SWA are therefore thought to contribute to the recovery processes that occur during sleep. Most currently prescribed hypnotics, such as the benzodiazepines and Z-drugs, suppress SWA. Some compounds have been shown to enhance SWS and SWA in healthy volunteers through GAT-1 inhibition, GABA-A modulation, GABA-B modulation, and 5HT2(A) antagonism. Pharmacological enhancement of SWS has also been observed in insomnia. The effects of SWS enhancement on other sleep parameters will be discussed.",

Most respondents (94.1%) suspected that some level of abuse/misuse occurred in their pharmacy, which was highest for decongestants, cough/cold preparations, benzodiazepines, and antibiotics.

Age-related changes in the way drugs work cause adverse effects such as hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, memory loss, drowsiness, cognitive and psychomotor impairment. All psychotropics increase the risk of falls and fractures. Long-term use may also lead to increased tolerance, dependency, poor sleep or depression. Benzodiazepine use should be limited to short-term relief of severe anxiety or primary insomnia.", 
    "124": "Abstract Purpose. The use of benzodiazepines remains a source of controversy. Some prescribers believe that they are beneficial and espouse their use; others regard their risk:benefit ratio as too adverse for any but occasional use. This review considers these viewpoints based on the appropriate literature. Survey. The recent English-language literature relating to this topic was surveyed. The publications proved too heterogeneous for a formal meta-analysis, so a descriptive review is provided. Overview. Surveys of benzodiazepine use provide data mainly from the UK, Europe and North America. Prescribing patterns varied widely but long-term usage is common and sometimes the norm. Conclusions. Long-term prescription of benzodiazepines still takes place despite general warnings from the medical and other professions and drug regulatory bodies that long-term use is unjustified both from the lack of a systemic database establishing such efficacy and a large literature documenting the risks of long-term usage, such as dependence. The young and the old are particularly at risk. Continued monitoring is essential, but the regulatory authorities may need to take a more active role in curbing such undesirable practice.", 
    "125": "Status epilepticus (SE) is one of the most commonly occurring neurologic emergencies. About 40% of SE cases occur in people with epilepsy. Convulsive SE is easily recognized, but nonconvulsive SE is not and requires both a high index of suspicion and EEG confirmation. SE has a high mortality risk and requires rapid effective treatment for optimal response to therapy and outcome. The goal of treatment is to stop all clinical and electrographic seizures while maintaining vital functions. If seizures continue after initial treatment with a benzodiazepine, additional antiepileptic therapy should be administered. When SE is refractory to these treatments, continuous IV infusion with midazolam, propofol, or a barbiturate suppresses seizure activity. Standard treatment protocols are useful in promoting rapid intervention with appropriate medications.",

However, several drug combinations are usually used to treat emesis. Current research has identified several receptors that trigger nausea and vomiting, hence the difficulty of using only 1 medication to provide relief. Olanzapine is a drug approved for treatment of schizophrenia and mania. It blocks multiple neurotransmitters dopaminergic, serotonergic, adrenergic (alpha(1)), histaminergic, and muscarinic receptors. Most of these receptors are also involved in causing emesis.

FNP inhibited the binding of [(3)H]Ro15-1788 and [(3)H]Ro15-4513 in a dose-dependent manner in the mouse cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, both in vitro and in vivo. \u03b2-CCE also inhibited the binding of [(3)H]Ro15-1788 and [(3)H]Ro15-4513 in all the aforementioned brain regions in vitro. However, in vivo, \u03b2-CCE inhibited the binding of [(3)H]Ro15-4513 in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, but not in the hippocampus, even at an injected dose of up to 1mg/kg. In contrast, more than 50% of the in vivo binding of [(3)H]Ro15-1788 was inhibited by 1 mg/kg of \u03b2-CCE in all regions. The time-activity curve of [(3)H]Ro15-4513 in the hippocampus also showed no alteration of the peak uptake between the control group and 0.3 mg/kg of \u03b2-CCE coinjected group. These results indicated that the binding characteristics of [(3)H]Ro15-4513 with the BZ receptor differed markedly between the in vitro and in vivo condition, and the selectivity of [(3)H]Ro15-4513 binding to \u03b15 subtype of BZ receptor in the mouse brain seemed to be remarkable under the in vivo condition.", 
    "136": "In elderly patients, insomnia is a common symptom. Insomnia exerts immediate negative effects on quality of life, but also shows a strong bidirectional relationship with serious medical problems. The complex etiology of insomnia in elderly persons warrants meticulous diagnostic assessment. In patients with secondary insomnia, therapy of the causative factors is initiated. Non-pharmacological therapies and behavioral advice constitute the mainstay of symptomatic treatment of insomnia. However, in elderly persons, the efficacy of these measures has not been well established. In general, the therapeutic benefit of hypnotic drugs is small. On the other hand, most substances may have considerable negative side effects. For short-term symptomatic treatment of acute insomnia, hypnotic drugs may be employed. For this indication, Benzodiazepine receptor agonists and prolonged-release Melatonin are drugs of first choice. Generally, prolonged treatment of chronic insomnia in elderly patients is not indicated due to the unclear long-term efficacy and negative side effects of the hypnotic drugs currently available.", 
    "137": "The heterogeneity and distribution of GABA(A) receptor subunits mediates differential roles in behavior. It is thought that particular behavioral responses to benzodiazepine (BZ) ligands might be associated with an action at a regionally defined receptor subtype. However, the role of specific GABA(A) receptor subtypes in particular brain regions is less clear. Such detailed knowledge of regional alpha1-GABA(A) receptor function will advance our understanding of the neural circuitry underlying the role of GABA(A) receptors and the effects of GABA(A)-modulating drugs on behavior. By combining inducible, site-specific alpha1 subunit deletion, using a lentivirus expressing Cre-recombinase in mice with the alpha1 subunit gene flanked by loxP sites, we examine baseline and pharmacological effects of deletion of amygdala alpha1-GABA(A) receptors. We find that amygdala-specific reduction of alpha1 receptor subunits does not affect mRNA or protein levels of amygdala alpha2 or alpha3 subunit receptors. Nor does this inducible reduction affect baseline locomotion or measures of anxiety. However, we also find that this inducible, site-specific deletion does disrupt the normal sedative-locomotor inhibition as well as the anticonvulsive effects, of two distinct BZ-site ligands, diazepam and zolpidem, which is relatively alpha1-subunit selective. These data, using inducible, region and subunit-specific deletion, combined with pharmacogenetic approaches, demonstrate that amygdala expression of the alpha1-GABA(A) receptor subunit is required for normal BZ effects on sedation, locomotion, and seizure inhibition, but not for anxiolysis.",

Rhei Rhizoma extract (100 microg/ml) significantly suppressed the CYP3A-mediated 6beta-hydroxylation of testosterone in hepatic microsomes, and increased the extent of bioavailability of midazolam, a typical CYP3A substrate, in rats. Also, Rhei Rhizoma extract (300 microg/ml) significantly suppressed P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux transport of rhodamine 123 (Rho123) in rat everted intestine. In an in-vivo study, Rhei Rhizoma extract added to intestinal perfusate at a concentration of 300 microg/ml significantly suppressed the intestinal exsorption of Rho123, though it exerted no effect on the biliary excretion of Rho123. Furthermore, the in-vitro and in-vivo MRP2-mediated intestinal efflux of 2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione was significantly suppressed by Rhei Rhizoma extract (1000 microg/ml). In conclusion, Rhei Rhizoma extract, which is taken orally at doses of 0.5-1 g each or 1-3 g daily in clinical practice, may cause pharmacokinetic herb-drug interactions in the process of the intestinal and/or hepatic CYP3A-mediated drug metabolism and P-glycoprotein- and/or MRP2-mediated efflux transport in the intestine.",

The aim of this study was to explore the potential utility of HepG2 cells transduced with adenovirus vectors expressing a single cytochrome P450 enzyme (Ad-CYP1A2, Ad-CYP2C9, or Ad-CYP3A4) for metabolic clearance predictions. The kinetics of metabolite formation from phenacetin, tolbutamide, and alprazolam and midazolam, selected as substrates probes for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, respectively, were characterized in this in vitro system. The magnitude of the K(m) or S(50) values observed in Ad-P450 cells was similar to those found in the literature for other human liver-derived systems. For each substrate, CL(int) (or CL(max)), values from Ad-P450 systems were scaled to human hepatocytes in primary culture using the relative activity factor (RAF) approach. Scaled Ad-P450 CL(int) values were approximately 3- to 6-fold higher (for phenacetin O-deethylation, tolbutamide 4-hydroxylation, and alprazolam 4-hydroxyaltion) or lower (midazolam 1'-hydroxylation) than those reported for human cryopreserved hepatocytes in suspension. Comparison with the in vivo data reveals that Ad-P450 cells provide a favorable prediction of CL(int) for the substrates studied (in a range of 20-200% in vivo observed CL(int)). This is an improvement compared with the consistent underpredictions (<10-50% in in vivo observed CL(int)) found in cryopreserved hepatocyte studies with the same substrates.

This is a consecutive series of 26 newborns with CHD of which 16 patients underwent cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery and 10 patients did not. aEEG was monitored for at least 12 h preoperatively and started within the first 6 h postoperatively for 48 h. Outcome was assessed at 1 year of age. All 26 patients showed a normal preoperative continuous cerebral activity with sleep-wake cycles (SWC). The postoperative duration to return to normal background activity with SWC was similar for both groups. Independent of group assignment, patients requiring midazolam had a significantly later onset of a normal SWC than those without midazolam (p=0.03). Three patients in the CPB group and two in the non-CPB group showed continuous low voltage or flat trace after administration of fentanyl. These changes did not correlate with neurodevelopmental outcome. Sedation with midazolam has a transient effect on the background activity, whereas fentanyl can induce a severe pathologic background pattern. The significance of these changes on outcome is not yet clear. Thus, more attention should be paid to these effects when interpreting aEEG in this population.",

Multi-analyte procedures are preferable because they make the analytical strategy much simpler and cheaper and allow monitoring of analytes of different drug classes in one single body sample. For development of such a multi-analyte liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry approach, a rapid and simple method for the extraction of 136 analytes from the following drug classes has been established: antidepressants, neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, beta-blockers, oral antidiabetics, and analytes relevant in the context of brain death diagnosis. Recovery, matrix effects, and process efficiency were tested at two concentrations using six different lots of blank plasma. The recovery results obtained using absolute peak areas were compared with those calculated using area ratios analyte/internal standard. The recoveries ranged from 8% to 84% for antidepressants, from 10% to 79% for neuroleptics, from 60% to 81% for benzodiazepines, from 1% to 71% for beta-blockers, from 10% to 73% for antidiabetics, and from 60% to 86% for analytes relevant in the context of brain death diagnosis. With the exception of 52 analytes at low concentration and 37 at high concentration, all compounds showed recoveries with acceptable variability with less than 15% and 20% coefficients of variation. Recovery results obtained by comparing peak area ratios were nearly the same, but 35 analytes at low concentration and 17 at high concentration lay above the acceptance criteria. Matrix effects with more than 25% were observed for 18 analytes. The results were acceptable for 119 analytes at high concentrations.",

Surprisingly, chronic treatment also appears to lower free fatty acids (FFAs). This finding is paradoxical because insulin resistance is typically associated with elevated not lower FFAs. How atypical antipsychotics bring about these converse changes in plasma glucose and FFAs is unknown. Chronic treatment with olanzapine, a prototypical, side effect prone atypical antipsychotic, lowered FFA in Sprague-Dawley rats. Olanzapine also lowered plasma FFA acutely, concomitantly impairing in vivo lipolysis and robustly elevating whole-body lipid oxidation. Increased lipid oxidation was evident from accelerated losses of triglycerides after food deprivation or lipid challenge, elevated FFA uptake into most peripheral tissues (\u223c2-fold) except heart, rises in long-chain 3-hydroxylated acyl-carnitines observed in diabetes, and rapid suppression of the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) during the dark cycle. Normal rises in RER following refeeding, a sign of metabolic flexibility, were severely blunted by olanzapine. Increased lipid oxidation in muscle could be explained by \u223c50% lower concentrations of the negative cytoplasmic regulator of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, malonyl-CoA. This was associated with loss of anapleurotic metabolites and citric acid cycle precursors of malonyl-CoA synthesis rather than adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase activation or direct ACC1/2 inhibition. The ability of antipsychotics to lower dark cycle RER in mice corresponded to their propensities to cause metabolic side effects. Our studies indicate that lipocentric mechanisms or altered intermediary metabolism could underlie the FFA lowering and hyperglycemia (Randle cycle) as well as some of the other side effects of atypical antipsychotics, thereby suggesting strategies for alleviating them.",

The study was cross-sectional and included 253 patients with chronic pain at a tertiary pain centre. Patients were screened for addiction by a physician and a nurse. The addiction prevalence was 14.4% according to ICD-10 and 19.3% according to PC. A significant difference between the prevalence of addiction according to ICD-10 and to PC was found. The inter-rater reliability was 0.95 for ICD-10 and 0.93 for PC. The sensitivity of PC was 0.85 and the specificity was 0.96. According to PC patients classified as addicted were treated with significantly higher opioid doses, drank more alcohol, smoked more tobacco, used benzodiazepines and had higher levels of depression. According to ICD-10 patients classified as addicted used higher doses of opioids, drank more alcohol and had higher scores of anxiety and depression. High opioid doses, concomitant use of alcohol and younger age were risk factors. The risk profile for PC was different to ICD-10 by adding risk factors as concomitant use of benzodiazepines, having depression and low educational level.

A comprehensive toxicological analysis with GC-MS was performed on the deceased's autopsy samples (femoral blood, bile, kidney, gastric content). The results revealed the presence of topiramate at a concentration of 49mg/L in the femoral blood sample, thus clearly exceeding the therapeutic range. Additionally, citalopram (0.85mg/L) and flunitrazepam in traces (<2\u03bcg/L) were detected in peripheral blood.

Potential adverse-effect profiles of interactions of STP with CLB and VPA at the fixed-ratio of 1:1 in the MES test with respect to motor performance, long-term memory and skeletal muscular strength were measured along with total brain antiepileptic drug concentrations. In the mouse MES model, STP administered singly had its DRRC non-parallel to that for CLB and, simultaneously, parallel to that for VPA. With type I isobolography for parallel DRRCs, the combinations of STP with VPA at three fixed-ratios of 1:3, 1:1 and 3:1 exerted sub-additive (antagonistic) interaction. Isobolography for non-parallel DRRCs revealed that the combination of STP with CLB at the fixed-ratio of 1:1 produced additive interaction. For all combinations, neither motor coordination, long-term memory nor muscular strength was affected. Total brain antiepileptic drug concentrations revealed bi-direction changes with the most profound being an 18.6-fold increase in CLB by STP and a 2.3-fold increase in STP by VPA. In conclusion, the additive interaction between STP and CLB was associated with a concurrent pharmacokinetic interaction and these data may explain the clinical efficacy seen with this combination. In contrast, the antagonism between STP and VPA was surprising since synergism is observed clinically.",

    "231": "A case of apparent gabapentin withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation of gabapentin therapy is reported.", 
    "232": "A 53-year-old woman had coffee ground emesis, a two-day history of black tarry stools, and abdominal pain. The patient did have an elevated ethanol concentration (323 mg/dL), with the last reported ingestion of ethanol about 12 hours before admission. Her medical history included liver cirrhosis secondary to ethanol abuse, ascites, portal hypertension, esophageal varices (with previous band ligation three weeks prior), anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, neuropathic pain, and depression. Her home medications included spironolactone, nadolol, lactulose, ursodiol, ferrous sulfate, omeprazole, gabapentin, citalopram, and trazodone. She was admitted to the intensive care unit, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed, with 12 band ligations applied. After the procedure, she ingested nothing orally, including home medications, for the first two days. On day 3 of hospitalization, she developed restlessness, disorientation, confusion, agitation, and anxiety. She was presumed to be suffering from ethanol withdrawal and was treated with benzodiazepines but had no improvement in symptoms. During days 4 and 5, the patient became increasingly confused, agitated, and anxious, with complaints of headache, light sensitivity, and increasing nervousness. On day 5, gabapentin was reinitiated, and the patient's confusion and agitation improved that evening. The next morning, the patient was calm, alert, and cooperative. Her symptoms resolved, and she was discharged on hospital day 7.", 
    "233": "A patient developed apparent withdrawal symptoms beginning two days after gabapentin therapy was discontinued. The symptoms were unresponsive to treatment with benzodiazepines but completely resolved with the reinitiation of gabapentin therapy.", 
    "234": "Changes in cortical \u03b3-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) receptors and muscarinic receptors have been reported in schizophrenia, a disorder treated with antipsychotic drugs and benzodiazepines. As there is a reported functional relationship between the GABAergic and cholinergic systems in the human central nervous system we have investigated whether there are changes in the GABA(A) and muscarinic receptors in the cortex of subjects from APD-treated subjects with schizophrenia and whether changes were different in subjects who had also received benzodiazepine treatment. We failed to show any strong correlations between changes in GABA(A) and muscarinic receptors in the CNS of subjects with schizophrenia. We showed that subjects with schizophrenia treated with benzodiazepines had lower levels of muscarinic receptors; which was not the case in rats treated with APDs, benzodiazepines or a combination of both drugs. Further, the benzodiazepine binding site, but not the muscimol binding site, was decreased in the parietal cortex of subjects with schizophrenia independent of benzodiazepine status at death. These data would therefore support our previously stated hypotheses that changes in the cortical cholinergic and GABAergic systems are involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.", 
    "235": "The purpose of this retrospective chart review was to document sedation and analgesic medications administered preoperotively, intraoperatively, and during postanesthesia care for children undergoing dental rehabilitation using general anesthesia (GA).", 
    "236": "Patient gender, age, procedure type performed, and ASA status were recorded from the medical charts of children undergoing GA for dental rehabilitation. The sedative and analgesic drugs administered pre-, intra-, and postoperatively were recorded. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and cross-tabulation.", 
    "237": "A sample of 115 patients with a mean age of 64 (+/-30) months was studied; 47% were females, and 71% were healthy. Over 80% of the patients were administered medications primarily during pre- and intraoperative phases, with fewer than 25% receiving medications postoperatively. Morphine and fentanyl were the most frequently administered agents intraoperatively. The procedure type, gender, and health status were not statistically associated with the number of agents administered. Younger patients, however, were statistically more likely to receive additional analgesic medications.", 
    "238": "Our study suggests that a minority of patients have postoperative discomfort in the postanesthesia care unit; mild to moderate analgesics were administered during intraoperative phases of dental rehabilitation."
