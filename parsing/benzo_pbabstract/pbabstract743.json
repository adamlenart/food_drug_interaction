    "0": "A double-blind study was completed comparing the interaction of chlordiazepoxide (Librium), 10 mg. given three times for one day, and 6 oz. of Canadian rye whiskey given over a three-hour period in the evening of the same day. The comparison drug was a placebo. Four evening experiments were conducted using the same six normal subjects and two observers. At the end of the evening, the observers were unable to detect which subjects had had placebo or chlordiazepoxide. It was concluded that chlordiazepoxide, given in this recommended daily dose, did not potentiate what was considered a social quantity of alcohol."
