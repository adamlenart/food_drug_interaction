Triazolam was chosen for study to examine experimentally whether it produces greater behavioral impairment than other benzodiazepines as reported previously. Lorazepam was chosen as the comparison drug because of its well documented behavioral effects and because it has a short metabolic half-life and no active metabolite, which eliminates the possible confounding effects of drug accumulation. Drug effects were assessed before and every 30 min for 8 hr after drug administration. Learning was chosen for study because it is a fundamental component of more complex behavioral processes such as recall, and benzodiazepines are known to disrupt learning. A psychomotor task and subject-rating scales, assessing drug effects and abuse potential, were also included to provide a more comprehensive comparison of these compounds. Triazolam and lorazepam dose-dependently disrupted learning and psychomotor performance and increased subject ratings of sedation to a comparable degree. These findings do not support allegations that triazolam produces greater behavioral impairment than other commonly used benzodiazepines.", 
    "1": "Although acute tolerance to selected effects of many benzodiazepines is known to occur, acute tolerance to triazolam has not been documented even in studies that have included pharmacodynamic modeling. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether acute tolerance to triazolam occurs in humans. Intravenous bolus doses of triazolam were used to individualize two subsequent intravenous infusions: one to achieve and maintain a constant triazolam concentration and one to achieve a series of incremental steady-state concentrations; a placebo treatment was also included. Ten healthy men completed the four single-dose treatments. Serial blood sampling and psychomotor and memory testing were done. In the constant infusion treatment, mean performance impairment was greatest at 1 h and then decreased rapidly despite maintenance of a mean triazolam concentration of 2.48 ng/ml for 9 h. Neither learning nor changes in free concentration account for the observations. Additionally, data from the step-infusion treatment indicate that the triazolam effect-concentration relationship after a single dose can be altered by rate of administration. Because tolerance develops, the administration of drug in small increments results in an increased effect at a lower concentration, with a blunted maximal response. Furthermore, our data suggest intersubject variability in the rate of development of acute tolerance. Patients who develop tolerance more slowly would experience a longer duration of effect. Further study regarding the rate of development of tolerance to specific effects and in different patient populations is warranted.", 
    "2": "The binding of the muscarinic antagonist 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide (4-DAMP), which has been suggested as an M3-selective antagonist in peripheral tissues, was examined through quantitative autoradiographic techniques in brain. The ability of 4-DAMP to displace [3H](R)-quinuclindinyl benzilate (QNB) binding to rat brain sections was compared with the known distribution of M1 and M2 muscarinic receptor subtypes as measured previously with pirenzepine and AF-DX 116 (Messer et al., 1989a). 4-DAMP displayed a high affinity for [3H](R)-QNB binding sites in rat brain sections. Analysis of 4-DAMP binding to various brain regions revealed heterogeneous binding profiles, suggesting an interaction with multiple receptor sites. Quantification of the autoradiograms indicated that 4-DAMP bound with the highest affinity to muscarinic receptors in the midline thalamus (IC50 values < 30 nM), and had a slightly lower affinity for hippocampal receptors (IC50 values between 30 and 46 nM). 4-DAMP also displayed a lower affinity for cortical receptors with IC50 values between 30 and 50 nM. The binding profile of the putative M3 muscarinic antagonist did not exhibit a marked selectivity for any single region of brain. The data suggest that whereas 4-DAMP may be selective for M3 receptors in peripheral tissues, it has limited selectivity in the CNS. Minimum energy conformations for 4-DAMP were calculated using molecular mechanics calculations. 4-DAMP displayed two global minimum energy conformations, differing in the relative position of the piperidine ring with respect to the aromatic rings. The minimum energy conformations of 4-DAMP were compared with conformations generated for pirenzepine (Messer et al., 1989a). The lowest energy conformation of 4-DAMP was superimposable on the lowest energy conformation of pirenzepine (RMS = 0.297 A). It is suggested that the conformations available to 4-DAMP permit binding to several muscarinic receptors in the CNS.", 
    "3": "The stability of midazolam hydrochloride in flavored gelatin was evaluated after storage at 4 degrees C for 14 days and at -20 degrees C for 28 days. A flavored liquid gelatin mixture was prepared and mixed with midazolam hydrochloride injection in final concentrations of midazolam 1 and 2 mg/mL. Gelatin cups containing 5 and 15 mg of midazolam were prepared by measuring appropriate volumes of the gelatin stock solutions and were stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or in a freezer at -20 degrees C. Immediately after preparation and at 7 and 14 days, three refrigerated and three frozen gelatin samples of each midazolam concentration were visually inspected, tested for pH, and assayed for midazolam concentration by high-performance liquid chromatography. The frozen gelatin samples were also evaluated at 21 and 28 days; three whole and three partial gelatin samples were assayed for midazolam content to determine the uniformity of drug distribution within each sample. All samples maintained greater than 96% of the initial midazolam concentration throughout the study. There was no appreciable change in color, odor, or pH. The midazolam content of the gelatin in the cups was uniform. An extemporaneously compounded preparation of midazolam hydrochloride in flavored gelatin was stable when stored for 14 days at 4 degrees C and for 28 days at -20 degrees C. Distribution of midazolam hydrochloride in the gelatin was uniform.", 
    "4": "Sedating children safely and effectively for minor laceration repair is a well-recognized clinical problem. A randomized, double-blind, and controlled study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal midazolam for reducing stress during the suturing of lacerations in preschool children. Fifty-nine children with simple lacerations that required suturing were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Group 1 received intranasal midazolam, 0.4 mg/kg, prior to suturing. Group 2 received an equivalent volume of normal saline intranasally prior to suturing as a placebo. Group 3 was the control group and received no intervention prior to suturing. Heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and pulse oximetry were monitored at 5-minute intervals throughout the procedure. Subjective variables were also measured at 5-minute intervals and included a cry score, a motion score, and a struggle score. Parent satisfaction was measured via a short telephone interview the following day. There were no significant differences in outcome between the placebo group and the control group. Their results were pooled and compared with the results for the midazolam group. The midazolam group showed significant reductions for mean heart rate, maximum heart rate, and maximum systolic blood pressure when compared with the placebo/control group. Scores for two of the three subjective variables, cry and struggle, were significantly reduced for the midazolam group. The papoose board was considered unnecessary in retrospect for more than half of patients in the midazolam group compared with only one fifth of patients in the placebo/control group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, is useful in reversing the sedation and respiratory depression that often occur when benzodiazepines are administered to patients undergoing anesthesia or when patients have taken an intentional benzodiazepine overdose. Judicious use of flumazenil may provide useful diagnostic information and may obviate the need for mechanical ventilation and other invasive supportive measures. Although some controversy exists regarding the possible precipitation of seizure activity in the setting of mixed tricyclic antidepressant-benzodiazepine overdose, worldwide experience with flumazenil has validated its safety and efficacy.",

The effects of zopiclone 10mg (ZP), flunitrazepam 1mg (FN), triazolam 0.25mg (TZ) and levomepromazine 5mg (LP) on two models of sleep-wake schedule change-6 hours advanced shift: (A-shift), and 6 hours delayed: (D-shift)--were investigated in 6 healthy volunteers using polysomnography. 2. In A-shift with placebo, TST, SEI, %SR and REM/NREM decreased. ZP, FN and TZ shortened SL. All drugs increased TST and SEI. TZ and LP increased %SR and REM/NREM. 3. In D-shift with placebo, TST decreased, SWSL was prolonged, %S3+4 decreased, and %SR and REM/NREM increased. All drugs increased TST. ZP and LP shortened SWSL. All drugs increased %SWS. ZP, FN and TZ decreased %SR. ZP and FN decreased REM/NREM. 4. Daytime mental and physical conditions were worse than usual on more than half of the days in A- and D-shift. LP and FN caused some inadequate conditions on the following days. Significantly higher REM/NREM was observed in the nights before the days with worse mental conditions in D-shift, and lower REM/NREM in the nights before the days with worse physical conditions in A-shift. 5. It is concluded that TZ and ZP are superior to the others for A-shift and D-shift, respectively.", 
    "7": "Anesthetic doses of ethanol (100 mmol/kg p.o.), chloral hydrate (2 mmol/kg i.p.), and urethane (9 mmol/kg i.p.) induce sharp and sustained (6- to 10-fold) dose-dependent increase in rat brain pregnenolone and progesterone content. In contrast, other general anesthetics such as ketamine (0.7 mmol/kg i.p.) and pentobarbital (0.2 mmol/kg i.p.), and the sedative/hypnotic clonazepam (17 mumol/kg i.p.) decrease brain pregnenolone and progesterone content. The increase in brain pregnenolone and progesterone content fails to occur if ethanol, chloral hydrate, and urethane are administered to hypophysectomized-adrenalectomized rats suggesting that the increase of brain steroids requires the hypophysis and probably originates in peripheral tissues and not in brain. The administration to hypophysectomized rats of 5 IU/kg of ACTH produces a brain pregnenolone and progesterone accumulation by an extent comparable to that elicited by anesthetic doses of ethanol, chloral hydrate, or urethane in intact animals. However, the increase in brain pregnenolone and progesterone content induced by ACTH is devoid of anesthetic or sedative effects and does not appear to change central GABAergic tone. In fact, ACTH, unlike allopregnanolone and allodeoxicorticosterone, failed to delay the onset of isoniazid-induced seizures, to reduce the fear of novelty in the elevated plus maze test as inferred by the increase in the number of entries or the time spent in the open arm. Thus, the data suggest that blood-borne steroids cannot function as precursors of brain neurosteroid modulators acting on GABAA receptor.", 
    "8": "Postprandial pancreatic secretion results from the interaction of neural and hormonal factors such as cholecystokinin (CCK), gastrin and gastrin releasing peptide (GRP), but their contribution to the net secretion is not established. Recent description of highly specific and potent hormonal receptor antagonists allows the determination of the physiological role of CCK, gastrin and GRP. In six dogs with chronic pancreatic fistulas, the blockade of CCK receptors by L-364, 718, gastrin receptors by L-365, 260 or GRP/bombesin receptors by nonapeptide RC-3095 failed to affect basal or sham-feeding induced pancreatic secretion indicating that none of these hormonal peptides plays a major role in this secretion. In contrast, the pancreatic response to ordinary feeding (which includes cephalic, gastric and intestinal phases), that was accompanied by a significant increment in plasma CCK and gastrin levels, was strongly inhibited (by over 50%) by L-364, 718 and slightly (by 20-30%) by L-365, 260 but not by RC-3095. Each antagonist was given at a dose that eliminated the secretory response to CCK, gastrin or GRP, respectively. We conclude that specific receptor antagonists are useful tools in assessing the physiological role of gut hormones in the control of pancreatic secretion and that none of the peptides tested appears to be involved in the cephalic phase. However, CCK plays a major role in the postprandial stimulation of pancreatic secretion.", 
    "9": "The effects of post-training administration of chlordiazepoxide and (-)-baclofen on memory retention was studied in ICRC Swiss mice by measuring the retest stepdown latency 24 hr after foot-shock in a passive avoidance task. Chlordiazepoxide 20 mg/kg impaired memory retention and a similar effect was produced by 10 mg/kg of diazepam. The effect of chlordiazepoxide was antagonised when combined with picrotoxin but not by the addition of a specific GABAB antagonist CGP 35348. The effect of chlordiazepoxide on memory retention seems to be mediated by action at the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. (-) Baclofen, the active isomer of the GABAB agonist enhanced memory in ICRC mice and this effect was antagonised by CGP 35348 at a dose of 10 mg/kg. The inactive isomer of baclofen, (+)-baclofen did not produce any effect. This indicates that GABAB receptors contribute to the effects of (-)-baclofen on memory.", 
    "10": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (pBZr) in human lymphocytes have been detected only in mixtures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The present investigation was designed to describe precisely the location of pBZr in the various sets and subsets of PBMC, purified using monoclonal antibodies to specific PBMC surface markers. Site densities and affinities of pBZr were measured in the intact cells by conventional binding, using 3H-PK 11195 as a ligand. Moreover, we used a specific radioimmunoassay to identify in these cells the presence of the polypeptide diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), a putative endogenous ligand for various benzodiazepine receptors including the peripheral type. Two major findings are derived from these studies: first, the coexistence of pBZr and DBI, or closely related immunoreactive material, in all major lymphocyte sets and subsets, as well as in monocytes. And second, the significant correlation (r = 0.87, p < 0.001) observed between the density of pBZr in a given cell type and its abundance of DBI like-immunoreactivity (DBI-LI). For both pBZr and DBI-LI content the cell distribution was monocytes > B cells and large granular lymphocytes > T cells (CD3+ set or CD4+ and CD8+ subsets) (ANOVA: pBZr: F = 114.11, p < 0.001; DBI-LI: F = 20.79, p < 0.001). The results are discussed in terms of the possibility that DBI and pBZr might share a relevant interaction in immunocompetent elements, thereby contributing to a new route of connection between the immune and the nervous systems.", 
    "11": "The postnatal development of the binding sites for an imidazobenzodiazepine, [3H]Ro 15-4513, which labels all presently known GABAA receptor-associated benzodiazepine binding sites, was studied in the cerebellar, cerebrocortical and hippocampal tissues of Wistar rats. The binding sites in the hippocampal membranes were fairly similar at all ages studied (1-2, 7, 14, and 90 days), suggesting early development of the GABAA receptors. The density of the binding sites increased significantly with age in the cerebellar and cerebrocortical membranes, without any changes in the affinity for this ligand. As judged by displacement by a benzodiazepine agonist, diazepam, [3H]Ro 15-4513 seemed to bind to a homogeneous pool of receptors in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in all age groups, whereas in the cerebellum two pharmacologically distinct sites were observed. The benzodiazepine agonist-insensitive (\"diazepam-insensitive\") binding first appeared at the time when the cerebellar granule cells started to mature, on the seventh postnatal day. As determined by autoradiography, such binding occurred selectively in the granule cell layer and was absent from the cerebellum of one- to two-day-old rats. The latter finding was confirmed by photoaffinity labelling experiments, in which diazepam inhibited all photolabelling in membrane homogenates from newborn rats. Diazepam-sensitive cerebellar binding, which increased steadily during development, was also localized in the molecular layer and deep nuclei.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "Effects of chronic intraventricular administration of recombinant human nerve growth factor on hippocampal muscarinic receptor densities and muscarinic receptor-linked second messenger systems were determined in adult rats 21 days following partial or full unilateral fimbrial transections. First, autoradiographic analysis of muscarinic receptors was carried out using [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate for total muscarinic receptors, [3H]pirenzepine for M1 receptors and [3H]AF-DX 384 for M2 receptors. Partial fimbrial transections did not significantly alter the density of these muscarinic receptor populations in the dorsal or ventral hippocampus and there was no effect of chronic (1 micrograms every other day, 21 days) recombinant human nerve growth factor treatment. In contrast, in animals receiving full fimbrial transections which by themselves did not alter muscarinic receptor density, recombinant human nerve growth factor treatment increased the density of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding sites, M1 receptors, and M2 receptors by approximately 40% in the CA1 region. Secondly, we determined the effect of chronic recombinant human nerve growth factor treatment on muscarinic receptor-mediated second messenger production in rats with either partial or full unilateral fimbrial transections. In partially fimbriectomized rats, oxotremorine-induced inositol triphosphate production by hippocampal slices was increased by 81% on the lesioned side of animals treated with a control protein. This lesion-induced supersensitivity of M1 muscarinic receptor function was prevented by chronic recombinant human nerve growth factor treatment. In recombinant human nerve growth factor-treated animals, inositol triphosphate production was similar to values on unlesioned control sides. The muscarinic receptor-mediated increase in cyclic GMP levels was not altered by fimbrial transections or recombinant human nerve growth factor treatment. In animals with full unilateral fimbrial transections, oxotremorine-induced inositol triphosphate production was increased by 99% on the lesioned side of animals treated with a control protein and treatment with recombinant human nerve growth factor did not alter this denervation-induced supersensitivity of muscarinic receptor transduction signal. Chronic recombinant human nerve growth factor treatment did not affect the levels of inositol triphosphate on the contralateral unlesioned side of either partial or full fimbriectomized animals. Earlier studies indicate that chronic nerve growth factor treatment increases the presynaptic function of hippocampal cholinergic neurons surviving partial fimbrial transections. The findings of the present study indicate that these presynaptic effects translate into functional changes at the level of postsynaptic muscarinic receptors in the hippocampus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "13": "Hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids caused by muscarinic agonists was studied in the guinea-pig parotid gland (PG) and cerebral cortex (CX). The present study describes the effect of two muscarinic agonists, carbachol and oxotremorine, on stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis and on binding of [3H]NMS in the presence of the irreversible muscarinic antagonist benzilyl choline mustard (BCM). Carbachol and oxotremorine stimulated the formation of inositol phosphates in PG, pD2(Carb) = 5.3 +/- 0.1, pD2(Oxo) = 5.9 +/- 0.1 and in CX, pD2(Carb) = 4.3 +/- 0.2, pD2(Oxo) = 5.8 +/- 0.2. In the present study slices from both tissues have been exposed to 0.1 microM BCM for 2, 5 and 10 min. Treatment for 10 min caused a 75-85% reduction in specific [3H]N-methyl scopolamine ([3H]NMS) binding sites in both PG and CX. Following 2 min BCM treatment of PG a marked decrease in pD2 value of the carbachol-stimulated inositol phosphate formation was found. This effect was not found in CX. The results showed that a 30-40% reduction in binding sites shifted the carbachol concentration response curve to the right by one order of magnitude and reduced the oxotremorine-induced release of inositol phosphates by approximately 20%. In PG, the BCM-induced reduction of the carbachol-stimulated inositol phosphate formation was paralleled by the reduction in receptor binding sites. Similar treatment, but in CX, showed a lower reduction of the carbachol-stimulated inositol phosphate formation as compared to the reduction in receptor-binding sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "1. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made from L-cells transfected with 2 combinations of subunits of the GABAA receptor. Log concentration-response curves were constructed to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on alpha 1,beta 1,gamma 2L containing cells and compared to those from alpha 1,beta 1 containing cells. The effects of flunitrazepam, pentobarbitone and alphaxalone on the concentration-response relationships were also examined. 2. From the log concentration-response curves, GABA had a mean (+/- s.e. mean) pEC50 = 5.2 +/- 0.09 and slope factor = 1.7 +/- 0.02 on alpha 1,beta 1,gamma 2L cells which were significantly different from the values obtained from alpha 1,beta 1 cells where the pEC50 = 5.6 +/- 0.02 and the slope = 1.5 +/- 0.02. 3. Flunitrazepam produced a parallel leftward shift of GABA concentration-response curves on alpha 1,beta 1,gamma 2L cells. The EC50 for flunitrazepam = 6.3 +/- 2.7 nM. No increase in the maxima of the GABA concentration-response curves was found in the presence of flunitrazepam. Flunitrazepam did not potentiate responses from alpha 1,beta 1 cells. 4. The log concentration-response curves from both populations of cells were shifted to the left by equal amounts by pentobarbitone. A significant increase in the maximal response to GABA was also produced by pentobarbitone. This occurred at lower concentrations of pentobarbitone on alpha 1,beta 1 cells. 5. Alphaxalone produced leftward shifts of GABA log concentration-response curves of similar magnitudes in both populations of cells. Significant increases in the maxima were found at 100 nM in alpha 1, beta 1 cells but not up to 1 microM in alpha 1,beta 1,gamma 2L cells.6. These results provide further evidence of the modulatory role of the gamma 2L subunit of the GABAA receptor containing alpha 1 and beta 2 subunits. As well as influencing the apparent affinity of GABA and conferring benzodiazepine modulation, it also appeared to regulate the increase in maximal response produced in the presence of barbiturates and steroids. This latter effect may imply that barbiturates and steroids increase the channel open-state probability in the presence of GABA and that this effect is diminished by the presence of the gamma 2L subunit.", 
    "15": "1. The effect of spinal GABAergic neurons on the segmental neuronal network generating locomotion has been analyzed in the lamprey spinal cord in vitro. It is shown that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A- and GABAB-mediated effects influence the burst frequency and the intersegmental coordination and that the GABA system is active during normal locomotor activity. 2. Fictive locomotor activity was induced by superfusing the spinal cord with a Ringer solution containing N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA, 150 microM). The efferent locomotor activity was recorded by suction electrodes from the ventral roots or intracellularly from interneurons or motoneurons. If a GABA uptake blocker was added to the perfusate, the burst rate decreased. This effect was counteracted by GABAB receptor blockade by phaclofen or 2-(OH)-saclofen. If instead a GABAB receptor agonist (baclofen) was added during fictive locomotion, a depression of the burst rate occurred. It was concluded that a GABAB receptor activation due to an endogenous release of GABA caused a depression of the burst activity with a maintained well-coordinated locomotor activity. 3. If a GABAA receptor antagonist (bicuculline) is applied during fictive locomotion elicited by NMDA, a certain increase of the burst rate occurred. Conversely, if a selective GABAA agonist (muscimol) was administered, the burst rate decreased. Similarly, if the GABAA receptor activity was potentiated by activation of a benzodiazepine site by diazepam, the burst rate was reduced. If, however the GABAergic effect was first enhanced by an uptake blocker (nipecotic acid), an administration of a GABAA antagonist (bicuculline) increased the burst rate, but in addition, the burst pattern became less regular with recurrent shorter periods without clear reciprocal burst activity. The GABAA receptor activity appears important for the rate control and for permitting a regular burst pattern. 4. The intersegmental coordination in the lamprey is characterized by a rostrocaudal constant phase lag of approximately 1% of the cycle duration between the activation of consecutive segments during forward swimming. This rostrocaudal phase lag can be reversed during backward swimming, which can be induced also experimentally in the isolated spinal cord by providing a higher excitability to the caudal segments. In a split-bath configuration, a GABA uptake blocker or a GABAB agonist was administered to the rostral part of the spinal cord, which caused a reversal of the phase lag as during backward swimming. If GABAA receptors were blocked under similar conditions, the intersegmental coordination became irregular. It is concluded that an increased GABA activity in a spinal cord region can modify the intersegmental coordination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "16": "Alcoholics' reactions to drinking-related stimuli (cue reactivity) have been well documented and alcohol cue exposure treatment has been conducted recently in several clinical trials. Prior to conducting large-scale clinical trials it is important to know what effects detoxification may have on cue reactivity. However, no information is available about the effects of stage of detoxification or of detoxification medication on alcohol cue reactivity. In this study, 45 male alcoholics, detoxified without medication, were assessed during either their second, fourth or sixth day of withdrawal. Further, their reactivity was compared to that of alcoholics detoxified with chlordiazepoxide (n = 15), and to that of alcoholics in their fourth week after drinking (n = 28). Cue reactivity assessment investigated salivation and urge to drink after 3 minutes of water cue exposure and then after 3 minutes of alcohol cue exposure. Urges to drink were assessed during an additional 15 minutes of alcohol exposure to explore latency to maximum reactivity and habituation. Reactivity did not differ as a function of group membership, although salivation was elevated to both beverages during the first week of detoxification. Of the sample, 70% reacted to alcohol with increased urge and 65% with increased salivation, with no difference between groups in proportions of reactors. The maximum urge to drink occurred in the first 6 minutes of alcohol exposure, followed by a gradual and significant decrease. There were no differences on these measures between alcoholics in their first or fourth week after their last drink. Implications for theory and clinical applications are discussed.", 
    "17": "A 67-year-old woman with a history of psychotropic drug abuse developed confusion. EEG was consistent with absence status epilepticus (AS). Intravenous (i.v.) flumazenil 1 mg, a benzodiazepine antagonist with anticonvulsant properties, increased both confusion and paroxysmal activity. Complete resolution was obtained after diazepam was administered i.v., and the patient then admitted that she had abruptly discontinued long-standing treatment with carpipramine, amitriptyline, bromazepam, and flunitrazepam. The aggravating effect of flumazenil indicates that benzodiazepine withdrawal was probably the elective triggering factor of this de novo absence status epilepticus.", 
    "18": "Recent studies have demonstrated the presence and the regulatory function of several neurotransmitters in the immune system. In the present study, we examined the presence of acetylcholine receptors, using pharmacological and molecular biological assays, and their transmembrane control and functions, using a biochemical assay, in a cloned human leukemic helper T lymphoma cell line, Jurkat. Several muscarinic agonists, such as acetylcholine, carbachol, muscarine, and oxotremorine-M (Oxo-M), at 100 microM caused a transient elevation of the free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), in contrast to the tonic elevation of [Ca2+]i induced by 10 micrograms/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA). It appeared that the elevation induced by Oxo-M, the most potent [Ca2+]i elevator, was more effectively inhibited by p-fluorohexahydrosiladifenidol hydrochloride (p-F-HHSiD) and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodine than by pirenzepine and 11-2[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro- 6H-pyrido[2,3-b] [1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116), suggesting that a pharmacological M3 subtype of muscarinic receptors is involved in the elevation of [Ca2+]i. Northern blot analysis showed that the m3 type of receptors are expressed in Jurkat cells. Scatchard analysis of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to intact cells indicated a Kd of 14.1 nM and a Bmax of 45,370 binding sites/cell. [3H]Quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to cell membranes was also inhibited by p-F-HHSiD rather than by pirenzepine and AF-DX 116. Oxo-M induced formation of inositol trisphosphate, and 5'-O-(2-thio)diphosphate inhibited the formation. Cholera toxin treatment inhibited the PHA-induced [Ca2+]i rise but did not affect the Oxo-M-induced rise. Neither pertussis nor butulinus (type C) toxin affected the rise induced by Oxo-M or PHA. Thus, bacterial toxin-insensitive GTP-binding proteins seem to be involved in the Oxo-M-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. Treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate abolished the Oxo-M-induced [Ca2+]i rise but did not affect that induced by PHA. m3 Muscarinic receptors thus appear to cause Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores via bacteria toxin-insensitive GTP-binding proteins, phospholipase C activation, and inositol trisphosphate formation in Jurkat cells. Protein kinase C seems to negatively modulate the m3 receptor system.",

    "20": "A gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor (GABAAR) gamma 2 subunit (short form) was cloned from an adult human cerebral cortex cDNA library in bacteriophage lambda gt11. The 261-bp intracellular loop (IL) located between M3 and M4 was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction and inserted into the expression vectors lambda gt11 and pGEX-3X. Both beta-galactosidase (LacZ) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing the gamma 2IL were purified, and a rabbit antibody to the LacZ-gamma 2IL was made. The antibody reacted with the gamma 2IL of both LacZ and GST fusion proteins and immunoprecipitated the GABAAR/benzodiazepine receptor (GABAAR/BZDR) from bovine and rat brain. The antibody reacted in affinity-purified GABAAR/BZDR immunoblots with a wide peptide band of 44,000-49,000 M(r). Immunoprecipitation studies with the anti-gamma 2IL antibody suggest that in the cerebral cortex, 87% of the GABAARs with high affinity for benzodiazepines and 70% of the GABAARs with high affinity for muscimol contain at least a gamma subunit, probably a gamma 2. These results indicate that there are [3H]muscimol binding GABAARs that do not bind [3H]flunitrazepam with high affinity. Immunoprecipitations with this and other anti-GABAAR/BZDR antibodies indicate that the most abundant combination of GABAAR subunits in the cerebral cortex involves alpha 1, gamma 2 (or other gamma), and beta 2 and/or beta 3 subunits. These subunits coexist in > 60% of the GABAAR/BZDRs in the cerebral cortex. The results also show that a considerable proportion (20-25%) of the cerebellar GABAAR/BZDRs is clonazepam insensitive. At least 74% of these cerebellar receptors, which likely contain alpha 6, also contain gamma 2 (or other gamma) subunit(s). The alpha 1 and beta 2 or beta 3 subunits are also frequently associated with gamma 2 (or other gamma) and alpha 6 in these cerebellar receptors.",

    "22": "The effect of 30 micrograms/kg of lorazepam on regional brain glucose metabolism was studied in 12 normal subjects and 10 alcoholic subjects with the use of positron emission tomography and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose.", 
    "23": "Lorazepam decreased whole brain glucose metabolism in both the normal subjects (13% change) and the alcoholic subjects (10% change), and the response was correlated with the concentration of lorazepam in plasma. Whereas the normal and alcoholic subjects showed similar responses to lorazepam in occipital and cerebellar metabolism, the alcoholic subjects showed significantly less of a response than the comparison subjects in the thalamus, basal ganglia, and orbitofrontal cortex. The rate of response in the orbitofrontal cortex was significantly correlated with cerebellar metabolism at baseline.", 
    "24": "The alcoholic subjects had a blunted response to lorazepam that was specific to certain brain regions. The association between cerebellar metabolism and response to lorazepam suggests that the cerebellum may contribute to the decreased sensitivity to lorazepam which was seen in the alcoholic subjects.", 
    "25": "In order to elucidate the drug interaction between diltiazem and diazepam, the effect of diltiazem on the N-demethylation of diazepam in the mouse hepatic microsomes was investigated. Kinetic study showed that diltiazem noncompetitively inhibited the N-demethylation of diazepam with inhibition constant (Ki) value of 247.8 microM, indicating that diltiazem exhibits an inhibitory effect on the hepatic oxidative metabolism of diazepam. It was therefore suggested that diltiazem may impair the metabolism of diazepam in vivo.", 
    "26": "A survey was undertaken in Sydney in 1989 to identify factors associated with behaviour involving risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection. Self-report data on needle-sharing and sexual practices were collected from 91 heroin users entering a residential, drug-free detoxification unit. Data were analysed using polytomous and ordinal logistic regressions. Heroin-dependent subjects who also had a current alcohol problem were significantly more likely than others to report high risk needle-sharing behaviour. Subjects with more than one sexual partner in the last three months were significantly more likely to use condoms while those with a current benzodiazepine problem were significantly less likely to use condoms. Qualitative data suggest that high risk needle-sharing behaviour most often occurred around the time of relapse to injecting drug use and among homeless drug users occupying derelict buildings in inner-city suburbs.", 
    "27": "Ro 5-3335 is a new benzodiazepine highly active in vitro (IC50 = 0.1-1.0 microM [corrected]) against HIV-1 viruses of AIDS resistant or non-resistant to zidovudine (AZT). It is also active against HIV-2. Ro 5-3335 is original by its mechanism of action, acting on the trans-activation factor of transcription (TAT) and non on the reverse transcriptase. Such as, it could prevent proviral DNA to express in both evolutive and silent AIDS resistant or non-resistant to AZT or to other anti-reverse transcriptase series. In addition, in antagonizing extracellular TAT's actions, Ro 5-3335 could alleviate the syndrome commonly associated with AIDS as Kaposi's syndrome. In rodent test, Ro 5-3335 has no diazepam-like central effects and presents in comparison to AZT a more favorable therapeutic index. In dog, the elimination half-life, peak concentration and availability are 2 h, 0.8 microM and 85% respectively, after a 1 mg.kg-1 oral dose of Ro 5-3335. Theoretically, Ro 5-3335 and now its analogue Ro 24-7429 seem to possess all virtues to antagonize evolutive and latent AIDS. Its arrival is timely to cope with the ever increasing resistance phenomena, lengthy development of AIDS vaccines, exponential contamination of populations worldwide and last but not least possibly to impede evolutions of the disease. Ability to manipulate TAT-mediated activation of HIV-1 genes paves the ways to study conceivable corrections of abnormal gene expressions of neurotransmitters, hormones, oncogenes and key enzymes.", 
    "28": "Previous studies have demonstrated that benzodiazepines (BDZ) (e.g. diazepam) inhibit immune responsiveness. Since these drugs are largely used in psychiatric patients it is of great importance to verify the existence of different types of BDZ, which are not suppressive for the immune system. In this framework, our results indicate that alprazolam and triazolam, two triazolo-BDZ, do not modify in vitro phagocytosis and killing exerted by normal human polimorphonuclear cells and monocytes. On the contrary, they significantly enhance T lymphocyte-dependent antibacterial activity in normal donors. These data support the concept that triazolo-BDZ and, in particular, alprazolam may represent more appropriate drugs for the treatment of psychiatric patients (e.g. patients with phobic disorders and/or migraine) who display immunodeficits.", 
    "29": "A 10-min bilateral carotid occlusion (BCO) in a control group of Mongolian gerbils, induced a transient generalized epileptic activity both in the hippocampal and in the cortical regions, associated with motor manifestations. After recirculation, spiking activity persisted, reaching its maximum peak within 18-36 h and then slowly decreasing till its total disappearance on the 6th-7th day. On the 7th day, histological studies manifested a selective loss of CA1 hippocampal neurons. The treated gerbils (divided in 2 groups according to the dosage used) were administered clonazepam (CZP), a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, immediately after clamping and again every 24 h for the following three days at dosages of 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg i.p., respectively. The drug inhibited epileptic activity in a dose-dependent manner, while it prevented CA1 neuronal loss at both doses. These results point to a possible derangement of the GABAergic system which probably in turn triggers an exaggerated excitation.", 
    "30": "Forty-three uncooperative children ranging in age from 4-12 yr were pretreated with diazepam, acepromazine or a placebo, depending on their anxiety situations. The results showed that diazepam has a significantly more powerful effect on the successful termination of the dental procedure and on encouraging the cooperation and compliance of patients than acepromazine or placebo. The placebo was also found to be effective for increasing the cooperation of patients with negative anxiety. No significant difference was established between the actions of premedicants on pain reaction and amnesia. In the light of the present findings, it is suggested that drugs with sedative and also anxiolytic effects will be more beneficial for increasing the cooperation of children with mild or high anxiety than drugs with a sedative effect alone.", 
    "31": "Large doses of pirenzepine given at bedtime suppress nocturnal GH secretion and abolish dawn phenomenon. As GH suppression may be beneficial in diabetic subjects we have investigated the effect of routine doses of pirenzepine on GH secretion in 9 type 1 diabetics. In the acute study pirenzepine 20 mg i.v. administered 15 min before GHRH 80 micrograms i.v. completely inhibited GHRH-induced GH response and the peak GH values were reduced from 66.3 to 9.2 ng/ml, P < 0.005. In the chronic study pirenzepine was given in a daily dose of 75 or 150 mg for 4 days and GH was measured hourly during 24-h study before and on the fourth day of pirenzepine administration. GH secretion calculated as area under curve (AUC) was not affected by pirenzepine and the values of AUC were: 139 ng/ml per h (the control 24-h study) and 123 ng/ml per h (pirenzepine 75 mg) and 303 ng/ml per h (pirenzepine 150 mg). Mean plasma glucose was not changed by pirenzepine. GH secretion calculated as AUC and mean 24-h GH level did not correlate with metabolic control of diabetes assessed by HbA1. It is concluded that routine doses of pirenzepine do not suppress GH hypersecretion in type 1 diabetic subjects and therefore this agent does not seem suitable for the purpose of 24-h GH suppression in type 1 diabetes mellitus.", 
    "32": "Speaking of \"drugs of stress\" is difficult because stress is not a so precise concept. Moreover, the target is not simply the correction of physiological responses to a stimulus, but is the treatment of pathologies which are directly related with stress: post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) and performance anxiety. Drug treatment of PTSD is not well codified, even if phenelzine and amitriptyline are, at least relatively, effective medicines. Beta-blockers remain today the main drugs for performance anxiety. Studies about the utility of carbamazepine and clonidine in these disorders are few. Experimental works upon the action of tianeptine on hippocampus cells lead to interesting results. The place of benzodiazepines and neuroleptics is still controversial.", 
    "33": "Diazepam used in the treatment of eclampsia crosses the placental barrier readily, and may cause various clinical effects in the neonates. Twenty-five (25) live born babies of eclamptic mothers receiving diazepam were studied and cord blood diazepam concentration was estimated. Effect of low dose of diazepam is minimal apart from lowering of rectal temperature and the effects lasted for a period of 12 hours. But high dose (> 30 mg) of diazepam and prolonged duration of diazepam therapy in mothers causes significant depression of the newborn and the effects lasted for a period of 36-48 hours. As the clinical condition of the newborn is not related to the diazepam concentration in cord blood, the cord blood estimation is not helpful in the assessment of clinical effects of the drug in newborn. The tissue storage of the drug in newborn appears to be responsible for the clinical effects.", 
    "34": "We present the study of 20 pediatric patients with difficult controlled epilepsy in which we used clobazam as adjuvant anticonvulsant therapy between January 1986 and July 1990 at the outpatients neuropediatric facility of the Hospital General Base Cayetano Heredia and the private practice, with 6 to 45 months follow up. The mean age for the onset of the epilepsy was 22 months and the most frequent kind was the generalized epilepsy syndrome both secondary and idiopathic. It was obtained a significant decrease of seizures in 60% of the patients with a complete control in 35% of the total. It was found the best outcome in secondary generalized epilepsies Lennox-Gastaut and West types. It was found tolerance phenomenon in 25%, and psychotropic effect in three patients. We suggest the use of this 1,5 benzodiazepine drug in difficult controlled epilepsies in children of our region.", 
    "35": "The influence of alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide and midazolam on the antinociceptive effect of subcutaneous morphine was investigated in rats, using the tail-flick test. After intraperitoneal administration, all drugs significantly enhanced the morphine-induced analgesia. Both the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist RO 15-3505 and the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist FG 7142 antagonized the potentiating effect of alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide and midazolam. Our results suggest that the interaction between benzodiazepines and opioids in modulating nociceptive responses involves primarily benzodiazepine receptors and that different pathways are involved in the anxiolytic and pro-analgesic actions of benzodiazepines.", 
    "36": "Prenatal exposure to diazepam and other benzodiazepines (BDZ) has been found to result in a marked reduction of T-lymphocyte proliferation during postnatal development of rats. In search for pathogenic changes underlying this effect, we investigated the mitogen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and concanavalin A (ConA) stimulated release of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha by mixed splenocytes of male offspring from Long Evans rats treated with 1.25 mg/kg per day diazepam from gestational day 14 to 20. In response to LPS, TNF-alpha release was found to be significantly lower in mixed splenocytes of two- and four-week-old treated than in control offspring. However, at eight weeks of age, prenatally diazepam-treated animals showed a significantly higher LPS-induced TNF-alpha release than control rats. Since monocytes/macrophages represent a major source of TNF-alpha, additional experiments were performed on purified spleen macrophages and lymphocytes stimulated with LPS. TNF-alpha release was only detectable in supernatants of adherent spleen macrophages and not in supernatants of lymphocytes. Thus, our data indicate that a disturbance in TNF-alpha release from macrophages is involved in the deficient immune response of prenatally diazepam-exposed rats.", 
    "37": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) was diagnosed in female patients (N = 41) between the ages of 18 and 30 using the Diagnostic Interview for Borderline Patients (DIB) and DSM-III. Comparing the EEG findings of BPD (N = 18) and non-BPD (N = 21) groups, there were no EEG findings characteristic of BPD. We also assessed the relationship between the EEG findings and DIB items. Positive spikes appeared in patients with high scores for Impulse Action Patterns, while wave and spike phantoms were observed in patients with high scores for Interpersonal Relations. Dividing the patients into BPD and non-BPD groups, a similar tendency to that observed from an analysis of all patients was observed in the non-BPD group, but no such tendency was observed in the BPD group. The results suggest that BPD patients include those in whom vulnerability of cerebral function plays an important role in the development of these two clinical symptoms as well as those in whom vulnerability of cerebral function plays almost no pathogenic role.",

    "41": "The authors give a selection from the clinical-pharmacological and clinical studies of Grandaxin (tofizopam), an original Hungarian compound registered in 1976. Tofizopam, a 2,3-benzodiazepine derivative, differs from \"classical\" 1,4-benzodiazepines not only in chemical structure, but also in pharmacological and clinical-pharmacological properties. It is an anxiolytic without sedative-hypnotic, muscle relaxant and anticonvulsive effects. Tofizopam does not impair psychomotor and intellectual performance, like other benzodiazepines do, in the contrary, it has a mild stimulatory activity. It is potent in alleviating vegetative symptoms accompanying anxiety disorders. Tofizopam has a very low toxicity, mild side effects. The administration of tofizopam does not lead to physical or psychic dependence.", 
    "42": "Present publication summarizes the pharmacokinetics and metabolism investigations of anxiolytic tofizopam (Grandaxin) carried out in Hungary and in other countries. The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of tofizopam were studied in animals (mice, rat, rabbit, dog, monkey) and humans. The pharmacokinetics profile of the compound can be described by a two-compartment open model, where the absorption and distribution phase were found to be rapid (tmax 0.5-1.0 hour in rats and 1.0-1.5 hours in humans). The unchanged tofizopam and 14C-total radioactivity were eliminated from human plasma with a biological half-life (t beta 1/2) of 2.7-3.5 hours and 15-21 hours, respectively, which show a slower elimination of the metabolites. The main route of elimination was the excretion of the mainly conjugated metabolites after the intensive first-pass metabolism in urine and/or faeces, depends on the species. The major route of biotransformation was mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-o-demethylation in the various degree and positions of aromatic ring(s).", 
    "43": "A great number of the anxiolytics used in the clinical practice are structurally 1,4-benzodiazepines. Tofisopam is the first derivative which differs from the so-called classical benzodiazepines in the position of the nitrogen atoms i.e. in the case of tofisopam they are vicinals (2.3-). This difference in its structure is suspected to be responsible for the different pharmacological and clinical profile of tofisopam. In addition to the anxiolytic activity, sedative, muscle relaxant and anticonvulsive effects are the main characteristics of the most frequently used representative of 1,4-benzodiazepines, diazepam. In contrast, to the above mentioned, tofisopam produces sedation only in higher doses, and does not possess anticonvulsive and appreciable muscle relaxant effects. Tofisopam does not induce sleep even in subtoxic doses, and only high doses enhance the effect of barbiturates and ethanol. Applying doses above 200 mg/kg, tofisopam exhibits effects similar to that of neuroleptics (e.g. catalepsy, ptosis, decrease of pentetrazol threshold, potentiation of amphetamine and apomorphine stereotypy). After repeated administration tolerance to the drug was not observed. Tofisopam does not bind in the CNS neither to the 1,4-benzodiazepine, nor to the GABA receptors, but it enhances the binding of benzodiazepines and muscimol to their binding sites. Tofisopam has also mixed dopamine agonist and antagonist like properties.", 
    "44": "Zolpidem is a new imidazopyridine hypnotic with a pharmacological profile substantially different from benzodiazepines. In this observational multicenter study the possibility of shifting to zolpidem (10 mg at N1, 15 or 20 after N1) insomniac patients previously taking (for at least 15 days and not longer than 3 months) standard posology of triazolam (0.125-0.25 mg), lorazepam (1 mg) or lormetazepam (1 mg) was assessed. For ethical reasons the patients were mandatorily to be insomniacs despite their taking hypnotics or not tolerating them. Patients enrolled were 299 of whom 276 evaluable (139 males and 136 females; mean age 48.67 +/- 14.64, range 18-83). Study duration was 7 nights with visits at N0 (baseline), N1 (after 1st night), N3 (after 3rd night) and N7 (final evaluation); on each visit the Saint Mary Hospital Sleep Questionnaire and the benzodiazepine withdrawal symptom's rating scale were administered; moreover, after N7, investigators were asked a judgement of feasibility of such a shift. In 229 (83.5%) out of 274 patients such a shift to zolpidem was considered successfully (no occurrence of symptoms and/or signs of previously taken hypnotic withdrawal); in the remaining 45 patients, just 17 (6.2%) seemed to be real unsuccessful cases (reactions mild and transient, anyhow). In conclusion abrupt shift to zolpidem appeared to be largely feasible in the patients studied.", 
    "45": "Among poly drug users attending a treatment service, 33 subjects were identified who had experienced withdrawal symptoms from high dose benzodiazepines (median diazepam equivalent 140 mg/day) at a time uncomplicated by simultaneous cessation of other drugs. Symptoms were rated using the Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptom Questionnaire (Tyrer et al. (1990) The Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptom Questionnaire. J. Affective Disorders, 19, 53-61). The symptoms experienced were similar to those described in studies of withdrawal from low dose benzodiazepines, but more severe. Greater severity of symptoms was significantly associated with high dosage, the use of multiple benzodiazepines and oral rather than injected use. The implications for clinical management are discussed.", 
    "46": "The extent of uptake of Azone into excised human stratum corneum from thin polymer films has been measured using a sandwich model. With poly(dimethyl)siloxane, an Azone loading of the stratum corneum of 6-7% w/w was achieved. With Eudragit NE30D, a loading of less than 1% was reached. The extent of uptake into the stratum corneum and acceptor layers of the sandwich model depended on the Azone content of the films. The resulting enhanced uptake and flux of diazepam through the stratum corneum membrane into a polymeric acceptor layer corresponded closely to the amounts of Azone taken up and their known enhancing effects. The uptake of diazepam from the poly(dimethyl)siloxane films was ten times larger than that from Eudragit NE30D films. The extent of uptake is, therefore, controlled by the rate of release from the polymer and partitioning at the interface.", 
    "47": "The relationship between benzodiazepine-withdrawal induced weight loss and conditioned taste aversion was studied. Rats were treated with chlordiazepoxide (CDP) for 10 days (n = 37) or with vehicle (n = 39). Significant withdrawal-induced weight loss was observed. On day 11 all animals received an intra-oral infusion of saccharin. In a subsequent saccharin vs water choice test significant withdrawal-induced conditioned taste aversion was observed, as CDP pretreated animals drank less saccharin than controls. The two withdrawal indices were not correlated in the CDP pretreated animals [r = + 0.05], despite the fact that we studied a large group of rats. These data are in agreement with suggestions that drug withdrawal syndromes may be heterogeneous phenomena with a number of different underlying neural mechanisms.",

Gaucher disease is a familial disorder of lipid catabolism with autosomal recessive inheritance. Due to the defective function of the enzyme glucosylceramide beta-glucosidase, glycosphingolipids accumulate, leading to end-organ dysfunction. Three clinical variants of the disease, which differ in age of onset, degree of central nervous system (CNS) involvement, and frequency in the population, have been described. Of concern to the anesthesiologist is the occurrence of significant CNS dysfunction in types II and III, with seizures, gastroesophageal reflux, and chronic aspiration. Bulbar involvement and infiltration of the upper airway with glycolipids may lead to upper airway obstruction. Additionally, hepatosplenomegaly, present in all three variants, may lead to hypersplenism with thrombocytopenia and anemia. Preoperative identification of the associated end-organ dysfunction will allow the safe provision of anesthetic care for these children.",

On both days, the testing runs were at baseline and 1.5, 3, 4.5 and 6 h after intake. 2. The performance was evaluated both objectively (digit symbol substitution, flicker fusion, Maddox wing, simulated driving, body balance) and subjectively (visual analogue scales, questionnaires).

    "57": "The ability of high doses of flumazenil to antagonize ethanol-induced sedation was assessed via ethanol-induced loss of the righting reflex (LRR) in rats. Ethanol (3.5-5 g kg-1 i.p) produces a dose-dependent increase in the proportion of animals presenting a LRR response. Flumazenil (0.1 to 1 mg kg-1 i.p) was ineffective in preventing the suppression of the righting reflex and even aggravated it for ethanol dosages of 3.5 and 4.0 g kg-1. These data support the view that flumazenil has no effective 'anti-ethanol' properties. Conversely, the prolongation of mean sleep time provoked by the antidote could be related to the suppression of a putative endogenous inverse-agonist activity at the benzodiazepine receptor, which could be implicated in the mechanism of the acute tolerance to ethanol.",

    "60": "The respiratory and behavioral effects of the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) inverse agonist ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) were determined alone and in combination with buspirone, lorazepam, flumazenil, and SR 95195 in rhesus monkeys. For the respiratory studies, one group of monkeys inhaled either air or 5% CO2 mixed in air according to a fixed alternating schedule; respiratory frequency and minute volume were monitored. For the behavioral studies, another group of monkeys responded under a fixed-ratio (FR 30) schedule of food presentation. The respiratory stimulant effects of beta-CCE in both air and 5% CO2 were enhanced by prior treatment with the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) partial agonist buspirone (0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg) and a weak BZR inverse agonist, SR 95195 (10.0 mg/kg). Coadministration of buspirone (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) also potentiated the rate-decreasing effects of beta-CCE under the FR schedule. The BZR agonist lorazepam (3.0 mg/kg) and BZR antagonist flumazenil (1.0 mg/kg) attenuated the effects of beta-CCE on respiratory frequency and minute volume particularly under the 5% CO2 condition, and lorazepam (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) and flumazenil (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) attenuated the effects of beta-CCE on FR responding. These latter results show that the respiratory and behavioral effects of beta-CCE in rhesus monkeys are at least in part due to effects at BZRs. Moreover, the findings suggest either that coactivation of benzodiazepine and 5-HT1A sites lead to a greater than additive effect or that beta-CCE and buspirone share a common mechanism of action that is unrelated to the receptor at which BZR inverse agonists act.", 
    "61": "Abecarnil (isopropyl-6-benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) is a metabolically stable anxiolytic and anticonvulsant beta-carboline derivative with few sedative and muscle relaxant effects in rodents. Abecamil binds with high affinity to benzodiazepine receptors. Because long-term treatment with benzodiazepines leads to development of dependence, we evaluated in mice whether abecarnil also possesses a potential for producing dependence, using electroencephalographic and electromyographic monitoring, and behavioral assessment of anxiety to detect withdrawal responses after chronic treatment. Diazepam was used as a reference. Mice withdrawn from chronic treatment with diazepam (15 mg/kg/day for 12 days) showed a time-related evolution of anxiety, muscle rigidity and seizures between days 4 and 21 after discontinuation of the treatment. A period between withdrawal days 1 and 3 was symptom free. Mice withdrawn from chronic administration of abecarnil (6 mg/kg/day for 12 days) showed no anxiety and no changes in seizure susceptibility and muscle tone. The doses of diazepam and abecarnil used for chronic treatment were equivalent in terms of kinetics and binding to benzodiazepine receptors. These data indicate that long-term treatment with abecarnil does not induce benzodiazepine-like dependence in mice. Thus, it may be predicted that chronic treatment with abecarnil in humans may offer an important alternative to benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety.",

No untoward effects (i.e., O2 saturation < 85%, nausea, vomiting, severe bradycardia) occurred. Sedation and analgesia were comparable in the upper gastrointestinal groups. The number of patients with amnesia for the examination was highest in the meperidine group. Recovery time generally was shorter with alfentanil and sufentanil. Recovery time of the lower gastrointestinal patients was significantly longer in the meperidine group than in the other groups; analgesia scores for sufentanil were significantly lower than for meperidine.

Since third ventricular enlargement may be a neuroradiological marker of negative schizophrenia, a subgroup of schizophrenia which is associated with poor premorbid adjustment and prognosis, I predict that it will be associated also with an insidious development of disease. To empirically test this hypothesis, I investigated in 22 institutionalized chronic schizophrenic patients (20 men, 2 women; mean age = 31.9 years, SD = 7.1), the association between the mode of onset of schizophrenia and third ventricular width (TVW) on CT scan. In the sample, 15 patients (68.2%) experienced an insidious onset of schizophrenia while 7 patients had a more sudden onset. The two cohorts did not differ significantly on any of the demographic, historic, cognitive, psychopathological, and treatment variables surveyed with the exception of duration of formal education which was significantly shorter in patients with an insidious onset of illness. However, patients with an insidious onset had a significantly greater TVW as compared to those with a sudden onset (M = 7.7 +/- 3.0 mm vs. 4.6 +/- 3.6 mm, p < .05, two-tailed). These findings demonstrate an association between the mode of onset of schizophrenia and TVW on CT scan and suggest that an insult to peri-third ventricular structures, which may underlie third ventricular enlargement, is associated with an insidious development of schizophrenia.",

Haloperidol in the dosage 0.5 mg/kg and benactyzine in the dosage 0.1 mg/kg, that reduced the fever response in rabbits and amitriptyline which induced no significant changes in the fever, led to enhancement of antipyretic effect of acupuncture. Haloperidol and benactyzine in the dose 1 mg/kg, that dropped the temperature by a single administration, and diazepam, which didn't influence upon the fever, reduced the intensity and duration of the antipyretic effect of acupuncture.",

It has been established that this medicines do not influence at ASPOL in LL in concentration range of 10-10 M. Phenobarbital (10 M) and Na-valproate (10 M) inhibit ASPOL and PhPOL in HRB in 20-25%.

    "68": "Complex pathogenetic therapy (CPT) of epilepsy in the form of combined action of drugs enhancing GABA-mediated inhibition was carried out. The anticonvulsant potency of drugs and of their combinations was determined by a maximal electroshock seizure test in mice. Combined anticonvulsant effects were evaluated by the isobolographic method, various doses of drugs were compared in proportion to their ED 50. It was shown that synergistic effects of potentiation type were in all cases of combined use of drugs. ED 50 of each drug could be decreased in combinations of sodium valproate with diazepam by 7 times, phenobarbital with sodium valproate--by 12 times, phenobarbital with diazepam--by 14 times and sodium valproate with phenobarbital and diazepam--by 26 times. Thus, these results suggest that complex use of drugs acting on different mechanisms of GABA-mediated inhibitory control lead to a marked potentiation of the end effect. The obtained data allow to conclude that CPT of epilepsy which can provide potentiation of effects of each drug and a significant reduction of their doses is reasonable to be used.",

    "70": "Anxiety disorders are among the most frequent of childhood psychiatric disorders. These disorders can persist from childhood and adolescence into adulthood, resulting in impaired functioning at home, school or work. Some anxiety disorders like generalized or separation anxiety are acute requiring urgent, short-term treatment. Others like fears or inhibitions are chronic resulting in longterm handicaps. Other psychiatric disorders may be concurrent with, or misdiagnosed as, anxiety disorder. Anxiety can be associated with mood or behavioral disorders. When anxiety is symptomatic of another disorder, the primary disorder should be treated first. The pharmacology of childhood anxiety has been hindered by the lack of reliable quantitative evaluations, and the changes in the manifestations of anxiety. Various types of drugs have been used to treat anxiety and related disorders. The use of different drugs is reviewed. The results of a controlled clinical trial with alprazolam and two trials with buspirone in the treatment of child and adolescent anxiety are presented. While these results are promising, further clinical trials are a priority.",

    "74": "Pial arterioles of mice were monitored by intravital television microscopy. Responses to acetylcholine (ACh) and to McN-A-343, a selective M1 activator, were monitored before and after endothelial injury by a laser-dye technique in the presence or absence of different reference antagonists to the M1, M2, and M3 muscarinic receptors. ACh and McN-A-343 produced endothelium-dependent dilation that was blocked by 4-diphenyl-N-methyl-piperidine methiodide, an inhibitor of the M3 receptor. Dilations were not augmented by blocking the M1 receptor with pirenzepine. Endothelial injury unmasked a constricting effect of both ACh and McN-A-343. The constricting effect was blocked by pirenzepine. The results support the literature suggesting an action of McN-A-343 at more than one site. They indicate that ACh causes endothelium-dependent relaxation via the M3 receptor and directly constricts vascular smooth muscle via the M1 receptor. There does not appear to be continuous competition between endothelium-dependent relaxation and endothelium-independent constriction. Rather the M1 receptors mediating constriction in vascular smooth muscle appear downregulated and/or uncoupled from the contractile machinery as long as the overlying endothelium synthesizes/releases the mediator (endothelium-derived relaxing factor) of ACh's dilating action.", 
    "75": "A simultaneous assay for droperidol and flunitrazepam by high-performance liquid chromatography has been developed and applied to blood samples collected during an acute normovolemic haemodilution under general anaesthesia. Haemodilution blood samples were stored at +4 degrees C to be transfused, if required, to a patient during the post-surgical phase. A C18 Supelclean cartridge was used for solid-phase extraction, and the recoveries were 74% and 89%, respectively, for droperidol and flunitrazepam. Compounds were chromatographed on a C18 Novapak column at 250 nm, with a mobile phase of acetonitrile-10 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6.7) (45:55, v/v). Nitrazepam was used as the internal standard. For both drugs, the assay was linear up to 500 micrograms/l, and the detection limits were 20 and 10 micrograms/l for droperidol and flunitrazepam, respectively, and their observed levels in haemodilution samples were 93 +/- 82 micrograms/l and 76 +/- 107 micrograms/l, respectively. Some of the values for flunitrazepam were higher than the minimal efficient concentration, defined as the plasma level observed at the time of the patient wakening from anaesthesia (12 +/- 4 micrograms/l). According to our results, haemodilution sampling can be performed before induction of anaesthesia. When the blood is collected after the anaesthetic induction, it seems necessary to determine levels of the two drugs in haemodilution samples to avoid side-effects.",

In the present study we have investigated their comparative autoradiographic distribution using [3H]flumazenil as a ligand. In the neonatal rat CNS, the imidazopyridine derivatives zolpidem and alpidem were found to discriminate two [3H]flumazenil binding site populations with an IC50 value ratio of more than 200-fold. In the different regions investigated (spinal cord, striatum, neocortex and inferior colliculus) the low affinity component had IC50 values of 20-40 microM (zolpidem) and 5-15 microM (alpidem) and accounted for ca. 50% of the total binding site population. In the adult rat, these imidazopyridine derivatives displayed a greater displacing potency in the cerebellum (IC50 = 6 and 36 nM, respectively) than in the hippocampus (IC50 = 37 and 403 nM, respectively). In the cerebellum, [3H]flumazenil binding was fully displaced by 1 microM of either compound and Hill coefficients of displacement curves were close to unity. In the hippocampus, 25% of [3H]flumazenil binding were resistant to 3 microM zolpidem or 1 microM alpidem, but were displaced by 100 microM of either compound. CL 218,872 also displayed a greater displacing potency in the cerebellum (IC50 = 83 nM) than in the hippocampus (IC50 = 711 nM) but [3H]flumazenil binding in the hippocampus was fully displaced by 10 microM of this compound. In adult rat hippocampus, zolpidem and alpidem were found to discriminate between three central omega site subtypes which display high (IC50 = 31 and 6.1 nM, for these imidazopyridine derivatives. In contrast, CL 218,872 discriminated between omega 1 and omega 2 sites but not between two omega 2 receptor subpopulations. omega 1 sites were mainly localized in layer IV of the sensorimotor cortex, cerebellum, substantia nigra, olfactory bulb and inferior colliculus. omega 2I sites were present in the cortical mantle (with higher levels in the cingulate and olfactory than in the sensorimotor cortex) and in subcortical (hippocampus, hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens) limbic structures. In the hippocampus, hypothalamus, spinal cord and nucleus accumbens, omega 2L sites accounted for more than 25% of the specific [3H]flumazenil binding; the density of these sites was minor in the cortex and in most pyramidal and extrapyramidal system structures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "78": "The effect of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) was examined in guinea-pig celiac ganglion (CG) neurons in primary culture using standard intracellular recording techniques. Sulfated CCK-8 (CCK-8S; 1 microM) evoked slow depolarizing responses in 94% of CG neurons tested. In contrast, membrane potential was not affected by nonsulfated CCK-8 (CCK-8NS; 1 microM), CCK tetrapeptide (CCK-4; 1 microM), or gastrin (1 microM). The selective CCKA receptor antagonist L 364,718 potently inhibited CCK-8S-induced slow depolarizations (IC50 2.9 pM). In contrast, the selective CCKB receptor antagonist L 365,260 was a weak inhibitor of CCK-8S-induced slow depolarizations (IC50 1.3 microM). The depolarizing responses to CCK-8S were associated with an average increase in cell input resistance of 61%. Single electrode voltage clamp experiments indicated that CCK-8S-induced depolarizations were associated with a slow inward shift in holding current. Thus, the present findings indicate that guinea-pig cultured CG neurons are endowed with excitatory CCKA receptors the activation of which elicits a decrease in membrane conductance, thereby resulting in slow depolarizations.", 
    "79": "In the electrically field-stimulated rabbit vas deferens, muscarinic receptor agonists increase twitch-height by actions at postjunctional M2 receptors and decrease twitch-height by actions at prejunctional M1 receptors. In the present studies, in contrast to previous reports, muscarinic receptor agonists primarily decreased twitch-height, produced minimal increases in twitch-height, and, produced identical responses in both epididymal and prostatic tissue segments, thus permitting a more detailed investigation of the M1 receptor component of action of muscarinic receptor agonists in the rabbit vas deferens. The nonselective muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol produced biphasic effects on twitch-height in the vas deferens: lower concentrations increased twitch-height to only approximately 25-30% over control, whereas higher concentrations inhibited the twitch. The selective M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine blocked the inhibitory effects of carbachol, and unmasked carbachol-induced increases in twitch-height. Atropine, 4-DAMP (4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide) and AF-DX 116 (11-2[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro- 6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepin-6-one) blocked both the inhibitory and stimulatory effects of carbachol, but atropine and 4-DAMP were more potent in blocking the inhibitory than the stimulatory effects of carbachol, whereas the reverse was true for AF-DX 116. McN-A-343 (4-hydroxy-2-butynyl)trimethylammonium chloride, m-chlorocarbanilate) and 12 other muscarinic receptor agonists from a variety of chemical classes also produced concentration-dependent decreases in twitch-height. The log IC50s of the muscarinic receptor agonists for decreasing twitch-height were highly correlated with their log Kis for inhibiting [3H]pirenzepine (r = 0.96) and [3H]oxotremorine-M (r = 0.85) binding in rat hippocampal membranes. The present results demonstrate that the muscarinic M1 receptor mediating inhibition of twitch-height in the rabbit vas deferens has pharmacologic properties similar to the muscarinic M1 receptor in rat hippocampus.", 
    "80": "The pancreatic receptor for cholecystokinin (CCK) typifies many G protein-coupled receptors in that its ability to bind agonist can be reduced by GTP or the solubilization of membranes. We found, however, that a dye, cibacron blue, caused up to a 6-fold increase in binding of the CCK receptor agonist, 125I-CCK-8, to rat pancreatic membranes solubilized with digitonin. Binding optimally enhanced in this manner was comparable to binding of 125I-CCK-8 to native membranes with respect to time-course, maximal amount bound, reversibility, and sensitivity to inhibition by various CCK receptor ligands. Increases in affinity of the CCK receptor for CCK-8 accounted fully for the enhancement of binding of 125I-CCK-8. Cibacron blue did not enhance binding of 125I-CCK-8 to native membranes, and also failed to enhance binding of the CCK receptor antagonist, [3H]L-364,718, to solubilized or native membranes. The ability of cibacron blue to enhance binding of agonist but not that of antagonist suggests that this dye may mimic or perhaps stimulate the effects of G protein on CCK receptors. Such a phenomenon may provide new insights into the mechanisms by which receptors distinguish agonists from antagonists.",

This compound is a potent ligand for CCKA binding sites (rat pancreatic membranes, Ki = 0.2 nM) and is highly selective (CCKB and gastrin/CCKA IC50 ratios of 800 and 5000 respectively). In vitro, it is a competitive antagonist of cholecystokinin (CCK)-stimulated amylase release in isolated rat pancreatic acini (pA2 = 7.50) and of CCK-induced guinea pig gall bladder contractions (pA2 = 9.57). In in vivo gastrointestinal models, SR 27897 confirmed the potency obtained in vitro: at 1 mg/kg (i.v.) it completely reversed the CCK-induced amylase secretion, at 3 micrograms/kg (p.o.) it antagonized by 50% the CCK-induced inhibition of gastric emptying of a charcoal meal in mice, and 72 micrograms/kg (p.o.) was the median effective dose for inhibiting CCK-induced gall bladder emptying in mice. SR 27897 was also very active (ED50 = 27 micrograms/kg p.o.) in the gall bladder emptying protocol with egg yolk as an inducer of endogenous CCK release. SR 27897 had a long-lasting action in all the experiments, with no differences between oral and intravenous routes of administration. SR 27897 was more or less effective than L-364,718, depending on the model and the species. Both compounds increased the gall bladder volume of fasting mice, but the effect of SR 27897 was 10 times lower than that of L-364,718. In summary, SR 27897 is a selective antagonist of CCKA receptors, is highly potent in animal models whatever the route of administration and has a long duration of action.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "82": "Intravenous anaesthetic agents depress the activity of the brain by acting on receptor-operated ion channels. Barbiturates enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition, depress glutamate-mediated excitation, and hyperpolarize the membrane by increased potassium conductance. Benzodiazepines facilitate GABA-mediated inhibition by binding to a benzodiazepine recognition site on the GABA receptor complex, and affect potassium channels. Opioids bind to opioid receptors and hyperpolarize the membrane by enhanced potassium and calcium conductances. Ketamine depresses excitatory synaptic transmission by acting on glutamate receptors of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype. Propofol acts at a recognition site on the GABA receptor, which differs from the binding sites of both barbiturates and benzodiazepines.", 
    "83": "A series of imidazobenzodiazepin-6-ones possessing varying substituents at the 3- and 5-positions were synthesized and evaluated for their affinities at diazepam-sensitive (DS) and diazepam-insensitive (DI) benzodiazepine receptors (BzR) in rat cortical and cerebellar membranes. Replacement of an ester substituent at the 3-position with a carbamate, acetylamino, formylamino, isothiocyanato, 2-oxazolinyl, 2-benzoxazolyl, or p-tolylsulfonyl groups lead to > 100-fold reductions in affinity at both DS and DI BzR. Replacement of a methyl group on the nitrogen at the 5-position with propyl, allyl, or phenethyl groups also led to significant reductions in affinity at both BzR isoforms. However, incorporation of a benzyl group yields ligands (11f,h,i and 14a-c) with moderate to high affinities at DS BzR, suggesting the presence of a hydrophobic pocket at the receptor site. Introduction of chlorine at the 7-position enhances ligand affinity at DS BzR while chlorine at the 8-position decreases affinity (IC50: 11f, 9.3 nM; 11h, 2.4 nM; 11i, 37.8 nM). In contrast, chlorine substitution at the 7- as well as the 8-position increases affinity at DI BzR (Ki: 11f, 112 nM; 11h, 20.2 nM; 11i, 10.9 nM). Compound 11 is among the few described high affinity DI-site ligands with a selectivity comparable to that of Ro 15-4513. Despite their in vitro affinities, compounds 11f, 11h, and 11i exhibit low in vivo activities that may be attributable to unfavorable metabolic or pharmacokinetic properties.", 
    "84": "It is generally accepted that peptide-YY (PYY), an ileocolonic peptide, is released by luminal nutrients and exogenous cholecystokinin (CCK). The importance of luminal nutrients as major PYY releasers was recently challenged when significant increases in plasma PYY were observed in response to pancreatic juice diversion in rats free of luminal nutrients. These recent data raise questions concerning the potential mediators of PYY release. This study was undertaken therefore to determine the role of endogenous CCK and the effects of exogenous caerulein, secretin and bombesin on PYY release. Male Wistar rats prepared with pancreatic, biliary, duodenal and jugular vein cannulae were used 4-7 days postoperatively. Pancreatic juice diversion significantly increased pancreatic volume and protein output with concomitant increases in plasma CCK and PYY concentrations. During pancreatic juice diversion, infusion of MK-329, a CCK-receptor antagonist, did not affect CCK release but completely abolished pancreatic volume and protein output and PYY release. The intraduodenal infusion of SBTI significantly stimulated pancreatic secretion and CCK release without any effect on PYY release. Furthermore, infusions of the CCK analog, caerulein, secretin and bombesin had no effect on PYY release. These results suggest the involvement of endogenous CCK in PYY release but this mediation seems to necessitate the participation of other as yet unknown factors since exogenous caerulein, secretin or bombesin cannot induce PYY release when given alone.", 
    "85": "Ligand-binding assays are used for determination of minute amounts of substances in the bloodstream. Such assays require a receptor that specifically binds the substance of interest. The receptor used is often an antibody, but antibodies require special handling and a costly production procedure. We have used molecular imprinting, a method for creating selective recognition sites in synthetic polymers, to prepare polymers that mimic antibody combining sites. Molecular imprints made against theophylline and diazepam showed strong binding and cross-reactivity profiles similar to those of antibodies. Here we describe a new radiolabelled ligand-binding assay, the molecularly imprinted sorbent assay, which uses antibody mimics. This assay accurately measures drug levels in human serum, with results comparable to those obtained using a well established immunoassay technique. Antibody mimics, which are stable and readily prepared by molecular imprinting, may provide a useful general alternative to antibodies.",

Histamine concentration in the cells was assayed with spectrofluorimetric technique described by Shor and modified by Scov and Norn, using anti-IgE and metacholine as liberators. It was showed, that pirenzepine inhibits histamine release caused by both anti-IgE and metacholine. In the latter case this inhibitory effect was more significant. Beta-sympathicomimetics acted conversely, significantly inhibiting immunological histamine release. This effect was weaker, if metacholine was used. Combination of these agents increased protective effect of pirenzepine on histamine release induced by metacholine.", 
    "87": "The alpha subunit complements of natural gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor subpopulations were investigated by their purification from mammalian cerebral cortex and cerebellum by immunoaffinity chromatography using antibodies raised against peptide sequences unique to the alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, and alpha 6 subunits. Receptors purified from cerebral cortex by anti-Cys alpha 2 414-424 and anti-Cys alpha 3 454-467 antibody affinity columns in series had immunoreactivity with alpha 2 and alpha 3 but not alpha 1 subunit-specific antibodies. Receptors purified from cerebellum by a new affinity column matrix, anti-alpha 6 1-16 Cys whole antibody, or the Fab fragment thereof, enriched for alpha 6 subunit immunoreactivity. A further series of experiments demonstrated the partial coexistence of this alpha 6 subunit immunoreactivity with that for the alpha 1 but not the alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunits. These results provide additional evidence for the existence of GABAA receptor subpopulations with heterogeneous alpha subunit complements yielding increased structural diversity of natural GABAA receptors. Furthermore, they substantiate previous findings implicating the presence of two alpha subunits per receptor oligomer.",

Both SO2 and HBr were tested as reactant gases. With SO2, a detection limit of 50 pg of diazepam and a linear range of 4 orders of magnitude were achieved, and the experimental data were reproducible. With HBr, the detection limit was 10 ng of diazepam and the linear dynamic range was only 2 orders of magnitude. The possible pharmacological application of CRIMS was studied using urine spiked with diazepam and several of its metabolites, and the results show CRIMS to be a simple but potentially powerful method in drug metabolism studies.",

The effect of ligands of the mBzR on two inner mitochondrial membrane channel activities was determined with patch-clamp techniques. The relative inhibitory potencies of the drugs resemble their binding affinities for the mBzR. Ro5-4864 and protoporphyrin IX inhibit activity of the multiple conductance channel (MCC) and the mitochondrial centum-picosiemen (mCtS) channel activities at nanomolar concentrations. PK11195 inhibits mCtS activity at similar levels. Higher concentrations of protoporphyrin IX induce MCC but possibly not mCtS activity. Clonazepam, which has low affinity for mBzR, is at least 500 times less potent at both channel activities. Ro15-1788, which also has a low mBzR affinity, inhibits MCC at very high concentrations (16 microM). The findings indicate an association of these two channel activities with the proteins forming the mBzR complex and are consistent with an interaction of inner and outer membrane channels.",

Pretreatment with aniracetam (50 nmol i.c.v., 15 min before drugs) increases the ED50 values (mumol/kg i.p., 15 min) for GYKI 52466-induced protection against sound-induced clonic seizures in DBA/2 mice 7 fold, from 20.1 (11.9-33.9) to 142 (91.7-219), and for NBQX-induced protection 2 fold, from 39.7 (33.8-46.7) to 85.6 (63.9-115), respectively. Aniracetam on its own (12.5-100 nmol i.c.v.) has no convulsant activity, but reverses the anticonvulsant effect of GYKI 52466 (60 mumol/kg i.p., 15 min) in a dose-dependent manner.",

Here we describe the localization of muscarinic receptor-induced FOS protein, within the rat central nervous system (CNS), following administration of pilocarpine (25 mg/kg). High levels of FOS induction were apparent in many forebrain structures including the primary olfactory (piriform) cortex, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, neocortex and supra-optic nucleus of the hypothalamus. Within the neocortex FOS induction followed a laminar distribution being highest in layers 4 and 6 with lower induction seen in layers 2 and 5. Other areas showing FOS induction included the striatum, septum, inferior colliculus, thalamus, hypothalamus and several brainstem nuclei. Both atropine (10 mg/kg) and pirenzepine (100 mg/kg) reduced FOS induction suggesting that a pirenzepine-sensitive muscarinic receptor was involved. The possible significance of muscarinic-mediated FOS induction, to cholinergic kindling and the cholinergic hypothesis of learning and memory, is discussed.",

The results showed that both drugs produced effects similar to those observed earlier with clonazepam. The second aim was to investigate the effects of the two compounds on consumption of a 0.005% quinine solution in a two-choice test. Both drugs increased the consumption of the quinine solution without alteration in water intake. In addition, in separate single-choice acceptance tests, both drugs significantly increased the consumption of a familiar, highly palatable 3% sucrose solution.

Triazolam and ethanol produced dose-related and time-related effects on subject ratings of mood and perceived drug effects and objective measures of memory and psychomotor performance. Dose-response curves for the two drugs were not parallel, and therefore, comparisons of the two drugs were based upon comparisons of the high dose of each drug. Although the two high-dose conditions generally were not different from one another, there were differences in their relative effect sizes, which were important. The high dose of each drug produced comparable degrees of impairment on two different psychomotor tasks. Triazolam, but not ethanol, produced significant impairment on two different memory tasks. The relative effects of each drug on subject ratings of mood and perceived drug effects varied across different subject-rated measures. Only ethanol significantly increased subject ratings of alcohol strength and feeling drunk. In comparison to ethanol, triazolam tended to produce less-pronounced subject ratings of drug effect magnitude, drug liking, and estimated performance impairment. However, less-pronounced subjective effects of triazolam were not universally observed on all subject ratings. Triazolam produced greater effects on several sedative symptoms and produced comparable effects on several mood factor scales."
