In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, 48 patients with first-episode schizophrenia who were eligible for olanzapine treatment, were randomly assigned to olanzapine plus either melatonin 3\u00a0mg/day or matched placebo for eight weeks. Anthropometric and metabolic parameters as well as psychiatric symptoms using The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were assessed at baseline, week 4, and 8. Primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in weight at week 8. Data were analyzed using t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, and mixed-effects model. Thirty-six patients had at least one post-baseline measurement. At week eight, melatonin was associated with significantly less weight gain [mean difference (MD)\u00a0=\u00a03.2\u00a0kg, P\u00a0=\u00a00.023], increase in waist circumference [MD\u00a0=\u00a02.83\u00a0cm, P\u00a0=\u00a00.041] and triglyceride concentration [MD\u00a0=\u00a062\u00a0mg/dl, P\u00a0=\u00a00.090 (nearly significant)] than the placebo. Changes in cholesterol, insulin, and blood sugar concentrations did not differ significantly between the two groups. Patients in the melatonin group experienced significantly more reduction in their PANSS scores [MD\u00a0=\u00a012.9 points, P\u00a0=\u00a00.014] than the placebo group. No serious adverse events were reported. To summarize, in patients treated with olanzapine, short-term melatonin treatment attenuates weight gain, abdominal obesity, and hypertriglyceridemia. It might also provide additional benefit for treatment of psychosis. The study was registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov (",

    "2": "Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is a method for evaluating the outcomes and costs of competing strategies designed to improve health, and has been applied to a variety of different scientific fields. Yet there are inherent complexities in cost estimation and CEA from statistical perspectives (e.g., skewness, bidimensionality, and censoring). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio that represents the additional cost per unit of outcome gained by a new strategy has served as the most widely accepted methodology in the CEA. In this article, we call for expanded perspectives and reporting standards reflecting a more comprehensive analysis that can elucidate different aspects of available data. Specifically, we propose that mean- and median-based incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and average cost-effectiveness ratios be reported together, along with relevant summary and inferential statistics, as complementary measures for informed decision making.",

We report a case of a 60-year-old woman who presented with high-grade fever, muscular rigidity, tachycardia, tachypnoea and altered sensorium along with seizures. She had been taking olanzapine for the past 2 years for psychosis. For the last month valproate was added to her treatment. Her blood investigations revealed hyponatraemia and raised serum ammonia and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels. In view of hyperthermia, muscular rigidity, autonomic disturbances, altered mental status and raised CPK, a diagnosis of NMS was made. Valproate could have probably precipitated NMS; although the patient was taking antipsychotics for a long time, it was only with the addition of valproate that she developed these symptoms. Raised serum ammonia levels also indicated the presence of valproate toxicity. Seizures were probably due to electrolyte disturbances. Offending drugs were withdrawn. The patient improved with treatment by dopamine agonist and other supportive treatments.", 
    "4": "Designer benzodiazepines, first offered in online shops selling 'research chemicals' in 2012, provide an attractive alternative to prescription-only benzodiazepines as they are readily available over the Internet at a low price. However, as data regarding pharmacokinetic parameters, metabolism, and detectability in biological fluids are limited, they present a challenge for forensic laboratories. Most recently, diclazepam (other names: 2-chlorodiazepam, Ro 5-3448 or 7-chloro-5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-methyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one) emerged as a new compound in this class of drugs. In this paper, this new designer benzodiazepine was characterized utilizing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as well as liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques. Furthermore, a self-experiment was performed to gain preliminary data on pharmacokinetic properties and to identify the main metabolites. For this purpose, one tablet of diclazepam (declared amount: 1 mg) was ingested by one of the authors, and serum as well as urine samples were collected for 14 and 21 days, respectively. Based on this study, diclazepam has an approximate elimination half-life of 42 h and is metabolized into the pharmacologically active benzodiazepines delorazepam, lorazepam, and lormetazepam which can be detected in urine for 6, 19, and 11 days, respectively, when applying the presented LC-MS/MS method. In serum, the consumption could be proven between 99 h post-intake targeting the parent compound and up to 10 days targeting the metabolite delorazepam. As immunochemical assays are applied for screening purposes quite often, detectability using this technique was assessed, especially since detection of low-dosed benzodiazepines can be sometimes problematic. However, only one of the utilized immunochemical assays was capable of detecting the intake of one tablet diclazepam, and the positive results were restricted to a few urine samples showing relatively high creatinine concentrations.",

The cynomolgus monkey is widely used as one of the nonrodent preclinical safety species in pharmaceutical research. In the current study, the potential application of 4\u03b2-hydroxycholesterol as an endogenous biomarker of CYP3A in response to drug treatment was evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys. Following multiple oral administration of rifampicin (a known CYP3A inducer) at 15 mg/kg/d in cynomolgus monkeys, the mean serum 4\u03b2-hydroxycholesterol levels increased 4-fold from the baseline of 55.3 \u00b1 21.7 to 221 \u00b1 53.4 ng/ml. The mean concentration ratios of 4\u03b2-hydroxycholesterol to cholesterol increased 5-fold. The data suggest that 4\u03b2-hydroxycholesterol formation from cholesterol metabolism was induced by rifampicin treatment in monkeys. This observation correlated with the metabolism of midazolam (a probe substrate of CYP3A activity) monitored in the same study. The serum exposure (area under the curve) of midazolam was markedly decreased by \u223c95%, confirming the induction of CYP3A catalytic activity by rifampicin treatment in monkeys. The formation of 4\u03b2-hydroxycholesterol from cholesterol was specifically mediated by recombinant cynomolgus CYP3A8 and CYP3A5.

The practice received little attention until the arrival of antipsychotic drugs, which replaced older sedatives and became the agents most strongly associated with the treatment of aggression and challenging behaviour. Emergency sedation was subsequently portrayed in psychiatric literature and advertising as a therapeutic and diagnosis-driven endeavour, and the concept of rapid tranquillisation emerged in this context in the 1970s. Use of non-antipsychotic sedatives, like the benzodiazepines, is barely visible in contemporary sources, and the research suggests that antipsychotics became the mainstay of rapid tranquillisation strategies because of beliefs about their specific therapeutic properties in psychosis and schizophrenia, and not because of demonstrated superiority over other agents.",

However, the mechanisms underlying the adolescent susceptibility to chronic cannabis exposure are poorly understood. Given that the psychoactive constituent of cannabis binds to the CB1 cannabinoid receptor, the present study was designed to determine the impact of a CB1 receptor agonist (WIN) during specific windows of adolescence on the functional maturation of the rat PFC. By means of local field potential recordings and ventral hippocampal stimulation in vivo, we found that a history of WIN exposure during early (postnatal days - P35-40) or mid-(P40-45) adolescence, but not in late adolescence (P50-55) or adulthood (P75-80), is sufficient to yield a state of frequency-dependent prefrontal disinhibition in adulthood comparable to that seen in the juvenile PFC. Remarkably, this prefrontal disinhibition could be normalized following a single acute local infusion of the GABA-A\u03b11 positive allosteric modulator Indiplon, suggesting that adolescent exposure to WIN causes a functional downregulation of GABAergic transmission in the PFC. Accordingly, in vitro recordings from adult rats exposed to WIN during adolescence demonstrate that local prefrontal GABAergic transmission onto layer V pyramidal neurons is markedly reduced to the level seen in the P30-35 PFC. Together, these results indicate that early and mid-adolescence constitute a critical period during which repeated CB1 receptor stimulation is sufficient to elicit an enduring state of PFC network disinhibition resulting from a developmental impairment of local prefrontal GABAergic transmission.",

WM is not a standalone treatment for substance dependence, but is commonly a first attempt at treatment. AWM is often more acceptable to patients, and cheaper, than in-patient services. What does this paper add? About two-thirds of patients entering an AWM program operating since 2001 continue to complete the program. What are the implications for practitioners? AWM can be carried out successfully through public drug and alcohol services, although clinic staff support is important.", 
    "62": "To examine psychiatric prescribing in response to perinatal/neonatal death, we analyzed data from a cross-sectional survey of 235 bereaved parents participating in an online support community. Of the 88 respondents prescribed medication, antidepressants were most common (n = 70, 79.5%) followed by benzodiazepines/sleep aids (n = 18, 20.5%). Many prescriptions were written shortly after the death (32.2% within 48 hr, 43.7% within a week, and 74.7% within a month). Obstetrician/gynecologists wrote most prescriptions given shortly after loss. Most respondents prescribed antidepressants took them long-term. This sample is select, but these data raise disturbing questions about prescribing practices for grieving parents.", 
    "63": "Hyperprolactinaemia, a common side effect of some antipsychotic drugs, is also present in drug-na\u00efve psychotic patients and subjects at risk for psychosis. Recent studies in non-psychiatric populations suggest that increased prolactin may have negative effects on cognition. The aim of our study was to explore whether high plasma prolactin levels are associated with poorer cognitive functioning in subjects with early psychoses. We studied 107 participants: 29 healthy subjects and 78 subjects with an early psychosis (55 psychotic disorders with <3 years of illness, 23 high-risk subjects). Cognitive assessment was performed with the MATRICS Cognitive Consensus Cognitive Battery, and prolactin levels were determined as well as total cortisol levels in plasma. Psychopathological status was assessed and the use of psychopharmacological treatments (antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzodiazepines) recorded. Prolactin levels were negatively associated with cognitive performance in processing speed, in patients with a psychotic disorder and high-risk subjects. In the latter group, increased prolactin levels were also associated with impaired reasoning and problem solving and poorer general cognition. In a multiple linear regression analysis conducted in both high-risk and psychotic patients, controlling for potential confounders, prolactin and benzodiazepines were independently related to poorer cognitive performance in the speed of processing domain. A mediation analysis showed that both prolactin and benzodiazepine treatment act as mediators of the relationship between risperidone/paliperidone treatment and speed of processing. These results suggest that increased prolactin levels are associated with impaired processing speed in early psychosis. If these results are confirmed in future studies, strategies targeting reduction of prolactin levels may improve cognition in this population.", 
    "64": "Benzodiazepines are detected in a significant number of drug facilitated sexual assaults (DFSA). Whilst blood and urine from the victim are routinely analysed, due to the delay in reporting DFSA cases and the short half lives of most of these drugs in blood and urine, drug detection in such samples is problematic. Consideration of the drinks involved and analysis for drugs may start to address this. Here we have reconstructed the 'spiking' of three benzodiazepines (diazepam, flunitrazepam and temazepam) into five drinks, an alcopop (flavoured alcoholic drink), a beer, a white wine, a spirit, and a fruit based non-alcoholic drink (J2O) chosen as representative of those drinks commonly used by women in 16-24 year old age group. Using a validated GC-MS method for the simultaneous detection of these drugs in the drinks we have studied the storage stability of the benzodiazepines under two different storage conditions, uncontrolled room temperature and refrigerator (4\u00b0C) over a 25 day period. All drugs could be detected in all beverages over this time period. Diazepam was found to be stable in all of the beverages, except the J2O, under both storage conditions. Flunitrazepam and temazepam were found not to be stable but were detectable (97% loss of temazepam and 39% loss of flunitrazepam from J2O). The recommendations from this study are that there should be a policy change and that drinks thought to be involved in DFSA cases should be collected and analysed wherever possible to support other evidence types.",

The Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) aims to contribute relevant information regarding the development and progression of clinical and subclinical chronic diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, in one such setting. At Visit 1, we enrolled 15 105 civil servants from predefined universities or research institutes. Baseline assessment (2008-10) included detailed interviews and measurements to assess social and biological determinants of health, as well as various clinical and subclinical conditions related to diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and mental health. A second visit of interviews and examinations is under way (2012-14) to enrich the assessment of cohort exposures and to detect initial incident events. Annual surveillance has been conducted since 2009 for the ascertainment of incident events. Biological samples (sera, plasma, urine and DNA) obtained at both visits have been placed in long-term storage. Baseline data are available for analyses, and collaboration via specific research proposals directed to study investigators is welcome.", 
    "66": "The prion diseases are rare neurodegenerative conditions that cause complex and highly variable neuropsychiatric syndromes, often with remarkably rapid progression. Prominent behavioral and psychiatric symptoms have been recognized since these diseases were first described. While research on such symptoms in common dementias has led to major changes in the way these symptoms are managed, evidence to guide the care of patients with prion disease is scarce. The authors review the published research and draw on more than 10 years' experience at the U.K. National Prion Clinic, including two large prospective clinical research studies in which more than 300 patients with prion disease have been followed up from diagnosis to death, with detailed observational data gathered on symptomatology and symptomatic treatments. The authors group behavioral and psychiatric symptoms into psychotic features, agitated features, and mood disorder and describe their natural history, showing that they spontaneously improve or resolve in many patients and are short-lived in many others because of rapid progression of global neurological disability. Diagnostic category, disease severity, age, gender, and genetic variation are or may be predictive factors. The authors review the observational data on pharmacological treatment of these symptoms in the U.K. clinical studies and make cautious recommendations for clinical practice. While nonpharmacological measures should be the first-line interventions for these symptoms, the authors conclude that there is a role for judicious use of pharmacological agents in some patients: antipsychotics for severe psychosis or agitation; benzodiazepines, particularly in the late stages of disease; and antidepressants for mood disorder.", 
    "67": "The anesthetic effect of a combination of medetomidine, midazolam and butorphanol (Me-Mi-Bu) was evaluated in healthy cynomolgus monkeys. The Me-Mi-Bu combination was intramuscularly administered as follows: Dose 1, Me 0.015 mg/kg-Mi 0.1 mg/kg-Bu 0.15 mg/kg; Dose 2, Me 0.02 mg/kg-Mi 0.15 mg/kg-Bu 0.2 mg/kg; and Dose 3, Me 0.04 mg/kg-Mi 0.3 mg/kg-Bu 0.4 mg/kg. The combination rapidly induced immobilization, and lateral recumbency was reached within 15 min. The duration of anesthesia for each dose administered was follows: Dose 1, 47 \u00b1 27 min; Dose 2, 113 \u00b1 31 min; and Dose 3, 190 \u00b1 24 min. The anesthetic effect of the combination was abolished by the \u03b12-adrenoceptor antagonist atipamezole. No marked changes in the levels of hematologic or serum biochemical parameters were noted in cynomolgus monkeys administered the combination plus atipamezole. Taken together, these results suggest that the Me-Mi-Bu combination exhibits reversible anesthetic effect and may be useful for studies involving cynomolgus monkeys.", 
    "68": "Insulin-induced insulin receptor (IR) tyrosine kinase activation and insulin cell survival responses have been reported to be under the regulation of a membrane associated mammalian neuraminidase-1 (Neu1). The molecular mechanism(s) behind this process is unknown. Here, we uncover a novel Neu1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) cross-talk in alliance with neuromedin B G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), which is essential for insulin-induced IR activation and cellular signaling. Neu1, MMP-9 and neuromedin B GPCR form a complex with IR\u03b2 subunit on the cell surface. Oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu\u00ae), anti-Neu1 antibodies, broad range MMP inhibitors piperazine and galardin (GM6001), MMP-9 specific inhibitor (MMP-9i), and GPCR neuromedin B specific antagonist BIM-23127 dose-dependently inhibited Neu1 activity associated with insulin stimulated rat hepatoma cells (HTCs) that overly express human IRs (HTC-IR). Tamiflu, anti-Neu1 antibodies and MMP-9i attenuated phosphorylation of IR\u03b2 and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) associated with insulin-stimulated cells. Olanzapine, an antipsychotic agent associated with insulin resistance, induced Neu3 sialidase activity in WG544 or 1140F01 human sialidosis fibroblast cells genetically defective in Neu1. Neu3 antagonist 2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (DANA) and anti-Neu3 antibodies inhibited sialidase activity associated with olanzapine treated murine Neu4 knockout macrophage cells. Olanzapine attenuated phosphorylation of IGF-R and IRS1 associated with insulin-stimulated human wild-type fibroblast cells. Our findings identify a novel insulin receptor-signaling platform that is critically essential for insulin-induced IR\u03b2 tyrosine kinase activation and cellular signaling. Olanzapine-induced Neu3 sialidase activity attenuated insulin-induced IGF-R and IRS1 phosphorylation contributing to insulin resistance.",

    "73": "The present study evaluated the effects of acepromazine combined with midazolam and morphine on sedation and cardiovascular variables as well as the propofol dose required for induction of anesthesia in dogs compared with acepromazine-morphine or midazolam-morphine. Dogs were randomly assigned to receive an intramuscular administration of (1) acepromazine (0.05 mg/kg) with 0.5mg/kg of morphine (group AM, n=10), (2) midazolam (0.5mg/kg) with 0.5mg/kg of morphine (group MM, n=9), or (3) acepromazine with midazolam and morphine at the same doses (group AMM, n=10). After 30 min, sedation was assessed by a numeric descriptive scale (NDS, range 0-3) and a simple numerical scale (SNS, range 0-10). Dogs were then administered IV propofol to allow endotracheal intubation. NDS and SNS scores were significantly higher in the AMM than in the MM group (P<0.05). There was a trend towards more dogs presenting with intense sedation (NDS=3) in AMM (6/10 dogs) compared with AM (1/10 dogs) and MM (1/9 dogs) (P=0.057). The propofol dose required for induction of anesthesia was significantly lower in AMM (4.0mg/kg) compared with MM (6.0mg/kg, P<0.01) but not AM (4.6 mg/kg). Heart rate decreased in AM after treatment and after intubation. Blood pressure decreased in groups AM and AMM following treatment and in all groups after intubation. The combination AMM resulted in intense sedation more frequently than AM and MM, and provided the greatest sparing effect in the propofol dose. Administration of AM and AMM but not MM decreased blood pressure although hypotension was not recorded in healthy dogs.", 
    "74": "Schizophrenia has been associated with central nervous system and peripheral immune system imbalances. However, most studies have not yielded conclusive results due to limitations such as small sample size, dissimilarities in the clinical status of patients and the high variability of cytokine levels within the normal human population. Here, we have attempted to account for these limitations by carrying out standardised multiplex immunoassay analyses of 9 cytokines in serum from 180 antipsychotic-na\u00efve first-episode schizophrenia patients and 350 matched controls across 5 clinical cohorts. All subjects were matched for potential confounding factors including age, gender, smoking and body mass index. We found that the levels of interleukin (IL)-1RA, IL-10 and IL-15 were increased significantly in patients across the cohorts. We also found that the levels of IL-1RA and IL-10 were decreased in 32 patients who had been followed up and treated for 6 weeks with atypical antipsychotics. Interestingly, we found that the changes in IL-10 levels were significantly correlated with the improvements in negative, general and total symptom scores. These results indicate that mixed pro- and anti-inflammatory responses may be altered in first onset patients, suggesting a role in the aetiology of schizophrenia. The finding that only the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 responded to treatment in parallel with symptom improvement suggests that this could be used as a potential treatment response biomarker in future studies of schizophrenia.",

Patients in the United States could have received clobazam for 6\u00a0years before it became commercially available. Efficacy assessments included changes in rates of drop seizures and total seizures, responder rates (\u226550%, \u226575%, or 100% decreases in seizure frequency vs. baseline), sustained efficacy over time, concomitant antiepileptic drug (AED) use, and global evaluations. Safety assessments included exposure to clobazam, laboratory assessments, physical and neurologic examinations, vital sign monitoring, electrocardiography monitoring, and adverse event reporting.",

Two hundred seven patients were from the United States, which was the only country in which patients could be treated with clobazam for >2\u00a0years. Forty-four patients were treated with clobazam for 5\u00a0years, and 11 for 6\u00a0years. Because of the low number of Year 6 patients, this group is not reported separately. Improvements in baseline seizure rates were very stable over the course of the study, with a median 85% decrease in drop seizures at Year 1, 87% at Year 2, 92% at Year 3, 97% at Year 4, and a 91% decrease for patients who had reached Year 5. Similar results were observed for total seizures (79% decrease at both Years 1 and 2, 82% decrease at Year 3, 75% decrease at Year 4, and 85% decrease at Year 5). Responder rates were also stable for the duration of the trial. Of patients who had achieved a \u226550% decrease in median drop-seizure frequency from baseline to Month 3, 86% still had that degree of drop-seizure reduction at Year 3 (and 14% lost their initial responses), and 47% were drop-seizure-free. Most patients who had achieved drop-seizure freedom in the original controlled trials remained drop-seizure-free in the OLE. Based on parents' and physicians' ratings of global evaluations, 80% of patients were \"very much improved\" or \"much improved\" after 3\u00a0years.

Khamira Gaozaban Ambri Jadwar Ood Salib wala (KGJ), is a product of Hamdard Laboratories (Waqf) Pakistan. They claim that it is anxiolytic, anti-convulsant and nervine tonic. However this claim is not scientifically proven. Some components are proved to be anxiolytic but combination may alter the individual properties of drugs. Therefore we designed present study to prove these properties of KGJ scientifically. Thirty male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into five groups of six animals in each group. The groups were saline group, control group (receiving Diazepam I mg/kg) and three test groups receiving 86, 170 and 360 mg/kg doses of Khamira orally. Assessments of different doses of KGJ in comparison to diazepam were carried out on anxiety paradigms namely \"Elevated Plus Maze\", \"Light And Dark Activity Box\" and \"Open Field\" paradigms. KGJ produced anxiolytic effects in all the behavioral methods, which were not significantly different from the effects produced by diazepam. Basal levels of corticosterone not altered by diazepam were decreased by 86 mg/kg dose of KGJ. Same dose of KGJ also decreased blood glucose levels. In conclusion, these results suggest anxiolytic potential of KGJ with non-sedative property.",

Restless nocturnal eating arises, intensifies, and subsides in parallel to motor symptoms. Once misdiagnosed as psychophysiological insomnia, RLS patients are frequently treated with benzodiazepine receptor agonists. The CNS actions of these sedating agents, suppression of memory and executive function, unleash predisposed amnestic behaviors.

Control group received a total of 2 ml of physiological saline (0.9% NaCl). We subjected the gerbils to an adapted \"Open Field\" to determine the possible effects on central nervous system of midazolam. Gerbils were allowed to move freely in the open field.

We argue that, using a sedative and anticonvulsive drug such as midazolam via conjunctival route may be useful in some clinical situations. Therefore, it could be beneficial to develop a new conjunctival formulation of midazolam. Also, there is a need for trials in humans with pharmacokinetic studies.", 
    "108": "Abstract Background: The leaves of Antiaris toxicaria Lesch. (Moraceae) are used by traditional medicine practitioners in southwest Nigeria in the management of epilepsy, wounds, and neurological disorders. Hence, this study was undertaken to investigate the effect of the aqueous leaf extract of A. toxicaria on the central nervous system. Methods: One hour after administration of A. toxicaria [50-300 mg/kg orally (p.o.)], its antidepressant effect was evaluated using the forced swimming test (FST), anxiolytic effect using elevated plus maze (EPM) test, and anticataleptic effect using haloperidol-induced catalepsy, whereas its effects on hypnosis and motor coordination were studied using hexobarbitone-induced sleeping time and open-field tests, respectively, in mice. Results: Antiaris toxicaria (300 mg/kg) significantly increased swimming activity (36.88%) and reduced immobility time (38.54%). Pretreatment of mice with prazosin (an \u03b11-adrenoceptor antagonist), sulpiride (a D2 receptor antagonist), and l-NG-nitro-arginine (nitric oxide synthase inhibitor) 15 min before A. toxicaria (300 mg/kg p.o.) treatment significantly prevented its antidepressant-like effect by 35.58%, 53.30%, and 56.11%, respectively, in the FST. However, pretreatment with metergoline (5-HT2 receptor antagonist), and atropine (muscarinic cholinergic antagonist) failed to reverse this effect. Interestingly, A. toxicaria (50 mg/kg) significantly increased open-arm exploration in the EPM by 70.31%, which was reversed by 82.66% in the presence of flumazenil [3 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.)]. Haloperidol (1 mg/kg i.p.) induced cataleptic behavior in mice, which was reversed by A. toxicaria (300 mg/kg) (p<0.001) treatment. Conclusions: The results suggest that A. toxicaria possesses an antidepressant-like effect involving interaction with \u03b11-adrenoceptor, D2 dopamine receptor, and nitrergic pathway; an anxiolytic-like effect linked to the benzodiazepine system; and a neuroprotective effect.",

The relative risk of death in patients treated with antipsychotics compared to control patients was 2.354 (95% CI 1.704-3.279). The greatest increases in mortality rate occurred close to the last drug supply, and declined exponentially as time passed from the last drug supply in patients who stopped drug assumption. Quetiapine was the most commonly prescribed drug and higher doses of this drug were associated with higher mortality rates.", 
    "116": "These results are in line with the April 2005 warning of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that among elderly patients with dementia, the treatment of behavioural disorders with atypical antipsychotics is associated with a higher mortality rate. Given the potential risks of mortality with antipsychotics, and since antipsychotic medications may benefit only a minority of patients, new approaches are clearly needed to manage the neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia.", 
    "117": "Violent behavior associated with mental disorders is a common reason for admission to a psychiatric inpatient unit. Once hospitalized, patients may continue to be intermittently agitated and have persistent aggressive behaviors, preventing their discharge back into the community. Managing agitation quickly with effective pharmacological agents can avoid further escalation to aggression and violence. In the acute setting, this usually involves the parenteral use of antipsychotics, with or without benzodiazepines. Within the past decade, short-acting intramuscular formulations of second-generation antipsychotics have become available and provide a means to induce calm with a substantially lower risk of acute dystonia or akathisia compared with haloperidol. New alternative formulations that avoid injections include inhalation and sublingual administration. Longer-term management of persistent aggressive behavior by reducing the frequency and intensity of future episodes of agitation is more complex. In contrast to agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania, no agents have yet been approved by regulatory agencies for the treatment of persistent aggressive behavior. The strongest evidence supports the use of clozapine as an antihostility agent, followed by olanzapine. Adjunctive strategies with anticonvulsants and beta-adrenergic agents may also be worthwhile to consider.",

    "123": "Fluoxetine and its circulating metabolite norfluoxetine comprise a complex multiple-inhibitor system that causes reversible or time-dependent inhibition of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family members CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19 in vitro. Although significant inhibition of all three enzymes in vivo was predicted, the areas under the concentration-time curve (AUCs) for midazolam and lovastatin were unaffected by 2-week dosing of fluoxetine, whereas the AUCs of dextromethorphan and omeprazole were increased by 27- and 7.1-fold, respectively. This observed discrepancy between in vitro risk assessment and in vivo drug-drug interaction (DDI) profile was rationalized by time-varying dynamic pharmacokinetic models that incorporated circulating concentrations of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine enantiomers, mutual inhibitor-inhibitor interactions, and CYP3A4 induction. The dynamic models predicted all DDIs with less than twofold error. This study demonstrates that complex DDIs that involve multiple mechanisms, pathways, and inhibitors with their metabolites can be predicted and rationalized via characterization of all the inhibitory species in vitro.", 
    "124": "Although cases of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) induced akathisia have often been reported in literature, this adverse effect has not adequately been mentioned in major pharmacology textbooks. As a result, SSRIinduced akathisia is very frequently under-recognized. A review of literature showed that almost all frequently used SSRIs such as Fluvoxamine, Fluoxetine, Sertraline, Citalopram have been reported to be causing akathisia. SSRI-induced restless legs syndrome and movement disorders have also been reported. However, Escitalopram-induced akathisia is rare. In our review of literature, we could find only one single case of Escitalopram-induced severe akathisia. And this specific SSRI drug has rarely been implicated with occurrence of restless legs syndrome and extra-pyramidal side-effects like dytonia etc. Here, we present a case of Escitalopram-induced severe akathisia - a 53year old female, who had developed severe akathisia after taking Escitalopram for a few days. According to the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), her Global Clinical Assessment of Akathisia Score was 5 i.e. severe akathisia. As per Naronjo Adverse Drug Reaction Scale the probability of association of this adverse reaction with Escitalopram was 7 (i.e. probable). Her symptoms continued in spite of prompt discontinuation of the drug. But, she improved rapidly with the use of Propranolol and Clonazepam. On the last follow-up, she was free from any symptoms. As new generation antidepressants are rarely associated with extra-pyramidal symptoms, the recognition of such adverse effects requires a high index of suspicion. Early recognition of the symptoms and discontinuation of the offending agent along with supportive therapy like a short course of benzodiazepines, beta-adrenergic antagonists or anticholinergics may rapidly relieve the patient from this distressing symptom.",

Hair samples from the accompanying parent were also collected. The samples were analyzed for the presence of opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, and cannabinoids by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Parental sociodemographics and possible drug of abuse history were recorded. Hair samples from twenty-three children (20.1%) were positive for cocaine (concentration range 0.15-3.81 ng/mg hair), those of thirteen children (11.4%) to cannabinoids (D9-THC concentration range 0.05-0.54 ng/mg hair), with four samples positive to codeine (0.1-0.25 ng/mg hair), one positive for 2.09 ng methadone per mg hair and one to 6-MAM (0.42 ng/mg hair) and morphine (0. 15 ng/mg hair) . In 69.5 and 69.2% of the positive cocaine and cannabinoids cases respectively, drugs was also found in the hair of accompanying parent.

    "150": "Haloperidol induced catalepsy was determined using the classic bar test and a new MED Associates Catalepsy Test Chamber instrument. The dose that produced an adverse effect in 50% of rats (AED50) for haloperidol was calculated using the instrument data as 0.29 mg/kg. Hand scoring of the video recordings gave AED50 values of 0.30 and 0.31 mg/kg, both well within the 95% CL of the instrument data. Clozapine was also evaluated and catalepsy was not detected up to 40 mg/kg. No significant difference was found between the instrument and hand scoring data. The instrument was useful for testing haloperidol and clozapine, relieving much of the tedium and variability experienced without its use. It was especially valuable at measuring shorter time periods, where the researcher cannot react as quickly. Finally, olanzapine was also evaluated. However, clenched forepaws and hind paws prevented the use of the instrument alone at higher doses. A backup stopwatch was used for the bar test in these cases. Some of the advantages and limitations are discussed. Results are also compared to the crossed-legs position (CLP) test for all three antipsychotics. While haloperidol gave similar results at all concentrations tested, clozapine deviated significantly at the highest dose (40 mg/kg) displaying catalepsy in the CLP test but not in the bar test. Olanzapine displayed catalepsy in rats significantly different from vehicle at 40 mg/kg in both the bar and CLP tests. However, the CLP test may be more suited to compounds with gripping problems which prevent the consistent grasping of the bar. Overall, the instrument was found to be a useful aid in conducting the bar test for catalepsy. The CLP test was found to complement the bar test under certain conditions and could provide additional data that might be missed by the bar test for compounds producing grasping problems.",

The literature contains few studies concerning preoperative midazolam use in Caesarian section (C/S) patients. Our aim in this study was to help patients undergoing C/S surgery. One group scheduled for elective C/S received midazolam 0.025 mg kg(-1) intravenously, the other received saline. Maternal anxiety was evaluated using Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS) scores, and newborns were evaluated using Apgar and the Neonatal Neurologic and Adaptive Capacity Score (NACS). In conclusion, patients receiving midazolam 0.025 mg kg(-1) as premedication had significantly low anxiety scores, without any adverse effects on the newborns. Midazolam can therefore safely be used as a premedicative agent in C/S surgery.", 
    "152": "Modern pharmacotherapy for alcohol dependence has its roots in the failure of National Prohibition in the United States and the rise of the disease model of alcoholism (embodied in Alcoholics Anonymous). In 1948, disulfiram was the first medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat alcohol dependence, but its efficacy has not been supported by randomized controlled trials. In the 1960s, benzodiazepines replaced older treatments for alcohol withdrawal, but sedative and dependence-producing effects limit their utility in the postwithdrawal period. In the 1980s, the focus shifted to the treatment of co-occurring psychiatric disorders and medications that modify negative mood states, which contribute to relapse to heavy drinking. In the 1990s, developments in neurobiology implicated specific neurotransmitter systems underlying alcohol's effects, culminating in the 1994 approval by the FDA of the opioid antagonist naltrexone to treat alcohol dependence. In 2006, the FDA approved a long-acting formulation of naltrexone. Recently, nalmefene, another opioid receptor antagonist, was approved in Europe for as-needed use to reduce heavy drinking. Acamprosate, an amino acid derivative, first approved in France in 1989, received FDA approval in 2004. However, the beneficial effects of the approved medications are only modestly greater than those of placebo, and their use is limited. Topiramate, currently under investigation for alcohol dependence, has greater efficacy but a variety of adverse effects. In addition to the identification of novel compounds, the future of alcohol dependence pharmacotherapy will depend on developments in pharmacogenetics, in which genetic variation that moderates treatment efficacy and adverse effects is used to personalize treatment.",

Elective operations should be postponed, until the arrhythmias and myocardial function are well tolerated. There has been no guideline on the anesthetic management of this serious, despite rare, disease and there are a few reports of the patients undergoing operation under either general or regional anesthesia. The most important issue of the anesthetic management is to avoid excessive sympathetic stimulation, especially beta stimulation which can easily induce life-threatening arrhythmias. Also, it is better to avoid adrenalin as an adjunct to the local anesthetics. Anesthetic maintenance was performed with volatile anesthetics except halothane, opiates, muscle relaxants except pancuronium and intravenous anesthetics including propofol, ketamine and benzodiazepines. Invasive monitoring of arterial blood pressure and central venous pressure is recommended and transesophageal echocardiography, if available, provides diagnostic information for an intraoperative cardiac event. It is essential to apply alpha-adrenergic agonists instead of beta-agonists for intraoperative hemodynamic support. The arrhythmias should be managed with beta-blockers or amiodarone.

In the present study, the anxiolytic activity of standardized methanolic extract of root of AR (MAR) was evaluated in open-field test (OFT), hole-board, and elevated plus maze (EPM) tests. Rats received oral pretreatment of MAR in the doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg daily for 7 days and then were evaluated for the anxiolytic activity in different animal models. Both MAR (100 and 200 mg/kg) and diazepam (1 mg/kg, p.o.) increased the grooming behavior, number of central squares crossed, and time spent in the central area during OFT. Further, MAR (100 and 200 mg/kg) increased the head-dip and head-dip/sniffing behavior, and decreased sniffing activity in hole-board test. Furthermore, MAR (100 and 200 mg/kg) increased the percentage entries and time spent to open arm in EPM test paradigm. The anxiolytic activity in the experimental models was similar to that of diazepam. MAR (100 and 200 mg/kg) enhanced the level of amygdalar serotonin and norepinephrine. It also increased the expression of 5-HT2A receptors in the amygdala. In another set of experiment, flumazenil attenuated the anxiolytic effect of minimum effective dose of MAR (100 mg/kg) in OFT, hole-board, and EPM tests, indicating GABAA-mediated mechanism. Moreover, the anxiolytic dose of MAR did not show sedative-like effect in OFT and EPM tests compared to diazepam (6 mg/kg, p.o.). Thus, the anxiolytic response of MAR may involve GABA and serotonergic mechanisms. These preclinical data show that AR can be a potential agent for treatment of anxiety disorders.",

The use of flumazenil mitigated the patient's IH symptoms including excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep drunkenness and self-reported cognitive problems. The case both provides a possible treatment and system for short (subcutaneous (SC) administration) and longer term (implant) flumazenil delivery.

    "216": "Despite long-standing concerns regarding the abuse liability of benzodiazepines, the mechanisms underlying properties of benzodiazepines that may be relevant to abuse are still poorly understood. Earlier studies showed that compounds selective for \u03b11-containing GABAA receptors (\u03b11GABAARs) are abused by humans and self-administered by animals, and that these receptors may underlie a preference for benzodiazepines as well as neuroplastic changes observed in the ventral tegmental area following benzodiazepine administration. There is some evidence, however, that even L-838, 417, a compound with antagonistic properties at \u03b11GABAARs and agonistic properties at the other three benzodiazepine-sensitive GABAA receptor subtypes, is self-administered, and that the \u03b12GABAARs may have a role in benzodiazepine-induced reward enhancement. Using a two-bottle choice drinking paradigm to evaluate midazolam preference and an intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) paradigm to evaluate the impact of midazolam on reward enhancement, we demonstrated that mice carrying a histidine-to-arginine point mutation in the \u03b12 subunit which renders it insensitive to benzodiazepines (\u03b12(H101R) mice) did not prefer midazolam and did not show midazolam-induced reward enhancement in ICSS, in contrast to wild-type controls, suggesting that \u03b12GABAARs are necessary for the reward enhancing effects and preference for oral benzodiazepines. Through a viral-mediated knockdown of \u03b12GABAARs in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), we demonstrated that \u03b12 in the NAc is necessary for the preference for midazolam. Findings imply that \u03b12GABAARs in the NAc are involved in at least some reward-related properties of benzodiazepines, which might partially underlie repeated drug-taking behavior.",

    "220": "Alterations of cellular metabolism represent a hallmark of cancer. Numerous metabolic changes are required for malignant transformation, and they render malignant cells more prone to disturbances in the metabolic framework. Despite the high incidence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), metabolism of CLL cells remains a relatively unexplored area. The examined untreated CLL patients displayed a metabolic condition known as oxidative stress, which was linked to alterations in their lymphoid compartment. Our studies identified mitochondrial metabolism as the key source for abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS). Unlike in other malignant cells, we found increased oxidative phosphorylation in CLL cells but not increased aerobic glycolysis. Furthermore, CLL cells adapted to intrinsic oxidative stress by upregulating the stress-responsive heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Our data implicate that HO-1 was, beyond its function as an antioxidant, involved in promoting mitochondrial biogenesis. Thus ROS, adaptation to ROS, and mitochondrial biogenesis appear to form a self-amplifying feedback loop in CLL cells. Taking advantage of the altered metabolic profile, we were able to selectively target CLL cells by PK11195. This benzodiazepine derivate blocks the mitochondrial F1F0-ATPase, leads to a surplus production of mitochondrial superoxide, and thereby induces cell death in CLL cells. Taken together, our findings depict how bioenergetics and redox characteristics could be therapeutically exploited in CLL.",

    "222": "Intractable hiccups are a relatively uncommon condition characterized by involuntary, spasmodic contractions of the diaphragm. This type of hiccups generally has a duration of more than 1 month. We describe a 59-year-old kidney transplant recipient with a complicated medical history (atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, gastroesophageal reflux, gout, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea) who developed intractable hiccups that significantly affected his quality of life. Despite an extensive gastrointestinal and pulmonary evaluation, and treatment failures with several different drug regimens--metoclopramide, desipramine, amantadine, cyclobenzaprine, phenytoin, and lorazepam--his hiccups were eventually controlled with a combination of baclofen and low-dose olanzapine therapy. Baclofen is a c-aminobutyric acid (GABA) analog that contains a phenylethylamine moiety. It is hypothesized that having both GABA and phenylethylamine properties activates inhibitory neurotransmitters, most notably GABA, which may in turn block the hiccup stimulus. The exact mechanism through which olanzapine is effective in patients with hiccups is not fully understood. It is thought that the effect is, in part, due to serotonin augmenting phrenic motoneuronal activity on the reflex arcs involved in the generation of hiccups within the spinal cord. In addition, since olanazapine is a dopamine antagonist, particularly a dopamine D\u2082-receptor antagonist, this could also have played a role in its effectiveness in treating our patient. Strong evidence for a specific treatment regimen for intractable hiccups is lacking in the primary literature. Our case report adds to the available literature, as there are currently no published data on the use of combination therapy for the treatment of intractable hiccups, and the combination of baclofen and olanzapine significantly improved our patient's quality of life.", 
    "223": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a major clinical emergency that is associated with high mortality and morbidity. SE causes significant neuronal injury and survivors are at a greater risk of developing acquired epilepsy and other neurological morbidities, including depression and cognitive deficits. Benzodiazepines and some anticonvulsant agents are drugs of choice for initial SE management. Despite their effectiveness, over 40% of SE cases are refractory to the initial treatment with two or more medications. Thus, there is an unmet need of developing newer anti-SE drugs. Levetiracetam (LEV) is a widely prescribed anti-epileptic drug that has been reported to be used in SE cases, especially in benzodiazepine-resistant SE or where phenytoin cannot be used due to allergic side-effects. Levetiracetam's non-classical anti-epileptic mechanisms of action, favorable pharmacokinetic profile, general lack of central depressant effects, and lower incidence of drug interactions contribute to its use in SE management. This review will focus on LEV's unique mechanism of action that makes it a viable candidate for SE treatment.", 
    "224": "Excessive weight gain has been identified as a serious metabolic side-effect of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), including olanzapine. While hyperphagia has been suggested to be the main contributor for this side-effect in the short term, reduced energy expenditure, in particular thermogenesis and locomotor activity, has been considered to contribute to the maintenance of heavy weight under long-term SGA treatments. Recent studies have identified metabolically active brown adipose tissues (BAT) in adult humans, suggesting potential clinical significance for the involvement of BAT thermogenesis in SGA-induced weight gain. However, to date there has been little research elucidating the central neuronal pathways affecting BAT thermogenesis or the morphological changes of the BAT. The present study aimed to investigate the role of BAT thermogenesis and locomotor activity in olanzapine-induced weight gain during the prolonged time courses of olanzapine treatment in an established female rat model. Although short- to mid-term olanzapine treatment had no effect on BAT temperature, we observed that long-term olanzapine treatment (from day 18 to 34) induced a significant reduction in BAT temperature, with an acute effect being observed between 45 and 150 min post-treatment in the long-term cohort. Additionally, in the long-term olanzapine group, the reduced BAT temperature was accompanied by decreased UCP1 and PGC-1\u03b1 expressions in the BAT. Moreover, TH mRNA expressions in both hypothalamus and brainstem were also downregulated after mid- to long-term olanzapine treatment. Further, olanzapine led to reduced percentage of brown adipocytes in BAT during mid- to long-term treatments. Finally, locomotor activity was reduced throughout the three treatment cohorts. In summary, our results suggest that the reduction of BAT thermogenesis plays an important role during the long-term of olanzapine-induced weight gain, which was accompanied by an earlier onset of BAT adipocyte morphological changes and biochemical changes in the hypothalamus and the brainstem, while locomotor activity contributes to the entire olanzapine treatment courses.", 
    "225": "Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a usually chronic and relapsing mucocutaneous disease with unknown etiology. Immunosuppressive treatment is sometimes unsatisfactory. We describe four cases of reticular OLP localized on the internal side of cheek, in the territory innervated by sensory free endings of the buccinator nerve, poorly responding to immunosuppressive treatment (topical/systemic corticosteroids, topical cyclosporin). Addition of prazepam 10\u2009mg/day to standard therapy achieved significant improvement and clinical healing in 30-40 days. Because of the complex interplay between the nervous and immune systems, neuroinflammation, acting through conventional axon reflex and/or indirect reflex mechanism involving localized efferent vasodilatory parasympathetic fibers, could have an important pathogenic role in OLP. Such hypothesis could explain, at least partly, the spreading of lesions in OLP primarily triggered (and possibly sustained) by infections, irritants, or autoimmunity. Moreover, neuroinflammation could have a relevant role in OLP related to psychosomatic diseases, where the nervous component is the primary trigger and the main pathogen responsible for the lesions observed. Benzodiazepines modulate neuroinflammation through central, and, possibly, peripheral action. In OLP patients with mild/subclinical psychological conditions, low doses may effectively modulate neuroinflammatory pathways that are not always completely inhibited by immunosuppressive treatment and can contribute to the persistence of inflammation.", 
    "226": "Management of recent-onset schizophrenia (SZ) and schizoaffective disorder (SA) is challenging owing to frequent insufficient response to antipsychotic agents. This study aimed to test the efficacy and safety of the neurosteroid pregnenolone in patients with recent-onset SZ/SA.", 
    "227": "Sixty out- and inpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for SZ/SA, with suboptimal response to antipsychotics were recruited for an 8-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-center add-on trial, that was conducted between 2008 and 2011. Participants were randomized to receive either pregnenolone (50\u2009mg/day) or placebo added on to antipsychotic medications. The primary outcome measures were the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale and the Assessment of Negative Symptoms scores. Secondary outcomes included assessments of functioning, and side-effects.", 
    "228": "Analysis was by linear mixed model. Fifty-two participants (86.7%) completed the trial. Compared to placebo, adjunctive pregnenolone significantly reduced Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale negative symptom scores with moderate effect sizes (d\u2009=\u20090.79). Significant improvement was observed in weeks 6 and 8 of pregnenolone therapy among patients who were not treated with concomitant mood stabilizers (arms\u2009\u00d7\u2009visit\u2009\u00d7\u2009mood stabilizers; P\u2009=\u20090.010). Likewise, pregnenolone significantly reduced Assessment of Negative Symptoms scores compared to placebo (d\u2009=\u20090.57), especially on blunted affect, avolition and anhedonia domain scores. Other symptoms, functioning, and side-effects were not significantly affected by adjunctive pregnenolone. Antipsychotic agents, benzodiazepines and sex did not associate with pregnenolone augmentation. Pregnenolone was well tolerated.", 
    "229": "Thus, add-on pregnenolone reduces the severity of negative symptoms in recent-onset schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, especially among patients who are not treated with concomitant mood stabilizers. Further studies are warranted.", 
    "230": "EMS treatment of status epilepticus improves outcomes, but the benzodiazepine best suited for EMS use is unclear, given potential high environmental temperature exposures.", 
    "231": "To describe the degradation of diazepam, lorazepam, and midazolam as a function of temperature exposure and time over 120 days of storage on active EMS units.", 
    "232": "Study boxes containing vials of diazepam, lorazepam, and midazolam were distributed to 4 active EMS units in each of 2 EMS systems in the southwestern United States during May-August 2011. The boxes logged temperature every minute and were stored in EMS units per local agency policy. Two vials of each drug were removed from each box at 30-day intervals and underwent high-performance liquid chromatography to determine drug concentration. Concentration was analyzed as mean (and 95%CI) percent of initial labeled concentration as a function of time and mean kinetic temperature (MKT).", 
    "233": "192 samples were collected (2 samples of each drug from each of 4 units per city at 4 time-points). After 120 days, the mean relative concentration (95%CI) of diazepam was 97.0% (95.7-98.2%) and of midazolam was 99.0% (97.7-100.2%). Lorazepam experienced modest degradation by 60 days (95.6% [91.6-99.5%]) and substantial degradation at 90 days (90.3% [85.2-95.4%]) and 120 days (86.5% [80.7-92.3%]). Mean MKT was 31.6\u00b0C (95%CI 27.1-36.1). Increasing MKT was associated with greater degradation of lorazepam, but not midazolam or diazepam.", 
    "234": "Midazolam and diazepam experienced minimal degradation throughout 120 days of EMS deployment in high-heat environments. Lorazepam experienced significant degradation over 120 days and appeared especially sensitive to higher MKT exposure.", 
    "235": "Pyrrolo[1,2-\u03b1][1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs) have been described as a novel class of antifungal compounds with activity against dermatophytes and Aspergillus fumigatus. The initial structure-activity relationship showed that compounds with a chlorine substitution at position 7 have a higher activity compared with regioisomers or other substituents.", 
    "236": "The present study evaluated more analogues with a 7-chlorine-substitution in vitro against a broad panel of clinically relevant fungal species. The Microsporum canis model in guinea pigs was used to assess the in vivo efficacy after oral and topical administration.", 
    "237": "IC50 values in the low micromolar range (IC50 0.6-8.0 \u03bcM for dihydro-PBDs; 0.1-0.7 \u03bcM for oxidized PBDs) confirmed the potent and selective in vitro activity of PBDs against dermatophytes, while the activity against A. fumigatus and Candida parapsilosis was slightly lower. For dihydro-PBDs, para-substitution showed superior activity, while oxidized compounds with a meta-substitution performed best. Oxidized Compound O with meta-CF2CH3-substitution showed excellent IC50 values of 0.6 \u03bcM against M. canis, 2.0 \u03bcM against Trichophyton mentagrophytes and 0.7 \u03bcM against Trichophyton rubrum, matching or outperforming the activity of itraconazole (IC50 values of 2.0, 0.4 and 0.6 \u03bcM, respectively). In vivo, topical application of a 0.25% formulation of Compound O gave a lesion reduction of >90% compared with placebo-treated animals. Oral administration of this compound at 20 mg/kg showed superior therapeutic efficacy compared with the reference drug itraconazole.", 
    "238": "In conclusion, PBDs with a chlorine atom at position 7 are very promising antifungal candidates with convincing in vitro and in vivo activity particularly against dermatophytes and should be studied in greater detail to explore their full potential in the treatment of dermatophytoses."
