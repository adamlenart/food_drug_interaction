Inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis ('statins') have been proposed as promising adjunctive anticancer agents to treat HCC, but their mode of action is yet poorly characterized. We additionally investigated the potential benefit of a combination of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligands and statins.", 
    "1": "We analyzed the growth inhibitory effects of PBR ligands, statins, and their combination in two human HCC cell lines. Moreover, we investigated the regulation of cellular cholesterol levels and the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase (HMG-CoAR), the target of statins.", 
    "2": "Statins inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells by inducing apoptosis and G1/S cell cycle arrest. Statin-induced apoptosis was characterized by a breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase activation and nuclear degradation. Furthermore, activation of ERK1/2 was downregulated while p38MAPK was activated. Synergistic growth inhibition was obtained by the combination of the PBR ligand FGIN-1-27 with statins. PBR ligands induced a decrease of HMG-CoAR expression. This downregulation may be responsible for the enhanced sensitivity of HCC cells to statins.",

Over the past 2 years the number of hostel residents overdosing within their rooms in the city of Glasgow was shown to increase. Approximately three-quarters of deaths involved heroin, of which 56% also involved at least one benzodiazepine. This paper demonstrates a dearth in the literature relating to drug misuse amongst the homeless population, highlighting an area in need of address by the appropriate authorities.", 
    "5": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common, but often underdiagnosed, neurological disorder, which is characterised by an imperative urge to move the extremities associated with paraesthesias, worsening of symptoms at rest and in the evening or at night, and, as a consequence, sleep disturbances. RLS affects 1-10% of the population. The aetiology of RLS is unknown, but besides genetic factors the dopaminergic and opioidergic system may play a crucial role and new developments also point to an exciting iron-dopamine connection in the pathophysiology of this burdening disorder. Due to the limited disease-specific knowledge, current treatment strategies are not curative, but nevertheless may produce an effective and lasting relief of symptoms. Although clinically based treatment has focused on levodopa, opioids and benzodiazepines for a long time, evidence-based and clinical guidelines identify dopamine agonists as a first-line treatment for daily restless legs symptoms. These substances are now in the process of registration for this indication. Ropinirole is the first dopamine agonist that has been approved by the FDA in May 2005. In addition, several promising new therapies with nondopamine profiles are under development for RLS.", 
    "6": "In Quebec, benzodiazepines are some of the most extensively used drugs by the elderly. The goal of this study was to identify factors associated with short- and long-term benzodiazepine use among 2,039 elderly persons having participated in the Quebec Health Survey conducted in 1998. Results of the multivariate, multinomial logistic regression showed that a higher number of chronic health problems, a higher number of physicians visited and general practitioners consulted were associated with short- and long-term use of benzodiazepines. Factors specifically associated with long-term use were female gender (OR = 1.84) and the presence of benzodiazepine users in the household (OR = 1.90). In this study, we were unable to show a difference between the two groups of users with regards to the risk factors studied. This result leads us to conclude that prevention of long-term use must be aimed at all new benzodiazepine users.", 
    "7": "The purpose of this updating manuscript is to briefly describe the profile, clinical use and indication of some of the most used sedative and hypnotic compounds. About 2/3 of all hypnotic prescriptions go to chronic use. Benzodiazepines are among the most prescribed drugs worldwide. Women, elderly, psychiatric and medical disease patients are among chronic users of hypnotics. Zolpidem is now the most prescribed hypnotic in most countries. It appears to be safer, compared to benzodazepines, and might be an option for long-term and controlled use (\"as needed\"). Sedative antidepressants are also among the most prescribed drug for sedation in insomnia patients in USA and UK. Sedative effect and use of trazodone, mirtazapine, doxepine, amitryptilin are described. The authors also discuss the use of melatonin and its sleep properties, and the rational use of sedative antipsychotics for chronic insomnia, particularly in psychiatric patients. Finally, some phytotherapeutic compounds are mentioned.", 
    "8": "Health beliefs have been shown to influence a myriad of medical treatment decisions. More recently, the impact of health beliefs on treatment decisions for mental illness has become a focus of study. This study examines the health beliefs and treatment behavior of veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Using standard survey methodology, we assessed beliefs about the cause of PTSD, expected duration and controllability of symptoms, and life consequences of having PTSD. Treatment participation and medication compliance were assessed, as were common treatment correlates, such as patient-provider relationships, dosing frequency, side effect severity, number of prescribed medications, and use of drugs or alcohol to control PTSD symptoms. Explanatory models of PTSD, perceived controllability, and use of benzodiazepines were found to predict psychiatric medication use. Negative life consequences of PTSD were associated with participation in psychotherapy. Assessment of health beliefs may help providers to understand their patients' treatment behavior and to facilitate treatment engagement.", 
    "9": "Diazepam was metabolized to three primary metabolites, 3-hydroxy-diazepam, N-desmethyl-diazepam, and p-hydroxy-diazepam. Our previous studies reported metabolic position-specific inter- or intrastrain differences in diazepam metabolism among Sprague-Dawley, Brown Norway, Dark Agouti, and Wistar rats. Especially, there were marked ( approximately 300 fold) inter- or intrastrain differences in diazepam p-hydroxylation activity at low concentration of substrate. In this study, we investigated the enzyme that catalyzes diazepam p-hydroxylation. The activity toward diazepam p-hydroxylation was inhibited by anti-cytochrome P450 2D (CYP2D) antibody, suggesting that this activity was catalyzed by CYP2D isoforms. Comparing the expression levels of the CYP2D subfamily in liver microsomes from various strains of rats using anti-CYP2D2 antibody, we found that there was a band of protein that was consistent with the phenotype of diazepam p-hydroxylation. N-terminal amino acid sequences of the specific protein exactly corresponded to those of CYP2D3, indicating that CYP2D3 might be involved in diazepam p-hydroxylation. Moreover, using rat CYP2D isoforms expressed in yeast, we tested CYP2Ds to catalyze diazepam p-hydroxylation. CYP2D1 and CYP2D2 practically did not participate in diazepam metabolism. On the other hand, diazepam p-hydroxylation was catalyzed by CYP2D3. CYP2D4 had high activity toward diazepam N-desmethylation, but not p-hydroxylation. In conclusion, the polymorphic expression of CYP2D3 caused the inter- or intrastrain differences in diazepam p-hydroxylation among rat strains or individuals.", 
    "10": "Clinically, benzodiazepines are used in adult populations much more frequently than in children and adolescents. There may be a number of reasons for this disparity including a dearth of well controlled clinical studies and the issue of dependence associated with long term use. However, over a ten year span there has been nearly a three fold increase in the use patterns for these agents in the child population. In open studies much of the literature has indicated potentially useful results, but these findings have not been replicated when more refined methodological studies have been conducted. The lack of encouraging results in these later studies may be attributable to a number of factors such as modest sample sizes and less than optimal patient selection. Nonetheless, with increasing prescriptions being written for these agents it is not clear what is compelling clinicians to use them. In this paper we will review the available literature on benzodiazepine use in the child and adolescent population, focusing primarily on psychiatric applications.", 
    "11": "Medication use is recognized as the least expensive, most cost-effective health care intervention. In older adults this is especially important, as they are the largest consumer of prescription medications. We describe the use of a linked data set including pharmaceutical, medical, and hospital claims to examine pharmaceutical use in the population of older adults and then give several examples of its application. Indicators to describe the population's overall use of medication and the appropriate use of specific medication have been developed. Indicators of appropriate use are characterized using the dispensation of benzodiazepines to older adults.We have found that a significant proportion of new users of benzodiazepines are still prescribed a long-acting version (over 10%), signifying potential inappropriate use. The data are also able to describe some significant outcomes from the use of pharmaceuticals such a death, fracture, and population-based clinical measures where available.", 
    "12": "Time-dependent effects of St. John's wort (SJW) on midazolam 1-hydroxylation were investigated in Wistar rats. Wistar rats treated with SJW (1000 mg/kg/d) for 1, 3, and 7 d were administered midazolam orally at a dose of 10 mg/kg. Oral clearance of midazolam in the SJW treated rats increased time dependently, and was significant after 7 d of treatment with SJW. The midazoram-1-hydroxylation activity in liver microsomes obtained from the SJW treated rats was significantly higher than in the control group. Linear correlation was observed between oral clearance and midazolam-1-hydroxylation activity in the liver microsomes, suggesting that CYP3A induction in liver mainly decreased the midazolam concentration in plasma. Immunoblotting revealed that the protein amount of CYP3A was induced within 3 d of SJW treatment. Since the midazolam-1-hydroxylation activity continuously increased for at least 7 d, the induction of CYP3A by SJW continued to cause interactions with drugs metabolized by CYP3A. It is important for persons receiving SJW for an extended time to consider its interactions with prescription drugs.", 
    "13": "Stress-induced colonic functional changes have been investigated mainly under conditions involving physical stress, like in the restraint stress model. In this study, we established a new stress-induced defecation model involving the placement of Mongolian gerbils in a novel environment (novelty stress) and determined the effects of several drugs on novelty stress-induced fecal pellet output. When animals kept in groups were placed individually in small cages, the fecal pellet output markedly increased, although the upper intestinal transit measured by charcoal method was not changed. The concentration of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone was moderately but significantly increased by the novelty stress. Drugs reportedly effective for stress-induced defecation, like alosetron hydrochloride, atropine sulfate, and trimebutine maleate, inhibited both the novelty stress-induced increase in fecal pellet output and spontaneous defecation. In contrast, TAK-637, a tachykinin NK1-receptor antagonist, and diazepam inhibited the novelty stress induced defecation but did not inhibit spontaneous defecation. The present study indicated that novelty stress increases fecal pellet output without affecting the upper intestinal transit; this model may be useful for evaluating the effects of drugs on stress-stimulated colonic motility.", 
    "14": "The third intracellular loop domain of G protein-coupled receptors regulates their desensitization, internalization, and resensitization. Colorectal and pancreatic cancers, but not the nonmalignant tissue, express a splice variant of the cholecystokinin 2 receptor (CCK2R) called CCK(2i4sv)R that, because of intron 4 retention, contains an additional 69 amino acids within its third intracellular loop domain. This structural alteration is associated with agonist-independent activation of Src kinase (Olszewska-Pazdrak, B., Townsend, C. M., Jr., and Hellmich, M. R. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 40400-40404). The purpose of the study was to determine the roles of intron 4 retention and Src kinase on CCK(2i4sv)R desensitization, internalization, and resensitization. Gastrin1-17 (G17) binds to both CCK2R and CCK(2i4sv)R and induces intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) increases. Agonist-induced increases in [Ca2+]i were used to assess receptor activity. Src kinase activity was inhibited by transducing cells with a retrovirus containing a dominant-negative mutant Src (A430V). The subcellular location of enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged receptors was monitored using laser scanning confocal microscopy. Both receptor variants desensitized at the same rate; however, CCK(2i4sv)R resensitized five times faster than CCK2R. Without agonist, 80% of CCK(2i4sv)R is located in an intracellular compartment. In contrast, 80% of CCK2R was located on the plasma membrane. Treatment with inverse agonist (YM022) or expression of dominant-negative Src blocked the constitutive internalization of CCK(2i4sv)R, resulting in its accumulation on the plasma membrane. Expression of dominant-negative Src slowed the rate of CCK(2i4sv)R resensitization. Inhibition of Src did not affect G17-induced internalization of either receptor variant. Constitutive internalization of CCK(2i4sv)R increases its rate of resensitization by creating an intracellular pool of receptors that can rapidly recycle back to the plasma membrane.",

    "37": "1. This paper reviews the evolution of the family of genes present in mammals and other vertebrates that encode gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A (GABA(A)) receptors, which are the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the central nervous system (CNS). In mammals, 16 different polypeptides (alpha1-alpha6, beta1-beta3, gamma1-gamma3, delta, epsilon, pi, and theta) have been identified, using recombinant DNA techniques, each of which is encoded by a distinct gene. The products of these genes assemble in diverse combinations to form a variety of receptor subtypes that have different sensitivities to a number of clinically relevant compounds, such as the benzodiazepines (BZs). 2. Based on a number of chromosomal mapping techniques, the majority of the GABA(A) receptor genes have been localized, in man, in four clusters on chromosomes 4, 5, 15, and the X. Furthermore, the genes that are present within these clusters have a conserved transcriptional orientation. It has, therefore, been proposed that the clusters arose largely as a consequence of two whole-genome doublings that occurred during chordate evolution, and that the ancestral cluster contained an \"alpha-like,\" a \"beta-like,\" and a \"gamma-like\" subunit gene. 3. Our laboratory has identified two additional GABA(A) receptor polypeptides (the beta4 and gamma4 subunits) in a number of vertebrate species; these do not appear to be present in mammals. We discuss here the relationship of the corresponding genes to other GABA(A) receptor genes, and conclude that their products are orthologous to the mammalian theta and epsilon subunits, respectively. 4. The GABA(A) receptor has a number of binding sites for compounds such as BZs, barbiturates, neurosteroids, and certain volatile anaesthetics. However, the only site at which endogenous compounds are thought to be active is the steroid site; this binds steroids such as certain metabolites of progesterone and deoxycorticosterone, which are synthesized in the periphery and CNS. Since the in vivo functional relevance, if any, of binding sites for other classes of compounds (such as the BZs) is unknown, the significance of differences in primary sequence, between different receptor subunits, is uncertain. We suggest that a possibly more important consequence of gene duplication is that it permitted greater flexibility in the level, pattern and regulation of expression of GABA(A) receptor genes.",

When quetiapine was gradually introduced and other antipsychotics were discontinued, these patients experienced remarkable and sustained improvement of their dystonic symptoms, without loss of psychotic symptom control. The mechanism by which quetiapine may improve tardive dystonia caused by other atypical antipsychotics is unclear. Due to its receptor and pharmacologic profile, quetiapine is the atypical antipsychotic that is most similar to clozapine (without its hematologic side effects), which leads the authors to consider it for the treatment of tardive movement disorders.",

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been suggested as a novel therapeutical approach to the treatment of malignant gliomas. Here, we attempted to enhance hypericin-induced photocytotoxicity and apoptosis by diazepam, a non-selective ligand of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) which seem to play an important role in apoptosis regulation. For the study, we used U-87 MG and U373 MG glioma cell lines and primary cultures of GBM cells prepared from peroperatively obtained tumor specimens. The patients included 7 histologically confirmed GBMs. Colorimetric MTT assay was employed to study the photocytotoxic effects of hypericin and diazepam. Flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis and assess the proapoptotic effects of diazepam. We found that hypericin upon photoactivation exerts strong cytotoxic effects against U-87 MG and U373 MG cells as well as primary GBM cell cultures. No cytotoxic effect of hypericin was observed under dark conditions. Diazepam inhibited cell growth in U-87 MG cells and primary cultures whereas proliferation of U373 MG cells remained unaffected. When hypericin was combined with diazepam, photocytotoxicity was increased in U-87 MG cells and primary cultures unlike U373 MG cells. Flow cytometric analysis revealed photoactivated hypericin-induced apoptosis in both cell lines. Apoptosis was significantly enhanced by diazepam in U-87 MG cells. However, no such effect was observed in U373 MG cells. In the present study, we showed that photocytotoxic effect of hypericin in glioma cells can be potentiated by diazepam. This effect is underlied by the ability of diazepam to facilitate hypericin-induced apoptosis.

These drugs increased the number of cells bearing neurites, the length of primary neurites, and the size of the cell body of NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. In addition, the drugs induced sprouting of neurite-like processes in PC12 cells in the absence of NGF. Olanzapine, quetiapine, and clozapine enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK in combination with NGF, and specific inhibitors of these pathways attenuated these effects. Pretreatment of cells overnight with pertussis toxin had no effect on NGF-induced differentiation but significantly decreased the effects of the antipsychotic drugs on neurite outgrowth, suggesting that Gi/Go-coupled receptors are involved in the response to drug. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of the second-generation drugs might suggest new therapeutic targets for enhancement of neurite outgrowth.",

Seventy male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly subdivided into four groups, which were treated with clozapine, haloperidol, diazepam or a vehicle solution (5% sucrose solution). Oral drug treatment was achieved by training the rats to drink the drug of choice mixed with five percent sucrose or vehicle solution from a syringe. Within 3-4 weeks the haloperidol group developed vacuous chewing movement, which did not disappear with discontinuation of the drug. Significant weight gain was observed for all drug groups in relation to the control group, whereas only the diazepam group showed a significant increase in response latency on the disengage test of sensorimotor function, which disappeared with drug withdrawal. A novel means of testing the motivational status showed that all drug-treated groups engaged in eating chocolate before grooming (t=11.69, p<0.001), whereas the control group showed no specific tendency towards either task. Furthermore, there was a significant delay in grooming for the haloperidol group compared to the other drug groups and controls.

Although benzodiazepines are effective against these seizures, alternative anticonvulsant drugs may possess greater efficacy and fewer side-effects. We have investigated in the guinea-pig hippocampal slice preparation the ability of a series of anticonvulsants to suppress epileptiform bursting induced by the irreversible organophosphate anticholinesterase, soman (100 nM). Carbamazepine (300 microM), phenytoin (100 microM), topiramate (100-300 microM) and retigabine (1-30 microM) reduced the frequency of bursting but only carbamazepine and phenytoin induced a concurrent reduction in burst duration. Felbamate (100-500 microM) and clomethiazole (100-300 microM) had no effect on burst frequency but decreased burst duration. Clozapine (3-30 microM) reduced the frequency but did not influence burst duration. Levetiracetam (100-300 microM) and gabapentin (100-300 microM) were without effect. These data suggest that several compounds, in particular clomethiazole, clozapine, felbamate, topiramate and retigabine, merit further evaluation as possible treatments for organophosphate poisoning.",

Alcohol (either alone or with an illicit and/or medicinal drug) was detected in 470 of all cases (46%). Illicit drugs were detected in 344 cases (34%), with cannabis being the most commonly detected (26% of cases), followed by cocaine (11%). In 21 cases (2%), a sedative or disinhibiting drug was detected which had not been admitted and could therefore be an instance of deliberate spiking. This included three cases in which complainants were allegedly given Ecstasy (MDMA) without their knowledge. Other drugs detected included gammahydroxybutyrate (GHB) and the benzodiazepine drugs diazepam and temazepam.

    "85": "Despite being a considerable problem in neurological practice and responsible for one-third of seizure-related admissions, there is little consensus as to the optimal investigation and management of alcohol-related seizures. The final literature search was undertaken in September 2004. Consensus recommendations are given graded according to the EFNS guidance regulations. To support the history taking, use of a structured questionnaire is recommended. When the drinking history is inconclusive, elevated values of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin and/or gammaglutamyl transferase can support a clinical suspicion. A first epileptic seizure should prompt neuroimaging (CT or MRI). Before starting any carbohydrate containing fluids or food, patients presenting with suspected alcohol overuse should be given prophylactic thiamine parenterally. After an alcohol withdrawal seizure (AWS), the patient should be observed in hospital for at least 24 h and the severity of withdrawal symptoms needs to be followed. For patients with no history of withdrawal seizures and mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms, routine seizure preventive treatment is not necessary. Generally, benzodiazepines are efficacious and safe for primary and secondary seizure prevention; diazepam or, if available, lorazepam, is recommended. The efficacy of other drugs is insufficiently documented. Concerning long-term recommendations for non-alcohol dependent patients with partial epilepsy and controlled seizures, small amounts of alcohol may be safe. Alcohol-related seizures require particular attention both in the diagnostic work-up and treatment. Benzodiazepines should be chosen for the treatment and prevention of recurrent AWS.",

All patients were aged 18 year and older and were randomized to either sertraline or alprazolam.

Besides current neurobiological theories, a very important hypothesis about behavioral inhibition has been represented as a predisposition of social phobia. The cognitive-behavioral theories of social phobia are dominant among psychological theories. The integrative concept of social phobia is the most realistic approach to this disorder and the bridge between biological and psychological theories. The interaction between biological and psychological etiological factors is represented through different therapeutical approaches to social phobia. Therapy of social phobia is integrative and involves different therapeutical modalities in different phases of therapy. In integrative psychotherapy, we use cognitive-behavioral therapy, dynamic oriented supportive psychotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy and phenomenological-existential psychotherapy. The cognitive-behavioral therapy yields the best results. The medicaments in use are the following: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, high-potency benzodiazepines, new antiepileptic drugs and rarely beta-blockers. The combination of integrative psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy is the most optimal therapeutic approach to social phobia. This integrative and to patient adapted treatment will produce the best results in management of children's and adolescent's social phobia.", 
    "88": "Neurophysiologic abnormalities are frequently seen in organic acidemias, but knowledge of the specific changes in the different types of organic acidemias is lacking. We studied electroencephalogram (EEG), visual evoked potential (VEP) and brain-stem auditory evoked response (BAER) in seven children with glutaric aciduria type I (GA1) to assess the neurophysiologic features in this rare inborn error of metabolism. Age at the time of the diagnosis ranged between 3 months and 36 months. Age at the time of neurophysiologic evaluation ranged between 11 months and 36 months. At the time of neurophysiologic evaluation, severe global developmental delay was seen in four patients, dystonia in four patients, motor delay in two patients, and axial hypotonia in two patients; macrocephaly, spasticity, moderate mental retardation and borderline intelligence were each seen in one patient. One patient had autistic features characterized by lack of language and social skills, poor eye contact and stereotypical behavior. Three of seven patients showed abnormal EEG findings. Two patients showed asymmetry with intermittent occipital delta slowing in one hemisphere. This finding probably indicates underlying cerebral dysfunction, and is not a specific feature. However, it suggests that these patients may develop abnormal EEG features during the course of the disease, and thus a baseline EEG may be useful for comparison over time. One patient showed high amplitude bursts of beta in the occipital regions with left predominance while on clonazepam and baclofen. We believe this finding was due to medication effect, and that what we observed was an exaggarated response to benzodiazepine. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. VEP and BAER were available in four patients, and we found abnormalities in three of them. Neurophysiologic evaluation may be helpful in patients with GA1 as in other types of organic acidemias to help detect subtle changes that are not reflected by neurological examination or neuroimaging studies, and it may guide future treatment plans. Detailed neurophysiologic analysis in a large series of GA1 may yield further information regarding the extent of cerebral dysfunction.", 
    "89": "Steinert's myotonic dystrophy is a genetically conditioned systemic disease with symptoms related to circulatory, respiratory, muscular, endocrine and mental disturbances. Most if not all of these patients develop lens opacification as a presenting symptom and need to undergo cataract surgery. Nevertheless, selection of a type of anaesthesia can arise to a problem in these patients because local anaesthesia can be insufficient whereas general endotracheal anaesthesia is known, to potentially provoke serious postoperative complications. In this contribution we discuss problems we faced during cataract surgery in three siblings affected by Steinert's myotonic dystrophy. Two of them were operated on in local anaesthesia and developed intraoperative problems related to sudden increase of intraocular pressure, bleeding and vitreous efflux. After receiving a thorough examination the youngest of the three was operated on under short acting general intravenous anaesthesia (propofol and/or benzodiazepines, piperidine derived opioids, non-polarizing paralytics). We conclude that short acting general intravenous anaesthesia can help in avoiding both, local ocular complications during surgery and problems in the postoperative period.", 
    "90": "It has been shown that anesthetics have effects of cardiac preconditioning. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) function as molecular chaperone. Among them, HSP27, a low-molecular-weight HSP, abundantly exist in heart. However, the relationship between anesthetics and HSP27 in heart is not yet clarified. We investigated whether thrombin induces or phosphorylates HSP27 in primary cultured mouse myocytes and the effect of midazolam on the thrombin-stimulated HSP27 phosphorylation and the mechanism behind it. Thrombin time dependently phosphorylated HSP27 at Ser-15 and Ser-85 while having no effect on the levels of HSP27. Midazolam markedly suppressed the thrombin-induced phosphorylation of HSP27 at both Ser-15 and Ser-85. Thrombin induced the phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAP kinase and p38 MAP kinase without affecting stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase. In addition, midazolam attenuated the phosphorylation of thrombin-induced p38 MAP kinase but not that of p44/p42 MAP kinase. SB203580 and PD169316, inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase, suppressed the thrombin-induced phosphorylation of HSP27 at both Ser-15 and Ser-85. These results strongly suggest that thrombin induces the HSP27 phosphorylation at least through the p38 MAP kinase activation in cardiac myocytes and that midazolam inhibits the thrombin-induced HSP27 phosphorylation via suppression of p38 MAP kinase activation.", 
    "91": "The neuropharmacological profile of the atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine, is consistent with a potentially useful medication for cocaine abuse. The present study utilized an i.v. drug self-administration paradigm in nonhuman primates to obtain definitive evidence regarding the effectiveness of olanzapine to modulate the reinforcing effects of cocaine. The effects of olanzapine were compared directly to those of the neuroleptic, haloperidol. Rhesus monkeys (n=7) were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.03-0.3 mg/kg/injection) under a second-order, fixed-interval 600-s schedule with fixed ratio 20 components. Experimental sessions comprised five consecutive fixed intervals, each followed by a 1-min timeout. In drug-interaction experiments, a single dose of olanzapine (0.03-0.3 mg/kg) or haloperidol (0.01-0.03 mg/kg) was administered i.v. 15 min presession for at least three consecutive sessions. In drug-substitution experiments, different doses of olanzapine (0.01-0.1 mg/kg/injection) were substituted for cocaine until responding stabilized. Olanzapine caused dose-related decreases in cocaine self-administration at pretreatment doses that had no overt behavioral effects indicative of sedation. A dose of 0.1 mg/kg eliminated cocaine self-administration in all subjects. In contrast, doses of haloperidol that suppressed cocaine self-administration induced marked sedation and catalepsy. Olanzapine failed to maintain self-administration behavior above saline extinction levels over a range of unit doses. In vivo microdialysis experiments in a second group of awake rhesus monkeys (n=3) confirmed previous reports in rodents that olanzapine effectively increases extracellular dopamine in ventral striatum. The dose of olanzapine that markedly suppressed cocaine self-administration behavior increased dopamine to approximately 190% of control values. Lastly, pretreatment with fluoxetine had no systematic effect on olanzapine-induced increases in striatal dopamine. The results indicate that olanzapine can effectively suppress cocaine self-administration behavior in nonhuman primates at doses that enhance dopamine release but do not maintain drug self-administration.", 
    "92": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (pBR) ligand, PK11195, promotes mitochondrial apoptosis and blocks P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-mediated drug efflux to chemosensitize cancer cells at least as well or better than the Pgp modulator, cyclosporine A (CSA). We now show that PK11195 broadly inhibits adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in hematologic cancer cell lines and primary leukemia-cell samples, including multidrug resistance protein (MRP), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and/or Pgp. Ectopic expression models confirmed that pBR can directly mediate chemosensitizing by PK11195, presumably via mitochondrial activities, but showed that pBR expression is unnecessary to PK11195-mediated efflux inhibition. PK11195 binds plasma-membrane sites in Pgp-expressing cells, stimulates Pgp-associated adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity, and causes conformational changes in Pgp, suggesting that PK11195 modulates Pgp-mediated efflux by direct transporter interaction(s). PK11195 and CSA bind noncompetitively in Pgp-expressing cells, indicating that PK11195 interacts with Pgp at sites that are distinct from CSA-binding sites. Importantly, PK11195 concentrations that were effective in these in vitro assays can be safely achieved in patients. Because PK11195 promotes chemotherapy-induced apoptosis by a pBR-dependent mitochondrial mechanism and broadly blocks drug efflux by an apparently pBR-independent, ABC transporter-dependent mechanism, PK11195 may be a useful clinical chemosensitizer in cancer patients.",

In fact, when forepaws licking was no longer observed, the rearing was clearly anticipated (7 s instead of 15 s) as well as jumping (24 s instead of 55 s). These modifications of avoidance strategies as well as their latencies were still observed even 24 days after the first exposure. Avoidance responses were prevented by morphine or haloperidol injected prior to the first exposure, but not with scopolamine or diazepam. These modifications were not affected in mice injected with morphine or submitted to either a supramaximal electroshock or to ether anesthesia delivered immediately after the first hot plate exposure. Among the various known types of memory, these modifications could be linked to procedural memory.", 
    "94": "Detailed knowledge of the anatomical distribution of different GABA(A) receptor subunits is crucial for understanding the physiological actions of GABA in individual brain areas and for developing drugs acting through the individual GABA receptor subtypes. Since the amygdala is a key brain structure in the processing of emotional information with distinct functions in each nucleus, GABA(A) receptors in the amygdala are an important target of treatment for emotional disorders. In this study, we analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR the expression levels of all GABA(A) receptor subunits in distinct nuclei of the amygdala, the central (Ce) and the lateral/basolateral (LA/BLA) amygdala. We found the strongest expression of the gamma(2) subunit mRNA in both the Ce and LA/BLA, modest expressions of alpha(1), alpha(2) and alpha(3) mRNAs in the LA/BLA and alpha(2) and gamma(1) mRNAs in the Ce, and weak expressions of alpha(6), rho(2) and rho(3) mRNAs in both regions. We further revealed the significantly different expressions of alpha(1), alpha(3), alpha(5), gamma(1), gamma(2), delta, epsilon and theta subunit mRNAs in the Ce and LA/BLA. Differences in the expression levels of GABA(A) receptor subunits suggest different sensitivity to a variety of drugs including benzodiazepines and anesthetics in amygdala nuclei with distinct functions.",

Although studies suggest that several psychotropic medications are sometimes useful for these behavioral problems, response is variable and adverse effects often limit treatment. Theoretical considerations suggest that increasing estrogenic activity or reducing androgenic activity could reduce agitation and aggression in dementia. Estrogen has been reported helpful for these symptoms, but adverse effects are problematic. Chronic administration of the synthetic gonadotropin (luteinising hormone) releasing hormone analogue, goserelin, reduces testosterone activity. Here we describe the apparently sustained elimination of previously treatment-resistant agitation and aggression with goserelin treatment in a 78-year-old male nursing-home resident with Alzheimer's disease.",

    "105": "Cardiac thrombosis, one of the causes of sudden death throughout the world, plays a principal role in several cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction and stroke in humans. Data from studies of induction of chemical thrombosis in rodents help to identify substances in our environment that may contribute to cardiac thrombosis. Results for more than 500 chemicals tested in rodents in 2-year bioassays have been published as Technical Reports of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) http://ntp-server.niehs.nih.gov/index. We evaluated atrial thrombosis induced by these chemical exposures and compared it to similarly induced lesions reported in the literature. Spontaneous rates of cardiac thrombosis were determined for control Fischer 344 rats and B6C3F1 mice: 0% in rats and mice in 90-day studies and, in 2-year studies, 0.7% in both genders of mice, 4% in male rats, and 1% in female rats. Incidences of atrial thrombosis were increased in high-dosed groups involving 13 compounds (incidence rate: 20-100%): 2-butoxyethanol, C.I. Direct Blue 15, bis(2-chloroethoxy)methane, diazoaminobenzene, diethanolamine, 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine dihydrochloride, hexachloroethane, isobutene, methyleugenol, oxazepam, C.I. Pigment Red 23, C.I. Acid Red 114, and 4,4'-thiobis(6-t-butyl-m-cresol). The main localization of spontaneously occurring and chemically induced thromboses occurred in the left atrium. The literature survey suggested that chemical-induced atrial thrombosis might be closely related to myocardial injury, endothelial injury, circulatory stasis, hypercoagulability, and impaired atrial mechanical activity, such as atrial fibrillation, which could cause stasis of blood within the left atrial appendage, contributing to left atrial thrombosis.

    "107": "This study was conducted to determine the effect of zolpidem (ZOL) 10 mg orally on the sleep architecture and the next-morning residual effect in patients with non-organic insomnia (ICD-10) as compared to the effect of brotizolam (BTM) 0.25 mg orally, a widely used short-acting benzodiazepine (BZD) hypnotic in Japan, in a randomized, crossover comparative study. Fourteen patients with non-organic insomnia (3 males and 11 females; mean age of 54.9+/-S.D. 8.9 years). First three nights with placebo, middle three nights with either ZOL 10 mg or BTM 0.25 mg, and last three nights again with placebo in each session (a total of two sessions). Primary endpoints were polysomnography findings of sleep stages, sleep parameters, and sleep latency (SL) in the morning to examine calculable sleepiness as a residual effect. Secondary endpoint was sleep quality assessed by self-assessment questionnaire. At 150 min after Tmax, both ZOL and BTM significantly increased stage 2 (S2), and ZOL showed significantly longer slow wave sleep (SWS; stage 3+4) as compared to BTM. Stage wake was significantly increased by ZOL at the first withdrawal night and by BTM at the second withdrawal night. ZOL did not affect SL after rising, whereas BTM showed significantly shorter SL. Both drugs reduced the number of nocturnal awakenings and improved subjective sleep quality. The common adverse drug reaction (ADR) was sleepiness (3 patients) in each treatment. All events were mild. No serious adverse events occurred. ZOL is as effective as BTM in improving subjective sleep quality in patients with psychophysiological insomnia (PPI). ZOL has advantages over BTM in having a unique profile of increasing SWS with less next-morning residual effect.", 
    "108": "A novel recombinant human hepatic cell line, CYP3A4- and glutamine synthetase (GS, an enzyme which converts ammonium ion and glutamate to glutamine)-introduced HepG2 (HepG2-GS-CYP3A4), was established. Its usefulness in a large-scale culture with a circulatory bioreactor in vitro and in dog models of ischemic hepatic failure with acute diazepam (DZP, a substrate of CYP3A4) overdosage was further examined. HepG2-GS-CYP3A4 expressed about 9 times larger amounts of CYP3A4 protein than a control. After incubation with HepG2-GS-3A4 cells in a circulatory bioreactor for 24 h, ammonia and DZP concentrations in the culture medium significantly decreased by about 40%. Furthermore, this system improved the survival time and decreased serum concentrations of DZP, ammonia, and transaminase in dogs with ischemic hepatic failure plus acute DZP overdosage. The mean survival time with bioreactor with HepG2-GS-3A4 was 42.7 +/- 3.6 h, which was significantly longer than that without reactor, with reactor (no cells), and with HepG2-GS (23.4 +/- 2.8, 22.1 +/- 2.4, and 31 +/- 3.7 h, respectively). Therefore, it is concluded that this bioartificial liver could be a good tool for the treatment of dogs with hepatic failure and that it could potentially be a bridging procedure to liver transplantation.", 
    "109": "Antipsychotics are the keystone in schizophrenia treatment. Although the benefits of the new generation of antipsychotics has been demonstrated over the last decade, the issues of patient compliance and higher purchasing price of atypical antipsychotics remain unresolved. Risperidone is the only atypical antipsychotic agent with long-acting formulation. Long-acting risperidone is a water-based injection and it has been associated with a low level of pain. The aim of the present study was to test whether an improvement in compliance with the use of a long-acting risperidone, compared with olanzapine and depot haloperidol, can increase the effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness indexes. An economic comparison model with decision tree, rather than a prospective design with real clinical drug trial, was applied. The unit cost for each medical procedure was obtained from the claimed-database of the Bureau of National Health Insurance in Taiwan. An executive committee simulated the incidence of extrapyramidal side-effects and proposed a therapeutic model for each strategy based on a literature review. The probabilities of treatment response of different agents and those of different mental health states were estimated by the executive committee and 10 senior psychiatrists who were randomly selected. Sensitivity analysis was performed for drug cost-effectiveness and compliance improvement for using long-acting risperidone. The results showed that long-acting risperidone is more cost-effective than either olanzapine or depot haloperidol for treating schizophrenia patients whose conditions are stable and whose illness duration ranges from 1 to 5 years. The comparison model with the Kaplan-Meier decision tree may serve as an alternative to prospectively designed studies for cost-effectiveness of atypical antipsychotics.", 
    "110": "Mood disorders in pregnancy may have a negative effect on self care and pregnancy outcome that affects the mother directly and the child indirectly. Thus, some women may require pharmacological treatment. Pharmacotherapy of mood disorders during pregnancy implies specific considerations. This paper presents an updated review of available studies on the treatment of mood disorders and present knowledge on teratogenicity, neonatal effects and long-term neurobehavioural effects for the different psychotropic drugs, including treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), other antidepressants, benzodiazepines, lithium, carbamazepine/valproic acid, lamotrigine and novel antipsychotics. However, the existing knowledge on the use of antidepressants and mood stabilising agents during pregnancy is hampered by a lack of results from randomised controlled trials.SSRIs and TCAs have not been associated with an increased risk of major malformations, but poor neonatal adaptation has been described. Benzodiazepines used in the first trimester have been associated with orofacial clefts. Mood stabilisers such as lithium, carbamazepine and valproic acid (sodium valproate) are associated with an increased risk of fetal malformations. Both benzodiazepines and lithium may cause adaptation problems in the newborn. In utero exposure to novel antipsychotics has not been associated with congenital malformations; however, the data are still limited. The knowledge about long-term neurobehavioural effects in the offspring is still limited for all agents and requires further investigation. Possible adverse effects of fetal exposure must be balanced against the adverse effects of an untreated maternal mood disorder.", 
    "111": "The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of intramuscular and intranasal midazolam used as a premedication before intravenous conscious sedation. Twenty-three children who were scheduled to receive dental treatment under intravenous sedation participated. The patients ranged in age from 2 to 9 years (mean age, 5.13 years) and were randomly assigned to receive a dose of 0.2 mg/kg of midazolam premedication via either intramuscular or intranasal administration. All patients received 50% nitrous oxide and 50% oxygen inhalation sedation and local anesthetic (0.2 mL of 4% prilocaine hydrochloride) before venipuncture. The sedation level, movement, and crying were evaluated at the following time points: 10 minutes after drug administration and at the times of parental separation, passive papoose board restraint, nitrous oxide nasal hood placement, local anesthetic administration, and initial venipuncture attempt. Mean ratings for the behavioral parameters of sedation level, degree of movement, and degree of crying were consistently higher but not significant in the intramuscular midazolam group at all 6 assessment points. Intramuscular midazolam was found to be statistically more effective in providing a better sedation level and less movement at the time of venipuncture than intranasal administration. Our findings indicate a tendency for intramuscular midazolam to be more effective as a premedication before intravenous sedation.", 
    "112": "More than a decade has passed since it was unintentionally discovered that grapefruit juice interacts with certain drugs. The coadministration of these drugs with grapefruit juice can markedly elevate drug bioavailability, and can alter pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of the drug. The predominant mechanism for this interaction is the inhibition of cytochrome P-450 3A4 in the small intestine, resulting in a significant reduction of drug presystemic metabolism. An additional mechanism is the inhibition of P-glycoprotein, a transporter that carries drug from the enterocyte back to the gut lumen, resulting in a further increase in the fraction of drug absorbed. Some calcium channel antagonists, benzodiazepines, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and cyclosporine are the most affected drugs. A single exposure to one glass of the grapefruit juice can usually produce the maximal magnitude of the interaction. The data available so far, concerning this interaction and its clinical implications, are reviewed in this article. It is likely that more information regarding this interaction will accumulate in the future, and awareness of such is necessary for achieving optimal drug therapy.", 
    "113": "Enhanced anxiety state is accompanied by limitation of the color-discrimination function of retina in young humans. Chronic administration of tofisopam (grandaxin) or tinctura leonuri decreased anxiety and significantly improved the color discrimination function of retina with respect to all four colors studied. It is suggested that this improvement is related to the drug action upon the GABAergic processes both in the retina and in the related cerebral structures.", 
    "114": "The effect of N-(2-adamantyl)-N-(p-bromophenyl)amine (ladasten) on the behavior of MR and MNRA inbred rats with different emotional-stress reaction (ESR) phenotypes was studied in the conventional open-field test. Ladasten (30 mg/kg, i.p.) produced anxiolytic effect in MR rates, while not influencing MNRA animals. At the same time, a model stress induced disorder in the regulation of 3 H-diazepam binding to the benzodiazepine site of GABA(A) receptor in MR (but not in MNRA) rats. Ladasten administered in the anxiolytic dose prevented stress-induced changes in reception at this site.", 
    "115": "Pavlovian feature negative discriminations have been widely used to understand inhibitory conditioning processes using exteroceptive stimuli. Comparatively little is known about inhibitory conditioning processes using a drug state as a negative feature. A negative feature signals that presentation of a conditional stimulus (CS) will not be paired with an unconditioned stimulus.", 
    "116": "The present research examined whether nicotine served as a negative feature and started characterizing its properties.", 
    "117": "In acquisition, rats received intermixed saline and nicotine (0.4 mg/kg, base) sessions. On saline sessions, a 15-s light CS was paired with 4-s access to sucrose; the CS was presented on nicotine sessions, but sucrose was withheld. The discrimination was acquired with more goal tracking during the CS on saline sessions. Nicotine's inhibition of this conditioned response (CR) was sensitive to nicotine dose (ED50=0.225) and injection to testing interval (CR returned at 200 min). Mecamylamine pretreatment, but not hexamethonium, produced a loss of inhibitory control by nicotine suggesting a role for central nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Amphetamine, bupropion, arecoline, and chlordiazepoxide, but not caffeine, substituted for the nicotine feature. However, in locomotor tests, amphetamine and bupropion increased activity; arecoline and chlordiazepoxide decreased activity. For this reason, the motor effects of these ligands could not be dissociated from substitution via shared stimulus properties.", 
    "118": "This feature negative task provides a preclinical model for studying how drug states inhibit responding, although identifying the process(es) mediating CR inhibition will require further research.", 
    "119": "SJG-136 is a novel pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer analogue that acts as a minor-groove interstrand DNA cross-linking agent. The present study investigated the impact of ABCB1 (mdr-1) expression on the activity of SJG-136 using both in vitro and in vivo systems. SJG-136 was highly potent in the colon cancer cell lines HCT-116, HT-29 and SW620 (IC50 0.1-0.3 nM). However, HCT-8 and HCT-15 cells expressing significant levels of mdr-1 were less sensitive (IC50 2.3 and 3.7 nM, respectively) using a SRB assay. The cytotoxicity was increased in HCT-15 and A2780(AD) in presence of 5 microg/ml verapamil. Mdr-1 mRNA expression was determined by qRT-PCR and correlated to SJG-136 IC50s (r2=0.86, P=0.0001). Isogenic 3T3 cells expressing mdr-1 cDNA (3T3 pHamdr-1) were less sensitive to SJG-136 than the parental 3T3 cells (IC50 208 and 6.3 nM, respectively). Finally, SJG-136 (120 microg/kg/d dx5) was highly active against A2780 xenografts (SGD=275) but not A2780(AD) xenografts (SGD=67).", 
    "120": "The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is a protein predominantly located in the mitochondrial outer membrane that plays an important role in the regulation of cell survival and proliferation. Previous studies have shown an enhanced expression of PBR in the regenerating sciatic nerve, suggesting that this protein may be involved in the regenerative response. The rat sciatic nerve suffers important structural alterations with aging, including alterations in the morphology of myelin sheaths and a decrease in the number of myelinated fibers. In this study, we have assessed the effect of two PBR ligands, Ro5-4864 and PK-11195, to determine whether PBR may influence aging-associated morphological changes in the sciatic nerve. The treatment of 23-month-old, Sprague-Dawley male rats for 1 month with Ro5-4864 significantly reduced the percentage of fibers with myelin decompaction and increased the total number of myelinated fibers. In contrast, PK-11195, a PBR ligand that binds to a different site than Ro5-4864 in the PBR molecule, did not significantly affect any of the parameters analyzed. These findings support the potential role of PBR ligands to prevent aging-associated peripheral nerve degeneration.", 
    "121": "We examined the behavioral pharmacological properties of six benzodiazepine (omega) receptor ligands including brotizoram, nitrazepam, quazepam, rilmazafone, zolpidem and zopiclone and the binding of these drugs with omega receptor subtypes. Behavioral tests were performed at the time of the maximal effects induced by each drug following its oral administration to mice. All of these drugs dose-dependently induced impairment of motor coordination as rotarod performance and potentiation of thiopental-induced anesthesia as hypnotic effect. The hypnotic effects of rilmazafone, whose major metabolites were bound to both omega1 and omega2 receptors with high affinity, and omega1 selective quazepam were about 20 times more effective than the induction of motor impairments when compared with ED50 values. However, there was no difference between the ED50 values of omega1 selective zolpidem alone in these two tests. An antianxiety efficacy of zolpidem was relatively weak unlike that of other drugs in the elevated plus-maze. It has been reported that omega2, but not omega1, receptors are associated with motor impairment and anxiolytic effect. The weak anxiolytic effect of zolpidem supports the previous hypothesis. However, the strong motor incoordination of zolpidem suggests that not only omega2 but also omega1 receptors are related to motor impairment unlike the previous hypothesis.",

    "123": "This 24-hours point prevalence study was done at The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. By convenient random sampling, 208 inpatients were interviewed. Patients' files were also studied to record the drugs administered. Data was entered into questionnaires and analyzed by SPSS 10.0.", 
    "124": "The point prevalence of the benzodiazepines was 21.2%. It was higher among males than females and among surgical than non-surgical patients. Midazolam was the most commonly used benzodiazepine, followed by Alprazolam and Lorazepam. Pre-anesthesia and psychiatric symptoms were the two most common indications. Oral route was used in 84% patients for drug administration and mean Valium equivalent dosage was 4.86 mg/day. Mean length of prescription was 3 days. Longer duration of hospitalization was a significant predictor of the requirement of benzodiazepine prescription (p-value = 0.020).", 
    "125": "Prescription pattern of benzodiazepines at a tertiary care university hospital is similar to that reported in the developed countries through monitoring at various levels by physicians, clinical pharmacist and nursing staff. Data regarding the prescription pattern of benzodiazepines is scarce, and it needs to be expanded to formulate clear guidelines regarding their prescription.", 
    "126": "To investigate the effect of diazepam and modafinil on acute hepatic failure in mice.", 
    "127": "Acute liver failure was induced in male Kunming strain mice by enterocoelia injecting the mice with D-GalN and LPS . The mice in the treatment groups were given corresponding drug 2 h before the administration of D-GalN and LPS, and the mice in the control group were given the same dose of distilled water. The 24-hour survival rate, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were compared. Serum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1 and the levels of SOD, MDA, GR, GSH, NO and NOS in the liver were determined.", 
    "128": "Treatment with diazepam increased the survival rate and improved liver histological feature. Diazepam inhibited the serum levels of ALT, AST, TNF-alpha and IL-1, and reduced levels of MDA, NO and NOS and increased levels of GR and SOD in the liver. Modafinil decreased liver histological feature, increased the serum levels of ALT, AST, TNF-alpha and IL-1, increased level of MDA, and inhabited levels of SOD and GR in the liver.", 
    "129": "Treatment with diazepam may suppress the D-GalN/LPS-induced acute hepatic failure and modafinil may facilitate the acute hepatic failure.", 
    "130": "To explore the safety and the efficacy of two-stage administration sedation method (with propofol plus midazolam) in the analgesia gastroscopy for hypoxia predisposed patients.", 
    "131": "Sixty-four hypoxia predisposed patients (with snore or expectoration) were divided into two groups and received sedation respectively with two-stage administration method and routine continuum administration method before gastroscopy. We analyzed the alteration of SBP, DBP, SpO2, sedation level, the degree of pharyngeal malaise, recovery time, dose of propofol,the lethe degree of upset, and procedure of gastroscopy to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of the two methods in the analgesia gastroscopy for hypoxia predisposed patients.", 
    "132": "Compared with routine continuum administration sedation method, two-stage administration sedation method had little influence on SpO2, so it reduced the accident of respiratory arrest (P < 0.01). The gastroscopy could be achieved at the lower sedation level with two stage administration method (P <0.01), so that the recovery time was shortened (P < 0.01). The degree of pharyngeal malaise in the patients with two-stage administration sedation method was higher than that of patients with routine continuum administrationsedation method (P < 0.01), and the dose of propofol used for sedation decreased (P < 0.01). While the lethe degree of gastroscopy upset and alteration of SBP, DBP were rated similarly in both groups (P > 0.05), and the lethe degree of gastroscopy procedure in two-stage administration method group was significantly lower than that of routine continuum adminis- tration method group (P <0.01).", 
    "133": "The two-stage administration sedation method is a new effective and safe sedation method for gastroscopy in the hypoxia predisposed patients.", 
    "134": "Progress has been made in understanding the neural basis of subjective tinnitus (ST); however, this has not, as yet, translated into many new drug treatments. One reason for this is that realistic behavioral models of ST in animals have been developed only recently, and are still not widely used. Nonetheless, some significant pharmacological advances have been made. At present, there is evidence to support the efficacy of transtympanic gentamicin administration in the treatment of tinnitus associated with Meniere's disease; there is also some evidence to support the efficacy of intratympanic steroid and lidocaine application in the management of ST. Although benzodiazepines and anti-epileptic drugs appear to be effective in many cases of this condition, there is concern about their adverse side effect profile. Based on well-controlled clinical trials, vasodilators such as misoprostol, and histamine receptor ligands should be further investigated. Finally, given the evidence that ST is a form of sensory epilepsy, new antiepileptic drugs should be tested for potential efficacy as they are developed; such drugs may include novel N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, as well as cannabinoids.", 
    "135": "Mirtazapine pharmacokinetic (PK) data from patients on long-term treatment for major depression have never been investigated. For this reason, in a large naturalistic outpatient study (prospective, multicenter, open-labeled, and noncomparative) conducted in Sweden in the period 2000-2002, one of the main objectives was to outline the inter- as well as intraindividual PK variance of mirtazapine and demethylmirtazapine serum concentrations in a patient cohort treated up to 6 (optionally 12) months. A total of 192 male and female outpatients aged 18 years or older were included. Serum samples of mirtazapine and demethylmirtazapine were collected, by the means of therapeutic drug monitoring, at weeks 1, 4, 8, and 24 (52). Altogether 683 serum samples were analyzed. A pronounced interindividual variability of mirtazapine and demethylmirtazapine, and the demethylmirtazapine/mirtazapine ratio was seen. The coefficient of variation was about 38%, 33%, and 36%, respectively. The intraindividual variation over time was low, about 20% on all variables. At the population level, no accumulation of mirtazapine, demethylmirtazapine, or change of the demethylmirtazapine/mirtazapine ratio was observed over time. Women had significantly higher dose-corrected concentrations of mirtazapine and demethylmirtazapine and demethylmirtazapine/mirtazapine ratio than men. Patients above 65 years of age had higher concentrations than their younger counterparts. Among patients with adverse events, lower demethylmirtazapine concentrations were observed than in patients with no adverse events. Patients on multiple drug treatment had higher dose-corrected mirtazapine and demethylmirtazapine serum concentrations than patients taking only mirtazapine. Weight and BMI had a significant negative correlation with demethylmirtazapine concentrations and with the demethylmirtazapine/mirtazapine ratio. Continued efforts are warranted to perform PK studies in a natural clinical setting to learn and understand inter- and intraindividual PK variances in real patients treated for longer periods of time. For mirtazapine as well as for most antidepressant drugs only relatively short term PK is available. To help clinicians improve their treatment of patients with major depressive disorder, the possible implications on the PK with a long-term treatment are important to study.", 
    "136": "A gas chromatography-nitrogen phosphorus selective detection (GC-NPD) method with a simple 1-step sample preparation was developed for the assay of the antipsychotic drug olanzapine in plasma. Within a time of analysis of 7 minutes, an HP-5 fused-silica capillary (25 m x 0.2 mm ID, 0.33-microm film thickness, 0.7 mL N2 as carrier gas) provided selectivity with respect to about 30 psychotropic drugs and the internal standard ethylolanzapine. Calibration was linear between 1 and 50 ng/mL and crossed the origin (LOD = 0.3 ng/mL). Intraday precision was 6.7%, 2.7%, and 1.4% at plasma concentrations of 1, 5, and 50 ng/mL, respectively. Interday precision was 4.6% at 20 ng/mL. Accuracy in commercial interlaboratory tests was 108.7% and 88.5%. The method also provided good accuracy in comparison with an HPLC method for patient samples (slope 1.003, r = 0.953) and spiked samples (slope 0.881, r = 0.998). GC-NPD with a simple sample preparation is regarded as an alternative for the assay of olanzapine plasma concentrations in therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and in pharmacokinetic studies. Smokers and patients taking concomitant carbamazepine had reduced plasma concentrations of olanzapine. Women and patients older than 60 years had increased plasma olanzapine concentrations.", 
    "137": "Accidental ingestion of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) was detected in an infant admitted at the Pediatric Emergency Department by drug testing in urine. Concentrations of MDMA and its principal metabolite 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA) in the infant's hydrolyzed urine were 11.7 mg/L and 34.4 mg/L, respectively. Apparent febrile convulsions and cardiovascular side effects resolved within 1 day after treatment with benzodiazepines. Chronic exposure to cocaine was evidenced by segmental hair analysis. Continuous maternal denial of the presence of any drug in the household made diagnosis of accidental ingestion of MDMA and chronic exposure to cocaine problematic. Periodic clinical and laboratory follow-ups were requested to check eventual long-term effects of exposure to illicit drugs and discontinuation of the child from exposure to dangerous environments.",

The median duration of SE was 2.0 +/- 10 hours. Most patients (37 [88%]) responded to IV benzodiazepine or phenytoin treatment. Nevertheless, 12 (29%) patients died and 15 (36%) developed new neurologic deficits. In patients with HIV infection, aggressive management of seizures may limit the risk of SE.",

    "141": "Across the three groups studied, logistic regression analysis demonstrated that there were no differences in the quality of RBD symptoms (e.g., nature of unpleasant dream recall or behaviors witnessed by bed partners), most PSG variables, abnormal behaviors captured by VPSG, and clinical response to clonazepam. When compared to subjects with PD, however, patients with MSA had a significantly shorter duration of disease, a higher REM sleep without atonia percentage, a greater periodic leg movement index, and less total sleep time. Subjects with idiopathic RBD, as compared to those with either MSA or PD, were more often male, had greater self-reported clinical RBD severity, and were more often aware of their abnormal sleep behaviors.", 
    "142": "REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD)-related symptoms and neurophysiologic features are qualitatively similar in RBD subjects with the idiopathic form, multiple system atrophy (MSA), and Parkinson disease (PD). Polysomnographic abnormalities associated with RBD in the setting of MSA are greater than in PD, suggesting a more severe dysfunction in the structures that modulate REM sleep.", 
    "143": "Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that mild hypothermia (32 degrees C to 34 degrees C) induced by surface cooling improves neurological outcome after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Results from animal models suggest that the effectiveness of mild hypothermia could be improved if initiated as soon as possible after return of spontaneous circulation. Infusion of cold, intravenous fluid has been proposed as a safe, effective, and inexpensive technique to induce mild hypothermia after cardiac arrest.", 
    "144": "In 17 hospitalized survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, we determined the effect on temperature and hemodynamics of infusing 2 L of 4 degrees C cold, normal saline during 20 to 30 minutes into a peripheral vein with a high-pressure bag. Data on vital signs, electrolytes, arterial blood gases, and coagulation were collected before and after fluid infusion. Cardiac function was assessed by transthoracic echocardiography before fluid administration and 1 hour after infusion. Passive (fans, leaving patient uncovered) or active (cooling blankets, neuromuscular blockade) cooling measures were used to maintain mild hypothermia for 24 hours. Infusion of 2 L of 4 degrees C cold, normal saline resulted in a mean temperature drop of 1.4 degrees C 30 minutes after the initiation of infusion. Rapid infusion of fluid was not associated with clinically important changes in vital signs, electrolytes, arterial blood gases, or coagulation parameters. The initial mean ejection fraction was 34%, and fluid infusion did not affect ejection fraction or increase central venous pressure, pulmonary pressures, or left atrial filling pressures as assessed by echocardiography. Passive measures were ineffective in maintaining hypothermia compared with active measures.",

According to the updated criteria, the most frequently prescribed inappropriate drugs were nitrofurantoin, long-acting benzodiazepines, amitriptyline, promethazine and cimetidine. Temazepam and zolpidem were mostly prescribed in supratherapeutic dose. Conventional NSAIDs in persons with a history of gastric/duodenal ulcer were the most frequently prescribed contra-indicated drugs.",

    "158": "Recent studies have indicated that muscarinic receptors are involved in the pathophysiology in schizophrenia, particularly in cognitive deficits. The superior temporal gyrus (STG) is an area that has also been strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the binding density of two muscarinic antagonists, [(3)H]pirenzepine and [(3)H]AF-DX 384, in the STG of schizophrenia patients compared with controls. A significant decrease (44% in the superficial layers and 48% in the deep layers, P<0.01) in binding density of [(3)H]pirenzepine was observed in schizophrenia patients, which suggested a reduction of muscarinic M1 and M4 receptor densities in the STG of schizophrenia patients. A tendency toward decreased [(3)H]AF-DX 384 binding density (34%, P=0.09) was also observed in schizophrenia patients compared with controls. Because of the positive correlation between [(3)H]pirenzepine and [(3)H]AF-DX 384 binding, and, insofar as both ligands have high affinities for the M4 receptor, the involvement of M4 receptor alteration is also suggested in the STG in schizophrenia. These results suggest that changes of the muscarinic receptors M1 and M4 might contribute to the STG pathology in schizophrenia.", 
    "159": "The two herbal extracts valerian (Valeriana officinalis L.) and St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) were studied for their metabolic changes upon incubation with freshly prepared rat hepatocytes and subsequently analysed phytochemically as well as pharmacologically in vitro. Quantitative HPLC analysis of valerian extracts revealed considerable metabolic activities with regard to sesquiterpenes and iridoids. The amount of acetoxyvalerenic acid decreased 9-fold, while that of hydroxyvalerenic acid correspondingly increased 9-fold due to O-deacetylation. The valepotriates didrovaltrate, isovaltrate and valtrate decreased 2-, 18- and 16-fold, respectively. However, the binding affinities of the incubated extracts to the benzodiazepine and picrotoxin binding site of the GABA (A) receptor were quite similar to those of the non-incubated extracts. Neither valerenic acids nor valepotriates exhibited any significant effect on the two binding sites when tested as single compounds. Therefore, either other constituents represent the active ones or multiple compounds are necessary for the observed inhibitory and allosteric effects at the GABA (A) receptor. Extracts of St. John's wort were less potently metabolised than valerian. The amount of pseudohypericin and the main flavonoids (hyperoside, rutin, isoquercitrin, quercitrin, quercetin and I3,II8-biapigenin) slightly decreased during the 4-h incubation period. Both the antagonist effect at the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) type 1 receptor and the binding inhibition at the 5-HT transporter were attenuated during the metabolic treatment. The reduced antagonist effect correlates with the decreasing amount of pseudohypericin known to be a CRF (1) receptor antagonist. In conclusion, the incubation of plant extracts with freshly prepared rat hepatocytes represents a useful approach to study the pharmacological action of metabolised plant extracts. The consistent pharmacological activity of both valerian and St. John's wort is concordant with the known clinical efficacy of pharmacological activities.",

Total RNA was isolated from PBLs on day 1 and day 9, and mRNA expression for the CYP enzymes and hGAPDH were determined by means of quantitative, real-time, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. CYP1A2 activity was estimated by calculating the plasma paraxanthine to caffeine AUC ratio (caffeine metabolic ratio; CMR), CYP2C19 activity by the 2-h omeprazole hydroxylation index (HI), CYP2D6 activity by the urinary debrisoquine recovery ratio (DBRR) and CYP3A4 activity by midazolam clearance.",

Here, we report that fenobam is a selective and potent metabotropic glutamate (mGlu)5 receptor antagonist acting at an allosteric modulatory site shared with 2-methyl-6-phenylethynyl-pyridine (MPEP), the protypical selective mGlu5 receptor antagonist. Fenobam inhibited quisqualate-evoked intracellular calcium response mediated by human mGlu5 receptor with IC(50) = 58 +/- 2 nM. It acted in a noncompetitive manner, similar to MPEP and demonstrated inverse agonist properties, blocking 66% of the mGlu5 receptor basal activity (in an over expressed cell line) with an IC(50) = 84 +/- 13 nM. [(3)H]Fenobam bound to rat and human recombinant receptors with K(d) values of 54 +/- 6 and 31 +/- 4 nM, respectively. MPEP inhibited [(3)H]fenobam binding to human mGlu5 receptors with a K(i) value of 6.7 +/- 0.7 nM, indicating a common binding site shared by both allosteric antagonists. Fenobam exhibits anxiolytic activity in the stress-induced hyperthermia model, Vogel conflict test, Geller-Seifter conflict test, and conditioned emotional response with a minimum effective dose of 10 to 30 mg/kg p.o. Furthermore, fenobam is devoid of GABAergic activity, confirming previous reports that fenobam acts by a mechanism distinct from benzodiazepines. The non-GABAergic activity of fenobam, coupled with its robust anxiolytic activity and reported efficacy in human in a double blind placebo-controlled trial, supports the potential of developing mGlu5 receptor antagonists with an improved therapeutic window over benzodiazepines as novel anxiolytic agents.",

Single crystal structural data for the latter phase are presented, confirming the presence of the (Olanzapine)(2) dimer as the structural building unit of all known phases of the drug, either anhydrate or solvated.

Ethanol administration continued from delivery up to weaning. The open field, elevated plus maze and forced swimming tests were used to evaluate effects of ethanol on locomotion, anxiety and depression, respectively. Binding assays were used to identify dopaminergic (D1- and D2-like) and muscarinic (M1 plus M2) receptors. Results of the plus maze test indicated significant and dose-dependent increases in the number of entrances in the open arms and in the time of permanence in the open arms, in the prenatally ethanol-exposed offspring, as compared to controls, indicating an anxiolytic effect. In the open field test, this group presented decreases in spontaneous locomotor activity as well as in the occurrences of rearing and grooming. Offspring also showed dose-dependent increases in their immobility time in the forced swimming test, characterizing despair behavior. Decreases in the hippocampal (D2: 32%; D1: 25%) and striatal (D2: 30%; D1: 52%) dopaminergic binding were detected in ethanol-exposed offspring. On the other hand, significant increases were observed in muscarinic binding in the hippocampus (40%) as well as in the striatum (42%). This study shows evidence that in utero ethanol exposure produces a long-lasting effect on development and pharmacological characteristics of brain systems that may have important implications in behavioral and neurochemical responsiveness occurring in adulthood.", 
    "173": "We previously reported that the very mild stress of individual housing influenced seizure risk and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor activity differentially between male and female rats. The aim of the present set of studies was to assess sex differences in behavioral responses to a more pronounced type of stressor, repeated restraint stress. We also wanted to determine the role of GABA(A) receptors in effects of this stressor. Our data suggest that repeated restraint stress afforded short-term protection against seizure induction in both male and female rats. Moreover, this protection was more persistent in female than male rats. This stress paradigm also elicited a reduction in general activity in male rats, whereas female rats displayed prolonged increased activity following the repeated restraint stress exposure. However, there were limited effects on anxiety-like behaviors, as determined by time spent in the open arms on the elevated plus maze. Sex differences in stress-induced increases in plasma corticosterone levels were observed, which generally correlated with sex differences in behavioral measures. There were no significant effects of the repeated restraint stress exposure on benzodiazepine/GABA(A) receptor density or affinity nor on receptor function. Taken together, these findings provide additional evidence to support the important influences of sex in responding to stress and highlight the need to consider this context when addressing the role of stress in health issues for women and men.",

In this study, 1 was successfully synthesised and demethylated to form the phenolic derivative 6 as precursor for labelling with carbon-11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 min). [11C]1 was prepared by O-alkylation of 6 with [11C]methyl iodide. The radiochemical yield of [(11)C]1 was 9% (non-decay corrected) with a specific activity of 36 GBq/micromol at the end of synthesis. The average time of synthesis including formulation was 13.2 min with a radiochemical purity >98%. In vivo assessment of [11C]1 was performed in a healthy Papio hamadryas baboon using positron emission tomography (PET). Following iv administration of [11C]1, significant accumulation was observed in the baboon brain and peripheral organs. In the brain, the radioactivity peaked at 20 min and remained constant for the duration of the imaging experiment. Pre-treatment with the PBR-specific ligand, PK 11195 (5 mg/kg), effectively reduced the binding of [11C]1 at 60 min by 70% in the whole brain, whereas pre-treatment with the central benzodiazepine receptor ligand, flumazenil (1mg/kg), had no inhibitory effect on [11C]1 uptake. These results indicate that accumulation of [11C]1 in the baboon represents selective binding to the PBR. These exceptional in vivo binding properties suggest that [11C]1 may be useful for imaging the PBR in disease states. Furthermore, [11C]1 represents the first ligand of its pharmacological class to be labelled for PET studies and therefore has the potential to generate new information on the pathological role of the PBR in vivo.",

    "180": "\"Conventional\" antidepressants, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), bupropion, or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, are not recommended as monotherapy for bipolar depression. Although they are likely to provide effective symptom relief in combination with mood stabilizers, the risk of precipitating a switch to mania often complicates their use even as combination therapy. Recently, 2 psychotropic medications approved for treating acute mania, olanzapine and quetiapine, have also been shown to possess antidepressant activity without destabilizing mood and, as such, are potential mood stabilizers. This article aims to review the mechanism of action of conventional antidepressants and newer agents that are effective in the treatment of bipolar depression. A number of mechanisms have been postulated to play a role in the effective treatment of bipolar depression, including targets as diverse as serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, and various second messenger signaling pathways. A review of the data reveals an important point of commonality among the antidepressant treatments, olanzapine, and quetiapine. Antidepressant treatments, such as norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs, and electroconvulsive therapy, induce a reduction of 5-HT(2A) receptors. Both olanzapine and quetiapine not only are antagonists at this receptor but also induce downregulation of 5-HT(2A) receptors. It is possible that the antidepressant efficacy of these agents is mediated by this receptor, while the additional benefit of olanzapine and quetiapine over unimodal antidepressant treatments, in terms of stabilizing mood, may be provided by their concomitant dopamine D(2) antagonism. Further studies should be conducted to examine these hypotheses.", 
    "181": "Despite the considerable burden of bipolar depression, the treatment of this debilitating phase of bipolar disorder is suboptimally addressed by currently available pharmacologic options. Consequently, there is a need for the development of new treatment options with enhanced efficacy and tolerability. Evidence of antidepressant efficacy for some of the atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of bipolar depression has recently emerged. The findings of a large-scale, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical study of olanzapine alone and in combination with fluoxetine, and a similar study of quetiapine monotherapy, suggest that some of the atypical antipsychotics may be efficacious in treating depressive symptoms in patients with bipolar I disorder. Subpopulation analyses suggest that quetiapine monotherapy and the olanzapine plus fluoxetine combination appear to be effective in treating depression in patients with a rapid-cycling course. The magnitude of improvement in depressive symptoms in the bipolar I population appears to be larger for quetiapine monotherapy compared with either olanzapine or olanzapine plus fluoxetine; however, the limitations of such a cross-study comparison are acknowledged. Both olanzapine monotherapy and combination therapy, as well as quetiapine monotherapy, were well tolerated. The overall incidence of treatment-emergent mania was low and comparable with placebo in both studies. Somnolence, weight gain, increased appetite and nonfasting glucose and cholesterol levels were more commonly reported in patients treated with olanzapine monotherapy or combination therapy compared with placebo. Dry mouth, sedation/somnolence, dizziness, and constipation were more commonly associated with quetiapine treatment. Large, controlled studies are needed to determine whether other psychotropic agents have antidepressant properties that would make them suitable for use in patients with bipolar depression. In addition, direct comparison of the regimens used in the current study should determine whether the differences evident between them can be confirmed.",

BPSD reduce patient quality of life, cause great distress to caregivers and are the most common reason for institutionalisation.

Nausea occured in 87% and vomiting in 13% of the patients in the control group, while none of the sedated subjects had these side-effects, although 76% of them had experienced then during previous cycles of chemotherapy. Compared with the control group, post-chemotherapy anxiety scores also improved with the addition of midazolam or propofol. Eighty percent of the subjects declared that they would prefer the sedative-containing regimen for their further cycles.

    "188": "Mice were forced to swim for 5 min in water at a temperature of 12 degrees C (cold water swim stress) or 32 degrees C (warm water swim stress), and stress-induced analgesia (SIA) was measured using the tail-flick test. The cold water swim stress induced non-opioid SIA as well as hypothermia, whereas the warm water swim stress caused opioid SIA. The in vivo binding of [(3)H]-Ro15-4513 was measured in the stressed mice and compared with that in control mice. The specific binding of [(3)H]-Ro15-4513 in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum was significantly altered by forced swimming in cold water. Apparent association and dissociation rate of [(3)H]-Ro15-4513 binding were decreased, and the change in the dissociation rate was most pronounced in the hippocampus. In contrast, no significant alterations were observed in in vitro binding. The hypothermia induced by the cold water swim stress seems to be the main reason for alterations in the specific binding of [(3)H]-Ro15-4513. The kinetics of a saturable amount of [(3)H]-Ro15-4513 in the blood and brain were also measured. The relative ratio of the radioactivity concentration in the brain to that in the blood was significantly decreased by forced swimming in cold water, indicating that the cold water swim stress induced changes in the nonspecific binding of [(3)H]-Ro15-4513 in the brain. These results together with previous reports suggested that non-opioid SIA induced by the cold water swim stress might be related to alterations in the rates of general ligand-receptor interactions including GABA(A)/benzodiazepine system. Changes in the nonspecific binding might be also involved in non-opioid SIA.",

Twenty-eight schizophrenia subjects stabilized on olanzapine or risperidone were randomized to receive 8 wk of celecoxib (400 mg/d) or placebo. Serum soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2r) and in-vitro PHA-stimulated whole-blood cytokine production levels were measured at baseline, 1 wk, and 8 wk. Celecoxib augmentation did not alter any of the cytokine parameters measured for the overall study group. However, 1 wk of celecoxib augmentation increased TNF-alpha and IL-2 production levels in olanzapine-treated subjects. These elevations did not persist by week 8. Overall, celecoxib does not significantly modify cytokine levels in medicated schizophrenia subjects."
