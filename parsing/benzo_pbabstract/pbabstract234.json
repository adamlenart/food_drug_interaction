    "0": "Because the definition of standard of care changes with time, it is difficult to predict whether any given technique or practice will be ultimately viewed as the next advance in care or will be discarded as unnecessary or cumbersome. It is too early to tell whether deep sedation/analgesia with propofol or some other ultrashort acting anesthetic will emerge as the sedative/analgesic of choice for routine endoscopic practice. It seems that deep sedation with propofol provides some advantages over current narcotic/benzodiazepine combinations in many circumstances, but potential risks exist. Further information, including careful documentation of the complications that occur with this and similar agents, be they attributable to the drug or the level of sedation, are eagerly awaited. For now, it seems prudent to continue to recommend that the level of sedation/analgesia be appropriate to the perceived need and that patients continue to have their procedures performed with safety, comfort, and competence as the overriding concerns.", 
    "1": "The administration of sedation and analgesia for pediatric gastrointestinal procedures has become routine but is not standardized. For the most part, pediatric endoscopists are encouraged to use their clinical judgment to select between using intravenous (IV) sedation or general anesthesia on an individual patient basis. Commonly administered IV sedation regimens in children combine benzodiazepines with narcotics, but anesthesiologist administered propofol sedation is gaining acceptance among pediatric gastroenterologists. Guidelines for patient monitoring and new technologic advances may help to ensure patient safety for children undergoing endoscopic procedures, no matter what sedation regimen is used.", 
    "2": "The practice of sedation and analgesia is under increasing scrutiny by numerous regulatory agencies, with the aim of making these procedures safer and reducing the incidence of cardiopulmonary complications during GI endoscopy. As we move toward more evidence-based medicine, new technologies will have to be assessed in a manner that demonstrates their efficacy and utility in clinical practice. Although there have been no controlled studies examining whether more intensive monitoring during endoscopy improves outcomes, extended monitoring with capnography seems to offer an advantage over conventional monitoring in that, by providing a real-time indication of any change in adequate ventilation before oxygen desaturation occurs, it can detect early phases of respiratory depression, which can allow a more precise and safer titration of medications. There is a close agreement among experts that capnography may reduce the risk of adverse outcomes during deep sedation; therefore, its use should be required for patients undergoing advanced endoscopic procedures with the potential for deep sedation. Extended monitoring with capnography should also be endorsed whenever propofol is considered as an alternative to standard sedation with a benzodiazepine or narcotic. Our understanding of the clinical application of techniques for monitoring of depth of sedation is in its infancy, and its full contribution to the practice of endoscopy has yet to be determined. Their potential role in improving sedation practice during endoscopy needs to be confirmed by controlled trials. If we consider the lack of proven efficacy of these emerging monitoring techniques in reducing the adverse outcomes associated with sedation and analgesia, the importance of appropriate monitoring cannot be overemphasized. However, it is vital for the endoscopist to be thoroughly familiar with the type of sedation chosen, to be able to recognize the various levels of sedation, and, above all, to rescue patients should they unintentionally progress to a deeper level of sedation than intended.",

In an observation of chloralose poisoning by ingestion of synthetic substance against moles, curarization by cistracurium besylate was proposed to contribute in the symptomatic treatment of myoclonus syndrome induced by chloralose poisoning and resistant to a large dose of diazepam.", 
    "4": "The delivery of subcutaneous medication by continuous infusion is common in palliative medicine. Many centers combine multiple medications, but the analytical confirmation of the compatibility and stability of these combinations has rarely been performed. This study examined the compatibility and stability of midazolam and dexamethasone using high performance liquid chromatography. Nine different solutions were prepared in polypropylene syringes by combining these two drugs with 0.9% sodium chloride. When these two drugs were combined in a syringe, there was significant loss of midazolam over 48 hours, with only 60-80% of the initial concentration remaining in syringes stored at 35-39 degrees C. This study demonstrates that cloudiness of a solution is not the only predictor of drug loss and that drug loss may occur even in solutions that remain clear at time of preparation. The clinical implications of these results are that dexamethasone and midazolam should not be combined in syringe driver solutions.", 
    "5": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurological emergency, with high mortality and high morbidity among survivors, and novel therapeutic agents are needed to improve this picture. We examined the effects of the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam (LEV) in an experimental model of self-sustaining status epilepticus (SSSE), induced in rats by electrical stimulation of the perforant path. LEV's unique spectrum of anticonvulsant activity, very high therapeutic index, and neuroprotective properties, make it a potentially interesting agent in the treatment of SE. Pretreatment with LEV intravenously reduced (30 mg/kg) or prevented (50-1000 mg/kg) the development of self-sustaining seizures. Treatment during the maintenance phase of SSSE diminished (at 200 mg/kg) or aborted seizures (in doses of 500 or 1000 mg/kg). Addition of LEV significantly enhanced the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam (DZP), even when both drugs where given in doses far below their therapeutic level. We conclude that LEV deserves further evaluation in the treatment of status epilepticus.", 
    "6": "In order to evaluate the effectiveness of diazepam for the reduction in the recurrence of febrile seizures we carried out a prospective study in two groups of children; Group A: 45 children (25 female, 20 male), receiving oral prophylaxis with diazepam, and Group B: 65 children (35 female, 30 male) who did not receive any oral prophylaxis. All subjects of both groups were followed for at least 4 years and finally re-evaluated at the mean age of 6.7+/-1.4 years. Among the patients of Group A, recurrent febrile seizures (FS) occurred in five of the 45 children (11.1%). Among the 65 children of Group B, 20 (30.7%) went on to have one or more additional episodes. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that oral diazepam, given only when fever is present, is an effective means of reducing the risk of recurrences of FS.", 
    "7": "In mice, withdrawal from agents that depress central nervous system function, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, results in the production of a withdrawal syndrome, one feature of which is increased severity of handling induced convulsions (HICs). High and Low Pentobarbital Withdrawal mice (HPW and LPW) were selectively bred to display severe and mild pentobarbital withdrawal HICs, respectively. These mice provide a valuable means to assess genetic correlations between withdrawal from pentobarbital and other sedative agents. We tested HPW and LPW mice for severity of HICs elicited during withdrawal from ethanol, diazepam, and zolpidem, and measured consumption of and preference for pentobarbital solutions in HPW and LPW mice. HPW mice displayed greater HICs than LPW mice during ethanol and zolpidem withdrawal, but differed less robustly during diazepam withdrawal. LPW mice consumed more pentobarbital in a solution of a moderate concentration than did HPW mice, but did not consume more pentobarbital at a higher or lower concentration. These results indicate that some of the same genes that affect the severity of withdrawal from pentobarbital also influence ethanol and zolpidem withdrawal, but that diazepam withdrawal may be less influenced by these genes.", 
    "8": "N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists share a number of pharmacological effects with GABA(A) agonists, including anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects. This study evaluated the effects of site-selective NMDA antagonists in rats trained to discriminate the benzodiazepine diazepam from vehicle. As expected, diazepam produced robust discriminative stimulus effects and dose-dependently substituted for the training dose. Mixed results were obtained with competitive NMDA antagonists: whereas NPC 17742 partially substituted for diazepam, SDZ EAA 494 did not elicit responding on the diazepam-associated lever. Other site-selective NMDA antagonists, including the open channel blocker phencyclidine, the glycine-site antagonists ACEA 1021 and MDL 102,288, the polyamine-site antagonist arcaine, and the glutamate release inhibitor riluzole, failed to substitute for diazepam. Agonists at nonbenzodiazepine sites of the GABA(A) receptor complex were also tested for comparison purposes. The barbiturate pentobarbital and the neurosteroid Co 2-1068 partially substituted for diazepam. In contrast, the anticonvulsant carbamazepine failed to substitute even at a dose that substantially reduced response rates. These results suggest that substitution of NMDA antagonists for GABA(A) agonists is dependent upon the site at which the NMDA antagonist binds. Further, they suggest that similarities between the stimulus properties of GABA(A) agonists and NMDA antagonists are at least as strong as similarities among agonists acting at different sites on GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "9": "In the traditional system of medicine, the roots and rhizomes of Glycyrrhiza glabra (family: Leguminosae) have been employed clinically for centuries for their anti-inflammatory, antiulcer, expectorant, antimicrobial and anxiolytic activities. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of Glycyrrhiza glabra (popularly known as liquorice) on learning and memory in mice. Elevated plus-maze and passive avoidance paradigm were employed to test learning and memory. Three doses (75, 150 and 300 mg/kg p.o.) of aqueous extract of Glycyrrhiza glabra were administered for 7 successive days in separate groups of animals. The dose of 150 mg/kg of the aqueous extract of liquorice significantly improved learning and memory of mice. Furthermore, this dose significantly reversed the amnesia induced by diazepam (1 mg/kg i.p.) and scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg i.p.). Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of liquorice may be contributing favorably to the memory enhancement effect. Since scopolamine-induced amnesia was reversed by liquorice, it is possible that the beneficial effect on learning and memory was due to facilitation of cholinergic-transmission in mouse brain. However, further studies are necessitated to identify the exact mechanism of action. In the present investigation, Glycyrrhiza glabra has shown promise as a memory enhancing agent in all the laboratory models employed.",

Severity of illness was assessed biweekly by the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Analysis of covariance with baseline Y-BOCS score included as a covariate was used to compare improvement in Y-BOCS scores in the 2 groups. Response was defined as a 25% or greater improvement in Y-BOCS score. Data were collected between April 2001 and May 2003.",

The fact that 21 cases of NMS with clozapine were found indicates that low occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and low EPS-inducing potential do not prevent the occurrence of NMS and D(2) dopamine receptor blocking potential does not have direct correlation with the occurrence of NMS. One of the cardinal features of NMS is an increasing manifestation of EPS, and the conventional antipsychotic drugs are known to produce EPS in 95% or more of NMS cases.

One half of the words contained in the lists had a high frequency (HF) of occurrence and the remainder were of low frequency (LF). The results showed that LF words were more sensitive to memory impairment than HF words. However, the more accurate recall of HF words (with respect to LF words) was eliminated when a combination of lorazepam with alcohol was administered. These findings indicate that word frequency has a significant impact on memory and, as such, is a factor to be taken into account when using memory recall tasks to assess the effects of psychoactive drugs on memory.",

In addition, the central effects of both drugs when administered alone and in combination were assessed to rule out any relevant synergistic depressant central effect. Twenty-five healthy young adult volunteers participated in a double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, repeated dose (15 days), 4-period crossover study. Each subject received each of 4 treatment sequences (ie, paroxetine-alprazolam placebo, alprazolam-paroxetine placebo, paroxetine-alprazolam, and paroxetine placebo-alprazolam placebo) in randomized order. The ratios for area under the curve within a dosing interval and maximum plasma concentration of the paroxetine plus alprazolam sequence to single agent paroxetine were 1.07 (90% confidence interval = 0.99 to 1.16) and 1.05 (90% confidence interval = 0.97 to 1.13), respectively, with no statistically significant differences between the 2 treatments.

Comparative pharmacodynamics on the combination was assessed using 6 Psychomotor Performance Tests and 5 Visual Analogue Scales focused on mood variables. Alprazolam and paroxetine plus alprazolam induced similar and significant performance impairment and sedation after both single and repeated dose administration, being less evident on day 15. After dosing, paroxetine plus alprazolam showed a lower recovery pattern than alprazolam alone, especially on day 15. No treatment sequence showed cumulative effects after repeated dose administration. Psychomotor Performance Tests and Visual Analogue Scales data suggested lack of pharmacodynamic interactions. Accordingly, study results showed no evidence for pharmacologic interactions between paroxetine and alprazolam at steady state. The most commonly reported adverse event was drowsiness, with a higher incidence under both single and combined alprazolam treatments.", 
    "39": "Apolipoprotein A-IV (apo A-IV), a peptide expressed by enterocytes in the mammalian small intestine and released in response to long-chain triglyceride absorption, may be involved in the regulation of gastric acid secretion and gastric motility. The specific aim of the present study was to determine the pathway involved in mediating inhibition of gastric motility produced by apo A-IV. Gastric motility was measured manometrically in response to injections of either recombinant purified apo A-IV (200 microg) or apo A-I, the structurally similar intestinal apolipoprotein not regulated by triglyceride absorption, close to the upper gastrointestinal tract in urethane-anesthetized rats. Injection of apo A-IV significantly inhibited gastric motility compared with apo A-I or vehicle injections. The response to exogenous apo A-IV injections was significantly reduced by 77 and 55%, respectively, in rats treated with the CCK(1) receptor blocker devazepide or after functional vagal deafferentation by perineural capsaicin treatment. In electrophysiological experiments, isolated proximal duodenal vagal afferent fibers were recorded in vitro in response to close-arterial injection of vehicle, apo A-IV (200 microg), or CCK (10 pmol). Apo A-IV stimulated the discharge of duodenal vagal afferent fibers, significantly increasing the discharge in 4/7 CCK-responsive units, and the response was abolished by CCK(1) receptor blockade with devazepide. These data suggest that apo A-IV released from the intestinal mucosa during lipid absorption stimulates the release of endogenous CCK that activates CCK(1) receptors on vagal afferent nerve terminals initiating feedback inhibition of gastric motility.",

Detection of convulsions requires close monitoring and one should be on the look out for signs of subtle convulsions. About a third of acute seizures in children with cerebral malaria, do not manifest as convulsions, but as changes in eye deviation, salivation and/or eye deviation. It is important to terminate convulsions lasting more than 5 min, since prolonged convulsions are associated with neurological deficits in survivors of children with severe malaria. Initial management should include putting the child into the left lateral position, checking the blood glucose and administering oxygen if hypoxic. The benzodiazepines, particularly diazepam, are used as the initial anticonvulsants. Phenobarbital and phenytoin are used as second-line treatments. Prompt and effective management of falciparum malaria associated convulsions may contribute to a better outcome in children with severe malaria.",

Rats received either midazolam (0.75 mg/kg, s.c.) or vehicle and were exposed to pieces of a collar that had been worn by a domestic cat or an unworn (dummy) collar. Cat odor caused midazolam-sensitive defensive behavioral responses, including avoidance of collar contact, inhibition of grooming, and prolonged rearing. Cat odor exposure induced Fos expression in the posterior accessory olfactory bulb (glomerular, mitral, and granule cell layers), with granule cell layer activation attenuated by midazolam. High basal Fos expression, and some cat odor-associated Fos expression, was evident in the main olfactory bulb (glomerular cell layer), and midazolam exerted a strong inhibitory effect in this region. Midazolam inhibited Fos expression in key limbic regions involved in pheromone transduction (medial amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis) and defensive behavior (prelimbic cortex, lateral septum, lateral and medial preoptic areas, and dorsal premammillary nucleus). However, midazolam failed to affect cat odor-related Fos expression in a range of key defense-related sites, including the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, and cuneiform nucleus. These results indicate that midazolam exerts a region-specific effect on the neural substrates activated by predator odor, with effects in the lateral septum and dorsal premammillary nucleus likely to be of major importance. These findings also suggest the intriguing hypothesis that cat odor is processed by rats as a \"pheromone-like\" stimulus.",

At the present time, many procedures are performed using intravenous sedation and local anesthesia. The purpose of this article was to examine the safety and outcome of full abdominoplasties performed under conscious sedation at the authors' institution. Over a 6-year period from 1997 to 2002, 266 abdominoplasties were performed by the two senior authors. One hundred thirteen of these (42 percent) were performed under a general or regional anesthetic because a concurrent procedure was performed that precluded the use of conscious sedation (64 hysterectomies, 18 hernia repairs, six urogynecologic procedures, 10 breast reductions, and one laparoscopic cholecystectomy) or because of patient and surgeon preference (14 cases). One hundred fifty-three abdominoplasties (58 percent) were performed under conscious sedation using intravenous midazolam and fentanyl along with a local anesthetic. No patients had an unplanned conversion to deep sedation or general anesthesia. Eighty percent of these cases were performed with a concurrent procedure (80 liposuctions, 19 breast augmentations, 20 mastopexies, three capsulotomies, and 13 varied facial aesthetic procedures). In addition, 12 patients had concurrent hernia repairs (five ventral and seven umbilical) under conscious sedation. Mean follow-up was 10 months (range, 1 to 56 months). There were no intraoperative complications and no major postoperative complications. The minor complication rate was 11.1 percent (10 seromas requiring needle aspiration in the office, three superficial wound infections, two cases of marginal skin necrosis, one stitch abscess, and one pseudobursa requiring reexcision). Seven revisions were performed for suboptimal scars (5 percent). The results of this study demonstrate that abdominoplasties can be performed under conscious sedation in a safe and cost-effective manner for almost all patients. This type of procedure is well tolerated, has a low complication rate, and has high patient satisfaction. Increasing experience and small modifications in local anesthesia and surgical technique have strengthened the authors' conviction that conscious sedation is the preferred method of anesthesia for most patients undergoing abdominoplasty.",

    "79": "The role of GABAB receptors in various behavioral processes has been largely defined using the prototypical GABAB receptor agonist baclofen. However, baclofen induces sedation, hypothermia and muscle relaxation, which may interfere with its use in behavioral paradigms. Although there is much evidence for a role of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in the pathophysiology of anxiety, the role of GABAB receptors in these disorders is largely unclear. We recently identified GS39783 (N,N'-dicyclopentyl-2-methylsulfanyl-5-nitro-pyrimidine-4,6-diamine) as a selective allosteric positive modulator at GABAB receptors. The aim of the present study was to broadly characterize the effects of GS39783 in well-validated rodent models for motor activity, cognition, and anxiety. The following tests were included: locomotor activity in rats and mice, rotarod and traction tests (including determinations of core temperature) in mice, passive avoidance in mice and rats, elevated plus maze in rats, elevated zero maze in mice and rats, stress-induced hyperthermia in mice, and pentobarbital- and ethanol-induced sleep in mice. Unlike baclofen and/or the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide, GS39783 had no effect in any of the tests for locomotion, cognition, temperature, or narcosis. Most interestingly, GS39783 had anxiolytic-like effects in all the tests used. Overall, the data obtained here suggest that positive modulation of GABAB receptors may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for the development of anxiolytics, with a superior side effect profile to both baclofen and benzodiazepines.",

Secondary RLS occurs in patients with uremia, pregnancy, and iron deficiency. Patients experience an irresistible urge to move the legs that is worse during inactivity and at night. RLS affects 6.6% to 62% of patients on long-term dialysis therapy and is associated with a greater mortality risk. The wide range of reported prevalence is explained in part by variations in methods of diagnosis. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group defined diagnostic criteria that have improved the quality of RLS research. Advanced neurological imaging techniques suggest the pathophysiological state of idiopathic RLS involves dysfunction of subcortical areas of the brain. Dopaminergic pathways and neuronal iron handling have been implicated. Limited studies of patients with uremic RLS suggested similar mechanisms, but anemia, hyperphosphatemia, and psychological factors also may have a role. The few clinical trials in uremic RLS suggest that treatment should involve the reduction of potential exacerbating agents (tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin uptake inhibitors, lithium, and dopamine antagonists), correction of anemia (with erythropoietin and iron), and use of levodopa or dopamine agonists. Other agents shown to be of benefit in idiopathic RLS can be tried, but may be limited by side effects in patients with uremia (benzodiazepines, opioids, gabapentin, carbamazepine, and clonidine). Symptoms of uremic RLS will disappear within a few weeks of successful renal transplantation. The progress made to date in unraveling the pathophysiological state of uremic RLS should stimulate additional research toward targeted therapy.",

This model has as its central tenet that the most adverse health outcomes are to be expected in high strain jobs characterized by high job demands and low job control. An extension of the model states that the most noxious combination is high job demands, low control and low social support at work. Sample subjects were recruited from 25 Belgian companies between 1994 and 1998, and cover a wide range of occupations. A 5.6% of 16,094 men and 9.3% of 5012 women aged 35-59 years report use of benzodiazepines during the last month.

    "93": "Subjects sedated by noradrenergic alpha2 agonists can switch rapidly from a state of extremely low to almost full consciousness following phasic increases in arousal or cognitive demand. Such flexibility is not displayed by traditional sedatives, such as the benzodiazepine diazepam. Experimentally, the phasic modulation of alpha2 effect by arousing or distracting stimuli can counteract the deleterious cognitive effects of alpha2 agonists. We used behavioural and fMRI indices of brain function to investigate the phasic modulatory effect that presentation of loud white noise would have on attentional dysfunction induced by administration of dexmedotomidine, an alpha2 agonist. Dexmedotomidine and midazolam were compared to placebo during performance of a target detection task, which was presented in the presence or absence of white noise. Compared to placebo, both dexmedotomidine and midazolam impaired task performance. This impairment was significantly attenuated by presentation of white noise in the dexmedotomidine condition only. This functional improvement corresponded to selective increase in activity of left medial pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus. This regional increase is suggested to index increases in phasic arousal, which counteract dexmedotomidine's detrimental attentional effects. Finally, despite sedating subjects to equivalent degrees, dexmedotomidine and midazolam had strikingly different regional effects on task-induced brain activity. Therefore, for the same level of sedation, the behavioural and anatomical attributes identifying the quality of sedation can vary.", 
    "94": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multi-system disorder characterized clinically by abnormal mental and physical development. PWS patients have a deletion in an imprinted region on paternal chromosome 15 (15q11-13), maternal disomy for this segment, or rarely, a chromosomal imprinting center deletion that gives rise to suppression of the equivalent paternal genes. Within the affected segment of chromosome 15 are genes encoding the alpha(5), beta(3) and gamma(3) subunits of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A (GABA(A)) receptor. Therefore, altered neurobehavioral function could arise in PWS due directly to altered GABA(A) receptor composition and expression, or alternatively, from brain developmental and maturational effects of these or other genes in the imprinted region. The aim of the present study was to assess cerebral GABA(A) receptors in PWS with the use of positron emission tomography of the benzodiazepine binding site employing [11C]flumazenil ([11C]FMZ). A reduction in [11C]FMZ binding was found predominantly in the cingulate, frontal and temporal neocortices and insula in six adult PWS patients compared to nine normal subjects. A possible role for the deleted beta(3) subunit gene in PWS is supported in part by the wide cortical distribution of its mRNA expression and the effects of experimental knockouts on benzodiazepine binding described in prior studies. Altered GABA(A) receptor composition or number in these cortical regions may account for neurobehavioral abnormalities in PWS including mild mental retardation, poor impulse control, and impaired responses to somatic pain.",

Two weeks after the beginning of treatment, the decrease in pain scores was 2.4+/-0.6 and 0.6+/-0.4 in the clonazepam and placebo group, respectively (P = 0.014). Similar effects were obtained in an intent-to-treat analysis (P = 0.027). The blood concentration of clonazepam was similar whether it was measured 14 days after sucking a tablet three times a day or during the 5 h that followed sucking a single tablet (n = 5).

The most prescribed benzodiazepins were prazepam, dipotassic clorazepate, lorazepam and diazepam. Use of these drugs during night is most recommended. Nevertheless, 26.67% of the prescriptions indicated the drug should be use during the day. The period of use was between one and three Months for 33.99% of patients and three Months or more in 42%. Benzodiazepins were used by 66.67% for insomnia, alone or associated with another condition, for anxiety by 14.6% and for epilepsy by 10%. Prescriptions were for benzodiazepins alone in 47.37% of the patients and in combination with other psychotropic drugs for 19.33%. Somnolence and dependence were the most reported side effects.", 
    "105": "Zolpidem is a sedative and hypnotic drug belonging to imidazopyridine family. Zolpidem facilitates GABAA function more selectively than benzodiazepines, and produces a selective hypnotic effect. In comparison with benzodiazepines this mechanism could be reduce liability to induce dependence. Recently, some cases of zolpidem abuse and dependence have been published. The Authors report 2 cases of addiction to high dose of zolpidem and compare them with others described in the literature. Both patients had been reknown drug addicts before their first prescription of zolpidem and a borderline personality disorder was diagnosed. The patients rapidly developed over consumption and dependence of the molecule, when taking doses as high as 240 and 400 mg daily. To get zolpidem, one patient falsifies prescriptions. They don't suffer from the sedative effects while searching for anxiolytic and stimulating effects. They were also dysarthric, confused, high energy for mental and physical activity. The cases of zolpidem abuse and dependence in the literature describe these symptoms and others such as losing sense of orientation in time and space, amnesia and visual hallucinations. The most typical withdrawal symptom is high levels of anxiety. Moreover, one patient presents an epileptic seizure whereas the other display a severe psychiatric complication such a psychosis. In the literature, withdrawal was accompanied by confusion, suicidal ideas, nausea, vomiting, sweat, tremors, tachycardia and insomnia rebound. The epileptic seizures are described but acute psychosis complication is rare. Pharmacological hypotheses are described. The effects of zolpidem on GABAA receptor gene expression are consistent with the reduced tolerance liability of this drug as well as with other ability to induce both physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome. Through the review of the literature, the Authors noted that 50% of the cases of dependence on zolpidem are drug addicts, therefore concluding that drug addicts are more likely to become dependent on zolpidem.", 
    "106": "Bipolar patients generally spend much more time in the depressed phase of their illness than the manic phase, and there are many more bipolar type II and bipolar spectrum disorder patients than there are bipolar type I. Additionally, there is a significant risk of suicide in bipolar patients when depressed. The treatment of the depressed phase of bipolar disorder is therefore a matter of some priority. Here, we review current evidence supporting the use of five groups of treatments: anti-depressants; lithium; anti-convulsants (valproate, and carbamazepine, lamotrigine, gabapentin); anti-psychotics; and other treatments (electroconvulsive therapy, benzodiazepines, sleep-deprivation, and dopamine agonists). From this review, it is apparent that the literature regarding the treatment of bipolar depression is significantly limited in several key areas. Nonetheless, from the evidence currently available, the treatments with the best evidence for efficacy are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and lamotrigine. There is also some evidence in favour of bupropion and moclobemide. Although lithium and olanzapine monotherapies can also be beneficial, they appear less efficacious than antidepressants. One of the major concerns about treatment with antidepressants has been the risk of precipitating a switch into mania. However, recent studies suggest that, if a mood stabilizer and antidepressant are given concurrently, then the risk of switching is minimized. There is also recent evidence for an independent antidepressant action for at least one atypical antipsychotic. Therefore, the conclusion from this review, in contrast to previous suggestions, is that a combination of an atypical antipsychotic and either an SSRI or lamotrigine may provide a useful first-line treatment for depressed bipolar disorder patients. Further research is clearly required to examine this approach and compare it with other possible treatment options.", 
    "107": "In spite of conflicting reports, there is emerging evidence that at least two of the atypical antipsychotics, clozapine and olanzapine, are associated with an increased risk of developing glucose dysregulation or new onset diabetes mellitus. We report on the management of six patients who developed diabetes mellitus following treatment with olanzapine, five of whom had independent risk factors for diabetes. Olanzapine was changed to quetiapine in all patients with improvement in glycaemic control in two patients. In view of the uncertainty of the size and mechanism of the link between olanzapine and diabetes, we discuss issues surrounding routine clinical management and monitoring of patients on antipsychotics and the clinical implications.", 
    "108": "Evidence suggests atypical antipsychotic treatment is associated with a lower incidence of tardive dyskinesia (TD) than typical antipsychotic drugs, and is a potential antidyskinetic treatment. We present the case of a middle-aged woman never previously exposed to antipsychotic treatment who developed TD after 6 months of olanzapine monotherapy. Substitution of quetiapine for olanzapine alleviated her TD symptoms. The case demonstrates that atypical antipsychotic drugs have different effects in relation to TD. Potential psychopharmacological mechanisms explaining these differences are discussed, highlighting the importance of D2 receptor occupancy by atypical antipsychotic drugs for TD.", 
    "109": "We studied 60 patients receiving a 1-year course of interferon (IFN)-alpha therapy for chronic viral hepatitis. Patients underwent psychiatric assessment before starting the IFN-alpha therapy, and monthly throughout the therapy, using the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-III-R, the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory and the Spielberg State and Trait Anxiety Inventory. Five patients had a baseline diagnosis of major depression and 18 (30%) developed an IFN-alpha-induced psychiatric adverse effect; 12 of these 23 patients received psychopharmacological treatment (patients and clinicians jointly decided the need for treatment). Two of the five patients with baseline depression started an antidepressant treatment (paroxetine) together with the IFN-alpha and successfully completed the IFN-alpha therapy. Ten patients received treatment for the IFN-alpha-induced psychiatric adverse effects (depression in five patients, anxiety in two patients, severe irritability in two patients and insomnia in one patient). Depression was treated with paroxetine, amisulpride or levosulpiride; anxiety and insomnia were treated with benzodiazepines; and irritability was treated with thioridazine. Individual response to medications was measured with the Clinical Global Impression scale. Of the patients with IFN-alpha-induced depression, two received paroxetine (one showed a good response), two received amisulpride (one showed a good response) and one did not respond to levosulpiride but responded to paroxetine. The patients experiencing anxiety or insomnia responded well to benzodiazepines. One patient showed a good response, and one a poor response, to thioridazine for irritability. Only one patient interrupted the therapy because of psychiatric adverse effects. Overall, the 12 patients that received psychopharmacological treatment developed less severe psychopathological symptoms during the IFN-alpha therapy compared to the 11 patients who had untreated baseline depression or untreated IFN-alpha-induced psychiatric adverse effects. Thus, psychopharmacological management can successfully treat psychiatric symptoms in patients who are receiving IFN-alpha.", 
    "110": "The effect of diazepam on blood glucose concentration (BGC) was investigated in a double-blind cross-over study in 10 healthy and 10 non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects taking oral hypoglycemic drugs. In the first session, fasting blood samples were taken for blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin estimation and at 60, 80, 95, 125, and 155 minutes thereafter for glucose estimation. In another 2 sessions, a venous sample was taken immediately before premedication (5 mg diazepam or placebo randomly given during breakfast). One hour later a blood sample was taken, and the volunteers were submitted to periodontal treatment after injection of 1.8 mL of 2% mepivacaine with 1:100,000 adrenaline. Venous blood samples were taken at 15, 30, 60, and 90 minutes after injection. The changes in BGC were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures; the means were compared using Tukey test (P = .05). Statistically significant differences in the BGC were observed between diabetic and nondiabetic groups (P = .00003). However, there were no significant differences among the sessions of the same group (P = .29). The results of this study show that a single dose of 5 mg diazepam before dental treatment does not influence BGC in nondiabetic and non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects.", 
    "111": "Disabilities caused by behavioral problems can be potentially devastating in cognitively impaired patients. These behavioral symptoms can be a major cause of stress, anxiety, and concern for caregivers. While psychotropic drugs are frequently used to control these symptoms, they can be accompanied by significant side effects, which include sedation, disinhibition, depression, falls, incontinence, parkinsonism, and akathisias. Agitation is a major problem in older patients with dementia. Agitation and aggression have always been difficult behaviors to manage, and when it is severe, agitation can be a behavioral emergency that requires urgent and immediate intervention. This six-month study included a group of 94 outpatients (48 men and 46 women) who had a diagnosis of subcortical vascular dementia (VaD). To be eligible for the study, patients needed a score of at least 3 for agitation/aggression on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), suggesting at least moderate frequency and/or severity, and 0 for delusions and hallucinations. Patients were divided into two homogenous groups. Group A received olanzapine (2.5-5 mg/day) and Group B received bromazepam (0.25 percent, 15 drops, three times per day). Patients in both groups were allowed to continue any previous therapy. Patients receiving olanzapine at an average dose of 3.21 +/- 1.02 mg/day showed statistically significant improvement on the anxiety rating compared with those receiving bromazepam. Our patients had a host of medical conditions and received numerous concomitant medications. Given the potential complications associated with these therapeutic agents, these patients tolerated olanzapine quite well. It appeared that adverse events, particularly somnolence, postural instability, and postural hypotension, were mild and transient. Moreover, no anticholinerigic effect was registered. These findings suggest that olanzapine could be a safe and effective treatment for anxiety in cognitively impaired patients.",

    "126": "Our principal objective in this study was to evaluate the potential pain reducing effect of i.v. midazolam in patients undergoing oral surgery. One-hundred-twenty-five patients with impacted mandibular third molars requiring removal under local anesthetic were randomized into 2 groups. The first group (n = 64) was administered i.v. midazolam by titration until a clinical end-point of conscious sedation followed by local anesthetic before surgery; the second group (n = 61) was the control and was administered only local anesthetic before surgery. The surgery was performed in a standardized manner in both groups by the same surgeon. Outcome measures were four primary end-points: pain intensity as assessed by a 100-mm visual analogue scale and a 4-point categorized scale hourly for 8 h, time to first analgesic, total analgesic (ibuprofen) consumption over the first 48 h, and a 5-point categorical patient global assessment scale (0 = poor, 1 = fair, 2 = good, 3 = very good, and 4 = excellent). Throughout the 8-h investigation period, patients in the midazolam group reported significantly lower pain intensity scores than those in the control group (19.0 +/- 13.2 mm versus 28.1 +/- 12.8 mm, P < 0.05). The patients in the midazolam group also reported significantly longer time to first analgesic (165.5 +/- 56.5 min versus 202.2 +/- 79.0 min, P < 0.05), less analgesic consumption (1275 +/- 364 mg versus 1688 +/- 407 mg, P < 0.001) and better patient global assessment (3.34 +/- 0.8 versus 2.4 +/- 0.9, P < 0.001).

Children undergoing outpatient surgery were randomized to 3 groups: interactive music therapy (n = 51), oral midazolam (n = 34), or control (n = 38). The primary outcome of the study was children's perioperative anxiety. We found that children who received midazolam were significantly less anxious during the induction of anesthesia than children in the music therapy and control groups (P = 0.015 and P = 0.005, respectively). We found no difference in anxiety during the induction of anesthesia between children in the music therapy group and children in the control group. An analysis controlling for therapist revealed a significant therapist effect; i.e., children treated by one of the therapists were significantly less anxious than children in the other therapist group and the control group on separation to the operating room (OR) (P < 0.05) and on entrance to the OR (P < 0.05), but not on the introduction of the anesthesia mask (P = not significant). Children in the midazolam group were the least anxious even after controlling for therapist effect (P < 0.05).

Consequently, atypical antipsychotics have been increasingly used in children and adolescents. Because most information now available on pediatric use comes from case reports and small open-label studies rather than large controlled trials, treatment in pediatric patients is often guided by experience with adults or based on limited evidence in youths. Although the literature contains reports on the use of each agent in this class in children, risperidone has been the focus of the greatest number of reports. However, the atypical antipsychotics are not interchangeable; each has a unique pharmacologic profile and may differ considerably in terms of adverse effects.

[(11)C]PK11195 has been widely used for the in vivo imaging of PBRs, but its signal in the brain was not high enough for stable quantitative analysis. We synthesized a novel positron emission tomography (PET) ligand, [(11)C]DAA1106, for PBR and investigated its in vivo properties in rat and monkey brain. High uptake of [(11)C]DAA1106 was observed in the olfactory bulb and choroid plexus area, followed by the pons/medulla and cerebellum by in vivo autoradiography of rat brain, correlating with the binding in vitro. [(11)C]DAA1106 binding was increased in the dorsal hippocampus with neural destruction, suggesting glial reaction. [(11)C]DAA1106 binding was both inhibited and displaced by 1.0 mg/kg of DAA1106 and 5 mg/kg of PK11195 by 80% and 70%, respectively. Specific binding was estimated as 80% of total binding. [(11)C]DAA1106 binding was four times higher compared to the binding of [(11)C]PK11195 in the monkey occipital cortex.

To evaluate potentially different risk factors, we performed a post mortem case-control study in old persons who developed high-grade pressure sores within six months until 14 days before death. Consecutive cases with pressure sores grade >/=3 and potential controls at comparably high risk for pressure sores were examined before cremation. After written informed consent had been obtained by the next relatives, all available nursing and medical records of the deceased were thoroughly evaluated. Cases and controls were matched according to age, gender, immobility, and cachexia.A total of 100 cases with 71 pressure sores grade 3 and 29 pressure sores grade 4 were compared to 100 controls with 27 pressure sores grade </=2 and maximal risk as assessed by the Norton scale. The mean age was 86 years, 80% were females, 86% were bedridden, and cachexia was found in 66%. The cases were more often seriously disabled, had more often contractions of joints, and were on more drugs with intended or unwanted depressive/sedative effects (neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, centrally acting analgesics). Patient's impaired ability or low intention to comply/cooperate with preventive and/or therapeutic measures was more often recorded in cases than controls.A high degree of disablement and immobility, in particular, are risk factors for high-grade pressure sores in frail older high-risk persons. Sedative drug effects and impaired patient compliance with preventive and therapeutic measures may also be associated with the development of high-grade pressure sores in old persons at high risk.",

The dosage of 0.15 micro g/kg/min was adapted to changing intraoperative pain (range 0.08-0.30 micro g/kg/min). Preoperative sedation with midazolam 2 mg was given 5 min prior to ureteroscopy. The efficacy of monitored anesthesia care (\"Big MAC\") was quantified by the patient using a visual analogue pain scale. A total of 97.1% (136/140) of the procedures were performed and finished under remifentanil. Only four male patients underwent conversion to general anesthesia due to insufficient analgesia. All but one patient would choose remifentanil again for first line anesthesia. Significant differences in pain scale values were noticed for male/female patients and ureteroscopies above/below the iliac vessel crossing. Side effects were rare being mainly hypoxic events (pO(2)<90% in 5.1%). Indication, intraoperative procedure, average surgery time (24 min), complications and primary success rate (96.6/90/63.3% stone free for distal/mid/proximal ureter, respectively) did not differ from the control group under general anesthesia. Ureteroscopies with remifentanil are safe, universally applicable because of refifentanil's organ independent esterase metabolism and as effective as general anesthesia. There is no need for PACU stay for patients due to the ultra-short drug half-life, and therefore remifentanil is cost effective and perfect in an outpatient setting.", 
    "135": "Although neurosteroids have rapid effects on GABA(A) receptors, study of steroid actions at GABA receptors has been hampered by a lack of pharmacological antagonists. In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of a steroid analog, (3alpha,5alpha)-17-phenylandrost-16-en-3-ol (17PA), that selectively antagonized neurosteroid potentiation of GABA responses. We examined 17PA using the alpha1beta2gamma2 subunit combination expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. 17PA had little or no effect on baseline GABA responses but antagonized both the response augmentation and the direct gating of GABA receptors by 5alpha-reduced potentiating steroids. The effect was selective for 5alpha-reduced potentiating steroids; 5beta-reduced potentiators were only weakly affected. Likewise, 17PA did not affect barbiturate and benzodiazepine potentiation. 17PA acted primarily by shifting the concentration response for steroid potentiation to the right, suggesting the possibility of a competitive component to the antagonism. 17PA also antagonized 5alpha-reduced steroid potentiation and gating in hippocampal neurons and inhibited anesthetic actions in X. laevis tadpoles. Analogous to benzodiazepine site antagonists, the development of neurosteroid antagonists may help clarify the role of GABA-potentiating neurosteroids in health and disease.",

At 100 microM, 6-methylflavone enhanced the response to 5 microM GABA by 183+/-20% at alpha1beta2gamma2L GABAA receptors. The methyl substituent was important since the parent flavone was significantly weaker as a positive modulator (103+/-24% enhancement of 5 microM GABA by 100 microM flavone). This enhancement is not mediated via high-affinity benzodiazepine sites as it was not inhibited by the classical benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil under conditions where flumazenil inhibits the potentiation of the GABA response to diazepam. 6-Methylflavone (60 microM) did not significantly affect the GABA dose-response curve at rho1 GABAC receptors. 6-Methylflavone acts as a positive modulator of recombinant GABAA receptors at sites independent of flumazenil-sensitive benzodiazepine sites.",

In addition, the parameters of glucose assimilation were significantly decreased as compared with placebo in the subgroup of 7 subjects with plasma clonazepam concentrations higher than 6.0 ng ml-1 (median and lower limit of effective therapeutic concentrations): 1.37 +/- 0.3 versus 2.84 +/- 0.60 x 10(-2)min-1 (P = 0.028) for the coefficient of glucose tolerance (Kg), 2.18 +/- 0.29 versus 3.71 +/- 0.89 x 10(-4)microUml-1min-1 (P = 0.018) for insulin sensitivity (Si) and 1.80 +/- 0.39 versus 3.59 +/- 0.71 x 10(-2)min-1 (P = 0.028) for glucose effectiveness at basal insulin (Sg). These parameters were not significantly modified when diazepam was administered; plasma levels of this drug however, were below the effective therapeutic concentrations (300 ng ml-1) from min 15 after the end of the perfusion.",

This group demonstrated antiepileptic effects after subacute electrical stimulation (130 Hz, 450 micros, 200-400 microA), applied continuously during 16 to 20 days in PHC. Values were compared with those obtained from patients with severe MTLE (history of 21.7 +/- 2.8 years and seizure frequency of 28.2 +/- 14 per month) in whom electrical stimulation did not induce antiepileptic effects (ESWAE group, n = 4), patients with MTLE in whom no electrical stimulation was applied (MTLE group, n = 4), and autopsy material acquired from subjects without epilepsy (n = 4 obtained from three subjects).", 
    "151": "The ESAE group demonstrated high GABA tissue levels (219%), as well as a significantly higher cell count (58.5%) when compared with the MTLE group. The ESWAE group showed enhanced BZD-receptor levels (38%), whereas their values for GABA tissue levels and GABA(A) receptor were similar to those obtained from the MTLE group.",

    "153": "A 72-year-old male patient with Parkinson's disease referred to the Dental Hospital of Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan, presented with movement of an implant-supported prosthesis, slight pain, and purulent drainage from the gingiva in the anterior region of the maxilla, where implants had been placed more than 20 years earlier. He requested that the mobile implant and prosthesis be removed and was in need of implant therapy in his maxilla. In addition to Parkinson's disease the patient had a severe gag reflex, which made treatment difficult. A total of 6 treatments were required. New implants were successfully placed while the patient was under anesthesia (a combination of intravenously administered 3% prilocaine hydrochloride and vasopressin); midazolam was also administered intravenously. The results of this case indicate that use of regional anesthesia in combination with midazolam can be recommended for implant surgery in patients with Parkinson's disease. Intravenous midazolam can be considered the sedative of choice for the surgical treatment of patients suffering from systemic disease.", 
    "154": "Adiponectin is a recently identified adipocyte-derived protein, which is associated with glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity and adiposity. The aim of this study was to explore the alterations in serum adiponectin concentration during treatment with olanzapine or risperidone. Serum concentrations of adiponectin were investigated in body mass index (BMI, kg/m2)- and age-matched groups of non-diabetic, non-obese schizophrenic patients receiving a stable dose of olanzapine (n = 18) or risperidone (n = 15) for 4 weeks or more, and of mentally and physically healthy volunteers (n = 17). Patients undergoing treatment with olanzapine or risperidone had significantly higher adiponectin concentrations than the healthy volunteers, even after controlling for BMI. Adiponectin concentrations decreased with increasing BMI in patients taking olanzapine, while elevated levels were observed in patients taking risperidone, regardless of adiposity. This preliminary cross-sectional study indicates that adiponectin is involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism and weight in schizophrenic patients during treatment with olanzapine or risperidone, presumably showing a normalizing effect on metabolic abnormality.", 
    "155": "Several recent studies, albeit limited in sample number, design and generalizability, have suggested that augmentation of atypical antipsychotic medication (such as clozapine and olanzapine) with sulpiride, a substituted benzamide antipsychotic medication, may play a role in the management of treatment-resistant psychotic conditions. The objective of this study was to investigate any change in clinical symptomatology or side-effect profile in treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients receiving sulpiride in addition to olanzapine. Seventeen patients with treatment-resistant chronic schizophrenia, who were receiving olanzapine monotherapy for at least 6 months before study commencement, were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either adjunctive treatment with sulpiride (study group) or to continue their pre-study treatment with olanzapine with no medication augmentation (control group), each for a period of 8 weeks. Changes in measures of positive and negative symptoms, anxiety, depression and extrapyramidal symptoms were assessed at baseline and at 8 weeks. Study observations indicated no significant differences in the changes in positive or negative symptomatology between patients receiving a combined regimen of olanzapine with sulpiride (600 mg/ day) augmentation and controls. However, a significantly greater improvement of depressive symptomatology (P < 0.05; as assessed by the Hamilton Scale for Depression) was noted in the sulpiride augmentation group. These data indicate improvement in depressive symptomatology with sulpiride augmentation of olanzapine in treatment-resistant chronic schizophrenia patients.", 
    "156": "Olanzapine increases brain allopregnanolone (ALLO) levels sufficiently to modulate neuronal activity by allosterically regulating GABAA receptors. Recently, we reported the antipsychotic-like profile of ALLO in rodents. The present study examined the hypothesis that olanzapine-induced elevation of endogenous neurosteroid ALLO is vital for its neuroleptic-like action. The conditioned avoidance response (CAR) and apomorphine-induced climbing behavioral paradigms were used in rodents. Administration of ALLO (1 microg, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)) or neurosteroidogenic agents such as the mitochondrial diazepam binding inhibitor receptor agonist, FGIN 1-27 (0.5 microg, i.c.v.) or the ALLO precursor, progesterone (10 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly potentiated olanzapine-induced blockade of CAR and apomorphine-induced climbing. In contrast, these agents failed to alter the antipsychotic-like effect of risperidone and haloperidol. On the other hand, inhibition of the endogenous biosynthesis of neurosteroids by the 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor, trilostane (30 mg/kg, i.p.), the 3alpha-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase inhibitor, indomethacin (5 mg/kg, i.p.), or the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) (1 mg/kg, i.p.) blocked the effect of olanzapine, but not of risperidone and haloperidol. Socially isolated animals, known to exhibit decreased brain ALLO and GABAA receptor functions, displayed a shortening in the muscimol-induced loss of righting reflex and an increased susceptibility to apomorphine-induced climbing. Administration of olanzapine, but not of haloperidol and risperidone, normalized the duration of muscimol-elicited loss of righting reflex. Although all three antipsychotics proved capable of antagonizing the apomorphine-induced climbing, a dose almost five times higher of olanzapine was required in socially isolated animals. The data obtained suggest that enhancement of the GABAergic tone plays a key role in the antipsychotic-like effect exerted by olanzapine in rodents, likely as a consequence of augmented levels of neuroactive steroids, in particular ALLO, in the brain. The present findings provide the first specific behavioral evidence in support of the hypothesis that neuroactive steroid ALLO- mediated GABAergic modulation is essential for the antipsychotic-like action of olanzapine.",

The procedure utilises butyl chloride extraction at alkaline pH followed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography. The technique is suitable for screening analyses and confirmation of identity of the benzodiazepines at their lowest reported therapeutic concentrations using 500 microL of blood. The method has been successfully applied in forensic cases involving low concentrations of benzodiazepines.",

The principal measure of effect size was the standardized difference between means on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS).", 
    "167": "For the HDS score, the pooled effect size from the random-effects model was 0.38 (95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.58). Heterogeneity of effect on HDS across studies was significant (P <.02), and studies with low placebo response showed larger effects. Moderator analysis suggested that diagnostic methods and concurrent psychosocial interventions influenced outcome. Studies with larger depression effect sizes (>0.5) demonstrated favorable effects of medication on measures of quantity of substance use, but rates of sustained abstinence were low.", 
    "168": "Antidepressant medication exerts a modest beneficial effect for patients with combined depressive- and substance-use disorders. It is not a stand-alone treatment, and concurrent therapy directly targeting the addiction is also indicated. More research is needed to understand variations in the strength of the effect, but the data suggest that care be exercised in the diagnosis of depression-either by observing depression to persist during at least a brief period of abstinence or through efforts by clinical history to screen out substance-related depressive symptoms.", 
    "169": "The diazepam (DZ)-omeprazole (OMP) interaction has been selected as a prototype for an important drug-drug interaction involving cytochrome P450 inhibition. The availability of an in vivo K(i) value (unbound K(i), 21 microM) obtained from a series of steady-state inhibitor infusion studies allowed assessment of several in vitro-derived predictions of this inhibition interaction. Studies monitoring substrate depletion with time were used to obtain in vitro K(i) values that were evaluated against the more traditional metabolite formation approach using microsomes and hepatocytes. OMP inhibited the metabolism of DZ to its primary metabolites 4'-hydroxydiazepam, 3-hydroxydiazepam, and nordiazepam to different extents over a range of concentrations (0.3-150 microM), and a competitive inhibition model best fitted the data. The K(i) values observed using the substrate depletion approach (16 +/- 3 microM and 7 +/- 2 microM in microsomes and hepatocytes, respectively) were in good agreement with the overall weighted K(i) values obtained using the standard metabolite formation approach (12 +/- 2 microM and 16 +/- 5 microM in microsomes and hepatocytes, respectively). In vitro binding and cell uptake studies as well as human serum albumin studies in hepatocytes confirmed the importance of both intracellular and extracellular unbound concentrations of inhibitor when considering inhibition predictions. Both kinetic approaches and both in vitro systems predicted the in vivo interaction well and provide a good example of the ability of in vitro inhibition studies to quantitatively predict an in vivo drug-drug interaction successfully.", 
    "170": "1. A high-throughput assay utilizing the voltage/ion probe reader (VIPR) technology identified salicylidene salicylhydrazide (SCS) as being a potent selective inhibitor of alpha2beta1gamma1 GABA(A) receptors with a maximum inhibition of 56+/-5% and an IC(50) of 32 (23, 45) nm. 2. Evaluation of this compound using patch-clamp electrophysiological techniques demonstrated that the compound behaved in a manner selective for receptors containing the beta1 subunit (e.g. maximum inhibition of 68.1+/-2.7% and IC(50) value of 5.3 (4.4, 6.5) nm on alpha2beta1gamma1 receptors). The presence of a beta1 subunit was paramount for the inhibition with changes between alpha1 and alpha2, gamma1 and gamma2, and the presence of a subunit having little effect. 3. On all subtypes, SCS produced incomplete inhibition with the greatest level of inhibition at alpha1beta1gamma1 receptors (74.3+/-1.4%). SCS displayed no use or voltage dependence, suggesting that it does not bind within the channel region. Concentration - response curves to GABA in the presence of SCS revealed a reduction in the maximum response with no change in the EC(50) or Hill coefficient. In addition, SCS inhibited pentobarbitone-induced currents. 4. Threonine 255, located within transmembrane domain (TM) 1, and isoleucine 308, located extracellularly just prior to TM3, were required for inhibition by SCS. 5. SCS did not compete with the known allosteric modulators, picrotoxin, pregnenolone sulphate, dehydroepiandrosterone 3-sulphate, bicuculline, loreclezole or mefenamic acid. Neither was the inhibition by SCS influenced by the benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil. 6. In conclusion, SCS is unique in selectively inhibiting GABA(A) receptors containing the beta1 subunit via an allosteric mechanism. The importance of threonine 255 and isoleucine 308 within the beta1 subunit and the lack of interaction with a range of GABA(A) receptor modulators suggests that SCS is interacting at a previously unidentified site.", 
    "171": "Interactions between alcohol and traditional benzodiazepine anxiolytics hamper the treatment of alcoholism-related anxiety disorders. Serotonin 5-HT(2) receptor antagonists, such as deramciclane, are anxiolytic, and considering their pharmacological profile, they might benefit alcoholics with comorbid anxiety. We studied the effects of acute deramciclane (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg i.p.) on alcohol drinking of alcohol-preferring AA rats drinking 10% (vol/vol) ethanol solution in a 4-h limited-access paradigm. Thereafter, a 5-day repeated-treatment experiment was carried out, under corresponding test design, with deramciclane (3 mg/kg i.p.) as a test drug and midazolam (1 mg/kg i.p.) as a benzodiazepine reference compound. Deramciclane had no effect on alcohol consumption in either acute or repeated dosing study. Midazolam increased ethanol drinking, as expected, when administered on successive days. A modified functional observational battery (FOB) procedure was applied to study neurological, behavioural and autonomic effects induced by deramciclane (1-30 mg/kg po) and diazepam (1-30 mg/kg po) in mice at 30 min, 2 h and 4 h after dosing. Deramciclane had a mild dopamine D(2) receptor antagonism-like effect at the highest dose. The effects of diazepam were predictable, myorelaxation-induced motor impairment and anxiolysis-related hyperlocomotion in a novel environment being the characteristic features at the two highest doses. Deramciclane appears to be a safe and well-tolerated drug and we suggest that it might be useful in the treatment of anxiety in alcoholics.",

    "173": "Baseline PANSS data from six double-blind, randomized registration trials of olanzapine, three in schizophrenia and three in acute bipolar mania, were used in these post-hoc analyses. Schizophrenia study data were pooled and randomly split in half. Exploratory principal component factor analysis was performed on half of the data. Factors were extracted based on minimum eigenvalue criteria (eigenvalue> or =1); loadings were determined using an equamax rotation. Confirmatory principal component factor analysis was performed on the other half of the data, retaining the original number of factors. Principal component factor analysis was also done for the pooled bipolar studies.

The mania-like excitement factor was represented by four items (uncooperativeness, poor impulse control, excitement, and hostility), with only moderate loadings by tension and suspiciousness/persecution. Results were similar in the confirmatory analysis and the pooled bipolar studies. Change from baseline to endpoint for the mania-like factor correlated reasonably well (0.64-0.78) with change in Y-MRS scores in the bipolar studies. At baseline, bipolar patients scored higher than patients with schizophrenia on three of four PANSS mania-like factor items: poor impulse control, excitement, and hostility; the converse was true for most other PANSS items.", 
    "175": "Factor analyses of the PANSS consistently uncovered an excitement factor including uncooperativeness, poor impulse control, excitement, and hostility items.

This study investigates the effects in mice of an acute betaCCM injection on retrieval of previously acquired serial discriminations, involving distinct contextual cues (Contextual Serial Discrimination, CSD) or identical cues (Serial Spatial Discrimination, SSD) in a four-hole board. Animals submitted to CSD were also evaluated for emotional reactivity in an elevated-plus maze. In both the CSD and the SSD tasks, mice were injected with saline before the learning session began. Twenty-four hours later, mice were replaced on the hole-board following a single dose of saline or betaCCM (0.5 mg/kg or 1.5 mg/kg) injected 20 min before testing. The highest dose of betaCCM improved performance of the first discrimination in the contextual task but not in the spatial task. Moreover, the higher dose of betaCCM produced anxiety-like reactivity in an elevated-plus maze, and scores of 'anxiety' were positively correlated with memory scores. Overall, the data show that the betaCCM enhancement of memory processes depends on: (1) the cues associated with the to-be-remembered information; and (2) the emotional effects of the drug.",
