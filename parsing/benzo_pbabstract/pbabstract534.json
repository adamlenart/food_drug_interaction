    "0": "The distribution of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (MChRs) was studied in visual areas of cat brain using in vitro quantitative autoradiography with 1 nM N-[3H]methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS) as a radioligand. The highest density of [3H]NMS binding was observed in lamina A of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and in layer II/III of the visual cortex. The lowest binding was seen in the stratum griseum intermediale of the superior colliculus (SC). The comparison of inhibition of [3H]NMS binding by 100 microM carbachol and 300 nM pirenzepine showed that the SC and LGN contain predominantly M2 sites. M1 sites constitute the main population of MChRs in the cortical areas studied.", 
    "1": "Serum binding of pipequaline, a new anxiolytic drug, was studied in vitro by equilibrium dialysis. The percent binding in serum is high, 96.3%, and remains constant within the range of therapeutic concentrations. Investigations performed on isolated proteins with a wide range of concentrations showed one site with a high affinity constant (Ka = 450,000 M-1) for alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and two sites with a lower affinity constant (Ka = 58,000 M-1) for human serum albumin. Binding to lipoproteins was saturable, with an affinity constant of 22,000 less than or equal to Ka less than or equal to 35,000 M-1. Over the range of therapeutic concentrations, the ratio of pipequaline concentrations in serum and red blood cells remained constant (14.4%) and was shown to be dependent on the free fraction of pipequaline in serum.", 
    "2": "Diazepam's impact on kainic acid seizure-induced local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) was assessed by a quantitative [14C]2-deoxyglucose method. Male rats were injected i.p. with either kainic acid (12 mg/kg) or its vehicle, 3 or 48 h before LCGU determination. Diazepam (3.2 mg/kg) or its vehicle were injected i.m. 15 min before, 1 and 2.5 h after kainic acid. Diazepam blocked kainic acid-induced overt convulsions, attenuated LCGU increases at 3 h and prevented 48 h LCGU decreases in piriform cortex and amygdala. LCGU in (% of vehicle): CA3 (438%), CA4 (537%) and CA1-ventral (340%) of hippocampus, interpeduncular nucleus (200%) and lateral lemniscus (213%) were still significantly above vehicle levels in the 3 h diazepam-kainic acid group. These results suggest that diazepam suppresses the spread of kainic acid-induced seizure activity from the proposed CA3 epileptogenic focus. In addition, diazepam reduces, but does not abolish, hypermetabolic activity at the foci itself.", 
    "3": "Electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) of the rat can produce both analgesia and aversive reactions. To determine if these two effects can be dissociated, diazepam, a benzodiazepine, was administered to rats chronically implanted with electrodes in the PAG. The threshold for stimulation-produced analgesia or aversion, whichever was lowest, was determined before and after drug administration. Diazepam (1 mg/kg) attenuated stimulation-produced aversive reactions at 12 of 20 stimulation sites, allowing analgesia to be measured at the same threshold. Diazepam did not alter baseline pain sensitivity or thresholds for stimulation-produced analgesia. These results indicate that aversive reactions and analgesia from PAG stimulation can be pharmacologically dissociated.", 
    "4": "The purpose of these experiments was to initiate investigations of the brain site(s) at which the benzodiazepines exert their anticonvulsant effect. We examined the effects of microinjections of clonazepam into substantia nigra (SN) on seizure threshold in the kindling model. We also examined the distribution of microinjected [3H]methylclonazepam with autoradiographic methods. Microinjection of clonazepam bilaterally into substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR), but not nearby, produced a 75% elevation of generalized seizure threshold. Quantitative analysis of autoradiographic studies indicated that the vast majority of [3H]methylclonazepam was distributed within 400 micron of the injection cannula tip; even optimally placed injections did not result in drug access throughout the entire SN. The data demonstrate that local application of an anticonvulsant benzodiazepine to the substantia nigra alone is sufficient to suppress seizures. We suggest that the substantia nigra is one site at which systemically administered benzodiazepines act to suppress seizures.", 
    "5": "Five members of a novel series of quinoline derivatives which all have similar activities on benzodiazepine receptor binding in vitro were compared in a food-motivated conflict and stress-induced ultrasounds models of anxiety and on suprahyoid muscle twitching in urethane-anaesthetised rats. RU 42382, RU 43028 and RU 39419 showed anxiolytic activity in both tests and RU 40410 was an antagonist. RU 40744 inhibited stress-induced ultrasounds but had little activity in the conflict test. Amphetamine-induced suprahyoid muscle twitching was only weakly inhibited by RU 42382 and RU 43028 in comparison with a classical benzodiazepine agonist. Ro15-1788 antagonised RU 42382 indicating that a major component of its action was agonism at benzodiazepine receptors. RU 39419 had no effect, RU 40744 tended to increase and RU 40410 evoked a small but statistically significant increase in twitching. The same rank order was observed in antagonism of a benzodiazepine in the muscle twitching model. RU 42382 was least effective as an antagonist and RU 40410 most effective. RU 39419 had no effect alone but antagonised the decrease of firing rate of cerebellar Purkinje cells induced by a benzodiazepine in urethane-anaesthetised rats. Comparison of in vivo occupancy of benzodiazepine receptors and efficacy in the conflict test in rats suggests a ranking of agonist intrinsic activity: RU 42382 greater than RU 43028 greater than RU 39419. A simple relationship between intrinsic activity at benzodiazepine receptors and structure of the compounds is proposed.", 
    "6": "Intrathecal (IT) administration of pilocarpine to mice produces a vigorous and dose-related reciprocal hindlimb scratching (RHS) response (ED50 = 0.6 microgram) that is potently blocked by simultaneous IT administration of atropine (ID50 = 0.002 microgram). We now report that RHS is (1) also elicited by the more selective M1 agonist McN-A-343-11 (ED50 = 11.6 micrograms), (2) blocked by the selective M1 antagonist pirenzepine (ID50 = 0.001 microgram), and (3) is not blocked by the selective M2 antagonist AF-DX 116 BS at a dose up to 100 times the ID50 dose of pirenzepine. These results extend our earlier findings and suggest that the RHS elicited in mice by IT injection of muscarinic agonists is mediated through pirenzepine-sensitive (presumably M1) receptors and that RHS may be a convenient in vivo centrally mediated M1 endpoint.", 
    "7": "In a double-blind, randomised trial two drug regimens were compared in a group of 129 patients with uncomplicated duodenal ulcers, 64 receiving cimetidine (800 mg) and pirenzepine (50 mg) at bed-time, 65 receiving cimetidine (800 mg) and a placebo at bed-time. Neither statistically nor clinically was there an important difference in effectiveness and tolerance between the two drug regimens.", 
    "8": "Ultrasonic distress calls elicited in male rats by footshock under inescapable conditions were suppressed by diazepam. The suppression was blocked by pretreatment with Ro15-1788 or CGS8216, selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonists, while an opiate antagonist naloxone failed to modify the effect of diazepam. In contrast, naloxone antagonized but Ro15-1788 and CGS8216 did not antagonize beta-endorphin which also suppressed the ultrasonic vocalization. These findings suggest that benzodiazepine and opioid receptors may contribute separately to antianxiety activity.", 
    "9": "In the present study, we examined the effect of various agents which affect in a different manner the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor-chloride ionophore complex system in relation to the immobile behavior of mice in the forced swimming test. The benzodiazepines diazepam and flurazepam, the barbiturates pentobarbital and phenobarbital, zopiclone and beta-CCP (propyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) enhanced the immobile behavior in a dose-dependent manner. In the doses used here, these agents produced almost no muscle relaxant action. Ro15-1788 and beta-CCM (methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) themselves had no effect on the duration of immobility. However, Ro15-1788 and beta-CCM reversed the enhancing effect produced by all 6 drugs. These results indicate that the enhancement of the duration of immobility of mice may be somehow correlated to the anxiolytic action but not to the muscle relaxant action. The effect may be mainly mediated by the benzodiazepine receptor, which forms a part of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor-chloride ionophore complex. Furthermore it is suggested that there were behavioral similarities in the effects of beta-CCP and benzodiazepines.", 
    "10": "Brain sigma-type receptors and phencyclidine receptors are thought to mediate the psychotomimetic effects of benzomorphans and phencyclidine in humans. Recently, we reported the characterization of a selective sigma receptor ligand, 1,3-di-o-tolyl-guanidine (DTG), that shows negligible crossreactivity with phencyclidine receptors. Here we describe the synthesis and characterization of an isothiocyanate derivative of DTG, di-o-tolyl-guanidine-isothiocyanate (DIGIT). Guinea pig brain membranes treated with nanomolar doses of DIGIT followed by extensive washing exhibit a dose dependent reduction of [3H]DTG and (+)[3H]3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl)piperidine [+)[3H]3-PPP) binding to sigma receptors. Binding of radiolabelled ligands for phencyclidine, mu-opioid, benzodiazepine and dopamine-D2 receptors is not affected by membrane treatment with DIGIT, indicating specificity of the affinity label for sigma-type receptors. Treatment of DIGIT-derivatized membranes with 2 M NaCl does not result in recovery of sigma binding activity, suggesting that DIGIT's interaction with sigma receptors is not of an ionic nature. Equilibrium saturation binding experiments show that the inhibition of [3H]DTG binding to sigma receptors by DIGIT pretreatment of membranes is attributable to an irreversible reduction in the affinity (increase in Kd) of sigma receptors for DTG. The finding that sigma receptors are irreversibly modified by DIGIT whereas phencyclidine receptors are not affected suggests that sigma receptors are physically separate from phencyclidine receptors. The availability of a selective affinity label for the sigma receptor should facilitate the purification of the receptors and the characterization of sigma-type pharmacological effects in vivo and in vitro.", 
    "11": "The in vitro binding properties of the novel muscarinic antagonist [3H]AF-DX 116 were studied using a rapid filtration technique. Association and dissociation rates of [3H]AF-DX 116 binding were rapid at 25 degrees C (2.74 and 2.70 X 10(7) min-1 M-1 for K+1; 0.87 and 0.93 min-1 for k-1) but 20-40 times slower at 0-4 degrees C (0.13 and 0.096 X 10(7) min-1 M-1 for k+1; 0.031 and 0.022 min-1 for k-1 in cerebral cortical and cardiac membranes, respectively). Kinetic dissociation constants (Kds) were estimated to be 31.8 nM and 30.9 nM at 25 degrees C; 23.1 nM and 0-4 degrees C for the cerebral cortex and heart, respectively. In saturation studies, [3H]AF-DX 116 labeled 29 percent of the total [3H](-)QNB binding sites in the cerebral cortical membranes and 87 percent in the cardiac membranes, with Kd values of 28.9 nM and 17.9 nM, respectively. Muscarinic antagonists inhibited [3H]AF-DX 116 binding in a rank order of potency of atropine greater than dexetimide greater than AF-DX 116 greater than PZ greater than levetimide in both tissues. Except for PZ/[3H]AF-DX 116 and AF-DX 116/[3H]AF-DX 116 in the cerebral cortex, all the antagonist competition curves had Hill coefficients close to one. Carbachol and oxotremorine produced shallow inhibition curves against [3H]AF-DX 116 binding in both tissues. Regional distribution studies with [3H](-)QNB, [3H]PZ and [3H]AF-DX 116 showed that most of the muscarinic receptors in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and corpus striatum are of the M1 subtype while those in the brainstem, cerebellum and other lower brain regions are of the M2 subtype. These results indicate that [3H]AF-DX 116 is a useful probe for the study of heterogeneity of muscarinic cholinergic receptors.", 
    "12": "Patients with chronic airways obstruction have been reported as presenting with psychiatric illnesses commonly. The anxiety and depressive disorders, which are the most common psychiatric illnesses, are known significantly to affect patients' level of occupational and social function. Four cases are presented to illustrate the differing presentations of psychiatric illness in patients with chronic airways obstruction. Conventional psychiatric treatment modalities can be used successfully, in spite of severe airways obstruction, and may lead to a markedly improved quality of life for these patients.", 
    "13": "The effects of seizures induced by an acute administration of bicuculline have been investigated on the central benzodiazepine and adenosine receptors in developing rats and in adults. Generalized seizures rapidly increased the total number of both benzodiazepine binding sites and adenosine A1 receptors, without changes in receptor affinity (KD). It was concluded that such a phenomenon may facilitate the anticonvulsant action of benzodiazepine and adenosine via receptor binding and that it could be an adaptative process to protect subjects against recurrent seizures, especially in newborns.", 
    "14": "The effects of pre-treatment with vinpocetine 40 mg, on flunitrazepam-induced impairment of memory, were studied in 8 normal volunteers. Tests of Critical Flicker Fusion Threshold, a Sternberg Memory Scanning Task, along with subjective ratings of drug action were used. Drug effects were found to be modest. Treatment with vinpocetine was associated with improvements in short-term memory processes.", 
    "15": "Benzodiazepine hypnotics are used for short periods in low doses in healthy people when stressed and in patients with insomnia. This study examined psychomotor impairment in healthy young males and females after 1 and 7 nights of flunitrazepam (1 mg), nitrazepam (2.5 mg) and temazepam (10 mg). There were substantial inter-individual variations. Results showed that no drug significantly affected psychomotor performance at these doses after single or repeated administration. The number and severity of side-effects were significantly greater after the first night with temazepam and 7 nights with nitrazepam, although this may reflect a statistical artefact rather than a significant clinical finding. The difficulties in performing adequately controlled psychopharmacological studies at low doses are highlighted. Given the large intra- and inter-subject variances, small drug effects would necessitate large sample sizes (21 to 600 subjects at the 95% level of chance of detection) depending on the variable. The study suggests there is minimal impairment with low dose hypnotic drugs and a need to individualize treatment.", 
    "16": "The use of evoked potential recording is commonly employed for monitoring peripheral and central sensory functions during neurosurgical procedures. However, the neuronal structures studied must not be changed by the anesthetic agents used. In this connection, the influence of two anesthetics, fentanyl and enflurane, on evoked potentials was investigated under basic anesthesia. A total of 60 patients undergoing lumbar disc removal were included in the study. Somatosensory (SEP), auditory (AEP), and visual (VEP) evoked potentials were each recorded in 20 patients the day before operation. Basic anesthesia was induced with flunitrazepam, nitrous oxide, and pancuronium bromide. Following induction, recordings of evoked potentials were again made. One half of each group of 20 patients received increasing doses of fentanyl (1.8, 3.6, and 7.2 micrograms/kg in the somatosensory and auditory groups; 4.0 and 8.0 micrograms/kg in the visual group). The other half was given increasing inspiratory concentrations of enflurane (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 vol.%). At each level of anesthesia, SEPs, AEPs or VEPs were recorded. As compared with preoperative recordings, post-stimulus latencies were virtually unaffected by the basic anesthesia. Fentanyl caused little increase in the latencies of middle-latency-SEPs and of peak P2 of the VEPs. With enflurane, however, the latencies of the SEPs were dose-dependently prolonged, in particular those of the later components (P25 to N55). The same was true for the peak P2 in the VEPs. AEPs were not changed at all. From the results it can be concluded that enflurane, but not fentanyl, impairs impulse conduction in central synaptic pathways.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "17": "Fifty-five unpremedicated outpatients scheduled for cataract surgery were randomly allocated to receive either a fixed dose of nalbuphine and methohexitone or fentanyl and diazepam administered in a dose adjusted to produce the required sedative effect. Statistical analysis revealed no difference between groups with regard to immediate side effects, intra-ocular pressure or postoperative nausea or vomiting. Recovery time from administration of the sedative until compliance with simple commands was significantly longer in the nalbuphine/morphine group (89 vs 196 seconds) but this was not felt to be of clinical importance. This combination was better in terms of sedation at the time of insertion of the nerve blocks, lack of recall of insertion of the nerve block, incidence of intra-operative complications, surgeon's assessment of operating conditions and patient acceptability. This fixed dose by weight drug combination for intravenous sedation should be applied widely.", 
    "18": "The early pharmacokinetics of midazolam were compared in pregnant (active labour, awaiting and during elective Caesarean section) and matched gynaecological patients scheduled to undergo elective hysterectomy, half of whom were given an oxytocin infusion. A standard dose of 5 mg was given intravenously. For the first 15 minutes patients in labour had significantly higher plasma midazolam levels compared to all other groups. This was associated with the largest area under the curve (2 hours), the smallest volume of distribution and lowest clearance. Midazolam when given immediately before Caesarean section, can result in depression of the infant.", 
    "19": "The influence of midazolam and ketamine on polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocyte (PMN) adherence was investigated in vitro by using nylon fiber columns. Both a concentration of 1.0 microgram midazolam/ml blood and 0.2 microgram/ml caused a reduction of adherence. This decrease was significant (p less than 0.05) in the case of the higher dosage. The two concentrations of ketamine used (1.3 micrograms/ml resp. 0.5 microgram/ml) produced a significant reduction of adherence too. Thus both anesthetic agents are able to impair PMN function in vitro dose-dependently. This feature is possibly related to increased risk of postoperative bacterial infection. Further studies concerning this problem should be conducted.", 
    "20": "Ro 15-4513, a benzodiazepine-receptor ligand which antagonizes ethanol, was tested in the pentylenetetrazol discrimination, a bioassay for anxiogenic drugs. Rats were trained with food reward to discriminate pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) from saline in a two-lever operant task. In lever-selection tests, rats selected the PTZ lever both after PTZ and after Ro 15-4513. The PTZ-like stimulus produced by Ro 15-4513 was blocked by diazepam and by the benzodiazepine receptor blocker Ro 15-1788. Substitution for the anxiogenic drug PTZ, and blockade by the anxiolytic diazepam, support the hypothesis that Ro 15-4513 is anxiogenic; blockade by Ro 15-1788 suggests that the PTZ-like stimulus produced by Ro 15-4513 occurs through its action at the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "21": "It is well established that tolerance can develop very rapidly to the behaviour-suppressing effects of benzodiazepines. In previous studies, however, the depressant action of zolpidem, a novel hypnotic acting at the benzodiazepine receptor, on operant behaviour in rats was maintained after many injections. An experiment was carried out, therefore, to compare the effects of acute and chronic administration of zolpidem and midazolam. Rats were trained to press a lever in standard operant test chambers to obtain 45 mg food pellets on an FR 10 schedule. Dose-response curves were then established, before, immediately after and 4 weeks after the daily administration of midazolam (3.0 mg/kg s.c.) or zolpidem (1.0 mg/kg) for 10 days. In confirmation of previous work, marked tolerance developed to the response-rate-decreasing effect of midazolam, the dose-response curve being shifted to the right by a factor of 6 and also flattened. No significant dissipation of this tolerance occurred during a period of 4-6 weeks. In contrast, repeated administration of zolpidem produced only a small degree of tolerance, the dose-response curve being shifted by a factor of two. There was little evidence for cross tolerance between the two drugs, zolpidem-treated rats being sensitive to a dose of midazolam and midazolam-treated rats sensitive to a dose of zolpidem. Although the explanation for the development of tolerance to midazolam is unknown, these results suggest that the mechanisms of action of midazolam and zolpidem in reducing response rates are different.", 
    "22": "Thirty seven southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) were singularly or repeatedly immobilized with combinations of ketamine hydrochloride (HCl) and xylazine HCl or ketamine HCl and diazepam. Atropine sulphate was included in the drug combinations. To permit experimental procedures the seals were immobilized for periods of 30-330 min. The mean induction dose of ketamine HCl was 8.71 +/- 0.25 mg/kg (mean +/- SE). The mean induction time was 16.02 +/- 2.62 min. For the elephant seals immobilized for periods in excess of 180 min, the mean dose of ketamine HCl used per hr was 3.31 +/- 0.13 mg/kg/hr and the mean dose of ketamine HCl used per hr postinduction was 1.31 +/- 0.15 mg/kg/hr. The mean dose of diazepam used was 0.09 +/- 0.01 mg/kg and the mean dose of xylazine HCl was 0.41 +/- 0.01 mg/kg. Elephant seals were weighed on 20 occasions (weight range: 897-1,932 kg) and the relationship between standard length and weight was found to be: Weight = 9.98 length - 2,317.63 (r2 = 0.724). Adverse reactions to seals immobilized only once or twice were not observed. Two seals immobilized on three occasions developed abscesses at the site of injection.", 
    "23": "Thirteen healthy volunteers received 1 mg of alprazolam, as the commercially available oral tablet, by sublingual and oral routes on two occasions in random sequence. Plasma alprazolam concentrations during 48 hours after each dose were measured by electron-capture gas-liquid chromatography. The peak plasma concentration after sublingual dosage was higher than after oral administration (17.3 vs. 14.9 ng/ml), and the time of peak concentration following sublingual administration was reached (1.17 vs. 1.73 hours after dose). However, these differences did not reach statistical significance. The mean total area under the plasma concentration curve for sublingual administration was slightly but not significantly larger than that following oral dosage (203.7 vs. 194.4 hr.ng/ml) and no significant differences between sublingual and oral dosage were found for elimination half-life (11.7 vs. 11.8 hours) or for clearance (86.4 vs. 92.4 ml/min). Thus, alprazolam absorption following sublingual administration is as rapid as after oral dosage on an empty stomach, and completeness of absorption is comparable. In clinical terms, sublingual and oral dosages of alprazolam are likely to be therapeutically equivalent. The sublingual route may be a useful alternative for panic disorder patients who cannot swallow pills or for those who do not have access to a liquid at the time of dosing.", 
    "24": "The present study assessed the acute effects of p.o. administered ethanol (0, 22, 45, and 67 g) and diazepam (0, 10, 20 and 40 mg) in normal adult humans responding under a multiple schedule of acquisition and performance of 10-response sequences. In each component of the multiple schedule subjects were required to complete a different sequence of 10 responses in a predetermined order using three keys of a numeric keypad. In the acquisition component a new response sequence had to be acquired each session. In the performance component the response sequence remained the same from session to session. The higher doses of ethanol (67 g) and diazepam (20 and 40 mg) increased overall percent errors above placebo levels; the lower doses of these compounds had no significant effect. The increases in percent errors were selective across the two schedule components. Ethanol increased percent errors significantly only in the acquisition component. Diazepam increased percent errors significantly in the acquisition component at a lower dose (20 mg) than was necessary to increase errors in the performance component (40 mg). Ethanol (67 g) and diazepam (40 mg) decreased overall response rates as an orderly function of dose. In contrast to the percent errors measure, the effects on response rates were not significantly different across the performance and acquisition components. Peak effects on percent errors and response rates varied between 30 and 70 min and 45 and 80 min postdrug for ethanol and diazepam, respectively, and the duration of effects of the higher doses was greater than 3 hr.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "Three prepubertal children who suffered severe, incapacitating anxiety disorders with panic-like symptoms were treated successfully with clonazepam. The daily doses ranged from 0.5 to 3 mg. Symptoms were rapidly controlled after a therapeutic dose was attained, and no adverse effects were reported. The children were symptom-free at follow-up, which ranged from 5 months to 3 years. These three cases illustrate the diagnostic and therapeutic overlap between childhood and adult anxiety disorders and indicate the need for empirical studies aimed at evaluating diagnostic and treatment issues in childhood anxiety disorders.", 
    "26": "A case is reported of dyssomnia at the onset of REM sleep with thrashing, shouting, and urinary incontinence throughout the night. The attacks did not respond to, and may have been worsened by, antiepileptic drugs and diazepam, and the patient had microsleeps and brief apneas during a night of severely fragmented sleep. The case underscores the value of differentiating REM and NREM disorders in patients with atypical nocturnal attacks.", 
    "27": "The use of observational data, collected during the routine clinical care of patients, has been advocated as a means to obtain clinically relevant information regarding the pharmacokinetic parameters of drugs. However, the validity of this approach and its proper role in new drug development is unclear. This study was performed to evaluate the ability of three approaches to estimate population pharmacokinetic parameters: the traditional approach, mixed-effect modeling, and a simple pharmacokinetic screen. The evaluation was performed with data collected during a multicenter, open-label study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of imipramine and alprazolam in combination. The traditional pharmacokinetic study demonstrated a 20% decrease in the clearance of imipramine in the presence of 4 mg/day alprazolam. Mixed-effect modeling extends these findings by suggesting that the interaction is dependent on the simultaneous concentration of alprazolam, a finding that was not possible under the study design typically used for traditional pharmacokinetic studies. Although the simple screen suggests the presence of the drug-drug interaction, limited information regarding pharmacokinetic parameters is available and those parameters that can be estimated are biased.", 
    "28": "Authors of recent literature have made several references to the use of intraosseous infusion in emergency situations. This method has provided a useful route of medication and fluid administration when peripheral IV access has been unsuccessful. Controlled studies on intraosseous infusion have been limited. To more accurately evaluate the effectiveness of this technique, we administered diazepam to 20 dogs randomly assigned to either peripheral IV (n = 10) or tibial intraosseous (n = 10) groups. Intramedullary placement usually was performed within 15 seconds. Central venous diazepam samples were collected at one-, three-, six-, ten-, and 20-minute intervals. Intraosseous infusion achieved and maintained serum diazepam levels comparable to those achieved by IV administration. This study was repeated with phenobarbital using a different set of 20 dogs with samples collected at one-, three-, six-, and ten-minute intervals. Results were similar in that the levels were comparable regardless of the use of intraosseous or IV administration. Complications using this technique have been few. When peripheral IV access is unobtainable, intraosseous infusion has been shown to be an effective and efficient alternative for administering medications and fluids.", 
    "29": "A patient is described with operationally diagnosed chronic schizophrenia who simultaneously experienced repeated \"attacks\" during which times he had intense apprehension and autonomic hyperactivity entirely similar to that usually described under the rubric of \"panic attacks\" in nonschizophrenic patients. Delusional and hallucinatory symptoms were also transiently exacerbated during these episodes. Alprazolam, as an adjunct to fluphenazine decanoate, was effective in ameliorating these symptoms. Diagnostic and treatment implications are discussed.", 
    "30": "We studied the use of continuous iv magnesium (Mg) infusion to control the sympathetic crises in a patient with severe tetanus characterized by pronounced autonomic nervous system instability. Our results suggested that Mg is a useful adjunct to the CNS depressants traditionally used. This therapy controlled the sympathetic crises and also suppressed the release of catecholamines, although Mg infusions alone appeared to be inadequate therapy.", 
    "31": "The anaesthetic properties of pregnanolone emulsion, a new steroid preparation for intravenous administration, were evaluated in rats and compared to those of Althesin, propofol, thiopentone and midazolam. The therapeutic index was found to be 50% higher than that of Althesin and 6-8 times higher than those of propofol, thiopentone and midazolam. Induction with pregnanolone emulsion was reliable and fast, with only minor excitatory side effects, although induction time was longer compared to Althesin, propofol and thiopentone. Movement of unstimulated rats during sleep was similar to that seen with Althesin but movement on painful stimulation was less than with propofol and thiopentone. Recovery was rapid and smooth, and the proportion of sleeping time to recovery time was higher than found for the other four anaesthetics. No cumulative effects were seen on repeated administration and there were no venous sequelae. The results indicate that pregnanolone emulsion may provide a short-acting, less cumulative and less toxic alternative to existing intravenous anaesthetic agents.", 
    "32": "Potential of clonidine in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal reactions was investigated. Clonidine was found to be remarkably effective in alleviating various alcohol abstinence signs in a chronic alcoholic. The usefulness of clonidine and related alpha 2-agonists in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal states is discussed.", 
    "33": "The effect of chronic renal disease on the serum free fraction of phenytoin, diazepam and propranolol was examined in vitro among 60 conservatively treated patients with renal insufficiency of varying degree and different etiology, and in 10 patients with a nephrotic syndrome. The control group comprised 10 age and sex-matched healthy subjects. The free fractions were separated at 37 degrees C using a pressure ultrafiltration method. The highest free fractions of phenytoin and diazepam in uremic patients were 4 to 5-fold the normal. The free fractions were about twice the normal at a creatinine concentration of 800 mumol/l, and 2 to 4-fold at an urea concentration of 20-40 mmol/l. The creatinine and urea correlated with the free fractions of phenytoin and diazepam in a similar manner. The effect of a decreased serum albumin on the free fractions of these drugs was clear when its concentration was under 30 g/l. The creatinine and urea did not correlate with the free fraction of propranolol. However, after mathematically correcting the free fraction of propranolol to correspond to an alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1-AGP) concentration of 0.9 g/l, it correlated significantly with creatinine and urea. The concentration of alpha 1-AGP was the most important determinant for the free fraction of propranolol. For practical purposes, the change in the free fractions of phenytoin and diazepam can be adequately predicted by the serum creatinine or urea and serum albumin levels. For propranolol the only parameter which needs to be analyzed is the serum alpha 1-AGP concentration.", 
    "34": "The electroencephalographic (EEG) effects of 7-chloro-5-(o-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-2H-1, 4-benzodiazepine-2-thione (Sch 161, quazepam) were investigated in unanesthetized rats and rabbits with chronic electrode implants, and the effects were compared with those of flurazepam and diazepam. In freely moving rats, quazepam at doses of 10 to 30 mg/kg, p.o., induced an increase in drowsy EEG pattern periods: high amplitude slow waves and spindle bursts in the cortical EEG and desynchronization of the hippocampal theta waves. Quazepam at doses of 10 to 30 mg/kg significantly decreased the onset of the drowsy EEG pattern after p.o. administration of rats in a dose-dependent manner, while flurazepam and diazepam reduced it only at higher doses of 20 to 30 mg/kg, p.o. In rabbits, quazepam at doses of 0.5 to 5 mg/kg, i.v., evoked a drowsy EEG pattern similar to that of flurazepam (1 to 5 mg/kg) or diazepam (1 to 2 mg/kg). Quazepam at higher doses caused sedation and a slight muscle relaxation in both rats and rabbits, which were weaker than those of flurazepam or diazepam. In both rats and rabbits, quazepam and flurazepam depressed the EEG arousal response to auditory stimulation but not to electrical stimulation of the midbrain reticular formation or the posterior hypothalamus, while the arousal response to either auditory or brain stimulation was markedly suppressed by diazepam. The recruiting response was not altered by quazepam, flurazepam and diazepam. Quazepam has no effect on the photic driving response to flash light in the occipital cortex of the rabbit, while the response was suppressed moderately by flurazepam and markedly suppressed by diazepam. Quazepam (2 mg/kg) suppressed either the hippocampal or amygdaloid afterdischarges. These results suggest that the EEG effect of quazepam is different to those of flurazepam and diazepam in qualitative aspects and that quazepam is likely to be an effective sleep-promoting drug with slight adverse reactions.", 
    "35": "In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, the induction of anesthesia is not without risk because of specific cardiovascular effects of the anesthetic and the preoperative state of the patient. The hemodynamic effects of etomidate, midazolam, thiopental, and methohexital are well known: etomidate is an anesthetic that induces only minor cardiovascular changes; its influence on the endocrine system, however, has reduced its clinical indication. Barbiturates such as thiopental and methohexital produce negative inotropic effects in combination with an increase in heart rate and myocardial oxygen consumption; midazolam reduces pre- and afterload in patients with poor left ventricular function. Propofol, a new short-acting induction agent with good anesthetic properties, is said to diminish arterial pressure as well as myocardial oxygen consumption.", 
    "36": "In a randomized study we investigated the hemodynamic effects of intravenous induction with propofol (2 mg/kg body wt.), thiopental (5 mg/kg), methohexital (1 mg/kg), etomidate (0.3 mg/kg), and midazolam (0.15 mg/kg) in 50 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. All patients were premedicated with flunitrazepam (0.03 mg/kg up to 2 mg) and morphine hydrochloride (0.2 mg/kg up to 15 mg) 100 min before the investigation. After 0.003 mg/kg fentanyl the patients received the induction agent in the above-mentioned dosage within 40 s followed by 0.1 mg/kg pancuronium bromide. Hemodynamic measurements were performed 1, 3, and 5 min after the end of the injection as well as 1 and 5 min after intubation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "37": "The antidepressant efficacy of alprazolam (ALP) was tested in a double-blind controlled comparison with desipramine (DMI) and an ALP-DMI combination in outpatients diagnosed with major depressive disorder by Research Diagnostic Criteria (90% met criteria for endogenous subtype). Following a placebo period of at least 1 week, subjects who continued to meet severity criteria defined by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were administered oral doses of the active medication (N = 79), in a dose ratio of 1 mg ALP:50 mg DMI:1 mg ALP + 50 mg DMI. Treatment continued for 6 weeks, and all subjects who completed at least 2 weeks (N = 69) were included in endpoint analyses. Following the placebo baseline, symptoms were rated again at day 5 and at the end of weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6. Final doses averaged 4.6 +/- 1.3 mg for the ALP group, 230 +/- 61 mg for the DMI group, and 4.6 +/- 1.2 mg ALP + 229.5 +/- 1.2 mg DMI for the combination group. The final outcome was a comparable degree of improvement at the endpoint among the three treatment groups on measures of depression (HDRS and Beck Depression Inventory), anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale), and global improvement (Global Assessment Scale, and Physician and Patient Global Impressions). A similar outcome was found for the subgroup of patients who completed all 6 weeks (N = 56). Endpoint analyses also showed that ALP-treated subjects responded sooner and continued to show improvement throughout the course of the study on measures of depression, anxiety, and global status. These results suggest that ALP alone is as effective as a standard tricyclic for the acute treatment of patients with major depressive disorder and that significant improvement may occur within the first week of medication. Side effect profiles were compared among treatment groups and are discussed, as are other clinical studies that have investigated ALP's potential antidepressant efficacy.", 
    "38": "Children with overanxious and/or avoidant disorder (DSM-III) were treated with alprazolam (Xanax, Upjohn) to determine its safety, clinical and cognitive effects. Ten male and two female patients (age range 8.8 to 16.5 years; mean 11.5) participated in an open clinical trial consisting of a baseline placebo period (1 week), alprazolam therapy (4 weeks), a drug-tapering period (1 week), and a post-drug placebo period (1 week). There was a drug-free follow-up approximately 4 weeks after termination of the study. Dosages were individually adjusted and the daily maximum ranged from 0.50 mg to 1.5 mg. Evaluations included clinical assessments, parent, teacher and self ratings, and cognitive tests. Clinical global improvement with alprazolam therapy was marked in 1 patient, moderate in 6, minimal in 4, and none in 1. Clinician ratings indicated significant improvements of anxiety, depression, and psychomotor excitation. Parent questionnaires indicated significant improvements of anxiety and hyperactivity while teacher questionnaires showed significant improvement of an anxious-passive factor. Significant improvements in the paired associate learning tasks, maze task and the block design tasks were maintained after drug withdrawal suggesting a practice effect. Adverse effects were infrequent, mild and transient. There were no clinically significant changes of laboratory values, blood pressure, pulse or respiration during the 4 weeks of alprazolam administration. Body weight increased significantly (mean increase was 0.87 kg). Double-blind trials with alprazolam are recommended in child psychiatry disorders.", 
    "39": "This is a report on the efficacy of clonazepam in the treatment of acute mania. The advantages of clonazepam over standard neuroleptics are its rapidity of action, its lack of toxicity, and, particularly important, the fact that it does not cause tardive dyskinesia, a potentially disabling neurological side effect of neuroleptic treatment. Results are reported of double-blind, controlled studies comparing clonazepam with lithium and with haloperidol in the treatment of acutely manic patients who were newly admitted through an emergency room. For the maintenance treatment of patients with bipolar illness, a combined approach is outlined that involves medications with different mechanisms of action. Treatment is initiated with lithium, and, if necessary, tryptophan is added to enhance lithium response; drug-resistant patients who fail to respond satisfactorily to lithium or lithium plus tryptophan are given adjunctive clonazepam therapy.", 
    "40": "The authors present interim results of a prospective, random assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted to determine whether clonazepam is as effective as alprazolam in reducing the frequency of panic attacks and whether both agents are superior to placebo. Analysis on 44 of 60 randomized subjects showed no statistically significant differences between the clonazepam and alprazolam groups on the following clinically meaningful outcome measures: total number of panic attacks and percent of time subjects experienced anticipatory anxiety, extent of phobic avoidance, and fear. Statistically significant differences did exist among the drug and placebo groups on these measures. The authors conclude that this interim analysis of the data supports the inclusion of clonazepam in the treatment of panic disorder.", 
    "41": "Data were collected on 50 patients with panic attacks who were treated with clonazepam to determine the drug's antipanic efficacy. At a mean duration of 54.3 weeks, 62% of the patients remained in treatment and 38% were lost to follow-up. Of those remaining in treatment, 90% had a good response to clonazepam and 10% a poor response. The author concludes that clonazepam demonstrated antipanic efficacy, that the development of tolerance or abuse was not a problem, and that most of the patients are being effectively maintained at 2-3 mg/day of clonazepam.", 
    "42": "Two hundred forty-one outpatients with a DSM-III diagnosis of major depressive disorder participated in a six-week double-blind therapeutic trial of alprazolam, diazepam, imipramine hydrochloride, and placebo. Side effects were given as a major reason for attrition by patients taking the three active compounds and ineffectiveness was the reason given by patients taking placebo. Imipramine-treated patients reported the most and placebo patients the least number of adverse effects. Imipramine and alprazolam, but not diazepam, produced significantly more improvement in depressed symptomatology than did placebo. Mean diazepam scores frequently assumed an intermediate position between those of imipramine or alprazolam and placebo. These treatment differences were found to be independent of initial severity levels of anxiety and depression.", 
    "43": "Butorphanol and meperidine, each combined with titrated diazepam, 10 to 20 mg, were compared in a randomized, double-blind trial for their sedative-analgesic effects. The fifty patients underwent multiple dental extractions under local anesthesia and sedation in an outpatient clinic. Butorphanol was significantly superior to meperidine with respect to the diazepam dose required to achieve the target level of sedation, the total diazepam dose administered, the clinical level of sedation, the surgeon's overall evaluations of effectiveness and of sedation level, and several patient evaluation parameters measured at discharge from the recovery room and at follow-up interview. All study drugs were well tolerated. Butorphanol offers clinical advantages over meperidine when combined with diazepam for sedation analgesia in outpatient oral surgery.", 
    "44": "It has been suggested that the gut hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), by modulating insulin output from pancreatic beta-cells, plays an important role in the enteroinsular axis. To investigate this hypothesis, eight rats were studied on two different occasions: after injection of L 364718, a specific antagonist of CCK binding to its membrane receptor, and after vehicle injection. In both studies a mixture of casein (11%) and glucose (9%) was infused through a chronic indwelling intraduodenal catheter to evoke CCK secretion. Plasma was analyzed for insulin, glucose, glucagon, and tyrosine many times during the procedure. Prior administration of the CCK antagonist significantly attenuated the increase in plasma insulin and glucagon after casein infusion. These results support the concept that cholecystokinin plays an important physiologic role in the in vivo regulation of postprandial plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations after protein ingestion.", 
    "45": "Total intravenous anaesthesia with midazolam and alfentanil, reversed with the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil, was studied in patients admitted for outpatient gynaecological dilatation and curettage. One hundred patients were randomly allocated to four groups with different anaesthetic techniques: I: alfentanil and thiopentone induction, 66% N2O maintenance; II: alfentanil and midazolam sedation prior to isoflurane and N2O induction and maintenance; III: midazolam and alfentanil induction; oxygen/air, placebo reversal; IV: midazolam and alfentanil induction, oxygen/air, flumazenil reversal. All methods of anaesthesia proved satisfactory with no serious side-effects or complications. Induction was faster in Group I (26 s) compared with Group III and IV (37-38 s) and Group I (62 s). Respiration was less depressed in Group II compared with the other groups. Recovery function was better in Group IV during the first 30 postoperative min and worse in Group III during the first 120 postoperative min compared with the other groups. Reduced performances in P-deletion and 4-choice reaction-time tests in the midazolam patients were not reversed by 0.5 mg flumazenil, suggesting that flumazenil did not antagonize all benzodiazepine effects in our patients. Postoperative amnesia was most pronounced in Group III. There was no significant difference in patient function 7 h postoperatively, at home in the evening or during the next days. We conclude that total intravenous anaesthesia with alfentanil and midazolam with flumazenil reversal is a promising technique for short outpatient anaesthetic procedures.", 
    "46": "The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of Ro15-1788 and a placebo in reversing diazepam-induced effects after surgery under epidural block, and to evaluate the local tolerance and general safety of Ro15-1788. Fifty-seven patients were sedated with diazepam for surgery under epidural anaesthesia. Antagonism of diazepam-induced effects by Ro15-1788 was investigated postoperatively in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. The patient's subjective assessment of mood rating, an objective test of performance, a test for amnesia, and vital signs were recorded for up to 300 min after administration of the trial drug. No significant differences between the two groups were observed for mood rating, amnesia, or vital signs. The Ro15-1788 group showed a significant improvement in the performance test up to 120 min after administration of the drug. There was no evidence of reaction at the injection site.", 
    "47": "In a study of 101 patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, 90% of patients had complete amnesia for the procedure after intravenous midazolam (average dose 10 mg), but only 61% had complete amnesia after intravenous diazepam in lipid emulsion (average dose 18.4 mg) (P = 0.0006). However, when assessed by two different tests, recovery within the first hour was significantly more rapid after diazepam (P less than 0.0001). Prolonged sedation (over 20 hours after injection) was reported occasionally by patients who had received either drug. Thus, as with patients who have been sedated with diazepam, those who have been sedated with midazolam should also be advised to avoid driving or operating machinery for at least 24 hours after injection.", 
    "48": "2-Phenylpyrazolo[4,3-c]quinolin-3(5H)-one (CGS 8216) is pharmacologically characterized as benzodiazepine antagonist with low inverse agonistic effects. Single oral doses up to 650 mg and subchronic doses up to 100 mg daily for seven days are well tolerated by young healthy volunteers. Plasma concentrations of CGS 8216 are variable, not dose-related and relatively low considering the doses administered. A high plasma concentration ratio of metabolite vs. parent compound (3:1) points to an extensive gastrointestinal first-pass metabolism. CGS 8216 influences the human electroencephalogram similar to anxiolytic and vigilance enhancing drugs in doses which do not change performance of psychometric tests. CGS 8216 antagonizes the diazepam-induced impairment of alertness.", 
    "49": "1-(3-Chlorophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-dimethoxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 51189) is a new analogue of tofisopam. Due to the novel chemical structure this molecule displays a peculiar spectrum of pharmacological activity. In many respects tofisopam and its new analogue differ from the traditional 1,4-benzodiazepines, e.g. in that they possess selective anxiolytic action without muscle relaxant and anticonvulsive activity, as well as they do not show any affinity for the 1,4-benzodiazepine receptors. This new compound exerts more pronounced anxiolytic potency than tofisopam. In addition to its main action it possesses significant antidepressant activity. It attenuates psychomotor agitation and exerts significant antiaggressive effect by reducing both spontaneous and induced aggressiveness. Vegetative responses (rise in blood pressure and heart rate) induced by electric stimulation of the hypothalamus are also inhibited by this compound, while motor functions remain unaffected and no somnolence is induced. The new tofisopam analogue fails to exert any potentiating effect either on ethanol or on barbiturates. GYKI-51189 has a highly favourable therapeutic index and only few side effects. Neither tolerance nor dependence was observed during the chronic toxicological investigations.", 
    "50": "The effects of the antimuscarinic drugs pirenzepine and atropine on somatostatin and gastrin portal levels under basal conditions and during bethanechol infusion have been investigated in anesthetized dogs. Iv bolus administration of pirenzepine (1 mg/kg) or atropine (0.1 mg/kg), decreased gastrin concentrations, but did not affect basal somatostatin levels. During 120 min of bethanechol infusion (160 micrograms/kg/h) gastrin levels increased but somatostatin levels were unchanged. Pirenzepine (1 mg/kg iv bolus), administered at the 60th min of bethanechol infusion, decreased the gastrin concentrations, and markedly enhanced somatostatin levels. Under the same conditions atropine (0.1 mg/kg iv bolus) decreased gastrin levels, but had little or no effect on somatostatin levels. These results indicate that muscarinic receptors with similar affinity for pirenzepine and atropine mediate excitatory cholinergic influences on gastrin release. By contrast, muscarinic receptors with higher affinity for pirenzepine seem to be involved in the cholinergic inhibition of somatostatin release: by selectively blocking these receptors, pirenzepine may increase portal somatostatin levels.", 
    "51": "Midazolam (15 mg) was compared with temazepam (30 mg) in a randomized, double-blind, parallel group study. An initial screening period was followed by 3 days of placebo baseline, 4 to 12 weeks of nightly oral use of the medication and a 4-day placebo withdrawal period. One hundred seventy-five patients with chronic insomnia participated in this multicenter outpatient study. Because the elimination half-life of midazolam, a new trizolobenzodiazepine hypnotic, is short (1.3-2.2 hr) compared to temazepam's (12-16 hr), more problems with tolerance and rebound insomnia were expected to occur. Hypnotic efficacy (increased total sleep time, decreased wake time, and decreased sleep latency) was demonstrated for both medications over the entire 3-month period without the development of tolerance. In fact, if anything, efficacy increased with time on medication, suggesting possible facilitation or \"inverse tolerance\" effect. On withdrawal, sleep was improved compared with baseline, suggesting partial resolution of the insomniac condition rather than rebound insomnia. These effects were both statistically and clinically significant for midazolam, with 16% to 50% improvement in sleep measures. The results of this study suggest that patients with chronic insomnia may benefit from 30 to 90 days of treatment. A three-factor model that separates pharmacologic from behavioral and psychologic effects of hypnotics was proposed to explain these results in part.", 
    "52": "Recent evidence suggests that agents that inhibit GABAergic function, particularly at sites on the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex, have intrinsic anxiogenic properties. The present experiments further characterize the behavioral effects of these receptor complex inhibitors, using the \"defensive burying\" test, which is reasonably selective for anxiolytics. Putative blockers of the GABA-receptor coupled chloride channel, picrotoxin and pentylenetetrazol, and the benzodiazepine receptor antagonists Ro 15-1788 and CGS 8216 each blocked the anxiolytic effect of chlordiazepoxide. However, these compounds failed to exert significant anxiogenic effects in the burying test. These findings suggest that different animal models of anxiolytic drug effects are not equally sensitive to the possible anxiogenic effects of drugs that act at the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "53": "In the last decade anxiety disorders have been the focus of intensive research in the psychiatric community, resulting in a rapid growth in our understanding of these illnesses. Diagnostic, biological, and psychopharmacological investigations have revealed important distinctions among these disorders which enable the clinician to make well-informed therapeutic choices and frequently ameliorate or even eliminate anxiety symptoms and related phobic behaviour. The principles of treatment can be simply stated: 1. Careful diagnostic evaluation through history and exclusion of medical and psychiatric conditions which mimic anxiety disorders. 2. Treatment selection based on diagnosis and formulation with the patient of the goals and expected outcome of pharmacotherapy. 3. Systematic application of each drug treatment in sufficient dosage and for an adequate duration permitting progression to the next agent when results are not optimal. 4. Addition of non-pharmacological interventions, usually behavioural therapy, to decrease phobic behaviour. 5. Development of a maintenance or discontinuation strategy tailored to the needs of the patient.", 
    "54": "A retrospective study of patients who probably had delirium tremens during hospitalization for alcohol dependency is reported. Predictors of delirium tremens were daily heavy alcohol use, a past history of delirium tremens, and a past history of alcohol withdrawal seizures. Management included general measures and specific therapy for complications. Mortality was only 4.9%, which reflects the improved management techniques now available. The use of multiple interventions proved most effective.", 
    "55": "Clonazepam is a high-potency benzodiazepine labeled for use as an anticonvulsant. Increasingly, clonazepam has been used in the treatment of a variety of psychiatric disorders. The authors discuss its potential clinical applications, including (1) use as an adjunct to neuroleptics for treating psychosis, (2) management of specific psychotropic side effects, (3) alternative treatment for certain pain syndromes, and (4) a primary treatment for severe agitation, atypical psychosis, and anxiety disorders. Apparent treatment-emergent side effects including depression, disinhibition, and sexual dysfunction are also discussed.", 
    "56": "Alprazolam and triazolam dependence and withdrawal may be uniquely problematic. This paper describes current clinical approaches to benzodiazepine withdrawal, with a focus on recent experience with alprazolam. The withdrawal characteristics of the triazolobenzodiazepines are discussed, and the epidemiology of benzodiazepine dependence is reviewed. Estimates of the incidence of alprazolam abuse are provided from Drug Abuse Warning Network data. The only two case reports in the literature of failure of cross tolerance between alprazolam and other benzodiazepines are noted to be open to alternative interpretations. A case is reported in which a patient was successfully detoxified with clonazepam from a very high dose of alprazolam. The author concludes that clonazepam may have a role in withdrawal from high-dose alprazolam dependence.", 
    "57": "Rebound--the relative worsening of symptoms on discontinuation of treatment as compared to baseline symptoms--is distinguished from withdrawal. Case reports and a clinical study are presented to illustrate the management of patients with panic disorder who are taking short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines and are experiencing rebound anxiety. The authors present the results of switching over to clonazepam 48 patients with panic disorder who were experiencing rebound effects with alprazolam. Eighty-two percent (39) of the patients rated clonazepam as being \"better\" than alprazolam due to decreased dosing frequency and lack of interdose anxiety. The authors conclude that clonazepam can be a useful alternative to alprazolam and other short-acting benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Clonazepam offers the advantage of antipanic efficacy without the relative side effect problems seen with tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors.", 
    "58": "The authors report a case of a 55-year-old man undergoing a triazolam withdrawal syndrome that was recognized and treated with high doses of benzodiazepines, but the patient nevertheless developed seizures. Reasons for the occurrence of these seizures despite treatment are discussed within the context of the differential potency that exists among benzodiazepines in binding to central and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "59": "Flunitrazepam effects on local cerebral glucose utilization in the rat brain were investigated with the (14C) 2-Deoxy-D-Glucose procedure. The drug decreased glucose utilization in many areas of the rat brain, whereas no increases were observed. In this respect, the metabolic effects of flunitrazepam were different from those of other CNS \"depressant\" drugs, such as isoflurane and phencyclidine. Compared to the metabolic changes induced by diazepam, flunitrazepam peak effects appeared later and involved a greater number of regions.", 
    "60": "The distribution of benzodiazepine binding sites was analysed in the cingulate cortex of the rat brain by quantitative radioautography of brain sections incubated with a full agonist benzodiazepine ligand, 3H-flunitrazepam (3H-FLU), or with a partial agonist with non benzodiazepine structure, (7-3H)-4hydroxy-N(4,5-dihydroxy-2-thiazolyl)-6 methoxy-3-quinoline (3H-RU 43028), after lesion of noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) containing afferents to this structure. NA denervation was obtained by systemic administration of N-(2-chlorethyl)-N ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP4) and destruction of both NA and DA containing afferents was induced by unilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in the middle forebrain bundle (MFB). A similar caudo-rostral pattern of distribution was found in the cingulate cortex after incubation with these two ligands which bound a greater number of sites in the anterior portion of the structure. In spite of a very precise anatomical sampling (200 micron intervals along the postero-anterior axis) no significant difference was observed when intact and lesioned brains were compared. It is concluded that benzodiazepine binding sites eventually localized on catecholaminergic afferents to the cingulate cortex do not represent a significant proportion of the total population of these sites in this structure.", 
    "61": "Train-of-four (TOF) responses were assessed in 70 patients (seven groups of ten patients each) during recovery of neuromuscular block from atracurium (226 or 452 micrograms/kg), vecuronium (40 or 80 micrograms/kg), pancuronium (60 or 120 micrograms/kg) and tubocurarine (450 micrograms/kg) in order to quantify the height of T1 (first response in the TOF sequence) at which T2, T3 and T4 (2nd, 3rd and 4th response in TOF sequence) reappear. Patients were anaesthetised with thiopentone, nitrous oxide in oxygen and fentanyl. There were small but significant differences between relaxants. The clinically useful parameter, i.e. the 4th response in the TOF sequence, appeared at approximately 30% height of the first response (T1) rather than at 25% as generally believed. It is suggested that the third response in the TOF sequence, which reappeared at an average height of T1 of about 25% be used for administration of further supplements of muscle relaxants since abdominal muscle relaxation becomes inadequate at this stage.", 
    "62": "Male rats were adapted to a 22 hr water-deprivation schedule, and to a 30 min test of hypertonic (1.8 or 2.7%) NaCl solution ingestion. A novel benzodiazepine, Ro23-0364, recently reported to have anxiolytic activity in rats and squirrel monkeys but to have limited potential to produce unwanted side effects, produced significant dose-related increases in hypertonic saline ingestion. Midazolam, a benzodiazepine full agonist, increased salt intake but the effect was offset at higher doses by the induction of sedation. Three putative 5-HT1A agonists, proposed as nonbenzodiazepine-related anxiolytics, were also tested: the highly selective 8-OH-DPAT, gepirone and ipsapirone (TVX Q 7821). In each case, occasions when hypertonic saline consumption was significantly increased were detected. At 300 micrograms/kg of 8-OH-DPAT and 10 mg/kg of gepirone, the appearance of a pronounced flattened body posture effectively interfered with drinking responses. It appears possible that a behavioural action shared by benzodiazepines and 5-HT1A agonists may be responsible for the increased hypertonic saline ingestion.", 
    "63": "The selective benzodiazepine antagonist RO 15-1788, labelled with carbon 11 [11C] RO 15-1788, as a specific marker, together with positron emission tomography, allows the in vivo study of benzodiazepine receptors in primates. In addition, when coupled with recordings of electroencephalographic activity, this method offers the feasibility of studying the correlation between occupancy of benzodiazepine receptors and the convulsant action of drugs acting at the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex in vivo. The present study showed that convulsant doses of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) could affect the binding of [11C] RO 15-1788 in vivo in two ways, depending on the doses tested: at concentrations of 20 and 30 mg/kg, pentylenetetrazol increased the binding of [11C] RO 15-1788 whereas larger concentrations displaced the binding of [11C] RO 15-1788. The direct correlation between the occupancy of respective benzodiazepine receptors, afforded by increasing convulsant doses of pentylenetetrazol, revealed that competitive interaction with benzodiazepine receptors was not necessary for pentylenetetrazol to induce the appearance of seizures in vivo.", 
    "64": "To assess potential differences in the functional responsiveness of GABAergic and serotonergic receptors during postnatal development, extracellular recordings were made in in-vitro midbrain slices containing the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). Pacemaker-like activity analogous to that observed in vivo was induced by superfusing the slices with 2.5 microM phenylephrine. GABA (0.001 M) and 5-HT (0.004 M) dissolved in 0.1 M NaCl were applied microiontophoretically for 1-min intervals using a range of iontophoretic currents. The current required to produce a 50% inhibition in firing was determined using logit and regression procedures. Iontophoretically applied picrotoxin, baclofen, and bicuculline were applied alone and in combination with GABA to characterize the neonatal GABA receptor site. The pharmacology of the GABA responses observed in early postnatal DRN neurons was that associated with the GABAA subtype. No significant changes in sensitivity to iontophoretically applied 5-HT or GABA were observed at any time during postnatal development. The application of the benzodiazepine, clonazepam, in the perfusion fluid at doses between 10(-8) and 10(-7) potentiated the inhibitory effects of GABA in the slices, but produced no consistent inhibitory effect by itself. The increased potentiation of GABA's effects by benzodiazepine was greatest in neonatal animals. This finding is consistent with previous literature showing enhanced coupling of the GABA-benzodiazepine complex at early postnatal ages.", 
    "65": "1 Addition of baclofen to a medium containing slices of mouse frontal cortex inhibited the potassium-evoked release of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in a concentration-dependent manner. The degree of inhibition was increased in frontal cortex tissue taken from animals treated for 14 days with amitriptyline (10 mg kg-1, twice daily) at all concentrations of baclofen tested (10(-6) M-10(-4) M). 2 Administration of either desipramine, mianserin or zimeldine (10 mg kg-1 daily) for 14 days also approximately doubled the degree of inhibition evoked by addition of baclofen (10(-5) M) to the medium. 3 One day of treatment with the antidepressant drugs did not alter the inhibitory effect of baclofen on K+-evoked 5-HT release. 4 Addition of the antidepressant drugs to the medium had no effect on the K+-evoked release of 5-HT. 5 Repeated administration of electroconvulsive shock (5 seizures spread out over 10 days), like amitriptyline, produced a significant enhancement of the baclofen-induced inhibition of 5-HT release over the range of baclofen concentrations studied. A single electroconvulsive shock had no effect. 6 These data suggest that repeated administration of the antidepressant drugs or electroconvulsive shock increases the function of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)B receptor in the frontal cortex modulating 5-HT release and are consistent with the finding of increased GABAB receptor number in this region following various antidepressant treatments.", 
    "66": "The possibility that the kappa agonists, U50,488H, ethylketazocine and tifluadom, might act as opioid antagonists was studied using the inhibition of the anesthetized rat micturition reflex in vivo as a pharmacological endpoint. Intracerebroventricular administration of equieffective doses of the mu agonists [D-Ala2, NMePhe4, Gly-ol]enkephalin (0.01 nmol), [N-MePhe3, D-Pro4]enkephalin (0.03 nmol), morphine (0.08 nmol), normorphine (0.3 nmol), sufentanil (0.002 nmol), etorphine (0.004 nmol), phenazocine (17 nmol) and meperidine (176 nmol) inhibited spontaneous bladder contractions for a duration of approximately 20 to 30 min. Similarly, i.c.v. administration of the delta-selective agonist (D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin (15 nmol) inhibited the micturition reflex for approximately the same duration. The kappa agonists U50,488H (22 nmol), ethylketazocine (3 nmol) and tifluadom (3 nmol) did not alter bladder activity after i.c.v. administration. Higher doses of ethylketazocine (10 nmol) or tifluadom (20 nmol), but not U50,488H, produced consistent suppression of bladder contractions. Pretreatment of rats (-15 min, i.c.v.) with doses of U50,488H, ethylketazocine or tifluadom which did not produce an agonist effect consistently blocked the inhibitory actions of the mu agonists morphine and normorphine on bladder motility, but failed to antagonize the similar actions of the mu agonists [D-Ala2, NMePhe4, Gly-ol]enkephalin, [N-MePhe3, D-Pro4]enkephalin, phenazocine, meperidine or those of the delta agonist [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin. Centrally initiated bladder effects of the mu agonists etorphine and sufentanil were antagonized by U50,488H but unaffected by ethylketazocine or tifluadom. In addition, administration of U50,488H (i.c.v.) during a morphine-induced bladder shutdown resulted in either an immediate recovery of bladder activity or a shortened duration of action.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
