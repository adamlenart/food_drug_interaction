    "1": "A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using nonlinear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM) with data obtained from 51 patients with either depression or epilepsy. Each patient received approximately 370 MBq (1-4 microg) of (11)C-flumazenil. The effects of selected covariates (gender, weight, type of disease and age) were investigated. The model was validated using a bootstrap method. Finally, an optimal sampling design was established.", 
    "2": "The population pharmacokinetics of tracer quantities of (11)C-flumazenil were best described by a two compartment model. Type of disease and weight were identified as significant covariates (P < 0.002). Mean population pharmacokinetic parameters (percent coefficient of variation) were: CL 1530 mL min(-1) (6.6%), V(1) 24.8 x 10(3) mL (3.8%), V(2) 27.3 x 10(3) mL (5.4%), and Q 2510 mL min(-1) (6.5%). CL was 20% lower in patients with epilepsy, and the influence of weight on V(1) was 0.55% kg(-1). For the prediction of the AUC, a combination of two time points at t = 30 and 60 min post injection was considered optimal (bias -0.7% (95% CI -2.2 to 0.8%), precision 5.7% (95% CI 4.5-6.9%)). The optimal sampling strategy was cross-validated (observed AUC = 296 MBql(-1) min(-1) (95% CI 102-490), predicted AUC = 288 MBql(-1) min(-1) (95% CI 70-506)).",

    "4": "Overactive inflammatory responses that destroy rather than protect are the crucial issues in the development of a spectrum of septic disease states, such as adult respiratory distress syndrome, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, septic shock, and multiple organ failure. This review focuses on an area in which alternative actions of intravenous anesthetics show much promise for sepsis: their effects on the inflammatory response and on inflammatory cells in vitro and in vivo. The endotoxin-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine activity and its consequent nitric oxide generation, free radicals production and neutrophil activity are generally depressed by intravenous anesthetics. Different intravenous anesthetics, such as propofol, ketamine, benzodiazepine and barbiturates, which produce different levels of inhibition of inflammatory effects, are discussed in this article. In addition, such modulations of inflammatory responses may be of great relevance to the practice of intensive care, and intravenous anesthetics may play significant roles in this regard.",

When comparing benzodiazepines with placebo, sedation was equally prevalent (n=102, 1 RCT, RR 1.67 CI 0.4 to 6.6), however, fewer people allocated lorazepam remained excited at 24 hours (n=102, RR 0.62 CI 0.4 to 1.0, NNT 5 CI 3 to 59). The lorazepam and placebo group experienced similar non-significant, low levels of adverse effects. In the comparison of benzodiazepines versus use of antipsychotics without use of anticholinergics/antihistamines, people allocated benzodiazepines did not clearly need additional medication compared with those given antipsychotics (n=216, 2 RCTs, RR 1.28 CI 0.5 to 3.2). Numbers sedated were also equivocal between groups (n=324, 6 RCTs, RR 0.76 CI 0.5 to 1.2) as were mental state ratings. Extrapyramidal symptoms were significantly higher in the antipsychotic treatment group (n=391, 7 RCTs, RR 0.17 CI 0.1 to 0.4, NNT 6 CI 2 to 17). Two trials (total n=83) comparing lorazepam plus haloperidol with lorazepam alone found no clear difference for the need of additional medication (n=83, 2 RCTs, RR 1.02 CI 0.8 to 1.3) or 'not improved' at one hour (n=20, 1 RCT, RR 1.47 CI 0.66 to 3.25).

The sole use of older antipsychotics unaccompanied by anticholinergic drugs may be problematic, but studies in this review are not large enough to identify any serious adverse effects of benzodiazepines such as respiratory depression. Larger, more informative studies are needed before definite conclusions can be drawn as to the efficacy of benzodiazapines.", 
    "30": "Stupor is a condition from which the subject can be aroused only by vigorous stimuli. Most patients with stupor have a diffuse organic cerebral dysfunction. Rarely stupor is recurrent and no specific causes can be found. Patients with idiopathic recurrent stupor were awakened by i.v. administration of an antagonist (flumazenil) of the benzodiazepine recognition site located in the GABA(A) receptor. Since no exogenous benzodiazepines were detected in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid by high performance liquid chromatography, an excess of endogenous benzodiazepine-like compounds (endozepines) was proposed as the cause of stupor. The existence of endozepines, their widespread distribution in the CNS and their involvement in hepatic encephalopathy are established. However, the origin of these compounds, how biosynthesis occurs and the mechanisms and causes through which they alter brain functions are poorly understood. The fact that a number of synthetic benzodiazepines are difficult to detect using conventional techniques and the discovery that some cases of recurrent stupor were caused by fraudulent administration of lorazepam question whether the concept of endozepine recurrent stupor can be sustained. This review summarizes the state of endozepine physiology and pharmacology and the clinical syndromes attributed to their involvement. A diagnostic work-up to define endozepine-induced recurrent stupor is suggested.", 
    "31": "Ziprasidone is an atypical antipsychotic with a highly specific receptorbinding profile that has been shown to be effective for both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The agent has been associated with a low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms and sedative and anticholinergic effects. Four cases of acute ziprasidone overdose were recorded in the database of the department of pharmacovigilance of Pfizer-Spain from January 2003 (when ziprasidone was first marketed in Spain) to October 2004. The doses taken were 780, 1120, 4400, and 4480 mg. In two cases, an excessive ingestion of other drugs such as benzodiazepines and sedative hypnotics was also noted. None of the four cases showed cardiac adverse effects, and the QTc interval was within the normal range in all patients. No relevant neurologic clinical signs were observed, except for mild drowsiness in three cases. Evaluation of these four cases, as well as review of the literature, showed that an overdose of ziprasidone alone, in patients without risk factors that contraindicate its use, is relatively safe.", 
    "32": "The aim of this review was to determine the spectrum and severity of effects of unintentional antipsychotic poisoning in children. A computerised literature search of MEDLINE (1966 to February 2005) and EMBASE (1980 to February 2005) was undertaken. The Internet was searched using URL: www.google.com. The proceedings of the North American Congress of Clinical Toxicology (NACCT) and the European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists (EAPCCT) were hand searched. All cases of unintentional antipsychotic (all classes) poisoning in children aged 0-6 years were included. The data extracted included the age, weight, antipsychotic, dose, clinical effects, treatment and outcomes. The toxic dose was estimated as the lowest dose causing objective adverse effects.Sixty-eight reports were identified. Few contained all of the required information. Most of the case series included multiple antipsychotics with limited information on individual drugs or all ages with limited paediatric information. For most antipsychotics the ingestion of one tablet caused symptoms that were sometimes severe and usually lasted from 1 to 3 days. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were often delayed for up to 12-24 hours. Chlorpromazine caused CNS depression, hypotension and miosis; EPS and cardiac effects were rare, and the toxic dose was estimated to be 15 mg/kg. Haloperidol caused drowsiness (rarely coma) and over one-half of patients had neuromuscular effects (mainly EPS), with a toxic dose estimated at 0.15 mg/kg. Thioridazine caused CNS depression and potentially cardiac effects, with a toxic dose of 1.4 mg/kg. Atypical antipsychotics caused significant CNS depression (except risperidone); EPS were less common. Toxic doses were clozapine 2.5 mg/kg, olanzapine 0.5 mg/kg and aripiprazole 3 mg/kg. EPS responded to anticholinergic drug treatment. In summary, unintentional antipsychotic ingestion in children can cause severe effects that last 1-3 days, often with one tablet. Children potentially ingesting a toxic dose or who are symptomatic should be considered for assessment in hospital. Most cases resolve with good supportive care. Toxic doses are only estimates that are based on limited data and should be used with caution until prospective studies are undertaken.",

We have checked whether these drugs influence proliferation of endothelial cells and probably angiogenesis process. We have studied the effect of diazepam and chlorpromazine on proliferative activity and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release from murine endothelial HECa10 cells cultured in vitro. In conclusion, diazepam at concentration of 10(-4)M had inhibitory action on the proliferation of endothelial cells in cultures. Chlorpromazine at concentrations from 10(-7) to 10(-4)M diminished the proliferative activity and secretion of VEGF into supernatants of cultured cells.", 
    "34": "Drug- and toxin-associated seizures may result from exposure to a wide variety of agents. Obtaining a comprehensive history behind the exposure is generally more helpful than diagnostic testing. Most DTS may be managed with supportive care, including benzodiazepines, except in the case of agents that require a specific intervention or antidote.", 
    "35": "Toxin-induced hyperthermic syndromes are important to consider in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with fever and muscle rigidity. If untreated, toxin-induced hyperthermia may result in fatal hyperthermia with multisystem organ failure. All of these syndromes have at their center the disruption of normal thermogenic mechanisms, resulting in the activation of the hypothalamus and sympathetic nervous systems.The result of this thermogenic dysregulation is excess heat generation combined with impaired heat dissipation. Although many similarities exist among the clinical presentations and pathophysiologies of toxin-induced hyperthermic syndromes, important differences exist among their triggers and treatments. Serotonin syndrome typically occurs within hours of the addition ofa new serotonergic agent or the abuse of stimulants such as MDMA or methamphetamine. Treatment involves discontinuing the offending agent and administering either a central serotonergic antagonist, such as cyproheptadine or chlorpromazine, a benzodiazepine, or a combination of the two. NMS typically occurs over hours to days in a patient taking a neuroleptic agent; its recommended treatment is generally the combination of a central dopamine agonist, bromocriptine or L-dopa, and dantrolene. In those patients in whom it is difficult to differentiate between serotonin and neuroleptic malignant syndromes, the physical examination may be helpful:clonus and hyperreflexia are more suggestive of serotonin syndrome,whereas lead-pipe rigidity is suggestive of NMS. In patients in whom serotonin syndrome and NMS cannot be differentiated, benzodiazepines represent the safest therapeutic option. MH presents rapidly with jaw rigidity, hyperthermia, and hypercarbia. Although it almost always occurs in the setting of surgical anesthesia, cases have occurred in susceptible individuals during exertion. The treatment of MH involves the use of dantrolene. Future improvements in understanding the pathophysiology and clinical presentations of these syndromes will undoubtedly result in earlier recognition and better treatment strategies.", 
    "36": "In deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) neurons, inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) undergo long-term depression (LTD) following a 10-Hz stimulation, and long-term potentiation (LTP) after a 100 Hz stimulation of the inputs. Whole-cell recordings were made from DCN neurons and changes in IPSC sensitivity to diazepam after LTD and LTP investigated. Diazepam enhanced the evoked IPSC amplitude by 45% in controls and after LTD induction. However, after LTP induction, diazepam increased the IPSC by only 16%. Diazepam increased THIP response by 34% in controls, but by only 4% after LTP. These results suggest that during LTP the diazepam sensitive GABAA receptor sub-units undergo changes.", 
    "37": "The demographic, clinical and therapeutic features of the respiratory subtype of panic disorder (PD) versus the non-respiratory subtype were studied in a prospective design. Sixty-seven PD outpatients (DSM-IV), who had previously been categorized into respiratory (n=35) and non-respiratory (n=32) subgroups, were openly treated with clonazepam for a 3-year period. The principal measure of efficacy was the number of panic attacks, obtained from the Sheehan Panic and Anticipatory Anxiety Scale. In the first 8 weeks of treatment (acute phase), the respiratory subtype group had a significantly faster response to clonazepam. During the follow-up (weeks 12-156), the two subgroups did not differ significantly in the number of panic attacks experienced from baseline to end point. Patients in the respiratory subtype were characterized by a later onset of disorder and a family history of PD. Patients in the non-respiratory subgroup had a significantly higher number of past depressive episodes than those in the respiratory subgroup. The respiratory subgroup had a faster response after 8 weeks of treatment and an equivalent response in the 3-year follow-up period. Clonazepam had a sustained therapeutic effect over the entire treatment period.",

The liver pathology also revealed mild infiltration and fatty changes. He was suspected to be suffering from a cytokine storm followed by Reye syndrome.", 
    "39": "The involvement of adenosine receptor agonists in benzodiazepine withdrawal signs was evaluated as the seizure susceptibility of mice. The concomitant administration of subthreshold dose of pentetrazole (55.0 or 60.0 mg/kg, s.c.) with flumazenil (10.0 mg/kg, i.p.) in mice chronically treated with temazepam or diazepam induced the appearance of withdrawal signs: clonic seizures, tonic convulsions and death episodes. The administration of the selective A1 (CPA-N6-cyclopentyladenosine), A2A (CGS 21680-2-p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenethylamino-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine hydrochloride) and the non-selective A1/A2A (NECA-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine) adenosine receptor agonists (i.p.) evoked the significant attenuation of benzodiazepine withdrawal signs, and these effects were more expressed in temazepam- than in diazepam-dependent mice. CPA has shown the most apparent and dose-dependent attenuating effect. The results confirm that adenosine A1 and A2A receptors are involved in benzodiazepine withdrawal signs, and adenosine A1 receptor plays a predominant role in this phenomenon.", 
    "40": "Cognitive deficit is a significant symptom in schizophrenic patients. Use of atypical antipsychotics has been demonstrated to improve some cognitive functions in schizophrenics, as well as in patients with dementia. However, side effects like sedation and muscarinic antagonism induced by these drugs have detracted from this improvement. We are interested in determining the behavioural effect of acute and chronic treatments with olanzapine and clozapine, two atypical antipsychotics, in a paradigm of working memory, and the influence on behavioural response of possible motor effects during test performance. Unspecific muscarinic antagonist scopolamine has been used for comparison. Male Wistar rats were trained on the 8-arm radial maze up to an accuracy level in choice of 80%. Distance travelled in the maze was also measured during test performance. Acute olanzapine, clozapine and scopolamine caused significant impairment of correct performance. Rats treated with olanzapine and clozapine presented a decrease in motor activity level at the same time. After the test at acute dosage, rats were chronically treated for 14 days with olanzapine, clozapine or scopolamine and 24 h after the last dose were again tested in the 8-arm radial maze. Under this procedure, chronic treatment with olanzapine, clozapine and scopolamine did not impair correct task performance and did not modify distance travelled. We concluded that the sedative effect masked a possible effect on working memory after acute administration of olanzapine and clozapine, whereas chronic treatment with olanzapine, clozapine and scopolamine did not adversely affect working memory performance. In the case of scopolamine, it suggests that chronic muscarinic antagonism does not induce memory impairment and for atypical antipsychotics, it suggests that chronic treatment induced a tolerance to acute motor effects of these drugs.", 
    "41": "Dexmedetomidine is a highly specific alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist, which is now clinically used to induce sedation in patients in the intensive care units. Behavioural effects of dexmedetomidine have been little studied so far. The drug was reported to reduce behaviour such as locomotion or measures of anxiety or aggression in animals. The aim of the present study was to ascertain whether dexmedetomidine inhibits behaviour uniformly or with respect to particular stimuli or situations. Therefore, behavioural effects of dexmedetomidine were studied in the social conflict test in male mice (after three weeks of individual housing), which provides a wide spectrum of behavioural activities in two types of animals (aggressive and sociable mice) as well as in the activity cage. Dexmedetomidine (5-40 microg/kg i.p.) decreased locomotion in the activity cage and this effect was fully antagonized by atipamezole, a selective alpha2-adrenereceptor antagonist. However, dexmedetomidine did not reduce locomotion during social conflict. The only significant effects during social conflict were a selective and dose-dependent antiaggressive effect in aggressive mice and a selective reduction of social investigation ('sociability') in sociable mice. Thus, dexmedetomidine appears to inhibit predominantly dominant behaviour evoked by biologically important stimuli. The ability of dexmedetomidine to reduce aggression might be utilized for treatment of aggressive states. Sedation caused by dexmedetomidine can be easily disrupted and thus the drug may have an advantage over benzodiazepines or neuroleptics, which are used in this indication.", 
    "42": "Blood specimens from 210 drivers (179 male and 31 female) apprehended in Luxembourg from autumn 2001 to spring 2002 and requested for the determination of their blood alcohol concentration (BAC) were tested for medicinal drugs, illicit drugs, and chronic alcohol abuse (by quantification of the carbohydrate-deficient transferrin: CDT). These additional analyses were performed anonymously and with permission of state prosecutor. The 22.8% had consumed medicinal drugs, with benzodiazepines and antidepressants (10.9 and 7.6%, respectively) as main psychoactive classes. Cannabis was the most detected illicit drug (9.5%) but only one in three had THC detectable in their blood. Association of two or more psychoactive substances (poly-drug use) was observed in 27.6% of drivers (90.6% of drug consumers). On the basis of CDT values, 29.5% of drivers investigated were assumed to be chronic alcohol abusers. Statistical analysis revealed that chronic alcohol abuse and medicinal psychoactive drugs were associated with significantly higher BAC. Medicinal psychoactive drugs were clearly associated with poly-drug use, and were furthermore detected at supra-therapeutic levels in 34.9%.",

Pramipexole, a dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist and omega-3 fatty acids, a polyunsaturated fatty acid, augmentation to mood stabilizer (MS) had superiority to placebo in reducing depressive symptoms. Topiramate augmentation of an MS was equally as effective as Bupropion-SR. Patients treated with an MS responded well to the addition of agomelatine, a melatonin receptor agonist with 5-HT2C antagonist properties. However, inositol and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation did not separate from placebo. Lamotrigine and olanzapine, and to a lesser extent, divalproex, are superior to placebo in preventing depressive relapses. All agents were relatively well tolerated.",

    "55": "We present a case series (N = 46) of individuals apprehended in Sweden for driving under the influence of drugs (DUID). These cases were selected because the concentrations of amphetamine in blood were abnormally high (> 5.0 mg/L), the highest being 17 mg/L. In comparison, the median blood-amphetamine concentration in a population of DUID offenders (N = 6,613) was 0.70 mg/L. Among the DUID suspects with extremely high blood-amphetamine concentrations there were 38 men (83%) with mean age of 37.8 y (SD 6.8 y) and 8 women (17%) with a mean age of 34.1 y (SD 4.3 y). All had previously been registered in our database (mean 12 times, median 9 times) for drug-related offences, including DUID. The concentration of amphetamine in blood of female offenders was slightly higher than the concentration in male offenders (6.6 mg/L vs. 5.8 mg/L), although this difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The drugs other than amphetamine most frequently encountered in the blood samples were tetrahydrocannabinol and benzodiazepines (diazepam and nordiazepam). The commonest signs of drug use reported by the arresting police officers were bloodshot and glazed (watery) eyes, restlessness, talkativeness, exaggerated reflexes and slurred speech. Unsteady gait and dilated pupils were observed in some but not all individuals. These very high concentrations of amphetamine were tolerated without any fatalities indicating a pronounced adaptation to the pharmacologic effects of this central stimulant. Anecdotal information indicated that those with the very highest concentrations of amphetamine in blood had swallowed the drug to prevent being apprehended in possession of an illicit substance.", 
    "56": "Since the beginnings of twenty-first century in Poland increasing number of reports about the drug-facilitated sexual assaults have been observed. Many drugs have been identified as so-called \"date-rape drugs\", because of their pharmacological properties, especially inducing amnesia. These drugs are used for the purpose of \"drugging\" unsuspected victims and than raping them. In a typical scenario, the perpetrator surreptitiously adds \"date-rape drug\" to the alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage of an unsuspecting person, who is subsequently sexually assaulted while under the influence of this substance. Many victims do not report the incident until several days after the event or even do not report it at all. They report the incident so late after the events because they often have problems with remember the course of incident. It causes that victim is not reliable witness for justice. Detection of \"date-rape drugs\" in biological fluids is unequivocal evidence of perpetration. Analysis of biological fluids collected from victims of rapes for presence of drugs was rare in Poland up to now. The aim of this study is to show the use of \"date-rape drugs\" in Poland. Materials for this study were from the routine casework elaborated at the Institute of Forensic Research in Krak\u00f3w. APCI-LC-MS methods were applied for screening of biological fluids (blood and/or urine) for amphetamine and its 6 analogues, for 12 substances from benzodiazepine group and for quantification of the detected drugs. HPLC-DAD was used as a screening method for wide range of medicinal drugs, and NCI-GC-MS methods for determination of ketamine and tetrahydrocannabinols (delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, 9THC) and its metabolite (11-nor-carboxy-delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, THCCOOH). In 2000-2004, the biological fluids taken from 33 persons, both sexually assaulted or perpetrators were analysed. In 2000 and 2002 not any case of this type was registered, in 2001 only two cases were recorded. After 2003 significant increase in the number of these cases was observed. Eleven and twenty cases involving \"date-rape drugs\" were submitted to the Institute in 2003 and 2004, respectively. The most common substances detected in analysed materials were amphetamine (in concentrations ranged from 10 to 85 ng/ml) and 9THC (0.36-1.4 ng/ml). Alcohol (0.27-2.3% per hundred), MDMA (8-201 ng/ml), benzodiazepines (oxazepam, nordazepam, estazolam), propranolol and lidocaine were also found in blood and urine specimens.",

Patients poisoned with prescription medication (Rx group) were compared with those who overdosed nonprescription (OTC-group) medications (alone or combined with Rx). Relative frequency of medication drug poisoning was highest in the 40-49 age group (28.5%) and was followed by the group of young adults (20-29 years; 24.2%). The lowest frequency (2.2%) was noted in the 60-69 age group. Of 186 cases analyzed, in 163 (87.6%) prescription medication (Rx) and in 23 (12.4%) OTC alone or co-ingested with Rx were involved (chi2 = 63.9; p < 0.001). The Rx and OTC groups were not significantly different as to reason for poisoning (chi2 = 0.7; p = 0.792) with significant overrepresentation of deliberate ingestion in both the group analysed (chi2 = 114.39; p < 0.001 for Rx, and chi2 = 13.49; p = 0.002 for OTC). Most adults attempting suicide used Rx with the highest incidence in the 40-49 age group (31.1%). Adolescents (14-19 years) with female over-representation ingested rather OTC pharmaceuticals (40.9%). Acetaminophen (alone or combined with benzodiazepines or/and ethanol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were the most common OTC medications used for deliberate self-poisoning.",

In all of the cases combined drug intoxication with benzodiazepines and opiates have been proved. The impact of the combination of two toxic substances: the first causing rapid and brief suppression of the consciousness and the second, causing prolonged continuation of the already suppressed consciousness, on the clinical course is discussed. The similarities in the circumstances of the exposure, clinical course of the poisonings, the identified toxic substances, lead to the consideration of criminal characteristic of the poisonings. The contact with the corresponding authorities brought off the disclosure of a group of criminals, committed the intentional intoxications with the aim of robbery.

The main attention was put on reasons of self-intoxication, the timing of attempted suicide as well as the influence of intoxication on the mother and the child. For most admitted women it was their first pregnancy (12 cases, 63.2%). The week of pregnancy varied from 4 to 37 (mean 19 +/- 9.3) weeks. The most popular drugs for attempting suicide among pregnant females were benzodiazepines (7 cases, 36.8%). The most often reason of suicidal attempts was unplanned pregnancy (9 cases, 47.4%). There were two miscarriages and one premature birth observed in our cases. Acute self-poisonings during pregnancy appeared to be a relatively marginal problem in the analyzed toxicology clinics and occurred in merely 0.38% of all women hospitalized between 2001 and 2004 in both clinics. The main reason of suicidal attempts in pregnant women was unplanned pregnancy (9 cases, 47.4%). None of the studied females admitted that the main reason of suicidal attempt was an abortion induction.",

The doses of i.v. diazepam necessary to obtain maximal preoperative subjective tranquillity fell as a function of age. The AP and HR values respectively increased during intervention and decreased in the first hour of intervention. Normal psychomotor recovery was less evident in older patients.

    "73": "Synaptic transmission from cones is faster than transmission from rods. Using paired simultaneous recordings from photoreceptors and second-order neurones in the salamander retina, we studied the contributions of rod-cone differences in glutamate receptor properties and synaptic release rates to shaping postsynaptic responses. Depolarizing steps evoked sustained calcium currents in rods and cones that in turn produced transient excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in horizontal and OFF bipolar cells. Cone-driven EPSCs rose and decayed faster than rod-driven EPSCs, even when comparing inputs from a rod and cone onto the same postsynaptic neurone. Thus, rod-cone differences in EPSCs reflect properties of individual rod and cone synapses. Experiments with selective AMPA and KA agonists and antagonists showed that rods and cones both contact pharmacologically similar AMPA receptors. Spontaneous miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) exhibited unimodal distributions of amplitude and half-amplitude time width and there were no rod-cone differences in mEPSC properties. To examine how release kinetics shape the EPSC, we convolved mEPSC waveforms with empirically determined release rate functions for rods and cones. The predicted EPSC waveform closely matched the actual EPSC evoked by cones, supporting a quantal release model at the photoreceptor synapse. Convolution with the rod release function also produced a good match in rod-driven cells, although the actual EPSC was often somewhat slower than the predicted EPSC, a discrepancy partly explained by rod-rod coupling. Rod-cone differences in the rates of exocytosis are thus a major factor in producing faster cone-driven responses in second-order retinal neurones.",

Covered topics encompassed mental health and disease representations and access to mental health care in Kosovo following the war. At the time of the survey, health services were still widely disorganized and uncoordinated at the local level, with poor access to health care. This work shows that mental disorders remain very stigmatizing for patients and their relatives. Benzodiazepines are the first choice medication, to the detriment of other psychotropic categories. Traditional and religious representations of mental disease prevail in the general population.

    "79": "Benzodiazepine-like compounds (BZDs), either taken with the diet or synthesized by intestinal bacterial flora, may represent a precipitating factor for hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in cirrhotic patients. We evaluated whether a diet and/or treatment with rifaximin or lactulose can reduce serum concentrations of BZDs in 18 cirrhotic patients without HE. Patients were given a standard diet for 7 days to keep the dietary intake of BZDs constant and were then randomized to a 7-day treatment with rifaximin 1,200 mg/day, lactulose 10-20 g three times daily, or placebo. Blood samples were collected at enrollment, at the end of the diet and drug treatment periods, and 7 days after the drug was stopped (follow-up). Serum concentrations of BZDs were measured by a radioligand binding technique after high-performance liquid chromatography extraction and purification and were expressed as diazepam equivalents (DE). No change in serum BZD concentrations was observed during the diet, while a statistically significant decrease from 105.6 +/- 66.5 to 63.5 +/- 49.5 pmol DE/ml was achieved in rifaximin-treated patients (p < 0.05) but not in patients treated with lactulose or placebo. During the followup, serum BZD concentrations returned to 104.5 +/- 74.0 pmol DE/ml in rifaximin-treated patients (p < 0.05 vs. end-treatment values), while no significant change was observed in the lactulose- and placebo-treated patients. These data indicate that control of bacterial flora with cyclic administration of rifaximin plays a pivotal role in avoiding increased plasma concentrations of BZDs, which represent a precipitating factor for HE inpatients with severe liver disease.", 
    "80": "Drugs of abuse are known to cause persistent modification of neural circuits, leading to addictive behaviours. Changes in synaptic plasticity in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) may contribute to circuit modification induced by many drugs of abuse, including cocaine. Here we report that, following repeated exposure to cocaine in vivo, excitatory synapses to rat VTA dopamine neurons become highly susceptible to the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) by correlated pre- and postsynaptic activity. This facilitated LTP induction is caused by cocaine-induced reduction of GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor-mediated inhibition of these dopamine neurons. In midbrain slices from rats treated with saline or a single dose of cocaine, LTP could not be induced in VTA dopamine neurons unless GABA-mediated inhibition was reduced by bicuculline or picrotoxin. However, LTP became readily inducible in slices from rats treated repeatedly with cocaine; this LTP induction was prevented by enhancing GABA-mediated inhibition using diazepam. Furthermore, repeated cocaine exposure reduced the amplitude of GABA-mediated synaptic currents and increased the probability of spike initiation in VTA dopamine neurons. This cocaine-induced enhancement of synaptic plasticity in the VTA may be important for the formation of drug-associated memory.",

Despite systemic opiates and benzodiazepines, most patients experience significant pain during the procedure and in the recovery period. Paravertebral blocks allow the spinal nerve roots and sympathetic chain in the paravertebral space to be anesthetized, and their role in providing analgesia for thoracic and upper abdominal surgical procedures is well-established. Herein a case is described in which thoracic paravertebral blockade dramatically reduced standard intra- and postprocedural analgesic needs and provided superior pain control.", 
    "82": "During recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the use of psychotropic medication for the treatment of bipolar disorder (BPD) in children. There is an emerging set of data to support this use.Mood stabilizers, including lithium and valproic acid (valproate sodium), have generally formed the mainstay of treatment in children and adolescents with BPD. However, the atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, aripiprazole, and quetiapine may be more effective as first-line treatment options and in some ways easier to use than the traditional mood stabilizers. As in adults, mood stabilization is often difficult to achieve in pediatric patients with BPD, and combined treatment with mood stabilizers and atypical antipscyhotics is commonly used. Data from controlled trials of psychotropic medications in children and adolescents with BPD are very limited, and hence, in the majority of cases physicians base their treatment decisions on data from case reports, case series, or open trials. More controlled studies of both monotherapy and polypharmacotherapy for BPD in children and adolescents are needed.",

    "84": "We obtain the posterior predictive distribution of transition probabilities between symptom severity states over time for patients with schizophrenia by (i) employing a Bayesian meta-analysis of published clinical trials and observational studies to estimate the posterior distribution of parameters that guide changes in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores over time and under the influence of various drugs and (ii) by propagating the variability from the posterior distributions of the parameters through a micro-simulation model that is formulated based on schizophrenia progression. Results show detailed differences among haloperidol, risperidone and olanzapine in controlling various levels of severities of positive, negative and joint symptoms over time. For example, risperidone seems best in controlling severe positive symptoms while olanzapine is the worst in that during the first quarter of drug treatment; however, olanzapine seems to be best in controlling severe negative symptoms across all four quarters of treatment while haloperidol is the worst in this regard. These details may further serve to better estimate quality of life of patients and aid in resource utilization decisions in treating schizophrenic patients. In addition, consistent estimation of uncertainty in the time-profile parameters also has important implications for the practice of cost-effectiveness analysis and for future resource allocation policies in schizophrenia treatment.",

The LOQ of clobazam determined with the PDA detector is 10 microg/l. A convenient approach for determining the measurement uncertainty of the presented method--applicable also for other methods in an accreditation process--is presented. At low concentrations (<10 microg/l), measurement uncertainty was estimated to be about 50%, and at concentrations >180 microg/l, it was estimated to be about 15%.

    "90": "The aims were to identify predictors of treatment retention in an Israeli methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) clinic, and to compare the findings to other international settings. We prospectively studied 492 patients admitted since 1993 through 10 years to an Israeli MMT clinic associated with a university-affiliated tertiary care medical center. Analyses (Kaplan Meier and Cox regression) included methadone dose and urinalysis results (for methadone, cocaine, opiates, benzodiazepines, THC, amphetamines) of each patient in the first month and after 1 year in treatment (or during the last month if the stay was >3 months and <1 year) and patients' characteristics (modified ASI). The 1-year retention rate was 74.4%; 65.8% stopped opiate abuse after 1 year in treatment. On admission, 13.6% of patients had used cocaine: there was a net decrease of 61.6% after 1 year. Factors predicting prolonged retention in MMT treatment (Cox regression) were daily methadone dose of 100mg or greater, negative urine for opiates after 1 year, and being a parent on admission. We conclude that our good outcome results (high rate of retention after 1 year (74.4%), high proportion of opiate abuse cessation (65.8%), and net reduction in cocaine abuse, similar to normal standards in other MMT clinics elsewhere in the world, justify the expansion of the MMT clinic network in Israel in order to make treatment available to all those who need it.

    "91": "The aim of this study was to compare the effects of barbiturate, benzodiazepine and ketamine on flash-evoked potentials (F-VEP) in adult rabbits. A total of 36 animals were studied, 16 after pentobarbital endovenous (EV) infusion, 10 after midazolam EV administration, and 10 after ketamine EV infusion. Pentobarbital induced triphasic F-VEP, first negative (N1), second positive (P1), third negative (N2) waves, all with large amplitudes and P1 with well-defined morphology. Mean P1 latency was 33ms. Midazolam induced similar but less defined triphasic waves, with mean latency of 27ms. Ketamine induced poliphasic and poorly defined F-VEP, with mean first positive (P1) latency of 27ms. Statistical analysis showed more elongated latency for the pentobarbital group than the midazolam and ketamine groups. The results of this study suggest that the pharmacological effects of pentobarbital and midazolam on GABA neurotransmission in rabbit visual cortex may be different; another neurotransmission system, possibly cholinergic, may be involved. The ketamine effect seen in rabbit visual cortex seems to be different from pentobarbital and midazolam.",

We tested changes in locomotor activity (crossing) and in the defensive burying test in WP, and PS adult male Wistar rats having been submitted to a single 10 min session in a two-compartment cage. During this session, the WP rats received auditory and olfactory stimulation coming from a PS pair submitted to unavoidable electric footshocks (1 mA, dc, 0.5s, 0.5c/s, 10 min). This experiment was replicated in other groups pre-treated with vehicle or diazepam, and their urine was collected and analyzed by the static Head-Space and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HS-GC/MS) techniques. The WP group displayed a significantly higher crossing [F((2,45))=4.31, P<0.01] and more cumulative burying time [F((2,22))=4.73, P<0.01] than the control or PS groups. Diazepam (1mg/kg) reverted these changes. Our results indicate that the conspecific sensorial communication coming from the PS group produces anxiety probably mediated by 2-heptanone, since the HS-GC/MS analyses showed the highest amount of 2-heptanone in the urine from the PS group [F((2,42))=5.17, P<0.009].", 
    "99": "One-year rehospitalization rates of patients with bipolar disorder discharged on a mood stabilizer alone, a mood stabilizer plus a typical antipsychotic, or a mood stabilizer plus an atypical antipsychotic were examined. Time to rehospitalization was measured by using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) formula. Twenty-three percent of patients on a mood stabilizer alone, 27% of patients on a mood stabilizer plus a typical antipsychotic, and 25% of patients on a mood stabilizer plus an atypical antipsychotic were rehospitalized within 1 year of discharge. There were no significant differences in rehospitalization rate or time to rehospitalization between groups. One-year rehospitalization rates for patients on a mood stabilizer plus olanzapine or risperidone were 25%. The number of previous psychiatric hospitalizations contributed to the risk of readmission. Risk factors and medication costs should be considered when designing the optimal treatment plan for an individual patient. Long-term prospective studies are needed to better delineate the effectiveness of different pharmacotherapeutic regimens on the long-term treatment outcomes in patients with bipolar disorder.",

The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of symptoms of psychological distress and their associated factors among these residents. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among 1999 long-term care residents aged 65 and over. Nine hundred and eleven persons (45.6%) displayed at least one symptom of psychological distress either at one time or more in the week preceding data collection, and 22.4% were identified as psychologically distressed. Multivariate analysis indicated that psychological distress was associated with disruptive behaviours and benzodiazepine use among women residents, and with insomnia in men residents. In conclusion, when clinicians screen for mental health disorders, they should take into consideration that symptoms of insomnia or disruptive behaviours may mask psychological distress.",

Evaluation of anxiety-related animal behavior was performed by measuring the percent of time spent on the open arms and the percent of open-arm entries as conventional anxiety indices. The number of times displaying risk-assessment from a closed arm was also measured as an ethological anxiety index. Diazepam, an anxiolytic agent, enhanced the percent of time spent on the open arms and the percent of open-arm entries. The number of times displaying risk-assessment was not affected by diazepam in the present study. The percent of time on the open arms were depressed, and the number of times displaying risk-assessment were stimulated by 1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine (TFMPP), indicating that TFMPP acts as an anxiogenic agent. (Z)-3-Hexenol revealed anxiolytic activity and increased the percent of time spent on the open arms and decreased the number of times displaying risk-assessment. In the neurochemical study, diazepam had no effect on the content of 5-HT and its metabolite in the brain cortex or hippocampus. On the other hand, TFMPP inhibited the 5-HT turnover rate accompanied by the elevation of the 5-HT content and reduction of the 5-HIAA content in the brain cortex and hippocampus. (Z)-3-Hexenol significantly increased the 5-HT content without affecting the 5-HIAA content or the 5-HT turnover rate in the brain cortex or hippocampus. Changes in serotonergic activity in the cortex and hippocampus were suggested to be involved in the anxiolytic effect of (Z)-3-hexenol observed in the elevated plus-maze test.",

Patients with idiopathic RLS often report similar symptoms in family members. Secondary RLS may be due to medications, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, iron deficiency, neurological disorders, or rheumatoid arthritis. In secondary RLS, the management rests on treatment of the cause. Symptomatic treatment is warranted in patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms that adversely affect the quality of life.

Resolution only occurred years later when he developed quadriplegia arising from infective myelitis of the cervical cord (C4-5). He had concomitant vertebral osteomyelitis, which was successfully treated with intravenous antibiotics. With intensive rehabilitation, he recovered the use of his limbs, but had no recurrence of TD.

    "120": "The decline in bone mineral density that occurs after long-term treatment with some antiepileptic drugs is thought to be mediated by increased vitamin D(3) metabolism. In this study, we show that the inducible enzyme CYP3A4 is a major source of oxidative metabolism of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)] in human liver and small intestine and could contribute to this adverse effect. Heterologously-expressed CYP3A4 catalyzed the 23- and 24-hydroxylation of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). No human microsomal cytochrome P450 enzyme tested, other than CYP3A5, supported these reactions. CYP3A4 exhibited opposite product stereochemical preference compared with that of CYP24A1, a known 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) hydroxylase. The three major metabolites generated by CYP3A4 were 1,23R,25(OH)(3)D(3), 1,24S,25(OH)(3)D(3), and 1,23S,25(OH)(3)D(3). Although the metabolic clearance of CYP3A4 was less than that of CYP24A1, comparison of metabolite profiles and experiments using CYP3A-specific inhibitors indicated that CYP3A4 was the dominant source of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) 23- and 24-hydroxylase activity in both human small intestine and liver. Consistent with this observation, analysis of mRNA isolated from human intestine and liver (including samples from donors treated with phenytoin) revealed a general absence of CYP24A1 mRNA. In addition, expression of CYP3A4 mRNA in a panel of duodenal samples was significantly correlated with the mRNA level of a known vitamin D receptor gene target, calbindin-D9K. These and other data suggest that induction of CYP3A4-dependent 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) metabolism by antiepileptic drugs and other PXR ligands may diminish intestinal effects of the hormone and contribute to osteomalacia.",

The patch with OA exhibited the plasma level of more than 200 ng/mL at 10 min after administration, then the plasma concentration decreased gradually. The patch without OA displayed a plasma level of less than 30 ng/mL during 40 min after administration. To the contrary, in the in vitro drug permeation using a cellulose membrane, the patch without OA showed a three times faster permeation rate than the patch with OA, suggesting that the direct action of OA to mucosa might be associated with absorption enhancement. It was demonstrated that the patch with OA showed a good adhesion to oral mucosa and worked efficiently for rapid absorption of DZ.",

Ibuprofen (IBU) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were selected as model drugs and loaded onto the unmodified and functionalized SBA-15. It was revealed that the adsorption capacities and release behaviors of these model drugs were highly dependent on the different surface properties of SBA-15 materials. The release rate of IBU from SBA-15 functionalized by postsynthesis is found to be effectively controlled as compared to that from pure SBA-15 and SBA-15 functionalized by one-pot synthesis due to the ionic interaction between carboxyl groups in IBU and amine groups on the surface of SBA-15. However, SBA-15 functionalized by one-pot synthesis is found to be more favorable for the adsorption and release of BSA due to the balance of electrostatic interaction and hydrophilic interaction between BSA and the functionalized SBA-15 matrix.",

The melanin-concentrating hormone-1 receptor (MCHR1) may be a novel mechanism that is involved in the modulation of stress responses and affective states. The role of MCHR1 in neuroendocrine, behavioral, and neurochemical stress, and anxiety-related responses was examined by monitoring the effects of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and the selective MCHR1 antagonist, GW3430, in inbred C57Bl/6NTac and MCHR1-knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. Intracerebroventricular injection of MCH increased plasma corticosterone, and produced anxiety-related responses in the elevated plus maze. The selective MCHR1 antagonist, GW3430, blocked the neuroendocrine and behavioral effects of MCH and produced anxiolytic-like effects by itself in animal models of anxiety. Moreover, KO mice had an anxiolytic-like phenotype in behavioral models of anxiety, and GW3430 had anxiolytic-like effects in WT, but not KO mice. Lastly, stressor-evoked acetylcholine release within the prefrontal cortex of inbred and WT mice, but not KO mice, was blocked by GW3430. We show that MCH elicits anxiety-like responses and that the effects of a selective MCHR1 antagonist and the phenotype of KO mice are consistent with anxiolytic-like action. Distinct behavioral, physiological, and neurochemical stress, and anxiety-related responses were selectively modulated by the MCHR1, and these actions may involve corticolimbic regulation of stress responsivity and anxiety.",

We determined whether AT1 receptors were also important for the stress response of higher regulatory centers. We studied angiotensin II and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptors and benzodiazepine binding sites in brains of Wistar Hannover rats. Animals were pretreated for 13 days with vehicle or a central and peripheral AT1 antagonist (candesartan, 0.5 mg/kg/day) via osmotic minipumps followed by 24 h of isolation in metabolic cages, or kept grouped throughout the study (grouped controls). In another study, we determined the influence of a similar treatment with candesartan on performance in an elevated plus-maze. AT1 receptor blockade prevented the isolation-induced increase in brain AT1 receptors and decrease in AT2 binding in the locus coeruleus. AT1 receptor antagonism also prevented the increase in tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA in the locus coeruleus. Pretreatment with the AT1 receptor antagonist completely prevented the decrease in cortical CRF1 receptor and benzodiazepine binding produced by isolation stress. In addition, pretreatment with candesartan increased the time spent in and the number of entries to open arms of the elevated plus-maze, measure of decreased anxiety. Our results implicate a modulation of upstream neurotransmission processes regulating cortical CRF1 receptors and the GABA(A) complex as molecular mechanisms responsible for the anti-anxiety effect of centrally acting AT1 receptor antagonists. We propose that AT1 receptor antagonists can be considered as compounds with possible therapeutic anti-stress and anti-anxiety properties.", 
    "143": "The analysis of cardiac electrical restitution (the relationship between an action potential duration and its preceding diastolic interval) has been used to predict arrhythmia liability. However, the procedure to measure restitution is invasive and disrupts normal physiological autonomic balance. Dynamic analysis of sequential beat-to-beat ECG data was used to study restitution under normal sinus rhythm and to quantify changes in temporal hysteresis with heart rate acceleration/deceleration during QT prolongation. Congenital long QT (LQT) 1 and LQT2 syndromes during sympathetic stimulation were modeled because of their association with increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia. Temporal heterogeneity and hysteresis of restitution were examined in the conscious dog under varying conditions of delayed repolarization using either the selective inhibitors of the slowly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (R)-2-(4-trifluoromethyl)-N-[2-oxo-5-phenyl-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[e][1,4]diazepin-3-yl]acetamide (L-768,673); the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (1-[2-(6-methyl-2-pyridyl)ethyl]-4-methyl-sulfonylaminobenzoyl)-piperidine (E-4031); or a combination of both at rest and during heart rate acceleration with sympathetic stimulation using isoproterenol challenges. Impaired repolarization with the combination of E-4031 and L-768,673 increased heterogeneity of restitution at rest 55 to 91%, increased hysteresis during heart rate acceleration after isoproterenol challenge by approximately 40 to 60%, and dramatically reduced the minimum TQ interval by 72% to only 28 ms. Impaired repolarization alters restitution during normal sinus rhythm and increases hysteresis/heterogeneity during heart rate acceleration following sympathetic stimulation. Thus, dynamic beat-to-beat measurements of restitution could lead to clinically applicable ECG obtained biomarkers for assessment of changes associated with arrhythmogenic risk.",

The purposes of this study were to explore the early effects of olanzapine on serum levels of ghrelin, adiponectin and leptin, three recently identified hormones that play crucial roles in the regulation of energy balance and glucose metabolism. Thirteen patients with schizophrenia who had not received any medication in the 4 weeks prior to this study were included. The patients received olanzapine at an average dose of 14.5mg/day. Serum levels of ghrelin, adiponectin, leptin and insulin, as well as weight and fasting glucose, were investigated at the baseline and at 4 weeks. Serum ghrelin levels had decreased (p 0.03) and leptin had increased (p 0.02), while adiponectin and insulin levels had not significantly changed at Week 4 (p 0.29 and p 0.25, respectively). Weight had increased (p 0.01), while fasting glucose had not significantly changed (p 0.46). These findings suggest that ghrelin levels decrease and leptin levels increase after initiation of olanzapine therapy. Weight gain is also considered to be an early change, while change in insulin sensitivity is not an early change of treatment with olanzapine. Further large-scale and longitudinal studies are warranted to elucidate metabolic changes involving ghrelin, adiponectin, leptin and insulin and their impact on weight and glucose metabolism during treatment with olanzapine and other antipsychotics.", 
    "152": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) slowing is associated with clozapine side effects, e.g., sedation, and may predict treatment response during clozapine treatment. As olanzapine and clozapine share many pharmacological properties, we investigated whether EEG slowing during olanzapine treatment was related to therapy outcome and sleepiness in patients with schizophrenia. Participants were age- and gender-matched schizophrenic patients treated with olanzapine (n 54), receiving no pharmacological treatment (n 54), or cotreated with olanzapine and some other psychotropic drug (n 38). Their EEG recordings were assessed visually by the same rater blind to clinical data. The EEG scores were categorized using standardized forms. Patients with a poor treatment response did not differ significantly from those with a good response to treatment either in EEG patterns or in frequency of sleepiness. Olanzapine treatment was associated with increased rates of slow (70.4% vs. 22.3%) and sharp waves (22.2% vs. 7.4%), as well as of paroxysmal slow wave discharges (14.8% vs. 1.9%), but did not induce spike- or sharp-slow-wave complexes. Cotreatment with another antipsychotic further increased EEG abnormalities, whereas benzodiazepine administration diminished the olanzapine-induced EEG changes. The results show that olanzapine inducing both slow and sharp waves, as well as paroxysmal discharges, has a strong impact on EEG. However, as no spike- or sharp-slow-wave complexes were observed, the risk of epileptic seizure during olanzapine treatment can be regarded as low, as long as olanzapine is not combined with some other antipsychotic.", 
    "153": "Late-latency auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials are sensitive to some centrally acting drugs and to certain psychological interventions. In this experiment we compared the effects of acute doses of a benzodiazepine, diazepam and an H(1) histamine receptor-blocking sedative, diphenhydramine, on auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials within the latency range 100-500 ms in a fear conditioning paradigm. Twelve healthy males (18-30 years) participated in three sessions at weekly intervals in which they received diazepam 10mg, diphenhydramine 75 mg and placebo in a balanced, double-blind, crossover protocol. One hundred and twenty min after diphenhydramine or 60 min after diazepam, they underwent an 8 min recording period in which auditory evoked potentials elicited by 40 ms, 95 dB[A], 1 kHz tones, and somatosensory evoked potentials elicited by a mildly painful electric shock (1.8 mA, 50 ms) were recorded at Cz (vertex). Each session consisted of four blocks of trials in which either the sound pulse or the shock was presented. Alternate blocks were designated SAFE or THREAT ('context' conditions); in THREAT blocks subjects were warned that shocks would be delivered via electrodes placed on the wrist (electrodes were removed during SAFE blocks). In one SAFE and one THREAT block, the sound stimuli and shocks (shocks were delivered only in the THREAT block) were preceded by a 2 s conditioned stimulus (CS: a red light) ('cue' condition). Diazepam, but not diphenhydramine, reduced the amplitude of the P2 auditory evoked potential. The THREAT context was associated with increased N1 and reduced N2 potential amplitudes. The CS had no effect on the amplitudes, but markedly reduced the latencies of the N1, P2 and N2 potentials under the THREAT condition. Diazepam reduced the amplitudes of the somatosensory potential evoked by the shock; the CS shortened the latencies of the later components of the response. Diazepam and diphenhydramine were approximately equi-sedative in the doses used in this experiment, as judged by visual analogue self-rating scales. The results indicate that the suppression of late-latency auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials by diazepam is not simply a reflection of sedation. Late-latency evoked potentials can be modified by an aversive CS, but the components that are sensitive to the CS are different from those that are sensitive to diazepam.", 
    "154": "To evaluate use of methadone and dihydrocodeine prescription in a group of opiate-dependent patients attending a community/general practice drugs project data were recorded at enrollment in 1990 and at the beginning of 1995. Two hundred individuals were included, of whom 85% were receiving a prescription for an opiate and/or a benzodiazepine. There were no major differences between the groups receiving methadone and dihydrocodeine and retention in treatment, death rate and behaviour change was similar in both groups. Trends during the study period included an increase in methadone prescribing and towards longer-acting benzodiazepines. The slightly different effects of dihydrocodeine compared to methadone made it the opiate of choice for many and may indicate a useful addition to the longer-acting methadone. This may make it an alternative to the current experimenting with heroin, dextromoramide (palfium) and injectable methadone for opiate users resistant to control with oral methadone alone.",

    "156": "AMPA and NMDA receptors, abundantly expressed on striatal medium spiny neurons, have been implicated in the regulation of corticostriatal synaptic efficacy. To evaluate the contribution of both glutamate receptor types to the pathogenesis of motor response alterations associated with dopaminergic treatment, we studied the ability of the selective AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI-47261 and the selective NMDA receptor antagonists, MK-801 and amantadine, to mitigate these syndromes in rodent and primate models of Parkinson's disease. The effects of GYKI-47261 and amantadine (or MK-801), alone and in combination, were compared for their ability to modify dyskinesias induced by levodopa. In rats, simultaneous administration of subthreshold doses of AMPA and NMDA receptor antagonists completely normalized the wearing-off response to acute levodopa challenge produced by chronic levodopa treatment (P < 0.05). In primates, the glutamate antagonists GYKI-47261 and amantadine, co-administered at low doses (failing to alter dyskinesia scores), reduced levodopa-induced dyskinesias by 51% (P < 0.05). The simultaneous AMPA and NMDA receptor blockade acts to provide a substantially greater reduction in the response alterations induced by levodopa than inhibition of either of these receptors alone. The results suggest that mechanisms mediated by both ionotropic glutamate receptors make an independent contribution to the pathogenesis of these motor response changes and further that a combination of both drug types may provide relief from these disabling complications at lower and thus safer and more tolerable doses than required when either drug is used alone.",

The comparative effect of typical and atypical antipsychotic medications on neurocognition is controversial, and based primarily on studies with small samples and large doses of typical comparator medications. The present study assessed neurocognitive efficacy. It was hypothesized that olanzapine treatment would improve neurocognitive deficits to a greater degree than either risperidone or haloperidol treatment. This was a double-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel study with neurocognition assessed at baseline, and 8, 24, and 52 weeks. Per protocol, the haloperidol arm was discontinued. Four hundred and fourteen inpatients or outpatients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were treated with oral olanzapine (n = 159), risperidone (n = 158), or haloperidol (n = 97). Individual domains (executive function, learning and memory, processing speed, attention/vigilance, verbal working memory, verbal fluency, motor function, and visuospatial ability) were transformed into composite scores and compared between treatment groups. At the 52-week endpoint, neurocognition significantly improved in each group (p < 0.01 for olanzapine and risperidone, p = 0.04 for haloperidol), with no significant differences between groups. Olanzapine- and risperidone-treated patients significantly (p < 0.05) improved on domains of executive function, learning/memory, processing speed, attention/vigilance, verbal working memory, and motor functions. Additionally, risperidone-treated patients improved on domains of visuospatial memory. Haloperidol-treated patients improved only on domains of learning/memory.

GABA and GABA(A) subtype receptor agonist, muscimol, induced inward currents in a concentration-dependent manner in 74% of all cells. The current-voltage relationship for the GABA response indicated the GABA-induced current in SGCs is carried by Cl-. Bicuculline (BIC), strychnine (STR), and picrotoxin (PTX) suppressed the GABA response in a concentration-dependent manner. BIC and STR, and PTX blocked the GABA response in a competitive manner and in a non-competitive manner, respectively. For inorganic antagonists, Cd2+ and Ni2+ also inhibited the GABA response. On the other hand, Zn2+ failed to suppress the GABA response in SGCs. An antibiotic, benzylpenicillin, suppressed the GABA response. The GABA response was augmented by both a barbiturate derivative, pentobarbital (PB), and a benzodiazepine derivative, diazepam.

    "184": "Osmolarity reduction (20%) elicited 3H-norepinephrine (NE) efflux from rat cortical synaptosomes. The hyposmotic NE release resulted from the following events: (i) a Na+-dependent and La3+-, Gd3+- and ruthenium red-sensitive depolarization; (ii) a cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) rise with contributions from external Ca2+ influx and internal Ca2+ release, probably through the mitochondrial Na+-Ca2+ exchanger; and (iii) activation of a [Ca2+]i-evoked, tetanus toxin (TeTX)-sensitive, PKC-modulated NE efflux mechanism. This sequence was established from results showing a drop in the hyposmotic [Ca2+]i rise by preventing depolarization with La3+, and by the inhibitory effects of Ca2+-free medium (EGTA; 50%), CGP37157 (the mitochondrial Na+-Ca2+ exchanger blocker; 48%), EGTA + CGP37157 or by EGTA-AM (> 95% in both cases). In close correspondence with these effects, NE efflux was 92% decreased by Na+ omission, 75% by La3+, 47% by EGTA, 50% by CGP37157, 90% by EGTA + CGP37157 and 88% by EGTA-AM. PKC influenced the intracellular Ca2+ release and, mainly through this action, modulated NE efflux. TeTX suppressed NE efflux. The K+-stimulated NE release, studied in parallel, was unaffected by Na+ omission, or by La3+, Gd3+ or ruthenium red. It was fully dependent on external Ca2+, insensitive to CGP37157 and abolished by TeTX. These results suggest that the hyposmotic events, although different from the K+-evoked depolarization and [Ca2+]i rise mechanisms, are able to trigger a depolarization-dependent, Ca2+-dependent and TeTX-sensitive mechanism for neurotransmitter release.",

    "186": "Insomnia is a common and significant healthcare problem, and affects a large percentage of women seen by general practitioners, obstetrician-gynecologists and mental health professionals. Specific risk factors for insomnia may be gender-related, including higher prevalence rates of depression and anxiety among women, environmental and social factors, as well as reproductive-related factors (e.g., peri-menstrual difficulties and menopause-related symptoms). Sleep problems interfere significantly with daytime functioning and overall well-being, and may lead to serious clinical consequences. Treatment options include benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepines, nonprescription sleep aids, and non-pharmacologic interventions such as sleep hygiene measures. This article reviews the existing literature on the prevalence, clinical characteristics of insomnia in women, and highlights some of the treatment options available.

    "187": "Structural investigation of GABAA receptors has been limited by difficulties imposed by its trans-membrane-complex nature. In the present study, the topology of a membrane-proximal beta-rich (MPB) domain in the C139-L269 segment of the receptor alpha1 subunit was probed by mapping the benzodiazepine (BZ)-binding and epitopic sites, as well as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis. Ala-scanning and semiconservative substitutions within this segment revealed the contribution of the phenyl rings of Y160 and Y210, the hydroxy group of S186 and the positive charge on R187 to BZ-binding. FRET with the bound BZ ligand indicated the proximity of Y160, S186, R187, and S206 to the BZ-binding site. On the other hand, epitope-mapping using the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the MPB domain established a clustering of T172, R173, E174, Q196, and T197. Based on the lack of FRET between Trp substitutionally placed at R173 or V198 and bound BZ, this epitope-mapped cluster is located on a separate end of the folded protein from the BZ-binding site. Mutations of the five conserved Cys and Trp residues in the MPB domain gave rise to synergistic and rescuing effects on protein secondary structures and unfolding stability that point to a CCWCW-pentad, reminiscent to the CWC-triad \"pin\" of immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, important for the structural maintenance. These findings, together with secondary structure and fold predictions suggest an anti-parallel beta-strand topology with resemblance to Ig-like fold, having the BZ-binding and the epitopic residues being clustered at two different ends of the fold.",

In addition, we observed a medium weight reduction of 10.5 kg (range 1-20 kg).", 
    "189": "Insomnia is conceived as the subjective complaint of reduced sleep quantity and/or quality, even in the absence of objective verification of sleep loss; it is the outcome of the interplay of many environmental, biological, and psychological factors, which can be distinguished into predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating. Predisposing and precipitating factors include various demographic characteristics and the occurrence of psychiatric or somatic illnesses as well as other stressful life events. The perpetuating factors, responsible for the development of chronicity of the complaint of insomnia, mainly involve a 24-hour state of hyperarousal and a vicious cycle of sleeplessness causing fear of sleeplessness which in turn leads to further hyperarousal and more sleeplessness. Particular psychological characteristics, including excessive use of denial and repression as well as a strong propensity for internalisation of emotions, are also among the main factors contributing to the psychophysiological activation and state of hyper-arousability commonly encountered among insomniac patients. The treatment should not only focus on ameliorating sleeplessness, it should also address all those factors that cause and maintain insomnia. An integrative management of insomnia includes education on sleep hygiene measures, behavioural, cognitive and psychodynamic psychotherapies, and the utilization of sleep-promoting drugs. Among the latter, only for the use of benzodiazepine or benzodiazepine-like hypnotics exists sufficient evidence for efficacy as well as adequate information on their side-effect profiles. Thus, these compounds are considered as the drugs of choice for the treatment of insomnia. It is recommended that the use of hypnotic drugs is restricted to the initial period of treatment; they should be rationally utilized within the context of a broad therapeutic program, which is based on a sound doctor-patient relationship and includes sleep hygiene education and the application of certain psychotherapeutic techniques in an individualized manner.", 
    "190": "Recommendations for benzodiazepine (BZD) use suggest durations of no more than a few weeks, but studies report use for months, years, or even decades. This article examines the who (who are long-term users), why (why do they use BZD), what (what are patterns of long-term use) and how (how do they compare to all BZD users). The study population is from the National Population Health Survey in Canada which interviewed respondents four times at two-year intervals, asking about specific drugs use as well as demographic, lifestyle and health-related questions. Long-term BZD use was defined as BZD use for two successive cycles. Four percent of the Canadian population used BZD at any one time, half of whom also reported use in the previous cycle. Benzodiazepine users were more likely to be female, elderly, smokers, to prefer speaking a language other than English, to have insurance coverage for medication, and to have completed high school education. Almost none of these determinants predicted long-term use. Persons reporting BZD use in 2000 had an odds ratio (OR) of 38.6 for also using BZD in 1998, were more likely to use antidepressants (OR=8.5) and suffer from conditions such as poor health, stress, and pain. Most of these determinants had no association with long-term use or if they did at a considerably lower OR. Of the 395 BZD users in 2000, almost 48.4% also used BZD in the previous cycle and 17% in all three previous cycles. Benzodiazepine use in any previous cycle made BZD use in 2000 more likely, with use determined by how recent and the frequency of reported use, culminating in a very high OR of 83.3 for use in all three previous cycles. Continued use for any of the individual BZD tended to be largely for the same BZD. We conclude that: (1) the overriding determinant for BZD use was that of previous use; and (2) long-term use was not determined by the same factors as overall use, which is significant in developing approaches to dealing with long-term BZD use.",
