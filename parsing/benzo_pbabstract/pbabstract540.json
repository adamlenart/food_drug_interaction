The structure of Thyrotrophs, Corticotrophs, Gonadotrophs, and Mammotrophs cells were described. Ultrastructural modifications were not observed. It is concluded that the chronic treatment with diazepam did not produce any visible ultrastructural effects in the secretory cells of the adeno hypophysis; maybe because the diazepam has a short life time and due to the small effect of the diazepam metabolites in this species.", 
    "1": "In kindled rats, the administration of cysteamine (CSH, 200 mg/kg, i.p.) 4 h prior to a kindled seizure leads to long-term (up to 10 days) inhibition of kindled seizures. CSH (200 mg/kg, i.p.) also induces myoclonic seizures in kindled rats. We suggest that the long-term inhibition of kindled seizures might be the result of the myoclonus, not the somatostatin depletion as previously suggested. Prior administration of the short-acting benzodiazepine midazolam (5 mg/kg, i.p.) eliminated the CSH-induced myoclonus and prevented the long-term inhibition of kindled seizures. These results suggest that the CSH-induced long-term inhibition of kindled seizures is the result of an interaction between the myoclonic seizure and a subsequent kindled seizure.", 
    "2": "Benzodiazepine anxiolytics are known to pose risks associated with drug dependence, abuse, and withdrawal symptoms. Recently, a new antianxiety agent, buspirone, was introduced in the United States. Buspirone appears to lack abuse liability and does not lead to drug dependence or withdrawal symptoms. This article reviews the results of animal and clinical studies in which the potential for buspirone dependence or abuse and the effects of its withdrawal were assessed.", 
    "3": "Historically, the use of anxiolytic drugs has been associated with a relatively high incidence of side effects, particularly those related to central nervous system depression and sedation. These side effects can impair the patient's ability to function and, thus, interfere with the full achievement of therapeutic goals. In this article, the evolution of anxiolytic drug therapy from the perspective of safety and side effects is reviewed. Moreover, data concerning the safety of buspirone--a novel, non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic that has been shown to provide anxiolytic efficacy comparable to that of the benzodiazepines, but with a significantly lower potential for central nervous system depressant effects, interactions with alcohol, dependence, and abuse--are discussed.", 
    "4": "The benzodiazepine anxiolytics are effective drugs that offer significant safety advantages over the pharmacologic treatments of anxiety that preceded them. However, problems still remain with the benzodiazepines, including their potential interactions with a variety of central nervous system depressant medications. This article reviews drug-drug interactions for an effective new non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic, buspirone. To date, the data indicate that this drug does not potentiate the effects of measured amounts of alcohol and is less likely than diazepam to increase the number of side effects observed with a variety of prescription and over-the-counter drugs. When administered concomitantly on a short-term basis, buspirone does not seem to either potentiate or interfere with the effects of short- or long-acting benzodiazepine hypnotics.", 
    "5": "The treatment of anxiety is one of the leading problems in medicine today. Although traditional anxiolytic drugs have been effective in reducing the symptoms of anxiety, their efficacy has often been achieved at the expense of the patient's quality of life. The sedative side effects and impaired psychomotor functioning associated with the use of benzodiazepine anxiolytics not only impede the success of therapy, but jeopardize the patient's safety. This article addresses these salient issues and provides evidence suggesting that the antianxiety drug buspirone better achieves the goal of optimal anxiolytic therapy with minimal unwanted effects.", 
    "6": "Proper evaluation of anxiolytic therapy, involving the possible use of rating scales as well as the physician's skill in observation and communication, is essential in identifying the most appropriate treatment for a given patient and facilitating the management of therapy. These issues are discussed herein, using the clinical trials of buspirone, a new, nonsedating antianxiety agent, as a model for the process of drug selection.", 
    "7": "Ca2+-currents were recorded from single CA3 pyramidal cells in hippocampal slice cultures, voltage-clamped through a single Cs+ - or K+-filled microelectrode and perfused with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1 microM tetrodotoxin and 10 mM tetraethylammonium. The Ca2+-current was reversibly reduced by bath-perfused muscarine (10-100 microM). This effect was inhibited by pirenzepine (10 microM) or atropine (1 microM). In K+-filled cells, inhibition was preceded by a phase of inward current enhancement; this was considered to be secondary to rapid outward current inhibition induced it by muscarine since it was reduced when outward currents were previously inhibited with Ba2+. In partially clamped or unclamped cells inhibition of Ca2+-current leads to a shortening of the Ca2+-spike plateau.", 
    "8": "The anatomical localization of benzodiazepine receptors in the human cerebellar cortex was studied using quantitative autoradiography following in vitro labelling of cryostat sections with [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FNZ), and the pharmacology of these receptors has been characterized by computerized, non-linear least squares regression analysis of [3H]FNZ displacement by FNZ, CL218,872 and ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (ECC) binding to membranes. The autoradiograms demonstrated that benzodiazepine receptors were present throughout all layers of the human cerebellar cortex; high concentrations of receptors were present in the molecular layer, moderate concentrations were present in the granular layer and a much lower density of receptors was seen in the intervening Purkinje cell layer. The pharmacological studies indicated that the human cerebellar cortex contained a high concentration of homogeneous benzodiazepine receptors which have high affinity for FNZ, ECC and CL218,872, i.e. type I sites.", 
    "9": "Buspirone is a non-benzodiazepine drug with anxiolytic properties. It has been reported to induce a marked increase in the metabolism of dopamine in the striatum and the nucleus accumbens which is similar to that induced by neuroleptics. It has been suggested that the effect observed in the striatum reflects an action of buspirone on dopaminergic autoreceptors in both terminals and cell bodies. In the present study, presynaptic effects of buspirone on dopaminergic metabolism in the nucleus accumbens were investigated, and they were compared to the effects of the classical neuroleptic, haloperidol. Dopaminergic terminals were isolated by infusion of tetrodotoxin into the median forebrain bundle in order to evaluate the effects of buspirone and haloperidol on presynaptic receptors. Changes in dopamine metabolism were determined by in vivo voltammetry. Buspirone administered after interruption of the impulse flow did not affect dopamine metabolism. In contrast haloperidol treatment led to an increase in metabolism of dopamine. It is concluded that buspirone did not act at the presynaptic level and furthermore on dopaminergic autoreceptors.", 
    "10": "Some atypical muscarinic drugs were compared with classical drugs with respect to inhibition of specific binding of [3H]pirenzepine ([3H]PZ) and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) to membrane preparations of rat brain. The interactions of the agonists McN-A343 and carbachol with [3H]QNB at muscarinic sites in brain stem preparations were differently modulated in the presence of an excess of PZ. Moreover, McN-A343 exhibited a preferential affinity for [3H]PZ sites in whole brain membranes whereas carbachol bound with high affinity to [3H]QNB sites in brain stem preparations. Various muscarinic agonists and antagonists displayed different affinity patterns in the [3H]PZ and [3H]QNB binding. These data are indicative of two populations of pharmacologically distinguishable binding sites and support the concept of muscarinic receptor heterogeneity in rat brain.", 
    "11": "The Regional Drug and Poison Information Centre at Addington Hospital, Durban, received a total of 3,177 requests for information on poisoning during 1985, with the highest incidence in August.

    "12": "A sensitive and specific determination of benzodiazepines in biological fluids is described, based on reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The compounds are extracted with a C2 AASP cartridge within 5 min. The recovery ranges from 92 to 104% and is independent of the concentration. Using a suitable gradient elution, complete separation of nineteen benzodiazepines is achieved in 50 min with detection limits of less than 3 ng/ml in urine and 5 ng/ml in other biological fluids. Using a rapid-scanning multichannel detector, the identities of the benzodiazepines can be confirmed. Prazepam is employed as internal standard. The precision and accuracy of the described method are suitable for monitoring benzodiazepine levels in clinical studies and an example is given.", 
    "13": "The binding of [3H](+/-)L-364,718 (3S(-)-N-(2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine-3-yl )-1H-indole-2-carboxamide), an extremely potent nonpeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist, to digitonin-solubilized CCK receptors from rat pancreas was characterized. [3H](+/-)L-364,718 binding to digitonin-solubilized receptors was assayed using polyethylene glycol precipitation followed by rapid filtration to separate free and bound [3H](+/-)L-364,718. Specific [3H](+/-)L-364,718 binding to solubilized receptors was dependent on the digitonin and receptor concentration and, under optimal conditions, represented greater than 90% of the total binding. Scatchard analysis indicated a single class of binding sites with a Kd of 0.53 nM and a Bmax of 3.1 pmol/mg protein. Specific [3H](+/-)L-364,718 binding to solubilized CCK receptors was inhibited by both CCK receptor agonists and antagonists in a stereospecific manner. After solubilization, the affinities of various antagonists to displace specific [3H](+/-)L-364,718 binding were similar to those obtained with membrane-bound receptors; however, the affinities of CCK agonists were reduced 10-100 times. Collectively, the data presented indicate that [3H](+/-)L-364,718 represents a new antagonist ligand which has apparent advantages over the agonist ligand [125I]CCK in assaying digitonin-solubilized receptors. Gel filtration of the digitonin-solubilized CCK receptors followed by [3H](+/-)L-364,718 binding determinations revealed an estimated molecular weight of 400,000 daltons.", 
    "14": "In 20 patients with coma (grade 4: n = 7, grade 3: n = 8, grade 2: n = 2, grade 1: n = 3) due to benzodiazepine intoxication, solely or combined with alcohol or other psychoactive drugs, the effect of a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, Flumazenil (Ro 15-1788), was evaluated. In terms of coma depth, 80% of the patients responded to application of 1.96 mg Flumazenil as a mean with immediate awakening or improvement of at least two steps in coma grading. In those 3 patients, who failed to respond to Flumazenil, the history revealed amitriptyline or barbiturates to be responsible for the comatose state. The observed side-effects of Flumazenil included increase (n = 4) or decrease (n = 3) of blood pressure, increase of heart rate (n = 7), cutaneous flush (n = 1) and ventricular extrasystoles (n = 1). Agitation and generalized convulsions, each observed in 1 patient, presumably were due to an acute benzodiazepine-withdrawal rather than an intrinsic side effect of the antagonist. In conclusion, Flumazenil proved to be a potent antagonist of benzodiazepines in patients with severe coma and even may serve as a valuable diagnostic in cases of suspected benzodiazepine intoxication.", 
    "15": "The action of the central-type benzodiazepine-receptor agonist clonazepam on alpha-MSH release has been studied in vitro using perifused frog neurointermediate lobes. High concentrations of clonazepam (3.16 X 10(-5) and 10(-4) M) caused an inhibition of alpha-MSH release and this effect was reversed by the central-type benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788. High doses of GABA (10(-5) and 10(-4) M) induced a biphasic effect on pars intermedia cells: a brief stimulation followed by a sustained inhibition of alpha-MSH secretion. Administration of clonazepam (10(-5) M) in the presence of various concentrations of GABA (10(-6) to 10(-4) M) led to a potentiation of both stimulatory and inhibitory phases of alpha-MSH secretion induced by GABA. Ro 15-1788 completely abolished the potentiating effect of clonazepam. Thus our results indicate that endogenous benzodiazepine receptors may modulate the effects of GABA on alpha-MSH secretion.", 
    "16": "The influence of phosphatidylserine on ligand binding to the benzodiazepine/GABA receptor complex was assessed in rat cerebellar synaptic membranes and in a detergent-solubilized membrane preparation. Intact synaptic membranes or membranes solubilized with the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]propanesulfonate) were incubated with a range of concentrations of phosphatidylserine for 2 h at 4 degrees C, prior to use in radioligand binding assays. Phosphatidylserine, an endogenous membrane phospholipid, facilitated the site-specific binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to synaptic membranes and CHAPS-solubilized preparations. In addition, phosphatidylserine inhibited the facilitation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding induced by either cartazolate or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Although the maximum effect (38% facilitation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding; greater than 90% inhibition of the cartazolate action) was produced using 130 microM phosphatidylserine, a significant enhancement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding could be observed upon preincubation of synaptic membranes with concentrations of phosphatidylserine as low as 5 microM. These results suggest that endogenous phosphatidylserine may play a role in the regulation of benzodiazepine/GABA receptor function, possibly through modulation of the mechanisms which functionally link the various components of this complex receptor system.", 
    "17": "Experiments were undertaken to determine whether the anticholinergic actions of tricyclic antidepressants are mediated by a selective interaction with a subclass of muscarinic receptors. To this end, the potencies of these antidepressants to inhibit [3H]-QNB binding to rat brain cerebral cortical membranes was compared to their potencies as antagonists of carbachol-stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation in cerebral cortical slices and carbachol-induced inhibition of GTP-stimulated adenylate cyclase in striatal membranes. Whereas amitriptyline was more potent than pirenzepine, a selective muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist, in competing for [3H]-QNB binding sites and as an antagonist of carbachol-induced inhibition of adenylate cyclase, pirenzepine was substantially more active (ten-fold) than amitriptyline in blocking carbachol-stimulated phosphatidyl inositol turnover. Atropine was more potent than all other agents in these assays, failing to display any significant degree of selectivity. The results suggest that the tricyclic antidepressants, in particular amitriptyline, appear to be selective antagonists for muscarinic receptors associated with adenylate cyclase in striatal membranes. Given the current classification of cholinergic receptors, these findings indicate that the tricyclic antidepressants may be useful for defining the properties of M2 receptors in brain.", 
    "18": "Disturbance of sleep is a symptom of heterogeneous origin. Hypersomnia (excessive sleep during daytime) must be carefully distinguished from hyposomnia. Hypersomnic patients should be referred to a neurologist for further diagnostic workup; hypnotics may be dangerous in these patients. Medical, psychiatric and other cases of hyposomnia should be identified and treated as part of a comprehensive therapy plan. Counselling and application of the rules of sleep hygiene should be considered. When drug therapy is indicated, benzodiazepines are preferable. Because chronic insomnia causes serious impairment to the quality of life, prolonged treatment with hypnotics is sometimes unavoidable. However, their long term efficacy remains to be demonstrated.", 
    "19": "Hypoxaemia during oesophagogastroduodenoscopy is well documented and contributes to cardiac arrhythmias and occasional deaths from endoscopy. In 50 patients sedated with intravenous midazolam and examined with a large-diameter endoscope, oxygen desaturation was abolished by giving oxygen (2 litres/min) by way of nasal cannulae throughout the procedure.", 
    "20": "Antiarrhythmic activity of psychotropic agents, such as phenibut, eglonyl, azaphen, grandaxin, fali-lepsin, is demonstrated for the first time ever in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and ventricular extrasystole. It is dependent on the nature of the underlying heart disease, the psychopathologic syndrome and vegetative cardiac rhythm regulation type. Different trends of cardiac and hemodynamic change are produced by different psychopharmacologic agents. Differential long-term intermittent psychopharmacotherapy is proposed for the control of heart rhythm disorders.", 
    "21": "Most intensive care (ICU) patients need pharmacological sedation during ventilatory support. The short-acting drug midazolam might be preferable to neuroleptic agents and opiates because of its anxiolytic and sedative properties. The dosage of a drug given in a continuous infusion is based upon knowledge of its clearance and of the function of concentration and effect.", 
    "22": "A midazolam infusion (7.5 or 15 mg/h) was given to 16 patients receiving ventilatory support for 24 h. Clearance was estimated using the rule Cl = R/C (R = rate of infusion, C = concentration in steady state). To estimate the concentration of midazolam necessary for good sedation, the amount of supplementary injected neuroleptic during midazolam infusion was compared with that of the day before. Plasma cortisol and parameters of energy metabolism, electrolytes, and liver and kidney function were measured.", 
    "23": "Patients with disease of abdominal organs showed the lowest values for clearance (1.0-2.92 ml/min/kg). Some of the injured patients showed elevated values for clearance (3.0-21.36 ml/min/kg). Elimination half-life ranged from 1.5-50 h. Changes in intestinal perfusion or cardiac output might be responsible for the wide range. For good sedation, plasma midazolam concentrations had to be above 600 ng/ml. Plasma cortisol levels were not affected by midazolam, nor were metabolism, electrolytes, or liver and kidney function.", 
    "24": "Continuous infusion of midazolam is a useful way of sedation for ICU patients, but the wide range of clearance values must be considered.", 
    "25": "An acute administration of MCI-2016 at the doses of 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg (p.o.), and 10, 20 and 30 mg/kg (i.p.) produced a slight CNS depression in rats, such as, sedation, ptosis, decrease in motor activity and systemic muscle relaxation. In a direct physical dependence test, rats were fed the MCI-2016-admixed food together with drinking water ad libitum for 24 hours daily for 51-71 days (mean MCI-2016 intake 29.9-210.7 mg/kg/day), on the gradedly increased dosage schedule with a dosage level of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/g food to 4 mg/g food. In a natural withdrawal following administration of MCI-2016, no significant withdrawal signs were observed in any group. In a naloxone-precipitation test the rats that were treated with MCI-2016-admixed food did not show any withdrawal signs. In a substitution test in either morphine or barbital dependent rats, no suppression of withdrawal signs or maintenance of dependence were observed by cross-administration of MCI-2016. In conclusion, MCI-2016 was considered to have no physical dependence potential.", 
    "26": "The effect of clobazam, a 1,5-benzodiazepine, on kindling seizures was compared with the effects of 1,4-benzodiazepines, diazepam and bromazepam, in amygdaloid and hippocampal kindled rats. After kindled seizures were established (stage 5 seizure), the test drugs were administered intraperitoneally. In amygdaloid kindled rats, clobazam significantly suppressed the motor seizures (MS) at doses of 20 and 50 mg/kg and significantly shortened the duration of after-discharge (AD) at doses of 10 to 50 mg/kg. Diazepam at doses of 2 to 10 mg/kg and bromazepam at 1 to 5 mg/kg also significantly suppressed the MS and significantly shortened the duration of AD. Similar suppressive effects by these three benzodiazepines were observed in hippocampal kindled rats. From these results, clobazam was found to have a qualitatively similar but weaker anticonvulsive effect than those of 1,4-benzodiazepines.", 
    "27": "Pain and muscle spasms are causes of postoperative complaints and complications following spinal surgery. The traditional medical management makes use of narcotic analgesics. The antispasmodics, diazepam and baclofen, might also be effective in pain control. A randomized prospective study of 50 consecutive patients was conducted comparing a regimen of a narcotic analgesic (meperidine hydrochloride) and the two antispasmodic agents versus the narcotic alone with the hope of reducing the requirement, postoperatively, of the narcotic and also the subjective assessments of pain and/or spasm. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the regimen in relieving postoperative spasm. The percentage of patients requiring narcotics and the assessed pain severity were essentially uniform between the groups. Whereas postoperative spasm was a common lament, it did not represent a significant element of postoperative pain when judged by these criteria.", 
    "28": "Rats were trained to bar press for sucrose reinforcement following daily injections of 20 mg/kg pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), 5 mg/kg diazepam (DZ), or saline. At the end of 12 days of this training, all injections were suspended for the remainder of the experiment. Five days later, the rats were given 10 days of Pavlovian fear conditioning (two trials per day) to establish a light as a shock signal. Next, the rats were returned to the bar press situation to test the capacity of the light to suppress responding. Rats previously treated with DZ showed stronger conditioned fear of the light than did rats originally trained following injections of either PTZ or saline. In contrast, bar pressing by PTZ-treated rats was less suppressed by light than was control performance. The results indicate that modification of the behavioral effects of environmental stressors can be a long-term consequence of drug treatments. DZ treatments had the long-term effect of increasing behavioral disruption by a stressor, while treatment with PTZ reduced the stressor's negative behavioral impact. These findings appear compatible with the idea that behavioral sensitivity to stressors is dependent, in part, on learning about the stimulus properties of internal states.", 
    "29": "Buspirone has been introduced as a novel non-benzodiazepine anti-anxiety agent. The Conditioned Suppression of Drinking (CSD) paradigm is an \"animal model\" for anxiety which provides information on both the relative potency and relative efficacy of anti-conflict agents. The present study compared the anti-conflict effects of buspirone to those of more \"classical\" anti-anxiety agents, diazepam and phenobarbital. In daily 10-minute sessions, water-deprived rats were trained to drink from a tube which was occasionally electrified (0.5 mA), electrification being signalled by a tone. Within 2-3 weeks control CSD responding had stabilized (approximately 15-20 shocks/session and 10-15 ml water/session); drug tests were conducted at weekly intervals. Diazepam and phenobarbital markedly (400-500%) increased the number of shocks received at doses which did not depress background responding (i.e., water intake). A number of agents, most notably morphine and ethanol, did not reliably affect punished responding in the CSD. Administered IP, low doses (0.25-1 mg/kg) of buspirone increased punished responding only slightly (less than 100% increase); higher doses (2, 4 mg/kg) depressed background responding. Administered SC, buspirone (0.125-1.0 mg/kg) had more potent effects on both punished and unpunished responding; again, anti-conflict efficacy was only marginal. These results suggest that buspirone might be less effective than the benzodiazepines in the management of anxiety.", 
    "30": "Previous studies have provided information about the reliability and validity of verbal descriptor scales of sensory intensity and unpleasantness and have shown that these two dimensions can be differentially affected by pharmacological manipulations. Since the relation between these dimensions and the general term 'pain' is not known, two experiments developed a verbal descriptor scale of painfulness and compared the sensitivity of this scale to pharmacological manipulations used previously with scales of sensory intensity and unpleasantness. In exp. I, 20 subjects used cross-modality matching to both handgrip force and tone duration to quantify the amount of pain implied by verbal descriptor phrases such as 'slightly painful,' 'somewhat painful' and 'very painful.' Ratio scales of relative magnitude for each individual were highly correlated within subjects (mean r = 0.92) and between a scale from each individual and a combined scale from others in the group (mean r = 0.93). These correlations indicate agreement between individual scales; an individual's scale values were predicted equally well by that individual or by a group of similar persons. In exp. II, 4 groups of 10 subjects rated the magnitude of painful tooth pulp sensations by choosing pain descriptors from randomized lists. Seven electrical stimuli spaced between individually determined pain threshold and tolerance values were delivered in random sequence 6 times before and after double-blind intravenous infusions of placebo, 0.11 mg/kg diazepam, 0.66 microgram/kg fentanyl or a combination of the diazepam and fentanyl doses. Mean responses were reduced significantly after all active drugs but not after placebo. These results suggest that the term pain does not represent a simple combination of sensory intensity and/or unpleasantness and shows that the sensitivity to an inert placebo, an active placebo, and an analgesic can vary with the type of pain assessment procedure.", 
    "31": "We have characterized the muscarine receptors in bovine tracheal and left ventricular membranes using 3H-dexetimide/pirenzepine and 3H-dexetimide/AF-DX 116 competition studies. Pirenzepine exhibited low (M2) affinity binding to both preparations; Kd was 590 nM in left ventricle and 463 nM in trachea. AF-DX 116 exhibited high (M2) affinity binding to left ventricle (Kd = 95.6 nM); in tracheal membranes it bound with high (M2) affinity (Kd = 40.7 nM) to 74% of the receptors and with low (M3) affinity (Kd = 2.26 microM) to 26% of the receptors. It is concluded that bovine tracheal muscle membranes contain a heterogeneous population of muscarine binding sites, the majority having M2 (heart) subtype characteristics and being located on the smooth muscle membranes; a minority having M3 (exocrine gland) subtype characteristics and presumed to be located in submucosal glands. This is the first report of high affinity binding of AF-DX 116 to non-cardiac peripheral muscarine receptors.", 
    "32": "The effects of subchronic administration of various psychotropic agents on the density of 5HT 2 receptor binding sites in rat cerebral cortex were investigated. In addition to antidepressant agents, some neuroleptic drugs including chlorpromazine (CPZ), spiperon, and cisflupentixol reduced the numbers of 5HT-2 receptor binding sites after 21 days treatment. The more selective D-2 antagonist haloperidol and sulpiride were totally ineffective in this regard. Anxiolytic agents, benzodiazepine derivatives were also ineffective. Central 5, 7-DHT-induced lesion of 5HT neurons demonstrated that intact 5HT neurons were not required for the reduction of 5HT-2 receptors by desipramine (DMI). Co-administration of DMI and alpha-2 antagonist yohimbine (YOH) produced down-regulation of 5HT-2 receptors within 3 days, whereas each agent alone did not produce such effect. The effect of 3-day treatment with mianserin (MIA, alpha-2 and 5HT-2 antagonist) alone and DMI plus YOH producing 5HT-2 down-regulation, were not prevented by the pretreatment with DSP-4 which selectively destroyed NE neurons. These results suggest that the synaptic availability of 5HT may not be required for DMI-induced down regulation of 5HT-2 receptor binding sites, and the mechanisms mediated through postsynaptic alpha-2 and 5HT-2 receptors are important factors in the regulation of 5HT-2 receptor density. Evidence suggests that the 5HT-1 receptor site is functionally linked to adenylate cyclase in the brain, but a biochemical effector system which is linked to the 5HT-2 receptor site has not been found. The metabolism of inositol phospholipids in response to 5HT was, therefore, investigated in human platelets using sensitive radioisotopic method of Berridge (1983). In platelets prelabeled with 3H-myo-inositol, in Ca++ free HEPES buffer containing 10 mM LiCl, 5HT caused a dose-dependent accumulation of inositol-1-phosphate (IP1) during 15 min incubation. A maximal increase in IP1 formation was observed at 30 microM of 5HT and the EC50 value was 4 microM. Ketanserin, a selective 5HT-2 receptor antagonist was a potent inhibitor of 5HT-stimulated IP1 accumulation, with a Ki value of 12 nM, but a selective 5HT-1 antagonist, (-)-propranolol (1 microM) failed to block the 5HT response. These results indicate that 5HT is activating 5HT-2 receptors, but not 5HT-1 in human platelets. CPZ and imipramine inhibited 5HT-stimulated IP1 accumulation, with Ki values of 124 nM and 2.56 microM, respectively.", 
    "33": "The ontogeny of muscarinic cholinergic receptors has been studied in different regions of the human fetal brain. For a comparison, the same study has been carried out on newborn and premature brain. Regarding on the areas examined (frontal cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, thalamus and basal ganglia) either an increase or a decrease of receptor density during gestation was observed. Thus, the ontogeny of the receptors follows a different pattern in areas which differ in function, cholinergic innervation and embryological origin. However, in all the regions the affinity of the binding site for the ligand [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate [3H]QNB was very similar to that reported for muscarinic receptors from adult mammalian brain. Data obtained from agonist binding (acetylcholine and carbachol) revealed the presence of a high (H)- and a low-affinity binding site (L) from 10 weeks of gestation. The selective antagonist pirenzepine (PZ) also distinguished two different muscarinic receptor subtypes, which however had higher affinity than that seen in adult brain. In conclusion, during ontogeny, the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor shares some but not all of the pharmacological properties shown in the adult brain.", 
    "34": "Fifty ASA Class III patients were divided randomly into two equal groups for induction of anaesthesia with diazepam 0.25 mg/kg, or midazolam 0.15 mg/kg. All subjects were premedicated with a narcotic and monitored by ECG, radial arterial catheter and a spirometer for measurement of minute ventilation. The QF interval (time period from the Q wave of the ECG to the foot of the radial artery pulse), mean arterial pressure, heart rate and minute ventilation were recorded before, during and immediately after the induction of anaesthesia. Although mean arterial pressure fell slightly (6%) following midazolam, all other cardiovascular variables were stable in both groups. Minute ventilation was depressed to 70% of control by both drugs and nearly one-half the diazepam patients complained of pain on injection compared with only one midazolam patient. These data suggest that midazolam is a reasonable alternative to diazepam for induction of anaesthesia in the high-risk patient.", 
    "35": "The influence of premedication and intraoperative narcotic administration on the incidence of vomiting after E.N.T. surgery was studied over a six-month period in 596 children. A high incidence of vomiting was found after intramuscular papaveretum and hyoscine and after oral diazepam. Oral trimeprazine tartrate was associated with a low incidence of vomiting and was found to have an anti-emetic effect when an opiate analgesic was administered after induction of anaesthesia.", 
    "36": "In a randomized double-blind study with parallel group design involving 60 anxious psychoneurotic outpatients, the anxiolytic activity of alprazolam was compared with that of oxazepam. Following a 4 to 7-day placebo washout period, both groups showed a similar and significant response to treatment during the 4-week active treatment phase. An important intergroup difference emerged in the fear/anxiety component of the Lipman SRSS with the alprazolam groups showing a significantly greater mean reduction from the baseline score. During alprazolam treatment there was also a significant reduction in the depression factor score of the Lipman SRSS by the termination of the study and for all 4 weeks combined. Furthermore, the global impression of treatment was judged by patients as more favourable towards alprazolam than towards oxazepam. Only one person in each group reported a serious side effect. The results indicate that the anxiolytic activity of alprazolam is at least as good as that of oxazepam.", 
    "37": "The influence of zopiclone, a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic, on male reproductivity and the recovery of the influences were examined in rats since it was found that oral administration of zopiclone to male rats produced sperm death and infertility at doses of 50 mg/kg or more. In the present study, zopiclone was administered orally by gavage at doses of 50 and 250 mg/kg once daily for 6 weeks to male rats of 8 weeks old. The rats were paired with untreated female rats at the end of the 2nd, 4th, and 6th weeks of administration and of the 2nd, 4th, and 6th weeks after termination of the administration. As the results, the copulation rates were 100% in the 50 mg/kg group, but the rate was low in the 250 mg/kg group at the end of the 2nd week of administration. The pregnancy rates of 0% and low motility and morphological abnormalities of the sperm were observed in the zopiclone-treated groups at the end of the 2nd week of administration. In the histological examination of the male reproductive organs, such changes as arrest of spermatogenesis and dilation of the epididymal ducts filled with the sperm were observed in the 250 mg/kg group at the end of the 2nd week of administration. In the recovery observation, the ability to impregnate female rats and the condition of the sperm recovered in the 50 mg/kg group at the end of the 2nd week of recovery. In the most rats of the 250 mg/kg group the ability to impregnate female rats and the condition of the sperm recovered at the end of the 4th and 6th weeks of recovery. However, in some rats of the 250 mg/kg group the ability to impregnate female rats and the condition of the sperm were still not recovered at the end of the 6th week of recovery.", 
    "38": "Binding of two acidic drugs, sulfisoxazole and diazepam, to serum proteins has been investigated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and in a control group of healthy volunteers. Marked increases in the free fraction of both drugs in serum were detected in patients (14.5 +/- 0.8% versus 6.1 +/- 0.3% in the case of sulfisoxazole, and 5.8 +/- 0.5% versus 3.2 +/- 0.0% in the case of diazepam). Decreased serum albumin concentration appeared to play a role in the defective binding of sulfisoxazole, although when this factor was corrected, some correlation between serum binding of sulfisoxazole and PaO2 values was detected. Other factors have to be considered to explain the decreased binding of diazepam in the serum of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.", 
    "39": "Psychotropic drug surveys serve to provide retrospective control of actual treatment conditions in psychiatric hospitals. Data of overall drug consumptions and those indicating the time pattern of medication were recorded at 7 census days for 1,415 inpatients of the psychiatric hospital of the Free University of Berlin. Drug-treated patients with 3.15 different psychotropic drugs on average during their stay. Neuroleptics were the most chosen compound group with regard to all patients treated (62.2%), the number of prescriptions (48.3%) and the sum of psychotropic days (57.9%). Sedatives (i.e. benzodiazepines and chloralhydrate) were given to more patients than antidepressants (41.0% vs. 29.3%), but accounted for only 5.7% of all psychotropic drug days (21.4% in case of antidepressants). The analysis of time pattern revealed that the prescription of neuroleptics was favoured on all census days, while prescribing for antiparkinsonian and lithium drugs increased also over time, but not for sedatives. Mean daily doses of most neuroleptics peaked near the 10th day after the patients' admission, while those of antidepressants increased steadily until the patients were discharged. Monotherapy was found in 59.0%, drug combinations in 41.0% of prescriptions (on all census days). The proportion of drug combinations in relation to monotherapy increased the longer the patients were in hospital. Among all drug combinations, two drugs had been combined in 79.2%, three or more in 20.8%. Two or more neuroleptics given simultaneously were involved in 44.9% of all combinations--an unexpected finding calling for more systematic investigation.", 
    "40": "The elimination of 14C-hydrogenated analogue of phenazepam and its metabolites was studied in inbred C57B1/6 (B/6), BALB-c (C) and CBA mice. The kinetics of two-phase elimination of 14C-compounds with urine and feces was similar in all the above mouse strains. The excretion was realized mainly with feces, exceeding elimination with urine 5-6-fold in B6 mice and 10-11-fold in C and CBA mice. Some interstrain quantitative differences in metabolite composition were found. No metabolite was detected whose concentration would indicate a predominating direction of biotransformation of 14C-hydrogenated phenazepam analogue or distinguish it from other mouse strains. In the organism of mice, 14C-hydrogenated phenazepam analogue undergoes active aromatic hydroxylation and methoxylation via heterocycle (and possibly via chlorine-containing ring). At the same time dehydrogenation of 14C-hydrogenated phenazepam analogue molecule was not recorded.", 
    "41": "One hundred gynaecological patients for laparoscopy divided into five groups were studied to determine the effects of a number of pretreatments on serum myoglobin, creatinine kinase and myalgia following intermittent suxamethonium administration. One group acted as controls, while the other groups were given intravenous pretreatments of alcuronium 2 mg, midazolam 0.15 mg/kg, lignocaine 1.5 mg/kg and suxamethonium 7 mg. Serum myoglobin was determined by radio-immunoassay. The mean increases in the control group were 167 micrograms/litre myoglobin at 20 minutes and 196 IU creatinine kinase at 24 hours; 13 out of 20 patients responded with a marked increase of serum myoglobin at 20 minutes and of creatinine kinase at 24 hours. Only alcuronium pretreatment prevented myoglobin increase at 20 minutes, abolished creatinine kinase increase at 24 hours and reduced 24-hour myalgia. The other pretreatments slightly reduced myoglobin increase at 20 minutes and 24-hour creatinine kinase but did not reduce myalgia. Only one patient in the whole study had markedly elevated serum myoglobin at 24 hours. We conclude that only non-depolarising relaxant pretreatment is effective in the reduction of some of the adverse effects of suxamethonium administration.", 
    "42": "Sixty-three patients (ASA 1-2), scheduled for elective surgery under general anaesthesia, were randomly given either oral clonidine (225-375 micrograms) + diazepam (5 15 mg), cimetidine (300 mg the night before and 300 mg in the morning) + diazepam or only diazepam for premedication. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone and maintained with N2O + O2 (70:30), enflurane and fentanyl. Vecuronium bromide was used as a muscle relaxant. The sleep dose of thiopentone was significantly smaller in the patients pretreated with clonidine than in the other groups. The mean maximal increase in heart rate was lowest in the clonidine-pretreated patients, but there were no significant differences in the mean arterial pressure changes associated with intubation. Before and just after intubation and in the recovery room, the arterial pressures were lowest in the patients pretreated with clonidine. During anaesthesia, marked bradycardia (less than or equal to 45 beats min-1) did not occur more often when clonidine was used, but in the recovery room there were statistically significantly more patients with bradycardia in the clonidine group than in the other groups. On the electrocardiogram (ECG) during the endotracheal intubation, the incidence of bigeminy was higher in the diazepam patients (5/20) than in the cimetidine patients (2/20) and the clonidine patients (0/23). There were significantly more gastric content samples with a pH above 2.5 in the cimetidine group than in the other groups, and clonidine patients did not differ from diazepam patients in this respect. The high incidence of bradycardia with the concomitant hypotension may limit use of this drug to highly selected patients.", 
    "43": "The anticonvulsive activity (ED50), acute toxicity (LD50), and minimal neurotoxicity (TD50) of diazepam in an emulsion form (Diazemuls) were compared with two different water-based diazepam solutions (Valium and Stesolid). The diazepam preparations were administered intravenously to male mice. After determination of time of peak drug activity, the ED50's were established against pentetrazol-induced convulsions, at peak drug activity. The most important difference between the three diazepam preparations was a significantly higher LD50 of diazemuls (275 mg/kg) compared to valium (49 mg/kg) and stesolid (51 mg/kg). ED50 was: diazemuls 0.24 mg/kg, valium 0.14 mg/kg and stesolid 0.10 mg/kg. The therapeutic indices (LD50/ED50) were thus calculated to be 1146 for diazemuls, 350 for valium and 510 for stesolid. Time of peak drug activity and TD50 were equal for all three drugs. No signs of pain on injection or necrosis were observed following diazemuls, whereas this was common after valium and stesolid.", 
    "44": "Because under certain conditions, seizure activity electrically elicited from layers III and IV of the inferior collicular cortex can spread into forebrain regions, potential inferior collicular interactions with the amygdala were studied. Following acute electrical initiation of seizure activity from the inferior colliculus, no changes in amygdala EEG activity were noted. Following repetitive stimulation of the inferior colliculus, however, postictal spiking activity was noted in the amygdala, similar to interictal spiking reported for amygdala kindling, but this abnormal EEG activity did not coincide with any observable behavioral change. Conversely, the course of amygdala kindling in animals previously stimulated in the inferior colliculus progressed quite differently in comparison to control animals. Those animals repetitively stimulated in the inferior colliculus required a significantly greater number of amygdala kindling stimulations to reach class 5 seizure activity than did animals that received no inferior collicular stimulation and, unlike the controls, the chronic inferior collicular stimulation group usually regressed to class 2 or 3 seizure activity after the first class 5 seizure. Furthermore, the chronic inferior collicular stimulation group all exhibited wet-dog shakes during the amygdaloid kindling stimulation, whereas at no time did controls exhibit wet-dog shake behaviors. Finally, the seizure generalization from the inferior colliculus appears to be mediated by a mechanism distinct from the acute seizure activity, because a dose of diazepam (0.4 mg/kg), or carbamazepine (10 mg/kg), which had no effect on the wild running seizure, blocked behaviors indicative of seizure generalization. The significance of these results to epilepsy is discussed.", 
    "45": "Midazolam given as hourly intermittent injections was compared with the same dose given by infusion for postoperative sedation in patients after cardiopulmonary bypass. A stable concentration was rapidly attained with the infusion whereas 6-8 h was required to attain stable plasma (trough) concentrations in the intermittent injection group. Plasma concentrations decreased rapidly to low values within 6 h of discontinuation of therapy. High plasma concentrations and a long (16 h) half-life were noted in one patient who may be a slow metabolizer of the drug.", 
    "46": "The pharmacokinetics of midazolam during total i.v. anaesthesia were determined in 15 female patients undergoing major surgery. Midazolam was administered together with an analgesic drug and a neuromuscular blocking drug. The dose regimen of midazolam, based on simulations, included two consecutive infusions following a bolus injection at the induction of anaesthesia. Multiple blood samples were drawn and a two-compartment open model was fitted to the measured plasma concentrations. Plasma clearance (483 ml min-1), apparent volume of distribution (1.94 litre kg-1) and terminal half-life (3.1 h) were in agreement with other reports. Thus, there was no obvious evidence that the surgical procedure or the concomitant use of other drugs, or both, influenced the pharmacokinetics of midazolam. The relatively rapid elimination makes midazolam suitable for use by infusion in a total i.v. technique.", 
    "47": "This study analyzes age, weight, and drug doses using cimetidine hydrochloride, flurazepam hydrochloride, and digoxin as tracers. Data were obtained for 1797 patients (mean age, 72 years) filling consecutive prescriptions from a national pharmacy service. With all three drugs, patients with lower weight received substantially higher doses with correlations of weight vs dose, based on milligrams per kilogram of body weight, ranging from -0.34 to -0.40. Because body weight declines with increasing age, lower-weight patients are also older and at greatest risk for drug toxicity. Patients weighing 50 kg or less (n = 155) received milligram-per-kilogram doses that were 31% to 46% higher than the group mean and 70% to 88% higher than patients weighing more than 90 kg. For all three study drugs, as patient weight declines, the mean milligram-per-kilogram dose rose sharply. There was no trend seen toward reducing doses for older patients. Low body weight, in addition to advanced age, is a major risk factor for overmedication. Physicians must recognize the need to reduce drug doses for their low-weight elderly patients.", 
    "48": "The authors relate their clinical experience with 46 panic disorder patients who were receiving 3-10 mg/day of alprazolam. Fifteen (33%) developed symptoms consistent with DSM-III criteria for major depression despite remission of their panic symptoms. Clinicians should be alert to this potentially reversible complication.", 
    "49": "Magnesium deficiency plays an important role in alcohol withdrawal syndromes. Parenteral replacement of magnesium in the form of magnesium sulfate is safe and diminishes the severity of withdrawal symptoms in recently alcohol-abstinent patients. Early diagnosis of withdrawal illness and institution of magnesium replacement therapy decrease the need for benzodiazepines, diminish withdrawal complications and reduce the length of hospital stay. Testing for serum magnesium levels is useful, but experience supports the empiric use of magnesium replacement therapy in alcohol withdrawal.", 
    "50": "The objectives of this study were to investigate the absorption of diazepam applied topically to the hairless mouse in vivo and to determine the diffusion of diazepam across isolated hairless mouse skin and human skin. [14C]Diazepam was readily absorbed after topical administration to the intact hairless mouse, a total of 75.8% of the 14C-label applied being recovered in urine and feces. Diazepam was found to diffuse across human and hairless mouse skin unchanged in experiments with twin-chambered diffusion cells. The variation in diffusion rate or the flux for both human and mouse tissues was greater among specimens than between duplicate or triplicate trials for a single specimen. Fluxes for mouse skin (stratum corneum, epidermis, and dermis) were greater than for human skin (stratum corneum and epidermis): 0.35-0.61 microgram/cm2/h for mouse skin vs 0.24-0.42 microgram/cm2/h for human skin. The permeability coefficients for mouse skin ranged from 1.4-2.4 X 10(-2)cm/h compared with 0.8-1.4 X 10(-2)cm/h for human skin. Although human stratum corneum is almost twice the thickness of that of the hairless mouse, the diffusion coefficients for human skin were 3-12 times greater (0.76-3.31 X 10(-6) cm2/h for human skin vs 0.12-0.27 X 10(-6) cm2/h for hairless mouse) because of a shorter lag time for diffusion across human skin. These differences between the diffusion coefficients and diffusion rates (or permeability coefficients) suggest that the presence of the dermis may present some barrier properties. In vitro the dermis may require complete saturation before the diazepam can be detected in the receiving chamber. [14C]Diazepam was not detected in the receiving chamber of the Franz cell apparatus in experiments with human skin. This indicated that the rate of diffusion was less than 0.09 microgram/cm2/h. Since this diffusion technique more closely resembles topical administration to humans, these results appear to indicate that achieving therapeutic concentrations in humans may be difficult. In addition, the hairless mouse may not be a suitable model for predicting percutaneous absorption of diazepam in humans.", 
    "51": "Night-terrors and somnambulism are comparatively rare in adults and are most often associated with stage 4 sleep, especially delta activity. Although the data are limited, reports suggest that imipramine, which may control nocturnal enuresis, a stage 4 sleep disorder, and diazepam, which suppresses stage 4 sleep, may effectively treat the condition. This paper describes two patients with night-terrors and somnambulism who responded to imipramine but not to diazepam. Possible mechanisms of diazepam and imipramine, including effects on stage 4 sleep and pervasive anxiolytic actions, are discussed.", 
    "52": "Different methods for measuring GABA turnover in rat brain were compared. One method was based on the irreversible inhibition of GABA transaminase (EC 2.6.1.19) by microinjection of gamma-vinyl-GABA into neostriatum of rat. The accumulation of GABA was almost linear for 4 hr. The GABA turnover in control animals was estimated to be 25.8 +/- 1.1 nmole/mg protein/hr. Another method was based on the post mortal increase in GABA level in an 8 min interval after decapitation. This method gave a GABA turnover of 54.3 +/- 4.8 nmole/mg protein/hr in neostriatum. The methods were compared with respect to their ability to detect the effect of high doses of diazepam and morphine on the turnover rate of GABA. The GABA transaminase inhibition method resulted in a 27% and a 17% decrease in GABA turnover for diazepam and morphine respectively. The post mortem method did not detect any change in GABA turnover after administration of these drugs. Hypoglycemia leads to a decrease in GABA turnover of 17% with the GABA transaminase inhibition method and a 43% decrease in GABA turnover with the post mortem method. The advantages and limitations of the methods for estimating GABA turnover changes during drug exposure is discussed, and are compared with results from a third method based on steady state kinetics extracted from the literature.", 
    "53": "The longitudinal muscle of the guinea pig ileum is well known to contract in response to stimulation of either muscarinic or histamine H1 receptors. However, we found that simultaneous application of agonists to both receptors, methacholine (MeCh) and histamine (Hist), at their maximum concentrations (both at 10(-5) M), induced a contraction of the muscle with a pattern very similar to that observed with MeCh alone. In the muscle contracted by MeCh, a muscarinic antagonist, atropine, caused a transient relaxation, but a histamine H1 blocker, pyrilamine, had no effect on the tension. Experiments using pirenzepine indicated that muscarinic-M1 receptors did not seem to be involved in the mechanism of this phenomenon. The atropine-induced relaxation was not affected by phentolamine (10(-6) M), propranolol (10(-6) M) or tetrodotoxin (10(-6) M). After pretreatment of the muscle with 10(-5) M MeCh for 10 min, the contractile effect of 10(-5) M Hist was suppressed intensely for a certain time period, but that of 10(-5) M MeCh was not diminished. On the other hand, pretreatment of the muscle with 10(-5) M Hist for 10 min did not influence the contraction by either MeCh or Hist. The suppression by MeCh of the Hist action developed dependently on the concentration of MeCh and the time length of exposure to MeCh, and the persistence was temperature-dependent. Furthermore, this suppression was not surmounted by the elevation of Hist concentration. A similar phenomenon was also observed in the muscle which was immersed in the nutrient solution without CaCl2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "Psychotropic drug intake was assessed in participants aged 30-69 years of two identically designed studies (cross-sectional studies based on random samples), the Munich Blood Pressure Study (MBS I 1980/81) and the Luebeck Blood Pressure Study (LBS 1984). A similar increase of drug intake with age and a preponderance of women among drug users were found in both study samples. On the basis of the total drug consumption, which was not substantially different in the two population samples, it is argued that the statistically significantly lower prevalence rate for benzodiazepine use found in the LBS, compared with the findings of the MBS I, suggests a real decline over time and cannot be merely explained by possible regional differences in prescription behavior. This finding is of importance within the context of the ongoing discussion on increasing dependence on benzodiazepine drugs.", 
    "55": "A dog model was used for direct measurement of the sphincter of Oddi using endoscopy. The effects of anticholinergic agents and a selective antimuscarinic agent on the canine sphincter of Oddi motility were studied. Manometric tracing at the canine sphincter showed rhythmical phasic contractions which were not affected by respiration. The mean values of the basal motility were as follows: the peak pressure was 61.5 +/- 2.2 (m +/- SE) cmH2O, trough pressure was 2.18 +/- 1.2 cmH2O, and the frequency was 17.4 +/- 0.2 waves/min. Intravenous administration of atropine sulfate, butropium bromide, butylscopolamine bromide and also pirenzepine significantly reduced the amplitude and frequency of canine sphincter contractions. From these results, it appeared that the cholinergic autonomic nervous system might be the one of the regulators of the canine sphincter of Oddi activity.", 
    "56": "Discrepancies between perceptions of internal or external circumstances and innate or acquired expectations lead to patterned stress responses involving several homeostatic systems, of which the sympathoadrenomedullary system (SAMS) is one. Severe, generalized threats such as hypoglycaemia, hypoxia, haemorrhage, circulatory collapse, and fight/flight situations elicit generalized SAMS activation, including cardiac stimulation, splanchnic, cutaneous, and renal vasoconstriction, and usually preserved skeletal muscle blood flow. Patterned sympathetic neural responses, resulting in redistribution of blood volume or changes in glandular activity, occur during orthostasis, exercise, altered environmental temperature, the postprandial state, and performance of attention-requiring tasks. In all these situations, SAMS activity is co-ordinated with that of the parasympathetic nervous system, the pituitary-adrenocortical system, and probably several neuropeptide systems. Although acute stress-induced SAMS activation can be a health hazard, the role of chronically repeated, stress-induced SAMS activation in the development of cardiovascular disease remains unclear. Benzodiazepines, beta-adrenoceptor blockers, and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists can attenuate effects of stress-induced SAMS activation, but pressor responses often are maintained.", 
    "57": "Protein complexes containing the c-fos protein (Fos) and (Fos)-related antigens were isolated from serum-stimulated fibroblasts and from nerve growth factor plus benzodiazepine-treated pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, and investigated by high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The results show that Fos is complexed with a basic 39-kDa protein (p39) in fibroblasts, and primarily with an acidic 40-kDa protein (p40) in PC12 cells. Whole cells lysates from both cell types contain p40, suggesting that the interaction of Fos and other cellular proteins is dependent on the differentiated state of the cell. In addition to p39 and p40, a heterogeneous population of polypeptides of approximately 48 kDa are present in Fos complexes isolated from non-denatured extracts of either cell type. These proteins may represent a minor class of Fos-binding proteins. Analysis of extracts prepared under denaturing conditions using antisera raised against a Fos peptide (amino acids 127-152) reveals a series of Fos-related antigens. These antigens are induced, some with a slower kinetics than Fos, in fibroblasts and PC12 cells. Thus, c-fos may represent a marker for a family of genes, some of which are antigenically related, that are part of an early cellular transcriptional response to diverse extracellular stimuli.", 
    "58": "MIDAZOLAM IS SUPERIOR TO DIAZEPAM IN CERTAIN WAYS: it has a more rapid onset; produces greater anterograde amnesia, less postoperative drowsiness, less venous irritation and less likelihood of thrombophlebitis development. However, additional clinical trials may be necessary before it can replace the widely used diazepam.", 
    "59": "Psychiatric underdiagnosis of panic disorders is due to its particular somatization profiles. Cardial somatization is very common, but focal neurological symptoms and a pattern of gastro-intestinal complaints deserve more attention. Recent research into biological data is discussed, and the importance of psychological issues--childhood separation or sexual victimisation--and cognitive factors is stressed. Breaking up outcome data in degree of remission and relapse rate for an exact judgment of different treatment strategies is needed.", 
    "60": "Good physician-patient rapport and an anxiolytic, sedative, and amnesic premedication are necessary for comfortable, stress-free surgery under local anesthesia. Sufficient experience exists with the intramuscular and intravenous administration of the new benzodiazepine midazolam (Dormicum), while knowledge relating to its oral administration is still scant. Therefore, in a randomized double-blind study midazolam was investigated for oral premedication prior to local anesthesia: two dosages of midazolam were studied and compared with diazepam and placebo. One hour prior to ophthalmic surgery under local anesthesia, four randomized groups of 30 patients each, received a tablet of 7.5 or 15 mg midazolam, 10 mg diazepam, or a placebo. Following this medication, the anxiolytic, sedative, amnesic, and side-effects were determined at defined points of time during the day of surgery and the 1st postoperative day. Anxiolysis was determined using the \"state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI)\" of Spielberger et al.; sedation was assessed according to Pandit et al.; amnesia was determined by recall of picture cards which had been presented to the patients 50 min after premedication; and patients were asked about 13 side-effects typical of benzodiazepines in a standardized way. Anxiety increased little following the placebo; it decreased significantly following 10 mg diazepam and more markedly following 7.5 and 15 mg midazolam. Sedation increased little following the placebo; it increased more and similarly 50 min after the benzodiazepines; after 90 min the sedative effect was most marked for 15 mg midazolam. However, sedation was of shorter duration after midazolam than after diazepam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Diazepam, diazepam combined with droperidol, trimeprazine and trimeprazine combined with droperidol were compared in a double-blind trial in conjunction with a standardised inhalational anaesthetic technique employing an intraoperative narcotic. Trimeprazine produced significantly more preoperative sedation (P less than 0.001) and was associated with enhanced postoperative analgesia (P less than 0.01). The incidence of postoperative vomiting was significantly less in the group receiving trimeprazine (P less than 0.001). The addition of droperidol to diazepam and trimeprazine only marginally improved the performance of those drugs but significantly prolonged postoperative recovery times. This was more marked when droperidol was combined with trimeprazine.", 
    "62": "The extent of acid secreting areas and the distribution of intestinal metaplasia in patients with erosive gastritis, and the healing effects of pirenzepine were examined. Studies were done with the endoscopic Congo red-methylene blue test developed in our hospital. Compared with control patients with no gastroduodenal disease, erosive gastritis was associated significantly more frequently with large acid secreting areas, but little or no intestinal metaplasia was detected in the stomach. A double blind trial was carried out, using 100 mg pirenzepine tablets or placebo for three months in 43 patients with erosive gastritis. Endoscopically, complete healing was significantly more frequent in the pirenzepine treated groups three months after the start of the treatment, as compared with the placebo treated group (p less than 0.05).",

In 251 patients undergoing major surgery the same drug was also given as a hypnotic the night before the operation. Both active drugs shortened the sleep-onset time, decreased the number of spontaneous awakenings at night and improved the quality of sleep when compared to placebo. The active drugs were significantly better than placebo as premedication when assessed by both the patients and the anesthesiologist. In 351 patients admitted for day-case minor surgery with no previous night medication, flunitrazepam was significantly better than placebo as premedication when assessed by both the patients and the anesthesiologist, while oxazepam was only better than placebo when judged by the anesthesiologist, not by the patients.",

Benzodiazepine premedication and benzodiazepine/opioid combinations are often used in anesthesiology. A prolonged benzodiazepine action in combination with narcotics can cause problems in the postoperative period such as respiratory depression or aspiration of gastric contents due to reduced vigilance. Therefore, a reversal of the central effects of benzodiazepines can be of advantage postoperatively.

Intraperitoneal administration of zopiclone reduced the GABA turnover rates in both the striatum and hippocampus, as estimated from the rate of GABA accumulation after inhibition of GABA transaminase by aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA). The effect of zopiclone on AOAA-induced accumulation of GABA in the hippocampus and striatum was blocked by the intraperitoneal injection of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-3505. Furthermore, zopiclone slightly but significantly decreased GABA content in the hippocampus, the decrease being blocked by coadministration of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788. Our results confirm that the GABAergic system plays a role in the mechanism of action of zopiclone.", 
    "69": "A double-blind cross-over randomised study was performed to investigate whether Ro15-1788 (Anexate) adequately reversed the conscious sedation with midazolam so that patients were clinically recovered and fit for discharge quicker than when midazolam was used alone. Twenty-eight healthy patients between 18 and 34 years sedated with midazolam for bilateral 3rd molar surgery, one side being operated on at each visit. Ro15-1788 or normal saline (placebo) was given at the end of the surgical procedure at the first visit and the alternative at the second visit. Recovery with Ro15-1788 was significantly quicker than with the placebo, both by subjective (86%) and objective (93%) evaluation. Patients' evaluation indicated that only 61% were more alert at home with Ro15-1788. Postoperative adverse effects were similar in both groups.", 
    "70": "This paper deals with the detection of drug residues on the hands of human subjects. The results demonstrate that detectable amounts of particulate matter are transferred to the hands by brief contact with drug tablets. A sampling and analysis method has been developed, and is based on the aspirating and trapping of drug microparticles on a filter plug, to be followed by thermal desorption directly into an ion mobility spectrometer. The technique is suited for initial field screening in clinical and forensic applications. The major drugs detected were diazepam, amitriptyline, codeine, acetaminophen, nitroglycerin, and delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-THC).", 
    "71": "Acute effects of several antiepileptic drugs on low-frequency amygdaloid-kindled seizures were assessed. The number of stimulating pulses required for the provocation of epileptic afterdischarge (pulse-number threshold, PNT) was used as an indicator for the seizure-generating threshold. The duration of epileptic afterdischarge (AD duration) was used as an indicator for the severity of the induced seizures. Phenytoin (PHT) and carbamazepine (CBZ) reduced AD duration more than did elevating PNT. Conversely, phenobarbital (PB) and diazepam (DZP) elevated PNT more than did reducing AD duration. Weak effects on the two indicators, valproic acid (VPA) and ethosuximide (ESM), were observed. Low-frequency kindling may be a useful experimental model of epilepsy in drug-assessments.", 
    "72": "In the present study the effects of perinatal diazepam (DZP) exposure on behavior and benzodiazepine binding site characteristics in offspring were investigated. Pregnant F344 rats were treated during the last trimester of gestation with vehicle or diazepam (3 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg). Lactating dams were similarly treated on postnatal days 1-7. Both prenatal and postnatal exposure to diazepam resulted in significant effects on the acquisition and extinction of active avoidance behavior measured postweaning. The number of trials to extinction of one-way active avoidance behavior was significantly greater in offspring exposed gestationally to 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg diazepam and postnatally to 10 mg/kg diazepam. The mean response latencies for all diazepam treated groups were significantly shorter than those of the vehicle treated rats during the first 15 trials under extinction conditions. In contrast, neither gestational nor postnatal diazepam exposure significantly affected either acquisition or retention of a passive avoidance task. In addition, the binding affinity between the benzodiazepine type I selective ligand, CL218,872, and cortical membranes, as well as the degree to which GABA potentiated 3H-flunitrazepam were significantly altered by perinatal diazepam exposure. No treatment altered the approximate number of benzodiazepine binding sites in either the cortex, hippocampus, or cerebellum. The results of this study further support diazepam as a behavioral teratogen and give new evidence for neurochemical effects following gestational as well as postnatal diazepam exposure.", 
    "73": "The effects of a benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist (FG 7142) on gastric ulcer formation were studied in restrained rats. FG 7142 (10-50 mg/kg) reduced in a dose-dependent fashion both the number and cumulative length of gastric ulcers elicited by restraint for 2 hr at 4 degrees C, but did not affect ulcer formation in unrestrained animals maintained in this environment. FG 7142 also reduced gastric ulcer formation in restrained rats maintained at 22 degrees C for 5 hr. The ability of FG 7142 to reduce restraint-stress induced gastric ulcer formation was blocked by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist ZK 93426 and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. These findings suggest that FG 7142 produces a benzodiazepine-receptor mediated reduction in gastric ulcer formation, which may result from its ability to increase activity of the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "74": "In previous studies the effects of CGS 9896, a pyrazoloquinoline ligand at benzodiazepine receptors, in rats trained to discriminate benzodiazepines from vehicle, have been variable. The present experiment confirmed that this compound produced responding on the drug-lever in rats trained to discriminate 5 mg/kg of chlordiazepoxide from saline, and showed that CGS 9896 did not antagonise the effect of chlordiazepoxide in this test. In contrast, CGS 9896 antagonised the stimulus properties of zolpidem (2 mg/kg), a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic, which displaces benzodiazepines from their binding sites. The drug CGS 9896 also antagonised responding on the drug-lever produced by chlordiazepoxide in rats trained with zolpidem. The beta-carboline, ZK 91296, produced effects similar to those of CGS 9896, giving rise to responding on the drug-lever in rats trained with chlordiazepoxide and antagonising the zolpidem cue. These results demonstrate the mixed agonist-antagonist effects of CGS 9896 and ZK 91296 and suggest that the stimulus properties of chlordiazepoxide and zolpidem may be mediated by different sub-types of benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "75": "1-Methylisoguanosine, a marine natural product analogue of adenosine, with moderate activity as a benzodiazepine receptor ligand, has previously been shown to have muscle-relaxant and hypothermic activity in mice in vivo. The present experiments showed that the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro15-1788 did not block the in vivo muscle-relaxant and hypothermic effects of 1-methylisoguanosine, suggesting that these particular actions are not due to interactions with benzodiazepine receptors. When applied by microiontophoresis near spontaneously-active neurones or neurones activated by ACh, DL-homocysteate or glutamate in the ventrobasal thalamus of anaesthetized rats, 1-methylisoguanosine had a depressant action; it was similar to adenosine in potency and in its ability to be antagonized by 8-(parasulphophenyl)theophylline. The depression was usually longer lasting than that caused by adenosine, consistent with previous neurochemical data showing it to be resistant to adenosine deaminase and a poor substrate for the uptake system for adenosine in the CNS. These results suggest that the major pharmacological/behavioural actions of 1-methylisoguanosine in vivo are more likely to be caused by an interaction with adenosine receptors, rather than with benzodiazepine sites.", 
    "76": "Guide cannulae for unilateral or bilateral micro-injection were implanted stereotaxically into the dorsal hippocampus of the male adult Sprague-Dawley rat. Following post-operative recovery, the animal's individual preference for ethyl alcohol in concentrations from 3-30% (v/v) was tested over a 9-day period by a three-bottle, two-choice technique. Following this pre-screen, 3.0 microliter of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline (TH beta C) hydrochloride, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, was infused in a concentration of 25-200 ng into the hippocampus of each unrestrained rat twice a day for three to six days. After the first two days of infusion, the 9-day preference test for alcohol drinking was begun and continued identically as in the earlier test. A third alcohol preference test during which no injections were given was conducted at an interval of two weeks following the second. The micro-injection of TH beta C into certain sites in the hippocampus enhanced alcohol consumption from 0.5-2.0 g/kg during the 9-day test interval. The magnitude of this elevated intake was dependent on the site of infusion and was more pronounced when intermediate concentrations of 7-12% alcohol were offered to the rat. At sites in coronal planes encompassing AP 3.0 and AP 3.5, the micro-injection of TH beta C enhanced alcohol drinking significantly in 75% of the animals; however, when delivered at sites in coronal planes AP 1.0 through AP 2.5, TH beta C augmented alcohol drinking significantly in 15% of the rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "77": "A series of benzodiazepines was evaluated for their capacity to induce the differentiation of HL-60 acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. Benzodiazepines were effective initiators of maturation in the concentration range of 50 to 150 microM. The possible involvement of benzodiazepine receptors in mediating the differentiation induced by these agents was investigated. The presence of high affinity, peripheral type benzodiazepine binding sites (KD = 7.3 nM, TB = 14.5 pmol/mg protein with Ro5-4864) was demonstrated in HL-60 membranes. The occupancy of peripheral type high affinity benzodiazepine receptors by various benzodiazepines showed some correlation (r = 0.76) with their differentiation-inducing capabilities, but binding potencies were 1,000-fold higher than the concentrations required to produce differentiation. A class of benzodiazepine receptors with lower binding affinity was also detected in HL-60 membranes (KD = 28.6 microM; TB = 199 pmol/mg protein with diazepam). A higher level of correlation (r = 0.88) was demonstrated between benzodiazepine occupancy of these lower affinity receptors and the capacity to induce maturation. Significantly, benzodiazepine concentrations needed for low affinity binding and induction of differentiation were the same (25-200 microM), suggesting that low affinity benzodiazepine receptors may be involved in the induction process. We have shown that the molecular form responsible for the induction of the differentiation of HL-60 cells to mature forms by 6-thioguanine (TGua) is the free base, TGua, itself [Ishiguro, Schwartz, and Sartorelli (1984) J. Cell. Physiol., 121:383-390]. Since hypoxanthine (Hyp) and inosine (Ino) have been identified as putative endogenous ligands for high affinity benzodiazepine receptors in brain tissue, the potential involvement of benzodiazepine receptors in the differentiation of HL-60 cells by the purines was investigated. Physiological purines such as Hyp and Ino were inactive in displacing the benzodiazepines from their high and low affinity binding sites in HL-60 membranes. In contrast, TGua caused inhibition of benzodiazepine binding to high and low affinity sites. The inhibition of Ro5-4864 binding to high affinity binding sites by TGua appeared to be due to the binding of TGua to membranes through the formation of a mixed disulfide between the 6-thiopurine and protein thiols, since the inhibition was reversed by the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. The findings suggest a possible relationship between the occupancy of benzodiazepine receptors by TGua and the induction of leukemic cell differentiation.", 
    "78": "Etomidate is known to inhibit adrenocorticosteroid synthesis. The extent and duration of the effects of etomidate (63 +/- 6.4 mg) on spontaneous and stimulated corticosteroid levels, as well as on plasma concentrations of ACTH, beta-endorphin, and catecholamines were examined and compared to those following administration of the new benzodiazepine, midazolam, or of methohexital. Twenty-nine healthy, young, male orthopedic patients were randomized into three groups receiving either etomidate/fentanyl (n = 12), midazolam/fentanyl (n = 8), or methohexital/fentanyl (n = 9). Etomidate caused cortisol levels to decrease from 12.5 +/- 1.2 micrograms/dl preoperatively to 5.9 +/- 0.8 micrograms/dl after operation (P less than 0.001), compared to an increase from 12.0 +/- 1.9 micrograms/dl to 18.5 +/- 2.9 micrograms/dl in the group receiving methohexital. At 6 and 20 h postoperatively, all cortisol levels were normal. The cortisol decrease from 12.5 +/- 1.7 to 7.6 +/- 1.5 caused by midazolam was similar to that following etomidate, but the response to exogenous ACTH was significantly impaired in patients receiving etomidate as compared to those receiving midazolam. ACTH and beta-endorphin levels increased in patients receiving etomidate, presumably as a result of the interruption of negative feedback due to cortisol synthesis inhibition. Midazolam on the other hand prevented the increase of ACTH and beta-endorphin levels. Etomidate completely suppressed spontaneous aldosterone levels (from 33 +/- 6.7 to 7 +/- 2.1 pg/ml), as well as the response to stimulation with exogenous ACTH without affecting serum electrolytes. Etomidate had no influence on plasma catecholamines, but midazolam attenuated the stress-related epinephrine increase.", 
    "79": "An improved neurochemical assay for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function has been developed using tracer-radioactive chloride efflux in mouse cortical slices. Careful maintenance of the brain slice viability resulted in a 3-fold stimulation of 36Cl- efflux rate by the GABA agonist muscimol (EC50 = 3 microM), comparable to electrophysiologic and other chloride flux preparations. The shape of the muscimol dose-response curve was shallow, suggestive of negative cooperativity or heterogeneous receptors, but tissue uptake of agonist, possible diffusion barriers and apparent functional desensitization complicated these results. The response to muscimol was inhibited by GABAA receptor antagonists such as RU5135 and was enhanced by barbiturates and benzodiazepines. As observed previously, barbiturates stimulated 36Cl- efflux rate on their own and potentiated the response (potency and maximal effect) to muscimol in a stereospecific and picrotoxin-sensitive manner. Benzodiazepine receptor ligands alone did not alter 36Cl- flux, but agonists such as flunitrazepam enhanced the response to muscimol, an effect sensitive to the antagonist Ro15-1788. The inverse agonist methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate did not inhibit muscimol-activated 36Cl- flux. The anthelminthic-insecticide avermectin B1a stimulated 36Cl- flux by itself, and this response was apparently additive with that of muscimol. This brain slice chloride flux assay is therefore suitable for the assessment of activity including dose-response curves for GABAA agonists, antagonists and modulators including benzodiazepines.", 
    "80": "24 h after administration of a single dose of the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists N'-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG 7142) and 3-carbomethoxy-4-ethyl-6,7-dimethoxy-beta-carboline (DMCM), a profound suppression of the immune response was observed in rodents. This immunosuppression was manifest as a decrease in phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin-A (Con-A) stimulated T cell proliferation in rats and mice administered FG 7142 and a decrease in allogeneic cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity in mice administered either FG 7142 or DMCM. The effects of FG 7142 were antagonized by the prior administration of Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. These findings demonstrate that the neural pathways subserved by benzodiazepine receptors can modulate immune function, and suggest that these receptors may be involved in the stress-induced modulation of immune function.", 
    "81": "The detergent n-octylpentaoxyethylene is one in the series of tenside detergents developed for membrane solubilisation. We have used this detergent to solubilise benzodiazepine receptors from rat cerebellum. The soluble receptor has an affinity (KD) for [3H]flunitrazepam of 1.8 nM +/- 0.2, which is not significantly different from that observed in synaptic membranes. Under optimal conditions (0.6% wt/vol), the number of soluble flunitrazepam binding sites (Bmax) of 0.35 pmol/mg protein suggests an apparent solubilisation of 40% of sites from the membrane. However, the absence of the characteristic facilitation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), cartazolate, and pentobarbital in this soluble receptor preparation suggests that such a preparation is unlikely to be a useful preparation for further studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying GABAA receptor function.", 
    "82": "Anticonvulsant, sedative and anxiolytic effects of the following benzodiazepines, administered chronically by the intraperitoneal route, were assessed: nitrazepam (NTZ), diazepam (DZ), oxazepam (OXZ), chlordiazepoxide (CDX) and temazepam (TMZ). The action of NTZ in tests for sedative, anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects rapidly changed upon a repeated daily treatment, which suggests development of tolerance, while no tolerance developed to such effects of OXZ. The stimulating effect of DZ was found not earlier than after 5 weeks of chronic treatment, but no tolerance to the anxiolytic action was observed, and the anticonvulsant action was even potentiated. The stimulating action and tolerance to the anxiolytic effects of CDX and TMZ developed rapidly, but was accompanied with an only slight decrease in the anticonvulsant effect.", 
    "83": "In a practice of 6000 patients, all long term users of day time benzodiazepine tranquillizers were identified and matched for age and sex with controls. Patients and controls were asked to complete two postal questionnaires, one to measure a number of neurotic personality traits and the other to record details of personal history thought to be relevant. Tranquillizer users were also sent a third questionnaire which surveyed their attitudes to reliance on tranquillizers. Long term users of benzodiazepines had significantly higher scores for anxiety and other neurotic traits but their personal histories showed few significant differences from those of controls. Patients reliant on benzodiazepines seem to be a distinct, more ;neurotic' sub-group of the practice population although their lives have not been any more disturbed. Most patients thought that tranquillizers had helped them but many felt uneasy about being reliant on them. Follow up showed a trend towards spontaneous discontinuing of the tablets."
