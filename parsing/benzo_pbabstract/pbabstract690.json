Both followed mixing the pigs, but before they entered the new piggery. Results from both groups of pigs (treated and control) are sequentially analyzed. Measurements used are growth rate and feed conversion curves during the first 18-20 days of the prefattening period. Diazepam (I mg/kg IM) reduces feed conversion when used to alleviate the effects of the long journey, but increases feed conversion after the short journey when compared to controls injected with a placebo. Worsening effects seem related to increased aggressiveness in animals treated and transported. These results indicate that a better understanding of the action mechanisms of psychotropic drugs is necessary, and they should be used with caution in husbandry.", 
    "1": "In 136 patients, who underwent induced abortion by the vacuum curettage method under local anaesthesia (paracervical block), the effect of 10 mg diazepam intravenously as preoperative sedative was investigated for its ability to abolish the subjective experience of pain. The trial was carried out as a paired sample, random, allocation, double-blind, fixed dose trial, and the statistical method was sequential analysis. Thirty-six pairs showed no difference and were excluded. After 32 pairs (24 A preferences and 8 O preferences), diazepam showed a significant superiority to placebo (p less than 0.05) (Fig. 1.) Amnesia for the procedure was reported by about one-quarter of the diazepam-treated patients, and in practically all cases the sedative effect had subsided 1-3 hours after the operation.", 
    "2": "Diazepam has been reported to reduce pain and discomfort and in many cases to produce a total amnesia. The drug was tested with 136 patients undergoing vacuum curettage for abortion. About 1/2 hour before the pro cedure, patients received premedication with 50 mg pethidine sc. At the beginning of the procedure, half the patients received 10 mg diazepam iv , and the other half a placebo. Paracervical block was then used with 1 % carbocaine. After 3 minutes, the cervix was dilated with a Hegar dila tor, the uterine contents were removed by the suction curette, and .2 mg methyl-ergometrine maleate (Methergin) was given iv. At 1-3 hours posto peratively, patients were asked if the operation had been painful. In 36 instances no preference was shown between results. In 32 instances w here a preference was shown diazepam was considered superior to the plac ebo in reducing pain and discomfort in 24 patients. In 18 of the 68 pat ients treated with diazepam, there was total amnesia for the procedure. However, 2 patients receiving the placebo also had amnesia. At 1-3 hours after the procedure, 4 patients in the diazepam group and 3 in the placebo group were slightly somnolent. With the dose used, the procedure can be done on an outpatient basis.",

No relationships were found between clinical rati ngs of hypnotic effect and drug plasma levels, while significant correlations were observed between some performance taska and drug plasma concentrations of amylobarbitone sodium, and of the higher dose of N-desmethyldiazepam.",

    "6": "Intraoperative blood loss was measured during abdominal prostatectomies in 213 patients anesthetized with neurolept anesthesia, halothane anesthesia and epidural anesthesia. In 55 of these patients, postoperative bleeding was also measured. The average intraoperative blood loss with neurolept anesthesia was 8.2 +/- 5 ml/min, with halothane anesthesia 6.6 +/- 6.3 ml/min and with epidural anesthesia 3.8 +/- 2.3 ml/min. The difference of blood loss in the epidural group and in the groups receiving general anesthesia is highly significant. Average systolic and diastolic blood pressures were lower during operation in the epidural group than in the other two groups. Statistical analyses failed, however, to show a significant correlation between blood pressures and blood loss in the individual patient. Thus, the ultimate explanation for the diminished bleeding associated with epidural anesthesia is not definitely ascertained. The average postoperative bleeding was not significantly different among the three anesthetic groups.", 
    "7": "Paracervical block (PCB) given during labour reduces the uterine activity necessary for cervical dilatation. The aim of the present investigation was to find out whether this effect of PCB changes the form of the amniotic pressure curve. A preliminary investigation showed that the ascending limb of the amniotic pressure curve, A, consists of three phases. The first phase shows an increasing slope and is called the acceleration phase of the ascending limb, Aa; the second phase is rectilinear, Ar. The third phase has a decreasing slope, and is named the deceleration phase, Ad. The descending limb of the amniotic pressure curve, D, was found to have corresponding phases. The initial part has a downward increasing slope and is called the acceleration phase of the descending limb, Da. Then follows a rectilinear phase, Dr and finally a phase with a decreasing slope, the deceleration phase, Dd. The duration of each phase, except Dd, was measured during an observation and a treatment period in 27 patients receiving PCB, and 25 control cases who were given N2O/O2, pethidine, or a combination of both analgesics. The patients were strictly selected and allocated at random to either group. Local analgesia in combination with adrenaline was given at cervical dilatation 3-6 cm; 20 minutes were allowed to elapse from the administration of analgesia until registration of the contraction of the treatment period, to assure an established analgetic effect. PBC shortens Aa and Ad, but prolongs Ar. A + Da + Dr and Ad + Da are shortened while Dr is prolonged after PCB (Table IV). On the presumption that PCB inactivates a part of the lower uterine segment, the changes of Aa, Ar and Ad + Da were predictable. To determine the significance of adrenaline, another series of 21 patients were given PCB, injecting 0.25 per cent bupivacaine without adrenaline added to the solution. The duration of the phases before and after the block was compared. PCB without adrenaline brought about the same changes as it did with adrenaline, but the changes were smaller, only those of Aa, Ar, Dr and Ad + Da being statistically significant. The pressure curves of six patients receiving epidural block were examined using the same method as in the PCB and control groups. The changes typical of PCB did not occur after epidural block. The discovery of the six phases of the amniotic pressure curve, their change after PCB and the results of other investigators make possible a suggestion of the basic physiological processes that influence amniotic pressure during coordinated labour contractions. It is held that the form of the amniotic pressure curve can be explained in terms of contraction, relaxation, and propagation of a contraction and a relaxation wave.", 
    "8": "Fifteen student volunteers participated in a study to determine the duration of amnesia obtained with diazepam and with pentazocine. The group that received pentazocine experienced only slight sedation and no amnesia. There was extreme variance in the level of sedation and in the incidence and duration of amnesia in the group that received diazepam. When amnesia occurred, it lasted for an average of 24 minutes. All students in the group that received a combination of diazepam and pentazocine were well sedated; the average duration of amnesia was 25 minutes.",

    "10": "Since 1968 54 children with infantile convulsion and myoclonic-static fits have been treated with RADEDORM (minimum dosage 2x1/2 tablets, maximum 1--1,5 mg/kg body weight) in the Neuropediatric department of the University Pediatric Clinic in Leipzig. Most of the patients showed a retarded statical and mental development, 50% pathological neurological results. The results of the therapy (35% free of attacks; in 20% a reduction in frequency of attacks of 75--99%; in 6% of 50--74%, in 39% less than 50%, respectively no effect) can be said to be good. Myoclonic-astatic fits were semowhat less favourably influenced than infantile-convulsions. A combination with grand mal epilepsy also had a negative effect on such cases. The results of the treatment were independent of intelligence and duration of illness, however they were not so good in infants as in young children. The electroencephalogram showed with little exception a considerable conformity with the results of the treatment. The side-effects were relatively small and only seldom demanded a reduction in dosage.", 
    "11": "In order to substantiate the subjective feeling of relaxation and mental balance felt after taking Diazepam a new biorhythmometric technique was used, in which the minute-rhythm pulsations were calculated with the aid of autocorrelation analysis from the time series of central nervous functions and cardiorespiratory functions, and their frequency synchronisation recorded as to quantity in the form of a coupling factor. Proof of an improved central nervous co-ordination was that the coupling factor of a relatively uniform test team, all students, after administration of Diazepam (Faustan) was significantly higher than before. If one assumes that the psychosomatic illness, for which the use of Diazepam is considered advisable, are a manifestation of generally disturbed central nervous vegetative reaction condition, then the biorhythmometric survey of the internal co-ordination of relevant physiological functions provides stronger proof than testing with single parameters, between which we also found significant variations (for example, prolongation of the sensorimotor reaction times under Faustan).", 
    "12": "From the research results given we may conclude that the flicker fusion frequency is reduced not only by tranquillisers but also by neuroleptic drugs. The records obtained of the effect of the dosage can be seen as a measure of the efficiency of this method. It should be established by means of similar experiments, by including additional substances, in which regions of the cortico-retinal system the site of action should be presumed to be.", 
    "13": "Permanent freedom from fits can be achieved in a large proportion of children with a history of epilepsy through precise individual adjustment and careful maintenance of the therapeutic regimen. A review of the cases treated at the Pediatric Clinic, out-Patient-Department for Epileptics, University of Vienna, reveals that at present about 70% of the patients have a good prognosis (the figures vary from 50 to 85%, depending on the seizure type). An important question which has received only scant attention in the literature arises in the case of patients who have remained free from epileptic fits over a period of many years, namely whether longterm antiepileptic therapy can be terminated and, if so, then when and how. Only very few studies deal specifically with this problem and even these do not provide entirely satisfactory answers to all the posed questions, not only with regard to the optimum time and mode of drug reduction, but also with regard to the principles underlying the choice of apparently suitable candidates for attempted termination of therapy. An attempt is made in this retrospective study comprising 375 patients who have been followed up over a period of at least 5 years, to throw some light on these problems. Indeed, results of statistical significance were obtained by the use of a new mathematical technique, which enables the formulation of new guiding principles in the resolution of all three above-mentioned questions. In consequence, it now appears within the power of the pediatrician to markedly reduce the risk of relapse, which in the case of childhood epilepsies, is about 20%, at present. In general, several basic principles must be adhered to. Total freedom from convulsions over an uninterrupted period of at least 3 years' duration is an absolute prerequisite for consideration of cessation of therapy. Reduction in antiepileptic drug dosage should be carried out as a stepwise procedure over a period of about 2 years. Regular clinical and EEG follow-up examinations should be performed over this period of drug reduction and for 5 years subsequently, in order to recognise and counteract promptly any early signs of possible relapse. The prerequisite convulsionfree period is raised to 4 to 5 years or even longer and the time over which therapy is tailed off increased accordingly in the presence of any of the following criteria: 1. \"Endogenous\" tendency to relapse, 2. persistence of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities or deterioration of the EEG during the attempt to reduce the dosage of antiepileptic drugs, 3. inveterate epilepsy. The cessation of fits and the termination of medication do not yet signify that all the after-effects of epilepsy are overcome. Social integration must also be achieved before this goal is reached. The psychopathological symptomatology of the patient plays an important role in determining the outcome, whereby the level of intelligence of the patient is the decisive factor...", 
    "14": "Sodium valproate 400 mg.-1800 mg. daily has been used for 1-4 months in the management of 35 patients with intractable epilepsy. This preliminary report indicates that the agent is a useful addition to anti-convulsant therapy with beneficial effect to the majority of patients with gran mal, petit mal, nyoclonus and akinetic attacks. Temporal lobe epilepsy and other focal cortical seizures responded less well. There were some minor gastrointestinal and neurological side-effects which subsided with time or the reduction of dosage. The transition period while other anticonvulsants were being withdrawn was accompanied by grand mal seizures in 6 patients. It appears that sodium valproate requires 7-10 days to becoms fully active and that other anticonvulsants should be withdrawn only after the patient is established on a maintenance dosage. Comparison with clonazepam suggests that the latter is more effective in the control of petit mal and temporal lobe epilepsy but has more persistent sedative effects. Most patients transferred from other anticonvulsants to sodium valproate felt more alert and able to concentrate better.", 
    "15": "In a controlled clinical investigation based on 14 patients with focal seizures and 3 patients with secondary generalized grand mal epilepsy, all with insufficient response to conventional anti-epileptic treatment, clonazepam (Rivotril(R)) combined with previous anti-epileotic drugs was compared with placebo combined with the same drugs. The trial was singleblind cross-over with sequential analyses. With a daily dose, depending upon age, of usually 3-6 mg, the antiepileptic effect of Clonazepam was significantly superior to placebo and was estimated as remarkably good. Side-effects in the form of somnolence, fatique, drowsiness and co-ordination disturbances occurred in most of the patients but subsided spontaneously or could be managed by slow increase or slight reduction in dosage.", 
    "16": "Lever pressing of five squirrel monkeys was maintained by a 3-min fixed-interval schedule of food presentation. 3 monkeys had water concurrently available and, for a second pair of monkeys, initially water, then increasing concentrations of alcohol (1--3% v/v) were present. Substantial amounts of post-pellet drinking occurred with all five monkeys. The amount of water ingested was approximately 100 ml per session, that of 3% alcohol nearly 63 ml. For the monkeys drinking alcohol, increasing concentrations of alcohol decreased both the rate of lever pressing and the volume of fluid consumed. Chlordiazepoxide (1.0--17.0 mg/kg) produced increases in lever pressing and in the schedule-induced consumption of both 3% alcohol and water.", 
    "17": "The author administered per os chlordiazepoxide in a toxic dose of 600 mg/kg of body weight/LD50 of chloridazenoxide for rats was 680 mg/kg of body weight in 20 white male rats, weighing 150 gm. Two hours later, on the background of advanced intoxication, manifested by adynamia ataxia, lateral position, somnolence reaching stupor, the author administered in half of the animals (10) per os centrophenaxine in a dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight. The signs of intoxication disappeared for 24 hours after treatment with centrophenoxine. Three of the control animals died, but in the remaining rats the intoxication worsened, but then slowly disappeared till the end of the fifth day. The obtained experimental data supported the observations of the clinical practice on the favourable effect of centrophenoxine in the treatment of acute poisonings with chlordiazepoxide.", 
    "18": "With the use of quantitative microspectrofluorometry, it has been shown that diazepam (10 mg/kg) and chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg) reduce DA turnover in the tuberculum olfactorium, nuc. accumbens, the DA islands of the entorhinal cortex, and caput of nuc. caudatus, whereas DA turnover is increased in the lateral external layer of the median eminence after 10 mg/kg of diazepam. It is of considerable interest that with a dose of 1 mg/kg of diazepam a reduction of DA turnover can still be observed in the tuberculum olfactorium and nuc. accumbens but not in the nuc. caudatus, due to a high variability of the response in this area. A similar trend is also found with chlordiazepoxide. Thus, changes in limbic DA turnover are observed in doses close to the minimal effective dose (0.6 mg/kg) needed to release punished behavior and to cause anticonvulsive effects, and may therefore be related to these actions of diazepam. For various reasons it is speculated that an increased GABA receptor activity on the DA cell bodies and their dendrites could mainly be involved in causing the reduction of DA turnover observed after benzodiazepines by diminishing the firing rate in the ascending DA pathways, particularly the mesolimbic DA pathways. Evidence for a change of GABA turnover by diazepam has also been found. It is also suggested that the reduction of cortical NE turnover found after benzodiazepines can partly involve an increased GABA receptor activity on the locus ceruleus cells, although the activation of E receptors on these cells cannot be excluded. These effects on locus ceruleus may be partly responsible for the sedation found after benzodiazepines. Diazepam (1 mg/kg) mimics both clonidine and GABA-ergic drugs in reducing blood pressure and slowing respiration rate, but the effects are blocked by picrotoxin but not by piperoxane, an E receptor-blocking agent. In agreement with the view that blockade of the stress-induced increases of NE turnover by benzodiazepines may be related to their antianxiety actions, it was found that the increase in NE turnover elicited by yohimbine, a drug that causes anxiety in man, is blocked by diazepam.", 
    "19": "If the rat conflict test were a valid animal model of anxiety neurosis, evidence which implicates serotonin systems in the anxiety-reducing actions of benzodiazepine tranquilizers could be summarized as follows: (1) The punishment-lessening effects of benzodiazepines in the conflict test are mimicked by serotonin antagonists (methysergide, cinanserin, bromolysergic acid), serotonin synthesis inhibition (PCPA), and serotonin nerve terminal damage (5,6-dihydroxytryptamine). (2) Punishment effects may be intensified by the serotonin precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan (in combination with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor), serotonin agonists (alpha-methyltryptamine), or intraventricular injections of serotonin itself. Intraventricularly administered serotonin also antagonizes the punishment-lessening effects of benzodiazepines. (3) Stimulation of the serotonergic cell bodies in the dorsal raphe nucleus by local application of crystalline carbachol causes intense suppression of behavior. The suppressive effects of raphe stimulation are antagonized by systemic administration of benzodiazepines. (4) In biochemical experiments, the decrease in norepinephrine turnover induced by oxazepam rapidly undergoes tolerance, whereas the decrease induced in serotonin turnover is maintained over repeated doses. These results parallel findings in the conflict test which indicate that the depressant action of oxazepam rapidly undergoes tolerance, whereas the anxiety-reducing action is maintained over repeated doses. Although central serotonin neurons are thus implicated in the therapeutic actions of benzodiazepine tranquilizers, it is quite possible that the drugs actually act indirectly to reduce serotonin activity. The concept that benzodiazepines may exert a primary action on GABA-containing neurons, which in turn regulate serotonergic transmission, was supported by preliminary psychopharmacological evidence. The GABA-antagonist picrotoxin, at doses that do not disrupt unpunished behavior, fully antagonizes the punishment-lessening effects of benzodiazepines in the conflict test.", 
    "20": "On the basis of the data reported here, one may conclude that although many agents that act in the central nervous system are modulators of the action of cyclic AMP, it is difficult to establish a direct connection between the pharmacologic activity and the levels of cyclic AMP in the brain. This lack of interrelation applies to the benzodiazepines as well as to the pyrazolopyridines. The data for members of the latter group are somewhat frustrating in this regard, since an excellent correlation has been shown to exist between the potency of inhibition of PDE and activity in the antianxiety test. In measurements of steroidogenesis in the isolated adrenal cell, the correlation between activity in vito and the conflict assay is even better. The data presented here and reported elsewhere (Shimizu et al., 1974; Kelly et al., 1974; Mayer and King, 1974; King and Mayer, 1974) provide evidence that agents that act as inhibitors of PDE in cell-free systems exert their influence on cyclic AMP in tissue slices of the brain of guinea pigs by mechanisms that seem not to be related to an effect on PDE. Papaverine, and possibly chlordiazepoxide, may act by releasing agonists that, in turn, stimulate the accumulation of cyclic AMP. This activity is blocked bo other inhibitors of PDE, such as theophyline. Results obtained by the use of platelets are refreshingly clear. Inhibition of aggregation has been shown to occur when the level of cyclic AMP is raised, and a suggestive exists that the most potent inhibitors of platelet PDE are the best potentiators of the action of PGE1 in blocking aggregation. The study utilizing drugs collected from a large number of therapeutic classes makes clear that it is difficult to attribute the mechanism of action for any of the classes studied to modulation of cyclic AMP. An unexpected finding of this study, however, was the fact that pharmacologic agents include an unusually large number of inhibitors of PDE as compared with agents chosen at random. This finding provides a powerful tool for the biochemical pharmacologist who is examining large numbers of compounds in the search for potential drugs.", 
    "21": "The effects of several benzodiazepines on a variety of nervous activities known or presumed to depend on GABA are presented and compared with those of agents that deplete or increase the level of endogenous GABA: antagonism of various convulsant agents in mice, enhancement of presynaptic inhibition in the spinal cord and the cuneate nucleus of cats, decrease of the spontaneous firing rate of cerebellar Purkinje cells in cats and rats, antagonism of bicuculine-induced depression of the strio-nigral-evoked potential in the cat, potentiation of haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats, GABA-mimetic actions on drug-induced PGO-waves in cats and on eserine-induced circling in guinea pigs. Diazepam slightly increased the GABA level in the cat spinal cord and in the total brain of mice and rats; this increase does not seem to be due to an increase of GABA synthesis. It is concluded that benzodiazepines probably enhance presynaptic inhibition at all levels of the neuraxis and that this effect requires not only the presence of GABA but is also dependent on an activity of GABA-ergic neurons. Benzodiazepines also appear to enhance postsynaptic inhibition where this is mediated by GABA. Many actions of benzodiazepines can be tentatively explained by a stimulus-bound enhancement of GABA effects.", 
    "22": "Conflict behavior is a powerful tool to reveal relevant pharmacologic correlates of the therapeutically desirable properties of benzodiazepine antianxiety compounds. The predictability of its clinical effectiveness in psychoneuroses is very high, and important quantitative and qualitative differences between compounds in this chemical class can be shown using such a behavioral technique. It is important to take these differences into account when studying biochemical correlates or mechanisms of action within the benzodiazepine class. Conflict behavior has been used to evaluate several biochemical hypotheses concerning the mechanism of action for the antianxiety properties of benzodiazepines. These studies found that inhibition of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase did not seem to be a relevant factor. Similarly, experiments with AOAA did not provide evidence to support the involvement of GABA with benzodiazepines' antianxiety properties, nor did glycine receptor affinities correlate significantly with anticonflict effects. Thus, while it is reasonable at present to associate either GABA or glycine with the muscle-relaxant or anticonvulsant properties of benzodiazepines, no support was provided in the conflict procedure for their involvement in the anxiolytic effects. Partial support was provided for the proposal that serotonin is involved in the benzodiazepines' anxiolytic activity. This was determined in studies with the serotonin antagonists cinanserin and methysergide, which had anti-conflict activity, as well as in studies of monoamine turnover after initial chlordiazepoxide treatments to previously undrugged, conflict-trained rats.", 
    "23": "Sulthiame has been used by most investigators in psychomotor seizures, other focal seizures and grand-mal, usually in conjuction with other anticonvulsants. Reports on its use in myoclonic epilepsy and as a sole anti-convulsant are few and inconclusive. The present report presents the results of a study carried out on the use of sulthiame in 54 cases of myoclonic epilepsies originating in infancy, childhood and adolescence. The different types of myoclonic epilepsy are defined. An illustrative case report is included. Results indicated that sulthiame is the drug of choice, often as the sole anti-convulsive agent, in cases of \"juvenile myoclonic epilepsy\". In the myoclonic encephalopathies of childhood (the so-called \"minor motor epilepsy\" or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome), which are notoriously refractory to therapy, sulthiame appears to be an efficacious adjunct to currently-used agents, including benzodiazepines, succinimides, dipropyl acetate, steriods and a ketogenic diet.", 
    "24": "Sixty male Nigerian students suffering from 'brain fag' syndrome who had failed to respond satisfactorily to 4 to 8 weeks' treatment with other benzodiazepines were treated with 1 to 2 mg. lorazepam t.i.d. There was marked improvement in symptoms in over 80% of the patients by the end of the second week of lorazepam treatment. Side-effects were considerably less frequent or incapacitating than with the previous therapy.", 
    "25": "In recent years the effectiveness of hypnotic drugs has had to be assessed in terms of a greatly increased knowledge of the physiology and pathology of sleep. The normal pattern of sleep and wakefulness involves a cyclic alternation between three rather than two basically dissimilar states of the brain and body - alert wakefulness, rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep and non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep. The pattern of this alternation in individual people results from the interaction of many influences - biological (including genetic, early developmental and later degenerative influences), psychological, social and environmental factors, various physical and psychiatric disorders, and most drugs which affect the central nervous system. The quality of sleep is not related in any simple or constant manner either to its duration or to the proprotions of time spent in each stage of sleep. Among the disorders of sleep, insomnia is a far more common problem of medical management than are enuresis, narcolepsy, somnambulism or nightmares. With a few exceptions, most hypnotic drugs now in widespread use cease to be effective in treating insomnia after the first few nights. However, the ineffective treatment is often continued because insomnia will be even worse during the initial period of drug withdrawal. These factors and the toxicity of hypnotic drugs when taken in overdose make the long-term treatment of insomnia more difficult than was previously supposed. Barbiturates should no longer be prescribed. Some of the non-barbiturates, such as glutethimide and methaqualone, have no advantage over the barbiturates. The benzodiazepine hypnotics, nitrazepam and flurazepam, are less toxic in overdose and are relatively effective in treating insomnia. Chloral hydrate and its derivates are useful alternative drugs for short-term use. Measures to improve sleep without drugs deserve greater emphasis than they have had in the past.", 
    "26": "A double-blind comparison was made of two dose levels (15 and 30 mg.) of the monohydrochloride and dihydrochloride salts of flurazepam ('Dalmane') in 40 hospitalised patients requiring a night-time hypnotic. Each patient in the four drug/dose groups was his own control and took a placebo for 3 nights followed by the active compound for a further 3 nights. On waking each morning a mood state questionnaire was completed. The results indicate that flurazepam is not only an effective hypnotic, but that it has an apparent anxiolytic effect the following morning. Patients report feeling less anxious and more cheerful following drug administration and this result was most noticeable with the 15 mg. monohydrochloride dose.", 
    "27": "Sixty-nine patients undergoing regional anaesthesia were premedicated with either lorazepam (1, 2, 3 or 5 mg), diazepam (5 or 10 mg), pentobarbitone (50 mg) or placebo given i.v., on a double-blind, randomized basis. A simple yet rigorous protocol was used to test the effect of these drugs on anterograde recall. Lorazepam 3 and 5 mg was found to affect anterograde recall significantly. None of the other drugs tested affected recall.", 
    "28": "A double blind clinical evaluation of chlorazepate (dipotassium-7-chloro-5-phenyl-2,2-dihydroxy-3-carboxy-1,2-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepine), diazepam and placebo on a patient group of young students, mean age 25 years, is reported. Both drugs were significantly better than placebo and according to global assessment chlorazepate was superior to diazepam. An analysis of the main target symptom revealed better effects of chlorazepate on the following items: anxiety, feeling of muscular tension and gastro-intestinal disturbances. With respect to irritability and sleep disturbances both drugs were found to be equally effective. In patients' self-ratings chlorazepate was considered superior to diazepam in giving more alertness and less drowsiness during day time. The results are discussed with reference to EEG-studies and pharmaco-kinetic properties of chlorazepate and diazepam. Performance tests in simulated car-driving by healthy volunteers did not demonstrate any significant difference as compared with placebo. The psychophysiological eeffects, however, are more pronounced after diazepam than after chlorazepate medication.", 
    "29": "The new benzodiazepine bromazepam (Ro 5-3350, Lexotan) was compared with diazepam in a double-blind, crossover trial on 30 patients with prolonged anxiety symptoms. Each drug was given for 3 weeks in a dose of 5 mg t.d.s. Bromazepam proved to be statistically significantly superior to diazepam when evaluated through patients' preferences. Fourteen patients preferred bromazepam to diazepam and four the opposite. Three cases were tied. Nine patients had to be withdrawn from the evaluation, which may create bias. A plea is made for further controlled clinical trials on bromazepam, in particular in obsessive and phobic neurosis.", 
    "30": "The effects of clozapine, thioridazine, perlapine and haloperidol on the metabolism of the biogenic amines in the brain of the rat have been investigated. Haloperidol, perlapine and thioridazine induce catalepsy and enhance the turnover of DA in the striatum as indicated by the dose-dependent increase in the DA-metabolites, HVA and DOPAC. These effects are due to blockade of dopaminergic transmission, haloperidol being far more potent than perlapine or thiridazine. Clozapine differs from these agents in that it elevates the concentration of striatal DA. The increase of the concentrations of HVA and DOPAC by clozapine is not accompanied by development of catalepsy. Therefore, clozapine seems to influence striatal DA by a mechanism other than DA-receptor blockade. All four drugs enhance the turnover of NA in the brain stem. This effect is probably secondary to the blockade of NA-receptors. There was no correlation between the effects on NA-metabolism and the EEG-arousal inhibitory activities of these agents or their clinical antipsychotic effects. Clozapine increase the concentration of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the brain. This effect was not seen with the other drugs. Perlapine seems to enhance the turnover of 5-HT, whereas haloperidol reduced the 5-HT concentration. Thioridazine appears to have no effect on the metabolism of 5-HT.", 
    "31": "A relatively simple, routine method has been described for the qualitative identification of flurazepam and its primary metabolite 7-chloro-1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-5-(2-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one in urine. We have described two extractions and several identification procedures by which flurazepam and its primary urinary metabolite can be identified by TLC.", 
    "32": "A series of groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were given either secobarbital, phenobarbital, morphine, pentazocine, diazepam, methotrimeprazine, or saline (control) intraperitoneally on 4 consecutive days and then, on day 5, anesthetized with chloroform, trichlorethylene, fluroxene, halothane, methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, bromotrifluorocyclobutane, or chlorotrifluorocyclobutane. One control group received neither pretreatment nor anesthetics and another was given pretreatment but no anesthetics. The factor of \"enzyme induction\" is also evaluated, as are SGPT elevation and liver and kidney lesions. If enzyme induction occurred with the drugs used for pretreatment, the anesthetics suppressed the expected response. SGPT levels were generally within normal range. The combinations of all pretreatments with enflurane, halothane, or methoxyflurane had the fastest recovery; recovery was slower with the other anesthetic agents, but none of the prior chemotherapeutic drugs accelerated recovery from the inhalation anesthetics.", 
    "33": "The effect of chlorpromazine (CPZ), imipramine (IMP), nitrazepam (NZP) and amobarbital sodium (AMOB) on the REM period of sleep (REMP) was investigated on four subjects by means of all-night sleep polygraphy with the schedule PPPDDDPP where P is placebo and D active drug. CPZ 25 mg resulted in a slight increase in %REMP, and no significant change in REM density (1 second fraction method) and total REM activity during the drug and withdrawal nights. IMP 25 mg produced moderate decrease in %REMP in the three drug nights, whereas REM density decreased only in the first drug night. NZP 5 mg resulted in a slight parallel suppression of %REMP, REM density and total REM activity during the drug nights. AMOB 200 mg produced a slight decrease in %REMP and marked decrease in REM density during the drug nights. Rebound increase of %REMP and a tendency of carry over decrease of REM density were observed in the withdrawal nights. Decrease in the REM density was more marked in AMOB than in NZP drug night. The importance of the simultaneous analysis of %REMP and REM density for the study of effects of psychotrophic drugs on sleep was emphasized.", 
    "34": "The effects of chlorpromazine and diazepam on vestibular neuronal activity were studied in gallamine immobilized cats. Chlorpromazine depressed all the P, N1 and N2-waves of field potentials in the lateral vestibular nucleus evoked by electrical stimulation of the vestibular nerve. Diazepam also reduced the amplitude of postsynaptic components (N1 and N2-waves), while the presynaptic one (P-wave) was slightly increased. Chlorpromazine suppressed the spontaneous as well as the increased vestibular neuronal firing following stimulation of the vestibular nerve. Diazepam enhanced the increased vestibular neuronal firing excited by the nerve stimulation and had no effect on the spontaneous unitary discharges.", 
    "35": "The literature on anaesthesiological studies performed to investigate a possible sparing effect of diazepam on the dosage of muscle-relaxants during anaesthesia is reviewed. Despite some conflicting results it can be concluded that diazepam exerts such an effect, thus allowing between 8 and 30% of the amounts of muscle-relaxants, depending on the type of anesthesia used, to be spared. This conclusion is also supported by the results of pharmacological studies in animals, using the head drop method. The mechanism of this effect is discussed on the basis of the relevant published pharmacological evidence from \"in vitro\" studies and from both animal and human \"in vivo\" studies. From these reports it is concluded that diazepam, at therapeutic doses, does not act on neuromuscular transmission and that this sparing effect does not result from direct pharmacological interaction with neuromuscular blocking agents. Some studies indicate a minimal action of the product on the skeletal muscle fibre, but this also is not related to the sparing effect. It is furthermore concluded that his sparing effect of diazepam on the dosage of muscle-relaxants during anesthesia is due to a summation of muscle-relaxant actions exerted at different levels of the nervous system, those of diazepam being mainly exerted at the spinal and brainstem level and consisting in inhibition of polysynaptic reflex activity, enhancement of presynaptic inhibition, and depression of gamma-motoneuron activity.", 
    "36": "The effects of three oral doses of bedtime triazolam (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, and 1.0 mg) a new benzodiazepine, on the laboratory sleep of insomniacs were studied in a double blind design which used the following 14 consecutive night schedule: 1-4 placebo; 5-11 drug; 12-14 placebo. Effects on sleep were measured objectively by conventional EEG/EOG/EMG sleep recordings and subjectively by questionnaires administered each morning. Side or toxic effects were assessed by screening physicals and questionnaires administered each morning and each evening and by a comparison of the prestudy vs. end-study physical exams and clinical lab tests. At the 0.5 mg dose triazolam significantly reduced several objective and subjective measures of insomnia. It had lesser effects at the 0.25 mg dose and equal or greater effects at 1.0 mg dose. There were no remarkable side or toxic effects at any dose.", 
    "37": "Effects of diazepam (Valium) on photosynthesis, chlorophyll/photosynthesis ratios, respiration, uptake of rubidium ions, and ultrastructure of Scenedesmus obliquus synchronized by a light-dark regimen of 14:10 hrs were determined. 80 and 160 muM diazepam, added to the nutrient medium at the start of the light-dark change (i.e., start of the cell cycle) gradually reduced rates of photosynthesis, below the initial rates from the beginning of the experiment. Contents of chlorophyll, however, remained nearly unaffected. Consequently, the diazepam-treated cells had a higher chlorophyll/photosynthesis ratio--also with regard to respiration in order to calculate the gross photosynthesis. The occurrence of photorespiration cannot be assumed. The net influx of rubidium was slightly reduced by 100 muM diazepam 0.5 and 2.0 hrs after the start of the cell cycle and was strongly inhibited after 5 to 14 hrs. 80 and 160 muM diazepam caused separation of thylakoids, formation of giant mitochondria and enlargement of vacuoles.", 
    "38": "A pilot study using Ro 5-3350 was followed by a double-blind trial comparing Ro 5-3350 and chlordiazepoxide in a total of 25 patients who were either hospital in-patients or previous in-patients attending an out-patients follow-up clinic. The patients all had a long history of obsessive-compulsive or phobic symptoms. The visual analogue scale, the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale and clinical ratings were used to measure the response to treatment. In all three rating methods used, those patients who had received Ro 5-3350, chlordiazepoxide and then Ro 5-3350 in that order, consistently favoured Ro 5-3350. When the clinical ratings were examined by diagnostic groups, it was found that the phobic patients all gave favourable responses to Ro 5-3350. Two of the six patients with severe anxiety or agoraphobic states who had been treated with Ro 5-3350 over periods ranging from three to five years received the medication during the whole term of pregnancy and they were delivered of full-term normal babies. The results suggest that Ro 5-3350 (bromazepam) is a potent anxiolytic most likely to be effective in the relief of visceral manifestations of anxiety. The incidence of side-effects was low and there were no toxic effects reported.", 
    "39": "Two double-blind four-way crossover studies are reported, comparing the antidepressant effect of 14-day courses of: viloxazine, viloxazine with a tranquillizer either perphenazine or diazepam or tranquillizer alone, against a placebo. In one study the antidepressant effect of viloxazine at a dose of 150 mg daily was statistically greater than that of placebo, whilst in the second study viloxazine was statistically superior to diazepam (15 mg daily). In depressed patients with a clear anxiety component, viloxazine alone seemed preferable to a combination with a tranquillizer as such a combination did not produce an enhanced clinical effect and the incidence of side-effects was possibly increased. Viloxazine was generally well tolerated and side-effects, when they occurred, were generally a mild upper gastro-intestinal disturbance.", 
    "40": "Noradrenaline level in rat heart decreased after intoxication by parathion. The pharmacological investigations appeared to prove that this decrease results from the storage of acetylcholine, which provoked likewise a slowing of the cardiac rythm. The role of atropine is discussed.", 
    "41": "Studies were conducted in 189 oral surgery out-patients to evaluate the combination of meperidine hydrochloride and diazepam for anesthesia and to determine its effect on the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. Results showed that neither ventricular cardiac arrhythmias nor clinically significant respiratory depression occurred in the sedated patients; meperidine-diazepam proved to be satisfactory for oral surgical procedures.", 
    "42": "A double blind between-groups trial was carried out to compare the effectiveness of the new benzodiazepine compound, bromazepam, (Lexotan, Ro 5-3350) as an anti-anxiety compound with that of diazepan. The fifty-eight psychoneurotic inpatients admitted to the trial were divided into two groups, \"obsessives\" and \"neurotics\", in order to assess any specific action of the drug. Assessment was made by means of B.P.R.S. of Overall and Gorham, R.S.A.S. of Hamilton, P.R.S. of Wittenborn and I.M.P.S. of Lorr. The results showed that bromazepam has a general therapeutic effectiveness (though not always as great as that of diazepam) as an anti-anxiety agent, while no difference in the effects of the two drugs was found between the two psychopathologic groups; with both treatments the \"obsessives\" responded less than the \"neurotics\". Detailed evaluation of the individual items of the I.M.P.S. showed that bromazepam is likely to exert a disinhibiting or \"activating\" action, unlike most other benzodiazepines in clinical use.", 
    "43": "The hypnotic effect of a new triazolobenzodiazepine, triazolam (0.5 mg) and methyprylon was compared in 30 outpatient volunteers with insomnia using the preference technique. On the first night of the 2 night trial, triazolam or methyprylon was given on a double-blind basis and on the 2nd night the outpatients received the alternate medication. Following each trial night the patients were interviewed in regard to their sleep. Of the 28 patients who completed the study, 21 patients preferred triazolam, 5 preferred methyprylon and 2 had no preference (p = 0.001). Analysis of the various sleep parameters showed that triazolam helped the patients sleep more than methyprylon (p = 0.026), there were fewer awakenings on triazolam (p = 0.064), a longer duration of sleep (p = 0.064) and a better feeling in the a.m. (p = 0.020). The sleep onset was the same after both medications. The number and severity of the side effects was considerably higher after methyprylon.", 
    "44": "Benzodiazepines (diazepam, oxazepam, chlordiazepoxide) inhibited competitively the binding of tryptophan onto rat serum albumin. As a result, in vivo treatment with one of these compounds (chlordiazepoxide for instance) induced a significant increase in the concentration of free tryptophan in serum. These observations suggest that the high levels of both 5-hydroxyindoles and tryptophan which occurred in the rat brain after any benzodiazepine administration could be at least partly the consequence of its effect on tryptophan binding in blood.", 
    "45": "In a group of 55 allergic patients with hay fever, and including patients treated by complete placebo, the action of Lorazepam has been studied from both the psycho-somatic and the allergic point of view. This most obviously allergic of all allergic diseases has been especially chosen because it was thought that the psycho-somatic hypothesis would appear at the outset in this condition to be the less apparent. Despite this fact, the anxiolitic effect of Lorazepam and its anti-allergic consequences were conclusive. A parallel study using only placebo treatment, orally and by vaccine, was performed in a few cases. 39 patients out of 45 treated by Temesta and placebo vaccine, had few or very few allergic symptoms. The 10 patients treated by complete placebo (orally and by vaccine) presented this year an acute pollinosis. We find the same parallelism between the allergy and the psycho-somatic aspect.", 
    "46": "This study investigates the effect of flunitrazepam, a new benzodiazepine, on the sleep of insomniac patients under chronic treatment. Polygraphic recordings have shown that this drug decreases not only the activity of the wakefulness system, but also the activity of the synchronizing system of slow-wave sleep. The subjective feeling of improved and sounder sleep seems to be related to a decrease of wakefulness pressure as well as to a decrease of body motoricity, but not with the modification of sleep stages themselves. Flunitrazepam appears to possess some regulatory properties on REM sleep, since this stage is enhanced in patients with an initial low amount of REM sleep and decreased in those having a higher initial REM sleep. Flunitrazepam possesses potent and useful hypnogenic properties in man but does not induce physiological sleep.", 
    "47": "An experimental analysis of the psychotropic activity of Leponex (in a chronic experiment on II cats) in conditions of a group interaction depicted that the preparation processes a definite tranquillizing and antipsychotic effect. In conditions of zoosocial interactions this drug promotes disappearance of neurotic reactions and a resocialization of animals in the zoosocial ierarchy. In tranquillizing doses the preparation has an antihypertensive effect and prevents the development of a long-term tonic hypertension due to emotional stress.", 
    "48": "78 patients suffering from various functional abdominal complaints have been trated in a 2 x 2 double-blind design: (a) psychotherapy with Ro 5-3350 (TH/Ro); (b) psychotherapy with placebo (TH/P); (c) Ro 5-3350 without psychotherapy (NIH/Ro); (d) placebo without psychotherapy (NTH/P). Results show that a considerable amount of improvement cannot be ascribed to the two critical factors or the interaction of both, but are due to unspecific influences in the course of treatment. Some of the results concerning the combination of TH and the psychotropic drug pose interesting questions for further research and bare implications for double-blind trials of psychotropic drugs. The results suggest that possibly properties of any psychotropic drug have to be related to a doctor-patient relationship within which the personal problems of the patient are dealt with. In order to evaluate such properties, special methodological precautions have to be taken. These will be briefly discussed."
