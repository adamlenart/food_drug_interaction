Several drugs (topiramate, clobazam, pregnanolone, allopregnanolone, UBP 302, cyclopentyladenosine [CPA], ketamine, midazolam and scopolamine) have been identified as potential neuroprotectants that may terminate seizures and reduce brain damage. To systematically evaluate their efficacy, this study employed in vivo striatal microdialysis and liquid chromatography to respectively collect and analyze extracellular ACh in freely moving rats treated with these drugs 20\u2009min after seizure onset induced by a high dose of GD. Along with microdialysis, EEG activity was recorded and neuropathology assessed at 24\u2009h. GD induced a marked increase of ACh, which peaked at 30\u2009min post-exposure to 800% of control levels and then steadily decreased toward baseline levels. Approximately 40\u2009min after treatment, only midazolam (10\u2009mg/kg) and CPA (60\u2009mg/kg) caused a significant reduction of ACh levels, with CPA reducing ACh levels more rapidly than midazolam. Both drugs facilitated a return to baseline levels at least 55\u2009min after treatment. At 24\u2009h, only animals treated with CPA (67%), midazolam (18%) and scopolamine (27%) exhibited seizure termination. While all treatments except for topiramate reduced neuropathology, CPA, midazolam and scopolamine showed the greatest reduction in pathology. Our results suggest that delayed treatment with CPA, midazolam, or scopolamine is effective at reducing GD-induced seizure activity and neuropathology, with CPA and midazolam capable of facilitating a reduction in GD-induced ACh elevation.",

These blood concentration limits are often derived from experimental studies on traffic relevant behavior of healthy volunteers. Knowledge about how results from experimental studies could be transferred to a real-life setting is missing. The aim of this study was to compare impairment seen in experimental studies to the impairment seen at equivalent concentrations in apprehended drunk and drugged drivers.", 
    "2": "Results from previously performed meta-analyses of experimental studies regarding impairment from alcohol, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and benzodiazepines were compared to impairment in apprehended drunk and drugged drivers as judged by a clinical test of impairment.

The percentage of impaired test results in experimental studies was compared to the percentage of impaired subjects among drivers within the same blood drug concentration window.",

For THC, the percentage of impaired drivers (n = 950) increased from 42 to 58%, the corresponding numbers being 11 and 42% for experimental studies. For benzodiazepines, the percentage of impaired drivers (n = 245) increased from 46 to 76%, the corresponding numbers being 16 and 60% for experimental studies. The increased odds ratio for impairment between 2 concentration groups was comparable for experimental studies and impaired drivers.", 
    "4": "Fewer test results indicated impairment in experimental studies compared to impaired drivers in real life when influenced by similar blood concentrations of either ethanol, THC, or benzodiazepines. In addition, a comparable relationship between drug concentration and impairment was seen for both experimental studies and real-life cases. We believe that the present study strengthens the background for using experimental studies to establish fixed concentration limits for drunk and drugged drivers, but experimental studies in an impaired driver population could further expand our knowledge.", 
    "5": "Epidemiological studies suggest an increased fracture risk in patients taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for long term. The underlying mechanism, however, has been disputed. By binding to the gastric proton pump, PPIs inhibit gastric acid secretion. We have previously shown that proton pump (H(+)/K(+)ATPase beta subunit) KO mice exhibit reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and inferior bone strength compared with WT mice. Patients using PPIs as well as these KO mice exhibit gastric hypoacidity, and subsequently increased serum concentrations of the hormone gastrin. In this study, we wanted to examine whether inhibition of the gastrin/CCK2 receptor influences bone quality in these mice. KO and WT mice were given either the gastrin/CCK2 receptor antagonist netazepide dissolved in polyethylene glycol (PEG) or only PEG for 1year. We found significantly lower bone mineral content and BMD, as well as inferior bone microarchitecture in KO mice compared with WT. Biomechanical properties by three-point bending test also proved inferior in KO mice. KO mice receiving netazepide exhibited significantly higher cortical thickness, cortical area fraction, trabecular thickness and trabecular BMD by micro-CT compared with the control group. Three-point bending test also showed higher Young's modulus of elasticity in the netazepide KO group compared with control mice. In conclusion, we observed that the gastrin receptor antagonist netazepide slightly improved bone quality in this mouse model, suggesting that hypergastrinemia may contribute to deteriorated bone quality during acid inhibition.", 
    "6": "An innovative analytical method has been developed to quantify the bioaccumulation in an amphipod crustacean (Gammarus fossarum) of three micropollutants regarded as anthropic-pollution markers: carbamazepine, oxazepam, and testosterone. A liquid-liquid extraction assisted by salts, known as QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) was miniaturised and optimised, so it could be adapted to the low mass samples (approximatively 5mg dry weight). For this same reason and in order to obtain good sensitivity, ultra-trace analyses were carried out by means of nanoliquid chromatography. A preconcentration system by on-column trapping was optimised to increase the injection volume. In order to improve both sensitivity and selectivity, the multiple reaction monitoring cubed mode analyses (MRM(3)) were carried out, validated and compared to the classic MRM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that MRM(3) is coupled to nanoliquid chromatography for the analysis and detection of organic micropollutants <300Da. The optimised extraction method exhibited recoveries superior to 80%. The limits of quantification of the target compounds were 0.3, 0.7 and 4.7ng/g (wet weight) for oxazepam, carbamazepine and testosterone, respectively and the limits of detection were 0.1, 0.3 and 2.2ng/g (wet weight), respectively. The intra- and inter-day precisions were inferior to 7.7% and 10.9%, respectively, for the three levels of concentration tested. The analytical strategy developed allowed to obtain limits of quantification lower than 1ng/g (wet weight) and to establish the kinetic bioconcentration of contaminants within G. fossarum.",

Stability was assessed by means of measuring percent recovery at varying time points throughout a 90-day period. The quantification of the active pharmaceutical ingredients was performed by a stability-indicating, high-performance liquid chromatographic method. The beyond-use date of the products was found to be at least 90 days for all suspensions (except atenolol 1 mg/mL, which was stable up to 60 days), both for controlled refrigerated temperature and room temperature. This confirms that SyrSpend SF PH4 is a stable suspending vehicle for compounding with a broad range of different active pharmaceutical ingredients.",

    "13": "Cytochrome P450 (P450) 3A (CYP3A) is an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of therapeutic drugs such as midazolam, nifedipine, testosterone and triazolam. It is involved in 40% of all cases of P450-mediated metabolism of marketed drugs. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the CYP3A-mediated drug interaction potential of new chemical entities (NCEs). In the past, one P450 isoform-specific probe substrate has been used at a time to evaluate the degree of inhibition of P450 isoforms by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). However, CYP3A enzymes have been shown to have a multi-substrate binding site. Therefore, multiple CYP3A substrates should be used to evaluate precisely the drug interaction potential of NCEs with the enzyme CYP3A. In this study, a method of screening NCEs for their potential to inhibit by CYP3A enzyme activity was developed. It involves the employment of a CYP3A substrate cocktail (including midazolam, testosterone and nifedipine). The concentration of each CYP3A probe substrate in vitro was optimized (0.1\u00a0\u03bcm for midazolam, 2\u00a0\u03bcm for testosterone and 2\u00a0\u03bcm for nifedipine) to minimize mutual drug interactions among probe substrates. The method was validated by comparing inhibition data obtained from the incubation of CYP3A with each individual substrate with data from incubation with a cocktail of all three substrates. The CYP3A inhibition profiles from the substrate cocktail approach were similar to those from the individual substrates approach. This new method could be an effective tool for the robust and accurate screening of the CYP3A inhibition potential of NCEs in drug discovery. Copyright \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", 
    "14": "BACKGROUND Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) cause significant morbidity in critically ill patients. An underappreciated but potentially modifiable risk factor for infection is sedation strategy. Recent trials suggest that choice of sedative agent, depth of sedation, and sedative management can influence HAI risk in mechanically ventilated patients. OBJECTIVE To better characterize the relationships between sedation strategies and infection. METHODS Systematic literature review. RESULTS We found 500 articles and accepted 70 for review. The 3 most common sedatives for mechanically ventilated patients (benzodiazepines, propofol, and dexmedetomidine) have different pharmacologic and immunomodulatory effects that may impact infection risk. Clinical data are limited but retrospective observational series have found associations between sedative use and pneumonia whereas prospective studies of sedative interruptions have reported possible decreases in bloodstream infections, pneumonia, and ventilator-associated events. CONCLUSION Infection rates appear to be highest with benzodiazepines, intermediate with propofol, and lowest with dexmedetomidine. More data are needed but studies thus far suggest that a better understanding of sedation practices and infection risk may help hospital epidemiologists and critical care practitioners find new ways to mitigate infection risk in critically ill patients.

    "15": "The 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is a potential mitochondrial target for drug delivery to tumors overexpressing TSPO, including brain cancers, and selective TSPO ligands have been successfully used to selectively deliver drugs into the target. Methotrexate (MTX) is an anticancer drug of choice for the treatment of several cancers, but its permeability through the blood brain barrier (BBB) is poor, making it unsuitable for the treatment of brain tumors. Therefore, in this study, MTX was selected to achieve two TSPO ligand-MTX conjugates (TSPO ligand \u03b1-MTX and TSPO ligand \u03b3-MTX), potentially useful for the treatment of TSPO-rich cancers, including brain tumors. In this work, we have presented the synthesis, the physicochemical characterizations, as well as the in vitro stabilities of the new TSPO ligand-MTX conjugates. The binding affinity for TSPO and the selectivity versus central-type benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) was also investigated. The cytotoxicity of prepared conjugates was evaluated on MTX-sensitive human and rat glioma cell lines overexpressing TSPO. The estimated coefficients of lipophilicity and the stability studies of the conjugates confirm that the synthesized molecules are stable enough in buffer solution at pH 7.4, as well in physiological medium, and show an increased lipophilicity compared to the MTX, compatible with a likely ability to cross the blood brain barrier. The latter feature of two TSPO ligand-MTX conjugates was also confirmed by in vitro permeability studies conducted on Madin-Darby canine kidney cells transfected with the human MDR1 gene (MDCK-MDR1) monolayers. TSPO ligand-MTX conjugates have shown to possess a high binding affinity for TSPO, with IC50 values ranging from 7.2 to 40.3 nM, and exhibited marked toxicity against glioma cells overexpressing TSPO, in comparison with the parent drug MTX.",

We calculated the antidepressant dose using the imipramine equivalent scale and the dose of concomitant anxiolytics and hypnotics using the diazepam equivalent scale. The 82 participants were classified into two groups based on the median imipramine equivalent dose, and we examined the influence of patient characteristics and the presence of genetic polymorphisms of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF; rs6265) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate responsive element-binding protein 1 (CREB1; rs2253306, rs4675690, rs769963) on the antidepressant maintenance dose. Using a multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found that the concomitant diazepam equivalent dose and presence of the CREB1 rs4675690 polymorphism were significantly associated with the antidepressant maintenance dose. We concluded that these factors influenced the antidepressant dose in maintenance therapy among Japanese patients with depression. However, further research is required in large cohorts.",

    "30": "\u03b3-aminobutyric type A (GABAA ) receptors are the main inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain and are targets for numerous clinically important drugs such as benzodiazepines, anxiolytics, and anesthetics. Previously, pyrazoloquinoline 2-p-methoxyphenylpyrazolo [4,3-c] quinolin-3(5H)-one (CGS 9895) was described as a positive allosteric modulator acting through the \u03b1+/\u03b2- interface in the extracellular domain of GABAA receptors. The localization of the binding site was based on a steric hindrance approach, rather than on direct effects of point mutations. In this study we further characterized modulation by this compound which seems to have multiple sites of action. We investigated GABAA receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes using voltage-clamp electrophysiology. We have identified the \u03b11 Y209 residue at the \u03b1+/\u03b2- interface as a key residue for CGS 9895 modulation. In addition, the interaction between this residue and various structural analogs was characterized, allowing tentative positioning of CGS 9895 versus \u03b11 Y209 (rat sequence). Not all compounds were found to be sensitive to mutations at the \u03b11 Y209 residue. In addition, the interaction of CGS 9895 with flurazepam was characterized. Flurazepam is hypothesized to act at the same subunit interface in the extracellular domain. We also provide evidence that the GABAA receptor harbors additional modulatory sites for CGS 9895 at each of the subunit interfaces in the transmembrane domain. GABAA receptors are the main inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain and are targets for numerous clinically important drugs such as benzodiazepines, anxiolytics and anesthetics. We have identified the \u03b11 Y209 residue present at the extracellular \u03b1+/\u03b2- subunit interface as a key residue for the positive allosteric modulation of the GABAA receptor by CGS 9895. This receptor harbors additional modulatory sites for this compound at subunit interfaces in the transmembrane domain.",

Twelve female subjects received midazolam during three study phases: 1\u00a0mg midazolam (control phase), 1\u00a0mg midazolam after pretreatment with 400\u00a0mg ketoconazole once daily for 4\u00a0days (CYP3A inhibition phase), and 2.5\u00a0mg midazolam after pretreatment with 600\u00a0mg rifampicin once daily for 10\u00a0days (CYP3A induction phase). Throughout the study, blood samples were collected 24\u00a0h after midazolam administration and urine samples at 12-h intervals during the 24\u00a0h before and after midazolam administration for the analysis of endogenous steroid metabolites. A statistical model was generated to predict midazolam clearance using measurements of endogenous metabolites associated with the inhibition and induction of CYP3A. Mean midazolam clearance decreased to \u223c20% of control levels during the inhibition phase and increased more than 2-fold during the induction phase. Of the urine and plasma metabolites measured, the 6\u03b2-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio was most significantly correlated with midazolam clearance during hepatic CYP3A inhibition and induction. Our results suggest that the urinary 6\u03b2-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio is the best predictor of hepatic CYP3A activity under both maximal inhibition and maximal induction. Furthermore, the predictive model including 6\u03b2-hydroxycortisol/cortisol as a covariate could be applied to predict the magnitude of CYP3A-mediated drug interactions.",

The present study was conducted to investigate the beneficial effects of low doses of X-rays, if any, during diazepam induced depression in rats. Female Sprague Dawley rats were segregated into four different groups viz: Normal control, Diazepam treated, X-irradiated and Diazepam\u00a0+\u00a0X-irradiated. Depression model was created in rats by subjecting them to diazepam treatment at a dosage of 2\u00a0mg/kg b.wt./day for 3 weeks. The skulls of animals belonging to X-irradiated and Diazepam\u00a0+\u00a0X-irradiated rats were X-irradiated with a single fraction of 0.5\u00a0Gy, given twice a day for 3 days, thereby delivered dose of 3\u00a0Gy. Diazepam treated animals showed significant alterations in the neurobehavior and neuro-histoarchitecture, which were improved after X-irradiation. Further, diazepam exposure significantly decreased the levels of neurotransmitters and acetylcholinesterase activity, but increased the monoamine oxidase activity in brain. Interestingly, X-rays exposure to diazepam treated rats increased the levels of neurotransmitters, acetylcholinesterase activity and decreased the monoamine oxidase activity. Further, depressed rats also showed increased oxidative stress with altered antioxidant parameters, which were normalized on X-rays exposure. The present study, suggests that low dose of ionizing radiations, shall prove to be an effective intervention and a novel therapy in controlling depression and possibly other brain related disorders.",

    "38": "Slow-release oral morphine sulfate (SM) is one of the most abused prescription opioids in France. However, the regional feature of the abuse of morphine is poorly documented. To investigate the abuse of SM in a French administrative region, a multisource approach was applied. The first approach was based on SM exposition at national and regional level using the OPPIDUM survey. In a second approach, we analyzed a drug reimbursement database to assess the magnitude of SM abuse in Languedoc-Roussillon (LR) region. A clustering method was applied to classify patients and to describe the profile of deviant patients. The third approach was based on a self-administered anonymous questionnaire, proposed to patients seen in addiction care centers in the LR region and consuming oral SM. The OPPIDUM study showed that in most regions, where the prevalence of heroin use is higher than the national average of 9.1%, SM consumers were fewer. With the clustering method, three subgroups were identified. One of them gathered 35 users (3.2%) with a deviant behavior characterized by significantly more dispensations, dispensing pharmacies, and prescribers. These subjects were mainly men, younger, and more consumers of benzodiazepines and opioid maintenance therapy than the others. The third study allowed specifying that SM was mainly injected (93.7%), bought in the street (80%), and used because of unavailability and the poor quality of heroin (33.9%). The three proposed approaches are complementary and help to clarify the abuse of oral SM, while assessing the motivations of this abuse.",

    "45": "All patients with drug-induced SRED took multiple types of sedatives, such as benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine receptor agonists. Clinical features of drug-induced SRED compared with primary SRED were as follows: higher mean age of onset (40 years old in drug-induced SRED vs 26 years old in primary SRED), significantly higher rate of patients who had total amnesia during most of their SRED episodes (75.0% vs 31.8%), significantly lower rate of comorbidity of night eating syndrome (0% vs 63.3%), and significantly lower rate of history of sleepwalking (10.0% vs 46.7%). Increased doses of benzodiazepine receptor agonists may be responsible for drug-induced SRED.",

    "47": "Evidence supports the use of opioids for treating acute pain. However, the evidence is limited for the use of chronic opioid therapy for chronic pain. Furthermore, the risks of chronic therapy are significant and may outweigh any potential benefits. When considering chronic opioid therapy, physicians should weigh the risks against any possible benefits throughout the therapy, including assessing for the risks of opioid misuse, opioid use disorder, and overdose. When initiating opioid therapy, physicians should consider buprenorphine for patients at risk of opioid misuse, opioid use disorder, and overdose. If and when opioid misuse is detected, opioids do not necessarily need to be discontinued, but misuse should be noted on the problem list and interventions should be performed to change the patient's behavior. If aberrant behavior continues, opioid use disorder should be diagnosed and treated accordingly. When patients are discontinuing opioid therapy, the dosage should be decreased slowly, especially in those who have intolerable withdrawal. It is not unreasonable for discontinuation of chronic opioid therapy to take many months. Benzodiazepines should not be coprescribed during chronic opioid therapy or when tapering, because some patients may develop cross-dependence. For patients at risk of overdose, naloxone should be offered to the patient and to others who may be in a position to witness and reverse opioid overdose.",

The 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor finasteride attenuated progesterone self-administration, consistent with the reinforcing effects of progesterone being mediated by the in vivo synthesis of neuroactive steroids. The comparison drugs, triazolam and clonazepam, were self-administered significantly above vehicle by all monkeys. Although the maximum number of injections/session maintained by the neuroactive steroids was below that maintained by the midazolam training dose, analysis of break points (i.e., highest response requirement achieved) suggested modest differences in relative reinforcing effectiveness for neuroactive steroids compared with benzodiazepines.",

    "60": "Quercitrin is a well-known flavonoid that is contained in Flos Albiziae, which has been used for the treatment of anxiety. The present study investigated the anxiolytic-like effects of quercitrin in experimental models of anxiety. Compared with the control group, repeated treatment with quercitrin (5.0 and 10.0\u2009mg/kg/day, p.o.) for seven days significantly increased the percentage of entries into and time spent on the open arms of the elevated plus maze. In the light/dark box test, quercitrin exerted an anxiolytic-like effect at 5 and 10\u2009mg/kg. In the marble-burying test, quercitrin (5.0 and 10.0\u2009mg/kg) also exerted an anxiolytic-like effect. Furthermore, quercitrin did not affect spontaneous locomotor activity. The anxiolytic-like effects of quercitrin in the elevated plus maze and light/dark box test were blocked by the serotonin-1A (5-hydroxytryptamine-1A (5-HT1A)) receptor antagonist WAY-100635 (3.0\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) but not by the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptor antagonist flumazenil (0.5\u2009mg/kg, i.p.). The levels of brain monoamines (5-HT and dopamine) and their metabolites (5-hydroxy-3-indoleacetic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and homovanillic acid) were decreased after quercitrin treatment. These data suggest that the anxiolytic-like effects of quercitrin might be mediated by 5-HT1A receptors but not by benzodiazepine site of GABAA receptors. The results of the neurochemical studies suggest that these effects are mediated by modulation of the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters.",

    "70": "Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is a hormone secreted by the hypothalamus in response to stress, and CRF antagonists may be effective for the treatment of stress-related disorders including major depressive and anxiety disorders. Here, we investigated the in vivo pharmacological profile of N-cyclopropylmethyl-7-(2,6-dimethoxy-4-methoxymethylphenyl)-2-ethyl-N-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-ylmethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-3-amine tosylate (E2508), a recently synthesized, orally active CRF1 receptor antagonist. Oral administration of a single dose of E2508 (3 or 10mg/kg), but not fluoxetine (30mg/kg), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), significantly shortened immobility time in rats in the forced swim test. E2508 (10, 30, or 100mg/kg) also showed an antidepressant-like effect in the forced swim test in mice, with no sedative or muscle relaxant effects for doses up to 100mg/kg. Moreover, E2508 (5 or 20mg/kg) significantly reduced anxiety-like behavior in the rat defensive burying test. Diazepam, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic agent, also showed an anxiolytic effect in the defensive burying test at the same dose that induced a muscle relaxant effect in mice. Administration of E2508 (30mg/kg) for 14 consecutive days did not affect sexual behavior. By contrast, fluoxetine (30mg/kg) administration for \u22657 consecutive days decreased sexual behavior. These results indicate that E2508 has both potent antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects in rodent models, and is well tolerated compared with a commonly prescribed therapeutic SSRI or benzodiazepine.",

    "96": "Classical midazolam-opioid combination for gastrointestinal endoscopy sedation has been adopted for decades. Dosing regimens have been studied but most require fixed dosing intervals. We intend to use a sophisticated pharmacodynamic tool, response surface model (RSM), to simulate sedation using different regimens. RSM can predict patient's response during different phases of the examination and predict patient's wake-up time with precision and without the need for fixed dosing intervals. We believe it will aid physicians in guiding their dosing strategy and timing.The study is divided into 2 parts. The first part is the full Greco RSMs development for 3 distinct phases: esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), colonoscopy, and intersession (the time lapse between procedures). Observer's Assessment of Alertness Score (OAA/S) is used to assess patient response. The second part simulates 6 regimens with different characteristics using the RSMs: midazolam only, balanced midazolam and opioids, high-dose opioids and midazolam, low-dose midazolam with high-dose opioids, high-dose midazolam and low-dose opioids, and finally midazolam with continuous opioid infusion. Loss of response at 95% probability for adequate anesthesia during examination and return of consciousness at 50% probability during intersession was selected for simulation purposes.The average age of the patient population is 49.3 years. Mean BMI is 21.9\u200a\u00b1\u200a2.3\u200akg/m. About 56.7% were females and none received prior abdominal surgery. The cecal intubation rate was 100%. Only 1 patient (3%) developed temporary hypoxemia, which was promptly managed with simple measures. The RSMs for each phase showed significant synergy between midazolam and alfentanil. The balanced midazolam and alfentanil combination provided adequate anesthesia and most rapid return of consciousness. The awakening time from the final drug bolus was 7.4\u200aminutes during EGD and colonoscopy stimulation, and 9.1\u200aminutes during EGD simulation.Simulation of regimens with different characteristics gives insights on dosing strategies. A balanced midazolam-alfentanil regimen is adequate in providing good anesthetic depth and most rapid return of consciousness.

Almost all of them are interested in having a document summarizing the main strategy to be set up or a possibility to call a specialized mobile team with doctors and professionals caregivers. A few dedicated consultations were devoted to informal caregivers whereas GP were aware of negative effects of these decompensations on them. This study point out difficulties for GP to provide appropriate management for their patients with ADRD living at home and for their informal caregivers, particularly during acute behavioral disturbance, despite their practical knowledges.",

Moreover, co-administration of sub-therapeutic doses of imipramine or fluoxetine with HeMI (3.125\u2006mg/kg) elicited significant reduction in time spent immobile in the FST. However, pretreatment of mice with parachlorophenylalanine, metergoline, yohimbine or sulpiride abolished the antidepressant-like effect elicited by HeMI. In the EPM, HeMI produced significant [F(5,42)=8.91, p<0.001] increase in open arms exploration by 75.55\u2006% and this effect was blocked by pretreatment of mice with flumazenil or metergoline.",

Several antiemetic options exist to manage CINV. Corticosteroids, serotonin receptor antagonists, and neurokinin receptor antagonists are the classes most commonly used in the prevention of CINV. There are many alternative drug classes utilized for the prevention and management of CINV such as antihistamines, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, cannabinoids, and dopamine receptor antagonists. Medications belonging to these classes generally have lower efficacy and are associated with more adverse effects. They are also not as well studied compared to the aforementioned agents. This review will focus on dronabinol, a member of the cannabinoid class, and its role in CINV. Cannabis sativa L. (also known as marijuana) contains naturally occurring delta-9-tetrahydrocannibinol (delta-9-THC). The synthetic version of delta-9-THC is the active ingredient in dronabinol that makes dronabinol an orally active cannabinoid. Evidence for clinical efficacy of dronabinol will be analyzed in this review as monotherapy, in combination with ondansetron, and in combination with prochlorperazine.",

Combined administration of ketamine (40 mg/kg) and midazolam (9 mg/kg) induced surgical coma and almost completely suppressed early oscillatory patterns and neuronal firing. These effects persisted over 3 h after injection of the anesthetics. We concluded that general anesthesia induced by combined administration of ketamine and midazolam profoundly suppressed cortical activity in newborn rats, which can trigger neuroapoptosis in the developing brain.",

Most reports have indicated that major challenges with general anesthetic administration in CMTD patients are the appropriate use of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants and preparation for malignant hyperthermia in neuromuscular disease. Moderate sedation may be associated with the same complications as those of general anesthesia, as well as dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, reduced perioperative respiratory function, difficulty in positioning, and sensitivity to intravenous anesthetic agents. We decided to use intravenous sedation in a CMTD patient and administered midazolam initially and propofol continuously, with total doses of 1.5 mg and 300 mg, respectively. Anesthesia was completed in 3 hours and 30 minutes without adverse events. We suggest that dental anesthetic treatment with propofol and midazolam may be effective for patients with CMTD.",

In our facility, the infusion rate of propofol is adjusted according to the bispectral index (BIS) in all cases of implant-related surgery; multivariate analysis of retrospective data enabled us to extract independent factors that affect the dose of propofol in sedation that are considered useful indicators for achieving adequate sedation. The study population comprised all patients undergoing implant-related surgery under intravenous sedation in Okayama University Hospital from April 2009 to March 2013. The infusion rate of propofol was adjusted to maintain the BIS value at 70-80. The outcome was the average infusion rate of propofol, and potential predictor variables were age, sex, body weight, treatment time, and amount of midazolam. Independent variables that affected the average infusion rate of propofol were extracted with multiple regression analysis. One hundred twenty-five subjects were enrolled. In the multiple regression analysis, female sex was shown to be significantly associated with a higher average infusion rate of propofol. Females may require a higher infusion rate of propofol than males to achieve adequate sedation while undergoing implant-related surgery.",

Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), a protein containing two BRDs termed BD1 and BD2, has emerged as an attractive candidate for the development of inhibitors targeting gene transcription in several types of cancers. In this study, we made structural modifications of previously reported BRD4 inhibitors, to develop new chemical scaffold 3,4-dihydroquinoxalin-2(1H)-one. Four series of compounds (compounds 7-10) were synthesized, and the BRD4-inhibitory activity and anti-proliferative effect of these compounds were evaluated. We found compound 10d has remarkable anti-proliferative activities toward leukemia cells and could induce apoptosis by mitochondrial pathways. Notably, the analysis of molecular docking suggested that hydrophobic interaction was essential for compound 10d to bind to BD1. In conclusion, these results demonstrate the potential of compound 10d to be utilized as a BRD4 inhibitor with apoptosis inducing effect in future leukemia therapy.",

This is a retrospective chart review of patients admitted to neurocritical care or neurosurgical services who were at risk for ethanol withdrawal between June 2011 and September 2015. Patients were divided into two groups based on the first medication administered for alcohol withdrawal management, either benzodiazepine (n=50) or enteral ethanol (n=50). The primary endpoint was the maximum change in Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol scale (CIWA) score within the first 24hours. Secondary endpoints included maximum and minimum CIWA score in 5days, length of stay, and change in Glasgow Coma Scale. Study groups differed by mortality risk, level of coma at admission, and other clinical characteristics, with the ethanol group appearing less severely ill. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the maximum change in CIWA score at 24hours (-0.97, 95%CI: -3.21 to 1.27, p=0.39). Hospital and intensive care unit length of stay was 6.5 days and 1 day shorter for the ethanol group (p=0.03 and p=0.02, respectively). In summary, enteral ethanol was preferentially used in patients who are more likely to be capable of tolerating oral intake. We found that the change from baseline in CIWA score or other physiologic variables was not substantially different between the two agents. The overall utility of benzodiazepines and enteral ethanol remains unclear for this population and further study is needed to determine superiority.",

Antipsychotics are the drugs used in the treatment of SCZ but it remains controversial the impact that typical vs. atypical antipsychotics has on the oxidative stress status in SCZ patients. In vitro, the antioxidant capacity of six antipsychotics was assessed by their ability to: decrease or scavenge reactive oxygen species in the neutrophil respiratory burst; donate hydrogen and stabilize the free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH); and scavenge 2,2'-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS(+)). This study demonstrated that both clozapine and olanzapine have antioxidant effects, in vitro, by scavenging superoxide anion on the respiratory burst, donating electron in the ABTS(+) assay and stabilizing the radical DPPH. Ziprasidone significantly scavenged ABTS(+) and stabilized the radical DPPH whereas risperidone significantly reduced the respiratory burst. Haloperidol and quetiapine lacked antioxidant effects. The chemical structure-related antioxidant capacity suggests a possible neuroprotective mechanism of these drugs on the top of their antipsychotic mechanism of action.",

However, we could not determine whether maternal fructose intake played a role in the gestation or lactation period because the dam rats were fed fructose solution during both periods. Thus, in this study, we analyzed the hippocampi of the offspring of dams fed fructose during the gestation or lactation period. Maternal fructose consumption during either the gestation or lactation period did not affect the mRNA levels of StAR, P450(17\u03b1), 11\u03b2-HSD-2, and 17\u03b2-HSD-1. PBR expression was down-regulated, even when rats consumed fructose during the lactation period only, while fructose consumption during gestation tended to activate the expression of P450(11\u03b2)-2. We found that maternal fructose intake during gestation and lactation differentially affected the expression of hippocampal neurosteroidogenic enzymes in the offspring.",

    "144": "One of the most exciting psychiatric conditions is the bizarre psychomotor syndrome called catatonia, which may present with a large number of different motor signs and even vegetative instability. Catatonia is potentially life threatening. The use of benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been efficient in the majority of patients. The rich clinical literature of the past has attempted to capture the nature of catatonia. But the lack of diagnostic clarity and operationalization has hampered research on catatonia for a long time. Within the last decades, it became clear that catatonia had to be separated from schizophrenia, which was finally accomplished in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). In DSM-5, catatonia syndrome may be diagnosed as a specifier to major mood disorders, psychotic disorders, general medical conditions, and as catatonia not otherwise specified. This allows diagnosing the syndrome in a large variety of psychiatric disorders. Currently, the pathobiology remains widely unknown. Suspected neurotransmitter systems include gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate. Neuroimaging reports pointed to reduced resting state activity and reduced task activation in motor areas of the frontal and parietal cortex. The new classification of catatonia will foster more clinical research and neuroscientific approaches by testing catatonia in various populations and applying stringent criteria. The scarce number of prospective trials will hopefully increase, as more trials will be encouraged within a more precise concept of catatonia.",

Oral glucose was administered at time 0\u00a0min and blood glucose measured in the time frame -15 to +150\u00a0min. Plasma insulin concentration was measured at time 0 and 20\u00a0min. All four anesthetic regimens resulted in impaired glucose tolerance compared to saline/no anesthesia. (1) hypnorm/midazolam increased insulin concentrations and caused an altered glucose tolerance; (2) ketamine/xylazine lowered insulin responses and resulted in severe hyperglycemia throughout the experiment; (3) isoflurane did not only alter the insulin secretion but also resulted in severe hyperglycemia; (4) pentobarbital resulted in both increased insulin secretion and impaired glucose tolerance.

If the patient had pain at T3 and other causes of pain were excluded, they were considered to have PPP, and the McGill Pain Questionnaire Short Form was applied. QoL was measured with the EuroQol 5-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D).", 
    "153": "One hundred seventy-five patients completed the study. The incidence of PPP was 28%, and the affected patients presented lower QoL. The majority referred to a moderate to severe level of interference in their general activity. Cholecystectomies were less associated with PPP, and total knee/hip replacements were more associated with it. Preoperative pain, preoperative benzodiazepines or antidepressants, and more severe acute postoperative pain were associated with the development of PPP. Half of the patients with PPP were under treatment, and they refer a mean symptomatic relief of 69%.",

Ezogabine and perampanel are approved for adjunctive treatment of partial epilepsy. Perampanel is also approved for adjunctive treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Ezogabine and perampanel have novel mechanisms of action. Ezogabine binds to voltage-gated potassium channels and increases the M-current thereby causing membrane hyperpolarization. Perampanel is a selective, non-competitive 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid receptor antagonist, which reduces neuronal excitation. Clobazam has been used worldwide since the 1970s and is approved for adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Clobazam is the only 1,5-benzodiazepine currently in clinical use, which is less sedating than the commonly used 1,4-benzodiazepines. Phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials demonstrated efficacy and good tolerability of these 3 new antiepileptic drugs. These drugs represent a welcome addition to the armamentarium of practitioners, but it remains to be seen how they will affect the landscape of pharmacoresistant epilepsy.",

Even though ketamine alone and in combination with midazolam or dexmedetomidine are frequently used in laboratory animals, the side-effects of such protocols are not well known. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the effects of ketamine alone and in combination with midazolam or dexmedetomidine on emotional reactivity, as well as the effects on learning and memory in adult rats at least 48\u2009h after anaesthesia. The evaluation of the potential influence of 100\u2009mg/kg ketamine administered alone and in combination with midazolam (5\u2009mg/kg), or dexmedetomidine (0.25\u2009mg/kg) on spatial learning and recognition memory was studied in adult Wistar rats using the radial maze as well as object recognition and location tests. The influence of these combinations on emotional reactivity was investigated using the new exploration test and the elevated plus maze. Results showed that ketamine alone or in combination with midazolam or dexmedetomidine affected neither spatial and recognition memory, nor emotional reactivity. These results reinforce the safe clinical use of ketamine and its combinations in rats in a research context since the administration of these anaesthetic combinations did not produce significant changes with regard to spatial and recognition memory or emotional reactivity. Furthermore, these results indicate that the quality of scientific data produced in adult rat neurobehavioural research is not jeopardized by the use of these anaesthetic protocols.",

Their protein products expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda 21 (Sf21) insect cells were incubated with olanzapine 100-2,000 \u03bcmol/l for 30 min. The kinetic parameters of Km, Vmax and intrinsic clearance were determined by 2-hydroxymethylolanzapine, the metabolite of olanzapine mediated by CYP2D6, using ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Results showed that the kinetic parameters of 2 alleles, CYP2D6*92 and 2D6*96, could not be detected; 17 allelic variants, CYP2D6*87-*88, 2D6*90-*91, 2D6*93-*95, 2D6*97, R25Q, F164L, E215K, F219S, V327M, V342M, R344Q, R440C and R497C, significantly reduced the intrinsic clearance of olanzapine; 2 variants, CYP2D6*89 and 2D6*98, increased the intrinsic clearance of olanzapine; no difference was found in intrinsic clearance of D336N. Furthermore, 6 alleles, CYP2D6*87, 2D6*88, 2D6*91, 2D6*93, 2D6*97 and R497C, exhibited higher Km values in a range of 120.80-217.56% relative to wild-type CYP2D6*1.

    "181": "Abnormal reemergence of depolarizing GABAA current during postnatal brain maturation may play a major role in paediatric epilepsies, Dravet syndrome (DS) being among the most severe. To study the impact of depolarizing GABA onto distinct patterns of EEG activity, we extended a neural mass model as follows: one sub-population of pyramidal cells was added as well as two sub-populations of interacting interneurons, perisomatic-projecting interneurons (basket-like) with fast synaptic kinetics GABAA (fast, I1) and dendritic-projecting interneurons with slow synaptic kinetics GABAA (slow, I2). Basket-like cells were interconnected to reproduce mutual inhibition mechanisms (I1\u2794I1). The firing rate of interneurons was adapted to mimic the genetic alteration of voltage gated sodium channels found in DS patients, SCN1A(+/-). We implemented the \"dynamic depolarizing GABAA\" mediated post-synaptic potential in the model, as some studies reported that the chloride reversal potential can switch from negative to more positive value depending on interneuron activity. The \"shunting inhibition\" promoted by GABAA receptor activation was also implemented. We found that increasing the proportion of depolarizing GABAA mediated IPSP (I1\u2794I1 and I1\u2794P) only (i.e., other parameters left unchanged) was sufficient to sequentially switch the EEG activity from background to (1) interictal isolated polymorphic epileptic spikes, (2) fast onset activity, (3) seizure like activity and (4) seizure termination. The interictal and ictal EEG patterns observed in 4 DS patients were reproduced by the model via tuning the amount of depolarizing GABAA postsynaptic potential. Finally, we implemented the modes of action of benzodiazepines and stiripentol, two drugs recommended in DS. Both drugs blocked seizure-like activity, partially and dose-dependently when applied separately, completely and with a synergic effect when combined, as has been observed in DS patients. This computational modeling study constitutes an innovative approach to better define the role of depolarizing GABA in infantile onset epilepsy and opens the way for new therapeutic hypotheses, especially in Dravet syndrome.",

    "186": "In hypoglossal motoneurons, a sustained anionic current, sensitive to a blocker of \u03c1-containing GABA receptors, (1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)methylphosphinic acid (TPMPA) and insensitive to bicuculline, was previously shown to be activated by gabazine. In order to better characterize the receptors involved, the sensitivity of this atypical response to pentobarbital (30\u03bcM), allopregnanolone (0.3\u03bcM) and midazolam (0.5\u03bcM) was first investigated. Pentobarbital potentiated the response, whereas the steroid and the benzodiazepine were ineffective. The results indicate the involvement of hybrid heteromeric receptors, including at least a GABA receptor \u03c1 subunit and a \u03b3 subunit, accounting for the pentobarbital-sensitivity. The effects of the endogenous \u03b2 amino acids, taurine and \u03b2-alanine, which are released under various pathological conditions and show neuroprotective properties, were then studied. In the presence of the glycine receptor blocker strychnine (1\u03bcM), both taurine (0.3-1mM) and \u03b2-alanine (0.3mM) activated sustained anionic currents, which were partly blocked by TPMPA (100\u03bcM). Thus, both \u03b2 amino acids activated \u03c1-containing GABA receptors in hypoglossal motoneurons. Bicuculline (20\u03bcM) reduced responses to taurine and \u03b2-alanine, but small sustained responses persisted in the presence of both strychnine and bicuculline. Responses to \u03b2-alanine were slightly increased by allopregnanolone, indicating a contribution of the bicuculline- and neurosteroid-sensitive GABAA receptors underlying tonic inhibition in these motoneurons. Since sustained activation of anionic channels inhibits most mature principal neurons, the \u03c1-containing GABA receptors permanently activated by taurine and \u03b2-alanine might contribute to some of their neuroprotective properties under damaging overexcitatory situations.",

Objective To examine changes following a range of interventions implemented by a RCP to improve the prescribing of antipsychotics. Setting Thirteen dementia and psychogeriatric units in New Zealand managed by a RCP. Method An audit (n\u00a0=\u00a0228 residents) was undertaken in thirteen dementia and psychogeriatric units in New Zealand in July-September 2011. A modified Best Practice Advocacy Centre (bpac(nz)) tool was used to examine antipsychotic prescribing, the administration of \"when required\" (PRN) antipsychotic doses and antipsychotic-related documentation (e.g. documenting of \"target behaviour identified\" and \"need to monitor for adverse effects\"). Prescribing for some central nervous system agents and fractures and fall rates were also examined.

Animals have been known to die during experimental surgery under anesthesia with Somnopentyl, causing it to be declared inadequate as a general anesthetic for single treatment. An anesthetic combination of 0.3 mg/kg medetomidine, 4.0 mg/kg midazolam and 5.0 mg/kg butorphanol (M/M/B:0.3/4/5) was reported to induce anesthesia for a duration of around 40 min in ICR mice; similar anesthetic effects were reported in both male and female BALB/c and C57BL/6J strains of mice. However, the anesthetic effects of this combination in Japanese field vole, Microtus montebelli, remain to be evaluated. In the present study, we assessed the effects of Somnopentyl and different concentrations of anesthetic combination (M/M/B:0.3/4/5, 0.23/3/3.75 or 0.15/2/2.5) in Japanese field voles, by means of anesthetic scores. We also examined effect of these anesthetics on production of offspring. Death of the animals was observed only with Somnopentyl. The anesthetic score of Somnopentyl was lower than those of the other anesthetics, although there were no significant differences in duration, body weight and frequency of respiratory among the evaluated anesthetics. Abortion rate with Somnopentyl was significantly higher than that with the M/M/B:0.23/3/3.75 combination, although there was no significant difference in the number of offspring between two. In conclusion, results of this study provide basic information for achieving appropriate anesthetic concentrations in addition to indicating a new, safe and effective surgical anesthetic for Japanese field voles.",

The numbers of single or combined prescriptions, per year for antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, or hypnotics were measured.",

Among older adults with dementia, 13.8% simultaneously consumed at least three psychotropics. All class age of older patients with dementia is more exposed to all psychotropics except for long-acting benzodiazepines.

Sample processing consists of a high-speed, high-temperature enzymatic hydrolysis for urine samples followed by a rapid supported liquid extraction (SLE). The combination of ultra-high resolution chromatography with high resolution mass spectrometry allows all 38 analytes to be uniquely detected with a ten minute analytical run. Limits of detection for all target analytes are 3ng/mL or better, with only 0.3mL of specimen used for analysis. The combination of low sample volume with fast processing and analysis makes this method a suitable replacement for immunoassay screening of the targeted drug classes, while providing far superior specificity and better limits of detection than can routinely be obtained by immunoassay.", 
    "216": "Early-life events have long-term effects on brain structures and cause behavioral alterations that persist into adulthood. The present experiments were designed to investigate the effects of prenatal stress on diazepam-induced withdrawal syndrome and serotonin-1A (5HT1A) receptor expression in the raphe nuclei of adult offspring. The results of the present study reveal that maternal exposure to chronic footshock stress increased the anxiety-like behavior in the prenatally stressed (PS) animals withdrawn from chronic diazepam (2.5mg/kg/day i.p for 1week). Moreover, prenatal stress induced a down-regulation of 5HT1A mRNA in the raphe nuclei of adult offspring. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that maternal exposure to chronic footshock stress enhances diazepam withdrawal symptoms and alters 5HT1A receptor gene expression in the raphe nuclei of adult offspring. Thus, more studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying the decrease of 5HT1A receptors expression in the raphe nuclei of PS rats.",

Despite being a very classical well-known side effect, physicians may underestimate this risk. Our series also confirms that the patient is misinformed about the consequences of an abrupt BZD discontinuation especially when the BZD has been consumed for many years. Interviewing patient and his family on the nature of the current medical treatments should be systematic and an early diagnostic step taken by physicians faced with a recent behavioral disorder.

In both groups, more than 50% have anxiety and depression; over 25% have associated somatic disorders and digestive diseases, respiratory, pain is the most common. Almost 99% use oral route; nearly 100% have a daily consumption and about 20% of the alcohol concomitantly; 24% of HDB use benzodiazepines and 18% of the methadone group (P=0.06); 33% of the population using methadone consume illicit psychoactive substances and 21% for HDB population (P<0.0001), in particular cannabis (P<0.0001). Heroin and cocaine are also consumed.", 
    "221": "The population consuming opiate maintenance treatments shows social, somatic and psychiatric vulnerability. Misuse associated forms and consumption of other psychoactive substances and illegal drugs are observed. Despite the complexity of management of these patients, general practitioners have a major role to play.",

    "224": "Data were obtained from national databases; the unit of measurement was defined daily dose per 1000\u00a0inhabitants. The five most prescribed drug classes were compared in each country in 2009, then benzodiazepines and antibiotics from 2006 to 2012. A literature review was focused on the context of prescriptions for each country.", 
    "225": "In 2009, the five most prescribed drug classes in the four countries represented seven classes in total. France was not the biggest prescriber of drugs, but from 2006 to 2012 benzodiazepines and antibiotics were prescribed much more in France than in the other countries. The evolution of prescriptions was different for each country, and very stable in France.", 
    "226": "In 2009, France was not the biggest drugs consumer of all classes, but was characterized by high prescriptions in some classes.", 
    "227": "Musculoskeletal conditions are common, and there are many options for pharmacologic therapy. Unfortunately, there is not strong evidence for the use of many of these medications. Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are generally first-line medications for most musculoskeletal pain, but there is more evidence these medications are not as safe as once thought. Other analgesic and antispasmodic medications can be effective for acute pain but generally are not as effective for chronic pain. Antidepressants and anticonvulsants can be more effective for chronic or neuropathic pain. Topical formulations of NSAIDs can be effective for pain with fewer side effects.", 
    "228": "Benzodiazepines are frequently prescribed to patients with drug use disorders. However, it has previously been difficult to distinguish whether this frequent prescribing was due to underlying psychiatric disorders or inappropriate prescribing. In a nationwide cohort study, we investigated the prescribing of benzodiazepines to patients with drug use disorders in connection with treatment admission.", 
    "229": "Benzodiazepine prescriptions to patients (N\u2009=\u200933203) aged 18 to 67\u00a0years admitting for outpatient treatment for drug use disorders in Denmark, 2000 to 2010, were studied by using linked data from nationwide health registries. Factors associated with increasing amounts of benzodiazepine use within the first year after admission were assessed by multinomial logistic regression. Proportions of very long-term benzodiazepine prescription were calculated.", 
    "230": "During the first year after admission to treatment, 26.2\u00a0% of patients were prescribed benzodiazepines. Of these, 35.5\u00a0% were prescribed benzodiazepines at dose levels that might indicate inappropriate use (>365 Defined Daily Dose per year), and 34.6\u00a0% were prescribed more than one type of benzodiazepines. Diazepam was the most commonly prescribed type. Among patients with opioid use, 43.2\u00a0% were prescribed benzodiazepines which were three times higher than for patients with cannabis (12.2\u00a0%) or central stimulating drugs (13.8\u00a0%) as their primary drug use. Admitting to treatment for a drug use disorder did not increase the specialized psychiatric treatment coverage of this patient group, disregarding use of prescribed benzodiazepines. 29.5\u00a0% were new users of prescribed benzodiazepines, and of these, 27.5\u00a0% continued into very long-term use (\u22654\u00a0years after admission) during the study period.", 
    "231": "Benzodiazepines were commonly prescribed to patients admitting to treatment for drug use disorders, and included prescription of multiple and non-optimal types, high doses, and very long-term prescriptions. These findings point towards inappropriate prescribing of benzodiazepines in many cases more than treatment for psychiatric disorders.", 
    "232": "The focus of this study was the understanding of the hydrate transformations of anhydrous olanzapine Forms I and II (the most common polymorphs) upon exposure to different moisture conditions (11, 53, 75, 93% RH) and direct contact with water (e.g. aqueous slurry) and the impact of hydration on the aqueous dissolution rates of the polymorphs. The kinetics of reversible transformations (anhydrate-hydrate phases) and the identification of polymorphs were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetry, infrared (DRIFT) and X-ray powder diffraction. The results showed that anhydrous Forms I and II have undergone water vapor phase induced transformations at 93% and 75% RH, respectively. At 93% RH Forms I and II showed to hydrate into dihydrates D and B, respectively, the latter with a higher hydration rate. The conversion of Form I into the dihydrate D showed to affect the dissolution rate of olanzapine (f2<50). As slurries both forms showed to hydrate into a mixture of two different Forms - dihydrate B and higher hydrate. The study provided an understanding of the conversion pathways of the different forms when they were exposed to humid air or aqueous environments, resembling the transformations that might occur during processing, storage or during the persecution of dissolution tests to assess the quality of dosage forms delivering olanzapine.", 
    "233": "Epidemiological evidence on the symptomatic profile, health status and illness behavior of people with subjective sensitivity to noise is still scarce. Also, it is unknown to what extent noise sensitivity co-occurs with other environmental sensitivities such as multi-chemical sensitivity and sensitivity to electromagnetic fields (EMF). A cross-sectional study performed in the Netherlands, combining self-administered questionnaires and electronic medical records of non-specific symptoms (NSS) registered by general practitioners (GP) allowed us to explore this further. The study sample consisted of 5806 participants, drawn from 21 general practices. Among participants, 722 (12.5%) responded \"absolutely agree\" to the statement \"I am sensitive to noise\", comprising the high noise-sensitive (HNS) group. Compared to the rest of the sample, people in the HNS group reported significantly higher scores on number and duration of self-reported NSS, increased psychological distress, decreased sleep quality and general health, more negative symptom perceptions and higher prevalence of healthcare contacts, GP-registered NSS and prescriptions for antidepressants and benzodiazepines. These results remained robust after adjustment for demographic, residential and lifestyle characteristics, objectively measured nocturnal noise exposure from road-traffic and GP-registered morbidity. Co-occurrence rates with other environmental sensitivities varied between 9% and 50%. Individuals with self-declared sensitivity to noise are characterized by high prevalence of multiple NSS, poorer health status and increased illness behavior independently of noise exposure levels. Findings support the notion that different types of environmental sensitivities partly overlap."
