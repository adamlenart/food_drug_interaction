    "0": "The presence of cholinergic innervation of small coronary arteries in the lamb was investigated by measuring choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities and by performing in vitro experiments in a microvascular myograph to establish whether or not there is a cholinergic component in the response to electrical field stimulation (EFS). ChAT-specific activity was present in proximal coronary segments, but was significantly higher in small coronary arteries. AChE-positive ganglia and fibres were distributed within the adventitia and outer third of the media in proximal coronary segments, and dense perivascular nerve plexuses were observed in small coronary arteries. Acetylcholine induced contractions in all preparations examined and relaxations in 20% of the segments contracted with the thromboxane analogue U46619. EFS did not induce neurogenic contractions in lamb small coronary arteries. In the presence of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, phentolamine, EFS caused frequency-dependent reproducible relaxations that were enhanced by the blocker of cholinergic transmission, botulinum neurotoxin. An inhibitor of AChE, physostigmine, had no significant effect on the relaxations caused by EFS, while both the muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine, and the muscarinic M2-receptor antagonist, AFDX 116, enhanced these responses. Blockade of sympathetic neurotransmission with guanethidine or incubation with the P2-receptor antagonist, suramin, abolished the relaxations induced by EFS, whereas propranolol was without effect. Low-frequency EFS caused less relaxation in preparations activated by acetylcholine than in those contracted with U46619, while sensitivity and maximal relaxation induced by adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) were not different in U46619- and acetylcholine-contracted arteries. The presence of the enzymes necessary for both biosynthesis and degradation of acetylcholine and the finding that blockers of cholinergic neurotransmission enhance EFS-induced relaxations suggest that small coronary arteries are cholinergically innervated.",

    "2": "Two patients (10 y, 34 mo) with GCSE refractory to benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and pentobarbital received intravenous VPA. Apparent volume of distribution (Vd) following a 20 mg/kg loading dose was 0.29 L/kg. Maintenance infusions of 4-6 mg/kg/h produced steady-state total concentrations of 66 mg/L and 92.4 mg/L (unbound concentration 44.6 mg/L). Clearance ranged from 63-66 mL/h/kg. An eight-year-old with NCSE received intravenous VPA (13.4 mg/kg load followed by 9 mg/kg every 8 h). Total and unbound steady-state VPA concentrations were 32.9 mg/L and 21.2 mg/L, respectively. Elimination half-life was eight hours.",

    "6": "A 31-year-old African-American woman with multiple psychiatric and medical disorders, including generalized seizure disorder, experienced seizure activity when switched from haloperidol to olanzapine. Olanzapine was discontinued, haloperidol was quickly titrated to the previous dose, and the patient was started on oral phenytoin with no further seizure activity noted. The patient remained seizure free and phenytoin was discontinued without complications.", 
    "7": "Determining causality in this case is complicated by the number of confounding factors that may have contributed to the occurrence of seizures in this patient. These factors include: (1) diagnosis of generalized seizure disorder, (2) diagnosis of organic mental disorder, (3) concurrent pharmacotherapy with medications implicated in lowering the seizure threshold, and (4) abrupt change in pharmacotherapy. The likelihood that a significant drug interaction precipitated seizure activity is doubtful.", 
    "8": "Considering all factors related to causality, the likelihood that olanzapine was responsible for precipitating seizure activity in this patient was judged possible. Although premarketing studies have indicated that olanzapine may be associated with minimal seizure liability, this case serves as a reminder that postmarketing surveillance of newly released medications is essential.", 
    "9": "The aim of this study was to analyse the antisecretory mechanism of L-365,260 in vitro in isolated rabbit gastric glands. We showed that compound L-365,260, described as a non-peptide specific competitive CCK-B receptor antagonist, was able to dose-dependently inhibit [14C]-aminopyrine accumulation induced by histamine (10(-4) M), carbachol (5x10(-5) M), 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX) (5x10(-6) M) and forskolin (5x10(-7) M) with similar IC50 values respectively of 1.1+/-0.6x10(-7) M, 1.9+/-1.2x10(-7) M, 4.2+/-2.0x10(-7) M and 4.0+/-2.8x10(-7) M. We showed that L-365,260 acted beyond receptor activation and production of intracellular second messengers and that it had no action on the H+/K+ -ATPase. We found that L-365,260 inhibited cyclic AMP-induced [14C]-aminopyrine accumulation in digitonin-permeabilized rabbit gastric glands, suggesting that this compound acted, at least in part, as an inhibitor of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway.", 
    "10": "The objective of this investigation was to characterize quantitatively the influence of the rate of increase in blood concentrations on the pharmacodynamics of midazolam in rats. The pharmacodynamics of midazolam were quantified by an integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling approach. Using a computer controlled infusion technique, a linear increase in blood concentrations up to 80 ng ml(-1) was obtained over different time intervals of 16 h, resulting in rates of rise of the blood concentrations of respectively, 1.25, 1.00, 0.87, 0.46, 0.34 and 0.20 ng ml(-1) min(-1). In one group of rats the midazolam concentration was immediately brought to 80 ng ml(-1) and maintained at that level for 4 h. Immediately after the pretreatment an intravenous bolus dose was given to determine the time course of the EEG effect in conjunction with the decline of midazolam concentrations. The increase in beta activity (11.5-30 Hz) of the EEG was used as pharmacodynamic endpoint. For each individual animal the relationship between blood concentration and the EEG effect could be described by the sigmoidal Emax model. After placebo, the values of the pharmacodynamic parameter estimates were Emax = 82+/-5 microV, EC50,u = 6.4+/-0.8 ng ml(-1) and Hill factor = 1.4+/-0.1. A bell-shaped relationship between the rate of change of midazolam concentration and the value of EC50,u was observed with a maximum of 21+/-5.0 ng ml(-1) at a rate of change of 0.46 ng ml(-1) min(-1); lower values of EC50,u were observed at both higher and lower rates. The findings of this study show that the rate of change in plasma concentrations is an important determinant of the pharmacodynamics of midazolam in rats.", 
    "11": "Selective activation of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) in adrenal cells and brain oligodendrocytes promotes steroidogenesis. Three 2-phenyl-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives (CB 34, CB 50 and CB 54) have now been investigated with regard to their selectivity for PBRs and their ability to stimulate central and peripheral steroidogenesis in rats. The three CB compounds (10(-10)-10(-4) M) potently inhibited the binding of the PBR ligand [3H]-PK 11195 to brain and ovary membranes in vitro, without substantially affecting [3H]-flunitrazepam binding to central benzodiazepine receptors. These compounds (10(-7)-10(-4) M) also had little or no marked effects on GABA-evoked Cl- currents in voltage-clamped Xenopus oocytes expressing human alpha1beta2gamma2S GABA(A) receptors. In addition, they failed to affect ligands binding to GABA(B), D1/D2 dopamine, muscarinic acetylcholine, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid and opiate receptors. Intraperitoneal administration of CB compounds (3-50 mg kg(-1)) induced a dose-dependent increase in the concentrations of neuroactive steroids in plasma and brain. The brain concentrations of pregnenolone, progesterone, allopregnanolone and allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) showed maximal increases in 96+/-3, 126+/-14, 110+/-12 and 70+/-13% above control, respectively, 30 to 60 min after injection of CB 34 (25 mg kg(-1)). CB 34 also increased the brain concentrations of neuroactive steroids in adrenalectomized-orchiectomized rats, although to a lesser extent than in sham-operated animals, suggesting that CB compounds stimulate brain steroidogenesis independently of their effects on peripheral tissues. The increase in brain and plasma neurosteroid content induced by CB 34 was associated with a marked anticonflict effect in the Vogel test. Our results indicate that the three CB compounds tested are specific and potent agonists at peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, and that they stimulate steroidogenesis in both the brain and periphery.", 
    "12": "Pitrazepin, 3-(piperazinyl-1)-9H-dibenz(c,f) triazolo(4,5-a)azepin is a piperazine antagonist of GABA in a variety of electrophysiological and in vitro binding studies involving GABA and glycine receptors. In the present study we have investigated the effects of pitrazepin, and the GABA(A) antagonist bicuculline, on membrane currents elicited by GABA in Xenopus oocytes injected with rat cerebral cortex mRNA or cDNAs encoding alpha1beta2 or alpha1beta2gamma2s human GABA(A) receptor subunits. The three types of GABA(A) receptors expressed were reversibly antagonized by bicuculline and pitrazepin in a concentration-dependent manner. GABA dose-current response curves for the three types of receptors were shifted to the right, in a parallel manner, by increasing concentrations of pitrazepin. Schild analyses gave pA2 values of 6.42+/-0.62, n = 4, 6.41+/-1.2, n = 5 and 6.21+/-1.24, n = 6, in oocytes expressing rat cerebral cortex, alpha1beta2 or alpha1beta2gamma2s human GABA(A) receptors respectively (values are given as means +/- s.e. mean), and the Hill coefficients were all close to unity. All this is consistent with the notion that pitrazepin acts as a competitive antagonist of these GABA(A) receptors; and that their antagonism by pitrazepin is not strongly dependent on the subunit composition of the receptors here studied. Since pitrazepin has been reported to act also at the benzodiazepine binding site, we studied the effect of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil) on the inhibition of alpha1beta2gamma2s receptors by pitrazepin. Co-application of Ro 15-1788 did not alter the inhibiting effect of pitrazepin. Moreover, pitrazepin did not antagonize the potentiation of GABA-currents by flunitrazepam. All this suggests that pitrazepin does not affect the GABA receptor-chloride channel by interacting with the benzodiazepine receptor site.", 
    "13": "In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of reports in the U.S. of the use of drugs, often in conjunction with alcohol, to commit sexual assault. A study was undertaken to assess the prevalence of drug use in sexual assault cases in which substances are suspected of being involved. Law enforcement agencies, emergency rooms, and rape crisis centers across the U.S. were offered the opportunity to submit urine samples collected from victims of alleged sexual assault, where drug use was suspected, for analysis of alcohol and drugs which may be associated with sexual assault. Each sample was tested by immunoassay for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine metabolite (benzoylecgonine), cannabinoids, methaqualone, opiates, phencyclidine and propoxyphene. The positive screen results were confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). In addition, each sample was tested for flunitrazepam metabolites and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) by GC-MS and for ethanol by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID). Over a 26-month period, 1179 samples were collected and analyzed from 49 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. The states sending the most samples were California (183), Texas (119), Florida (61), Pennsylvania (61), New York (61), Minnesota (50), Illinois (47), Indiana (44), Michigan (40), Maryland (37), Virginia (32), and Massachusetts (31). Four-hundred sixty eight of the samples were found negative for all the substances tested; 451 were positive for ethanol, 218 for cannabinoids, 97 for benzoylecgonine, 97 for benzodiazepines, 51 for amphetamines, 48 for GHB, 25 for opiates, 17 for propoxyphene, and 12 for barbiturates. There were no samples identified as positive for phencyclidine or methaqualone. In addition, 35% of the drug-positive samples contained multiple drugs. This study indicates that, with respect to alleged sexual assault cases, the prevalence of ethanol is very high, followed by cannabinoids, cocaine, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, and GHB. Although only a couple of substances have been implicated with sexual assault, this study has shown that almost 20 different substances have been associated with this crime. This study also raises the concern of illicit and licit drug use in sexual assault cases and suggests the need to test for a range of drugs in these cases. It also highlights the need to test for GHB, which is not generally tested for in a normal toxicology screen.", 
    "14": "1. This study examined the hypothesis that the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepine (BZ (omega)) receptor ligands may be associated with actions at a defined receptor subtype and/or their level of intrinsic activity using the mouse defense test battery. 2. This test has been designed to assess defensive reactions of Swiss mice confronted with a natural threat (a rat) and situations associated with this threat. Primary measures taken before, during and after rat confrontation were escape attempts, flight, risk assessment and defensive threat and attack. 3. The drugs used were the non-selective BZ (omega) receptor full agonist diazepam, the non-selective BZ (omega) receptor partial agonist bretazenil and the beta-carboline abecarnil which acts as a full agonist on GABAA receptors containing the alpha 1- and the alpha 3-subunits and as a partial agonist at receptors containing the alpha 2- and the alpha 5-subunits. The drugs were given alone and diazepam was co-administered with either bretazenil or abecarnil. 4. When administered alone, diazepam attenuated several defensive responses including risk assessment activities, defensive threat/attack reactions upon forced contact with the rat and escape attempts following the removal of the rat from the apparatus. Unlike diazepam, bretazenil was devoid of significant activity on defense and abecarnil displayed depressant activity. 5. Bretazenil blocked all behavioral effects of diazepam on defense behaviors. The co-administration of diazepam and abecarnil produced a behavioral profile similar to that observed when diazepam was administered alone, indicating that abecarnil did not influence the effects of diazepam on defense. By contrast, diazepam completely antagonized the sedative effects of abecarnil. 6. These findings indicate that only BZ (omega) ligands with high intrinsic efficacy at all BZ (omega) receptor subtypes display clear and specific effects on defensive behaviors in mice, and suggest that GABAA receptors containing the alpha 3 subunit might represent the primary target involved in the modulatory action of diazepam on defensive behaviors.", 
    "15": "We evaluated the potential utility of a group of indicators, each of which targets a particular tissue property, as indicators in the multiple-indicator dilution method to detect and to identify abnormalities in lung tissue properties resulting from lung injury models. We measured the pulmonary venous outflow concentration vs. time curves of [14C]diazepam, 3HOH, [14C]phenylethylamine, and a vascular reference indicator following their bolus injection into the pulmonary artery of isolated perfused rabbit lungs under different experimental conditions, resulting in changes in the lung tissue composition. The conditions included granulomatous inflammation, induced by the intravenous injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), and intratracheal fluid instillation, each of which resulted in similar increases in lung wet weight. Each of these conditions resulted in a unique pattern among the concentration vs. time outflow curves of the indicators studied. The patterns were quantified by using mathematical models describing the pulmonary disposition of each of the indicators studied. A unique model parameter vector was obtained for each condition, demonstrating the ability to detect and to identify changes in lung tissue properties by using the appropriate group of indicators in the multiple-indicator dilution method. One change that was particularly interesting was a CFA-induced change in the disposition of diazepam, suggestive of a substantial increase in peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors in the inflamed lungs.",

    "19": "Selectivity of antimuscarinic actions of AF-DX 116 (AF-DX) on the atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction was compared with those of pirenzepine and atropine by using the canine isolated, blood-perfused AV node preparation and the open-chest in situ dog heart. In the isolated AV node preparation, dose-response curves for negative dromotropic effects (prolongation of Atrio-His interval) of carbachol (CCh) injected into the posterior septal artery were shifted to the right in parallel by AF-DX, pirenzepine, and atropine with apparent pA2-values of 13, 27.5, and 0.45 microg, respectively, and slopes of the modified Schild plot of nearly unity. Meanwhile, dose-response curves for coronary vasodilator effects of CCh were shifted to the right by AF-DX, pirenzepine, and atropine with the apparent pA2 values of 68, 12.5, and 0.55 microg, respectively, but the slopes were far from unity. In the in situ open-chest heart, dose-response curves for negative dromotropic effects (prolongation of AV conduction time) of CCh given intravenously were shifted to the right in parallel by AF-DX, pirenzepine, and atropine with apparent pA2 values of 36, 32, and 1.25 microg/kg, respectively, and the slope of nearly unity, whereas dose-response curves for hypotensive effects of CCh were shifted to the right by AF-DX, pirenzepine, and atropine with apparent pA2 values of 105, 15, and 0.65 microg/kg, respectively, but the slopes of AF-DX and pirenzepine were far from unity. In addition, prolongations of AV conduction time by electrical stimulation of the left vagus nerve in the in situ heart were suppressed by AF-DX, pirenzepine, and atropine with the ID50, dose for 50% suppression, of 40, 35, and 1.9 microg/kg, respectively. These results suggest that (a) the potency of antimuscarinic actions of AF-DX on the CCh-induced negative dromotropic effects was almost equal to that of pirenzepine, and approximately 30 times less potent than atropine; (b) the M2-subtype selectivity of AF-DX was considerably higher in comparison with pirenzepine and atropine; and (c) the muscarinic receptor subtype on the canine AV node is entirely of the M2-type, but only sparsely developed in the coronary vascular beds.",

A single dose of tiagabine HCl 10 mg did not enhance the sedative or cognitive effects of a single dose of the benzodiazepine triazolam 0.125 mg, although the time-course of the effects was prolonged. Furthermore, tiagabine did not produce any statistically significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of triazolam. Similarly, the pharmacokinetics of tiagabine were not modified by triazolam.

    "26": "The present study examined the effect of atypical antipsychotic olanzapine on FG 7142- (N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide) and dizocilpine-induced cognitive impairment in active avoidance paradigm and elevated plus maze in mice. Both FG 7142 (5 mg/kg) and dizocilpine (0.1 mg/kg) increased the latency to reach shock-free zone (SFZ) both during training and retention session in active avoidance paradigm. This effect was reversed by olanzapine (0.063, 0. 125, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg). Similarly, FG 7142 (5 mg/kg) increased transfer latency (TL) on both first and second day in elevated plus maze. The lower doses of olanzapine (0.063 and 0.125 mg/kg) reversed the effect of FG 7142 on second day in elevated plus maze but higher doses (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) failed to modify the effect of FG 7142 both on first and second day. Dizocilpine (0.1 mg/kg) treatment did not affect TL on first day while on second day, it increased TL significantly. Olanzapine (0.063 and 0.125 mg/kg) reversed the effect of dizocilpine on elevated plus maze but the higher doses (0. 25 and 0.5 mg/kg) failed to reverse it. Even though olanzapine (0. 063, 0.125 and 0.25 mg/kg) failed show any effect per se in active avoidance task, the higher dose (0.5 mg/kg) increased the latency to reach SFZ on second day. Olanzapine (0.063, 0.125, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) did not show any per se effect on TL in elevated plus maze on first day while on second day, olanzapine (0.125, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) increased TL as compared to control group. The present study demonstrated olanzapine's reversal of dizocilpine- and FG 7142-induced behavioural changes in active avoidance paradigm and elevated plus maze. Although the precise mechanism of action is unknown, olanzapine might be acting by blocking excessive dopaminergic activity in the prefrontal cortex.", 
    "27": "Using flow cytometry in conjunction with a voltage-sensitive fluorescent indicator dye (oxonol), we have identified and separated embryonic hippocampal cells according to the sensitivity of their functionally expressed GABAA receptors to zolpidem. Immunocytochemical and RT-PCR analysis of sorted zolpidem-sensitive (ZS) and zolpidem-insensitive (ZI) subpopulations identified ZS cells as postmitotic, differentiating neurons expressing alpha2, alpha4, alpha5, beta1, beta2, beta3, gamma1, gamma2, and gamma3 GABAA receptor subunits, whereas the ZI cells were neuroepithelial cells or newly postmitotic neurons, expressing predominantly alpha4, alpha5, beta1, and gamma2 subunits. Fluctuation analyses of macroscopic Cl- currents evoked by GABA revealed three kinetic components of GABAA receptor/Cl- channel activity in both subpopulations. We focused our study on ZI cells, which exhibited a limited number of subunits and functional channels, to directly correlate subunit composition with channel properties. Biophysical analyses of GABA-activated Cl- currents in ZI cells revealed two types of receptor-coupled channel properties: one comprising short-lasting openings, high affinity for GABA, and low sensitivity to diazepam, and the other with long-lasting openings, low affinity for GABA, and high sensitivity to diazepam. Both types of channel activity were found in the same cell. Channel kinetics were well modeled by fitting dwell time distributions to biliganded activation and included two open and five closed states. We propose that short- and long-lasting openings correspond to GABAA receptor/Cl- channels containing alpha4beta1gamma2 and alpha5beta1gamma2 subunits, respectively.", 
    "28": "The molecular mode of action of arsenic, a therapeutic agent employed in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, has been elusive. Here we provide evidence that arsenic compounds may act on mitochondria to induce apoptosis. Arsenite induces apoptosis accompanied by a loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Delta Psim). Inhibition of caspases prevents the arsenite-induced nuclear DNA loss, but has no effect on the Delta Psim dissipation and cytolysis induced by arsenite. In contrast, Bcl-2 expression induced by gene transfer prevents all hallmarks of arsenite-induced cell death, including the Delta Psim collapse. PK11195, a ligand of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor, neutralizes this Bcl-2 effect. Mitochondria are required in a cell-free system to mediate arsenite-induced nuclear apoptosis. Arsenite causes the release of an apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. This effect is prevented by the permeability transition (PT) pore inhibitor cyclosporin A, as well as by Bcl-2, which is known to function as an endogenous PT pore antagonist. Arsenite also opens the purified, reconstituted PT pore in vitro in a cyclosporin A- and Bcl-2-inhibitible fashion. Altogether these data suggest that arsenite can induce apoptosis via a direct effect on the mitochondrial PT pore.", 
    "29": "In this study, we demonstrate that clozapine and other atypical antipsychotic drugs induce a paradoxical internalization of 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A receptors in vitro and a redistribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A receptors in vivo. We discovered that clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone and the putative atypical antipsychotic drug MDL 100,907 all induced 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A receptor internalization in fibroblasts stably expressing the 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A receptor in vitro. Two 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A antagonists (mianserin and ritanserin), which have been demonstrated to reduce negative symptoms in schizophrenia, also caused 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A receptor internalization. Four different drugs, each devoid of 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A antagonist activity, had no effect on the subcellular distribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A receptors in vitro. Treatment of rats for seven days with clozapine induced an increase in intracellular 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A receptor-like immunoreactivity in pyramidal neurons, while causing a decrease in labeling of apical dendrites in the medial prefrontal cortex. This redistribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A receptors in pyramidal neurons was also seen when rats were chronically treated with another atypical antipsychotic drug, olanzapine. The typical antipsychotic drug haloperidol, however, did not induce a redistribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A receptors in pyramidal neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex. Taken together, these results demonstrate that several atypical antipsychotic drugs with high 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A receptor affinities induce a redistribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A receptors both in vivo and in vitro. It is conceivable that the loss of 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A receptors from the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons is important for the beneficial effects of atypical antipsychotic drugs and other 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A antagonists in schizophrenia.", 
    "30": "The effects of carbachol (0.01-30 microM) and muscarine (10-30 microM) on the excitatory synaptic potentials were studied using conventional intracellular recordings from dopaminergic neurons in rat mesencephalic slices. Both muscarinic agonists reversibly reduced the excitatory synaptic potentials, evoked by local electrical stimulation. The EC50 for carbachol was determined to be 4.5 microM. The maximal degree of the excitatory synaptic potentials suppression caused by carbachol and muscarine was around 40% of control. This suppression was completely blocked by the non-specific muscarinic antagonist atropine (1 microM) and the selective M3 antagonist 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (1 microM). Other antagonists, preferentially acting at M1, M2 and M4 receptors, were not effective. Furthermore, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, physostigmine (50 microM), decreased the amplitude of the excitatory synaptic potentials, indicating that ambient acetylcholine can depress this potential. Direct depolarizing responses to glutamate were not changed by muscarine. In addition, muscarine facilitated the second excitatory synaptic potentials during a paired-pulse protocol. Thus, the effect of the muscarinic agonists is attributable to a presynaptic locus of action. The action of muscarine was not mediated by an N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive G-protein since it was not modified by a treatment of the slices with this agent. The calcium channels blockers, omega-conotoxin GIVA, omega-agatoxin IVA and omega-conotoxin MVIIC did not affect the action of muscarine on the excitatory synaptic potentials. When the potassium currents were reduced by extracellular barium and 4-aminopyridine, the muscarinic agonists still depressed the excitatory synaptic potentials. Our data indicate that presynaptically located M3 receptors modulate the excitatory transmission to midbrain dopaminergic neurons via a N-ethylmaleimide-insensitive G-protein which activates mechanisms neither linked to N-, P-, Q-type calcium channels nor to barium- and 4-aminopyridine-sensitive potassium channels.", 
    "31": "We have recently shown that diazepam can reduce mortality of acute iron overdose in rats. The mechanism for that effect is not yet defined. Our objective in the present study was to assess whether diazepam can similarly reduce mortality of experimental acute acetaminophen intoxication. Survival of rabbits was compared among four groups receiving 3 g/kg (body weight) of acetaminophen (LD40) orally each, followed by: 1) nothing (group I), 2) one oral dose of 140 mg/kg N-acetylcystein (NAC) an hour later (group II), 3) intramuscular injection of 7 mg/kg diazepam (group III), 4) intramuscular injection of 7 mg/kg diazepam and one oral dose of 140 mg/kg NAC an hour later (group IV). 37.5% of rabbits in group I died after 16 hours, whereas none of the rabbits in group III died, (p = 0.04). No animal died during the 96-hour observation period in groups II and IV. Two and four hours post drug administration, acetaminophen plasma concentrations (APC) were significantly lower among rabbits in group III than in group I (p = 0.0007 and 0.01, respectively) and significantly lower among rabbits in group IV than in those in group II (p<0.0001 and p = 0.03, respectively). Acetaminophen plasma concentrations 2 hours after drug administration were also significantly lower among rabbits in group III than in those in group II (p = 0.0002). Seven and 24 hours after dosage, APC tended to be higher among rabbits in group III than in those in group I, but not significantly so. Administration of diazepam without NAC did not prevent liver and renal dysfunction. We conclude that early administration of diazepam in acute experimental acetaminophen overdose in rabbits reduced APC and mortality, probably by slowing intestinal motility, which resulted in delayed acetaminophen absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.", 
    "32": "To compare the characteristics of induction, maintenance and awakening for three techniques of combined total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA): propofol-ketamine, midazolam-ketamine and propofol-fentanyl.", 
    "33": "Sixty patients were randomly assigned to three TIVA groups. Group 1 (n = 20) received midazolam, ketamine and vecuronium. Group 2 (n = 20) received propofol, ketamine and vecuronium. Group 3 (n = 20) received propofol, fentanyl and vecuronium. The variables compared were hemodynamic changes during induction and maintenance and upon awakening; time until awakening; and the incidence of postanesthetic complications. We also assessed whether propofol was better than midazolam at preventing the psychomimetic effects of ketamine.", 
    "34": "The demographic characteristics of the three groups were similar. Hemodynamic variables were most stable in group 2. Perfusion of midazolam-ketamine was accompanied by a significantly higher number of hypertensive peaks. Time to awakening was significantly shorter in Group I (11.8 +/- 5 min) than in group 2 (20.2 +/- 12.5 min); in group 2 time to awakening was 16.6 +/- 5.6 min. Eight patients in group 1, 5 in group 2 and 1 in group 3 reported having bad dreams, the difference between groups 1 and 3 reaching statistical significance. No patient experienced hallucinations and all reported satisfaction with the anesthetic technique used.", 
    "35": "TIVA with ketamine and propofol is comparable to the most commonly used combination of propofol and fentanyl and may be an appropriate choice when hemodynamic stability is of great importance; withdrawal 15 min before ending surgery prevents prolonged awakening. Perfusion of midazolam-ketamine is not recommendable for scheduled surgery because it induces too many hypertensive peaks. Although neither midazolam nor propofol completely prevents the psychomimetic effects of ketamine, such effects are not so severe that patients reject the anesthetic technique used.", 
    "36": "The independent and combined effects of L-arginine (840 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.75 mg/kg) pretreatment (30 min) were tested on ammonium chloride (400 mg/kg)-induced convulsions in rats. Ammonia concentrations were determined in blood and brain regions (cerebral cortex, brain stem and cerebellum) 30 min after L-arginine or diazepam treatment. Ammonia concentrations were measured at the time of induction of convulsions by ammonium chloride in L-arginine, diazepam or saline pretreated animals. L-arginine and not diazepam decreased ammonia concentrations in control as well as in ammonium chloride-treated animals. However, both the compounds suppressed convulsions elicited by ammonium chloride. Protection produced concurrently by these agents was much greater than that produced by them independently. It is concluded that convulsions caused by hyperammonemic condition can be suppressed either by preventing a rise in brain ammonia to toxic level or by anticonvulsant agents having a GABA potentiating action. A much greater protection can be achieved if agents having these properties are administered concurrently.",

    "40": "After premedication with lorazepam (2 mg) the day before and hydroxyzine (100 mg) one hour before surgery, anaesthesia was induced with remifentanil administered continuously with a syringe pump at a rate of 1.20 +/- 0.06 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 and propofol (3 mg.kg-1 IV bolus). The trachea was intubated two minutes later and mouth opening, glottis exposure, glottis opening, movements, additional anaesthetic agents and chest rigidity were recorded.", 
    "41": "Intubation conditions were excellent in 87% of patients, and the tube was inserted rapidly, within two minutes. However in 38% of patients the cuff inflation caused cough. In 13%, glottis opening was delayed and intubation required three minutes. A major decrease of arterial pressure and heart rate was recorded in 9 and 6% of patients respectively.", 
    "42": "Induction of anaesthesia using remifentanil and propofol allows satisfactory tracheal intubation without a muscle relaxant. However this technique is contraindicated: a) in patients with a full stomach, as intubation is not always successful at the first attempt; b) in patients scheduled to undergo neurosurgery or ophthalmic surgery, as tracheal intubation may elicit cough, increasing intra-cranial and intra-ocular pressure; c) in patients in poor circulatory status, as it decreases significantly arterial pressure and heart rate.", 
    "43": "Levels of inhibitory amino acid receptors were studied in the weaver (wv/wv) mouse model of dopamine (DA) deficiency after unilateral intrastriatal transplantation of fetal mesencephalic cell suspensions. Graft integration was verified by turning behavior tests and from the topographical levels of the DA transporter, tagged autoradiographically with 3 nM [3H]GBR 12935. The average increase in [3H]GBR 12935 binding in grafted dorsal striatum compared to nongrafted wv/wv striatum was 60% 3 months after grafting. Autoradiography of 8 nM [3H]flunitrazepam and 12 nM [3H]muscimol binding was carried out to visualize the distribution of GABAA receptors in +/+ mice and in recipient weaver mutants. A 17% increase in [3H]flunitrazepam binding and a 20% increase in [3H]muscimol binding was found in the nongrafted dorsal striatum of weaver mutants compared to +/+. The functional mesencephalic grafts had a partial normalizing effect on both [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]muscimol binding in the dorsal striatum of the weaver recipients. The normalization brought about by the grafts was around 20% for [3H]flunitrazepam binding and more than 40% for [3H]muscimol binding. The results are discussed in the context of the important interaction between the converging glutamatergic corticostriatal and DAergic nigrostriatal pathways in controlling the functional GABAergic output of the basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease and in experimental models of DA deficiency.", 
    "44": "We have explored the possibility that the GABA system can influence the expression of FGF-2 in the spinal cord. The GABA agonist diazepam was systemically injected in adult rats, and the expression of FGF-2 was examined in the cervical spinal cord region between 6 h and 7 days post-injection. Results of nuclease protection assays showed increases in FGF-2 mRNA, starting by 6 h and returning to approximately control values by 3 days. There was an increase in the density of FGF-2 immunostained astrocyte-like cells between 6 h and 3 days. Results showing that diazepam up-regulates FGF-2 expression in the spinal cord suggest that GABA may promote neuroplasticity in concert with FGF-2.", 
    "45": "Cortical acetylcholine, under resting and stimulated conditions, was measured in frontoparietal and prefrontal cortex using in vivo microdialysis in freely-moving rats. Cortical acetylcholine efflux was stimulated by systemic administration of the benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist FG 7142. Administration of FG 7142 (8.0 mg/kg; i.p.) significantly elevated acetylcholine efflux in both cortical regions (150-250% relative to baseline) for 30 min after drug administration. The ability of endogenous dopamine to regulate cortical acetylcholine efflux under resting or stimulated conditions and the relative contributions of D1- and D2-like dopamine receptor activation was also assessed. In a first series of experiments, systemic administration of the antipsychotic drug haloperidol (0.15, 0.9 mg/kg, i.p.) blocked FG 7142-stimulated acetylcholine efflux in frontoparietal, cortex while the D1-like antagonist, SCH 23390 (0.1, 0.3 mg/kg), was less effective in attenuating stimulated acetylcholine efflux. In a second series of experiments, the effects of infusions of these antagonists and of the D2-like antagonist sulpiride (10, 100 microM) into the nucleus accumbens were assessed. Infusions of haloperidol and sulpiride significantly blocked FG 7142-stimulated acetylcholine efflux while SCH 23390 did not. By contrast, a third series of experiments demonstrated that perfusion of these antagonists (100 microM) locally into the cortex (through the probe) did not affect FG 7142-stimulated acetylcholine efflux. Moreover, none of these dopamine receptor antagonists, whether administered systemically or perfused into the nucleus accumbens or cortex, affected basal cortical acetylcholine efflux. These results reveal similarities in stimulated cortical acetylcholine release across frontal cortical regions and suggest a prominent role for D2-mediated accumbens dopamine transmission in the regulation of cortical acetylcholine release. The findings provide evidence in support of a neural substrate that links dysregulation of mesolimbic dopaminergic transmission to changes in cortical cholinergic transmission. Dysregulation within this circuit is hypothesized to contribute to the etiology of disorders such as schizophrenia, dementia and drug abuse.", 
    "46": "During the period from July 1995 to June 1996 we performed transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) on 824 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Among them, 13 were dementia patients between 74 and 96 years old; they presented with urinary hesitancy in 6, retention in 4, frequency in 2 and incontinence in 1 patient. Past history included stroke in 7, hypertension in 6, pulmonary tuberculosis in 4, diabetes in 3, asthma in 2, angina pectoris in 1, Parkinson's disease in 1, pneumonia in 1, and hepatitis in 1. Careful preoperative examination revealed that they were proper candidates for TURP. They underwent TURP under spinal anesthesia. The mean operative time was 34 min, ranging from 20 to 60 min. The adenoma resected weighed 24 g on the average, ranging from 7.5 to 48 g. During surgery, although hypotension was noted in 2 patients, there was no serious morbidity. Their mental condition was well controlled with ketamine and diazepam during and after surgery. Postoperative complications included acute myocardial infarction in 1, multiple gastric ulcer in 1, and decubitus in 1. None died within 3 months after TURP, 3 died there after, and 10 patients were alive at the mean follow-up period of 26 months. Six patients reported good urination, 3 reported some improvement in urination after surgery, although requiring intermittent catheterization and 1 developed mild incontinence. In conclusion, TURP appears to provide some benefit in selected patients with dementia and should not be considered to be a contraindication for such patients.", 
    "47": "We used the cholecystokinin receptor antagonist devazepide to assess the importance of CCK in mediating the anorexia produced by 2-h duodenal infusions of peptone, a protein digest, at dark onset in nonfasted rats. Peptone alone (0.14-2.24 g/h) suppressed food intake dose dependently by 18-96%, with an approximate half-maximal dose of 1 g/h. Peptone-induced reductions in caloric ingestion were comparable to the caloric loads infused. Devazepide alone (30-1,000 microgram/kg) stimulated food intake dose dependently by 30-73%, with a minimal effective dose of 100 micrograms/kg. Devazepide appeared to reverse the anorexic response to peptone (1.1 g/h) dose dependently by 29-65%, with a minimal effective dose of 30 micrograms/kg. The magnitudes of these devazepide-induced effects were similar to, and in some cases were larger than, those produced when the same doses of devazepide were administered alone. Coadministration of devazepide (1,000 micrograms/kg) and a lower peptone dose (0.8 g/h) produced similar results. These results suggest that an essential CCK mechanism plays a significant role in mediating the satiety response to duodenal delivery of protein.", 
    "48": "Human gallbladders with cholesterol stones exhibit impaired muscle contraction induced by agonists that act on transmembrane receptors, increased membrane cholesterol content, and abnormal cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratio compared with those with pigment stones. The present study was designed to investigate the functions of the CCK receptor of gallbladder muscle membranes by radioreceptor assay and cross-linking. 125I-labeled CCK-8 binding was time-dependent, competitive, and specific. Scatchard analysis showed that the maximum specific binding (Bmax) was significantly decreased in cholesterol compared with pigment stone gallbladders (0.18 +/- 0. 07 vs. 0.38 +/- 0.05 pmol/mg protein, P < 0.05). In contrast, the affinity for CCK was higher in cholesterol than pigment stone gallbladders (0.18 +/- 0.06 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.23 nM). Similar results were observed in binding studies with the CCK-A receptor antagonist [3H]L-364,718. Cross-linking and saturation binding studies also showed significantly less CCK binding in gallbladders with cholesterol stones. These abnormalities were reversible after incubation with cholesterol-free liposomes. The Bmax increased (P < 0.01) and the dissociation constant decreased (P < 0.001) after incubation with cholesterol-free liposomes. In conclusion, human gallbladders with cholesterol stones have impaired CCK receptor binding compared with those with pigment stones. These changes are reversed by removal of the excess membrane cholesterol. These receptor alterations may contribute to the defective contractility of the gallbladder muscle in patients with cholesterol stones.", 
    "49": "Fluoxetine and its active metabolite norfluoxetine have long half-lives of 4-6 days and 4-16 days, respectively. We postulated that, owing to the long elimination half-life, patients diagnosed with panic disorder might be maintained on fluoxetine taken once a week, after being treated initially with daily doses of fluoxetine.", 
    "50": "Ten patients with DSM-III-R panic disorder were treated openly with fluoxetine, 20-40 mg daily. Once panic free, these patients were switched to once-weekly dosing of fluoxetine, and dosage was titrated as needed.", 
    "51": "All 10 patients successfully switched to once-weekly dosing. One patient reported recurrence of panic attacks 18 months after the switch. After a brief treatment for 4 weeks with benzodiazepines and daily fluoxetine, the patient was once again maintained on once-weekly dosing when rechallenged. Patients have been maintained in a panic-free state for up to 26 months with a single weekly dose of fluoxetine ranging from 10 to 60 mg. The medication was well tolerated.", 
    "52": "Fluoxetine at doses ranging from 10 to 60 mg administered once weekly appears to be effective maintenance treatment for patients with panic disorder who were initially treated successfully with daily fluoxetine. A once-weekly regimen may allow for considerable cost savings and may serve as a convenient alternative method for treating panic disorder.", 
    "53": "Although Social Phobia has been recognised for centuries in comparison with other anxiety disorders, relatively little work has been done to understand its neural basis. The present review attempts to redress this balance by giving an overview of the current state of knowledge in this disorder. By putting together data from the treatment responses to specific agents, the effects of chemical challenges which have been used in other anxiety disorders and by reviewing data on central and peripheral neurotransmitter and endochrine abnormalities, it is possible to begin to generate some potentially testable theories of aetiology and mechanisms. Finally, we review the potential use of neuroimaging techniques to better detail the brain circuits and possibly neurotransmitters involved in social phobia, showing some of our preliminary work using (15)O water blood flow PET activation studies to determine the brain circuits in which metabolism is changed during the experience of social anxiety.", 
    "54": "Social phobia has a direct effect on the ability of the individual to interact with others in social or work situations and as a result is associated with a high level of dysfunction. The level of impairment is as severe as that found in other chronic disorders such as depression and is increased by a cascade of comorbidity, which complicates management. Efficacy in social phobia was reported with the MAOIs and this led to the investigation of reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase-A (RIMA) which offer a safer alternative. The efficacy of moclobemide has been shown in social phobia and the effect is more clear cut in patients with more severe symptoms. The better effect in severe social phobia has also been reported with the SSRI paroxetine. Effective treatment of social phobia appears to be able to overcome the substantial chronicity of illness which is frequent in sufferers. The introduction of these treatments should encourage people with social phobia to seek medical help for this hitherto much neglected disorder.", 
    "55": "The anxiolytic effect of Eurycoma longifolia Jack in mice was examined. Fractions of E. longifolia Jack extract produced a significant increase in the number of squares crossed (controls= 118.2 +/- 10.2 squares), but significantly decreased both the immobility (controls = 39.4+/- 4.0 sec) and fecal pellets (controls= 12.3 +/-2.1 fecal pellets) when compared with control mice in the open-field test; they significantly increased the number of entries (controls=6.7+/-0.5 entries) and time spent (controls=42.9+/-0.1 sec) in the open arms, but decreased both the number of entries (controls= 13.2+/-0.7 entries) and time spent (controls= 193.4+/-0.7 sec) when compared with the control mice in the closed arms of the elevated plus-maze test. Furthermore, fractions of E. longifolia Jack extract decreased the fighting episodes significantly (controls= 18.0+/-0.4 fighting episodes) when compared with control mice. In addition, these results were found to be consistent with anxiolytic effect produced by diazepam. Hence, this study supports the medicinal use of this plant for anxiety therapy.", 
    "56": "To study the effects of perfume and phytoncid on GABAA receptors, ionotropic GABAA receptors were expressed in Xenopus oocytes by injecting mRNAs that had been prepared from rat whole brain. Essential oil, perfume and such phytoncid as leaf alcohol, hinokitiol, pinene, eugenol, citronellol and citronellal potentiated the response in the presence of GABA at low concentrations (10 and 30 microM), possibly because they bound to the potentiation-site in GABAA receptors and increased the affinity of GABA to the receptors. Since it is known that the potentiation of GABAA receptors by benzodiazepine, barbiturate, steroids and anesthetics induces the anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and sedative activity or anesthetic effect, these results suggest the possibility that the intake of perfume or phytoncid through the lungs, the skin or the intestines modulates the neural transmission in the brain through ionotropic GABAA receptors and changes the frame of the human mind, as alcohol or tobacco does.", 
    "57": "Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) plays a prominent role in the metabolism of a vast array of drugs and xenobiotics and exhibits broad substrate specificities. Most cytochrome P450-mediated reactions follow simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics. These parameters are widely accepted to predict pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic consequences in vivo caused by exposure to one or multiple drugs. However, CYP3A4 in many cases exhibits allosteric (sigmoidal) characteristics that make the Michaelis constants difficult to estimate. In the present study, diazepam, temazepam and nordiazepam were employed as substrates of CYP3A4 to propose a kinetic model. The model hypothesized that CYP3A4 contains two substrate-binding sites in a single active site that are both distinct and co-operative, and the resulting velocity equation had a good fit with the sigmoidal kinetic observations. Therefore, four pairs of the kinetic estimates (KS1, kalpha, KS2, kbeta, KS3, kdelta, KS4 and kgamma) were resolved to interpret the features of binding affinity and catalytic ability of CYP3A4. Dissociation constants KS1 and KS2 for two single-substrate-bound enzyme molecules (SE and ES) were 3-50-fold greater than KS3 and KS4 for a two-substrate-bound enzyme (SES), while respective rate constants kdelta and kgamma were 3-218-fold greater than kalpha and kbeta, implying that access and binding of the first molecule to either site in an active pocket of CYP3A4 can enhance the binding affinity and reaction rate of the vacant site for the second substrate. Thus our results provide some new insights into the co-operative binding of two substrates in the inner portions of an allosteric CYP3A4 active site.",

    "62": "Neuroleptic-induced side effects may occur frequently in patients with bipolar affective disorder and should therefore be monitored thoroughly. Demasking effects due to diminishing parkinsonian symptoms may contribute to akathisia-onset after neuroleptic dose reduction. Early application of alternative treatment regimens, e.g. monotherapy with mood stabilizers in combination with benzodiazepines should be considered.", 
    "63": "The preliminary findings require further investigation regarding dose dependency, incidence of akathisia in untreated patients with bipolar affective disorder, akathisia in patients with depressed episodes on SSRI, and possible differences between various mood stabilizers in their propensity to enhance akathisia, as well as possible sex differences.", 
    "64": "A 12 month review of infants admitted with neonatal abstinence syndrome to a neonatal intensive care unit was undertaken. The relationship of maternal drug abuse to symptoms, the effectiveness of pharmacologic agents in controlling symptoms and the length of inpatient stay were investigated. A retrospective review of maternal and infant records was performed. Those infants with a serial Finnegan score greater than 8 were treated. Pharmacologic treatment was oral morphine sulphate (0.2 mg 4-6 hourly), phenobarbitone (3-7 mgs/kg/day), or combination of the above. 43 infants were admitted to the hospital during the year. The average maternal age was 24.6 years, (18-34 years). Drug use volunteered by the mothers was methadone alone in 6 cases, methadone and benzodiazepines in 14, methadone and heroin and benzodiazepines in 7, methadone and heroin in 10, heroin alone in 2, and other multiple drug use including oral morphine sulphate, dothiepin and cannabis in 4. Average gestational age was 40.3 (35-42 weeks). The average birthweight was 2.81 kgs (1.89-3.91 kgs). Time to onset of withdrawal symptoms was 2.8 (1-13) days. The duration of pharmacologic treatment (oral morphine sulphate and/or phenobarbitone) was 21.8 (1-62) days. The total hospital stay for the 43 infants was 1,011 days. This study confirms that polydrug abuse is the commonest type of drug abuse in Dublin. The duration of withdrawal symptoms is loosely related to drug type, but increasing duration of symptoms is noted for infants exposed to benzodiazepines. Our experience would favour the use of morphine sulphate to treat pure opiate withdrawal symptoms. Over the 12-month period, there was an average occupancy of 3 beds per day in the paediatric department.",

Sixty-six completed a questionnaire in 1992, and 51 of those completed a follow-up questionnaire in 1997. This report focuses on the experts' responses to questions about therapeutic options relevant to seven vignettes describing typical cases of different anxiety disorders.", 
    "68": "The preferred initial treatment strategy in 1992 was a combination of medication with a psychological therapy for all vignettes except simple phobia, where a psychological procedure alone was favored. There was little change in 1997, primarily some decrease in the choice of psychological therapy and some increase in the choice of medication for social phobia. Experts recommending a medication in 1992 most often chose as first-line treatment a benzodiazepine anxiolytic (BZ) for panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), simple phobia, and adjustment disorder. They recommended a beta-blocker most often for social phobia and a tricyclic anti-depressant (TCA) for agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Nearly a fourth chose a combination of medications, usually a TCA plus a BZ. In 1997, the expert panel's most frequent recommendation for agoraphobia, PD, and OCD changed to a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI); and they also recommended these compounds more often for GAD, social phobia, and simple phobia. Fewer experts chose BZs or TCAs. However, in 1997 many again chose a combination of medications, often a BZ plus a SSRI, so that, overall, there was only a small decline in recommendations for BZs. As second-line medications (1997 only), the experts recommended SSRIs most often for most vignettes, but a TCA for PD and GAD. Recommendations for a combination of medications rose substantially for most vignettes, usually a BZ plus an antidepressant.", 
    "69": "Combined cognitive-behavioral therapy plus medication was highly favored by the experts as the initial treatment strategy for anxiety disorders. During the preceding five years, SSRIs displaced older antidepressants as the experts' first-line choices for the pharmacotherapy of anxiety disorders. In case of an unsatisfactory response, the experts' second-line choices more often were an older antidepressant or a combination of an antidepressant plus a BZ. According to the experts' judgements, the BZs, especially combined with an antidepressant, remain mainstays of pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders.", 
    "70": "Here, we investigated the binding characteristics of [3H]N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide ([3H]DAA1106), a potent and selective ligand for peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, in mitochondrial fractions of the rat brain. [3H]DAA1106 bound to the mitochondrial fraction of the rat brain in a saturable manner. The dissociation constant (Kd) and maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) obtained from Scatchard plot analysis of the saturation curve of [3H]DAA1106 binding were 0.12 +/- 0.03 nM and 161.03 +/- 5.80 fmol/mg protein, respectively. [3H]DAA1106 binding to mitochondrial preparations of the rat cerebral cortex was inhibited by several peripheral benzodiapine receptor ligands, and DAA1106 was the most potent inhibitor in inhibiting [3H]DAA1106 binding among the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands we tested. The binding of [3H]DAA1106 was not affected by several neurotransmitter-related compounds, including adrenoceptor, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), acetylcholine, histamine, glutamate and central benzodiazepine receptor ligands even at a concentration of 10 microM. In the cerebral cortex of rhesus monkeys, DAA1106 and 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide (PK11195) potently inhibited [3H]DAA1106 binding, while 7-chloro-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-methyl-1,3-dihydrobenzo[e][1,4]diazepin -2-one (Ro5-4864) did not. The highest [3H]DAA1106 binding was observed in the olfactory bulb, followed by the cerebellum. In autoradiographic studies, practically the same results were obtained, in that the highest binding of [3H]DAA1106 was in the olfactory bulb. Potent labeling was also noted in ventricular structures such as the choroid plexus. Thus, [3H]DAA1106 is a potent and selective ligand for peripheral benzodiazepine receptors and should prove useful for elucidating the physiological relevance of events mediated through peripheral benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "71": "Both repeated stress and corticosterone administration induce remodeling of apical dendrites of hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons. Circulating glucocorticoids are involved in the mechanism that produces atrophy, along with excitatory amino acids and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT). We used 5-HT-related antidepressants and a benzodiazepine in order to explore indirectly the role of serotonin and GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptors in the stress-induced structural changes visualized by the Golgi impregnation of the rat hippocampus. The 5-HT reuptake enhancer (+/-)-tianeptine prevented the dendritic atrophy caused by repeated restraint stress in a non-stereoselective fashion and two 5-HT reuptake antagonists, fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, failed to block dendritic atrophy. Tianeptine also functions as a therapeutic tool since it reversed the already established hippocampal atrophy caused by treatment with corticosterone for 3 weeks. Finally, the benzodiazepine agonist adinazolam was effective in preventing the stress-induced dendritic atrophy. These findings suggest that the synaptic availability of 5-HT is involved in the mechanism leading to stress-induced dendritic remodeling and supports the idea that the hippocampal inhibitory GABAergic tone may play a regulatory role.", 
    "72": "The anticonvulsant drug Diazepam (DIA-2 mg/kg b. wt), the nitric oxide (NO) donor L-Arginine (L-Arg-2000 mg/kg b. wt) and the putative nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor N(G)-Nitro-L-Arginine methyl ester (L-NAME-50 mg/kg b. wt) were used to determine the role of endogenous NO on convulsions induced by picrotoxin (PCT-5 mg/kg b. wt) in rats. Rats given a convulsant dose of PCT (5 mg/kg b. wt) had convulsion and it suppresses the NOS activity and NO concentration in brain regions. The anticonvulsant L-Arg alone significantly increases the NO concentration and NOS activity in brain regions, but not diazepam. Whereas DIA, along with L-Arg, enhances the NO and NOS activity when compared to L-Arg alone. The combination of both OIA and L-Arg completely suppressed the convulsions. L-NAME alone had no effect to produce convulsions but it completely decreased NO concentration and NOS activity and potentiated the PCT convulsions. This was reverted by pre- and post treatment of DIA plus L-Arg indicating, the increased NO concentration and NOS activity in brain regions suppresses convulsions.", 
    "73": "Different groups of pregnant rats were treated with diazepam (10 mg/kg), phenobarbital (10 mg/kg), haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg), fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) and vehicle (normal saline) intraperitoneally once a day during gestation days 13 to 21. After birth these pups were culled to 8 pups/dam and foster-nursed by lactating mothers for 3 weeks and were reared in colony cages thereafter. Sex and weight matched pairs of rat offsprings were subjected to foot shock induced aggression test at 8 weeks of age. Two parameters of aggressive behaviour were recorded namely, the latency to fight and total number of fighting bouts. The results indicate that prenatal exposure to diazepam, phenobarbital, haloperidol and fluoxetine caused significantly enhanced aggression in terms of number of fighting bouts.", 
    "74": "This paper reports results of the research of genotoxic effects of anxiolitic benzodiazepine diazepam in the culture of lymphocytes of human periphery blood. It has been found out that diazepam reduces lymphocytes mitotic activity, causes numeric chromosomal aberrations (mostly hypodiploidy), and shows cytotoxic reactions. Frequency and expressiveness of perceived effects are in correlation with the intensity of concentrations tested.", 
    "75": "During routine deep sedation for endodontic therapy, a dentist-anesthesiologist observed premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) on a 62-yr-old woman's electrocardiogram (EKG) tracing. The dentist was able to complete the root canal procedure under intravenous (i.v.) sedation without any problems. The dentist-anesthesiologist referred the patient for medical evaluation. She was found to be free from ischemic cardiac disease with normal ventricular function. The patient was cleared to continue her dental treatment with deep sedation. She subsequently continued to undergo dental treatment with deep intravenous sedation without incident, although her EKG exhibited frequent PVCs, up to 20 per minute, including couplets and episodes of trigeminy. This article will review indications for medical intervention, antiarrhythmic medications, and anesthetic interventions for perioperative PVCs.", 
    "76": "We report three consecutive patients with hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS) due to phenytoin and carbamazepine and successful treatment with gabapentin. HSS is a rare but potentially fatal reaction to multiple drugs including several anticonvulsants. Cross-reactivity among drugs may occur. Immediate withdrawal of the offending drug is the most important step in treatment. Benzodiazepines acutely and, after resolution of the hepatitis, valproic acid have been successfully used for seizure control in patients with HSS. Our cases indicate that gabapentin is also a safe anticonvulsant in HSS.", 
    "77": "SPECT is a noninvasive functional neuroimaging method widely used even in child neurology because it can be easily implemented in routine clinical studies. Normal brain perfusion SPECT images in children change with brain maturation and differ from those in adults; for example, the blood flow is lower in the cerebellum than in the cerebrum. New methods have been developed to measure the cerebral blood flow without blood sampling and to perform statistical parametric mapping after spatial normalization of SPECT images to standard brain. They are applied to functional disorders such as autism and learning disorders. Neurotransmission imagings using SPECT are also available to visualize the benzodiazepine and dopamine systems; an early application of insurance is expected.", 
    "78": "Although midazolam has been proposed for the treatment of a variety of conditions such as anxiety, dyspnoea, hiccups and status epilepticus, terminal agitation is the only condition where its use is based on a reasonably large number of published clinical studies. A causal approach is generally recommended. Whenever possible, the aetiological condition (pain, fever, constipation, etc.) should be corrected. Such general measures as ensuring a peaceful, familiar environment, and the use of a night light, fluid therapy to counteract dehydration, and antipyretics for fever are beneficial. When symptomatic treatment is needed, drugs with little anticholinergic effect are to be recommended. The use of benzodiazepines as single drug treatment may exacerbate the condition. Haloperidol or risperidone (which has fewer side effects) are recommended. If the agitation is marked, a common strategy is to add lorazepam. Chlormethiazole is an alternative. Subcutaneous midazolam should be reserved for refractory cases. Attention should be paid to dosage, reduced doses being given to the elderly, patients on opioid medication, and patients with impaired liver or renal function. Overdosage may induce deep sedation, and result in carbon dioxide retention and subsequently heart failure and pulmonary oedema which may be fatal.", 
    "79": "Several A-ring-modified analogues of the DNA-binding antitumor agent DC-81 (5) have been synthesized in order to study structure-reactivity/cytotoxicity relationships. For two molecules (23 and 30) the modifications required the addition of a fourth ring to give the novel dioxolo[4,5-h]- and dioxano[5,6-h]pyrrolo[2,1-c][1, 4]benzodiazepin-11-one (PBD) ring systems, respectively. Another three analogues (34, 38, and 48) have the native benzenoid A-ring replaced with pyridine, diazine, or pyrimidine rings to give the novel pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]pyridodiazepine, pyrrolo[2,1-c][1, 4]diazinodiazepine, and pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]pyrimidinodiazepine systems, respectively. The other new analogues (16a,b) have extended chains at the C8-position of the DC-81 structure. During the synthesis of these compounds, a novel tin-mediated regiospecific cleavage reaction of the dioxole intermediate 18 was discovered, leading to the previously unknown iso-DC-81 (20). In addition, an unusual simultaneous nitration-oxidation reaction of 4-(3-hydroxypropoxy)-3-methoxybenzoic acid (8) was found to produce 3-(4-carboxy-2-methoxy-5-nitrophenoxy)propanoic acid (9), a key intermediate, in high yield. In general, the results of cytotoxicity and DNA-binding studies indicated that none of the changes made to the A-ring of the PBD system significantly improved either binding affinity or cytotoxicity in comparison to DC-81. This result suggests that the superior potency of natural products such as anthramycin (1), tomaymycin (2), and sibiromycin (3) is due entirely to differences in C-ring structure, and in particular exo or endo unsaturation at the C2-position and C2-substituents containing unsaturation. This study also provided information regarding the influence of A-ring substitution pattern on the relative stability of the interconvertible N10-C11 carbinolamine, carbinolamine methyl ether, and imine forms of PBDs.", 
    "80": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is a protein of mitochondrial outer membranes utilizing porphyrins as endogenous ligands. PBR is part of a heteromeric receptor complex involved in the formation of mitochondrial permeability transition pores and in the early events of apoptosis. PBR may function as an oxygen-dependent signal generator; recent data indicate that these receptors may preserve the mitochondria of haematopoietic cell lines from damage caused by oxygen radicals. To identify PBRs in human skin, we used a specific monoclonal antibody directed against the C-terminus fragment of the human receptor. PBR immunoreactivity was found in keratinocytes, Langerhans cells, hair follicles and dermal vascular endothelial cells. Interestingly, confocal microscopic examination of skin sections revealed that PBR expression was strongly upregulated in the superficial differentiated layers of the epidermis. Ultrastructurally, PBRs were distributed throughout the cytoplasm but were selectively expressed on the mitochondrial membranes of epidermal cells. The elevated level of PBRs in the spinous layer was not associated with an increased number of mitochondria nor with an increased amount of mRNA as assessed by in situ hybridization on microautoradiographed skin sections. The present work provides, for the first time, evidence of PBR immunoreactivity in human skin. This mitochondrial receptor may modulate apoptosis in the epidermis; its increased expression in differentiated epidermal layers may represent a novel mechanism of natural skin protection against free radical damage generated by ultraviolet exposure.", 
    "81": "The amount of enzymes stored in individual zymogen granules and the glycosylation of their membrane have been analysed in rats with acute pancreatitis induced by caerulein after hydrocortisone treatment. The consequences of prolonging hydrocortisone administration after pancreatitis and the use of the cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist, L-364,718, have also been evaluated.", 
    "82": "Analysis was performed using flow cytometry.", 
    "83": "Caerulein-induced pancreatitis in rats previously treated for 7 days with hydrocortisone (10 mg kg-1 per day) revealed alterations in enzyme storage in the pancreas. Significant increases in amylase and trypsinogen contents in zymogen granules were observed, an effect associated with a reduction in L-fucose glycoconjugates. Pancreatitis persists 7 days later if hydrocortisone treatment is prolonged. At this stage, a reduced granule fucosylation was still observed, and a significant decrease in the amount of trypsinogen stored in the granules was found. However, hydrocortisone administration led to an increase in intragranular amylase quantities up to normal values, even when L-364,718 was simultaneously administered, but it reverted to plasma as a consequence of pancreatitis. The amount of N-acetyl D-glucosamine in the zymogen granule membrane was not altered by caerulein acute pancreatitis induced under continuous hydrocortisone treatment, but it was decreased by the administration of L-364,718 over 7 days after pancreatitis induction.", 
    "84": "The administration of hydrocortisone after the development of pancreatitis prevented recurrence of the disease. L-364,718 proved to be detrimental, not only failing to reduce the symptoms of pancreatitis but also altering the glycoproteins of zymogen granule membrane.", 
    "85": "Simple febrile seizures that occur in children ages 6 months to 5 years are common events with few adverse outcomes. Those who advocate therapy for this disorder have been concerned that such seizures lead to additional febrile seizures, to epilepsy, and perhaps even to brain injury. Moreover, they note the potential for such seizures to cause parental anxiety. We examined the literature to determine whether there was demonstrable benefit to the treatment of simple febrile seizures and whether such benefits exceeded the potential side effects and risks of therapy. The therapeutic approaches considered included continuous anticonvulsant therapies, intermittent therapy, or no anticonvulsant therapy.", 
    "86": "This analysis focused on the neurologically healthy child between 6 months and 5 years of age whose seizure is brief (<15 minutes), generalized, and occurs only once during a 24-hour period during a fever. Children whose seizures are attributable to a central nervous system infection and those who have had a previous afebrile seizure or central nervous system abnormality were excluded. A review of the current literature was conducted using articles obtained through searches in MEDLINE and additional databases. Articles were obtained following defined criteria and data abstracted using a standardized literature review form. Abstracted data were summarized into evidence tables (Tables 1 through 7).", 
    "87": "Epidemiologic studies demonstrate a high risk of recurrent febrile seizures but a low, though increased, risk of epilepsy. Other adverse outcomes either don't occur or occur so infrequently that their presence is not convincingly demonstrated by the available studies. Although daily anticonvulsant therapy with phenobarbital or valproic acid is effective in decreasing recurrent febrile seizures, the risks and potential side effects of these medications outweigh this benefit. No medication has been shown to prevent the future onset of recurrent afebrile seizures (epilepsy). The use of intermittent diazepam with fever after an initial febrile seizure is likely to decrease the risk of another febrile seizure, but the rate of side effects is high although most families find the perceived benefits to be low. Although antipyretic therapy has other benefits, it does not prevent additional simple febrile seizures.", 
    "88": "The Febrile Seizures Subcommittee of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Quality Improvement used the results of this analysis to derive evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of simple febrile seizures. The outcomes anticipated as a result of the analysis and development of the practice guideline include: 1) to optimize practitioner understanding of the scientific basis for using or avoiding various proposed treatments for children with simple febrile seizures; 2) to improve the health of children with simple febrile seizures by avoiding therapies with high potential for side effects and no demonstrated ability to improve children's eventual outcomes; 3) to reduce costs by avoiding therapies that will not demonstrably improve children's long-term outcomes; and 4) to help the practitioner educate caregivers about the low risks associated with simple febrile seizures.", 
    "89": "Diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) and its fragment, octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), are putative endogenous ligands for benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors and have been shown to act as an inverse BZD receptor agonist in the brain. A previous study suggested that the social isolation stress-induced decrease in pentobarbital sleep in mice was partly due to endogenous substances with an inverse BZD receptor agonist-like property. In this study, we examined the effects of DBI and ODN on pentobarbital sleep in group-housed and socially isolated mice to test the possible involvement of DBI and ODN in a social isolation-induced decrease in pentobarbital sleep. The socially isolated mice showed significantly shorter durations of pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, i. p.) sleep compared to the group-housed animals. When injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.), DBI and ODN (3 and 10 nmol) dose-dependently shortened the pentobarbital-induced sleeping time in group-housed mice at the same dose range, but these peptides had no effect on the sleeping time in socially isolated animals. In contrast, flumazenil (16.5-33 nmol, i.c.v.), a BZD receptor antagonist, reversed the pentobarbital sleeping time in socially isolated mice to the level of group-housed animals without affecting the sleeping time in group-housed animals. The effects of DBI and ODN in group-housed mice were significantly blocked by flumazenil (33 nmol, i.c.v.). Moreover, the effect of flumazenil in socially isolated mice was significantly attenuated by DBI and ODN (10 nmol, i.c.v.). These results suggest that the changes in the activity of DBI and/or ODN are partly involved in the social isolation-induced decrease in the hypnotic action of pentobarbital in mice.", 
    "90": "Clinical studies of cholinergic pharmacotherapy, together with the putative role of the muscarinic receptor system in the neurophysiology of human behavior, support a possible muscarinic cholinergic involvement in schizophrenia. The present study has measured the density of [3H]AF-DX 384 labelled receptors (muscarinic M2 and M4) in the caudate-putamen, obtained at autopsy, from 19 subjects who had schizophrenia, and 20 subjects who did not have schizophrenia. [3H]AF-DX 384 binding was reduced in caudate-putamen from schizophrenic subjects (104 +/- 10.3 vs 145 +/- 901 fmol mg(-1) TE; mean +/- s.e.; p = 0.007). Preliminary analysis of patient drug data as well as rat studies suggest that the reduced [3H]AF-DX 384 binding in caudate-putamen of schizophrenic subjects is not wholly due to antipsychotic drug treatment, or anticholinergic medication for the treatment of extrapyramidal effects. These data suggest that the muscarinic cholinergic system may be involved in the pathology of schizophrenia.", 
    "91": "This experiment was designed to assess the role of the septo-hippocampal cholinergic (ACh) system in the deleterious effects produced by systemic benzodiazepine injection on learning processes in rats. Retention of a step through passive avoidance task was analysed after systemic injection of increasing doses of either scopolamine or diazepam applied alone 30 min before the acquisition phase. Results indicated a dose related impairment of retention by each drug: in addition, sub-threshold doses of scopolamine and diazepam applied in combination (diazepam: 2mg/kg plus scopolamine: 0.3mg/kg) produced a decrease of retention latencies, thus showing an additive effect of the combined treatment. Secondly, a sub-threshold dose of scopolamine (15microg/0.5microl) was also administered into the medial septal area, together with an i.p. injection of 2mg/kg of diazepam. This combined treatment produced a severe impairment of retention, in parallel with a large reduction in emotionality (number of faeces). The data are consistent with the hypothesis that peripheral administration of behaviorally effective doses of diazepam on passive avoidance learning might act partially via a septal ACh-GABA/benzodiazepine mechanism. It is also suggested that this mechanism subserves both anxiety and the memorisation of contextual stimuli associated with passive avoidance acquisition, through the modification of the septo-hippocampal activity.", 
    "92": "The molecular mode of action of lonidamine, a therapeutic agent employed in cancer chemotherapy, has been elusive. Here we provide evidence that lonidamine (LND) acts on mitochondria to induce apoptosis. LND provokes a disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential which precedes signs of nuclear apoptosis and cytolysis. The mitochondrial and cytocidal effects of LND are not prevented by inhibitors of caspases or of mRNA or protein synthesis. However, they are prevented by transfection-enforced overexpression of Bcl-2, an oncoprotein which inhibits apoptosis by stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane barrier function. Accordingly, the cell death-inducing effect of LND is amplified by simultaneous addition of PK11195, an isoquinoline ligand of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor which antagonizes the cytoprotective effect of Bcl-2. When added to isolated nuclei, LND fails to provoke DNA degradation unless mitochondria are added simultaneously. In isolated mitochondria, LND causes the dissipation of the mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential and the release of apoptogenic factors capable of inducing nuclear apoptosis in vitro. Thus the mitochondrion is the subcellular target of LND. All effects of LND on isolated mitochondria are counteracted by cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial PT pore. We therefore tested the effect of LND on the purified PT pore reconstituted into liposomes. LND permeabilizes liposomal membranes containing the PT pore. This effect is prevented by addition of recombinant Bcl-2 protein but not by a mutant Bcl-2 protein that has lost its apoptosis-inhibitory function. Altogether these data indicate that LND represents a novel type of anti-cancer agent which induces apoptosis via a direct effect on the mitochondrial PT pore.", 
    "93": "In the present study, we assessed the effects of the potent benzodiazepine alprazolam on the human acoustic startle response in healthy volunteers. Eight undergraduate students received single oral doses of placebo and alprazolam 2 mg on 2 separate days, according to a double-blind balanced crossover design. Electromyographic activity of the orbicularis oculi muscle was recorded 5, 7 and 11 h after drug administration. At each recording time, subjects received 21 acoustic stimuli (1 KHz, 116 dB, 50 ms duration) separated by variable intervals (8-30 s, mean 16.5 s). Consistent with previous results obtained for diazepam in humans, alprazolam significantly reduced the amplitude of the startle reflex. A patent increase in onset latency was also observed, this being a novel effect not previously described for benzodiazepines in human studies. Both effects were maximum at 5 h after dosing, the startle response experiencing a recovery as the drug disappeared from systemic circulation. These results indicate a potent inhibitory effect of alprazolam on baseline startle at the dose used, with a robust time-dependent recovery of initial values effectively counteracting between-session habituation.", 
    "94": "The effect of L-365,260, a CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonist, on gastric mucus metabolism induced by tetragastrin was investigated in rats. In vivo application of L-365,260 at a dose of 3 mg/kg p.o. significantly reduced the tetragastrin (12 microg/kg s.c. )-stimulated gastric acid secretion, but 0.3 mg/kg of L-365,260 did not affect the gastric acid secretion induced by the tetragastrin administration. A single administration of 12 microg/kg of tetragastrin caused an increase in gastric mucin content in the soluble mucus (175% of control), the mucus gel (155% of control) and the surface mucosa (125% of control). L-365,260 at the doses of 0.3 and 3 mg/kg considerably inhibited the tetragastrin-induced mucus secretion in the soluble mucus (70-80% of tetragastrin) and the mucus gel (45-70% of tetragastrin) and resumed the mucus accumulated in the surface mucosa to the control situation (80% of tetragastrin). In the in vitro incubation system of rat gastric mucosa, L-365,260 (0.1-10 micromol/l) caused no significant change in gastric mucin synthesis. An in vivo study also showed that the increase in total gastric mucin content and the distributional changes in mucin content induced by 12 microg/kg of tetragastrin reverted with 3 mg/kg of L-365,260 pretreatment to the control situation. It is evident from these results that the CCK-B/gastrin receptor is involved in the mechanism of the stimulation of mucus secretion and/or mucus accumulation in rat gastric mucosa and not directly concerned with the action of gastrin-induced gastric acid secretion.", 
    "95": "Apoptosis is accompanied by major changes in ion compartmentalization and transmembrane potentials. Thymocyte apoptosis is characterized by an early dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, with transient mitochondrial swelling and a subsequent loss of plasma membrane potential (DeltaP sip) related to the loss of cytosolic K+, cellular shrinkage, and DNA fragmentation. Thus, a gross perturbation of DeltaPsip occurs at the postmitochondrial stage of apoptosis. Unexpectedly, we found that blockade of plasma membrane K+ channels by tetrapentylammonium (TPA), which leads to a DeltaP sip collapse, can prevent the thymocyte apoptosis induced by exposure to the glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone, the topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide, gamma-irradiation, or ceramide. The TPA-mediated protective effect extends to all features of apoptosis, including dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, loss of cytosolic K+, phosphatidylserine exposure on the cell surface, chromatin condensation, as well as caspase and endonuclease activation. In strict contrast, TPA is an ineffective inhibitor when cell death is induced by the potassium ionophore valinomycin, the specific mitochondrial benzodiazepine ligand PK11195, or by primary caspase activation by Fas/CD95 cross-linking. These results underline the importance of K+ channels for the regulation of some but not all pathways leading to thymocyte apoptosis.", 
    "96": "Global cerebral ischemia produces hippocampal CA1 neuronal loss which in turn leads to deficits in memory related tasks. Previous studies have shown that the benzodiazepine diazepam is effective at attenuating this cell death and the related behavioural impairments. However these studies have been confounded by diazepam-induced hypothermia. In this study we sought to determine the neuroprotective efficacy of diazepam in the absence of hypothermia. Diazepam (10 mg/kg) was administered to two groups of gerbils at 30 and 90 min following a 5-min ischemic insult. In one group the brain temperature was monitored for 24 h post-ischemically but not regulated. In the second group, post-ischemic brain temperature was maintained at 36.5 degrees C to counteract the hypothermia produced by diazepam. Both behaviour (open field performance) and CA1 cell counts from these groups were compared to those from sham/normal, no drug ischemic and vehicle ischemic groups at 10 days survival. In animals treated with diazepam without temperature regulation, there was significant histological and behavioural protection at 10 days compared to untreated ischemic animals. Preventing hypothermia in diazepam-treated animals resulted in a decrease in the number of cells surviving (from 41.2 to 31.6% of sham) and abolished behavioural protection. Diazepam appears to have limited ability to attenuate neuronal loss and its neuroprotective efficacy is augmented by the concurrent hypothermic actions of the drug itself.", 
    "97": "GABA-ergic medications may have a potential role in the treatment of schizophrenia. Laboratory evidence has generally supported the ability of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to reduce dopaminergic activity and has suggested that GABA may be effective in combating hypofrontality by acting on mesoprefrontocortical tracts in patients resistant to treatment with antipsychotic drugs. Although the results of clinical trials of several GABA-ergic compounds have been inconclusive because of methodologic limitations and drug toxicity, benzodiazepines and valproate seem to be associated with favorable treatment outcomes, especially when combined with typical antipsychotic agents. This study concludes that further investigation of the use of GABA in schizophrenia is likely to improve the understanding of the psychopathology of this illness and to expand our treatment alternatives. Also provided are suggestions to enhance the design of future studies, improve the potential for favorable treatment outcomes, and assist in predicting patients' responses to GABA-ergic medications.", 
    "98": "Flunitrazepam (FNZ) is a benzodiazepine derivative more potent than diazepam. FNZ abuse in the US has emerged in the last few years and has a growing popularity among young people and drug abusing populations. Ethanol (EtOH) consumption with FNZ enhances euphoria and onset of action. It is postulated that FNZ and EtOH cause liver cell injury. In this study, hepatocytes are employed to study the hepatotoxicity of FNZ, EtOH and their combination (FNZ-EtOH). Hepatocytes (2x10(6) cells/ml) isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to saline, FNZ, EtOH or FNZ-EtOH in combination. The uptake of 0.4% trypan blue and the leakage of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) enzymes into the incubation media were used to assess cell membrane damage of hepatocytes. Where metabolism of FNZ is nearly complete through several hepatic pathways, animal pretreatment with Phenobarbital was used to study the effect of microsomal enzyme induction on cellular injury. FNZ (0.16mm), EtOH (32.56mm) or their combination caused a significant (P<0.05) decrease in cell viability. Compared with control, FNZ and FNZ-EtOH in combination caused significant AST leakage over the 2-hour incubation period. EtOH alone caused significant AST leakage after 2 hours of incubation. The leakage of ALT enzyme was significant for FNZ, EtOH and FNZ-EtOH over the 2-hour incubation period. While FNZ alone did not produce any significant enzymatic leakage in the Phenobarbital pretreated groups, the leakage of ALT and AST were significant for FNZ-EtOH in combination as early as 30 minutes of incubation. A significant depletion (P<0.05) of glutathione (GSH) was observed for EtOH and FNZ-EtOH in combination treated samples. This investigation suggests that FNZ and EtOH cause hepatotoxicity, and their combinations have an additive effect in increasing liver toxicity. Induction of microsomal enzymes revealed that FNZ is more hepatotoxic than the metabolites. And FNZ alone has no effect on GSH content.", 
    "99": "Late-onset drinking is a common problem in elderly people related to stress induced by social isolation. Experiments were performed in order to evaluate the effects of alprazolam, a benzodiazepine agonist anxiolytic, on the free-choice ethanol consumption in aged rats subjected to isolation stress. The animals we offered a two-bottle choice consumption (one of 0.2% saccharin and the other with 10% ethanol/0.2% saccharin) and then exposed to 4 days of isolation stress on an irregular, unpredictable schedule. Stress resulted in significant increase in ethanol consumption. Treatment with alprazolam (1 mg/Kg) partially reversed this adverse effect of stress.", 
    "100": "Sedation regimens for head-injured patients are quite variable. The short-acting sedative-anesthetic agent propofol is being increasingly used in such patients, yet little is known regarding its safety and efficacy. In this multicenter double-blind trial, a titratable infusion of 2% propofol accompanied by low-dose morphine for analgesia was compared with a regimen of morphine sulfate in intubated head-injured patients. In both groups, other standard measures of controlling intracranial pressure (ICP) were also used.", 
    "101": "Forty-two patients from 11 centers were evaluated to assess both the safety and efficacy of propofol: 23 patients in the propofol group (mean time of propofol usage 95+/-87 hours) and 19 patients in the morphine group (mean time of morphine usage 70+/-54 hours). There was a higher incidence of poor prognostic indicators in the propofol group than in the morphine group: patient age older than 55 years (30.4% compared with 10.5%, p < 0.05), initial Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 3 to 5 (39.1% compared with 15.8%, p < 0.05), compressed or absent cisterns on initial computerized tomography scanning (78.3% compared with 57.9%, p < 0.05), early hypotension and/or hypoxia (26.1% compared with 10.5%, p = 0.07). During treatment there was a trend toward greater use of vasopressors in the propofol group. However, the mean daily ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure were generally similar between groups and, on therapy Day 3, ICP was lower in the propofol group compared with the morphine group (p < 0.05). Additionally, there was less use of neuromuscular blocking agents, benzodiazepines, pentobarbital, and cerebrospinal fluid drainage in the propofol group (p < 0.05). At 6 months postinjury, a favorable outcome (good recovery or moderate disability) was observed in 52.1% of patients receiving propofol and in 47.4% receiving morphine; the mortality rates were 17.4% and 21.1%, respectively. Patients who received the highest doses of propofol for the longest duration tended to have the best outcomes. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of adverse events.", 
    "102": "Despite a higher incidence of poor prognostic indicators in the propofol group, ICP therapy was less intensive, ICP was lower on therapy Day 3, and long-term outcome was similar to that of the morphine group. These results suggest that a propofol-based sedation and an ICP control regimen is a safe, acceptable, and, possibly, desirable alternative to an opiate-based sedation regimen in intubated head-injured patients.", 
    "103": "Organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents are still used as warfare and terrorism compounds. Classical delayed treatment of victims of organophosphate poisoning includes combined i.v. administration of a cholinesterase reactivator (an oxime), a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist (atropine) and a benzodiazepine anticonvulsant (diazepam). The objective of this study was to evaluate, in a realistic setting, the therapeutic benefit of administration of GK-11 (gacyclidine), an antiglutamatergic compound, as a complement to the above therapy against organophosphate poisoning. Gacyclidine was injected (i.v.) in combination with atropine/diazepam/pralidoxime at man-equivalent doses after a 45- or 30-min latency period to intoxicated primates (2 LD50). The effects of gacyclidine on the animals' survival, electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, signs of toxicity, recovery after challenge and central nervous system histology were examined. The present data demonstrated that atropine/diazepam/pralidoxime alone or combined with gacyclidine did not prevent signs of soman toxicity when treatment was delayed 45 min after poisoning. Atropine/diazepam/pralidoxime also did not control seizures or prevent neuropathology in primates exhibiting severe signs of poisoning when treatment was commenced 30 min after intoxication. However, in this latter case, EEG recordings revealed that additional treatment with gacyclidine was able to stop soman-induced seizures and restore normal EEG activity. This drug also totally prevented the neuropathology observed 5 weeks after soman exposure in animals treated with atropine/diazepam/pralidoxime alone. Overall, in the case of severe OP-poisoning, gacyclidine represents a promising adjuvant therapy to the currently available polymedication to ensure optimal management of organophosphate poisoning in man. This drug is presently being evaluated in a human clinical trial for a different neuroprotective indication. However, it should always be kept in mind that, in the case of severe OP-poisoning, medical intervention must be conducted as early as possible.", 
    "104": "The results of a recently completed study demonstrated that postmenopausal women were more sensitive to triazolam-induced psychomotor performance impairment when progesterone was administered concomitantly. That clinical evidence agrees with the emerging in vitro information regarding the rapid membrane effects of a progesterone metabolite that positively modulates the gamma-aminobutyric acid-A-benzodiazepine receptor complex. The objective of this study in premenopausal women was to determine whether the response to a benzodiazepine is altered when endogenous progesterone concentrations are high (luteal phases of a menstrual cycle) compared with when progesterone concentrations are low (follicular phases of a menstrual cycle). The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral alprazolam were evaluated in twelve healthy, normally menstruating women who were not receiving oral contraceptive agents. On two separate occasions, once during each phase of the menstrual cycle, the women randomly received an oral alprazolam 2-mg dose. Blood samples were collected, and psychomotor performance tests were conducted at selected times before and after dosing. These data show that fluctuations of endogenous progesterone across the menstrual cycle do not influence alprazolam pharmacodynamics. Despite endogenous progesterone concentrations being significantly higher during the midluteal than during the midfollicular drug administrations, no differences were observed in either the digit-symbol substitution test, card sorting by suit, or sedation scores on these two occasions. No pharmacokinetic differences were observed between the two menstrual cycle-phase drug administrations. In conclusion, the lack of changes during the menstrual cycle in demonstrable cognitive impairment and pharmacokinetics after alprazolam administration is reassuring. This implies that a dose adjustment made on the basis of menstrual timing is not required.", 
    "105": "To study the partitioning of model acids ((RS)-warfarin and salicylic acid), and bases (lidocaine, (RS)-propranolol and diazepam), with immobilized artificial membrane (IAM)-HPLC, as compared to partitioning in the standardized phosphatidylcholine liposome/buffer system.", 
    "106": "The pH-dependent apparent partition coefficients D were calculated from capacity factors (k'IAM) obtained by IAM-HPLC, using a 11-carboxylundecylphosphocholine column. For lipophilic compounds k'IAM, values were determined with organic modifiers and extrapolation to 100% water phase (k'IAMw) was optimized. Temperature dependence was explored (23 to 45 degrees C), and Gibbs free energy (deltaG), partial molar enthalpy (deltaH) and change in entropy (deltaS) were calculated. Equilibrium dialysis was used for the partitioning studies with the liposome/buffer system.", 
    "107": "For extrapolation of k'IAMw, linear plots were obtained both with the respective dielectric constants and the mole fractions of the organic modifier. All tested compounds showed a similar pH-D diagram in both systems; however, significant differences were reproducibly found in the pH range of 5 to 8. In all cases, deltaG and deltaH were negative, whereas deltaS values were negative for acids and positive for bases.", 
    "108": "In both partitioning systems, D values decreased significantly with the change from the neutral to the charged ionization state of the solute. The differences found under physiological conditions, i.e. around pH 7.4, were attributed to nonspecific interactions of the drug with the silica surface of the IAM column.", 
    "109": "Barbiturates can produce psychological and physical dependence and produce a withdrawal syndrome on the second to fourth day after the drug is suspended. Symptoms include anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, rhythmic intention tremor, dizziness, seizures, and psychosis. If the syndrome is not recognized and correctly treated, hyperthermia, circulatory failure, and death may ensue. Although barbiturates are less frequently used nowadays, they are employed in combination with other drugs in many medications used for the treatment of headache. We report the case of a 54-year-old woman who developed a barbiturate abstinence syndrome when she suspended self-administration of a drug containing butalbital. The patient had been using barbiturates, 900 mg/die, for 2+ years for persistent headache. She was admitted to the hospital because of seizures, hallucinations and delirium not controlled by benzodiazepine and phenothiazine administration. Her symptoms resolved after parenteral phenobarbital administration.", 
    "110": "Microautoradiography was employed to show that association of drugs from the serum directly with forming hair pigment is a primary pathway of deposition into the hair. After systemic administration of [3H]flunitrazepam, [3H]nicotine, and [3H]cocaine, association of all three drugs with melanin in the forming hair was observed within minutes of dosage. Sebum was determined to be an insignificant deposition route for all three drugs. Pigmented mice had significantly higher concentrations of all three drugs than did nonpigmented mice. The results provide a better basis for ultimately using hair for reliable analysis of drug and environmental toxin exposure.", 
    "111": "A reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic-electrochemical assay was developed and validated for the quantification of olanzapine in human breast milk. The assay involved a solid-phase extraction (SPE) of olanzapine and its internal standard on a Bond Elut Certify LRC mixed-mode cartridge. After conditioning of the SPE cartridge, human milk (1 ml) was passed through the cartridge. The cartridge was washed with five separate washing steps to remove endogenous compounds, and the analytes were eluted with ethyl acetate-ammonium hydroxide (98:2, v/v) solution. The eluate was evaporated to dryness (gentle stream of nitrogen at 40 degrees C), and the residue was dissolved in mobile phase. The extract was injected onto a YMC basic column (150 mmx4.6 mm I.D., 5 microm particle size) at a flow-rate of 1 ml/min. A mixture of 75 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0-acetonitrile-methanol (48:26:26, v/v/v) was used as the mobile phase. Standard curves with a lower limit of quantitation of 0.25 ng/ml of olanzapine were linear (r2> or =0.9992) over a range of 0.25-100 ng/ml. Based on the analysis of quality control (QC) samples, the average inter-day accuracy (RE) was 99.0% with an average precision (CV) of 6.64% over the entire range. The stability of olanzapine in human milk was established after three freeze-thaw-heat cycles and storage at -70 degrees C for 10 months. The validated method was used to measure olanzapine concentrations in human milk during a clinical trial.", 
    "112": "Propiverine is a drug for the treatment of incontinence and pollakiuria. Such micturitional disorders are principally caused by a hyperactive bladder. The effects of propiverine, its active metabolite, 1-methyl-4-piperidyl benzilate N-oxide (DPr-P-4 (N-->O)), oxybutynin and terodiline on muscarinic receptors in guinea pig urinary bladder, salivary glands, cerebral cortex, ileal longitudinal muscle and heart were compared. Both propiverine and DPr-P-4 (N-->O) competitively inhibited specific binding of 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate (3H-QNB) to membrane fractions of these tissues. Oxybutynin, terodiline, pirenzepine and atropine also competitively inhibited the binding of 3H-QNB. The order of these drugs in terms of their affinity for muscarinic receptors was as follows: atropine > oxybutynin > pirenzepine, DPr-P-4 (N-->O), terodiline > propiverine. Propiverine and DPr-P-4 (N-->O) had no selectivity for muscarinic receptors in these tissues, the same as atropine. In contrast, pirenzepine, a M1-selective drug, had 10.1 times greater affinity for muscarinic receptors in the cerebral cortex than in urinary bladder, and the affinity of oxybutynin for muscarinic receptors in salivary glands and in cerebral cortex was 10.9 times and 13.9 times higher, respectively, than in urinary bladder. The affinity of terodiline for muscarinic receptors in the cerebral cortex was 4.4 times higher than in urinary bladder. In this study, the effect of propiverine and oxybutynin on pilocarpine (1 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced salivation in conscious dogs was also compared. Propiverine (5 mg/kg, i.v.) had no effect on pilocarpine-induced salivation, whereas oxybutynin (0.1 mg-0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) inhibited it significantly and dose-dependently. The ID50 values (95% confidence limits) for propiverine and oxybutynin during the 20 min after intravenous administration were 6.88 mg/kg (4.71-15.67) and 0.154 mg/kg (0.115-0.205), respectively. These findings suggest that although propiverine, its active metabolite DPr-P-4 (N-->O), oxybutynin and terodiline competitively inhibit the binding of 3H-QNB to muscarinic receptors, the affinity of these drugs for the muscarinic receptors of these tissues is very different and that propiverine has less effect on salivation than oxybutynin.", 
    "113": "When rats are exposed to unknown environments where novelty and fear-inducing characteristics are present (conflictive environments), some specific behaviors are induced and exploration is apparently modulated by fear. In our laboratory, a new type of plus-maze was designed as a model of conflictive exploration. The maze is composed of four arms with different geometrical characteristics, differing from each other by the presence or absence of walls. The degree of asymmetry was as follows: NW, no wall arm; SW, a single high wall present; HL, a low and a high wall present, and HH, two high walls present. The four arms were arranged at 90 degrees angles and the apparatus was called the elevated asymmetric plus-maze (APM). The purpose of the present study was to assess the behavioral profile of rats exposed for a single time to the APM with or without treatment with benzodiazepine. Increasing doses of diazepam were injected intraperitoneally in several groups of male, 90-day-old Holtzman rats. Distilled water was injected in control animals. Thirty minutes after treatment all rats were exposed singly to a 5-min test in the APM. Diazepam induced a biphasic modification of exploration in the NW and SW arms. The increase in the exploration score was evident at low doses of diazepam (0.25-1.0 mg/kg body weight) and the decrease in exploration was found with the higher doses of diazepam (2.0-3.0 mg/kg body weight). Non-exploratory behaviors (permanency) were not affected by benzodiazepine treatment. In the HL arm, exploration was not modified but permanency was increased in a dose-dependent manner. In the HH arm, exploration and permanency were not affected. Results are compatible with the idea that exploration-processing mechanisms in conflictive environments are modulated by fear-processing mechanisms of the brain.", 
    "114": "The difficulty for intensive care unit (ICU) patients to obtain frequent and extensive sleep has been well-documented. This project assessed the benefit of an algorithm of pharmacological assistance (lorazepam and methotrimeprazine) on sedation level and sleep duration in the ICU. The setting was a 15-bed closed ICU dealing with medical and surgical patients in a tertiary care, teaching hospital. Desired and actual levels of sedation for individual patients were determined hourly by the bedside nurse. Medications could be administered to facilitate achieving the desired level of sedation. Our results should no difference occurred in the achievement of the target sedation or duration of sleep with the implementation of the sedation algorithm. The amount of additional medication required during the night did change with the implementation of the sedation algorithm. A reduction in the amount of diazepam, morphine, and additional methotrimeprazine was noted. Efforts to change nursing practice will be required to improve the quality and quantity of sleep in ICU patients. This clinical evaluation demonstrates that the implementation of an algorithm for medication use is not effective alone in obtaining the desired level and duration of sleep in ICU patients. Nursing practice should continue to look at non-pharmacological factors, such as environmental noise, patient interruptions, and patient care practice to determine strategies in addition to medications which would aid the critically ill patient in achieving adequate sleep.", 
    "115": "GABAA receptors in cerebellar granule cells are unique in expressing a subtype containing the alpha6 subunit. This receptor subtype has high affinity for GABA and produces a degree of tonic inhibition on cerebellar granule cells, modulating the firing of these cells via spillover of GABA from GABAergic synapses. This receptor subtype also has selective affinity for the diuretic furosemide over receptors containing other alpha-subunits. Furosemide exhibits approximately 100-fold selectivity for alpha6-containing receptors over alpha1-containing receptors. By making alpha1/alpha6 chimeras we have identified a transmembrane region (209-279) responsible for the high furosemide sensitivity of alpha6beta3gamma2s receptors. Within the alpha1 transmembrane region, a single amino acid was identified that when mutated from threonine to isoleucine, increased furosemide sensitivity by 20-fold. We demonstrate the beta-subunit selectivity of furosemide to be due to asparagine 265 in the beta2 and beta3 transmembrane-domain II similar to that observed with potentiation by the anticonvulsant loreclezole. We also show that Ile in transmembrane-domain I accounts for the increased GABA sensitivity observed at alpha6beta3gamma2s compared with alpha1beta3gamma2s receptors, but did not affect direct activation by pentobarbital or potentiation by the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam. Location of these residues within transmembrane domains leads to speculation that they may be involved in the channel-gating mechanism conferring increased receptor activation by GABA, in addition to conferring furosemide sensitivity.", 
    "116": "Glucocorticoids in the hippocampus mediate adaptive responses elicited by stressful stimuli. In this study we investigated glucocorticoid receptor gene expression in the rat hippocampus following acute stress. A significant decrease in glucocorticoid receptor mRNA levels was observed in the hippocampus less than 1 h after the onset of stress. This decrease was inhibited by administering either MK-801, diazepam or propranolol prior to exposure to stress. The effect of diazepam on the stress-induced decrease in hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor mRNA was reversed by Ro-15-1788, suggesting that it is mediated by central benzodiazepine receptors, i.e. GABA-A. These results indicate that NMDA, GABA-A and beta-adrenergic receptors are involved in the mechanism of the stress-induced decrease in glucocorticoid receptor mRNA levels in the rat hippocampus.", 
    "117": "Many neurons express simultaneously two or more isotypes of glutamate receptors, so that pharmacological modulation of more than one receptor may be necessary to reveal the role of glutamate in mediating physiological processes. The present studies were aimed at evaluating involvement of endogenous glutamate in triggering plasma prolactin (PRL) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels in response to three different stress stimuli (footshock, immobilization and ether stress). Blockade of glutamate receptor subtypes was achieved by the administration of the NMDA antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801, 0.2 mg/kg) and the selective AMPA antagonist GYKI 52466 (10 mg/kg). Rats were pretreated for 4-5 days and then exposed to stressful stimulation. Basal hormone levels were not affected by the antagonists. In male rats, combined, but not separate blockade of NMDA and AMPA/kainate subtypes of glutamate receptors prevented the rise in plasma PRL in response to footshock stress. In female rats, footshock-induced PRL release was inhibited even by separate blockade of NMDA receptors by dizocilpine, suggesting that the PRL system of females is more sensitive to the effect of NMDA antagonists than that of males. None of the treatments affected PRL release during immobilization or ether stress. Simultaneous blockade of NMDA and AMPA receptor subtypes resulted in a mild inhibition of immobilization-induced ACTH release without any effect on ACTH response to footshock or ether stress. The data suggest that involvement of glutamatergic pathways in neuroendocrine response during stress is selective for discrete stress stimuli and stress hormones. In addition a concerted action of glutamate on both NMDA and non-NMDA receptor subtypes is involved in the control of PRL release during footshock stress.", 
    "118": "This report describes a case of alprazolam overdose associated with marked first-degree atrioventricular block reversed by flumazenil. Animal and human evidence suggests activity of certain benzodiazepines at peripheral benzodiazepine receptors in the myocardium and elsewhere. Myocardial benzodiazepine receptor ligands appear to affect calcium-channel activity, which may explain the clinical findings. Benzodiazepines may behave like weak calcium-channel blockers. This case raises the possibility of a potential role for flumazenil as an adjunct in the management of calcium-channel blocker toxicity.", 
    "119": "We report a child who concurrently developed polycythaemia, dystonia, and T1 shortening in the globus pallidus, medial cerebral peduncle and superior cerebellar peduncles on MRI. With spontaneous resolution of the polycythaemia after about 2 1/2 years, the dystonia and MRI abnormalities also resolved. Although the physiological cause of the T1 shortening is not known, this appears to be another cause of T1 shortening in the basal ganglia."
