    "0": "Therapeutical efforts in epilepsies with infantile spasms (IS) often show unsatisfying results, especially if neurological impairments are found. In a clearly negatively selected group of 24 children with IS and 10 patients with symptomatic myoclonic-astatic epilepsies--pretreated without success with ACTH and/or benzodiazepines (BDZ) alone or combined with other anticonvulsants--we tried a two-drug therapy of BDZ with carbamazepine (CBZ). Dosage of both drugs was within the usual range. In a follow-up period of 1-5 years, 8 of the IS patients and 4 of those with myoclonic-astatic seizures became seizure-free; furthermore, 6 children showed a marked reduction in their seizure frequency: 3 more than 80%, 3 more than 50%. Besides the fact that the patients did not develop a so-called escape-phenomenon--as often seen in therapy with benzodiazepines--they also showed fewer and less intensive side-effects. Without optioning for antiepileptic polytherapy in general, we conclude that in cases of \"intractable\" IS the combination of BDZ with CBZ might be more successful than the single drug. To confirm these preliminary findings further controlled studies have to be carried out.", 
    "1": "The photomyoclonic reflex (PMR), consisting of a one- or two-component blink reflex associated with the flash electroretinogram (ERG), is sensitive to the acute effect of intravenously administered diazepam. In the 29% (two of seven) of normal volunteers who had a PMR, diazepam reduced it to a nonobservable level. Diazepam also had a significant attenuating effect on the a- and b-waves of the ERG; the magnitude of attenuation in normal volunteers, however, probably would not alter a clinical diagnosis based on ERG. These two findings together predict that individuals known to have a marked PMR may have the diagnostic risk associated with these specious artifacts reduced by receiving diazepam before clinical ERG studies are begun.", 
    "2": "The brain content of Diazepam Binding Inhibitor (DBI), its cell location and that of its specific mRNA were studied immunohistochemically and by in situ hybridization. Various strains of rats were genetically selected for their alcohol tolerance and the above mentioned brain parameters were studied before and after chronic ethanol consumption. The DBI like immunoreactivity (DBI-LI) was found to be located in selected neuronal population and in non-neuronal cells. The DBI-mRNA was located in brain areas where DBI is abundant. It was immunochemically determined that the DBI content was increased in cerebellum and in hypothalamus of alcohol preferring rats after chronic ethanol consumption. DBI content was compared in the cerebellum of rats genetically selected for different alcohol sensitivity and it was significantly higher on the ethanol sensitive (ANT) rat strain.", 
    "3": "One should be able to mimic aspects of chronic stress using pharmacological stimulants administered continuously. Alcohol preference can be selectively increased by the continuous administration of two stimulants: D-amphetamine (which works well), and nicotine (which is extremely potent). This effect does not occur with continuous administration of a variety of other psychoactive compounds such as hallucinogens and tranquilizers, nor does it occur if stimulants are administered chronically but in an intermittent fashion. In order to obtain this effect, access to the alcohol must be withheld until an initial period of anorexia passes and a period of heightened orality develops. This heightened fluid intake effect appears to be selective for alcohol consumption, for it does not occur for other sources of calories or other novel tastes.", 
    "4": "Intrarectal administration of a premedication in children eliminates the stress due to intramuscular injection. Diazepam rectal administration induces clearly heavier sedation compared to its parenteral administration. The place of midazolam in this mode of premedication has yet to be determined.", 
    "5": "We compared midazolam with thiopental both in association with saline, fentanyl and fentanyl with droperidol for induction of anesthesia. Our data show that the administration of fentanyl or fentanyl and droperidol before midazolam improves the induction to reach almost the quality of a thiopental induction. No difference in cardiocirculatory effects between midazolam and thiopental was found.", 
    "6": "In regional anesthesia our experience shows that the association of small dose of fentanyl (20 mcg i.v.) and droperidol (1 mg i.v.) with a small dose of benzodiazepine i.v. injected 5' after provides a good sedation during surgery. The choice of the benzodiazepine is based on the duration of anesthesia: midazolam (1.5 or 3 mg i.v.) in anesthesia with a duration less or equal to 1 h 30'; flunitrazepam (0.2 mg or 0.4 mg i.v.) in anesthesia with a duration longer than 1 h 30'.", 
    "7": "Lorazepam was tried in a new formulation (FDDF) as premedication in twenty children, aged between 5-10 years. The study was performed in a double-blind fashion using lorazepam 1 mg and placebo in identical FDDF preparations. No significant differences were observed between the two treatment groups except for the recall of the venipuncture and awakening. Because of the lack of sedation observed the study was completed with an open trial on ten new subjects receiving 2 mg lorazepam FDDF. The quality of premedication was not found improved while more secretions were observed in the 2 mg lorazepam group. Recall of venipuncture and awakening was significantly less frequent in the 2 mg lorazepam group as compared to placebo. In both lorazepam groups awakening from anesthesia was prolonged. Side effects were reported in several patients receiving lorazepam. As lorazepam FDDF performed not better than a placebo as premedication for children its use is not recommended in pediatric anesthesia.", 
    "8": "The probability of ocular adverse reactions to systemic medication is low but when a reaction does occur it is often associated with one or more special factors relating to the condition being treated, to the patient, and to the nature of the drug itself. Nevertheless the role of the optometrist in the monitoring, detection and reporting of adverse reactions is important and is recognized by the College reporting scheme. A selection of the type of reactions that may be encountered in general optometric practice is reviewed. The reactions range from the relatively innocuous anticholinergic effects of the benzodiazepine tranquillizers to the more serious corneal, lens and retinal changes that may be associated with the corticosteroids, phenothiazines and chloroquine.", 
    "9": "In a double-blind fourfold crossover design, 11 subjects were randomly assigned to placebo, 10 mg diazepam, 75 mg amitriptyline, and 75 mg chlorpromazine. During a simple vigilance task, 12 midline and left hemisphere leads were recorded before and 3 h after drug administration. The EEG was quantified by spectrum analysis, the topographic structure displayed by brain mapping techniques, and the results compared with earlier studies which used the same design and drugs. Diazepam showed the expected increase in beta; however, fast beta was increased as much as slow beta. Amitriptyline showed an increase of slow wave power and a reduction of alpha. In contrast to earlier studies, a decrease of fast beta was found. In addition, the spatial pattern of alpha changed from an occipital to a parietal maximum. Chlorpromazine showed an increase in the theta band. In occipital regions, there was a small decrease of fast beta; however, centrally there was an increase of both slow and fast beta. These results were confirmed by a multivariate analysis of variance.", 
    "10": "Five normal volunteers received at a 2-week interval a single dose of sublingual or oral prazepam in double-blind and cross-over conditions. All subjects completed a battery of 15 visual analogue scales before drug intake and 7.5, 15, 22.5, 30, 45, 60, 90 min, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 24 h following intake whereas a computerized assessment of vigilance (reaction time) was performed before intake, 15, 30, 60 min, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10 h following intake. Subjects rated themselves significantly more feeble, clumsy, lethargic, and incompetent following sublingual as compared to oral prazepam while a trend in the same direction was noted for the adjectives muzzy and mentally slow. In contrast, reaction time did not exhibit significantly different changes over time between the two forms. These results suggest a subjectively more rapid onset of activity following sublingual compared to oral prazepam.", 
    "11": "A prospective, randomized study was performed in 87 patients to compare the safety, efficacy and dose requirements of two sedation techniques for stereotactic headframe application. Sedation administration and headframe application averaged 30 min. Fifty patients weighing 76 +/- 13 kg (mean +/- SD) received mean doses of 154 micrograms fentanyl plus 5.5 mg droperidol i.v. (FD group). An additional 37 patients weighing 76 +/- 19 kg received mean doses of 127 micrograms fentanyl plus 6.7 mg Valium (diazepam; FV group). Both treatments provided excellent hemodynamic stability and a low incidence of adverse side effects while providing adequate analgesia and sedation. The incidence of anesthetist-assessed patient anxiety and discomfort was more favorable in the FD group.", 
    "12": "Early discharge, defined as hospital leave 24-48 hours after birth, was introduced at Falun Hospital in 1984. 164 women interested in participating in an evaluative study of the program were randomly allocated in late pregnancy to an Experimental group (EG) offered early discharge, and a Control group (CG) offered the regular postpartum care in hospital. After medical and other withdrawals 24 h after the birth, 50 women remained in EG and 54 in CG. Infant morbidity and number of prescribed medicaments during the first 6 months after the birth were lower in EG than in CG, but the difference was not statistically significant. EG mothers made fewer visits to the Child Health Centre nurse than did CG mothers (p less than 0.05). No significant difference in puerperal complications was demonstrated, but the intake of sedatives by EG mothers was smaller than that of CG mothers during the first puerperal week (p less than 0.01).", 
    "13": "Clonidine attenuates opiate withdrawal syndrome, via reduction in catecholamine activity in the brain, most probably at the locus ceruleus. Clonidine and locus ceruleus lesions, in animals with alcohol dependency as with the opiates, modify alcohol withdrawal. Both alcohol loading and withdrawal from steady alcohol use alter catecholamines in man and animals. Clonidine's potential to treat alcoholics in withdrawal is reviewed. Several double blind studies showed clonidine, or similar analogues, to be somewhat superior to placebo in acute alcohol withdrawal. Major improvements were in pulse, blood pressure and composite alcohol withdrawal scores. Side effects were minor and mainly included mild sedation, or postural hypotension. In the only available published study clonidine compared reasonably well to a standard sedative in alcohol withdrawal, and greatly influential in plasma catecholamine levels. Other components of alcohol withdrawal, as seizures and hallucinations-delirium tremens have not been documented to change with clonidine. The alpha-2-adrenergic agonists in alcohol treatment seemed modestly effective for treatment of some parts of alcohol withdrawal. They represent a promising, novel, but still investigational approach. Additional data, particularly comparing them to the benzodiazepines, are needed before their potential in therapeutics can be assessed.", 
    "14": "Anaesthesia in birds is ordered by law and is also necessary for various operations and manipulations. Anaesthesia by injection of Ketamin, which in special cases may be combined with Diazepam, has been found useful. Anaesthesia by inhalation with Halothan, Methoxyfluran or Isofluran is the most careful method. Local anaesthesia has few indications.", 
    "15": "A randomized, double-blind, comparative trial of zopiclone versus nitrazepam was conducted in 74 geriatric chronic insomniac patients. Following a 7-day wash-out period, two parallel groups, successively received a placebo for 7 days, then either 7.5 mg zopiclone or 5 mg nitrazepam for another 7-day period. Efficacy on sleep was assessed by a sleep analogue scale and the Spiegel Sleep Questionnaire, residual effects by psychometric tests and tolerance by a standardized question, as well as by clinical and laboratory tests. Zopiclone and nitrazepam were more active than placebo on all tests of efficacy. In contrast with nitrazepam, zopiclone was devoid of effect on neurological function. In addition, the condition on awakening was better with zopiclone.", 
    "16": "The hypnotic effects of 7.5 mg zopiclone, as well as its unwanted and residual effects, were compared with those of 5 mg nitrazepam in a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel group study. After an initial, 7-day, placebo wash-out period, insomniac out-patients under the care of general practitioners received either 7.5 mg zopiclone or 5 mg nitrazepam for 6 weeks. Everyday, the patients filled in a diary (analogue scales for sleep parameters and condition during daytime); a sleep questionnaire was filled in at baseline and at the end of active treatment period; every 2 weeks, a somatic complaint check-list inventory and a mood rating scale were filled in and psychomotor tests performed; and at the end of the study, a global evaluation of efficacy and acceptability was given by the investigator. Clinical laboratory tests were performed before and after the active treatment period. From the diary, sleep onset latency, as well as sleep quality, were similarly improved by both drugs throughout the whole study. From the sleep questionnaire, all sleep parameters measured were improved at the end of the 6-week treatment period in both groups. No statistical differences in the various psychomotor tests were observed between the two treatment groups, and a significant improvement in the working ability of patients was noted with both drugs. Some significant differences were observed in the mood rating scale and the somatic complaint check list, probably related to differences in pharmacokinetics of the two drugs.", 
    "17": "The efficacy and tolerance of zopiclone were compared with nitrazepam and placebo in a multicenter double-blind parallel-group study in insomniac patients. Following a 7-day placebo washout period, 99 patients (age range 20 to 69 years) received oral capsules of 7.5 mg zopiclone or 5 mg nitrazepam or placebo for 2 weeks. During the fourth week all patients received placebo treatment. Sleep assessments by the patients showed that, compared with placebo, zopiclone and nitrazepam improved all sleep measures of efficacy from the first night and that effectiveness was maintained throughout treatment. The physicians global assessment of efficacy also favored zopiclone and nitrazepam over placebo treatment. Subjective morning drowsiness during treatment was significantly less for zopiclone than for either nitrazepam or placebo and represents a clear advantage for ambulatory patients. No rebound insomnia was evident during a 7 day post-treatment withdrawal period for either zopiclone or nitrazepam. Tolerance was good for all treatments.", 
    "18": "This single blind study aimed to discover possible effects of intramuscular premedication with midazolam on the sleep induced by intravenous flunitrazepam. 24 male patients, aged 17 to 71 years, who were to undergo surgery to the distal parts of an upper limb under regional anaesthesia, were randomly assigned to two equal groups: in the midazolam group, an intramuscular premedication of 0.12 mg.kg-1 midazolam with 0.5 mg atropine was given, whereas in the control group atropine only was used. In all patients, 1 mg flunitrazepam was given intravenously 45 min after the premedication, before carrying out regional anaesthesia. No other drug was given. In the midazolam group, the time of loss of spontaneous conversation was reduced (p less than 0.05), as well as the time of eye closure (p less than 0.001), and the time for recovery of the capacity to count backwards was increased (p less than 0.001). So, premedication with 0.12 mg.kg-1 midazolam intravenously 45 min before giving 1 mg flunitrazepam reinforced the sleep induced by the latter.", 
    "19": "The imidazopyridine zolpidem has previously been shown to displace benzodiazepines from their receptors, with a preferential activity at BZ1 sites, and to exert hypnotic activity in man. Zolpidem's pharmacological profile includes anticonvulsant, antipunishment and behavioral depressant actions. However, unlike benzodiazepines, zolpidem exerts sedative actions at relatively low doses. In drug discrimination experiments differences between the internal stimuli produced by chlordiazepoxide and zolpidem were identified. These differences appeared to be qualitative rather than quantitative with the stimulus properties of zolpidem being related to the drug's sedative action. In condition where tolerance developed rapidly to the depressant activity of benzodiazepines little tolerance was seen with zolpidem. The behavioral profile of consistent with the suggestion that this compound may have selective sedative action produced by activity at a sub-type of benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "20": "Modern anesthetic techniques have modified the aims of premedication in pediatric practice. Anxiolysis, amnesia and easiness of induction are now the the main targets. This paper reviews both the literature and the personal experience of the authors on the subject. Many authors now prefer a benzodiazepine. Rectal instillation of benzodiazepine in solution avoids the trauma of the intramuscular route and produces a faster and more predictable effect, than suppositories. Diazepam (.1 to .2 mg/kg) and flunitrazepam (40 to 80 micrograms/kg) have been extensively used in this indication. Diazepam's duration of elimination being much longer than that of flunitrazepam, this last drug is preferred by many pediatric anesthetists. Midazolam (.4 to .5 mg/kg) has a much faster onset and shorter duration of action. It should thus be preferred if the environment enables the administration of premedication within 10 to 15 minutes of induction.", 
    "21": "In commenting on the discovery of \"opiate\" receptors, Goldstein (1976) said: \"It seemed unlikely, a priori, that such highly stereospecific receptors should have been developed by nature to interact with alkaloids from the opium poppy\" (p. 1081). Endogenous opioid peptides and opioid receptor systems have now been identified in invertebrates that are unlikely to have had ancestors exposed to opium poppies (Kavaliers et al., 1983; Kream et al., 1980; Leung and Stefano, 1984; Stefano et al., 1980). Moreover, endogenous opioids play a role in stress-induced feeding in the slug (Kavaliers and Hirst, 1986) just as they play a role in stress-induced feeding in rodents (Lowy et al., 1980; Morley and Levine, 1980). If we are to understand the actions of opiates and other drugs of abuse we must understand them in terms of their abilities to interact with neural systems that evolved in the service of primitive biological functions, long before any serious incidence of addiction itself. The most primitive axes of the biological substrates of behavior are the axes of approach and withdrawal. Addictive drugs appear to be able to activate the mechanisms of approach, which is termed \"positive reinforcement\" and to inhibit the mechanisms of withdrawal, which is termed \"negative reinforcement.\" Anatomically distinct sets of pathways have evolved to serve these two forms of reward. Activation of the medial forebrain bundle and associated structures serves positive reinforcement and induces forward locomotion. Approach and forward locomotion are the unconditioned responses to positive reinforcing stimuli such as food and sex partners, and approach to environmental objects and positive reinforcement is induced by electrical stimulation of this structure. The locomotor stimulating effects and the positive reinforcing effects of opiates and psychomotor stimulants result from their activation of this mechanism; stimulants activate the mechanism at the level of dopaminergic synapses of the nucleus accumbens, frontal cortex, and perhaps other forebrain structures, while opiates activate the system at two points: at the level of the dopaminergic synapse and at the level of the afferents to the dopaminergic cell bodies. Ethanol, nicotine, caffeine and phencyclidine stimulate both locomotor activity and dopamine turnover, but their sites of interaction with reward pathways have not yet been identified. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates stimulate locomotor activity without stimulating dopamine turnover; they may interact with reward pathways at a synapse efferent to the dopaminergic link in the pathways.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "22": "A double-blind, controlled study with either 50 mg of pirenzepine or a placebo once a day was performed in 128 patients to determine the effect of pirenzepine against relapses of duodenal ulcer, the healing of the subjects' former ulcers having been confirmed endoscopically. The study lasted 12 months at longest; endoscopy was performed at 3,6,9 and 12 month intervals during the study, as well as when subjective symptoms developed. Cumulative non-relapse rates were obtained every 3 months according to the life expectancy table; at 3 and 6 months, they were 85.7% and 73.0% for the pirenzepine group and 67.9% and 49.0% for the placebo group, thus indicating significantly lower relapse rates in favour of the pirenzepine group (p less than 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to the 12-month cumulative non-relapse rate. Comparison of background factors in relapsed and non-relapsed cases suggested that relapses were more frequent among pirenzepine-treated patients who had required a shorter course of treatment or had received H2 antagonists in the treatment of their previous ulcer. Relapses of duodenal ulcer were closely correlated with relapses of subjective symptoms, but there was no significant difference between the pirenzepine group and the placebo group with regard to the frequency of subjective symptoms at the time of ulcer recurrence. Pirenzepine, like H2 antagonists, proved to prevent ulcer relapses temporarily. The relapse rate with the compound appeared to be higher in cases where the former ulcer had been treated with H2 antagonists.", 
    "23": "The focus of this paper is the treatment of panic disorder with alprazolam. Drug treatments alone are sometimes not sufficient by themselves, to adequately control all of the symptoms or components of this disorder. In the typical case we can identify four targets of treatment: The first target is the biological core of the condition, that is characterized by the unexpected, unprovoked attacks of anxiety. This responds best to medication. The second target is the phobic avoidance behaviour. It appears to be a conditioned or learned complication of the biological core, and appears to follow the laws of learning theory. Unlearning treatments, like behaviour therapy (notably in vivo exposure) are usually necessary to make a full impact against the phobic avoidance behaviour. Thirdly, there is no drug that reverses the psycho-social problems these patients have. Not all of them have such problems, but those that do may need psychotherapy to deal with their conflicts and stresses. Finally, the evidence in several chronic studies, suggest that this is a chronic relapsing disorder in the majority of cases. It is not enough to treat these patients acutely. They must be followed chronically and monitored carefully over many years, if they are to be protected against relapse.", 
    "24": "The prevalence of anxiety disorders in a psychiatric sense is 5-10%. If all available data are summed up, it seems evident that about half of these disorders have a prolonged, often chronic course, and thus require some form of long-term or continuous treatment. Accomplishment of long-term treatment will often be prevented by a general fear of dependence and abuse, risk factors that have been strongly emphasized. General restrictivity has also been urged regarding the dosage level, often resulting in a sub-optimal treatment, more harmful than beneficial to the patient. The prescription figures for anxiolytics in relation to the prevalence and course of anxiety disorders do not suggest an unreasonably high prescription rate, on the contrary, the prescribed amount would not be sufficient for treating more than 2.5% of the population.", 
    "25": "One hundred patients with mixed symptoms of anxiety and depression were enrolled into a prospective, multi-centre, randomized, double-blind study comparing the response to, and the side-effects of, alprazolam and dothiepin hydrochloride over 4 weeks of treatment. Mean daily doses were 2.33 mg alprazolam and 115 mg dothiepin. Data on 96 patients were evaluated for tolerance, and data for 85 patients were analyzed for therapeutic response. In each case, the groups were similar in numbers, mean ages and sex ratios. Both groups experienced satisfactory responses to therapy, with highly statistically significant changes (p less than 0.001) in the means of all efficacy measures within each group. No statistical difference was demonstrated in favour of either treatment group. Both dothiepin and alprazolam exhibited a similar profile of mild minor side-effects, but more patients suffered moderate to severe reactions to dothiepin, leading to a greater drop-out rate in the dothiepin-treated group. It is concluded that, as both treatments produced equally satisfactory responses in this study, alprazolam should be considered for the treatment of anxiety associated with depression in patients for whom tricyclic antidepressant drugs are either contra-indicated or poorly tolerated.", 
    "26": "Pediatric patients have greater degrees of pharmacokinetic variability and unpredictability than adults. This variability results from the effects of pharmacogenetics, age and growth, prior and current comedication, and disease. Newborns with seizures have the least predictable dosage requirements, and their needs change as drug-eliminating mechanisms mature in the neonatal period. Infants have the highest relative capacities to eliminate antiepileptics of any age group and require the largest relative doses. In addition to age-related trends, children demonstrate the same drug-specific, pharmacokinetic phenomena that adults do, including nonlinear phenytoin elimination, nonlinear valproate binding, and autoinduction of carbamazepine. Intercurrent illness and drug interactions further modify the age-related pharmacokinetic patterns in children and make dosage requirements even more unpredictable. Recent studies have shown that febrile illness can affect drug elimination, sometimes decreasing drug levels by 50% or more. Intermittent treatment with benzodiazepines administered either orally or rectally can be an important adjunct and help minimize this type of problem for children with marginally controlled epilepsy. Intermittent benzodiazepines are also helpful for children who have febrile seizures and who need only occasional antiepileptic protection.", 
    "27": "A double-blind randomised controlled trial comparing the antiemetic effects of sublingual lorazepam combined with high-dose, short course metoclopramide (3 mg/kg) infused twice 3 h apart with or without i.v. dexamethasone is reported. Sixty patients receiving a total of 209 cycles of potentially severely emetic cytotoxic chemotherapy were randomised to receive one or other antiemetic regimen. In those receiving platinum-based chemotherapy the addition of dexamethasone was associated with an improvement in freedom from nausea (P less than 0.01) and freedom from vomiting (P less than 0.05). In the non-platinum-based chemotherapy group the addition of dexamethasone led to a reduction in the duration and severity of nausea, and duration of vomiting (P less than 0.05 in each case). Both antiemetic regimens were well tolerated with a low incidence of adverse effects and could be administered easily in an outpatient setting.", 
    "28": "Major depression may be the most common medical or psychiatric disorder seen in primary medical care clinics, occurring in approximately 6 to 10 percent of the clinic populations. Despite this high prevalence rate, patients with depression often go undiagnosed or are misdiagnosed. The evidence suggests a multifactorial etiology for this problem. Many patients with depression selectively focus on the somatic components of their depressive syndrome and minimize or even deny affective and cognitive symptoms. Depression and medical disorders also often occur concomitantly with depression causing amplification of somatic complaints. Due to the unidimensional focus on the biomedical model many physicians only evaluate and treat the physical illness and do not diagnose the depression. This often leads to aggressive medical testing and treatment that carries the risk of iatrogenic injury (polysurgery, multiple tests and procedures, prescription of opiates and benzodiazepines). Several interventions are suggested to improve the diagnostic acumen of primary care physicians.", 
    "29": "Pirenzepine has been widely used for the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcer. In this work we have proved that this drug could prevent the inflammatory reaction induced in the colon with an intraluminal stimuli as the acetic acid. These data suggest the cholinergic participation in the inflammatory colonic response.", 
    "30": "This paper compares the results of plasma drug level estimations for 30 patients receiving clonazepam and 39 patients taking carbamazepine (assessing total and free carbamazepine concentrations together with carbamazepine epoxide levels) with the clinical features of seizure control. Owing to the small numbers of seizure-free patients, the power of the study was insufficient to justify absolute conclusions being drawn. However there appeared to be a trend which suggested that drug level estimations in both situations had virtually no clinical relevance. This causes one to question the growing reliance on plasma drug level estimation in the treatment of epilepsy and, because of the low power of the study, demands extension of the work to confirm its significance. This type of research in epilepsy, based exclusively on a secondary and tertiary referral source, has inherent difficulty in that a conspicuously low number of well controlled patients is included. Acknowledgement of this fact should lead one to appraise critically other papers giving dogmatic statements regarding therapeutic ranges of anticonvulsant plasma levels.", 
    "31": "Fourty-nine patients were examined with epileptic seizures and values of serum and erythrocyte magnesium (sMg, RBC Mg) and serum zinc (sZn) were determined. Chronic deficiency in RBC Mg and sZn were confirmed. The percentage of patients with decreased RBC Mg increased with the time of antiepileptic treatment; significant lowering occurs after 5 years of treatment for RBC Mg and within 5 years for sZn. Various antiepileptics and their combinations have different effects on the degree of the lowering. The therapy of magnesium lactate produces significantly higher RBC Mg and sZn. The clinical, electroencephalographical and biochemical findings are improved.", 
    "32": "Methods of sedation in the ITU have changed considerably over the last few years. Whereas the use of muscle relaxants to control ventilation was a frequent feature of those ITUs reviewed by Merriman, a more recent study by Gast and colleagues revealed a far greater use of narcotics and/or hypnotics, or combinations of the two. Alfentanil has many of those ideal properties needed of a sedative drug in the ITU--its use is associated with marked cardiovascular stability, it is a potent ventilatory depressant, has a high therapeutic ratio, minimal immunological or metabolic effects, and has an appropriate kinetic profile (low liposolubility, small volume of distribution, short half-life). The present paper describes the use of an infusion of alfentanil, in combination with increments of midazolam, to provide sedation and control of ventilation in patients admitted to a general ITU.", 
    "33": "The effects of equipotent, single intravenous doses of zopiclone (7.5 mg) and diazepam (10 mg) on ventilatory responses in healthy volunteers (aged 40 to 60 years) were investigated in a randomized, double-blind cross-over study. Drug injections and subsequent tests were separated by a washout period of at least 3 days. The effects on ventilatory responses were evaluated by measuring nonstimulated tidal volume, breathing frequency, and minute ventilation before and after injection of the test medications. The PO2, PCO2, pH, and base excess of arterial capillary blood, as well as blood pressure and heart rate, were measured during the test sessions. A classical rebreathing Krogh spirometer test was carried out starting with a 7% CO2 level. Total ventilation was calculated for the rebreathing period. The intravenous administration of 10 mg of diazepam induced a moderate but significant reduction in the CO2-stimulated ventilatory responses in normal subjects. This effect was not observed after intravenous injection of 7.5 mg zopiclone. Zopiclone induced an increase in respiratory frequency. Both substances elicited a similar moderate decrease in arterial blood pressure.", 
    "34": "Three 5-HT agonists produced a dose-related fall in open/total arm entry ratio in the elevated X-maze model of anxiety at doses which did not affect total entries. The relative potency, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetra lin (8-OH-DPAT) much greater than 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeODMT) greater than or equal to 5-methoxy-3(tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)1H-indole (RU 24969), was unrelated to the occurrence of wet dog shakes and suggests that 5-HT1 rather than 5-HT2 receptors may be involved. However, the 5-HT2 receptor antagonists ritanserin, ketanserin and seganserin caused an anxiolytic-like increase in entry ratio, although only ritanserin produced this effect across the dose range tested. +/- Pindolol, an antagonist at 5-HT1 receptors, showed a biphasic dose-response curve with a fall in entry ratio at one high dose. The effect of a submaximal dose of 8-OH-DPAT was prevented by pindolol but not by a similarly anxiolytic dose of ritanserin or diazepam. A higher dose of diazepam caused intense muscle hypotonia in combination with 8-OH-DPAT. Since open/total entry ratio appears to represent choice, rather than suppression or delay, of a response, the effects seen may indicate involvement of 5-HT receptors in anxiety separately from any change in the ability to withhold a response. The precise role of each receptor subtype, however, remains to be determined.", 
    "35": "Two experiments were conducted to determine the effects of the M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine on place navigation in a water maze. In the first experiment rats were required to learn the location of a hidden platform following intracerebroventricular injections of equimolar doses of pirenzepine or scopolamine methylbromide. Both drugs dose-dependently impaired spatial learning according to both escape latency data and transfer test analysis. Pirenzepine was approximately 3 times less potent than scopolamine, a potency ratio which suggests M1 receptor mediation of the impairment. In the second experiment pirenzepine (1 approximately 92.3 micrograms/rat ICV) was injected prior to training on a simultaneous place discrimination task in the water maze. Impairments of choice accuracy were found with a dose of 20 micrograms/rat in the absence of any marked increases in either errors of omission or choice latency. These data suggest that M1 receptor blockade impairs processes which are involved in spatial learning.", 
    "36": "Male Fischer 344 rats were examined for an age-dependent sensitivity to the anticonflict and central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects of diazepam. A conflict paradigm was used to measure the ability of single intravenous injections of diazepam to attenuate punishment-induced suppression of behavior and to elicit CNS depression in young, mature, and senescent rats. Senescent rats had the lowest behaviorally active threshold dose. However, diazepam at the behaviorally active threshold dose produced a simultaneous increase in punished and unpunished responding in all three age groups. Punished responding was increased more and over a wider dose range in the young and mature rats than in the senescent rats. Sensitivity to the CNS depressant effects of diazepam was over four times greater in the senescent rats than in the other two age groups. In summary, the results indicate that the behavioral effects of diazepam vary with dosage and age of the rat. The male Fischer 344 rat may be a useful animal model for exploring how diazepam elicits age-related behavioral effects in humans.", 
    "37": "Cooper (1983, 1985) observed an inhibition of ambulation and fluid intake in rats following diazepam in the microgram dose range. The present study aimed at investigating the effects of microgram doses of this benzodiazepine on i) the threshold doses of either pentylenetetrazole, picrotoxin or bicuculline required to induce seizures in mice and ii) the suppression of lever pressing for food induced by the delivery of one electric footshock every ten presses in rats pretreated or not with isoniazid (64 mg/kg IP). Diazepam 4-32 micrograms/kg IP) neither reduced seizure threshold doses of either convulsant studied nor did this drug (16-128 micrograms/kg IP) reliably decrease the number of lever presses under the punishment schedule. The present study provides no further evidence for a dose-related biphasic effect of diazepam which could give new insight into the functioning of benzodiazepine-coupled brain processes.", 
    "38": "The effects of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and previously published effect of stress on the locomotor activity of mice in different regions of an open field were compared. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of 0.2 microgram CRF, like stress, significantly increased center region activity; this effect was reversed by the benzodiazepine diazepam (DZP) at a dose of DZP having no significant effect alone. A dose of DZP that antagonized CRF-potentiated center region activity did not block amphetamine-stimulated center area activity. These results suggest that CRF may normally be responsible for many behavioral changes during conditions of stress.", 
    "39": "Young adult rats (5 months) were compared with aged (28 months) rats in their ability to learn and perform in a diazepam drug discrimination. Both groups of rats were drug naive at the onset of the experiment. Adult and aged animals learned to discriminate diazepam. In general, the response rates under both drug and vehicle conditions were significantly lower for the aged group. The diazepam stimuli were dose-dependent in each group. Similar dose-dependent generalization with chlordiazepoxide, pentobarbital, and methocarbamol was also noted in both the aged and adult animals. These data suggest that aged animals, who have experienced anxiolytic compounds over a period of time (in this case, repeated administration of diazepam in the discrimination procedure), respond in a similar fashion to drug treatment as do young adult animals, verifying the reliability and validity of results obtained in aging rats who are repeatedly exposed to drug treatment.", 
    "40": "It has been suggested that ethanol, besides its stimulating, sedative and ataxic effects, also exerts anxiolytic effects similarly to diazepam. In the present study we tested this hypothesis on ultrasonic distress crying in neonatal rats separated from mother and litter-mates. The results showed that both ethanol and diazepam reduced crying in a dose-dependent manner and at doses not affecting the level of motor activity. It was found that the effects of diazepam, but not that of ethanol, was antagonized by the specific benzodiazepine-receptor-antagonist Ro 15-1788. The effects of ethanol were antagonized by the GABA-ergic antagonist picrotoxin. Assessing the sedative/ataxic effects of ethanol and diazepam by the surface body righting response, it was found that the effect of diazepam, but not of ethanol, was antagonized by Ro 15-1788. The results support the hypothesis that ethanol exerts similar anxiolytic actions as diazepam, but that the effects are mediated by different mechanisms.", 
    "41": "Cross-dependence between ethanol and chlordiazepoxide (CDP) was demonstrated by a bidirectional experiment involving induction of ethanol dependence in mice by a liquid diet method followed by substitution of ethanol with CDP. The administration of CDP diets fully suppressed ethanol withdrawal signs. After a period (14-24 days) of CDP administration the mice showed spontaneous CDP withdrawal signs following the termination of CDP diet. Similar signs, but much more short-lived, can also be precipitated by injection of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, RO-15-788.", 
    "42": "Rats were trained to discriminate the effects of nicotine (0.4 mg/kg SC) plus midazolam (0.2 mg/kg SC) from those of saline in a two-bar operant conditioning procedure involving a tandem schedule of food reinforcement. After discrimination training, the component drugs of the mixture produced very considerable amounts of drug-appropriate responding when given separately. Mecamylamine and Ro 15-1788 only slightly attenuated the discriminative response to the mixture when given separately, but completely blocked the response when administered together. In different groups of rats trained to discriminate nicotine or midazolam separately from saline, neither drug appreciably altered the dose-response curve for the other, suggesting a minimal role for pharmacological interactions when effects of mixtures were assessed. The results suggest that the two components of a compound drug-produced stimulus can be perceived separately rather than being blended into a homogenous entity. Knowledge of the characteristics of compound drug-produced stimuli may aid interpretation of the discriminative effects of single drugs with wide spectra of action.", 
    "43": "The ring A reduced metabolites of deoxycorticosterone and progesterone, 3 alpha, 5 alpha-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) and 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-dihydroprogesterone (3 alpha-OH-DHP) have been shown to be potent barbiturate-like ligands of the benzodiazepine receptor complex. The former has also been reported to have anxiolytic effects in mice and rats. In the present study, sleep recordings were obtained on rats given 5 and 10 mg/kg of these steroids alone and in combination with flurazepam. THDOC, but not 3 alpha-OH-DHP, had potent dose-dependent sleep-inducing properties and increased nonREM sleep. Flurazepam had similar hypnotic effects and also reduced REM sleep. There were no significant interactions between THDOC and flurazepam, except in the case of REM latency, which tended to increase when the two compounds were given together. In summary, THDOC, a mineralocorticoid metabolite found in brain, has sedative properties and could conceivably play a role in stress responses.", 
    "44": "Sedative and facilitatory effects on variable-interval hypothalamic self-stimulation were monitored during chronic treatment with chlordiazepoxide (CDP; 7.5 mg/kg IP), given at 48-h intervals in two groups of rats. Group 1 was injected immediately before each of 40 1-h self-stimulation sessions (\"drugged responding\"); Group 2 was injected after self-stimulation for the first 20 sessions (\"undrugged responding\"), and before self-stimulation for a further 20 sessions (\"drugged responding\"). Significant sedation occurred in both groups in initial sessions of drugged responding, even though Group 2 had already received 20 injections of CDP (after undrugged sessions). Sedative effects showed very rapid tolerance, and disappeared after 1-3 sessions, but only in rats which had been responding while drugged (and which thus had had opportunities to develop coping strategies against the sedative effects). After further sessions of drugged responding, sedation was replaced by apparently stimulant effects. Stimulant effects showed no tolerance at all in either group even after 40 injections, thus differing from anti-conflict (and other) effects of BZDs, which generally show gradual tolerance. These results show that coping strategies acquired by instrumental learning can account for rapid and selective tolerance to sedative effects. Coping strategies do not account for the differing rates of tolerance to stimulant and to other effects of BZDs; these differences may indicate pharmacologically distinct brain systems downstream from the BZD receptor.", 
    "45": "A major problem in the treatment of clinical epilepsy with benzodiazepines is the development of tolerance. This is most marked with the 1,5-benzodiazepine, clobazam, but is also noted with the 1,4-benzodiazepine, clonazepam. This study examined the effects of chronic treatment with clobazam, clonazepam and the non-benzodiazepine sodium valproate on the amygdaloid kindled rat with a view to developing an animal model of tolerance. Twice daily intraperitoneal injections of vehicle (1 mL/kg), clonazepam (0.3 mg/kg), clobazam (4.0-8.0 mg/kg) or sodium valproate (200 mg/kg) were given to fully kindled rats for 12 days, in the case of clonazepam and valproate, and for 16 days for clobazam. All rats were stimulated 30-60 minutes (depending on the drug) after the morning dose. The amygdala after-discharge duration (recorded on the EEG) and the seizure stage were determined. While all three drugs initially blocked the kindled seizure, tolerance developed to clonazepam and clobazam but not to valproate. Statistical analysis of the results showed a significant linear trend in the development of tolerance to clonazepam after day 5, but tolerance to clobazam appeared in a more abrupt manner after day 2. The clobazam group were then given a further 2 days of treatment with clonazepam (0.3-0.6 mg/kg) and this blocked the kindled seizures. The amygdaloid kindled rat is a suitable model for studying tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of benzodiazepines. Further experiments are currently in progress to examine the effectiveness of change-over therapy between clobazam and clonazepam as a means of overcoming tolerance.", 
    "46": "Clobazam, a 1,5-benzodiazepine, is a potent anticonvulsant but the development of tolerance limits its use. It has been suggested that low dose clobazam may prevent or delay the onset of tolerance. This study aimed to assess, by an open trial, the anticonvulsant activity of low dose clobazam in 11 adult patients with frequent intractable seizures. Serum clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam levels were assayed and correlated with clinical effect, adverse effects, drug dose and the development of tolerance. Clobazam was given in addition to conventional antiepileptic therapy, beginning with a dose of 20 mg at night. A 50% or greater reduction in the frequency of seizures was noted, at least transiently, in all patients. In 8 of the 11 patients there was a subsequent deterioration in control of epilepsy and in all patients this relapse occurred within 3 months of commencing treatment. There was a relationship between plasma concentrations of N-desmethylclobazam (but not of clobazam) and therapeutic and toxic effects. Tolerance was not associated with a fall in plasma levels. It is concluded that clobazam is of limited value as a long term anticonvulsant and that the high incidence of tolerance is not reduced by the use of low doses.", 
    "47": "In order to evaluate whether in endogenous depression the anomalous growth hormone (GH) response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is mediated by muscarinic cholinergic receptors, 12 patients were tested with TRH (200 micrograms iv) with and without previous treatment with the muscarinic cholinergic receptor blocker pirenzepine (40 mg iv 10 min before TRH). Control tests with normal saline also were performed. Administration of normal saline did not alter serum GH levels. In contrast, TRH injections significantly increased serum GH concentrations by about three-fold. This response was inhibited by pretreatment with pirenzepine. Another neuroendocrine marker of endogenous depression, the low TSH increase in response to TRH (delta less than or equal to 7 microU/ml), was observed in our patients. Pretreatment with pirenzepine did not modify this response. These data indicate that in patients with endogenous depression a muscarinic cholinergic mechanism is involved in the GH response but not in the TSH response to TRH.", 
    "48": "The use of propofol alone or with alfentanil in the day-case anaesthesia for abortion was compared with that of ketamine with midazolam. Two hundred young women were assigned to two successive series of two groups each. The four groups were: group 1 (2 mg . kg-1 propofol only); group II (0.5 mg . kg-1 ketamine with 0.25 mg . kg-1 midazolam); group III (2 mg . kg-1 propofol with 4 micrograms . kg-1 alfentanil); group IV (1 mg . kg-1 ketamine with 0.1 mg . kg-1 midazolam). All the patients were premedicated one hour before anaesthesia with 0.25 mg . kg-1 midazolam orally. All the patients were asleep at the end of the propofol injection (60 s), and 10 to 15 s later for the ketamine-midazolam groups. The haemodynamic parameters did not vary much during induction with ketamine-midazolam. In the propofol groups, the heart rate remained steady, with an 8 to 12% fall in blood pressure. A fall of the mandible was seen in 40 and 84% of the patients in the propofol groups, with a short apnoea in 32 and 48% of these same patients. Clinical recovery was very quick, less than 12 min for all groups. The four psychomotor and sensory tests were carried out at the 30th min by 95% of the patients in the propofol groups, whereas only 50% of those in the ketamine-midazolam groups did so. Speed and quality were significantly better in the propofol groups. The most frequent adverse effect of propofol was pain during injection in 32 and 14% of patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "The relationships between alprazolam and metabolite concentrations and CNS effects were determined in a double-blind placebo controlled four-way crossover trial in 16 normal male volunteers. Active drug treatments consisted of 4-day regimens of 4 mg alprazolam PO daily as 2 mg bid., 1 mg qid, and 0.25 mg each hour. On days 1 and 4, the kinetics, sedative and psychomotor effects were evaluated. Plasma concentrations of the 4- and alpha-hydroxy metabolites of alprazolam were less than 10% of unchanged alprazolam levels on both days. Accumulation of these metabolites and alprazolam was dependent on alprazolam half-life (11.6 h). Acute and chronic tolerance to the sedative and psychomotor effects was observed with all active drug treatments. All alprazolam treatments resulted in significantly greater sedation than placebo on days 1 and 4. However, on day 4, sedation was 16-36% less than observed on day 1, despite plasma concentrations 1.4-2.76 times the day 1 concentrations. Sedation from alprazolam was reduced in each successive study phase, suggesting a tolerance which was sustained during the 10-day washout between phases. By day 4, psychomotor performance was not different from placebo, indicating more complete development of tolerance than occurred for the sedative effect. Sedation and psychomotor impairment on day 1 were greatest with 2 mg alprazolam bid. During the initiation of therapy, the patient will likely experience less sedation and psychomotor impairment with smaller, more frequent doses. Since tolerance develops to these effects, the advantage of more frequent dosing regimen dissipates by the 4th day.", 
    "50": "Locomotor activity in a Varimex apparatus, hot-plate responding, and morphine effects (1 and 10 mg/kg IP) were assessed in 14-, 21-, 28-, and 70-day old mice. The development of hot-plate responding consisted mainly of a progressive increase of latencies and a parallel reduction of sensitivity to morphine. Morphine depressed activity at 14 days at the lower dose, had no effect at 21 days, and produced an adult-like hyperactivity at 28 days (10 mg/kg). Prenatal oxazepam (15 mg/kg, given per os twice daily on days 12-16 of pregnancy) did not influence hot-plate responding and morphine analgesia at any of the test ages. By contrast, the data on activity, besides replicating the response reduction at 14 days observed previously in an open-field test (Alleva et al. 1985), showed a delayed appearance of morphine hyperactivity in oxazepam mice.", 
    "51": "The effects on memory and psychomotor functions of oxazepam (15, 30 mg) were compared with those of its chlorinated derivative lorazepam (1, 2 mg) and placebo. Forty five volunteers took part in a double-blind, independent groups design. Subjects completed a battery of tests before and 1.5 and 3 h after drug administration. Lorazepam and oxazepam had similar dose-related effects on tests of attention, manual motor speed and recoding skills and all active treatments produced similar levels of subjective sedation. Both drugs caused anterograde impairments of long-term verbal memory and had no effects on short-term verbal span or recency. Neither drug produced retrograde amnesia for material learned before drug administration nor affected retrieval from semantic memory. The high (2 mg) dose of lorazepam positively facilitated recall of pre-drug information. The magnitude of anterograde amnesia produced by the two benzodiazepines was not linearly dose-related in that the two low doses had similar effects whereas the high dose of lorazepam produced impairments many times greater than oxazepam 30 mg. We conclude that drugs with similar half-lives may have similar effects on some cognitive and mood factors but be completely different in terms of amnesic effects. Differing potencies of the two drugs may be a more important factor determining amnesic side-effects.", 
    "52": "The development of tolerance to behavioral effects of morphine was investigated in rats that responded on a two-lever, multiple-trial, multiple differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate fixed-ratio (mult DRL FR) schedule of food presentation. Stable performances were maintained when sessions were conducted just twice per week. The effects of cumulative doses of morphine (1.0-8.0 mg/kg) or chlordiazepoxide (CDP; 4.0-32.0 mg/kg) were evaluated once per week; saline injections were given in the intervening sessions. The effects of saline and morphine on nociception were also evaluated in hot-plate tests conducted on the same subjects 15 min after selected operant sessions. Initially, morphine produced dose-related decreases in response rates and reinforcement rates in the DRL and FR components as well as significant increases in hot-plate response latencies. Following weekly administration of morphine (1.0-8.0 mg/kg) for 10 weeks, there was little or no tolerance to its effects on operant behavior. In contrast, complete tolerance developed to the antinociceptive effects of morphine. These results suggest that tolerance to various behavioral effects of morphine may be dissociated, and that the loss of reinforcement may be insufficient by itself to produce tolerance to effects of morphine on operant behavior. Additionally, whereas CDP initially produced only dose-related decreases in DRL and FR response rates, following weekly morphine the smaller doses of CDP (4.0-16.0 mg/kg) produced increases in response rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "53": "Mice were exposed for 10-20 min to room air, 100% oxygen (O2) or increasing concentrations of nitrous oxide (N2O) in O2, then tested for 3 min in a staircase inside a glovebag. N2O produced a concentration-dependent increase in the number of steps ascended (NSA) but no change in the number of rears (NR). Pretreatment with naloxone reversed the increase in NSA and also unmasked N2O reduction in NR. By comparison, increasing doses of the narcotic standard morphine reduced NSA and NR; these changes in NSA and NR were sensitive to antagonism by naloxone. The benzodiazepine standard diazepam produced a dose-related reduction in NR while reducing NSAd only at higher doses. These data indicate that N2O influences on NSA and NR resemble neither morphine nor diazepam. In addition, it appears that the opioid activity of N2O might mask its antianxiety activity in this particular paradigm.", 
    "54": "A competitive enzyme immunoassay was developed for metabolites of 450191-S, a ring-opened derivative of triazolobenzodiazepines, in human serum. Three kinds of labelled antigens, beta-D-galactosidase conjugates, and antisera from three kinds of immunogens, bovine serum albumin conjugates, were tested and the hapten heterologous assay was selected. B/F separation was performed using immobilized second antibody and the enzyme activity was measured using fluorescent substrate. One of the serum metabolites, the carboxyl form, was extracted from acidified serum and measured by the assay. The minimum detectable concentration was 1.5 ng/ml in serum, 15 pg/tube. The intra-assay and inter-assay variances were 5.5% and 7.7% at 6 ng/ml of serum, respectively. Standard curves of other related metabolites were assessed with various combinations of labelled antigens and antibodies.", 
    "55": "A 42-year-old man with a 26-year history of duodenal ulcer volunteered for a 24-hour intragastric pH monitoring study, at which time his fasting gastrin concentration was found to be elevated. Secretin injection decreased the serum gastrin concentration. When not on treatment his total gastrin, gastrin-17 (G-17), and gastrin-34 (G-34) response to a protein-containing breakfast was marked. Immunocytochemical staining of antral biopsies showed hyperplasia of gastrin-containing cells, more pronounced for G-17 than for G-34. Cimetidine or cimetidine plus pirenzepine increased 24-hour intragastric pH, whereas pirenzepine alone rendered the gastric contents more acidic, particularly overnight. The total serum gastrin concentrations increased after meals and were unaffected by cimetidine or pirenzepine; enprostil, however, reduced the postprandial increase in total gastrin, G-34, and G-17. After six weeks of treatment with enprostil, the number of cells containing G-17 and G-34 was reduced. The findings show that G-cell hyperplasia may occur in the presence of a normal fasting serum gastrin concentration; fasting serum gastrin concentrations may fluctuate widely over time; the food-stimulated increase in G-17 was greater than that for G-34, and is associated with more pronounced antral hyperplasia for G-17 and G-34; and enprostil blunts the postprandial increase in G-17, G-34, and total gastrin. These observations suggest that enprostil may reduce G-cell hyperplasia and hypergastrinemia.", 
    "56": "To investigate whether an elevated plus-maze consisting of two open and two closed arms could be used as a model of anxiety in the mouse, NIH Swiss mice were tested in the apparatus immediately after a holeboard test. Factor analysis of data from undrugged animals tested in the holeboard and plus-maze yielded three orthogonal factors interpreted as assessing anxiety, directed exploration and locomotion. Anxiolytic drugs (chlordiazepoxide, sodium pentobarbital and ethanol) increased the proportion of time spent on the open arms, and anxiogenic drugs (FG 7142, caffeine and picrotoxin) reduced this measure. Amphetamine and imipramine failed to alter the indices of anxiety. The anxiolytic effect of chlordiazepoxide was reduced in mice that had previously experienced the plus-maze in an undrugged state. Testing animals in the holeboard immediately before the plus-maze test significantly elevated both the percentage of time spent on the open arms and the total number of arm entries, but did not affect the behavioral response to chlordiazepoxide. The plus-maze appears to be a useful test with which to investigate both anxiolytic and anxiogenic agents.", 
    "57": "Cognitive performance, psychomotor skills, and subjective reactions to diazepam and placebo were compared in 12 healthy, well-educated subjects in three age groups: 19-28, 40-45, and 61-73 years old. With only minor exceptions, the changes in performance caused by diazepam and age differences were statistically additive and noninteracting. Diazepam did not act synergistically in older individuals; the decrements in performance were about the same in all age groups. Baseline performance decreased with increasing age; middle-aged subjects performed more like older than younger subjects. A variety of tasks exhibited similar effects of aging and diazepam, i.e., when performance declined with increasing age, it was also reduced by diazepam.", 
    "58": "Previous studies of the benzodiazepine antagonist CGS 8216 have reported that this compound may enhance the punishment-induced suppression of behaviour. In order to investigate this phenomenon further, water-deprived rats were trained to drink from a water spout during a multiple schedule with shocked and unshocked components. During the shocked components a very mild electric footshock was presented after every 20th lick. The shock slightly reduced the rate of licking during these components below that which occurred during periods without shock, although this effect decreased during the experiment. CGS 8216 (0.3-10 mg/kg) produced a dose-related reduction in licking during both schedule components. The overall volumes of water consumed were reduced by CGS 8216 as was the number of licks during the first, unshocked schedule component, before shock was applied, showing that the effect on unshocked licking was not due to a generalisation of suppression between periods with or without shock. In contrast to CGS 8216, a dose of 10 mg/kg pentylenetetrazol selectively reduced shocked licking. In a second group of rats which drank under identical conditions but without shock, CGS 8216 again reduced water intake. These results show that CGS 8216 can reduce water intake in rats regardless of whether drinking results in shock presentation.", 
    "59": "Thirty-six young adult, male subjects with sleep-onset insomnia were equally divided into placebo, 0.25 mg, and 0.5 mg triazolam groups to examine the effects of the hypnotic, with particular attention to dose level on efficacy, sleep stages, and awakening to a smoke detector alarm. On nights 1 and 4 of a five-consecutive-night protocol, a standard home smoke detector alarm was sounded during stage 2, 5 min after sleep onset, in slow wave sleep (SWS), and at the time of the early morning awakening. The alarm registered 78 dB SPL at the pillow. EEG arousal latency and reaction time to a button press were studied. Failure to awaken to three 1-min alarm presentations was scored as \"no response.\" Both dose levels produced similar reductions in sleep latency, decreases in SWS, increases in stage 2, and increases in sleep efficiency. Both dose levels showed similar sedative effects to the smoke alarm. Fifty percent of triazolam subjects failed to awaken on night 1 during SWS, and EEG arousal and response latencies were significantly slowed. Some drug tolerance or sensitization to the alarm was seen by night 4. By morning, all subjects were easily awakened on both nights. The 0.25 mg dose is clearly an effective dose level for both sleep efficacy and sedative effects to outside noise, which in some instances could pose potential problems.", 
    "60": "Antiepileptics can impair the performance of subjects in both acute and subacute doses. The effects of phenobarbital and its derivatives and benzodiazepines are stronger in this respect than that of phenytoin, ethosuccimides and valproic acid. Carbamazepine, in contrast, has rather a stimulatory action. Impaired cognition, psychomotor performance and emotions must also be expected under therapeutic conditions. Attention is drawn to various factors that may influence the results of tests, including the dose and blood concentration, interval between application and test, initial performance of the probands or patients, levels of vigilance and personality structure. Lack of compliance is particularly important since adaptation and readaptation processes that can be dangerous take place in these patients. The careful exploration of side-effects on the patient may have a decisive influence on practicability and cost if the relationship between patient and doctor is good.", 
    "61": "Serotonin (5-HT) and 5-HT receptors are involved in mood disturbances, such as anxiety and depression. Ritanserin is a new substance with highly selective blocking activity on S2 receptors for 5-HT in the central nervous system. Ritanserin, (20 mg daily) and lorazepam (5 mg daily) were administered to 24 patients suffering from generalized anxiety disorders (DSM III), in a double-blind fashion for six weeks. The results obtained showed comparable improvement in almost all patients with both drugs. Future studies should pay particular attention to psychosomatic disturbances, depressed mood and dysthymic-like disorders, in which ritanserin seems to be more efficacious, according to the best responding items of the general anxiety check list used.", 
    "62": "We have compared diazepam pharmacokinetics in 16 Chinese and 18 white Caucasian healthy male volunteers, resident in Hong Kong and have correlated them with physical attributes. Serum concentrations of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam were measured in venous blood by an enzyme-linked immunoassay (0-3 h samples) and HPLC (3-72 h samples). Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived assuming a two compartment model, distribution phase less than 6 h, and 100% oral systemic availability. Compared with the Chinese the white Caucasians were older, heavier, taller, and fatter, as judged by skin fold thickness (SFT) and total body weight to 'Ideal' body weight (TBW/IBW) ratio; respective mean differences being 16%, 27%, 4%, 26%, and 15% (p less than 0.05). Mean diazepam apparent volume of distribution (V) and V/IBW were larger in the white Caucasians (52% & 39% respectively, p = 0.002). SFT and TBW/IBW ratio yielded the best correlations with V, V/TBW and V/IBW (0.50-0.75, p less than 0.05). Obesity indices contributed most to the overall regressions (R2 up to 0.52), and for V there was a further small effect (2%, partial F test) due to ethnic group, possibly reflecting stature. Mean peak diazepam concentration (Cmax) was similar in both ethnic groups. Time to Cmax (tmax) was more often prolonged in the Chinese (chi 2 test, p = 0.01). Body fat and stature may thus account for these inter-ethnic differences in the apparent volume of distribution of diazepam, a highly lipid-soluble drug.", 
    "63": "The usefulness of the anticonvulsant drugs is determined by the mechanisms by which the agent acts and its pharmacokinetics. The general mechanisms of action of these agents include (1) effects on neurotransmitter action, (2) effects on repetitive neuronal firing mechanisms, (3) effects on neuronal networks, and (4) effects on neuronal ionic transport. Ethosuximide, valproic acid and clonazepam are used primarily in absence epilepsy. Valproic acid is also effective against generalized tonic-clonic epilepsy. Diazepam is used primarily in status epilepticus. Valproic acid enhances gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition, reduces repetitive firing, and reduces both inhibition and excitation in neuronal networks. Clonazepam and diazepam enhance the inhibitory action of GABA, decrease inhibition in neuronal networks and affect calcium ion transport with lesser effects on repetitive firing. Ethosuximide reduces inhibition in neuronal networks, may interact with dopamine, and possibly affects sodium and potassium ion transport. Further work is needed to assess the degree of involvement of these effects in the anticonvulsant action versus the adverse effects of these agents.", 
    "64": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and the tolerance of Ro 15-1788, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, in reversing the effects of midazolam. Six healthy male volunteers (mean age 32 +/- 3 years; mean weight 75.5 +/- 5 kg) took part in this study. Two of the three following drugs: midazolam (0.15 mg X kg-1), Ro 15-1788 (0.1 mg X kg-1) or placebo, diluted in 10 ml isotonic saline, were injected intravenously in 15 s at 5 min intervals in a double-blind manner in each subject during six randomized sessions: midazolam-placebo; Ro-placebo; placebo-midazolam; placebo-Ro; midazolam-Ro; Ro-midazolam. At least four days were allowed between each session for each subject. The evaluation of the effects on the central nervous system was as follows. At the time of injection of the first drug and, if possible, at the time of injection of the second drug, the subject was asked to count aloud to 150. The following variables were timed: start of dysarthria, cessation of counting, abolition and duration of absence of the ciliary reflex and duration of induced sleep. Retrograde and anterograde amnesia were evaluated by the recall of a playing card and a number. Haemodynamic effects (variations of systolic and diastolic pressures and pulses rate) as well as respiratory ones (apnoea) were also studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "65": "Dexamphetamine (DEX) and chlordiazepoxide (CDZP) given together as mixtures have previously been shown to induce a characteristic \"compulsive\" form of locomotor hyperactivity in rats placed in unfamiliar environments, which was much greater than activity obtained with any dose of either drug given separately; acute pretreatment with lithium counteracted mixture-induced hyperactivity. The role of dopamine in these effects was investigated by measuring concurrently the levels of dopamine (DA), dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the striatum. DEX (0.02-2 mg kg-1) increased horizontal (entries) and vertical (rears) activity, and increased DA and decreased DOPAC and HVA in the striatum. Chlordiazepoxide (CDZP) (12.5 or 20 mg kg-1) increased horizontal activity but did not affect vertical activity or DA or its metabolites. Lithium by itself in acute (2 meq kg-1, 24 and 4 h before test) or extended (2 meq kg-1 daily for 9 days) dosage had little effect on horizontal or vertical activity or levels of DA or DOPAC. Given together, DEX and CDZP (1.18 mg kg-1 + 12.5 mg kg-1), as expected, increased entries much more than did either drug given separately, but rears and levels of DA and metabolites remained similar to those with DEX given alone. Acute lithium pretreatment counteracted the mixture-induced increase in entries. Neither acute nor extended lithium pretreatment significantly altered DEX-induced changes in activity or levels of DA or DOPAC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "66": "Individuals who were using therapeutic doses (approximately 15 mg diazepam or its equivalent daily) of a benzodiazepine persistently and wished to attempt to stop were recruited into a study offering a medically supported outpatient behavioral treatment with a goal of abstinence. All subjects received the same behavioral treatment that emphasized the development of strategies for coping with abstinence and alternatives to benzodiazepines as a coping mechanism. The goal of abstinence was to be achieved within approximately 8 weeks by means of gradual tapering of the daily dose. Some subjects (Group D, n = 23) were randomly assigned to a condition in which their dose was to be tapered on a regime of active diazepam. Others (Group P, n = 19) were switched to placebo at the first treatment session and \"tapered\" from this pharmacologically inert substitute for diazepam. Supplies of tablets of each preparation were provided by the experimenters, and subjects were specifically requested to use only those tablets. The principal dependent variable was \"supplementation\", or use of a benzodiazepine other than that specifically authorized by the therapist. Supplementation was detected by measures of plasma benzodiazepine levels as compared to levels predicted if there had been strict compliance with the therapeutic regime. These comparisons were made by two expert judges who were blind to the subjects' experimental assignment. Self-report of supplementation was also obtained. Plasma level determinations indicated a significantly greater frequency of supplementation (84% versus 33% of subjects) for subjects in Group P.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "67": "73 oral facial surgery have been performed using controlled-hypotension induced with nitroglycerin (NTG) to reduce surgical bleeding. Surgical bleeding has been reduced in more than 45% of cases. But frequent lack of correlation between blood pressure, heart beat and bleeding might imply vascular reflex mechanisms induced by controlled-hypotension using NTG. Hemodynamic parameters such as blood pressure and heart rate seem to be insufficient to monitor controlled hypotension efficiency on surgical bleeding. The use of peroperative tissues blood flow monitoring may help for the better understanding of surgical bleeding during controlled-hypotension using NTG.", 
    "68": "The effects of chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 5 mg/kg i.p.), the sodium salt of valproic acid (VPA, 200 mg/kg i.p.) and naloxone (Nx, 1 mg/kg s.c.) alone and CDP-Nx, VPA-Nx association on schedule controlled behaviour with signalled unpunished and punished periods, were investigated. Our results show that CDP and VPA under both the unemotional (variable ratio reinforcement schedule 20%) and the emotional (continuous reinforced schedule associated with electric shock) components significantly increase responding in the Skinner box. Nx, on the multiple schedule, non-significantly reduces responding under both components. With CDP-Nx association the increase in responding under the unemotional component is less than in the case of the benzodiazepine alone, while under the emotional component the increase in responding is not appreciably affected. With the VPA-Nx association the responding rate is lower than that of the control under the unemotional component while under the emotional component the increase in responding is reduced compared to the VPA alone. The higher rates of unemotional and emotional responding with both CDP and VPA depend on the dipsogenic and disinhibiting effects by both drugs. The different rate of emotional and unemotional responding with CDP-Nx and VPA-Nx associations indicates a specific influence on GABAergic and other systems by CDP and VPA.", 
    "69": "The effect of diazepam on spatial visualization was studied using a double-blind crossover design. Diazepam 10 mg (or placebo) was given orally to 12 healthy young men at bedtime, followed again by 10 mg (or placebo) the next morning. One hour after the administration of the morning dose, the subjects performed a mental rotation task. Diazepam effects were analyzed in terms of an information processing model previously constructed to account for performance of the task. Using this method, the slope and intercept parameters of a linear function relating reaction time to task condition (i.e., angular difference in orientation between two identical stimulus figures) were computed for diazepam and placebo conditions. Diazepam significantly increased the slope and intercept of the mental rotation function (P less than 0.05). These results suggest that diazepam impairs spatial visualization ability.", 
    "70": "Recent studies have indicated that defeat experience induces acute non-opioid analgesia in intruder mice. To investigate the potential involvement of benzodiazepine receptors in this biologically-relevant form of environmentally-induced antinociception, we initially assessed the effects of some benzodiazepine ligands on basal nociception (tail-flick assay). Chlordiazepoxide (5-30 mg/kg), midazolam (0.625-5 mg/kg), diazepam (0.5-4 mg/kg), Ro15-1788 (5-80 mg/kg) and CGS8216 (5 mg/kg) were found to be ineffective in altering basal nociception. However, higher doses of CGS8216 (10-20 mg/kg) induced significant analgesia, an effect also observed with the beta-carboline derivatives FG7142 (5-20 mg/kg) and DMCM (1-2 mg/kg). Time-course analyses revealed that the onset of CGS8216 analgesia was slower than for FG7142 and DMCM, but that all three drugs produced long-lasting elevations in tail-flick latencies. The analgesic effects of FG7142 and DMCM were completely reversed by Ro15-1788 (20 mg/kg) and by chlordiazepoxide (20 mg/kg), suggesting mediation by benzodiazepine receptor mechanisms. Although CGS8216 analgesia was also reversed by Ro15-1788, it was unaffected by chlordiazepoxide; however, diazepam (5 mg/kg) did significantly attenuate the reaction. Further studies indicated that the antinociceptive consequences of defeat experience were dose-dependently blocked by Ro15-1788 (10-40 mg/kg) and by diazepam (0.5-2 mg/kg). Surprisingly, however, neither chlordiazepoxide (5-20 mg/kg) nor midazolam (1.25-2.5 mg/kg) blocked \"defeat\" analgesia under present test conditions. Although several issues remain unresolved, present findings would not be inconsistent with the proposal that stimuli associated with the acute stress of defeat experience release an endogenous ligand which acts in an \"inverse agonist-like\" manner at benzodiazepine sites.", 
    "71": "The motor impairing effects and plasma concentrations of barbital and lorazepam were studied in the alcohol tolerant (AT) and alcohol non-tolerant (ANT) rat lines developed for low and high sensitivity to motor impairment from ethanol. The mixed (M) line, from which the AT and ANT rats were derived, was also included in the study. Like ethanol, barbital and lorazepam impaired the performance of the ANT rats more than that of the AT rats. The motor performance of the M rats was relatively more impaired after barbital than after lorazepam administration at the same dose used in the AT and ANT rats. At the two latter time points (2.5 and 3.5 h) the sensitive ANT rats had significantly higher serum barbital concentrations than the AT rats. The serum barbital concentrations of the AT and ANT rats did not differ, however, at the two first time points (0.5 and 1.5 h) of the tilting plane tests, although the ANT rats were significantly more intoxicated. The concentrations of lorazepam in plasma do not explain the differential motor impairment either, since the sensitive ANT rats had lower plasma concentrations than the insensitive AT rats. The results, thus, suggest that the selection involved in the development of the AT and ANT lines has not been specific for ethanol. The results also support the idea that ethanol, barbiturates and benzodiazepines have some modes of action in common.", 
    "72": "Thirty-seven patients with unstable angina pectoris were treated with prolonged-action nitrates for 20 days; 8 of these received additionally meprobamate in a dose of 0.4 g per day and 11 patients received phenazepam in a dose of 0.002 g per day. The addition of tranquillizers to the complex of treatment led to a significant decrease of one of the final products of biological membrane lipid peroxidation--Schiff's bases in erythrocytic membranes. During treatment with phenazepam a similar decrease was more rapid (by the 5th day of treatment) and more pronounced.", 
    "73": "Two experiments have been conducted to clarify the effects of the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (CDP) on the different components of male rat sexual behavior. In the first experiment the effects on penile erectile reflexes (PR) of two doses (10 and 30 mg/kg, IP) of CDP were compared with those of vehicle, no-treatment and baseline pre-test in a repeated measures design. In the second experiment the different components of male sexual behavior - PR, mating behavior and spontaneous seminal emission SSE) - were extensively studied after vehicle, 3 and 30 mg/kg CDP treatments. CDP was found to increase significantly the percentage of rats showing penile reflexes, enhance the number of erections per test and shorten the latency to onset of reflexes. It lowered the percentage of animals displaying seminal emission during the PR test. In the mating behavior test, CDP abolished copulatory (and other) behavior at 30 mg/kg. It decreased the number of animals achieving ejaculation at the subataxic 3 mg/kg dose level. In the SSE 3-day test, CDP significantly reduced the weight and the number of plugs of seminal material emitted by the CDP-injected animals. The possible involvement of the serotonergic system in determining the dose-dependent increase in erections and decrease in seminal emission following CDP treatments is discussed. Clinical implications are also briefly considered.", 
    "74": "The effects of 10 mg orally-administered diazepam on various aspects of cognition were examined in ten male subjects. Diazepam produced a subjective sense of cognitive impairment and impaired auditory vigilence, immediate recognition of twice presented words, and context-dependent free recall. There was a trend for a significant proportion of subjects to show impairment in delayed recognition of twice-presented words. There was no impairment of context-independent semantic memory, or of subjects' ability to judge how well they had performed on the free recall task. In fact, subjects' subjective sense of cognitive impairment was correlated with their performance on context-dependent memory tasks.",

    "76": "The behavioral effects of 2-p-chlorophenylpyrazolo[4,3-c]quinolin-3(5H)-one (CGS 9896) were compared with those of lorazepam and zopiclone in squirrel monkeys. Two groups of monkeys were trained to respond under a fixed-interval schedule of food presentation. In one group, responding was suppressed (punished) by superimposing a fixed-ratio schedule of response-produced shock. Dose-effect curves were determined for all three drugs by administering cumulative doses i.v. during timeout periods that preceded sequential components of the fixed-interval schedule. Low and intermediate doses of CGS 9896 (0.03-3.0 mg/kg), lorazepam (0.03-0.3 mg/kg) or zopiclone (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) produced dose-related increases in the rates of both suppressed and nonsuppressed responding. The maximal increases in response rates produced by CGS 9896 were usually less than those produced by either lorazepam or zopiclone. Pretreatment with the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 antagonized the increases in suppressed and nonsuppressed response rates produced normally by intermediate doses of CGS 9896, lorazepam or zopiclone, suggesting that the rate-increasing effects of the three drugs are mediated similarly. CGS 9896 was studied additionally for antagonist activity by administering selected doses before lorazepam or zopiclone. Pretreatment with a high dose of CGS 9896 (5.0 mg/kg) antagonized the rate-increasing effects of both lorazepam and zopiclone, suggesting that CGS 9896 has antagonist effects in addition to its agonist effects at benzodiazepine recognition sites.", 
    "77": "Muscarinic receptors have been purified from calf forebrain plasma cell membranes by affinity chromatography on a dexetimide-agarose gel. SDS-PAGE analysis showed a single 70 kDa band. Monoclonal antibodies have been prepared against these affinity purified 70 kDa protein(s). One antibody, M-35, immunoprecipitated up to 80% of digitonin-solubilized muscarinic receptors. M-35 had agonist-like effects on guinea-pig myometrium: it increased the intracellular cyclic GMP content, decreased prostaglandin-induced cyclic AMP accumulation and caused muscle contractions. The two first effects were inhibited by atropine. M-35 was used to visualize muscarinic receptors at the surface of human fibroblastic cells. In the particular cell line used, the receptors have a low affinity for pirenzepine, were negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase and mediated increase in the phosphatidyl-inositol breakdown.", 
    "78": "This report describes the results obtained with a new photoaffinity ligand for the \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine binding site (PBS), using a digitonin solubilized preparation from rat heart or adrenals. The specific binding activity of the solubilized adrenal preparation is higher than 50 pmol/mg protein, with binding properties and pharmacological specificity identical to the membrane bound PBS. The apparent molecular weight of the solubilized PBS, determined by gel filtration is 215 KDa. The photoaffinity ligand (PK 14105) is a nitrophenyl derivative of PK 11195, which attaches covalently and specifically to all the PBS when cardiac membranes are irradiated with this compound under ultraviolet light. After photolabelling with [3H]PK 14105 and solubilization in SDS of heart or adrenal membranes, gel electrophoresis indicates the existence of a single protein band whose molecular weight (18 KDa) is unaltered by incubation with sulphydryl-reducing or protein cross-linking agents. This molecule seems to be a low molecular weight, acidic protein. Diethylpyrocarbonate decreases partially (60%) the binding of [3H]PK 11195 without affecting [3H] RO5-4864 binding, which implies a vital histidine residue in the binding domain of [3H]-PK 11195. Treatment with phospholipase A2 or mellitin, a stimulant of endogenous PLA2, led to a selective loss of [3H] RO5-4864 binding with no change in the binding of [3H]PK 11195. Such differences between a benzodiazepine ligand and an isoquinoline ligand suggest that these compounds may induce, on binding, different conformational changes in the PBS, which is compatible with the hypothesis that RO5-4864 and PK 11195 may be an agonist and an antagonist respectively at the PBS.", 
    "79": "The GABA receptor of mammalian brain is a ligand-gated channel protein with allosteric binding sites for the benzodiazepines and barbiturate drugs. The receptor is an acidic oligomeric membrane glycoprotein and it has been purified to homogeneity from bovine cerebral cortex, bovine cerebellum and rat cerebral cortex by benzodiazepine affinity chromatography. In each case, extraction and purification with the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS and exogenous phospholipid has demonstrated the coexistence of GABA, benzodiazepine and cage convulsant ligand binding sites on a single protein complex; in addition the allosteric interactions between these sites are preserved in the isolated protein. The receptor has a heterologous structure that is conserved at the subunit level between the aforementioned mammalian species and brain regions. SDS-PAGE has shown that the receptor consists of two subunits, alpha (Mr 53000) and beta (Mr 57000) present in equal stoichiometry. A model consistent with the determination of the molecular weight of the native protein, i.e., Mr 230,000, is that of a tetramer alpha 2 beta 2. [3H]Flunitrazepam and [3H]muscimol have been employed as photoaffinity labels to map the benzodiazepine and GABA binding polypeptides respectively. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies have been raised to the native bovine GABAA receptor and these have been employed for the further characterisation of the receptor protein."
