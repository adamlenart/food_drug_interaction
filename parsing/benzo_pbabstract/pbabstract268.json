A sample of 304 students from rural schools was randomly selected. The mean age for females was 14.7 years (S.D. = 1.71), and for males was 14.4 years (S.D. = 1.62). The data were collected using the Latin-American version of Drug Use Screening Inventory (DUSI). Results showed a high prevalence of past-year alcohol use for both males and females (56.6% and 47.4%, respectively), and a lower prevalence of past-year tobacco use (44.0% and 7.7%). There results also showed a low level of use of solvent inhalants and benzodiazepines. In terms of illicit drugs, males preferred cocaine and marijuana, while females only reported amphetamine use. An analysis of adolescent functioning showed differences among alcohol users and nonusers in behavior patterns and peer relationships. However, no significant differences were found regarding rebellion, depression, and social isolation. The implications of these results are discussed, along with the importance of enhancing prevention, as well as early detection and intervention.",

The compounds are prepared with varying degrees of linker length in order to probe the structural requirements for optimal in vitro anti-tumour activity. Some of these new hybrid compounds showed higher cytotoxic activity than the existing natural and synthetic pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines.",

    "3": "An extensive body of research exists on CNS effects of H1-antagonists. There is great interest in this area due to the well-known adverse CNS effects associated with first-generation H1-antagonists, and the many new second-generation agents claiming to have nonsedative properties. Because the CNS effects of H1-antagonists are complex and cannot be reflected in one measurement, a variety of assessments of CNS function are required. These range from the subjective (e.g., self-rating of drowsiness) to the objective (e.g. 24 h EEG sleep latency, P300), and from the simple (e.g., critical flicker fusion) to the complex (e.g., actual driving). When these tests are applied to the evaluation of the H1-antagonists currently available, it is clear that there is a real distinction between the older first-generation H1-antagonists and the newer second-generation ones. At the recommended dosages, all the second-generation H1-antagonists are clearly less sedating in more patients than their predecessors. These newer medications do not cross the blood-brain barrier readily; are highly specific for H1-receptors; have little to no anticholinergic, antiserotoninergic, or anti-alpha-adrenergic effects; and do not enhance the adverse CNS effects of alcohol or other CNS-active substances such as the benzodiazepines. Since most second-generation H1-antagonists are found to be relatively nonsedating, their benefit/risk ratios will be determined more by their other properties such as non-CNS adverse effects (e.g., potential to cause cardiac arrhythmias), potency, onset of action, duration of action, ease of administration, and cost. The future role and usefulness of the older sedating H1-antagonists, given the availability of the safer second-generation agents, are unclear at the present time. When H1-antagonist treatment is indicated, physicians should recommend an effective H1-antagonist with a favorable clinical pharmacology profile and a wide margin of safety in patients of all ages. The common, often subclinical, adverse CNS effects produced by the old H1-antagonists remain a major concern and, therefore, these compounds are no longer medications of choice in the treatment of allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, or urticaria.", 
    "4": "Cocaine-associated myocardial infarction (CAMI) is a well-reported entity. Most previous reports on CAMI have been limited to conservative care utilizing benzodiazepines, aspirin, nitroglycerin, calcium channel blockers, and thrombolytics. Current guidelines on CAMI advocate immediate use of angiography and angioplasty if available rather than routine administration of thrombolytics. However, based on literature search from 1966 to 2001 (using keywords \"cocaine,\" \"myocardial infarction,\" and \"angioplasty\"), there have been only two case reports of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with cocaine-associated myocardial infarction. Both were notable for complications either during or immediately after the procedure. We report a series of 10 patients with cocaine-associated myocardial infarction who were treated with percutaneous interventions, which included angioplasty, stenting, and AngioJet mechanical extraction of thrombus. Despite the different arteriopathic process involved, our findings suggest that PCI can be performed safely and with a high degree of procedural success in patients with CAMI.",

    "6": "Previous work has shown that intragastric administration of Zingicomb, a preparation consisting of Zingiber officinale and Ginkgo biloba extracts, has anxiolytic-like properties. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of acute treatment with this preparation on inhibitory avoidance learning. The influence of pre-trial administered Zingicomb (ZC) on inhibitory avoidance conditioning was investigated in adult male Wistar rats, with a one-trial step-through avoidance task. The animals were treated intragastrically with either vehicle, 0.5, 1, 10 or 100 mg/kg ZC 60 min prior to the acquisition trial. When tested 24 h after training, rats which had received 10 mg/kg ZC exhibited significantly longer step-through latencies than vehicle treated animals. This result, thus, demonstrates the beneficial effects of Zingicomb on conditioned inhibitory avoidance. Unlike conventional anxiolytic drugs, such as the benzodiazepines, which tend to have amnesic properties, this phytopharmacon is a potent anxiolytic agent which, additionally, can facilitate performance on a learning task, indicating promising clinical applications.", 
    "7": "A specific and sensitive direct-injection high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS/MS) method has been developed for the rapid identification and quantitative determination of olanzapine, clozapine, and N-desmethylclozapine in human plasma. After the addition of the internal standard dibenzepin and dilution with 0.1% formic acid, plasma samples were injected into the LC/MS/MS system. Proteins and other large biomolecules were removed during an online sample cleanup using an extraction column (1 x 50 mm i.d., 30 microm) with a 100% aqueous mobile phase at a flow rate of 4 mL/min. The extraction column was subsequently brought inline with the analytical column by automatic valve switching. Analytes were separated on a 5 microm Symmetry C18 (Waters) analytical column (3.0 x 150 mm) with a mobile phase of acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid (20:80, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The total analysis time was 6 min per sample. The inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation for all compounds were <11%. By eliminating the need for extensive sample preparation, the proposed method offers very large savings in total analysis time.", 
    "8": "Vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 and benzodiazepine binding site expressions were examined with quantitative autoradiography in postmortem striata from 19 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies, seven patients with dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease, 12 patients with Alzheimer's disease, and eight neurologically normal subjects. Striatal vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 expression in dementia with Lewy bodies and in dementia with Lewy bodies plus Alzheimer's disease was reduced significantly, indicating degeneration of nigrostriatal projections. Striatal benzodiazepine binding site expression was unchanged, indicating preserved intrinsic striatal neuropil. Vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 and benzodiazepine binding site expressions were each preserved in Alzheimer's disease striatum. We conclude that dementia with Lewy bodies may be distinguished from Alzheimer's disease by postmortem examination or by future in vivo measurements of the striatal vesicular monoamine transporter type 2.", 
    "9": "Schizophrenia has been treated effectively with atypical neuroleptics without serious side effects. We have shown previously that long-term treatment with atypical neuroleptics is correlated with an improvement of cognition in adult rats. We report here that atypical neuroleptics stimulate a 2- to 3-fold increase in newly divided cells in the subventricular zone in the rat and that some of these new cells in the subventricular zone and hippocampus also express a neuronal marker. We used bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to identify newly divided cells and confirmed the observation with antibody to a cell-cycle-specific, endogenous proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Identification of BrdU-positive cells in the anterior subventricular zone (SVZa) particularly in rats treated with the atypical neuroleptics but not in those in the haloperidol-treated and control rats, suggests increased rostral migratory stream (RMS) cell traffic to replenish neurons in the olfactory bulb. Expression of a neuronal marker, NeuN, in BrdU-positive cells in rats treated with atypical neuroleptics, also suggests that these compounds may modulate in vivo differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells even within a day of BrdU injection. Our results indicate that atypical neuroleptics have a mechanism of action other than the previously proposed mechanisms, which might explain their role in improved cognition in animal and in schizophrenic patients. If substantiated by future studies, our findings may lead to an expanded use of atypical neuroleptics in other neurodegenerative diseases to stimulate neuronal replacement and repair.", 
    "10": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF), a potent bioactive phospholipid implicated in neuronal excitotoxic death, was assessed as a mediator of brain mitochondrial dysfunction. Carbamyl PAF, a non-hydrolyzable PAF analog, added to neurons in culture resulted in decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(M)) as measured by the DeltaPsi(M)-sensitive fluorophore 5,5', 6,6'-tetrachloro-1, 1', 3,3'-tetraethylethylbenzimidazolo-carbocyanide iodide (JC-1). To investigate whether PAF has a direct effect on the mitochondria, the mediator was added to rat brain mitochondria preparations and an increase in the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane, termed permeability transition (PT), and cytochrome c release were measured. We report that PAF causes both dose-dependent PT and cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria. Furthermore, the selective PAF antagonist tetrahydro-4,7,8,10 methyl-1 (chloro-2 phenyl)-6 (methoxy-4 phenyl-carbamoyl)-9 pyrido [4',3'-4,5] thieno [3,2-f] triazolo-1,2,4 [4,3-a] diazepine-1,4 (BN50730), which has affinity for intracellular binding sites, and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands 7-chloro-5- [4'-chlorophenyl]-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (Ro5-4864) and 1-(-2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide (PK11195), inhibit PAF induction of PT and cytochrome c release. These results suggest that PAF excitotoxicity involves, at least in part, alterations of the mitochondrial membrane.", 
    "11": "Acute GABA transporter inhibition can induce anxiolytic-like behaviors. The present analysis addressed whether chronic treatment (23 days via drinking water) with a GABA transporter inhibitor affects rat behavior similar to acute treatment and interferes with additional benzodiazepine-receptor agonistic treatment. Seventy-one rats divided into seven groups were acutely treated with either vehicle, diazepam (2 mg/kg), zolpidem (0.05 mg/kg), tiagabine (19 mg/kg) or chronically with tiagabine with or without acute diazepam or zolpidem. Animals were behaviorally characterized in an elevated plus-maze. None of the treatments induced changes in the activity of the animals. Acute and chronic treatment with tiagabine induced anxiolytic-like effects, similar to acute doses of diazepam. Acute diazepam did not enhance chronic tiagabine effects, whereas acute zolpidem attenuated the anxiolytic-like effects of chronic tiagabine. It is concluded that anxiolytic effects of acute GABA-uptake inhibition by tiagabine persist under chronic treatment and are sensitive to concomitant use of benzodiazepine receptor ligands.", 
    "12": "The changes in extracellular acetylcholine levels were investigated by microdialysis in the cortex and hippocampus of aging rats after administration of metrifonate (80 mg/kg), rivastigmine (0.75 mg/kg), donepezil (1.5 mg/kg) or vehicle for 21 days (twice daily p.o.). Eighteen h after the last administration, cholinesterase inhibition was 85, 52 and 39% after metrifonate, rivastigmine and donepezil, respectively, and was accompanied by 988, 590 and 75% increase in cortical acetylcholine level. In the hippocampus, metrifonate and rivastigmine brought about a 169 and 108% increase in acetylcholine levels. A challenge dose of metrifonate, rivastigmine and donepezil was followed by a further increase in cortical and hippocampal acetylcholine levels. The retrograde perfusion of the M(2)-M(4) receptor antagonist AFDX-384 (10 microM) induced a 500 and 300% increase in cortical and hippocampal acetylcholine release, in control and rivastigmine-treated rats, respectively, no increase in metrifonate-treated rats, and a 210% increase in donepezil-treated rats. In conclusion, chronic treatment of aging rats with metrifonate, rivastigmine and donepezil induces a long-lasting increase in acetylcholine levels, and reveals marked differences between the three drugs.",

Our data also reveal novel and heretofore unexpected interactions of pure compounds in SJW at a number of GPCRs, transporters, and ion channels. We hypothesize that additive or synergistic actions of different single compounds may be responsible for the antidepressant efficacy of SJW. These results and this general approach may impact our understanding of phytomedicines in general and H. perforatum specifically.", 
    "18": "1. The pharmacology of the cholecystokinin CCK(1) receptors endogenously expressed in human gallbladder and human ascending colon smooth muscle tissue was compared using radioligand binding assays. 2. Saturation analysis of the interaction between the radiolabelled, selective CCK(1)-receptor antagonist, [(3)H]-L-364,718, and enriched gastrointestinal tissue membranes suggested the presence of multiple binding sites in human colon but not human gallbladder. 3. Competition studies, using a range of structurally diverse, CCK-receptor selective ligands provided further evidence for CCK(1) receptor heterogeneity in human colon tissue (n(H) values significantly less than unity for SR27897=0.77+/-0.07, 2-NAP=0.73+/-0.03, YM220=0.70+/-0.09 and PD-134,308=0.83+/-0.01). Moreover, the competition data for SR27897, 2-NAP and YM220 were consistent with the interaction of these compounds at two binding sites. In contrast, in the human gallbladder assay, a single binding site model provided a good fit of the competition curve data obtained with all the CCK receptor selective compounds. 4. The data obtained are consistent with the presence of a single CCK(1) receptor binding site in the gallbladder but not in the colon. A two-site analysis of the colon data, indicated that one of the two sites was indistinguishable from that characterized in the gallbladder. The molecular basis of the apparent receptor heterogeneity in the colon remains to be established.", 
    "19": "In mice, the elevated plus-maze paradigm was used to investigate the effect of scopolamine hydrobromide and diazepam and their interaction with oxiracetam on the retrieval of spatial memory trace. This paradigm measures (using the transfer latency) an animal's capacity to escape from the open arm to the enclosed one. The retention session followed 24 h after the acquisition one. Experiment 1: Scopolamine (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) given 30 min before the retention session significantly prolonged the transfer latency as compared with the saline treated mice and those given the lowest dose of scopolamine (0.125 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.25 mg/kg). Experiment 2: Oxiracetam administered at doses of 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg immediately after the acquisition session prevented the scopolamine induced prolongation of the transfer latency. Thus, oxiracetam forestalled the impairment of retrieval of memory trace: the animals were able to remember the spatial configuration of the plus-maze. On the contrary, oxiracetam was not effective in the diazepam treated mice. We suggest that beneficial effect of oxiracetam might be confounded or blocked by the anxiolytic effect of diazepam.", 
    "20": "NKP608 is a potent, selective and orally active non-peptidic neurokinin-1 (NK1)-receptor antagonist for which anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects have been described in various animal models in rats. Since species differences have been reported for some NK1-receptor antagonists, NKP608 was tested here in the social investigation test in gerbils, in a species in which the NK1-receptor is close to the human receptor. NKP608 (0.01 to> or =0.3 mg/kg p.o.) increased the time investigating the partner comparable to that seen following treatment with chlordiazepoxid (7 mg/kg p.o.), thus clearly indicating that NKP608 also has a robust anxiolytic effect in the social investigation test in gerbils. Such findings are in line with previous data obtained in rats, extend them to gerbils and corroborate the potential of NKP608 (and other representatives of the class of NK1-receptor antagonists) as new therapeutic agents beneficial in psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and/or depression.",

The comparison between the spectral features of normal brain and the ones of samples with administrated substance has unambiguously showed that the CH stretching region seems not to suffer from any change for the pharmacological treatment, instead the OH band is strongly modified probably due to the presence of a new spectral contribution characteristic of diazepam molecule.",

Flunitrazepam (FM2), along with other two benzodiazepines (triazolam and brotizolam), is placed on Schedule III. The aim of the present study was to analyze the pattern of flunitrazepam prescriptions across all medical subspecialty departments at Taipei Medical University-Wan Fang Hospital (TMU-WFH), Taiwan. We analyzed 1170 prescriptions over 12 month period from 1 July 2000 to 31 May 2001. All prescription data were divided into three 4 month periods: period I was when the flunitrazepam prescription was not controlled, period II represented the time when flunitrazepam was placed on Schedule III and when physicians were required to use a special duplicated prescription form and period III was when the TMU-WFH started to set a stricter control for the prescription of flunitrazepam. The results indicated that the number of flunitrazepam prescriptions during period III had decreased significantly compared with period I (P < or = 0.05). Eventually, 45.7% of flunitrazepam-medicated patients were followed up monthly with a restriction of their flunitrazepam supply to no more than 14 days, 22.9% of patients were followed up fortnightly at clinics with a 14 day supply of flunitrazepam, 15.7% were followed up fortnightly with a 14 day restriction of flunitrazepam plus a non-flunitrazepan benzodiazepine supplement, 10.7% were referred to clinics within the Department of Psychiatry and 5% were switched from flunitrazepam to other drugs.", 
    "37": "In recent years generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) has become a much better defined disorder, with specific criteria distinguishing it from the other anxiety disorders; however, it still lacks the same public and scientific interests as some of the other anxiety disorders such as panic and social phobia. Nevertheless, refinement in the treatment of GAD is becoming more evident through the conduct of clinical trials. Up until the mid-1980's, treatment consisted primarily of benzodiazepines. However, as a result of growing characterisation of their abuse potential, other therapeutic options were explored. Benzodiazepines became seen as an effective short-term therapy, and buspirone and some of the newer antidepressants have become the treatment of choice for patients with GAD requiring long-term treatment. Buspirone was the first available alternative to the benzodiazepines in the US; however, the initial excitement over this agent was somewhat dampened because of its mild efficacy combined with a slow onset of action. The antidepressants were seen as beneficial for the treatment of GAD because of the high comorbidity with depression, thus allowing a better outcome for these patients. The antidepressants that offer both a good adverse effect profile and efficacy are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors including paroxetine, and the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as venlafaxine. Clinicians should also consider the potential benefits of psychotherapy as an adjunct to medication. There are a number of potentially new pharmacotherapies being investigated, including newer serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonists, cholecystokinin receptor antagonists, neurokinin receptor antagonists, gabapentin and its analogues, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor modulators. However, these compounds are all in the early stages of investigation, and there are no new therapies expected to be released in the near future. Nonetheless, in the search for the ideal anxiolytic, a more positive outlook is allowed by imminent future research for new treatment options in patients with GAD.",

A total of 166 subjects ranging in age from 20 to 40 years were examined. All subjects were institutionalized, and 70.4% (n = 117) participated in a preventive program designed by the educators of the center. This consisted of weekly fluoride mouthrinses (0.2%) and control of dental plaque by toothbrushing with a fluoride toothpaste. The mean DMFT index for the whole sample was 5.97. Subjects in the oldest age group had the highest DMFT index and the lowest filled component. There were no significant differences in the DMFT index and its components between the subjects who received a weekly fluoride mouthrinse (n = 117) and those who did not (n = 49). Comparison of subjects who had cerebral palsy, Down Syndrome, and idiopathic developmental delay (n = 157) found a significantly lower DMFT index (p < 0.05) in the persons with Down Syndrome compared with the other special-needs groups. Other factors which could influence the results-such as fluoride use, oral hygiene, and administration of benzodiazepines-were also analyzed. An analysis of the results revealed a moderately high prevalence of caries in the whole sample that was lower than that in a national survey. This could be attributed to strict dietary control of sugar in the study population.",

The aim of the study was to discover whether the systemic administration of a benzodiazepine agent alprazolam increases the systemic analgesic efficacy of non-opioid analgesic ibuprofen. Experimental studies combining these agents have not yet been published. We used three experimental methods - writhing test (with acetic acid), tail-flick test and plantar test to assess analgesic action. The drugs were administered orally. Augmentation of the analgesic effect of ibuprofen by alprazolam was proved for the writhing test at a dose of 30 mg/kg of ibuprofen and alprazolam 1 mg/kg. The reaction time of the combination was significantly prolonged in comparison with ibuprofen alone. The results of the tail-flick test and plantar test were negative. The effect of ibuprofen was not enhanced by alprazolam in tests of acute thermal pain. Our results have demonstrated that the analgesic action of ibuprofen is only weakly enhanced by alprazolam.",

Recently, we discovered that a single episode of ethanol intoxication lasting for several hours can trigger a massive wave of apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing rat or mouse brain. The window of vulnerability coincides with the developmental period of synaptogenesis, also known as the brain growth-spurt period, which in rodents is a postnatal event, but in humans extends from the sixth month of gestation to several years after birth. We propose that the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist and gamma-aminobutyric (GABA)mimetic properties of ethanol are responsible for its apoptogenic action, in that we have found that other drugs that block NMDA glutamate receptors or mimic GABA at GABA(A) receptors also trigger apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing brain. Our findings have clinical significance, not only because they can explain the reduced brain mass and neurobehavioral disturbances associated with the human FAS, but because many agents in the human environment, other than ethanol, have NMDA antagonist or GABAmimetic properties. Such agents include drugs that may be abused by pregnant mothers [phencyclidine (angel dust), ketamine (Special K), nitrous oxide (laughing gas), barbiturates, benzodiazepines], and many medicinals used in obstetric and pediatric neurology (anticonvulsants), and anesthesiology (all general anesthetics are either NMDA antagonists or GABAmimetics).", 
    "43": "It is known that many male juvenile delinquents commit violent crimes while intoxicated with flunitrazepam (FZ), often in combination with alcohol or other drugs. We have also noted the combined abuse of FZ with, for example, alcohol in male forensic psychiatric patients. Our objective was to study violent behavior, impulsive decision-making, and amnesia in male forensic psychiatric patients who were intoxicated predominantly with FZ, to increase knowledge of the abuse of FZ in vulnerable subjects. We studied five forensic psychiatric patients, all of whom were assessed in 1998. All of the subjects reported earlier reactions to FZ, including hostility and anterograde amnesia. At the time of their crimes they were all intoxicated with FZ, often in combination with alcohol or other drugs, such as amphetamine or cannabis. In contrast to their behavior based on their ordinary psychological characteristics, their crimes were extremely violent, and the subjects lacked both the ability to think clearly and to have empathy with their victims. Our observations support the view that FZ abuse can lead to serious violent behavior in subjects characterized by vulnerable personality traits, and that this effect is confounded by the concurrent use of alcohol or other drugs. It is evident that FZ causes anterograde amnesia. Previous research and the results presented herein allow us to draw the following conclusion: on the basis of the neuropsychopharmacologic properties of FZ, legal decisions, such as declaring FZ an illegal drug, are needed in countries where it is now legal.", 
    "44": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the mechanisms underlying weight gain induced by the atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine. We performed euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp combined with indirect calorimetry on a 48-year-old male with antisocial personality disorder, alcohol dependence and paranoid ideation before and after one month of olanzapine (10 - 15 mg/day) therapy. The patient gave his informed, written consent for this study. The results were a weight gain of 6 kg and a decrease in both basal (from 1673 to 1613 kcal/24 h) and 3-hour (from 22.8 to 20.2 cal/kg fat free mass/min) energy expenditure. Serum thyroid hormone and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased, and the triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased. Insulin sensitivity did not change. We conclude that decreased basal energy expenditure may contribute to weight gain in olanzapine treatment.",

She was treated with olanzapine from the 24th week until 10 days prior to delivery. No adverse events occurred during pregnancy or delivery. The Apgar score was 8/10 at one minute and 9/10 at 5 minutes.", 
    "46": "Drug monitoring in psychiatry usually serves psychoactive drug plasma concentration measurement. Anticholinergic properties offer a faster approach to monitoring pharmacodynamic intraindividual effects of the drug by measuring their effects on heart rate variability (HRV), which is sympathetically and parasympathetically controlled via cholinergic synapses. The plasma concentrations of the atypical antipsychotics clozapine and olanzapine correlated with parameters of HRV in 59 patients suffering from schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. HRV during 4 minutes at rest was extracted from the ECG trace of a routine digital EEG registration in addition to blood sampling for plasma concentration measurement (HPLC method). We calculated sympathetically and parasympathetically controlled heart frequency bands (low, medium and high frequency) and other HRV parameters, coefficient of variation (CV), and root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD). All HRV parameters were significantly more impaired in clozapine patients (n = 33, mean clozapine plasma concentration 331 +/- 294 ng/ml) than in olanzapine patients (n = 26, mean olanzapine plasma concentration 42 +/- 32 ng/ml) and demonstrated 1.7 - 4.8 times the cardiac anticholinergic properties of clozapine in vivo. 14 out of 14 patients with a CV beyond 3.2 % had clozapine plasma concentrations below the proposed optimal therapeutic concentration of 350 ng/ml. All HRV parameters were inversely and significantly correlated with the clozapine plasma concentrations (such as lgCV: r = - 0.73, p < 0.001) and, to a lesser extent, with the olanzapine plasma concentrations (lgCV r = - 0.44, p < 0.05). These results underline the potential clinical value of HRV parameter extraction from routine ECGs in predicting plasma concentrations and objective individual neurocardiac effects of drugs with anticholinergic properties.", 
    "47": "Aggressive behavior is frequently observed in schizophrenic patients. More than 50 % of all psychiatric patients and 10 % of schizophrenic patients show aggressive symptoms varying from threatening behavior and agitation to assault. The pharmacological treatment of acute, persisting and repetitive aggression is a serious problem for other patients and staff members. Not only is violent behavior from mentally ill patients the most detrimental factor in their stigmatization, aggression is also a considerable direct source of danger for the patients themselves. Based on rather limited evidence, a wide variety of medications for the pharmacological treatment of aggression has been recommended: typical and atypical antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, beta-blockers and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Most clinical information on treating aggression has been collected for atypical neuroleptics, particularly for clozapine. Several retrospective and open studies indicate its efficacy. Treatment duration of 6 months is recommended to induce a stable reduction of physical and verbal aggression. Severe side effects have very rarely been seen. At the moment, clozapine seems to be the first choice in aggression treatment. Within the last few years, about 10 articles were published showing that this is the most effective antiaggressive agent in the treatment of aggression and agitation in psychiatric patients, independent of psychiatric diagnosis. However, clozapine, like all the other substances used, does not have an established indication for the treatment of aggressive symptoms. Noncompliance with medication makes it difficult to choose the right preparation for the medication: tablets, liquids, intramuscular injections and readily soluble \"FDDFs\" are available. Ethical, juridical and methodological problems prevent controlled studies from establishing a reference in the treatment of aggression in mentally ill patients. This review summarizes the current discussion and publications on the pharmacological treatment of aggression in schizophrenic patients of the last 20 years. In addition, we will briefly present studies and case reports concerning the treatment of aggression in other psychiatric patients.",

    "50": "Electromyographic recordings from the abductor pollicis brevis muscle were made during focal transcranial magnetic stimulation to the contralateral motor cortex and during bilateral cortical stimulation. Twenty patients on each drug and 22 controls were studied with measures of the resting motor threshold, motor evoked potential size, post-excitatory silent period duration, cortical inhibition and facilitation to paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcallosal inhibition.", 
    "51": "The patient groups differed from the controls in the silent period and transcallosal inhibition measures, both of which assess cortical inhibitory activity. The two medication groups differed in the magnitude of the resting motor threshold and several measures of transcallosal inhibition that reflect the spread of inhibitory activity between hemispheres.", 
    "52": "These findings suggest that olanzapine and risperidone differ subtly in their effects on cortical inhibitory mechanisms. Further evaluation is required to establish whether these differences may reflect or underlie differences seen between these medications in their clinical profiles, including their effects on cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.", 
    "53": "In this report, we determined whether leptin could modify the exocrine pancreatic secretion of anaesthetized rats in vivo. Intravenous injection of recombinant murine leptin resulted in a time- and dose-dependent stimulation of exocrine pancreatic secretion, maximally observed with 30 nmol/kg of leptin. This stimulation of pancreatic water, bicarbonate, and protein output was abolished by atropine, hexamethonium, L364,718 ([3S(-)-N-(1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine]), a cholecystokinin CCK(1) receptor antagonist or perivagal capsaicin pretreatment, but unaffected by the CCK(2) receptor antagonist L365,260 ([3R(+)-N-(2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepin-3yl)-N'-(3-methylphenyl)urea]). In addition, the physiological dose of 3 nmol/kg leptin, ineffective per se, potentiated the secretory effect of 45 pmol/kg of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) on exocrine pancreatic secretion. Furthermore, intraperitoneal leptin induced a rapid increase in plasma CCK levels in vivo in the rat. In conclusion, exogenous leptin can modulate exocrine pancreatic secretion through mechanisms involving CCK(1) receptors and capsaicin-sensitive afferent fibres in the rat. Whether this may have a physiological relevance in the postprandial regulation of exocrine pancreatic secretion and thus in nutrient digestion will require further investigations.", 
    "54": "Previous studies in 5-HT(1A) receptor knockout (1AKO) mice on a mixed Swiss Websterx129/Sv (SWx129/Sv) and a pure 129/Sv genetic background suggest a differential gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A))-benzodiazepine receptor complex sensitivity in both strains, independent from the anxious phenotype. To further investigate these discrepancies, various GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor ligands were tested in different behavioral paradigms in 1AKO and wild type (WT) mice on a 129/Sv background. 1AKO and WT mice responded comparably to alprazolam, flumazenil, alcohol and pentylenetetrazol as measured in the stress-induced hyperthermia paradigm. In addition, sedative-anesthetic effects of pentobarbital measured via the righting reflex were similar and a selected dose of diazepam exerted similar anxiolytic effects in both genotypes in the elevated plus maze. In conclusion, 1AKO mice on a 129/Sv background have undisturbed GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor sensitivity in contrast to those described on a mixed Swiss Websterx129/Sv background. The anxious phenotype of 1AKO mice seems to occur independent of the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex functioning.", 
    "55": "Increasing evidence suggests that astrocytes are the site of early dysfunction and damage in manganese neurotoxicity. Astrocytes accumulate manganese by a high affinity, high capacity, specific transport system. Chronic exposure to manganese leads to increased pallidal signal hyperintensities on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images and selective neuronal loss in basal ganglia structures together with characteristic astrocytic changes known as Alzheimer type II astrocytosis. Manganese is sequestered in mitochondria where it inhibits oxidative phosphorylation. Exposure of astrocytes to manganese results in important changes including (i) decreased uptake of glutamate; (ii) increased densities of binding sites for the \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine receptor (PTBR), a class of receptor localized to mitochondria of astrocytes and involved in oxidative metabolism, mitochondrial proliferation, and neurosteroid synthesis; (iii) increased gene expression and activity of the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), known to be associated with apoptosis; (iv) increased uptake of L-arginine, a precursor of nitric oxide, together with increased expression of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Potential consequences of these alterations in astrocytic gene expression include failure of energy metabolism, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased extracellular glutamate concentration and excitotoxicity which could play a key role in manganese-induced neuronal cell death as a direct result of impaired astrocytic-neuronal interactions.", 
    "56": "Multicolour fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with chromosome-specific DNA-probes can be used to assess aneuploidy (disomy) and diploidy in sperm of any species provided the DNA-probes are available. In the present EU research project, DNA-probes for mouse chromosomes 8, X and Y were employed each labelled with different colours. Male mice were treated with the test chemicals and sperm were sampled from the Caudae epididymes 22-24 days later to allow spermatocytes exposed during meiosis to develop into mature sperm. At present, the data base comprises 10 chemicals: acrylamide (AA), carbendazim (CB), colchicine (COL), diazepam (DZ), griseofulvin (GF), omeprazole (OM), taxol (TX), thiobendazole (TB), trichlorfon (TF) and vinblastine (VBL). Of these, COL and TF induced disomic sperm only. DZ and GF induced disomic and diploid sperm, while CB and TB induced diploid sperm only. VBL gave contradictory results in repeated experiments in an inter-laboratory comparison. AA, OM and TX did not induce an increase in disomic or diploid sperm at the doses used. The induction of aneuploidy by DZ was also tested in humans. Sperm samples from patients after attempted suicide and from patients with chronic Valium((R)) abuse were evaluated using human DNA-probes specific for chromosomes 1,16, 21, X and Y. A quantitative comparison between mouse and man indicates that male meiosis in humans is 10-100 times more sensitive than in mice to aneuploidy induction by DZ. The positive response of mice to TF supports the hypothesis by Czeizel et al. [Lancet 341 (1993) 539] that TF may be causally related to the occurrence of congenital abnormality clusters in a Hungarian village.", 
    "57": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), an integral protein of the mitochondrial membrane, is involved in the formation of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pores. The opening of the MPT-leading to the dissipation of the inner-mitochondrial transmembrane potential (deltapsi(m))-is considered to be an early apoptotic event. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the high-affinity PBR ligands Ro5-4684 and PK 11195 on tamoxifen (TAM)-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 and BT-20 breast cancer cell lines. Application of 100 nM TAM led to induction of apoptosis in both cell lines. Estrogene receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 cells arrested in G(2/M) by TAM treatment showed no general dissipation of deltapsi(m), but reduction of deltapsi(m) was observed in a population of cells with high deltapsi(m). In ER-negative BT-20 cells TAM treatment induced no arrest of the cell cycle but dissipation of deltapsi(m). In both cell lines, nanomolar concentrations of the PBR ligands, which showed minor pro-apoptotic action themselves, reduced TAM-induced decrease of deltapsi(m) and apoptosis. In MCF-7 cells, a reduction of bcl-2 protein expression by TAM treatment was abolished by a combination of TAM with PBR ligands. Bax protein expression in BT-20 cells showed a significant increase in TAM-treated cells after 24hr but was not increased when treated with TAM and PBR ligands. From these findings, we concluded that binding of PBR ligands in nanomolar concentrations protects cells against apoptosis.",

A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed by using return to baseline for both activity and food intake 24 hours after the procedure as the effectiveness measure.", 
    "60": "The groups had similar physiological outcomes and satisfaction. Patients receiving propofol had shorter recovery times (P < 0.001) and a higher recovery of both baseline activity level and dietary intake 24 hours after the procedure (P = 0.028). With incremental cost-effectiveness analysis, gastroenterologist-administered propofol cost an additional $403.00 per additional patient at 100% of baseline for both activity level and food intake when compared with standard sedation and analgesia. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the only model in which propofol administration would become the dominant strategy was with its administration by a registered nurse.", 
    "61": "Gastroenterologist-administered propofol using monitoring with capnography is similar to meperidine/midazolam for both physiological outcomes and patient/endoscopist satisfaction.

When compared to costs incurred in the previous 12 months of therapy, patients experienced savings of almost $900 per month during the 49 weeks of olanzapine therapy. These cost savings were largely driven by reductions in in-patient costs during the open label extension. Health-related quality of life improvements measured by the SF-36 were seen on several dimensions both in the 3-week acute phase as well as in the 49-week open label extension.",

    "71": "Conventional antidepressant treatment fails for up to 30% of patients with major depression. When there are concomitant psychotic symptoms, response rates are even worse. Thus, subsequent treatment often includes combinations of antidepressants or augmentation with antipsychotic agents. Atypical antipsychotic agents such as olanzapine cause fewer extrapyramidal adverse effects than conventional antipsychotics; for that reason, they are an advantageous augmentation strategy for treatment-resistant and psychotic depression. The purpose of this study was to assess the potential for pharmacokinetic interaction between olanzapine and fluoxetine, a popular antidepressant that is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. The pharmacokinetics of 3 identical single therapeutic doses of olanzapine (5 mg) were determined in 15 healthy nonsmoking volunteers. The first dose of olanzapine was taken alone, the second given after a single oral dose of fluoxetine (60 mg), and the third given after 8 days of treatment with fluoxetine 60 mg, qd. Olanzapine mean Cmax was slightly higher (by about 18%) and mean CL/F was slightly lower (by about 15%) when olanzapine was coadministered with fluoxetine in single or multiple doses. Olanzapine mean t((1/2)) and median t(max) did not change. Although the pharmacokinetic effects of fluoxetine on olanzapine were statistically significant, the effects were small and are unlikely to modify olanzapine's safety profile. The mechanism of influence is consistent with an inhibition of CYP2D6, which is known to control a minor pathway of olanzapine metabolism.",

A reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method has been developed to determine the time-course of plasma concentrations of derivatives 2a and 2b administered intraperitoneally to Sprague-Dawley rats. The separation of compounds studied and a N-methyl-2,3-benzodiazepin-4-one derivative as internal standard (I.S.) from plasma, were carried out by liquid-liquid extraction using diethyl ether. The samples were injected onto the analytical column (Partisil 10 ODS) eluted with acetonitrile/0.01 M acetate buffer (pH 5.3) at a flow-rate of 2 ml/min and detected at 240 nm. Compounds 2a, 2b and I.S. gave retention times of 8.5, 5.25 and 11.1 min, respectively. The selectivity of the method was satisfactory. The mean recovery from spiked rat plasma ranged from 86.7 to 91.6% for 2a, and from 85.1 to 87.0% for 2b. The procedures were validated with a good reproducibility and linear response from 0.0625 to 2 microg/ml, with a regression coefficient of 0.9932 for 2a and 0.9854 for 2b. The lower limit of quantification (LOQ) was taken as 15 ng/ml for the two compounds. 2a and 2b showed no signs of significant degradation in rat plasma during storage at -20 degrees C and following freeze/thaw cycles. Moreover, plasma levels of the tested compounds have been correlated with their anticonvulsant activity, determined in vivo in genetically epilepsy-prone rats. Due to its sensitivity, the method was suitable for application to pharmacokinetic study.",

After administration of CCK-8 (0.7 nmol/L), the SPA, SPN, and CA of duodenal segment did not exhibit obvious changes. But CCK-8 could selectively antagonize the effects of morphine, ie, the SPA and SPN were increased again, followed by an increase of CA.

Sixteen volunteers completed a randomized, double-blind, crossover study and on four separate occasions received either 100 mg sumatriptan, 20 mg rizatriptan or 20 mg temazepam. The main parameters were eye movements, EEG, body sway, visual analogue scales and a cognitive test battery. Rizatriptan and sumatriptan decreased saccadic peak velocity by 18.3 (95% CI: 5.7, 30.8) and 15.0 (2.2, 27.9) degrees/sec, respectively, about half the decrease induced by temazepam (35.0 (22.1, 47.8) degrees/sec). Body sway increased (30% for rizatriptan (16%, 45%) and 14% for sumatriptan (1%, 27%), respectively). Temazepam caused larger, similar effects. In contrast to temazepam, sumatriptan and rizatriptan decreased reaction times of recognition tasks and increased EEG alpha power (significant for sumatriptan, 0.477 (0.02, 0.935). Therapeutic doses of sumatriptan and rizatriptan caused CNS effects indicative of mild sedation. For EEG and recognition reaction times the effects were opposite to temazepam, indicating central stimulation.", 
    "78": "Central administration of corticotropin-releasing hormone increases anxiety-like behaviour and arousal in rodents, and increased anxiety-like behaviour has been shown in mice overproducing corticotropin-releasing hormone on an elevated plus maze and in a dark-light emergence task. However, evidence is accumulating that measures obtained from different anxiety tasks may reflect different aspects of anxiety-like behaviour in animals. We therefore tested mice overproducing corticotropin-releasing hormone in a battery of paradigms, studying spontaneous behaviour after a mild stressor, tasks of innate anxiety-like behaviour (light-dark box), lick suppression (Vogel conflict), conditioned fear, and forced swimming. Exploratory behaviour was studied in a 16-hole board task. Furthermore, pain threshold, water intake, locomotor activity and sensorimotor learning/co-ordination were tested to control for confounding factors. In line with previous findings, increased anxiety-like behaviour of transgenic mice was observed in the light-dark box paradigm. However, no differences were seen in the conflict paradigm. Conditioned fear was decreased 1 h but not 24 h after conditioning in transgenic mice, and immobility was decreased [corrected] in forced swimming in corticotropin-releasing hormone overexpressors. Locomotor activity in a novel open field and on the hole board was reduced in transgenics. Exploratory behaviour (hole pokes) was reduced during initial exploration of an unfamiliar hole board. Moreover, sensorimotor performance on a rotorod was impaired, and water intake was reduced in corticotropin-releasing hormone overproducing mice, while no changes were seen in nociception. No differences in locomotor activity were seen in a second group of mice, tested in a familiar open field. When these animals were challenged with diazepam, transgenic mice were less susceptible to the sedative effects of the drug on locomotor activity. These data suggest that corticotropin-releasing hormone overproduction leads to specific effects in a subset of anxiety paradigms, and that these transgenic mice suffer from a motor deficit in addition to altered anxiety-like behaviour/arousal.", 
    "79": "We have previously demonstrated that kainate receptors (KA-Rs) are acutely inhibited by ethanol (EtOH). Here we show that KA-Rs are also affected by long-term EtOH exposure. Whole-cell recordings of pharmacologically isolated KA-R-mediated currents in cultured hippocampal neurons revealed that exposure to 80 mM EtOH for 3 days followed by a 24 h withdrawal period increased KA-R current densities. Quantitative confocal microscopy showed that expression of GluR6/7 subunits increases after ethanol withdrawal in these neurons. Since KA-Rs control hippocampal excitability and seizure generation, we postulate that upregulation of these receptors may have a role in the pathophysiology of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "80": "The aim of this study was to assess the presence of alcohol, illicit drugs and medicinal drugs among Spanish drivers involved in fatal road accidents between 1991 and 2000. Samples were obtained for 5745 drivers killed in road accidents from January 1991 to December 2000. Of the samples, 91.7% represented males and 8.3% females; 40.7% were under 30 years of age, 31.9% were under 31-50 years of age, 19.5% were over 51 years of age, and for 7.9% the age was unknown. Between 1991 and 2000, some type of psychoactive substance was detected among 50.1% of those drivers killed in road accidents, this being mainly alcohol (43.8%) and, less frequently, illicit drugs (8.8%) and medicinal drugs (4.7%). In all the cases, in which alcohol was detected, combined use with other substances accounted for only 12.5%, whilst in the case of illicit and medicinal drugs, figures representing combined use with other substances were 75.6% for the former and 65.8% for the latter. For one in every three cases (32.0%), a blood alcohol level over 0.8 g/l was recorded; cocaine (5.2%), opiates (3.2%) and cannabis (2.2%) were the three illicit drugs most frequently detected. Among medicinal drugs, were benzodiazepines (3.4%), anti-depressant drugs (0.6%) and analgesics (0.4%). The results show the frequent presence of psychoactive substances, particularly alcohol, among Spanish motor vehicle users involved in fatal road accidents. It should be pointed out that illicit and medicinal drugs in combination with other substances were a common feature.",

A number of adverse effects have been associated with DPH and it may also interfere with BU metabolism. We used lorazepam (median dose 0.022 mg/kg) i.v. or p.o. before each dose and for 24 h after the last dose of BU as seizure prophylaxis to 29 children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The regimen was well tolerated and drowsiness was the only significant side-effect. Twelve patients were able to receive the entire prophylaxis by mouth. No seizure developed during and within 48 h of BU. Concomitant pharmacokinetic studies showed no alternation of the absorption and clearance of BU during lorazepam administration. Lorazepam can be used as an alternative for seizure prophylaxis during high-dose BU treatment.", 
    "82": "The first mutations of the GABA(A) receptor channel linked to familial epilepsy in humans were reported recently (Baulac et al., 2001; Wallace et al., 2001). Preliminary functional analysis of alpha1beta2gamma2 GABA(A) receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes suggested that the gamma2 subunit R43Q mutation abolished current enhancement by the benzodiazepine, diazepam, and that the gamma2 subunit K289M mutation decreased current amplitudes. We used single-channel recording and concentration jump techniques applied to outside out patches to evaluate the impact of these mutations on GABA(A) receptor channel function of the highly conserved rat ortholog subunits expressed in human embryonic kidney cells. When coexpressed with alpha1 and beta3 subunits, no differences were observed between wild-type and mutant GABA(A) receptor current activation rates or rates or extent of desensitization during prolonged (400 msec) GABA application (1 mm). Although deactivation after brief (5 msec) or prolonged (400 msec) GABA application was unaltered by the R43Q mutation, deactivation (a correlate of IPSC duration) was accelerated for the K289M mutation. Faster deactivation was likely a consequence of altered gating, because single-channel openings had shorter mean duration. Interestingly, the R43Q mutation did not alter diazepam potentiation. It did, however, substantially decrease current amplitude, which was not caused by decreased single-channel conductance or open time, suggesting reduced surface expression of functional receptors. The two gamma2 subunit mutations likely produce disinhibition and familial epilepsy by distinct mechanisms, suggesting that maintenance of neuronal inhibition depends not only on the peak amplitude of IPSCs, but also on their time course.", 
    "83": "Long-term depression (LTD) is widely considered a mechanism for experience-induced synaptic weakening in the brain. Recent in vivo studies on glutamic acid decarboxylase [GAD 65 (-/-)] knock-out mice indicates that GABAergic synaptic inhibition is also required for the normal weakening of deprived inputs in the visual cortex. To better understand how GABAergic inhibition might control plasticity, we assessed the status of synaptic inhibition and LTD in visual cortical slices of GAD 65 knock-out mice. We found the following: (1) the efficacy of GABAergic synapses during repetitive activation is reduced in GAD 65 (-/-) mice; (2) the induction of LTD is impaired in the visual cortex of GAD 65 (-/-) mice; and (3) chronic, but not acute, treatment with the benzodiazepine agonist diazepam restores LTD in GAD 65 (-/-) mice. These results suggest that a certain inhibitory tone is required for the induction of LTD in visual cortex. We propose that the lack of visual cortical LTD in GAD 65 (-/-) may account for the lack of experience-dependent plasticity in these mice.",

Time to readmission was measured by the product-limit formula. Although conventional antipsychotics were associated with a lower rehospitalization rate, no significant difference in the one-year rehospitalization rate was observed between the groups. At 180 days after initial discharge, the patients who received olanzapine had a higher rate of rehospitalization than patients who were taking conventional antipsychotics. Conventional antipsychotics were associated with a lower one-year rehospitalization rate than risperidone or olanzapine.",

The difference was statistically significant, and it was largely due to drug and hospitalization costs. Drug costs for patients in the risperidone group underwent a smaller increase than those for patients in the olanzapine group ($991 versus $1,861).

Application of AMPA or kainate to intact cells evoked currents with no apparent desensitization (EC50 of 118 microM for AMPA and 169 microM for kainate). Application of AMPA to patches evoked desensitizing responses with an EC50 of 217 and 88 microM for the peak and steady-state responses, respectively. Kainate-evoked responses of patches displayed no desensitization (EC50 = 162 microM). Cyclothiazide strongly potentiated AMPA-evoked responses and the AMPA-receptor antagonist GYKI 53655 inhibited both AMPA- and kainate-evoked responses (IC50 = 0.5-1.7 microM). Pre-equilibration with GYKI 53655 completely blocked the response to kainate and pretreatment with concanavalin A did not unmask a response mediated by kainate receptors. AMPA- and kainate-evoked currents reversed close to 0 mV. AMPA-evoked peak and steady-state response components in patches displayed linear and outwardly rectifying I-V relations with an RI (ratio of the slope conductances at +40 mV and -60 mV) of 0.96 +/- 0.11 and 5.6 +/- 1.3, respectively. AMPA-evoked currents displayed a voltage-dependent relaxation after steps to positive or negative membrane potentials, indicating that the outward rectification of the steady-state response is caused by a voltage-dependent kinetic parameter of channel gating. Under bi-ionic conditions ([Ca2+](out) = 30 mM, [Cs+)(in) = 171 mM), the reversal potentials of AMPA- and kainate-evoked currents indicated channels with significant Ca2+ permeability (P(Ca)/P(Cs) = 1.9-2.1). Stationary noise analysis indicated that kainate activated channels with an apparent chord conductance of approximately 9 pS. Non-stationary noise analysis indicated that AMPA and glutamate activated channels with apparent chord conductances of approximately 9, approximately 15, approximately 23 and approximately 38 pS. Discrete single-channel gating corresponding to chord conductances of approximately 23 pS could be directly observed in some responses. Thus, our results indicate expression of high-affinity, voltage-sensitive AMPA receptors with significant Ca2+ permeability and relatively large single-channel chord conductances in AII amacrine cells.",

The effects of repeated administration of this drug on the increase in the extracellular concentration of norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex, induced by stress or by the anxiogenic drug FG 7142, were studied in freely moving rats. Exposure to foot-shock stress induced a marked increase (+120%) in the extracellular norepinephrine concentration in the prefrontal cortex of control rats. Long-term administration of venlafaxine (10 mg/kg i.p., once a day for 21 days) reduced the effect of stress on norepinephrine output by 75%. This effect of venlafaxine persisted for at least 5 days after discontinuation of drug treatment. Acute administration of FG 7142 (20 mg/kg i.p.), a benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist, increased norepinephrine output (+90%) in control rats. Chronic treatment with venlafaxine prevented the effect of FG 7142. In contrast, the acute administration of this antidepressant had no effect on the stress- or FG 7142-induced increase in norepinephrine output. These plastic changes in the sensitivity of norepinephrine neurones to foot-shock stress and to an anxiogenic drug may reveal an important neuronal mechanism for the physiological regulation of emotional state. Furthermore, this mechanism might be relevant to the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of venlafaxine.",

It is functional in nature and potentially reversible and symptoms range from subtle personality changes to deep coma. Diagnosis of manifest HE is made on a clinical basis, whereas psychometric tests are required to diagnose subclinical HE (SHE). Paper-pencil tests are frequently used for diagnosing SHE, but they may be inferior to measurements of critical flicker frequency, which pick minimal and low grade manifest HE as a continuum. Pathogenetically, HE is seen as clinical manifestation of low grade chronic cerebral edema, which is accompanied by alterations in glioneuronal communication. Different factors such as ammonia, inflammatory cytokines, benzodiazepines and electrolyte imbalances may precipitate or aggravate glia edema, thereby explaining precipitation of HE episodes by a variety of unrelated factors. Recognition and rigorous treatment of these precipitating factors is the most important measure in HE therapy, which may be augmented by dietary and medical approaches.", 
    "97": "Psychological stress has been found to suppress cell-mediated immune responses that are important in limiting the proliferation of Candida albicans. Since anxiolytic drugs can restore cellular immunity in rodents exposed to stress conditions, we designed experiments conducted to evaluate the effects of alprazolam (1 mg/kg of body weight/day), a central benzodiazepine anxiolytic agonist, on the development of oral candidiasis in Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to a chronic auditory stressor. Animals were submitted to surgical hyposalivation in order to facilitate the establishment and persistence of C. albicans infection. Application of stress and treatment with drugs (placebo or alprazolam) were initiated 7 days before C. albicans inoculation and lasted until the end of the experiments (day 15 postinoculation). Establishment of C. albicans infection was evaluated by swabbing the inoculated oral cavity with a sterile cotton applicator on days 2 and 15 after inoculation, followed by plating on YEPD (yeast extract-peptone-dextrose) agar. Tissue injury was determined by the quantification of the number and type (normal or abnormal) of papillae on the dorsal tongue per microscopic field. A semiquantitative scale was devised to assess the degree of colonization of the epithelium by fungal hyphae. Our results show that stress exacerbates C. albicans infection of the tongues of rats. Significant increases in Candida counts, the percentage of the tongue's surface covered with clinical lesions, the percentage of abnormal papillae, and the colonization of the epithelium by fungal hyphae were found in stressed rats compared to those found in the unstressed rats. Treatment with alprazolam significantly reversed these adverse effects of stress, showing that, besides the psychopharmacological properties of this anxiolytic drug against stress, it has consequences for Candida infection.", 
    "98": "Repetition priming is a basic form of learning associated with decreased neuronal responses following stimulus repetition. In this experiment, we address cholinergic and GABAergic modulation of repetition priming in a face recognition paradigm. In experiment 1, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in combination with pharmacological challenge where participants were given placebo, lorazepam (2mg po), or scopolamine (0.4 mg IV) prior to study. Behavioral data showed intact priming for famous faces in the placebo and lorazepam group but impaired priming following scopolamine. In within-group analyses, a right fusiform region showed a fame by repetition interaction characterized by a response decrease to repetition of famous faces and a response enhancement to repetition of unfamous faces in the placebo group. In subjects treated with lorazepam, a main effect of repetition, driven by response decreases to repetition of famous faces, was seen in this right fusiform region. No significant repetition effects were found after scopolamine. In experiment 2, we further investigated behaviorally the cholinergic impairment of repetition priming. Participants were given either placebo or scopolamine (0.4 mg IV) after study. Behavioral data showed intact priming for famous faces in the placebo and scopolamine group. The results suggest that scopolamine but not lorazepam impair repetition priming for famous faces in a face recognition paradigm. These cholinergic impairments are likely to reflect interference with acquisition processes during study that may co-occur with a modulation of right fusiform decreases to repetition of famous faces.", 
    "99": "Alprazolam is prescribed for the treatment of anxiety and panic disorder. Most users are presumably involved in daily activities such as driving. However, the effects of alprazolam on driving ability have never been investigated. This study was conducted to determine the effects of alprazolam (1 mg) on driving ability, memory and psychomotor performance. Twenty healthy volunteers participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. One hour after oral administration, subjects performed a standardized driving test on a primary highway during normal traffic. They were instructed to drive with a constant speed (90 km/h) while maintaining a steady lateral position within the right traffic lane. Primary performance measures were the Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP) and the Standard Deviation of Speed (SDS). After the driving test, subjective driving quality, mental effort, and mental activation during driving were assessed. A laboratory test battery was performed 2.5 h after treatment administration, comprising the Sternberg Memory Scanning Test, a Continuous Tracking Test, and a Divided Attention Test. Relative to placebo, alprazolam caused serious driving impairment, as expressed by a significantly increased SDLP (F(1,19) = 97.3, p <.0001) and SDS (F(1,19) = 30.4, p <.0001). This was confirmed by subjective assessments showing significantly impaired driving quality (F(1,19) = 16.4, p <.001), decreased alertness (F(1,19) = 43.4, p <.0001), decreased mental activation (F(1,19) = 5.7, p <.03) and increased mental effort during driving (F(1,19) = 26.4, p <.0001). Furthermore, alprazolam significantly impaired performance on the laboratory tests.

Operations lasting up to 2h could be performed in the absence of sophisticated equipment such as pulse oximeters or ventilators in patients on spontaneous ventilation breathing air/oxygen only. After premedication with diazepam, glycopyrrolate and local anaesthesia, and induction with standard doses of ketamine, a maintenance dose of 10-20 microg/kg/min of ketamine proved safe and effective. Emphasis was placed on bedside clinical monitoring, relying heavily on the heart rate. Diazepam, unless contraindicated or risky, remains the only necessary complementary drug to ketamine as it buffers its cardiovascular response and decreases the duration and intensity of operative and postoperative hallucinations. Local anaesthetic blocks were useful in decreasing the requirement for postoperative analgesia. An antisialogue was usually unnecessary in operations lasting up to 2 h, glycopyrrolate being the best choice for its lowest psychotropic and chronotropic effects, especially in a hot climate. Experience in war/tropical settings suggests this technique could be useful in civilian contexts such as outdoor life-saving emergency surgery or in mass casualties where, e.g. amputation and rapid extrication were required.",

In this study in vitro and in vivo approaches were combined in order to investigate if the anti-epileptic mechanism(s) of action of levetiracetam (LEV; Keppra) may involve modulation of inhibitory neurotransmission. 2. GABA- and glycine-gated currents were studied in vitro using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques applied on cultured cerebellar granule, hippocampal and spinal neurons. Protection against clonic convulsions was assessed in vivo in sound-susceptible mice. The effect of LEV was compared with reference anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs): carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproate, clonazepam, phenobarbital and ethosuximide. 3. LEV contrasted the reference AEDs by an absence of any direct effect on glycine-gated currents. At high concentrations, beyond therapeutic relevance, it induced a small reduction in the peak amplitude and a prolongation of the decay phase of GABA-gated currents. A similar action on GABA-elicited currents was observed with the reference AEDs, except ethosuximide. 4. These minor direct effects contrasted with a potent ability of LEV (EC(50)=1 - 10 microM) to reverse the inhibitory effects of the negative allosteric modulators zinc and beta-carbolines on both GABA(A) and glycine receptor-mediated responses. 5. Clonazepam, phenobarbital and valproate showed a similar ability to reverse the inhibition of beta-carbolines on GABA-gated currents. Blockade of zinc inhibition of GABA responses was observed with clonazepam and ethosuximide. Phenytoin was the only AED together with LEV that inhibited the antagonism of zinc on glycine-gated currents and only clonazepam and phenobarbital inhibited the action of DMCM. 6.

    "135": "Adaptive time-frequency approximations offer description of the local structures of a signal in terms of their time and frequency coordinates, widths and amplitudes. These parameters can then be used to select and study electroencephalogram (EEG) structures like sleep spindles or slow wave activity (SWA) with high resolution. Such a detailed description of relevant structures improves on the sensitivity of the traditionally used spectral power estimates and opens new possibilities of investigation. These advantages are illustrated using a double-blind test of the influence of zolpidem and midazolam on sleep EEG, and the results are compared with the traditional approach. The observed decrease of frequency of the SWA under the influence of sleep-inducing drugs gives an example of an effect elusive to classical methodology.", 
    "136": "Atypical neuroleptics share a common feature, showing higher affinity for 5-HT2 receptors than for D2 dopamine receptors, but show considerable differences in their clinical and pharmacological properties. In clinical doses, they occupy serotonergic receptors near saturation, but show considerable differences regarding the D2 receptor occupancies, with clozapine showing the lowest degree of occupation. We assessed serotonergic and dopaminergic receptor responsiveness in two groups of male schizophrenic patients, one treated with the atypical neuroleptic clozapine (14 patients, doses 200-600 mg/d) and the other treated with olanzapine (11 patients, doses 10-30 mg/d). We measured the prolactin responses to the acute administration of a serotonergic drug, clomipramine, and a dopaminergic one, haloperidol. Tests were first performed in the drug-free state, and were repeated after the patients had been treated with stable doses of either drug for six weeks. Clomipramine administration induced significant increases of prolactin in the drug-free state. These responses were eliminated after treatment of the patients with either drug, thereby indicating a high 5-HT receptor occupancy by both clozapine and olanzapine. The prolactin responses to haloperidol were not altered after treatment with clozapine, but were significantly reduced after the olanzapine treatment. The baseline prolactin levels were not influenced by clozapine treatment, and were moderately but significantly increased after treatment with olanzapine. The results indicate that there is a difference between the two drugs in their capacity to block dopamine receptors at the hypothalamus-pituitary level, and match the results obtained by SPECT receptor binding studies for striatal dopamine receptors.", 
    "137": "All surgery provokes various degrees of anxiety for patients. The environment leading up to surgery can affect anxiety levels. We performed a prospective randomized study to compare environmental factors around the time of cataract surgery in order to identify interventions that would minimize stress for patients.", 
    "138": "Patients scheduled to undergo cataract surgery at a university-affiliated hospital in Winnipeg were randomly assigned to 1) receive orally administered lorazepam or a placebo before surgery; 2) listen to relaxing music through headphones or routine background noise before surgery; 3) walk (or go by wheelchair if unable to walk) to the operating room or go by stretcher; and 4) listen to relaxing music through headphones or routine background noise during surgery. Randomization for part 1 was double blind; for parts 2 and 3 the surgeon and anesthetist were blinded, but the patient was not. Patients were asked to rate their anxiety, sedation, nausea and pain on arrival at the preoperative area, about 30 minutes after arrival, on arrival in the operating room and on arrival in the postoperative area, on a visual analogue scale graded from 0 (\"None\" [or \"Wide awake\" in the case of sedation]) to 10 (\"Worst possible\" [or \"Asleep\" in the case of sedation]). Patient satisfaction and willingness to repeat the exact same form of treatment were also rated.", 
    "139": "Of the 19 surgeons in the department 18 agreed to participate; I withdrew during the study. Data were collected for 144 patients aged 26 to 93 years. Anxiety was highest on arrival at the institution and decreased progressively thereafter. Oral sedation and listening to music before surgery were associated with decreased anxiety and increased levels of sedation (p = 0.002). Walking to the operating room provided no benefit over going by stretcher. Listening to music through headphones during surgery was not accepted by many patients and, when used, negatively affected the surgeon's assessment of the patient's ability to cooperate. Surgeons reported movement more often among patients who received oral sedation than among those who did not (chi2 = 0.01). Levels of pain and nausea were extremely low in all patients, and satisfaction was very high. Patients who received regional local anesthesia had less pain and higher satisfaction than those who received topical anesthesia. Willingness to repeat the same treatment was extremely high.", 
    "140": "For patients undergoing cataract surgery, efforts should be directed toward reducing anxiety on arrival at the institution, when it is highest, and not just during surgery. Oral sedation and listening to music before surgery appear to be beneficial. Listening to music through headphones during surgery was not found to be advantageous.", 
    "141": "When exposed to prolonged stress, rats develop gastric ulceration, enhanced colon motility with depletion of its mucin content and signs of physiological and behavioral arousal. In this model, we tested whether antidepressants (fluoxetine and bupropion), anxiolytics (diazepam and buspirone) or the novel nonpeptide corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) type-1 receptor (CRH-R1) antagonist, antalarmin, modify these responses. Fluoxetine, bupropion, diazepam and antalarmin all suppressed stress-induced gastric ulceration in male Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to four hours of plain immobilization. Antalarmin produced the most pronounced anti-ulcer effect and additionally suppressed the stress-induced colonic hypermotility, mucin depletion, autonomic hyperarousal and struggling behavior. Intraperitoneal CRH administration reproduced the intestinal but not the gastric responses to stress while vagotomy antagonized the stress-induced gastric ulceration but not the intestinal responses. We conclude that brain CRH-R1 and vagal pathways are essential for gastric ulceration to occur in response to stress and that peripheral CRH-R1 mediates colonic hypermotility and mucin depletion in this model. Nonpeptide CRH-R1 antagonists may therefore be prophylactic against stress ulcer in the critically ill and therapeutic for other pathogenetically related gastrointestinal disorders such as peptic ulcer disease and irritable bowel syndrome.", 
    "142": "The effects of intravenous administration of variable-dose flumazenil (0, 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, and 0.1 mg/kg) after ketamine (3 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.0 and 0.5 mg/kg) were studied in 18 healthy unmedicated cats from time of administration until full recovery. End-points were chosen to determine whether flumazenil shortened the recovery period and/or modified behaviors previously identified and attributed to midazolam. Overall, flumazenil administration had little effect on recovery or behaviors. One minute after flumazenil administration, all cats were recumbent but a greater proportion of cats which received the highest dose assumed sternal recumbency with head up than any other group. Although not significant, those cats that received the highest flumazenil dose also had shorter mean times for each of the initial recovery stages (lateral recumbency with head up, sternal recumbency with head up and walking with ataxia) than any of the other treatment groups that received midazolam. For complete recovery, flumazenil did decrease the proportion of the cats that was sedated, but did not shorten the time to walking without ataxia. Based on this study, the administration of flumazenil in veterinary practice, at the doses studied, to shorten and/or improve the recovery from ketamine and midazolam in healthy cats cannot be recommended."
