Aniracetam at concentrations of 10(-7) and 10(-8) M, but not at 10(-6) M, significantly augmented LTP. On the other hand, midazolam (10(-9) M) significantly suppressed LTP. The suppressive effect was antagonized by Ro 15-1788 (10(-8) M). Both drugs did not affect the population spikes in the absence of tetanic stimulation at those concentrations. It was suggested that in vitro application of LTP is a feasible model system for evaluating the nootropic activity of drugs.", 
    "1": "The calcium channel antagonist verapamil inhibited [3H]N-methyl scopolamine ([3H]NMS ) binding to muscarinic receptors from both rat brain cortex, an area rich in M1 receptors, and from pons-medulla, an area rich in M2 receptors. Verapamil reduced the dissociation kinetics of [3H]NMS binding in cortical receptors but had no detectable effects on the dissociation kinetics of receptors from the pons-medulla. These data suggest that receptors from the cortex have an allosteric site which regulates the binding kinetics, whereas receptors from the pons-medulla lack this site.", 
    "2": "The daily water intake was reduced in rats by subcutaneous administration of propranolol. The fluid intake after 24 h of dehydration in nephrectomized animals was decreased by propranolol. In intact rats diazepam did not modify the postdehydration water intake. Propranolol injected into subfornical organ decreased water consumption after 24 h of fluid deprivation but did not change the dipsogenic response to carbachol given in the same structure. These results suggest that a beta-adrenoceptor mechanism participates in the regulation of the daily water intake. After a stimulus such as dehydration, beta-blockade modifies water consumption by a non-renal mechanism. This mechanism involves neither a general depressant nervous activity nor a local anesthetic action and could be located in a periventricular structure, the subfornical organ.", 
    "3": "Nine benzodiazepines were tested for their ability to inhibit 45Ca2+ uptake into mouse whole brain synaptosomes and for hypnotic activity as indicated by their ability to produce loss of the righting reflex. Eight of the benzodiazepines significantly inhibited fast-phase voltage-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake and five exhibited hypnotic activity. There was a direct correlation between the hypnotic potency of these five benzodiazepines and their ability to inhibit 45Ca2+ uptake. There does not appear to be a correlation between the anticonvulsant potency of the benzodiazepines and their potency for inhibiting 45Ca2+ uptake. These results support previous findings with other sedative/hypnotic drugs and suggest that inhibition of presynaptic calcium uptake may be linked with hypnotic but not anticonvulsant actions of benzodiazepines.", 
    "4": "The relationships between the pharmacological activities of quazepam and flurazepam and the concentrations of each drug and its major active metabolites in brain and plasma following single oral doses of either drug to mice were investigated. At various time points after either quazepam or flurazepam administration, pharmacological activity was measured by the inhibition of electroconvulsive shock (ECS)-induced seizures. After quazepam, the plasma and brain samples obtained at the same time points were assayed for concentrations of quazepam, 2-oxoquazepam and N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam by specific GLC methods. After flurazepam, the plasma and brain samples were assayed for flurazepam, hydroxyethyl-flurazepam, and N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam, also by specific GLC methods. The results showed that both quazepam and flurazepam were rapidly metabolized and that parent drugs and metabolites were rapidly distributed to the brain. The brain levels of all the benzodiazepines analyzed in this study paralleled plasma levels. After quazepam, pharmacological activity most closely paralleled the combined brain concentrations of quazepam and 2-oxoquazepam rather than N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam levels. In contrast, following the flurazepam dose, activity most closely paralleled N-desalkyl-flurazepam concentrations. From these data, it can be concluded quazepam is distinctly different from flurazepam, and that, in the presence of quazepam and 2-oxoquazepam, N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam does not contribute extensively to the observed pharmacological activity.", 
    "5": "Effects of baclofen on the cortical electrical paroxysm were examined using slices of the guinea pig hippocampus. A very low concentration of baclofen (10(-8) M) readily suppressed spontaneous epileptiform discharges of CA3 pyramidal cells, whereas synaptic transmission between mossy fibers and CA3 pyramidal cells were not affected even by 10(-4) M of this drug. Such a strikingly selective depressant action of baclofen on the epileptiform activity raises a possibility that this drug may be effective in the treatment of epilepsy.", 
    "6": "Alcohol withdrawal is a common condition which often complicates intercurrent illness. Its severity and course are determined largely by the setting in which it occurs. This article discusses the history, pathophysiology, pathogenesis and principles of the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. The importance of environment and basic nursing care are stressed and the use of drugs is discussed. A withdrawal assessment scale is also included.", 
    "7": "The dose-response relationships of diazepam and several of its metabolites were determined in rats trained to discriminate diazepam (3 mg/kg) from saline in a two-lever operant choice task. Generalization of the diazepam stimulus was found to occur with temazepam and oxazepam, which were nearly equipotent with diazepam, and also with desmethyldiazepam, which was about half as potent as diazepam. The hydroxylated metabolites, 4'-hydroxydiazepam and 4'-hydroxydesmethyldiazepam were inactive in doses up to 12 mg/kg. These results show that some diazepam metabolites are quite potent behaviorally and indicate the possibility that these metabolites may contribute to the pharmacological effect of diazepam in vivo.", 
    "8": "Sixty-seven patients with endoscopically proven duodenal ulceration were entered into a double-blind study and randomized to treatment with pirenzepine (PZ) (Gastrozepin; Boehringer Ingelheim) 50 mg twice daily or cimetidine (CM) (Tagamet; Smith Kline & French Laboratories) 400 mg twice daily, given 30 minutes before breakfast and supper. Patients underwent endoscopic examination before entry, at 4 weeks, and at 8 weeks if unhealed at 4 weeks. Once healing was achieved, 43 patients were entered into a single-blind maintenance study with either PZ 50 mg at night or CM 400 mg at night according to their original randomization. CM had a slight, but not significant, advantage over PZ after 4 weeks, but the 8-week data showed identical healing rates. The relapse rate appeared to be higher in the PZ-treated group, but this difference was also not significant. It is suggested that the evening dose of PZ be amended to 50 or perhaps 100 mg before bed in the short-term treatment of duodenal ulcer, and that a dose of 100 mg at night be considered for maintenance therapy in certain high-risk populations.", 
    "9": "The pharmacokinetic parameters of the new 1.4-benzodiazepine metaclazepam (Talis) were investigated. In particular, the question of whether the drug and/or its main metabolite accumulates in the body under steady-state conditions was studied. Two dosage regimens were compared by a randomized two-way crossover design: a once-a-day dosing (15 mg metaclazepam in the evening, = A) versus a twice-a-day dosing (5 mg in the morning plus 10 mg in the evening, = B) over ten days in twelve healthy male volunteers. Plasma levels of metaclazepam and its major biotransformation product, N-desmethylmetaclazepam, were determined. Comparing the treatments, significant differences were found for Cmax, but not for AUC-3 and Tmax. These results are also valid for the comparison of days 1 and 10 of each treatment. Higher Cmax values for dosage regimen A were found but Tmax and Cl/F remained stable in both treatments taking into account that 12 hours after the first medication, another dosing took place in treatment B. Eight hours after application, plasma levels were markedly low, Cmax values after single-dosing were nearly twice as high as after multiple dosing. Therefore based on these pharmacokinetic findings, a second dosing seems to be necessary; the clinical relevance needs further investigation. It has been reported, in fact, that it is in general very difficult to demonstrate a correlation between blood levels and therapeutic effects for 1.4-benzodiazepines (1,2).", 
    "10": "The effect of various inducers with or without protein binding properties on serum levels and half life of Oxacillin, Cloxacillin and Dicloxacillin was studied. A total of 102 male rats classified in 3 \"categories\" according to the administered penicillin with 6 groups of rats in each of them were used. Each group was pretreated for 15 days with the following inducers: phenobarbital, diphenylhydantoin, diazepam, chlorpromazine and phenylbutazone. The control groups received saline. The d-glucaric acid concentration in the urine prior to and after the administration of inducers and the liver weight were taken as enzyme induction indices. The results showed a decrease of serum levels and half life of three penicillins with a negative correlation between urine d-glucaric acid and serum penicillin levels. Phenobarbital, diphenylhydantoin and chlorpromazine affected the 3 penicillins in the following statistically significant order: oxacillin, dicloxacillin, cloxacillin. Diazepam affected: cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, oxacillin, and phenylbutazone: dicloxacillin, cloxacillin and oxacillin. However all drugs finally produced a uniform effect on all 3 penicillins in the following decreasing order: phenobarbital (r = -0.910), diphenylhydantoin (r = -0.864), phenylbutazone (r = -0.851), chlorpromazine (r = -0.842) and diazepam (r = -0.821). For all inducers, the effect was most significant for oxacillin (r = -0.869), second most significant for dicloxacillin (r = -0.811) and finally for cloxacillin (r = -0.778). The results suggested an interaction of isoxazolylpenicillins and the above drugs.", 
    "11": "The drug monitoring of antidepressants in blood plasma has revealed considerable interindividual differences in steady-state levels. For some compounds recent results strongly suggest that this phenomenon finds an explanation in genetic differences in the metabolism of the drugs by monooxygenases (cytochrome P-450) in the liver. Thus, a genetic deficiency has been described in 5-10% of the European population in the metabolism of debrisoquine and sparteine. Clinical experience shows that the separation of subjects into extensive metabolizers (EM) and poor metabolizers (PM) is also valid for drugs of interest in psychiatry, such as some betablockers and antidepressants like amitriptyline, nortriptyline and desipramine. Actually, PMs of debrisoquine may develop excessively high levels of these antidepressants in blood during the treatment. On the other hand, it is probable that, at least, one oxidative pathway of maprotiline belongs to the genetic polymorphism of debrisoquine, but a deficiency in the metabolism of this test substance does not necessarily mean high levels of maprotiline. Today's clinical experience shows that, in some cases, PMs of debrisoquine do not respond to a treatment with nortriptyline. However, this has not been demonstrated for amitriptyline. It is predicted that pharmacogenetic tests will find their place in psychopharmacotherapy, especially for subjects candidates for a long-term treatment or susceptible to suffer from side effects. However, the validity of the test remains to be demonstrated for other drugs, like benzodiazepines and neuroleptics, but also in the case of patients suffering from organic diseases or under treatment with potential competitors.", 
    "12": "To determine the muscarinic receptor subtype (M1 or M2 or both) responsible for cholinergic coronary vasodilatation and alterations in the transmural distribution (endocardial to epicardial blood flow ratio) of coronary blood flow, systemic and coronary haemodynamic indices and regional myocardial blood flow (radioactive microspheres) were measured in anaesthetised dogs. Submaximal vasodilative doses of the mixed muscarinic agonist acetylcholine were given by intracoronary infusion to avoid peripheral haemodynamic effects. Acetylcholine produced significant increases in myocardial perfusion and selectively redistributed flow to the subendocardium (increased endocardial to epicardial blood flow ratio). Pirenzepine (160 nmol X kg-1 iv), a selective M1 antagonist, produced no change in endocardial to epicardial blood flow ratio or myocardial blood flow but blocked the increase in endocardial to epicardial blood flow ratio and attenuated the transmural increase in myocardial perfusion during acetylcholine infusion. 4-Diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methyl bromide (4-DAMP) (17 nmol X kg-1 iv), a selective M2 antagonist, also attenuated the transmural increase in myocardial blood flow but had little effect on the increase in endocardial to epicardial blood flow ratio produced by acetylcholine. These results support the hypothesis that M1 muscarinic coronary receptors are responsible for the redistribution of blood flow to the subendocardium (increased endocardial to epicardial blood flow ratio) during cholinergic coronary vasodilatation, whereas both M1 and M2 receptors are involved in increasing myocardial perfusion.", 
    "13": "5-[2-Aminoacetamido)methyl]-1-[p-chloro-2-(o-chlorobenzoyl)phenyl] -N,N-dimethyl-1H-s-triazole-3-carboxamide hydrochloride dihydrate (450191-S) is a ring-opened derivative of 1,4-benzodiazepine, which is activated by desglycylation and subsequent cyclization. After 450191-S administration, rat bile contained three novel conjugates which released active metabolites possessing the 1,4-benzodiazepine structure through beta-glucuronidase hydrolysis. Since the released metabolites have no functional groups to conjugate with glucuronic acid, we speculated that the aglycone might be the ring-opened form of 1,4-benzodiazepine which spontaneously cyclizes after the release of glucuronic acid. This possibility was tested by chemically reducing the ketone group of the ring-opened 1,4-benzodiazepine glucuronate conjugates, which would prevent the spontaneous ring closure reaction after the release of the glucuronic acid moiety. The NaBH4 reduction of the ketone of the benzophenone moiety of the conjugates and subsequent treatment with beta-glucuronidase allowed identification of the reduced aglycones with authentic samples using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.",

In order to determine the biopharmaceutical significance of 450191-S as the ring-opened derivative of 1,4-benzodiazepine, we examined plasma levels of active metabolites in rats following oral administration of 450191-S or its primary active metabolite, 8-chloro-6-(2-chlorophenyl)-N,N-dimethyl-4H-1,2,4-triazolo [1,5-a] [1,4]benzodiazepine-2-carboxamide (M-1). By increasing the dose of 450191-S, the plasma level of the active metabolites increased dose-dependently, which appeared to be due to saturation of hepatic elimination. The areas under the plasma concentration-time curves of active metabolites at a dose of 30 mg/kg of 450191-S were 2- to 20-fold higher than those at the same dose of M-1 administration per se. These results appeared to be attributable to the presence of a labile precursor of M-1, desglycylated 450191-S, which could avoid extensive first-pass extraction by the liver. In conclusion, the results suggested that 450191-S is superior to M-1, since the former maintained higher plasma levels of the active metabolites.", 
    "15": "In a random examination including 40 patients with previous endoscopic retrograde cholangio- pancreaticography (ERCP) the influence of pirenzepine on the lipase elevation through filling of the pancreatic duct with a contrast medium was studied. The result of this study is that, compared with a control group, pirenzepine reduces significantly ERCP-caused hyperlipasemias. Therefore we can recommend the prophylactic application of pirenzepine before ERCP.",

The patients were in- and outpatients admitted between January 1978 and September 1981. WHO criteria were used for the diagnosis of dependence. 1,743 inpatients and 2,130 outpatients were dependent on psychotropic substances (most of them being alcoholics). 57 (1.1%) resp. 73 (1.3%) suffered from polydrug abuse including benzodiazepines. Only nine inpatients and 21 outpatients were addicted to benzodiazepines only. Details of benzodiazepine dependence are discussed.",

In 82 cases there was no reaction to the puncture. Most children had complete amnesia and only two remembered some pain. In 10% the sedation and analgesia was considered inadequate and barbiturate was given; seven out of these 12 children were under the age of 3 years. During 117 procedures the children maintained adequate spontaneous ventilation; in five cases the ventilation was assisted. In 13 cases there were minor side-effects including drowsiness and nausea. One child had a short apnea after the procedure.", 
    "18": "A clinical trial of the combination of naloxone in a low dose (1-1.5 micrograms X kg-1 body weight) with physostigmine (0.5-1.0 mg i.v.) was made to elucidate whether this combination could reverse postanaesthetic overdosing in neurosurgical patients without increasing postoperative pain. The investigation was made following previous findings that physostigmine has analgesic properties in addition to its systemic antisedative and anticholinergic effects as well as a stimulatory effect on morphine-depressed ventilation. Altogether 198 neurosurgical patients were investigated. The results showed that postanaesthetic over-sedation can be safely treated by a combination of naloxone and physostigmine in the dosages named above, resulting in the rapid reversal of sedation, where opiates, neuroleptics and benzodiazepines have been used. In contrast, this combination has very little effect on sedation following the administration of agents such as halothane and isoflurane. In the great majority of patients (95%), the treatment resulted in excellent analgesia during the first postoperative hour. The incidence of nausea and vomiting was increased somewhat by this treatment, but these side-effects could be minimized by decreasing the rate of drug administration. Physostigmine is contra-indicated in patients having symptoms and signs similar to those of Parkinson's disease, and the dose of physostigmine should also be reduced to 0.5 mg i.v. in all patients over the age of 65.", 
    "19": "An approach is described for estimating the dose of a new drug which is equipotent to an established dose of an old drug. The approach is basically that of the parallel-line assay but it can allow for concomitant variables and, by exploiting the facilities available in the statistical computer package GLIM (generalized linear interactive modelling), the approach can be applied when the residuals conform to one of a number of distributions and, with suitable safeguards, to continuous, discrete and even 'scored' responses. In some circumstances, it is necessary to obtain confidence limits by Efron's 'bootstrap' technique. The method is illustrated with results from a trial of two premedicant drugs in children.", 
    "20": "The effect of clonazepam was studied in ten patients with nystagmus-induced oscillopsia due to downbeating or other primary position nystagmus. A 1-2-mg single-dose clonazepam test was used to determine whether long-term clonazepam therapy was indicated and to help distinguish between visual loss from underlying retinal or optic nerve disease and visual loss due to the nystagmus itself. With the single-dose clonazepam test, nystagmus was eliminated in 6 of 10 patients in the primary position of gaze and in 7 of 10 patients in downgaze. In all positions of gaze in all patients there was significant reduction in nystagmus intensity and slow phase velocity. Symptoms of oscillopsia were reduced or eliminated in all patients, and 7 of 8 patients with reduced visual acuity had clinical improvement. Guidelines are presented for the use of clonazepam in a single-dose clonazepam test and for long-term therapy.", 
    "21": "The majority of infants born to drug-dependent women undergo neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) and often require pharmacotherapy for the treatment of withdrawal symptoms. Phenobarbital, paregoric, and diazepam have been recommended for the treatment of the syndrome. While some investigators have examined the efficacy of these agents in treating NAS, there are no data regarding the use of specific pharmacologic agents and developmental outcome. This study evaluated 85 infants born to drug-dependent women who were maintained on methadone during pregnancy. Severity of infant withdrawal was assessed with the neonatal abstinence scoring system. Infants who required pharmacotherapy were randomly assigned to one of four treatment regimens: paragoric, phenobarbital (titration), phenobarbital (loading), and diazepam. When treatment was not successful with the assigned agent, one of the other agent(s) was used. At 6 months of age, the developmental status of infants was assessed with the Bayley Scales of Mental Development. Based on NAS treatment, four groups were defined: paregoric (n = 21); phenobarbital (n = 17); more than one agent (n = 31); and no treatment (n = 16). Data for the phenobarbital loading and titration groups were combined since analysis revealed no differences between groups. All infants who initially received diazepam were included in group III since diazepam as a single agent was not successful. Results of one way analysis of variance revealed no differences in developmental status between groups (p greater than 0.10, F = 0.25). Scores for all groups were well within the normal range of development.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "22": "The present investigation was carried out to compare the effects of pirenzepine, a novel antimuscarinic drug, with those elicited by atropine and propantheline on gastric acid secretion and gastric emptying in the conscious rat. The administration of all three drugs resulted in a dose-related inhibition on both parameters that at large doses was nearly total. Comparison of the ID50 ratios for each antagonist on gastric emptying versus acid secretion showed that pirenzepine was unique in that it selectively inhibited acid secretion. Its potency on acid secretion was about 15 times higher than that elicited on gastric emptying. The results are compatible with the proposed existence of two different classes of gastric muscarinic receptors mediating secretory and motor activities.", 
    "23": "In microsomes of bovine adrenal medulla, there were two affinity binding sites for carbamylcholine with a high and a low affinity. Copper (1-10 microM) largely enhanced the affinity of carbamylcholine at the low affinity binding site, with a slight increase in the affinity at the high affinity binding site. On the other hand, copper slightly decreased the binding affinity of pirenzepine and atropine. Thus, low concentrations of copper modulate the muscarinic receptors in the adrenal medulla by selectively increasing agonist affinity.", 
    "24": "Electroencephalographic (EEG) effects of 450191-S and its metabolites were investigated in unanesthetized rabbits with chronic electrode implants, and they were compared with those of nitrazepam and estazolam. 450191-S at doses of 0.1-0.5 mg/kg, i.v., induced a drowsy pattern of spontaneous EEG: high voltage slow waves and spindle bursts increased in the cortex and amygdala, while the hippocampal theta rhythm was desynchronized. In addition, low voltage fast waves appeared particularly in the cortical EEG. The EEG arousal response to auditory stimulation and to electric stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation, posterior hypothalamus and centromedian thalamus was markedly suppressed by 450191-S. The photic driving response elicited by a flash light in the visual cortex was significantly suppressed by 450191-S. 450191-S showed no significant effect on the recruiting response. The EEG effects of nitrazepam were qualitatively similar but less potent and shorter in duration of action than those of 450191-S. The effects of estazolam were approximately as potent as those of 450191-S, but its duration of action was much shorter than that of 450191-S. 450191-S was more potent than nitrazepam and approximately equipotent to estazolam in suppressing hippocampal and amygdaloid after-discharges. The EEG effects of M-1 and M-2 were similar to those of 450191-S in both qualitative and quantitative aspects. The effects of M-A were quantitatively similar but less potent and shorter in duration of action than those of 450191-S.", 
    "25": "Whereas classic muscarinic antagonist ligands appear to recognize only a single class of muscarinic receptor sites, the recently discovered antagonist pirenzepine appears to distinguish at least two classes of sites. Its unique binding properties, demonstrated in both indirect and direct binding studies, have led to an emerging concept of high affinity (M1) and low affinity (M2) sites. This concept has been supported by pharmacologic studies of functional muscarinic responses, as well as by data suggesting different effector relationships for the two sites. Gallamine possesses muscarinic antagonist properties, and it also recognizes heterogeneity among muscarinic receptors. The purpose of this study was to define gallamine-recognized heterogeneity in terms of the pirenzepine-defined M1, M2 concept. This has been done by studying the ability of gallamine to inhibit [3H]pirenzepine binding to the M1 site, and to inhibit [3H]quinuclidinylbenzilate ([3H]QNB) binding in cerebellar membrane preparations, which contain almost exclusively the M2 site. The results show that gallamine binds with high affinity to the M2 site, with Ki = 2.4 nM, and lower affinity to the M1 site with Ki = 24 nM. Within these classes gallamine does not recognize heterogeneity. The ability of gallamine to inhibit [3H]QNB binding to cortex is best described by a two-site model comprised of 77% low affinity gallamine sites (M1) and 23% high affinity gallamine sites (M2). Thus, the heterogeneity among muscarinic receptors which is recognized by gallamine within the receptor binding paradigms of this study can be attributed to the M1, M2 subtypes as defined by pirenzepine binding. In addition, gallamine at low concentrations appears to bind as a pure competitive antagonist at these two sites, indicated by linear Schild plots with slopes of 1.0, the lack of an effect on dissociation of radioligands, and the ability to protect [3H]pirenzepine and [3H]QNB-binding sites from alkylation by propylbenzylcholine mustard. These studies do not exclude the possibility of a non-competitive interaction of gallamine with the muscarinic receptor observed by other investigators at high gallamine concentrations, and postulated to occur at a site adjacent to the primary muscarinic site. It is proposed that gallamine is capable of interacting with both the primary muscarinic site and an allosteric site. These results support the emerging concept of M1 and M2 muscarinic subclasses and suggest that gallamine and related compounds may be useful in defining muscarinic receptor subclasses, given their higher affinity for the M2 site.", 
    "26": "Muscarinic receptors of the rabbit ear artery were characterized by observing the effect of the subtype selective antagonist pirenzepine on functional responses and radioligand binding. Pirenzepine has been shown to bind with high affinity to muscarinic receptors of certain brain regions and peripheral ganglia (M1 subtype) and with low affinity to receptors of the heart and upper gastrointestinal tract (M2 subtype). The affinity (pKB) of pirenzepine for the muscarinic sites of the endothelium was determined by the competitive antagonism of the relaxation response to methacholine. Schild analysis gave a pKB of 6.5 (320 nM) which is consistent with the low affinity, M2, subtype of muscarinic receptor. Removal of the endothelium eliminates any response to muscarinic agonists but does not decrease the density of muscarinic binding sites determined by binding of the specific ligand (-)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate. This indicates a second group of muscarinic receptors most probably located on vascular smooth muscle cells for which there is no known function. The pKi for pirenzepine at these sites, as determined by the inhibition of (-)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding, was 6.26 (550 nM) which is also consistent with a low affinity subtype. Thus, both types of vascular muscarinic binding sites, those on the endothelium which mediate relaxation and those on the vascular smooth muscle cells, are of the low affinity, M2, subtype.", 
    "27": "A randomised, double blind study, of 58 female patients undergoing laparoscopic investigation was carried out to compare triazolam 0.25 mg, lorazepam 2 mg, or placebo as oral premedication. Each patient was assessed by only one of the authors both pre- and postoperatively with regard to anxiolysis, sedation and rapidity of recovery. Triazolam and lorazepam were each associated with a significant reduction in anxiety compared to the initial assessment, whereas placebo had no anxiolytic effect. Sixty minutes after premedication, patients who had received triazolam were significantly more sleepy than patients given placebo or lorazepam. Two hours after the operation, the patients who had had triazolam or lorazepam were significantly more sleepy than those who received placebo. However, at 6 hours postoperatively there was no difference between triazolam and placebo, whilst those who had been given lorazepam were still significantly more sleepy than those given placebo. Triazolam appears to offer advantages over either lorazepam or placebo in patients who require rapid recovery, sedation and reduction in pre-operative anxiety.", 
    "28": "Psychotropic drug prescribing in 1280 medical inpatients between 1973-75 was compared with that in 1200 similar patients during 1982-83. Three benzodiazepines accounted for 64% of prescriptions in 1973-75 and nine benzodiazepines for 82% of prescriptions in 1982-83. Over the decade, use of psychotropic drugs fell from 56% to 38% (P less than 0.001), primarily due to a reduction in patients treated only in hospital (34% vs 16%, P less than 0.001). Before admission, the proportions of patients receiving these drugs were similar (17% vs 18%). During admission, concomitant administration of similar drugs declined from 22% of patients in 1973-75 to 11% in 1982-83 (P less than 0.001), while concurrent prescribing before admission increased from 13 to 19%. The marked fall in psychotropic drug use and in inappropriate concomitant therapy indicates an encouraging trend towards more rational drug use at least in hospital. This was achieved without fiscal control and further rationalization of prescribing habits may be achieved by self-audit within the profession without legislative action.", 
    "29": "The activity of chronic (3 weeks) treatment with the triazolobenzodiazepines, alprazolam and adinazolam, on clonidine- and apomorphine-induced aggression were studied. Adinazolam, like desipramine, potentiated aggression induced by clonidine while diazepam and alprazolam completely abolished it. In the apomorphine-induced aggression, adinazolam suppressed both aggressivity and stereotypy, while diazepam slightly potentiated it. Alprazolam did not modify the effect of aggression induced by apomorphine. On the whole, while adinazolam seemed to develop an activity closer to that of a classical antidepressant like desipramine, alprazolam appeared to be more similar to the benzodiazepines on clonidine-induced aggression in mice. Compared to desipramine and diazepam, adinazolam left these two effects induced by apomorphine almost unchanged. The experiments performed showed differences between the profiles of action of the two triazolobenzodiazepines studied.", 
    "30": "Withdrawal syndromes of both alcohol and benzodiazepines have been recognized increasingly as modifying symptoms of diseases in acute medicine. In 198 consecutive patients admitted for medical or surgical reasons to Oulu University Hospital blood alcohol and urine metabolites of benzodiazepines were measured in samples taken on admission. Based on these measurements out of 198 patients 48 (24.2%) had taken alcohol and/or benzodiazepines. Only alcohol was detected in 17 (8.6%) and only benzodiazepines in 27 (13.6%) patients. Both benzodiazepines and alcohol were found in four (2.2%) patients. When compared with drug history obtained on admission 70.6% of alcohol and 33.3% of benzodiazepine intakes were recorded. No clear withdrawal symptoms were seen in patients during the observation time which varied from 1 to 7 days (mean 2.5 days). Our results show that many patients neglect their drug intakes from drug history on admission. The physician should keep in mind the possibility of withdrawal symptoms in acute medicine.", 
    "31": "The inferior colliculus (IC) is a critical site for induction of audiogenic seizures in the genetically epilepsy-prone rat (GEPR). Abnormal response properties observed in inferior colliculus neurons of that strain include a high incidence of onset-offset responses which may be a form of afterdischarge. These response abnormalities may involve altered actions of neurotransmitters in that region of the brain. GABA is implicated as a transmitter in endogenous sound-induced inhibition in the inferior colliculus. Endogenous inhibition and the actions of agents that affect GABA receptors were examined in inferior colliculus neurons in epileptic and normal rats. The iontophoretic dose (current) of GABA required to suppress neuronal firing in the epilepsy-prone rat was significantly greater than that required in neurons of the normal rat. A form of endogenous (binaural) inhibition in inferior colliculus neurons, which is proposed to be GABA-mediated, was also significantly reduced in the epilepsy-prone rat as compared with the normal rat. A benzodiazepine (flurazepam) which enhances the action of GABA in many brain sites including the inferior colliculus was significantly less effective than normal when applied iontophoretically onto the same neurons of the epilepsy-prone rat. The GABAA antagonist, bicuculline, which blocks the effect of GABA on inferior colliculus neurons, frequently induced the onset-offset response in neurons not previously exhibiting this pattern. These findings suggest that the reduction of GABA-mediated inhibition in the genetically epilepsy-prone rat may result in the increased incidence of afterdischarges in neurons of the inferior colliculus and may serve as an important mechanism of epileptogenesis in audiogenic seizures in this genetic form of epilepsy.", 
    "32": "Hypercalcemia may be associated with neoplastic disease, either as an epiphenomenon resulting from tumor-produced humoral substances or as a direct consequence of bone involvement. Endoscopic procedures are occasionally performed in this group of patients for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. This report reviews the interaction of hypercalcemia and sedative hypnotic drugs and suggests that hypercalcemia might be a risk factor for those patients undergoing endoscopy.", 
    "33": "All drugs used in obstetric analgesia are more or less lipophilic, their site of action is in the central nervous system, and they have good membrane penetrability in the fetomaternal unit. Thus the dose and method of administration as well as the duration of treatment are important clinical determinants of drug effects in the fetus and newborn. In the past, too much emphasis has been placed on fetomaternal blood concentration ratios of different agents; it is now appreciated that the extent of fetal tissue distribution and the neonatal elimination rate are pharmacokinetically much more important. Extensive fetal tissue distribution is reflected in a low fetomaternal drug concentration ratio, which may be followed by prolonged neonatal elimination of the drug. Currently, the most effective and safest method for obstetric analgesia is regional epidural administration of bupivacaine or lignocaine (lidocaine); only low doses are needed and the newborn is able to handle these agents efficiently. On the basis of pharmacokinetic and neurobehavioural assessments, inhalational anaesthetic agents appear to be more attractive than pethidine (meperidine) or benzodiazepines. Intermittent administration and fast pulmonary elimination of inhalational agents ensure that long-lasting residual effects are unlikely to occur. The kinetics of epidural and intrathecal opiates explain the problems associated with their use in obstetrics. Among the newer drugs used in obstetric analgesia, the properties of meptazinol and isoflurane appear interesting and these agents warrant further study. All drugs used in obstetric analgesia have a potentially detrimental effect on the neonate and, therefore, knowledge of fetal and neonatal pharmacokinetics is of importance to the clinician.", 
    "34": "Ginger, the common spice, has recently been found to act as a potent inhibitor of thromboxane synthetase, raising levels of prostacyclin, without a concomitant rise in PGE2 or PGF2 alpha. Indications for use of ginger to replace either thromboxane inhibitors having serious side effects or prostacyclin are given.", 
    "35": "Use of endotracheal drug therapy during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is reviewed. Endotracheal drug therapy--instillation of a drug solution directly into an endotracheal tube for absorption into the circulation via the alveoli--may be used during CPR when venous access is limited. Administration of drugs via a central vein is the most efficient route, but a central i.v. line may not be present and peripheral venous administration may not be possible because of vasoconstriction, trauma, other patient-related factors, or absence of personnel trained to insert i.v. catheters. An endotracheal tube is usually inserted during CPR; in most cases, this procedure can be performed outside the hospital by emergency medical personnel. Basic life-support measures are not interrupted during endotracheal administration as they are in intracardiac drug administration. Drugs that may be administered by the endotracheal route include epinephrine, atropine sulfate, lidocaine hydrochloride, naloxone hydrochloride, and metaraminol bitartrate. Endotracheal delivery of calcium salts, sodium bicarbonate, and bretylium tosylate is not recommended. Pharmacokinetic data for drugs administered endotracheally are lacking; therefore, dosage recommendations are empirical. Usually, the same dose is administered endotracheally as by the i.v. route. Little is known about choice and volume of diluent and the best anatomic site of application. Endotracheal drug administration may replace intracardiac injection as the second-line alternative to intravenous drug injection during CPR.", 
    "36": "The authors studied in vitro immune function as measured by lymphocytic proliferative response to mitogen stimulation in 36 patients with agoraphobia and panic attacks who were participating in a double-blind placebo-controlled psychopharmacological study of anxiety disorder. No significant difference in immune status was observed between panic patients and healthy controls.", 
    "37": "In order to establish whether arginine-vasopressin (AVP) release in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia is mediated by a muscarinic and/or nicotinic cholinergic pathway, 12 normal men had an insulin tolerance test (ITT) in basal conditions and after treatment with the muscarinic receptor blocker pirenzepine (40 mg IV (intravenously) ten minutes before ITT in six subjects) or the nicotinic receptor antagonist trimethaphan (0.3 mg/min X 30 min IV before ITT in six subjects). The drugs did not modify arterial blood pressure nor produce side effects capable of altering AVP secretion. Pirenzepine administration did not change AVP response to hypoglycemia, whereas trimethaphan significantly reduced AVP increase by about 50% during the ITT. These data suggest the involvement of a cholinergic-nicotinic mechanism in regulation of AVP response to hypoglycemia.", 
    "38": "The successful management of patients with MPD syndrome is dependent on establishing an accurate diagnosis and using proper therapy based on an understanding of the etiology of the disorder. Establishing an accurate diagnosis is accomplished by taking a careful history, doing a thorough examination, and having a knowledge of the various other conditions that can produce signs and symptoms similar to those of MPD syndrome. Using proper therapy is related to recognition that MPD syndrome is a stress-induced psychophysiologic disease originating in the muscles of mastication and not an organic disease arising in the temporomandibular joint. Thus, therapy should be directed at reducing stress, relaxing tense jaw muscles, and creating an awareness by the patient of the causes of the problem, rather than at analyzing occlusion, measuring joint spaces, and producing irreversible structural changes in the dentition and the articulation. Because good results can be achieved with these uncomplicated, reversible forms of therapy, it is important that the clinician does not succumb to an unproven fad or use of an irreversible procedure that will not achieve better results.", 
    "39": "For patients with chronic intractable headache, we compared a new treatment and a traditional one. Fifty-five patients (36 dependent on ergotamine, analgesics, diazepam, or corticosteroids) were given IV dihydroergotamine (DHE) and metoclopramide every 8 hours. Fifty-four age- and sex-matched patients (38 drug-dependent) were given diazepam intravenously every 8 hours. Forty-nine of the 55 DHE-treated patients became headache-free within 48 hours, and 39 of them sustained benefits in a mean follow-up of 16 months. In contrast, 7 diazepam-treated patients became free of headache within 3 to 6 days, and 31 had improved somewhat in 10 days. Repetitive IV DHE helps to terminate cycles of intractable migraine.", 
    "40": "Nonulcer dyspepsia remains a difficult disorder to treat because it is a heterogeneous syndrome. Once patients with the irritable bowel syndrome, esophagitis, and other organic diseases are excluded, there remain patients with dyspepsia of unknown cause (termed \"essential dyspepsia\") and patients with dyspepsia plus symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux without esophagitis. The aim of this study was to determine whether cimetidine or pirenzepine is efficacious in relieving the symptoms of these latter subgroups. Sixty-two consecutive patients were studied who had chronic upper abdominal pain or nausea where endoscopy had shown no evidence of peptic ulceration, esophagitis, or malignancy; 47 had essential dyspepsia, and 15 had dyspepsia plus gastroesophageal reflux. They were initially randomized to either cimetidine or placebo, or pirenzepine or placebo. Patients continued each medication for 1 mo, and, after a washout period, crossed over when again symptomatic; 51 patients completed cimetidine and placebo, and 50 completed pirenzepine and placebo. The results showed that cimetidine was superior to placebo in decreasing the number of upper abdominal pain episodes weekly and the severity of pain, but the absolute improvement was small. Pirenzepine was not superior to placebo in decreasing symptoms.", 
    "41": "Neuroleptic-induced tardive dystonia is frequently refractory to therapy. We describe a 13-year-old girl with neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis who developed dystonia after beginning treatment with thioridazine for acute psychosis. Although anticholinergic drugs and benzodiazepines were ineffective, the patient improved with baclofen. Patients with certain degenerative diseases of the central nervous system may be at increased risk for the development of drug-induced dystonia, and we caution against the use of neuroleptics in these patients.", 
    "42": "The role of antimuscarinic action in gastric mucosal protection against necrotizing agents and the role of such mucosal protection in antiulcerogenic action were studied in rats with i.v. administered antimuscarinic agents. Pirenzepine, as well as PGE2, prevented the gastric mucosal lesions induced by all necrotizing agents (99.5% ethanol, 0.6 N HCI, 0.15 N NaOH, 0.4 N HCI-50 mM taurocholate), but atropine did not prevent the HCI-induced lesions. Cimetidine inhibited only the ethanol-induced lesions even at the antisecretory dose. Higher doses of pirenzepine (5-fold) and atropine (10-fold) were required to inhibit the gastric secretion in Shay rats than in vagally stimulated rats. There was no difference between the antisecretory doses of cimetidine in Shay rats and vagally stimulated rats. PGE2 (0.03-0.1 mg/kg) did not affect gastric secretion. The protective doses of pirenzepine and atropine against mucosal lesions induced by necrotizing agents were similar to the dose in inhibiting vagally stimulated acid secretion and water-immersion stress-induced lesions. PGE2 (100 micrograms/kg) did not prevent the water-immersion stress induced gastric lesions. These results suggested that antimuscarinic agents protect the gastric mucosa from necrotizing agents via a blocking action on the activation of the intrinsic cholinergic nerve. However, antiulcerogenic action is more deeply concerned with antisecretory action than cytoprotection.", 
    "43": "The pharmacokinetics of chlordemethyldiazepam--a pharmacologically very active new 1,4-benzodiazepine derivative--in healthy subjects after administration of a single oral dose of 2 mg, was studied. Peak concentrations were reached in 1.2 +/- 0.2 hours. Plasma levels declined with a biphasic pattern, and the elimination phase had a half-life of 82.9 +/- 14.1 hours. The concentrations of the main metabolite of chlordemethyldiazepam, lorazepam, were about 7% of those of the parent compound. In urine only conjugated lorazepam could be found its 96 hour excretion reaching about 15% of the administered dose of parent drug.", 
    "44": "CGS-8216, a benzodiazepine antagonist, was administered to rats acutely dosed with diazepam, and to rats chronically dosed with diazepam or pentobarbital. The effects of an acute dose of diazepam were antagonized by CGS-8216 but signs of precipitated abstinence were not observed. An apparent arousing effect was seen in non-dependent rats when CGS-8216 was administered after placebo, but no arousal was observed when Ro15-1788 was administered after placebo in non-dependent rats. A precipitated abstinence syndrome was elicited with CGS-8216 in rats chronically dosed with diazepam and was very similar to the abstinence syndrome precipitated by Ro15-1788 in diazepam-dependent rats. Like Ro15-1788, CGS-8216 elevated Precipitated Abstinence Scale (PAS) scores in a dose-related manner until a plateau was reached with 5 mg/kg. No signs of precipitated abstinence were observed when CGS-8216 was administered to rats dependent on phenobarbital.", 
    "45": "The purpose of this study was to limit prophylactic treatment of children with febrile convulsions to patients who have the highest risk of recurrence. Two hundred and thirty-one children with a first febrile seizure were divided into high- and low-risk groups according to estimated risk of recurrence. All high-risk children were offered treatment with valproic acid. If this was declined they were offered treatment with diazepam instead. Low-risk children were untreated. Valproic acid and diazepam were found to be equally effective in reducing the risk of recurrence of febrile convulsions. By selecting for prophylactic treatment according to estimated risk of recurrence it is possible to reduce the rate of recurrence of febrile seizures in children at high-risk (60%) to the same level as that of untreated low-risk children (23%). Only about half of all children with febrile convulsions need treatment and follow-up according to these criteria.", 
    "46": "Amygdala-kindled female rats were used to compare the effects of seven antiepileptic drugs that are clinically used for treatment of partial epilepsy with complex symptomatology, on generalized seizures, focal seizures, or electrographic seizure activity at the focus. As a second approach of drug evaluation, drug effects on mean latency, severity, and duration of the seizures were determined. Anticonvulsant potencies obtained were compared with those determined in the maximal electroshock seizure test in female rats. Phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, diazepam, clonazepam, but not primidone dose-dependently suppressed generalized motor seizures in kindled rats; however, except for the benzodiazepines, ED50S were substantially higher than those determined in the maximal electroshock seizure test. Compared with their effect on generalized motor seizures, all drugs were much less potent in blocking focal seizures and afterdischarges recorded from the amygdala. The data suggest that with respect to behavioral and pharmacologic characteristics of the amygdala kindling model, fully kindled rats may be a useful model for drug-resistant complex partial seizures with secondary generalization. Results of experiments with novel inhibitors of GABA uptake, which were inactive in the maximal electroshock seizure test but highly potent against kindled seizures, suggest that such drugs might be more effective than current antiepileptic drugs for treatment of partial epilepsy.", 
    "47": "Petit mal (absence) epilepsy remains one of the most enigmatic of neurological disorders, and there is no widely accepted theory of its etiology. This review covers some of the current issues concerned with the disorder, including treatment and prognosis, neurochemical research, behavioral and psychophysiological effects of wave-spiked discharges, and EEG studies of seizure control. With respect to treatment, although effective drug therapy (valproic acid, ethosuximide) exists for the \"pure\" form of absence epilepsy, other forms, in which there is an admixture of grand mal seizures, are less amenable to pharmacotherapy. Moreover, the frequency of fatal hepatic toxicity following valproic acid therapy has been estimated at 1 in 20,000. With respect to prognosis, follow-up studies indicate that many patients do not outgrow the disorder but continue to suffer absence seizures well into adulthood. In recent years, there has been considerable research on the neurochemical basis of absence epilepsy. Current theories, including those that implicate gamma-aminobutyric acid, catecholamines, and \"endogenous\" epileptogens, are summarized; and requirements for an experimentally induced animal model of absence epilepsy are discussed. The majority of behavioral studies of the disorder have concerned the effects of petit mal-type discharges on sensory and cognitive processes. Some of these studies are reviewed; and recent work bearing on these issues, involving event-related brain potentials, is presented. Our review concludes with a discussion of research aimed at the development of electrophysiologically based approaches to the reduction of seizure frequency in patients with absence epilepsy.", 
    "48": "The effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and six anticonvulsants on penicillin-induced bursting were compared in guinea pig hippocampal slices. GABA, phenobarbital, pentobarbital, phenytoin, and diazepam slowed and eventually blocked spontaneous bursts. Low-intensity stimulation at concentrations that blocked spontaneous activity still evoked synchronous all-or-none burst responses, although the threshold increased and the bursts were briefer. Sodium valproate had similar effects, but very high concentrations (approximately 10 mM) were required. Ethosuximide paradoxically increased spontaneous burst rate. This model appears to be differentially susceptible to the actions of GABA and the anticonvulsants commonly used to treat tonic-clonic and partial seizures but not to the antiabsence drugs.", 
    "49": "We studied the effects of four antiepileptic drugs on pentylenetetrazole-induced burst discharges in the CA3 region of the in vitro hippocampus. Diazepam and carbamazepine abolished the bursting activity in a gradual and dose-dependent manner. Phenobarbital only decreased the burst frequency. Valproic acid was either ineffective or actually caused an increase in both burst frequency and amplitude. The findings in this model were compared with results obtained by other investigators in a penicillin-induced model of epileptiform activity in the hippocampal slice. Diazepam had a similar effect on both pentylenetetrazole- and penicillin-induced burst discharges, but phenobarbital was ineffective in the pentylenetetrazole model, indicating that these chemically induced hippocampal epileptiform activities may be differentially sensitive to antiepileptic drugs.", 
    "50": "The binding of racemic 3H-suriclone on the BZD receptor was performed in special conditions in order to discriminate between the affinity of the two enantiomers: a rebinding method was used. In the first incubation 40% of 3H-suriclone was specifically bound to the BZD receptor. In the second incubation performed with the supernatant coming from the first incubation, less than 1% of the radiolabelled suriclone was specifically bound to the BZD receptor. These results suggest that most probably only one of the two enantiomers of suriclone may bind the BZD receptor. It appears that this enantiomer has the greatest affinity constant ever found for a BZD receptor agonist (Kd = 20 pM at 37 degrees C in presence of GABA and 70 pM in absence of GABA).", 
    "51": "The influence of oral diazepam administration (10 mg) on interhemispheric proactive and retroactive interferential inhibition during detection of test verbal signals was tachistoscopally studied in eight healthy right-handed subjects, in conditions of forward and backward contralateral masking according to the scheme of double blind investigations. Strengthening of effects of forward and backward contralateral masking was revealed which is considered as a testimony to participation of GABA-ergic inhibitory systems in the mechanisms of interhemispheric proactive and retroactive interferential inhibition.", 
    "52": "Mice treated with (+/-)baclofen (2 mg/kg i.p.) displayed profound differences to the motor depressant action of this drug. Mice were divided into three groups termed as responders (20%), moderate responders (65%) and nonresponders (15%). No differences were detected in the spontaneous motor activity between the selected groups. When the animal population in the home cages was kept unchanged the different responses to baclofen were reproducible three weeks after selection. A borderline dose of diazepam (1.5 mg/kg) decreased highly significantly motor activity in baclofen responders but failed to do this in nonresponders group. Ex vivo studies with 3H-flunitrazepam (labelling in vivo and binding carried out in vitro) demonstrated that 3H-flunitrazepam binding in mouse forebrain was significantly smaller in baclofen responders than in nonresponders. Further, the apparent number of 3H-flunitrazepam binding sites in vitro was significantly decreased in the forebrain of baclofen responders. It is concluded that some actions of baclofen depend on the functional state of benzodiazepine recognition sites.", 
    "53": "Diazepam within its therapeutic dose range, was shown to have no effect on nociception, but was shown to antagonize the analgesic action of morphine. This antagonism was found to be statistically significant at 0.5 mg/kg diazepam. To elucidate the mechanism of this inhibitory action of diazepam against morphine analgesia, Ro 15-1788, the specific antagonist of benzodiazepine receptors was used. As a result, Ro 15-1788 was found to partially reverse the inhibitory action of diazepam against morphine analgesia. This overall interaction between the supramolecular GABA receptor complex and morphine is discussed.", 
    "54": "Repeated administration of the beta-carboline benzodiazepine receptor ligand FG 7142 produces sensitization to its effects so that full seizures develop (chemical kindling); initially it is only pro-convulsant. The present study investigated alterations in the function of drugs which act at the different sites at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) benzodiazepine receptor complex, after repeated administration of FG 7142. In FG 7142 kindled mice decreased anticonvulsant and hypothermic effects of the GABA agonist muscimol were observed. The hypothermic effects of the GABA agonist progabide were reduced. In contrast a small increase in the hypothermic effect of pentobarbitone was seen. The convulsant effects of bicuculline and picrotoxin were unaltered when they were given intravenously but marginally increased when they were given by the intraperitoneal route. No changes were seen in the hypothermic effects of these drugs. No significant changes were seen in the convulsant or hypothermic effects of pentylenetetrazol. These results suggest that kindling with FG 7142 may alter GABA receptor function.", 
    "55": "Experiments performed in our laboratory, using electrical stimulation combined with microinjection of drugs in the dorsal midbrain central grey (CG) of the rat, evidenced that direct stimulation of GABA receptors with locally administered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or the GABAA receptor agonists 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol, isoguvacine and muscimol raised the aversive threshold, defined as the lowest electrical current intensity inducing flight or escape behaviour when applied to the dorsal CG. The GABAB receptor agonist baclofen was ineffective. Also, enhancement of endogenous GABA action through local injection of the benzodiazepines chlordiazepoxide and midazolam or of pentobarbital resulted in anti-aversive effects. Ro 15-1788 antagonized both chlordiazepoxide and midazolam, suggesting benzodiazepine receptor mediation. In contrast to pro-GABAergic drugs, microinjection of the GABA antagonists bicuculline and picrotoxin into the CG elicited flight behaviour, like the electrical stimulation. Similar experiments with drugs influencing serotonergic neurotransmission evidenced that intra-CG microinjection of serotonin (5-HT) or of the direct 5-HT receptor agonist 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine increased the aversive threshold. The anti-aversive effect of 5-HT was potentiated by the selective inhibitor of 5-HT neuronal uptake, zimelidine. Also, the latter drug increased the aversive threshold when given alone. The anti-aversive effect of 5-HT was antagonized by local pretreatment with either metergoline or ketanserin, the latter being a selective blocker of 5-HT2 receptors. In contrast to the GABA antagonists mentioned above, the 5-HT receptor blockers did not evoke aversive behaviour per se. Therefore, both GABAergic and serotonergic mechanisms are likely to play an inhibitory role in the dorsal CG integrating aversive behaviour.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "56": "Both reductions in brain serotonin activity and injections of benzodiazepine drugs increase punished responding in rats, but the evidence is conflicting on the role of serotonin pathways in the benzodiazepine effect. Therefore a series of studies were carried out using a Geller-Seifter procedure with three components, to examine drug effects on rewarded, nonrewarded, and punished responding. Using male hooded Lister rats and chronic indwelling cannulae, it was found that neither chlordiazepoxide (1.5 and 5.0 micrograms in 0.5 microliter), midazolam (1.0 and 10.0 micrograms in 0.5 microliter), nor GABA (100, 500, 1000, and 5000 ng in 0.5 microliter), exerted significant anticonflict activity when injected into the dorsal raphe. Lesions of the dorsal raphe produced by injections of 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine significantly increased punished responding, and there were significant correlations between lesion size, extent of forebrain serotonin depletion, and increases in punished responding. Peripheral injections of chlordiazepoxide (5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg) and midazolam (1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 mg/kg) significantly increased punished responding both before and after raphe lesions. The increase in lesioned animals was significantly greater than after drug or lesion alone and represented a powerful additive effect which was specific to punished responding. As intraraphe benzodiazepines did not exert significant anticonflict activity, and raphe lesions did not attenuate the anticonflict activity of peripheral benzodiazepines, it is concluded that increases in punished responding seen after serotonin depletion and after benzodiazepine drugs may be dissociable.", 
    "57": "A substance having benzodiazepine-binding inhibitory activity has been extracted from 18 kg of gray matter of bovine cerebral cortex and purified to homogeneity. This substance inhibits competitively [3H]flunitrazepam and ethyl beta-[3H]carboline-3-carboxylate binding with high affinity (Ki, 3 nM), but it is inactive upon 3H-labeled Ro 5-4864, [3H]quinuclidinyl benzylate, [3H]prazosin, [3H]clonidine, [3H]dihydroalprenolol, and upon high-affinity [3H]muscimol binding. This inhibitor has been identified as n-butyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCB) by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy (Mr, 268) and electron bombardment fragmentography, ultraviolet and fluorescence spectra, coelution in HPLC with standard beta-CCB, and by the exact correspondence in Ki with beta-CCB on the displacement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding. The possible artificial formation of beta-CCB has been discarded by a series of control experiments including addition of tryptophan to the starting homogenate, extraction from liver, isolation and purification by an alternative procedure avoiding organic solvents, and by the impossibility of making beta-CCB from beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid or its methyl ester in the conditions of our extraction and purification procedures.", 
    "58": "3S(-)-N-(2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4- benzodiazepine-3-yl)-1H-indole-2-carboxamide (L-364,718) interacted in a competitive manner with rat pancreatic cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors as determined by Scatchard analysis of the specific binding of 125I-labeled CCK. The affinity of L-364,718 for both pancreatic (IC50, 81 pM) and gallbladder (IC50, 45 pM) CCK receptors in radioligand binding assays greatly exceeded that of other reported nonpeptide CCK antagonists and was similar to that of CCK itself. In vitro functional studies utilizing CCK-induced contractions of the isolated guinea pig ileum and colon further demonstrated that L-364,718 acts as a competitive CCK antagonist, which lacks agonist activity and has a similar high affinity in these tissues (pA2, 9.9). L-364,718 exhibited a very high selectivity for peripheral CCK receptors relative to brain CCK, gastrin, and various other peptide and nonpeptide receptors in both in vitro radioligand and isolated tissue assays. In vivo, low intravenous doses of L-364,718 (0.1 mg/kg) markedly antagonized the contractions of the guinea pig gallbladder produced by intravenous administration of CCK for at least 2 hr. Administered orally, L-364,718 (ED50, 0.04 mg/kg) was highly effective as an antagonist of CCK-induced inhibition of gastric emptying in mice. The biochemical and pharmacological properties of L-364,718--namely, very high affinity and selectivity for peripheral CCK receptors, long-lasting in vivo efficacy, and oral bioavailability--makes this compound a powerful tool for investigating the physiological and pharmacological actions of CCK, and possibly its role in gastrointestinal disorders.", 
    "59": "We describe the design and synthesis of nonpeptidal antagonists of the peptide hormone cholecystokinin. Several of these compounds have high specificity and nanomolar binding affinity and are active after oral administration. To our knowledge, the design of such agents has not previously been accomplished for any peptide hormone. The structural similarities between these synthetic compounds and the anxiolytic 1,4-benzodiazepines are noted, and the potential of this structural feature for future design of ligands for other peptide hormone receptors is discussed.", 
    "60": "Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) breakdown was stimulated by agonists acting at muscarinic cholinergic and alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in mouse brain. Ethanol, in vitro, inhibited basal cerebral cortical PIP2 breakdown with a threshold concentration of 75-100 mM. Basal PIP2 breakdown in hippocampus and striatum was less sensitive to ethanol. A high concentration of ethanol (500 mM) increased the EC50 for carbachol stimulation of PIP2 breakdown in all three brain areas, but had no effect on the EC50 for norepinephrine. Following chronic ingestion of ethanol by mice, the EC50 for carbachol stimulation of PIP2 breakdown in cortex was decreased, and there was no change in striatum. These effects were consistent with previously observed increases in quinuclidinylbenzilate (QNB) binding in cortex, but not striatum, of mice fed ethanol chronically. However, in hippocampus, where chronic ethanol ingestion had also induced an increase in QNB binding, the EC50 for carbachol stimulation of PIP2 breakdown was increased. Binding studies using the specific M1 muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist, pirenzepine, revealed that the number of pirenzepine-binding sites was increased in cortex, but not hippocampus (or striatum) of ethanol-fed mice. These results support the hypothesis that high affinity pirenzepine-binding sites are coupled to PIP2 breakdown in mouse cortex. The changes in cerebral cortex represent one of the first demonstrations of a functional correlate of a change in receptor density in ethanol-treated animals. Increased sensitivity to cholinergic agonists in cortex may contribute to particular signs of ethanol withdrawal.", 
    "61": "Hydrolysis of membrane phosphatidylinositol (PI) and polyphosphonoinositides (PPI) may be the coupling mechanism between receptor stimulation and the rise in intracellular calcium concentration that leads to smooth muscle contraction. In bovine tracheal smooth muscle, we correlated PI/PPI turnover, contraction and muscarinic receptor occupancy by carbamoylcholine (10(-9) to 10(-2) M). Inositol monophosphate formation after agonist stimulation, in the presence of lithium, provided a direct measurement of PI/PPI breakdown, and receptor occupancy was determined by [3H]quinuclidinyl benzylate binding. Carbamoylcholine caused a concentration-dependent contraction (EC50 = 7.4 X 10(-8) M), PI/PPI response (EC50 = 3.8 X 10(-5) M) and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzylate displacement (with high and low affinity binding sites have dissociation constants (Kd) of 3 X 10(-7) and 6 X 10(-4) M, respectively). This indicates the presence of spare receptors as maximal contraction is obtained when less than 20% of receptors are occupied. The concentration of carbamoylcholine inhibiting 50% of the PI/PPI response and 50% of maximal receptor occupancy (IC50) were similar for atropine (IC50 = 1 X 10(-9) and 5.3 X 10(-9) M, respectively), and for pirenzepine (IC50 = 3 X 10(-6) and 2.3 X 10(-6) M, respectively); the pA2 of the contraction was 8.3 +/- 0.12 for atropine and 7.2 +/- 0.08 for pirenzepine, indicating that M2 receptors may be largely predominant among bovine tracheal smooth muscle muscarinic receptors. Bovine tracheal smooth muscle may be a useful model to study the effects of other spasmogens, as it allows comparison of functional effects, PI breakdown and receptor occupancy in the same preparation.", 
    "62": "Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and several TRH analogs were examined in the [3H]-3-Me-His2-TRH ([3H]MeTRH) receptor-binding assay in rat amygdala, striatal and cortical membranes. The benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide, as reported in the literature was found to displace [3H]MeTRH with an IC50 value of 3.6 X 10(-7) M in amygdala membranes. Midazolam was, however, identified as being 6-fold more active than chlordiazepoxide with an IC50 value of 6.3 X 10(-8) M. The effect of these benzodiazepines on [3H]MeTRH binding did not appear to be related to their anxiolytic activity because the novel pyrazoloquinoline nonsedating anxiolytic, CGS 9896 was without effect on [3H]MeTRH binding at concentrations up to 1 X 10(-5) M. Chlordiazepoxide had similar activity in cortical membranes whereas midazolam was some 5 times less active in this preparation than in amygdala. Both compounds were weak displacers of [3H]MeTRH binding in striatal membranes, being at least two orders of magnitude less potent than in amygdala. In contrast TRH and its analogs, RX 77368 and DN-1417, were approximately 2 to 8 times more active in striatum than amygdala membranes. TRH and DN-1417 were less active in cortical membranes whereas RX 77368 was some three times more active than in striatum and amygdala. In three test procedures indicative of TRH agonist activity; thyroid-stimulating hormone release, reversal of pentobarbital sleeping time in mice and elevation of cerebellar cyclic GMP levels, the benzodiazepines were found to be devoid of activity, whereas TRH and related compounds produced their expected responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "The combination of derivatives of benzodiazepine and analgetics is used now routinely in clinical situations. In former investigations we studied the effect of these drugs on substrates and enzymes of glycolysis and metabolism of lipids, whereby we focused our interest on changes of phosphofructokinase activity. The aim of this study was to monitor the influence of anaesthesia on parameters of haemostasis (Kallikrein-kinin-system, coagulation, fibrinolysis and several proteinase inhibitors). Therefore plasma samples of patients undergoing diagnostic endoscopy were analysed. For anaesthesia a combination of midazolam and ketamine was used.", 
    "64": "Non-deprived male rats, familiarized with a highly palatable diet, were treated with 0.3-10.0 mg/kg of the imidazobenzodiazepine midazolam. The increases in consumption of the food observed at larger doses of midazolam were due to increases in the duration of feeding, but not in the rate of eating. These, in turn, were due to increases in the duration of eating bouts, but not in their frequency. The beta-carboline FG 7142, a partial benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist, reduced the consumption of the diet when it was injected at 10.0 and 15.0 mg/kg (IP). The overall duration of feeding was not affected at these doses in the 30 min test, but rate of eating was reduced. However, during the first 5 min interval of the test, when feeding behaviour was most motivated, FG 7142 did significantly reduce the duration of feeding. The effect depended upon a reduction in the duration of eating bouts, but not upon any change in their frequency. Hence, midazolam and FG 7142 had opposite effects on the duration of bouts of feeding. Both midazolam and FG 7142 reduced the frequencies of concurrent grooming, locomotor activity, and rearing in the test of palatable food consumption. Possible explanations for these effects are briefly considered.", 
    "65": "We evaluated stable isotope analogues (SIAs) as internal standards in mass spectral drug assays on the analytic parameters of accuracy, precision, specificity, and limit of quantitation. Only one literature report suggests that the use of an SIA made an assay more accurate, although theoretic considerations strongly support their use. There is substantial evidence, however, that their use made assays more precise. Potentially, the chromatographic peak shape and retention time of the SIA can be compared with those of the analyte to support assay specificity, and this type of comparison has been implemented as a new computer program (QSIMPS). There is some evidence that SIAs can serve in \"carrier\" substances to increase recoveries and thus lower the limit of quantitation of an assay. However, the use of large amounts of an SIA (relative to the analyte) leads to analytic imprecision, because of memory effects, large blank values, and unacceptable confidence limits.", 
    "66": "The effects of the intravenous infusion of midazolam on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2) were measured in rats in the presence and absence of nitrous oxide. Midazolam produced 40-45% decreases in CBF with no difference in response between nitrous oxide and nitrogen-ventilated rats. CMRO2 decreased 55% during midazolam infusion in rats ventilated with nitrogen, significantly more (P less than 0.05) than in rats ventilated with nitrous oxide (35%). We conclude that cerebrovascular responses to midazolam infusion were not altered by nitrous oxide and suggest that nitrous oxide may slightly but significantly stimulate brain metabolism during midazolam infusion.", 
    "67": "Intubating conditions have been assessed at 60 s following administration of vecuronium 0.1 mg kg-1 or atracurium 0.5 mg kg-1 given either as a single dose after induction of anaesthesia with thiopentone or in divided doses; vecuronium 0.015 mg kg-1 followed 4 or 6 min later by 0.085 mg kg-1, or atracurium 0.075 mg kg-1 followed 4 or 6 min later by 0.425 mg kg-1. In the divided dose groups the smaller initial (priming) dose was given prior to induction of anaesthesia. Onset and duration of clinical relaxation were assessed using a peripheral nerve stimulator. The intubating conditions at 60 s improved significantly, with the use of relaxants in divided doses being acceptable in 80 and 70% of patients, respectively, with vecuronium and atracurium, but the conditions are not as good as those commonly found using suxamethonium. Priming at 6 min has no advantage over priming at 4 min. The onset of complete block was accelerated with priming, but the difference was not significant. The duration of clinical relaxation of vecuronium was significantly prolonged by giving it in divided doses. Unpleasant awareness of muscle weakness was observed in 15 patients, requiring early induction of anaesthesia in five of them."
