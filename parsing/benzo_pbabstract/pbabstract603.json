    "0": "In the course of a clinical study oral administration of two different diazepine derivatives as well as i.m. injection of pethidine and promethazine have been explored with a view to their anxiolytic, sedating and hypnotic action. The study involved 128 patients, randomized into four groups. Group 1 received flunitrazepam 1,5-2 mg p.o. only the evening before operation to group 2 flunitrazepam 1,5-2 p.o. was administered the evening before and the morning of the operation, group 3 were given lormetazepam 2-2,5 mg p.o. at the same time as group 2, in group 4 nitrazepam, 5 mg p.o. the evening before operation and pethidine, 50-100 mg combined with promethazine, 25 mg was given i.m. 60 min before surgery. In group 1 anxiolytic and sedating effect of flunitrazepam were not persistent enough to provide the patient with adequate premedication until the onset of surgery. Intensive sedation and fatigue as well as minimum recollection were observed under medication 2, however, increase in anxiety and depression as well as deterioration of mood were not prevented. Under medication 3 patients felt less exhausted and fatigued than under medication 2, but likewise anxiety and depression increased in the course of the operating day. Group 4 emerged as the last effective premedication both with regard to sleep during the previous night and the conditions of the day of the operation itself.", 
    "1": "One of the very real complications possible in the use of local anesthetic agents is a relative overdose of the drug, resulting in an inordinate and potentially dangerous serum level. Even when using strict and careful technique, problems can occur. The reactions cited in the aforementioned cases were most likely the result of the accidental intravenous injection of a local anesthetic agent. Two cases were treated with anticonvulsants; one was not. In retrospect, it is possible that the seizure activity seen in Case 2 may have been prevented by an intravenous injection of benzodiazepine. A variety of currently available local anesthetic compounds has been deemed safe for common usage in the field of anesthesia. The majority of problems associated with their use stem from faulty technique, ignorance, mismanagement, or simple oversight, and are not necessarily due to any intrinsic property of the drug. Nevertheless, local anesthetics are potentially toxic and their use should be approached with knowledge of and a healthy respect for their associated complications. It should also be remembered that virtually all local anesthetic toxic reactions are preventable and treatable. Their occurrence need not necessarily result in a poor outcome.", 
    "2": "The haemostatic effect of a high concentration of ornipressin 5 IU/10 mls lidocaine was studied in 127 patients undergoing rhinosurgery under two types of general anaesthesia. Under halothane/enflurane anaesthesia blood pressure and heart rate remained nearly constant up to 15 minutes following local injection of ornipressin into the nasal tissues. Good haemostasis was achieved in 86.5 percent of cases. Under diazepam/fentanyl anaesthesia an elevation of blood pressure was observed following infiltration of ornipressin. Thus the high concentration cannot be recommended for cases with blood pressure dyscrasias. The haemostatic effect was either good in only 60 percent of the patients.", 
    "3": "Three cases of severe asthma requiring mechanical ventilatory support after sudden cardiorespiratory collapse developed myoclonus following the hypoxemic insult. They were unable to stand, walk or feed themselves because of these jerky involuntary movements which were worse on intention. Oral clonazepam in varying doses up to 8 mg daily improved the myoclonus remarkably such that they were able to perform these functions unaided.", 
    "4": "The effects of pirenzepine, a muscarinic antagonist, and cimetidine, a histamine H2-receptor antagonist, on 2-deoxy-D-glucose-stimulated gastric secretion were investigated in the gastric-fistula cat. Both drugs inhibited gastric acid secretion in a dose-related manner; the oral ED50 of pirenzepine was 0.37 (0.22-0.59) mg/kg and cimetidine was 4.6 (3.3-5.8) mg/kg. The two drugs affected pepsin secretion in characteristically different ways. The inhibition of pepsin secretion by cimetidine was small and inconsistent when compared with the effect on acid. Throughout the dose-range cimetidine tended to reduce volume more than pepsin secretion. The resulting rise in concentration of pepsin suggested that cimetidine had an indirect effect on pepsin secretion. In contrast, pirenzepine exerted a direct effect on both acid and pepsin. Hence at doses producing a 50% inhibition of acid secretion pirenzepine and cimetidine reduced pepsin secretion by 78% and 25% respectively. These observations were consistent with the concept that muscarinic receptors and not histamine H2-receptors are involved in the regulation of pepsin secretion.", 
    "5": "Many surgical procedures in otolaryngology, particularly those in the areas of facial plastic surgery, are best performed under a local anesthetic. The majority of these procedures may be done on an outpatient basis and require an intravenous analgesic of some form. This analgesic must be safe, predictable, easy to administer, have a rapid onset, and provide good amnesia. A short recovery period is imperative. Diazepam has been widely used in the outpatient setting, since it generally fulfills the requirements listed. However, the recovery time is often prolonged and unpleasant for the patient. Butorphanol tartrate, a synthetic narcotic, provides rapid analgesia in an intravenous dose, fulfills the other requirements for an analgesic agent suitable for outpatient use, and has a relatively short duration. Butorphanol tartrate has been used in an intravenous drip form for outpatient surgical procedures for the past 18 months. Its use in 400 cases representing a broad spectrum of facial plastic procedures has been closely monitored in both the operative and postoperative periods and the results tabulated. We have found butorphanol tartrate to be an excellent agent for local anesthetic procedures in the outpatient setting.", 
    "6": "Epilepsy, one of the oldest identified neurological disorders, is now recognized as a major public health problem affecting about 1 percent of the population. The author differentiates between two major types of the disorder, the generalized and partial epilepsies, and describes different kinds of seizures in epileptic patients. The improved ability of the clinician to diagnose the disorder through use of electroencephalography, intensive monitoring, and CT scan is highlighted. The author concludes with a discussion of the major drugs used to control seizures, their biological half-lives, side effects, and how they interact with other antiepileptic drugs.", 
    "7": "Using a dual isohypercapnic technique, the authors compared the effect on ventilatory control of midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) and thiopental (3.5 mg/kg) in normal volunteers and in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In normal volunteers the slope of the CO2 response curve decreased from 1.77 +/- 0.16 l . min-1 . mmHg-1 (mean +/- SEM) to a minimum of 1.14 +/- 0.17 l . min-1 . mmHg-1 3.5 min after midazolam, returning to 1.32 +/- 0.21 l . min-1 . mmHg-1 15 min after injection. In the same subjects, the slope of the CO2 response curve fell from 1.89 +/- 0.18 l . min-1 . mmHg-1 to a minimum of 1.37 +/- 0.29 l . min-1 . mmHg-1 one minute after injection of thiopental, returning to 1.69 +/- 0.22 l . min-1 . mmHg-1 15 min after injection. These changes were not statistically significant. In subjects with clinical COPD, the slope of the CO2 response curve decreased from 1.89 +/- 0.63 l . min-1 . mmHg-1 to a minimum of 0.39 +/- 0.19 l . min-1 . mmHg-1 two minutes after injection of midazolam (P less than 0.05 compared with control), while 15 min after injection, the slope recovered to only 0.62 +/- 0.40 l . min-1 . mmHg-1 (P less than 0.05 compared with control). In the same subjects, the slope of the CO2 response curve decreased from 1.53 +/- 0.17 to a minimum of 0.69 +/- 0.25 l . min-1 . mmHg-1 0.5 min after injection of thiopental, recovering to 1.47 +/- 0.28 l . min-1 . mmHg-1 15 min after injection. This was significantly greater than the corresponding slope after midazolam (P less than 0.05). The authors conclude that while the time course of ventilatory depression after thiopental is similar in normal volunteers and in patients with COPD, the ventilatory depression 15 minutes after midazolam is more profound in patients with COPD than in normal subjects.", 
    "8": "The effects of reducing two-drug treatment to single-drug therapy were studied prospectively in 36 patients with intractable complex partial seizures. In 30 patients (83%) this was possible without an increase in seizure frequency. In six patients (17%) the number of seizures was higher during single-drug therapy. The slow transfer was not complicated by unwanted withdrawal effects. The plasma concentration of the single drug was raised if necessary until clinical drug toxicity was observed. An improvement in seizure control was surprisingly noted in 13 patients (36%). In two patients seizures were completely controlled. In one patient a seizure reduction of 87% was observed. The number of patients with clinical side effects was similar during two-drug and single-drug therapy. The number of side effects was lower during single-drug therapy. Reduction of polypharmacy may be beneficial for patients with intractable epilepsy.", 
    "9": "Although it is known that hypercarbia increases and benzodiazepines decrease cerebral blood flow (CBF), the effects of benzodiazepines on CBF responsiveness to CO2 are not well documented. The influence on CBF and CBF-CO2 sensitivity of placebo or midazolam, which is a new water-soluble benzodiazepine, was measured in eight healthy volunteers using the noninvasive 133Xe inhalation method for CBF determination. Under normocarbia, midazolam decreased CBF from 40.6 +/- 3.2 to 27.0 +/- 5.0 ml 100 g-1 min-1 (means +/- SD). At a later session under hypercarbia, CBF was 58.8 +/- 4.4 ml 100 g-1 min-1 after administration of placebo, and 49.1 +/- 10.2 ml 100 g-1 min-1 after midazolam. The mean of the slopes correlating PaCO2 and CBF was significantly steeper with midazolam (2.5 +/- 1.2 ml 100 g-1 min-1 mm Hg-1) than with placebo (1.5 +/- 0.4 ml 100 g-1 min-1 mm Hg-1). Our results suggest that midazolam may be a safe agent to use in patients with intracranial hypertension, since it decreases CBF and thus cerebral blood volume; however, it should be administered with caution in nonventilated patients with increased intracranial pressure, since its beneficial effects on cerebrovascular tone can be readily counteracted by the increase in arterial CO2 tension induced by this drug.", 
    "10": "Progabide, a new antiepileptic GABA agonist of moderate affinity for GABA receptors, has been studied in a number of psychiatric disorders and the results compared with the action of this drug in animal models. In an animal model for anxiety (the aversive response to periaqueductal grey stimulation in the rat) progabide had a similar action to that of diazepam. However in clinical trials to date the effect of the GABA agonist was inferior to that of benzodiazepines. As progabide diminishes both the nigrostriatal dopamine neuron activity and the effects of striatal dopamine receptor activation, a trial in schizophrenic patients was undertaken. Progabide was devoid of any evident antipsychotic action. However a certain improvement in responsiveness to the environment and in social interactions was noticed in hebephrenic and schizoaffective syndromes. This lack of antipsychotic effect of progabide may be a reflection of the weak activity of GABA agonists on limbic dopamine neurons. In these various clinical trials a definite improvement of affect and mood was noted in those patients receiving progabide. In clinical trials in depressed patients progabide produces a significant reduction in depressive symptoms, an action similar to that of imipramine both for the global clinical rating and the HRSD. This antidepressant activity is reflected by the action of progabide in behavioural models of depression such as olfactory bulbectomy, learned helplessness and the sleep-wake cycle.", 
    "11": "Analbuminemia (idiopathic hypoalbuminemia) is a rare congenital anomaly of albumin characterised by very low levels of this protein. Only 21 cases have been reported in the literature. The lack of albumin is \"compensated\" by increased amounts of various circulating plasma proteins. Other not well understood regulatory mechanisms are responsible for the absence of severe clinical consequences. Clinical aspects, genetics and pathophysiology of this disease are discussed.", 
    "12": "After five years' extensive use of cimetidine, drug interactions have emerged as one of its major adverse effects. Clinically important interactions with warfarin, phenytoin, diazepam, chlormethiazole, propranolol, lidocaine, and a number of other drugs have been reported. An appreciation of the variety of underlying mechanisms, inhibition of drug metabolism, decreased liver blood flow, and altered drug distribution should reduce the risk of further drug interactions with cimetidine.", 
    "13": "The effect of diazepam on inhibition has been examined using an in vitro preparation of the guinea-pig olfactory cortex. Diazepam (0.03-30 mumol/l) doubled the intensity and duration of the recurrent inhibitory conductance. Diazepam had no effect on single evoked excitatory post-synaptic potential (e.p.s.p.) nor any effects on the action potential or membrane electrical constants. Diazepam (0.003-100 mumol/l) also reduced the multisynaptic e.p.s.p. generated through a recurrent pathway directed at the soma when elicited during the time-course of the inhibitory conductance. Diazepam had a comparitively small effect on the monosynaptic e.p.s.p. generated on the distal dendrite. Pentobarbitone had a similar though more intense effect over a narrow concentration range (10-200 mumol/l). The inhibitory coductance is thought to be GABA-mediated. Diazepam doubled the potency of the GABA analogue, muscimol, when applied via the bathing solution, whereas a modest 50 mumol/l pentobarbitone increased muscimol potency by about four-fold. The mild but selective effect of diazepam contrasts with the more intense and general effects of pentobarbitone and supports the idea that these drugs act through different mechanisms at the GABA receptor/channel complex.", 
    "14": "Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8), ceruletide (caerulein, CER) and 10 analogues of ceruletide, were studied in mice for antagonism of the tremors induced by harmine (5 mg/kg, s.c.), ibogaine (20 mg/kg, s.c.) and oxotremorine (0.2 mg/kg, s.c.). The following reference drugs were tested for comparison: prolyl-leucylglycine amide (MIF), atropine, haloperidol, biperiden, ethopropazine, trihexyphenidyl, methixene and clonazepam. All treatments were subcutaneous, the antagonists being given 10 min (in some trials 30 min) before the tremorogen. Tremorolytic potency (ED50) was calculated from dose-response curves. Against the tremors induced by either harmine or ibogaine, CCK-8 and ceruletide, as well as many of the analogues of ceruletide had greater tremorolytic potency than the reference drugs. Against oxotremorine, however, ceruletide and its most potent analogue, Nle8-CER (other analogues were not tested) were inactive and MIF showed very little effectiveness. Additional experiments on hypothermia and sedation as well as evaluation of previous studies on other central actions suggested that the tremorolytic effect of CCK-like peptides is independent of other central effects. The CCK-like peptides may play a physiological role in the regulation of extrapyramidal motor activity.", 
    "15": "Radiation inactivation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors in rat cerebral cortex membranes has been performed with 10 MeV electrons from a linear accelerator at temperatures less than or equal to -100 degrees C. Alpha 1-adrenoceptor inactivation was monitored with [ 3H ]-prazosin and [( 125I ]-2-(beta-4-hydroxylphenyl)ethylaminomethyl)tetralone [( 125I ]-HEAT). Saturation analysis of irradiated membranes with both ligands indicated that a decrease in alpha-adrenoceptor density occurred with increasing radiation dose. The dissociation constants of [ 3H ]-prazosin and [ 125I ]-HEAT were not markedly changed by the irradiation. Application of the target volume theory gave molecular weights of 91,500 +/- 1,700 (S.D.) (D37: 19,6 +/- 0.36 Mrad) with [ 125I ]-HEAT as ligand, and 77,000 +/- 18,000 (S.D.) (D37: 23.3 +/- 4.6 Mrad) with [ 3H ]-prazosin, respectively, when an empirical temperature correction factor of 2.8 was used. [ 3H ]-flunitrazepam-labelled benzodiazepine receptor target size was used as an internal control. The molecular weight of the alpha 1-adrenoceptors, corrected for this internal control, was 85,000 +/- 1.600 [( 125I ]-HEAT) and 71,500 +/- 17,000 [( 3H ]-prazosin).", 
    "16": "Rats were submitted to forced swimming and were killed 15 min after initiation of the stress and at 1 h, 1 day and 4 days thereafter. Immediately after the stress there was a decrease of 30% in the density of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites in the cerebral cortex and of 27% in the hippocampal formation, with no changes in all the other brain areas studied. These changes in the number of benzodiazepine receptors were also corroborated by the binding of [3H]ethyl-beta-carboline carboxylate. For both ligands there were no changes in affinity. These effects were selective for the benzodiazepine receptors and no changes in alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta adrenoceptors and in dopaminergic receptors were observed. One hour after the stress, the number of benzodiazepine receptors had recovered in the cerebral cortex (8% above the control) and had increased greatly in the hippocampal formation (+53%). One day after the stress, the [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the cerebral cortex reached the normal level but it was still slightly elevated (+16%) in the hippocampus. These results are discussed in relation to some contradictory findings in the literature and to the fact that the hippocampal formation is related to neural mechanisms underlying behavior and neuroendocrine regulation.", 
    "17": "A brain polypeptide termed diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) and thought to be chemically and functionally related to the endogenous effector of the benzodiazepine recognition site was purified to homogeneity. This peptide gives a single band of protein on NaDodSO4 and acidic urea gel electrophoresis. A single UV-absorbing peak was obtained by HPLC using three different columns and solvent systems. DBI has a molecular mass of approximately equal to 11,000 daltons. Carboxyl-terminus analysis shows that tyrosine is the only residue while the amino-terminus was blocked. Cyanogen bromide treatment of DBI yields three polypeptide fragments, and the sequences of two of them have been determined for a total of 45 amino acids. DBI is a competitive inhibitor for the binding of [3H]diazepam, [3H]flunitrazepam, beta-[3H]carboline propyl esters, and 3H-labeled Ro 15-1788. The Ki for [3H]-diazepam and beta-[3H]carboline binding were 4 and 1 microM, respectively. Doses of DBI that inhibited [3H]diazepam binding by greater than 50% fail to change [3H]etorphine, gamma-amino[3H]butyric acid, [3H]-quinuclidinyl benzilate, [3H]dihydroalprenolol, [3H]adenosine, and [3H]imipramine binding tested at their respective Kd values. DBI injected intraventricularly at doses of 5-10 nmol completely reversed the anticonflict action of diazepam on unpunished drinking and, similar to the anxiety-inducing beta-carboline derivative FG 7142 (beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester), facilitated the shock-induced suppression of drinking by lowering the threshold for this response.", 
    "18": "A series of oxopyridobenzothiazines (azaphenothiazines) were prepared and evaluated for binding to the benzodiazepine receptor, anticonvulsant activity in the pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsion assay, and, in two cases, ability to increase punished responding in a standard conflict test. While parent compound 1a showed binding affinity comparable to chlorodiazepoxide (CDP), its potency in the anticonvulsant assay and the anticonflict test was considerably weaker than CDP. Of the variety of derivatives synthesized, only the 7-chloro compound 1b showed receptor affinity comparable to 1a with slightly improved in vivo activity. The poor correlation between receptor binding and in vivo activity may be due to variability in absorption or pharmacological responses unrelated to affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "19": "Injection of folic acid (FA) into the nucleus substantia innominata (NSI) was found to decrease [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) binding in the frontal cortex, pyriform cortex, amygdala, and the NSI itself without changing the KD. Binding in the thalamus, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and substantia nigra was not affected. [3H]Flunitrazepam binding was unchanged in all eight regions studied. Previous work indicates FA injections into the NSI produce epileptiform activity and cause loss of GABAergic and possibly other neurons in the frontal and pyriform cortices, the amygdala, and thalamus. The reductions of [3H]QNB binding in the first three of these regions are interpreted as indicating that many of the neurons lost are cholinoceptive, a finding that supports the previous hypothesis that activation of cholinergic projections from the NSI is an important part of the mechanism of cell loss in these regions.", 
    "20": "[3H]Ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ( [3H] beta-CCE) binds to a homogeneous population of recognition sites in rat whole brain membranes with high affinity. The [3H]beta-CCE binding is completely displaceable by low concentrations of a number of benzodiazepines with similar potencies found when using a 3H-benzodiazepine as the ligand. This suggests that the recognition sites for beta-CCE and the benzodiazepines are identical or that they are involved in a close interaction. The binding of [3H]beta-CCE does not obey simple mass-action kinetics. [3H]Flunitrazepam dissociation from its receptor population is biphasic, and different methods of initiation of this dissociation indicate that cooperative interactions take place within the receptor population. We conclude that the benzodiazepine receptor is a single entity that can exist in two conformations, the equilibrium between which may be controlled by some as yet unidentified factor.", 
    "21": "The effects of temperature on the interaction of various ligands with the benzodiazepine receptor were studied in rat brain membrane preparations. The affinities of all ligands studied were reduced on raising the temperature from 4 to 37 degrees C. The variation of affinity constant with temperature deviated from the classical relationship for both the anticonvulsant ligand [3H]flunitrazepam and the proconvulsant ligand [3H]ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate. This implies a variation of observed enthalpy change of binding with temperature. Possible reasons for this are discussed. Gamma-Aminobutyric acid and sodium chloride both enhance the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam--the former by an increase in the entropic component of the binding energy, and the latter by an increase in the enthalpic component. In a series of ligands of different biological activities, no simple correlation was observed between biological activity and temperature dependence of binding.", 
    "22": "Fetal mouse cerebral cortex in culture was exposed chronically to diazepam, and benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor activity was assayed on the intact cell. Results have indicated: (1) minimal evidence of generalized drug toxicity, determined by choline acetyltransferase activity, tetanus labeling, high-affinity uptakes of gamma-aminobutyric acid and beta-alanine, protein, and light microscopy; (2) a significant dose-dependent reduction (down-regulation) of BDZ receptor activity that occurs after chronic exposure to clinically relevant concentrations of the drug; (3) a disproportionate suppression of the neuronal portion of the receptor after both acute and chronic exposure; and (4) recovery patterns of the BDZ receptor that differ substantially after acute versus chronic treatment. The latter finding may partially explain the observed clinical manifestations of drug tolerance and reduced anticonvulsant efficacy after prolonged use of this class of drugs.", 
    "23": "In 32 patients with major depressive disorders diagnosed according to Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC), somatosensory evoked potentials elicited at four levels of tactile fingertip stimulation were recorded. Four peak-to-baseline amplitudes (P100, N140, P200, and P300) and two peak-to-trough amplitudes (P100-N140 and N140-P200) plus their amplitude/stimulus intensity slopes were selected for analysis. All 12 measures were adjusted to same sex, age, height, and weight. Values were linearly and curvilinearly correlated with adjusted levels of homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MPHG), hypoxanthine, and xanthine in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), monoamine and purine metabolites, respectively. Significant negative linear correlations were found between the P300 amplitude and both HVA and hypoxanthine, and between the P200 slope and both 5HIAA and hypoxanthine. A significant positive correlation existed between the N140-P200 slope and 5HIAA. Curvilinear bivariate regressions demonstrated complex topologies of regression surfaces. Neither attention nor benzodiazepine medication were of significant importance in these relationships.", 
    "24": "Twenty-one medically screened insomniacs were studied over 59 nights in a double-blind, parallel groups design study. The 7 patients receiving a short-acting (triazolam) and the 7 receiving a long-acting (flurazepam) benzodiazepine hypnotic showed a similar pattern and magnitude of sleep EEG changes, especially during the latter part of the 37-night treatment period. Both groups significantly increased sleep spindle rate and decreased delta count per minute. The patterns of withdrawal were also similar. Plasma levels of N-desalkylflurazepam were not significantly related to the magnitude of EEG changes.", 
    "25": "A study of the literature showed that the GABA system is an important target of ethanol in the central nervous system, in part as a consequence of damage in membrane-bound enzymes and receptors. A single dose of ethanol initially activates the GABA system which is weakened after chronic administration because of overcompensation. Interest is focused on the GABA receptors because of the involvement of the minor tranquilizer drugs, benzodiazepines. The studies on the GABA system (metabolism, local concentrations, receptors) show great promise in the understanding and treatment of ethanol dependence and withdrawal.", 
    "26": "Lormetazepam significantly reduced anxiety during local anaesthesia when compared with a placebo control group. There were significantly fewer accompanying symptoms of spinal anaesthesia under lormetazepam than under placebo. This number fell in relation to the decrease in the patients' anxiety. Lormetazepam also proved to be significantly superior to placebo according to the physician's assessment of anxiety. There were no differences between the two groups with respect to side-effects. The results of the Erlanger Anxiety Scale--Situative (EAS-S) revealed: 1. Oral treatment with lormetazepam led to markedly lower anxiety values than treatment with placebo (p less than 0.1; t test, one-sided). - 2. Following additional, intravenous administration of lormetazepam an even greater difference between the two treatment groups became evident. - 3. The situative anxiety was lower under treatment with lormetazepam than with placebo, independent of the variables \"sex\", \"trait anxiety\" or \"anxiety control mechanism\" (dimension of sensitization-repression). - 4. Women attained higher actual anxiety values than did men. - 5. Patients with high basic anxiety expectedly attained higher situative anxiety scores than those with lower basic anxiety.", 
    "27": "Rats adapted to a 23-hr water deprivation regimen were allowed a daily 1-hr water rehydration session. On test days the session drinking fluid was 1.5% NaCl solution rather than water. One group was injected (SC) with the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 (2.5-10 mg/kg) and another group with the agonist agent midazolam (0.13-2.0 mg/kg) every 5-6 days at 10 and 15 min before a test session, respectively. Both Ro 15-1788 and midazolam increased 1.5% NaCl solution intake in a dose-related manner. In this study and in previous research, benzodiazepines and barbiturates were shown to increase the intake of hypertonic NaCl solutions. The present results reveal a similar effect for Ro 15-1788, indicating an agonistic dimension to the spectrum of action of this specific receptor antagonist.", 
    "28": "The evaluation and management of the violent patient in emergency settings is a complicated task for emergency psychiatric specialists. Etiologic considerations must be carefully weighed. The interplay of biologic, psychologic, and social factors has to be clearly recognized. Psychiatrists and physicians staffing emergency departments must be facile with the application of psychopharmacologic treatment. In addition, a familiarity and comfort with physical restraint must be developed. Interview styles and stances that diverge from traditional psychiatric \"examining\" should be employed. There is no sure-fire way to prevent violence, but adhering to the above principles should help to minimize violence as well as allow staff to comfort this most difficult aspect of emergency psychiatry.", 
    "29": "Flunitrazepam premedication administered orally or intramuscularly was compared in 41 surgical patients. The effect of the premedication was assessed both subjectively and objectively. The plasma concentrations were determined just before induction. The mean (+/-SD) plasma concentration in the oral premedication group was 8.2 +/- 2.2 ng/ml and 7.9 +/- 4.6 ng/ml in the intramuscular premedication group. There was a highly significant correlation (p less than 0.001) between the sedative effect and plasma concentration of flunitrazepam in all patients. Oral flunitrazepam was equal to i. m. flunitrazepam as an anxiolytic and sedative with a rapid onset of action. However, the oral route of administration of flunitrazepam is preferable because it is painless and easy to administer.", 
    "30": "Studies on the treatments for neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia published in the literature are reviewed. The great number of different treatments and the controversial results of most studies show that there is as yet no specific and safe treatment for tardive dyskinesia. Suggestions for well-designed treatment studies are given: Placebo-controlled double-blind design, larger patient populations, clear diagnostic and standard observing and rating conditions using different assessment methods and videotapes, withdrawal of neuroleptics and antiparkinsonian drugs to discover reversible tardive dyskinesia. If this procedure is not feasible, neuroleptics and other drugs should be maintained at a stable dose level. Longer term studies of some months are necessary to study the prolonged efficacy of different drugs. The effect of dopamine-antagonists such as neuroleptics and of dopamine-depleting agents such as reserpine and oxypertine is of limited duration. Dopamine-agonists such as L-Dopa, bromocriptine and amantadine help only few patients and may even aggravate the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. In some double-blind studies cholinergic drugs such as lecithin and deanol have improved tardive dyskinesia, but further controlled studies are needed. Anticholinergic drugs such as antiparkinsonian agents should not be prescribed because they may aggravate tardive dyskinesia. Some patients respond to GABA-ergic agents such as baclofen, sodium valproate and the benzodiazepines, but further studies are needed before the value of GABA-ergic agents in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia can be properly assessed. After withdrawal of neuroleptics the average of remission rates within a year is 20%-30%. Elderly patients are more likely to have persistent dyskinesias. A progressive stepwise diminution of the neuroleptic dose and of the antiparkinsonian agents is recommended. When a patient's psychosis is exacerbated after withdrawal of the neuroleptics and tardive dyskinesia is also present, small doses of thioridazine, clozapine or tiapride can be administered. If this practice is not successful cholinergic or GABA-ergic agents may be useful. Because no currently available therapeutic agents satisfies the criteria of safety, marked effectiveness and prolonged efficacy in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia, prevention becomes more important. Prolonged use of a neuroleptic medication requires careful evaluation of indications and risks. The doses of neuroleptic drugs during the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia should be as small as possible.", 
    "31": "Effects of tofisopam, a new 2,3-benzodiazepine compound, were investigated on the following: gastric ulceration, induced by water-immersion stress in normal rats and by immobilization stress in olfactory-bulbectomized (OB) rats; and propulsion of the small intestine caused by water-immersion stress in rats and autonomic responses to electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus in rabbits. In the latter, the results were compared with those of diazepam and gamma-oryzanol. Tofisopam (30 and 100 mg/kg, po) significantly inhibited the gastric ulceration induced by water-immersion stress in normal rats in a dose-dependent manner. Immobilization-stress loading increased the incidence and average index of gastric ulceration in OB rats, compared with nonstressed rats. Tofisopam (100 mg/kg, po) significantly inhibited the gastric ulceration induced by stress loading in OB rats. Water-immersion stress loading induced a significant increase in intestinal propulsion in rats. This increase was reversed to control levels by tofisopam (100 mg/kg, po). Tofisopam (1.0 mg/kg, iv, or 0.1 mg/kg by intracerebrospinal injection) inhibited the constriction of ear microvessels, the decrease in earlobe temperature, and mydriasis induced by electrical stimulation of the medial hypothalamic area in rabbits. However, diazepam and gamma-oryzanol failed to inhibit the autonomic responses to medial hypothalamic stimulation. From these results, it can be concluded that tofisopam restores the autonomic abnormality induced by stress loading possibly via intervention in the central autonomic area, i.e., the hypothalamus, by an action different from that of diazepam.", 
    "32": "The dose range of estazolam for hypnotic effects was studied in seven men and eight women (mean age 30.3 +/- 8.6 years) who complained of insomnia and had polysomnographic evidence of disturbed sleep. Patients slept in the laboratory and were monitored using standard polysomnographic techniques. Four consecutive nights in the laboratory with placebo, which served as baseline and screening nights, were followed by five 2-night drug administration periods separated by 5-day drug washout periods spent at home. Each of the patients received a sequence of four doses (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg) of estazolam and placebo administered according to a Latin square design and in a double-blind manner. Estazolam significantly increased total sleep time and reduced time awake during sleep in a dose-dependent manner. Sleep latency parameters were reduced systematically with increasing doses of estazolam, but these effects on sleep latency were not statistically significant. Increasing doses of estazolam had systematic and statistically significant effects on sleep stages. Subjective estimations of sleep were consistent with the polysomnographic findings bur were not statistically significant.", 
    "33": "In 32 patients with major depressive disorders according to Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC), symptomatology was rated using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS), and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) elicited by tactile fingertip stimuli were recorded at the vertex of the scalp. Patients were drug-free except for benzodiazepines. Amplitudes and amplitude/stimulus intensity slopes were adjusted to same sex, age, height, and weight. Uni-and multivariate correlations revealed associations between the N140-P200 amplitude and hypothyroidlike aspects of depression with symptoms such as poor appetite and indecisiveness, and between the P100-N140 slope and intrapunitive aspects of depression with symptoms such as negative self-evaluation and suicidal attempts. Neither attention level nor benzodiazepine medication were reflected in these relationships.", 
    "34": "In a randomised crossover study in volunteers plasma midazolam levels were estimated for 24 h following 15 mg by mouth, either preceded by no medication or following 24 h therapy with ranitidine. Administration of the H2-receptor blocker significantly increased bioavailability of the benzodiazepine and resulted in higher plasma levels for the first 6 h after taking midazolam. This was accompanied by a greater soporific effect.", 
    "35": "The effect of the intrathecal administration of midazolam 0.5-1.0 mg in 1-2 ml of physiological saline solution, has been observed on responses evoked in renal sympathetic nerves by supramaximal electrical stimulation of radial and tibial nerves. In artificially ventilated dogs anaesthetized with alpha-chloralose, the intrathecal administration of midazolam caused a marked depression of reflexes evoked from the tibial nerve but had no effect on either spontaneous sympathetic activity or reflexes evoked by radial nerve stimulation. Neither the small amount (1-2 microliters) of benzyl alcohol, present as a preservative (administered intrathecally), nor midazolam 1 mg kg-1 i.v. caused any significant depression of the evoked somato--sympathetic reflexes. The effects of intrathecal midazolam were reversed by the benzodiazepine antagonists Ro 15-1788 1 mg kg-1 i.v. and Ro 15-3505 1-2 mg kg-1 i.v. but not by naloxone 2 mg i.v. It is suggested that the antinociceptive effect of locally applied midazolam could be the result of a non-opioid GABA-mediated system which may have implications in the management of pain.", 
    "36": "Cimetidine is a widely used antiulcer medication that is also a potent inhibitor of the mixed-function oxidase enzymes in the liver. This effect results in a number of clinically important interactions with other drugs, which are now being appreciated. Other effects of cimetidine, such as raising of gastric pH, alteration of liver blood flow, or alterations in renal secretory mechanisms, may also contribute to or result in clinically significant interactions. Current data document appreciable alterations in the metabolism or excretion of warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, lidocaine, certain beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, certain benzodiazepines, and probably narcotic analgesics and procainamide. Thus, effects of these drugs and serum levels, where available, should be more closely followed when used in combination with cimetidine. Cimetidine appears to exacerbate the myelosuppressive effects of the nitrosoureas, and may also significantly alter the absorption of ketoconazole. Though other drugs may affect the absorption or elimination of cimetidine, the clinical implication of these effects is uncertain.", 
    "37": "The influence of obesity on the distribution or clearance of lorazepam and oxazepam, two benzodiazepines biotransformed by glucuronide conjugation, was studied in a series of obese subjects (mean weight 113 kg; mean percent IBW 179%) and healthy controls of normal body habitus matched for age and sex. Overweight subjects and controls received 2 to 3 mg of lorazepam intravenously or 30 mg of oxazepam orally. Absolute Vd in obese compared to control subjects was increased for both lorazepam (131 vs. 77 L, p less than 0.001) and oxazepam (97 vs. 38 L, p less than 0.001). When normalized to body weight, Vd/kg was similar for both drugs. Total metabolic clearance was similarly increased in the obese cohort for lorazepam (102 vs. 63 ml/min, p less than 0.005) and oxazepam (157 vs. 50 ml/min, p less than 0.001). Again, when normalized to body weight, clearance per kilogram was similar for both drugs. Since both Vd and clearance increased with body weight, elimination half-life (dependent on both Vd and clearance) was not significantly different in obese subjects (lorazepam 16.5 vs. 14.9 hr; oxazepam 7.7 vs. 8.9 hr). A random subgroup of obese and control subjects received a single intravenous dose of acetaminophen, also biotransformed by conjugation. Acetaminophen clearance was significantly correlated with that of lorazepam (r = 0.59, p less than 0.01) and oxazepam (r = 0.87, p less than 0.001), and clearance of LRZ and OXZ were similarly intercorrelated (r = 0.72, p less than 0.01). Thus obesity is associated with enhanced capacity for biotransformation of drugs via glucuronide conjugation. conjugating capacity increases in proportion to TBW and is consistent among drugs biotransformed by this mechanism.", 
    "38": "Alprazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine first developed as an anxiolytic, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of depression in several comparison studies with tricyclic antidepressants. This open label study examined the efficacy and safety of alprazolam in patients aged 56-78. Of 18 patients with evaluable data, 12 were responders (improvement greater than or equal to 50% on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale); 4 patients were partial responders (HAM-D improvement of 25%-49%); and 2 patients were nonresponders. Initial drowsiness was the only side effect observed.", 
    "39": "The effects of benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788, alone or with diazepam, were studied in mice on convulsions induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). We found that Ro 15-1788 (1 mg/kg) was able to antagonize the anticonvulsive effects of diazepam (1 mg/kg), but also had, with submaximal doses of PTZ (65 mg/kg), its own anticonvulsive action. At very low doses (0.1 mg/kg), it even potentiated the anticonvulsive effects of diazepam (0.05 mg/kg). This dual action provides evidence for partial agonist properties of the antagonist Ro 15-1788.", 
    "40": "Cultures of fetal mouse spinal cord were exposed to 12.6 microM (3.6 micrograms/ml) diazepam for 7 days. After drug removal, benzodiazepine receptor binding was assayed on intact cells and intracellular recordings of diazepam effects on GABA-mediated inhibitory responses were obtained. The biochemical and electrophysiological data revealed significant and parallel reductions in both receptor binding and pharmacological action on GABA responses which did not return to control levels until 3-4 days after removal of diazepam. The results indicate that chronic exposure of spinal cord cultures to diazepam results in a reversible down-regulation of diazepam binding and function.", 
    "41": "Several investigators have shown that anxiolytic benzodiazepines stimulate additional water consumption in rats made thirsty by water deprivation. The present report extends this work by showing that chlordiazepoxide (CDP) enhanced drinking in rats challenged with either cellular or extracellular dehydration, following hypertonic saline or polyethylene glycol injection respectively. Since CDP also increased drinking in control animals, it may have produced a direct dipsogenic effect which acted additively with respect to the physiological thirst challenges. In contrast, CDP did not enhance water intake during the dipsogenic action of the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol. The data provide new evidence that benzodiazepine mechanisms may be involved in thirst and the controls of drinking.", 
    "42": "Intravenous administration of 3-carboethoxy-beta-carboline (beta-CCE, 10 mg/kg) to rats resulted in multiple bursts of rhythmic waves (2-4 second duration, 5-7 Hz) with amplitudes of 100-250 microV. Pretreatment of animals with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonists CGS 8216 prevented the electroencephalographic seizures elicited by beta-CCE. This dose of CGS 8216 did not produce any electroencephalographic abnormalities when administered alone. These observations suggest that the electroencephalographic seizures elicited by beta-CCE are mediated via an interaction with benzodiazepine receptors. An in vitro study of the rate of degradation of beta-CCE and 3-carbomethoxy-beta-carboline (beta-CCM) in rat plasma demonstrated that the rate of degradation of the former compound was three times more rapid than the latter. These observations, taken together with previous studies demonstrating that parenteral administration of beta-CCM elicits tonic and clonic seizures, suggests that pharmacokinetic factors may be involved in defining the pharmacologic profile of beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid esters.", 
    "43": "The muscle relaxant effects of diazepam and progabide were studied in mutant Han-Wistar rats which exhibit spontaneous tonic activity in the electromyogram of the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle. Treatment with diazepam or progabide produced a dose-related reduction of the spontaneous activity measured in the electromyogram. The depressant effect of diazepam, but not that of progabide was antagonized by the specific benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788. From these data it is apparent that the muscle relaxant effect of progabide is not mediated through an alteration of benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "44": "Ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta CCE), a benzodiazepine antagonist, was found to increase basal levels of cyclic GMP in rat cerebellum. beta CCE also augmented the elevation of cyclic GMP concentrations induced by isoniazid, in contrast to diazepam which blocked this effect of isoniazid. Administration of beta CCE and diazepam together cancelled each other's effect on the elevation of cyclic GMP levels after isoniazid. Ro 15-1788, another potent benzodiazepine antagonist, was found to have virtually no effect on cyclic GMP levels in naive or isoniazid-treated rats. Ro 15-1788 antagonized diazepam's lowering of the elevation of cyclic GMP content of cerebellum after isoniazid. Ro 15-1788 also blocked the increase in cyclic GMP levels elicited by beta CCE, indicating that this effect of beta CCE involves its interaction at benzodiazepine receptors. Some pharmacological actions of beta CCE might be based on hindering GABA transmission.", 
    "45": "Administration of 4 mg/kg per day of diazepam in the drinking water for 14 days produced a small, but not significant decrease of benzodiazepine binding sites for [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate. Similar treatment with the benzodiazepine antagonist RO 15-1788 resulted in a marked increase in the density of sites for both ligands in the synaptosomal membranes of cerebral cortex and hippocampal formation.", 
    "46": "An examination of the development of benzodiazepine binding of the high and low affinity triazolopyridizine (TPZ) type was undertaken in rat cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. Various concentrations of a typical triazolopyridizine, CL-218-872, were used to displace [3H]flunitrazepam from synaptosomal fractions from rats of postnatal ages day 0, 7, 14, 21, 35 and 70. In contrast to the cortex and cerebellum, hippocampus displays high affinity TPZ binding at birth, prior to the periods of dendritic elaboration and synaptogenesis, suggesting that adult proportions of high and low affinity sites are maintained throughout postnatal development. Delayed postnatal development of high affinity TPZ sites is observed in the cerebellum, similar to the postnatal development previously observed in the cortex.", 
    "47": "Treatment of rat cerebellar membranes with phospholipase A2 (PLA2) or phospholipase C (PLC) increased basal [3H]diazepam binding at 0 degrees C with concomitant disappearance of the stimulatory effect of Cl- ion on the binding. On the other hand, these treatments did not affect the stimulatory effect of GABA, nor the maximum enhancement obtained in the presence of both GABA and Cl- ion. These results suggest that PLA2 or PLC modified the phospholipids responsible for the interaction between the benzodiazepine receptor and the Cl- ionophore. This assumption was supported by the results of thermodynamic experiments which showed that the changes in thermodynamic parameters occurring after the addition of Cl- ion resembled those after PLA2 or PLC treatment. Since the effect of PLA2 was evident at very low concentrations, and a PLC concentration of at least one order of magnitude higher was required to induce a similar effect, the change of phospholipids especially to lysophospholipids seems to be of particular importance. Protein release from the membrane, which also occurs after PLA2 or PLC treatment, did not appear to be responsible for the present phenomenon.", 
    "48": "It has long been known that gastroduodenal ulcers may heal spontaneously; this is the placebo effect in which the healing rate ranges from 20% at 2 weeks to 80% at 8 weeks. Two or three weeks can be gained by using cimetidine or ranitidine, with healing rates of 42% at 2 weeks and 85% at 6 weeks. Ranitidine probably has less side-effects than cimetidine. A new drug, omeprozole, appears to be much more potent but is not yet available. A vagolytic drug with specific affinity to the stomach (pirenzepine), as well as low-dosage bismuth bi-citrate and gastric mucosa protectors (sucralfate) are now returning in force.", 
    "49": "A gas--liquid chromatographic method for the simultaneous determination of triazolam and its major hydroxy metabolite (1-hydroxymethyltriazolam) in human plasma and urine is described. After addition of two internal standards to the biological fluid, extraction at pH 9, acid washing, back-extraction, and derivatization, the analysis was performed on a wall-coated superior capacity open-tubular (WSCOT) CP-Sil 5 capillary column with electron-capture detection. The detection limit was 0.1-0.2 ng/ml; reproducibility was about 6-7% for plasma concentrations below 1 ng/ml. No interference from other possible minor hydroxy metabolites of triazolam was found. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry validated the chromatographic results. The method was successfully applied to plasma specimens collected from healthy human volunteers following a single intravenous administration of 1 mg of triazolam or 1-hydroxymethyltriazolam.", 
    "50": "The effects of the benzodiazepine antagonist CGS 8216 (2-phenylpyrazolo[4,3-c]quinoline-3(5H)-one) were examined in a thirsty rat conflict test in the presence and absence of pentobarbital. CGS 8216 (2.5-10 mg/kg i.p.) did not affect nonpunished responding, but doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg significantly reduced the rate of punished responding (i.e., the number of 3 second drinking episodes in a \"shock\" contingency). However, a dose of CGS 8216 which did not significantly alter punished responding (2.5 mg/kg) antagonized the anticonflict actions of pentobarbital. These observations suggest that while high doses of CGS 8216 may elicit an \"anxiogenic\" response in rodents, lower doses of CGS 8216 antagonize the anticonflict actions of a compound which has been shown to enhance benzodiazepine affinity in vitro. These data imply that the anticonflict actions of pentobarbital may be mediated through benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "51": "Attractive characteristics of benzodiazepines are their efficiency in reducing anxiety and nervous tension and their safety as to serious side effects and intoxication. Although not producing tolerance, they can lead to dependence. Withdrawal symptoms may occur after long-term use even of therapeutic doses. Their effectiveness in alleviating many states of distress and even common lack of well-being may lead to abuse both for the patient, who puts off the necessary problem-solving, and for the physicians by inducing them to medicalize trivial life-crises. The indication for the use of benzodiazepines should therefore be restricted and prescription limited to short-term administration.", 
    "52": "Benzodiazepine and GABA binding sites in the rat retina are influenced by a vitamin A-free diet. In rats fed a vitamin A-free diet, the total number of [3H]GABA and [3H]diazepam binding sites was markedly higher than in rats given a balanced diet. No differences were found in the apparent affinities of [3H]GABA and [3H]diazepam for their specific binding sites. The results suggest that GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites have a role in the function of the retina.", 
    "53": "Several benzodiazepines (chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, diazepam, midazolam, nitrazepam and oxazepam) produced a concentration-dependent enhancement of low affinity GABA binding to fresh, washed brain membranes in 50 mM Tris-citrate buffer at concentrations comparable to those displacing [3H]diazepam binding in vitro. The nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics CL218872 and zopiclone also enhanced GABA binding, while the centrally inactive benzodiazepine Ro5-4864 failed to alter GABA binding. The benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro15-1788 did not alter GABA binding but potently antagonised stimulation of GABA binding by 100 nM diazepam. These pharmacological characteristics suggest that an enhancement of the binding of GABA to low affinity receptor sites may give rise to many of the in vivo actions of the benzodiazepines.", 
    "54": "Rats were rendered epileptic by subpial injection of an FeCl3 solution. Epileptiform discharges, recorded by chronically implanted extradural electrodes, were evident within 48 h of surgery and persisted for more than 6 months. It is demonstrated that this model is useful for studying new antiepileptic agents since a series of clinically effective drugs (diazepam, clonazepam, Na phenobarbital, primidone, carbamezepine, ethosuximide, diphenylhydantoin, Na valproate, GABOB) show an activity which is does-dependent and within a range satisfactorily related to human dosages.", 
    "55": "A sensitive, accurate, and precise method for the analysis of clonazepam in serum was developed. The drug and internal standard from serum extracts were methylated to obviate carbamazepine interference and then resolved on a 5 micron C18 HPLC column. The mobile phase could also be used for many other basic drugs.", 
    "56": "This study investigates the effects of assigned diagnostic labels, with their accompanying predictions of therapeutic response, and prescribed psychotropic drugs. It was thought that such 'labelling' effects might be important in ambiguous situations, such as neurotic anxiety-depressive states, where diagnoses of 'reactive depression' or 'anxiety state' might justifiably be made and treatment with either diazepam or nortriptyline legitimately given. The depression label and its concomitant two-weekly prediction of improvement with antidepressants produced a set towards slower response with higher self-report depression. Nortriptyline produced significantly more improvement in self-report depression than diazepam in the first 2 weeks of treatment. No significant interaction effects were detected between diagnosis or drug. One month after the initial diagnostic evaluation there were no significant effects from either diagnostic label or drug.", 
    "57": "1 The sedative effects in rats of two phenylquinolines, PK 9084 and PK 8165 (5-50 mg/kg), were examined in a holeboard: both when given alone and when given in conjunction with chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg). 2 Both phenylquinolines produced significant dose-related decreases in locomotor activity and rearing, with an ED50 about twice that for chlordiazepoxide. 3 When the phenylquinolines were combined with chlordiazepoxide the degree of sedation was equal to that seen with either drug given alone, whichever produced the greater sedation; the sedative effects of the two drugs were never additive. 4 PK 9084 (10 and 50 mg kg) significantly reduced rectal temperature, as did chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg), but there was no addition nor interaction of their effects. 5 Both phenylquinolines also reduced exploratory head-dipping, as did chlordiazepoxide, but in combination they antagonized each other's effects. 6 The classification of the phenylquinolines as non-sedative anxiolytics, acting as agonists at the benzodiazepine receptors needs revision.", 
    "58": "Access to a highly palatable 0.005 M sodium saccharin solution resulted in considerable overdrinking in nondeprived rats over a 6 hr observation period. Contrary to previous reports documenting benzodiazepine-induced hyperdipsia in animals challenged with thirst stimuli or in animals exhibiting schedule-induced drinking, diazepam (0.1-3.0 mg/kg) had no effect to enhance the intake of the saccharin solution. Instead, diazepam produced a significant suppression of fluid consumption, in a manner not monotonically related to dose. Thus, diazepam (0.3 mg/kg) produced maximal suppression which did not dissipate over a 6 hr period, while diazepam (3.0 mg/kg) had no effect. Possible behavioral mechanisms by which low dose diazepam treatment might reduce the drinking are briefly considered.", 
    "59": "In a free-choice situation, chlordiazepoxide (CDP; 12.5 or 25 mg/100 ml; groups B or C), when incorporated in ethanol solutions (2 to 20%, v/v), caused a significant decrease in ethanol preference index (P.I.). This was probably due to the combined CNS effects of both drugs rather than a taste effect, since the mice did not discriminate between aqueous CDP solutions and water. However, when the mice had prior exposure to ethanol and CDP was incorporated intermittently, no significant decreases in P.I. resulted. In a no-choice situation, ethanol intake was increased only on the first day of each intermittent incorporation of CDP (3 days for each 6-day cycle), being more persistent in group B (2 to 15% ethanol) than in group C (2 to 6.5%). Ethanol intake decreased in group C when alcohol concentrations exceeded 10%. The \"first-day\" CDP effect also occurred in the no-choice situation of an ethanolic liquid diet. Possible factors for this effect are discussed. Thus the effects of CDP on alcohol consumption in non-deprived mice vary with experimental designs.", 
    "60": "While the effects of benzodiazepines on punished responding (response-dependent shock) are straightforward and unambiguous, their effects on behavior suppressed by response-independent shock are conflicting and inconsistent. Some investigators reported that benzodiazepines either have no effect on, or suppress further, responding during response-independent shock, while others reported that benzodiazepines enhance response rates during independent shock delivery in the same manner as during dependent shock. The present study compared the effects of diazepam on rates of lever pressing maintained by a variable-interval 35-sec schedule of food delivery in rats exposed alternately to fixed-interval 180 sec (response-dependent) and fixed-time 180 sec (response-independent) schedules of shock delivery. Diazepam increased punished responding in a dose-dependent manner for each animal. \"Rate-dependency,\" degree of suppression and presence of external stimuli influenced rate-enhancement by the drug. Effects of diazepam on responding suppressed by response-independent shock were inconsistent, with two animals revealing rate enhancement comparable to punished responding, and two others revealing further increases in response suppression. Reasons for the differential effects of diazepam on response-rates suppressed by the two forms of shock delivery remain obscure, although the basic phenomenon seems to be real and not merely an artifact of \"rate-dependency.\"", 
    "61": "Applying the basic principles, therapy guides to our hypothetical cases can be constructed. The 60 year old man with postoperative abdominal perineal resection with hypertension and parkinsonism may well need a transurethral resection of the prostate; however, other options include decreasing his anticholinergic-type medications, such as antiparkinsonism medications, changing his hypertensive therapy from beta blockers such as propranolol and metoprolol to alpha blockers such as methyldopa and prazosin. Bethanacol would seldom be helpful alone, but with an alpha blocker could help if not contraindicated by the presence of vascular disease. The second example, a 45 year old woman with stress incontinence, may be assisted with improved storage by an anticholinergic agent, an alpha enhancer, a mucosal enhancer, and if pertinent, switching hypertensive therapy from an alpha blocker to a beta blocker. The last example, a T10 paraplegic with a spastic, hyperreflexic bladder, can have improved storage with anticholinergics, decreased sphincter tone with alpha blockers, as well as decreased sphincter tone with alpha blockers, as well as decreased spasms through suppression of hyperactive spinal cord activity with baclofen.",

    "63": "We have set up guidelines for the practice of electroconvulsive therapy, based on Scandinavian clinical experience and research. Because the therapeutic effect is a result of the cerebral seizure, and the organic side effects partly consequences of the electrical stimulation, the aim should be to induce maximal seizure activity using minimal electrical energy. Essential features of optimal therapy are (1) absence of therapy with benzodiazepines and other anticonvulsant drugs, (2) superficial narcosis, (3) abundant oxygen supply, (4) threshold stimulation with brief-pulse stimuli, and (5) unilateral, parietotemporal, nondominant application of the electrodes. Seizure duration should always be measured to make sure that maximum seizure activity has taken place.", 
    "64": "It has been shown in experiments on rabbits with electrodes implanted into the brain that at the initial period of experimental neurosis formation chlorpromazine and diazepam produce a depressant action on the reduction of intracentral relations between the structures under study. Chlorpromazine favours the formation of additional positive relations whereas diazepam activates the formations of negative relations. At the final stages of experimental neurosis the drug effects become less appreciable.",

After 3 weeks of treatment with clobazam 20 mg a day, the patient developed, in association with his seizures, a neologistic jargon dysphasia but with loss of inflection, volume, and rhythm of speech, presumably as a result of the effect of the clobazam.", 
    "66": "It is known that the psychotropics reduce the cough reflex. To clarify the relation between the higher centers and cough reflex, we investigated the psychotropics property of the respiratory periodic fluctuation in EEG during cough reflex and after administration of psychotropics. Male mongrel dogs immobilized were maintained with artificial respiration. The efferent activities of phrenic nerve and scalp EEG were recorded, and on the basis of the resulting observations, crosscorrelation coefficients were computed using a digital computer. The cough reflex was accompanied by an increase in crosscorrelation coefficient (C. C.) between EEG and phrenic nerve activities. the C. C. between EEG and phrenic nerve activities decreased after iv administration of chlorpromazine ( mg/kg), while administration of imipramine (1-3 mg/kg) and diazepam (1-3 mg/kg) increased the C. C., respectively. The increase in the C. C. observed during cough reflex was inhibited by iv administration of these three drugs. The fact that the C. C. increased during cough reflex suggested that the ascending output from respiratory center to the higher center reinforced during this period. Furthermore, it is suggested that the psychotropics inhibited the neuronal mechanisms of the brain stem that plays an important role in cough reflex by acting upon the feedback loop located between the respiratory center and the higher centers.", 
    "67": "The dose of diazepam that reduces the mortality rate of acute intoxications with chloroquine was determined: The oral LD 50 of chloroquine (330 mg/kg) was administered and immediately thereafter diazepam was injected intraperitoneally to male and female rats at dose levels of 2.5, 7.5, 20, 55, and 148 mg/kg. An untreated group served as control. A significant decrease of the mortality rate was observed at the dose levels 7.5, 20, and 55 mg/kg with optimal effect at 20 mg/kg. This mortality rate was analysed by analysis of variance. The occurrence of two types of symptoms: convulsions and respiratory disturbances was analysed by the chi square method.", 
    "68": "The influence of seduxen (diazepam) on cortical potentials P300 evoked by neutral and emotional words was studied in adult subjects having life conflicts. The therapeutic dose of seduxen (10 mg) had no significant effect on the amplitude of the late positive cortical response P300 to neutral words. Seduxen depresses the emotional activation of the cerebral cortex; that is manifested in selective elimination of those changes in latency and amplitude of P300 wave which are observed in response to emotionally significant words. Under the action of seduxen, the interhemispheric difference in the latency of cortical response disappears due to latency increase in the right hemisphere.", 
    "69": "The clinical significance of the high-affinity binding of psychotropic compounds to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1-AGP) in human serum has not been established yet. However, this binding may be of considerable theoretical interest since glycoproteins play a prominent role in the structure of cell membranes. In order to elucidate the nature of the binding to alpha 1-AGP several typical psychotropic compounds (diazepam, haloperidol, imipramine, perazine, phenobarbital and phenytoin) were investigated by means of equilibrium dialysis. The results suggest that among the classical CNS-drugs only those with a tricyclic structure are bound to two binding sites. Possible reason for the widely differing binding of a series of drugs are discussed in terms of their different chemical structure.", 
    "70": "We have prepared four different 1,4-benzodiazepines, labeled at C-7 with the 1.6-hr positron emitter Br-75 or the 57-hr gamma emitter Br-77, as potential radio-pharmaceuticals for the mapping of cerebral benzodiazepine receptor areas. The triazene method was used and optimized. Yields at the no-carrier-added level were 20%. 7-[75Br]-5-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2-one (Br-75 BFB) was isolated with a minimum specific activity of 20,000 Ci/mmole. Biodistribution in mice shows that BFB is taken up rapidly by the brain and is retained there at useful concentrations for significant periods of time. The maximum uptake is observed at 0.25 min. Brain-to-blood concentration ratios are larger than 2 during the interval (0.25 to 10 min) investigated.",

Therefore, the ability of psychotropic drugs to catalyze the reduction of vanadate ion by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) was investigated. The most active drug was methylene blue but all the phenothiazines and all the monoamine oxidase inhibitors tested showed catalytic activity. A large number of drugs showed no catalytic activity, eg. tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines.", 
    "72": "A 17-year-old epileptic was admitted to the hospital in a confused state. Electroencephalography (EEG) with polygraphic recording revealed tonic status epilepticus. Therapy with phenytoin, phenobarbital, valproic acid, and methylphenidate was unsuccessful. Intravenous diazepam exacerbated the seizures. EEG with polygraphic recording may detect clinically inapparent tonic seizures in epileptics with unexplained confusion, and when generalized paroxysmal fast activity occurs during EEG recording.", 
    "73": "In each of four studies of the human pharmacology of bupropion, 12 healthy volunteers received 6 different treatments, including placebo, at weekly intervals under double-blind conditions. In one study, auditory vigilance and tapping rates improved after d-amphetamine, 5 and 10 mg; were impaired by amitriptyline, 25 mg; but were unaffected by bupropion, 50 and 100 mg. Subjects were drowsy after amitriptyline and more alert and sociable after d-amphetamine; no such changes occurred with bupropion. No changes in pupil size, heart rate, and systolic blood pressure were seen with bupropion. In a second study bupropion, 200 mg, and nomifensine, 100 mg, produced no significant behavioral or autonomic effects. EEG changes occurred after amitriptyline and d-amphetamine but not bupropion. Thus, bupropion at these doses lacked stimulant, anticholinergic, and cardiovascular effects. Bupropion's interactions with diazepam and with alcohol were examined in separate studies. Diazepam, 5 and 2.5 mg, produced drowsiness and impaired auditory vigilance. Bupropion, 100 mg, produced no effect alone but, combined with diazepam, abolished the vigilance impairment and drowsiness seen with diazepam, 2.5 and 5 mg, alone. A similar but less clear-cut pattern was seen with alcohol. Bupropion, 100 mg, had no effect alone but abolished the sedation and auditory vigilance impairment produced by alcohol when co-administered. Interactions between bupropion and the depressant drugs are unlikely to produce clinical problems.", 
    "74": "The effects of flurazepam on the nocturnal sleep patterns of 20 pre- and postoperative herniorrhaphy patients were studied polygraphically, in double-blind fashion, in the clinical setting. Compared to patients who received no hypnotic, patients treated with flurazepam had, preoperatively, significantly more Stage 2 and less REM and, postoperatively, significantly greater total sleep time, fewer awakenings, and less total awake time. The flurazepam group also initially had more delta sleep, but then showed a steady decrease of delta sleep over the hospitalization.", 
    "75": "Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, a benzodiazepine tranquilizer was tested for its mutagenic ability by host-mediated assay using Salmonella typhimurium G46 strain as indicator organism and mice as host. Three concentrations of the drug were used: 187.5, 375, and 562 mg/kg body weight corresponding to three sublethal doses 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 of LD50. The results show that chlordiazepoxide induced point mutations in Salmonella typhimurium G46 at all three doses. The mutations were increased 2- to 4-fold in the experimental groups compared to the control. The statistical analysis of the data clearly showed significant values at all dose levels; further, the drug also showed a dose-related increase in the mutation rate.", 
    "76": "Male and female mice, IOPS OF1 strain, received an i.p. injection of diazepam 1,2,4 or 8 mg/kg daily for 3 days prior to i.p. challenge with Klebsiella pneumoniae. Diazepam pretreatment increased mortality due to Klebsiella pneumoniae indicating that diazepam alters natural resistance to infection. The mechanism has not been elucidated but would appear to involve T cells and/or macrophages."
