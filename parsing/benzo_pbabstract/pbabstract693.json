    "0": "Tubal anesthesia with lidocaine during laparoscopic tubal clip appli cation was evaluated in 149 women; 147 tubes received no lidocaine and 151 received 1 or 2 ml of 1% or 4% lidocaine. For unanesthetized tubes the mean pain rating depended on the dose of diazepam and fentanyl given to the patient (p less than .1); pain ratings were higher in women who received no drug. When any diazepam and/or fentanyl was given, the anesthetized tubes were given a significantly lower pain rating (p less than .01). 23.8% of unanesthetized tubes received a pain rating of 2, 12.9% a rating of 3 or 4, while no anesthetized tube received a 3 or 4 (on a scale of 0 to 4) and only 4% received a 2. 68.5% patients were their own control; 42% rated the pain equal in each tube (1 was anesthetized), while 58% rated the anesthetized tube less painful. 3.4% of the patients experienced vasovagal reflex stimulation. It is concluded that using a local anesthetic solution substantially reduces discomfort associated with fallopian tube manipulation during sterilization.", 
    "1": "Administration of three different barbiturates reduced rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Drug withdrawal led to a return to baseline REM] values without significant overshoot. Similar results are observed with administration of benzodiazepines in pharmacologically equivalent dosages; therefore, a distinction between these two drug classes on the basis of withdrawal effects on the sleep electroencephalogram appears unwarranted. Further investigation is required determine why high REM levels are sometimes associated with the withdrawal of sedative-hypnotic agents.", 
    "2": "Myoclonus of the tongue is described for the first time as an isolated phenomenon and is related to the palatal-branchial myoclonus syndrome. Literature on the subject is reviewed. In the case which is presented the lingual myoclonus is seen to disappear, which is not the characteristic behavior of the palatal myoclonus syndrome. Since myoclonus of the tongue or palate is felt to represent a release of the primitive mechanism for integration of oral-pharyngeal movement from suprasegmental modulation, a sequence of events is proposed to explain the clinical findings on the basis of a discreet brain stem contusion at the upper medullary level.", 
    "3": "The electroencephalogram in three patients with Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease showed two separate abnormalities-namely, progressive background suppression and periodic generalized synchronous triphasic sharp wave complexes which evolve to a uniform morphology and periodicity. The abnormalities, when found in the EEG of a patient in middle-age with a dementing illness, should not be confused with other periodic electroencephalographic phenomena. Since the neuropathological abnormalities of Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease are non-specific, the electroencephalogram is essential for the recognition of this disorder, although serial recordings may be necessary to establish the diagnosis. Modification of the electroencephalographic abnormalities occurs with afferent stimuli and with methylphenidate or diazepam, suggesting that the phenomenon of background suppression is independent of the presence of the periodic complexes. Modification of clinical activity with methylphenidate suggests that some degree of reversibility of function exists in this inexorably fatal disorder. Further detailed studies of the electroencephalogram in cases of Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease are indicated.", 
    "4": "1 Benzoctamine, a new psychoactive drug, known to exert in man an anti-anxiety effect resembling that of chlordiazepoxide, decreased the disappearance of intraventricularly-injected [(14)C]-5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) from rat brain, as did chlordiazepoxide.2 Both drugs partially inhibited the alpha-ethyl-3-hydroxy-4-methylphenylethylamine-induced depletion of rat brain 5-HT.3 It is concluded that benzoctamine, like chlordiazepoxide, decreases 5-HT turnover in the brain and that this action may play a role in the anti-anxiety effect of these drugs observed in man."
