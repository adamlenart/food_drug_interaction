    "0": "The clinical pharmacodynamics of temazepam were investigated in patients who received spinal anaesthesia. Total plasma and cerebrospinal fluid temazepam concentrations were measured and correlated with the clinical effects. Sedation was measured by three separate methods. None, including an aggregated score of all three measures, was correlated closely with either the plasma or the cerebrospinal fluid levels (p = 0.86 and 0.12 respectively). Anxiety was measured before and after premedication. The two scores were correlated but the change in anxiety after premedication did not correlate with either the plasma or the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations (p = 0.11 and 0.45 respectively). Short-term memory was measured before and after premedication. The decline in short-term memory ability was moderately well correlated with both the plasma and the cerebrospinal fluid levels (p = 0.0005 and 0.013 respectively). With temazepam, the variation in sedative and anxiolytic effects between subjects is explained not by differences in pharmacokinetics but rather by differences in the pharmacodynamic response. Because sedative and anxiolytic effects are poorly correlated, but the amnesic effect is well correlated with temazepam concentrations, different sites of action for these effects are suggested.", 
    "1": "In a population of 425 individuals with Down syndrome, we observed 5 persons (1.2%) with Tourette's disorder. Because the prevalence of Tourette's disorder in the general population has been estimated to be between 0.03% and 1.6%, it is not likely that there is an increased prevalence of Tourette's disorder in Down syndrome, or that there is an interrelationship between Down syndrome and Tourette's disorder. This lack of relationship argues against an atypical Tourette's disorder. The absence of family histories of Tourette's disorder in our patients, the relatively late onset of the disorder in most of our patients, their previous treatment with neuroleptic and psychostimulant medication, and the lack of relationship between Down syndrome and Tourette's disorder in this Down syndrome population are factors that support the diagnosis of tardive Tourette's disorder.", 
    "2": "Procedures are reported that maintain control by the drug cue during and after drug discrimination training with lower doses that yield predominantly vehicle-appropriate choices. Twelve pigeons were trained to discriminate chlordiazepoxide (CDP) from saline using two-key (drug vs. vehicle) drug discrimination procedures. Intermixed within each block of 30 sessions were nine sessions of training with 8.0 mg/kg CDP, nine with one of seven lower training doses (4.0, 2.8, 2.0, 1.4, 1.0, 0.7, or 0.5 mg/kg CDP), and 12 with saline. The lower training dose was decreased across blocks. The three lowest training doses (1.0, 0.7, and 0.5 mg/kg CDP) yielded predominantly saline-appropriate choices but had no effect on discrimination of 8.0 mg/kg CDP or saline. Three doses (2.0, 1.4, and 1.0 mg/kg CDP) were retrained, and each yielded percentages of drug-appropriate choices nearly identical to those obtained during previous training. This drug discrimination procedure maintains control by the drug cue during and after training with vehicle-like doses of the training drug and may allow for repeated assessment of effects of low training doses.", 
    "3": "The dosage of sedatives required for sedation was studied in patients who underwent total abdominal histerectomy under epidural anesthesia using patient-controlled sedation (PCS) and in those with anesthesiologist-controlled sedation (ACS). Patients in experimental groups received 1.0 or 1.5 mg bolus dose of midazolam by their request until desirable sedation was obtained using a computer-controlled device. In control group, anesthesiologists gave 1.5 mg bolus dose of midazolam and repeated until enough sedation was obtained. The total amount of midazolam was 12.15 +/- 3.90 mg (mean +/- SD) in ACS group and showed significant differences from experimental groups (PCS-1.0 group: 7.43 +/- 1.81 mg, PCS-1.5 group: 6.30 +/- 2.81 mg). The level of sedation showed wider variation in PCS groups than in ACS groups. The results suggest that PCS is a technique which allows reduction of sedatives in patients who undergo operation under local anesthesia.", 
    "4": "Using a brain-dedicated triple-headed single-photon emission tomography (SPET) system, a sequential whole-volume imaging protocol has been devised to evaluate the regional distribution of iodine-123 iomazenil binding to GABAA receptors in the entire brain. The protocol was piloted in eight normal volunteers (seven males and one female; mean age, 24.8 +/- 3.9 years). The patterns obtained were largely compatible with the known distribution of GABAA receptors in the brain as reported in autoradiographic studies, with cerebral cortical regions, particularly the occipital and frontal cortices, displaying the highest 123I-iomazenil uptake. Measures of time to peak uptake and tracer washout rates presented with the same pattern of regional variation, with later times to peak and slower washout rates in cortical regions compared to other brain areas. Semiquantitative analysis of the data using white matter/ventricle regions as reference demonstrated a plateau of specific 123I-iomazenil binding in neocortical and cerebellar regions from 60-75 min onwards. These data demonstrate the feasibility of sequential, dynamic whole-volume 123I-iomazenil SPET imaging. The protocol may be particularly useful in the investigation of neuropsychiatric conditions which are likely to involve more than one focus of GABA abnormalities, such as anxiety disorders and schizophrenia.", 
    "5": "Intraspinal delivery of opioids is a proven method of pain management therapy for severe cancer pain. Effective analgesia can be achieved with spinal opioid infusions while minimizing central side effects such as sedation, nausea, and severe constipation. Indications for intraspinal opioids include unmanageable side effects with increasing doses of oral or parenteral opioids or little or no pain relief with increasing dosages of strong opioids. The purpose of this case study is to illustrate the multidisciplinary approach required and multiple analgesics needed to effectively assess and manage a challenging pain management situation. This patient required the administration of intraspinal morphine, intravenous hydromorphone, and intravenous midazolam in order to effectively manage his pain. The use of spinal analgesia and multiple analgesics offers challenges to oncology and hospice nurses but is an effective modality for otherwise intractable cancer pain.", 
    "6": "I.p. applicated S(+)-1, R(-)-1 und rac. 1 prolonged hexobarbital sleeping in rats. The rac. 8-chloro compound 3 given i.p. produced no prolongation. Determination of rac. 1 in serum and tissues of rats 30 min after i.p. administration of 50 mg/kg showed that rac. 1 was detectable in serum and brain, yet its concentration was below the limit of determination. I.v. applicated, the enantiomers of 1 and 3 showed diametrically opposite CNS-effects: The S(+)-enantiomers were convulsively active as pentetrazol, whereas the R(-)-enantiomers were CNS depressant active prolonging hexobarbital sleeping time dose-dependently. High doses of diazepam antagonized dose-dependently the convulsive action of S(+)-1 supporting the hypothesis that this enantiomer acted as a strong inverse agonist, whereas R(-)-1 produced weak agonistic activity at the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABA-receptor.--Enantioselective differences for the binding of the 1-enantiomers to human serum albumin were found, too. R(-)-1 was bound to a greater extent than S(+)-1.", 
    "7": "See-saw nystagmus is a pendular nystagmus with two distinct components: a conjugate torsional component and a disjonctive vertical component. The acquired form of nystagmus is usually seen with parasellar mass and less frequently in head injury or brainstem infarction. Almost all patients with parasellar mass or head injury have associated bitemporal hemianopia. We report the case of a 27-year-old man who developed intermittent daily oscillopsia five years after a severe head injury. On neurological examination, the patient showed a congenital left eye divergence with left eye convergence paresis, an anosmia, a right optic atrophy and a bitemporal hemianopia. Visual acuity was 7/10 and 3/10 for the right and left eyes. The rest of the neurological examination was unremarkable. Electroencephalogram during oscillopsia was normal. MRI revealed bilateral orbito-frontal low signal intensity on T1 weighted images. The brainstem, the diencephalon and the ventricular system appeared to be intact. Eye movement recordings exhibited intermittent see-saw nystagmus. Clonazepam treatment resolved the see-saw nystagmus. Slowly withdrawal of clonazepam was done without return of the see-saw nystagmus.", 
    "8": "According to the literature, electroconvulsive therapy and benzodiazepines, especially lorazepam, are recommended for the treatment of catatonia. We report the case of a 56-year-old woman with catatonia resistant to electroconvulsive therapy and benzodiazepines. Treatment with zolpidem led to durable improvement. This case suggests that zolpidem should be tested in catatonia since side effects are minimal.", 
    "9": "Multiple classes of pharmacological agents including benzodiazepines, cage convulsants like t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS), barbiturates and neuroactive steroids allosterically modulate the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor-chloride ionophore complex (GRC). The function of benzodiazepines requires a GRC comprised of alpha, beta and gamma subunits, while TBPS, barbiturates and neuroactive steroids will allosterically modulate GRCs comprised of only alpha and beta subunits. Binary alpha beta complexes are still hypothesized to be expressed in the mammalian brain particularly during development and could contribute to the pharmacological action of neuroactive steroids and barbiturates. In order to examine binary alpha beta complexes we report here the establishment of stable cell lines that express high levels of human GABAA receptors comprised of alpha 1 beta 1, alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 3 beta 1 subunit combinations. The apparent potencies for allosteric modulation of [35S]TBPS for most naturally occurring neuroactive steroids for the binary subunit combinations was similar to that of the gamma-containing subunit combinations. Also discussed is the usefulness of these cell lines for the biophysical analysis of the GABAA receptor stoichiometry.", 
    "10": "In a retrospective study 100 patients with DSM-III-R/ICD-10 panic disorder and agoraphobia (PDA) were interviewed about the psychopharmacological, psychological and 'alternative' treatments they had received in the course of their illness. Patients gave global statements about how satisfied they were with the various treatments they had experienced. Many patients received treatments that have never been investigated under controlled conditions. The most common drug treatments, in descending order, were: 48% benzodiazepines, 42% tricyclic antidepressants, 32% herbal preparations, 29% neuroleptics, 7% selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and 6% beta blockers. Of the drug prescriptions, 63% were according to international standards. Of the neuroleptics, two-thirds (63.3%) were prescribed by nonpsychiatric physicians, and only one-third by psychiatrists (33.3%). Tricyclic antidepressants were prescribed more often by psychiatrists (64.7%) than by non-psychiatrists (31.4%). Among psychological treatments, autogenic training (43% of the patients) and psychodynamic therapy (33%) were used far more frequently than behavioural/cognitive therapy (20%). These results confirm the underutilisation of available effective treatments for panic disorder (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants or behavioural therapy) and the overutilisation of treatments without proven efficacy (e.g. herbal preparations or autogenic training). Patients were most satisfied with treatments that have been proven effective in controlled studies. Among drug treatments, benzodiazepines, selective serotonin inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants were favoured (mean on a 0-4 scale indicating effectiveness: 2.6, 2.6 and 2.4). Neuroleptics (1.4), beta-blockers (1.0) and herbal preparations (0.9) were not rated highly effective by the patients. Among psychological treatments, patients were more satisfied with behavioural/cognitive therapy (2.6) than with psychodynamic therapies (1.5).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "A unified pharmacophore model of the benzodiazepine receptor (BzR) has been developed using the techniques of chemical synthesis, radioligand binding, and receptor mapping. This model is based on 136 different ligands spanning ten structurally diverse classes of compounds and qualitatively accounts for the relative affinities, efficacies, and functional effects (agonism vs. antagonism vs. inverse agonism) displayed by various ligands at the BzR. In addition, the model is expanded to account for the pharmacology of a recently discovered BzR receptor subtype termed the 'Diazepam-Insensitive' (DI) BzR. Moreover, the unified model described here is compared and contrasted with other published pharmacophore models. As previously reported, the synthesis of both partial agonists and partial inverse agonists has been achieved by using parts of this model. Partial agonists are of interest as potentially improved agents for treatment of anxiety disorders, while the partial inverse agonists may furnish important clues for the treatment of age-associated memory impairment.", 
    "12": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the value of local anaesthesia versus the commonly used intravenous pethidine/diazepam in the reduction of acute secondary shoulder dislocations. Patients with a traumatic secondary dislocation of the shoulder were randomized to either locally injected lidocaine or intravenously injected pethidine/diazepam. The local method was performed with 20 ml of 1% lidocaine. The patients were observed for any complication during and after the procedure, and the methods used were evaluated with a visual analogue scale (VAS). From November 1991 to September 1993, 62 patients were admitted to our departments of whom 52 were included in the study. Average age was 47 years (range 18-89 years) with 24 men and 28 women. Twenty-six patients were randomized to pethidine/diazepam; 22 had a successful reduction, and 4 were failures. Twenty-six patients received lidocaine, of whom 18 were successful and 8 not. Three patients treated with the intravenous method suffered respiratory depression, and one required an antidote. No systemic or local side-effects, no neurovascular damage and no early or late superficial or deep infection were recorded in the lidocaine group. There was no statistical difference between the average VAS value in the two groups. Lidocaine used to reduce acute secondary dislocations of the shoulder is a simple and safe method. It is as effective as the standard intravenous method and is well accepted by patients.", 
    "13": "The metabolism of omeprazole to its two major metabolites, hydroxyomeprazole (OH-OPZ) and omeprazole sulfone (OPZ-SFN) was studied in rat liver microsomes by a reversed phase HPLC assay. The formation of metabolites of OPZ depended on incubation time, substrate concentration, microsomal protein concentration, and was found to be optimal at pH 7.4. The Vmax and Km of OPZ hydroxylation in the rat liver microsomal preparation were 2033 nmol/(min.mg protein) and 46.8 mumol.L-1 respectively. The maximum rate of formation of OPZ-SFN (Vmax) was 187.9 nmol/(min.mg protein), with a Km value of 120.7 mumol.L-1 in rat liver microsome. Moreover, the effects of 7 drugs on OPZ metabolism were tested. The results showed that mephenytoin, benzodiazepines (DZ, NDZ, TMZ, FNZ, NZ) and papaverine caused inhibition of OPZ metabolism, among them papaverine was the only fairly strong inhibitor.", 
    "14": "The influence of the benzodiazepine hypnotic lormetazepam (1 mg) and the cyclopyrrolone hypnotic zopiclone (7.5 mg) on heart rate activity was studied in 16 elderly insomniacs in a placebo-controlled, randomised, 3-fold crossover trial. After digital preprocessing of the ECG, QRS complexes were automatically recognised by a detection technique based on adaptative thresholds. Both R-R periodicity and heart rate variability were analysed as a function of sleep stages and time of night. Under placebo, heart rate decreased significantly from the first to the second half of the night. The relationship between sleep stages and heart rate remained constant under both hypnotics. Although the two substances significantly modified the distribution of sleep stages, no relevant changes in ECG activity were observed when the proportion of the different sleep stages was taken into consideration.", 
    "15": "Rats were submitted to 110 dB white noise exposure for 1, and 6 hours and brain alpha 1, beta 1 and benzodiazepine receptor binding was evaluated with selective ligands. An increase in cerebral benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) concentration, without any significant change in affinity constant, occurred after the 6 h treatment; no change was observed in adrenergic receptor binding at any period of exposure. Both diazepam and clonazepam pre-treatment reversed the effects of noise on CBR binding, confirming a role of these receptors in the response to noise stress. Furthermore, these benzodiazepine agonists influenced the response of cardiac and aortic tissues, which are known to be changed by stress exposure. Diazepam and clonazepam pre-treatment protected cardiac tissue from the effects of 6h noise stress, and a potentiation of aortic responses was detected, although at different times of exposure. The differences between the responses of these peripheral tissues to benzodiazepine treatment suggest that the expression depends on the tissue examined and the period of exposure.", 
    "16": "Depressive and anxiety disorders have a high lifetime prevalence--8% and 15%, respectively. Unipolar depression has a 5% lifetime prevalence, whereas the prevalence rate for all depressive disorders is between 6% to 8% at a minimum. Each disorder has also been found to have a high rate of chronicity and recurrence. It has become increasingly apparent over the past decade that within episodes of depression, anxiety symptoms often exist. Whether this phenomenon indicates two separate but comorbid illnesses or that the presence of anxiety symptoms is part of the course of depression is of particular significance for diagnosis and treatment. The author focuses on the issues of differential diagnosis, including physical and emotional manifestations of the illness. The consequences of comorbid anxiety and depression can be serious, ranging from social and physical disability to suicidal ideation and behavior. Anxiety has been found to be a predictor of suicide in depressed patients, and since anxiety symptoms respond to intervention, they can also serve as an indication of type of treatment. Antidepressants should be used in treating anxiety or panic symptoms when depression is also present. In studies comparing benzodiazepines, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in the treatment of concurrent anxiety and depression, all have some measure of success depending on the degree of depression and the type of anxiety disorder. SSRIs may have the least amount of side effects, but more long-term studies are needed to determine the long-term efficacy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The screening drugs identification was performed using immunoassays Triage and Vitalab Eclair manufactured by MERCK. Benzodiazepines followed by barbiturates and opiods were most often the cause of acute poisonings among the adult Krak\u00f3w inhabitants.

    "18": "We investigated whether triazolam attenuated the suppression of motility in the conditioned fear stress task in mice and whether ethanol modified the effects of triazolam. When mice were placed 24 hours later (retention test) in the same environment in which they had previously been exposed to an electric foot shock (training), they exhibited a marked suppression of motility (conditioned fear stress). Triazolam (0.01-0.1 mg/kg, s.c.), administered before training, attenuated the suppression of motility in the conditioned fear stress task in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting the sensitivity to an electric foot shock. The doses of triazolam that attenuated the suppression of motility were much lower that those of chlordiazepoxide (5-10 mg/kg, s.c.). Neither drug, administered before the retention test, attenuated the suppression of motility in the conditioned fear stress task. These results suggest that both benzodiazepines may inhibit the process of acquisition, but not the process of recall, of memory. Ethanol (1 g/kg, p.o.), which, by itself, did not affect either the suppression of motility or the sensitivity to an electric foot shock, exacerbated the attenuation of the suppression of motility in the conditioned fear stress task induced by both triazolam (0.01 mg/kg) and chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg). These results suggest that ethanol exacerbates the effects of benzodiazepines.", 
    "19": "Patients in the ICU who require intubation and mechanical ventilation benefit from adequate sedation and analgesia. Traditionally, this has been achieved using benzodiazepines and opioids. Alternatively, propofol is being administered for sedation of patients in the ICU with increasing frequency. Propofol has a number of properties that make it a potentially superior choice for sedation of intubated ICU patients. The rapid onset and offset of sedation with propofol, even after prolonged administration, allow for greater control over the level of sedation and more rapid weaning from mechanical ventilation. In addition, long-term administration of propofol does not appear to be associated with the development of tolerance, addiction, or withdrawal following discontinuation. Propofol suppresses cellular oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production without increasing anaerobic metabolism. This may be beneficial in patients with severe hypoxemia, hypercarbia, or myocardial ischemia. Finally, the use of propofol may reduce or eliminate the need for other medications in these patients such as muscle relaxants, antihypertensives, lipid nutritional supplements, and analgesics, thereby simplifying their medication regimens and reducing the overall cost of their care while in the ICU. Propofol can be administered to critically ill patients for sedation with a high degree of safety and efficacy. Propofol causes systemic vasodilatation which may result in unwanted hypotension, especially in patients who are already hemodynamically compromised. Propofol also causes ventilatory depression, so its use should be restricted in the ICU to patients whose airway is protected by an endotracheal tube and whose ventilation is closely monitored. Finally, continuous administration of propofol may cause clinically significant hypertriglyceridemia in patients with disordered triglyceride metabolism, or in patients receiving excessive doses of propofol or parenteral lipid supplements. Although propofol is more expensive than equipotent doses of other sedative agents, the additional cost of using propofol for sedation of critically ill patients in the ICU may be more than offset by the savings accrued from faster times to extubation, shorter ICU stays, and the use of fewer medications to manage these patients. Further research needs to be done to determine the potential clinical and cost benefits of using propofol for sedation of patients in the ICU.", 
    "20": "This review categorizes five main uses of pharmacologic agents in the treatment of alcoholism: reversing the active pharmacologic effects of alcohol; controlling withdrawal symptoms; blocking the desire for alcohol use; treating psychiatric symptoms induced by alcohol and other drugs; and treating independent, but concurrent, psychopathologic conditions. No medication, including stimulants such as caffeine, has been found to actually reverse the action of alcohol. Because of their cross-tolerance and dependence with alcohol, benzodiazepines--especially intermediate acting preparations such as chlordiazepoxide and diazepam--are the mainstay in treating alcohol withdrawal, including convulsions and delirium tremens. Studies suggest that serotonin uptake inhibitors such as zimelidine, citalopram, viqualine, and fluoxetine may reduce alcohol consumption and that is not an antidepressant effect. Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, also may be effective in reducing the urge to drink. The major aversive agent to alcohol in clinical use is disulfiram. When an independent psychiatric disorder accompanies alcoholism or drug addiction, it may require treatment, including pharmacotherapy, as the addiction is also being treated with nonpharmacologic methods such as abstinence-based treatment programs.", 
    "21": "From 1975 to 1993, our University Hospital performed 2789 graft procedures. During the same period, 12 poisoned, \"brain-dead\" patients were considered as organ donors. The toxic substances involved were: methaqualone (n = 1), benzodiazepine alone (n = 1), benzodiazepine plus tricyclic antidepressants (n =1), tricyclic antidepressants alone (n = 1), barbiturates (n = 2), insulin (n = 2), carbon monoxide (n = 1), cyanide (n = 1), methanol (n = 1), and acetaminophen (n = 1). From these intoxicated persons, 32 organ transplants were obtained, but only 23 could be followed for 1 month and only 20 for 1 year. The outcome at 1 month was favorable in 20 of the 23 patients. Two heart transplant patients died with 24h after grafting from stroke and acute heart failure, respectively. Preoperative hepatic encephalopathy was not corrected after grafting and was directly responsible for the death of a liver transplant patient. After 1 year, 15 of the 20 recipients were still alive. Chronic hepatic graft rejection led to a fatal outcome in one recipient and to second grafting in another. Finally, one recipient died from delayed neoplasia. Based on our experience, organ procurement may be considered in a few select cases of acute poisoning. Attention should, however, be drawn to possible graft damage due to some poisons.", 
    "22": "The effects of handling and handling combined with phencyclidine (PCP) treatment on GABAergic neurotransmission were studied in Sprague-Dawley rats. The animal material consisted of handling-habituated (HH, for 11 d), acutely handled (naive, N), handling-habituated and PCP-treated (10 mg kg-1 i.p., HH + PCP) and acutely handled (naive) PCP-treated (N + PCP) and unhandled 'control' rats. The binding of [3H]GABA and [3H]flunitrazepam (FLU) was studied with membranes and the release of [3H]GABA with slices prepared from the striatum and frontal cortex. In the striatum the maximal binding capacity (Bmax) and the binding constant (KD) of [3H]GABA were the same in N and HH rats, but in the frontal cortex KD was lower in N rats. KD constants of [3H]FLU were significantly lower in both brain areas in N rats than in HH rats. After PCP treatment both Bmax and KD for [3H]FLU increased in these two brain areas in handling-habituated rats, whereas Bmax of [3H]GABA diminished. Neither handling nor PCP had any effect on [3H]GABA release from striatal and frontal cortical slices. Handling prior to killing thus affects differently the GABAergic parameters studied and modulates the PCP-induced effects.", 
    "23": "Behavioral differences in anxiety have been observed between both males and females and across the ovarian cycle in females. However, the data are not entirely consistent and the mechanisms of this potential interaction are largely unexplored. It appears that the GABA/BZ receptor complex is a site of action for steroids as well as for many anxiolytic drugs. Both natural steroids, such as progesterone and its metabolites, and synthetic steroids, such as alphaxalone, reduce anxiety-like behavior in rats. Alphaxolone also reverses the behavioral effects of potent anxiogenic agents in the conflict test of anxiety. Studies reported here found that ethanol administered to rats in different phases of the estrous cycle was more effective as an anxiolytic when hormone levels were high. The anticonflict response to chlordiazepoxide also was examined in ovariectomized and steroid-replaced female rats. Insight into the mechanisms and sites of action for these steroids can be gained from such an approach.", 
    "24": "Changes in benzodiazepine binding sites labeled by [3H]flunitrazepan (FNZ) in twenty discrete brain regions of rats made tolerant to and dependent upon pentobarbital were examined. Animals were rendered tolerant by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion with pentobarbital (300 micrograms/ 10 microliters/ hr for six days) through pre-implanted cannulae connected to osmotic mini-pumps. The pentobarbital dependence was assessed 24 hr after abrupt withdrawal from pentobarbital. In the tolerant rats, a significant increase in [3H]FNZ binding sites was found in layer IV of frontal cortex and the molecular layer of olfactory bulb. [3H]FNZ binding sites in the pentobarbital dependent rats were significantly increased in layers I-III and V-VI of frontal cortex, caudate-putamen, olfactory tubercle, globus pallidus and ventral pallidum, in addition to those observed in the tolerant group. There was, however, no significant difference in the hippocampus and several regions in the hindbrain in either pentobarbital-treated group. Taken together with characteristics of subtypes of benzodiazepine receptors and changes in GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complexes elucidated in our previous studies, these findings suggest that both types of benzodiazepine receptors are involved in the development of pentobarbital intoxication mediated by GABAA receptors.", 
    "25": "Among the brain imaging techniques developed during the past two decades, positron emission tomography (PET) has the highest sensitivity allowing the analysis of specific neurotransmitter mechanisms in the living human brain. By using a combination of selective ligands labeled with positron emitting isotopes D1- and D2 dopamine, serotonin 5HT2, and benzodiazepine receptors were examined in schizophrenic patients (DSM-III-R) and healthy control subjects. With this technique receptor populations could be excellently visualized and quantified with regard to number and binding characteristics in several brain regions. The characteristics of the total D1 and D2 dopamine receptor populations in the caudate and putamen did not differ in young drug-naive schizophrenic patients and age-matched control subjects. Also for 5HT2 and benzodiazepine receptors no major alteration of receptor characteristics was observed in several neocortical and limbic brain regions. However, in schizophrenic patients treated with chemically different types of antipsychotic drugs major reductions of ligand binding was observed indicating specific induction of neuroreceptor occupancy. Thus, all chemically different types of antipsychotic drugs examined induced a substantial occupancy of D2 dopamine receptors. Clozapine in high doses induced a significantly lower degree of D2 dopamine receptor occupancy than the conventional drugs. Some but not all antipsychotics also induced a significant D1 dopamine receptor occupancy. In spite of the fact that the selective D1 antagonist SCH 39166 induced a substantial D1 occupancy, this drug did not exhibit an antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients. A very high degree of 5HT2 occupancy in neocortical regions was observed after clinical treatment with antipsychotic drugs as clozapine, risperidone and thioridazine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "27": "The densities of M1, M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors in human detrusor muscle were measured using 3H-pirenzepine (3H-PZP), 3H-AFDX-116 (3H-AFDX) and 3H-4-diphenyl-acetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine methidide (3H-4DAMP). The affinities of PZP, AFDX and 4DAMP for human detrusor were determined in inhibition experiments with 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate (3H-QNB). Saturation experiments with 3H-PZP, 3H-AFDX and 3H-4DAMP revealed the presence of M1, M2 and M3 receptors in human detrusor. The KD values (nM) and the Bmax values (fmol/mg protein) (mean +/- SD, n = 6) were 0.84 +/- 0.15 and 13.04 +/- 1.54 for 3H-PZP, 0.68 +/- 0.21 and 9.30 +/- 1.10 for 3H-AFDX, and 0.25 +/- 0.13 and 102.1 +/- 7.40 for 3H-4DAMP. These data indicate that the bladder muscarinic receptors consist mainly of the M3 subtype. Nonlabeled PZP, AFDX and 4DAMP inhibited the 3H-QNB binding to human detrusor with Ki values (nM) (mean +/- SD, n = 6) of 243 +/- 62.5, 59.7 +/- 15.3, 2.69 +/- 0.96, respectively. Human detrusor was found to have a high affinity for 4DAMP. These data suggest that M3 muscarinic receptors are biochemically predominant in human detrusor muscle.", 
    "28": "Brain and cardiac tissue was examined for pathological changes from rats that survived 24 hrs following exposure to a convulsant dose of the nerve agent soman. The animals had been treated following varying durations of seizure activity (2.5 - 40 min) with a number of different compounds that did or did not terminate the seizure. Moderate to severe neuropathology was evident in virtually all animals (98%) in which drug treatment did not terminate seizures. All animals that experienced up to 10 min of seizure activity before drug treatment successfully terminated the seizure were free of neuropathology. There was an increasing frequency in the incidence of neuropathology in animals that experienced 20 (10%) or 40 min (79%) of seizure activity before drug treatment terminated the seizure, but the degree of neuropathology in these groups was significantly less than that observed in animals where seizure activity was not terminated. Cardiac lesions occurred at a much higher frequency (88%) than neuropathological changes (57%) and were not consistently associated with the anticonvulsant effectiveness. Early treatment (< or = 10 min) with anticholinergic drugs, however, was associated with protection from cardiac damage. The results strongly support the hypothesis that nerve agent-induced brain damage is linked to epileptiform activity. The minimal amount of seizure activity necessary for irreversible neural damage to become evident under these conditions is approximately 20 min, and the process accelerates greatly after this minimal time has elapsed. Successful termination of seizure activity, regardless of the type of drug used, protected either totally or relatively against brain damage depending upon how long the seizure had progressed. The mechanisms responsible for cardiac lesion formation occur more rapidly and may have a cholinergic component.", 
    "29": "The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between midazolam and ethanol were studied in the rat in vivo. Ethanol was given as a constant rate intravenous infusion (1.85 mg/min). The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of midazolam were determined following an intravenous dose of 5 mg/kg in 15 minutes. Amplitudes in the 11.5-30 Hz (beta) frequency band of the EEG was used as a measure of the pharmacological effect. Ethanol infusion resulted in a constant plasma alcohol concentration of 0.44 +/- 0.04 g/l (Mean +/- SE) and had no effect on the baseline value of the EEG effect parameter. Also the pharmacokinetics of midazolam were unchanged. However, a significant parallel shift of the midazolam concentration-EEG effect relationship to lower concentrations was observed. These findings show that there is a pharmacodynamic interaction between midazolam and ethanol in vivo.", 
    "30": "Muscle spasm has been proposed as the cause for esophageal food impaction. The aim was therefore to treat esophageal foreign bodies with spasmolytic drugs influencing both striated and smooth muscles of the esophagus. A multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of glucagon and diazepam was undertaken in 43 patients. The foreign body disimpacted in 9 of 24 patients given active substances and in 6 of 19 patients given placebo; there was no significant difference between these two groups. Almost all disimpactions occurred several hours after injection of the drugs. The hypothesis of muscle spasm as an important cause of esophageal obstruction was rejected. Medical therapies for food disimpaction other than spasmolytic drugs have to be investigated.", 
    "31": "Cholinergic agonists and antagonists frequently used for gastrointestinal motility disorders often produce adverse effects. A possible explanation for this is the presence of similar muscarinic receptor subtypes on smooth muscle from different gastrointestinal organs. The aim of this study was to characterize muscarinic receptor subtypes in human gastric smooth muscle with receptor binding methods. N-[3H]Methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS) saturation experiments showed a homogeneous population of noninteracting binding sites (KD = 0.76 +/- 0.07 nM, Bmax = 46.94 +/- 3.69 fmol/mg of tissue protein, nH = 0.99 +/- 0.01). The rank order of inhibition of [3H]NMS binding by nonlabelled compounds was atropine > otenzepad > pirenzepine. Atropine and pirenzepine bound to a homogeneous population of binding sites. The inhibition of [3H]NMS binding by otenzepad showed two populations of receptors (nH < 1, p < 0.01), whose apparent Ki1 of 298 +/- 40 nM and apparent Ki2 of 3.463 +/- 0.62 mM were similar to those reported for the M2 and M3 muscarinic receptor subtypes. The M2 subtype was the more abundant of the two, representing 79.12 +/- 5.48% of the total population. We conclude that two muscarinic receptor subpopulations similar to the M2 and M3 subtypes are present in human gastric smooth muscle and that the M2-like receptor is the more abundant of the two.", 
    "32": "Toxicological analysis for chlorpromazine and diazepam was performed using chemically fixed organ tissue specimens. After chlorpromazine and diazepam had been injected into rabbits, organ tissues (brain, lung, liver, kidney and skeletal muscle) were collected and fixed in 3 fixative solutions: buffered 10% formalin solution (pH 7.4, 10% BF), non-buffered 10% formalin solution (pH 5.1, 10% non-BF), buffered 4% paraformaldehyde solution (pH 7.4, 4% BPA). Chlorpromazine and diazepam were determined by GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) after 5 different fixation periods, and were detected even after 28 days of fixation. Recoveries of chlorpromazine and diazepam in 10% BF were within the range 48-86% and 68-171%, respectively after 28-day fixation, those in 10% non-BF were 22-54% and 48-78%, respectively, and those in 4% BPA solution were 13-59% and 14-50%, respectively. Thus, 10% BF was found to be the most suitable fixation medium for analysis of chlorpromazine and diazepam.", 
    "33": "We studied the pharmacokinetics of a single 0.5-mg i.v. dose of chlordesmethyldiazepam in 8 patients with liver disease and in 12 age-matched healthy controls. The kinetics were also studied of a single 1-mg oral dose in the patients with liver disease. After i.v. administration the kinetics of total chlordesmethyldiazepam in patients with liver disease differed from those in controls: elimination half-life was almost twice that in controls (395 and 204 h), as a consequence of a marked reduction in total clearance (0.13 and 0.25 ng.ml-1.h-1), whereas the apparent volume of distribution was similar in patients and controls (4.7 and 3.9 l/kg-1). The free fraction of the drug in patients was higher (5.5%) than in controls (2.9%). Correction for differences in protein binding revealed clearance in the patients was one-fifth (1.8 and 10.5 ng ml-1.kg-1) and volume of distribution one-half (65.0 and 118.4 l.kg-1) that in controls. The systemic availability of oral chlordesmethyldiazepam was high (110%) in spite of a relatively slow absorption rate. These results indicate a need for caution in the administration of chlordesmethyldiazepam to patients with liver disease.", 
    "34": "The pharmacokinetics of lorazepam was examined in 10 male patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus before and following treatment with neomycin and cholestyramine. Neomycin and cholestyramine were given in an attempt to block the enterohepatic circulation of lorazepam and so to permit an in vivo estimate of hepatic glucuronidation. The volume of distribution and clearance of free lorazepam in diabetic patients were not significantly different from the corresponding estimates in 14 normal controls. Neomycin and cholestyramine increased the clearance of lorazepam by 63% consistent with their effect in non-diabetic controls. However, patients on beef/pork insulin exhibited a greater than normal increase on this interupting regimen (125%), and had a significantly greater neomycin/cholestyramine cycling-interrupted clearance of lorazepam than either normal controls or patients on human insulin (15.4 vs. 6.96 and 7.87 ml.min-1.kg-1). The clearance was correlated positively and significantly with HbA1c and glycated proteins (fructosamine), but only in patients on human insulin. Thus, the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam was not altered in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. However, it is possible that there are differences in the rate and extent of hepatic glucuronidation and enterohepatic circulation of lorazepam between patients treated with beef/pork and human insulins and between diabetics treated with beef/pork insulin and non-diabetic controls.", 
    "35": "To determine whether zolpidem (an imidazopyridine hypnotic) produces amnestic effects which are similar to those produced by triazolam (a benzodiazepine hypnotic), 70 subjects were administered either triazolam (0.125, 0.25, or 0.5 mg), zolpidem (5, 10, or 15 mg) or placebo, then tested on Simulated Escape, Restricted Reminding, and Paired-Associates memory tests at 1.5 hours post-dosing (i.e., near the time of estimated peak blood concentration for both drugs) and again at 6 hours post-dosing. Triazolam 0.5 mg produced the greatest memory impairment at both test times, and also produced the greatest degree of sedation during intervening daytime naps in a non-sleep-conducive environment. Other doses of triazolam and zolpidem produced less memory impairment, but also failed to significantly enhance sleep. The results are consistent with the view that the amnestic and hypnotic effects of these sleep-inducing medications are functionally coupled.", 
    "36": "Virgin female rats do not display maternal behavior if they are not exposed to the pups during several days. This exposure is called induction. In this work we have studied the effects of early postnatal (PO-P16) diazepam (DZ) administration (1 and 2.5 mg/kg, SC) on the display of maternal behavior of virgin female rats when adults. Although we did not find statistically significant differences between P0-P16 DZ treated and control females with respect to the latency of retrieval, P0-P16 DZ administration resulted in a statistically significant increase of the percentage of female rats that became maternal, showing retrieval behavior. This early postnatal treatment with DZ also increased other variables that are currently measured in maternal behavior tests, such as: time of physical contacts, grooming, crouching, and nest building quality. No statistically significant differences were found in the body weight of treated versus control animals during development, nor during adulthood. Our results provide further evidence that the GABAA-BDZ-Cl- receptor complex is implicated in the development of maternal behavior in female rats.", 
    "37": "Stedim 6 and Clearflex, two new polyethylene-lined materials for infusion bags, were studied for their compatibility with disodium clodronate, chlorpromazine and maprotiline hydrochlorides, diazepam, and clorazepate dipotassium salt, comparatively with borosilicate glass flasks and polyvinyl chloride bags. Diazepam, the only drug to exhibit a marked sorption in PVC bags (the loss reached 25% of the initial concentration after a contact duration of 72 h), showed lower sorption in Stedim 6 bags (loss about 11% under the same conditions) and none in Clearflex bags. No significant difference was observed between the infusion solutions used as vehicles of the drugs (5% dextrose and 0.9% sodium chloride isotonic solutions). The results are discussed in terms of lipophilicity of the drugs and crystallinity of the polymers.", 
    "38": "(3SR,4RS)-3,4-Epoxypiperidine-4-carboxylic acid (isoguvacine oxide) is a potent and specific GABAA receptor agonist. Isoguvacine oxide, originally designed as a potentially alkylating agonist, turned out to interact with the GABAA receptor in a fully reversible manner. The protected form of isoguvacine oxide, benzyl (3SR,4RS)-1-(benzyl-oxycarbonyl)-3,4-epoxypiperidin e-4-carboxylate (1) (Scheme 1), has now been resolved by chiral chromatography using cellulose triacetate as a chiral stationary phase. The enantiomers of 1 (ee > or = 98.8%) were subsequently deprotected by hydrogenolysis. Whereas both enantiomers of isoguvacine oxide were inactive as inhibitors of the binding of [3H]GABA to GABAB receptor sites (IC50 > 100 microM), (+)-isoguvacine oxide (IC50 = 0.20 +/- 0.03 microM) and (-)-isoguvacine oxide (IC50 = 0.32 +/- 0.05 microM) showed comparable potencies as inhibitors of the binding of [3H]GABA to GABAA receptor sites. Furthermore, (+)-isoguvacine oxide (EC50 = 6 microM; 33% relative efficacy) and (-)-isoguvacine oxide (EC50 = 5 microM; 38% efficacy relative to 10 microM muscimol) were approximately equipotent and equiefficacious as stimulators of the binding of [3H]diazepam to the GABAA receptor-associated benzodiazepine site. This latter effect is an in vitro estimate of GABAA agonist efficacy. These pharmacological data for isoguvacine oxide and its enantiomers do not seem to support our earlier conception of the topography of the GABAA recognition site(s), derived from extensive structure-activity studies on GABAA agonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "39": "Stress hormones noradrenaline and adrenaline were measured in plasma before and after premedication to objectivate the anxiolytic potency of different premedication methods in children. In addition indirect signs of sympathoadrenergic activity (heart rate and blood pressure) as well as children's behavior and reaction to face mask were documented. Each group consisted of 16 children (aged 3 to 15 years). One group was prepared only psychologically, the second group received 0.1 mg/kg midazolam intravenously and the third group was given 1 mg/kg promethazine orally. Blood pressure and heart rate decreased after premedication, mainly in the midazolam group. After mask exposition in all groups noradrenaline and adrenaline levels increased with the exception of adrenaline in the midazolam-group, where the levels remained low. Mask acceptance and anxiolysis were better in the midazolam-group than in other groups. Reduction in heart rate and blood pressure, catecholamines in plasma, anxiolysis and a high mask acceptance indicate that intravenous administration of midazolam is very effective in premedicating children.", 
    "40": "Intranasal midazolam offers an attractive alternative for use as a sedative agent for medical imaging studies in children. Its convenient administration and rapid onset are significant advantages over intravenous and oral agents. Because of its short duration, it is effective only for short procedures and as an adjunct to other sedative agents. When younger children present with such requirements, a dose of 0.2 mg/kg has been safe and effective in our experience. We advocate its use with adherence to guidelines for sedation published by the American Academy of Pediatrics.", 
    "41": "The present series of studies investigated the effects of intensive training, postnatal handling-stimulation and/or perinatal flumazenil (Ro 15-1788, benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) on the acquisition of two-way active avoidance by Roman low-avoidance (RLA/Verh) rats. This rat line has been selectively bred for poor avoidance in the shuttle box, while their Roman high-avoidance counterparts (RHA/Verh) have been selectively bred for their extremely good performance in that task. In the first experiment, RLA/Verh rats submitted to a long and intensive training procedure (unlike those submitted to short training) were able to achieve a performance of 56% of avoidances per session. In the second experiment both postnatal handling and perinatal flumazenil treatments increased avoidance responding in another group of RLA/Verh rats tested at the age of 18 months. Finally, in the last experiment, the performance of a third stock of RLA/Verh rats of the same age which had received perinatal flumazenil did not differ, on the later phases of training, from that shown by RHA/Verh animals. The results are discussed in terms of the \"warm up\" phenomena which seems to be highly involved in the selection of RLA/Verh rats, as well as on the possibility that central benzodiazepine receptors could play a role in the genetic deficit shown by RLA/Verh rats, which apparently confers a greater emotivity.", 
    "42": "Recent findings indicate that the memory-impairing effects of benzodiazepines may preferentially involve the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala. To test this hypothesis we examined the effects on pretrial injection of diazepam into the central as compared to the lateral/basolateral amygdaloid nuclei on memory for a conditioned avoidance response. Rats were implanted bilaterally with cannulae directed to either the central or lateral/basolateral amygdaloid nuclei. Five to 7 days later they were trained on a multitrial inhibitory avoidance (step-down) task to criterion and tested 48 h later. Fifteen minutes before training they were given an injection of either vehicle or diazepam (0.7 or 1.4 nmol) into the central or lateral/basolateral nuclei. Administration of diazepam into the lateral/basolateral nuclei but not the central nucleus induced anterograde amnesia. These results add to the body of data linking the GABA-benzodiazepine system of the lateral/basolateral nuclei to the amnestic effects induced by peripheral as well as central administration of benzodiazepines.", 
    "43": "Influence of diazepam on the pharmacokinetics of quinidine was studied in eight healthy human volunteers by administering 250 mg of quinidine sulphate either alone or in combination with 10 mg diazepam in a cross-over study. Quinidine in the biological samples was estimated fluorimetrically. Comparison of various pharmacokinetic parameters of quinidine (Cmax 2.165 +/- 0.457 vs 2.239 +/- 0.338 micrograms/ml, Tmax 2 +/- 0.71 vs 2.13 +/- 0.58 h, T1/2 7.004 +/- 1.302 vs 7.82 +/- 1.63 h, Cls/f 153.63 +/- 45.65 vs 134.87 +/- 31 ml/h/kg, AUC0-alpha 22.131 +/- 6.118 vs 24.321 +/- 4.924 micrograms.h/ml) by means of a two tailed t-test revealed no significant (p > 0.05) effect of diazepam on quinidine disposition kinetics.", 
    "44": "Age-dependent changes in the expression of muscarinic M1 and M2 cholinergic receptors were assessed in the CA1 and CA3 fields of hippocampus using radioligand binding and autoradiographic techniques with [3H]-pirenzepine and [3H]-AF-DX 116 as ligands. Male Wistar rats of 2 months (young), 12 months (adult) and 27 months (old) of age were examined. Radioligand binding analysis revealed a significant decrease of the density of muscarinic M1 cholinergic receptors with increasing age and no change in muscarinic M2 cholinergic receptors. Autoradiographic evaluation of the number of silver grains developed within the cell body of pyramidal neurons of the CA1 and CA3 fields revealed a decrease of muscarinic M1 cholinergic receptors in the 27-month-old rats in comparison with younger cohorts and no changes in muscarinic M2 cholinergic receptors. These findings suggest that the reduction of muscarinic M1 sites noticed between rats of 2- and 12-months of age using radioligand binding techniques is probably dependent on the loss of hippocampal neurons rather than on the reduction of receptor density per neuron. Our data also indicate that appropriate morphological techniques associated with quantitative analysis may be useful in assessing age-dependent changes in the expression of neurotransmitter receptors by specific neuronal populations. The possible pharmaco-therapeutic relevance of the decreased expression of muscarinic M1 cholinergic receptors by pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus of old rats is discussed.", 
    "45": "Activation of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors by certain agonists, including AMPA and glutamate, has been shown to result in a rapid desensitization of the receptor. This desensitization is profoundly inhibited by the benzothiadiazide diuretic, cyclothiazide. We previously reported that cyclothiazide potentiates AMPA-induced [3H]norepinephrine ([3H]NE) release from rat hippocampal slices. We used this system to investigate the possible interaction of cyclothiazide with various AMPA receptor antagonists, including the competitive antagonist LY293558 and the 2,3-benzodiazepine noncompetitive antagonist GYKI 53655. Cyclothiazide significantly potentiated both AMPA- and KA-induced [3H]NE release from slices of the rat hippocampus. LY293558 and GYKI 53655 inhibited the potentiated and nonpotentiated AMPA- and KA-induced [3H]NE release in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC50 values for inhibition of AMPA- or KA-induced [3H]NE release by either antagonist were not affected by the presence of cyclothiazide. Thus, cyclothiazide seems to interact at a site on the AMPA receptor complex which differs from either the glutamate recognition site or the 2,3-benzodiazepine allosteric site.", 
    "46": "Pharmacokinetic drug interactions take place when one drug interacts with another at the level of metabolism, absorption or excretion. Pharmacodynamic interactions take place at the level of receptor sites, where they may have additive or potentiating effects. Vigabatrin is relatively free of pharmacokinetic interactions, and though it is associated with about a 20% decrease in serum levels of concomitantly administered phenytoin, the reduction is of little clinical significance. The mechanism underlying this effect is unknown. Because vigabatrin increases GABA-mediated inhibition in the brain (an action that is believed to account for its anticonvulsant effects), it might be expected to potentiate the CNS effects of benzodiazepines and alcohol. However, very sensitive eye movement studies have failed to detect any evidence of such an interaction. Overall, vigabatrin appears to be remarkably free of drug interactions. As a result, it is easier to use in clinical practice than older anti-epilepsy agents. Perhaps the most important finding of the interaction studies with vigabatrin is that there is no need for patients receiving the drug to be told to avoid alcohol.", 
    "47": "In the past, epilepsy was usually treated with polytherapy, but with little knowledge as to the interactions and side-effects of the combinations of the anti-epileptic drugs used. Adverse events and sparse clinical knowledge led to monotherapy becoming the treatment regime of choice. A new generation of drugs, which are well-tolerated and have few or predictable interactions, have enabled the reassessment of polytherapy for the treatment of epilepsy. Extensive clinical trials of these drugs are allowing the emergence of a new, rationalized approach to polytherapy. In our study, 19 patients with refractory partial epilepsy, and who were 'socially active and integrated into society', received vigabatrin as add-on therapy. Patients were taking a mean of 1.5 drugs, and five patients were taking small doses of drugs which lead to tolerance, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines. With vigabatrin as add-on therapy, 14 patients (73%) had a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, and 10 (52%) had a greater than 70% reduction in seizure frequency. In one patient, seizure frequency increased, and two patients developed myoclonic jerks. Vigabatrin was not shown to have any harmful effects in extensive laboratory, EEG and cognitive function tests. In fact, a minor improvement occurred in visual memory, which was probably related to the reduction in seizures. Addition of vigabatrin may, therefore, be of benefit to patients with partial epilepsy refractory to monotherapy with standard anti-epilepsy drugs.", 
    "48": "The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of an objective rating scale (the modified Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol [CIWA-A]) and a diazepam loading dose (20 mg) in the management of alcohol withdrawal among hospitalized psychiatric patients. The sample consisted of 152 adult, hospitalized, psychiatric patients with comorbid alcohol dependence. Of the 152 subjects, 115 (75.7%) completed detoxification with supportive therapy only. Among the 37 patients who required pharmacotherapy (24%), 15 (40.5%) required only one 20-mg dose of diazepam, 14 (38%) required 40 mg to 100 mg, and 8 (21.6%) required doses ranging from 120 mg to 220 mg. There were no complications related to this treatment. The results suggest that the use of the objective rating scale and the diazepam loading dose appears to be safe and effective, and is a useful method for the management of alcohol withdrawal among psychiatric patients.", 
    "49": "Our objective was to assemble expert clinical experience and judgment in the treatment of anxiety and related disorders in a systematic, quantitative manner. This article reports on some clinical features apart from diagnosis that may affect choice of strategy in the pharmacotherapy of anxiety disorders. A panel of internationally recognized experts in treating anxiety and depression was constituted by multistage peer nomination. Ninety percent (66 of 73) completed an extensive questionnaire. This report focuses on the expert panel's responses to questions on therapeutic options, based on multi-part case vignettes of several anxiety disorders presenting clinical variations within the same diagnosis. In the presence of higher levels of functional impairment, the experts more often recommended formal psychosocial procedures for adjustment disorder; medication for agoraphobia, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and adjustment disorder; and polypharmacy for agoraphobia. Their therapeutic recommendations were not materially affected by chronicity in the case of panic disorder. Under the condition of heavy use of alcohol in the case of generalized anxiety disorder, the experts avoided benzodiazepines in favor of various other medications. In the presence of a serious cardiac conduction defect in the case of obsessive-compulsive disorder, they less often recommended medication. Those who did recommend medication changed their preference from tricyclic antidepressants (clomipramine) to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Under the condition of a more severe precipitating event in the case of adjustment disorder, the experts were more likely to recommend both formal psychosocial intervention and medication.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "50": "This study characterizes the pattern of placebo response in depressed panic disorder patients who participated in a randomized clinical trial. We compared placebo-treated subjects whose panic attacks remitted, with those whose attacks did not remit, and with remitting and nonremitting subjects treated with active medication. Seventy-one subjects who met criteria for panic disorder and for a concurrent depressive diagnosis (major depression, dysthymia, or depressive disorder not otherwise specified [NOS]) were treated with either imipramine (n = 36) or alprazolam (n = 35), and 28 patients were treated with placebo. Sixteen placebo-treated and 40 medication-treated patients were panic free at Week 8. Placebo panic remitters were significantly more ill than active-medication remitters on all measures. In contrast, subjects who achieved panic remission on placebo showed no difference on other clinical measures from active medication nonremitters, and little difference from placebo nonremitters. Results support the need for assessment of all core panic disorder symptoms in determining treatment efficacy and in considerations of response and remission.", 
    "51": "The effect of pretreatment with PK 11195, a ligand of the 'peripheral-type' benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), on convulsions induced by lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane, gamma-HCH) in rats was examined, to determine whether the mechanism of this convulsant activity may be mediated through the PBR. PK 11195 elicited a protective effect against the convulsant activity of orally administered lindane. It reduced the frequency of animals exhibiting convulsions and delayed the time to onset of these seizures. The concentration of lindane in the brain was found to be significantly lower in PK 11195 pretreated rats and a high correlation between blood and brain lindane concentrations was obtained. When similar experiments were repeated with alpha-HCH, a non-convulsant isomer of HCH, brain and blood concentrations were again found to be significantly reduced in PK 11195 pretreated animals. We conclude that the 'anticonvulsant' action of PK 11195 was not due to an interaction of PK 11195 and lindane on common CNS target sites, but by an action of PK 11195 on the gastrointestinal tract of the animal, delaying the absorption of lindane into the bloodstream.", 
    "52": "Several 6-chloro-2,3-disubstituted imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazines, selected from a number of synthetic imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazines which lacked significant binding activity at central benzodiazepine receptors, potently inhibit [3H]diazepam, [3H]Ro5-4864 and [3H]PK11195 binding to rat kidney mitochondrial membranes. In membrane preparations from cultures of THP-1 cells, a human monocytic leukaemia cell line, the isoquinoline carboxamide PK11195 is strongly bound but the benzodiazepine ligands, diazepam and Ro5-4864, are much more weakly bound. The imidazopyridazine compounds which bind strongly to mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors are very potent displacers of [3H]PK11195 bound to the THP-1 membranes. It appears that the binding properties of these new imidazopyridazine ligands at 'peripheral-type' benzodiazepine receptors resemble those of the isoquinoline carboxamides more than those of the benzodiazepines.",

Group 1 received midazolam 0.5 mg.kg-1, Group 2, ketamine 6 mg.kg-1 and Group 3 a mixture of midazolam 0.4 mg.kg-1 + ketamine 4 mg.kg-1. Each dose was mixed with atropine 0.02 mg.kg-1 plus an equal volume of cherry syrup and was given orally 20 to 30 min prior to surgery. A grade of 1 (asleep, difficult to arouse), 2 (asleep, easily aroused), 3 (awake, calm), 4 (awake, anxious, occasional cry), or 5 (crying, agitated), was assigned at the time of parental separation and again when mask induction was begun. A grade of 1-3 was considered successful. For parental separation, the mixture of ketamine+midazolam was 100% successful, ketamine 90% and midazolam 75%. Successful mask induction for the mixture of ketamine+midazolam was 85%, midazolam 65% and ketamine 42%. This study indicates that a mixture of ketamine+midazolam is the most effective.",

Intra-accumbens amphetamine (20 micrograms) facilitated bar pressing for conditioned rewards. Systemic administration of L-365,260 potentiated this amphetamine response but produced no effect on responding when administered alone.

Injection of diazepam or baclofen reduced the total behavioral scores in a dose-related manner as well as the cAMP levels with respect to the control values (animals treated with artificial cerebrospinal fluid). When diazepam was tested in animals simultaneously injected with alpha-MSH, behavioral scores decreased with respect to those treated with the peptide alone. Cyclic AMP also decreased after combined treatment (MSH + diazepam).", 
    "63": "Quantitative EEG is a sensitive method used to assess the effects of pharmacological substances on the central nervous system (CNS) activity. A standard technique is to measure the EEG under vigilance-controlled and resting conditions for a short duration, for example 5 min. The aim of the present study was to investigate the stability of 5-min EEG recordings. While the time course of the EEG was fairly stable during the recording session under the vigilance-controlled condition, systematic trends became apparent under the resting condition. Pharmaco-sensitivity of the EEG and its reliability increased with the recording duration. Five minutes of EEG recording seem to be sufficient and well chosen to evaluate the influence of drugs on the EEG.", 
    "64": "Abecarnil, bretazenil, and Ro 19-8022 inhibited the binding of [3H]Ro 15-4513 to diazepamsensitive and -insensitive sites in the rat cerebellum and cerebral cortex, but all three had a much higher affinity for the diazepam-sensitive sites in both tissues. The GABA-shift for bretazenil and Ro 19-8022 was low ( < 2) for all sites studied, consistent with their partial agonistic profile. The GABA-shift for abecarnil was appreciably higher for diazepam-sensitive binding in the cerebellum than in the cerebral cortex (1.97 vs 1.18). Furthermore, the GABA-shift for abecarnil was markedly different for the diazepam-sensitive and -insensitive sites in the cerebellum (1.97 vs 0.71). All three compounds inhibited [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding to the diazepam-sensitive sites with a slope factor > 1, suggestive of positive cooperativity in their binding to GABAA receptors. Abecarnil only partially inhibited diazepam-insensitive binding of [3H]Ro 15-4513 in the cerebellum, indicating that this site can be differentiated into abecarnil-sensitive and -insensitive components.", 
    "65": "The influence of the stage of the estrous cycle on binding of [3H]diazepam was examined in membranes from brains of female mice. In order to conserve endogenous factors such as progesterone, other steroids, or GABA, the assay was performed without the extensive washing procedures typically employed in measurements of benzodiazepine binding. Significant variations in the apparent maximal numbers of binding sites (Bmax) were noted during the estrous cycle in both hypothalamus and cortex. The Bmax measured in membranes from proestrus female mice was significantly higher than in membranes from mice at other stages in the estrous cycle. Variations in apparent equilibrium binding dissociation constants (Kd) were not statistically significant by stage of the estrous cycle. The demonstrated variations in binding suggest the existence of a factor which varies with the estrous cycle in female mice and modulates the activity of the GABAA receptor complex.", 
    "66": "We investigated the roles played by three muscarinic receptors (M1, M2, and M3) in the pressor response with bradycardia that followed the injection of neostigmine (5 x 10(-8) mol) into the hippocampus of anesthetized rats. These changes were blocked by the co-administration of methylatropine (5 x 10(-8) mol). The intrahippocampal injection of pirenzepine (M1 antagonist) (5 x 10(-9) - 5 x 10(-7) mol) suppressed the neostigmine-induced pressor response dose-dependently. However injection of gallamine (M2 antagonist) (5 x 10(-8) - 5 x 10(-7) mol) and of 4-DAMP (M1 and M3 antagonist) (5 x 10(-8) - 5 x 10(-7) mol) did not suppress this hypertensive response. These findings suggest that the neostigmine-induced pressor response with bradycardia is mediated through the M1 muscarinic receptor subtype.", 
    "67": "Incorporation of the gamma 2 subunit into gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors is required for the expression of benzodiazepine pharmacology, but the regions of the subunit responsible for benzodiazepine actions have not been defined. Using mutagenesis, we identified a single amino acid of the gamma 2 subunit of the human GABAA receptor that profoundly alters the nature of this pharmacology. When threonine 142 was mutated to serine, the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil, and the weak inverse agonist, Ro 15-4513, both acted as potent partial agonists. Further, potentiation of GABA responses by diazepam, alprazolam, clonazepam, or flunitrazepam doubled in receptors containing the Ser-142 gamma 2 subunit. In contrast, responses to the Type I benzodiazepine receptor selective ligands, zolpidem, alpidem, and CL218,872, were roughly halved. This change in pharmacology appears to occur at a stage following ligand binding, i.e. the mutation affects benzodiazepine efficacy. There was no effect on GABA affinity or efficacy or pentobarbital, Ro 5-4864, or alphaxalone modulation of GABA responses. These findings demonstrate that very minor changes in receptor structure can profoundly affect the efficacy of receptor ligands. Thus, agonism is determined not only by the structure of the drug, but also by the structure of the receptor, or protein complex, with which it interacts.", 
    "68": "The present study was undertaken to study the effect of reduced cortical cholinergic activity on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic and glutamatergic mechanisms in cholinoceptive cortical target regions which are assumed to play an important role for realizing cognitive functions. The densities of cortical muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtypes and corresponding receptor genes m1 through m4, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) and kainate glutamate receptor subtypes as well as GABAA and benzodiazepine receptors were measured in rats 1 week after unilateral ibotenic acid lesion of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (Nbm) applying quantitative receptor autoradiography and in situ hybridization. Ibotenic acid lesion resulted in a striking loss of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) staining in the lesioned Nbm which is associated with a 60% decrease in AChE staining and a 30% reduction in [3H]hemicholinium-3 binding in frontal and parietal cortical regions as well fore- and hindlimb areas ipsilateral to the lesion, being more prominent in the more rostral cortical regions. M1-muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding was not changed in any of the cortical regions studied 1 week after lesion. M2-muscarinic receptor binding levels are slightly increased in the parietal cortex only. The lesion-induced increase in parietal cortical M2-muscarinic receptor binding is complemented by an increase in the hybridization signal for the corresponding m4-mRNA transcript. In cortical regions displaying a reduced activity of AChE and decreased levels of high-affinity choline uptake sites due to forebrain cholinergic lesion, NMDA receptor binding was markedly reduced in comparison to the unlesioned brain side whereas AMPA and kainate binding has been significantly increased in these regions. Muscimol binding to GABAA receptors was increased in the rostral portions of frontal and parietal cortices as compared with the unlesioned brain side. Binding levels of benzodiazepine receptors were not affected by the lesion in any of the cortical regions studied. The differential changes in glutamate and GABA receptor subtypes following lesion might be regarded as the consequence of a cortical reorganization compensating for the reduced cholinergic presynaptic input. The data further suggest that presynaptic cortical cholinergic deficits might affect both glutamatergic and GABAergic functions with different intensity and different directions.", 
    "69": "The effects of somatostatin on the impairment of working memory induced in rats by blockade of hippocampal muscarinic M1 or NMDA receptors were examined, using a three-panel runway task. Both the muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine (1.0 microgram/side) and the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist CPP ((+/-)-3(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonoic acid) (32 ng/side) significantly increased the number of working memory errors (attempts to pass through two incorrect panels of the three panel-gates at four choice points), when injected bilaterally into the dorsal hippocampus. This effect of intrahippocampal pirenzepine on working memory was alleviated by concurrent injection of 0.32 microgram/side somatostatin. However, concurrent somatostatin (0.1 or 0.32 microgram/side) had no significant effect on the intrahippocampal CPP-induced increase in working memory errors. These results suggest that somatostatin ameliorates the impairment of working memory resulting from hippocampal muscarinic M1 receptor blockade, possibly through activation of cholinergic functions.", 
    "70": "The mechanisms for the combined antinociceptive effect of midazolam and morphine administered at spinal (intrathecal, i.t.) and supraspinal (intracerebroventricular, i.c.v.) levels were investigated in rats. Nociceptive test results showed that co-administration of midazolam and morphine at the spinal level potentiated morphine-induced antinociception, and that this interaction was blocked by intraperitoneal (i.p.) naloxone and reversed by i.t. bicuculline and i.p. flumazenil. Also, bicuculline and flumazenil blocked midazolam-induced antinociception at the spinal level, and naloxone completely reversed morphine antinociception. In contrast, when drugs were injected intracerebroventricularly, midazolam inhibited the antinociceptive effect of morphine (as determined by the hot-plate test). The inhibitory effects of i.c.v. midazolam upon i.c.v. morphine antinociception were partly blocked by flumazenil and bicuculline. Midazolam-induced antinociception was increased by bicuculline and decreased by flumazenil; naloxone i.p. blocked both i.c.v. morphine antinociception and i.c.v. morphine-midazolam antinociception. Results after i.t. injection may be due to an interaction between morphine and midazolam/GABAA receptor-activated systems. At the supraspinal level, this interaction may also activate other systems that are distinct from those governing the individual action of each agonist.", 
    "71": "In this study, the elevated zero-maze model of anxiety was used to investigate CCK receptor antagonist effects on the behaviour of male Lister-hooded rats and to demonstrate, by administering antagonists in the presence or absence of selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) re-uptake inhibitors, the involvement of 5-HT in the mediation of these effects. Devazepide, a selective CCKA receptor antagonist, L-365,260 (3R(+)-N-2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepin- 3-yl-N1- (3-methyl-phenyl)urea) or CI-988 (4-([2-[[3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-2-methyl-1- oxo-2-[[(tricyclo[3.3.1.1.(3.7)]-dec-2-yloxy)-carbonyl]-amin o]- propyl]-amino]-1-phenylethyl]-amino)-4-oxo-[R-(R*,R*)]-butanoate- N-methyl-D-glucamine), both selective CCKB receptor antagonists, were administered 30 min prior to testing. Behavioural analysis during testing included measures of risk-assessment behaviours (e.g. stretched-attend posture) in addition to time spent on the open quadrants. Devazepide induced significant anxiolytic effects, whereas CI-988 produced inconsistent results and L-365,260 was ineffective. When administered simultaneously with the 5-HT re-uptake inhibitors zimelidine or Wy 27587 (N-[[[1-[(6- fluoro-2-naphthalenyl)methyl]-4-piperidinyl]amino] carbonyl]-3-pyridine carboxamide methyl sulphonate salt), the significant anxiolytic effect induced by devazepide was dose-dependently and significantly attenuated. Zimelidine and Wy27587 had little effect alone on zero-maze behaviour at the lower of two doses given. These data show that the elevated zero-maze, in conjunction with the analysis of 'risk-assessment' behaviours, is an anxiety model which is sensitive to the anxiolytic effects of CCK receptor antagonism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "72": "This report describes the pharmacological properties of a novel renin inhibitor (YM-26365: (3R)-3-[3-[(1S)-1-cyclohexylmethyl-2-hydroxy-3- [(1-methyl-5-tetrazolyl)thio]propyl]ureido]-1-methyl-5-phenyl- 2,3-dihydro-1H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one) with molecular weight 577 and no peptide bonds. YM-26365 inhibited human plasma renin with an IC50 value of 2.9 x 10(-6) M, but did not affect plasma renin from dogs, rabbits, and rats at 10(-4) M. YM-26365 inhibited not only human renin, but also cathepsin D with an IC50 value of 1.7 x 10(-5) M. This compound competitively inhibited the reaction between recombinant human renin and N-acetyl tetradecapeptide with a Ki value of 1.1 x 10(-6) M. In pithed spontaneously hypertensive rats, YM-26365 at 10 mg/kg i.v. significantly antagonized the pressor response to recombinant human renin, but did not affect responses to angiotensin II, angiotensin I, norepinephrine, or arginine vasopressin. Similarly, oral administration of YM-26365 (10 and 30 mg/kg) to pithed spontaneously hypertensive rats caused a shift to the right of the recombinant human renin dose-pressor response curve. Systemic bioavailability as determined on the basis of the ratio of the total area under the plasma concentration-time curve after 3 mg/kg i.v. and 30 mg/kg orally to rats was 9.6%. These results demonstrate that YM-26365 is a weak but orally absorbed, low molecular weight renin inhibitor.", 
    "73": "Benzodiazepines (BZ) exert their effects through GABAA receptors, which belong to the superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels. Coexpression of recombinant alpha, beta, and gamma subunits in a cell culture system mimics the BZ binding sites. The alpha variants largely determine the nature of the BZ binding site in such alpha i beta j gamma k heteromultimers (i = 1-6; j = 1-3; k = 1-3). Notably, the alpha 1 and alpha 6 variants confer high and low affinity for BZ agonists to the resulting receptor subtype, respectively. Glycine/glutamate and histidine/arginine positions in the alpha subunits of alpha x beta 2 gamma 2 receptors are involved in BZ I versus BZ II type selectivity. We now identify four amino acids in alpha 6 which together increase the affinity of the mutant alpha x beta 2 gamma 2 receptor for classical BZ receptor agonists above the level seen for any wild-type GABAA/BZ receptor. The most pronounced effect was due to an isoleucine to valine exchange. It simultaneously decreased the affinity for the BZ partial inverse agonist Ro 15-4513 20-fold and increased the affinity for diazepam 4-fold. The four amino acid residues stretch over most part of the N-terminal extracellular domain of the alpha subunit, suggesting that amino acids distant in the primary sequence form the BZ binding pocket.", 
    "74": "A series of novel N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists acting at the phencyclidine site has been identified. Compound 2 has a Ki = 8 +/- 1 nM (vs [3H]thienylcyclidine, [3H]TCP) as a mixture of enantiomers. Resolution and further testing indicate that (-)-2, Ki = 4 +/- 0.7 nM, is a potent and selective TCP site ligand with neuroprotective activity in cultured neurons in the presence of excitotoxic concentrations of NMDA (IC50 = 26 nM). Compound (-)-2 is > 1000-fold selective for the TCP site vs a panel of receptor types including opiate, adrenergic, serotonergic, dopamine, adenosine, dihydropyridine, and benzodiazepine and displays increased selectivity for the activated (open) NMDA receptor-ion channel complex vs PCP and MK801 as measured by patch recordings in cultured, voltage-clamped neurons. Highly enhanced \"open-channel\" selectivity leads to tentative classification of these ligands as uncompetitive vs NMDA. Ligands with these characteristics may enable deconvolution of the pharmacologic effects associated with typical noncompetitive NMDA antagonists. We report here on the identification, synthesis, and activity of compounds of this structural class.", 
    "75": "A cloned Drosophila gamma-aminobutyric acid GABA receptor subunit (Rdl) has been stably expressed as a functional homo-oligomeric ion channel in a Drosophila cell line. Stably-transfected clonal cell lines which expressed high levels of GABA receptor were identified by specific [3H]-muscimol binding. Expression of functional GABA-gated ion channels in these cell lines was demonstrated by electrophysiological recording. Rapid and pronounced rundown of responses to GABA during whole-cell patch clamp recordings was overcome by the inclusion of EGTA in the pipette solution, indicating a possible role for calcium-dependent processes in the functional regulation of this GABA receptor. Relative agonist potencies of the expressed receptor were found to be in the order GABA = TACA > CACA. We have observed a reversible block of the receptor by the convulsant antagonists, picrotoxinin and EBOB, and by the insecticide fipronil. Potentiation of GABA responses was seen with the anaesthetic steroid 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one. No significant effects (either agonist, antagonist or modulatory) were observed with bicuculline (a vertebrate GABAAR antagonist), benzodiazepines or barbiturates (vertebrate GABAAR modulators), or with glycine agonist of the closely related vertebrate glycine receptors). The suitability of this Drosophila stable expression system for the characterization of receptors and ion channels is discussed.", 
    "76": "A study was made of the effects of di- and trivalent cations on homomeric rho 1-type gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA rho 1) receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes after injection of mRNA coding for the GABA rho 1 subunit. GABA elicited large currents with a Kd approximately 1 microM. The properties of these GABA rho 1 receptors were similar to those of native bicuculline-resistant GABA receptors expressed by retinal mRNA. GABA rho 1 currents showed very little desensitization, were blocked by picrotoxin but not by bicuculline, and were not modulated by barbiturates, benzodiazepines, or beta-carbolines. Zn2+ reversibly decreased GABA rho 1 responses (IC50 = 22 microM). Other divalent cations were also tested and their rank order of potency was: Zn2+ approximately Ni2+ approximately Cu2+ > Cd2+, whereas Ba2+, Co2+, Sr2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ showed little or no effect. In contrast, La3+ reversibly potentiated the GABA currents mediated by homomeric GABA rho 1 receptors, with an EC50 = 135 microM and a maximal potentiation of about 100% (GABA, 1 microM; La3+, 1 mM). Other lanthanides showed similar effects (Lu3+ > Eu3+ > Tb3+ > Gd3+ > Er3% > Nd3+ > La3+ > Ce3+). Thus, GABA rho 1 receptors contain sites for cationic recognition, and in particular, Zn2+ may play a role during synaptic transmission in the retina."
