    "0": "Although the serotonergic system has been implicated in the modulation of anxiety states, the specific receptor subtypes that mediate these states require clarification. The effects of drugs that act preferentially at 5-HT1B receptors were evaluated on the behavior elicited in the elevated plus-maze, an animal model of anxiety. Variations in the intensity of light affected mouse behavior in the plus-maze; lower light intensity increased the entries to and time spent on the open arm in a manner similar to that seen with stress-attenuating circumstances. Opposite effects were observed in high light-intensity, similar to effects seen under elevated stress conditions. Chlordiazepoxide produced increased entries and time spent on the open arm, whereas pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) produced opposite effects. The preferential 5-HT1B agents TFMPP and mCPP exhibited a profile similar to PTZ. The effects of TFMPP in the plus-maze were reversed by chlordiazepoxide, but not by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil, which suggests that this effect is not directly mediated by benzodiazepine receptors. The decreased entries and time spent on the open arm of the maze following TFMPP or mCPP administration was possibly mediated by an antagonistic action at 5-HT1B receptors, since this effect was reversed by the selective 5-HT1B agonist CGS 12066B. The present study further demonstrates the utility of mouse behavior in the elevated plus-maze as a model for identifying anxio-modulatory substances.", 
    "1": "Plasma levels and urinary excretion of lormetazepam (Noctamid-ampoules; 2 mg/10 ml) were studied after i.v. (0.015 mg/kg b.w.) and after p.o (0.03 mg/kg b.w.) administration of the drug to five patients with cirrhosis of the liver (C) and to five young male volunteers (N). The cirrhotic patients exhibited higher drug plasma levels (Cmax p.o.: 11-43 ng/ml [C] vs. 11-16 ng/ml [N]) and higher AUC0-24 values of the unchanged drug (i.v.: 66-102 ng.h/ml [C] vs. 54-72 ng.h/ml [N]; p.o.: 83-188 ng.h/ml [C] vs. 74-113 ng.h/ml [N]). The absolute bioavailability was increased in the C-group with 57-134% vs. 52-84% [N]. The total plasma clearance of lormetazepam was 3 ml/min/kg in the C-group and 4 ml/min/kg in the N-group and thus within the range known for elderly and young male subjects. Conversely to the parent compound, the AUC-figures of its 3-OH-glucuronide were higher in the N-group (346-434 ng.h/ml) than in the C-group (149-371 ng.h/ml). In 24 h pooled urine samples of both groups, the glucuronide of lorazepam, the N-demethylated metabolite, accounted for approximately 5-14% of the dose fraction excreted as lormetazepam glucuronide. Apart from increased levels of the unchanged drug due to porto-systemic shunt and/or disease-dependent lower glucuronidation rate, the pharmacokinetics of lormetazepam were not altered in cirrhotic patients. It can therefore be concluded that for this group of patients the drug can be administered according to the same dose regimen as that used for normal subjects.", 
    "2": "Previous research has implicated hippocampal rhythmical slow activity in the mechanisms of action of the anxiolytic drugs. In this study ethanol and a putative ethanol antagonist, Ro 15-4513, were investigated with reticular elicitation of rhythmical slow activity. Doses of ethanol between 0.6 and 3.1 g/kg were used. Ethanol reduced the frequency of reticular-elicited rhythmical slow activity in the same way as has been reported for anxiolytic barbiturates and benzodiazepines. This effect was linearly related to log dose of ethanol in the range of 1.7-3.1 g/kg. Ro 15-4513 at a dose of 2 mg/kg reduced the effect of ethanol (2.0 g/kg) but had no action itself. Ethanol also decreased the slope of the stimulation voltage-rhythmical slow activity frequency function but this effect was not reduced by Ro 15-4513. These results show that ethanol acts in a similar manner to conventional anxiolytic drugs but that only one component of this action can be reduced by Ro 15-4513.", 
    "3": "1. Clozapine caused dose-dependent inhibition of the release of [14C]serotonin and 45Ca uptake by purified rat peritoneal mast cells activated by concanavalin A, which is similar to the effect of benzodiazepines. 2. However, it had little ability to displace [3H]diazepam binding to mast cells.", 
    "4": "1. Neuroleptic drugs (antipsychotics) produce numerous side effects which include serious extrapyramidal symptoms consisting of akathisia, dystonia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, parkinsonian reactions such as postural abnormality, tremor, akinesia or bradykinesia, rigidity, and tardive dyskinesia. 2. Among the complications of neuroleptic chemotherapy, the most serious and potentially fatal complication is malignant syndrome, which is characterized by extreme hyperthermia, \"lead pipe\" skeletal muscle rigidity causing dyspnea, dysphagia, and rhabdomyolysis, autonomic instability, fluctuating consciousness, leukocytosis, and elevated creatine phosphokinase. 3. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome should be differentiated from malignant hyperthermia, lethal catatonia, and other pathological states producing some of these same symptoms. 4. In addition to neuroleptics, malignant syndrome has been caused by thymoleptics (antidepressants), metoclopramide (antiemetic), metoclopramide combined with cimetidine, tetrabenazine, overdosage of benzodiazepine, phenelzine, dothiepin and alcohol, and amphetamine. 5. Factors leading to and/or facilitating the emergence of neuroleptic malignant syndromes are reportedly organic brain syndrome, dehydration, exhaustion, external heat load, excessive sympathetic discharge, use of long acting neuroleptics, high doses of neuroleptics, rapid dose titration with neuroleptics, abrupt discontinuation of antiparkinsonism agents, and concurrent lithium therapy. 6. Although, the pathogenesis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome is not understood completely, a blockade of dopaminergic receptors in the hypothalamus, spinal cord and striatum, an alteration of dopaminergic-serotonergic transmission in the body, an enhanced synthesis and action of prostaglandin E1 and E2, and a modification of calcium-mediated signal transduction in the body have been suggested. 7. The treatment of malignant syndrome includes immediate withdrawal of neuroleptic drugs, i.v. infusion of dantrolene, and oral administration of bromocriptine; or alternatively i.v. infusion of dantrolene and the combination of levodopa-carbidopa. 8. Other measures to enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of the aforementioned regimens are to include the use of anticholinergic drugs such as benztropine to enhance the effectiveness of bromocriptine, of lorazepam if catatonic symptoms persist, or of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) if psychotic symptoms persist. 9. These treatments, however, must be \"active\" rather than \"passive\", in order to avert fatalities and/or unfortunate sequelae from this iatrogenic and incompletely understood disease.", 
    "5": "This paper reviews the addiction potential of all benzodiazepines currently available in the U.S.A. as well as several non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic drugs. Addiction potential was assessed by separately considering the potential for these drugs to produce three different phenomena of addiction; namely, physical dependence, psychological dependence and deleterious consequences. This review focuses on human studies conducted with research volunteers outside the therapeutic context and also on clinical studies conducted with patients receiving treatment in the therapeutic context. It is concluded that benzodiazepines have a reduced addiction potential in comparison to the predecessor barbiturates. Conclusions regarding the relative addiction potential of several non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics are difficult due to a paucity of data; however limited evidence suggests a reduced addiction potential for several of these compounds. Within the benzodiazepine class, qualitative differences in addiction potential between individual drugs are not well established.", 
    "6": "Research on the interaction of ethanol (ET) and stress published since 1981 is reviewed. Chronic physical stressors were found to increase the ingestion of ET compared to nonstressed animals. With foodshock, ingestion of ET decreased during the stress session but rose afterwards. The elevation of ET ingestion produced by daily immobilization was long-lasting and was related to individual initial preference for ET. Psychological stressors also increased ingestion of ET. In rat colonies, dominant rats ingested less ET, whereas submissive rats had the highest intake. Factors that modify the ingestion of ET include neonatal experience and REM sleep deprivation. Early weaning increased, while postnatal handling decreased preference for ET. The effect of postnatal handling may be influenced by genetics. Stress, applied during adult life or prenatally, modifies some, but not all, the acute effects of ET. There were marked individual differences in the interaction of ET and stress with respect to ingestion of ET. Conversely, ET may modify stress-induced behavioural and neurochemical changes. This interaction may be stressor specific. Some stressors increase the ET's effects, whereas others may decrease or not affect them. In brain, ET has been shown to lessen the stress-induced decrease in noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) levels and those in noradrenaline turnover and alpha 1-receptor binding. Stress-induced changes in plasma catecholamines, corticosterone, non-esterified fatty acids and amino acids, and in the decline in adrenal catecholamines are also lessened by pretreatment with ET. Possible mechanisms for the ET-stress interaction are discussed. These include mediation via the GABA-benzodiazepine-ionophore complex, endogenous opioids, the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis and the noradrenergic system.", 
    "7": "This article discusses the management of benzodiazepine (BZ) withdrawal in patients who are chronically benzodiazepine dependent. Gradual benzodiazepine discontinuation is preferable to abrupt discontinuation, particularly for patients on short half-life benzodiazepines. For a small number of patients, replacement of short half-life with long half-life benzodiazepines may also be helpful. Finally, we present new preliminary data from a controlled, double-blind study that suggest that adjunctive use of such drugs as carbamazepine, imipramine, and buspirone may be helpful in managing gradual benzodiazepine discontinuation. Initiating adjunctive medication prior to, and continuing it during and after benzodiazepine discontinuation led to significantly higher discontinuation success rates for carbamazepine (91%), buspirone (85%), and imipramine (79%) than for placebo (58%) (p less than .05). Careful followup for an extended period of time is needed after benzodiazepine discontinuation because, frequently, emerging psychiatric symptoms may again necessitate psychiatric intervention.", 
    "8": "The majority of patients with bipolar affective disorder will continue to have some recurrences of acute illness despite lithium maintenance. In a significant proportion, the frequency and severity of acute episodes necessitate the administration of adjunctive maintenance medications. Neuroleptic drugs are often used for this purpose, but anticonvulsant drugs (carbamazepine, valproate, clonazepam) are reported to have acute antimanic efficacy and may offer an alternative for some bipolar patients. We report preliminary results of an open, prospective study in which bipolar patients maintained on lithium and a neuroleptic switch to lithium and clonazepam or continue their prior treatment with lithium and neuroleptic.", 
    "9": "In the \"medical model\" view of panic disorder, essential concepts are (1) constitutional vulnerability to disorder and (2) the unique \"pathogenic\" propensity of a panic attack to generate an array of biobehavioral complications. The normal fear-security system is activated at low threshold or is vulnerable to dysregulation, a vulnerability that is triggered by life events and modified through developmental experience. The author describes the current medical model of panic disorder and then reviews psychopharmacological treatment options and their advantages and disadvantages.", 
    "10": "The effects were compared of three 2' chlorophenyl-benzodiazepines (triazolam, clonazepam and lorazepam) and three corresponding 2' deschloro-phenyl-derivatives (alprazolam, nitrazepam and oxazepam, respectively) on the incidence of six ethological elements in both timid and aggressive singly-housed male mice, treated with drugs in paired interactions with untreated non-aggressive males. Alprazolam and oxazepam reduced defensive upright postures and escapes at doses which did not reduce rearing and actually increased walking, while their chlorinated counterparts (triazolam and lorazepam, respectively) decreased incidence of defenses and escapes mostly at doses decreasing locomotor acts involving a similar movement (rears and walks, respectively). Alprazolam and oxazepam also reduced attacks at doses not reducing rears, in contrast to triazolam and lorazepam which reduced attacks only at doses suppressing rearing. Nitrazepam stimulated sniffing partners much more than its chlorinated counterpart clonazepam. The 2' deschloro-phenyl-benzodiazepines were more potent in reducing defensive-escape activities than attacks or locomotion. Yet, none of the benzodiazepines tested produced a complete inhibition of timid defensive-escape behavior at non-sedative doses. The present study suggests that 2' deschloro-phenyl-benzodiazepines are less \"sedative\" with respect to their \"anxiolytic\" activity.", 
    "11": "The systemic injection of diazepam (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg), indorenate (5 and 10 mg/kg) and ipsapirone (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg) reduced anxiety as tested in an exploratory avoidance model in mice. The injection of pindolol (2.0 mg/kg), alprenolol (5.0 mg/kg) or methiotepin (0.25 mg/kg) effectively prevented the anxiolytic action of indorenate and ipsapirone. The combined treatment of the antagonists with indorenate or ipsapirone did not reduce the motor activity, therefore suggesting that the inhibition of exploratory behaviour, after such combinations, was not mediated through a general motor impairment. Neither diazepam nor indorenate alone modified the motor activity; ipsapirone (5 and 2.5 mg/kg), however, reduced ambulation. This reduction was also prevented by administering pindolol, alprenolol or methiotepin. These observations suggest that the anxiolytic actions of indorenate and ipsapirone are mediated via stimulation of the 5-HT1A like receptor subtype.", 
    "12": "There have been few attempts to model subjective symptoms of drug withdrawal using animals as subjects. Two approaches for developing such models are reviewed. First, using drug discrimination methodology, it may be possible to train animals to detect the effects of withdrawal. This method has two difficulties: 1) the only discriminations trained to date involve precipitated withdrawal, and 2) the stimulus controlling behavior is difficult to specify. Second, withdrawal from many drugs of abuse produces the symptom of anxiety, and it seems likely that animal models of anxiety could be useful for studying drug withdrawal. This hypothesis has been explored most fully using subjects trained to detect the discriminative stimulus properties of the putative anxiogenic drug pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). Withdrawal from benzodiazepines or ethanol substitutes fully for PTZ, and withdrawal from cocaine, morphine, and nicotine substitutes partially for PTZ. Emerging data suggest that other animal models of anxiety may also be useful for detecting drug withdrawal. The final portion of this review examines a behavioral test that is very sensitive for detecting physical signs of withdrawal in animals. In subjects maintained on an operant baseline using food as a reinforcer, withdrawal from a drug of dependence frequently is associated with disruption of that operant behavior. For example, tetrahydrocannabinol and cocaine, drugs that are not traditionally seen as having significant withdrawal signs, produce disruption of operant responding when high-dose administration is terminated, and their readministration reverses this behavioral disruption. Based on the observation that withdrawal is associated with anxiogenic stimuli, we suggest a method to determine if disruption of operant behavior may be related to these stimuli.", 
    "13": "The effect of late prenatal exposure to diazepam (DZP) on physical and behavioral development of rat pups was investigated. Prenatal exposure to DZP (20 mg/kg, sc, in last week of pregnancy) did not alter litter size and no gross malformations were noted at birth. Body weight at birth and subsequent weight gain was significantly less in these animals. The development of reflexes and neuromuscular maturation was normal. Open field locomotor activity and rearing scores were significantly decreased. Test of social play in juvenile rats revealed normal pattern of sexual dimorphism with increased masculinized behavior. Acquisition and retention of passive avoidance task was not affected by DZP exposure, however, retention of brightness discrimination task was significantly decreased. The hypnotic effect of a challenge dose of DZP and convulsive effect of pentylene tetrazole remained unaltered. Open field activity test in adult animals revealed increased ambulation. Probe dose of amphetamine in these animals caused paradoxical decrease in activity. It is concluded that exposure to high dose of DZP during late prenatal period may not manifest in physical or neuromuscular impairment during early development period, except for weight loss, however, it may have long term effects on behavior becoming manifest in adolescence and at maturity.", 
    "14": "The current study investigates the action of anxiolytics, antidepressants, neuroleptics, antipyretics, muscle relaxants, antihypertensives and naloxone in a novel animal model of anxiety, based on the evidence that mice removed last from their cage develop hyperthermia (stress-induced hyperthermia, SIH) when compared to those removed first. Alprazolam (0.15-0.6 mg/kg), chlordiazepoxide (25 mg/kg), estazolam (1 mg/kg), phenobarbital (20 mg/kg), ethanol (2 and 4 g/kg), buspirone (5 and 10 mg/kg) and prazosin (1 and 2 mg/kg), as well as repeatedly administered diazepam (5 mg/kg), inhibited SIH. In contrast, tofisopam (12.5-200 mg/kg), desipramine (15 and 30 mg/kg), amitriptyline (10 mg/kg), fluoxetine (10 and 20 mg/kg), tranylcypromine (5 and 10 mg/kg), chlorpromazine (1 and 2 mg/kg), clozapine (2 and 4 mg/kg), pimozide (0.5 and 1 mg/kg), l-sulpiride (15 and 30 mg/kg), l-propranolol (5 and 10 mg/kg), acetyl salicylic acid (200 and 400 mg/kg), indomethacin (2.5 and 5 mg/kg), verapamil (2.5 and 5 mg/kg), captopril (25 and 50 mg/kg), dantrolene (10 and 20 mg/kg), mephenesin (300 and 600 mg/kg), d-amphetamine (1 and 4 mg/kg) and naloxone (2.5 and 15 mg/kg) were inactive, as were 10 mg/kg imipramine, amitriptyline and fluoxetine injected every day for 21 days. Reserpine at high doses (1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg) but not at a lower dose (0.62 mg/kg) prevented SIH, but in this case animals showed a behavioural syndrome which could have interfered with the occurrence of the hyperthermia.", 
    "15": "In a double-blind parallel group design, 80 young adult males were divided into eight treatment groups. Subjects received 15 or 30 mg flurazepam, 0.25 or 0.50 mg triazolam, or placebo at bedtime, and 250 mg caffeine or placebo in the morning for 2 treatment days. Two objective (Multiple Sleep Latency Test and lapses) and two subjective (Stanford Sleepiness Scale and Visual Analog Scale) measures of sleepiness, five performance tests, and two mood measures (Profile of Mood Scale and Visual Analog Mood Scale) were administered repeatedly on both days. Significant treatment effects were found for sleepiness but not for performance or mood. Early morning caffeine significantly antagonized next day hypnotic-induced drowsiness and enhanced alertness in the subjects who received bed-time placebo. Flurazepam, 30 mg, subjects were more sleepy than all other groups. Although not significantly different, the flurazepam, 30 mg, group demonstrated a trend toward poorer performance and a more negative mood than all other groups. Caffeine most improved performance of this group. In all groups, sleepiness was greatest and performance and mood poorest in early morning trials and caffeine was most effective at this time.", 
    "16": "The authors wanted to find answers to the question whether certain benzodiazepines and minor tranquillizers decrease the action of low-dose oral contraceptives due to interaction between these drugs by examining 72 women taking these drugs concurrently. Drug interaction causing pregnancy was not observed. Spotting was observed in an extremely high number of cases taking meprobamate or chlordiazepoxide. In 76.9% of these cases causal relation could be proved by the discontinuance of anxiolytic or by changing to another psychopharmacon.", 
    "17": "Whether commonly prescribed benzodiazepine sedatives or hypnotics interact with low-dose oral contraceptive formulations used in Hungary was explored by recording incidence of breakthrough bleeding in women taking both of these types of drugs. 72 women taking Rigevidon or Anteovin (Chemical Works of Gedeon Richter, Ltd, Budapest) during 1989- 1988, and 1 of 4 benzodiazepines, were followed for 1/2 to 2 cycles. The drugs included: diazepam (Seduxen) 1 to 3 x 5 mg, nitrazepam (Eunoctin) 5-10 mg, chlordiazepoxide (Elenium) 2 to 4 x 5 mg, or meprobamate (Andaxin) 1 - 3 x 200 mg. No pregnancies occurred in 25 (36.1%), usually limited to spotting (30.6%). Most of the bleeding was reported during intake of chlordiazepoxide or meprobamate (23 cases). In 19 of these women, bleeding did not occur in the subsequent cycle when the sedative trioxazin (Ruditel) was substituted, corroborating the interpretation that a drug interaction had occurred with the original agents.", 
    "18": "The benzodiazepines were first introduced in 1960. Chlordiazepoxide (Librium) was the first of the class of drugs called benzodiazepines, in a deliberate attempt to synthesize a tranquilizer without the sedative properties and abuse, addiction, tolerance, and dependence potential of the barbiturates, and other sedative/hypnotic drugs. The popularity of the benzodiazepines rose steadily to a peak period in the mid 1970s when diazepam (Valium) was the most commonly prescribed drug of any kind, including antihypertensive, analgesic and other psychotropic medications. The current evaluations of benzodiazepines use and abuse demonstrate clearly that they produce tolerance and dependence in short and long-term administration. The development of abuse and addiction is also strongly substantiated although they are not as easily appreciated and identified because of confusion in diagnosis and treatment of abuse and addiction. Significant problems in definitions, diagnosis, interpretations and conclusions exist in general practice regarding abuse and addiction, and their relationship to use of and symptoms produced by benzodiazepines. The lack of clarity in defining abuse and addiction and tolerance and dependence in clinical practice leads to institution and perpetuation of the toxicity and untoward effects of the benzodiazepines.",

Samples of blood and CSF were drawn just before insertion of the spinal and the concentration of drug estimated in these two media. The results obtained indicated that a highly significant correlation existed between the unbound concentration of temazepam in plasma and the concentration of drug present in CSF.

Compounds 3d,f and 4b showed high affinities (less than 70 nmol). In the case of 3f the benzodiazepine moiety may be responsible for the affinity. In the GABA-shift test 4b behaves as invers agonists to the benzodiazepine receptor. Further structure-affinity relationships are reported.", 
    "21": "This article reviews special clinical dilemmas inherent in the differential pharmacotherapy of patients with the dual diagnoses of schizophrenia and substance abuse. The author discusses the role of neuroleptic medications in treating the psychotic diathesis, preventing recurrences of schizophrenic symptomatology, counteracting psychotic exacerbations engendered by abused substances, and potentially generating side effects such as akinesia and akathisia that patients may attempt to \"self-medicate\" with substances of abuse. Also addressed are the potential adjunctive roles of antiparkinsonian medications, tricyclic antidepressants, and benzodiazepines in appropriately selected cases, as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions of psychotropic medications and substances of abuse. Throughout the course of these psychopharmacological strategies, the value of psychosocial interventions geared to recognizing and compensating for specific schizophrenic vulnerabilities should be emphasized, as substance abuse is addressed in the context of a complication in the course of schizophrenia.", 
    "22": "Because alcohol is so widely used as a social drug and benzodiazepines are so widely used as therapeutic agents, the number of persons who may be using both drugs concurrently is high. Despite this frequent concurrent use, interactions of major consequence are not common. Major interactions are pharmacodynamic, involving common actions of both drugs as sedatives. Excessive sedation from a combination of both drugs is a most important consideration when driving an automobile. However, it is well known that tolerance develops quickly to the sedative effects of benzodiazepines when used in anxiolytic doses. Also, one must balance the benefit from relief of anxiety versus possible impairment of function from oversedation. Abuse of benzodiazepines is almost exclusively among subjects who also abuse alcohol, doubtless due to the fact that the two drugs show cross-dependence. The clinical practice of avoiding use of benzodiazepines (or other sedative-hypnotics) in known alcoholics is sound and should avoid many potential problems.", 
    "23": "The new programme is developed for the experimental automatization and analysis of animal operant behavior in Skinner's box (Lafayette Instrument Co., USA) by means of the Apple 2e computer (USA). The fundamental of the programme is the division of the training procedure into different functional intervals. Operant behavior of rats is determined by diverse schedules of food and water reinforcement and electric shock. Rats were trained to response on schedules FR 20, FI 1, drug discrimination. Phenazepam (2 mg/kg) markedly decreases the number of responses on schedule FR 20. Phenazepam is a discriminable stimulus. The experimental results make it possible to use the programme for modelling various forms of operant behavior and analysing pharmacological properties of the well-known and new drugs.",

He was found in coma state and suffered from convulsions, that were treated with phenobarbital. The electrocardiogram showed a right bundle branch block and a left anterior hemiblock over 72 h. The child then recovered without sequelae.", 
    "25": "In earlier work REM sleep deprivation (RSD) by arousals improved endogenous depression. This suggested that drugs producing a similar RSD would have antidepressant activity. The arousal RSD was large, persisted for weeks, and was followed by a REM rebound. We call RSD with these properties arousal-type RSD. The present study reviewed literature from 1962 to 1989 on drug REM sleep effects to examine the hypothesis that drugs producing arousal-type RSD improve endogenous depression. The literature reviewed concerned the REM sleep effects of amine precursors, antidepressants, antihistamines, antipsychotics, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, other hypnotics, drugs affecting cholinergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission, ethanol, lithium and narcotics. Four hundred and sixty-eight relevant papers were read and 215 contributed information that could be used in the review. The findings indicated that all drugs producing arousal-type RSD improved endogenous depression. Four drugs that improved endogenous depression did not produce arousal-type RSD.", 
    "26": "Many recent studies have clearly documented the development of tolerance, dependence, and addiction to benzodiazepines. In spite of these studies and reviews of the literature, confusion remains regarding the risk and benefits of the use of benzodiazepines in medical practice. The source of the confusion arises in part from the lack of clarity in the definitions of tolerance, dependence, and addiction. The distinctions among these important terms are frequently obscured in research studies and, especially, in clinical practice. In addition, the practice of separating medical from nonmedical populations in reports of benzodiazepine dependence is misleading. The overlap between medical and nonmedical benzodiazepine users is large, so that many of these individuals fall into both categories. These and other points should be considered as serious questions to the safety and freedom from dependence and addiction in any drug-using population.", 
    "27": "In order to assess the presence of anxiolytic properties in cannabidiol (CBD) the drug was tested in an elevated plus-maze model of anxiety, in rats. Doses of 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg significantly increased the entry ratio (open/total number of entries), an anxiolytic-like effect. CBD at a dose of 20.0 mg/kg was no longer effective. None of the doses of CBD used changed total number of entries, a measure of total exploratory activity. Diazepam (2.0 mg/kg) also caused an anxiolytic-like effect in this model. These results indicate that CBD causes a selective anxiolytic effect in the elevated plus-maze, within a limited range of doses.", 
    "28": "Anxiolytics, particularly the benzodiazepines and barbiturates tend to retard, but not prevent, extinction, promote recovery from negative contrast, and elevate S- responding in discrimination training. Anxiolytics, administered during acquisition, tend to eliminate the partial reinforcement extinction effect, but this result is substantially influenced by parametric considerations. Behaviors that are energized in extinction may have a different pharmacological profile than behaviors that decline. Conclusions regarding the effects of antidepressants must be more tentative but, in general, acutely administered antidepressants are relatively ineffective in all of these paradigms. However, antidepressants may enhance the efficiency of responding on DRL schedules whereas anxiolytics tend to disrupt such behavior.", 
    "29": "From three general practices, served by 11 principals, 205 long-term benzodiazepine users were identified and matched for age and sex with controls. Benzodiazepine users had significantly higher rates of previous physical illness, consultation and non-psychotropic drug consumption than controls. The characteristics of those receiving prescriptions for benzodiazepine hypnotics alone, anxiolytics alone and anxiolytics plus hypnotics were also investigated. Significant differences emerged between these three groups. Patients receiving hypnotics only were older, had a history of more physical illness and had received more non-psychotropic medication than patients receiving anxiolytics only. The anxiolytic plus hypnotic group had previously received more hypnotics and were currently receiving more medication than the group receiving anxiolytics alone. The results are discussed in relation to current concerns about benzodiazepine dependence and withdrawal.", 
    "30": "Bromazepam was compared with placebo and with chlorprothixene in a randomized, double-blind group-comparative multicenter trial in general practice. Two hundred and forty-five patients with generalized anxiety disorder (DSM-III 1980) were treated for 2 weeks with two daily doses of bromazepam, 3 mg or chlorprothixene, 15 mg or placebo. Median reductions in Hamilton Anxiety rating were 12 (bromazepam), 10.3 (chlorprothixene) and 7.3 (placebo). The study revealed significant superiority of bromazepam over placebo (median differences 3.3, 95% confidence limits: 0.3 and 6.1) but not over chlorprothixene (median difference 1.4, 95% confidence limits -0.8 and +3.5). Significantly higher rates of tiredness, sedation and hypersomnia were found on bromazepam and chlorprothixene compared to placebo. Tolerance was rated as \"at least good\" in 85.6% on bromazepam, in 86% on chlorprothixene and in 87.8% on placebo. Neither previous psychopharmacological treatment nor presence of psychosocial stress were of perceptible influence. Bromazepam and chlorprothixene are both superior to placebo in generalized anxiety states treated in general practice, but spontaneous improvements/placebo effects are substantial.", 
    "31": "The Maudsley Reactive (MR/Har) and Non-Reactive (MNRA/Har) rat strains, bred originally by Broadhurst for differences in Open Field Defecation, also differ in their control (i.e., non-drug) behavior in the Conditioned Suppression of Drinking (CSD) conflict procedure, a second \"model\" behavior for the study of anxiety and/or emotionality in rats. The present studies compared the effects of diazepam and alprazolam on CSD behavior in these two strains of rats. In daily 10-min sessions, water-deprived rats were trained to drink from a tube that was occasionally electrified (0.2-0.5 mA), electrification being signaled by a tone. Both diazepam and alprazolam increased punished responding in a dose-related manner. The per cent increase in punished responding (for diazepam only) was comparable in the two strains; however, both statistical and empirical approaches indicated that the magnitude of the anti-conflict effect of benzodiazepines in MNRA/Har versus MR/Har rats was not related to differences in baseline (i.e., non-drug) punished responding. Based on the absolute change in shocks received, rats of the MNRA/Har strain exhibited a significantly greater anti-conflict effect following diazepam or alprazolam treatment than did rats of the MR/Har strain. These findings further the hypothesis that the behavioral differences exhibited by Maudsley MR/Har and MNRA/Har rat strains may constitute a genetically-based \"animal model\" for the study of emotionality and/or anxiety.", 
    "32": "The anticonvulsant BW A78U, tested in a free mouse exploratory situation, reduced in a dose-dependent fashion the locomotion and the number of rearings, this sedative effect being significant up to a dose of 15 mg/kg (IP, 20 min before testing). In an unconditioned conflict test, the light/dark box choice situation, specific for anxiolytics, low doses of BW A78U increased the time spent by mice in the lit box as well as the number of transitions between the two boxes. Finally, we demonstrated that this drug was able to protect mice against pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsions. Our data show that BW A78U possesses some of the characteristic properties of the minor tranquilizers. However, since this compound binds to the benzodiazepine receptor with a very low affinity (IC50 = 13.6 microM), it can be assumed that this drug does not exert its behavioral effects through these receptors. It may interfere with other targets involving adenosine, another potent physiological regulator of neuronal excitability.", 
    "33": "Quazepam is a benzodiazepine hypnotic that can be useful in the adjunctive pharmacologic treatment of insomnia. It is slowly eliminated due to the long elimination half-lives of the parent compound and its two active metabolites, 2-oxoquazepam and N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam. This drug is recommended in doses of 15 mg for adults and 7.5 mg for geriatric patients. Sleep laboratory studies and clinical trials have shown that the 15 mg dose is quite efficacious for inducing and maintaining sleep not only with initial and short-term use but also with continued use. The 7.5 mg dose which has been studied less extensively has also been shown to be effective for inducing and maintaining sleep. There is considerable evidence of carryover effectiveness both during drug administration and after withdrawal. Thus, rebound phenomena are not observed during administration (early morning insomnia and daytime anxiety) and after withdrawal (rebound insomnia). Furthermore, certain behavioral side effects that have occurred with certain benzodiazepines (triazolam) have not been reported with quazepam. The only notable side effect seen with quazepam is a variable degree of daytime sedation, which can be minimized by intermittent use of the 15 mg dose when necessary and use of the 7.5 mg dose in the elderly. In comparison to triazolam and temazepam, quazepam is more effective with short-term use, and with continued use it maintains its efficacy in contrast to both of these drugs which show rapid development of tolerance. Most important, quazepam lacks the frequent and severe side effects increasingly reported with triazolam use or following its withdrawal.", 
    "34": "In a recent epidemiological study of 249 opiate addicts in the State of Penang, Malaysia, the use of benzodiazepines, its temporal relationship to opiate addiction and the reasons for use of benzodiazepines were examined. Just over a half of the opiate addicts indicated use of benzodiazepines in their lifetime. Use of 7 different benzodiazepines was reported, among them flunitrazepam most frequently. A substantial proportion had discontinued the use of benzodiazepines after initial experimentation. Just over a quarter had used them in the last 24 hours. Benzodiazepine use starts on average 3 to 6 years later than heroin use. The most common reason cited for benzodiazepine use was to enhance the feeling of 'high' from the opiates. These findings can be explained, at least partly, by economic factors. Reasons that could be qualified as attempts to autotherapy did not exceed 20%. None of the opiate addicts had reported isolated benzodiazepine use for fun and pleasure. From the time course of use as well as from the reasons given by the addicts, it is evident that benzodiazepines are not primary drugs of abuse. Comparing their figures from Malaysia with figures from Germany and England the authors cannot explain the preferred use of flunitrazepam by Malaysian addicts by the existence of special properties of this substance.", 
    "35": "In order to investigate the present use of anticholinergic drugs in premedication, a questionnaire was sent to Finnish anaesthesiologists. The results indicate that there is significant variation between different parts of the country regarding the usage of these drugs. A decrease in routine use has taken place over the past 5 years. Half of the anaesthesiologists now routinely use anticholinergic drugs in premedication, while 69% were using them 5 years ago. Glycopyrrolate has gained popularity and was the most used drug. Most anaesthesiologists gave the anticholinergic premedication intravenously, briefly before induction.", 
    "36": "1. Neurobehavioral survey of inverse agonist FG 7142 was performed employing a novel anxiety paradigm namely FR-2 Two-Way crossover in a shuttle box. 2. FG syndrome was found to be similar to learned helplessness following shock treatment. Significant increase in mean latency to escape was observed from 0 to 25th trial. Effect of FG 7142 on the behavioral and neurological profile did not deviate significantly from controls. However, a general increase in arousal, darting and sideway movement (weaving) of the head were noted. 3. Drugs with specificity at benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor site were employed as pretreatments in order to study their influence on FG 7142 induced anxiety syndrome. Diazepam and ZK 91296, significantly blocked the inverse agonist response. Head weaving as well as darting movements were completely abolished although rats demonstrated arousal and vigilance. 4. A dose dependent inhibition of FG response was observed with RO 15-1788, a specific BDZ receptor blocker. ZK 93423 at low doses (1 mg/kg) failed to reverse the escape deficit induced by FG. Higher doses of ZK 93423 could not be tested as significant sedation and ataxia were noted. 5. It is suggested that a careful combination of a BDZ agonist and inverse agonist may be beneficial in the treatment of generalised anxiety disorders.", 
    "37": "From 1976 to 1980, there were 3,193 admissions due to acute drug overdosage at the resuscitation centre of the Rudolf-Virchow-Hospital, Free University of Berlin. The frequency and the characteristics of selfpoisoning with antidepressants and low-potency neuroleptic drugs (mainly perazine and thioridazine) were determined. These drugs were involved in 92 cases (3%) during this five-year period. Amitriptyline--in combination with a benzodiazepine--was the most common antidepressant taken by the patients. Ten of the patients required assisted ventilation. Complete ECG recordings were carried out in 24 patients. The most common abnormality was a prolonged QTc interval (21 patients) followed by a QRS duration of 0.11 seconds or longer (17 patients). Sinus tachycardia was present in half of the cases. In no cases did the medical records describe convulsions or cardiac arrhythmias requiring special treatment. The percentage of patients showing ECG changes and respiratory depression was higher when other drugs such as ethanol were ingested along with antidepressants than when only antidepressants were taken. One patient died after six weeks in hospital due to a complicated abscess. From 1976 to 1980, the incidence of antidepressant selfpoisoning was relatively low compared with findings from other studies. Data from other studies suggest that, in the period 1980-1987, there was an increase in the incidence of antidepressant selfpoisoning, at least in the West Berlin and Munich areas. However, these figures are much lower than those reported by British, American, and Australian authors.", 
    "38": "Despite the fact that dipotassium chlorazepate (DC) is widely used for oral premedication there are few studies demonstrating the effects of this drug reliably in the preoperative patient. Therefore, we investigated the influence of DC on preoperative sleep, stress and postoperative pain, which is presumed to be influenced by the long-acting anxiolytic property of DC compared to a placebo in a double-blind study. Sixty patients undergoing dental surgery received either 20 mg DC or a placebo in the evening and at 7 o'clock in the morning before the operation, both administered orally. The quality of sleep, preoperative anxiety, depression, asthenia and postoperative pain were assessed, using nominal and visual analogous scales. The degree of sedation and the quality of premedication were assessed by the anesthesiologist. Blood pressure and heart rate were registered and interpreted as physiological stress parameters. The 2 groups were comparable with respect to the anthropometric data as well as the initial values of all other parameters. Patients receiving DC reported significantly better quality of sleep in the night before the operation. There was no difference between DC and P concerning preoperative stress either emotionally or physiologically. The postoperative pain intensity did not differ between the two groups. The quality of premedication, assessed by the observer, was comparable in both groups. Whereas DC has a positive effect on the quality of sleep in preoperative patients, it does not influence the preoperative stress on the day of operation. This might be dose-dependent, but 20 mg is recommended for premedication.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "39": "Chlordiazepoxide (CDP 7.5 mg/kg) had a significant anxiolytic effect in rats tested on the plus-maze for the first time. On a second trial the control scores did not change, but those of the CDP group did and they no longer differed from controls. Rats previously tested undrugged or after flumazenil (4 mg/kg) also failed to show an anxiolytic response to CDP. Thus this phenomenon of one-trial tolerance depended on prior experience with the plus-maze. It also depended on CDP acting at the benzodiazepine receptors on trial 2, since the joint administration of CDP and flumazenil on trial 2 reversed the phenomenon.", 
    "40": "We performed a study on 141 pediatric patients between 6 months and 7 years of age who underwent scheduled radical operation for inguinal hernia, to evaluate bromazepam suppository and chloral hydrate suppository as anesthetic premedication for short pediatric operations. The study was also focused on the difference of the effects of the two drugs between two age groups: younger than 5 years, and 5 years and older. The younger age group required a larger bromazepam dose compared with the older age group, and in the younger group even the larger bromazepam dose did not produce a high sedative effect as chloral hydrate. In the older group, bromazepam and chloral hydrate were equally effective. In respect to emergence from anesthesia, bromazepam delayed emergence compared with chloral hydrate after which children awoke from anesthesia very clearly. Thus, chloral hydrate suppository seemed more useful as premedicants in short pediatric operations for its high sedative effect without affecting emergence.", 
    "41": "1. Electrophysiological and lesion studies have suggested that a number of specific sites in the brainstem and basal forebrain may be involved in the regulation of sleep and waking. In contrast, a study of glucose consumption as measured by the 2-deoxyglucose technique reported a generalized decrease in nonREM sleep compared to waking. The rate of protein synthesis was relatively unchanged in nonREM sleep. 2. Another approach to understanding sleep regulation is to study the mechanism by which hypnotic drugs affect the nervous system. This may be done at both a molecular and neuroanatomic level. Studies with B-carbolines, inverse agonists of benzodiazepines (BZs), indicate that sleep induction by BZs is mediated by binding at the BZ recognition site of the BZ receptor complex. Binding at this site by a long-acting B-carboline parallels the time course of its arousing effects. A study with an enantiomeric BZ indicates that the effects on sleep are stereospecific. It is conceivable that some inverse agonists or enantiomeric benzodiazepines might be developed for clinical use as analeptics. 3. Microinjection of a BZ into the dorsal raphe nucleus acutely increases wakefulness, while administration into the medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus enhances sleep maintenance.", 
    "42": "Multiple drug use occurs in alcoholics in an age-dependent relationship. The younger the onset of alcoholism, the more likely is additional drug use. Drugs used by alcoholics, in decreasing order of frequency, are marijuana, cocaine, and other stimulants, phencyclidine, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and hallucinogens. Evaluation of intoxication and treatment or detoxification in alcoholics should always include consideration of other drugs. Multiple drug use in alcoholics does not preclude the short- or long-term treatment that traditionally is available for alcoholics, such as programmatic treatment and AA and NA and psychotherapy. The existence of poly-drug addiction in alcoholics and of alcohol dependence in families of drug addicts and alcoholics suggest a common genetic vulnerability to alcoholism and drug addiction.", 
    "43": "The selective opioid mu receptor agonist dermorphin increased the locomotor activity of rats dose dependently at 10 to 100 pmol/kg i.c.v. Respiratory rate, relative tidal volume and respiratory minute volume also increased unrelated to changes in locomotor activity. Higher doses, on the other hand, produced catalepsy and respiratory depression. Pretreatment of the rats with the mu1-selective antagonist naloxonazine (10 mg/kg i.v.) blocked the stimulant locomotor and respiratory effects of low doses of dermorphin (10-100 pmol/kg), but potentiated the respiratory depressant effect of a high dose (10 nmol/kg) of dermorphin. The selective benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (5 mg/kg), which has been shown previously to antagonize catalepsy and respiratory depression produced by relatively high doses of dermorphin, did not antagonize the respiratory or locomotor stimulant effect of dermorphin. The data suggest that mu1-opioid receptors are responsible for the low dose stimulant effects of dermorphin on locomotor activity and respiration whereas mu2 receptors mediate the respiratory depressant effect of dermorphin.", 
    "44": "1. Blood pressure regulation was studied in 12 healthy elderly subjects after double-blind randomised administration of placebo, 15 mg and 30 mg temazepam at 10.00 h and 22.00 h. 2. Supine and standing heart rate and blood pressure were measured after daytime administration and supine measurements were obtained during sleep. 3. Temazepam caused a fall in systolic blood pressure and an increase in heart rate after morning administration. These changes were greater in the standing position and were dose-dependent; for standing blood pressure and heart rate 1 h after administration there was a 7 mm Hg fall and 6 beats min-1 increase after 15 mg temazepam and a 10 mm Hg fall and 8 beats min-1 increase after 30 mg temazepam. Temazepam magnified the fall in systolic blood pressure and increase in heart rate that occurred with standing. Temazepam enhanced the fall in systolic blood pressure that occurred during sleep (mean +/- s.d.; placebo: -23 +/- 10 mm Hg, 15 mg temazepam: -31 +/- 13 mm Hg, 30 mg temazepam: -36 +/- 14 mm Hg). 4. These changes in blood pressure regulation caused by temazepam may have clinical importance in some elderly individuals.", 
    "45": "A series of 8-substituted analogues of 9-(3-aminobenzyl)-6-(dimethylamino)-9H-purine (8) were synthesized and tested for their ability to bind to the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) in rat brain tissue. The most active compound was the 8-bromo-9-(3-formamidobenzyl) analogue 16 (IC50 = 0.011 microM), which was 1000-fold more active than the parent 9-benzyl-6-(dimethylamino)-9H-purine (1) and nearly as active as diazepam. Although substitution of a m-formamido group and an 8-bromo substituent on 1 imparted potent BZR binding activity, neither 16 nor 11 analogues exhibited significant anxiolytic activity on a modified Geller-Seifter conflict schedule.", 
    "46": "Several classes of medications have been used to treat generalized anxiety disorders (GAD). Antidepressants are useful for chronic subpanic anxiety and anxiety associated with depression. Benzodiazepines are generally safe, but recent research suggests that the incidence of chronic abstinence syndromes may be higher than has been suspected. This class of medications is best used for circumscribed periods of time. Because buspirone has no significant interactions, it does not prevent benzodiazepine withdrawal and cannot be directly substituted for this class of medications. beta-Blockers are used when cardiovascular symptoms and tremor are prominent, for stage fright (propranolol) and possibly for social phobia (atenolol). Antihistamines have been used for elderly patients and for those with a history of substance abuse. Neuroleptics should only be prescribed for anxiety associated with psychosis, psychotic and possibly severe depression, and borderline personality disorder. Drug treatment of GAD should be used as part of a comprehensive treatment plan that includes assessment for medical illnesses that can aggravate anxiety, withdrawal of all unnecessary medications (especially CNS depressants) and caffeine, structured relaxation techniques, evaluation of the specific type of anxiety, and psychotherapy.", 
    "47": "Anxiety disorders are chronic illnesses requiring long-term treatment. Relapse is typical and should not be considered treatment failure. Although the general guiding principle of pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders--the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time--remains, this rule should not interfere with the judicious use of medications as long as the benefits justify it. Although most antianxiety drugs are safe and have no long-term side effects, periodic drug discontinuation should be attempted. Establishing a secure and specific diagnosis and ruling out concomitant psychiatric and medical illnesses will augment the success of pharmacotherapy. The efficacy of nonpharmacologic treatments alone is, with very few exceptions, unsubstantiated at present; however, nonpharmacologic techniques may well supplement medication trials. Based on these principles and on the available data, specific recommendations are given for treating patients with generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social phobia, and obsessive compulsive disorder.",

    "49": "The specific benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) (Ro) was given in a double-blind study to 40 adult orthopaedic patients in order to determine if it shortens the immediate recovery time after benzodiazepine-fentanyl anaesthesia. On the evening before operation the patients were premedicated orally with 1-2 mg of flunitrazepam and 30 min before the induction of anaesthesia with 7.5 mg midazolam. Induction of anaesthesia was carried out with flunitrazepam 0.03-0.04 mg.kg-1 and fentanyl 0.1 mg IV. Anaesthesia was maintained with fentanyl (5.9 microgram.kg-1.h-1) and nitrous oxide. After the reversal of muscle relaxation, 20 patients received a placebo and 20 patients Ro, as boluses up to 10 ml, until the effect of awakening was noticed. The dose of Ro (0.1 mg.ml-1) required was 6.8 +/- 2.9 micrograms.kg-1 and that of placebo 10 +/- 0 ml. Patients given Ro woke up faster than patients given placebo. Ro patients were more alert than patients given placebo until 120 min after the injection or the test drug. After this patients in both groups behaved similarly. Eight patients given Ro and one given placebo showed some mild adverse reaction for 5-60 min after the administration of Ro or placebo (e.g., nausea, shivering). This study indicates that flumazenil speeds up awakening after benzodiazepine-fentanyl anaesthesia.",

This article reviews: 1) The factors involved in selective distribution of stereoisomers: first-pass effect, binding to plasma proteins, enzyme effect and membrane transport; 2) the distinction between pharmacologic specific receptors and acceptor sites; recognition of stereoisomer ligands by specific receptors of opioids, neuroamines, steroids; 3) the ligands labeled with positron emitter radionuclides useful for tomography: dopaminergic, opiate, serotonergic, benzodiazepine ligands and muscarinic ligands; these ligands are labeled with 11C, 18F or 75Br. The balance between the benefit of using a stereoisomer and the burden of sophistication in its chemical preparation is discussed. In conclusion, there is not a clearcut position in favor of a systematic choice of an enantiomer radiopharmaceutical.", 
    "51": "The characterization of neuroreceptor functions in the living human brain has hitherto been hampered by the lack of techniques useful for the measurement of physiologic events within the human brain in vivo. Recent developments in positron emission tomography (PET) has allowed the quantitative tracing of intravenously administered molecules within tissue compartments of the brain. Using ligands binding with high affinity to cerebral neuroreceptors it has been possible to examine not only the distribution but also some quantitative aspects of brain neuroreceptors in living human subjects by the PET technique. By the selection of highly selective ligands for different receptor systems and by labeling them with positron emitting isotopes as 11C or 18F, methods have been developed for the characterization of receptor subtypes for the endogenous ligands dopamine, serotonin, opiates, acetylcholine, glutamate and GABA. The present communication describes the use of 11C-SCH 23390 and 11C-raclopride for the analysis of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors, the benzodiazepine (BZ) antagonist 11C-Ro 15-1788 for benzodiazepine receptors and 11C-nicotine for nicotine receptors. Specificity of binding was verified by using active and inactive stereoenantiomers of the ligands. After the intravenous administration of the ligands quantitative aspects of the receptor binding was calculated using models according to equilibrium or dynamic approaches. Bmax and Kd values for D2 dopamine and BZ receptors could be determined in the brain of healthy human subjects and patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. No alteration of D2 dopamine receptors in the major basal ganglia were found in drug naive schizophrenic patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "It has been reported that dipyridamole, an adenosine uptake inhibitor, and some benzodiazepines potentiate the responses to adenosine in peripheral organs and in particular, on guinea-pig isolated atria. In this paper, we have examined the potentiation of responses to adenosine produced by dipyridamole, diazepam and four compounds with selective agonistic activity towards the central (clonazepam) or peripheral (Ro5-4864) type benzodiazepine receptors or antagonistic activity towards the central (flumazenil) or peripheral (PK 11195) benzodiazepine receptors in guinea-pig trachea in vitro. In preparations under basal tone and in the absence of adenosine, dipyridamole (10(-5) M) and benzodiazepines (10(-4) M) with the exception of flumazenil induced a relaxation of the airway smooth muscle. In addition, diazepam (10(-4) M) attenuated the phasic response to histamine (10(-5) M). Dipyridamole, and the benzodiazepine agonists diazepam, Ro5-4864 and clonazepam (10(-5) to 10(-4) M) produced potentiation of the tracheal response to adenosine, the rank order of potency being dipyridamole (pKi = 7.77 +/- 0.12, n = 8) greater than Ro5-4864 (pKi = 5.43 +/- 0.18, n = 6) greater than or equal to diazepam greater than clonazepam (pKi = 4.84 +/- 0.11, n = 6). The two benzodiazepine receptor antagonists, flumazenil and PK 11195, gave a significant but small potentiation to adenosine only at 10(-4) M. In the presence of dipyridamole (10(-5) M), diazepam (10(-4) M) did not cause any further potentiation to adenosine. Additionally, the potentiation produced by diazepam was not antagonised by flumazenil, whereas it was potently antagonised by PK 11195. Similarly, PK 11195 potently inhibited the adenosine potentiation produced by Ro5-4864.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "53": "Spectral analysis was performed to study the response of various EEG sleep activities to a modification of GABAergic sleep regulation by flunitrazepam. We observed sleep stage- and sleep cycle-dependent differences in the topographic distribution of the reactions. An increase in power density was found in the frontal regions for the alpha 2 and sigma 1 frequency band whereas a decrease in power density was emphasized in the posterior regions for the delta and alpha 1 frequency band. These topographic differences might be related to the regional distribution of benzodiazepine receptor subtypes.", 
    "54": "The effect of increasing serum estradiol levels on platelet [3H]PK 11195 binding was investigated to determine the influence of gonadal steroids on platelet peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites. Serum estradiol and platelet [3H]PK 11195 binding were determined in 10 anovulatory, but otherwise healthy women before and after treatment with human menopausal gonadotropin. Despite a 30-fold increase in posttreatment estradiol, the kinetic parameters of platelet [3H]PK 11195 binding (Kd, Bmax) remained essentially unchanged. These data indicate that peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites on platelets are not influenced by elevated concentrations of estradiol. Thus, it is suggested that variations in circulating levels of this female gonadal steroid are likely not responsible for the modifications in platelet peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites seen in association with various disease states.", 
    "55": "Evidence compatible with increased GABAergic tone contributing to the manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in animal models of fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) includes: (i) increased resistance to drugs which induce seizures by reducing GABAergic tone; (ii) abnormalities of visual evoked responses (VERs) which resemble those induced by drugs which augment GABAergic tone; (iii) increased sensitivity of CNS neurons to a GABA agonist; and (iv) ameliorations of the encephalopathy induced by a GABA receptor antagonist. Evidence compatible with a benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor ligand with agonist properties contributing to increased GABAergic tone in animal models of FHF includes: (i) abnormalities of VERs which resemble those in BZ agonist-induced coma; (ii) increased sensitivity of CNS neurons to a BZ receptor agonist; (iii) excitation of CNS neurons induced by BZ receptor antagonists; (iv) reversal of the increased sensitivity of CNS neurons to a GABA agonist by a BZ receptor antagonist; (v) presence of a ligand(s) in brain which displaces a radiolabeled ligand from BZ receptors; and (vi) increased affinity of this ligand(s) for BZ receptors in the presence of GABA (\"positive GABA shift\").", 
    "56": "Treatment of pregnant Long Evans rats with a low dose of diazepam (1.25 mg/kg from gestational day 14-20) produced offspring suffering from suppression of cellular immune responses. Analogous effects were produced by clonazepam, a benzodiazepine (BDZ) with high affinity for the central-type, and Ro 5-4864, a BDZ with selective affinity for the peripheral-type BDZ receptor. Peripheral-type BDZ receptors are found to develop early in fetal life in peripheral organs including primary (thymus) and secondary (spleen) lymphoid organs, in the central nervous system and on immune cells (lymphocytes). In prenatally diazepam-exposed offspring the affinity constant is significantly changed. BDZ and PK 11195 also inhibit mitogen and alloantigen-induced T and B cell proliferation in vitro in adult murine lymphocytes. Diazepam, Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195 were found to be the most active compounds.", 
    "57": "123I-Iomazenil SPECT was performed in 17 patients who were considered candidates for surgery of epilepsy because of medically intractable complex partial seizures. In addition to this examination their presurgical evaluation consisted of long term ictal EEG-CCTV monitoring, CT, MRI and 18FDG PET. In eight patients intracranial ictal EEG recordings were performed. SPECT was assessed visually while PET data were analyzed quantitatively. Both SPECT and PET were compared to ictal EEG data and showed asymmetries in over 80% of patients in agreement with EEG findings. These three methods were in agreement in 65% of patients. SPECT showed abnormality contralateral to the EEG focus in one patient (6%) while PET always demonstrated ipsilateral dysfunction. It is concluded that 123I-Iomazenil SPECT may be considered a more economical and more widely available alternative to 18FDG PET in the presurgical evaluation of patients with medically intractable complex partial seizures. In this respect 123I-Iomazenil specifically reflects functional changes in the membranes of neurons while 18FDG is related to glucose metabolism not only of neurons but also of glial cells.", 
    "58": "The following receptors were assessed post-mortem in the hippocampi (anterior region) of eight patients with Alzheimer's disease and nine age-matched controls, using autoradiography: N-methyl-D-aspartate (including glutamate, phencyclidine and glycine binding sites), quisqualate, kainic acid, adenosine A1, benzodiazepine, serotonin (1 and 2), muscarinic cholinergic, beta-adrenergic, neurotensin and opioid receptors. In CA1 there were significant parallel losses of binding to the three N-methyl-D-aspartate-linked sites (average reduction 46%) and also losses of quisqualate (38%) and serotonin2 (58%) receptor binding, with a 47% loss of binding to A1 sites. Binding to all of these receptors was also reduced in CA3 (except binding to A1 sites which was normal) but only the serotonin2 receptor binding loss reached significance (52%). A significant reduction in binding was also observed in the entorhinal area to the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-linked sites (average reduction = 39%), benzodiazepine (40%) and serotonin2 receptors (45%), and there was a loss of binding to neurotensin (57%) and opioid receptors (42%). Significant reductions in the dentate gyrus molecular layer were seen for serotonin2 receptors (44%), and binding to opioid (44%) and A1 receptors (46%). Levels of ligand binding to muscarinic cholinergic, serotonin1, beta-adrenergic and kainic acid receptors were not significantly different from control values in any of the four areas examined. These results provide support for observations of selective receptor changes in Alzheimer's disease involving a broad range of receptor types which encompass both excitatory amino acid and other receptors (notably serotonin2, A1, benzodiazepine, neurotensin and opioid receptors). The implications of the pattern of receptor changes for the suggestion that excitotoxicity plays a role in the disease are discussed, as is the possible contribution of the receptor changes to the symptomatology of Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "59": "The effects of benzodiazepine receptor agonists on the electrical activity of red nucleus (RN) and neocortex were studied in rabbits. Under basal conditions, 30-40 microV, 40-50 Hz waves were recorded in RN. An increase of the amplitude (Emax, 75-90 microV) was found after IV injection of flunitrazepam (ED50, 0.14 mg/kg), diazepam (ED50, 0.28 mg/kg), alpidem (ED50, 1.57 mg/kg) and zolpidem (ED50, 0.73 mg/kg). Clonazepam (ED50, 0.12 mg/kg) and Cl 218,872 (ED50, 0.63 mg/kg) were less effective. In contrast, 2-10-fold higher doses were required to induce a slight decrease of the frequency. At the level of the cortex all benzodiazepine agonists induced synchronization and spindles. The effects of diazepam (5 mg/kg IV) in both areas were antagonized by flumazenil (0.04 mg/kg IV) and bicuculline (0.2 mg/kg IV). Pentamethylentetrazole (10-30 mg/kg IV) selectively abated the effect at the level of the cortex, whereas both clonazepam (2 mg/kg IV) and beta-CCM (0.6 mg/kg IV) selectively suppressed only the effects on the RN. These results suggest that activation of benzodiazepine receptor mainly influences the RN waves amplitude. The efficacy in increasing the amplitude appears related to the reported relative efficacy of the compound in potentiating GABA responses. The possibility exists that these effects are dependent upon the partial or full agonist action of the drugs or upon their binding at distinct benzodiazepine receptor types.", 
    "60": "The present study was designed to explore the nature of the interaction between mu and kappa opioid agonists in the rat drug discrimination procedure. In rats trained to discriminate the kappa agonist U50,488 (5.6 mg/kg) from water, the other kappa agonist bremazocine substituted completely for the U50,488 training stimulus, and the additional kappa agonist tifluadom substituted in three of five of rats tested. In contrast, the mu agonists morphine, fentanyl, and buprenorphine produced primarily vehicle-appropriate responding. When morphine, fentanyl, and buprenorphine were combined with the training dose of U50,488, all three mu agonists reduced U50,488-appropriate responding. In rats trained to discriminate the mu agonist morphine (10.0 mg/kg) from saline, the other mu agonists morphine and buprenorphine all substituted in a dose-dependent manner for the morphine training stimulus, whereas U50,488, bremazocine, and tifluadom produced primarily vehicle-appropriate responding. When combined with the training dose of morphine, bremazocine antagonized morphine's discriminative stimulus effects, whereas U50,488 and tifluadom had no effect. The barbiturate pentobarbital neither substituted for, nor antagonized, the discriminative stimulus effects of either U50,488 or morphine. These results suggest that mu agonists and kappa agonists produce interacting effects in the drug discrimination procedure in rats.", 
    "61": "The effect of Ro 19-4603, a novel potent partial inverse agonist of benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors, on voluntary ethanol intake was examined in a rat line selectively bred for ethanol preference (Sardinian ethanol preferring, sP, rats). Ro 19-4603, 1 mg/kg i.p., three times daily, reduced voluntary ethanol consumption by about 40% during 7 days of treatment, but failed to reduce water intake. The results suggest that the GABA/BZ receptor complex may play a role in the reinforcing property of ethanol.", 
    "62": "The regional, cellular and subcellular distribution of GABA, GABA receptors and benzodiazepine receptors was investigated by light and electron microscopy in the human lumbar spinal cord taken post-mortem from eight cases aged 20-76 years. Firstly, the regional distribution of GABA receptors and benzodiazepine receptors was studied using autoradiography following in vitro labelling of cryostat sections with tritiated ligands. This was followed by a detailed study of the cellular and subcellular distribution and localization of GABA and benzodiazepine/GABAA receptors by light and electron microscopy using immunohistochemical techniques with monoclonal antibodies to GABA and to the alpha and beta subunits of the benzodiazepine/GABAA receptor complex. The results showed a close correspondence in the regional distributions of GABA, GABA (GABAA and GABAB) receptors and benzodiazepine receptors. The highest density of GABA-like immunoreactivity, GABA receptors and benzodiazepine receptors was localized as a dense band within lamina II of the dorsal horn (especially inner lamina II) with moderately high densities in laminae I and III. The remaining laminae of the spinal gray matter showed much lower levels of labelling. A close correspondence was also seen in the distribution of GABA-like immunoreactivity and of benzodiazepine/GABAA receptor immunoreactivity at the cellular and subcellular levels. At the cellular level, the greatest number of GABA-immunoreactive cells was found in lamina II; they comprised small, round to oval cells and, on the basis of soma size, shape, orientation and dendromorphology, they corresponded to previously described islet and filamentous cells. Benzodiazepine/GABAA receptor immunoreactivity was also localized on the same cell types in lamina II. At the subcellular level in lamina II, GABA-immunoreactive axon terminals mainly established axodendritic synaptic contacts. Small numbers of GABA-immunoreactive axon terminals appear to form possible axo-axonic contacts in complex synaptic arrays. Benzodiazepine/GABAA receptors were localized within the same types of synaptic complexes in which GABA-immunoreactive axon terminals were found. In these synaptic complexes, benzodiazepine/GABAA receptor immunoreactivity was associated with presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes and on apparent non-synaptic membranes. These results show a high concentration of GABA, GABA receptors and benzodiazepine receptors in lamina II of the dorsal horn of the human spinal cord and suggest a possible role for GABA in spinal sensory functions.", 
    "63": "The benzodiazepine receptor (BZDR) of the embryonic chick brain contained three subunit proteins with molecular weights of 48-kilodalton (KD), 50-KD and 51-KD at a pI of 5.6, as demonstrated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and fluorography of the 3H-flunitrazepam (FNZ)-photolabeled receptor. Monoclonal antibodies (mAB) against the receptor were produced by using the spleen cells of one mouse immunized with the three subunit proteins extracted from SDS-PAGE gels. When the radioligand-labeled membranes were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting using the mAB 2C3, both 50-KD and 51-KD bands with a pI of 5.6 were immunoreactive and radioactive. Thus, the mAB 2C3 recognized a common epitope on the 50-KD and 51-KD subunits of the BZDR. In addition, the mAB 2C3 was used with immunocytochemistry to determine the distribution of the receptor in the chick embryo brain. The BZDR immunoreactivity was observed among various brain areas, including hippocampus, optic tectum and cerebellum. The reaction product was localized in the neuronal membranes and cytoplasm. Certain neurons in the culture derived from embryonic chick brains were also immunoreactive as detected by immunocytochemical staining.", 
    "64": "Rats treated chronically with diazepam develop tolerance to diazepam effects and show changes in sensitivity of GABAergic systems. In order to investigate possible molecular mechanisms associated with these changes, we have evaluated the effects of acute and chronic diazepam treatment on levels of mRNA for the alpha 1 and beta 1 subunits of the GABAA receptor. Northern blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled GABA alpha 1 and beta 1 cDNA probes, and resulting bands were quantified by autoradiography and densitometry. Levels of alpha 1 mRNA were significantly decreased in cerebral cortex but not in cerebellum or hippocampus of chronic diazepam-treated rats. Acute diazepam treatment did not change levels of alpha 1 mRNA in any of the brain regions. Levels of beta 1 mRNA were examined by Northern blot analysis and also by solution hybridization analysis using a 32P-labeled riboprobe. Both methods showed that beta 1 mRNA was not significantly changed by chronic diazepam treatment. These results demonstrate a specific change in alpha 1 subunit that is associated with a state of altered GABA sensitivity and provide further support for the regional heterogeneity of chronic diazepam effects.", 
    "65": "1. Recent neurochemical investigations have enhanced our understanding of the anxiety disorders. Emphasis has been placed on dysfunction in central benzodiazepine, serotonergic and noradrenergic systems. 2. Changes in activity of endogenous ligands for the benzodiazepine receptor or in benzodiazepine receptor sensitivity appear to modulate anxiety. 3. There is evidence of serotonergic involvement in anxiety, in that serotonin agonists may increase anxiety, whilst drugs that reduce serotonin function are anxiolytic. 4. Noradrenergic dysfunction, especially that of alpha-2-adrenoceptors, provides the strongest etiological evidence in the development of anxiety. 5. A number of testable hypotheses can be generated from our present knowledge. As a result, new and more specific treatments may become apparent for the anxiety disorders.", 
    "66": "Explant cultures of rat spinal cord, brain stem and cerebellum were used to visualize GABAA-receptors by means of immunohistochemistry. For these studies we have incubated the cultures with the monoclonal antibody bd 17 against the beta-subunit of the GABAA/benzodiazepine/chloride channel complex. In spinal cord cultures, many interneurones were immunoreactive whereas only a small number of large neurones, probably motoneurones was specifically stained. In brain stem cultures, groups of large and medium-sized neurones showed immunoreactivity. In cultures of cerebellum, a great number of neurones was specifically stained. Granule cells showed the strongest immunoreactivity whereas other neurones, presumably Purkinje cells and interneurones, were only moderately stained. The immunoreactivity was mainly confined to the cell bodies of the neurones while their processes were only weakly or not stained. In contrast to neurones, no immunoreactivity could be detected on astrocytes.", 
    "67": "Certain endogenous steroids are modulators of GABAA receptors. Tetrahydroprogesterone (THP, 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one) and tetrahydrodeoxy-corticosterone (THDOC, 5 alpha-pregnane-3 alpha, 21-diol-20-one) behave as allosteric agonists of GABAA receptors whereas pregnenolone sulphate acts as an antagonist. THP and THDOC modulate ligand binding to GABAA receptors like barbiturates; they potentiate binding of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol and the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam and they allosterically inhibit binding of the convulsant t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate. THP and THDOC also stimulate chloride uptake and currents in synaptoneurosomes and neurons. Pregnenolone sulphate acts principally as an allosteric GABAA receptor antagonist; it competitively inhibits binding of [35S] TBPS and blocks GABA agonist-activated Cl- uptake and currents in synaptoneurosomes and neurons. In behavioural experiments the GABA-agonistic steroid THDOC shows anxiolytic actions whereas the GABA-antagonistic steroid pregnenolone sulphate antagonizes barbiturate-induced hypnosis. Changes in physiological levels of GABAergic steroids may alter GABAA receptor function, influencing neuronal excitability and CNS arousal. For example, pregnancy and the puerperium are associated with alterations in GABAA receptor binding which might be attributable to steroid actions.", 
    "68": "The effect of some endogenous and synthetic steroids on the operation of inhibitory and excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter receptors was examined. Anaesthetic pregnane steroids (e.g. alphaxalone, 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one, 5 alpha-pregnane-3 alpha,21-diol-20-one) potentiated GABAA receptor-mediated whole-cell currents recorded from bovine chromaffin cells. The threshold concentration for enhancement was 10-30 nM. Potentiation was stereoselective and was mediated by a steroid-induced prolongation of the burst duration of the GABA-activated channel. Additionally, the pregnane steroids directly activated the GABAA receptor. Both the potentiation and activation appear to be mediated through a site(s) distinct from the well-known barbiturate and benzodiazepine allosteric sites of the GABAA receptor. Intracellularly applied alphaxalone and 5 beta-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one had no discernible effects on the GABAA receptor, suggesting that the steroid binding site can only be accessed extracellularly. Unlike behaviourally depressant barbiturates, which modulate GABAA receptor function in a manner similar to that of the pregnane steroids, alphaxalone and 5 beta-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one show striking pharmacological selectivity. Voltage-clamp recordings from rat central neurons in culture indicate that pentobarbitone exerts its potentiating and GABA-mimetic effects over a range of concentrations which also depress currents mediated by glutamate receptor subtypes. In contrast, alphaxalone and several endogenous steroids greatly enhance responses to GABA, but have no direct effect on glutamate receptors. Such pharmacological selectivity, coupled with appropriate stereoselectivity of action, suggests that the GABAA receptor mediates some of the behavioural effects of synthetic and endogenous pregnane steroids.", 
    "69": "The involvement of GABAergic systems in the pathogenesis of HE was supported by electrophysiologic studies of single Purkinje neurons from rabbits with HE which demonstrated the hypersensitivity of these neurons to depression by GABA and BZ receptor agonists. In contrast, these neurons were excited by BZ receptor antagonists. At concentrations which had no effect on neuronal activity, BZ receptor antagonists also reversed the hypersensitivity of HE neurons to depression by muscimol. This combination of neuronal responses is consistent with an increase in the concentration or availability of a ligand for the BZ receptor with agonist properties in the brains of rabbits with HE. Subsequent neurochemical studies support these electrophysiologic observations. Autoradiographic techniques indicated the presence of a reversible inhibitor of [3H]Ro 15-1788 and [3H]flunitrazepam binding to the cerebral and cerebellar cortices of rabbits with HE. The ability of this substance to inhibit [3H]flunitrazepam binding to HE rabbit brain sections was further enhanced in the presence of NaCl and GABA. The autoradiographic studies suggested that the density and affinity of the components of the GABA-BZ receptor complex are unaltered in this animal model of HE. This inference is fully supported by the subsequent studies of radioligand binding to well-washed membrane preparations. Finally, extracts of HE rabbit brains yielded a family of substances with the properties of BZ receptor agonists. These substances may include, but are not limited to, diazepam, oxazepam and desmethyldiazepam, but do not include substances commonly elevated in the plasma and CSF of patients with HE4. The positive identification of these substances awaits confirmation by mass-spectroscopic analysis. However, the precedent for the presence of a family of benzodiazepines in animals that were not administered these drugs has been set. The origin of these substances is a matter of ongoing research. Several studies have shown the presence of benzodiazepines in plant and animal materials. It is possible that these \"endogenous\" benzodiazepines are the result of contamination of the food chain. A normally functioning liver would capture and metabolize these compounds after their absorption from the gut. This function of the liver would be impaired in liver failure, thus allowing sufficient levels of BZ receptor agonists to accumulate in the CNS, contributing to the pathogenesis of HE. However, studies by DeBlas and coworkers have reported that 1,4 benzodiazepines are present in human brains preserved prior to the commercial use of these compounds. Further, they have found benzodiazepines in cell lines cultured without potential exogenous sources of benzodiazepines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "70": "The possible mediation of dopaminergic, muscarinic cholinergic and/or serotonergic receptors in the response of ACTH/cortisol to metoclopramide (MCP) was evaluated in 27 normal men. All subjects were tested with MCP (10 mg in an intravenous bolus plus placebo or saline, NaCl 0.9%, control test). For the other tests (experimental tests), the men were divided into three groups of 9 subjects each. One group was tested with MCP in the presence of the dopaminergic agonist bromocriptine (5 mg p.o. 3 h before MCP), another group was tested with MCP plus the M1- and M2-muscarinic-cholinergic antagonist atropine (1.2 mg in an intravenous bolus, just before MCP) or the M1-muscarinic receptor blocker pirenzepine (40 mg in an intravenous bolus 10 min before MCP). The third group was tested with MCP after treatment with the selective 5-HT1-serotonergic receptor blocker metergoline (10 mg/day p.o. in 5 divided doses for 4 days before MCP) or the 5-HT2-serotonergic receptor antagonist ketanserin (10 mg as a slow 3-min intravenous injection, 5 min before MCP). ACTH and cortisol rose by 45 and 55%, respectively, in response to MCP. The basal levels of ACTH and cortisol were not modified by bromocriptine, atropine, pirenzepine, metergoline or ketanserin treatment. Both ACTH and cortisol responses to MCP did not change significantly after bromocriptine, atropine, pirenzepine or ketanserin administration, whereas they were completely abolished by pretreatment with metergoline. Additional experiments were performed in order to evaluate whether the effect of metergoline on the ACTH/cortisol response to MCP depends on the amount of the serotonergic antagonist (dose-response study).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "The immediate posttraining administration of the GABA antagonist, bicuculline, or of the Cl-channel blockers, picrotoxin or Ro 5-4864, enhances memory. These drugs are effective when injected into the amygdaloid nucleus. Intraamygdala muscimol has an opposite effect. All this suggests that memory is modulated at the posttraining period by GABA-A receptors. The pre-, but not posttraining systemic administration of benzodiazepines hinders, and that of inverse agonists, or of the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil enhances retention of diverse tasks. Flumazenil, at doses lower than those that cause an enhancement, antagonizes the effect of benzodiazepine agonists and inverse agonists. This suggests that memory is modulated during acquisition by endogenous benzodiazepine receptor ligands: possibly the diazepam that was recently discovered in brain. Pretraining intraamygdala muscimol administration depresses memory, at doses several times higher than those that are effective posttraining. Pretraining Ro 5-4864 has no effect. This suggests that the release of endogenous benzodiazepines during training may modulate a GABA-A receptor complex, possibly in the amygdala, making it more sensitive to muscimol or Ro 5-4864 in the immediate posttraining period.", 
    "72": "1. Recent studies have demonstrated that antidepressant drugs are actually more effective than BZ's in the treatment of anxiety states. The role of two major neurochemical substrates that may be implicated in the anxiolytic activity of antidepressants, the benzodiazepine (BZ)-GABA receptor chloride ionophore complex and central serotonergic pathways, are focused on in this review. 2. A wide range of antidepressants elicit a reduction in BZ receptors and display anxiolytic effects within a conflict paradigm. 3. The anxiolytic activity of antidepressants, however, does not appear to be mediated via the BZ receptor, but possibly via another component of the complex such as the chloride channel-associated with the GABAA receptor. 4. Additionally, as possible candidates for the mechanism of anxiolytic activity of these compounds, results of pharmacological, behavioral and clinical studies point to the importance of serotonin (5-HT)1A receptors and 5-HT transporter sites as targets for the action of antidepressants, triazolobenzodiazepines and anxioselective piperazine derivatives.", 
    "73": "The potency of six antimuscarinic oxotremorine analogs at sympathetic ganglionic M1 and brainstem M2 muscarinic receptors was compared in the rat. Inhibition of the pressor effects of McNA343 or physostigmine was used as functional indicators of M1 and M2 blockade, respectively. 50% inhibitory doses (ID50) were calculated against both cholinomimetics. Of the analogs, PCA-10 was the most potent, with ID50 values of 0.16 and 0.11 mumol/kg versus McNA343 and physostigmine, respectively. A correlation analysis indicated that these analogs did not functionally discriminate between responses mediated by neuronal M1 or M2 muscarinic receptors in vivo. In contrast, these analogs antagonized M1 ganglionic responses at doses which produced negligible antagonism at cardiac and vascular M2 receptors.", 
    "74": "The present experiments investigated changes in beta-adrenoceptor binding and noradrenaline stores in mouse cerebral cortex after single treatments with drugs which bind to the GABAA receptor but which attenuate the actions of GABA. Neither the GABA antagonist, securinine, nor the picrotoxin/Cl- channel ligand, picrotoxin, affected noradrenaline levels or beta-adrenoceptor binding. However, both the benzodiazepine inverse agonist, DMCM, and pentylenetetrazole increased noradrenaline levels 24 h after injection. Only pentylenetetrazol modified beta-adrenoceptor binding: there was a significant increase in receptor number 4 days after injection, but a significant decrease after 7 days. The anxiogenic, proconvulsant drug, yohimbine, was without effect. The changes induced by DMCM and pentylenetetrazole do not seem to be related to the behavioural effects of these drugs or to their affinity for binding to benzodiazepine receptors. The possibility that these compounds have actions in addition to those at the GABAA receptor is discussed.", 
    "75": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)A is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS. GABAA ergic synapse is also an important site of action for a variety of centrally acting drugs, including benzodiazepines and barbiturates. Several lines of electrophysiological, behavioral, and biochemical studies implicate GABAA ergic synapse in the actions of alcohol. In electrophysiological studies, alcohol has been reported to enhance GABA-mediated responses in cortical neurons, spinal cord and substantia nigra, albeit, negative results have also been reported. In behavioral studies, GABAmimetics enhance alcohol's effects on motor coordination, while GABA antagonists have the opposite effect. In drug-combination studies, subeffective doses of alcohol, in combination with subeffective doses of other GABAmimetics, potentiate each other's effect in several seizure models. In functional studies, alcohol has been reported to potentiate GABA receptor-mediated 36Cl-flux in microsacs, neurosynaptosomes, and cultured spinal cord neurons at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. The potentiating effect of alcohol is blocked by GABA antagonists and the inverse agonists of the benzodiazepine receptor site. Taken together, these studies indicate that some of the central effects of alcohol are mediated via facilitation of GABAAergic transmission.", 
    "76": "Dispersed acini have proven to be particularly valuable in the study of pancreatic enzyme secretion. Complex time course studies or experiments requiring large numbers of replicates have proven difficult, however, with currently available techniques. Using a custom-designed incubation chamber, a miniaturized incubation method has been devised, which allows for continuous oxygenation of acini in 96-well microtiter plates and rapid separation of medium from acini by vacuum filtration. The filtrates from individual wells are collected into the wells of a second microtiter plate for pancreatic enzyme measurement. Using the above method, the dose response and time course of cholecystokinin (CCK-8)-stimulated amylase secretion was investigated. During a 1-h incubation, unstimulated amylase secretion was 4.1 +/- 0.3% of total acini content. Response to CCK was very sensitive, being detected at 10(-13) M (p less than 0.05), half-maximal at 10(-11) M CCK (14.0 +/- 0.6%, p less than 0.001) and maximal at 10(-9) M CCK (24.8 +/- 1.0%, p less than 0.001). In the time course experiments, an increase in amylase secretion was detected by 2.5 min and continued to increase steadily to a plateau at 40 min, with both submaximal (10(-11) M) and maximal (10(-9) M) CCK concentrations. The potent and specific CCK-receptor antagonist, L-364,718, caused a dose-dependent decrease in CCK-stimulated amylase secretion, with a half-maximal effect at 10(-10) M. The receptor antagonist, L-364,718, at 10(-8) M completely abolished CCK-stimulated amylase secretion. This microtechnique provides a simple, reliable, and reproducible method for the study of dispersed pancreatic acini.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "77": "The effect of foot shock stress on [35S] t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding to fresh unwashed membrane preparations from rat cerebral cortex was studied and was compared to those of positive and negative modulators of the GABAergic transmission. 35S-TBPS binding was increased (30%) in cerebral cortex of rats exposed to foot shock compared to the non stressed rats. In contrast, the in vitro addition and the in vivo administration of anxiolytic and positive modulators of the GABAergic transmission inhibited the specific binding of 35S-TBPS. On the other hand, the anxiogenic beta-carbolines DMCM, beta CCM, FG 7142 and beta CCE mimicked in vivo and in vitro the effect of stress. The demonstration that stress, similar to anxiogenic beta-carbolines and opposite to benzodiazepines and anxiolytic beta-carbolines, increases 35S-TBPS binding in the rat cerebral cortex, suggests that some emotional state related to stress and anxiety may result from a diminished GABAergic transmission at the level of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor/chloride ionophore complex.", 
    "78": "Behavioral and neurochemical evidence indicates links between the opioid and GABA neurotransmitter systems. To assess effects of chronic opiates on the major site of postsynaptic GABAergic activity, the GABAA receptor, we administered chronic morphine and naltrexone to mice and evaluated binding at the benzodiazepine and t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) sites and GABA-dependent chloride uptake. After morphine (3 days), benzodiazepine receptor binding in vivo but not in vitro was increased in cortex compared to placebo-treated mice. TBPS binding was unchanged in cortex, but muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake was increased at low doses of muscimol. Benzodiazepine and TBPS binding and muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake were unchanged in naltrexone-(8 days) compared to placebo-treated mice. When naltrexone was administered previously to block opiate sites, the increases in benzodiazepine binding and chloride uptake observed with chronic morphine were reversed. These results indicate that chronic morphine but not naltrexone enhances benzodiazepine binding and GABAA receptor function, perhaps by an action at opioid receptors.", 
    "79": "1. The effects of the anticholinergic compound pirenzepine on pancreatic secretion stimulated by intravenous infusions of increasing doses of CCK (0.025-0.4 Ivy Dog Unit/kg/min) were investigated in fasting anaesthetized dogs. 2. Pirenzepine (0.75 mg/kg i.v.) slightly reduced the increases in the pancreatic juice secretion evoked by CCK. 3. Similar results were obtained with others anticholinergic compounds as atropine (3 mg/kg i.v.) and hexametonium (5 mg/kg i.v.).", 
    "80": "The effects of the peripheral-type benzodiapine receptor (PBR) ligands Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195 were studied in the spontaneously beating guinea pig atrium and in a model for myocardial ischemia in the rat. In the former, Bay K 8644 produced positive chronotropic and inotropic responses; intracarotid administration of this agonist (5 or 10 micrograms kg-1) to anesthetized rats elicited a transient increase in mean arterial blood pressure accompanied by alterations in the ECG pattern. Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195 (10 microM) completely blocked the positive chronotropic effect of Bay K 8644 in the atrium, PK 11209, a structural analog of PK 11195 with a low affinity for PBR, was inactive, and the central benzodiazepine receptor ligand clonazepam had a marginal effect. Ro 5-4864 potentiated whereas PK 11195 inhibited the myocardial ischemia produced by Bay K 8644 in the rat. Furthermore, PK 11195 blocked the combined response to Bay K 8644 and Ro 5-4864. Addition of Ro 5-4864 (10 microM) to the organ bath potentiated the inotropic effect of Bay K 8644 in the atria; PK 11195 at the same concentration inhibited this effect. Clonazepam and PK 11209 were both inactive in this regard. Nifedipine, a potent calcium channel antagonist, completely blocked the inotropic and chronotropic responses to Bay K 8644. PK 11195 and Ro 5-4864 did not affect this action. These findings strongly suggest that there is a functional association between PBR and voltage-operated calcium channels in the guinea pig atrium and rat cardiovascular system.", 
    "81": "In order to study the morphological localization of the endogenous benzodiazepine ligand octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) in rat brain, we have developed antibodies against this peptide. Using a radioimmunoassay for ODN, we have observed that synthetic ODN and serial dilutions of several brain areas gave parallel displacement curves. By light microscope immunocytochemistry, ODN-immunoreactive material was only detected in glial and ependymal cells. Immunolabelled cells were found in high concentrations in the olfactory bulb, hypothalamus, hippocampus, periaqueductal gray, cerebral cortex and the circumventricular organs. In the cerebellar cortex, immunostaining was associated with Bergmann cells. The studies performed at the electron microscopic level confirmed the association of immunoreactive material with glial and ependymal cells. The present results suggest that ODN might play a role in the function of glial cells which have been shown to contain benzodiazepine receptors of the \"peripheral type\".", 
    "82": "Isatin (Tribulin) produced a dose-dependent inhibition of both MAO A and MAO B in broken cell preparations from rat brain and pineal. However, isatin administered in vivo (80-160 mg/kg) to the intact animal significantly increased brain, but not pineal, serotonin and did not affect 5HIAA or other indoles in either brain or pineal. Further, in vivo administration did not produce detectable MAO inhibition in either tissue. In pineal organ culture, addition of isatin up to 1mM had no influence on the concentrations of pineal indoles or the activities of monoamine oxidase or serotonin N-acetyltransferase. However, the diazepam augmentation of beta adrenergic induction of serotonin N-acetyltransferase activity was blocked by isatin. The results of these studies call into question the proposed role of isatin as an endogenous monoamine oxidase inhibitor but support a possible role as a benzodiazepine receptor blocker.", 
    "83": "Isolated segments of the guinea-pig small intestine and the guinea-pig stomach were vascularly perfused and the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid into the portal venous effluent determined by high pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Test substances were applied intraarterially. The benzodiazepine receptor agonist, midazolam, concentration-dependently increased (by 58%, at 1 nmol/l) and decreased (by 32%, at 100 nmol/l) the release of 5-HT from small intestine preparations. Both effects were blocked by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (10 nmol/l) The stimulatory effect of midazolam was also abolished in the presence of tetrodotoxin (1 mumol/l) or scopolamine (100 nmol/l). In the absence of tetrodotoxin, flumazenil (10 nmol/l) alone decreased the release of 5-HT from the small intestine by 41%, but it increased the release of 5-HT by 50% in the presence of tetrodotoxin. Both effects of flumazenil were abolished in the presence of bicuculline (50 mumol/l). In the absence of tetrodotoxin, flumazenil (10 nmol/l) decreased also the release of 5-HT and its metabolite from the perfused stomach by about 40%, whereas midazolam (1 nmol/l) caused an increase by about 60%. In conclusion, benzodiazepine receptors modulate the previously described intrinsic GABAergic regulation of 5-HT release from enterochromaffin cells in the guinea-pig intestine. It is suggested that an endogenous benzodiazepine-like substance of non-neuronal origin is present in the small intestine and stomach of the guinea-pig.", 
    "84": "The phencyclidine (PCP) binding site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, the kainic acid (KA) receptor and the quisqualate (QA) receptor were visualised, using autoradiography in the human spinal cord and the distributions compared with that of benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors and substance P (SP). All of the receptor types, and SP, were concentrated in lamina II of the dorsal horn, consistent with physiological data indicating that glutamate is a neurotransmitter of primary afferent terminals in the spinal cord.", 
    "85": "Effects of ethanol in vitro on membrane vesicles (microsacs prepared from mouse cerebral cortex) were evaluated by monitoring 36Cl- influx. Different assay parameters were tested to determine increased or decreased action of ethanol on GABA-activated chloride channels. The ability of 30 mM ethanol to augment 36Cl- flux was seen at 0 degrees C, in the absence of GABA (\"direct\" action of ethanol), and at 34 degrees C in the presence of GABA, using two different assay procedures. Picrotoxin blocked the direct effects of ethanol (at 0 degrees C) suggesting GABAa involvement. Endogenous GABA in the medium surrounding the microsacs was assayed at different temperatures both in the presence and absence of GABA and ethanol. The direct effect of ethanol did not appear to involve the action of endogenous GABA. In addition to temperature effects on the assay, time of membrane storage also influenced ethanol action. Microsacs stored on ice for 2 hours or more lost their ability to respond to ethanol but not to GABA, pentobarbital or flunitrazepam. When these drugs were tested on membranes from mice that had been sacrificed by cervical dislocation as opposed to decapitation, ethanol did not augment GABA-stimulated chloride flux. The method of sacrifice did not influence the response to GABA, pentobarbital or flunitrazepam.", 
    "86": "The effect of intravenous administration of two sedatives, diazepam (0.3 mg/kg) and thiopental (6.0 mg/kg), on the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) in man was investigated on 9 volunteers. The VOR was evoked with a velocity step rotation test and gain and time constant of prerotatory and postrotatory nystagmus were measured. Both drugs reduced VOR gain. Diazepam-induced reduction lasted 8 h and thiopental-induced reduction 1 h. A reduction of the VOR time constant was found lasting about 1 h for both drugs, but with a tendency for the thiopental effect to last longer. These findings, not previously described in man, differ from what has been found in macaques and rabbits injected with diazepam. The reduction of gain and time constant were not correlated with the blood concentration of either drug. The present results suggest that in man the VOR gain and time constant are both reduced by different types of sedatives although with different time courses. On the basis of previously shown effect of alertness on the VOR, it is hypothesized that diazepam and thiopental, besides having a specific effect on central nervous system structures important to the VOR, also induce reduction of the VOR through a general sedation of the CNS.", 
    "87": "A single, rapid and specific solid-phase clean-up procedure was developed for the analysis of benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants using a carefully selected wash step and specific sequential elution. Benzodiazepines were eluted from the solid-phase column using as mixture of water-methanol-acetonitrile (2:3:3) followed by the elution of tricyclic antidepressants with methanol containing 0.6% diethylamine. A 30% solution of acetonitrile in phosphate buffer containing dimethyloctylamine was used as a common isocratic mobile phase for the analysis of benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants on a reversed-phase column and detection was carried out at 242 nm. The sensitivity limit of the assay for benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants was 25 ng/ml in serum with recoveries of 95-105% for benzodiazepines and 76-95% for tricyclic antidepressants. The results were linear for benzodiazepines over the range 50-2000 ng/ml and for tricyclic antidepressants over the range 25-500 ng/ml. Analysis for benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants gave good precision, with a coefficient of variation of less than 5.0%. The method described here will be suitable for use in a clinical setting, where there is a concomitant use of benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants.", 
    "88": "Two-dimensional NMR experiments were performed on the adduct of anthramycin with d(ATGCAT)2 to obtain the assignments of the nucleotide base and sugar protons as well as the anthramycin protons. Anthramycin is covalently attached to a guanine 2-amino group, forming the d(ATamGCAT).d(ATGCAT) modified duplex. The anthramycin protons in the minor groove exhibit NOEs to several nucleotide protons. The network of anthramycin-nucleotide NOEs and the measurement of the 10-Hz coupling constant between the anthramycin H11 and H11a protons shows that anthramycin is covalently attached as the S stereoisomer at the anthramycin C11 position with the side chain of anthramycin oriented toward the 5' end of the modified strand. The NOE data show that the anthramycin-modified duplex is in a right-handed conformation with all bases in an anti conformation. Analysis of the J1'-2' coupling constants for the resolved H1' resonances shows that the S-type conformation of the sugars is highly preferred."
