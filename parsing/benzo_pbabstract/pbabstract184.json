In a prospective randomized cohort trial, 139 children (77 girls, 62 boys) who experienced a first febrile seizure were allocated to two groups: group A, which received intermittent diazepam (n = 68), and group B, which received no prophylaxis (n = 71). All children had a 3-year follow-up. The inclusion criteria were no personal history of afebrile seizures, normal neurodevelopment, no previous anticonvulsant therapy, and age between 6 months and 3 years. Each group was stratified to low, intermediate, and high risk according to the available clinical data. The 36-month recurrence rates in the no-prophylaxis group were 83% in high-risk patients, 55% in intermediate-risk patients, and 46% in low-risk patients. In the prophylaxis group, the recurrence rates were reduced in all risk groups: 38%, 35%, and 33%, respectively. Intermittent diazepam prophylaxis reduces the recurrence rate mainly in high-risk children provided that sufficient doses are given on time and adequately.",

The purpose of this study was to compare the recovery of dynamic balance after intravenous sedation with propofol or midazolam, and to investigate the usefulness of simple dynamic balance tests in evaluating the recovery.", 
    "2": "Fourteen young male volunteers underwent intravenous sedation with propofol and midazolam for 1 h each at an interval of more than 1 week. Computerized dynamic posturography using a multi-axial tilting platform, the 10-m maximum-speed walking test and the timed 'up & go' test (subjects stand up from a chair, walk 5 m and back with maximum speed and sit down again) were performed before and after sedation. The increase in each variable of the tests described above represents a reduction of function.", 
    "3": "The score of the computerized dynamic posturography was significantly lower in propofol sedation than that in midazolam sedation until 40 min after the end of sedation (P = 0.006). The scores of maximum-speed walking test and timed 'up & go' test were significantly lower in propofol sedation than those in midazolam sedation till 60 min after the end of sedation, respectively (P = 0.035 and 0.042). The timed 'up & go' and maximum-speed walking tests were well and significantly correlated with computerized dynamic posturography in midazolam sedation (timed 'up & go' test vs. computerized dynamic posturography: r = 0.66, P < 0.01; and maximum-speed walking test vs. computerized dynamic posturography: r = 0.53, P < 0.01).",

Midazolam 2 mg or ondansetron 4 mg were administered intravenously 30 min before the end of surgery. The proportions of patients who experienced postoperative nausea and vomiting in the first 24 h (30% and 27% for the midazolam and ondansetron groups, respectively) were similar in the two groups. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was significantly smaller in both groups than predicted according to the patients' underlying risks (midazolam group: p = 0.018; ondansetron group: p = 0.017). There were no significant differences in average sedation scores or pain scores. Treatment using ondansetron for anti-emetic prophylaxis did not provide a superior benefit compared to midazolam in the present study.", 
    "6": "In 2005, the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) published guidelines for the management of bipolar disorder. This update reviews new evidence since the previous publication and incorporates recommendations based on the most current evidence for treatment of various phases of bipolar disorder. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the 2005 CANMAT Guidelines. The recommendations for the management of acute mania remain mostly unchanged. Lithium, valproate and several atypical antipsychotics continue to be recommended as first-line treatments for acute mania. For the management of bipolar depression, new data support quetiapine monotherapy as a first-line option. Lithium and lamotrigine monotherapy, olanzapine plus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), and lithium or divalproex plus SSRI/bupropion continue to remain the other first-line options. First-line options in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder continue to be lithium, lamotrigine, valproate and olanzapine. There is recent evidence to support the combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine as a second-line maintenance therapy for bipolar depression. New data also support quetiapine monotherapy as a second-line option for the management of acute bipolar II depression. The importance of comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions cannot be understated, and this update provides an expanded look at the prevalence, impact and management of comorbid conditions in patients with bipolar disorder.",

The analyte and the IS were extracted from plasma by liquid-liquid extraction using a hexane/diethylether (20 : 80, v/v) solution. The extracts were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS-MS). Chromatography was performed on a Jones Genesis C8 4 microm analytical column (100 x 2.1 mm i.d.). The method had a chromatographic run time of 3.0 min and a linear calibration curve over the range 0.5-50 ng/ml (r2 > 0.9965). The limit of quantification was 0.5 ng/ml. This HPLC/MS/MS procedure was used to assess the bioequivalence of two clonazepam 2 mg tablet formulations (clonazepam test formulation from Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd and Rivotril from Roche Laborat\u00f3rios Ltda as standard reference formulation).",

    "9": "The sedative-hypnotic medications, including benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepines, are the most common treatments for insomnia. However, concerns regarding patterns of inappropriate use, dependence and adverse effects have led to caution in prescribing those sedative-hypnotic medications. On the other hand, a traditional Chinese herb remedy, suanzaorentang, has been efficiently and widely used in clinic for insomnia relief without severe side effects in Asia. Although suanzaorentang has been reported to improve sleep disruption in insomniac patients, its mechanism is still unclear. The present study was designed to elucidate the effects of oral administration of suanzaorentang on physiological sleep-wake architectures and its underlying mechanism in rats. We found that oral administration of suanzaorentang at the beginning of the dark onset dose-dependently increased non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) during the dark period, but had no significant effect on rapid eye movement sleep (REMS). Our results also indicated that intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor type A antagonist, bicuculline, significantly blocked suanzaorentang-induced enhancement in NREMS during the dark period, but GABA(B) receptor antagonist, 2-hydroxysaclofen had no effect. These results implicated that this traditional Chinese herb remedy, suanzaorentang increases spontaneous sleep activity and its effects may be mediated through the GABA(A) receptors, but not GABA(B) receptors.", 
    "10": "Peptides of the endozepine family, including diazepam-binding inhibitor, the triakontatetraneuropeptide, and the octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), act through three types of receptors, that is, central-type benzodiazepine receptors (CBR), peripheral-type (mitochondrial) benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) and a metabotropic receptor positively coupled to phospholipase C via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. We have previously reported that ODN exerts a potent anorexigenic effect in rat and we have found that the action of ODN is not affected by the mixed CBR/PBR agonist diazepam. In the present report, we have tested the possible involvement of the metabotropic receptor in the anorexigenic activity of ODN. Intracerebroventricular administration of the C-terminal octapeptide (OP) and its head-to-tail cyclic analog cyclo(1-8)OP (cOP) at a dose of 100 ng mimicked the inhibitory effect of ODN on food intake in food-deprived mice. The specific CBR antagonist flumazenil and the PBR antagonist PK11195 did not prevent the effect of ODN, OP, and cOP on food consumption. In contrast, the selective metabotropic endozepine receptor antagonist cyclo(1-8)[DLeu(5)]OP (100-1000 ng; cDLOP) suppressed the anorexigenic effect of ODN, OP, and cOP. At the highest concentration tested (1000 ng), cDLOP provoked by itself a significant increase in food intake. Taken together, the present results indicate that the anorexigenic effect of ODN and OP is mediated through activation of the metabotropic receptor recently characterized in astrocytes. The data also suggest that endogenous ODN, acting via this receptor, exerts an inhibitory tone on feeding behavior.",

Extrapyramidal symptom severity scores were 1.4 (95% CI=1.2-1.6) with risperidone and 1.2 (95% CI=1.0-1.4) with olanzapine. Significantly more weight gain occurred with olanzapine than with risperidone: the increase in weight at 4 months relative to baseline weight was 17.3% (95% CI=14.2%-20.5%) with olanzapine and 11.3% (95% CI=8.4%-14.3%) with risperidone. Body mass index at baseline and at 4 months was 24.3 (95% CI=22.8-25.7) versus 28.2 (95% CI=26.7-29.7) with olanzapine and 23.9 (95% CI=22.5-25.3) versus 26.7 (95% CI=25.2-28.2) with risperidone.",

Second, for patients whose baseline antipsychotic was olanzapine (N=319), risperidone (N=271), or quetiapine (N=94), the authors examined the impact of being randomly assigned to stay with the same antipsychotic versus switch. Finally, the authors assessed the impact of removing the data of 209 patients whose random assignment was to stay with their baseline antipsychotic. The authors followed analysis strategies for CATIE; primary outcome was time until all-cause treatment discontinuation.",

    "22": "Economic claims made by the authors of a number of trial-based economic evaluations have generally been favorable to second-generation antipsychotics. However, the methodological issues the authors of the current study identified suggest that there is no clear evidence that atypical antipsychotics generate cost savings or are cost-effective in general use among all schizophrenia patients. Psychiatrists, researchers, and administrators should consider the methodological issues highlighted in interpreting study results. These issues should be addressed in future trial designs.", 
    "23": "Insomnia and hypersomnia are frequent sleep disorders, and they are most often treated pharmacologically with hypnotics and wake-promoting compounds. These compounds act on classical neurotransmitter systems, such as benzodiazepines on GABA-A receptors, and amfetamine-like stimulants on monoaminergic terminals to modulate neurotransmission. In addition, acetylcholine, amino acids, lipids and proteins (cytokines) and peptides, are known to significantly modulate sleep and are, therefore, possibly involved in the pathophysiology of some sleep disorders. Due to the recent developments of molecular biological techniques, many neuropeptides have been newly identified, and some are found to significantly modulate sleep. It was also discovered that the impairment of the hypocretin/orexin neurotransmission (a recently isolated hypothalamic neuropeptide system) is the major pathophysiology of narcolepsy, and hypocretin replacement therapy is anticipated to treat the disease in humans. In this article, the authors briefly review the history of neuropeptide research, followed by the sleep modulatory effects of various neuropeptides. Finally, general strategies for the pharmacological therapeutics targeting the peptidergic systems for sleep disorders are discussed.",

    "25": "We observed in vitro neuroprotective and AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist effects of the new 2,3-benzodiazepine derivative EGIS-8332 (R,S-1-(4-aminophenyl)-7,8-methylenedioxy-4-cyano-4-methyl-3-N-acetyl-5H-3,4-dihydro-2,3-benzodiazepine) using the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay and patch clamp recordings on primary cultures of rat embryonic telencephalon neurons exposed to AMPA/kainate receptor agonists. EGIS-8332 potently decreased alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) and quisqualate induced LDH release (IC(50)=5.2+/-0.4 and 7.4+/-1.3 microM, respectively) from the cells. Whole-cell patch clamp studies carried out on the ionotropic glutamate receptors N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA), as well as AMPA (and kainate) in cultured telencephalon neurons verified that EGIS-8332 blocked steady state responses to AMPA and kainate (IC(50)=1.7+/-0.4 and 6.2+/-1.6 microM, respectively), but hardly influenced currents evoked by NMDA. EGIS-8332 also inhibited kainate-evoked response in CHO cells expressing the flop variant of GluR1 receptor and, in cerebellar Purkinje cells at similar efficiency. The stereoselectivity of the inhibitory site is established by the clearly dissimilar inhibitory potency of the enantiomer components of EGIS-8332 differing in the configuration of methyl and cyano substituents on carbon C(4): the R(-) enantiomer was found to be the efficient species. This finding suggests that the inhibitory interaction between the channel protein and drug is promoted by presence of the C(4) methyl group. The inhibition of the AMPA/kainate ion channels by EGIS-8332 is non-competitive, not use dependent, and depends neither on the closed/open state of the channel, nor the membrane potential. These findings suggest an allosteric mechanism for the inhibition. These in vitro observations suggest that the compound might be useful in the treatments of certain acute and chronic neurological syndromes initiated by derangements of ionotropic glutamate receptor function.", 
    "26": "The sensitivity of prenatally malnourished rats to the ultrasonic vocalization (USV) suppressant effect of diazepam (a non-specific benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor agonist) was investigated. Male offspring of dams provided with a protein deficient diet (6% casein) for 5 weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy were compared to the offspring of mothers provided with a diet of adequate protein content (25% casein). At postnatal day 7 or 11, pups were injected with vehicle or one of five doses of DZ (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1 or 3mg/kg) 30 min after removal from their dam. Thirty minutes later they were subjected to 2 min of cooling on a 20 degrees C surface and their USVs were quantified. DZ dose-dependently suppressed USV at both ages. At P7, the USV suppressant effect of DZ was the same for both groups. However, by P11 the prenatally malnourished rats showed significantly greater suppression of USV by 0.03 and 0.1mg/kg DZ than well-nourished controls. These differences were not related to degree of temperature loss or body weight. Thus, differential sensitivity to BZ receptor agonists develops in the second postnatal week in prenatally malnourished rats. This reflects either an altered program of development of the GABAergic system, or adaptive, compensatory changes in the GABAergic system in response to more extensive functional disturbances in the developing brain.",

    "29": "In the first study, horses were offered a high-fat (8% fat) or a high-carbohydrate (3% fat) pelleted meal of identical volume, caloric density, and protein content. Related plasma CCK-like activity was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). In a separate experiment, a horse was fed a grain meal with corn oil and phenylalanine, and plasma CCK activity was assessed by bioassay. A second study evaluated the effect of a CCK-1 receptor antagonist, devazepide (0.1 mg/kg, IV), on gastric accommodation and emptying following a meal of grain supplemented with either corn oil (12.3% fat) or an isocaloric amount of glucose (2.9% fat). Gastric tone was measured by a barostat and emptying by the (13)C-octanoic acid breath test.", 
    "30": "No plasma CCK-like activity was detected by RIA or bioassay before or after ingestion of meals.

    "32": "Pregabalin is a novel central nervous system (CNS) drug with no interaction at benzodiazepine or GABA receptor. Its mechanism of action is correlated with its high affinity for the alpha/delta submit of the voltage-dependant CNS calcium channel. Pregabalin is rapidly absorbed with at least 90% bioavailable irrespective of dose, does not bind to plasma proteins and is excreted virtually unchanged by the kidneys. Pharmacokinetics are linear and predictable across the therapeutic dose range (150-600 mg/ day). Pregabalin is indicated, like gabapentin, in the treatment of neuropathic pain syndromes like post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) and diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN). Efficacy in other neuropathic pain syndromes need further investigations. This paper emphasizes advantages and disadvantages on a clinical point of view.", 
    "33": "We previously isolated and characterized the novel human gene MOST-1 (C8orf17) that is ubiquitously expressed in all cancer cell lines tested but differentially expressed in normal adult tissues. MOST-1 maps to chromosome region 8q24.2 whose amplification is frequently associated with breast and prostate cancers. RT-PCR analyses of breast and prostatic biopsies revealed MOST-1 overexpression and/or amplification in high-grade carcinomas. We raised and characterized a polyclonal antibody against a MOST-1-specific synthetic peptide. in vitro expression of MOST-1 protein revealed a tendency to exist as high molecular mass isoforms which are SDS-insoluble upon thermal stress. MOST-1 displayed cytoplasmic localization in four human cell lines (hTERT-HME1 normal mammary epithelial, MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma, PrEC normal prostate epithelial and DU145 prostate carcinoma), with polar expression during cell division. Knockdown of MOST-1 expression in DU145 cells resulted in reduced cell proliferation but enhanced apoptosis implying a putative mitogenic role of MOST-1. Yeast two-hybrid analyses demonstrated interaction with seven human proteins, most of which are overexpressed in tumors or involved in metabolic pathways. The interacting proteins were creatine kinase, Gardner feline sarcoma v-FGR oncogene product, telethonin, SNC73 protein, ferritin light chain, peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, and immunoglobulin C (mu) and C (delta) heavy chain. Co-immunoprecipitation assays validated the interactions of MOST-1 with the latter three proteins. Our results suggest that MOST-1 is associated with cell survival, proliferation and progression of cancer cells.",

Search limits that were employed included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), English language, human studies, children aged 0-18 yr, and publication dates 1990 - present (January 2006). A review of the 171 abstracts obtained was undertaken and, of these, 30 papers were identified that concerned oral midazolam in children prior to general anesthesia, and that involved a RCT with a placebo or control arm. These studies were assigned levels of evidence, and grades of recommendation were made according to Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine criteria.", 
    "36": "Oral midazolam premedication in children was found to reduce the anxiety associated with separation from parents/guardians, and with induction of anesthesia. Recovery times are not significantly delayed. There is no consistent evidence to suggest a reduction in the phenomenon of emergence agitation. Evidence suggesting an improvement in behavioural outcomes at home is also inconsistent.", 
    "37": "Premedication with midazolam 0.5 mg x kg(-1) po administered 20-30 min preoperatively, is effective in reducing both separation and induction anxiety in children (grade A recommendation), with minimal effect on recovery times. However improved postoperative behavioural outcomes in the postanesthesia care unit, or at home cannot be predicted on a consistent basis.", 
    "38": "Because the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug efflux transporters has been shown in the intestine, the contribution of this tissue to the first-pass effect has become of significant interest. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of the absorption barriers in key preclinical species would be useful for the precise characterization of drug candidates. In the present investigation, we evaluated the intestinal first-pass effect of midazolam (MDZ) and fexofenadine (FEX), typical substrates for CYP3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), respectively, with ketoconazole (KTZ) as a potent dual CYP3A/P-gp inhibitor in cynomolgus monkeys. When MDZ or FEX was administered i.v. at doses of 0.3 or 1 mg/kg, respectively, the plasma concentration-time profiles were not influenced by p.o. coadministration of KTZ (20 mg/kg). On the other hand, when MDZ or FEX was administered p.o. at doses of 1 or 5 mg/kg, respectively, concomitant with a dose p.o. of KTZ (20 mg/kg), significant increases were observed in the area under the plasma concentration-time curves of MDZ or FEX (22-fold in MDZ and 3-fold in FEX). These findings indicate that both CYP3A and P-gp play a key role in the intestinal barrier and that inhibition of intestinal CYP3A/P-gp activities contributes exclusively toward the drug-drug interactions (DDI) with KTZ. Additionally, the K(i) values of the antifungal agents, KTZ, itraconazole, and fluconazole, for MDZ 1'-hydroxylation in monkey intestinal and liver microsomes were comparable with those in the respective human samples. These results suggest that monkeys may be an appropriate animal species for evaluating the intestinal first-pass effect of p.o. administered drugs and predicting intestinal DDI related to CYP3A4 and P-gp in humans.", 
    "39": "Movement and anxiety during echocardiographic study may reduce the reliability and affect the quality of echocardiographic images. Thus, sedation is an essential component when it is performed in infants. This randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled study was undertaken to evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of intranasal midazolam (INM) versus oral midazolam (OM) in infants during transthoracic echocardiography. Eighty patients between the ages of 6 mo and 3 y who presented for elective echocardiographic study were divided into 3 groups: the OM group received 0.4 mg/kg of injectable midazolam mixed with an equal volume of cherry juice, the INM group received 0.2 mg/kg as drops,and the control group was given oral cherry juice or intranasal serum physiologic. A blinded clinician assessed and scored the level of sedation and comfort during the procedure for each child, and a score for ease of administration was recorded by the nurse. The intranasal route was more acceptable to infants than the oral route (P<.001). No significant difference in the effects of sedation was observed between the OM group and the INM group (P=.583), but significant differences were observed between the sedated groups and the control group (P<.001). The procedure was significantly more comfortable in groups given OM and INM than in the control group (P<.001). Although no difference in sedation score was seen between the oral and nasal routes, INM was better accepted by infants than OM. Echocardiography was performed more reliably and comfortably in those given midazolam than in those in the control group.",

The affinities of a range of subtype selective antagonists (DAMP, darifenacin, methoctramine R0-320-6206, and pirenzepine) were obtained in tissue bath experiments by using carbachol as the agonist. These affinity values were then compared with the known affinities for these antagonists at the muscarinic receptor subtypes.", 
    "42": "An increased sensitivity to carbachol was observed in both the neurogenic and idiopathic overactive detrusors compared with the control human detrusor. The M(2)-selective antagonists (methoctramine, R0-320-6206) and M(1)-selective antagonist (pirenzepine) had low affinities, whilst the M(3)-selective antagonists (4-DAMP and darifenacin) had high affinities for the human detrusor muscarinic receptor in all three groups of tissues. The affinities (pK(B) values) for the five antagonists were consistent with antagonisms at the M(3) receptor in all three groups; Schild plot analysis indicated an action at this single receptor subtype.", 
    "43": "Contraction mediated by muscarinic receptors is enhanced in idiopathic and neurogenic overactive detrusors compared with control detrusor. The direct contractile response to carbachol is mediated by the M(3) receptor in both human normal and overactive bladders, indicating no change in receptor subtype contribution to contraction in the disease state.", 
    "44": "A serial-probe recognition task was used to assess the effects of midazolam on visual attention and short-term memory in three rhesus monkeys. On each trial, six unique alphanumeric sample stimuli (list items) were presented sequentially followed by a choice period. Choosing the 'probe' stimulus was correct if the probe matched one of the list items; otherwise, choosing the 'default' stimulus (a white square) was correct. Behavior was examined under a range of doses of midazolam (0.065, 0.13, 0.26, and 0.52 mg/kg IM). Midazolam did not significantly reduce choice accuracy or change the shape of the serial position function and did not significantly reduce choice responding. However, choice reaction time was significantly increased by the two highest doses of midazolam. Responding directed at the sample stimuli was reduced at the two highest doses of midazolam. Furthermore, 0.52 mg/kg midazolam significantly increased sample-stimulus reaction time at all six serial positions. Overall, these data suggest that the two highest doses of midazolam tested increase reaction time, but do not directly impair short-term visual recognition memory. This is noteworthy because such doses appear capable of protecting against nerve agent-induced seizures.", 
    "45": "Chronic nicotine administration is associated with increased ethanol consumption in laboratory animals and in humans. Some smokers report less sedation during acute ethanol intoxication after nicotine administration and the sedative effects from ethanol are mediated by inhibitory GABA(A)-receptors. In a series of in vivo microdialysis experiments we investigated whether subchronic pre-treatment with nicotinic drugs known to enhance ethanol consumption in the rat (nicotine or the peripheral nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium) could modulate the alterations in extracellular dopamine observed in response to administration of ethanol or the sedative GABA(A)-agonist diazepam. In the nucleus accumbens and the dorsal striatum, systemic and/or local ethanol administration resulted in transient increases in extracellular dopamine levels that returned to baseline before the local levels of ethanol started to decline. In hexamethonium pre-treated rats, however, the nucleus accumbens dopamine levels were time-locked to the ethanol levels in the same area after systemic or local ethanol administration. Perfusion of diazepam into the nucleus accumbens produced a significant reduction in nucleus accumbens dopamine in controls. Prior subchronic treatment with nicotine or hexamethonium abolished this effect. The present results suggest that subchronic treatment with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist hexamethonium reduces a GABA(A)-R mediated counteraction of the nucleus accumbens dopamine response to ethanol. Additionally, we demonstrate that modulation of nicotinic receptors may reduce the sensitivity of GABA(A) receptors to benzodiazepines. These phenomena may offer a novel explanation to why nicotine and alcohol are often co-abused.",

One of the boys was suffering from non-convulsive status epilepticus and the other from conscious disturbance with automatism. Their ictal EEG readings showed continuous diffuse spike and wave complexes, which were considered to show electrical status. The boys were diagnosed as having CSWS, and were later diagnosed with Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS). EEG readings returned to normal on intravenous injection of flunitazepam (FZP) at a dose of 0.02 mg/kg, suggesting that FZP is an effective treatment for CSWS.",

Data included etiology of end-stage renal disease, comorbid illnesses, mode of dialysis and duration, survival time after withdrawal, reason for withdrawal, mental competency, symptom management, and the nature of death. Mean survival time was 10 days. The most frequent symptoms following withdrawal were confusion, agitation, pain and dyspnea. 1/3 of the sample were cognitively impaired at the time of the withdrawal decision. 17% experienced suffering during the withdrawal period, 24% had unrelieved symptoms, 19% psychological distress, while just over 1/3 of patients died alone. With the provision of palliative care, symptom prevalence in the last 24 hours dropped from 53 to 20% for pain, 68 to 33% for agitation and 46 to 26% for dyspnea. Opioids and benzodiazepines were used in the treatment of over 90% of patients. Palliative medicine has the potential to improve the care of patients who discontinue dialysis.",

Propofol suppressed the epinephrine-induced increase in CI. During midazolam infusion, the highest dose of epinephrine caused a 37.5% increase in HR, which was significantly higher than for epinephrine infusion alone. This response was accompanied by the reduction in high-frequency power of heart rate variability, suggesting decreased parasympathetic activity. Nitrous oxide had no influence on the cardiovascular response to epinephrine.",

    "65": "The disparity of IC(50)s from CYP450 inhibition assays used to assess drug-drug interaction potential was investigated, in order to have evidence for selecting a reliable in vitro CYP450 inhibition assay to support drug discovery. Three assays were studied: individual rhCYP isozymes and corresponding coumarin derivative-probe substrates with fluorescent detection, human liver microsomes (HLM) and cocktail drug-probe substrates with LC-MS detection, and double cocktail rhCYP isozymes mix and drug-probe mix with LC-MS detection. Data comparisons showed that the rhCYP-fluorescent assay and the cocktail assay with HLM-LC-MS had weak correlation. Detection method and probe substrates were shown to not be the major cause of the disparity in IC(50)s. However, the enzyme source and composition (HLM versus, rhCYP) caused disparity in IC(50)s. Specifically, the high concentrations of CYP isozymes often used with HLM-based assays produced high probe substrate conversion and test compound metabolism, which should both contribute to artificially higher IC(50)s. Non-specific binding of substrate to higher concentration proteins and lipids in the HLM-based assays should also contribute to higher IC(50)s. The modified double cocktail assay was found to overcome limitations of the other two assays. It uses an rhCYP isozymes mix, drug-probe substrate mix, low protein concentration, and LC-MS detection. The double cocktail assay is sensitive, selective, and high throughout for use in drug discovery to provide an early alert to potential toxicity with regard to drug-drug interaction, prioritize chemical series, and guide structural modification to circumvent CYP450 inhibition.", 
    "66": "The anticancer drug anthramycin inhibits replication and transcription processes by covalently binding to DNA. Here, we use molecular simulations to investigate the interaction between this ligand and the dodecanucleotide d[GCCAACGTTGGC](2). We start from the X-ray structure of the adduct anthramycin-d[CCAACGTTG*G](2), in which the drug binds covalently to guanine.1 We focus on the noncovalent complexes between the oligonucleotide and the anhydro and hydroxy forms of the drug. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that only the hydroxy form lies in front of the reactive center for the whole simulation ( approximately 20 ns), while the anhydro form moves inside the minor groove to the nearest base pair after approximately 10 ns. This sliding process is associated to both energetic and structural relaxations of the complex. The accuracy of our computational setup is established by performing MD simulations of the covalent adduct and of a 14-mer complexed with anhydro-anthramycin. The MD simulations are complemented by hybrid Car-Parrinello quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations. These show that in the noncovalent complexes the electric field due to DNA polarizes the hydroxy and, even more, the anhydro form of the drug as to favor a nucleophilic attack by the alkylating guanine. This suggests that the binding process may be characterized by a multistep pathway, catalyzed by the electric field of DNA.",

RLS is characterized by an urge to move the legs that is worse at bedtime and at rest; the symptoms are temporarily relieved by leg movement. It is frequently accompanied by periodic limb movements during sleep (PLMS), which may independently disrupt sleep and may cause daytime drowsiness. Dopaminergic agents are considered to be first-line therapy in the management of RLS as well as PLMS.

This situation is contrary to current evidence and guidance on hypnotic prescribing. The aim of this study was to determine and compare primary care physicians' perceptions of benefits and risks of benzodiazepine and Z-drug use, and physicians' prescribing behaviour in relation to hypnotics using a cross-sectional survey. In 2005 a self-administered postal questionnaire was sent to all GPs in West Lincolnshire Primary Care Trust. The questionnaire investigated perceptions of benefits and disadvantages of benzodiazepines and Z-drugs. Of the 107 questionnaires sent to GPs, 84 (78.5%) analysable responses were received. Responders believed that Z-drugs were more effective than benzodiazepines in terms of patients feeling rested on waking (P<0.001), daytime functioning (P<0.001), and total sleep time (P = 0.03). Z-drugs were also thought to be safer in terms of tolerance (P<0.001), addiction (P<0.001), dependence (P<0.001), daytime sleepiness (P<0.001), and road traffic accidents (P = 0.018), and were thought to be safer for older people (P<0.001). There were significant differences between GPs' perceptions of the relative benefits and risk of Z-drugs compared with benzodiazepines. The majority of practitioners attributed greater efficacy and lower side effects to Z-drugs. GPs' beliefs about effectiveness and safety are not determined by current evidence or national (NICE) guidance which may explain the increase in Z-drug prescribing relative to benzodiazepine prescribing.",

Urine samples were collected from victims of suspected drug-induced sexual assault by law enforcement agencies, emergency rooms, and rape crisis centers. The most implicated drug class was benzodiazepines, either alone or in combination with alcohol. In this report, a procedure was developed for the screening of 22 benzodiazepines in human urine by liquid chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry [LC-MS-(TOF)]. The limit of quantitation for all benzodiazepines ranged from 2 to 10 ng/mL, and the limit of detection was 0.5 to 3.0 ng/mL. These results suggest that the method sensitivity is suitable to screen for all 22 benzodiazepines in human urine at low levels. The method was used to analyze samples previously reported to have screened positive for benzodiazepines by immunoassay at 50 ng/mL cut off but failed to confirm by a gas chromatography-MS method.

Certain aspects of violence in males have been related to high testosterone levels, but the relation of testosterone to attempted suicide has not been studied until now. We estimated plasma levels of testosterone (T), LH, and FSH in 80 male subjects after a suicide attempt and in whom a psychiatric assessment was done during their hospitalization. Suicide intent was evaluated in 72 subjects. A group of 56 healthy males in the same age range served as control. As a group, attempters showed significantly lower T levels, marginally higher LH, and normal FSH compared to controls. The attempters who used violent methods (26 subjects) had T levels even lower than the non-violent (drug overdose) subgroup. Comparisons of T levels of subgroups according to the (main) drug ingested (analgesics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, neuroleptics, or other drugs) did not reveal any significant drug effect. In relation to diagnosis, the lowest T levels were found in the subgroup with schizophrenia (29 subjects). The T levels of this subgroup were also significantly lower compared to those of a group of 31 male schizophrenic patients, hospitalized and treated with neuroleptics. If the influence of post-attempt stress and medical condition on plasma T could be ruled out, low plasma T may prove to be a biological predictor of attempt, at least in male schizophrenic patients. Nevertheless, the findings differentiate suicidal behavior from other aggressive/violent behaviors and do not support the notion that suicidal and aggressive behaviors are manifestations of the same impulse.",

Specific diagnoses were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV)--I and II, and rates of Axis I and II diagnoses in these groups were further compared to base rates in the general population. Additionally, medication usage was evaluated to determine group differences. Results revealed that JAW patients had lower BDI and CPI scores, as well as a higher level of functioning on the Global Assessment of Functioning assessed by the DSM-IV. Both acute pain groups also had significantly more Axis I and II disorders than the general population. Additionally, it was found that the JAW group used more benzodiazepines, while the LB group used more schedule II narcotics. A logistic regression model created from these variables found a six-factor model, composed of the CPI, MPI coping style anomalous, Ways of Coping problem-solving, Global Assessment of Functioning, anxiety disorders, and Cluster C personality disorder diagnoses, that differentiated the JAW from the LB group. Overall, these findings suggest that the differences identified between these two groups should be considered in developing tailored treatments for individuals with acute low back and jaw pain.",

The regional distribution of [(11)C]AC-5216 in a tumor in vivo was significantly heterogeneous; the uptake of [(11)C]AC-5216 was comparatively higher in the outer rim of the tumor and was lower in the central area. In contrast, the images obtained following the injection of [(11)C]AC-5216 with a large amount of nonlabeled PK11195 showed a relatively homogeneous distribution, suggesting that [(11)C]AC-5216 uptake represented specific binding to PBRs. In vitro autoradiograms of [(11)C]AC-5216 binding were also obtained using the section of the fibrosarcoma that was the same as that used to examine in vivo binding. In vitro autoradiographic binding images showed homogeneous distribution, and significant discrepancies of the intratumoral distribution of [(11)C]AC-5216 were observed between in vivo and in vitro images. The in vivo images of [(11)C]AC-5216 uptake, compared with those of [(14)C]iodoantipyrine uptake, obtained by dual autoradiography to evaluate the influence of blood flow revealed the similar intratumoral distributions of both tracers. These results indicate that the delivery process from the plasma to the tumor might be the rate-limiting step for the intratumoral distribution of PBR binding in vivo in a fibrosarcoma model.", 
    "104": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) are upregulated on activated microglia. We recently developed a promising positron emission tomography (PET) ligand, [11C]PBR28, with high affinity and excellent ratio of specific to nonspecific binding. We assessed the ability of [11C]PBR28 PET to localize PBRs in a rat permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of neuroinflammation. [11C]PBR28 was intravenously administered to rats at 4 and 7 days after permanent MCAO. In all experiments, arterial blood was sampled for compartmental modeling of regional distribution volumes, and rat brains were sampled after imaging for in vitro [3H]PK 11195 autoradiography and histological evaluation. [11C]PBR28 PET and [3H]PK 11195 autoradiography showed similar areas of increased PBRs, especially in the peri-ischemic core. Results from these in vivo and in vitro methods were strongly correlated. In this first study to demonstrate neuroinflammation in vivo with small animal PET, [11C]PBR28 had adequate sensitivity to localize and quantify the associated increase in PBRs.", 
    "105": "Pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia is associated with the stressful side effects. Muscle rigidity causes distress, discomfort and poor compliance. The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between plasma hormones (cortisol and prolactin/PRL) and muscle rigidity in female schizophrenic patients treated with olanzapine or fluphenazine. In a randomized, double-blind 22-weeks study, 12 patients were treated with olanzapine (5-20 mg/day) and 10 patients received fluphenazine (6-21 mg/day). Treatment with olanzapine moderately decreased, while treatment with fluphenazine significantly increased plasma cortisol levels and muscle rigidity. The marked and moderate increase in plasma PRL levels were found in patients treated with fluphenazine and olanzapine, respectively. The results suggested that olanzapine induced moderate neuroendocrine effects and a reduction in rigidity as compared to fluphenazine treatment.", 
    "106": "The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), an 18-kDa high affinity drug and cholesterol binding protein, is expressed at high levels in various cancers. Its expression is positively correlated with aggressive metastatic behavior in human breast cancer cells. To determine the role of PBR in tumor progression, two human mammary carcinoma cell lines were utilized: the non-aggressive MCF-7 cell line, which expresses extremely low PBR levels, and the highly aggressive MDA-MB-231 cell line, which has much higher PBR levels. We have generated stably transfected lines of the tetracycline-repressible MCF-7 cell line (MCF-7 Tet-Off) with inducible human PBR cDNA. Induction of PBR expression in MCF-7 Tet-Off cells increased PBR ligand binding and cell proliferation. Transfection of MDA-MB-231 cells with multiple siRNAs complementary to PBR (PBR-siRNAs) led to different levels of PBR mRNA knockdown. Lentiviral-mediated PBR RNA interference in MDA-MB-231 cells decreased PBR levels by 50%. Decreased PBR expression was associated with cell cycle arrest at G2 phase, decreased cell proliferation, and significant increases in the protein levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF/CIP1). These changes were accompanied by p53 activation seen as increased p53 phosphorylation (Ser15). In parallel, increased proteolytic activation of caspase-3 was also observed. Taken together these results suggest that PBR protein expression is directly involved in regulating cell survival and proliferation in human breast cancer cells by influencing signaling mechanisms involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis.", 
    "107": "The tumor suppressor p53 is a powerful antitumoral molecule frequently inactivated by mutations or deletions in cancer. However, half of all human tumors express wild-type p53, and its activation by antagonizing its negative regulator murine double minute 2 (MDM2) might offer a new therapeutic strategy. Proof-of-concept experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach in vitro but the development of pharmacological inhibitors has been challenging. Recently, potent and selective small-molecule MDM2 inhibitors have been identified. Studies with these compounds have strengthened the concept that selective, non-genotoxic p53 activation is a viable alternative to current cytotoxic chemotherapy but clinical validation is still pending. Here, the new developments in the quest for pharmacological p53 activators are reviewed with an emphasis on small-molecule inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 interaction.", 
    "108": "Extracts of five medicinal plants: Boscia angustifolia, Cissus quadrangularis, Securidaca longipedunculata, Stylosanthes erecta and Trichilia emetica, used traditionally in Malian traditional medicine were screened for in vitro antiplasmodial activity and GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor binding activity. Four extracts showed significant antiplasmodial activities, with the dichloromethane extract of leaf of Securidaca longipedunculata being the most active (IC(50) of 7 microg/ml [95% CI: 5-9]). The dichloromethane extract of leaf of Trichilia emetica, in addition to its antiplasmodial activity (IC(50): 12 microg/ml [95% CI: 12-14]), exhibited a good binding activity to the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor, while water and methanol extracts of the same plant did not show any activity. A strong GABA(A)-receptor complex binding activity was observed in the methanol extract of aerial part of Stylosanthes erecta. The results in this study justify some of the traditional indications of the plants investigated and may thus be candidates for Improved Traditional Medicines in Mali.", 
    "109": "Neurobiological studies hypothesize a common final pathway of addictive behavior in the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. Nicotine has been shown to sensitize the reward pathway, thereby causing increased drug-seeking behavior. Since there is evidence to suggest that nicotine, alcohol and other psychoactive substances act on the same final pathway and seem to augment their effects in animal subjects, drug intake behavior of humans would likely be reflected in increased substance use of nicotine-dependent persons. We used biological markers of substance use as well as questionnaires to assess the levels of psychoactive substance use among 18-year-old males in a naturalistic cross-sectional setting. We found that increasing levels of nicotine dependence were related to higher levels of alcohol abuse and dependence. Furthermore, higher levels of nicotine dependence were associated with elevated levels of recent cannabinoid use.", 
    "110": "A quality control procedure has been developed for the determination of diazepam in pharmaceuticals using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The method involves the off-line extraction of diazepam with chloroform by sonication and direct determination in the extracts through peak area measurement in the interval between 1672 and 1682 cm(-1) using a baseline correction defined between 1850 and 1524 cm(-1). For standardization it was used an external calibration line established from standard solutions of diazepam in chloroform. The method provides a limit of detection of 0.04 mg per tablet (n=5), a relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of 0.5% for 5 independent measurements of a standard solution at a concentration level of 0.76 mg g(-1) and a sampling frequency of the whole procedure of 4 h(-1), being required only 45 s for the measurement step. Results obtained by FTIR agree with those obtained by a reference methodology based on ultraviolet spectrometry and thus the developed procedure offers a good alternative for the determination of diazepam in pharmaceuticals.",

We report on a patient with alprazolam dependence, who initially was treated with carbamazepine because of severe withdrawal symptoms. Due to liver enzyme elevation related to carbamazepine, we had to stop this treatment and instead of that started gabapentin treatment. Under this new therapy, the patient showed a dramatic relief of withdrawal symptoms and of the panic attacks recurring during withdrawal. Hence, due to their effectiveness and tolerability, newer anticonvulsants could be considered as medication for benzodiazepine withdrawal and as an alternative for benzodiazepine treatment in panic disorders.",

A workgroup devoted to this topic was formed and met on September 9-10, 2005, in San Francisco. This workgroup was devoted to the discussion of when it would be appropriate to conduct additional genetic toxicology studies, as well as what type of studies, if the initial standard battery of tests was negative, but tumor formation was observed in the rodent carcinogenicity assessment. The important role of the standard genetic toxicology testing to determine the mode of action (MOA) for carcinogenesis (genotoxic versus non-genotoxic) was discussed, but the limitations of the standard testing were also reviewed. The workgroup also acknowledged that the entire toxicological profile (e.g. structure-activity relationships, the nature of the tumor finding and metabolic profiles) of a compound needed to be taken into consideration before the conduct of any additional testing. As part of the meeting, case studies were discussed to understand the practical application of additional testing as well as to form a decision tree. Finally, suitable additional genetic toxicology assays to help determine the carcinogenic MOA or establish a weight of evidence (WOE) argument were discussed and formulated into a decision tree.",

    "147": "Major depression and suicide are associated with altered concentrations of specific noradrenergic proteins in the human locus coeruleus (LC). Based on experimental studies that can reproduce these LC abnormalities in laboratory animals, we hypothesized that noradrenergic pathobiology in depression is a result of overactivity of the LC. LC activity is under the control of both excitatory and inhibitory inputs. A major inhibitory input to the LC is GABAergic, arising from the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi. Numerous studies demonstrating low levels of GABA in the CSF and plasma of subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) raise the possibility that LC overactivity in depression may be secondary to reduced GABAergic input to the LC. Here, GABAergic input to the LC in depression was evaluated by studying the binding of [(3)H]flunitrazepam to GABA(A) receptors at three anatomically defined levels of the human postmortem LC. LC tissues were collected from subjects with MDD, subjects with depressive disorders including MDD that died as a result of suicide, and psychiatrically normal control subjects. A modest rostral-caudal gradient of GABA(A) receptor binding density was observed among all subjects. No significant differences in the amount of binding to GABA(A) receptors were observed between control subjects (n=21) and MDD subjects (n=9) or depressed suicide victims (n=17). These results demonstrate that GABA(A) receptor binding in the LC measured with [(3)H]flunitrazepam is not altered in subjects with depressive illnesses.", 
    "148": "Views on the etiology and morbidities associated with insomnia are evolving and affect clinicians' approach to the pharmacologic management of insomnia. Currently, benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BzRAs) and a single melatonin receptor agonist are recognized as safe and efficacious hypnotics. Variability in BzRAs, pharmacokinetics, and manipulation of dose provide clinicians with options that meet the needs of most patients. Other drugs (eg, sedating antidepressants) also are used commonly in clinical practice to treat insomnia, but evidence is lacking to support this most cases. Improvement in managing insomnia will result from systematic research with these drugs, with drugs in development, and with novel uses, such as co-therapy.", 
    "149": "The aim of the study was to examine the efficacy and safety of temazepam on nocturnal oxygenation and next-day performance at altitude. A double-blind, randomized, cross-over trial was performed in Thirty-three healthy volunteers. Volunteers took 10 mg of temazepam and placebo in random order on two successive nights soon after arrival at 5000 m, following a 17-day trek from 410 m. Overnight SaO(2) and body movements, and next-day reaction time, maintenance of wakefulness and cognition were assessed. Compared with placebo, temazepam resulted in a reduction in periodic breathing from a median (range) of 16 (0-81.3)% of the night to 9.4 (0-79.6)% (P = 0.016, Wilcoxon's signed-rank test), associated with a small but significant decrease in mean nocturnal SaO(2) from 78 (65-84)% to 76 (64-83)% (P = 0.013). There was no change in sleep latency (P = 0.40) or restlessness (P = 0.30). Temazepam had no adverse effect on next-day reaction time [241 (201-380) ms postplacebo and 242 (204-386) ms post-temazepam], maintenance of wakefulness (seven trekkers failed to maintain 40 min of wakefulness postplacebo, and four post-temazepam), cognition or acute mountain sickness. At high altitude temazepam reduces periodic breathing during sleep without an adverse effect on next-day reaction time, maintenance of wakefulness or cognition. The 2% reduction in mean SaO(2) post-temazepam is likely to be predominantly because of acclimatization, as by chance more trekkers took temazepam on the first night (19 versus 14). We conclude that at high altitude temazepam is effective in reducing periodic breathing, and is safe to use, without any adverse effect upon next-day performance.", 
    "150": "Benzodiazepines are privileged scaffolds in medicinal chemistry, but enantiopure examples containing quaternary stereogenic centers are extremely rare. We demonstrate that installation of the di(p-anisyl)methyl (DAM) group at N1 of 1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones and 1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5-diones derived from enantiopure proteinogenic amino acids allows retentive replacement of the C3-proton via a deprotonation/trapping protocol. A wide variety of carbon and nitrogen electrophiles function well in this reaction, providing the corresponding quaternary benzodiazepines with excellent enantioselectivity. Deprotonation/trapping experiments on a pair of diastereomeric 1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5-diones provide evidence for a key role of conformational chirality in these enantioselective reactions. Acidic removal of the DAM group is fast and high-yielding and can be performed selectively in the presence of a N-Boc indole. Thus the synthesis of quaternary benzodiazepines with diverse N1 functionality can now be accomplished.", 
    "151": "The application of atmospheric pressure desorption/ionization on silicon (AP-DIOS) coupled with ion trap mass spectrometry (ITMS) was investigated for the quantification of midazolam in rat plasma, and determination of midazolam 1'-hydroxylation kinetics in pooled human liver microsomes. Results indicate good sensitivity with absolute detection limits for midazolam in rat plasma of approximately 300 femtograms. A linear dynamic range from approximately 10-5000 ng/mL was obtained in rat plasma with analysis times of 1 min per sample. Kinetic constants for midazolam 1'-hydroxylation in human liver microsomes yielded an apparent Km of 10.0 microM and Vmax of 6.4 nmol/min/mg. Studies investigating the inhibition of 1'-hydroxymidazolam formation by the cytochrome P450 3A4 model inhibitor ketoconazole yielded an IC50 of 0.03 microM. Quantitative precision for replicate analysis of rat plasma and human liver microsomal samples was variable with relative standard deviation (RSD) values ranging from a low of approximately 3% to over 50%, with the highest variability observed in data from human liver microsomal incubations. While preliminary studies investigating the application of AP-DIOS-ITMS suggested feasibility of this technique to typical pharmacokinetic applications, further work is required to understand the underlying causes for the high variability observed in these investigations.", 
    "152": "Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug approved for acute and long-term treatment of bipolar disorder. Although relatively safe as compared to other classical antipsychotic medications, there are a number of uncommon adverse effects of olanzapine such as oral cavity lesions. In addition to the relatively common side effect of dry mouth, several articles have reported an association between olanzapine treatment and the development of oral lesions such as apthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, glossitis and oral ulceration. Although there are several cases in which the tongue was affected in conjunction with stomatitis or pharyngitis, we could not find a case report indicating a direct relationship between olanzapine use and a tongue lesion. We present here the case of a patient with bipolar disorder, who developed recurrent black hairy tongue on two different occasions following the addition of olanzapine to lithium treatment. In the present case, xerostomia (dry mouth), which is an adverse reaction of both olanzapine and lithium, may have played a role in the development of black hairy tongue. All agents with a possible side effect of xerostomia may predispose patients to black hairy tongue, especially when they are administered in combination.

The use of z-hypnotics has had a steady and large increase since their introduction in Norway, and sales data suggest extensive use among the elderly. The relatively short half-lives of these drugs may cause less hangover effects, but z-hypnotics are hardly more effective or safer than benzodiazepines. The two classes of drugs should be prescribed with similar caution.", 
    "154": "Isobolographic analysis was used to characterize the interactions between stiripentol (STP) and clonazepam (CZP), ethosuximide (ETS), phenobarbital (PB), and valproate (VPA) in suppressing pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced clonic seizures in mice.", 
    "155": "The anticonvulsant and acute adverse (neurotoxic) effects of STP in combination with the various conventional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), at fixed ratios of 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1, were evaluated in the PTZ and chimney tests in mice using the isobolographic analysis. Additionally, protective indices (PI) and benefit indices (BI) were calculated to identify their pharmacological profiles so that a ranking in relation to advantageous combination could be established. Moreover, adverse-effect paradigms were determined by use of the step-through passive avoidance task (long-term memory), threshold for the first pain reaction, grip-strength test (neuromuscular tone), and the hot plate test (acute thermal pain). Brain AED concentrations were also measured so as to ascertain any pharmacokinetic contribution to the pharmacodynamic interactions.", 
    "156": "All AED combinations comprising of STP and CZP, ETS, PB, and VPA (at the fixed ratios of 1:3, 1:1 and 3:1) were additive in terms of clonic seizure suppression in the PTZ test. However, these interactions were complicated by changes in brain AED concentrations consequent to pharmacokinetic interactions. Thus STP significantly increased total brain ETS and PB concentrations, and decreased VPA concentrations, but was without effect on CZP concentrations. In contrast, PB significantly decreased and VPA increased total brain STP concentrations while CZP and ETS were without effect. Furthermore, while isobolographic analysis revealed that STP and CZP in combination, at the fixed ratios of 1:1 and 3:1, were supraadditive (synergistic; p < 0.05), the combinations of STP with CZP (1:3), ETS, PB, or VPA (at all fixed ratios of 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1) were barely additivity in terms of acute neurotoxic adverse effects in the chimney test. Additionally, none of the examined combinations of STP with conventional AEDs (CZP, ETS, PB, VPA--at their median effective doses from the PTZ-test) affected long-term memory, threshold for the first pain reaction, neuromuscular tone, and acute thermal pain.", 
    "157": "Based on BI values, the combination of STP with PB at the fixed ratio of 1:3 appears to be a particularly favourable combination. In contrast, STP and CZP or ETS (at the fixed ratios of 1:1 and 3:1) were unfavorable combinations. However, these conclusions are confounded by the fact that STP is associated with significant pharmacokinetic interactions. The remaining combinations of STP with PB (1:1 and 3:1), CZP (1:3), ETS (1:3), and VPA (at all fixed ratios of 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1) do not appear to be potential favorable AED combinations.",

    "163": "Atypical antipsychotic drugs are widely used in the treatment of schizophrenia. These agents are discovered to have some additional beneficial effects beyond their effectiveness as antipsychotic drugs. Among these initially unexpected effects are their potential effects as mood stabilizers in bipolar disorder and their efficacy in improving long-term outcome in schizophrenia. These effects recently raised the question whether these drugs may also have some neuroprotective effect in the brain. To examine this matter, in this study we evaluated the neuroprotective effect of olanzapine after permanent focal cerebral ischemia. Anaesthetized male C57BL/6j mice were submitted to permanent thread occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Olanzapine (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) or vehicle was applied intraperitoneally just after permanent ischemia. Twenty-four hours after permanent ischemia, brain injury was evaluated by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining (TTC). Olanzapine (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) showed significant neuroprotection after permanent focal cerebral ischemia.",

Zolpidem was administered intraperitoneally in dose 10 mg/kg of BW and 60 min later the animals were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with fixative. The Fos/OXY co-labelings were analyzed on 40 microm thick serial coronal sections using computerized light microscopy. Zolpidem elicited a concordant Fos/OXY staining in all four PVN sub-areas investigated, including the anterior (15.71+/-2.35%), middle (14.52+/-2.53%), dorsal (13.34+/-2.61%), and periventricular (18.21+/-4.75%) ones, however, had no significant stimulatory effect on OXY cells in the SON. In response to Zolpidem, statistically significant activations were also seen in certain groups of accessory structures including the circular nucleus (13.99+/-3.43%), small clusters of accessory neurons (10.55+/-1.94%), and the lateral hypothalamic perivascular nucleus (9.42+/-2.74%). Between the naive and vehicle controls, the dual Fos/OXY labelings did not elicit any significant differences. Our data provide insight into the topographic patterns of brain activity within the clusters of magnocellular OXY cells in the hypothalamus associated with stimulation of GABA(A) benzodiazepine receptors and for the first time illustrate the triggering contemporaneousness within the cells of the principal and accessory magnocellular nuclei in response to Zolpidem treatment. The present study provides a comparative background that may help in the further understanding of a possible extend of Zolpidem effect on the brain.",

Therefore, MDR1 gene variants were proposed as potential susceptibility factors for diseases and as determinants of treatment response to various drugs. We investigated the relationships between exon 21 G2677T and exon 26 C3435T genetic variants of MDR1 gene with susceptibility and treatment response in female schizophrenic patients. The study was conducted in two steps. We first compared allele, genotype and haplotype distributions between 117 female schizophrenic patients and 123 control female subjects. Afterwards, we studied treatment response to olanzapine, in 87 out of 117 previously unmedicated female patients. Overall, we found lower representation of G2677/C3435 haplotype in schizophrenic female patients compared to controls. Test result for linkage disequilibrium between loci was found to be significant. Furthermore, we found significant associations between MDR1 exon 21 G2677T genotypes and treatment response measured with positive PANSS percentage changes, with T allele and TT genotype being associated with significantly better treatment response. A borderline, non-significant statistical association was found between MDR1 exon 26 C3435T genotypes and treatment response, with TT genotype being associated with better treatment response. Our data support functional importance of the MDR1 mutations for the susceptibility and treatment response in female schizophrenic patients.",

    "172": "Clinically most active anxiolytic drugs are positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of GABA(A) receptors, represented by benzodiazepine compounds. Due to their non-selective profile, however, they potently modulate several sup-type specific GABA(A) receptors, contributing to their broad-range side effects. Based on observations in genetically altered mice, however, it has been proposed that anxiolytic action of benzodiazepines is predominantly mediated by GABA(A) alpha2/3 subunit-containing receptors. In the present study we analyzed the actions of the preferential GABA(A) alpha1 and alpha2/3 PAMs, zolpidem and L-838417, respectively on hippocampal EEG and medial septum neuronal activity in anesthetized rats. In parallel, a computational model was constructed to model pharmacological actions of these compounds on the septo-hippocampal circuitry. The present results demonstrated that zolpidem inhibited theta oscillation both in the hippocampus and septum, and profoundly inhibited firing activity of septal neurons. L-838417 also inhibited hippocampal and septal theta oscillation, however, it did not significantly alter firing rate activity of septal neurons. Our computational model showed that cessation of periodic firing of hippocampo-septal neurons, representing absence of hippocampal theta activity, disrupted oscillation of septal units, without altering their overall firing activity, similar to changes observed in our in vivo experiments following administration of L-838417. Understanding the correlation between changes in septo-hippocampal activity and actions of selective modulators of GABA(A) subtype receptor modulators would further advance design of anxiolytic drugs.", 
    "173": "Functional roles of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the regulation of mouse stomach motility were examined using mice genetically lacking muscarinic M(2) receptor and/or M(3) receptor and their corresponding wild-type (WT) mice. Single application of carbachol (1 nM-30 microM) produced concentration-dependent contraction in antral and fundus strips from muscarinic M(2) receptor knockout (M(2)R-KO) and M(3) receptor knockout (M(3)R-KO) mice but not in those from M(2) and M(3) receptors double knockout (M(2)/M(3)R-KO) mice. A comparison of the concentration-response curves with those for WT mice showed a significant decrease in the negative logarithm of EC(50) (pEC(50)) value (M(2)R-KO) or amplitude of maximum contraction (M(3)R-KO) in the muscarinic receptor-deficient mice. The tonic phase of carbachol-induced contraction was decreased in gastric strips from M(3)R-KO mice. Antagonistic affinity for 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine (4-DAMP) or 11-([2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperdinyl]acetyl)-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX116) indicated that the contractile responses in M(2)R-KO and M(3)R-KO mice were mediated by muscarinic M(3) and M(2) receptors, respectively. Electrical field stimulation (EFS, 0.5-32 Hz) elicited frequency-dependent contraction in physostigmine- and N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methylester (l-NAME)-treated fundic and antral strips from M(2)R-KO and M(3)R-KO mice, but the cholinergic contractile components decreased significantly compared with those in WT mice. In gastric strips from M(2)/M(3)R-KO mice, cholinergic contractions elicited by EFS were not observed but atropine-resistant contractions were more conspicuous than those in gastric strips from WT mice. Gastric emptying in WT mice and that in M(2)/M(3)R-KO mice were comparable, suggesting that motor function of the stomach in the KO mice did not differ from that in the WT mice. The results indicate that both muscarinic M(2) and M(3) receptors but not other subtypes mediate carbachol- or EFS-induced contraction in the mouse stomach but that the contribution of each receptor to concentration-response relationships is distinguishable. Although there was impairment of nerve-mediated cholinergic responses in the stomach of KO mice, gastric emptying in KO mice was the same as that in WT mice probably due to the compensatory enhancement of the non-cholinergic contraction pathway.",

    "178": "The abuse of anabolic-androgenic steroids (AS) is a growing problem; however, the effects and mechanisms underlying their addictive effects are not well understood. Research findings regarding androgen abuse in people and hedonic effects of androgens in laboratory rats are reviewed. Androgens, like other steroids, can have traditional actions via cognate intracellular steroid receptors, as well as other substrates. Our recent results indicate that testosterone (T) metabolites may have actions in part via gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A)/benzodiazepine receptor complexes (GBRs) and/or dopaminergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens, to mediate T's positive hedonic states. This may provide the basis for positive reinforcing effects of androgen seeking and use behavior. Following a comprehensive review of the background literature, our findings are presented that have explored the extent to which metabolites of T mediate euphorogenic effects of androgens by acting in the nucleus accumbens. Then results regarding whether GBRs are necessary substrates for androgens' positive hedonic effects are discussed. Lastly, research that addresses if dopaminergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens are necessary for these effects of androgens are discussed. This review provides a comprehensive examination of the hedonic properties and abuse/addiction potential of androgens and the putative mechanisms underlying these effects.",
