The concentrations of unchanged flunitrazepam in sea were determined by 63Ni-EC-GLC, and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using the two-compartment open model. Age as such had no effect on the kinetics of flunitrazepam, but its sedative effect was clearly increased in the group over 60. No correlation between the serum level or elimination half-life and sedation was found. Generally, flunitrazepam's strong and rapid sedative effect renders it a useful adjuvant in connection with epidural anesthesia.", 
    "1": "An investigation of the following psychoactive drugs: barbiturate, benzodiazepine, meprobamate, methaqualone and phenothiazine, was performed on all automobile occupants killed in accidents in southern Sweden during 1977 and 1978. Of 122 drivers and 55 passengers analysed, low concentrations of these drugs were found in nine drivers and in five passengers. Thus, 7.3% of the drivers were driving under the influence of drugs and, of these, two drivers (1.6% of all analysed drivers) were also inebriated. Twenty-three per cent of the drivers were inebriated only. According to the circumstances in the accidents and the number of drivers whose analyses proved positive, drug influence seldom seems to be the cause of fatal traffic accidents.", 
    "2": "In a double blind, randomized clinical study eighteen volunteers received either placebo or 5 mg diazepam or 5 mg clotiazepam at three different times at an interval of one week. Beside other parameters which have been measured a 60-minute polygraphic EEG recording was made thirty minutes after administration of the drugs. The vigilosomnograms revealed clear and reliable differences between placebo and the two active substances and suggest a sedative effect of both substances at the dose level used. There was only a slight difference between the two active substances. 5 mg clotiazepam produced a slightly stronger sedation than 5 mg diazepam. However, the records of autonomic side effects and subjective statements regarding the patients' condition showed that clotiazepam is associated with less side effects than diazepam.", 
    "3": "Earlier observations have shown that septal lesions released operant responding punished by foot-shock, but did not change behavior punished by electrical stimulation of the dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG) substance of the rat brain. In contrast, chlordiazepoxide facilitated both kinds of punished responding. In order to further study the mechanism of brain stimulation punishment, dose-response curves of two minor tranquilizers, chlordiazepoxide and pentobarbital, of two tryptamine antagonists, methysergide and cyproheptadine as well as of amphetamine on lever-pressing behavior of rats maintained by water reinforcement and punished by DPAG stimulation were determined. A multiple schedule with a variable-interval 2 min (VI 2) non-punished component and a continuous reinforcement (CRF) component in which every response was both rewarded and punished was used. Chlordiazepoxide and pentobarbital caused dose-dependent increases in punished responding. Unpunished VI response rates were also moderately increased by the minor tranquilizers. In contrast, neither methysergide nor cyproheptadine increased punished or unpunished responding at doses that have been previously shown to markedly release behavior punished by foot-shock, in the rat. Conversely, amphetamine, a drug that usually does not release responding punished by peripheral noxious stimulation, caused dose-dependent increases in responding suppressed by DPAG punishment without affecting VI response rate. These and previous results with septal lesions suggest that neither the septo-hippocampal system nor its serotonergic input from the mesencephalon mediate response suppression by DPAG electrical stimulation, in contrast to their active role in peripheral punishment. This difference may also explain the marked facilitatory effect of amphetamine on responding punished by brain stimulation shown by the present results.", 
    "4": "The effect of cimetidine on the metabolism of benzodiazepines is discussed. Studies of cimetidine's inhibition of benzodiazepine metabolism by liver microsomal enzyme pathways are described. Cimetidine is known to have this effect on the metabolism of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, and because chlorazepate and prazepam are similarly metabolized, cimetidine is likely to have the same effect on the metabolism of these drugs. Oxazepam and lorazepam are two benzodiazepines not metabolized by liver microsomal enzymes, but are thought to be glucuronidated in peripheral tissue by glucuronyl transferase. Cimetidine has been shown not to alter the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam or oxazepam when administered concurrently with either of these benzodiazepines. When it is necessary to treat a patients receiving cimetidine with a benzodiazepine, oxazepam or lorazepam may be the drug of choice.", 
    "5": "Cimetidine has been shown to inhibit the liver microsomal metabolism of the benzodiazepines diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, resulting in an increase in half-life and decrease in the clearance of these two drugs. Patients receiving the combination of diazepam and cimetidine have been noted to be more sedated than when given an equal dose of diazepam alone. Many benzodiazepines undergo N-dealkylation and hydroxylation via the cytochrome P450 oxidase system. Cimetidine is thought to bind to cytochrome P450 oxidase and to interfere with many drugs using this path way. Oxazepam and lorazepam are two benzodiazepines not oxidatively metabolized by cytochrome P450, but are glucuronidated by glucuronyl transferase and are, therefore, not subject to metabolic inhibition by cimetidine. Thus, when clinically indicated, oxazepam and lorazepam may be the benzodiazepines of choice to use in combination with cimetidine to eliminate the clinically significant drug interaction seen with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide.", 
    "6": "Both alprazolam and diazepam were superior to placebo for the treatment of the clinical anxiety syndrome throughout a four-week double-blind multiclinic trial in 976 outpatients. At the fourth-week evaluation of the 845 patients completing the study, the 326 patients receiving alprazolam showed significantly more improvement than the 344 patients receiving diazepam on all 4 anxiety rating scales utilized (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Physician's Global Assessment, Patient's Global Assessment, and Target Symptoms).", 
    "7": "Alprazolam is a triazolobenzodiazepine, a derivative of the benzodiazepines. Comparison studies of alprazolam and diazepam or chlordiazepoxide in patients suffering from clinical anxiety secondary to anxiety neurosis or chronic alcohol withdrawal suggest an equal efficacy of those agents. Studies examining the use of alprazolam for the treatment of \"primary depression\" suggest that it is as effective as imipramine in the treatment of exogenous (reactive) depression. Although alprazolam may be effective in patients with exogenous depression, no extrapolation can be made to the treatment of endogenous depression. Mechanisms of action have not been fully elucidated, but probably are similar to those of other benzodiazepines. Peak blood levels are reached in 0.7-1.6 hours and the elimination half-life after steady state is approximately 19 hours. Daily dosages established from clinical studies ranged from 1 to 6 mg. Clinically, alprazolam appears to be ten times more potent than diazepam. Drowsiness, headaches, lightheadedness, dry mouth, and depression appear to be the most common side effects of the drug. It is concluded that alprazolam offers no striking therapeutic advantage over currently marketed benzodiazepines.", 
    "8": "The kinetics of single 30-mg oral doses of oxazepam were determined in 22 male and nine female volunteers aged 20-86 years. Oxazepam plasma concentrations were measured in multiple plasma samples drawn during 36 h after each dose. Mean kinetic variables in males and females, respectively, were: elimination half-life, 7.5 and 8.5 h; volume of distribution, 0.96 and 1.17 l/kg; clearance, 1.48 and 1.70 ml/min/kg. Sex differences were not significant, nor were any of the kinetic variables significantly related to age. However, oxazepam clearance increased significantly with heavier cigarette smoking (r = 0.48, p less than 0.01). Mean clearance in smokers (1.98 ml/min/kg) was significantly higher than in nonsmokers (1.23 ml/min/kg, p less than 0.01). Thus, smoking is a more important determinant of oxazepam clearance than age or sex.", 
    "9": "In this paper it is shown that the postsynaptic GABA-receptor chloride ion channel complex is composed of several functional subunits. There are probably at least two stereospecific locations on the receptor for GABA-binding and both must be occupied to obtain an increase in chloride conductance. The interaction between these sites is uncertain but there could be either positive cooperativity between the sites or only a requirement that both sites are occupied without occupation of either site affecting the affinity for GABA of the other site. There is a chloride conductance channel coupled to the GABA receptor which opens for an average of 20 msec and has an average conductance of 18 pS. The GABA-coupled chloride channel may or may not have the same composition as the glycine coupled chloride channel. In addition to the GABA-recognition site and the chloride ion channel, GABA-receptors must have additional binding sites or modulator sites where drugs can bind to modify GABA activation of the GABA receptor. The convulsant PICRO binds to a site which is independent of the GABA site and PICRO reduces GABA responses. Barbiturates and benzodiazepines augment GABA-responses without reducing GABA-binding and thus they must bind to a modulator site independent of the GABA recognition site. Whether or not this is the same site as the PICRO binding site is uncertain. Thus, the GABA-receptor-chloride ion channel complex is composed of at least: 1) two GABA-binding sites; 2) a chloride ion channel; 3) a convulsant binding site (PICRO-binding site) and 4) an anticonvulsant binding site. This organization serves several obvious purposes. First, since two GABA-molecules are required to activate GABA-coupled chloride ion channels, the dose-response relationship for GABA is sigmoidal and steep. Thus minor shifts in GABA affinity will produce large alterations in GABA-responses and the GABA receptor can be easily modulated. Second, since the receptors has binding sites for convulsant and anticonvulsant compounds which decrease and increase GABA-responses, GABAergic inhibition can easily be modulated.", 
    "10": "This review describes the development of GABA receptor agonists with no detectable affinity for other recognition sites in GABA-mediated synapses. The key compounds are THIP, isoguvacine, and piperidine-4-sulphonic acid (P4S), developed via extensive structural modifications of the potent but not strictly specific GABA agonist muscimol. The structural parameters, which have to be considered in the design of GABA agonists are discussed on the basis of the structures and biological activities of these GABA agonists and a number of related compounds. A model, which summarizes our present knowledge of the structure of the postsynaptic GABA receptors complex, is presented, and the interaction of GABA agonists with various sites in this complex is discussed. Of particular interest are the effects of GABA agonists on the binding of diazepam to the benzodiazepine binding site, assumed to be a structural unit of the GABA receptor complex. While rigid molecules like THIP are capable of activating the GABA receptors, a certain degree of conformational mobility of GABA agonists apparently is a prerequisite for stimulation of diazepam binding in vitro at 0 degree C. The findings suggest that GABA receptor functions involve conformational changes of certain elements, including the attempts to develop GABA agonists with desirable pharmacokinetic and toxicological characteristics. While muscimol is a toxic compound, THIP is well tolerated by animals, and in contrast to isoguvacine, THIP penetrates into the brain after systemic administration to animals, a difference which can be explained on the basis of their protolytic properties. The attempts to develop pro-drugs of isoguvacine capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier with subsequent decomposition in the brain tissue to isoguvacine are described.", 
    "11": "The effects of chronic exposure of primary dissociated cerebral cortical cells in culture to the anticonvulsant drug phenytoin have been investigated using benzodiazepine binding techniques. By separating benzodiazepine binding into pharmacologically distinct subtypes, the data indicate that clonazepam-displaceable benzodiazepine binding (associated primarily with neuronal membranes) is significantly decreased by exposure to therapeutic and toxic doses of phenytoin while R05-4864-displaceable benzodiazepine binding (associated principally with non-neuronal elements) is enhanced. The ratio of clonazepam-displaceable to R05-4864-displaceable benzodiazepine binding appears to be the most sensitive indicator for these changes.", 
    "12": "A 51-year-old male patient with no history of musculo-skeletal or myopathic abnormalities, but suffering from manic-depressive psychosis, attempted suicide with an overdose of dolpersin hydrochloride (Mydocalm), dipenzepine hydrochloride (Noveril), meprobamate (Mepronox) and nitrazepam (Mogadon). He developed high fever, muscle rigidity, tachycardia, arrhythmias, hypotension and mottled cyanosis, symptoms well-known in persons with malignant hyperthermia, an autosomally inherited disease of skeletal muscle. There is also discussed the manifestation and the symptoms of an acute rhabdomyolysis. The diagnosis was confirmed by chemical pathological laboratory findings, including respiratory and metabolic acidosis, myoglobinaemia accompanied by myoglobin diuresis, and elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK values up to 2790 U/l). Electron microscopic examination of muscle tissue revealed signs of myolysis and mitochondrial reactions with pleoconic hyperplasia. No inhalation anaesthetics or skeletal muscle relaxants, such as succinyl choline, were used in this case. Therefore, malignant hyperthermia might have been induced by a combination of drugs which were not known to induce this abnormal muscular reaction. However, the muscle relaxant effect of dolpersin hydrochloride may have acted as a possible inducer of the attack.", 
    "13": "The binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to benzodiazepine receptors in synaptic membranes and a digitonin-solubilized receptor fraction of rat brain is increased by avermectin B1a and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The effects of avermectin B1a and GABA are both sensitive to inhibition by (+)-bicuculline. Avermectin B1a and GABA both decrease the Kd and increase the Bmax of [3H]flunitrazepam binding to membranes. Kinetic analysis of the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to rat brain membranes indicates that avermectin B1a and GABA reduce the rate constants of both association and dissociation between the ligand and the receptor. These results suggest a similar mechanism of modulation of benzodiazepine binding by avermectin B1a and GABA. This modulation may involve in interaction among the receptors for benzodiazepine, GABA and avermectin B1a.", 
    "14": "Two thousand two hundred and four patients with acute poisoning admitted between 1970 and 1979 to an acute District Medical Unit were reviewed with special regard to the serious medical consequences of overdosage. The incidence of barbiturate and methaqualone poisonings declined but benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and dextroproproxyphene were more commonly taken. As a result, there was no overall change in the proportion of patients admitted unconscious or requiring respiratory support. The dangers of dextropropoxyphene poisoning have become increasingly apparent, and poisoning with paracetamol has become as frequent as salicylate poisoning. In view of these changing trends, measures to limit the morbidity and mortality from self-poisoning are suggested.", 
    "15": "Patients undergoing surgery under regional anaesthesia often receive narcotic analgesics for premedication which may modify the sedative and amnesic effects of intravenously administered diazepam. Sixty-two patients scheduled for upper extremity surgery under intravenous regional anaesthesia received 0.15 mg/kg of diazepam intravenously to supplement the local anaesthesia. Thirty-two of the patients received 0.01 mg/kg of atropine plus 1 mg/kg of pethidine and 30 patients only atropine intramuscularly approximately 1 h before injection of diazepam. Another 30 patients received the same atropine-pethidine premedication and saline intravenously, and served as a reference group. Atropine-pethidine premedication followed by saline did not produce any amnesic effects. Sixty-nine and 38% of patients receiving atropine-pethidine premedication followed by diazepam did not remember a picture shown to them 15 min after diazepam injection or the performance of operation, respectively, the respective figures for patients given atropine premedication followed by diazepam being only 23% and 0% (P less than 0.01 - 0.001 between groups). The anti-recall of painful stimulus (exanguination) was significantly (P less than 0.01) more common when diazepam was given after pethidine premedication (31%) when compared to its injection after atropine alone (7%). The drowsiness produced by the drugs was greatest and the overall patient acceptability of the technique used most satisfactory when pethidine was used for premedication and diazepam for sedation. It is concluded that intramuscularly administered pethidine potentiates the amnesic action of intravenous diazepam for painful stimuli, prolongs the amnesic action of diazepam for visual stimuli and improves the patients' acceptability of intravenous regional anesthesia supplemented by intravenous diazepam.", 
    "16": "Twenty patients, aged 21 to 48 years and rated ASA physical status I, were studied during ophthalmic surgery. Ten subjects (Group I) received thiopentone, halothane and nitrous oxide in oxygen, and ten (Group II) received total intravenous anaesthesia, using flunitrazepam and ketamine. Ventilation was controlled mechanically with the aid of a muscle relaxant. Both anaesthetic techniques caused a significant decrease in intraocular pressure. After an initial decline in systolic arterial pressure and an increase in heart rate, cardiovascular status was well maintained in the two series. Side effects were uncommon with both techniques. Balanced total intravenous anaesthesia with flunitrazepam, ketamine and relaxant appears to offer a safe alternative to conventional inhalation narcosis for intraocular surgery.", 
    "17": "The possibility of an interaction between diazepam and pancuronium bromide was investigated in six patients undergoing general anaesthesia maintained with fentanyl, droperidol and nitrous oxide. Neuromuscular blockade was controlled using a feedback mechanism which automatically adjusted the rate of injection of pancuronium to maintain between 71.4 and 72.9% blockade. Diazepam 0.14 mg kg-1 i.v. produced blood concentrations within the therapeutic range, but did not produce consistent changes in the level of blockade, pancuronium concentration in the blood or pancuronium consumption measured over 20 min.", 
    "18": "Morphine 10 mg or diazepam 10 mg or a mixture of morphine 5 mg and diazepam 5 mg were given i.m. to three groups of 35 patients for relief of pain in the period immediately after operation. The patients had undergone upper abdominal operation for which a uniform regime of premedication and anaesthesia had been used. Pain was assessed by an observer before and after treatment and by the subjects, using a five-point scoring scheme. The pain scores before treatment and at 30-, 60-, 90- and 120-min intervals after treatment were compared by Ridit analysis. All three treatments produced significant relief, but the relief after diazepam alone was not as long-lasting as after the other two treatments. No clinically significant cardiovascular or respiratory complications occurred. Diazepam alone was associated with significantly more restlessness and morphine alone was associated with significantly more sickness. The combination of morphine and diazepam was considered to be the treatment of choice.", 
    "19": "A total of 47 men who complained of recurrent voiding symptoms and/or peri-genital pain syndrome of obscure etiology underwent neuro-urologic evaluation. Results of urodynamic assessment were divided into 3 groups: bladder areflexia with nonrelaxing perineal floor (50 per cent), bladder hyperreflexia (36 per cent) and normal studies (14 per cent). Pain symptoms were reproduced during bladder filling or contraction in 45 per cent of the patients. Treatment was according to the type of urodynamic abnormality demonstrated, resulting in a 77 per cent improvement rate. The concept of functional voiding disturbance and its relation to chronic prostatitis are discussed.", 
    "20": "Withdrawal reactions were compared in C57BL/6J mice, which had been fed an ethanolic liquid diet containing chloridazepoxide (CDP, 3.2 or 6.4 mg/100 ml, group B or C, respectively) with those which had been administered an ethanol diet alone (group A) for 15 days. Group A showed a significantly more pronounced decrease in rectal temperature (4 to 10 hr) and a higher withdrawal score (4 to 14 hr) than mice in groups B and C. The differences in withdrawal signs still persisted even after mice were fed an ethanol diet without CDP for one extra day before withdrawal. The presence of metabolites of CDP in the blood during withdrawal could only account for a minor contribution to the protective effect. Our data are more suggestive of an increased rate of ethanol metabolism leading to lower blood alcohol levels during diet intake period as being the major factor. However we cannot rule out the alternative possibility that CDP or its metabolites might interfere with the development of tolerance to and physical dependence on alcohol.", 
    "21": "The present study evaluated the hemodynamic effects produced by the intravenous infusion of diazepam (0.5 mg/kg over 10 minutes) and the simultaneous inhalation of 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen administered to 19 patients with coronary artery disease who were receiving chronic propranolol therapy (106 +/- 67 mg/day). In addition, hemodynamic changes produced by direct laryngoscopy and intubation of the trachea were measured. Data during the induction of anesthesia were compared to measurements obtained in a previously reported group of similar patients anesthetized in the same manner but not receiving propranolol. In the present study, as in previously observed patients not receiving propranolol, induction of anesthesia with diazepam-nitrous oxide did not result in any significant change from awake measurements with respect to heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), or rate-pressure product (RPP). Cardiovascular responses were similar in patients with awake resting heart rates greater than 70 beats per minute (nine patients) and less than 70 beats pr minute (10 patients). This suggests that propranolol does not alter the benign hemodynamic effects produced by this type of induction of anesthesia. Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation significantly (p less than 0.01) increased MAP at 1 minute and HR and RPP at 1 and 2 minutes after the start of laryngoscopy. These changes were transient, returning to control values within 3 minutes after intubation. Patients with awake resting HR less than 70 beats per minute had greater increases in HR and RPP at 1 minute than did patients with resting HR greater than 70 beats per minute (p less than 0.05). This suggests that propranolol even in doses adequate to produce significant slowing of HR in awake patients does not ensure protection against increases in HR and MAP associated with laryngoscopy and intubation of the trachea.", 
    "22": "Psychosomatic dermatology is practiced in some manner by every dermatologist. In spite of this, there has been a virtual void in the literature from the middle 1950s until the present time. The relationship to physiologic phenomena, as well as a classification of psychosomatic dermatology, is reviewed. Dermatologic patients are divided into three groups: the primary group in which the emotional disorder is the primary disease and the cutaneous disorder merely part of its expression; the secondary group in which the basic cause is organic but does not affect the person emotionally in various degrees; and the collaborative group in which the organic causes and emotional disorders combine in different degrees to cause the skin disorder. This paper discusses anxiety and depression along with methods of dermatologic psychosomatic therapy consisting of antianxiety drugs, especially the benzodiazepines, antidepressants, hypnosis, behavior therapy, and the doctor/patient rapport. We conclude that one of the objectives for every dermatologist is to treat the entire patient-the psyche along with the soma.", 
    "23": "The antiepileptic properties of carbamazepine (Tegretol) and clonazepam (Rivotril) were compared in a double-blind randomized study comprising 36 patients with newly diagnosed, untreated psychomotor epilepsy (partial seizures with complex symptomatology). No significant differences were found between the two drugs during the 6 months of treatment. Measurements of concentrations in plasma confirmed that the patients exceeded the accepted lower limit for therapeutic range of the drugs.", 
    "24": "The anticonvulsant effects of the cannabinoid derivative levonantradol and its ability to potentiate the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam and valproic acid were studied in rats with previously established amygdala-kindled seizures. Levonantradol administered in doses of 100 to 400 micrograms/kg did not block any components of the motor seizure. However, levonantradol did increase the latency of appearance of fully kindled seizures at the 400 micrograms/kg dose. Administration of diazepam at doses of 1 or 2 mg/kg or valproic acid at doses of 100 or 200 mg/kg produced seizure control as measured by a reduction in motor components of the seizure or a reduction in afterdischarge length or both. The anticonvulsant effects of diazepam and valproic acid were potentiated by administration of 100 microgram/kg levonantradol without apparent increases in sedation. Although the mechanism underlying this potentiation of the antiepileptic effects of valproic acid and diazepam remains unknown, levonantradol may have potential as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of complex partial seizures.", 
    "25": "The evidence for the efficacy of anticonvulsant drugs in the control of seizures during alcohol withdrawal is examined. The literature on the use of anticonvulsants to control anxiety, irritability, tension, and other symptoms of abstinence syndrome is reviewed. The data on benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, hydroxyzine, and neuroleptics are discussed briefly. There is no evidence to support the routine use of phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis in detoxication. However, phenytoin may be valuable in patients at a high risk for seizures, such as skid-row alcoholics. Only one retrospective study has been done on primidone; it claimed primidone was an efficacious adjuvant. Carbamazepine and valproic acid may be useful in the treatment of anxiety, dysphoric mood, somatization, and other symptoms of abstinence syndrome, as well as for seizure prophylaxis. The benzodiazepines, diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, are recognized as primary therapeutic agents in the detoxication of alcoholic patients. The major difficulty with the use of phenobarbital is that it cannot be used over as wide a range as the benzodiazepines. Hydroxyzine has been shown to be inferior to chlorazepate dipotassium. Most neuroleptics appear to be inappropriate for detoxication because they lower the seizure threshold; however, haloperidol has been found efficacious in acutely abstinent alcoholics. Carbamazepine, valproic acid, primidone, and phenobarbital should be tested against standard drugs such as chlordiazepoxide and diazepam in the detoxication of alcoholic patients.", 
    "26": "Mice were injected with intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) kainic acid (KA; 0.1 micrograms per animal) and the pentetrazol test was carried out on the fifth day after the administration of the amino acid. The following antiepileptic drugs were tested for anticonvulsant activity in mice lesioned with KA: diazepam (0.4 mg/kg), phenobarbital (12.5 and 25 mg/kg), trimethadione (200 and 400 mg/kg), depakine (200 and 400 mg/kg), carbamazepine (10 and 20 mg/kg), lefadol (bromophenylsuccinimide; 20 mg/kg), and acetazolamide (320 mg/kg). All drugs were given intraperitoneally, except for carbamazepine, which was also given orally in doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg. Pentetrazol was administered subcutaneously in a dose of 110 mg/kg, and the animals were subsequently observed for the occurrence of clonic and tonic convulsions within 30 min. The protective effects of diazepam and phenobarbital were significantly reduced in the KA-lesioned animals, while the actions of the remaining anticonvulsants were unaltered. Moreover, a substantial loss of pyramidal cells in the CA 3 field of the hippocampus was noted after i.c.v. injection of KA. It may therefore be concluded that the mechanism of the action of diazepam and phenobarbital are partially dependent on the intact functions of the hippocampal formation.", 
    "27": "Fifteen out of 18 \"pink and puffing\" patients completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial of diazepam and promethazine for breathlessness and reduced exercise tolerance. Dosages were 25 mg and 125 mg daily, respectively, and each course lasted two weeks. Patients with psychiatric or other major medical histories were excluded. Of the three patients who did not complete the trial, one died during an exacerbation of breathlessness while taking diazepam, one was withdrawn because of mild hypercapnia while taking placebo, and one suffered intolerable drowsiness while taking diazepam. Of the remaining 15 patients, six needed a reduction in dosage because of drowsiness: one of these was taking promethazine and five diazepam. Diazepam had no effect on breathlessness and noticeably reduced exercise tolerance. Promethazine reduced breathlessness and improved exercise tolerance without altering lung function. From these results diazepam is contraindicated for breathlessness and reduced exercise tolerance in fixed airways obstruction, but promethazine may be beneficial.", 
    "28": "Vomiting accompanied by nausea is a serious acute toxicity which occurs after chemotherapy with virtually every class of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. The inability to adequately alleviate this toxicity may lead to serious complications such as general malaise, weight loss, and electrolyte imbalance. We have reviewed 34 studies in which more than 2200 cancer patients were administered 25 different antiemetics for treatment of chemotherapy-induced vomiting. All patients received a variety of cancer chemotherapeutic agents given either as single agents or in combination. The antiemetic agents included phenothiazines, antihistamines, anticholinergics, benzoquinolizines, barbiturates, butyrophenones, procainamides, cannabinoids, steroids, and benzodiazepines. It is apparent from these studies that the use of conventional antiemetic agents for treating cancer chemotherapy-induced vomiting is of marginal value, and the use of investigational antiemetic agents show conflicting results as to efficacy. More quantitative measures for evaluating emesis need to be defined, and the implications that a particular antiemetic therapy may be efficacious for some but not all classes of cancer chemotherapeutic agents need to be evaluated.", 
    "29": "The binding of radioactive piperidine-4-sulphonic acid ([3H]P4S) to thoroughly washed, frozen, and thawed membranes isolated from cow and rat brains has been studied. Quantitative computer analysis of the binding curves for four regions of bovine brain revealed the general presence of two binding sites. In these brain regions less satisfactory computer fits were obtained for receptor models showing one or three binding sites or negative cooperativity. With the use of Tris-citrate buffer at 0 degree C the two affinity classes for P4S in bovine cortex membranes revealed the following binding parameters: KD = 17 +/- 7 nM (Bmax = 0.15 +/- 0.07 pmol/mg protein) and KD = 237 +/- 100 nM (Bmax = 0.80 +/- 0.20 pmol/mg protein). Heterogeneity was also observed for association and dissociation rates of [3H]P4S. The slow binding component (kon = 5.6 X 10(7) or 8.8 X 10(7) M-1 min-1, koff = 0.83 min-1, and KD = 14.7 or 9.4 nM, determined by two different methods in phosphate buffer containing postassium chloride) corresponds to the high-affinity component of the equilibrium binding curve (KD = 11 nM, Bmax = 0.12 pmol/mg protein in the same buffer system). The association and dissociation rates for the subpopulation of rapidly of dissociating sites, apparently corresponding to the low-affinity sites, were too rapid to be measured accurately. The binding of [3H]P4S appears to involve the same two populations of sites with Bmax values similar to those for [3H]GABA binding to the same tissue, although the kinetic parameters for the two ligands are somewhat different. Furthermore, comparative studies on the inhibition of [3H]P4S and [3H]GABA binding by various GABA analogues, strongly suggest that P4S binds to the GABA receptors. The different effects of P4S and GABA on benzodiazepine binding are discussed.", 
    "30": "Ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) is a mixed-type inhibitor of [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FNM) binding to benzodiazepine receptors in noncerebellar regions of rat brain. These findings may represent the presence of either receptor multiplicity or negative cooperativity among benzodiazepine receptors. [3H]Propyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ([3H]PrCC) has previously been shown to bind specifically to benzodiazepine receptors of rat cerebellum. In the present study we found no indication of the presence of true negative cooperativity among benzodiazepine receptors when [3H]PrCC was used as radioligand. However, we observed that [3H]PrCC labelled only 57% of [3H]FNM binding sites in rat hippocampus (Bmax values) and 71% in rat cerebral cortex, whereas the number of receptors labelled by both ligands was equal in the cerebellum. Hofstee analyses of the shallow inhibition curves seen in hippocampus and cerebral cortex when [3H]FNM binding was inhibited by beta-CCE indicate that beta-CCE and some other beta-carboline-3-carboxylate derivatives interact preferentially with a subclass of receptors, and that the percentage of this subclass is equivalent to the number of receptors labelled by [3H]PrCC. We conclude that [3H]PrCC at low concentration (0.3-0.4 X 10(-9) M) labels a subclass of benzodiazepine receptors, BZ1, while another class, BZ2 receptors, are not labelled by [3H]PrCC when filtration assays are used. By parallel determinations of the proportion between [3H]FNM and [3H]PrCC binding we calculated the percentage of BZ1 receptors in several regions of rat, guinea pig and calf brain and in mouse forebrain. The values ranged from approximately 50% in hippocampus to 90% in the guinea pig pons.", 
    "31": "The anticonvulsant activity of three benzodiazepines (BZDP) and two standard antiepileptic drugs were investigated comparatively against maximal electroshock seizures in rats in a time-distribution study. While phenobarbitone (PHB) and diphenylhydantoin (DPH) gave marked to moderate protection (100%-67%) against tonic seizures up to 6-7 h post-treatment, the BZDP provided significant protection (100%-60%) only up to 1.5 h, with clonazepam being the strongest and diazepam the weakest. Clonic seizures occurred in all treatment groups, whether tonic seizures preceded them or not, but their duration was longer in the DPH and PHB groups than in the BZDP groups. Total seizure durations were often significantly reduced in the BZDP groups, notably with clonazepam, whereas it was invariably longer in the DPH and PHB groups when compared with the vehicle treated controls. The BZDP treated rats generally required longer time to recover from postictal coma, the effect being dose-related. the DPH and PHB treated rats needed longer recovery time when the treatment-test interval was 18-20 h.", 
    "32": "The biochemical and the pharmacological effects of beta-carbolines in animals and man are reviewed. Biochemical studies have revealed beta-carbolines' several actions, including inhibition of MAO-A, competitive inhibition of 5-HT uptake, general inhibition of Na+ dependent transports, binding to benzodiazepine and opiate receptors and probable action on dopamine receptors, which may all participate to a variable degree in the actions of different beta-carbolines. Many early in vivo studies, however, have concentrated on some harmala alkaloids, particularly harmaline or harmine. The effects of beta-carbolines in man are compared in this review with the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. However, no human studies have been reported with those tetrahydro-beta-carbolines shown to occur in human body in normal conditions or after alcohol intake. To prove any connections of beta-carbolines with the withdrawal syndromes or other neurological and psychiatric diseases means that these compounds have to be shown to have abnormal central nervous system concentrations in these diseases. The physiological role of beta-carbolines has yet to be shown. They may act as neuromodulators and some, especially 6-methoxytetrahydro-beta-carboline, may have an endocrinological function. It has been suggested that some beta-carbolines act as the physiological ligands (agonists) of the benzodiazepine receptors, but the physiological beta-carbolines so far known seem to have other effects, such as the inhibition of MAO-A or 5-HT uptake in low concentrations.", 
    "33": "Levonantradol enhanced binding of 3H-diazepam to rat cortical membranes. Scatchard analysis of this effect showed apparent KD and Bmax changes at 100 microM levonantradol and a KD decrease at 50 microM. Dextronantradol caused a similar enhancement, suggesting a lack of stereospecificity in vitro. Subsequently, levonantradol at pharmacologic doses (0.15 mg/kg subcutaneously) was found to enhance the binding of intravenous 3H-flunitrazepam to mouse brain. In contrast to the results in vitro, dextronantradol showed no enhancement of 3H-flunitrazepam binding at doses up to 15 mg/kg subcutaneously. This stereospecific interaction with benzodiazepine receptors in vivo suggests that levonantradol may facilitate the pharmacologic actions of benzodiazepines. Levonantradol, at doses of 0.32 and 3.2 mg/kg subcutaneously, which did not block the convulsant effect of pentylenetetrazol, enhanced both the potency and efficacy of diazepam in elevating the absolute threshold of pentylenetetrazol for eliciting clonic seizures. Consistent with its lack of facilitation of benzodiazepine binding, dextronantradol at 3.2 mg/kg, a dose without effect on pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions, showed little or no enhancement of diazepam's anticonvulsant activity against the latter.", 
    "34": "The benzodiazepine anxiolytics flurazepam and diazepam and CL 218872, zopiclone and two beta-carboline ethyl carboxyl esters, compounds which are potent displacers of specific [3H]diazepam binding from rat brain membranes, have little or no activity in displacing [3H]2-chloroadenosine ([3H]2-CADO) from central A1-adenosine receptors. Conversely, the purine agonists, 1-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine, N6-cyclohexyladenosine, 2-chloroadenosine, and the adenosine antagonist 8-phenyltheophylline have no significant effect on [3H]diazepam binding. Etazolate (SQ 20009) and Avermectin B1a which enhance [3H]diazepam binding in vitro were also without significant effect on [3H]2-CADO binding. The lack of correlation of the activities of the compounds examined in the two binding assays is discussed in relation to the hypothesis that purine-like compounds may be involved in the molecular mechanisms related to anxiolytic action at the receptor level.", 
    "35": "Specific binding of ligand to rat forebrain alpha- and beta-adrenergic, muscarinic cholinergic, opiate, benzodiazepine, and striatal dopamine receptors was measured at 4-hour intervals during the last 13 hours of a 24-hour sleep deprivation period, and during the first 11 hours of the recovery sleep period. In non-sleep-deprived controls a 24-hour rhythm in binding was evident. The minor differences between the sleep deprivation group and the control group consisted mainly in a reduced amplitude of the 24-hour rhythm under the sleep deprivation schedule. The results indicate that neither the 24-hour forced locomotion nor the subsequent prominent sleep rebound is accompanied by marked changes in the number of neurotransmitter receptors and their circadian rhythms.", 
    "36": "A randomized study of 96 women undergoing hysterectomy was used to compare two anaesthetic techniques: flunitrazepam, ketamine and nitrous oxide in oxygen; and pethidine, thiopentone, nitrous oxide in oxygen and halothane. The techniques exerted small, but significantly different influences on heart rate and arterial pressure. Significantly more patients complained of nausea and vomiting on awakening after inhalation anaesthesia. Amnesia after operation lasted significantly longer after flunitrazepam combined with ketamine and nitrous oxide in oxygen.", 
    "37": "The effects of some anaesthetics and other agents used in anaesthetic practice on the neuromuscular blocking activity of cumulative doses of Org NC 45 have been studied in cats anaesthetized with chloralose. As expected from studies with other neuromuscular blocking drugs, both inhalation and i.v. anaesthetics reduced the doses of Org NC 45 required for neuromuscular blockade. An apparently specific potentiating interaction between Org NC 45 and metronidazole was observed.", 
    "38": "Triazolam is a triazolobenzodiazepine with hypnotic properties, advocated for use in acute or chronic insomnia, situational insomnia in hospitalised patients, and insomnia associated with other disease states. As triazolam has a relatively short half-life of about 2 to 3 hours in healthy subjects and has only 1 short acting active metabolite, alpha-hydroxytriazolam, it would seem more suitable as an hypnotic than longer acting drugs such as flurazepam, nitrazepam or flunitrazepam, particularly when residual sedative effects on the day after ingestion are undesirable. Thus, with usual hypnotic doses of triazolam (0.25 or 0.5 mg) impairment of psychomotor and cognitive function is generally not carried over into the day after ingestion, although at doses of 1 mg or greater, residual effects may appear. In short term comparative studies triazolam was clearly superior to a placebo, and was at lest as effective as flurazepam, or other benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam or diazepam, in hastening sleep onset, reducing nocturnal awakenings, and increasing sleep duration. In other studies it was often superior to chloral hydrate, methyprylone or quinalbarbitone (secobarbital). In a small number of patients with chronic insomnia receiving extended treatment with triazolam in a clinical setting or in some sleep laboratory studies, no evidence of tolerance occurred; however, some evidence of reduced effect with repeated administration has been reported in one sleep laboratory study. Thus, a definitive statement about the likelihood of tolerance occurring on repeated administration is difficult to make at this time.", 
    "39": "Depression is not only a common disorder, but also one that is readily treatable. Antidepressant drugs play a major role in treatment, although concurrent use of electroconvulsive therapy or psychotherapy may be indicated for some patients. Antidepressant drugs have been most specifically beneficial for patients with 'endogenous' depressions, but they should be used whenever this type of depression cannot be definitely ruled out. Besides the older tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, a new 'second generation' group of drugs is now available. Although these drugs offer no great therapeutic advantages over the older ones, they may prove to have a more acceptable profile of side effects, may act more quickly, and may show less cardiotoxicity with overdoses. Whether one can classify depression pathogenetically according to various biological markers, such as urinary excretion of the norepinephrine metabolite, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy phenylglycol, is still uncertain. At present, the choice of antidepressant drug for an individual patient is largely empirical. Besides being useful for treating depression, antidepressants may be used for treating enuresis, chronically painful states, obsessive-compulsive-phobic states, acute panic attacks and cataplectic attacks in narcoleptics. Many studies have tried to define a therapeutic range of plasma concentrations of these drugs, so as to afford a better basis for dosing, but routine monitoring of drug plasma concentrations is seldom needed; the primary indication for doing so would be in the patient who has received what should be an adequate dose but who is still unresponsive. The value of maintenance treatment with antidepressants has been clearly established; the pattern it takes is best determined by the natural history of the disorder in individual patients. Most drug interactions with antidepressants are pharmacodynamic in nature and can be managed by adjusting doses. Pharmacokinetic interactions with various sympatholytic antihypertensive drugs, such as guanethidine, methyldopa and clonidine, are rare but may be serious. Patients with depression may be spared a considerable amount of discomfort, morbidity, and possibly mortality, by judicious use of antidepressant drugs and the other treatments currently available.", 
    "40": "Plasma midazolam concentrations following single therapeutic doses can be quantitated using electron-capture gas-liquid chromatography. After addition of a benzodiazepine analogue as an internal standard, samples are extracted with benzeneisoamyl alcohol (98.5:1.5). The organic extract is evaporated to dryness, reconstituted, and chromatographed on an SP-2250 liquid phase. The automatic sampler allows up to 100 chromatographic analyses per 24-h period. The sensitivity limits are 2-3 ng of midazolam per ml of plasma, and the variation of identical samples is 7 per cent or less. The method was used in a study of six females who received single intravenous doses of midazolam for purposes of anesthetic induction prior to minor gynecologic procedures. Mean (+/- SE) kinetic variables for midazolam were: volume of central compartment, 0.37 (+/ 0.06 l/kg; total volume of distribution, 1.72 (+/- 0.05) l/kg: initial distribution half-life, 7.2 (+/- 1.6) min; elimination half-life, 2.5 (+/- 0.2) h; total clearance, 8.1 (+/- 0.52) ml.min-1.kg-1.", 
    "41": "Quazepam, an investigational benzodiazepine, was evaluated in doses of 7.5, 15, and 30 mg in a 12-night protocol including four nights of drug trial. All three doses were effective in inducing and maintaining sleep, with the highest degree of effectiveness after the first drug night. Carry-over effectiveness, which was seen after withdrawal of all three doses, persisted throughout the withdrawal period after the 30-mg dose. Quazepam's effects during both drug use and withdrawal appeared to be dose related; 15 mg induced a greater reduction in wake time after sleep onset than the 7.5-mg dose, and 30 mg induced even greater differences in both wake time after sleep onset and total wake time. Subjective reports of improved sleep were in general agreement with the objective data at each dose level. Side effects appeared to be dose related in terms of severity. The efficacy and comparatively less severe side effects of the 7.5- and 15-mg doses of quazepam suggest that these doses may be optimal when the drug is considered for the adjunctive treatment of insomnia.", 
    "42": "Benzodiazepines inhibit Ca2+-calmodulin-stimulated membrane protein phosphorylation. The effects of the benzodiazepines on protein phosphorylation are stereospecific and produced by membrane-bound benzodiazepine. The potency of benzodiazepine kinase inhibition is correlated with the ability of the benzodiazepines to inhibit electric shock-induced convulsions. These findings provide evidence that some of the anticonvulsant and neuronal stabilizing effects of benzodiazepines may be modulated by the Ca2+-calmodulin protein kinase system and indicate that this calmodulin-kinase system represents an identifiable benzodiazepine receptor in brain that is distinquishable by several criteria from the previously described high affinity benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "43": "In urethane-anaesthetized rats, the beta-carboline derivative beta CCE (0.3-1.0 mg/kg i.v.) excited hippocampal pyramidal cells which were inhibited by GABA (applied iontophoretically) and benzodiazepines (applied iontophoretically or intravenously). While benzodiazepines facilitated the action of GABA, the effects of GABA and benzodiazepines were antagonized by beta CCE. This electrophysiological study supports the behavioural observations that beta CCE is a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist.", 
    "44": "A protein has been isolated from the small intestine and bile duct which inhibits the binding of [3H]diazepam to specific benzodiazepine binding sites on synaptosomal membranes. When ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography are used, this protein has been purified to apparent homogeneity. \"Nepenthin\" has been chosen as a name for this protein, which has an approximate molecular weight of 16 000, as determined by both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography. Purified nepenthin is a competitive inhibitor of [3H]diazepam binding with a Ki = 4.6 X 10(-8) M. It does not inhibit the binding of specific ligands to the enkephalin, beta-adrenergic, gamma-aminobutyrate, or dopamine binding sites in the CNS. Neither gamma-aminobutyric acid nor glycine alters the inhibition of [3H]diazepam binding by this protein. Nepenthin can be extensively treated with proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, and Pronase), and inhibition of diazepam binding remains stable, indicating that a lower molecular weight fragment retains activity. Antibodies raised against this purified effector have been used in in situ double antibody labeling studies with rat brain slices. These studies indicate that cells containing an immunologically similar material are present in the deep cortical region of the forebrain.", 
    "45": "The specific binding of [3H] alpha-dihydropicrotoxinin to rat brain membranes was inhibited competitively and potently (IC50 congruent to 100 nM) by a convulsant benzodiazepine drug, RO5-3663. This compound did not inhibit high affinity flunitrazepam binding to the same tissue under similar conditions, and its reported pharmacological activity as an antagonist of GABAergic synaptic transmission, which resembles that of picrotoxinin, appears to involve the picrotoxinin binding sites. Other benzodiazepines such as diazepam, in micromolar concentrations, inhibited picrotoxinin binding in a stereospecific and chemically specific manner. However, the order of potency of a series of depressant benzodiazepines did not correlate well with pharmacological activities nor with reported activities for displacement of high affinity benzodiazepine 'receptor' binding sites (although heterogeneity of both picrotoxinin and benzodiazepine binding site populations may make difficult such comparisons). A comparison of benzodiazepine-displaceable benzodiazepine binding and benzodiazepine-displaceable picrotoxinin binding for different brain regions and subcellular fractions revealed a very similar though not identical distribution of these two classes of drug receptor, again suggesting that the two are not identical. Both classes of drug binding site also showed a very similar distribution to sodium-independent GABA receptor binding sites, which is consistent with other evidence that at least part of these 3 receptor types may be found at least sometimes coupled together in the postsynaptic membrane GABA receptor-ionophore complex.", 
    "46": "Specific binding of [3H]diazepam to rat and guinea-pig heart tissue has been found. These binding sites are similar to those in lung, liver, kidney and mast cells but differ from those in the brain. Dipyridamole interacts with this receptor and is several fold more potent as a displacer of [3H]diazepam bound to heart preparations than to brain membranes. Specific binding per unit protein in the left ventricle, right ventricle and interventricular septum is significantly higher than in the left and right atrium.", 
    "47": "In male Swiss mice, muscimol produced myoclonic jerks. A 3 mg/kg (i.p.) dose induced this response in all of the mice tested and the peak response of 73 jerks per min was observed between 27 and 45 min. Increasing the brain serotonin levels by the administration of 5-hydroxytryptophan (80-160 mg/kg) in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor resulted in an inhibition of the muscimol effect. However, in a similar experiment l-dopa (80-160 mg/kg) was without effect. In doses of 3-10 mg/kg, the serotonin receptor agonist MK-212 caused a dose-dependent blockade of the response of muscimol. Of the benzodiazepines, clonazepam (0.1-0.3 mg/kg) was found to be several fold more potent than diazepam (0.3-3 mg/kg) in blocking the myoclonic jerks. While (-)-baclofen (1-3 mg/kg) proved to be an effective antagonist of muscimol, its (+)-isomer (5-20 mg/kg) lacked this property. Considering the fact that 5-HTP and the benzodiazepines have been found to be beneficial in the management of clinical myoclonus, the muscimol-induced myoclonus seems to be a satisfactory animal model that may prove useful for the development of new drug treatments for this condition. Our present study indicated the possible value of MK-212 and (-)-baclofen in the management of clinical myoclonus.", 
    "48": "A case of convulsion due to inadvertent intravascular injection of bupivacaine during attempted epidural anaesthesia is presented. A review of the literature indicates that such an event is difficult to anticipate, and resuscitative equipment and skill are prerequisites for anyone attempting epidural anaesthesia. The role of benzodiazepines, test doses and aspiration tests and the significance of plasma drug levels are discussed.", 
    "49": "beta-Carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (beta-CEE) displaced [3H] flunitrazepam from the mouse brain benzodiazepine receptor in vivo with an i.v. ED50 of 2.1 mg/kg, an i.p. ED50 and 53.4 mg/kg, and an i.g. ED50 of 450 mg/kg. At 2.1 mg/kg i.v. beta-CEE displaced 37 +/- 9% of the label from hippocampal membranes and 76 +/- 7% from cerebellar membranes. The results suggest that the in vitro binding specificity of beta-CEE is also expressed in vivo and that the drug may act in vivo by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "50": "In 68 of 1152 patients older than 65 years an acute ulcus duodeni could be stated by endoscopy. This is 5,9% of the examined patients. Among this group there was a remarkably great number of patients who belonged to the age group between 70 and 80 years. The anamnesis of 42 patients indicated complaints for several years, whereas 26 patients showed symptoms only for a few weeks. The size of the acute ulceration was mostly below 1,0 cm. A determined relation between the size of the ulceration, the patients age and the duration of their anamnesis could not be found. In 12 patients an acute ulcus ventriculi could be proved simultaneously. In 15 cases acute bleeding was the initial symptom of the ulceration. Healing of the ulcera took between 4 weeks and 3 months. The conservative therapeutical steps were not standardized. Stationary and ambulant patients did not show any difference in the time of healing. It was remarkable that the consumption of alcohol and especially of cigarettes was relatively high.", 
    "51": "This study aims to evaluate the dependence potential of benzodiazepines in general practice. Amongst a sample of 1079 current general practice patients 87 (8.1 percent) were using benzodiazepines. Most of the users were middle to old age females and had chronic physical illnesses. The drug history was extensive (mean--3 years 7 months) and about 39 percent (34/87) of users were currently on a higher dose than the first prescribed dose. Interview of a selected group (40) of benzodiazepine users showed 75 percent (30/40) to be from a lower socio-economic class and 17 percent (7/40) of these reported past experiences consisting of withdrawal phenomena of varying severity. Benzodiazepines appear to have replaced barbiturates in the general practice setting.", 
    "52": "Caerulein, cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) and diazepam delayed the onset of seizures produced by harman and thiosemicarbazide (TSC). Caerulein had the potency of diazepam, whereas CCK-8 was less active by a factor of four. The convulsions induced by isoniazid (INH) were very resistant to both caerulein and diazepam; CCK-8 was not tested against isoniazid. Haloperidol did not influence the effect of TSC; it enhanced isoniazid-induced seizures, and antagonized the convulsant effect of harman.", 
    "53": "The pharmacokinetics of diazepam administered as suppositories or as a solution in rectal tubes were compared in six geriatric hospital patients. A single dose of 10 mg was administered in a cross-over study with a one week interval. There was no statistically significant difference in the bioavailability, the mean maximum serum concentration or the time of achievement of the maximum with these preparations. However, the peak serum concentration was somewhat higher with suppositories but the absorption was somewhat faster via rectal tubes. The serum N-desmethyldiazepam concentration increased during the whole 24 hour observation period, there was no difference between the preparations. Our results are in good agreement with most studies of the pharmacokinetics of diazepam. The basal substance of the suppository is of the utmost importance to the absorption of diazepam. The rectal tube for administration of diazepam did not have any advantage over the optimally formulated (a mixture of macrogols) suppository in geriatric patients. In fact, the use of rectal tubes is more expensive, the tube may not be completely emptied, and the solution may not be completely retained in the rectum.", 
    "54": "In an unselected consecutive series of 126 children, 1-15 years, seen in a paido-psychiatric outpatient service for various complaints, and in a large extent diagnosed as suffering from childhood depression, 61 of them (48.41%) presented, among other symptoms, a marked susceptibility to infective respiratory diseases. A pharmacotherapy carried out by means of GABAergic drugs (l-glutamine, pyridoxine and a benzodiazepine), besides improving both the alleged complaint and other symptoms of depression, made noticeable improvement or disappearance of this susceptibility in 40 out of the 42 subjects who came back for check-up. Susceptibility to infective respiratory diseases is believed due both to impairment of GABAergic mechanisms as first modulators of hypophysis secretion and adrenergic and cholinergic responses, and to a lack of l-glutamine as a donor of essential C atoms for the construction of proteins and nucleic acids.", 
    "55": "Exploratory behavior can be considered a kind of positional behavior. The theory for the analysis of exploratory behavior by the presented method is based on the concept of the Markov process. The following parameters were used in this experiment; (1) frequency of visits to all the positions that are unit spaces expedient to the observation (N), (2) Entropy (HI), a measure of the spacial distribution of animal location, (3) Entropy (HII), a measure of the degree of disorder in movement direction, and (4) length of the longest path passed frequently (L), calculated by examining an upper confidence limit for a parameter of a binomial distribution. Both methamphetamine and diazepam increased N at lower doses, and increased L dose-relatedly. Methamphetamine decreased the values of HI and HII. Diazepam increased HI value while decreased HII value. These results indicate that the effect of methamphetamine on the exploratory behavior in mice is to narrow their behavior space and to make their movement pattern monotonous, back and forth within a small area (i.e. stereotyped behavior), and the effect of diazepam is to extend their behavior space and also simplify their movement pattern, going round and round over a wide area in the apparatus. The results of this experiment suggest that the present method is useful for analysis of exploratory behavior and a better understanding of the effects of psychotropic drugs.", 
    "56": "The effect of naloxone on the anticonflict action of diazepam was studied in a model involving foot shock-induced suppression of food-rewarded operant behaviour. Both 1 and 10 mg/kg naloxone SC abolished the increase in punished responding produced by diazepam and chlordiazepoxide. Naloxone also blocked the anticonflict effect of meprobamate. These observations are discussed in terms of a possible involvement of endogenous opioid peptides in the anxiolytic effects of tranquillizers."
