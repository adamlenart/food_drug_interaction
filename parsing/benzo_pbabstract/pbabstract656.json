    "0": "The record of 67 cases under 15 years of age who were hospitalized during status convulsivus from 1975 to 1978, the 348 cases who visited the hospital for the first time with epilepsy (Oct. 1977 to Sept. 1978) and the 32 cases who were hospitalized during status epilepticus from 1969 to 1974 and who are being followed up as outpatients were studied. The frequency of status epilepticus was 8% among epileptic children. There was no difference in the frequency of incidence between male and female. Patients with mental retardation, however, were revealed to have status epilepticus twice to three times more frequently as compared to cases without mental retardation. The major seizure types of status epilepticus in childhood were generalized tonic clonic convulsion and unilateral clonic convulsion. In 25% of the cases, status epilepticus was the first ictal manifestation. The major cause of status convulsivus was epilepsy, followed by encephalitis and encephalopathy, but cases due to brain tumor were rare. The drug of first choice for status convulsivus is diazepam. If there is any difficulty in controlling status convulsivus with diazepam, it may be worthwhile to consider what the problem is, causes of status convulsivus, seizure type, or basic disease of the patient. The effective dose of diazepam was within the range of 0.3--0.5 mg/kg. When the effect is not sufficient, the dose of diazepam should be increased to 1 mg/kg while watching the general condition of the patient. Factors affecting the prognosis of status convulsivus were its cause, duration, onset age and effectiveness of therapy during the acute stage. The frequency of cases who suffered disability after status epilepticus was 56%. (transient disability 43%, permanent disability 13%) The most frequent type of transient disability was hemiplegia. Most epileptic children who had repetitive status convulsivus revealed psychomotor retardation before first status. Factors which cause repetitive status seem to be hemispheric brain damage or diffuse corticocentrencephalic damage.", 
    "1": "A combined GLC-ECD and HPLC procedure has been developed for the analysis of the most commonly encountered benzodiazepine drugs and has been applied to both plasma and postmortem blood samples. There is no doubt that since their introduction the use of these sensitive analytical methods have resulted in an increase in the incidence of detection of these drugs in both clinical and forensic toxicology cases.", 
    "2": "1 Visuo-motor coordination has been used to study the immediate and residual effects of benzodiazepines on performance in man. The technique provides dose and time response data related to the decrement and the persistence of impaired performance. 2 With the overnight ingestion of flurazepam hydrochloride 30 mg and nitrazepam 10 mg, performance was impaired to 16 h and, at least, 19 h, respectively. Performance was not impaired after the overnight ingestion of diazepam, 5 and 10 mg, temazepam 10, 20 and 30 mg or oxazepam 15 and 30 mg. However, with temazepam 30 mg there was a trend toward impaired performance,, and with oxazepam 45 mg, performance was impaired 10 h after ingestion. With morning ingestion, coordination was impaired 0.5 and 2.5 h after diazepam 10 mg, at 0.5 h after temazepam 20 mg, and after oxazepam 30 mg at 2.5 and 4.5 hours. 3 The studies suggest that diazepam 5-10 mg, temazepam 10-20 mg and oxazepam 15-30 mg may be of use in the management of sleep disturbance when impaired performance the next day is to be avoided.", 
    "3": "After laboratory and procedure adaptation, 6 normal subjects were randomly administered 30 mg flurazepam (twice), 100 mg pentobarbital (twice), 400 mg caffeine (once), and placebo (twice) on nonconsecutive nights. On each night subjects were aroused from standard segments of stage 2 sleep five to eight times with an ascending series of 1,000 Hz tones produced by an audiometer. Arousal threshold and awake threshold after each arousal were measured. Both thresholds were increased by flurazepam and pentobarbital and decreased by caffeine. All of the drugs appeared to modify arousal threshold in a time course fashion such that extreme effects were found during the first half of the night. However, the modifications of waking threshold by caffeine and flurazepam continued throughout the sleep period. The method may be a means of measuring the behavioral time course of drug activity during the sleep period.", 
    "4": "A study is made of the human ability to estimate short time intervals (up to 1 s) by a simple motor response under the effect of stimulants (Amphetamine, Caffeine) and depressants (Chlorazin, Diazepam, Phenobarbital). Of all psychotropic drugs used only Chlorazin causes a statistically significant increase in the mean values of the reaction time of all subjects compared with the controls. The psychotropic drugs in the doses used have no influence on the ability of the subjects to produce a light interval of a given duration. In the task requiring reproduction of a 900 ms interval, Amphetamine schortens significantly the response times, which is explained by earlier organization of their motor responce and lack of feedback.", 
    "5": "39 selected patients had their inguinal herniae repaired on 41 separate occasions in a health center. Local anaesthesia allowed adequate painfree surgery when supplemented with Diazepam and Pentazocin. All patients could return to their own homes within 6 hours. With an observation time of between one month and six years no recurrences have so far been observed. Apart from a mild post-operative pain, there were no complications. All returned to their normal employment after 5 to 32 days (average 20 days) depending on occupational demands. The pros and cons of out-patient surgery under local anaesthesia are discussed.", 
    "6": "A total of 113 children with brain edema of infectious and toxic nature were studied. The main clinical syndrome in these conditions was an epileptical status. Among anticonvulsive drugs used seduxen appeared to be the most effective. The use of GABA, gas narcosis and myorelaxants is recommended as well. The rehydration by plasma, low molecular plasma substitutes and glucose-polyion solutions are discussed. The paper contains some information on contraindications for early dehydration and rehydration. Hypoxia is eliminated by providing adequate lung ventilation, oxygenotherapy or hyperbaric oxygenation, by using oxidative enzymes and drugs increasing the resistance of the brain to hypoxia and hypothermia. It is recommended that hormonal therapy should be used. The techniques of urgent measures and their sequence are given.", 
    "7": "Reference is made to the advantages implied in the combinational use of Faustan and ketamine for anaesthesia, but disadvantages are mentioned, as well. No complications with danger to life were recorded from an evaluation of 1,000 narcoses over a period between September 1st, 1977, and July 31st, 1978. Combined use of the above agents may be justified on account of low rate of complications, optimum surgical conditions, and smoother operation.", 
    "8": "Sleep is an enigma and the clinical importance of disturbed sleep is not clear. Much has been learnt in the past 25 years of the physiology of normal and abnormal sleep. Complaints of insomnia can be related to several causes--normal extreme patterns, psychiatric, physical, specific and drug-related. The treatment of insomnia is essentially that of the primary condition. Hypnotics have a limited role and their use should always be carefully considered.", 
    "9": "The effect of pirenzepine on basal and stimulated acid secretion was tested in five patients with peptic ulcer disease and gastric hypersecretion. Two types of stimulation were compared, namely pentagastrin by intravenous infusion (1 microgram/kg/h) and hypoglycaemia induced by insulin given subcutaneously (0.125 IU/kg). Basal acid output/30 min was reduced by 44% and 69%, respectively. Pentagastrin-stimulated acid output was reduced by 30%/120 min, and insulin-stimulated acid output by 47%. The reduction was similar during the first and second hour of stimulation in both series. These results strengthen our previous impression that pirenzepine may interfere with cholinergic receptors at the parietal cell level. As the inhibition of gastric acid secretion by pirenzepine is similar to that produced by oral doses of cimetidine, pirenzepine may be useful in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease.", 
    "10": "Pirenzepine is a new tricyclic drug used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. The effect of two doses of pirenzepine (25 mg twice daily and 50 mg thrice daily) was examined in ten healthy volunteers during basal acid secretion and under stimulation with two doses of pentagastrin (0.166 microgram/kg . h and 1 microgram/kg.h given as continuous intravenous infusion). Serum drug concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay, and parallel studies of the salivary function were performed. Pirenzepine, 25 mg twice daily, reduced basal acid output by 50% and 55%, respectively, and inhibited stimulated acid output by 31% and 26%, respectively. The higher dose of pirenzepine, 50 mg thrice daily, augmented the effect insignificantly despite markedly increased serum drug levels. The recommended therapeutic dose of 25 mg twice daily gave no salivary inhibition. Pirenzepine may have an anticholinergic effect on the parietal cell, although systemic side effects were not seen. Pirenzepine does not competitively inhibit pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion.", 
    "11": "Measurement of arterial oxygen tensions in elderly patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and in a matched control group undergoing colonoscopy showed a slight but significant fall in the PaO2 in both groups following premedication. The initial fall in PaO2 was probably due to the intravenous atropine, diazepam, and meperidine, mainly the latter. This fall of the oxygen tension continued in the gastroscopy group until the instrument was removed, while the controls rapidly returned to basal levels. This persistently reduced PaO2 in the former group is therefore most likely due to the physical presence of the endoscope in the pharynx. To minimize the occurrence of hypoxemia during gastroscopy, narcotics should probably not be used in the premedication of elderly patients. The procedure should be carried out after optimal oxygenation of the patient and be of short duration, and a narrow instrument may be useful in this group.", 
    "12": "The poor prognostic significance of inactive or paroxystic E.E.G. recordings in new-born babies appears to be well established (Monod et al., ibid., 1972, 32, 529-544). However, some cases have been described as having a favourable evolution even though such tracings had been proesent during the neonatal period. The authors studied, therefore, the effects of anticonvulsants (diazepam, phenobarbital) to see if they produced inactive or paroxystic tracings. A total of 19 new-born babies with convulsions of various etiologies were treated with phenobarbital and diazepam and recordings were made less than 24 hours after the beginning of treatment. Plasma levels were measured at the time of recording and varied from 3 to 26 micrograms/ml for phenobarbital and 0 to 2.75 micrograms/ml for diazepam. No paroxystic tracings were noted, but 2 inactive tracings were seen in infants who had been severely asphyxiated at birth, and in whom the plasma levels of the anticonvulants was found to be low. The injection of diazepam during the E.E.G. recording caused suppression of electrical discharges without notably altering the inter-seizure E.E.G. activity. The authors conclude that in the 19 cases studied the changes noted in the E.E.G. were related to the severity of the condition and were not secondary to therapy.", 
    "13": "A method is developed for direct gas-chromatographic determination of clonazepam (Rivotril) and its main metabolite, 7-amino clonazepam, in plasma, using desmethylflunitrazepam as internal standard. Following selective extraction, the benzodiazepines are analyzed by gas-chromatography, with a glass column filled with 3% OV17 on Gas Chrom Q and 63Ni electron capture detector. The procedure, which requires neither hydrolysis nor derivatisation, has a good selectivity. The sensitivity is 5 ng/ml of plasma for a valid quantitative determination. We have to improve this limit for fine pharmacokinetic studies, but the method is already available for therapeutic and pharmacovigilance controls. It is also suitable for diagnostic of eventual overdosing or poisoning, based on plasma or urine analysis.", 
    "14": "Studies on the isolated rat liver showed distinct interaction of chlorpromazine, diazepam and imipramine with ethanol. Injected intraperitoneally in doses of 20 mg/kg, these drugs distinctly influenced elimination of ethanol, although not as strongly as pyrazole in vitro in the concentration of 20 mg/100 ml. On the other hand, ethanol altered the effect of these substances on the glucose curve, lactate and pyruvate levels, and activities of glutamic pyruvic and oxalacetic transaminases and aldolase.", 
    "15": "Chronic experiments on rats permitted one to obtain an experimental model of photogenic epilepsy. This was accomplished by creating in the external geniculate body (EGB) a generator of pathologically intensified excitation (GPIE) with the aid of tetanus toxin (TT). According to some clinical and electrographic characteristics this form of epilepsy may be alloted to the type of primarily generalized or \"genuine\" epilepsy. The existance of focal pathology in the respective EGB was detected only by special electrophysiological and pharmacological methods. The studied model demonstrates a necessity of using special methods of detecting brain focal pathology (GPIE) in order to determine the focus of neuron hyperactivity in those cases where the clinical picture is characterized by signs of the so-called genuine epilepsy. Experimental photogenic epilepsy attained by creating GPIE in the EGB with the aid of TT, is proposed as a model for studying the mechanism of epileptogenesis and testing the efficacy of anticonvulsive drugs.", 
    "16": "Dibenzo [c,f]-[1,2] diazepine is a new compound with a tricyclic structure and a double bond between two nitrogen atoms in positions 1 and 2 of the molecule. Its in vitro metabolism has been studied, incubating the compound with rat liver microsomes. Two metabolites have been identified: dibenzo [c,f] - [1,2]diazepine-1-N-oxide and a monohydroxyderivative in the aromatic ring.", 
    "17": "Cerclage cervicis in paracervical analgesia with lidocaine and diazepam premedication has proved a very simple procedure. It can successfully be applied in pregnancy, without any harm to mother or fetoplacental unit. Out of a total of 50 cerclage cervicis in 48 women (96%) completed their pregnancy successfully. Earlier these women had had 94 pregnancies but with a successful issue only in 31 cases (32.97%). These results, supported by data on the decreased perinatal mortality from 232.5% to 40%, also fully justify the use of paracervical analgesia by lidocaine.", 
    "18": "The hyperphagia characteristic of some types of obesity may result from a deficiency in one or more components of the systems controlling satiety which in rats may include the gastrointestinal hormone cholecystokinin (CCK). Obesity may also influence responsivity to often used central nervous system (CNS)-acting drugs and combination of drugs. In these experiments it was shown that: (1) Zucker fatty rats were less sensitive than lean to intraperitoneal injections of 20 U/kg CCK after a 6-hr fast and when reduced were less sensitive than lean and less sensitive than when obese to injections of 5 U/kg CCK; (2) Although fatties were equally sensitive as leans to injections of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg d-amphetamine sulfate, when reduced, they were less sensitive; (3) Injections of 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg diazepam produced smaller increases in food intake after a 6-hr fast in fatty and reduced fatty than lean rats; (4) Combination of diazepam with cholecystokinin in both fatty and lean rats produced feeding similar to that following injection of carrier; and (5) A similar additive effect was obtained in both fatty and lean rats when diazepam was combined with amphetamine; however, the fatty appeared to be more sensitive to the amphetamine than the diazepam effect. Thus the Zucker fatty rat appears to be less sensitive to these chemicals which affect food intake, which supports the contention that their CNS is generally less responsive.", 
    "19": "Laboratory rats were pretreated with either morphine (9 mg/kg IP), diazepam (4 mg/kg 1P) or Ringer's solution 2, 3 1/2, and 2 hr, respectively, prior to ingestion of a novel tasting saccharin solution followed immediately by a single injection of one of these agents. Animals pretreated with Ringer's solution followed by an injection of either morphine or diazepam showed a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) as determined by a significant reduction in the mean saccharin intake on a subsequent test trial. Although the drug pretreatments alone produced no conditioned avoidance behavior, the diazepam pretreatment completely blocked the development of both diazepam and morphine-evoked CTAs while the morphine pretreatment prevented a CTA induced by itself but not by diazepam. The results were discussed in terms of the attenuating effects of the pretreatments on the relative saliency of the subsequent conditioning drug injection.", 
    "20": "In the experiments with self-stimulation of limbic brain structures on the rats of KM line an improvement in solving of extrapolation problems was observed. Self-stimulation of the limbic pathways is more effective than that of nuclear structures. It seems to be due to a more powerful afferentation caused by stimulation of the pathways that excites practically the whole visceral brain and the larger part of the neocortex. Increased excitability level of the central nervous system is an important condition for elementary reasoning activity; one of the criteria of such activity is the ability to extrapolate the direction of the movement of a meaningful stimulus.", 
    "21": "Chronic tests on cats showed that diazepam and nitrazepam lower the amplitude of primary responses (PR) of the second somatosensory zone of the brain cortex both to a single and paired stimulation of the thalamo-cortical radiation of fibers. Meprotan, while potentiating the PR to a single stimulation, does not influence the course of the PR restitution cycles. Benacryzine, while enhancing the PR to a single stimulation, produces the appearance of a lengthy phase of depression throughout the PR restitution cycle. In acute tests with unanesthetized, flaxedil immobilized cats, with an isolated cortical band underneath a stimulating electrode, analogous changes in PR both to a single and paired stimulation of the thalamo-cortical radiation of fibers were noted.", 
    "22": "Action myoclonus secondary to posthypoxic encephalopathy is being seen increasingly with improved resuscitation techniques. A case report describes 5 specific physical and occupational therapeutic techniques for achieving independence in ambulation, transfers and self-care: (1) analysis and segmentation of complex motions into small steps; (2) controlled progression of training; (3) voluntary cessation of abnormal activity (pacing); (4) progressive densensitization to external stimuli; and (5) quantification of progress. Literature review suggests that posthypoxic action myoclonus is secondary to a loss of inhibitory synapses in the brainstem reticular formation due to low serotonin levels. The proposed therapeutic effect of clonazepam, the drug used in this patient, is decreased serotinin degredation. L-5-hydroxytryptamine, an investigative drug, is also therapeutic, for it stimulates increased serotonin production.", 
    "23": "1. After each week of a flexible dosage treatment with either diazepam, amylobarbitone or placebo anxious patients were assessed by a comprehensive battery of psychiatrist's ratings, subjective tests and psychological performance tasks to detect the clinical and psychological effects of the drugs. 2. Self rated anxiety and insomnia were improved significantly by diazepam, while amylobarbitone improved only the self rated insomnia. 3. An impairment of performance relative to placebo was detected on two performance tasks after the barbiturate and on six performance tasks after the benzodiazepine. 4. The patient's reported level of anxiety under each treatment condition was related to the performance on the five tasks showing drug effects, thus confirming the postulated inverted U-shape relationship between drive and performance.", 
    "24": "The main pharmacodynamic characteristics of pirenzepine are briefly reported and the experimental plan of the clinical trial on pirenzepine in peptic ulcer is discussed.", 
    "25": "The effect of i.v. pirenzepine infusion both on basal and pentagastrin and insulin-stimulated secretion was studied in 19 healthy and duodenal ulcer subjects. Following an overnight fast, gastric juice was collected for 30 minutes prior to the i.v. administration of pirenzepine (16 mg plus 2 mg/h for 2 hours) and the subsequent stimulation of gastric secretion by means of i.v. pentagastrin infusion (6 microgram/kg/h) or i.v. insulin injection (0.2 U/kg). Mean acid output was reduced--in comparison to placebo--by 22% after pentagastrin stimulation and by 34% after insulin stimulation.", 
    "26": "Fifty-five patients with active duodenal ulcer have completed, up to today, a one-month double-blind trial to compare the effects of pirenzepine (150 mg daily), cimetidine (1 g daily) and placebo on the healing of duodenal ulcer. Fifteen (71%) of the 21 patients treated with pirenzepine had healed ulcers compared with 14 (82%) receiving cimetidine (P less than 0.05. In the placebo group there were 7 (41%) healed ulcers. Symptomatic improvement in patients given pirenzepine was as substantial as in cimetidine-treated patients. No adverse effects were noted.", 
    "27": "The effectiveness of pirenzepine in the treatment of gastric ulcer was assessed in a double-blind 6 weeks' clinical trial in comparison with placebo. After 2 weeks of treatment 1 patient in each group showed a complete healing of gastric ulcer. After 6 weeks of treatment 9 out of 10 patients in the pirenzepine group (90%) and 4 out of 10 patients in the placebo group (40%) healed (P less than 0.05). The relief of ulcer symptoms was significantly better in the pirenzepine group than in the placebo group. From the second week on, the pirenzepine-treated patients stopped taking antacid while placebo-treated patients went on taking it (P less than 0.02). The results of this study demonstrated that pirenzepine promotes gastric ulcer healing and induces a rapid regression of ulcer symptoms.", 
    "28": "The effectiveness of pirenzepine in the treatment of duodenal ulcer was assessed in a double-blind clinical trial in comparison with placebo. Twenty-nine of 30 patients satisfactorily completed the trial. There was endoscopic ulcer healing in 4 of 14 pirenzepine treated patients (29%) after 2 weeks of treatment and in 11 of 14 (79%) after 6 weeks. There was no healing in 15 patients treated with placebo after 2 weeks and there were two ulcers healed after 6 weeks. The difference between pirenzepine and placebo was significant in both 2nd and 6th week. Duodenitis (evaluated by endoscopy) markedly improved in the pirenzepine grouu after 2 (4 of 9 patients) and after 6 weeks of treatment (8 of 9), while no, or only slight, improvement was observed in 8 of 8 patients in the placebo group. When evaluated by ulcer symptom relief and antacid tablet comsumption, pirenzepine proved to be considerable more efficacious than the placebo. The results of this study demonstrate that pirenzepine promoted duodenal ulcer healing, that it markedly improved peptic duodenitis and promoted rapid regression of symptomatology in parallel with endoscopic findings.", 
    "29": "The effectiveness and safety of pirenzepine (PRZ) at 150 mg daily in the treatment of active duodenal ulcer was studied in an open pilot clinical trial followed by a double-blind trial against placebo. The open pilot study showed that pirenzepine was well tolerated and promoted ulcer healing in the 45% of patients within 2 weeks of treatment and in 90% within 4 weeks. The double-blind trial against placebo (PL) Confirmed these results: 60% of the patients in PRZ group and 10% of the patients in PL group showed endoscopic ulcer healing after 2 weeks. This difference was significant. Ninety per cent of the PRZ patients and 50% of the PL patients were completely healed after 4 weeks. In the PRZ group, gastric secretory tests showed a significant decrease in B.A.O. (69%), M.A.O. (33%) and P.A.O. (34%) after 2 weeks. In the PL group, the same parameters had only a small decrease, without statistical significance. There were no pathological changes in laboratory findings in either the open or the double-blind studies. Mild and transient side-effects were observed in 7 of 30 patinets receiving pirenzepine (diplopia and dryness of the mouth).", 
    "30": "Duodenal ulcer. Forty-five of 49 adult outpatients with active, severe, endoscopically proven duodenal ulcers completed a 4-week double-blind trial comparing two doses of LS 519 (75 and 150 mg/day) with placebo. After 2 weeks, 1 of 15 patients given LS 75 mg and 4 of 15 given LS 150 mg/day had healed (P = 0.09). No patient given placebo had healed. After 4 weeks, 6 of 15 (40%) on placebo, 9 of 15 (60%) on LS 75 mg and 13 of 15 (86.7%) on LS 153 mg had healed (P less than 0.01). Patients given the highest dose of LS had significantly more pain-free days and nights and took fewer antacid tablets than those receiving the lowest dose of LS or placebo. Gastric ulcer. 19 of 20 adult outpatients with endoscopically proven active benign gastric ulcers completed a double-blind 4-week trial with either LS 519 (75 mg/day) or carbenoxolone (300 mg/day). Six of 10 (60%) given LS and 6 of 9 (66.7%) given carbenoxolone had healed after 4 weeks (N.S.). Symptomatic improvement was significantly faster in the LS group than in the carbenoxolone group. Hypokaliemia, increases in alkaline phosphatase and SGOT were observed in the carbenoxolone group.", 
    "31": "Pirenzepine (PRZ, 75 mg/day for 10 days followed by 50 mg/day for 20 days) was compared with placebo (PL) in the treatment of endoscopically confirmed active gastroduodenitis or duodenal ulcer and with carbenoxolone (CB, 300 mg/day followed by 200 mg/day) in the treatment of gastric ulcer in a 30-day double-blind clinical trial. Ninety-seven of 112 outpatients completed the trial. The results can be summarized as follows: a) Gastroduodenitis. Complete normalization of the endoscopic picture was observed in 61% of the 28 patients on PRZ and in 30% of the 27 on PL. b) Duodenal ulcer. Complete endoscopic healing was observed in 75% of the 12 patients on PRZ and in 44% of the 9 on PL. In both studied PRZ induced improvement in clinical symptoms in more patients than PL. c) Gastric ulcer. PRZ and CB induced complete healing in a similar percentage of patients (64% of 11 and 70% of 10 patients). Better results in dyspepsia were observed in the PRZ group than the CB group. No major side-effects and no pathological changes in blood and urine analyses were observed in PRZ-treated patients.", 
    "32": "Pirenzepine (PRZ) 75 mg/day for 1 week followed by 50 mg/day for 3 weeks did not show a good activity in gastric ulcer healing in comparison to carbenoxolone (CB) (300 mg/day for 1 week followed by 200 mg/day for 3 weeks). The tolerability of PRZ seemed to be better than that of CB. The increase in the daily dose of PRZ to 100 mg/day for 4 weeks led to better results in the patients who have completed satisfactorily the treatment up to now. PRZ's tolerability was greater than CB's. The results of this study are preliminary to further trial.", 
    "33": "Ninety-six patients with endoscopically proved active duodenal ulcers were admitted to a multicentre double-blind trial with either pirenzepine (100 mg/day, 25 mg in the morning and midday and 50 mg at bed time) or placebo for 4 weeks. Ninety-two patients (46 in each group) completed the trial. After 4 weeks, complete healing had been achieved in 70% of the pirenzepine-treated patients and in 32% of the placebo-treated ones (P less than 0.01). No important side-effects and no abnormal changes in blood values or urinalysis were observed during treatment. The difference in the ulcer healing rates observed in the two parts of this multicentre trial is briefly discussed.", 
    "34": "Eighty-four patients with endoscopically-proved active duodenal ulcer were admitted to a multicentre double-blind trial with either pirenzepine tablets (25 mg three times per day for 1 week followed by 25 mg two times per day for 3 weeks) or placebo. Seventy-nine patients completed the trial, 44 treated with pirenzepine and 35 with placebo. After 4 weeks, complete healing had been achieved in 52% of the pirenzepine-treated patients and in 34% of the placebo-treated ones. Symptomatic responses were signigicantly better in those receiving pirenzepine than in those receiving placebo. In addition, the supplementary antacid consumption was significantly lesser in the pirenzepine group than in the placebo group. No important side-effects were observed in the two groups.", 
    "35": "A healing effect of carbenoxolone and colloidal bismuth on gastric and duodenal ulcer has been demonstrated in several studies. The use of carbenoxolone is limited by the high frequency of side effects. Information on the ability of these drugs to prevent ulcer recurrences is sparse. Further studies are needed to determine the ulcer-healing effect of deglycyrrhizinised liquorice. Sulpiride, a dopamine-blocking agent, seems to have interesting inhibitory effects on gastric secretion but its anti-ulcer activity is not yet clear.", 
    "36": "This was a double-blind study designed to compare 'Compazine', Librium and placebo in a psychoneurotic outpatient population with dominant symptoms of anxiety. The patient participants were accepted for the study when their pre-treatment symptoms of anxiety met a minimum or greater score on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. The study interval was 4 weeks. Patient psychopathology was rated by the treating physician on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the New Physician Rating List and Global Evaluation. Patients completed the Self-Rating Symptom Scale and the Profile of Mood States. All efficacy criteria ranked the study medications in the same order. Prochloroperazine was most effective, chlordiazepoxide was also active and placebo was least effective. There are statistically significant active medication versus placebo comparisons supporting desirable drug action. Chlordiazepoxide versus placebo comparisons approached statistical significance for all efficacy criteria.", 
    "37": "Our experience to date covers 675 kidney grafts performed in the Transplantation Department of the University of Louvain. The evolution of our anaesthesia methods has led us since the end of 1973 to conduct 375 transplantations with enflurane. The patients, aged between 18 months and 50 years, receive a conventional premedication, do not receive corticoids preoperatively nor undergo dialysis immediately prior to operation, but systematically receive a 5-unit transfusion beforehand. Having successively abandoned gallamine, succinylcholine, thiopentone and finally halothane, our present anaesthetic protocol is as follows: induction under benzodiazepines, fentanyl and enflurane, intubation under laryngeal anaesthesia. Maintenance: enflurane (2--3 MAC hours) in open circuit, pancuronium (0.02 mg/kg/h) and occasionally fentanyl. Details and comparative advantages are discussed. This anaesthesia technique combined with the systematic administration of antilymphocytic and antithymocytic serum in the postoperative period, and particularly the preliminary transfusion (producing blocking antibodies), has provided us, using cadaver kidney, with a survival rate of 96% at 6 months, 86% at 1 year and 80% at 2 years, the longest presently being 15 years.", 
    "38": "In a study of 52 consecutive out-patients the effects of diazepam and dixyrazine were compared with each other and with placebo as premedication for elective gastroscopy. All patients also received topical lidocaine and intravenous administration of propantheline bromide immediately before the examination. No difference was found between diazepam and dixyrazine, but they were both significantly superior to placebo in relieving anxiety, retching, and eructations.", 
    "39": "The effects of an intramuscular injection of atropine (0.6 mg) and meperidine (1 mg/kg body weight) 30 min before topical benzocaine and intravenous diazepam administration were compared with those of a control group that received only benzocaine and intravenous diazepam in a randomized double-blind controlled trial of premedication for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in 100 consecutive patients. Atropine and meperidine decreased the amount of salivation and gastric secretion (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.001, respectively) and increased the period of sedation (p less than 0.001). The patients' and examiners' evaluation of the procedure was the same with either premedication regimen. Neither regimen affected the success rate of the endoscopy. Regardless of the regimen used, every patient who underwent endoscopy stated that they would consent to another examination, if necessary. Patients judged before endoscopy to be most apprehensive tolerated the procedure least, and those judged to be least apprehensive tolerated the procedure best, irrespective of premedication. The addition of meperidine and atropine to a premedication regimen of diazepam and topical benzocaine does not appear to be beneficial.", 
    "40": "In five cases of death resulting from acute intoxication with phenobarbital and flurazepam, the blood, urine, brain, lung, liver, and kidney levels of these drugs as well as the levels of N-1 hydroxyethyl, N-1 desalkyl, and N-1 desalkyl-3-hydroxy flurazepam metabolites were determined. Concentration of flurazepam and its metabolites was determined by using new gas chromatographic conditions employing a selective detector for nitrogen-containing substances and a column of 1% SP-1000. In addition, the EMIT technique was also employed on blood and urine samples and the results compared with GLC data.", 
    "41": "In a double-blind crossover study in general practice, flurazepam was shown to be significantly better (p less than 0.001) than diazepam in treating sleep disturbance. Fewer patients reported side-effects on flurazepam.", 
    "42": "Thirty patients complaining of insomnia were studied in a double-blind trial with crossover of Finorgal, nitrazepam and triclofos sodium. Finorgal given as a hypnotic produced similar results to nitrazepam and triclofos sodium in terms of induction of sleep, duration and quality of sleep, dream recall and morning 'hangover'. Reported side-effects were not serious and occurred less frequently in association with Finorgal treatment than with nitrazepam or triclofos sodium. Laboratory investigations gave no indication of the development of any drug toxicity during the three-week period of the trial.", 
    "43": "Forty psychiatric out-patients with primary anxiety entered a double-blind trial comparing 2 weeks of treatment with mianserin 30--60 mg daily or diazepam 15--30 mg daily, followed by 2 weeks of single-blind placebo administration. Both drugs were effective anti-anxiety agents, but mianserin was significantly superior in efficacy as measured by the Physician's Global Rating of Severity of Illness. No differences between treatments were apparent using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety. There was no significant differences in terms of side-effects and both drugs increased anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth, blurred vision and constipation over baseline values. With one exception in the mianserin group, all patients who entered placebo treatment became worse.", 
    "44": "EEG and evoked potential (EP) recordings of a female (aged 70) affected with Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease (JCD) are reported. A comparison of neurophysiological tests under basal conditions and pharmacological stimulation with methylphenidate, diazepam and piracetam was performed. Diazepam and methylphenidate produced a flattening of triphasic complexes and changes in background activity; piracetam did not seem to influence the abnormal brain bioelectrical environment. The authors conclude that EEG and EP abnormalities in JCD can be ascribed to two separate and interacting sources: (1) exaggerated massive excitatory input coming from a deep thalamic pace-maker throughout the diffuse projecting system, and (2) lack of inhibitory intracortical mechanisms.", 
    "45": "A study was initiated to investigate the effect of diazepam on serum testosterone and testosterone-sensitive tissues in male rats. Diazepam was administered in a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight daily for 10 days. When compared with an equally matched group of control male rats, this dose of diazepam was associated with a significant reduction in both the weight of the ventral prostrate of treated rats and the serum testosterone levels. These changes were not associated with alterations in serum LH and FSH and the hypothalamic luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone content. Since diazepam does not interfere with the radioimmunoassay of testosterone, it is suggested that the above observations were biologically induced via direct suppression of the interstitial cells of the testis.", 
    "46": "In a single-blind study in general practice, 60 patients with anxiety neuroses were randomly allocated to receive either 0.5 mg haloperidol twice daily or 2 mg diazepam 3-times daily for 6 weeks. Eighteen patients (6 on haloperidol and 12 on diazepam) were excluded from the analysis of efficacy. On the Hamilton Rating Scale both haloperidol and diazepam reduced the anxiety and depression scores. The investigator's assessment of 14 anxiety symptoms and signs indicated that haloperidol produced significantly (p=0.05) greater symptomatic improvement than diazepam after 4 and 6 weeks of treatment, and the patients' overall response was also significantly (p less than 0.005) greater with haloperidol. After 6 weeks, 93% of patients felt 'better' or 'much better' on haloperidol, compared with 83% on diazepam. A few, minor side-effects were reported, slightly fewer on haloperidol than on diazepam. In the parameters tested in this study, haloperidol has been shown to be more effective than diazepam in the treatment of anxiety neuroses and appears to provide significantly better overall symptomatic relief and to be more acceptable to patients than diazepam.", 
    "47": "Diazepam-induced GH secretion was tested on 28 male volunteers before and after a 3-day treatment with methysergide, pimozide, or sodium valproate. Serum GH, diazepam, and blood glucose levels were determined. Without prior medication, the mean serum GH level increased 336% 1 h after diazepam administration. Treatment with the serotonin antagonist, methysergide, had no effect on the diazepam-stimulated GH secretion, whereas pimozide, the selective dopamine receptor-blocking agent, reduced the GH response to diazepam by 50% (P less than 0.05). Sodium valproate, a gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase inhibitor, also inhibited diazepam-induced GH secretion; stimulated GH levels were 51% at 30 min (P less than 0.025), 39% at 60 min (P less than 0.025), and 46% at 90 min (P less than 0.025) relative to the stimulated levels without medication. No difference was found in blood glucose or serum diazepam levels after the drug treatments relative to the values obtained under basal conditions. It is suggested that diazepam-induced GH secretion is at least partly mediated via dopaminergic mechanisms. Serotonin does not seem to be involved. It is further proposed that gamma-aminobutyric acid plays an inhibitory role in GH secretion.", 
    "48": "A double-blind trial of flupenthixol, nortriptyline and diazepam in neurotic depression using flexible dose schedules suggested that each drug is an efficient treatment for this category of depression although the patterns of response and prevalence of side-effects varied. No differences reaching a level of significance could be shown on rating scales of depression or anxiety, but trends favoured flupenthixol. However, clinical evaluation suggested flupenthixol to be more effective than diazepam on mental state examination (P less than 0.05) and to have a greater overall therapeutic effect than nortriptyline (P less than 0.05). It also had fewer side-effects than nortriptyline (P less than 0.05).", 
    "49": "The clinical effects of oxazepam and diazepam as oral premedicants were tested in a double-blind study of 60 children and 50 adults. The gas chromatographically measured concentrations of the active unconjugated forms of oxazepam and diazepam in the plasma were correlated to their clinical effects, as assessed both subjectively and objectively (sleep, sedation, apprehension, excitement, dizziness, emetic effect, headache, increase or decrease in systolic blood pressure, increase in pulse rate, venepuncture). No significant difference in the effects of these two benzodiazepine derivatives were observed, nor was there any obvious relationship between the plasma concentration and clinical effect.", 
    "50": "The effect of diazepam on the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) pressure is controversial. Therefore, a double-blind crossover study was performed on 18 healthy volunteers to determine the sphincter response to intravenous diazepam--70, 140, 280 microgram/kg, which correspond to a total dose of 5, 10, and 20 mg. respectively. After the 5 and 10 mg dose no signficant effect on LOS pressure could be observed when compared with placebo. After the 20 mg dose a significant rise in pressures (deltaPLOS) was recorded for 40 minutes with a maximum deltaPLOS of + 16.2 +/- 6.6 (mean +/- SEM) mmHg after 50 minutes (P less than 0.01) (46 +/- 1.3% increase above the basal pressure). It is concluded that diazepam does not affect lower oesophageal sphincter competence and therefore does not increase the risk of regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration in premedicated patients.", 
    "51": "We describe a modified [from Anal. Chem. 36, 2099 (1964)] procedure for determining diazepam and its pharmacologically active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, in plasma, with use of a nitrogen-sensitive detector in the gas-liquid chromatography. We used medazepam as the internal reference standard. Diazepam and desmethyldiazepam are converted to their respective benzophenones by mineral acid hydrolysis. With this procedure, as little as 100 muL of plasma can be used to determine the drug in concentrations as low as 10 microgram/L, accurately, reproducibly, and quickly. Within-run and between-run CVs for 100 microgram/L concentrations of the two compounds were 5 and 7%, respectively.", 
    "52": "The authors report on the relationship between the antianxiety effects of chronically administered chlordiazepoxide (CDX) and plasma levels of CDX and two of its metabolites, desmethylchlordiazepoxide (DMCDX) and demoxepam (DMX). Fifteen subjects with moderate to severe anxiety were studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Significant correlations were found between anxiety reduction and DMCDX and DMX plasma levels. No such correlation was observed between anxiety reduction and CDX levels. These data suggest that in chronically treated subjects, DMCDX and DMX have significant antianxiety properties which surpass those of CDX itself.", 
    "53": "This paper gives a brief review of the pharmacokinetic studies performed on pirenzepine (L S 519 Cl2, Gastrozepin hitherto. Particular attention will be paid thereby to the clinical significance of the pharmacokinetic parameters.", 
    "54": "The valid study of relationships between pharmacokinetic measurements and clinical effects of psychotropic drugs depends on: (i) analytical methods for the drugs; (ii) the fluid assessed and pharmacokinetic derivations; (iii) clinical assessments and the nature of psychiatric illness; and (iv) statistical work. Standard problems with analytical methods include lack of specificity, unjustified claims for sensitivity, and failure to recognize metabolites as potential analytical contaminants and compounds for separate study. Problems with pharmacokinetic derivations include inappropriate calculations and incorrect assignment of terms such as 'half-life'. Clinical difficulties mostly relate to variations between patient groups, selection procedures and rating methods, and to timing of samples. Statistical controversies concern the calculation of metabolite ratios, pooling of data from drugs and their metabolites, and abuse of statistical techniques. These methodological problems are illustrated by reference to work with phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants.", 
    "55": "The practical value of measuring plasma concentrations is to optimize treatment in order to attain the best balance in each particular patient between wanted clinical therapeutic effects and unwanted adverse and side-effects. This increase in treatment efficacy can be concurrent--that is, the treatment is monitored and the dosage changed as necessary--or predictive, where the results of a test dose can be used to calculate the appropriate dosage. Wanted effects include: (1) the attainment of adequate drug concentrations for the minimum period of time necessary, as in the use of antibiotics; (2) the suppression of symptoms, as in the use of the benzodiazepines in anxiety states; (3) the use of drugs to improve function, e.g. levodopa in Parkinsonism; (4) drugs are used to prevent episodes of illness; and (5) complex suppression of symptoms, as with the antidepressives and antipsychotics. The biological alternatives to plasma level monitoring depend on establishing an empirical relationship between the putative monitor and the clinical response. Such measures avoid the problem of estimation of drug concentration at the receptor. Examples include monoamine oxidase activity in platelets, the uptake of amines into platelets, neuroendocrine measures such as prolactin concentrations, the electroencephalogram, and peripheral measures such as pulse rate, pupil size and tremor.", 
    "56": "Auditory arousal thresholds of good (N = 12) and poor (N = 12) sleepers (sleep onset insomniacs) were obtained during stage 2, stage 4, and REM sleep at various times of the night. Despite claims of being \"light\" sleepers who are easily awakened by noise, poor sleeper auditory arousal thresholds were the same as those of good sleepers. Flurazepam (30 mg) increased the auditory arousal thresholds of poor sleepers (N = 6), but the increase was statistically significant only during the period of peak effect which occurred 1--2 hr after ingestion. Consistent with poor sleeper complaints of trouble falling asleep, the return to sleep (i.e., sleep latency) was significantly longer for poor than for good sleepers following stimulus arousals during the first stage 2 and first stage 4 periods of the night. Sleep latencies for good and poor sleepers did not differ significantly following subsequent arousals. The sleep latency following the first stage 2 stimulus arousal was significantly reduced in poor sleepers during flurazepam-induced sleep."
