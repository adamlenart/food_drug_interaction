When patients complained of pain, they were given either 6 microliters 0.25% bupivacaine (control group) or 6 microliters 0.25% bupivacaine + 0.05 mg kg-1 midazolam (midazolam group) epidurally at a single level between T7 and T12. Blood pressure and heart rate were similar in the two groups. Sedation was significantly greater in the midazolam group 10 min after administration. The area of analgesia was significantly larger in the midazolam group 10 and 30 min after administration and involved the entire spinal area and the head and face 10 min after administration in six patients. Amnesia was observed in 14 patients in the midazolam group but in only one in the control group. Epidural midazolam together with bupivacaine adds central analgesic, sedative, and amnesic effects to spinal analgesia and is useful for managing post-operative pain.", 
    "1": "To test whether epidural anaesthesia for foot and ankle surgery is associated with an unacceptably high incidence of inadequate surgical analgesia, we prospectively compared two groups of patients, one undergoing foot or ankle surgery (160 patients) and the other surgical procedures not performed in areas innervated by L5-S1 ( (168 patients). Lumbar epidural anaesthesia was performed in both groups by administering carbonated lignocaine 2% with adrenaline 1:200000. Seven patients in the foot-ankle group (4.4%) and 10 in the group for comparison (5.9%) exhibited inadequate surgical analgesia. This difference is not statistically significant. Within the foot-ankle group, a significantly lower dose of local anaesthetic per spinal segment had been given to patients who displayed inadequate analgesia, compared with those who exhibited satisfactory analgesia (P < 0.05).", 
    "2": "The ease of the insertion of laryngeal mask and the haemodynamic response were assessed 2 min after induction of anaesthesia with either propofol 2.5 mg kg-1 or thiopentone 4.0 mg kg-1 in 38 ASA I premedicated patients. The inserting conditions scored as excellent, good, poor and unable to insert were significantly better with propofol than with thiopentone (P < 0.001). Insertion of the laryngeal mask was followed by a transient but significant increase in both systolic (P < 0.05) and diastolic (P < 0.01) arterial pressure in the thiopentone group; there was no comparable response in the propofol group. The heart rate varied little from baseline in both groups.", 
    "3": "Thirty-five adult cardiac surgical patients received 20 mg dipotassium clorazepate orally the evening before surgery and 2 mg flunitrazepam 60 min before induction of anaesthesia. If anaesthesia was to be induced after 08.30 hours patients received an additional 20 mg dipotassium clorazepate at 06.15 hours. The following measurements were made: peripheral arterial oxygen saturation (Spo2) breathing room air; anxiety by visual analogue scale; degree of sedation; and haemodynamic variables. Mean (Spo2) was 95.9% (SD 1.8%) on the day before surgery and 95.4% (SD 1.5%) on arrival at the operating room. When the operation started after 08.30 hours, mean (Spo2) at 09.00 hours was 96.0% (SD 1.4%). There were no detected episodes of hypoxaemia after premedication. Mean anxiety score decreased significantly from 3.9 (SD 2.6) on the day before surgery to 3.3 (SD 2.1) on arrival at the operating room (patients' score; P < 0.002) and from 4.6 (SD 2.4) to 3.3 (SD 2.0) (anaesthesiologists' score; P < 0.001). Nearly all patients were considered well sedated, which was reflected by normal haemodynamic variables on arrival at the operating room. The combination of clorazepate and flunitrazepam is effective oral premedication for adult cardiac surgery, causing no obvious desaturation even when supplemental oxygen is not given.", 
    "4": "The rates of in vitro release of flunitrazepam (FN), nordiazepam (ND) and diazepam (DZ) from silastic capsules were compared and found to be in the following order: DZ > FN > ND. Rats that were implanted subcutaneously with capsules filled with FN or ND for 5 to 7 weeks before administering flumazenil (FLU) (40 mg/kg, i.v.) showed precipitated abstinence as measured by the Precipitated Abstinence Score (PAS) which included a rapid onset of clonic and tonic-clonic convulsions. Rats implanted with DZ also demonstrated significant PAS and seizures. Implantation of similar doses of DZ, FN and ND resulted in different plasma levels of parent benzodiazepines and their metabolites that corresponded with their in vitro release: DZ > FN > ND. These data indicate that, as for DZ, the capsule implantation is an effective method of producing physical dependence on FN and ND in the rat.", 
    "5": "Interactions of GABA, bicuculline methochloride and diazepam with [3H]TBOB binding to rat brain membranes were evaluated in vitro. GABA displaced [3H]TBOB binding with and IC50 of 4 microM and a slope factor near unity. The competitive GABA antagonist bicuculline methochloride shifted the displacement curve of GABA parallelly to the right, indicating that the interaction of GABA with [3H]TBOB binding is of an allosteric nature. In the presence of GABA, diazepam displaced the binding of [3H]TBOB according to a two-site model: a high affinity site with an IC50 of about 50 nM and a lower affinity site with an IC50 of about 30 microM. Bicuculline methochloride abolished the nanomolar displacement by diazepam and increased the micromolar IC50 value. These results indicate that the interaction of the high affinity diazepam site with the [3H]TBOB binding site is totally GABA dependent and that the low affinity effect of diazepam on [3H]TBOB binding is at least partially GABA dependent. It is likely that the low affinity potency of diazepam to displace [3H]TBOB binding has physiological relevance.",

    "7": "In rats rendered hyperlipidemic by the interperitoneal injection of Triton WR-1339, the administration of 4'-chlorodiazepam, a selective agonist of the peripheral type of benzodiazepine (BZO) receptors evoked significant reductions of serum lipids. PK 11195, a specific antagonist of these receptors, partially inhibited these effects. Flumazenil, a selective antagonist of the central BZD receptors, enhanced the lipid lowering activity of 4'-chlorodiazepam.", 
    "8": "The central benzodiazepine receptor tracer [N-methyl-11C]iomazenil (Ro 16-0154) was synthesized by alkylation of the desmethyl precursor noriomazenil with [11C]methyl iodide. The [11C]CH3I (prepared by reduction of [11C]CO2 with LiA1H4 followed by reaction with HI) was reacted with noriomazenil in N,N-dimethylformamide and Bu4N+OH- for 1 min at 80 degrees C and purified by HPLC (C18, 34% CH3CN/H2O 7 mL/min). The product was obtained with synthesis time 35 +/- 5 min (mean +/- SD, n = 7), radiochemical yield (EOB) 36 +/- 16%, radiochemical purity 99 +/- 1%, and specific activity 5100 +/- 2800 mCi/mumol. Absorbed radiation doses were calculated from previously acquired human biodistribution data. The urinary bladder wall received the highest dose (0.099 mGy/MBq) for 4.8 h voiding interval and the effective dose equivalent was 0.015 mSv/MBq. After i.v. injection of [11C]iomazenil in an adult baboon or healthy human volunteer, radioactivity accumulated in the cortex with time-activity curves in agreement with results obtained with [11C]flumazenil PET and [123I]iomazenil SPECT studies. The count rate was sufficient to obtain quantitative images up to 2 h post-injection with a 14 mCi injection. These results suggest that [11C]iomazenil will be a useful agent for measuring benzodiazepine receptors in vivo by positron emission tomography.", 
    "9": "We conducted a review of drugs that were most commonly associated with inducing seizures in the elderly population. The method for determining the risk of these agents includes evaluating the utilisation and the percentage of adverse events in previous studies and case reports. Classes of medications, such as anti-psychotics and antidepressants, are extensively reviewed to provide the clinician with treatment options in high risk patients. The risk of seizures secondary to the withdrawal of alcohol (ethanol) and benzodiazepines, and methods employed to minimise the risk are discussed. In addition, the management of patients with drug-induced seizures is delineated. Drug-induced seizures are a potentially serious adverse effect. It is important that clinicians are aware of which classes of medications and individual medications are associated with reducing seizure threshold.", 
    "10": "Standard antipsychotics are ineffective in some geriatric patients. In addition, they are not helpful for apathy and withdrawal. Studies have demonstrated that 5HT2 antagonists improve affective symptoms and anxiety; therefore, the efficacy of risperidone on agitation and withdrawal was considered. The literature on risperidone was reviewed, and the efficacy and limitations of risperidone observed in two geriatric patients, one with agitation and another with apathy and withdrawal. Risperidone proved to be effective in controlling disruptive behavior in geriatric patients. Combined antagonism of D2 and 5HT2 receptors might be effective in improving agitation and withdrawal. Risperidone, with both D2 and 5HT2 antagonistic properties, seems to have potential as an alternative agent in controlling agitation and withdrawal in geriatric patients. Caution and need for further observation is recommended.", 
    "11": "Managing alertness of soldiers during sustained operations is a source of serious concern for military unit commanders. A frequently employed strategy is to induce sleep before an operation, especially operations requiring prolonged travel. Sleep-inducing drugs could have an action on thermoregulation through their effect on alertness and a possible direct effect on the brain. The goal of this study was therefore to evaluate the effect of a commonly prescribed triazolam (Halcion) on thermoregulatory responses to cold-water immersion. Eight subjects were immersed twice in 18 degrees C water for up to 90 min in the morning; once after ingesting 0.25 mg triazolam (TRZ) the prior evening, and again after placebo (PLB) treatment. There were no significant differences between trials for mean duration of the immersion, the change in rectal temperature and mean skin temperature. Total metabolic heat production was similar for both conditions: 767 +/- 107 vs. 781 +/- 105 kj.m-2 for TRZ and PLB, respectively. The results should be considered in light of a large variation among the subjects in sensitivity to TRZ, which was unrelated to biometrical characteristics such as surface area-to-mass ratio, lean body mass, % body fat, and physical fitness. Although not statistically significant, there was a trend for a smaller increase in plasma free fatty acid and glycerol concentrations after water immersion with TRZ. The results suggest that the ingestion of a single dose of triazolam 11 h prior to a cold-water immersion is not likely to accelerate the rate of onset of hypothermia. Individual sensitivity, however, may predispose some sensitive subjects to negative effects in this regard.", 
    "12": "In Geneva 41 deaths associated with methadone have been observed between 1987 and 1993. In 11 cases death was caused by heroin overdose in combination with methadone. In 6 other cases (natural death, hanging, murder, road accident, drowning and burning) methadone, although in feeble doses, could have played a role in the circumstances leading to death. In 24 other cases, where methadone was the sole cause of death, 10 of these were in individuals participating in Methadone Maintenance Schemes, but none in the first two weeks of the scheme, 8 occurred in the year following release from prison (3 less than two weeks after release), 11 were associated with a parallel intake of benzodiazepines and 8 with an intake of alcohol.", 
    "13": "Fifteen patients with therapy resistant partial complex seizures with no structural lesions were examined interictally with 123-I-IOMAZENIL SPECT for measurement of benzodiazepine receptor distribution and with 99m-Tc-HMPAO SPECT for measurement of cerebral blood flow distribution. Regional abnormalities were correlated with the seizure onset patterns in EEG later recorded with implanted subdural strips. SPECT scans were made immediately after and at 1 and 2 h after intravenous injection of 123-I-Iomazenil. During that time there was a continuous change from an immediate flow-related distribution toward a more specific receptor distribution. The decay of radioactivity of I-123 in the brain was linear over time. Two patients on benzodiazepine treatment showed much faster elimination and showed no focal abnormalities. Eight patients with clear-cut unifocal seizure onset showed concordant focal benzodiazepine defects. These patients showed a progressive focus/homotopic non-focus enhancement over time much larger than the HMPAO scans in the same patients. Also the estimated focal area of abnormality was more restricted in the Iomazenil scans than in HMPAO scans. Five patients had more complex seizure onset patterns. In these patients a mismatch between the locations of abnormalities in Iomazenil and HMPAO scans were often found but benzodiazepine receptor abnormalities were more circumscribed also in these patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) make an outstanding contribution to the defence against invading bacteria. We studied the effects of midazolam, droperidol, fentanyl, and alfentanil on phagocytosis and killing of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli by PMNL in vitro. Using a method described by Eggleton et al., PMNL were isolated from venous blood samples obtained from ten volunteers. The fluorescence microscopic method mentioned by Bellinati-Pires et al. was used to examine phagocytosis and killing. Whereas both midazolam and droperidol caused a significant inhibition of phagocytosis as well as bactericidal activity, fentanyl and alfentanil did not influence these PMNL functions. In order to find out whether midazolam and droperidol are able to intensify perioperative bacterial infections in vivo as well, additional clinical studies should be conducted.", 
    "15": "To our knowledge, no previous direct associations have been made between generalized myositis ossificans and pharmacological therapy. We report a case of generalized periarticular myositis ossificans associated with the use of curare and diazepam. The previously reported associations of myositis ossificans with tetanus and burns may be misleading. It is possible that it is not the disease process itself (e.g., tetanus, severe burn) that precipitates heterotopic ossification, but the treatment of these ailments. These observations suggest the importance of early mobilization and restrained use of immobilizing drugs. Further investigation is warranted with regard to the predisposing factors of generalized myositis ossificans and to its prevention.", 
    "16": "Induction of anaesthesia in swine by thiopentone (27.1-35.7 mg/kg, mean 29.9 mg/kg) was followed by bolus doses and continuous infusion of midazolam and fentanyl (0.90 mg/kg followed by 0.90 mg/kg/h and 0.025 mg/kg followed by 0.025 mg/kg/h, respectively). This produced good anaesthesia and analgesia for up to 2 h in 6 Norwegian Landrace pigs (wt: 17-42 kg), based on responses to painful stimuli elicited by pinching the nasal septum, the mouth, the forefoot and the perineal skin area. The first responses occurred after 110 min of anaesthesia. No significant drop in rectal temperature due to the regimen was noted during monitoring periods (140-180 min). This combined intravenous anaesthetic regimen gave good anaesthesia and analgesia to pigs for up to 2 h as monitored by clinical signs. The regimen may not be sufficient for longer time periods. We cannot advocate the incorporation of neuromuscular blocking agents in this regimen.", 
    "17": "Septal surgery (submucous resection and septoplasty) has been performed as a day-case procedure routinely under general anaesthesia and local anaesthesia with sedation at the Ipswich Hospital since 1992. The outcome of the day-case septal surgery over a period of 18 months has been audited. A total of 95 cases were operated on of which 48 were under general anaesthesia (GA) and 47 under local anaesthesia (LA) with sedation using midazolam intravenously. The bleeding rate and overnight admission rate were 10.5 and 11.4 per cent respectively. The bleeding rate was the same in both GA and LA groups. The combination of local anaesthesia and sedation has been found to be safe, effective and acceptable to patients. It is concluded that septal surgery is suitable as a day procedure and that local anaesthesia combined with sedation has a definite place if carried out properly.", 
    "18": "We investigated the effect of droperidol on objective markers of cooperation and vital signs in 140 patients undergoing elective diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Procedure duration and the total doses of midazolam and meperidine required during the procedure were evaluated as objective markers of patient cooperation. The droperidol group comprised 66 patients and the placebo group 74 patients. Patient and procedure characteristics were similar for both groups. Droperidol produced a 10% reduction in procedure duration. Linear multiple regression modeling revealed droperidol to be a significant predictor of procedure duration (p = .036). Droperidol significantly reduced midazolam and meperidine requirements (p < .01). Nonetheless, four patients in the droperidol group received naloxone to reverse prolonged, excessive drowsiness. Droperidol produced a significant reduction in procedure-associated increase in pulse rate but did not exacerbate procedure-associated reduction in mean arterial pressure. Droperidol favorably influences markers of patient cooperation during elective, diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoscopy. However, the clinical significance of these changes is unclear.", 
    "19": "Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is normally treated by oral hypoglycaemic agents, but their use is excluded during pregnancy because of their potential teratogenic and hypoglycaemic effects on the fetus. This caveat was recently questioned as glyburide was shown to cross an isolated cotyledon in vitro in insignificant amounts. In the present study, placental transport of glyburide in vivo was examined as an indispensable step towards clinical trials. Tritiated glyburide, C14 albumin or C14-labelled diazepam were injected into 13, 9 and 11 pregnant rats, respectively and the radioactivity was measured thereafter in maternal blood and in whole fetal extracts. The ratios between radioactivity in fetal tissue to that in maternal blood for glyburide (0.535 +/- 0.068) were similar to those of diazepam (0.641 +/- 0.057) which readily crosses the placenta. However, they differed significantly from those for albumin (0.048 +/- 0.0004) which does not cross. Moreover, glyburide in fetal tissue consistently reflected its concentration in maternal blood when measured at consecutive intervals after intravenous injection in the mother. In contrast, albumin in fetal tissue was low at all time points regardless of its levels in maternal blood when measured at different times after injection. These data suggest that glyburide crosses the placenta of pregnant rats and should therefore be considered with caution as a hypoglycaemic agent in the treatment of gestational diabetes.", 
    "20": "Ninety-nine patients with panic disorder (PD) not comorbid with other psychiatric disorders were evaluated for 5 years using a naturalistic prospective design. The probability of achieving full remission, albeit transitory, was 37.5%, whereas 72.8% of cases showed a consistent amelioration. However, among patients with an initial positive outcome, the probability of remaining well was 41.4% after 5 years. When the general course of the disorder during the follow-up period was considered, only 12.12% of the subjects had a complete and stable remission of symptoms, whereas 47.47% had a generally positive but not fully satisfactory amelioration either due to infrequent recurrences of the illness or to chronic continuation of symptoms at a mild level. On the other hand, 40.40% of the subjects reported an overall poor outcome because of the presence of a recurrent pattern of illness (11.11%) or because the periods of well-being did not represent more than 40% of the time being considered (29.29%). Among the predictors taken into consideration, only duration of illness before intake showed a strict relationship with long-term outcome, with patients having a lesser duration of illness at the moment of the index episode showing a significantly better outcome.", 
    "21": "Because diazepam appeared to affect body weight, spastic myelopathy patients for whom this drug had been prescribed but in whom the dose was altered were compared with similar patients, without changes in antispastic medication. A retrospective survey averaging 10 months was conducted for these two groups to determine weight changes of 10 pounds or more. After reduction or discontinuation of diazepam in seven patients, all lost weight -12 to 35 lbs at rates of 0.9 to 3.5 lb per month. On unchanged medication, only one of twelve patients lost as much as 10 lb, p < 0.001. After partially or fully restoring diazepam in four patients, all gained weight -7 to 26 lbs-at rates of 1.8 to 4.3 lbs per month. Three of the four patients and two of the 12 without medication change gained as much as 10 pounds, p = 0.03. We conclude that body weight in myelopathy patients is affected by the use of diazepam. The effect of other medications used for spasms was not assessed.", 
    "22": "The negative inotropic effect of carbachol, as well as phosphoinositide hydrolysis, was measured in atria from neonatal and adult rats. Carbachol increased phosphoinositide hydrolysis and decreased dF/dt of both neonatal and adult atria; however, the neonatal atria showed hypereactivity to carbachol as compared with adult atria. Inhibition of phospholipase C reduced the supersensitivity to carbachol upon contractility in neonatal atria producing values similar to those of the adult atria, suggesting that muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAchR) stimulation is secondary to receptor-mediated hydrolysis of phosphoinositides. Pharmacological analysis with mAchR antagonists tends to support the idea that m1 and m2 subtypes are the most important mediators of the response to carbachol in neonatal atria. In adult atria, the effect of carbachol is coupled only to mAchR m2 subtypes.", 
    "23": "The mechanisms underlying amino acid neurotoxicity may involve a rise in the intracellular concentration of calcium. Some neurons appear to die as a consequence of increased intracellular calcium levels induced by excitatory amino acids. One month after injection of ibotenic acid in the rat basal forebrain, the induced formation of calcium deposits and concomitant glial reaction were studied. Alizarine Red-positive calcium deposits were observed after ibotenic acid injection in the ventral part of the globus pallidus, but not in the medial septum. These deposits were present in the globus pallidus, ventral pallidum, substantia innominata, zona incerta, lateral hypothalamic area, entopeduncular nucleus, medial amygdaloid nucleus and several thalamic nuclei. Three types of round shaped deposit were identified morphologically. Differential astroglial and microglial reactions, studied autoradiographically with the monoamine oxidase-B marker [3H]Ro19-6327 and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor marker [3H]Ro5-4864 respectively, were observed after both lesions. Our data suggest that excitotoxic lesions in the globus pallidus and medial septum lead with time to different neurodegenerative consequences and glial reactions. This differential sensitivity is discussed on the basis of the presence of different glutamate receptor subtypes and calcium-binding proteins.", 
    "24": "Earlier reports of associations between panic disorder, depression, and ischemic heart disease have not evaluated the role of the drugs used to treat these conditions. As part of a larger study on reducing cardiovascular disease in an entire community, we estimated the association between psychotropic drugs and ischemic heart disease in a large community-based population using a cohort study design. We defined exposure as current use of psychotropic medications at the time of the health interview. We determined ischemic heart disease by International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification, codes and by an epidemiologic algorithm using clinical diagnostic criteria. An elevated risk for clinically significant ischemic cardiac events was moderately associated with benzodiazepine use [relative risk (RR) = 2.0; 90% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-3.9] and strongly associated with antidepressant use (RR = 5.7; 90% CI = 2.6-12.8), although the latter estimate was based on only six antidepressant users who had an ischemic event.", 
    "25": "The role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in pancreatic growth and secretory development in fetal and neonatal guinea pigs was investigated by CCK receptor blockade. For the last 20 days of gestation, sows received the CCKA receptor antagonist, MK329 (25 nmol/kg/h) by continuous subcutaneous infusion. Alternatively, neonates from untreated females received an MK329 infusion for the first 4 or 15 days following birth. Pancreatic weight, DNA, RNA, protein, and amylase content per 100 g body weight and secretory responses to CCK, carbamylcholine, and phorbol ester were determined at birth and 4 days in animals receiving MK329 in utero and were measured at 4 and 15 days in neonatally infused animals. No significant changes in pancreatic growth parameters were seen in MK329-treated animals compared to controls, except for a small (14%; p < 0.02) decrease in weight after 15 days of neonatal exposure. Enhanced amylase secretion in response to CCK and carbamylcholine was seen in all groups receiving MK329 (all p values < 0.00001). Pancreatic growth and secretion were not inhibited by CCKA receptor blockade, which suggests that the effects of CCK mediated by the CCKA receptor are not essential for growth or development of the pancreatic amylase secretory response in the neonatal guinea pig.",

    "27": "The model is based on the equation derived by Higuchi for the diffusional release of soluble drugs from polymeric matrices and on our recent measurements of the concentration dependency of adinazolam diffusivity in dilute HPMC gels and solutions. The assumptions made in applying the model include (i) that diffusion is the sole mechanism of drug release (i.e. swelling kinetics are ignored), and (ii) that the surface area-to-volume ratio and concentrations of adinazolam, lactose and HPMC in the gel layer are proportional to that of the dry tablet.", 
    "28": "Reasonable correlations were obtained between the experimental drug release rate ratios and the predicted drug release rate ratios for ER adinazolam mesylate (R2 = 0.82) and low-dose (0.5 mg) ER alprazolam tablets (R2 = 0.87). The predictive power for a 6-fold higher dose of ER alprazolam tablets was not as good (R2 = 0.52).", 
    "29": "These results are consistent with previous knowledge of the release mechanisms of these formulations. ER adinazolam mesylate and ER alprazolam 0.5 mg exhibit primarily a diffusion controlled release mechanism, while ER alprazolam 3 mg deviates from pure diffusional release. The limitations of the model are discussed and point to the need for continued study of the swelling kinetics of matrix ER systems.",

    "32": "In binary component solutions, adinazolam diffusivity is generally found to exhibit an exponential dependence on the concentration of the viscosity-inducing agent (VIA), which is glucose, lactose, maltoheptaose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) or drug itself. An increasing obstruction power to drug diffusion from glucose to HPMC is observed, which can be related to the polymerization degree of the VIA. In contrast, adinazolam diffusivity in HPMC gels shows little dependence upon the polymer viscosity grades examined (K100LV, K4M, and K15M). The temperature dependence of adinazolam diffusivity in dilute VIA solutions reveals that the diffusion barrier for the drug is similar to that for self-diffusion of water.", 
    "33": "The retarding effect from the VIA for drug diffusion is concluded to be primarily associated with a steric obstruction mechanism. In multicomponent gels with varied concentrations of drug, lactose and HPMC, the drug diffusivity can be approximately described as an exponential function of the summation of the products of the proportionality constant (Ki) and concentration for each VIA component. In contrast, water diffusion behavior shows an universal exponential dependence upon the VIA concentration and small dependence upon the nature of the VIA. The interpretation of the diffusivity data is discussed and compared to two existing diffusion models (Yasuda and Mackie-Meares models).", 
    "34": "Gastropancreatic neuroendocrine cells synthesize large amounts of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This amino acid neurotransmitter appears to be stored in and released from, vesicles similar to small synaptic vesicles. So far, the function of GABA in gastropancreatic, neuroendocrine cells has not been clarified. Previous work suggested that only pancreatic, glucagon-producing alpha 2 cells contain functional GABAA receptors. Using subunit-specific antibodies in sections of human antral mucosa, a human gastrinoma and rat pancreas, we show that expression of GABAA receptors is abundant in gastropancreatic, neuroendocrine cells. Using the patch-clamp technique in the whole-cell mode we demonstrate that both the rat insulinoma cell line RIN 38 and the amphicrine cell line AR42J express functional GABAA receptors, which are characterized by a relatively low benzodiazepine and Zn2+ sensitivity and by an insensitivity to the inverse benzodiazepine agonist 6,7-alpha-methoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM). In contrast to neurons, activation of GABAA receptors leads to a membrane depolarization. This depolarization presumably activates voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, resulting in an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, as shown with the fluorimetric dye fura-2. The combination of GABA release, GABAA receptor activation and the [Ca2+]i increase could constitute an autocrine mechanism, modulating the release of hormones such as gastrin, insulin and somatostatin.",

    "40": "Short-acting benzodiazepine hypnotics may phase-shift circadian rhythms and improve adaptation of sleep patterns to abrupt time shifts, depending on the timing of administration. The aim of the present study was to determine whether bedtime administration of zolpidem, a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic, causes alterations in circadian rhythmicity or in the normal interactions between sleep and hormones. Eight normal women (aged 21-33 years) each participated in a baseline study and a study with zolpidem administration. On each occasion, blood samples were obtained at 20-minute intervals for 25 hours, starting at 1000 hours. Zolpidem (10 mg) was given orally at 2245 hours. Zolpidem administration was associated with an increase in stages III + IV sleep. Cortisol, melatonin, thyrotropin and growth hormone profiles were similar in both experimental conditions. In contrast, though remaining in the normal range, the nocturnal elevation of prolactin was enhanced two-fold in all subjects after zolpidem during early sleep, and prolactin levels were still 50% higher than baseline in late sleep. Morning levels were similar in both studies. In conclusion, bedtime administration of 10 mg zolpidem, a standard clinical dosage, systematically induces a transient moderate hyperprolactinemia, but does not alter other sleep-related hormonal secretions or endocrine markers of circadian rhythmicity.", 
    "41": "Ligands to the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) accumulate in hepatic encephalopathy; the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil can reverse some manifestations of this condition. This study was designed to explore the effects of flumazenil on cognitive function and anxiety levels in cirrhotic patients without hepatic encephalopathy. Twenty such patients--ten alcoholic, ten nonalcoholics--and ten normal volunteers matched for age and sex were randomly allocated to treatment order (flumazenil or placebo first) in a double-blind cross-over trial. Cognitive function was evaluated with a battery of psychological tests shown previously to be sensitive to the impairment induced by liver disease. Cirrhotic patients performed worse than controls on several tests: digit cancellation, digit symbol substitution, key tapping and Reitan's trail B test. Flumazenil did not reverse these cognitive impairments but it did induce anxiety in nonalcoholic cirrhotics. On one index of memory--delayed word recall--alcoholics performed worse than nonalcoholic cirrhotics. Flumazenil reversed this memory impairment in the alcoholic cirrhotic group. These results suggest that alcohol consumption induces changes at the BZR that are different from changes induced solely by liver impairment.", 
    "42": "The role of opioid systems in the anticonflict effect of chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and pentobarbital was evaluated with a modified Vogel procedure. First, morphine, ineffective by itself, was combined with subeffective or marginally effective doses of the benzodiazepines in order to detect possible potentiation. However, the combined treatment reduced licking in the Vogel procedure as well as in a licking test where no shock was administered. Several doses of the benzodiazepines and pentobarbital were then administered in combination with several doses of the opiate antagonist naloxone. A dose-dependent inhibition of anticonflict effect was obtained. In an additional experiment, it was shown that naloxone blocked the effects of diazepam in the elevated plus-maze procedure. Motor deficiencies, as evaluated with a rotarod test, produced by the benzodiazepines and pentobarbital could not be antagonized by naloxone. It is concluded that opioids are important for the anticonflict but not for the motor effects of these drugs. An analysis of published studies concerning the interaction of opioids and benzodiazepines in several procedures supposed to reflect anxiolytic effects shows that the inhibition obtained with naloxone is reliable and not procedure specific. The mechanisms by which opiate antagonists produce this inhibition of anticonflict activity are not known. It is tentatively suggested that opioid activation associated with stress may be a necessary component of anxiolysis.", 
    "43": "Single doses of alprazolam (0, 0.5, 1.5 mg) or adinazolam mesylate sustained release tablets (SR) (0, 15, 45 mg) were administered to separate groups of 12 healthy men in a crossover design. Psychomotor performance was assessed by digit symbol substitution (DSST), and memory was assessed using a test battery which reflects various aspects of memory, including attention/working memory, explicit memory (recall of categorically related words), semantic memory (fragmented picture recognition, generation of category exemplars), and implicit memory (time saved in resolving fragmented pictures on the second exposure). Maximal psychomotor performance and memory decrements for the highest active doses were significantly different from placebo for all tasks at some time after dosing. The maximum decrement in DSST was not significantly different between drugs at the high dose (P = 0.288). Maximum attention/working memory decrements were significantly different between the high doses of the active compounds (P = 0.031), and the difference in maximum category recall decrement was marginally significant (P = 0.067). Access to knowledge memory was not significantly altered by these drugs; these results are similar to those obtained for other benzodiazepines. Both drugs exhibited slight effects on implicit memory. The results suggest that the sedative and memory effects of these triazolobenzodiazepines may not be closely related and suggest that adinazolam has a somewhat different spectrum of cognitive effects relative to alprazolam.", 
    "44": "The effects of infusions of the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) full agonist chlordiazepoxide (CDP) or the full inverse agonist beta-CCM into the basal forebrain on behavioral vigilance were tested. Vigilance was measured by using a previously characterized task that requires the animals to discriminate between visual signals of variable length and non-signal events. Measures of performance included hits, misses, correct rejections, false alarms, side bias, and errors of omission. Following the infusion of saline (0.5 microliters/hemisphere), the relative number of hits varied with signal length. In response to shorter signals, the number of hits decreased over time, indicating a vigilance decrement. Infusions of CDP (20, 40 micrograms/hemisphere) initially decreased the relative number of hits in response to shorter signals and, later in the course of the test sessions, to longer signals as well. CDP did not affect the relative number of correct rejections. In contrast, infusions of the inverse agonist beta-CCM (1.5, 3.0 micrograms/hemisphere) did not affect the relative number of hits but decreased the relative number of correct rejections (i.e., increased the number of false alarms). These data suggest that the basal forebrain mediates the attentional effects of BZR ligands. As systemic or intrabasalis administration of BZR agonists and inverse agonists was previously demonstrated to decrease and augment, respectively, activated cortical acetylcholine (ACh) efflux, their effects on behavioral vigilance are hypothesized to be mediated via their effects on cortical ACh.", 
    "45": "This randomized double-blind study in 342 mildly to moderately depressive outpatients investigated the antidepressant effectiveness and speed of action of lorazepam, alprazolam and amitriptyline versus placebo. Six weeks of drug treatment were followed by a drug taper period, a control period with placebo and a control period without placebo, of 2 weeks duration each. Clinical improvement was assessed by rating scales (Clinical Global Impressions, Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression and Anxiety) and patient's self-ratings (Patient's Global Impressions, Self-rating Depression Scale and Visual Analogue Scale). At the end of week 6 all active drugs showed similar efficacy which was significantly superior to placebo. Compared to placebo, onset of efficacy was earlier on benzodiazepines than on amitriptyline . While tapering by decreasing the dosage, replacing drug with placebo and finally discontinuing placebo, clear withdrawal phenomena were not seen, but 20% of patients, equally distributed to all treatment groups, did not want to stop taking tablets after replacing drug with placebo. Drop-out rate during the treatment period was very low (9%). Significantly interfering adverse effects were seen in 27 patients, without predominance in one of the active drug groups.", 
    "46": "In the present study, we established receptor binding assays to evaluate the water extracts of ten central nervous system (CNS)-active Chinese herbal drugs. These ten herbal drugs are Chaihu (Radix Bupleuri), Chuanxiong (Rhizoma Chuanxiong), Danggui (Radix Angelicae sinensis), Danshen (Radix Salviae miltiorrhizae), Duhuo (Radix Angelicae pubescentis), Hangqin (Radix Scutellariae), Qinjiao (Radix Gentianae macrophyllae), Shengma (Rhizoma Cimicifugae), Suanzaoren (Semen Zizphi spinose), and Yangjihua (Flos Daturae). The results indicated that these water extracts contained the principles acting on the dopamine (D1 & D2), muscarinice acetylcholine (M1), or 5-HT (5-HT1A & 5-HT2) receptors, or the benzodiazepine and the gamma-amino-n-butyric acid (GABA) binding sites of GABAA receptors as determined by receptor binding assays. The receptors or binding sites which predominantly acted by each water extract are listed as follows: Chaihu: D2, 5-HT1A, GABA; Chuanxiong: GABA, 5-HT1A; Danggui: GABA, 5-HT1A; Danshen: BDZ; Duhuo: GABA, 5-HT1A, D2, D1; Hangqin: BDZ, D1, 5-HT1A; Qinjiao: GABA, BDZ, 5-HT1A, D2; Shengma: 5-HT1A; Suanzaoren: 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, GABA; Yangjihua: M1, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2. These results provided evidence to explain the CNS effects of these herbal drugs at the receptor level. Furthermore, these results provided information to direct the isolation and purification of receptor-interactive compounds from these herbal drugs.", 
    "47": "We attempted to determine the relationship between psychiatric symptoms and psychotropic drug use in persons with Alzheimer's disease based on a multicenter patient registry of 671 community-living persons diagnosed with the disease by published criteria. Logistic regression was performed to determine which symptoms were associated psychotropic use after controlling for age, sex, and Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score. At least one psychotropic drug was reported by 31% of patients, and 66% had at least one psychiatric symptom. Antipsychotics were associated with a lower MMSE score (odds ratio = 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.88-0.97), emotional lability (OR = 4.52, 95% CI 1.69-11.94), and hallucinations (OR = 6.54, 95% CI 2.99-14.26). Antidepressants were associated with depressive symptoms (OR = 5.8, 95% CI 2.61-13.46), and benzodiazepines with a lower MMSE score (OR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.90-0.97). Community-living persons with Alzheimer's disease are frequently prescribed psychotropic drugs; however, more than 50% of patients with a psychiatric symptom did not report taking one of these agents. This suggests that alternative therapies and no treatment are also prevalent.", 
    "48": "To investigate the utility of neuroreceptor imaging in ischaemic cerebrovascular disorders, dual-tracer autoradiography using 99Tcm-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) for the evaluation of cerebral blood flow and 125I-iomazenil for the evaluation of central-type benzodiazepine receptor density was performed in experimental brain ischaemia created by occlusion of the unilateral middle cerebral artery of the rat. In the acute phase of ischaemia, 125I-iomazenil accumulation showed less of a decrease than 99Tcm-HMPAO in the cerebral cortex of the lateral convexity and in the lateral segment of the caudate putamen in the lesioned cerebral hemisphere. In the sub-acute phase, both 125I-iomazenil and 99Tcm-HMPAO accumulation increased in the lesion compared with the acute phase. A large accumulation of 99Tcm-HMPAO and 125I-iomazenil in the lesion was considered to be due to luxury perfusion and penetration of 125I-iomazenil hydrophilic metabolites from the blood into the brain tissue through the altered blood-brain barrier. In the chronic phase, 125I-iomazenil accumulation showed a more marked decrease than 99Tcm-HMPAO in the lesion. Moreover, the ipsilateral thalamus, which is remote from the lesion, revealed decreased 125I-iomazenil accumulation despite normal 99Tcm-HMPAO accumulation. Since the central-type benzodiazepine receptors are principally located not on the glial cells but on the neurons, the receptor density may exhibit a change that parallels the neuron density. These results suggest that central-type benzodiazepine receptor imaging is useful for the evaluation of neuronal damage when used in conjunction with brain perfusion imaging in ischaemic cerebrovascular disorders, except in the sub-acute phase.", 
    "49": "1. The withdrawal properties of the endogenous steroid progesterone (P) were tested in female rats as a function of benzodiazepine modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA)-gated current with the use of the whole cell patch-clamp technique on acutely dissociated CA1 hippocampal neurons. In a previous study, this steroid was shown to exhibit withdrawal properties, behaviorally. 2. One day withdrawal from in vivo administration of physiological doses of P (5 mg ip, 5 days/wk for 3 withdrawal cycles) or its metabolite, the GABAA modulator 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (3 alpha,5 alpha-THP or allopregnanolone, 20 mg/kg ip) prevented the normally potentiating effect of lorazepam (LZM; 10(-7)-10(-4) M) on GABAA-gated current. Withdrawal from 500 micrograms P administered concomitantly with 2 micrograms 17 beta-estradiol also markedly diminished LZM potentiation of GABAA current. This effect was seen only after three withdrawal cycles. 3. P withdrawal produced no inhibitory effect on either basal levels of GABAA-evoked current, the GABAA EC50, or barbiturate (+/-Pentobarbital, 10(-7)-10(-4) M) modulation of this parameter. 4. The effect of steroid withdrawal on LZM modulation of GABAA-evoked current was blocked by picrotoxin as well as by indomethacin, a drug that prevents conversion of P to its metabolite, the GABAA modulator 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP. These results suggest that the withdrawal properties of P may be due to changes in GABAA receptor function produced by 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP.", 
    "50": "GABAA receptors were localized within laminar preparations of the rat distal colon myenteric plexus using a monoclonal antibody (mAb 62-3G1) to the affinity purified GABAA receptor/benzodiazepine receptor/Cl- channel complex. The immunofluorescence procedure showed that approximately half of the myenteric ganglion cells displayed extensive GABAA receptor labelling of their soma. This population was further characterised by treating some GABAA-receptor-labelled laminar preparations for the histochemical demonstration of nitric oxide (NO) synthase-related NADPH-dependent diaphorase activity. A subpopulation of the GABAA-receptor-immunoreactive cells (35%) were also found to display intense NO-synthase-related activity. These findings extend our understanding of the GABAA-receptor-related innervation of the rat gut wall herein referred to as 'A-GABAergic' and provides an anatomical basis for the pharmacologically-identified GABA-nitrergic pathway in the mammalian gut.", 
    "51": "The present study was designed to compare the allosteric coupling between the Cl- channel of the GABAA receptor and the different benzodiazepine recognition site subtypes (BZ sites) in the cerebral cortex of newborn (5-day-old) and adult rats (90-day-old). To this aim, we reexamined the heterogeneity of cortical GABAA receptors in self- and cross-competition binding experiments using [3H]flunitrazepam and two ligands with higher affinity for benzodiazepine BZ1 sites relative to benzodiazepine BZ2 sites, the triazolopyridazine 3-methyl-6-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,2,4-triazolo [4,3-b] pyridazine (CL 218,872) and the imidazopyridine N,N,6-trimethyl-2-(4-methylphenyl)-imidazo[1,2-a]-pyridine-3-acetamide hemitartrate (zolpidem). Benzodiazepine BZ1 sites accounted for 52% of the total number of binding sites in adult rats, but were not detected in newborn rats. On the other hand, two classes of benzodiazepine BZ2 sites with high and low affinity for zolpidem were present in newborn and adult rats. These sites were designated as benzodiazepine BZ2H (high affinity for zolpidem, Kd approximately 150 nM) and benzodiazepine BZ2L (low affinity for zolpidem, Kd approximately 3000 nM). High densities of benzodiazepine BZ2H sites were measured in both newborn and adult rats (75% and 41% of the total number of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites, respectively), whereas benzodiazepine BZ2L sites accounted for 25% and 7% of the total number of cortical sites in neonates and adults, respectively. Flunitrazepam, CL 218,872 and zolpidem inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the binding of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) to the convulsant site of cortical GABAA receptors in newborn and adult rats. The IC50 for flunitrazepam was about 3-fold greater in adults than in neonates. This rightward shift in the concentration-response curve may be due to a decrease with age in the intrinsic efficacy of flunitrazepam. In contrast, CL 218,872 and zolpidem were 4-fold more potent at inhibiting [35S]TBPS binding in adult rats relative to neonates. The different affinities of CL 218,872 and zolpidem for benzodiazepine BZ1 and BZ2 receptors may account, at least in part, for the age-related changes in their inhibitory potencies. These results demonstrate that benzodiazepine BZ2 sites mediate the modulation of [35S]TBPS binding by benzodiazepine recognition site ligands in the cerebral cortex of newborn rats. Further, benzodiazepine BZ2 sites may be involved in the inhibition of [35S]TBPS binding by flunitrazepam, CL 218,872 and zolpidem in the cerebral cortex of adult rats.", 
    "52": "Intracerebroventricular administration of CCK-8S was associated with a stimulation of gastric pepsinogen secretion from anaesthetized rats; similar effects were induced by CCK-8S given intravenously. The excitatory effect of intracerebroventricular CCK-8S was not modified by central injection of L-364,718 or L-365,260, whereas both these antagonists, given by intravenous route, prevented the pepsigogue action of parenteral CCK-8S. Intracerebroventricular or intravenous CCK-8S also increased basal acid secretion, this latter effect being prevented by parenteral L-365,260 but not L-364,718. It is suggested that centrally applied CCK-8S evokes pepsinogen secretion through the activation of peripheral CCK-A and CCK-B receptors.", 
    "53": "It has been reported that activation of the GABAA receptor complex by different agents such as barbiturates and neurosteroids can negatively regulate the hypothalamopituitary-gonadal axis. Recently, an 86-amino acid polypeptide with high affinity for diazepam binding sites, termed diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI), has been found in the rat brain. DBI as well as a peptide derived from DBI, the octadecaneuropeptide DBI[33-50] (ODN), can interact with the GABAA receptor complex. In order to investigate the role of these endogenous ligands for GABAA receptors on GnRH gene expression, we studied the effects of the acute administration (4 h before sacrifice) of ODN injected alone or in combination with the GABAA agonist muscimol on GnRH mRNA levels. Treatment with ODN produced a 31% decrease in the number of silver grains overlying labelled neurones. This effect was not modified by the concomitant administration of muscimol. The administration of the GABAA antagonist picrotoxin not only reversed the inhibitory effect of ODN but induced a 24% increase in the hybridization signal. This stimulating influence of picrotoxin was less striking (15% over control levels) when muscimol was administered with ODN. These data clearly indicate that a potential endogenous neuropeptide can positively interact with the GABAA receptor complex to modulate GnRH neuronal activity.", 
    "54": "Using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique, we have evaluated the effects of several inverse agonists on GABA current amplitude in Xenopus oocytes. Oocytes were injected with cRNA coding for primate alpha 1, alpha 2, or alpha 3 subunits in combination with beta 1 gamma 2, beta 2 gamma 2, or beta 3 gamma 2 subunits. In the presence of CGS 8216, we observed greater inhibition in alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2, alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2, alpha 1 beta 3 gamma 2, and alpha 3 beta 1 gamma 2 subunit combinations than in other subunit combinations (p < 0.022). DMCM also showed subunit selective inhibition (p < 0.035) whereas FG 7142 did not (p > 0.075). The above findings indicate that drug structure, alpha subunits, and beta subunits interact to influence the magnitude of inhibition of GABAA R subtypes.", 
    "55": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the value of local versus intravenous anaesthesia in the reduction of acute shoulder dislocations. Patients with a primary traumatic dislocation of the shoulder were randomized to either local lidocaine or intravenous anaesthesia with pethidine/diazepam. The local method was performed with 20 ml of 1% lidocaine. The intravenous method was performed with pethidine/diazepam injected intravenously. The patients were observed for any complication during and after the procedure and the used methods were evaluated using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). In the period from November 1991 to September 1993 81 patients were admitted to our departments and 68 patients were included. Average age was 48 years (range 15-79) with 29 men and 39 women. Thirty-five patients were randomized to intravenous anaesthesia, 33 had a successful reduction and two failed. Thirty-three patients received local anaesthesia, 32 succeeded and one failed. Ten patients treated with the intravenous method had respiratory depression and six required antidote. No systemic or local side effects and no neuro-vascular injuries were recorded with the use of lidocaine. We did not observe any superficial or deep infection in the lidocaine group. There was no statistical difference between the average VAS value in the two groups. Local anaesthesia used to reduce acute primary anterior dislocation of the shoulder is a simple, safe and well-accepted method with significantly fewer respiratory complications.", 
    "56": "To determine the extent and patterns of benzodiazepine use among heroin users, and whether preferences for different benzodiazepines exist among this group.", 
    "57": "210 heroin users who were current users of benzodiazepines volunteered for the study and completed a structured questionnaire.", 
    "58": "Heroin users had used a median of five different benzodiazepines, most commonly diazepam. Almost half the subjects (48%; 95% CI, 41-55) had injected benzodiazepines, 17% (95% CI, 12-22) within the preceding six months. Diazepam and temazepam were the most widely injected benzodiazepines.", 
    "59": "Flunitrazepam, diazepam and temazepam should be prescribed to heroin users with caution. A less popular and rarely injected benzodiazepine, nitrazepam, may be a better option for this group.", 
    "60": "The expression of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) and diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) were studied in human astrocytic tumors using immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization. Both PBR and DBI were prominently expressed in neoplastic cells, whereas in normal brain their amount was low or undetectable. Immunocytochemical double staining demonstrated that PBR and DBI were present in the same cells, suggesting that DBI may act in an autocrine manner in these cells. Analysis of 86 cases showed that PBR expression was statistically significantly associated with tumor malignancy grade (P = 0.004) and the proliferative index as determined by immunocytochemistry with the MIB-1 antibody (P = 0.004). Patients having tumors with high levels of PBR-immunoreactive cells had a shorter life expectancy than patients whose tumors showed lower PBR contents (P = 0.024). In conclusion, these results show that PBR expression is higher in neoplastic cells than in normal brain tissue. They also suggest that PBR immunocytochemistry might be useful in evaluating malignancy in brain tumors.", 
    "61": "Some animal data have raised the possibility that benzodiazepines influence the risk of selected cancers. With data collected in 1977-1991 in a US hospital-based study, the authors assessed the relation of benzodiazepine use to the risk of 11 cancers: breast (6,056 patients), large bowel (2,203), malignant melanoma (1,457), lung (1,365), endometrium (812), ovary (767), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (382), testis (314), Hodgkin's disease (299), thyroid (111), and liver (37). Cases were compared with cancer controls (3,777 patients with other cancers) and noncancer controls (1,919 patients admitted for acute nonmalignant disorders). Relative risks were estimated for benzodiazepine use at least 4 days a week for at least 1 month, initiated at least 2 years before admission (sustained use) by multiple logistic regression with control for confounding factors. Results derived with noncancer controls were similar to those derived with cancer controls. For sustained benzodiazepine use relative to no use, relative risk estimates for all 11 cancers were compatible with 1.0 at the 0.05 level of significance. Relative risk estimates for durations of at least 5 years were also compatible with 1.0, with the exceptions of an increased estimate, of borderline statistical significance, for endometrial cancer, and a decreased estimate for ovarian cancer. Relative risk estimates both for sustained use that continued into the 2-year period before admission and for sustained use that ended up to > or = 10 years previously were compatible with 1.0, suggesting a lack of tumor promotion and no increase in the risk after a latent interval. Results were also null for diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and other benzodiazepines considered separately. The results suggest absence of association between benzodiazepine use and the cancers considered, with the evidence stronger for the cancers with larger numbers of subjects. The similarity of results derived with cancer and noncancer controls suggests that benzodiazepines do not influence the risk of cancer as a whole.", 
    "62": "Benzodiazepine hypnotics and analogs promote the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in the brain. The individual substances of this class differ mainly with respect to their elimination half-life. They are all effective hypnotics, but exhibit a number of undesired effects. Hypnotics should be administered generally for the short-term treatment of insomnia, and they should be prescribed for a prolonged time period only exceptionally.", 
    "63": "The pharmacological and physiological properties of ligand-gated ion channels are dependent on their subunit composition; spontaneously occurring changes in subunit composition during neuronal development may result in dramatic functional differences between embryonic and adult forms of the receptor complex. In the present study, in situ hybridization with antisense cRNA probes was used to examine the subunit composition of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA/benzodiazepine (GABAA/BZ) receptor in the developing inferior olivary complex. This receptor is thought to be a pentameric chloride channel comprised of selected alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and rho subunits, the majority of which have several isoforms: alpha 1-6, beta 1-4, gamma 1-4, and rho 1,2. Among the 13 subunit variants present in the mammalian central nervous system, alpha 2-5, beta 3, and gamma 1,2 mRNAs are expressed at significant levels in the inferior olivary complex. Two clearly different temporal patterns of GABAA/BZ receptor subunit mRNA expression were observed: The expression of alpha 3, alpha 5, beta 3, and gamma 2 mRNAs was at a peak during embryonic and early postnatal development followed by rapid down-regulation thereafter. Conversely, alpha 2, alpha 4, and gamma 1 mRNA expression was very low or absent during early development, and a pronounced increase was observed at the end of postnatal week 1. These studies suggest that there are developmental changes in the subunit composition of the GABAA/BZ receptor in inferior olivary neurons. These changes in subunit expression, which occur during a period of major alterations in afferent and efferent synaptic connections, may subserve a change in the role of GABA from its function as a neurotrophic factor to that of an inhibitory neurotransmitter.", 
    "64": "The effects of the non-NMDA receptor antagonists, the new alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA)-selective receptor antagonist, LY326325, and the AMPA/kainate-selective receptor antagonist, NBQX (6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo(f)quinoxaline-2,3-(1H,4H)dione), on plus-maze behavior and locomotor activity were examined. LY326325 induced a dose-dependent decrease in the per cent time spent in open arms as well as in the per cent entries into the open arms. NBQX caused a dose-dependent reduction in the per cent time spent in open arms but had no effect on the per cent entries into the open arms. The behavioral actions of the AMPA receptor antagonists were observed at doses which had no influence on the locomotor activity of the animals. Based upon the current findings it is suggested that AMPA receptor antagonists produce a dose-dependent increase of anxiogenic behavior in the plus-maze test situation.", 
    "65": "It has been previously shown that retinal ganglion cells have the ability to synthesize steroids including neuroactive steroids such as pregnenolone sulfate. Since ganglion cells possess GABAA/benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors and neurosteroids modulate retinal GABAA receptor function, we investigated the role of these receptors in isolated rat retina neurosteroidogenesis. Ligands for central-type BZ receptors stimulated retinal pregnenolone synthesis. Clonazepam was the most potent ligand examined acting at nanomolar concentrations. Moreover, the effective steroidogenesis stimulatory dose (ED50) for these ligands and the Ki to inhibit [3H]flunitrazepam binding showed a coefficient of correlation of r = 0.87, suggesting the involvement of the central-type BZ receptors in this event. Ro 5-4864, which preferentially binds to peripheral-type BZ receptors, was less efficacious and potent whereas PK 11195 did not affect the basal pregnenolone formation and did not antagonize the Ro 5-4864 stimulated steroid synthesis. The GABAergic agonist muscimol, stimulated neurosteroid synthesis and this effect was reversed by the GABAergic antagonists bicuculline and picrotoxinin. In addition, these antagonists decreased basal pregnenolone formation, suggesting a tonic GABAergic control of the steroidogenic pathway, and reduced clonazepam-stimulated steroidogenesis. These results, together with the reported ability of neurosteroids to modulate GABAA receptor function, suggest a novel regulatory mechanism to control the inhibitory transmission.", 
    "66": "Eclampsia, the occurrence of a seizure in association with pre-eclampsia, remains an important cause of maternal mortality. Although it is standard practice to use an anticonvulsant for management of eclampsia, the choice of agent is controversial and there has been little properly controlled evidence to support any of the options. 1687 women with eclampsia were recruited into an international multicentre randomised trial comparing standard anticonvulsant regimens. Primary measures of outcome were recurrence of convulsions and maternal death. Data are available for 1680 (99.6%) women: 453 allocated magnesium sulphate versus 452 allocated diazepam, and 388 allocated magnesium sulphate versus 387 allocated phenytoin. Most women (99%) received the anticonvulsant that they had been allocated. Women allocated magnesium sulphate had a 52% lower risk of recurrent convulsions (95% CI 64% to 37% reduction) than those allocated diazepam (60 [13.2%] vs 126 [27.9%]; ie, 14.7 [SD 2.6] fewer women with recurrent convulsions per 100 women; 2p < 0.00001). Maternal mortality was non-significantly lower among women allocated magnesium sulphate. There were no significant differences in other measures of serious maternal morbidity, or in perinatal morbidity or mortality. Women allocated magnesium sulphate had a 67% lower risk of recurrent convulsions (95% CI 79% to 47% reduction) than those allocated phenytoin (22 [5.7%] vs 66 [17.1%] ie, 11.4 [SD 2.2] fewer women with recurrent convulsions per 100 women; 2p < 0.00001). Maternal mortality was nonsignificantly lower among women allocated magnesium sulphate. Women allocated magnesium sulphate were also less likely to be ventilated, to develop pneumonia, and to be admitted to intensive care facilities than those allocated phenytoin. The babies of women who had been allocated magnesium sulphate before delivery were significantly less likely to be intubated at the place of delivery, and to be admitted to a special care nursery, than the babies of mothers who had been allocated phenytoin. There is now compelling evidence in favour of magnesium sulphate, rather than diazepam or phenytoin, for the treatment of eclampsia.",

Compounds 2-22 are devoid of the proton donor group, which according to a BZR schematic model was one of the pharmacophoric descriptors for receptor-ligand interaction. The binding data show that 2-(2-fluorophenyl)-9-chloro-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c][1,3]benzoxazin-5 -one (12) and some other compounds display nanomolar BZR affinity, indicating that the hydrogen donor group is not essential for the anchoring of 6,6,5-tricyclic systems to the BZR but only affects the potency of a ligand.",

Electrochemical analysis was used to detect olanzapine due to its uniquely low oxidative potential. Ascorbic acid was added to prevent oxidation during extraction. The limit of quantitation for the assay was established at 0.25 ng/ml utilizing a 1-ml human plasma sample. The average inter-day accuracy was 96.6% with a average precision (% C.V.) of 3.22% over the concentration range of 0.25 to 100 ng/ml. This method was applied to human plasma samples from human clinical trials with olanzapine. The HPLC-ED method compared favorably with a negative chemical ionization GC-MS method previously utilized for analysis of olanzapine in human plasma.", 
    "69": "A simple high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the measurement of diazepam (DZP) and its major metabolites, N-desmethyldiazepam (DMDZP), temazepam (TZP) and oxazepam (OZP) in urine was developed. Preliminary studies of DZP metabolism were also undertaken in four healthy volunteers after administration of a single oral dose (4 mg) of DZP. The assay allowed the simultaneous determination of all analytes in 1 ml of urine and the detection limit was 2 ng/ml with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. None of 22 drugs and 17 metabolites, except for mianserin, maprotiline and imipramine N-oxide, interfered with the detection of DZP metabolites. Recoveries of the analytes and the internal standard (prazepam) were > 82%. Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation for all analytes were < 5.5 and 4.1%, respectively. The mean (+/- S.D.) cumulative urinary excretions of DMDZP, TZP and OZP over 96 h after a single oral administration of DZP were 3.9 +/- 0.4, 6.6 +/- 1.4 and 2.8 +/- 0.6% of the dose, respectively. The urinary excretion of DZP was under the detection limit.", 
    "70": "A method for the analysis of the AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate) receptor antagonist LY300164 (compound I) and its N-acetyl metabolite (compound II) in plasma was developed. The assay utilized solid-phase extraction on a C18 Bond Elut cartridge followed by reversed-phase HPLC with UV detection at 310 nm. The method exhibited a large linear range from 0.05 microgram/ml to 50 micrograms/ml with an intra-assay accuracy for compound I and compound II ranging from 89.0% to 114.5% and intra-assay precision ranging from 0.5 to 15.3% in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey plasma. The inter-assay accuracy of compound I and compound II was 93.3% to 101.8% and the inter-assay precision was 1.6% to 11.2% in dog plasma. The lower limit of quantitation was 0.05 microgram/ml for compound I in plasma from all species tested. The lower limit of quantitation for compound II was 0.05 microgram/ml in dog and monkey plasma and 0.1 microgram/ml in mouse and rat plasma. Extracts of compound I and II from dog plasma were shown to be stable for 24 h at room temperature, and both compounds were stable when spiked into rat and monkey plasma frozen at -70 degrees C for 27 days. The method has shown to be useful in the investigation of the pharmacokinetics of the parent compound (I) and metabolite (II) in preclinical studies.", 
    "71": "Sleep complaints are common in the elderly, and are often related to physiological changes with ageing, or secondary to illness and drug therapy. Primary sleep disorders, such as sleep apnoea and movement disorders, are also common. Management should be specific to the problem. Attention to underlying factors and sleep hygiene, as well as reassurance and education about age-related sleep changes, will often be sufficient. Hypnotics, which usually offer only temporary symptomatic relief, may be counterproductive, and should be prescribed only in the short term, except in limited specific cases. Short-acting benzodiazepines (e.g., temazepam or oxazepam), or possibly zopiclone, are currently the drugs of choice.", 
    "72": "The effects of the neurosteroid, pregnenolone sulfate (PS), on the responses of male mice to the odors of estrous female mice were examined in an odor preference test. Control untreated mice displayed a significant preference for the odors of an estrous female, spending more time in a Y-maze in the vicinity of the odors of an estrous than a non-estrous female. Administration of PS decreased male preference for the odors of estrous females, causing a significant dose-related (0.01-10 mg/kg) decrease in the amount of time spent in the proximity of the odors of the estrous female, while having significantly less of an effect on the responses to the non-estrous female odors. Neither pregnenolone nor sodium sulfate had any significant effects on the olfactory responses. The effects of PS were significantly reduced by peripheral administrations of the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, MK-801, but were not significantly affected by either the GABAA antagonists, bicuculline and picrotoxin, or the benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788. These results suggest that pregnenolone sulfate has inhibitory effects on olfactory mediated male sexual interest, preference, or 'motivation' that, in part, involve interactions with NMDA receptor mediated mechanisms.", 
    "73": "During the development of a micellar electrokinetic chromatographic screening method for 1,4-benzodiazepines, peak splitting and broadening were observed for some 3-hydroxy-1,4-benzodiazepines (oxazepam, lorazepam, temazepam and lormetazepam). This phenomenon occurred when the micellar phase consisted of bile salts and can be ascribed to the chiral nature of these surfactants. As the bile salts were applied in order to reduce the capacity factors to an appropriate level, enantiomer separation was not an objective and even disturbing. By increasing the analysis temperature, the chiral recognition of these compounds could be suppressed.", 
    "74": "Two baselines involving a repeated acquisition task were used to assess the effects of bretazenil, imidazenil, and triazolam. The first baseline was a multiple schedule of repeated acquisition and performance of conditional discriminations. In the first component, the subject acquired a four-response chain by responding sequentially on three keys in the presence of different combinations of colors and geometric forms displayed on a center key. Acquisition of the discrimination was defined by a decrease in errors as the session progressed. In the performance component, the four-response chain was the same each session. Incorrect responses in either component produced a 5s time out during which responding had no programmed consequence. The second procedure, which has been used to evaluate the effects of drugs on memory, involved the acquisition of a discrimination, followed by a 1h delay and a retest of the same discrimination to assess retention. Triazolam (0.32 and 0.56mg/kg) administered alone, produced dose-related decreases in response rate in each component. In addition, triazolam also produced a dose-related increase in percentage errors in acquisition with no effect in performance. Triazolam (0.32mg/kg) eliminated retention (0 percent savings) in the memory task. Bretazenil (0.1-5.6mg/kg) or imidazenil (0.1-1.8mg/kg) administered alone had little or no effect on either rate of responding or accuracy in either component. Furthermore, bretazenil but not imidazenil disrupted retention at the higher doses tested. The combination of imidazenil or bretazenil with triazolam produced dose-related attenuation of the disruptive effects of triazolam on both behavioral baselines. These data suggest that the disruptive effects of benzodiazepines on learning and memory may be a function of the intrinsic efficacy of these compounds at different GABA(A) receptor subtypes.", 
    "75": "Our investigation was carried out in subjects intoxicated with heroin or heroin mixtures to find out the time interval during which delayed life-threatening complications become manifest, such as pulmonary oedema or relapse into respiratory depression or coma after naloxone treatment. We studied prospectively all drug intoxications between 1991 and 1992. Of the 538 intoxications, we assessed in detail 160 outpatients who lived within the catchment area of our hospital. The outcome variables studied were (1) rehospitalization for pulmonary oedema, (2) relapse into coma, and/or (3) death and cause within 24 h after release from hospital. Deaths occurring outside our hospital have to be reported, as decreed by law, to the Institute for Forensic Medicine. The results of our investigation showed no rehospitalization owing to pulmonary oedema or coma, but one death, outside the hospital, owing to delayed pulmonary oedema. This delayed complication had an incidence of 0.6% (95% confidence interval 0-3.8%). A reintoxication could be excluded in this patient. Based on reliable report, the pulmonary oedema occurred between approximately 2 1/4 and 8 1/4 hours after intoxication. In the literature, only two cases of delayed pulmonary oedema have been reported with reliable time statements (4 and 6 h after hospitalization). We therefore conclude that surveillance for at least 8 h is essential after successful treatment to exclude delayed pulmonary oedema in patients intoxicated with heroin or heroin mixtures.", 
    "76": "DU 124884 is a racemic serotonin receptor agonist in an early stage of drug development. DU 124884 and its potential N-desmethyl metabolite, KC 9048, both contain a single chiral center. A direct enantioselective HPLC assay was developed and validated to quantify DU 124884 and KC 9048 in rat plasma. The drug and metabolite enantiomers were extracted from plasma and separated using silica stationary phase with an aqueous mobile phase containing beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), triethylamine, and 2-methyl-2-propanol. A variable wavelength detector was used to monitor absorbance at 231 nm. The assay calibration range was from 100 to 5000 ng/mL. Quality control sample precision (< or = 9% RSD) and accuracy (+/-10% error) were satisfactory for all four analytes (n = 12). The method was used to assess drug exposure during a pilot toxicology study in rats. Toxicokinetic study animals were dosed subcutaneously for 15 days at 0, 2.5, 10, and 40 mg of DU 124884.HCl kg-1 day-1. Blood was collected on the last day of dosing between 22 min and 4 h and 13 min after the last dose. The samples showed (+/-)-DU 124884 isomer ratios ranging from 1.1 to 1.3. These data suggest that DU 124884 undergoes stereoselective metabolism in rats. Levels of the N-desmethyl metabolite enantiomers were < 100 ng/mL.", 
    "77": "Previous mouse liver studies with diazepam (DZ), N-desmethyldiazepam (NZ), and temazepam (TZ) confirmed that under first-order conditions, DZ formed NZ and TZ in parallel. Oxazepam (OZ) was generated via NZ and not TZ despite that preformed NZ and TZ were both capable of forming OZ. In the present studies, the concentration-dependent sequential metabolism of DZ was studied in perfused mouse livers and microsomes, with the aim of distinguishing the relative importance of NZ and TZ as precursors of OZ. In microsomal studies, the Kms and Vmaxs, corrected for binding to microsomal proteins, were 34 microM and 3.6 nmole/min per mg and 239 microM and 18 nmole/min per mg, respectively, for N-demethylation and C3-hydroxylation of DZ. The Kms and Vmaxs for N-demethylation and C3-hydroxylation of TZ and NZ, respectively, to form OZ, were 58 microM and 2.5 nmole/min per mg and 311 microM and 2 nmole/min per mg, respectively. The constants suggest that at low DZ concentrations, NZ formation predominates and is a major source of OZ, whereas at higher DZ concentrations, TZ is the important source of OZ. In livers perfused with DZ at input concentrations of 13 to 35 microM, the extraction ratio of DZ (E[DZ]) decreased from 0.83 to 0.60. NZ was the major metabolite formed although its appearance was less than proportionate with increasing DZ input concentration. By contrast, the formation of TZ increased disproportionately with increasing DZ concentration, whereas that for OZ decreased and paralleled the behavior of NZ. Computer simulations based on a tubular flow model and the in vitro enzymatic parameters provided a poor in vitro-organ correlation. The E[DZ], appearance rates of the metabolites, and the extraction ratio of formed NZ (E[NZ, DZ]) were poorly predicted; TZ was incorrectly identified as the major precursor of OZ. Simulations with optimized parameters improved the correlations and identified NZ as the major contributor of OZ. Saturation of DZ N-demethylation at higher DZ concentrations increased the role of TZ in the formation of OZ. The poor aqueous solubility (limiting the concentration range of substrates used in vitro), avid tissue binding and the coupling of enzymatic reactions in liver, favoring sequential metabolism, are possible explanations for the poor in vitro-organ correlation. This work emphasizes the complexity of the hepatic intracellular milieu for drug metabolism and the need for additional modeling efforts to adequately describe metabolite kinetics.", 
    "78": "According to the record of the Poison Control Centre in Zagreb, drugs most frequently implicated in poisoning episodes were benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, anticonvulsants including barbiturates, fluorides and antidepressants, which comprised more than 40% of all drug poisonings. More than 90% of neuroleptic poisonings were symptomatic on admission, 19% were comatose, 45% were drowsy, in 15% extrapyramidal symptoms were present, and only 9% were without symptoms. Severe poisonings in adults were almost all due to suicidal ingestion, while in children low to moderate doses of different neuroleptics caused severe poisoning in 13 cases, with coma, convulsions and most often with acute dystonic reactions. In 30 cases of neuroleptic ingestion more than one drug was involved. The usual combinations were with other neuroleptic or psychoactive drugs such as benzodiazepines, biperiden, carbamazepin and antidepressants. Therapeutic measures were gastric emptying in 32% of cases, biperiden when dystonia was present but only after consultation with the Centre and with 12-14 hours delay, and supportive treatment in all symptomatic patients.", 
    "79": "Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. It is currently used mainly in the anaesthetic and emergency rooms to reverse the effect of exogenous benzodiazepines. Its use in a variety of experimental animal models and in human neuropsychiatric disorders continues to generate a wealth of information on the possible role of the benzodiazepine-GABA(A) receptor complex in their pathogenesis. In addition, labelled with carbon-11, flumazenil has proved to be one of the most successful positron emission tomography ligands stimulating research on the role of the benzodiazepine receptor in these disorders. This review focuses on the current state of play of flumazenil as a therapeutic or investigative agent in neuropsychiatry, citing also the relevant animal models.", 
    "80": "In 1945, Lennox was the first to describe the epileptic states mainly expressed by various degrees of consciousness disturbance, which have their onset in children who present epileptic absences correlated with ictal EEG patterns of spike-wave complex discharges at about 3 Hz. As the clinical picture seemed to be similar to an uninterrupted series of absences, this led to the definition \"Petit Mal Status\" (PMS). Many authors have subsequently reported that PMS can occur in epileptic subjects who have never presented absences (and even in subjects without a previous history of epilepsy) and that the related EEG pictures were characterised by paroxysmal generalized activity of various morphology, but hardly ever consisted of the continuous rhythmic spike-wave or polyspike-wave complexes at 3 Hz found in petit mal absences. Finally, in reporting the onset and recurrence of this condition typically in adults and the elderly, some authors have proposed the existence of a particular form of PMS (dependent on different types of pathologic factors and characterising a specific syndrome of this age) that is different from that of the \"real PMS\" typical of childhood and related to petit mal absences. This paper describes fifteen patients in whom the onset of the condition occurred at different ages, and who seem to exemplify the various possible clinical expressions of PMS, with the aim of making a contribution towards the better nosographic definition of this epileptic condition. On the basis of our study, we sustain that the so-called PMS is a seizure type of Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy which may appear at nearly all ages, and may occur in isolation or in association with other epileptic manifestations, but cannot itself be considered as characterising one or more age-dependent syndromes.", 
    "81": "The present work studies the effect of previous hydrocortisone administration (10 mg/kg/day) over 7 days on the later development of diet-induced acute pancreatitis in the rat. Acute pancreatitis was induced by feeding a diet deficient in choline and supplemented with 0.5% ethionine (CDE diet) over 10 days. Hydrocortisone pretreatment exacerbated CDE-induced acute pancreatitis. There was a significant increase in serum amylase, pancreatic edema, and haematocrit levels and an insignificant decrease in pancreatic mass in rats pretreated with hydrocortisone. Pancreatic enzyme secretion was strongly reduced in the rats subjected to acute pancreatitis, and although the drop in enzyme levels did not reach statistical significance, the values of secretion were even further reduced in the animals treated with hydrocortisone, pointing to the absence of pancreatic functionality. This effect can be attributed to enzyme storage elicited by previous hydrocortisone administration; activated intracellularly, these enzymes could aggravate the pathology. Administration of the cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) (10 micrograms/kg/day) during the development of acute pancreatitis in animals pretreated with hydrocortisone substantially improved the general state of the animals' pancreases. There was a significant decrease in serum amylase, pancreatic edema and haematocrit levels in rats injected with CCK, which was accompanied by an increase in pancreatic functionality. Conversely, the administration of L-364,718 (0.1 mg/kg/day), a CCK antagonist, did not improve pancreatic functionality and did not appreciably affect the general state of the organ. It is concluded that in rats with storage levels increased by hydrocortisone administration that are subjected to acute pancreatitis, the secretagogue effect of CCK is more beneficial than the repose of the gland induced by L-364,718.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "82": "This study was performed in rats to determine if serotonin and its receptors are involved in the increase of gastric emptying (GE) induced by benzodiazepine (BZ) withdrawal. GE was measured with a test meal (2 ml) containing 1 microCi/ml of 51Cr sodium chromate administered in rats, either previously receiving injections with diazepam (15 mg/kg/day i.p.) or with DMSO (0.9 ml/day i.p.) during 7 days. On the 8th day, animals received the different serotonin (5-HT) agonists or antagonists, and flumazenil (BZ antagonist; 15 mg/kg i.p.) 30 and 15 min, respectively, before the test meal. Methiotepin (5-HT1 antagonist) either i.p. (0.1-1 mg/kg) or intracerebroventricularly (10 micrograms/kg) had no effect on the increase of GE induced by precipitated-withdrawal. 8-OH-DPAT (5-HT1A agonist) administered i.c.v. (1-10 micrograms/kg) dose dependently reduced GE increase. Administered i.p. (0.1 mg/kg), it blocked GE increase in control and diazepam-withdrawn rats. Ritanserin (5-HT2 antagonist) antagonized GE increase only when administered i.p. (0.1 mg/kg). Granisetron (5-HT3 antagonist) was active both i.p. (0.01-0.1 mg/kg) and intracerebroventricularly (1-10 micrograms/kg). Administered intracerebroventricularly (1 microgram/kg) in diazepam-treated rats, 5-HTP mimicked the effect of flumazenil. It is concluded that diazepam-withdrawal increases GE by stimulating central release of 5-HT and/or central activation of 5-HT neurons. At least central 5-HT3 receptors, and in less extend, peripheral 5-HT2 receptors are involved in this mechanism.", 
    "83": "Although the molecular mechanisms underlying behavioral responses observed in ethanol (EtOH)-dependent and -withdrawn animals are poorly understood, several lines of evidence have suggested that some of the pharmacological actions of EtOH are mediated via the potentiation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic transmission. In the present study, the effects of acute and chronic EtOH treatment on the expression of diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) mRNA in the mouse brain and the functional involvement of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor in EtOH-induced alteration of the DBI mRNA expression were examined. The expression of cerebral DBI mRNA significantly increased in EtOH-treated (130% of control) and EtOH-withdrawn (220% of control) mice in comparison with untreated mice, whereas the DBI mRNA level was not altered after a single administration of EtOH (3 g/kg i.p.). The increase in the DBI mRNA expression in the mouse cerebral cortex after EtOH withdrawal diminished over 14 days despite the disappearance of withdrawal signs within 2 days after the withdrawal of EtOH. Simultaneous administration of flunitrazepam (10 mg/kg i.p.) with EtOH completely abolished the EtOH-induced increase in DBI mRNA expression. On the other hand, the level of beta-actin mRNA was not affected by similar EtOH treatment. These results indicate that changes in the expression of cerebral DBI mRNA induced by long-term EtOH treatment may be involved in the establishment of alcohol dependence, and such changes may be also regulated by BDZ receptors.", 
    "84": "Imidazenil is a highly potent partial allosteric modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid action at a great variety of gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors, whereas alprazolam is a full allosteric modulator at these receptors. Data in rats indicate that imidazenil, like alprazolam, has pharmacological effects in animals indicative of anxiolytic, antipanic and anticonvulsant activity in humans, but unlike alprazolam, in animals imidazenil does not produce ataxia, sedation, tolerance or dependence nor does it potentiate the effects of ethanol. To extend the study of the imidazenil pharmacological profile, we administered this drug and alprazolam, alone and in combination, in monkeys working in a complex behavioral task. In one component of a multiple schedule (repeated acquisition or \"learning\"), patas monkeys acquired a different four-response chain each session by responding sequentially on three keys in the presence of four discriminative stimuli (geometric forms or numerals). In the other component (performance), the four-response chain was the same each session. The response chain in each component was maintained by food presentation under a fixed-ratio schedule. When alprazolam (0.01-0.32 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered alone, the overall response rate in both learning and performance decreased and the percent errors in both components increased with increasing doses. Learning, however, was more sensitive than performance; i.e., error-increasing effects were seen in learning at doses that had no effect on performance accuracy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "85": "This investigation was designed to determine whether the narcotic alfentanil, a relatively new fentanyl derivative with rapid onset of action and offset of activity, alone or in combination with midazolam has advantages over the traditional meperidine and midazolam regimen for conscious sedation. Thirty-five subjects were randomized to receive an initial dose of narcotic and sedative with additional narcotics or sedatives administered as needed. Subjects receiving no midazolam sedative (alfentanil and placebo group, n = 13) had less desaturation and had the need for supplemental oxygen less often than those receiving alfentanil and midazolam (n = 11) or meperidine and midazolam (n = 11). There were no differences as assessed by patient and colonoscopist for tolerance and discomfort, procedure ease, recovery time, complications, electrocardiogram, and blood pressure. Baseline evaluation did not predict the need for supplemental oxygen. We concluded that alfentanil, with or without a sedative, has no advantage over the commonly used meperidine and midazolam regimen.", 
    "86": "Acetaminophen and low doses of diazepam were evaluated for the prevention of recurrences of febrile seizures in a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Children after their first febrile seizure were assigned to receive either one dose of rectally administered diazepam, and then, after 6 hours, oral doses of 0.2 mg/kg three times a day for the first 2 days if the fever stayed greater than 38.5 degrees C, or a placebo similarly during forthcoming febrile episodes. In addition, each febrile episode was randomly assigned to be treated with acetaminophen or the placebo. Thus four groups were examined for 2 years: patients receiving two kinds of placebo, patients receiving diazepam and a placebo, patients receiving acetaminophen and a placebo, and patients receiving both diazepam and acetaminophen. Of a total of 180 patients (102 boys), 161 were followed for the 2-year period and 157 were seen at the last outpatient examination: 80 in the diazepam group and 77 in the placebo group. The final analysis of the efficacy of the drugs was made on the basis of the data from 153 patients who had had at least one febrile episode during follow-up. There were 641 fever events during this period, and 38 children (21.1%) had 55 recurrences of febrile seizures. Acetaminophen had no effect on the recurrence rate. Seizures recurred at least once in 21 patients (28.4%) receiving diazepam and 17 (21.5%) receiving a placebo (p = 0.4138, log-rank test). The combination of antipyretic agents with anticonvulsant medication did not reduce the recurrence of febrile seizures. Our results show that low doses of acetaminophen or diazepam or both are ineffective for preventing febrile seizures.", 
    "87": "Significant surgical advances in face-lift surgery have evolved over the years, including wider flap undermining, the development of the superficial musculoaponeurotic system as a separate layer, and appropriate platysmal and coronal procedures. These more radical concepts offer improved results, but they may be associated with more complications, the most frequent being hematoma formation. A retrospective study of 386 patients was undertaken over a period of 5 years. Patients were separated into two groups: those that were sedated with a drug combination of diazepam, meperidine hydrochloride, and methohexital sodium; and those sedated with propofol. Patients sedated with propofol were more than twice as likely to develop a hematoma than those sedated with the other drug regimen. Although the hematoma rate with propofol is similar to that reported with other drugs, this increased risk must be carefully considered when one is choosing an anesthetic for rhytidectomy.", 
    "88": "In samples from patients treated with oxazepam, beta-glucuronidase increased the immunoreactivity of urinary benzodiazepines analyzed by fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA). Increasing concentrations of beta-glucuronidase added to samples from drug-free controls did not influence the results. In the absence of beta-glucuronidase, 22 of 35 samples from patients undergoing detoxification gave positive results at a cutoff concentration of 200 micrograms/L. Pretreatment with beta-glucuronidase increased the number of drug-positive samples to 33. The drug-negative samples were obtained from two patients who had been oxazepam-free for at least 1 week. Thus, beta-glucuronidase can be used to increase the sensitivity of the urinary benzodiazepine FPIA without reducing the specificity of the method.", 
    "89": "Postoperative delirium is common in the elderly in the postoperative period. It can result in increased morbidity, delayed functional recovery, and prolonged hospital stay. In surgical patients, factors such as age, alcohol abuse, low baseline cognition, severe metabolic derangement, hypoxia, hypotension, and type of surgery appear to contribute to postoperative delirium. Anesthetics, notably anticholinergic drugs and benzodiazepines, increase the risk for delirium. Despite the above recommendations, postoperative delirium in the elderly is poorly understood. Clearly, further studies are needed to determine the risk and long-term outcome of delirium in the elderly population. Research is also needed to define the effects of hypoxemia on cerebral function and whether oxygen therapy has any benefits. The geriatric-anesthesiologic intervention program of pre- and postoperative geriatric assessment, early surgery, thrombosis prophylaxis, oxygen therapy, prevention and treatment of perioperative decrease in blood pressure, and vigorous treatment of any postoperative complications showed some promise, but further definitive studies are needed.", 
    "90": "Spinal neostigmine produces analgesia in chronically prepared rats, but not in sheep. However, since pain itself activates bulbospinal inhibitory pathways, neostigmine may be more effective in the postoperative period. We examined in sheep the antinociceptive effect of intrathecal neostigmine in the acute postoperative period and determined the muscarinic receptor subtype activated by neostigmine. A cervical intrathecal catheter was inserted via a laminotomy in 14 sheep that then received, in random order 1 mg of spinal neostigmine or saline on postoperative Day 1 and the other injection on postoperative Day 2. Three additional sheep received, on separate days, intrathecal neostigmine alone or with the muscarinic receptor subtype-specific antagonists pirenzepine (M1) 2 mg or AFDX-116 (M2) 2 mg. Antinociception was tested using a mechanical stimulus after each injection. Baseline withdrawal threshold did not change postoperatively. Intrathecal neostigmine, but not saline caused antinociception on both of the first two postoperative days. In contrast, intrathecal neostigmine caused no antinociception in another similar study performed at least 5 days after surgery. Pirenzepine, but not AFDX-116, abolished antinociception from neostigmine, suggesting an action on M1 subtype muscarinic receptors. Intrathecal neostigmine is antinociceptive in sheep during the acute postoperative period, and these data suggest that spinal cholinergic tone, and hence intrathecal neostigmine's analgesic effect, may be enhanced during the acute postoperative period.", 
    "91": "Impairment caused by different sedative/analgesic combinations commonly used in ambulatory settings was compared to that of alcohol at blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) higher than or equal to 0.10%. Impairment was measured via subjective (mood) and objective (psychomotor performance) assays. Twelve healthy human volunteers (10 males and 2 females; age range 21-34 yr) participated in this prospective, double-blind, randomized, cross-over study. Each subject was exposed to five drug conditions across 5 wk. Each of the following drug conditions were adjusted for body weight (per 70 kg):fentanyl 50 micrograms and propofol 35 mg (FP), fentanyl 50 micrograms and midazolam 2 mg (FM), fentanyl 50 micrograms, midazolam 2 mg, and propofol 35 mg (FMP), alcohol 56 g (orally administered), and placebo (PLC). With the exception of alcohol, the other drugs were administered via the intravenous route. Tests for psychomotor performance, subjective effects, and short-term memory were done at baseline, and at different intervals until 240 min postinjection. Psychomotor impairment caused by alcohol at 15 min postingestion (at a BAC of 0.11% +/- 0.03% [mean +/- SE]) was used as a benchmark with which impairment caused by other sedative/analgesic combinations was compared. All the study drug combinations produced impairment (i.e., impairment greater than that seen with PLC), similar to that observed with alcohol at a BAC of 0.11%. We have demonstrated that some sedative/analgesic drug combinations used in anesthesia for ambulatory procedures produce impairment similar to or greater than that observed with a large dose of alcohol.",

    "96": "The effects of a single dose of scopolamine (0.5 mg) SC and of lorazepam (2.5 mg) PO were tested in two independent studies for their effects on performance in a psychometric battery which measured functions related to different stages of information processing. Attention and vigilance were measured by a continuous attention task and a vigilance task, respectively. Working memory and reasoning were evaluated by the rapid information processing and logical reasoning task; memory acquisition and storage were measured by pre- and post-drug immediate and delayed recall using visual material. The following pattern of effects was revealed; both scopolamine and lorazepam impaired performance in attentional and vigilance tasks as well as in the rapid information processing task significantly (P < 0.05) when compared with their own placebo; in the logical reasoning task lorazepam significantly prolonged the time required to solve a problem; scopolamine did not have any effect on this task. Scopolamine impaired performance in the immediate recall but left delayed recall unaffected; lorazepam impaired only delayed recall, immediate recall remaining unaffected. These data suggest that scopolamine at this dose impaired mostly attention and early stages of information processes; lorazepam at the dose tested impaired also the later acquisition and encoding aspects of memory."
