    "0": "Clorazepate dipotassium and diazepam were administered daily for the first 5 days of each week to Rhesus monkeys at equimolar doses and challanged once a week with a convulsant dose of pentylenetetrazol. Clorazepate exhibited sustained anticonvulsant activity throughout the second, third, and fourth weeks while diazepam was effective only during the second and third weeks.", 
    "1": "Basal, as well as betazole-stimulated gastric acid secretion in man is reduced after the intravenous administration of bromazepam. In subjects staying awake, this reduction is limited to the first two 15-minute periods. The reduction is highly significant in subjects who fall asleep after receiving the drug. Natural sleep causes the same depression. The low level of acid secretion is maintained until the subjects are awakened when there is a sharp and highly significant rise. Acid secretion in subjects who fall asleep after the simultaneous administration of betazole and bromazepam is significantly higher than after the administration of bromazepam alone. Sleep causes a much greater depression of basal and betazole-stimulated acid secretion than does the benzodiazepine itself. Acid secretion was measured by continuous intragastric titration and a pH-sensitive endoradiosonde.", 
    "2": "In a patient with reflex myoclonus limited to the right side of the body, stimulation of the right median nerve in the index finger or wrist elicited a very large somatosensory evoked response (SER) and a long loop C reflex which represents an electrically evoked myoclonic response. It is suggested that the pathway for the C reflex is through peripheral nerve, dorsal funiculus of spinal cord, contralateral VP nucleus of thalamus, sensorimotor cortex, corticospinal tract, and anterior horn cell. The large SER, C reflex, and myoclonic jerks are presumed to result from a release effect causing increased excitability at central synapses along this pathway. The patient presented has a large atrophic vascular lesion involving the left frontotemporoparietal region and involvement of pathways through the right superior cerebellar peduncle to account for the neural dysfunction.", 
    "3": "A total of 17 butyrophenone, phenothiazine, benzodiazepine and imidazoline tranquillizing drugs were examined for their ability to increase the cerebral concentration of the sulphate ester of 1(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)ethane-1,2-diol (MHPG-SO(3) H), a metabolite of noradrenaline in the rat brain. Of these drugs, when given in a dose of 10 mg/kg i.p., only trifluperidol, haloanisone, azaperone, clozapine and haloperidol were found to increase the cerebral concentration of MHPG-SO(3) H. This effect is unrelated to the ability of such drugs to antagonize the lethal effects of an intravenous injection of noradrenaline and suggests that the properties of the central noradrenaline receptors differ from those of the peripheral noradrenaline receptors.", 
    "4": "A double-blind crossover study was carried out in 68 demented elderly patients (mean age 77 years) to compare the hypnotic effects of chlormethiazole and nitrazepam. Chlormethiazole was administered as a 5% mixture (500 mg. chlormethiazole edisylate) in a 10 ml. dose: the corresponding single dose of nitrazepam was 10 mg. Treatment was discontinued in 6 patients and interrupted for from 1 to 3 days in a further 18 due to side-effects and 'hang-over' problems or because of intercurrent infections. Of these 24 drop-outs, 3 occurred during chlormethiazole treatment (1 severe 'hang-over'; 2 refused to take medication) and 21 during nitrazepam (15 severe 'hang-over' effects, including sleepiness and muscular weakness; 2 nausea; 4 intercurrent infection). Both preparations were equally effective as hypnotics, there being no noteworthy differences in time of onset or in duration of sleep. Of the 44 patients completing the trial without interuption, observations were carried out for 308 nights on each preparation. Chlormethiazole patients slept for more than 6 hours on 244 of the 308 nights without 'hang-over' effect the next day compared with 163 out of 308 nights of those on nitrazepam. The difference is statistically significant in favour of chlormethiazole. The high incidence of 'hang-over' effect during nitrazepam treatment indicates that a single 10 mg. dose is too large for use in the elderly. Overall assessment of treatment was made in 62 patients. Chlormethiazole was judged to be the most suitable drug in 37, nitrazepam in 11, and both preparations equally useful in the remaining 14 patients. This difference is statistically significant."
