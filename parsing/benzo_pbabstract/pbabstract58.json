Ketamine has been implicated in several case reports as a successful agent for treating RSE given that it blocks the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, which is overexpressed in prolonged status epilepticus.", 
    "1": "We describe a previously healthy 27-year-old woman who presented with prolonged RSE requiring the initiation of multiple AEDs, including high-dose propofol and midazolam continuous infusions. As a result of hypotension from propofol and inadequate seizure control with midazolam, the patient was successfully transitioned to a pentobarbital infusion in combination with multiple AEDs. Although the patient achieved control of her RSE, her course was complicated by the development of an anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) with transaminitis. Limited with the options of AED that could have been used, it was decided to initiate the patient on a continuous ketamine infusion plus midazolam and slowly wean the patient off pentobarbital as well as to avoid further use of phenytoin and phenobarbital.", 
    "2": "The patient was successfully transitioned off pentobarbital to a ketamine infusion plus midazolam with complete seizure control after several dose escalations. Her AHS and transaminitis resolved on a ketamine infusion for a total of 12 days, and she was successfully discharged from the hospital after 60 days in the ICU.",

    "5": "A 36-year-old female trauma patient hospitalized at The Regional Medical Center at Memphis developed bacteremia due to Rhizobium radiobacter on hospital day 9. The central line catheter tip culture from the same hospital day was negative. No source for the R radiobacter bacteremia was identified. Empirical and definitive antibiotic therapy consisted of cefepime 2 g intravenously every 8 hours for at total of 8 days. On completion of antibiotics, the patient demonstrated clinical resolution by immediate defervescence and gradual normalization of her white blood cell count. She demonstrated microbiologic success of therapy with negative blood cultures on hospital days 22, 34, 45, and 61. She was discharged on hospital day 80.", 
    "6": "Rhizobium species are common soil and plant pathogens that rarely cause infections in humans. Previous reports of Rhizobium infections have been in immunocompromised patients; generally those with cancer or HIV infection. Intravenous catheters have commonly been cited as the source of infection. The trauma patient in this case constitutes a unique presentation of R radiobacter bacteremia when compared with other case reports. Her indwelling catheter was not the source of her infection, and her only identifiable risk factor for R radiobacter infection was hospitalization. However, she did possess potential reasons for development of an infection with an unusual organism such as R radiobacter. Potential immune modulating therapies included blood transfusions, opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, general anesthetics, and surgical procedures. Finally, trauma itself has been associated with some degree of immunosuppression. All these issues may have placed the patient in this case at risk of an opportunistic infection like R radiobacter.",

    "8": "The appearance of pyrazolam in Internet shops selling 'research chemicals' in 2012 marked the beginning of designer benzodiazepines being sold as recreational drugs or 'self medication'. With recent changes in national narcotics laws in many countries, where two uncontrolled benzodiazepines (phenazepam and etizolam), which were marketed by pharmaceutical companies in some countries, were scheduled, clandestine laboratories seem to turn to poorly characterized research drug candidates as legal substitutes. Following the appearance of pyrazolam, it comes with no surprise that recently, flubromazepam (7-bromo-5-(2-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one), a second designer benzodiazepine, was offered on the market. In this article, this new compound was characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight MS (LC-Q-ToF-MS). Additionally, a study was carried out, in which one of the authors consumed 4 mg of flubromazepam to gain preliminary data on the pharmacokinetic properties and the metabolism of this compound. For this purpose, serum as well as urine samples were collected for up to 31 days post-ingestion and analyzed applying LC-MS/MS and LC-Q-ToF-MS techniques. On the basis of this study, flubromazepam appears to have an extremely long elimination half-life of more than 100 h. One monohydroxylated compound and the debrominated compound could be identified as the predominant metabolites, the first allowing a detection of a consumption for up to 28 days post-ingestion when analyzing urine samples in our case. Additionally, various immunochemical assays were evaluated, showing that the cross-reactivity of the used assay seems not to be sufficient for safe detection of the applied dose in urine samples, bearing the risk that it could be misused in drug-withdrawal settings or in other circumstances requiring regular drug testing. Furthermore, it may be used in drug-facilitated crimes without being detected.", 
    "9": "One-third of pregnant asthmatics experience a worsening of their asthma that may progress to a critical asthma syndrome (CAS) that includes status asthmaticus (SA) and near-fatal asthma (NFA). Patients with severe asthma before pregnancy may experience more exacerbations, especially during late pregnancy. Prevention of the CAS includes excellent asthma control involving targeted early and regular medical care of the pregnant asthmatic, together with medication compliance. Spontaneous abortion risk is higher in pregnant women with uncontrolled asthma than in non-asthmatics. Should CAS occur during pregnancy, aggressive bronchodilator therapy, montelukast, and systemic corticosteroids can be used in the context of respiratory monitoring, preferably in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Systemic epinephrine should be avoided due to potential teratogenic side-effects and placental/uterine vasoconstriction. Non-invasive ventilation has been used in some cases. Intratracheal intubation can be hazardous and rapid-sequence intubation by an experienced physician is recommended. Mechanical ventilation parameters are adjusted based on changes to respiratory mechanics in the pregnant patient. An inhaled helium-oxygen gas admixture may promote laminar airflow and improve gas exchange. Permissive hypercapnea is controversial, but may be unavoidable. Sedation with propofol which itself has bronchodilating properties is preferred to benzodiazepines. Case reports delineating good outcomes for both mother and fetus despite intubation for SA suggest that multidisciplinary ICU care of the pregnant asthmatic with critical asthma are feasible especially if hypoxemia is avoided.", 
    "10": "This study examined how repeated olanzapine (OLZ) or clozapine (CLZ) treatment in adolescence alters sensitivity to the same drug in adulthood in the phencyclidine (PCP) hyperlocomotion model. Male adolescent Sprague-Dawley rats (postnatal day (P) 44-48) were first treated with OLZ (1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously (sc)) or CLZ (10.0 or 20.0 mg/kg, sc) and tested in the PCP (3.2 mg/kg, sc)-induced hyperlocomotion model for five consecutive days. Then a challenge test with OLZ (0.5 mg/kg) or CLZ (5.0 mg/kg) was administered either during adolescence (~P 51) or after the rats matured into adults (~P 76 and 91). During adolescence, repeated OLZ or CLZ treatment produced a persistent inhibition of PCP-induced hyperlocomotion across the five test days. In the challenge test during adolescence, rats previously treated with OLZ did not show a significantly stronger inhibition of PCP-induced hyperlocomotion than those previously treated with vehicle (VEH). In contrast, those previously treated with CLZ showed a weaker inhibition than the VEH controls. When assessed in adulthood, the enhanced sensitivity to OLZ and the decreased sensitivity to CLZ were detected on ~P 76, even on ~P 91 in the case of OLZ. These findings suggest that adolescent OLZ or CLZ exposure can induce long-term alterations in antipsychotic response that persist into adulthood.", 
    "11": "Distraction technology suitable for the perioperative setting is readily available, but there is little evidence to show how it compares with oral midazolam in managing anxiety. Video glasses, which enable children to view and listen to cartoons and movies, may be used through the completion of inhaled induction. We compared the efficacy of oral midazolam and behavioral distraction with video glasses in managing preoperative anxiety in children.", 
    "12": "In this prospective, randomized study, 96 children aged 4 to 9 years undergoing outpatient surgery were recruited to one of 3 intervention groups receiving midazolam, video glasses, or both. The Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale was the primary dependent measure used to assess anxiety at baseline before intervention, 20 minutes later at transport to the operating room (OR), and during mask induction.", 
    "13": "There was no significant increase in anxiety score within any group between baseline and OR transport (P = 0.21, 0.42, and 0.57 for midazolam, video glasses, and combined groups, respectively). An increase in anxiety, though not large enough to be clinically significant, was observed from baseline to induction in the midazolam and combined groups (P = 0.02 and 0.03) but not in the video glasses group (P = 0.38). Confidence intervals for pairwise comparisons in Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale changes among groups were all within a clinically significant difference of 15 units.", 
    "14": "The use of video glasses and midazolam alone or in combination maintains baseline levels of anxiety at time of transport to the OR and prevents significantly increased anxiety during induction of anesthesia in children. Video glasses are not inferior to midazolam for preoperative anxiolysis and provide a safe, noninvasive, nonpharmacologic, and pleasant alternative.", 
    "15": "Historically, the gold standard for detecting medical errors has been the voluntary incident reporting system. Voluntary reporting rates significantly underestimate the number of actual adverse events in any given organization. The electronic health record (EHR) contains clinical and administrative data that may indicate the occurrence of an adverse event and can be used to detect adverse events that may otherwise remain unrecognized. Automated adverse event detection has been shown to be efficient and cost effective in the hospital setting. The Automated Adverse Event Detection Collaborative (AAEDC) is a group of academic pediatric organizations working to identify optimal electronic methods of adverse event detection. The Collaborative seeks to aggregate and analyze data around adverse events as well as identify and share specific intervention strategies to reduce the rate of such events, ultimately to deliver higher quality and safer care. The objective of this study is to describe the process of automated adverse event detection, report early results from the Collaborative, identify commonalities and notable differences between 2 organizations, and suggest future directions for the Collaborative.", 
    "16": "In this retrospective observational study, the implementation and use of an automated adverse event detection system was compared between 2 academic children's hospital participants in the AAEDC, Children's National Medical Center, and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Both organizations use the EHR to identify potential adverse events as designated by specific electronic data triggers. After gathering the electronic data, a clinical investigator at each hospital manually examined the patient record to determine whether an adverse event had occurred, whether the event was preventable, and the level of harm involved.", 
    "17": "The Automated Adverse Event Detection Collaborative data from the 2 organizations between July 2006 and October 2010 were analyzed. Adverse event triggers associated with opioid and benzodiazepine toxicity and intravenous infiltration had the greatest positive predictive value (range, 47%- 96%). Triggers associated with hypoglycemia, coagulation disturbances, and renal dysfunction also had good positive predictive values (range, 22%-74%). In combination, the 2 organizations detected 3,264 adverse events, and 1,870 (57.3%) of these were preventable. Of these 3,264 events, clinicians submitted only 492 voluntary incident reports (15.1%).", 
    "18": "This work demonstrates the value of EHR-derived data aggregation and analysis in the detection and understanding of adverse events. Comparison and selection of optimal electronic trigger methods and recognition of adverse event trends within and between organizations are beneficial. Automated detection of adverse events likely contributes to the discovery of opportunities, expeditious implementation of process redesign, and quality improvement.", 
    "19": "In an attempt to synthesize a 2-substituted benzimidazole from the reaction of o-phenylenediamine and isophthalic acid in the presence of acetone and ethanol under microwave irradiation, a salt of the isophthalate ion and 2,2,4-trimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-1,5-benzodiazepin-5-ium ion was obtained. The condensation of two moles of acetone with the amine groups resulted in the formation of the benzodiazepine which crystallized as an iminium cation forming a salt with the isophthalate anion. The formation of benzodiazepine was also confirmed by performing the reaction of o-phenylenediamine with excess acetone in ethanol under conventional heating conditions. The compounds were characterized by NMR, FTIR, HRMS and microanalysis as well as X-ray crystallography. The reaction mechanism leading to the formation of benzodiazepine is also discussed.",

    "21": "A 49-year-old Greek man developed bilateral irreversible blindness after accidental methanol intoxication. He underwent complete ophthalmological examination, including electroretinogram, visual evoked potentials, multifocal-visual evoked potentials, and optical coherence tomography scan of the optic nerve. Complete laboratory evaluation, urine drug testing, neurological examination, and computed tomography scans were also performed. Visual acuity demonstrated no light perception bilaterally, pupils were semi-dilated and unreactive to light, while the retina was normal in both eyes. Electroretinogram was normal, while visual evoked potentials, multifocal-visual evoked potentials recording, and optical coherence tomography scanning of both optic nerve heads were pathological in both eyes. The neurological examination and the computed tomography scans did not reveal any abnormalities. The laboratory evaluation was normal and the urine drug test was negative for benzodiazepines, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, salicylates, barbiturates, and phencyclidine.", 
    "22": "This is the first case report of methanol intoxication which documents both anatomical and functional abnormalities by means of optical coherence tomography and electrophysiological tests correspondingly.

    "25": "Although our study was not designed to assess whether recreational oxycodone use is causally linked to transitions to intravenous use, polyopioid use places individuals at high risk for progression to heroin and injecting. Our first case, Jake, used a range of analgesics before he transitioned to intravenous use, and the first drug he injected was methadone. Our second case, Emma, engaged in a broad spectrum of polydrug use, involving a range of opioid preparations, as well as benzodiazepines, cannabis and alcohol. Both cases transitioned from oral to intravenous pharmaceutical opioids use and subsequent intravenous heroin use.", 
    "26": "These cases represent the first documented reports of transitions from the non-medical or recreational use of oxycodone to intravenous heroin use in Australia. As such, they represent an important starting point for the examination of pharmaceutical opioids as a pathway to injecting drug use among young Australians and highlight the need for further research designed to identify pharmaceutical opioids users at risk of transitions to injecting and to develop interventions designed to prevent or delay these transitions.", 
    "27": "Here we examined effects of acute stressors that involve either systemic coadministration of corticosterone/yohimbine (3 mg/kg each) to increase glucocorticoid/noradrenaline activity (denoted as \"pharmacological\" stressor) or one or several distinct restraint stressors (denoted as \"single\" vs. \"multiple\" stressor) on performance of goal-directed actions. Rats were trained over 11 d to perform two instrumental actions, one for food pellets the other for sucrose solution, followed by two consecutive tests days. On each test day, rats were first sated in a counterbalanced manner on one of the two outcomes by prefeeding (selective outcome devaluation), then subjected to an acute stressor, and tested afterward in a two-lever choice task in extinction to assess whether instrumental performance is goal-directed, i.e., sensitive to changes in outcome value. Like in control rats, in rats subjected to the pharmacological or single restraint stressor prior to the choice test, performance of instrumental action was goal-directed, i.e., sensitive to outcome devaluation. By contrast, in rats exposed to the multiple stressor prior to the choice test, performance of instrumental action was habitual, i.e., insensitive to outcome devaluation. Pretreatment with diazepam (1 and 2 mg/kg) did not alleviate (or only marginally) this multiple stressor-induced effect. Thus, an intense acute stressor can render performance of previously acquired instrumental action habitual, possibly due to a compromised retrieval of encoded relationships between actions and their outcome value. Our observation in rats that an acute stressor can shift instrumental responding from goal-directed to habitual control is consistent with similar findings in humans.",

It has been shown to be effective in inflammatory, chronic venous and edematous treatment conditions in vitro and in vivo, and is broadly used to treat chronic venous insufficiency. The purpose of this study was to find out whether aescin influences the effect on rat cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4) by using cocktail probe drugs in vivo; the influence on the levels of CYP mRNA was also studied.",

Blood samples were collected at a series of time-points and the concentrations of probe drugs in plasma were determined by HPLC-MS/MS. The corresponding pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by the software of DAS 2.0. In addition, real-time RT-PCR was performed to determine the effects of aescin on the mRNA expression of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 in rat liver.", 
    "34": "Treatment with a single dose or multiple doses of aescin had inductive effects on rat CYP1A2, while CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzyme activities were inhibited. Moreover, aescin has no inductive or inhibitory effect on the activity of CYP2E1. The mRNA expression results were in accordance with the pharmacokinetic results.", 
    "35": "Aescin can either inhibit or induce activities of CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Therefore, caution is needed when aescin is co-administration with some CYP1A2, CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 substrates in clinic, which may result in treatment failure and herb-drug interactions.", 
    "36": "The present work describes an alternative generic approach to LC-MS for the analysis of drugs of abuse as well as their metabolites in post-mortem tissue samples. The platform integrates liquid extraction surface analysis (LESA) for analytes tissue extraction followed by differential ion mobility spectrometry (DMS) mass spectrometry for analytes gas phase separation. Detection is performed on a triple quadrupole linear ion trap using the selected reaction monitoring mode for quantification as well as product ion scan mode for structural confirmatory analyses. The major advantages of the platform are that neither chromatographic separation nor extensive sample preparation are required. In DMS the combination of a high separation voltage (i.e., up to 4 kV) together with organic modifiers (e.g., alcohols, acetonitrile, acetone) added in the drift gas is required to achieve the separation of isomeric metabolites, such as the ones of cocaine and tramadol. DMS also separates morphine from its glucuronide metabolites, which allows for preventing the overestimation of morphine in case of fragmentation of the glucuronides in the atmospheric-to-vacuum interface of the mass spectrometer. Cocaine, opiates, opioids, amphetamines, benzodiazepines and several of their metabolites could be identified in post-mortem human kidney and muscle tissue based on simultaneous screening and confirmatory analysis in data-dependent acquisition mode using an analyte-dependent compensation voltage to selectively transmit ions through the DMS cell to the mass analyzer. Quantitative performance of the LESA-DMS-MS platform was evaluated for cocaine and two of its metabolites spotted onto a tissue section using deuterated internal standard. Analyte's responses were linear from 2 to 1000 pg on tissue corresponding to a limit of detection in the order of nanograms of analyte per gram of tissue. Accuracy and precision based on QC sample was found to be less than 10%. Replicate analyses of cocaine and its metabolites in forensic samples showed an intra- and inter-sections variability of less than 25%.",

The dog rapidly developed refractory seizures and was managed by inducing heavy sedation with phenobarbital, benzodiazepines, ketamine, and propofol, necessitating 48 hours of mechanical ventilation. Seizure activity continued despite these treatments until IV administration of levetiracetam. The dog was discharged from the hospital 6 days after admission and remains neurologically normal currently, with no further seizure activity after 9 months.", 
    "39": "This report documents the first successful treatment of a dog that ingested > 43 mg/kg of 5-FU. In this case, the use of rapid decontamination, heavy sedation with anticonvulsant medications including levetiracetam to control seizures, and mechanical ventilation may have contributed to a positive outcome.", 
    "40": "Despite notable success over years in the discovery and development of new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), about 30-40% of the patients are resistant to drug treatment. There is a still significant need to develop novel AEDs that demonstrate superior efficacy, broad spectrum of activities and good safety profile. The synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPA-R) and voltage-gated potassium channels (KCNQ2/Q3) are clinically validated as new molecular targets for epilepsy. The discovery of SV2A as a target for levetiracetam, 2,3-benzodiazepine GYKI 52466 as a non-competitive AMPA-R antagonist and retigabine as a KCNQ2/Q3 channels activator provided a rational basis to develop novel AEDs. The optimization of SV2A binding affinity of levetiracetam led to the discovery of novel high affinity SV2A ligands that displayed superior efficacy and protective index in animal models of epilepsy. The high-throughput screening (HTS) and medicinal chemistry efforts yielded many non-competitive AMPA-R antagonists of which perampanel was recently approved as a first-in-a new class. The efficacy and lack of sub-type selectivity of retigabine prompted many research efforts to discover several potent and selective KCNQ2/Q3 channel activators of distinct chemical scaffolds that are at various stages of clinical development. Despite the known role of galanin and galanin receptor (Gal-R) in epilepsy over a decade, development of potent and brainpenetrant Gal-R agonists is very challenging. The discovery of selective Gal-R2 positive allosteric modulator, CYM 2503, offers a valuable and an alternative approach. The review focuses on the available structure-activity relationships and preclinical efficacy of novel antiepileptic compounds that are distinct from most of the approved AEDs, specifically SV2A ligands, non-competitive AMPA-R antagonists, KCNQ2/Q3 channels activators and Gal-R modulators.",

Some derivatives of 2-(2-Phenoxy) phenyl-1, 3, 4-oxadiazole were synthesized as benzodiazepine receptor agonists. Conformational analysis and superimposition of energy minima conformers of the compounds on estazolam, a known benzodiazepine agonist, reveal that the main proposed benzodiazepine pharmacophores were well matched. Anticonvulsant activity of the synthesized compounds, determined by pentylenetetrazole-induced lethal convulsion test, showed that the introduction of an amino substituent in position 5 of 1,3,4- oxadiazole ring generates compound 9 which has a respectable effect. The results are in agreement with SAR of benzodiazepine receptor ligands since the elimination of electronegative substituent in position 2 of phenoxy ring or position 4 of phenyl ring reduces the anticonvulsant activity.",

The present study was undertaken to evaluate the antidepressant and sedative-hypnotic potential of acute administration of the hydroalcoholic extract of this plant in mice. Additionally, the effects of flumazenil on the hypnotic activity of the extracts were evaluated. None of the doses of the extract could significantly reduce immobility time in comparison with control group in antidepressant tests. In hypnotic test, 250 and 400 mg/kg dose ssign ificantly increased pentobarbital-induced sleeping time compared to vehicle. All of the doses of the extract significantly reduced the latency to sleep in comparison to the vehicle. Flumazenil reversed the augmented effects of extracts in pentobarbital-induced hypnotic test. The results of the present study indicate the low antidepressant and good sedative-hypnotic effects of the hydroalcoholic extract of Asperugo procumbens aerial parts in mice and that the central benzodiazepine receptors are involved in the sedative-hypnotic effects of this plant.",

Quetiapine may produce fewer parkinsonian effects than paliperidone, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, risperidone and olanzapine.\u00a0Quetiapine appears to have a similar weight gain profile to risperidone, as well as clozapine and aripiprazole (although data are very limited for the latter two comparators).\u00a0Quetiapine may produce greater weight gain than ziprasidone and less weight gain than olanzapine and paliperidone. Most data that have been reported within existing comparisons are of very limited value because of assumptions and biases within them. Much scope is available for further research into the effects of this widely used drug.",

    "60": "Neuromuscular transmission is clinically monitored using the train-of-four ratio (TOFratio), which is the quotient between twitch tension produced by the fourth (T4) and by the first (T1) stimulus within a train-of-four stimulation at 2Hz. Neostigmine causes a paradoxical depression of the TOFratio (TOFfade) that is amplified by intra-arterial atropine in cats. This led us to question the usefulness of the TOFratio as a sole testing element to control neostigmine-induced reversal of neuromuscular transmission block caused by non-depolarizing agents. We hypothesized that the inhibition of cholinesterase activity might increase acetylcholine bioavailability and consequently cholinoceptor activation, leading to concomitant adenosine release from nerve endings and skeletal muscle fibers. The involvement of presynaptic muscarinic and adenosine receptors in neostigmine-induced TOFfade in the rat phrenic nerve diaphragm was investigated. Blockade of adenosine A2A receptors with ZM241385 and of muscarinic M2 receptors with methoctramine or atropine amplified neostigmine-induced TOFfade. Notwithstanding TOFfade amplification, the blockade of M2 or A2A receptors increased both T1 and T4 twitch tensions above control during the first 3min of neostigmine application. Beyond that period, the T1 twitch tension returned to baseline, whereas T4 decreased further until the control value with neostigmine alone. Blockade of M1 receptors by pirenzepine did not change neostigmine-induced TOFfade, unless A2A receptors were concurrently blocked with ZM241385. Data indicate that the paradoxical neostigmine-induced fade involves presynaptic mechanisms that regulate transmitter release and synaptic adenosine accumulation, including the activation of adenosine A2A and muscarinic M2 receptors.", 
    "61": "According to the memory-enhancing hypothesis of addictive drugs, post-training administration of cocaine should enhance consolidation and thus facilitate learning. This hypothesis has not been tested in appetitive tasks reinforced by sucrose. The current study assessed the effect of post-training cocaine administration on the acquisition of a win-stay task, and modulation of this effect by co-administration of diazepam. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=63) were trained for 5 days on a win-stay task performed on an 8-arm radial maze, and were administered cocaine (0, 2.5, 7.5 or 20mg/kg), diazepam (1mg/kg), or cocaine (7.5mg/kg)+diazepam (1mg/kg) immediately following each training session. Post-training cocaine caused dose-dependent impairments that appeared linked to the development of cocaine-induced sucrose taste avoidance and/or cocaine-induced anxiety. When it was attempted to modify these learned side effects of cocaine by co-administration of diazepam, it was observed that the drug combination slowed task completion and reduced overall number of nose pokes. These findings suggest that post-training cocaine can alter behavior on appetitive tasks through learned motivational deficits rather than through a selective action on memory consolidation. The implications for the memory-enhancing hypothesis of addictive drugs are discussed.", 
    "62": "We aimed to develop and validate a reliable method for stable long-term recordings of EEG activity in zebrafish, which is less prone to artifacts than current invasive techniques. EEG activity was recorded with a blunt electrolyte-filled glass pipette placed on the zebrafish head mimicking surface EEG technology in man. In addition, paralysis of agarose-embedded fish using D-tubocurarine excluded movement artifacts associated with epileptic activity. This non-invasive recording technique allowed recordings for up to one hour and produced less artifacts than impaling the zebrafish optic tectum with a patch pipette. Paralyzed fish survived, and normal heartbeat could be monitored for over 1h. Our technique allowed the demonstration of specific epileptic activity in kcnj10a morphant fish (a model for EAST syndrome) closely resembling epileptic activity induced by pentylenetetrazol. This new method documented that seizures in the zebrafish EAST model were ameliorated by pentobarbitone, but not diazepam, validating its usefulness. In conclusion, non-invasive recordings in paralyzed EAST syndrome zebrafish proved stable, reliable and robust, showing qualitatively similar frequency spectra to those obtained from pentylenetetrazol-treated fish. This technique may prove particularly useful in zebrafish epilepsy models that show infrequent or conditional seizure activity.",

The analytes were adsorbed from large volume samples (60 mL) onto octadecyl silica SPE columns. After the elution of the desired compounds from sorbents with 2.0 mL acetone, 0.5 mL of eluent containing 40.0 \u03bcL chloroform was injected rapidly into 4.5 mL pure water. After extraction and centrifugation, 2 \u03bcL of the sedimented phase was injected into a GC equipped with a flame ionization detector. Several parameters affecting this process were investigated and optimized. Under the optimal conditions, LODs ranged from 0.02 to 0.05 \u03bcg/L, a linear dynamic range of 0.1-100 \u03bcg/L and relative SDs in the range of 4.4-10.7% were attained. Very high preconcentration factors ranging from 3895-7222 were achieved. The applicability of the method for the extraction of BZPs from different types of complicated matrices, such as tap water, fruit juices, and urine samples, was studied. The obtained results reveal that the proposed method is a good technique for the extraction and determination of BZPs in complex matrices.",

It has been identified as a key target for many clinical drugs. In the present study, we construct the structure of human 2\u03b1\u20812\u03b2\u2082\u03b3\u2082 GABA(A)R using a homology modeling method. The structures of ten benzodiazepine type drugs and two non-benzodiazepine type drugs were then docked into the potential benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA(A)R. By analyzing the docking results, the critical residues His102 (\u03b1\u2081), Phe77 (\u03b3\u2082) and Phe100 (\u03b1\u2081) were identified in the binding site. To gain insight into the binding affinity, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed for all the receptor-ligand complexes. We also examined single mutant GABA(A)R (His102A) in complexes with the three drugs (flurazepam, eszopiclone and zolpidem) to elucidate receptor-ligand interactions. For each receptor-ligand complex (with flurazepam, eszopiclone and zolpidem), we calculated the average distance between the C(\u03b1) of the mutant residue His102A (\u03b1\u2081) to the center of mass of the ligands. The results reveal that the distance between the C(\u03b1) of the mutant residue His102A (\u03b1\u2081) to the center of flurazepam is larger than that between His102 (\u03b1\u2081) to flurazepam in the WT type complex. Molecular mechanic-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA)-based binding free energy calculations were performed. The binding free energy was decomposed into ligand-residue pairs to create a ligand-residue interaction spectrum. The predicted binding free energies correlated well (R(2)\u2009=\u20090.87) with the experimental binding free energies. Overall, the major interaction comes from a few groups around His102 (\u03b1\u2081), Phe77 (\u03b3\u2082) and Phe100 (\u03b1\u2081). These groups of interaction consist of at least of 12 residues in total with a binding energy of more than 1 kcal mol(-1). The simulation study disclosed herein provides a meaningful insight into GABA(A)R-ligand interactions and helps to arrive at a binding mode hypothesis with implications for drug design.",

The most frequent causing agents are neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs), latex and antibiotics, with latex being the first cause in paediatrics. With regard to perioperative anaphylactic reactions, the usual early signs and symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction could be overlooked or erroneously interpreted and non-severe anaphylaxis could go undetected, with a risk of more severe reactions in the future. Using the data registered on the anaesthesia sheet, it is essential to establish a chronological relationship between drugs and/or substances administered and the reaction observed. An elevated level of tryptase confirms an anaphylactic reaction, but this does not usually increase in the absence of compromised circulation. An allergy study should be carried out preferably between 4 and 6 weeks after the reaction, using a combination of specific IgE, skin and controlled exposure tests (if indicated). Test sensitivity is good for NMBAs, latex, antibiotics, chlorhexidine, gelatine and povidone, and poor for barbiturates, opiates (these can give false positives since they are histamine releasers) and benzodiazepines. Special preventive measures should be taken, especially in the case of latex. We present the maximum concentrations recommended for skin tests, the recommended dosage to treat anaphylactic reactions in paediatrics and a procedure algorithm for the allergological study of these reactions.", 
    "120": "Response and remission are of great importance to patients with first-episode schizophrenia. Although previous researches have revealed characteristics related to medication response, there is rarely data over remission-related factors. We presume that factors correlated to response may also influence remission in 1 year treatment for first-episode schizophrenia. 398 drug-na\u00efve patients met the criteria of schizophrenia using ICD-10 criteria were recruited from Shanghai Mental Health Center and treated with one of three second generation antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine or quetiapine). Patients were followed up for 1 year and assessed at 2 weeks, and then 2, 3, 6, 8 and 12 months. Severity of symptom was evaluated using the Chinese version of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Response was defined as a reduction of 50% or more PANSS scores. The 8-item criteria of remission (proposed by the Remission of Schizophrenia Working Group) were used. Logistic regression analysis revealed that shorter duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), longer treatment time, higher baseline PANSS positive score and higher PANSS general pathological scores predicted response, and acute prodromal phase was the independent factor for remission. These results indicate baseline characters that related to response and those related to remission may be different for patients with schizophrenia.",

In addition, many of the studies on sexual dysfunction associated with mood stabilizers and anxiolytic drugs are limited by other methodological flaws. While there is evidence to suggest that mood stabilizers, with some exceptions, negatively affect sexual functioning, there is still insufficient evidence to draw any clear conclusions about the effects of anxiolytic drugs on sexual function. There is some weak evidence to indicate that switching from enzyme-inducing to non-enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drugs, could be clinically useful. Some researchers recommend that sexual dysfunction in patients taking antiepileptic drugs should in general be treated according to standard guidelines for the management of sexual dysfunction, since reliable data on special populations is not available.

Here we validate this hypothesis, demonstrating the efficacy of the BET inhibitor I-BET151 across a variety of AML subtypes driven by disparate mutations. We demonstrate that a common 'core' transcriptional program, which is HOX gene independent, is downregulated in AML and underlies sensitivity to I-BET treatment. This program is enriched for genes that contain 'super-enhancers', recently described regulatory elements postulated to control key oncogenic driver genes. Moreover, our program can independently classify AML patients into distinct cytogenetic and molecular subgroups, suggesting that it contains biomarkers of sensitivity and response. We focus AML with mutations of the Nucleophosmin gene (NPM1) and show evidence to suggest that wild-type NPM1 has an inhibitory influence on BRD4 that is relieved upon NPM1c mutation and cytosplasmic dislocation. This leads to the upregulation of the core transcriptional program facilitating leukemia development. This program is abrogated by I-BET therapy and by nuclear restoration of NPM1. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of I-BET151 in a unique murine model and in primary patient samples of NPM1c AML.

It is based on a collection of random forest models trained on diverse chemical data sets of more than 20\u2009000 molecules annotated with their experimentally determined SoMs. Using a comprehensive set of available data, FAME aims to assess metabolic processes from a holistic point of view. It is not limited to a specific enzyme family or species. Besides a global model, dedicated models are available for human, rat, and dog metabolism; specific prediction of phase I and II metabolism is also supported. FAME is able to identify at least one known SoM among the top-1, top-2, and top-3 highest ranked atom positions in up to 71%, 81%, and 87% of all cases tested, respectively. These prediction rates are comparable to or better than SoM predictors focused on specific enzyme families (such as cytochrome P450s), despite the fact that FAME uses only seven chemical descriptors. FAME covers a very broad chemical space, which together with its inter- and extrapolation power makes it applicable to a wide range of chemicals.

Opioidergic neurotransmission may be implicated in the development of these metabolic disturbances. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of opioid blockade on OLZ-treated patients' metabolic status. Patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (n=30) on a stable dose of OLZ were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive an opioid receptor antagonist, naltrexone (NTX), (n=14) or placebo (n=16). The primary outcome measure was the change in body mass index (BMI) at 12 weeks. Secondary measures included body fat and fat-free mass, along with homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), plasma lipids and liver function tests (LFTs). There was no significant change in BMI between the treatment arms. However, in comparison to the OLZ + placebo combination, the OLZ + NTX group displayed a significant decrease in the fat and increase in fat-free mass along with a trend towards improvement in HOMA-IR values. There were no significant differences in plasma lipids and LFTs. These findings suggest that addition of NTX to OLZ may attenuate OLZ-induced body fat mass gain.

    "160": "The duration of action of a drug is commonly estimated using plasma concentration, which is not always practical to obtain or an accurate estimate of functional half life. For example, flumazenil is used clinically to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines like midazolam; however, its elimination can be altered by other drugs, including some benzodiazepines, thereby altering its half life. This study used Schild analyses to characterize antagonism of midazolam by flumazenil and determine the functional half life of flumazenil. Four monkeys discriminated 0.178mg/kg midazolam while responding under a fixed-ratio 10 schedule of stimulus-shock termination; flumazenil was given at various times before determination of a midazolam dose-effect curve. There was a time-related decrease in the magnitude of shift of the midazolam dose-effect curve as the interval between flumazenil and midazolam increased. The potency of flumazenil, estimated by apparent pA2 values (95% CI), was 7.30 (7.12, 7.49), 7.17 (7.03, 7.31), 6.91 (6.72, 7.10) and 6.80 (6.67, 6.92) at 15, 30, 60 and 120min after flumazenil administration, respectively. The functional half life of flumazenil, derived from potency estimates, was 57\u00b113min. Thus, increasing the interval between flumazenil and midazolam causes orderly decreases in flumazenil potency; however, across a broad range of conditions, the qualitative nature of the interaction does not change, as indicated by slopes of Schild plots at all time points that are not different from unity. Differences in potency of flumazenil are therefore due to elimination of flumazenil and not due to pharmacodynamic changes over time.",

If a model is statistically non-identifiable, the conventional derivative-based estimation approach is often terminated earlier without converging, due to the singularity. To circumvent this difficulty, we develop a derivative-free global optimization algorithm by combining PSO with a derivative-free local optimization algorithm to improve the rate of convergence of PSO. We further propose an efficient approach to not only checking the convergence of estimation but also detecting the identifiability of nonlinear PK models. PK simulation studies demonstrate that the convergence and identifiability of the PK model can be detected efficiently through the proposed approach. The proposed approach is then applied to clinical PK data along with a two-compartmental model.",

We are describing a case of a verified bite by an Indian ornamental tree spider (Poecilotheria regalis), where the patient developed severe, long lasting muscle cramps several hours after the bite. We present a comprehensive review of the literature on bites of these beautiful spiders and conclude that a delayed onset of severe muscle cramps, lasting for days, is characteristic for Poecilotheria bites.

    "163": "Persistent activation of GABAA receptors triggers compensatory changes in receptor function that are relevant to physiological, pathological and pharmacological conditions. Chronic treatment of cultured neurons with GABA for 48h has been shown to produce a down-regulation of receptor number and an uncoupling of GABA/benzodiazepine site interactions with a half-time of 24-25h. Down-regulation is the result of a transcriptional repression of GABAA receptor subunit genes and depends on activation of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. The mechanism of this uncoupling is currently unknown. We have previously demonstrated that a single brief exposure of rat primary neocortical cultures to GABA for 5-10min (t\u00bd=3min) initiates a process that results in uncoupling hours later (t\u00bd=12h) without a change in receptor number. Uncoupling is contingent upon GABAA receptor activation and independent of voltage-gated calcium influx. This process is accompanied by a selective decrease in subunit mRNA levels. Here, we report that the brief GABA exposure induces a decrease in the percentage of \u03b13-containing receptors, a receptor subtype that exhibits a high degree of coupling between GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites. Initiation of GABA-induced uncoupling is prevented by co-incubation of GABA with high concentrations of sucrose suggesting that it is dependent on a receptor internalization step. Moreover, results from immunocytochemical and biochemical experiments indicate that GABA exposure causes an increase in GABAA receptor endocytosis. Together, these data suggest that the uncoupling mechanism involves an initial increase in receptor internalization followed by activation of a signaling cascade that leads to selective changes in receptor subunit levels. These changes might result in the assembly of receptors with altered subunit compositions that display a lower degree of coupling between GABA and benzodiazepine sites. Uncoupling might represent a homeostatic mechanism that negatively regulates GABAergic transmission under physiological conditions in which synaptic GABAA receptors are transiently activated for several minutes.", 
    "164": "Progesterone is a known anticonvulsant, with its inhibitory effects generally attributed to its secondary metabolite, 5\u03b1,3\u03b1-tetrahydroprogesterone (THP), and THP's enhancement of GABAA receptor activity. Accumulating evidence, however, suggests that progesterone may have non-genomic actions independent of the GABAA receptor. In this study, we explored THP/GABAA-independent anticonvulsive actions of progesterone in a mouse model of hippocampal kindling and in mouse entorhinal slices in vitro. Specifically, we examined the effects of progesterone in kindled mice with or without pretreatments with finasteride, a 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor known to block the metabolism of progesterone to THP. In addition, we examined the effects of progesterone on entorhinal epileptiform potentials in the presence of a GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin and finasteride. Adult male mice were kindled via a daily stimulation protocol. Electroencephalographic (EEG) discharges were recorded from the hippocampus or cortex to assess \"focal\" or \"generalized\" seizure activity. Kindled mice were treated with intra-peritoneal injections of progesterone (10, 35, 100 and 160mg/kg) with or without finasteride pretreatment (50 or 100mg/kg), THP (1, 3.5, 10 and 30mg/kg), midazolam (2mg/kg) and carbamazepine (50mg/kg). Entorhinal cortical slices were prepared from na\u00efve young mice, and repetitive epileptiform potentials were induced by 4-aminopyridine (100\u03bcM), picrotoxin (100\u03bcM) and finasteride (1\u03bcM). Pretreatment with finasteride did not abolish the anticonvulsant effects of progesterone. In finasteride-pretreated mice, progesterone at 100 and 160mg/kg decreased cortical but not hippocampal afterdischarges (ADs). Carbamazepine mimicked the effects of progesterone with finasteride pretreatments in decreasing cortical discharges and motor seizures, whereas midazolam produced effects similar to progesterone alone or THP in decreasing hippocampal ADs and motor seizures. In brain slices, progesterone at 1\u03bcM inhibited entorhinal epileptiform potentials in the presence of picrotoxin and finasteride. We suggest that progesterone may have THP/GABAA-dependent and independent anticonvulsive actions in the hippocampal-kindled mouse model.", 
    "165": "We aim to evaluate the influence of covariates, including cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) genetic polymorphisms, on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (MDZ) in Asian cancer patients, using a population pharmacokinetic approach.

Concentrations of MDZ and its major metabolites, 1'-hydroxymidazolam (1OHM) and 1'-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide (HMG) were measured using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The population pharmacokinetic study was conducted using NONMEM. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and genetic polymorphisms were screened as covariates. A two-compartment model for MDZ and two sequential compartments representing 1OHM and HMG best described the data. The CYP3A5*3 and total bilirubin level significantly influenced MDZ clearance. The population typical MDZ clearance for CYP3A5*3 expressers was 22% lower than non-expressers. Baseline bodyweight was a statistically significant covariate for clearance and distribution volume of 1OHM. Creatinine clearance was positively correlated with HMG clearance. Our data indicate that CYP3A5*3, total bilirubin, bodyweight, and creatinine clearance are important predictors of MDZ and metabolite pharmacokinetics. Further studies in more patients are needed to explore the links between the identified covariates and the disposition of MDZ and its metabolites.",

To investigate their induction and inhibition properties, administering probe drugs and monitoring their concentration in plasma under the effects of inducers/inhibitors is the gold standard method. A rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed for simultaneous quantification of midazolam, raltegravir (probe drugs for CYP3A4 and UGT1A1), their major metabolites, 1'-hydroxymidazolam, 1'-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide and raltegravir glucuronide, rifampicin (inducer), ritonavir and ketoconazole (inhibitors).

The method was validated and found to be accurate (88-111%), precise (CV%<13) and selective. Matrix effect was acceptable (88-118%) and analytes recovery was reproducible (60-95%). Analytes in plasma were also found to be stable in the autosampler (6\u00b0C for 48h) and after two freeze-thaw cycles.

The head contains nicastrin ectodomain. The membrane-embedded base has a central channel and a lateral cleft, which may represent the initial substrate docking site. Inhibitor binding induces widespread structural changes, including rotation of the head and closure of the lateral cleft. These changes block substrate access to the catalytic pocket and inhibit the enzyme. Intriguingly, peptide substrate docking has reciprocal effects on the inhibitor binding site. Similar reciprocal shifts may underlie the mechanisms of other inhibitors and of the \"lateral gate\" through which substrates access to the catalytic site.",

The tonic-clonic phase was self-limited and was followed by focal facial twitching, which was interrupted by bolus administration of intravenous diazepam. The ictal event was documented as pressure oscillations during cystometrogram recordings and a period of external urethral sphincter muscle activation, which was detectable by electromyography. An acute decrease in urethral pressure was demonstrated at the end of the generalized seizures. Ketamine anesthesia combined with relatively rapid infusion of saline into the bladder may have contributed to the onset of seizures. In addition, this case highlights the value of having a fast-acting benzodiazepine agent available to stop continuous or residual seizure activity during diagnostic or experimental procedures in anesthetized nonhuman primates.",

The aim of the research was to estimate the efficacy and safety of cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors as novel lipid modifying drugs. Systematic searches of English literature for randomized controlled trials (RCT) were collected from MEDLINE, EBASE, CENTRAL and references listed in eligible studies. Two independent authors assessed the search results and only included the double-blind RCTs by using cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors as exclusively or co-administrated with statin therapy irrespective of gender in enrolled adult subjects. Two independent authors extracted the data by using predefined data fields. Of 503 studies identified, 14 studies met the inclusion criteria, and 12 studies were included into the final meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis revealed that CETP inhibitors increased the HDL-c levels (n = 2826, p<0.00001, mean difference (MD) = 20.47, 95% CI [19.80 to 21.15]) and total cholesterol (n = 3423, p = 0.0002, MD = 3.57, 95%CI [1.69 to 5.44] to some extent combined with a reduction in triglyceride (n = 3739, p<0.00001, MD = -10.47, 95% CI [-11.91 to -9.03]) and LDL-c (n = 3159, p<0.00001, MD = -17.12, 95% CI [-18.87 to -15.36]) irrespective of mono-therapy or co-administration with statins. Subgroup analysis suggested that the lipid modifying effects varied according to the four currently available CETP inhibitors. CETP inhibitor therapy did not increase the adverse events when compared with control. However, we observed a slight increase in blood pressure (SBP, n = 2384, p<0.00001, MD = 2.73, 95% CI [2.14 to 3.31], DBP, n = 2384, p<0.00001, MD = 1.16, 95% CI [0.73 to 1.60]) after CETP inhibitor treatment, which were mainly ascribed to the torcetrapib treatment subgroup. CETP inhibitors therapy is associated with significant increase in HDL-c and decrease in triglyceride and LDL-c with satisfactory safety and tolerability in patients with dyslipidemia.

Subjects received a single morning dose of ZST (1.0, 1.75, and 3.5\u2009mg) or placebo in a four-way crossover study. In male and female subjects zolpidem PK were linear, with area under the curve (AUC) proportional to dose, and apparent oral clearance and elimination half-life independent of dose. However, AUC averaged 40% to 50% higher in females than in males receiving the same dose. The gender effect was incompletely explained by body weight. In females, ZST produced PD changes consistent with benzodiazepine agonist effects, particularly at the 3.5-mg dose. For several PD variables, PD effects were significantly related to plasma zolpidem concentrations when data were aggregated across subjects. However, there was variability in response among individuals. In males, PD effects of zolpidem seldom differed from placebo regardless of plasma concentration. The findings confirm that zolpidem clearance is lower in females than in males. PD effects of zolpidem from ZST are greater in female subjects, due to a combination of higher plasma concentrations and greater intrinsic sensitivity.", 
    "205": "Nimodipine has been investigated in the treatment of anxiety. Its administration, however, presents a number of limitations, particularly by low bioavailability, low aqueous solubility and photosensitivity. These difficulties can be resolved by the use of nanometer-scale pharmaceutical carriers. The goal of the present study was thus to develop a liposomal formulation containing nimodipine (NMD-Lipo) and evaluate anxiolytic activity using models of anxiety (open-field, light and dark and elevated plus-maze test). The results suggest that administration of NMD-Lipo has no sedative or muscle relaxant effect in animals, since there was no reduction in the number of crossings, grooming and rearings. The increased residence time of the animals treated with NMD-Lipo in the bright field is a reflection of the anxiolytic-like activity of the formulation. Furthermore, the reduction in residence time of rodents treated with the combination of flumazenil and NMD-Lipo in the illuminated box suggests that NMD-Lipo acts on benzodiazepine receptors. The increase in the number of entries and length of stay in the open arms of mice treated with NMD-Lipo suggests that anxiolytic activity of formulation and reduction in number of entries and length of stay in open arms of rodents treated with a combination of flumazenil and NMD-Lipo suggest that NMD-Lipo act on benzodiazepine receptors.",

The pathophysiology of primary RLS is only partly understood; however, a strong association with brain iron deficiency, which possibly impairs dopaminergic function, has been identified. Dopamine agonists are the mainstay of RLS treatment, but other therapies, including gabapentin, benzodiazepines, and low-potency opioids, are also commonly employed. Recent evidence-based guidelines recommend dopamine agonists or alpha-2-delta ligands as the first-line treatment for RLS depending on patients' clinical background, comorbidity, and severity of the symptoms. In this review, we focus on the pathophysiology, comorbidity, differential diagnosis, and novel treatment approaches of RLS.", 
    "207": "This paper reports a qualitative pilot study exploring primary care health practitioners' perspectives on the management of insomnia following the extensive media coverage on the adverse effects of zolpidem in 2007-08. General practitioners and community pharmacists were recruited throughout metropolitan Sydney, New South Wales using a convenience sampling and snowballing technique. Demographic information was collected from each participant followed by a semistructured interview. In total 22 participants were interviewed, including eight general practitioners and 14 community pharmacists. Interview transcripts were analysed using 'framework analysis'. Participants' responses illuminated some of the key issues facing primary care practitioners in the management of insomnia. Practitioners perceived there to be an overreliance on pharmacotherapy among insomnia patients and inadequate support for directing patients to alternative treatment pathways if they require or prefer non-pharmacological management. Current prescribing trends appear to favour older benzodiazepines in new cases of insomnia whereas some successful sporadic users of zolpidem have continued to use zolpidem after the media coverage in 2007-08. The findings of this pilot study suggest the need to address the limitations in the management of insomnia within the current health care system, to revise and disseminate updated insomnia guidelines and to provide educational opportunities and resources to primary care practitioners concerning management options.", 
    "208": "Mitochondria are the main source of energy for neurons and have a role in many vital neuronal functions. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been described in schizophrenia, and antipsychotics such as clozapine and olanzapine have been associated with differences in gene expression in mitochondria. We investigated the hypothesis that nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, particularly those involved in oxidative phosphorylation or involved in oxidative stress, mitochondrial biogenesis, inflammation, and apoptosis, would be associated with antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG). In total, we selected 28 genes and analyzed 60 SNPs (50 are functional), in 283 schizophrenia subjects, treated with atypical medications for up to 14 weeks. Association between AIWG (as measured by the % of weight gain from baseline) and SNP genotypes were tested using linear regression with treatment duration, baseline body weight, and medication type as covariates. We observed a significant association between rs6435326 in the NDUFS1 gene and AIWG in the subset of European patients (N=150, Pcorrected=0.02). The haplotype carrying the risk alleles of rs6435326 and two other SNPs (rs1053517 and rs1801318) in NDUFS1 was also nominally associated with percentage of weight gain (T-C-G vs A-T-A, P=0.005). In addition, stepwise linear regression was performed to select important variables predictive of the outcome, and a gene-gene interaction analysis was carried out. We observed a significant interaction between the TT risk genotype of rs6435326 in NDUFS1 and AG genotype of rs3762883 in COX18 (Pcorrected=0.001). A permutation-based test of all 60 SNPs jointly showed significant association with weight gain (P=0.02). Finally, our replication study of rs6435326, rs1053517 and rs1801318 in NDUFS1 using samples from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) showed that rs1801318 was significantly associated with AIWG (N=200, Pcorrected=0.04), and the three SNPs were collectively associated with AIWG (P=0.04). In conclusion, our findings suggest an association between NDUFS1 and AIWG in schizophrenia subjects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore genetic variation in the mitochondrial genes in the context of AIWG.", 
    "209": "Neural tumors often express neurotransmitter receptors as markers of their developmental lineage. Although these receptors have been well characterized in electrophysiological, developmental and pharmacological settings, their importance in the maintenance and progression of brain tumors and, importantly, the effect of their targeting in brain cancers remains obscure. Here, we demonstrate high levels of GABRA5, which encodes the \u03b15-subunit of the GABAA receptor complex, in aggressive MYC-driven, \"Group 3\" medulloblastomas. We hypothesized that modulation of \u03b15-GABAA receptors alters medulloblastoma cell survival and monitored biological and electrophysiological responses of GABRA5-expressing medulloblastoma cells upon pharmacological targeting of the GABAA receptor. While antagonists, inverse agonists and non-specific positive allosteric modulators had limited effects on medulloblastoma cells, a highly specific and potent \u03b15-GABAA receptor agonist, QHii066, resulted in marked membrane depolarization and a significant decrease in cell survival. This effect was GABRA5 dependent and mediated through the induction of apoptosis as well as accumulation of cells in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Chemical genomic profiling of QHii066-treated medulloblastoma cells confirmed inhibition of MYC-related transcriptional activity and revealed an enrichment of HOXA5 target gene expression. siRNA-mediated knockdown of HOXA5 markedly blunted the response of medulloblastoma cells to QHii066. Furthermore, QHii066 sensitized GABRA5 positive medulloblastoma cells to radiation and chemotherapy consistent with the role of HOXA5 in directly regulating p53 expression and inducing apoptosis. Thus, our results provide novel insights into the synthetic lethal nature of \u03b15-GABAA receptor activation in MYC-driven/Group 3 medulloblastomas and propose its targeting as a novel strategy for the management of this highly aggressive tumor.",

Nonepileptic paroxysmal events can be due to physiological or exaggerated physiological responses, parasomnias, movement disorders, behavioral or psychiatric disturbances, or to hemodynamic, respiratory, or gastrointestinal dysfunction. Vitamin B12 deficiency is a treatable cause of failure to thrive and developmental regression, involuntary movements, and anemia. Involuntary movements rarely may appear a few days after the initiation of vitamin B12 treatments and might be misdiagnosed as seizure.

    "211": "Zolpidem is a widely prescribed anti-insomnia agent. Although most pediatric zolpidem ingestions are benign, large ingestions can cause significant central nervous system (CNS) depression. Flumazenil has been reported to reverse the CNS effects of zolpidem. We describe a case of a large pediatric zolpidem ingestion resulting in profound CNS depression that responded to flumazenil administration. Serial zolpidem serum levels confirmed the ingestion. A 10-year-old boy with trisomy 21 presented to the emergency department 1 hour after he was found sedate with several zolpidem 5-mg tablets in his mouth. Seventeen tables (85 mg) were unaccounted for from a prescription bottle. He became unarousable approximately 2 hours after his ingestion. Flumazenil 0.2 mg intravenously was given with rapid return to his baseline mental status. He became resedate 1 hour later but was arousable. Sixteen hours after his presentation, he was asymptomatic. Serial zolpidem serum levels were obtained, showed an initial level of 310 ng/mL, and demonstrated zero-order kinetics. Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine, which binds to the benzodiazepine receptor. It is rapidly absorbed and has a short-half life. Unintentional pediatric ingestions of zolpidem are typically well tolerated. However, this case demonstrates that large ingestions may cause significant and prolonged CNS depression. Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, has been described to reverse the effects of zolpidem in adult ingestions. There are few published reports describing flumazenil use in pediatric ingestion patients. This case suggests that flumazenil may be an effective treatment for zolpidem-induced CNS depression in the pediatric patient.", 
    "212": "The defensive burying test is an experimental model that is used to explore anxiety-like behavior in adult rats. Because the expression of anxiety-like behavior may differ between infant and adult rats, we tested the impact of chambers with different sizes and shapes on defensive burying in 28-day-old Wistar rats. The first two chambers had base areas of 560 cm, but one was rectangular and the other round. The base areas of the other two chambers were 282 cm, also with one rectangular and one round. We examined the effects of vehicle and 1 mg/kg diazepam on defensive burying in the various chambers. Locomotor activity was also measured to identify or exclude any sedative effects. Independent of the treatments used, the infant rats showed a shorter burying latency in the three modified chambers and a longer cumulative burying time compared with the original apparatus. The effects of diazepam (i.e. increased latency and decreased burying time) were only significant in the small round chamber, without significant effects on general motor activity. These results suggest that a small round chamber that is used to test burying behavior is sensitive to the anxiolytic actions of diazepam when the experimental subjects are very young rats.",

Consequently, polyamines rise as potential neuropharmacological tools in the prospection of new therapeutic drugs. In this paper, we report on the biological activity of synthetic polyamine Mygalin, which was tested as an anticonvulsant in model of chemically induced seizures. Male Wistar rats were injected with vehicle, diazepam, MK-801 or Mygalin at different doses followed by Pentylenetetrazole or N-Methyl-D-Aspartate administration. Mygalin presented protection against seizures induced by both NMDA injections and PTZ administration by 83.3% and 16.6%, respectively. Moreover, it prolonged the onset of tonic-clonic seizures induced by PTZ. Furthermore, it was tested in neuroethological schedule evaluating possible side-effects and it presented mild changes in Open Field, Rotarod and Morris Water Maze tests when compared to available anticonvulsant drugs. The mechanism underlying the anticonvulsant effect of Mygalin is noteworthy of further investigation, nevertheless, based on these findings, we hypothesize that it may be wholly or in part due to a possible NMDA receptor antagonism. Altogether, the results demonstrate that Mygalin has an anticonvulsant activity that may be an important tool in the study of prospection of therapeutics in epilepsy neuropharmacology.", 
    "214": "Tapering strips can be used for the gradual reduction of the dose of certain types of drugs such as antidepressants and benzodiazepines.

    "220": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin on learning and memory in rats with diazepam-induced amnesia.", 
    "221": "Experiments were carried out on 48 white male Wistar rats, divided into 6 groups, each of 8 rats. The experimental animals were treated per os for 14 days with atorvastatin and rosuvastatin in doses of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg body weight, respectively. To induce amnesia diazepam was administered intraperitoneally in a dose of 2.5 mg/kg bw. Cognitive skills of the animals were examined after the induction of amnesia with active avoidance test using autonomic reflex conditioner (shuttle box) and passive avoidance tests (step-through and step down) (Ugo Basile, Italy). The following parameters were assessed: number of conditioned responses (avoidances), number of unconditioned responses (escapes) and number of intertrial crossings in the active avoidance test; latency of reactions was measured in the passive avoidance tests.", 
    "222": "We found a significant increase of conditioned responses in atorvastatin treated animals (in a dose of 10 mg/kg bw) in active avoidance training. In the animals treated with rosuvastatin in both doses there was a statistically significant increase of unconditioned responses. In the step-through passive avoidance test there was significant improvement of short-term and long-term memory following administration of atorvastatin (10 mg/kg bw). Rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg bw) preserves long-term memory. In the step-down passive avoidance test, atorvastatin (10 mg/kg bw) and rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg bw and 20 mg/kg bw) preserve long-term memory.",

    "224": "Atypical antipsychotic drugs such as olanzapine induce weight gain and metabolic changes associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms underlying these metabolic side-effects are unknown at the moment. In this study, we investigated the metabolic changes induced by a chronic treatment, as well as the influence of a preceding chronic treatment on the acute effects of olanzapine on glucose metabolism. The effect of chronic olanzapine treatment (\u00b16.5\u00a0mg/kg/day, administered via drinking water) on body weight, locomotor activity, body temperature, fat distribution and energy expenditure was investigated in male rats. After 5\u00a0weeks, the animals received an acute olanzapine challenge (intragastric, IG) at 3\u00a0mg/kg/h during 160\u00a0min to investigate the acute effects of olanzapine on glucose metabolism. Chronic olanzapine-treated animals showed a slight decrease in nocturnal body temperature, and increased perirenal fat pad weights as well as plasma leptin. In addition, chronic olanzapine-treated animals showed hyperinsulinaemia with unchanged blood glucose concentrations. The acute challenge with IG olanzapine elevated blood glucose levels and endogenous glucose production in control animals, but not in chronic olanzapine-pre-treated rats. Chronic olanzapine-treated animals also showed reduced locomotor activity and a higher respiratory exchange ratio. Thus, chronic treatment with olanzapine in rats causes desensitization to its acute effects on glucose metabolism but promotes adiposity probably due to a shift from lipids to carbohydrates as an energy source. Chronic exposure to olanzapine changes body fat distribution and insulin sensitivity in an unfavourable direction, but it is still unclear what the primary mechanism is.", 
    "225": "Neuroinflammation is a complex biological response to any injury occurring to the central nervous system. It is mainly characterized by the recruitment of immune system cells, namely the microglial cells, in the site of injury. Once activated, microglia expresses a cholesterol transporter protein (TSPO), previously also known as peripheral type benzodiazepine receptor. PK11195 is a ligand for TSPO and, labelled with a positron emitter, it is also the most used tracer for PET molecular imaging to in vivo map the microglia activation in various neurological disorders, including ischemic stroke. Recent [(11)C]PK11195 PET studies proved activated microglia both locally in the area of the infarct and at distance along the affected fibre tracts, suggesting the presence of two different microglia subtypes with peculiar functions in disease progression. The aim of this review is to discuss the most recent knowledge about imaging neuroinflammation in ischemic stroke and in the atherosclerotic and vascular inflammatory disorders, trying to elucidate the interplay between the clinical course and the activation of a microglial response.",

Each patient's demographic and clinical characteristics, the need for ventilatory support, the use and dosage of medications, the number of nursing staff per bed, the time elapsed from admission to the intensive care unit until the effective start of enteral feeding, and the causes for nonadministration were recorded. Achievement of daily calorie goals was determined and correlated with risk factors.", 
    "228": "A total of 262 daily evaluations were done in 40 patients. Daily calorie goal was achieved in only 46.2% of the evaluations (n = 121), with a mean of 74.8% of the prescribed volume of enteral nutrition infused daily. Risk factors for inadequate nutrition support were the use of midazolam (odds ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.18-2.11) and fewer nursing professionals per bed (odds ratio, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.43-4.57). Conclusion Achievement of daily calorie goals was inadequate, and the main factors associated with this failure were the use and dosage of midazolam and the number of nurses available.",

    "231": "Male C57BL/6J mice with electrodes implanted in the medial forebrain bundle were trained under a three-component rate-frequency as well as a progressive ratio (PR) ICSS procedure. The effects of nitrous oxide, toluene vapor, cocaine, and diazepam on ICSS were then examined.", 
    "232": "Concentrations of 1,360-2,900 parts per million (ppm) inhaled toluene vapor significantly facilitated ICSS in the rate-frequency procedure and 1,360\u00a0ppm increased PR breakpoint. A concentration of 40\u00a0% nitrous oxide facilitated ICSS in the rate-frequency procedure but reduced PR breakpoint. Doses of 3-18\u00a0mg/kg cocaine facilitated ICSS in the rate-frequency procedure, and 10 and 18\u00a0mg/kg increased PR breakpoint. Doses of 1 and 3\u00a0mg/kg diazepam facilitated ICSS in the rate-frequency procedure, and 3\u00a0mg/kg increased PR breakpoint.", 
    "233": "The reinforcement-facilitating effect of toluene in ICSS is at least as great as diazepam. By contrast, nitrous oxide weakly enhances ICSS in only the rate-frequency procedure. The data suggest that the rate-frequency procedure may be more sensitive than the PR schedule to the reward-facilitating effects of abused inhalants.",

    "243": "Benzodiazepines have been widely used in clinical praxis for many decades. They act as GABAA receptor agonists and possess muscle-relaxant, hypnotic-sedative, anticonvulsant, and anxiolytic properties. Flumazenil acts as a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist (subunits \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13, and \u03b15) or partial agonist (subunits \u03b14 and \u03b16). It competitively inhibits the activity at the benzodiazepine recognition site on the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex, thereby reversing the effects of benzodiazepines. In our experiments, administration of flumazenil in rabbits was surprisingly associated with anxiolytic effects similar to those of midazolam. Additionally, flumazenil significantly and dose-dependently decreased the total number of vocalizations in rats, i.e. it was anxiolytic. These observations seem to be in contrast to the effect of flumazenil in humans, where it is believed to produce mainly anxiogenic effects. It seems that in individuals, who exhibit anxiogenic behavior or in individuals with anticipation anxiety, flumazenil acts as an anxiolytic agent, while in individuals without any signs of anxiety, flumazenil can also act as anxiogenic agent. Thus, we hypothesize that flumazenil is associated with decreased intensity of anticipatory anxiety due to occupancy of benzodiazepine binding sites by an endogenous ligand with inverse agonistic properties.",

    "248": "Exposure to emotionally arousing experiences elicits a robust and persistent memory and enhances anxiety. The amygdala complex plays a key role in stress-induced emotional processing and in the fear memory formation. It is well known that ERK activation in the amygdala is a prerequisite for fear memory consolidation. Moreover, stress elevates p-ERK2 levels in several areas of the brain stress circuitry. Therefore, given that the ERK1/2 cascade is activated following stress and that the role of this cascade is critical in the formation of fear memory, the present study investigated the potential involvement of p-ERK2 in amygdala subnuclei in the promoting influence of stress on fear memory formation and on anxiety-like behavior. A robust and persistent ERK2 activation was noted in the Basolateral amygdala (BLA), which was evident at 5min after restraint and lasted at least one day after the stressful experience. Midazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine ligand, administered prior to stress prevented the increase in the p-ERK2 level in the BLA. Pretreatment with intra-BLA infusion of U0126 (MEK inhibitor), but not into the adjacent central nucleus of the amygdala, attenuated the stress-induced promoting influence on fear memory formation. Finally, U0126 intra-BLA infusion prevented the enhancement of anxiety-like behavior in stressed animals. These findings suggest that the selective ERK2 activation in BLA following stress exposure is an important mechanism for the occurrence of the promoting influence of stress on fear memory and on anxiety-like behavior.",
