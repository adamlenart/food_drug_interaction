    "0": "Stiff-man syndrome is a rare neurologic disorder characterized by progressive, fluctuating muscle rigidity with painful muscle contractions affecting predominantly the back and proximal extremities. In the ED, the diagnosis can be easily overlooked and misdiagnosed as acute or chronic low back pain and muscle spasm. This syndrome is often associated with diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. This report describes an illustrative case of a 39-year-old woman who presented to the ED with a two-year history of right leg spasms and low back pain that had become so severe in the preceding two days that she was unable to ambulate. Clues to the patient's proper diagnosis coincide with the diagnostic criteria for stiff-man syndrome: the presence of a slowly progressive stiffness of the axial muscles and proximal limb muscles, making ambulation difficult; hyperlordosis of the lumbar spine; episodic spasms precipitated by jarring or sudden movement; a normal intellectual, sensory, and motor examination when not in spasm; and a marked amelioration of symptoms with the IV administration of diazepam. High-dose oral diazepam is the maintenance drug of choice.", 
    "1": "Zopiclone is a cyclopyrrolone derivative which possesses hypnotic activity. This drug is known to increase the slow sleep stage compared to benzodiazepines in polysomnography. The subjects were 10 right-handed healthy male volunteers aged 21-23 years. Double-blind crossover trials with placebo control were conducted in a random sequence at intervals of 1 week. Zopiclone 7.5 mg and placebo were administered as single oral doses. Three-minute vigilance controlled EEGs at before and at 1, 3, and 5 h after drug administration, and the response times were recorded. One minute out of the 3-minute EEGs was analyzed with FFT and the power spectrum was obtained. Then the absolute amplitude power (microV) was calculated. These results were subjected to Student's t-test (double difference) and displayed with topographic maps (t statistic significance probability mapping). Zopiclone prolonged the latency of the response time, and increased the amount of delta absolute amplitude power over the right central region, beta 1 absolute amplitude power over the left central region and beta 2 absolute amplitude power over the right central area along with decreased alpha absolute amplitude power over the occipital region and theta power over the left frontal pole area after 1 h, when the peak pharmacological effect was expected. The EEG profiles of zopiclone were different from that of diazepam reported previously concerning the increase in delta activity.", 
    "2": "We studied the differences in alterations of GABAAergic receptor function between pentobarbital (PB)-dependent female Lewis (LEW) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The 36Cl- influx induced by 10 microM GABA in the PB-dependent WKY was significantly lower than that in the control, while there was no significant 36Cl- influx change in both PB-dependent and control LEW. The additions of PB, flunitrazepam (FZ) and ethanol (EtOH) enhanced the GABA-dependent 36Cl- influx in control rats of both strains. However, the enhancements of 36Cl- influx by PB, FZ, EtOH were not recognized in PB-dependent WKY. On the other hand, the enhancement of GABA-dependent 36Cl- influx was observed only with the addition of PB in PB-dependent LEW. The additions of bicuculline (BIC) and picrotoxin (PIC) inhibited GABA-dependent 36Cl- influx in control rats of both strains. However, inhibition of 36Cl- influx by BIC and PIC was not recognized in the PB-dependent WKY. These results suggest that physical dependence on PB in WKY may cause greater functional alterations of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex than those in LEW, and that these changes in this receptor complex may relate to the difference in the development of physical dependence on PB between the two strains.", 
    "3": "The Vogel-type conflict task, in which drinking of water by animals is punished by electric shock, is well known as a simple conflict procedure, and has come into wide use. This task has almost been established in rats. On the other hand, there are only few reports about application of the task to mice, and such studies have not proceeded smoothly. This report presents technical problems in the application of the task to mice based on various experiments, in which experimental conditions such as procedures, intensity of electric shock and mouse strain differed, in order to determine the anti-conflict action of diazepam (DZ). These experiments showed that successful detection of DZ action depended upon the experimental conditions. Therefore, experimental designs are important in evaluating anti-conflict action of chemicals in the Vogel-type task in mice.", 
    "4": "The rat social interaction test is based on spontaneous social interaction behaviors, such as sniffing and following between two rats, and thus does not necessitate noxious food or water deprivation, electric shocks and lengthy training. The amount of time that pairs of rats spent interacting with each other varied systematically with the environmental stimuli, such as the illumination and familiarity of the test arena. When tested under the most aversive high light: unfamiliar condition, control subjects exhibited low levels of social interaction. Acute treatment with benzodiazepine-related agents exerted anxiolytic effects, as measured by an increase in the time spent by pairs of rats engaged in social interaction, while anxiogenic agents decreased social interaction under the same high light: unfamiliar condition. The minimum effective doses of benzodiazepine-related agents in this paradigm corresponded well to their respective clinical dosages. Thus, the simple social interaction test is beneficial in assessing effects of agents on the anxiety states of animals in a qualitative and quantitative manner. Treatment with 5-HT-related anxiolytic agents also increased social interaction. However, there existed some differences in the magnitude of increases or characteristics of each behavioral component between benzodiazepine- and 5-HT-related agents, which were consistent with the clinical literature regarding their efficacy in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Therefore, the rat social interaction test is predictable for clinical anxiolytic effects of non-benzodiazepine agents in comparison with benzodiazepines.",

    "6": "Systemic administration of benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists leads to behavioral changes similar to those produced by inescapable shock (IS). The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is a critical structure mediating IS effects. The present experiments determined whether the DRN is a site mediating the behavioral changes produced by benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists. Microinjection of the inverse agonist Methyl 6,7-Dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) in the region of the DRN produced enhancement of fear conditioning as assessed by the amount of freezing in the presence of shock cues as well as interference with shuttlebox escape learning assessed 24 hr later. Furthermore, lesion of the DRN blocked the effects of systemic DMCM on fear conditioning and escape learning. These data suggest that the DRN is indeed critical in mediating these behavioral consequences of DMCM and further support a role for the DRN in producing the behavioral changes induced by IS.", 
    "7": "The clinical, electrographic and reported neuropsychological features of 50 children with non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) were reviewed and the children's progress followed for one to five years. NCSE occurred in a variety of epilepsies, especially the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Clinical manifestations ranged from obvious mental deterioration to subtle changes. The condition had often been overlooked or misinterpreted and many children had experienced repeated episodes over long periods. Following diagnosis, immediate treatment was often not attempted or was not successful. Further episodes of NCSE occurred in the majority of children during the follow up period. Failure to recognise NCSE and to treat episodes promptly, and the high rate of recurrence, is of particular concern in view of fears that repeated exposure to this condition might be brain damaging. At least 28 children in the present series showed evidence of intellectual or educational deterioration over the period during which NCSE had occurred, although the exact cause was difficult to determine.", 
    "8": "Ketamine and midazolam, applied as intravenous medication for conscious sedation in day-case maxillo-facial surgery, has been proven to be superior to pentazocine and midazolam concerning cardiovascular parameters and respiratory depression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of low-dose ketamine/midazolam on anxiety, analgesia, amnesia and subjective feelings. METHODS. 140 out-patients (ASA I) were randomly divided into four groups. The double-blind study was prospective.", 
    "9": "Local anaesthesia (LA), articaine 4% plus epinephrine 1:200,000 (n = 35); test group P/M: LA, additional pentazocine 0.40 mg/kg bw and midazolam 0.075 mg/kg bw i.v. (n = 35); test group K25/M: LA, additionally ketamine 0.25 mg/kg bw and midazolam 0.075 mg/kg bw i.v. (n = 35), test group K50/M: LA, additionally ketamine 0.5 mg/kg bw and midazolam 0.075 mg/kg bw i.v. (n = 35). LA was injected 3 min after application of the systemic medication in the test groups or application of a placebo (saline 0.9%) in the control group. Three further minutes later, operation was started. For evaluation questionnaires, visual analogue scales (VAS) and the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) were used. For testing retrograde and anterograde amnesia, acoustic sensations were delivered before application of the systemic medication (a Christmas carol) and during operation (the German national anthem). RESULTS. The control group and the test groups were comparable with regard to biological data, duration of operation, applied dosage of local anaesthetics and actual anxiety before operation. The patients in all test groups rated intraoperative anxiety as mild, in contrast to the control group. Nearly no pain sensation during the operation was remembered in all test groups. Retrograde amnesia was not found in any group. Complete anterograde amnesia was observed in all test groups with respect to the intraoperative sensation, but even in the control group 50% of the patients did not remember having heard the national anthem. As subjective feelings negative criteria were mainly reported in the control group, where as in all test groups positive sensations dominated. Dreams were reported mostly after the higher dosage of ketamine, but no patient experienced any unpleasant dreams. The clinical assessment of the different regimes were excellent for test groups P/M and K50/M, modest for the control group and test group K25/M. Postoperatively, patients of test group P/M were remarkably sedated, but no clinically relevant sedation or motor weakness were observed in the other groups. Postoperative pain sensations were rated more intense in all test groups than in the control group. In test groups P/M and K25/M an increasing pain level was recorded during the postoperative period, with the consequence of a higher demand rate for analgesics. CONCLUSIONS. Dental surgery can be performed safely with low-dose ketamine/midazolam. Compared to pentazocine/midazolam, the higher dosage of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg bw) showed identical results intraoperatively, but was superior during the postoperative period (vigilance), and thus may represent a suitable dosage. The lower dosage of ketamine resulted in worse operating conditions, but a dosage higher than 0.5 mg/kg bw might lead to unconscious sedation and might increase the frequency of unpleasant dreams.", 
    "10": "Three experiments investigated a possible effect of nitrous oxide (N2O) on food intake in nondeprived male hooded rats in independent groups designs. Experiment 1 demonstrated a concentration-related increase in intake with increasing level of nitrous oxide (10-40% N2O), reaching statistical significance at 20% N2O when compared to room air controls (p < 0.05). In experiment 2, pretreatment with 10 and 20 mg/kg of the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, failed to significantly attenuate 30% N2O-induced hyperphagia. In Experiment 3, pretreatment with the opioid antagonist, naltrexone, effectively antagonized 30% N2O-induced hyperphagia. Pronounced attenuation (to 59% of 30% N2O-induced intake level over a 1 h period) at the lowest dose of naltrexone (0.1 mg/kg, p < 0.01) compared to vehicle level resulted in a shallow dose-response curve across the dose range tested (0.1-10.0 mg/kg). These results suggest that an endogenous opioid mechanism is prominently involved in the N2O-induced ingestive response.", 
    "11": "Discoveries of long-term potentiation and immediate early gene in the central nervous system have enabled new developments in experiments on learning and memory. These experiments are conducted in many kinds of animals with different procedures, physiology, chemistry and pharmacology. However, there is still some confusion when these various procedures are discussed. Memory is defined as information storage of an animal's previous experiences. The memory induces changes in behavioral performance. This means that memory must be observed in whole animals, and one question that can occur is how does long-term potentiation, for example, correlate with memory. Furthermore, memory has been divided into two major classifications, declarative and non-declarative, from the comparison of amnesias observed in humans and animals. The declarative memory can be observed in human subjects, but not in animals. This article presents a neuronal circuit concerning memory formation and some results obtained from benzodiazepines, and it discusses some problems encountered executing when experiments on learning and memory. In addition, the discussion speculates over the possibility for an \"anti-dementia drug\".", 
    "12": "Diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed on 16 patients aged 2 months to 18 years at Jordan University Hospital in the period between May 1990 to January 1993. The adult side-viewing duodenoscope was used, and visualization of appropriate ductal system was accomplished in 100% of the cases with no complications. Intravenous sedation was used in 69% of the cases with diazepam and pethidine (meperidine). ERCP provided valuable additional information in patients with hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases. However, it did not demonstrate significant pathology in patients with otherwise unexplained abdominal pain. Endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) was successfully performed on four infants and small children with common bile duct stones. It is concluded that ERCP and ES are relatively easy and safe techniques when applied to infants and children with pancreatobiliary disorders.", 
    "13": "Guidelines for the management of febrile seizures are presented. Intrarectal administration of diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) is the first line therapy for complex or prolonged seizures. Preventive treatment of recurrence is mainly indicated in case of complex seizures using either prolonged daily monotherapy, preferentially sodium valproate, or intermittent administration of diazepam during febrile illnesses.", 
    "14": "In the acid hydrolysis of diazepam (1), several unusual products, apart from 2-(N-methylamino)-5-chlorobenzophenone (2) and glycine, were isolated. On the assumption that some of those products could arise from further degradation of 2, the reaction of this compound with 0.5-2 M HCl was studied, in 1:1 MeOH-H2O, at 60 and 80 degrees C. Several unexpected products were isolated from the reaction of 2 with HCl, namely, 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone (3), 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-5-chlorobenzophenone (4), 2-(N-methylamino)-3,5-dichlorobenzophenone (5), 2-amino-3,5-dichlorobenzophenone (6), 2,4-dichloro-10-methyl-9,10- acridinone (7), and 2,4-dichloro-9,10-acridinone (8). The methyl transfers, the chlorination, and the cyclization reactions that give rise to products 3-8 are unexpected under the present reaction conditions. The rate of reaction of 2, as well as the rate of formation of compounds 3-6, was measured at several HCl concentrations.", 
    "15": "Anti-inflammatory drugs are widely used therapeutic agents and are very often administered with various other drugs. Because they are highly bound to human serum albumin (HSA), interferences between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and coadministered drugs may arise from their interactions at a binding site on HSA. Although the percentage of binding to HSA is generally accurately determined, the binding sites to which a particular therapeutic agent binds are often unknown. In order to clarify where different classes of NSAIDs bind on the HSA molecule, competition studies were carried out on a HSA-based HPLC column using site I and site II markers as displacing agents. Results show that all the NSAIDs included in the study were affected by site I and site II markers and that a number of drugs had (an) extra binding site(s) not affected by any of the competitors used in the study. Competition data also suggest that binding of NSAIDs at the benzodiazepine site could in fact occur at two separate subsites, as previously observed for benzodiazepines.", 
    "16": "Effects of midazolam on the cardiac autonomic nervous system were studied by power spectral analysis of electrocardiographic R-R intervals in patients undergoing elective lower abdominal surgery under spinal anaesthesia. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups: 10 patients in group A received spinal anaesthesia only and 10 in group S received spinal anaesthesia and midazolam of 0.05 mg/kg when surgery started. In the frequency domain power spectra, low (Lo; 0.04-0.15 Hz) and high (Hi; 0.15-0.40 Hz) frequency components were integrated to ascertain sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, respectively. There was no intergroup difference in starting time of surgery, ventilatory frequency, arterial pressure, heart rate, mean and variance of R-R interval, and cephalad level of analgesia. In spectral component, Lo decreased (P < 0.05) and Hi/Lo ratio increased (P < 0.05) relative to their baselines in group S. These were also different from group A (P < 0.05). We concluded that intravenous midazolam depressed sympathetic activity to produce a vagotonic cardiac autonomic nervous system under spinal anaesthesia.", 
    "17": "The efficacy of ginger for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting was studied in a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial in 108 ASA 1 or 2 patients undergoing gynaecological laparoscopic surgery under general anaesthesia. Patients received oral placebo, ginger BP 0.5g or ginger BP 1.0g, all with oral diazepam premedication, one hour prior to surgery. Patients were assessed at three hours postoperatively. The incidence of nausea and vomiting increased slightly but nonsignificantly with increasing dose of ginger. The incidence of moderate or severe nausea was 22, 33 and 36%, while the incidence of vomiting was 17, 14 and 31% in groups receiving 0, 0.5 and 1.0g ginger, respectively (odds ratio per 0.5g ginger 1.39 for nausea and 1.55 for vomiting). These results were essentially unchanged when adjustment was made for concomitant risk factors. We conclude that ginger BP in doses of 0.5 or 1.0 gram is ineffective in reducing the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting.", 
    "18": "Rhabomyolysis with myoglobinuria has been added relatively recently to the neurologic complications associated with the increased use of cocaine and the introduction of its alkaloid form (crack). This retrospective study reports our experience with 14 patients who presented with rhabdomyolysis after cocaine use in a municipal hospital over a 3-year period. Seven patients used \"crack\", 2 intravenous and 3 nasal insufflation. All patients but one had hyperthermia, 11 altered mental status, 8 tachycardia, and 4 muscle rigidity. Nine developed renal failure; 3 of these patients died. Two other patients died of cardiorespiratory arrest. Cocaine-related rhabdomyolysis has a high mortality. The observed association with hyperthermia and other central neurologic features resembles the neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Since chronic cocaine use may alter the availability of dopamine either through transmitter depletion or decrease in the number of dopamine receptors, a common pathogenetic mechanism is possible. However, other mechanisms, which are not mutually exclusive but rather frequently overlapping, may play an important role. These include agitation, hyperthermia, adrenergic overstimulation leading to vasoconstriction and ischemia or calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum resulting in increased entry into the muscle cell leading to cell death; in addition, cocaine has direct toxic effect on the muscles.", 
    "19": "Sex differences, and the influence of drug dosage and additional upper airway obstruction were studied in midazolam-induced breathing patterns and sedation in 30 healthy volunteers (8 males and 22 females). After administration of 0.1 mg.kg-1 midazolam (8 male and 8 female subjects), the rib cage (RC) motion increased in 6 males and the abdominal wall (ABD) motion and SaO2 decreased in all males. In contrast, the RC and ABD motions and SaO2 decreased in all females. Snoring and loss of consciousness occurred in 7 males and in 2 females. There were significant differences in the RC motion, SaO2, the incidence of snoring and the sedative state between male and female subjects. A bolus dose of 0.5 mg of flumazenil completely antagonized the sedative effect of midazolam and restored the breathing pattern, whereas it did not completely restore SaO2. A higher dose (0.2 mg.kg-1) of midazolam was administered to an additional 8 females. It caused a loss of consciousness in all subjects and increased the RC motion in only one subject. Partial obstruction of the nasal cavity was effected with cotton balls in the remaining 6 females who were sedated with 0.1 mg.kg-1 midazolam. An increase in the RC motion occurred similar to that observed in males. These findings suggest a difference in midazolam-induced sedation and breathing patterns between male and female subjects with midazolam administration on a mg.kg-1 basis.", 
    "20": "The pharmacokinetics of propofol was studied in 11 Asian patients with fentanyl-isoflurane anaesthesia during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Instead of the usual increments of morphine and a benzodiazepine, propofol (4 mg/kg/h) was initiated at the start of CPB and ceased at CPB separation. Whole blood propofol concentrations were determined during and postinfusion using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Data from four patients seemed to fit a two-compartment model, whereas those from seven patients were significantly (F test, p < 0.05) better fitted to a three-compartment model. The pharmacokinetic parameters were as follows: The mean (SD) of the initial distribution phase t1/2 pi, intermediate distribution phase t1/2 alpha, and elimination phase t1/2 beta were 2.22 (1.04) min, 42.9 (16.4) min, and 370 (138) min, respectively. The mean clearance of 1.31 (0.50) L/min was lower than those reported from other studies, whereas the mean blood concentration of 2.2 (1.0) mg/L at the 1-h infusion period was higher. The mean calculated apparent Css was 3.9 (1.5) mg/L. The low clearance is likely to be due to hemodynamic changes during CPB and CABG, thereby affecting drug distribution and blood flow to the liver.", 
    "21": "The effects of long-term hyperstimulation with cholecystokinin (CCK) on the pancreatic contents of anionic and cationic trypsin(ogen) and amylase were studied in the rat. Endogenous hyperCCKemia was evoked in rats by pancreaticobiliary diversion (PBD), and exogenous hyperCCKemia by continuous subcutaneous CCK infusion. In addition, the effect of continuous subcutaneous infusion of the CCK A receptor antagonist devazepide was studied. After 4 weeks blood samples were obtained for the determination of plasma CCK concentrations and the animals were sacrificed. The pancreatic glands were harvested, weighted, and extracted. The extracts were analyzed for anionic and cationic trypsin and amylase. Enzyme contents showed a large interindividual variation. The most consistent change in enzyme pattern was an increase in the ratio between anionic and cationic trypsin in animals with hyperCCKemia (PBD operated or CCK infused). Furthermore, this ratio decreased significantly in animals treated with devazepide. In conclusion, stimulation of the CCK receptor changed the ratio between anionic and cationic trypsin in the pancreatic gland, while it was reversed during blockade of the receptor.", 
    "22": "The effects of chronic administration of hydrocortisone (10 mg/kg/day) on the development and evolution of acute pancreatitis induced by supramaximal stimulation with cerulein were examined in the rat. In these circumstances the potentially therapeutic effect of L-364,718, a CCK-receptor antagonist, was assayed. Administration of hydrocortisone over 7 days did not increase the severity of edematous acute pancreatitis induced by cerulein, since the reduction in pancreatic secretion, the hyperamylasemia and the increase in the levels of hematocrit and fluid in the pancreatic tissue were similar in rats with acute pancreatitis treated and untreated with hydrocortisone previously. When hydrocortisone was administered chronically, before administration of supramaximal doses of cerulein, a spontaneous regression of acute pancreatitis occurred. However, when hydrocortisone administration was continued after inducing pancreatitis, pancreatic recovery was prevented, observing a significantly depressed acinar secretion and elevated values of hematocrit and tissue fluid (edema). L-364,718 administration proved to be detrimental in the evolution of edematous acute pancreatitis when the rats had been treated chronically with hydrocortisone because the blockade exerted on secretion prevented the draining of enzymes stored in excess by hydrocortisone administration.", 
    "23": "The involvement of ganglionic muscarinic M1 receptors in vagally induced bronchoconstriction in guinea-pig airways is controversial. Therefore, we studied the effects of the M1-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine on vagus nerve (VNS, preganglionic) and electrical field stimulation (EFS, postganglionic)-induced contractions of the guinea-pig main bronchus under various experimental conditions. Using identical stimulation parameters for VNS and EFS (8V, 30 Hz, 0.5 ms, 5s every min), the amplitude of the VNS-induced twitch contractions was 30.4% of the EFS-induced responses, and pirenzepine showed 2.3-fold selectivity (pIC50-values 6.45 and 6.09, respectively) to inhibit vagally induced contractions. With the stimulation frequency for EFS lowered to match contraction levels obtained using VNS, pirenzepine was equipotent to inhibit both types of response at M3 receptor-selective concentrations, suggesting that M1 receptors are not involved. By contrast, when the stimulation episode was prolonged until plateau contraction (10-20 s), in the presence of the nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium (5 microM), the M2 receptor antagonist AQ-RA 741 (0.1 microM) and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist timolol (1 microM), and again using matched VNS- and EFS-induced contraction levels, pirenzepine inhibited nerve stimulation-evoked responses in a biphasic manner, yielding pIC50-values of 8.12 (indicative of M1 receptor blockade) and 6.43 (indicative of M3 receptor blockade) for the first and second phase, respectively, while postganglionic stimulation showed a purely monophasic inhibition (pIC50 = 6.32). These results show that facilitatory muscarinic M1 receptors are involved in vagally mediated contraction of guinea-pig bronchi, under conditions of elevated neurotransmission and partial nicotinic receptor blockade.", 
    "24": "Status epilepticus is defined as a condition characterized by epileptic seizure prolonged or repeated so as to produce a lasting epileptic state. It is estimated that status epilepticus occurs in 50,000 to 60,000 individuals in the United States, with one third to one half of episodes occurring in patients with established epilepsy.", 
    "25": "We report an anesthetic management for Miles' operation in a 50-year-old female who had frequent severe bronchial asthmatic attacks prior to surgery. Because the surgical field was in the lower abdomen, we selected spinal anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia. For spinal anesthesia, 15 mg of hyperbaric tetracaine with epinephrine was used. Moreover, 3 ml of 2% mepivacaine with epinephrine was injected via an epidural catheter, and then analgesia up to Th 6 was obtained. In order to prevent an asthmatic attack during surgery, the following cares were taken: (1) administration of moisturized oxygen by nebulizer via a nasal canula, (2) intravenous administration of steroid, (3) addition of epinephrine to the local anesthetics, and (4) sedation by music. The surgery was completed safely without asthmatic attacks. Postoperatively, pain control with buprenorphine was managed with a continuous extradural infusion. The patient was discharged 50 days after surgery, and was in a favorable condition without bronchial asthmatic attacks.", 
    "26": "1. Voltage- and ligand-gated currents were recorded from solitary rabbit rod bipolar cells using the whole cell patch-clamp technique. The rod bipolar cell forms a single, stereotypical physiological and morphological class of cells that was easily identified from other neurons and support cells after enzymatic and mechanical dissociation from isolated retina. Protein kinase C immunoreactivity confirmed the validity of using a purely morphological identification of this cell type. 2. Voltage steps in 15-mV increments from a holding potential of -45 mV elicited a large outward current activated near -30 mV. These voltage-gated currents were eliminated by using equimolar substitutions of Cs+ and tetraethylammonium+ for K+ in the pipette, indicating that they represent a mixture of K+ currents. 3. The putative inhibitory neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine activated inward Cl- currents when pressure-applied from pipettes placed near the axon terminals of rod bipolar cells, which were voltage-clamped at -45 mV. With changes in intracellular or extracellular Cl- concentration, the reversal potential of these ligand-gated currents changed as predicted by the Nernst equation for Cl- activity. The dose-response curves for GABA and glycine were sigmoidal with saturating concentrations of 100 and 300 microM, respectively. 4. GABA-activated currents were 1) reversibly reduced by the allosteric inhibitor picrotoxin and the competitive antagonist bicuculline; 2) potentiated by the benzodiazepine diazepam and the barbiturate barbital sodium; and 3) indistinguishable from muscimol-activated currents. There was no response to the GABAB agonist baclofen. Collectively, these data strongly suggest that the GABA-activated currents in rabbit rod bipolar cells are mediated by the GABAA receptor. This is similar to the GABA-activated currents in other mammalian rod bipolar cells. 5. Application of the conformationally restricted GABA analogue cis-4-aminocrotonic acid (CACA) failed to elicit a response, whereas the conformationally extended GABA analogue trans-4-aminocrotonic acid (TACA) elicited a response similar to that of GABA. Although bicuculline appeared to suppress the GABA-activated current slightly more than the TACA-activated current (not significant using Student's t-distribution), GABA- and TACA-activated currents were equally suppressed by picrotoxin and equally enhanced by diazepam and barbital sodium. These data, coupled with the inefficacy of CACA, argue against the existence of a GABAC-type channel in the rod bipolar cell of the rabbit and suggest that GABA and TACA were activating the same GABAA receptor-channel complex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "27": "Studies of the subcellular localization of neuroreceptors in the rat brain have shown that most of them are associated with light and low density subcellular fractions. In two human brain areas, quite different subcellular distributions were observed. After fractionation by differential centrifugation of frontal cortex homogenates, benzodiazepine and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors were mainly found in the heavy mitochondrial (M) fraction, whereas mu-opiate and muscarinic cholinergic receptors were mainly concentrated in the microsomal (P) fraction. In human putamen, the presynaptic markers of dopaminergic nerve terminals (neurotensin receptors, dopamine uptake sites and amine vesicular transporter-binding sites), benzodiazepine receptors and serotonin uptake sites were recovered both in the high and low density fractions, whereas the muscarinic, opiate and, to a lesser extent, dopamine D2 receptors were mostly concentrated in the microsomal fraction. In the cerebral cortex, after isopycnic centrifugation in sucrose gradients, neuroreceptors were found in the high density fractions where the peaks of cytochrome oxidase and that of nerve endings, as identified by amine uptake and by means of electron microscopy were also found. A single peak of benzodiazepine receptors was observed in high density (1.15-1.17 g/ml) fractions suggesting that these receptors are much more concentrated in the nerve terminals or dendrites rather than in the dendritic spines or vesicles. The fact that muscarinic and opiate receptors were recovered in the P fraction with plasma membrane constituents and also in M and L fractions, which is confirmed by a bimodal distribution in sucrose gradient, suggests that they are localized in both the nerve terminals or dendrites and in the small vesicles or dendritic spines. In the putamen, much of the specific binding to uptake sites for dopamine and serotonin was recovered in the high density fractions, but the existence of another peak at a lower density indicates the presence of microsomal uptake sites. The results indicate that differential and isopycnic fractionation methods performed on human brain samples, make it possible to separate tissue fractions enriched in nerve endings, dendrites, dendritic spines, plasma membranes or vesicles.", 
    "28": "The goal of the present study was to determine the effect of acute ethanol (ETOH), administered intraperitoneally or electro-osmotically, on norepinephrine (NE) induced increases in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mediated inhibition of single cerebellar Purkinje neurons (P-cells). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (230-370g) were anesthetized with halothane and implanted with an intraperitoneal catheter for systemic administration of ETOH (1.0-1.5 g/kg) prior to the recording session. Extracellular activity of single P-cells was recorded before and after iontophoresis of GABA and NE using five-barrel glass micropipettes. GABA was administered at the recording site by microiontophoretic pulses before, during and after continuous iontophoretic application of NE. Spontaneous discharge, GABA responses and NE-GABA interactions in P-cells were monitored for each experiment before and 1-1.5 h following systemic administration of ETOH. As in our previous reports administration of NE, at low ejection currents (10-60 nA), augmented GABA mediated suppression of P-cell spontaneous discharge. Between 10 and 60 min after injection of ETOH, this NE induced augmentation of GABA inhibition was further potentiated. This potentiation involved increases in both the magnitude and the duration of the GABA inhibition observed after NE alone. NE-induced augmentation of GABA inhibition persisted for 2-13 min longer after ETOH administration than in the pre-ETOH control period. Local electro-osmotic application of ETOH, which resulted in strong depression of spontaneous activity and caused small increases in GABA-mediated inhibition, did not directly potentiate NE-induced augmentation of GABA action. These results indicate that NE-mediated augmentation of GABA inhibition of P-cell activity is potentiated following systemic, but not local, ETOH administration.", 
    "29": "The goals of this study were: (1) to determine the effects of acute systemic or local application of ethanol (ETOH) on the response of cerebellar Purkinje cells (P-cells) to iontophoretically applied gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and (2) to characterize the effects of Ro15-4513, a putative antagonist of ETOH-GABA interactions, on ETOH-induced changes in GABA responsiveness. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (230-370 g) were anesthetized with halothane and implanted with intraperitoneal catheters for administration of ETOH (1.0-2.0 g/kg), before the recording session. Extracellular activity of single P-cells was recorded with the central barrel of a five-barrel micropipette, the other barrels of which were used for microiontophoresis of GABA and electro-osmosis of ETOH at the recording site. Spontaneous discharge and response of P-cells to GABA were monitored during a pre-ETOH control and for 1-1.5 h after systemic or electro-osmotic administration of ETOH. Transient suppression of spontaneous P-cell discharge was usually observed within 4-8 min of systemic ETOH injection. This effect lasted 2-4 min in 10 out of 19 rats tested. GABA-mediated inhibitory responses of cerebellar P-cells were increased by 45-50% relative to pre-ETOH values at 10 and 90 min post-ETOH injection. Prior administration of the imidazobenzodiazepine Ro15-4513 (4-6 mg/kg) failed to antagonize either the ETOH-induced enhancement of GABA-mediated inhibition or the transient inhibition of spontaneous P-cell activity rat cerebellar P-cell produced by ETOH. In these studies, electro-osmotically applied ETOH produced a potent suppression of spontaneous P-cell activity which precluded further augmentation of unit responses to GABA. These results show that doses of systemically administered ETOH which are mildly intoxicating in the awake, behaving animal, enhance the inhibitory action of GABA on cerebellar P-cell discharge.", 
    "30": "We examined the effects of the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, on epileptiform discharges evoked in the hippocampal CA1 region in vitro. Application of 100 nM flumazenil did not affect normal synaptic responses; however, flumazenil did depress epileptiform discharges induced by 8 mM [K+]o. Epileptiform discharges induced by the GABAA channel antagonist picrotoxin or by the K+ channel blocker 4-aminopyridine were unaffected. Application of the high-affinity, low-efficacy benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist, Ro 19-4603, blocked the anticonvulsant effect of flumazenil, indicating that this action of flumazenil is mediated at a benzodiazepine binding site located on the GABAA receptor. A likely explanation of the present results is that flumazenil antagonizes the action of an endogenous benzodiazepine inverse agonist, which is released during epileptiform discharges evoked in high K+ ACSF.", 
    "31": "Neurosurgical stimulation of the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) matter in man induces acute signs of autonomic arousal and feelings of subjective anxiety; those signs have phenomenological similarity with the symptom profile characterizing a panic attack. Animals undergoing dPAG stimulation show comparable physical signs of autonomic activation and sudden fear-suggestive behavioral reactions that can be shaped into operant self-interruption behavior. Drugs known to acutely reduce (alprazolam, clonazepam) or precipitate (yohimbine, caffeine) panic attacks in patients were found to acutely and dose-dependently reduce or enhance, respectively, aversion induced by dPAG stimulation in rats. When considered as an animal model of panic anxiety, the dPAG model simultaneously meets criteria of face validity (symptomatic homology) and predictive validity (pharmacological homology under short-term treatment); aspects of its construct validity (theoretical rationale supporting the model) are discussed. It is suggested that dPAG stimulation-induced aversion may represent a model of some aspects of panic disorders.", 
    "32": "[3H]Propyl-6-azido-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ([3H]ACCP) exhibited a high affinity for GABAA receptors affinity purified from the brains of adult rats, and binding of this compound could be inhibited by several ligands of the benzodiazepine binding site of GABAA receptors. On irradiation with UV light, [3H]ACCP, similarly to [3H]flunitrazepam, irreversibly labeled a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 51 kDa in affinity-purified GABAA receptors, and this labeling could be inhibited in the presence of diazepam. These data indicate that [3H]ACCP can be used as a photoaffinity label for GABAA receptors.", 
    "33": "In the burying behaviour test allopregnanolone (0.5 mg/rat) reduced the cumulative time of burying, interpreted as a reduction in anxiety. The selective benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil (5 and 10 mg/kg), did not affect the burying behaviour when administered alone but effectively prevented the reduction produced by allopregnanolone. No scheme modified the ambulatory behaviour, thus suggesting that the effect of these treatments was selective on experimental anxiety. These results indicate that the anxiolytic actions of neurosteroids are most likely mediated via the stimulation of GABAA receptors. Data are discussed on the basis of such relationships.", 
    "34": "The functional effects of muscarinic receptor antagonists were examined in vivo and in vitro on the rabbit urinary bladder. Inhibitory effects on carbachol-evoked contractions of detrusor strips were pronounced for 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP; -logIC50: 8.64), p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-diphenidol (pFHHSiD; 7.84) and atropine (8.27), while they were less pronounced for pirenzepine (6.62) and methoctramine (5.36). 4-DAMP and methoctramine increased 3H overflow from [3H]choline-labelled strips in response to electrical stimulation, contrary to pirenzepine, which decreased the overflow. Concomitant contractions were markedly reduced by 4-DAMP and by pirenzepine, but not by methoctramine. The -logIC50 estimations for atropine-sensitive electrically evoked contractions revealed methoctramine (4.85) to be less potent on nerve-evoked contractions than on carbachol-evoked contractions, in contrast to pirenzepine (7.15) and 4-DAMP (9.15). The effects of the antagonists in anaesthetized rabbits resembled those in vitro. Thus, muscarinic receptors in the rabbit urinary bladder are heterogeneous; prejunctional facilitatory (M1) and inhibitory (M2) for acetylcholine release, and postjunctional muscarinic M3 receptors mediating contractile responses.", 
    "35": "We developed a rapid and sensitive method of identifying benzodiazepines and zopiclone in human serum using high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). These drugs were developed and separated on plates within 8-11 min and detected by means of UV radiation and colour. Each drug was accurately identified by means of the values of RF x 100 and the spot colour in three systems. The detection limit of the benzodiazepines in serum was 0.1-0.4 micrograms/ml, except for cloxazolam and haloxazolam. The sensitivity was increased about ten-fold over the conventional method. These results suggested that the HPTLC system is useful for the initial detection and identification of these drugs in emergencies.", 
    "36": "The chemical structure corresponding to 1-hydroxy[1,1'-bicyclohexyl]-2-carboxylic acid 2-(diethylamino)-1-methylethyl ester has the classical profile of ester-type antimuscarinic drugs. The presence of three chiral carbons leads to eight stereoisomers and the substitutions on the cyclohexyl ring generate cis-isomers (1, named rociverine) and trans-isomers (2). The aim of this study was to determine the binding pattern of the eight stereoisomers and two derived compounds, (1S,2S)-1-hydroxy[1,1'-bicyclohexyl]-2-carboxylic acid 2-(dimethylamino)-1-ethyl ester (3) (1S,2S)-1-hydroxy[1,1'-bicyclohexyl]-2-carboxylic acid (S)-2-(diethylamino)-1-methylethyl ester methyl iodide (4), at the five cloned muscarinic receptors stably expressed in chinese hamster ovary cells, in order to define how stereochemical modifications could affect the affinity. Our data showed that cis-stereoisomers exhibited higher variations in affinity than trans-stereoisomers. Among the cis-stereoisomers, those with the (1R,2R) configuration showed considerably higher affinities (up to 240-fold) than those with the (1S,2S) configuration. The (1S,2S) configuration was important for binding selectivity; this was confirmed also by the use of the two additional compounds.",

    "44": "State-dependent learning (SDL) induced by ethanol (EtOH) was investigated on the step-through passive avoidance task in rats. Pretraining injection of EtOH dose-dependently reduced step-through latency in the test session 24 h after the training. Injection of EtOH (1.0 g/kg) before both the training and test sessions, however, failed to reduce the latency. These results show that EtOH produces SDL. The failure of learning performance in SDL (dissociation in SDL) induced by EtOH was blocked by bicuculline, Ro15-4513 and picrotoxin injected before the training session. The success of learning performance in SDL (non-dissociation in SDL) induced by EtOH was also blocked by bicuculline, Ro15-4513 and picrotoxin injected before the test session. The antagonism of Ro15-4513 against EtOH was blocked by flumazenil. In the substitution test, pretest injection of EtOH produced non-dissociation in SDL in the both of pretraining diazepam-and muscimol-treated rats. On the other hand, neither pretest injection of diazepam nor muscimol produced non-dissociation in the pretraining EtOH-treated rats: asymmetrical cross-substitution between EtOH and diazepam and between EtOH and muscimol was observed. These results suggest that the EtOH-induced SDL is partially mediated by the benzodiazepine (BDZ)/GABA-A receptor complex.", 
    "45": "Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine routinely used in intensive-care medicine. Conjugates of its main metabolite, alpha-hydroxymidazolam, have been shown to accumulate in renal failure but have not previously been related to the prolonged sedative effects commonly observed in critically ill patients. We report five patients with severe renal failure who had prolonged sedation after administration of midazolam. In all five patients, the comatose state was immediately reversed by the benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist flumazenil. Serum concentration monitoring showed high concentrations of conjugated alpha-hydroxymidazolam when concentrations of the unconjugated metabolite and the parent drug were below the therapeutic range. In-vitro binding studies showed that the affinity of binding to the cerebral benzodiazepine receptor of glucuronidated alpha-hydroxymidazolam was only about ten times weaker (affinity constant 16 nmol/L) than that of midazolam (1.4 nmol/L) or unconjugated alpha-hydroxymidazolam (2.2 nmol/L). Conjugated metabolites of midazolam have substantial pharmacological activity. Physicians should be aware that these metabolites can accumulate in patients with renal failure.", 
    "46": "The effects of diazepam on morphine-induced place preference were examined in mice. Pretreatment with diazepam (2 mg/kg i.p.) 30 min prior to morphine injection significantly abolished the morphine (5 mg/kg s.c.)-induced place preference, and this effect of diazepam was antagonized by pretreatment with flumazenil. In addition, pretreatment with diazepam prevented the morphine (5 mg/kg s.c.)-induced increase in dopamine turnover in the limbic forebrain. These results suggest that pretreatment with diazepam may suppress the rewarding effects of morphine.", 
    "47": "The main aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of buspirone, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, on successive negative contrast in one-way avoidance learning. Successive negative contrast was induced by shifting rats from a large reward (30 s spent in the safe compartment) to a small reward (1 s). Acute administration of buspirone (0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 mg/kg i.p.) did not attenuate the contrast effect, as opposed to that observed for diazepam (1 mg/kg i.p.). The highest dose of buspirone used, however, did interfere with the learning of the avoidance response itself. Chronic buspirone (20 days, 0.5 and 0.75 mg/kg i.p.) did not have any effect on successive negative contrast either. Overall, these results could suggest that the 5-HT1A receptor is not involved in the negative contrast effect studied, quite different to that observed for the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system. The findings are compared to results obtained with animal models selectively sensitive to some anxiolytic drugs, as are the so-called 'conflict models'.", 
    "48": "In vagotomized, midcollicular decerebrate, non-anesthetized cats, in which the preganglionic input to the stellate ganglion was intact and the right forelimb was autoperfused at constant flow, the muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine (PZP, 50 micrograms/kg i.v.), which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, produced a decrease in forelimb perfusion pressure (FLPP), heart rate (HR) and systemic arterial pressure (SAP). Administration of the nicotinic receptor antagonist hexamethonium (30 mg/kg i.v.) after PZP produced a further, larger drop in FLPP, HR and SAP. The dose of PZP used blocked the increase in FLPP and HR evoked by the muscarinic receptor agonist McN-A-343, but not the increase evoked by the nicotinic receptor agonist DMPP, when these drugs were injected into the arterial supply of the ganglion. Following administration of phentolamine and propranolol (2 mg/kg i.v. of each) which caused bradycardia and forelimb vasodilation, PZP had no effect on FLPP and HR. This finding suggests that PZP decreases sympathetic tone in resistance vessels and in the heart. Pirenzepine did not depress the forelimb vasoconstriction and the cardioacceleration evoked by electrical stimulation of the postganglionic vertebral and inferior cardiac nerves, respectively, suggesting that PZP does not act at the neuro-effector junctions. On the other hand, PZP blocked the forelimb vasoconstriction and the cardioacceleration produced by stimulating the preganglionic input of the stellate ganglion in presence of hexamethonium (30 mg/kg i.v.), indicating the stellate ganglion as the likely site of action of the drug. These findings suggest that the ganglion cell firing that underlies the sympathetic tone of cardiovascular effector cells is generated, in part, by a muscarinic, PZP-sensitive, synaptic mechanism.", 
    "49": "The effects of local cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8) administration on cortical extracellular levels of amino acids, catecholamines and metabolism products were studied in the halothane anaesthetized rat by in vivo microdialysis. CCK-8 (10 microM), administrated via a microdialysis probe, produced a significant increase in the levels of aspartate, glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), but not of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), lactate and pyruvate, which were simultaneously monitored. The increase in aspartate and glutamate levels produced by CCK-8 was about 3-4-fold. The effect of CCK-8 on aspartate levels was significantly inhibited by the CCKB antagonist, L-365,260 (20 mg kg-1, s.c.), but not by the CCKA antagonist, L-364,718 (20 mg kg-1, s.c.). In contrast, the increase in glutamate levels was inhibited by both L-365,260 and L-364,718. GABA was slightly, but significantly increased (approximately 30%), by local CCK-8 and was inhibited by both CCK antagonists. The present results show that CCK-8 exerts a strong modulatory action on both aspartate and glutamate release in rat cortex. While the effect of CCK-8 on aspartate is selectively mediated via CCKB receptor subtype, the effect of CCK-8 on glutamate appears to be mediated via both CCKA and CCKB receptor subtypes.", 
    "50": "A series of 4,5-dihydro-3-[2-(methanesulfonamidophenyl)ethyl]-1-phenyl- 1H-2,4-benzodiazepines has been identified as potential antiarrhythmic agents that interact at the delayed rectifier myocardial potassium channels (IKr) and prolong the ventricular effective refractory period (ERP) in rabbit isolated Langendorff heart preparations. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies based upon prolongation of ERP indicate that placement of the sulfonamido group is important for potent activity in this model. Furthermore, methanesulfonamido has enhanced activity over its ethyl or trifluoromethyl analogs. Slightly greater activity was observed in compounds that had a heteroatom in the ethyl bridge that connects the methanesulfonamidophenyl to the benzodiazepine. Further incremental improvements in activity were noted when the 1-phenyl ring was substituted with a variety of substituents. Chirality of the compounds of interest in this series does not appear to influence activity in this model. Several of these compounds were chosen for advanced evaluation, and all possess high selectivity for blockade of potassium current in hearts relative to other ion channels. In addition, these compounds prolong cardiac refractoriness in dogs following oral dosing. Thus, these agents may represent potential new class III agents, but with the potential liability of myocardial IKr blockers.",

Diazepam applied in a concentration range of 4.6 x 10(-6) to 5.2 x 10(-5) M decreased both electrical parameters. This response was unaffected by flumazenil indicating that the action of diazepam is not induced through benzodiazepine receptors. Induction of tolerance to diazepam on its observed effects on potential difference and short-circuit current was obtained by the administration of a single dose of the drug in a slow release preparation. Skins tolerant to diazepam were also tolerant to the acute effects of verapamil on both electric parameters. Tolerance to diazepam effects was partly reversed by increasing Ca2+ concentration in the inner bathing solution. The results are consistent with a Ca2+ channel blocking effect of diazepam in the P. thaul skin.", 
    "60": "An alpidem-insensitive benzodiazepine binding site in the rat spinal cord has recently been identified in our laboratory. We report here the binding of 23 1,4-benzodiazepines to this site using [3H]Ro15-4513 (ethyl-8-azido-6-dihydro-5-methyl-4H-imidazo[1,2- a][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) in the presence of 65 microM alpidem (6-chloro-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-N,N- dipropylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-acetamide). This binding site displays a wide affinity for 1,4-benzodiazepines, most of which show much higher affinity for benzodiazepine receptors in various brain regions and transfected cell systems. The highest affinity ligands are: brotizolam (1-bromo-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-9-methyl-6H-thieno[3,2- f][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]diazepine) (4.3 nM), Ro15-4513 (5.0 nM), Ro42-8773 (7-chloro-3-[3-(cyclopropylmethoxy)-1-propynyl]-4,5-dihydro- 5-methyl-6H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one) (5.7 nM), Ro16-6028 (t-butyl (s)-8-bromo-11,12,13,13a-tetrahydro-9-oxo-9H- imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine-1-carboxylate) (5.9 nM) and triazolam (8-chloro-6-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H- [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepine) (7.9 nM). The structural feature common to these compounds is an imidazo- or triazolo-ring on the 1- and 2-position of the benzodiazepine. However, the presence of this feature does not guarantee high affinity binding as Ro15-1788 (8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5- a][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester) (100 nM) and Ro23-0364 (6-[2-chlorophenyl]-4H- imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxamide) (360 nM) display much lower affinity for this site.

    "62": "Recent experiments have shown that: 1) A chronic 10 month daily administration to rats of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor antagonist, flumazenil (FL; 4 mg/kg in drinking water), from the age of 13 through 22 months, significantly retarded the age-related loss of cognitive functions, as ascertained by the radial arm maze tests conducted two months after FL withdrawal. 2) An equal number of 8 rats died in the control and FL-treated group before the behavioral tests were completed and the animals were sacrificed; the life span of the FL-treated 8 rats equaled 24.0 (+/- 0.6 SEM) months, while that of the control 8 rats equaled 22.3 months (+/- 0.7 SEM), and the group difference was marginally significant (p = 0.04 Mann-Whitney test). 3) In rats sacrificed 3 months after FL withdrawal and behavioral testing, the protective action of FL, relative to age-matched controls, was revealed by a significant reduction in the age-related loss of neurons in the hippocampal formation. 4) In the time period of 3 months between the drug withdrawal and sacrificing of the animals, stress experienced by the aging rats during behavioral testing, related to excessive daily handling of the animals and partial food deprivation to motivate them to perform in the radial arm maze, apparently had excitotoxic effects on the hippocampal neurons, as indexed by the presence of 30% neurons in a state of moderate pyknosis found both in the FL group and the age-matched controls. In the 6 months \"young\" control group, the number of pyknotic neurons equaled only 3.5%. It was concluded that the drug withdrawal and stress of behavioral testing unleashed the previously FL-controlled age-related degeneration. On the basis of these results and the literature, showing that the tone of the GABAergic system increases with age, and particularly in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the hypothesis of brain aging was formulated. It postulates that in mammals, with growing age, and prematurely in humans with AD, the increasing tone of the BDZ/GABAergic system interferes with antero- and retrograde axonal transport through a chronic depolarizing block of preterminal axon varicosities of the ascending aminergic and cholinergic/peptidergic systems, which are indispensable for normal metabolic/trophic glial-neuronal relationships. Such a state leads to discrete anatomic deafferentation of forebrain systems, and particularly of the neocortex, where block of the anterograde axonal transport results in induction of the cortical mRNA responsible for synthesis of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta APP). The simultaneous block of retrograde transport from chronically depolarized preterminal axon varicosities may account for toxic accumulation in cortex of the nerve growth factor (NGF) and other trophins, without which the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons degenerate. The general pharmacologic profile of FL has been discussed on the basis of FL administration to animals and healthy and diseased humans. This profile shows that FL: 1) increases brain metabolic functions; 2) reduces emotional responses, thereby stabilizing the functions of the autonomic system in both humans and animals challenged by adverse environmental stimuli; 3) improves cognitive and coordinated motor functions in both humans and animals; 4) uniquely combines anxiolytic, vigilance and cognitive enhancing, i.e. nootropic, properties, which may, in part, stem from FL-induced emotional imperturbability (ataraxy); 5) facilitates habituation of healthy humans and animals to novel but inconsequential environmental stimuli, and promotes non-aggressive interactions among animals; 6) in single i.v. doses, and administered chronically to humans, FL has antiepileptic actions in the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and other forms of epilepsy characterized by \"spike-and-dome\" EEG patterns; these actions are likely to depend on FL's disinhibition of the serotonin system; 7) administered in single i.v...",

Results show similar efficacy for lorazepam and buspirone during the active phase with a higher significant difference for buspirone on the CHESS 84 in relation with neurovegetatives symptoms: lorazepam D0 :16.30 +/- 3.14 D56: 5.10 +/- 0.93 (p < or = 0.01) buspirone D0 :18.82 +/- 3.4 D56: 4.73 +/- 1.18 (p < or = 0.001) No withdrawal phenomena was observed for both drugs using HAM-A lorazepam D63 :12.59 +/- 2.26 D70: 12.0 +/- 1.75 (p = ns) buspirone D63 :10.05 +/- 1.28 D70: 10.32 +/- 1.82 (p = ns) and the same significant difference using Lader scale: lorazepam D63 :4.44 +/- 0.89 D70: 6.96 +/- 1.28 (p < or = 0.05) buspirone D63 :2.95 +/- 0.66 D70: 4.15 +/- 0.92 (p < or = 0.05). 4. This study confirmed that buspirone was as effective as lorazepam at D56 in monitored outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "65": "The determination of imipramine HCl and diazepam in tablets by derivative spectrophotometry is described. The drugs in combined preparations have been quantified using the second-order derivative spectra of their solutions in 0.1 M HCl. The method has been applied to pure drug mixtures as well as commercial preparations and was found to be precise and reproducible. Compliance of Beer's Law was observed in the concentration range of 10-70 micrograms ml-1 for imipramine HCl and 2-8 micrograms ml-1 for diazepam. Lower limits of detection at the 95% confidence level were 1.96 micrograms ml-1 for imipramine HCl and 0.21 microgram ml-1 for diazepam.",

Criteria for patient selection for the local anaesthetic procedure included healthy young individuals, solitary hand injury, ability to understand the procedure and a stable emotional makeup. A combination of 10 ml of lidocaine 1% and 10 ml of bupivacaine 0.5% was used for volar metacarpal block and a dorsal ring block to the base of the digit. The patient was simultaneously sedated with 10 mg diazepam intramuscularly. Standard intraoperative monitoring of blood pressure, continuous electrocardiogram and pulse oximeter were carried out. The average duration of surgery was 3 hours. There was complete pain relief intraoperatively and good postoperative sensory block for an additional 7 to 15 hours. The technical execution of microsurgery was not compromised. All replantations were successful with no complication encountered from the use of local anaesthesia.",

In short term open clinical trial design nitroxazepine (25 mg PO, HS) has been found to be superior and better tolerated than diazepam (5 mg PO, HS). In open clinical trial design, nitroxazepine (25 mg PO, HS) reduced the diastolic blood pressure to the target level (100 mm Hg and less) effectively controlling the uncontrolled hypertensive patients receiving maintenance dose of beta blockers. There was no such beneficial effect in patients receiving maintenance doses of other antihypertensive drugs (pilot study). Adverse drug reactions like disturbed sleep in one, uneasiness in 3, palpitation in one and dryness of mouth in one patient have been observed.",

Results showed impaired psychomotor performance persisting upto 4-5 h when the aforementioned agents given singly were tested on simple reaction time (SRT), multiple choice reaction time (MCRT) and critical flicker fusion frequency (CFFF) tasks. Digit cancellation task (DCT) was similarly affected by diazepam and alcohol only. No summation of adverse effects on psychomotor performance was noted when a combination of diazepam and alcohol, diazepam-propranol or alcohol plus propranolol were tested on SRT and MCRT. An additive impairment of CFFF was observed with alcohol - propranolol combination only. No summation of pharmacodynamic effects on DCT were noted when different combinations were used.",

The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of remacemide hydrochloride [(+/-)-2-amino-N-(1-methyl-1,2,-diphenylethyl)acetamide monohydrochloride] and FPL 15896AR [(+)-alpha-phenyl-2-pyridine-ethanamide] to a number of anticonvulsant agents on an operant acquisition baseline. Remacemide hydrochloride is currently in clinical trials for epilepsy and FPL 15896AR is under development. In the present procedure, fasted, experimentally naive rats were placed into operant chambers in which food pellets were initially available under a Fixed-Ratio 1 (FR1) schedule of food presentation, and as lever pressing progressed, the FR value incremented. All drugs were tested in multiples of three and ten times their respective ED50 values against maximal electroshock-induced seizure (MES) following p.o. administration. The drugs tested varied widely in their ability to disrupt acquisition of the lever-pressing task. Remacemide hydrochloride and a structurally related analog, FPL 15896AR, did not disrupt acquisition. Clonazepam, lamotrigine, MK-801, phenobarbital, felbamate, phenytoin, and carbamazepine increased the number of hours required to achieve FR3 (emit more than 100 responses) with respect to vehicle control performance. Of these, clonazepam, MK-801 and phenytoin produced robust enough disruption to result in significantly fewer reinforcers delivered over the 14-h operant session.",

The anxiolytic-like effects of the benzodiazepines, diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, were confirmed, and the involvement of serotonergic mechanisms was studied in this animal model of anxiety. The partial 5-HT1A receptor agonists, buspirone and ipsapirone showed anxiolytic-like effects in a limited dose interval. The full agonist hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetraline (8-OH-DPAT) was inactive. The non-selective 5-HT1 receptor agonist, eltoprazine, induced marked increases of exploratory behaviour in the white compartment over a broad range of doses. Also pindolol a mixed 5-HT1A/1B and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist showed anxiolytic-like effects, whereas another compound with a similar profile (-)-, penbutolol and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551, was inactive. The 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist, ritanserin, showed anxiogenic-like, and the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, zacopride and ondansetron, showed anixiolytic-like effects. An overall increase of serotonergic activity by means of 5-HT uptake inhibition (citalopram), 5-HT release (fenfluramine) or administration of a 5-HT precursor (1-5-HTP) facilitated exploratory activity in the white compartment. Reduction of serotonergic activity by treatment with the 5-HT depletor p-chloro-phenylalanine methyl ester (PCPA) did not change the exploratory behaviour, but attenuated the response to fenfluramine significantly.", 
    "71": "Each one of the three kinds of anesthesia (spinal, epidural, general) has its advantages and disadvantages. A new concept of combined spinal-epidural-general anesthesia (CSEGA) is illustrated with the objective of producing a new kind of anesthesia. The aim is to draw out the good from each compartment. CSEGA can be based on muscle relaxation and anesthesia on its spinal part with the epidural augmentation. The endotracheal intubation can be kept in place with a very small dose of an inhalational anesthetic. There is no need for muscle relaxant drugs, i.v. opioids or benzodiazepines, for postoperative analgesia serves the epidural catheter. Very small doses of local anesthetic drugs injected into the spinal or epidural compartments, could be all that is needed for operations on any part of the body, including thorax and head. CSEGA is a new concept in anesthesia. The mixing of regional anesthesia with general anesthesia affords the anesthesiologist the opportunity to lower the local anesthetic doses, avoid using many kinds of intravenous drugs (muscle relaxants, opioids, benzodiazepines, etc.) and to approach a kind of anesthesia that is closer to the ideal.",

    "74": "Three severely agitated patients in ICU did not respond to conventional therapy with opiates, benzodiazepines, and intermittent intravenous doses of haloperidol. In each case, control was achieved rapidly after initiation and titration of a continuous haloperidol infusion. Two patients had a history of schizophrenia. No adverse effects attributable to therapy were identified.", 
    "75": "Haloperidol is often used in the ICU for control of severe agitation, even in patients without a psychiatric history. It usually is given by bolus intravenous injection, sometimes in high doses (> 5 mg), even though that is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Intravenous haloperidol is generally well tolerated, but multiform ventricular tachycardia has been reported. Experience with continuous haloperidol infusions is growing, and it appears to be an effective method for control of severe agitation or delirium. In our experience and in other limited published data, adverse effects are rare, but prolongation of the QT interval has occurred and multiform ventricular tachycardia is likely a risk.",

    "77": "The mechanism regulating cholecystokinin (CCK) secretion during prolonged diversion of bile pancreatic juice (BPJ) is unknown. We examined the hypothesis that the decrease of plasma CCK levels after prolonged diversion of BPJ is mediated by an increase in plasma somatostatin levels evoked by hypercholecystokinemia and somatostatin in turn inhibits CCK-releasing peptide (CCK-RP) bioactivity and decreases plasma CCK levels.", 
    "78": "Pancreatic secretion, plasma CCK levels, and somatostatin levels were monitored for 7 hours after diversion of BPJ in anesthetized rats. Secretion of CCK-RP bioactivity during diversion of BPJ was examined in the presence or absence of somatostatin.",

At 5 hours after diversion of BPJ, plasma CCK and somatostatin levels and luminal CCK-RP bioactivity decreased to basal levels. The decrease in plasma CCK levels was prevented by the administration of a specific somatostatin antagonist. We also showed that the stimulatory effect of the CCK-RP bioactivity was eliminated when the donor rat was pretreated with somatostatin.",

High-potency agents were used 2.4 times more frequently than low-potency drugs; 13% received clozapine. The mean chlorpromazine-equivalent daily dose, corrected for as-needed supplements, was 305 mg; peak doses were 32% higher. Doses of the most potent agents (fluphenazine and haloperidol) were only 22%-33% above the overall mean. Rarely were two neuroleptics given simultaneously, but cotreatment with an anticonvulsant (84% of patients, 92% of whom received valproate), a potent benzodiazepine (81%), lithium (70%), one CNS depressant (84%), or more (45%) was common. Doses averaged 20% higher for men, 42% lower at age > 50 years versus 20-30 years, and 53% greater for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder versus other conditions. Comparison with 1989 admissions (N = 50) averaging 73 days indicated few differences in use of neuroleptics or benzodiazepines but less frequent use of anticonvulsants and lithium.",

Following intravenous injection of 111 MBq [123I]iomazenil, serial dynamic SPECT scanning was performed for 120 min and the concentration of lipophilic compounds in the arterial plasma was determined by chloroform extraction. Kinetic parameters were estimated by a curve-fitting procedure using the following four models: three-compartment, four-parameter (K1-k4) (3C4P), three-compartment, three-parameter (fixed K1/k2) (3C3P), three-compartment, two-parameter (fixed K1/k2 and k4) (3C2P) and two-compartment, two-parameter (K1 and k2) (2C2P).

    "87": "In all models, the curve-fitting procedure gave similar outcomes for ligand transport (K1) and receptor density parameters (i.e., binding potential or distribution volume). The 3C4P parameters showed significant correlation between k2 and k3, while 3C3P did not show such a correlation, suggesting the stability of 3C3P. The 3C2P provided parameters essentially identical to those with the 3C3P, indicating the suitability of this model, while 2C2P gave similar distribution volume but obviously low K1.",

    "90": "Colonic infusion of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) is trophic to rat jejunum and is associated with raised jejunal gastrin concentration. This study examined the hypothesis that the jejunal trophic effects of colonic SCFAs are mediated in part by gastrin. Forty six adult rats underwent caecectomy to reduce endogenous production of SCFA, ileocolonic anastomosis, and placement of a colonic infusion catheter. SCFA (70 mM acetate, 35 mM propionate, 20 mM butyrate) or saline were continuously infused into the colon for seven days. Rats received either a gastrin receptor blocker (L-365,260) or a control solution and animals were killed on day 8. SCFA infused into the colon acted systemically to significantly improve jejunal structure and increase jejunal gastrin concentrations. Gastrin receptor blockade abolished effects of SCFA on jejunal DNA, protein, crypt cell proliferation, and gastrin. Gastrin blockade did not reduce SCFA induced augmentation of villous height or crypt depth. It is concluded that the jejunal trophic effects of colonically infused SCFA are mediated in part by gastrin.",

We have examined the effects of thiopentone, etomidate, ketamine and flunitrazepam on phagocytosis and killing of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli by PMNL in vitro with fluorescence microscopy. All anaesthetic agents significantly inhibited both phagocytosis and bactericidal activity. The additives in the commercial preparations may have contributed to the suppression.", 
    "92": "The effect of cholecystokinin (CCK) on the pancreas was investigated in the pig in two experiments. Fifteen pigs were fed a diet containing 17 or 48% protein with or without MK329 (4.5 mg per meal). MK329 enhanced the postprandial peak of plasma CCK during the first 30 min, but pancreas adaptation to high protein was not affected. Sixteen pigs were divided into two groups: 12 pigs were infused with CCK-8 + secretin for 1 h and four pigs received a standard meal. In both groups, pancreatic secretion tests were performed under infusion of the vehicle alone or with MK329. After CCK + secretin, MK329 (65-500 micrograms/kg/h) did not alter CCK plasma levels and reduced the early pancreatic protein response by about 30%. Enzyme outputs in pancreatic juice were modestly affected by MK329. After the meal, MK329 (500 micrograms/kg/h) doubled the postprandial peak of plasma CCK and lowered the pancreatic protein output by 35-40% for the first 30 min. We suggest that (a) pancreatic adaptation to high dietary protein is not mediated via CCK-A receptors and (b) the stimulation of pancreatic protein secretion by a meal or by exogenous CCK-8 is mediated partly by CCK-A receptors.", 
    "93": "The product licences for triazolam in Britain were suspended in October 1991. We aimed to determine whether the sudden withdrawal of a benzodiazepine from the market constitutes a major impetus for patients to reduce or stop their benzodiazepine consumption. Patients in 10 London general practices who were prescribed triazolam in the 12 months prior to the withdrawal of its licence were interviewed. Data from written and computerized general practice records were also studied. One hundred and forty-seven patients were identified, of whom 107 (73%) were interviewed; 38 were chronic users; 68 patients had a history of serious physical illness while 33 had a history of psychiatric problems; 45% of chronic and 66% of intermittent triazolam users had stopped receiving prescriptions for benzodiazepines from 6 months after the withdrawal of triazolam's licence up to 18 months later. Only 12 (11%) recalled suffering significant withdrawal effects. We conclude that official action to curb prescribing of a benzodiazepine acts as an important stimulus for patients to reduce or stop their use of all psychotropic medication without increasing psychological morbidity or leading to unacceptable side effects.", 
    "94": "beta-Carbolines, such as methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM), attach to the benzodiazepine receptors in the brain, but have effects completely opposite to those of benzodiazepines: beta-CCM is a convulsant at high doses, an anxiogenic at moderate doses, and enhances learning at low doses. The aim of this work was to detect some of the chromosomal segments involved in the regulation of beta-CCM-induced seizures. The method used was a derivation of the classical use of linkage-testing strains. We tested several strains and some of their intercrosses and back-crosses. For two of these strains, we obtained significant results showing that genes located on chromosomes 4 and 13, provisionally termed respectively Bis1 and Bis2, were involved in the regulation of beta-carboline-induced seizures. Testing of these two strains with two other convulsant agents (pentylenetetrazol, which acts at the picrotoxine site of the GABA receptor complex, and strychnine, which acts at the glycinergic receptor) provided evidence that the genes implicated are not involved in general seizure processes but specifically in beta-CCM-induced seizures.",

    "97": "The corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation test has become established as a powerful tool in differentiating the source of ACTH in patients with Cushing's syndrome. Psychiatric symptoms are common in patients with Cushing's syndrome, and many patients with psychiatric illnesses may show disturbances of function of the pituitary-adrenal axis; both of these groups of patients may be receiving benzodiazepine drugs when presenting for evaluation of their possible endocrine problems. Both animal and human studies suggest that interactions occur between benzodiazepines and the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. We have therefore evaluated the effects of a benzodiazepine drug on the pituitary-adrenal response to CRH.",

We believe that inhibition of endogenous AVP by temazepam is the most likely explanation for our findings in healthy volunteers: the hypercortisolaemia in Cushing's syndrome suppresses the release of both endogenous CRH and AVP in portal blood which then results in abolition of the temazepam induced reduction in the pituitary-adrenal response to exogenous CRH, as seen in our patients. These effects of benzodiazepines should clearly be taken into account in patients using these compounds while undergoing endocrine assessment.",

Subjects were eight white and seven Chinese men who were extensive metabolizers of debrisoquin and mephenytoin. The subjects received, in a randomized order, omeprazole, 40 mg/day, and placebo for 21 days, followed by a 10 mg oral dose of diazepam. Diazepam and desmethyldiazepam plasma concentrations were determined by HPLC during a 26-day period after diazepam administration.",

In contrast, diazepam oral clearance decreased by only 20.7% +/- 7.3% and desmethyldiazepam AUC decreased by 25.4% +/- 4.6% in the Chinese group. The decrease in diazepam clearance and the prolongation in diazepam and desmethyldiazepam elimination half-lives after administration of omeprazole were significantly greater in the white group than in the Chinese group (p < 0.03, p < 0.001, and p < 0.004, respectively). In the absence of omeprazole, diazepam oral clearance was marginally greater (mean +/- SEM) (34.4 +/- 2.8 ml/min versus 25.2 +/- 3.5 ml/min, p = 0.057, respectively) and the AUC of desmethyldiazepam was significantly lower (8794 +/- 538 micrograms/L.hr versus 16,358 +/- 2985 mg/L.hr, p = 0.04, respectively) in the white subjects compared with the Chinese subjects.",

The Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) was used as a measure of drug effect. Subjects performed three practice tests before dosing to account for any effects caused by familiarization (\"learning curve\") with the testing procedure. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data were simultaneously fitted to a semiparametric model. In this model, a pharmacokinetic model related dose to plasma concentrations, a link model related plasma concentrations to the concentration at the effect site, and a pharmacodynamic model related the effect site concentration to the observed effect. The plasma-effect site equilibrium half-life was approximately 2 1/2 times longer for midazolam than for diazepam, which is in good agreement with previously published data. Based on the estimated effect site concentration at which half of the maximal effect was reached, midazolam had approximately a sixfold greater intrinsic potency than diazepam. This difference in potency was also observed in a previous study that used transformed electroencephalographic (EEG) data to assess pharmacodynamic activity. The findings reported here with a clinically relevant pharmacodynamic marker (DSST) confirm the utility of surrogate drug effect measures such as EEG. This work also shows the feasibility of conducting pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic analysis during the drug development process.",

    "108": "In comparison to water, pretreatment with grapefruit juice did not change the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of intravenous midazolam. After oral administration, pretreatment with grapefruit juice led to a 56% increase in peak plasma concentration (Cmax), a 79% increase in time to reach Cmax (tmax), and a 52% increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of midazolam, which was associated with an increase in the bioavailability from 24% +/- 3% (water) to 35% +/- 3% (Grapefruit juice; mean +/- SEM, p < 0.01) After oral administration of midazolam, pretreatment with grapefruit juice was associated with a 105% increase in tmax and with a 30% increase in the AUC of alpha-hydroxymidazolam. For oral midazolam, pretreatment with grapefruit juice led to significant increases in tmax for all dynamic parameters and in the AUC values for the reaction time and DSST, whereas the maximal dynamic effects remained unchanged.",

    "110": "In mammalian brain the expression of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) can be markedly induced following different types of neuronal injury. PBRs are believed to be expressed on non-neuronal cells in the brain, yet the specific cell type that expresses these receptors following CNS insult has not been defined. In the present study, we investigated the effects of transient global forebrain ischemia on PBRs by autoradiographic localization of 3H-PK11195 binding. The distribution of PBRs was compared to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as a marker for astrocytes and OX42 as a marker for microglia. Five to 6 d following four-vessel occlusion (4-VO), an increase in PBRs was seen in the CA1 region of all 15 brains examined. In brains from rats subjected to 4-VO, microglia were selectively activated in stratum pyramidale of the CA1 layer. In contrast, astrocytes appeared to be activated in multiple hippocampal cell layers including stratum radiatum and stratum oriens. Activated astrocytes were also found in regions that did not exhibit increased 3H-PK11195 binding. In some brains, selected regions of secondary lesion, specifically necrotic thalamic nuclei and the isocortex were found to be strongly immunoreactive for OX42 but lacked GFAP immunoreactive cells. In adjacent sections, these same regions displayed high densities of 3H-PK1195 binding. These observations lend further support to the application of 3H-PK11195 binding as a marker of neuronal injury in the brain. Furthermore, the data strongly suggest that activated microglia rather than astrocytes express PBRs following ischemic insults.", 
    "111": "In this study, we examined the effect of the central-type benzodiazepine agonist, clonazepam, and the indoleamine hormone, melatonin, on central dopaminergic function using the 6-hydroxydopamine model of dopamine receptor supersensitivity. Unilateral lesioning of the nigrostriatal pathway with 6-hydroxydopamine was carried out in Sprague-Dawley rats. Two weeks after surgery, the animals were examined for the presence of dopaminergic supersensitivity by their response to the dopamine receptor agonist, apomorphine. Clonazepam, melatonin and its analogs, 6-chloromelatonin and 2-iodomelatonin, significantly inhibited apomorphine-induced turning behavior (P < .01). Pretreatment with a central-type benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, significantly reduced the effect of melatonin and clonazepam (P < .01). The peripheral-type benzodiazepine antagonist, PK 11195, caused some attenuation of melatonin's effect (P < .05), but it was significantly less potent than flumazenil. Bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist, was also found to reduce the inhibitory effect of melatonin on the induced rotational response (P < .01). These results indicate that the antidopaminergic effect of clonazepam and melatonin is mediated predominantly by central-type benzodiazepine receptors in the central nervous system, via a GABAergic mechanism.",

Inasmuch as AF-DX 384 has a higher affinity for m2 than m4 receptors and pirenzepine (PZ) has a reverse affinity profile, competition between these ligands was used to label m2 receptors in homogenized and sectioned tissue. Rabbit cingulate cortex was used because m2 receptors are expressed by anterior thalamic axons in posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and this region is easily deafferented with undercut lesions to demonstrate presynaptic binding. Saturation isotherms and Scatchard analysis of [3H]AF-DX 384 binding showed one binding site with a KD of 9 +/- 2.3 nM (mean +/- SEM) and a Bmax of 1405 +/- 146 fmol/mg protein. Competition studies with [3H]AF-DX 384 (2 nM) and 10(-10)-10(-4) M PZ were performed in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and PCC. In both regions, the best fit was a two site model for low (BL) and high (BH) affinity binding in which Bmax values were similar (ACC: BL = 535 +/- 62 fmol/mg, BH = 676 +/- 85; PCC: BL = 552 +/- 41; BH = 675 +/- 85). Although affinities for KH were similar in each region (ACC: KH = 4.69 +/- 1.36 nM; PCC: KH = 8.53 +/- 3.69 nM), those for KL were significantly different (ACC: 181 +/- 15.4 nM; PCC: 285 +/- 42; P = .018). Binding of [3H]AF-DX 384 with PZ (150 nM) was best fit with a single site model (KD = 6 +/- 0.01 nM; Bmax = 688 +/- 31 fmol/mg), suggesting that PZ blocks the lower affinity site.

    "113": "The effect of AHN 086 [1-(2-isothiocyanatoethyl)-7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-5-(4- chloro-phenyl)-2H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2-one hydrochloride], an irreversible ligand of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor, was studied in the heat shock protein (HSP) expression and the activation of dog neutrophils. At micromolar concentrations, AHN 086 induced a dose-dependent increase in free radical production (309 +/- 13% at 1 x 10(-5) M). This compound also increased the phagocytic activity (73 +/- 3.5% at 5 x 10(-6) M). Immunohistochemical results showed that AHN 086 induced the expression of HSP in neutrophil membranes. At 1 x 10(-5) M, the percentage of positive cells was: 90.2 (27 kD), 90.6 (72 kD) and 92.8 (90 kD). This expression was accompanied by a decrease in the presence of nuclear and cytoplasmic HSP. Flow cytometry studies showed that this cell membrane expression was located on the neutrophil surface and could be a consequence of HSP mobilization from nucleus and cytoplasm.", 
    "114": "Mice were exposed to lorazepam (4 mg/kg) or vehicle by continuous infusion by implanted (s.c.) osmotic minipumps that were removed after 7 days. Dose-response curves for stimulation of phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis by the selective metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist, (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane dicarboxylic acid [(1S,3R)-ACPD] were performed with cortical slices from mice treated with lorazepam or vehicle for 7 days and subject to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 days of withdrawal. The efficacy of (1S,3R)-ACPD to stimulate PI hydrolysis was increased significantly at 2 and 3 days of lorazepam withdrawal when compared with responses in control slices. The effect was blocked by the mGluR antagonist, L-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionate (L-AP3). Enhancement of PI hydrolysis in cortical slices from mice at 2 days of discontinuation from 7 days exposure to lorazepam was also observed with agonists of alpha 1 adrenergic and histamine receptors, but not with agonists of muscarinic or serotonin receptors when compared with responses in control slices. Intracerebroventricular infusion of L-AP3 significantly increased pentylenetetrazol-seizure threshold in mice withdrawn for 2 days from 7 days of exposure to lorazepam, but showed no effect in comparable vehicle-exposed mice. These data suggest that PI-coupled mGluRs may be implicated in regulation of GABAergic functionality as observed after withdrawal from prolonged exposure to lorazepam.", 
    "115": "The pathologic feature of acute interstitial nephritis is the infiltration of mononuclear cells, predominantly lymphocytes and monocytes, into the interstitium. We present an unusual case of a 49-year-old man with drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis whose renal biopsy specimen showed a massive infiltration of eosinophils into the interstitium and eosinophils infiltrating into the glomerulus through a gap in Bowman's capsule and the juxtaglomerular zone. The patient initially was referred to us with a recurrence of the nephrotic syndrome. Deterioration of renal function and an increase in proteinuria was noted at that time. Triazolam, a sleep inducer, was the suspected cause of the acute interstitial nephritis. Renal biopsy revealed sclerotic glomeruli containing eosinophils among massive infiltrated eosinophils and a loss of endothelial cells and mesangial cells in contrast to a preservation of epithelial cells. Infiltrating eosinophils were directly attached to the glomerular basement membrane, and free granules from the eosinophils were observed in the capillary lumen. In addition to chronic sclerotic change, eosinophils may have further damaged the glomerular capillary wall, leading to an increased severity of proteinuria in this case.", 
    "116": "Attenuated cholinergic vasodilatation has been suggested as an endothelium-related mechanism involved in essential hypertension. We investigated the role of muscarinic (M) receptor subtypes in the forearm resistance vasculature. In eight white men with essential hypertension and eight matched normotensive control subjects (age of both groups, 47 +/- 4 years; mean +/- SEM), we infused the nonselective agonist methacholine in the presence of saline and the antagonists atropine (nonselective), pirenzepine (M1-selective), and AF-DX 116 (M2-selective) into the brachial artery and measured forearm blood flow and forearm vascular resistance using venous occlusion plethysmography. Affinity constants (pKb values) were determined from calculated plasma concentrations of the infused compounds and EC50 values. Sodium nitroprusside was given as an endothelium-independent control, and minimal forearm vascular resistance after 10 minutes of ischemia was used as a marker of structural vascular changes. Hypertensive patients showed higher minimal forearm vascular resistance, indicating structural vascular changes. However, sodium nitro-prusside- and methacholine-induced vasodilatation was similar in both groups, with apparent EC50 values (log moles per liter; mean +/- SEM) of -7.32 +/- 0.13 and -7.51 +/- 0.21 in hypertensive patients and -7.37 +/- 0.13 and -7.45 +/- 0.02 in control subjects, respectively. Atropine, pirenzepine, and AF-DX 116 caused a shift to the right of the concentration-response curve of methacholine, with apparent pKb values of 8.63 +/- 0.08, 6.81 +/- 0.13, and 5.51 +/- 0.29 in hypertensive individuals and 8.62 +/- 0.10, 6.98 +/- 0.08, and 5.49 +/- 0.09 in control subjects, respectively.

    "126": "Impaired gallbladder emptying is frequent in cholesterol gallstone disease as well as in predisposing conditions like pregnancy and obesity. Gallbladder hypomotility is considered a pathogenic factor for gallstone formation, providing the residence time for cholesterol crystal nucleation, but any effect on the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and subsequently on biliary lipid composition is unknown. Therefore, we studied the effect of prolonged suppression of gallbladder emptying with a cholecystokinin (CCK-A) receptor antagonist on bile formation in Richardson ground squirrels fed a trace versus a 1% cholesterol diet. Biliary lipid secretion was measured directly and bile acid pool size assessed by isotope dilution ([14C]-cholic acid). Gallbladder contraction was determined in vitro in response to CCK. The CCK-antagonist (MK-329) greatly inhibited gallbladder contraction in vitro and increased gallbladder fasting volume and bile acid pool size in vivo. It significantly lowered the cholesterol saturation index by 35% and 46% in hepatic bile and by 18% and 28% in gallbladder bile in the trace and cholesterol diet groups, respectively. Bile acid secretion and bile flow doubled with the CCK-receptor antagonist. Chronic CCK receptor antagonist-induced inhibition of gallbladder emptying increases bile acid secretion and thereby decreases cholesterol saturation in bile. Extensive biliary hypomotility thus leads to a more rapid cycling of bile acids by depriving the gallbladder of its function in the enterohepatic circulation.", 
    "127": "The performance of the Microgenics CEDIA DAU assays for screening amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, opiates, phencylidine (PCP), and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) was evaluated on the Boehringer Mannheim/Hitachi 717 in urine. Limits of detection ranged from 0.6 ng/mL for PCP, to 34.1 ng/mL for benzodiazepines. The average within run and total precision for these assays ranged from 1.3 to 7.3% for controls at cutoff concentrations, and control values at -25% and +25% of cutoffs. The rate separations by CEDIA between the negative and cutoff calibrators for all drugs were greater than corresponding EMIT II (Syva Co.) assays. The relative sensitivity and specificity of CEDIA as compared to EMIT II were 95.6 and 98.8%, respectively, on 13,535 urine samples. All positive samples, and those samples producing discordant results between the assays were confirmed by quantitative gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Using SAMHSA cutoff limits (and including barbiturates and benzodiazepines at 300 ng/mL), the relative sensitivity and specificity of CEDIA vs. EMIT II were 96.7 and 98.8%, respectively. The overall sensitivity of CEDIA vs. GC/MS was 98.9% with 179 false positives, as compared to 96.2% with 189 false positives for EMIT II vs. GC/MS. The effect of adulterants added to urine to potentially invalidate screening results was also tested. CEDIA produced strong interferences for most drug assays in the presence of glutaraldehyde, detergent, and high concentrations of bleach and Drano. Minimal or selective interferences were seen with golden seal tea lemon juice, Visine, and low concentrations of bleach and Drano. Essentially no interference was observed with bicarbonate, sodium chloride, and vinegar.", 
    "128": "Dementia is a relatively common syndrome seen in the elderly emergency department population. The emergency physician usually sees demented patients secondary to behavioral complications. Diagnosing the syndrome of dementia principally consists of ruling out treatable causes, which can be performed either in an in-patient or out-patient location. The emergency presentations of dementia include disturbances of activity, aggression, and psychosis. Complications that are primarily treated non-pharmacologically include circadian rhythm disturbance, catastrophic reaction (excessive emotional response), and wandering, as well as some mild verbal outbursts and delusions. Pharmacologic interventions are usually necessary for agitation, physical attacks, and significant delusions or hallucinations. Neuroleptic medication is the principal pharmacologic class with which to treat these symptoms, although benzodiazepines are also effective.",

Up to concentration of 100 microM, triethyllead did not affect significantly the specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding but attenuated marginally (14-18%) the GABAA receptor agonist, muscimol-induced elevation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding in cerebellar tissue. After the subacute treatment of rats with triethyllead, the specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding was 27% lower in cerebellum compared to control animals. In other brain regions the receptor binding was not changed. The data suggest that triethyllead modified the cerebellar GABAA receptor complex causing decreased binding in the benzodiazepine site. Such an inhibitory effect in the GABAA receptor complex may decrease cerebellar inhibitory output and augment the triethyllead induced convulsions and tremor."
