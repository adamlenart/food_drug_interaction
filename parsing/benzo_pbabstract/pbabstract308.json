    "0": "The 24 h profiles of hormonal secretions represent a good model for the study of the human circadian system. Diurnal hormonal variations generally reflect the modulation of ultradian or pulsatile release at 1-2 h intervals by signals occurring at nearly 24 h periods and result from the interaction of an internal timekeeping system--or circadian clock--with the sleep-wake homeostasis and various environmental factors, including the light-dark cycle, periodic changes in activity levels and the meal schedule. This temporal organization is altered in many pathophysiological conditions, including ageing, sleep loss, night or shift work, jet lag, affective disorders and endocrine diseases. Both photic and non-photic stimuli may affect the regulation of the circadian pacemaker and, therefore, the diurnal pattern of hormonal secretions. Appropriately timed stimuli may induce either a phase-advance or a phase-delay of the circadian clock, according to the timing of administration. Phase-shifting effects have been shown in humans for light and for dark pulses, physical exercise, melatonin and melatonin agonists, and benzodiazepine hypnotics. These results open new perspectives for the treatment of a variety of disorders involving dysregulation of the circadian rhythmicity.", 
    "1": "Substance abuse has been increasing steadily in the UK and some other countries. Recent evidence suggests more than 40% of young people have tried illicit drugs at some time. There are numerous medical consequences to recreational drug use, and a physician should always consider substance abuse in any unexplained illness. The renal complications of drug abuse are also becoming more frequent, and may encompass a spectrum of glomerular, interstitial and vascular diseases. Although some substances are directly nephrotoxic, a number of other mechanisms are also involved. These effects are often chronic and irreversible, but occasionally acute with possible recovery. The rapid growth of illicit drug use is clearly a major public health problem. We review the commonly used substances of abuse and their associations with renal disease.", 
    "2": "Joint dislocations are common presenting complaints in emergency departments (EDs). Dislocations of major joints, such as the shoulder, elbow, and hip, are often difficult to gently reduce because of the challenge in obtaining sufficient relaxation of large muscle groups. This is the first reported use of etomidate to assist in the reduction of a major joint in an outpatient setting. We discuss the case of an elderly woman with total hip arthroplasty who experienced four spontaneous posterior hip dislocations in a 5-month period. Narcotics and benzodiazepines failed to facilitate reduction at every encounter, whereas etomidate made the procedure easy the two times it was used in the ED. This article reviews the administration of etomidate for conscious sedation and discusses potential complications.", 
    "3": "We studied benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) distribution, which is thought to be affected by neuronal density in the cerebral cortex, and CBF using [11C]flumazenil and [15O]water PET in early blind (EB) and in blindfold sighted control (SC) subjects. PET images were co-registered to the subject's MRI. Using SPM96, MRI images were normalized in the Talairach and Tournoux coordinate system, and accordingly MRI-registered PET images were spatially normalized. Statistical parametric maps were computed on a voxel-by-voxel basis, using the general linear model. CBF for EB was significantly larger in the Brodmann area 17 and 18, especially anterior area, than that for SC, while there was no significant difference in BZR distribution. Our BZR data suggest that the amount of neurons do not change due to early visual deprivation in the visual cortex, in spite of high CBF in visual cortex of EB subjects.", 
    "4": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt and aggressive treatment. Prolonged status seizures are associated with significant physiological sequelae and neurological deficits. Although systemic events such as hyperthermia and anoxia contribute to neuronal damage, SE in and of itself can induce cell death. In general, the sooner it is brought under control, the more favourable is the prognosis. Benzodiazepines, as a group, are the most frequently used anticonvulsants in the management of status seizures. Midazolam, a water-soluble benzodiazepine, is a potent anticonvulsant that offers many advantages over typical benzodiazepines. Because of its stability in aqueous media, midazolam dissolves in common diluents such as normal saline or dextrose water. Consequently, midazolam both intravenously (i.v.) and intramuscularly (i.m.) is well tolerated locally and is associated with less venoirritation than benzodiazepines or antiepileptics that require organic solvents. The water solubility of midazolam also allows rapid and reliable absorption of the drug from the i.m. injection site. Because it is rapidly metabolised and its metabolites are pharmacologically inactive, midazolam has a short duration of action. Most patients regain full conscious state and can be evaluated soon after the cessation of treatment. Midazolam by continuous i.v. infusion and by the i.m. route has been successfully used in the treatment of SE. Although some respiratory and haemodynamic side-effects have been associated with midazolam, no clinically significant side-effects were observed with its use for the indication of SE. It is suggested that midazolam is a safe and rapidly effective treatment option in the management of SE in the critical care setting.",

Significantly higher premedication and immobilizing doses were needed for females than for males (P < 0.05). An i.m. preanesthetic xylazine dose of 1.88 +/- 0.37 mg/kg (range = 1.20-2.12 mg/kg) was used for females and 1.22 +/- 0.16 mg/kg (range = 0.82-1.43 mg/kg) for males. After xylazine, the animals were induced with i.m. tiletamine/zolazepam; females received 2.20 +/- 0.47 mg/kg (range = 1.78-3.33 mg/kg) and males received 1.71 +/- 0.34 mg/kg (range = 1.08-2.05 mg/kg). Anesthesia was reversed with yohimbine (0.14 +/- 0.03 mg/kg; range = 0.07-0.20 mg/kg) and flumazenil (1 mg flumazenil/20 mg zolazepam) either i.m. or i.v. This anesthetic combination produced smooth induction, good relaxation, and sufficient immobilization to perform routine diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (venipuncture, hoof and tusk trims, transportation, radiographs, ultrasound examination, weight determinations, and skin biopsies). Supplemental ketamine HCl or isoflurane was administered to two animals to effectively deepen or prolong the anesthetic plane, with no resultant adverse effects.",

The Singapore sample indicated 28% of the subjects on another neuroleptic, with 36% taking an anticholinergic agent and 28% on a benzodiazepine.

One patient received a constant infusion of midazolam for 68 hours and the other patient received a constant infusion of midazolam for 148 hours. In both patients the decline in level was, overall, much slower than expected. The half-lives of the terminal phase were longer than typically published (52.9 hours in Patient 1 and 20.1 hours in Patient 2).

The assays are based on the kinetic interaction of microparticles as measured by changes in light transmission. Drug in a sample inhibits the formation of particle aggregates and diminishes absorbance change increases. It was the goal of this study to evaluate precision and comparability of the new asssys with CEDIA drugs of abuse tests on Hitachi 917 in different laboratories (three European and three US). The assays were calibrated in the nonlinear mode with four to six standards (semiquantitative application). Initial within-run (21 replicates, four labs) and between-day (10 days, two labs) imprecision studies using Abuscreen OnLine tests and commercial negative (0.5 x cut-off) and positive (1.5 x cut-off) controls revealed the following median CVs [withinrun neg./pos. control/between-day neg./pos. control]: amphetamines 1.9/1.3/3.4/2.4, barbiturates 3.0/1.6/3.9/3.1, benzodiazepines 4.7/1.5/6.3/3.0, cocaine metabolite 1.8/0.9/2.4/1.7, methadone 5.4/1.6/5.5/2.2, opiates 5.5/2.8/5.3/2.7, THC 8.9/4.8/21.8/12.1. CVs < 10% were obtained for the THC test using controls with concentrations closer to the cut-off. An identical set of 170 GC/MS analyzed urine samples was distributed to the six laboratories and measured with Abuscreen OnLine tests on Hitachi 917. The median values for each individual sample were calculated and compared with the results obtained on individual Hitachi 917 analyzers by Passing-Bablok regression analysis. A good agreement between the laboratories was found with less than +/- 11% slope deviation and intercepts below 7% of the cut-off except for benzodiazepines (one slope 17%, one slope--26%) and THC (one slope 34%, one slope--18%). The comparability with CEDIA tests was analyzed by concordance plots using randomized routine samples in three laboratories. The following results were obtained in one of the participating laboratories [cut-off ng/mL] (No. of positive/negative/discrepant samples): amphetamines [500] 2/147/0, barbiturates [200] 1/148/0, benzodiazepines [100] 52/91/7, cocaine metabolite [300] 17/129/3, methadone [300] 113/34/2, opiates [300] 31/114/4, THC [50] 66/81/2. GC/MS was performed for clarification of the discrepant results. In summary, Abuscreen OnLine tests on Hitachi 917 give precise results which compare well when analyzed in different laboratories.

    "18": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare, potentially life-threatening disorder that results from the use of neuroleptics. NMS was first recognised as a complication of dopamine receptor antagonists characterized by extrapyramidal disturbances, hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability, mental status changes and elevated serum creatine kinase levels. Concepts of NMS have changed because medications other than classic neuroleptic drugs have been implicated as triggering agents. The incidence of NMS is about 0.2% with a mortality between 4-30%, which may be diminished by treatment. The neurochemical key features in all these conditions probably result from disruption of the dopamine system in the brain and the effects of neuroleptics on muscle. Recognition of NMS is the most important step in its management by discontinuation of the causative drugs and applying supportive care and therapeutic measures. Specific therapeutic measures include the application of dopamine receptor agonists, e.g. dantrolene and use of benzodiazepines. The differential diagnosis of NMS comprises an extensive list of disorders presenting with fever and with muscle rigidity. Neuroleptics may be reintroduced in the majority of patients by using an atypical neuroleptic drug such as clozapine.", 
    "19": "1. The effects of dopaminergic agonists and antagonists were investigated on withdrawal signs in lorazepam-dependent rats. Physical dependence was developed by giving lorazepam admixed with food in the following dose schedules: 10 x 4, 20 x 4, 40 x 4, 80 x 4 and 120 x 7 mg/kg, daily for x days. 2. The parameters observed during the periods of administration of lorazepam and after its withdrawal were spontaneous locomotor activity (SLA), reaction time to pain, foot shock aggression (FSA) and audiogenic seizures. 3. During the withdrawal period, rats were divided into groups of 10 rats each. One group did not receive any drug and served as the control withdrawal groups. Three other groups received, separately, one of the following dopamimetic drugs: (i) 200 mg/kg per day, i.m., L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA; +50 mg/kg per day, i.m., carbidopa); (ii) 2 mg/kg per day, i.m., amphetamine; or (iii) 1 mg/kg per day, i.m., apomorphine. The remaining groups received one of the following dopamine antagonists: (i) 0.1 mg/kg per day, i.m., SCH 23390; (ii) 0.5 mg/kg per day, i.m., haloperidol; (iii) 0.5 mg/kg per day, i.m., centbutindol; and (iv) either 1 or 20 mg/kg per day, i.m., clozapine. 4. The withdrawal signs observed in the control group were hyperkinesia, hyperaggression and audiogenic seizures. 5. L-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (+ carbidopa), amphetamine and apomorphine potentiated hyperaggression and audiogenic seizures. The dopamine D2 receptor antagonists haloperidol, centbutindol and clozapine (at 20 mg/kg, i.m.) blocked all withdrawal signs. The D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 inhibited hyperkinesia and hyperaggression. The D4 receptor antagonist clozapine (at 1 mg/kg, i.m.) had no effect on any of the withdrawal signs. 6. It may be concluded that dopamine D2 receptors exert a dominant facilitatory influence, with partial contribution of D1 receptors, on the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "20": "Six non-drug-abusing humans were trained to discriminate 15 mg zolpidem in the present experiment. After participants acquired discrimination, a range of doses of zolpidem (2.5-15.0 mg), triazolam (0.0625-0.3750 mg), pentobarbital (25-150 mg), caffeine (100-600 mg), and placebo were tested to determine whether they shared discriminative-stimulus effects with 15 mg zolpidem. The participant-rated and performance-impairing effects of zolpidem, triazolam, pentobarbital, and caffeine were assessed concurrently. Triazolam and pentobarbital dose dependently increased zolpidem-appropriate responding. Caffeine occasioned low levels of zolpidem-appropriate responding. Zolpidem, triazolam, and pentobarbital, but not caffeine, generally produced a similar constellation of participant-rated drug effects (e.g., increased scores for the Pentobarbital, Chlorpromazine, and Alcohol Group subscale on the Addiction Research Center Inventory) and dose dependently impaired performance. These results suggest that humans can reliably discriminate zolpidem. Despite its unique benzodiazepine-receptor binding profile, the discriminative-stimulus, participant-rated, and performance-impairing effects of zolpidem are similar to those of the barbiturates and benzodiazepines.",

The muscarinic acetylcholine receptors mediating the contractile response elicited to endogenous acetylcholine released by the selective P2X receptor agonist alpha,beta-methylene ATP (mATP) were investigated in guinea-pig ileum. 2. mATP (0.1 - 30 microM) elicited a concentration-dependent neurogenic contractile response inhibited by tetrodotoxin (TTX) and antagonized by the non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist N-methylscopolamine (NMS). 3. The contractile response to mATP was pertussis toxin-insensitive, irreversibly antagonized by N-(2-chloroethyl)-4-piperidinyl diphenylacetate (4-DAMP mustard), and unaffected by the muscarinic M(2)/M(4) receptor selective antagonist AF-DX 116 (1 microM). 4. When measured in the presence of histamine and isoproterenol after treatment with 4-DAMP mustard, mATP elicited a pertussis toxin-sensitive contractile response potently antagonized by AF-DX 116. 5. Collectively, our data suggest that endogenous acetylcholine released by mATP can elicit a direct contractile response through the muscarinic M(3) receptor and an indirect contractile response through the muscarinic M(2) receptor by antagonizing the relaxant effects of isoproterenol on histamine induced contraction.",

Channels activated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in silent patches on the same neurones had similar conductance and outward rectification. The spontaneous currents were inhibited by bicuculline and potentiated by diazepam. It was concluded that the spontaneously opening channels were constitutively active, nonsynaptic GABA(A) channels. Such spontaneously opening GABA(A) channels may provide a tonic inhibitory mechanism in these cells and perhaps in other cells that have GABA(A) receptors although not having a GABA(A) synaptic input.

    "44": "Using an amygdala-kindled seizure paradigm, we evaluated the acute and chronic anticonvulsant effects of lamotrigine (LTG). Lamotrigine produced dose-dependent inhibitory effects on seizure stage, afterdischarge (AD), and seizure duration. Lamotrigine (15 mg/kg) also increased the afterdischarge and seizure thresholds. Following repeated LTG administration and stimulation at 48-h intervals, tolerance developed to LTG's (15 mg/kg) anticonvulsant effects, and cross-tolerance was observed to the anticonvulsant effects of carbamazepine (CBZ, 15 mg/kg). In a separate group of kindled rats, CBZ (15 mg/kg) was repeatedly administered to induce tolerance. This led to a partial cross-tolerance to LTG, manifesting as an increased rate of tolerance development to LTG, and seizures following the first injection in some animals, which were not observed in CBZ-nontolerant controls. When these rats were made fully tolerant to LTG and then exposed to higher doses of LTG (30 and 50 mg/kg), no anticonvulsant effects were observed. In contrast, higher doses of CBZ (30 mg/kg) did restore efficacy in CBZ-tolerant animals. Cross-tolerance from LTG to valproate and diazepam was not observed, although cross-tolerance from CBZ to valproate has been reported previously. These data suggest that LTG has both shared and distinct anticonvulsant mechanisms from those of CBZ on amygdala-kindled seizures. The implications of these results for clinical therapeutics remain to be evaluated.",

    "47": "The Continuous Performance Test (CPT) is a widely used procedure for sustained attention/vigilance measurement. However, though the key index of vigilance impairment is the decrement of sensitivity over time during the test period, only few studies have examined whether schizophrenics show a larger drop in CPT performance than do healthy controls. 48 schizophrenic inpatients and 48 controls were investigated with the Munich CPT (480 visual stimuli, 25% target stimuli, one stimulus per second). Stimuli were degraded by randomly inverting 40%, 41%, 42%, or 43% of the pixels. Results were calculated separately for three consecutive trial sections. Additionally, PANSS ratings, medication, and other clinical data were documented. Schizophrenics show a vigilance decrement over time, controls show a vigilance increase. Differential vigilance changes were not related to the level of stimulus degradation. Schizophrenics performed worse than controls only at the lowest degradation level. While overall sensitivity correlated negatively with the dose of atypical neuroleptics and benzodiazepines, vigilance shifts over time correlated negatively with the dose of typical neuroleptics. Furthermore, sensitivity was related to the cognitive PANSS syndrome, number of admissions/duration of illness. Differential sensitivity decrements of schizophrenics and controls can be shown if suited CPT procedures are used. The need for basic research on experimental conditions of the CPT as well as examination of the relationship between sustained attention/vigilance decrements and clinical features of schizophrenia is suggested.",

    "51": "The enthusiasm produced by the introduction of antipsychotic medication in the 1950s gave way to a certain frustration in the 1970s and 1980s. Despite the development of a large number of new drugs, little progress was made in treatment because these new agents were, in essence, therapeutically equivalent. This lack of progress was perhaps also related to an emphasis on tardive dyskinesia in the 1970s, i.e., the preoccupation with a negative effect of treatment. The reverse is taking place today. Clozapine and the other atypical antipsychotics are associated in people's minds with fewer or absent extrapyramidal symptoms and less tardive dyskinesia than the older typical agents. As a result, a certain amount of complacency exists. Tardive dyskinesia not only may be painful and disfiguring, but it also predicts poor outcome in patients with schizophrenia. Although many treatments have been tried, none have proven completely efficacious. The best treatment for tardive dyskinesia and dystonia is prevention, which is a function of medication choice. Pharmacologic interventions for tardive dyskinesia include clozapine and the other atypical antipsychotics. If typical antipsychotics must be used, they should be started at the lowest possible levels. Studies of risperidone suggest that it, too, should be used at very low doses to minimize the risk of tardive dyskinesia. It is also possible that schizophrenic patients taking atypical antipsychotics may experience fewer spontaneous dyskinesias, although further study is warranted.", 
    "52": "Neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia, which often appears in middle-aged and older adults early in the course of treatment with low doses of conventional antipsychotics, is 5 to 6 times more prevalent in elderly than in younger patients. In addition to age, other risk factors for tardive dyskinesia include early extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), cumulative amounts of neuroleptics, duration of neuroleptic treatment, and history of alcohol abuse and/or dependence. The atypical antipsychotics, which have a low liability for EPS, are likely to also have low potential for tardive dyskinesia, despite the paucity of controlled studies. Starting and maintenance doses of the atypical antipsychotics should generally be lower in older than in younger adults.", 
    "53": "Given the problematic nature of tardive dyskinesia in persons taking conventional antipsychotics, evaluation of newer atypical antipsychotic agents should include a systematic assessment of tardive dyskinesia liability. Results of a prospective double-blind, randomized study of schizophrenic patients who participated in 3 preclinical olanzapine studies and were treated with 5 to 20 mg/day of olanzapine (N = 1192) or haloperidol (N = 522) recently indicated a significantly lower risk of development of tardive dyskinesia with olanzapine treatment than haloperidol treatment. This article discusses the known effects of atypical antipsychotic medications on tardive dyskinesia movements (both withdrawal and persistent) and the incidence rate of tardive dyskinesia among schizophrenic patients undergoing long-term treatment with olanzapine or haloperidol.", 
    "54": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is currently used as a marker of inflammation and gliosis following brain injury. Previous reports suggest that elevated PBR levels in injured brain tissue are specific to activated microglia and infiltrating macrophages. We have produced hippocampal lesions using the neurotoxicant trimethyltin (TMT) to examine the cellular and subcellular nature of the PBR response. Degenerating, argyrophilic pyramidal neurons were observed in the hippocampus at 2 and 14 days after TMT exposure. Reactive microglia were also evident at both times with a maximal response observed at 14 days, subsiding by 6 weeks. Astrocytosis was observed at 14 days and 6 weeks, but not 2 days, after TMT administration, suggesting that the onset of the astroglia response is delayed, but more persistent, compared with microgliosis. Morphological evidence from [3H]PK11195 microautoradiography and PBR immunohistochemistry indicates that both astrocytes and microglia are capable of expressing high levels of PBR after injury. This was confirmed by double labeling of either Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4, a microglial-specific marker, or glial fibrillary acidic protein, an astrocyte-specific protein with PBR fluorescence immunohistochemistry. These results demonstrate that PBR expression is increased after brain injury in both activated microglia and astrocytes. Our findings also provide the first evidence for in situ nuclear localization of PBR in glial cells.", 
    "55": "Diazepam-elicited hyperglycemia in mice was inhibited by adrenalectomy and the catecholamine synthesis inhibitor alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, although it was unaffected by pretreatment with the corticosterone synthesis inhibitor dexamethasone. Diazepam-induced hyperglycemia was prevented by the alpha2 adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan, while the beta1 and beta2 adrenoceptor antagonists, metoprolol and ICI 118 551, did not affect it. Furthermore, diazepam increased plasma adrenaline levels in mice. These results suggest that diazepam-induced hyperglycemia is closely related to adrenaline release from the adrenal gland.", 
    "56": "Noise is an environmental physical agent, which is regarded as a stressful stimulus: impairment and modifications in biological functions are reported, after loud noise exposure, at several levels in human and animal organs and apparatuses, as well as in the endocrine, cardiovascular and nervous system. In the present study equilibrium binding parameters of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) labelled by the specific radioligand [3H]PK 11195, were evaluated in cardiac tissue of rats submitted to 6 or 12 h noise exposure and of rats treated \"in vivo\" with PBR ligands such as PK 11195, Ro54864, diazepam and then noise-exposed. Results revealed a statistically significant decrease in the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) of [3H]PK 11195 in atrial membranes of 6 or 12 h noise exposed rats, compared with sham-exposed animals, without any change in the dissociation constant (Kd). The \"in vivo\" PBR ligand pre-treatment counteracted the noise-induced modifications of PBR density. As PBRs are mainly located on mitochondria we also investigated whether noise exposure can affect the [3H]PK 11195 binding parameters in isolated cardiac mitochondrial fractions. Results indicated a significant Bmax value decrease in right atrial mitochondrial fractions of rats 6 or 12 h noise-exposed. Furthermore, as PBR has been suggested to be a supramolecular complex that might coincide with the not-yet-established structure of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT)-pore, the status of the MPT-pore in isolated heart mitochondria was investigated in noise- and sham-exposed rats. The loss of absorbance associated with the calcium-induced MPT-pore opening was greater in mitochondria isolated from hearts of 6 h noise- than those of sham-exposed rats. In conclusion, these findings represent a further instance for PBR density decrease in response to a stressful stimulus, like noise; in addition they revealed that \"in vivo\" administration of PBR ligands significantly prevents this decrease. Finally, our data also suggest the involvement of MPT in the response of an organism to noise stress.",

The mean (sd) induction time was 26 (9) seconds and the mean level of anaesthesia was 4.4 units on an eight-point scale. Male seals were given less drug than female seals, remained immobilised for shorter periods and recovered sooner.

    "65": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) are widely distributed throughout the body, but their functions are unknown. They are found on mononuclear phagocytes, and they are up-regulated in a number of neurological and other disease states. We explored the functional consequences of PBR ligand binding to mononuclear-derived cells using the high-affinity ligands 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxam ide (PK 11195) and 4'-chlorodiazepam (7-chloro-5-(4'-chlorophenyl)-1, 3-dihydro-1-methyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one; Ro 5-4864). The functions were the following: respiratory burst; secretion of glutamate, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha); toxicity of culture supernatants towards SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells; and expression of the inflammatory surface markers HLA-DR and Fcgamma RII (CDw32). PK 11195 inhibited the respiratory burst response, reduced release of glutamate and IL-1beta, and suppressed secretion of products cytotoxic to neuronal cells. Selectivity was suggested by the failure of PK 11195 to influence TNF-alpha secretion or expression of HLA-DR and CDw32. Powerful ligands of PBRs, such as PK 11195, may be useful inhibitors of selective macrophage functions, retarding both local and systemic inflammation. Since PK 11195 readily enters the brain, it may be beneficial in treating central as well as peripheral inflammatory diseases.", 
    "66": "The aim of the study was to determine the quality of sedation in ventilated patients on a general paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), including those treated with infusions of neuromuscular blocking agents. Twenty-eight ventilated children on a PICU had their level of sedation determined using an arousability scale dependent upon the response to tracheal suction. Observed levels of sedation were then compared to a predetermined desired level of sedation. A total of 81 assessments were performed and 90% were considered satisfactory. Thirty-two of these assessments were performed in 15 children following the temporary discontinuation of infusions of neuromuscular blocking agents; 97% of these assessments were considered satisfactory. A regime of continuous intravenous midazolam and morphine with additional oral sedation using chloral hydrate and antihistamines when required provides a satisfactory level of sedation for the majority of children ventilated on a PICU, including those treated with infusions of neuromuscular blocking agents.", 
    "67": "Desflurane has several properties making it a desirable agent for use in electrophysiological studies (EPS) for diagnosis and treatment of cardiac dysrhythmias. We studied 47 children, mean age 12.8+/-4.6 years, mean weight 52.9+/-24.0 kg, with clinical history of supra- ventricular tachycardia (SVT) during EPS using desflurane in a crossover comparison with fentanyl. The patients served as their own controls. All received oral premedication with lorazepam, and intravenous induction with thiopentone, rocuronium, and oxygen. Group 1 (n=24) were administered fentanyl 10 microg.kg-1 bolus i.v. with an infusion of 3 microg.kg-1.h-1 during initial EPS. Fentanyl was discontinued and desflurane, 6% endtidal, was administered and the EPS repeated. Group 2 (n=23) were initially administered 6% desflurane after induction, and following EPS the desflurane was discontinued and the patients administered fentanyl 3 microg.kg-1 bolus and EPS repeated (explanations of EPS abbreviations are provided). Desflurane reduced the mean arterial pressure (MAP) in all patients. In Group 1, desflurane shortened the sinus cycle length (SCL), i.e. increasing the heart rate, and atrial effective refractory period (AERP) while Group 2 demonstrated no such effect on AERP. There were no other significant differences between fentanyl or desflurane techniques in terms of EPS measurements. SVT was inducible with both agents in both groups. Desflurane seems an acceptable agent for use during EPS procedures.", 
    "68": "In Leonhard's nosological system, acute, episodic psychoses with good short-term and long-term prognoses, characterized by mixed affective and schizophrenic features, confusion, and alternating psychomotor retardation and excitement are called cycloid psychoses. According to clinical lore, patients with cycloid psychoses show an excellent and prompt response to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). We describe a patient with typical motility psychosis, a subtype of cycloid psychoses, who failed to respond to a combination of antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication but quickly recovered after the administration of ECT.", 
    "69": "The electrical dosage of the ECT stimulus impacts on efficacy and cognitive side effects, yet seizure threshold (ST) may vary as much as 50-fold across patients. It would be desirable to predict ST on the basis of patient and treatment characteristics. In particular, concerns have been raised that benzodiazepine use and higher dosage of barbiturate anesthetics elevate ST. In a three-site study, ST was quantified at the first ECT session using an identical empirical titration procedure in 294 patients who met RDC and DSM-IIIR criteria for a major depressive episode. ST varied over a 35-fold range across patients treated with right unilateral (RUL) (n = 267) and bilateral (BL) (n = 27) ECT. Higher ST was associated with BL electrode placement (p = 0.001). Among patients treated with RUL ECT, univariate analyses indicated that higher ST was associated with advanced age (p < 0.001), male gender (p < 0.001), greater burden of medical illness (p < 0.001), weight (p < 0.01), duration of mood disorder (p < 0.01), and history of previous ECT (p < 0.05). Average lorazepam dose in the 48 hours prior to ECT was not associated with ST, but was associated with decreased seizure duration (p < 0.01). Absolute, but not weight-adjusted, methohexital dose was associated with ST (p < 0.01). Multivariate analyses in patients treated with unilateral ECT showed that only 27.6% of the variance in ST (p < 0.0001) could be predicted. In the multivariate analyses, only age (p = 0.0001), gender (p = 0.01), and methohexital dose (p = 0.0001) were independently related to ST. Low dosage of lorazepam and methohexital dosage below 1 mg/kg are unlikely to impact on ST. Given the limited capacity to predict ST, empirical titration remains the only accurate method to determine electrical dosage in RUL ECT.", 
    "70": "The chiral separation of lorazepam was achieved on a chiral column with UV and circular dichroism (CD) detection. The good resolution of lorazepam enantiomers was obtained on the column of beta-cyclodextrin derivative immobilized silica gel under reversed-phase conditions. The enantiomeric separation and identification of lorazepam were succeeded by CD detector. The method described allows the quantitation of the stereoisomers of lorazepam in human plasma following the administration of a therapeutic dose of the racemic drug. Chiroptical detection is useful for the pharmacokinetic study of chiral drugs.", 
    "71": "Sixty patients in the age group of 18-60 years of A.S.A. Grade I/II risk, scheduled for elective orthopaedic surgeries under general anaesthesia were studied for pre-medication with either oral clonidine or with combination of effects of diazepam & atropine. Patients in Group A (clonidine group) received tablet clonidine 100 mcg (1 tablet) if less than 50 kg in weight and 200 mcg if weighing more than 50 kg two hours before surgery. Patients in Group B (Diazepam-atropine group) received one tablet of Diazepam (10 mg) orally two hours before surgery and injection atropine-sulphate 0.01 mg/kg half an hour preoperatively by intramuscular route. In our study, the sedative and anti-sialogogue effects of clonidine were comparable to those of diazepam-atropine combination, which are commonly used premedicants. The anti-anxiety effect of clonidine was found to be better than that of diazepam-atropine combination. Clonidine also proved to be a better agent for the attenuation of pressor response to laryngoscopy and intubation. Thus, oral clonidine is a better premedicant compared to atropine-diazepam combination. Also, it is a more acceptable agent because of its oral route of administration.", 
    "72": "Some, but not all, of a series of novel pyrrolo-1,5-benzoxazepines (PBOXs) induce apoptosis as shown by cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation in three human cell lines, HL-60 promyelocytic, Jurkat T lymphoma, and Hut-78 s.c. lymphoma cells. This chemical selectivity, together with the lack of apoptotic activity against rat Leydig cells, argues against a general cell poisoning effect. PBOX-6, a potent member of the series, caused activation of a member of the caspase-3 family of proteases. In addition, the caspase-3-like inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk, but not the caspase-1-like inhibitor z-YVAD-fmk prevented PBOX-6-induced apoptosis, suggesting that caspase 3-like proteases are involved in the mechanism by which PBOX compounds induce apoptosis. The release of cytochrome c into the cytosol in HL-60 cells in response to PBOX-6 suggests that this cellular response may be important in the mechanism by which PBOX-6 induces apoptosis. However, reactive oxygen intermediates do not play a key role in PBOX-6-induced apoptosis because neither the free radical scavenger TEMPO nor the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine had any effect on PBOX-6-induced apoptosis. The apoptotic induction seems independent of the mitochondrial peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) that binds these pyrrolobenzoxazepines with high affinity, due to the lack of correlation between their affinities for the receptor and their apoptotic potencies, their high apoptotic activity in PBR-deficient cells such as Jurkats, and their lack of apoptotic induction in PBR-rich rat Leydig cells. These PBOXs also can overcome nuclear factor-kappaB-mediated resistance to apoptosis. This suggests an important potential use of these compounds in drug-resistant cancers.", 
    "73": "The ability of subanesthetic doses of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists to induce positive, negative, and cognitive schizophrenia-like symptoms suggests that reduced NMDA receptor function may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. An increasing body of evidence indicates that antipsychotic drugs, especially those with \"atypical\" properties, can antagonize the effects of NMDA antagonists in a variety of experimental paradigms. We demonstrated previously that clozapine, the prototype of atypical antipsychotics, but not haloperidol, the typical antipsychotic, blocked ketamine-induced alterations in brain metabolism. In this study, effects of clozapine were compared with two of the newer atypical antipsychotic drugs, risperidone and olanzapine, on ketamine-induced alterations in regional [(14)C]2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake. A subanesthetic dose of ketamine (25 mg/kg) induced robust increases in 2-DG uptake in limbic cortical regions, hippocampal formation, nucleus accumbens, and basolateral amygdala. Pretreatment of rats with risperidone (0.3 mg/kg) before ketamine administration did not alter the effects of ketamine. These data suggest that novel pharmacological properties may contribute to the effects of clozapine in this model, in addition to the well characterized actions at D(2) and 5HT(2A) receptors. In contrast to the results with risperidone, olanzapine blocked ketamine-induced increases in 2-DG uptake. However, a higher dose of olanzapine (10 mg/kg) was required to completely block the effects of ketamine than would be expected if D(2) and 5HT(2) receptor blocking properties of the drug were solely responsible for its action. The results suggest that the ketamine challenge 2-DG paradigm may be a useful model to identify antipsychotic drugs with atypical characteristics and to explore mechanisms of atypical antipsychotic action.", 
    "74": "Cocaine and alcohol are frequently used simultaneously and this combination is associated with enhanced toxicity. We recently showed that active cocaine abusers have a markedly enhanced sensitivity to benzodiazepines. Because both benzodiazepines and alcohol facilitate GABAergic neurotransmission we questioned whether cocaine abusers would also have an enhanced sensitivity to alcohol that could contribute to the toxicity. In this study we compared the effects of alcohol (0.75 g/kg) on regional brain glucose metabolism between cocaine abusers (n = 9) and controls (n = 10) using PET and FDG. Alcohol significantly decreased whole brain metabolism and this effect was greater in controls (26+/-6%) than in abusers (17+/-10%) even though they had equivalent levels of alcohol in plasma. Analysis of the regional measures showed that cocaine abusers had a blunted response to alcohol in limbic regions, cingulate gyrus, medial frontal and orbitofrontal cortices.", 
    "75": "The blunted response to alcohol in cocaine abusers contrasts with their enhanced sensitivity to benzodiazepines suggesting that targets other than GABA-benzodiazepine receptors are involved in the blunted sensitivity to alcohol and that the toxicity from combined cocaine-alcohol use is not due to an enhanced sensitivity to alcohol in cocaine abusers. The blunted response to alcohol in limbic regions and in cortical regions connected to limbic areas could result from a decreased sensitivity of reward circuits in cocaine abusers.",

The estimated development costs of CAI were higher, but total costs over a 6-year period were lower than for the DT and VBT. The results suggest that clinical skills can be taught equally effectively through several different methods. Collaboration between institutions in the development of widely applicable CAI tools should be an efficient and economical mode of teaching with a wide range of applications.", 
    "83": "An increasing body of evidence supports the notion that activation of astrocytic (peripheral-type) benzodiazepine receptors contributes to the pathogenesis of the central nervous system symptoms which are characteristic of portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE). Binding site densities for the PTBR ligand [3H-PK11195] are increased in autopsied brain tissue from PSE patients as well as in the brains of animals with experimental chronic liver failure. In the case of the animal studies, increased PTBR sites resulted from increased PTBR gene expression. Exposure of cultured astrocytes to ammonia or manganese (two neurotoxic agents which under normal circumstances are removed by the hepatobiliary system and which are found to accumulate in brain in PSE) results in increased densities of [3H-PK11195] binding sites. Activation of PTBR is known to result in increased cholesterol uptake and increased synthesis in brain of neurosteroids some of which have potent positive allosteric modulator properties on the GABA-A receptor system. Accumulation of such substances in the brain in chronic liver failure could explain the neural inhibition characteristics of PSE.",

    "85": "A fatality due to a massive ingestion of paraquat is presented. Screening by enzyme-multiplied immunoassay of postmortem blood and urine disclosed the presence of tricyclic antidepressants (in urine only), benzodiazepines, cotinine, and caffeine. Further analysis of blood, urine, and stomach contents with thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and gas chromatography confirmed the results found in the preliminary routine screening. It also revealed the presence of paraquat in blood, urine, and stomach contents, of diethyl parathion in urine and stomach contents, and of mevinphos in blood and stomach contents. Quantitation of paraquat was performed using HPLC with diode-array detection. Sample preparation involved a protein-precipitation step using trichloroacetic acid (necessary only for blood and tissue homogenate), followed by a chemical reduction with sodium borohydride of the fully ionized paraquat to a diene, which is amenable to solvent extraction. Quantitative results were obtained for all postmortem matrices available: blood, 5.05 mg/L; urine, 6.00 mg/l; stomach contents, 17.2 g/L; liver, 4.86 mg/kg; and kidney, 80.6 mg/kg. The paraquat distribution in this case is compared with analytical findings reported in the literature.

To this end, systematic solid-phase extraction (SPE) approaches for drug isolation from biological fluids are required. Because speed and cost effectiveness are key issues in analytical toxicology, we have evaluated a disc-format extraction device for this purpose and compared the latter with an existing packed-bed column-format method. The discs were SPEC.PLUS.C18AR/MP3 cartridges with 10-mL solvent reservoirs, providing hydrophobic and cation exchange interactions. Blank human urine was spiked at 2 microg/mL with a selection of acidic, neutral, and basic drugs representing a variety of relevant drug classes. Urine specimens (2 mL) were diluted with 2 mL 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) and then applied to the preconditioned disc. Washing was done with 1 mL water. Acidic and neutral drugs were eluted with 1 mL ethyl acetate/acetone (1:1), and basic drugs were eluted with 1 mL ammoniated ethyl acetate. The eluates were collected separately, evaporated down to about 0.1 mL, and analyzed by gas chromatography-flame-ionization detection to check cleanliness, recoveries, and reproducibilities. The discs showed good extraction properties for all drugs and were easy to handle. Recoveries were 75-100% with coefficients of variation of around 5%. The resulting eluates showed only a few matrix interferences. As compared to our standard SPE method with packed-bed columns, the disc procedure allowed reductions in elution volumes and total processing time of approximately 60-65%.",

The extracts were examined with high-performance liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (LC-APCI-MS). The drugs were separated on ODS column in acetonitrile/50 mM ammonium formate buffer (pH 3.0) (25:75) as a mobile phase. Full-scan mass spectra of drugs examined by means of APCI with collision-induced dissociation showed protonated molecular ions and fragments typical for particular drugs. LC-APCI-MS allowed an unequivocal differentiation of all drugs involved. The quantitation was performed using selected ion monitoring of protonated molecular ions and fragments of drugs involved and their deuterated analogues. The limits of detection ranged from 1 to 5 microg/L serum, and the recoveries ranged from 58 to 96%. A linear response was observed for all drugs in the range from 5 to 500 microg/L. The method was applied for routine determination of amphetamine, MDMA, MDA, and MDEA in one run.

Subjects were 113 men and women, ages 18 to 65 years. Polysomnographic and subjective sleep data were collected during baseline, on two nights during each of five treatment weeks, and on the first two nights after discontinuation of active medication.Results: Sleep latency was significantly shortened with zaleplon 10 mg for all 5 weeks of treatment as assessed by polysomnography and by subjective sleep measures. Total sleep time, whether evaluated with polysomnography or with subjective estimates, was inconsistently affected. Sleep architecture was similar with zaleplon and placebo. There was no evidence of tolerance to the sleep promoting effects of zaleplon during the five weeks of administration, and there was no rebound insomnia upon discontinuation.

In the present experiments, the selective, group II mGluR agonist (+)-2-aminobicyclo-[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (LY354740, 0.1-1.0 microM) inhibited spontaneous epileptiform discharges which developed in rat cortical slices in Mg2+-free medium. LY354740 (4-16 mg/kg) administered prior to an injection of pentylenetetrazol (80 mg/kg) or picrotoxin (3.2 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent decrease in the number of mice exhibiting clonic convulsions, but had no effect on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA, 150 mg/kg)-induced convulsions. LY354740 (4-16 mg/kg) did not affect lethality induced in mice by pentylenetetrazol, picrotoxin or NMDA. LY354740 potentiated the anticonvulsant activity of the conventional antiepileptic drug diazepam, significantly decreasing the ED50 for that drug's effect on pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions by 30%, but had no influence on anticonvulsant activity of ethosuximide and valproic acid. A pharmacokinetic interaction between LY354740 and diazepam, leading to the lowering of the plasma level of free diazepam, was also demonstrated. Our data suggest that the group II mGluR agonist LY354740 possesses anti-seizure activity and may modify the effects of some conventional antiepileptic drugs.", 
    "104": "The newer oral antifungal agents, such as fluconazole, itraconazole and terbinafine, are generally both effective and well tolerated in the management of widespread or resistant dermatomycoses such as onychomycosis. However, these agents differ markedly in their potential to cause clinically significant drug interactions. Triazoles such as fluconazole and itraconazole have been responsible for a greater number of clinically significant drug interactions than terbinafine. For example, itraconazole, and to a lesser extent fluconazole (in high doses) are inhibitors of CYP3A4. Therefore certain agents that are substrates of this enzyme, such as some of the new generation of H1-antihistamines, several HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and certain benzodiazepines, are contraindicated. Other drugs like cyclosporine and quinidine need careful monitoring if administered concurrently with these triazoles. In contrast, there are no drug-drug contraindications with terbinafine. Indeed, in a postmarketing surveillance study, in which 42.8% of the 25,884 participating patients were taking a variety of concomitant therapies, no new drug-drug interactions were revealed. Physicians should be aware of the potential for interaction of the medications that they prescribe, in order to prevent or reduce the burden of adverse events. Terbinafine may be the most rational choice of oral antifungal agent in patients receiving concomitant medications that may adversely affect or be affected by either fluconazole or itraconazole.",

    "136": "Cell lines are commonly used for studying recombinant heterooligomeric ion channels with defined subunit composition. Such studies often ignore the contribution of endogenous proteins in the assembly of mature channels. We examined whether an endogenous subunit was required for the functional expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors in WSS-1 cells, HEK293 cells stably expressing recombinant alpha1 and gamma2 subunits. Our pharmacological and RT-PCR analyses of GABA(A) receptors and their mRNAs in WSS-1 cells confirm the presence of alpha1 and gamma2 subunits and suggest the existence of an endogenous beta3 subunit. Whole-cell GABA-evoked currents recorded from untransfected WSS-1 cells were blocked by bicuculline methiodide and enhanced by anesthetics and anticonvulsants including the subunit-selective compounds diazepam and loreclezole. These data suggest that, in addition to the gamma2 subunit, WSS-1 cell receptors also contain beta2/3 subunits. RT-PCR revealed that WSS-1 cells and parental HEK293 cells contain beta3 mRNA. We examined the contribution of the beta3 subunit in the function of receptors formed by expression of alpha1 and gamma2S subunits. Untransfected HEK293 cells were unresponsive to GABA. Cells transfected with alpha1 and gamma2S cDNAs displayed small diazepam and loreclezole responsive GABA-activated currents. By contrast, the expression of alpha1 and gamma2S cDNAs in the neuroblastoma NB41A3 cell line, that lacks beta subunit mRNAs, failed to produce functional receptors. These data reaffirm that alpha1 and gamma2S subunits alone do not form functional GABA(A) receptors and that receptors of WSS-1 cells contain alpha1, beta3 and gamma2S subunits.", 
    "137": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a major neuropsychiatric complication of cirrhosis. HE develops slowly in cirrhotic patients, starting with altered sleep patterns and eventually progressing through asterixis to stupor and coma. Precipitating factors are common and include an oral protein load, gastrointestinal bleeding and the use of sedatives. HE is common following transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunts (TIPS). Neuropathologically, HE in cirrhotic patients is characterized by astrocytic (rather than neuronal) changes known as Alzheimer type II astrocytosis and in altered expression of key astrocytic proteins. Magnetic resonance imaging in cirrhotic patients reveals bilateral signal hyperintensities particularly in globus pallidus on T1-weighted imaging, a phenomenon which may result from manganese deposition. Proton (1H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy shows increases in the glutamine resonance in brain, a finding which confirms previous biochemical studies and results no doubt from increased brain ammonia removal (glutamine synthesis). Additional evidence for increased brain ammonia uptake and removal in cirrhotic patients is provided by studies using positron emission tomography and 13NH3. Recent molecular biological studies demonstrate increased expression of genes coding for neurotransmitter-related proteins in chronic liver failure. Such genes include monoamine oxidase (MAO-A isoform), the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor and nitric oxide synthase (nNOS isoform). Activation of these systems has the potential to lead to alterations of monoamine and amino acid neurotransmitter function as well as modified cerebral perfusion in chronic liver failure. Prevention and treatment of HE in cirrhotic patients continues to rely on ammonia-lowering strategies which include assessment of dietary protein intake and the use of lactulose, neomycin, sodium benzoate and L-ornithine-aspartate. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil may be effective in certain cases. A more widespread use of central nervous system-acting drugs awaits a more complete understanding of the precise neurotransmitter systems involved in the pathogenesis of HE in chronic liver failure.",

    "139": "Recent studies have demonstrated that granule cells in rat cerebellar slices exhibit a tonic form of GABAergic inhibition. The presence of a similar constitutive GABAergic conductance was investigated in synaptically coupled cultures of neonatal rat cerebellum. In cells exhibiting spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), application of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline (10 microM) eliminated the IPSCs and also produced a significant decrease in holding current. This latter effect was lacking in cells that did not exhibit IPSCs. Application of TTX (1 microM) and Cd(2+) (100 microM) decreased the IPSC frequency and also produced a change in holding current; these effects were eliminated by the prior application of bicuculline. In the presence of TTX, application of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) Flunitrazepam (1 microM) caused a 85+/-15% increase in the component of holding current that arose from GABA(A) receptor activity. Noise analysis indicated that the GABA(A) receptors underlying this tonic form of GABAergic inhibition exhibited a mean single channel conductance close to 14 pS, a value similar to that seen for somatic GABA(A) receptors in these cells. Thus, like their counterparts in cerebellar slices, cerebellar granule cells in culture exhibit a background GABAergic conductance. The most likely source of this tonic current is GABA spilt over from active inhibitory synapses. As this conductance was sensitive to benzodiazepine receptor agonists it is unlikely to arise entirely from GABA(A) receptors containing the alpha6 subunit.", 
    "140": "AMPA-receptor (AMPA-R) currents were recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons in situ and after acute isolation from the hippocampus of 3- to 45-day-old rats. Membrane currents were analyzed by combining the patch clamp method with fast application techniques. The complete block of receptor currents by GYKI 53655 and the absence of modulation by Concanavalin A indicated that the cells exclusively expressed non-NMDA glutamate receptors of the AMPA subtype while functional kainate receptors could not be detected. The lowest sensitivity to kainate and NBQX was observed at postnatal day (p) 18. These changes might reflect a lower abundance of GluR1 at that developmental stage. A decrease of potentiation of receptor currents by cyclothiazide (CTZ), an acceleration of the recovery from CTZ potentiation and a faster and more complete desensitization of glutamate-evoked currents suggest an up-regulation of flop splice variants with increasing age. These functional data indicate that AMPA-R expression in CA1 pyramidal neurons varies during postnatal development which can be expected to influence the kinetics of synaptic transmission and the excitotoxic vulnerability as well.", 
    "141": "The amygdaloid complex is thought to be a major site of action of anxiolytic benzodiazepine agonists. To investigate whether activity in the amygdaloid complex is altered with anxiolytic effects of diazepam, mRNA expression of the immediate-early gene EGR-1 was examined in the amygdala following blockade of fear conditioning by diazepam. It was previously shown that mRNA expression of EGR-1 (also called, NGFI-A, Zif 268, Krox 24) increases in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) shortly following contextual fear conditioning. It was therefore hypothesized that diazepam would block both contextual fear and the concomitant increase in EGR-1 mRNA expression in the LA induced by fear conditioning. Rats administered systemic diazepam before fear conditioning displayed both anxiolytic effects during the post-shock period and amnesic effects during a retention test 24 h later. Diazepam blocked the fear-conditioning-induced increase in EGR-1 expression in the LA. In addition, diazepam significantly increased EGR-1 mRNA expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) in a dose-dependent manner. The results reveal differential regulation of EGR-1 by diazepam in the central and lateral nuclei of the amygdala suggesting that these two amygdala nuclei act in a reciprocal manner during the anxiolytic and amnesic action of the benzodiazepine agonist.", 
    "142": "The effects of various anticonvulsants on local anaesthetics procaine- and lidocaine-induced convulsions were investigated in rats. Pretreatment with diazepam (2.5-5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and clonazepam (5-10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) completely protected the rats against both local anaesthetic-induced convulsions. Phenobarbital (12.5-50 mg/kg, subcutaneously) also significantly decreased the incidence of both convulsions and prolonged their latencies. Carbabazepine (10-40 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) did not completely repress both convulsions, but it prolonged their latencies. Phenytoin (5-20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and primidone (30-60 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) markedly enhanced both local anaesthetic-induced convulsions, as shown by shortening of latency and increase in mortality. Valproate (100-200 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) produced a protective effect against procaine-induced convulsions, while it strongly enhanced lidocaine-induced convulsions. These results suggest that the benzodiazepines are effective drugs to prevent neurotoxicity induced by local anaesthetics, while phenytoin and primidone potentiate them.", 
    "143": "This study evaluated the impact of insomnia and chronic use of benzodiazepines on the cognitive and psychomotor performance of older adults. Three conditions, matched on age, gender, and education, were compared: 20 prolonged users of benzodiazepines for insomnia, 20 unmedicated insomniacs, and 20 good sleepers. The participants completed neuropsychological tests of memory, attention/concentration, psychomotor speed, and executive functions, as well as subjective evaluations of their actual performance. Individuals with insomnia, both medicated and unmedicated, performed worse than good sleepers on the attention/concentration factor. There was no other objective evidence of performance impairments. However, unmedicated insomniacs had lower performance expectancies and subjectively rated their performance more negatively relative to medicated insomniacs and good sleepers. Both insomnia conditions also rated their performance as lower compared with their perceived potential. It is suggested that the attention/concentration difficulties experienced by medicated and unmedicated older adults with insomnia may be linked to a state of hyperarousal. The discrepancies between subjective reports of daytime deficits and objective impairments may reflect a generalized faulty appraisal of sleep and daytime functioning among individuals with insomnia complaints. The implications of those findings for the assessment and treatment of late-life insomnia are discussed.",

Efficacy was evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Revised Symptom Checklist and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire. A successful response to treatment was achieved in 91% (10/11) of patients who received trazodone and 57% (four of seven) of patients who were administered clorazepate (P = 0.1373). Bayesian analysis revealed that the prior probability of making a wrong decision in prescribing trazodone rather than clorazepate reduced from 26% to 8%. Assessment of the clinical scales suggested a benefit of trazodone compared with clorazepate, although the differences were not significant. Safety of both treatments was similar. Trazodone is devoid of an abuse risk and dependence and, therefore, could be a valuable alternative to clorazepate in the treatment of adjustment disorders in cancer patients.", 
    "145": "Sleep quality and anxiety levels were examined using questionnaires and polysomnographic recordings in 22 chronic insomnia patients who regularly used benzodiazepines to treat their sleeping problems. After abruptly discontinuing their benzodiazepine medication, patients were randomly allocated to receive either a placebo or zolpidem 10 mg for 1 week, after which they entered an open extension phase, receiving zolpidem 10 mg for 3 weeks. Subjectively, sleep quality was considered mediocre during the use of a benzodiazepine hypnotic. One week after the discontinuation, an increase in sleep latency was observed in the placebo group, whereas zolpidem induced a significant decrease in sleep latency. Deterioration of other sleep variables (probably rebound) was not suppressed by zolpidem. An explanation for this could be the selective pharmacological profile of zolpidem. Polysomnographic differences between placebo and benzodiazepine and between placebo and zolpidem were not reflected by the subjective data on sleep and anxiety. Changes of sleep structure caused by hypnotics seem not always to be felt as such by patients. After 3-4 weeks of zolpidem treatment, the percentage of non-rapid eye movement-4 sleep increased significantly, corresponding with a significant subjective improvement of sleep quality. This indicates that zolpidem may restore physiological sleep.", 
    "146": "The alcohol withdrawal syndrome can be classified into three degrees of severity on the basis of the symptomatology, autonomic withdrawal, predelirium and delirium tremens. In American literature the severity of withdrawal is recorded using the CIWA-A scale (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment--Alcohol). The pathophysiological causes lie in an imbalance between the inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters after giving up alcohol. This results in predomination by the excitatory system. Therapeutic intervention is possible here. Clomethiazole has effective sedative actions, stabilises the autonomic nervous system, and is an anticonvulsant. It is the drug of choice for autonomic withdrawal and predelirium. The benzodlazepines have a similar effect, but cannot be controlled so accurately. Carbamazepine can prevent withdrawal convulsions and progression of delirium. Clonidine acts on autonomic withdrawal and, together with neuroleptics and benzodiazepines, is easy to use parenterally for delirium tremens, while parenteral clomethiazole harbours dangers.", 
    "147": "Despite its importance in the cerebellum, the functions of the orphan glutamate receptor delta2 are unknown. We examined a mutant delta2 receptor channel in lurcher mice that was constitutively active in the absence of ligand. Because this mutation was within a highly conserved motif (YTANLAAF), we tested its effect on several glutamate receptors. Mutant delta2 receptors showed distinct channel properties, including double rectification of the current-voltage relationship, sensitivity to a polyamine antagonist and moderate Ca 2+ permeability, whereas other constitutively active mutant glutamate channels resembled wild-type channels in these respects. Moreover, the kinetics of ligand-activated currents were strikingly altered. We conclude that the delta2 receptor has a functional ion channel pore similar to that of glutamate receptors. The motif may have a role in the channel gating of glutamate receptors.", 
    "148": "Localized in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 4.7 T was used to examine the brains of rats that were given the antipsychotic drugs haloperidol, clozapine, or olanzapine for 1 week. Spectra were collected before and during treatment. The ratios of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) to creatine (Cr) and choline to Cr were determined from the spectra. No significant differences in these ratios were seen among the rats given the various antipsychotic medications or between the control rats and the treated rats. No significant time-dependent changes were seen in most cases, except for a small reduction of NAA/Cr after 7 days of olanzapine administration. These results suggest that differences in brain metabolite ratios in vivo in schizophrenics relative to controls, at least for short-term treatment, arise from the disease, and not as a metabolic effect of the medication.", 
    "149": "Neuronal circuits across several systems display remarkable plasticity to sensory input during postnatal development. Experience-dependent refinements are often restricted to well-defined critical periods in early life, but how these are established remains mostly unknown. A representative example is the loss of responsiveness in neocortex to an eye deprived of vision. Here we show that the potential for plasticity is retained throughout life until an inhibitory threshold is attained. In mice of all ages lacking an isoform of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) synthetic enzyme (GAD65), as well as in immature wild-type animals before the onset of their natural critical period, benzodiazepines selectively reduced a prolonged discharge phenotype to unmask plasticity. Enhancing GABA-mediated transmission early in life rendered mutant animals insensitive to monocular deprivation as adults, similar to normal wild-type mice. Short-term presynaptic dynamics reflected a synaptic reorganization in GAD65 knockout mice after chronic diazepam treatment. A threshold level of inhibition within the visual cortex may thus trigger, once in life, an experience-dependent critical period for circuit consolidation, which may otherwise lie dormant.", 
    "150": "The most frequent problems associated with the older generation of antipsychotic agents are extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) and tardive dyskinesia. Neuroleptic-induced EPS are thought to be caused by blockade of nigrostriatal dopamine tracts resulting in a relative increase in cholinergic activity; tardive dyskinesia is less well understood but is thought to be a supersensitivity response to chronic dopamine blockade. The leading hypothesis for the mechanism of action of the newer generation of atypical antipsychotics is the presence of a high serotonin-to-dopamine receptor blockade ratio in the brain. When serotonergic activity is blocked-as is the case with atypical antipsychotics-dopamine release increases and balances out the dopamine blockade effect at postsynaptic receptor sites, which results in few or no EPS. Prospective data indicate that the risk of tardive dyskinesia in patients taking atypical antipsychotics is less than that for those taking typical antipsychotics. This article reviews the mechanisms of neuroleptic-induced EPS and tardive dyskinesia and discusses the relationship between these movement disorders and atypical antipsychotic agents.", 
    "151": "Depressive symptoms and syndromal depression commonly occur in patients with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is also associated with aggression directed at self and others. For this article, the available literature regarding the efficacy of clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone in the treatment of depression, hostility, and suicidality in patients with schizophrenia was reviewed. These studies suggest that atypical antipsychotics may exert therapeutic effects on depression and hostility as well as psychosis and that clozapine and olanzapine may reduce suicidality in patients with schizophrenia. These therapeutic actions appear to represent additional advantages of atypical antipsychotics compared with standard agents."
