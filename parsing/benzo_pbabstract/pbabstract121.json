    "1": "We used Western blot procedures to test whether in vivo TBI in rat altered the protein expression of hippocampal GABA-A receptor subunits alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, alpha5, beta3, and gamma2 at 3 h, 6 h, 24 h, and 7 days post-injury. We then used pre-injury injections of MK-801 to block calcium influx through the NMDA receptor, diltiazem to block L-type voltage-gated calcium influx, or diazepam to enhance chloride conductance, and re-examined the protein expressions of alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, and gamma2, all of which were altered by TBI in the first study and all of which are important constituents in benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA-A receptors.", 
    "2": "Western blot analysis revealed no injury-induced alterations in protein expression for GABA-A receptor alpha2 or alpha5 subunits at any time point post-injury. Significant time-dependent changes in alpha1, alpha3, beta3, and gamma2 protein expression. The pattern of alterations to GABA-A subunits was nearly identical after diltiazem and diazepam treatment, and MK-801 normalized expression of all subunits 24 hours post-TBI.", 
    "3": "These studies are the first to demonstrate that GABA-A receptor subunit expression is altered by TBI in vivo, and these alterations may be driven by calcium-mediated cascades in hippocampal neurons. Changes in GABA-A receptors in the hippocampus after TBI may have far-reaching consequences considering their essential importance in maintaining inhibitory balance and their extensive impact on neuronal function.", 
    "4": "Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) represents the major inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system. Ethanol as well as benzodiazepines (BDZs) and some anticonvulsant drugs directly affect GABAA receptors inducing similar anxiolytic, sedativehypnotic, and anticonvulsant effects. Since BDZs have proven their efficacy in ameliorating symptoms and in decreasing the risk of seizures and delirium tremens, they are the drugs of choice for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). However, due to their addictive potential and lack of safety when combined with alcohol, BDZs are usually not recommended for the maintenance of alcohol abstinence. Other GABA-ergic medications represent potentially promising drugs useful in the treatment of AWS and in maintaining alcohol abstinence. Indeed, available studies have demonstrated that clomethiazole, gabapentin and gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) present a similar efficacy to BDZs in suppressing AWS. In addition, current evidence also indicates that gabapentin and GHB do not have significant interactions with ethanol that render them safe to use in maintaining alcohol abstinence. Moreover, gabapentin and valproic acid may be beneficial in maintaining alcohol abstinence in alcoholics with psychiatric co-morbidity. Pregabalin, neurosteroids, tiagabine, and vigabatrin need further clinical evidence of efficacy, safety and tolerability. Thus, given the importance of GABA-ergic mechanisms in the development and maintenance of alcohol dependence, and the very interesting results currently achieved, more research on GABAergic agents is warranted.", 
    "5": "Availability of new psychotropic agents, and formulations, as well as expanded indications for previously available agents, has had an impact on prescribing patterns in community psychiatric practice. This study tracked changes in patient diagnostic profiles and compared antipsychotic prescribing patterns for patients managed by a continuing care team over a 2.25-year period.", 
    "6": "Data pertaining to patient diagnoses and psychotropic medications was obtained from sequential cross-sectional file review and the pharmacy database. Data were collected in late 2004 (n = 224) and early 2007 (n = 294).", 
    "7": "The majority of patients suffered from DSM-IV schizophrenia, schizoaffective and related disorders (68% in 2004, 71% in 2007). Second generation antipsychotic (SGA) medications (79% in 2004, 99% in 2007 of all antipsychotics) were the most widely used agents. Use of quetiapine as a proportion of all oral SGAs increased (8% to 17%) as did that of long-acting risperidone (<1% to 17% of all antipsychotics) paralleled by a decline in long-acting first generation antipsychotic agents (15% to <1%).

    "9": "Midazolam is used to sedate children during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Pharmacokinetic changes are expected because of extracorporeal circulation and maturation. We present a population pharmacokinetic model for midazolam and its major metabolites in neonates during venoarterial ECMO.", 
    "10": "We studied 20 neonates on venoarterial ECMO, with a median postnatal age of 0.79 (range 0.17-5.8) days and a bodyweight of 3.0 (range 2.7-3.9) kg at the onset of ECMO. The median ECMO duration was 124 (range 70-275) hours. Serum concentrations were measured at the initiation and discontinuation of the midazolam infusion (100-300 microg/kg/h). Analysis of concentrations of midazolam, 1-hydroxymidazolam and its glucuronide were performed using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. A two-compartment model for midazolam and a one-compartment model for the metabolites 1-hydroxymidazolam and hydroxymidazolam glucuronide adequately described the data, with allometric scaling of all parameters.", 
    "11": "Following the start of ECMO, the volume of distribution of midazolam increased from 4.29 to 14.6 L/3 kg, with an elimination half-life of 1.85 hours. The median midazolam and 1-hydroxymidazolam clearance values increased 3-fold within the first 5 days (up to 1.38 and 5.31 L/h/3 kg, respectively), whereas hydroxymidazolam glucuronide clearance remained constant at 0.18 L/h/3 kg. Interpatient variability estimates of midazolam, 1-hydroxymidazolam and hydroxymidazolam glucuronide clearance and midazolam and hydroxymidazolam glucuronide volumes of distribution varied between 87% and 129%. Concomitant inotropic infusion increased hydroxymidazolam glucuronide clearance by 23%.", 
    "12": "After allometric scaling, clearance of midazolam and 1-hydroxymidazolam increases as a result of maturation or recovery from critical illness. In ECMO patients weighing 2.7-3.9 kg, continuously infused midazolam doses of 300 microg/kg/h for 6 hours and 150 microg/kg/h thereafter provide adequate serum concentrations for sedation. The dose must be increased substantially after 5-7 days. Hydroxymidazolam glucuronide accumulates during ECMO, providing an increased proportion of the overall effect, up to 34% after 7 days. Large unexplained interpatient variability warrants careful titration of sedation and adverse effects.", 
    "13": "Buprenorphine maintenance is efficacious for treating opioid dependence, but problems with diversion and misuse of buprenorphine (BUP) may limit its acceptability and dissemination. The buprenorphine/naloxone combination tablet (BNX) was developed to reduce potential problems with diversion and abuse. This paper provides data regarding the characteristics of BUP injection drug users in Malaysia and preliminary data regarding the impact of withdrawing BUP and introducing BNX. BUP was introduced in 2002 and subsequently withdrawn from the Malaysian market in 2006. BNX was introduced in 2007.", 
    "14": "A two wave survey of BUP IDUs was conducted shortly prior to BUP withdrawal from the Malaysian market (n=276) and six months after BNX was introduced (n=204). Six focus groups with BUP and/or BNX IDUs were also conducted shortly before the second wave.", 
    "15": "In addition to current BUP or BNX IDU, 96% of first wave participants and 97% second wave participants reported lifetime heroin IDU preceding the onset of their BUP/BNX IDU. Additionally, 58% of first and 64% of second wave survey participants reported current heroin IDU. Benzodiazepine abuse, often injected with BUP, was reported in both the surveys. Focus group participants reported that BNX was not as desirable as BUP, nonetheless, the results of the second wave survey suggest a continuing widespread BNX IDU, at least in Kuala Lumpur.", 
    "16": "In Malaysia, BUP and BNX IDU occur among heroin IDUs. The introduction of BNX and withdrawal of BUP may have helped to reduce, but did not eliminate the problems with diversion and abuse.", 
    "17": "Olanzapine is an antipsychotic drug that frequently induces weight gain accompanied by increased fat deposition as a side effect. To investigate how olanzapine affects different aspects of energy balance, we used male rats to determine effects on meal patterns, food preference, locomotor activity and body temperature. In two short-term experiments olanzapine was administered via osmotic minipumps. In the first experiment, we offered rats standard lab chow only. In the second experiment, we offered rats free choice between chow, sucrose and saturated fat. In a third experiment, olanzapine was chronically administered via the drinking water to determine effects on body composition. In each experiment olanzapine decreased locomotor activity and altered meal patterns. Olanzapine caused an increase in average meal size accompanied by reduced meal frequency, without clearly affecting food preference. In the chronic experiment body composition was altered, favoring adipose tissue over lean muscle mass, despite reductions in overall body weight gain. The increase in average meal size implies that the primary effect of olanzapine on feeding is an impairment of the normal satiation process. Furthermore, energy balance is clearly affected by a reduction in locomotor activity. Thus, the effects of olanzapine on adiposity do not depend solely on the presence of hyperphagia.", 
    "18": "Inadequate emergence after anesthesia in the adult patient may be distinguished by the patients' activity level into two subtypes: emergence delirium and hypoactive emergence. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of inadequate emergence in its different forms, to identify causative factors and to examine the possible influence on postoperative length of stay in the recovery room and in the hospital.", 
    "19": "In this prospective observational study, 1868 non-intubated adult patients who had been admitted to the recovery room were analyzed. Inadequate emergence was classified in its different forms according to the Richmond agitation and sedation scale (RASS) 10 minutes after admission to the recovery room. Emergence delirium was defined as a RASS score >or=+1, and hypoactive emergence was defined as a RASS score <or=-2.", 
    "20": "Of the 1,868 patients, 153 (8.2%) displayed symptoms of inadequate emergence: 93 patients (5.0%) screened positive for emergence delirium, and 60 patients (3.2%) showed hypoactive emergence. Significant risk factors for emergence delirium were premedication with benzodiazepines, induction of anesthesia with etomidate, younger as well as older age (age below 40 years and over 64 years), higher postoperative pain scores (NRS 6-10) and musculoskeletal surgery. Risk factors for hypoactive emergence were younger age, long duration of surgery and intraabdominal surgery. Patients with hypoactive emergence had a significantly increased length of stay in the hospital.", 
    "21": "Inadequate emergence after anesthesia is a frequent complication. Preventable risk factors for emergence delirium were induction of anesthesia with etomidate, premedication with benzodiazepines and higher postoperative pain scores. Hypoactive emergence was less frequent than emergence delirium and was associated with a longer postoperative hospital stay.", 
    "22": "High-potency benzodiazepines, such as clonazepam, are frequently used in the treatment of panic disorder (PD) because of their rapid onset of action and good tolerability. However, there is concern about their potential to cause withdrawal symptoms. We aimed to develop a protocol for safely tapering off clonazepam in patients with PD who had been receiving treatment for at least 3 years. A specific scale for judging withdrawal was also developed, the Composite Benzodiazepine Discontinuation Symptom Scale. We selected 73 patients with PD who had been asymptomatic for at least 1 year and who wished to discontinue the medication. The trial consisted of a 4-month period of tapering and an 8-month follow-up period. The dosage of clonazepam was decreased by 0.5 mg per 2-week period until 1 mg per day was reached, followed by a decrease of 0.25 mg per week. The mean dosage at the start of tapering was 2.7 +/- 1.2 mg/d. In total, 51 (68.9%) of the patients were free of the medication after the 4 months of tapering according to the protocol, and 19 (26.0%) of the patients needed another 3 months to be free of medication. Clonazepam discontinuation symptoms were mostly mild and included mainly: anxiety, shaking/trembling/tremor, nausea/vomiting, insomnia/nightmares, excessive sweating, tachycardia/palpitations, headache, weakness, and muscle aches. The improvement in PD and general well-being was maintained during both the taper and follow-up phases. Clonazepam can be successfully discontinued without any major withdrawal symptoms if the dose is reduced gradually. We recommend reducing the dosage of clonazepam after intermediate-term use by 0.25 mg/wk.",

More significant differences were found early in the treatment. In the post hoc analysis, the patients who received intramuscular olanzapine or orally disintegrating olanzapine tablets showed significantly greater improvement in PANSS-EC scores than did patients who received intramuscular haloperidol at points 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 minutes after injection.", 
    "26": "These findings suggest that intramuscular olanzapine, orally disintegrating olanzapine tablets, and oral risperidone solution are as effective treatments as intramuscular haloperidol for patients with acute agitation. Intramuscular olanzapine and disintegrating olanzapine tablets are more effective than intramuscular haloperidol in the early phase of the intervention. There is no significant difference in effectiveness among intramuscular olanzapine, orally disintegrating olanzapine tablets, and oral risperidone solution.",

Data concerning additional doses of midazolam, procedural time, recovery time in the outpatient ward, blood pressure values, percutaneous arterial oxygen saturation values, side effects of the medications used, and patient discomfort via a visual analogue scale (VAS) were collected and analysed. The ondansetron group received less additional midazolam than the metoclopramide and placebo groups (ondansetron group: 0.6 \u00b1 0.7 mg; metoclopramide group: 1.9 \u00b1 0.9 mg; and placebo group: 2.1 \u00b1 0.8 mg; P < 0,001).

This work aims to show the development of an analytical method based on adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (AdCSV) for the simultaneous determination of 1,4-benzodiazepines and amfepramone. The developed method was used to measure seven benzodiazepines (clonazepam, flurazepam, alprazolam, midazolam, medazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and diazepam) and amfepramone in slimming formulations that have been commercialized in Brazil. This method permits the screening of adulterant classes in a single voltammetric run by using a hanging mercury drop electrode as a working electrode and Ringer buffer (pH 10.0) as a supporting electrolyte. Recovery values ranging from 92.0% to 117.0% demonstrate the reliability of the method in the determination of adulterants in real samples. Among the 12 samples studied by the proposed method, 4 were demonstrated to be adulterated by 1,4-benzodiazepines.",

Socio-demographic, premorbid and clinical variables were studied in a population of 95 diagnosed with schizophrenia, as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSMIV), during an acute treated phase, in a multicentre prospective study. Patients were assigned to olanzapine or risperidone treatment in an open design. Clinical evaluations were performed at D0, D42 and D180. Good response to treatment was defined as a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) reduction greater than 20% and a Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score lower than 35. Univariate analysis revealed earlier age at onset of schizophrenia and earlier age at first prescription of antipsychotic among non-responders compared with good responders at D42. Non-responders also had a clinical profile at the onset of antipsychotic treatment characterised by more severe forms of the acute episode as shown by higher scores at the positive, general and overall PANSS scale and on CGI-S and BPRS scores. With a multivariate logistic regression model, age at onset and overall duration of illness remained the only clinical criteria identified as predictors of response to antipsychotic treatment at D42. Clinical variables do not clearly appear to be good predictors of treatment efficacy.",

BZD induces a further reduction of slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, whereas SWS and REM values remain decreased during non-BZD administration. There is evidence indicating that the nonselective serotonin 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor antagonists, ritanserin, ketanserin, seganserin and ICI-169369, the selective 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist eplivanserin and the 5-HT(2A) receptor inverse agonist pimavanserin, increase SWS in subjects with normal sleep. In addition, it has been shown that prior administration of ritanserin prevents the nitrazepam-induced suppression of SWS in normal subjects. Of note, ritanserin also induced an increase of SWS in poor sleepers, patients with chronic primary insomnia and psychiatric patients with a generalized anxiety disorder or a mood disorder. The 5-HT(2A) receptor inverse agonist APD-125 gave rise to a similar effect in patients with chronic primary insomnia. Thus, presently available evidence tends to indicate that the association of a 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist or a 5-HT(2A) receptor inverse agonist with a BZD or a non-BZD hypnotic could be a valid alternative to normalize SWS in patients with primary or comorbid insomnia.", 
    "48": "Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic was first introduced in 1996 as an oral formulation and is used in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Recent developments have included parenteral formulations to improve compliance in the treatment of schizophrenia and to treat agitation in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar mania. Olanzapine pamoate long acting injection (depot) is a novel formulation of the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine, which is licensed for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia. When administered as the pamoate salt, olanzapine has an elimination half-life of approximately 30 days, allowing it to be given at 2- or 4-weekly intervals. An 8-week, randomized, double-blind study in 404 patients acutely ill with schizophrenia demonstrated significant antipsychotic efficacy (versus placebo). A 24-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study in 1,065 schizophrenia patients stabilized with oral olanzapine demonstrated the depot formulation could delay exacerbation of positive symptoms or hospitalization. Apart from local injection reactions and a postinjection delirium/sedation syndrome, no new adverse events additional to those seen with oral olanzapine have been notedto date. The pivotal clinical trials of olanzapine rapid-acting intramuscular injection are reviewed in addition to post-hoc analyses, controlled and naturalistic studies since its launch.",

Two participants (30 mg) experienced changes in their electrocardiogram (trigeminy and prolongation of QRS complex) that met the criteria for dose-limiting adverse events. No significant respiratory depression was noted during the study. The midazolam doses studied exhibited a median t(max) of 0.5 hours with a geometric mean terminal elimination half-life value of 4.1 hours (range, 2.9-4.5 hours). The extent of systemic exposure, assessed by area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (C(max)), tended to increase proportionally with increasing doses from 5 to 30 mg; however, for the male 30-mg group, there was evidence of a larger than proportional increase in AUC.",

Newborns of mothers exposed to anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are at increased risk for major congenital malformations, cognitive impairment and fetal death. Cord-blood lymphocytes of the newborns whose mothers received long-term AEDs therapy during pregnancy were used in this study. There were 37 newborns (Group A), divided into two subgroups, i.e. from mothers receiving mono-therapy (A1) and from those receiving poly-therapy (A2). The major drugs given to the pregnant women with epilepsy in mono-therapy were valproic acid (VPA) and carbamazepine (CBZ) analogues. In poly-therapy, besides VPA and CBZ derivatives also phenyltriazine, sulphanamide, benzodiazepines and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) derivatives were administered. Three kinds of in vitro cytogenetic test were applied: the chromosome aberration (CA) assay, the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) assay, and the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN). In addition, the mitotic index (MI), the replication index (RI) and the nuclear division index (NDI) were determined. The mean number of CA/cell (excluding gaps) for group A did not differ statistically significantly from the negative controls (p>0.1), nor did the mean MI value (p>0.1). In group A, the mean number of SCE/cell was statistically significantly higher compared with the negative control (p<0.05). The mean RI value for group A did not demonstrate statistically significant differences (p>0.1). The mean MN number for group A was higher than in the negative control, but this difference was on the border of statistical significance (p=0.07). The value of NDI for group A did not differ significantly from the value in the negative control (p>0.1).

    "56": "The aim of the study was to determine drug concentration ratios between oral fluid collected with the Intercept device and whole blood. Samples of blood and oral fluid were obtained from patients admitted to acute psychiatric treatment and drivers suspected of drugged driving. Samples were analyzed for illegal drugs, benzodiazepines, opioids, carisoprodol, and meprobamate. Drugs were detected in samples of both blood and oral fluid from 59 subjects; altogether, 17 different drugs were found. Concentration ratios between oral fluid and blood were determined for all cases. The distributions of drug concentration ratios were wide for most drugs and do not allow reliable estimations of drug concentrations in blood using concentrations in oral fluid. The median oral fluid/blood drug concentration ratios for the most prevalent drugs were 0.036 diazepam, 0.027 nordiazepam, 7.1 amphetamine, 2.9 methamphetamine, 5.4 codeine, 1.9 morphine, and 4.7 tetrahydrocannabinol. The correlation coefficients between drug concentrations in oral fluid and blood ranged from 0.15 to 0.96 for the six most prevalent drugs.", 
    "57": "Women who are pregnant and who have a history of psychosis are commonly managed with antipsychotic medications. The evidence regarding the use of antipsychotics in pregnancy has been insufficient to provide adequate support for this practice and is a concern for clinicians and women alike. This review presents literature surrounding the use of antipsychotic medications in pregnancy, providing an overview of the historical and contemporary perspectives which influence clinicians prescribing practices. Data were sourced from Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFo, using the terms antipsychotics with pregnancy and psychosis or schizophrenia. This was expanded to include the most common atypical antipsychotics: olanzapine, risperidone, clozapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone and aripiprazole. Literature was found reporting the use of antipsychotic medications in pregnancy since the introduction of antipsychotics in the 1950s, comprising mainly of authors' reviews of the literature, case studies, retrospective reports, drug company registries and more recently a prospective comparative study. This review identifies that the literature provides no clear answer for clinicians as to the risk associated with the use of antipsychotics in pregnancy. To this effect, recently in Australia, the National Register of Antipsychotic Medications in Pregnancy was established to prospectively collect information regarding outcomes for mother and baby, when antipsychotic medications have been used during pregnancy.",

The database was screened for epilepsy by integrating the clinical and ancillary work-up as well as the drug regimen. The use of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) was evaluated among the cataract patients and the controls. The main outcome measure was the prevalence of epilepsy and antiepileptic medical treatment among patients undergoing cataract surgery versus controls.",

The central modality of treatment at this centre is the use of methadone maintenance. Among those patients entering this program there seems to be an emerging pattern of males who tend to use heroin as their opiate of choice, and are more likely to combine it with cannabis, while females are more likely to use to street methadone, with adjunctive use of ketamine, benzodiazepines, hypnotic drugs and/or amphetamines. Women are at higher risk of abusing opioids through a pathway of initial prescription painkiller use, and later to resort to street methadone to cope with prescription pain killer addiction. This latter pattern seems to result in an increased risk for fatal accidental overdoses. The use of these longer-acting agents in women may be influenced by psychosocial and hormonal factors.",

A compensated diabetes and a chronic, slowly progressive sensory-motor Neuropathy are relevant somatic comorbidities. Because of anxiety attacks complicating his progressively severe depression he could not be cared adequately in the old people home he lived in and was hospitalised. The anxiety responded well to Benzodiazepines, but the severe depression persisted despite a pharmacotherapy with Lithium, Mianserin and Citalopran. He was therefore transferred into a nursing home. There he demanded - supported by his son - an assisted suicide. 2 psychiatrists judged his wish to die as independent to his actual depression, a geronto-psychiatrist judged his suicidal ideas as a typical symptom of depression. Therefore the demanded assisted suicide was not allowed in the nursing home according to communal legal rules not allowing assisted suicide of persons with psychiatric illness in communal institutions. A hospitalisation against his own and his son's will was however not done and the assisted suicide was executed in privacy. This in Switzerland is legal even in cases of severe chronic psychiatric illness without a terminal disease.",

The data concerning such risks caused the Italian Ministry of Health to release a statement discouraging doctors from prescribing olanzapine and risperidone outside of the registered indications, in May 2004. This study aimed to analyze the prescriptive profile of AAs in patients with dementia, in terms of the choice of active substance and of the clinical characteristics of the patients.",

For each subject, the following information was collected: the frequency of prescriptions, the drug received, and the amount of AAs in the considered period. In the third year of observation, the intensity of treatment was evaluated (intense treatment: >300 tablets of any AA; weak treatment: <300 tablets of any AA or up to three packages of risperidone drops). Such data were analyzed in terms of the type of dementia, the behavioral disturbance, and the possible presence of psychomotor agitation. In addition, the adverse reactions that occurred during the treatment were gathered. Lastly, the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors among the selected subjects was described.",

The doses used for the control of behavioral disturbances during dementia were on average much lower than those for treating more severe psychoses. Among the patients followed in the third year of observation (n = 159), the number of subjects in intense treatment was greater than those in weak treatment (60 vs 40%). Olanzapine was the AA most frequently used in intense dosages. Among the patients in weak treatment, about 50% used risperidone, available as oral droplets. In the patients at the Geriatric Center (n = 174), in the initial period of analysis 10 adverse events were observed and out of these 10 subjects, all of whom were under intense treatment , 8 out of 10 took quetiapine.

    "83": "Preclinical data have shown that addition of the selective norepinephrine transporter (NET) inhibitor reboxetine increases the antipsychotic-like effect of the D(2/3) antagonist raclopride and, in parallel, enhances cortical dopamine output. Subsequent clinical results suggested that adding reboxetine to stable treatments with various antipsychotic drugs (APDs) may improve positive, negative and depressive symptoms in schizophrenia. In this study, we investigated in rats the effects of adding reboxetine to the second-generation APD olanzapine on: (i) antipsychotic efficacy, using the conditioned avoidance response (CAR) test, (ii) extrapyramidal side effect (EPS) liability, using a catalepsy test, (iii) dopamine efflux in the medial prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens, using in vivo microdialysis in freely moving animals and (iv) cortical N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated transmission, using intracellular electrophysiological recording in vitro. Reboxetine (6 mg/kg) enhanced the suppression of CAR induced by a suboptimal dose (1.25 mg/kg), but not an optimal (2.5 mg/kg) dose of olanzapine without any concomitant catalepsy. Addition of reboxetine to the low dose of olanzapine also markedly increased cortical dopamine outflow and facilitated prefrontal NMDA receptor-mediated transmission. Our data suggest that adjunctive treatment with a NET inhibitor may enhance the therapeutic effect of low-dose olanzapine in schizophrenia without increasing EPS liability and add an antidepressant action, thus in principle allowing for a dose reduction of olanzapine with a concomitant reduction of dose-related side effects, such as EPS and weight gain.", 
    "84": "Furanocoumarins in grapefruit are known to show inhibitory effects against P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and CYP3A4 in intestinal epithelial cells; however, furanocoumarin derivatives are widely contained in the plants of Rutaceae and Umbelliferae families, which are used as components of Kampo extract medicines. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of 12 furanocoumarins extracted from plants in the Umbelliferae family against P-gp and CYP3A4 activity. Furthermore, we studied their inhibitory effect on P-gp when furanocoumarins are used as Kampo extract medicine rather than as an isolated single compound. From screening of the CYP3A4 inhibitory effect, notopterol and rivulobirin A, the only dimer types of furanocoumarin, were found to be potent inhibitors of CYP3A4. On the other hand, byakangelicol and rivulobirin A showed strong P-gp inhibition from the screening of P-gp inhibitor evaluated by quinidine permeation through the Caco-2 monolayer; however, the chemical structural relationship of furanocoumarins between P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitory effects could not be obtained. We also investigated the effect of these furanocoumarins on the transport of digoxin through the Caco-2 monolayer. The inhibitory effect of rivulobirin A was more potent than that of byakangelicol. Application of either Senkyu-cha-cho-san or Sokei-kakketsu-to, which are composed of herbal remedies in the Umbelliferae group, significantly decreased the efflux ratio of digoxin. In conclusion, it was found that some furanocoumarins extracted from the plants in the Umbelliferae family strongly inhibited P-gp and CYP3A4. Kampo extract medicines containing herbal remedies belonging to the Umbelliferae family may cause a drug-drug interaction with P-gp or a CYP3A4 substrate drug.", 
    "85": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of ethanol on the sleep-wake cycle in normal rats and sleep-disturbed rats. In normal rats, no significant difference was observed by ethanol in sleep latency, total awake time and total non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep time, except for total REM sleep time. On the other hand, in sleep-disturbed rats, ethanol at doses of 1 and 2 g/kg caused significant decreases in sleep latency and total wake time, and an increase in total NREM sleep time. In addition, ethanol showed a significant increase in delta activity in the sleep-disturbed model rat, different from triazolam. These results suggested that ethanol had not only a hypnotic but also a sleep-maintaining effect in sleep-disturbed rats at reasonable blood ethanol concentrations.", 
    "86": "A rapid method for the simultaneous determination of 42 psychoactive drugs and their metabolites (barbitals, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, etc. ) in human plasma and urine was developed using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). After a simple protein precipitation step, the analysis of the drugs and the metabolites was achieved on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column by using the gradient elution with ammonium acetate and methanol-acetonitrile (1: 1, v/v) as the mobile phases, and detected by electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode operated simultaneously in both positive and negative modes by rapid switching, and quantified by matrix-match standard solution. The average recoveries were 60.2% - 125% and 64.5% - 126% for the drugs in plasma and urine except those of perphenazine, thioridazine and chloropromazine in plasma were 37.6% - 57.5%, 36.3% - 48.3%, 52.4% -67.4%, respectively; trazodone and diazepam in urine were 100% -142% and 108% - 177%, respectively. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of all the drugs in plasma and urine were within 0.8% - 26% and 2.6%18% (n = 6), respectively. The detection limits of the 4 barbitals ranged from 20 to 100 mg/L and those of the other drugs ranged from 0.05 to 2.0 mg/L. The method is simple, selective and sensitive to detect drugs for both clinical and forensic purposes.", 
    "87": "Migration of megakaryocytes (MKs) from the proliferative osteoblastic niche to the capillary-rich vascular niche is essential for proplatelet formation and platelet release. In this study, we explore the role of surface glycoprotein receptors and signaling proteins in regulating MK migration and platelet recovery after immune-induced thrombocytopenia. We show that spreading and migration of mouse primary bone marrow-derived MKs on a fibronectin matrix are abolished by the Src family kinases inhibitor PP1, the Syk kinase inhibitor R406 and the integrin alphaIIbbeta3 antagonist lotrafiban. We also demonstrate that these responses are inhibited in primary phospholipase C gamma2 (PLCgamma2)-deficient MKs. Conversely, MK spreading and migration were unaltered in the absence of the collagen receptor, the glycoprotein VI-FcRgamma-chain complex. We previously reported a correlation between a defect in MK migration and platelet recovery in the absence of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 and the tyrosine phosphatase CD148. This correlation also holds for mice deficient in PLCgamma2. This study identifies a model in which integrin signaling via Src family kinases and Syk kinase to PLCgamma2 is required for MK spreading, migration, and platelet formation.", 
    "88": "Metabolic syndrome and elevated lipids, related to cardiovascular risk factors, are more prevalent in schizophrenia and there has been much debate about the extent to which specific antipsychotics contribute more to the increased risk of developing hyperlipidemia and metabolic syndrome. Most studies have concentrated on fasting levels in patients recently started on medication. Randomized prospective studies of metabolic effects of 2nd generation antipsychotics using both fasting measures and provocative tests may provide results that are more informative. We present results of a randomized prospective study of lipid metabolism and metabolic syndrome in chronic schizophrenic patients using both fasting and post-prandial lipid measures.", 
    "89": "Hospitalized patients with chronic schizophrenia, most of whom had been treated with multiple antipsychotics in the past, were randomly assigned to treatment with a single antipsychotic, olanzapine or risperidone, for a period of 5 months. At baseline and every treatment month thereafter, fasting levels of lipids, free fatty acid (FFA) and leptin were assessed. At baseline and end of month 2 of treatment patients had a fatty meal test (FMT) in which postprandial lipids were measured at several time points before and after meal ingestion. Weight was assessed monthly and waist measures were taken at baseline and month 5. Data was analyzed on 23 patients randomized to risperidone and 23 patients randomized to olanzapine.", 
    "90": "Overall, there were no differential drug effects on any fasting lipid measure and fasting triglycerides did not increase in olanzapine treated patients after 5 months of treatment. However, at 2 months of drug treatment the FMT revealed a significantly greater increase in triglycerides, and very low density (VLDL) cholesterol and triglycerides, in olanzapine compared to risperidone patients (Ps=.05-.01). There was no difference between treatments with olanzapine vs. risperidone on development of metabolic syndrome during the 5 month treatment period.", 
    "91": "Chronic schizophrenic patients treated for years with first and second generation antipsychotics may have developed tolerance to the effects of olanzapine on increasing fasting triglycerides and other lipids, but some underlying metabolic abnormalities may be revealed in postprandial tests of lipid metabolism. These findings suggest that the development of standardized tests and criteria for measurement of postprandial triglycerides and related lipid levels, in addition to fasting levels, may be helpful in identifying metabolic effects of olanzapine and other second generation antipsychotics in chronically treated schizophrenics. In some reports postprandial increases in triglycerides have been identified as important risk factors for cardiovascular disease, but the actual differential consequences of these lipid metabolic differences for development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease in patients treated with different antipsychotics need more objective outcome measures to determine and quantify cardiovascular risk outcomes.", 
    "92": "In this work, a multipumping flow system (MPFS) coupled to a photodegradation unit was developed, for the first time, for the determination of diazepam (a benzodiazepine) in spiked alcoholic beverages by fluorimetry. The main features of MPFS such as, high portability, versatility and straightforward automation and control combined with the efficiency and simplicity of photodegradation and the selectivity and sensitivity of fluorimetric detection makes the developed analytical methodology an attractive tool and a valuable contribution for the prevention of drug-facilitated crimes (DFC). Drug-facilitated crimes involve the unauthorized administration of strong central nervous system depressant drugs, which have the capability of preventing victims from resist to the action of the perpetrator or fighting off. Most often, the drugs identified as being used in DFC are surreptitiously placed in drinks served to potential victims in entertainment places, like night clubs. Five commercial alcoholic beverages (Eristoff, Smirnoff, Bacardi, Dry Gin and Brazilian Cacha\u00e7a 51) spiked with diazepam were analyzed by the proposed methodology, and the results revealed good agreement with those obtained through a HPLC comparison procedure. Relative deviations comprised between -1.97 and 2.05% were achieved, and additionally, the application of a paired t-test, revealed the absence of any statistical difference for a confidence level of 95% (n=5). The detection limit was approximately 2.02 mg L(-1).", 
    "93": "Reactivation of memories may render them labile and subject to disruption by amnestic drugs thus reducing their impact on future behavior, but whether it is possible with well-established memories is not known. Here we examined the effect of two amnestic agents on reconsolidation of a conditioned place preference (CPP) for morphine when memory strength and memory age were varied. In a three-compartment apparatus animals received 4 or 8 experiences of morphine in one compartment and saline in the alternative compartment. The memory was then reactivated drug-free, and immediately afterwards animals received an injection of propranolol (10mg/kg, SC), midazolam (1mg/kg, IP), both amnestic agents combined, or saline. Animals conditioned with 4 pairings were re-tested 2 and 7 days after reactivation. After conditioning with 8 drug experiences memories were reactivated and treated 8 times, once every 48h, beginning 1 or 30 days after training. Propranolol, midazolam and their combination, disrupted reconsolidation for weak memories (4 pairings), but had little effect on stronger memories (8 pairings) reactivated 1 day after training. Extending the reactivation-amnestic treatments to 8 sessions did not disrupt the strong memory. Delaying reactivation sessions by 30 days enabled all three amnestic treatments to disrupt reconsolidation. Repeating amnestic treatment appeared to increase the effect of midazolam, but combining propranolol and midazolam did not enhance the amnestic effect. The amount of training and the age of the memory may be boundary conditions for reconsolidation.", 
    "94": "Maternal aggression (maternal defense) is exhibited by lactating females towards intruders and contributes to the protection of offspring. Enhancement of Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptor signaling by benzodiazepines elevates maternal aggression, and we previously found indirect evidence (via c-Fos immunohistochemistry) that caudal periaqueductal gray (cPAG) and lateral septum (LS) could be sites where benzodiazepines increase aggression. We recently found that GABA(A) receptor signaling in LS modulates maternal aggression, and in this study, we tested the hypothesis that GABA(A) receptor signaling in cPAG also regulates this behavior. Site-directed injections to cPAG were made in lactating mice using the GABA(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline (3-9 ng) or the GABA(A) receptor positive modulator, chlordiazepoxide (CDP), a benzodiazepine (2.5-20 microg). Maternal aggression, other maternal behaviors, and anxiety-like measures (using the light-dark box) were then examined. GABA(A) receptor positive modulator did not increase aggression, which could have resulted from a ceiling effect. However, 8 ng and 9 ng of bicuculline in cPAG significantly decreased maternal aggression without altering other maternal behaviors or light-dark box performance, suggesting some GABA(A) receptor signaling in cPAG is required for full maternal aggression expression. Additionally, 7 ng of bicuculline significantly increased licking/grooming of pups, and decreased the number of transitions between the light and dark compartments of the light-dark box without affecting aggression. Given these results indicating that antagonizing GABA(A) receptor in cPAG dose-dependently promotes offspring grooming behavior while impairing aggression, it is possible that the cPAG represents a key site for decision making (aggression versus other behaviors) in the lactating female.",

    "97": "For total Delta BMI we found greater similarity in antipsychotic-induced BMI change in MZ twin pairs than in sib pairs (intrapair difference) with a heritability of h(2) = 0.6, but not for atypical Delta BMI, possibly because of a genetically influenced weight plateau achieved under antipsychotic medication.",

However, in comparative trials with a benzodiazepine agent, carbamazepine's ability to prevent alcohol withdrawal seizures (OR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.06-14.97, P = NS) and delirium tremens (DTs; OR = 1.25; 95% CI = 0.28-5.64, P = NS) was uncertain as a result of insufficient patient enrollment. In three trials, carbamazepine failed to reduce alcohol withdrawal symptoms possibly as a result of delayed administration, inadequate dosage or inadequate sample size. At daily doses of 800 mg either fixed or tapered over 5-9 days, carbamazepine was well tolerated, and safely administered when blood alcohol concentration dropped below 0.15%. The role of oxcarbazepine in AWS is undefined because of inconsistent findings in two trials.", 
    "106": "Carbamazepine has demonstrated safety, tolerability and efficacy in treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of alcohol withdrawal in the inpatient setting. However, trials of carbamazepine provide inconclusive evidence for prevention of alcohol withdrawal seizures and DTs in comparison with benzodiazepines.

    "107": "The relationship between postmortem concentrations of morphine and co-detected psychoactive drugs in fatal overdoses is examined. Morphine and other drugs were detected in 161 medicolegal autopsy cases. Subsets of these morphine-positive cases based on drug class were established, including opioids, antidepressants, ethanol, benzodiazepines, and \"other.\" Each subset was split into high or low concentration groups based on median drug concentrations. Morphine concentrations of the [high] and [low] groups were compared, with no significant difference in morphine concentration identified in the opioid, ethanol, or benzodiazepine subsets. The \"other\" drug class was too heterogeneous for statistical assessment. Morphine concentrations did show a significant direct relationship (p = 0.01) with antidepressants, namely increased concentrations of antidepressant drugs are associated with an increased concentration of morphine. This trend probably remains even after excluding cocaine-positive cases. The unsuspected finding that postmortem concentrations of antidepressants positively correlate with morphine levels may be important in the treatment of depression in drug addicts.", 
    "108": "There is vast evidence for the superiority of agonist treatments (methadone, buprenorphine) over a withdrawal approach in opioid-dependent populations. Little research, however, has been conducted on the same approach for the treatment of high-dose benzodiazepine (BZD) dependence. Even large-scale reviews and meta-analyses discussing treatment strategies for benzodiazepine-dependent patients focus solely upon approaches that aim at achieving abstinence, namely on complete BZD withdrawal. While the types of interventions differ (e.g. gradual benzodiazepine taper with a long or a short half-life benzodiazepine, switching to non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics or prescribing adjunctive medications such as antidepressants or anticonvulsants on an in- or out-patient basis), the common aim of treatment still is total abstinence from benzodiazepines. However, the majority of patients suffering from high-dose BZD dependence do not succeed with long-term abstinence, irrespective of the procedure, and clinicians have been using BZD 'substitution' treatment in such cases for decades. Therefore, we suggest the evaluation of a substitution approach in this group, consisting of maintenance treatment with a slow-onset, long-acting BZD. Advantages of such a procedure may be improved health, less craving, fewer withdrawal complications, reduced anxiety, increased treatment retention, improvements in social functioning and less illegal activity. Cognitive impairments, the most problematic side effects of substitution treatment with benzodiazepines, could possibly be minimized by using an optimal agonist.", 
    "109": "Despite the increasing concern about gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) toxicity in users, no studies have addressed GHB and other club drugs effects on the immune system under controlled administration. Lymphocyte subsets and functional responsiveness of lymphocytes to mitogenic stimulation were measured in 10 healthy male recreational users of GHB who participated in five experimental sessions within the framework of a clinical trial. The study was randomized, double blind, double dummy and cross-over. Drug conditions were: a single oral dose of GHB (40 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg), ethanol (0.7 g/kg), flunitrazepam (1.25 mg) and placebo. Acute GHB produced a time-dependent immune impairment in the first 4 hours after drug administration associated with an increase in cortisol secretion. Although total leukocyte count remained unchanged, there was a significant decrease in the CD4 T/CD8 T-cell ratio, as well as in the percentage of mature T lymphocytes, probably because of a decrease in both the percentage and absolute number of T helper cells. A significant decrease was also observed in natural killer cells and in functional responsiveness of lymphocytes to mitogenic stimulation. Flunitrazepam administration did not produce any change in the immune system, while ethanol intake produced a decrease in B lymphocytes and in lymphocyte proliferative response to mitogens. These results provide the first evidence that GHB intake under a controlled environmental setting impairs the immunological status and confirms the alterations in the immune function caused by ethanol.",

Three second-generation AEDs (gabapentin, topiramate, and lamotrigine) were recently approved in Japan. Levetiracetam is currently under review for approval by the Japanese regulatory agency. An ideal AED would have a broad-spectrum activity to control multiple types of seizures, favorable safety profile, limited potential for drug-drug interaction, many bioequivalent formulations, long half life to allow infrequent administration, and antiepileptogenic effects that may provide a fundamental cure of epileptic patients by suppressing the development of epileptogenic network and neutralizing previously established epileptogenic foci in the brain. The second-generation AEDs have been developed to possess some of these ideal properties. All the second-generation AEDs are efficacious for the treatment of patients with partial seizures. In addition, levetiracetam, topiramate, lamotrigine, and zonisamide are effective for the treatment of patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, absences, myoclonic seizures, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and West syndrome; however, lamotrigine is not effective for the treatment of patients with myoclonic seizures. Rufinamide and felbamate are useful for the treatment of patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome; however owing to its serious adverse effects, including aplastic anemia and hepatic failure, felbamate is used as the last resort for the treatment of patients with intractable seizures. Vigabatrin is particularly effective for the treatment of patients with West syndrome; however, the patients need to be regularly monitored for the development of peripheral visual field defect. Gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, vigabatrin, and tiagabine are ineffective for the treatment of patients with absences and/or myoclonic seizures and may aggravate these conditions. Treatment with levetiracetam or topiramate (off-label use) is the new option for patients with refractory status epilepticus, which is characterized by downregulation of the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid system, because these drugs act via different mechanisms and are rapidly titratable, especially intravenous levetiracetam. The pharmacokinetic profiles of levetiracetam, gabapentin, and pregabalin are favorable: these drugs exhibit minimal protein binding, do not undergo hepatic metabolism, are not involved in any clinically relevant drug interactions, and rarely lead to the development of serious adverse effects. In general, levetiracetam is probably the closest to being the ideal AED because of its broad-spectrum favorable pharmacokinetic profile and safety profile as well as because of the availability of its parenteral formulation. Among the injectable AEDs, fosphenytoin is a water-soluble prodrug and is used to treat patients with status epilepticus. Systemic and local side effects of this drug are fewer than those of phenytoin. Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine is used as the first-line AED for the treatment of patients with status epilepticus. The effects of this drug are more prolonged than those of diazepam. Intravenous administration of valproic acid is regarded as a new treatment option for patients with status epilepticus, because sedative and negative effects on the cardiorespiratory system of this drug are lesser than those of the traditional injectable AEDs. These novel medications will aid the improvement of the quality of life of epileptic patients through improved seizure control and reduced adverse effects.",

Also 27 marketed drugs were selected to evaluate the reproducibility of Cypex assay using 7-benzyloxyquinoline (7-BQ) as second probe substrate for CYP3A4. Furthermore Cypex CYP2D6 was used to evaluate the reproducibility of this system using 4-methylaminomethyl-7-methoxycoumarin (MMC) as probe substrate with 15 marketed drugs.

Only 5 of the variant 56 compounds had higher IC50 values with the recombinant enzymes, whereas 38 had lower IC50 values with the recombinant cypex CYP3A4 enzyme. The Cypex assay is comparable to PHLM assay in terms of predictivity and reproducibility. The Cypex assay therefore offers a higher throughput, reproducible alternative to PHLM for placement earlier in the lead optimisation process.

    "165": "Vertical ionization energies (VIEs) of medazepam, nordazepam and their molecular subunits have been calculated using the electron propagator method in the P3/CEP-31G* approximation. Vertical electron affinities (VEAs) have been obtained with a \u2206SCF procedure at the DFT-B3LYP/6-31+G* level of theory. Excellent correlations have been achieved between IE(calc) and IE(exp), allowing reliable assignment of the ionization processes. Our proposed assignment differs in many instances from that previously reported in the literature. The electronic structure of the frontier Dyson orbitals shows that the IE and EA values of the benzodiazepines can be modulated by substitution at the benzene rings. Hardness values, evaluated as (IE - EA)/2, follow the trend of the experimental singlet transition energies. Medazepam is a less hard (i.e., less stable) compound than nordazepam.", 
    "166": "Benzodiazepine withdrawal anxiety is associated with potentiation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptor (AMPAR) currents in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons attributable to increased synaptic incorporation of GluA1-containing AMPARs. The contribution of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) to enhanced glutamatergic synaptic strength during withdrawal from 1-week oral flurazepam (FZP) administration was further examined in hippocampal slices. As earlier reported, AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude increased in CA1 neurons from 1- and 2-day FZP-withdrawn rats, along with increased single-channel conductance in neurons from 2-day rats, estimated by non-stationary noise analysis. Input-output curve slope was increased without a change in paired-pulse facilitation, suggesting increased AMPAR postsynaptic efficacy rather than altered glutamate release. The increased mEPSC amplitude and AMPAR conductance were related to CaMKII activity, as intracellular inclusion of CaMKIINtide or autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide, but not scrambled peptide, prevented both AMPAR amplitude and conductance changes. mEPSC inhibition by 1-naphthyl acetyl spermine and the negative shift in rectification index at both withdrawal time points were consistent with functional incorporation of GluA2-lacking AMPARs. GluA1 but not GluA2 or GluA3 levels were increased in immunoblots of postsynaptic density (PSD)-enriched subcellular fractions of CA1 minislices from 1-day FZP-withdrawn rats, when mEPSC amplitude, but not conductance, was increased. Both GluA1 expression levels and CaMKII alpha-mediated GluA1 Ser(831) phosphorylation were increased in PSD-subfractions from 2-day FZP-withdrawn rats. As phospho-Thr(286)CaMKII alpha was unchanged, CaMKII alpha may be activated through an alternative signaling pathway. Synaptic insertion and subsequent CaMKII alpha-mediated Ser(831) phosphorylation of GluA1 homomers contribute to benzodiazepine withdrawal-induced AMPAR potentiation and may represent an important hippocampal pathway mediating both drug-induced and activity-dependent plasticity.",

    "169": "Coadministration of grapefruit juice (GFJ) has been proposed to enhance the systemic availability and decrease the required dose of drugs such as cyclosporine that are extensively metabolized in the intestine and liver. Although GFJ inhibits human cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, effects on dog CYP have not yet been reported. Consequently, we determined whether GFJ inhibits triazolam hydroxylation by Beagle dog liver microsomes (DLM) using human liver microsomes (HLM) as positive control. Results were compared with the effects of lyophilized GFJ and commercially-available powdered grapefruit capsules, which may be more convenient dosage forms. GFJ inhibited alpha-hydroxytriazolam formation in both DLM and HLM with similar IC(50) (inhibitor concentration producing a 50% decrease in reaction velocity) values of 0.56% and 0.52% (v/v), respectively. Lyophilized GFJ and powdered grapefruit also inhibited DLM alpha-hydroxytriazolam formation with IC(50) values of 0.76 and 1.2 mg/mL, respectively. Consistent with mechanism-based enzyme inhibition, preincubation of DLM with any of the grapefruit products for 20 min resulted in significant enhancement of inhibition of triazolam alpha-hydroxylation by 8-20%. The results indicate that 16 g of lyophilized GFJ or 23 g of powdered grapefruit would be equivalent to dosing 100 mL of GFJ. In vivo pharmacokinetic interaction studies are needed to confirm these in vitro findings.",

The extent and clinical consequence of these effects are poorly understood in dogs. The objective was to assess the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole after single and multiple doses and the effect of multiple doses of ketoconazole on midazolam (a known CYP3A12 substrate) and the opioid fentanyl. Six greyhound dogs were studied. The study consisted of three phases. Phase 1 consisted of i.v. midazolam (0.23 mg/kg base) and fentanyl (15.71 microg/kg base). Phase 2 consisted of a single oral dose of ketoconazole (mean dose 12.34 mg/kg). Phase 3 consisted of i.v. midazolam (0.23 mg/kg) and fentanyl (10 microg/kg) after 5 days of oral ketoconazole (12.25 mg/kg/day). Ketoconazole significantly inhibited its own elimination with the mean residence time (MRT) increasing from 6.24 h in Phase 1 to 12.54 h in Phase 3. Ketoconazole significantly decreased the elimination of midazolam, as expected, with the MRT increasing from 0.81 to 1.49 h. The elimination of fentanyl was not significantly altered by co-administration of ketoconazole with the MRT being 3.90 and 6.35 h. The MRT was the most robust estimate of decreased drug elimination.", 
    "171": "A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed for midazolam in the chicken and extended to three other species. Physiological parameters included organ weights obtained from 10 birds of each species and blood flows obtained from the literature. Partition coefficients for midazolam in tissues vs. plasma were estimated from drug residue data obtained at slaughter. The avian models include separate compartments for venous plasma, liver, kidney, muscle, fat and all other tissues. An estimate of total body clearance from an earlier in vitro study was used as a starting value in the model, assuming almost complete removal of the parent compound by liver metabolism. The model was optimized for the chicken with plasma and tissue data from a pharmacokinetic study after intravenous midazolam (5 mg/kg) dose. To determine which parameters had the most influence on the goodness of fit, a sensitivity analysis was performed. The optimized chicken model was then modified for the turkey, pheasant and quail. The models were validated with midazolam plasma and tissue residue data in the turkey, pheasant and quail. The PBPK models in the turkey, pheasant and quail provided good predictions of the observed tissue residues in each species, in particular for liver and kidney.", 
    "172": "All psychotropic medications have the potential to induce numerous and diverse unwanted ocular effects. Visual adverse effects can be divided into seven major categories: eyelid and keratoconjunctival disorders; uveal tract disorders; accommodation interference; angle-closure glaucoma; cataract/pigmentary deposits in the lens and cornea; retinopathy; and other disorders. The disorders of the eyelid and of the keratoconjunctiva are mainly related to phenothiazines and lithium. Chlorpromazine, at high dosages, can commonly cause abnormal pigmentation of the eyelids, interpalpebral conjunctiva and cornea. It can also cause a more worrisome but rarer visual impairment, namely corneal oedema. Lithium can rarely lead to a bothersome eye irritation by affecting sodium transport. Uveal tract problems are mainly associated with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), typical antipsychotics, topiramate and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). TCAs, typical antipsychotics and SSRIs can all cause mydriasis that is often transient and with no major consequences, but that can promote closure of angles in susceptible patients. Topiramate has been frequently associated with a number of significant ocular symptoms including acquired myopia and angle-closure glaucoma. Problems with accommodation are related to TCAs and to low-potency antipsychotics. TCAs cause transient blurred vision in up to one-third of patients. Angle-closure glaucoma is a serious condition that has been mainly associated with TCAs, low-potency antipsychotics, topiramate and, to a lesser extent, SSRIs. When patients with narrow angles are given TCAs, they all appear to experience induction of glaucomatous attacks. Antipsychotics and SSRIs may lead to an added risk of developing angle-closure glaucoma, but only in predisposed eyes. Topiramate can lead to an allergic-type reaction whereby structures of the lens and ciliary body are displaced, which results in angle-closure glaucoma. Cataractous changes can result from antipsychotics, mainly from high dosages of chlorpromazine or thioridazine. These two drugs, when used at high dosages and for prolonged periods, frequently cause lenticular opacifications. Retinopathy has been shown to be related to high dosages of typical antipsychotics, mainly chlorpromazine and thioridazine. The frequency of occurrence of retinal effects seems to be proportional to the total amount of drug used over a long period of time. Other visual problems of special concern are the ocular dystonias, other eye movement disorders, and decreased ability to perceive colours and to discriminate contrast. Ocular dystonias can occur with antipsychotics (especially high-potency ones), carbamazepine (especially in polytherapy), topiramate and, rarely, with SSRIs. Disturbance in various eye movements is frequently seen with benzodiazepines, antiepileptic drugs and lithium. Impairment in the perception of colours and the discrimination of contrasts has been shown to occur not uncommonly with carbamazepine and lorazepam. Thus, typical antipsychotics, TCAs, lithium, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, topiramate and SSRIs appear to produce most of the currently recognized ocular problems. Psychiatrists, ophthalmologists and patients need to be aware of and prepared for any medication-induced adverse effect. Early prevention and intervention can avoid most of the serious and potentially irreversible ocular toxicities.",

Dysfunctions of several neurobiological systems, including serotoninergic, dopaminergic, and other neurotransmitter systems, have been discussed. Here we present a theory that alterations in the sensitivity of opioid receptors or the availability of endogenous opioids constitute part of the underlying pathophysiology of BPD. The alarming symptoms and self-destructive behaviors of the affected patients may be explained by uncontrollable and unconscious attempts to stimulate their endogenous opioid system (EOS) and the dopaminergic reward system, regardless of the possible harmful consequences. Neurobiological findings that support this hypothesis are reviewed: Frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, frequent and risky sexual contacts, and attention-seeking behavior may be explained by attempts to make use of the rewarding effects of human attachment mediated by the EOS. Anhedonia and feelings of emptiness may be an expression of reduced activity of the EOS. Patients with BPD tend to abuse substances that target mu-opioid receptors. Self-injury, food restriction, aggressive behavior, and sensation seeking may be interpreted as desperate attempts to artificially set the body to survival mode in order to mobilize the last reserves of the EOS. BPD-associated symptoms, such as substance abuse, anorexia, self-injury, depersonalization, and sexual overstimulation, can be treated successfully with opioid receptor antagonists. An understanding of the neurobiology of BPD may help in developing new treatments for patients with this severe disorder.",
