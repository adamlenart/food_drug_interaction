    "0": "Endogenous prostaglandins are involved in the control of gastric acid secretion and in the protection of the gastroduodenal mucosa. Although a possible deficiency of local prostanoids in peptic ulcer disease is still controversial, stimulation of prostaglandin biosynthesis by pharmacological agents can be helpful both in the prevention and in the treatment of mucosal injuries. The interference of anti-ulcer drugs with gastric prostanoids is reviewed. Drugs inhibiting gastric acid secretion seem to exert no effect on endogenous prostaglandins. In contrast, the mechanism of action of mucosal protecting agents, such as carbenoxolone and sucralfate, appears to be partially mediated by stimulation of gastric prostaglandin synthesis.", 
    "1": "The pharmacokinetics of the benzodiazepine hypnotic, loprazolam (1.0 mg orally), and the pharmacodynamic response to single oral doses (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) have been compared in young and elderly healthy volunteers. No difference between the groups in peak plasma concentration (Cmax) or in the time to peak (tmax) was found, but the elimination half-life t1/2,z and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were significantly greater in the elderly group. The immediate effects of loprazolam on all three performance tests used (postural sway, critical flicker fusion threshold (CFFT) and choice reaction time (CRT] and on subjective sedation tended to be more pronounced in the elderly subjects, though intersubject variability in response was high in both groups. The corresponding plasma concentrations did not differ significantly between the two groups. The higher (1.0 mg) dosage was associated with significant residual (11 h) impairment of standing steadiness in the elderly subjects. No other hangover effects were observed. The results are compatible with previous evidence of increased 'sensitivity' to benzodiazepines in the elderly and suggest that a lower (0.5 mg) starting dose of loprazolam would be appropriate for older recipients. Further investigation would be necessary to establish whether clinically relevant accumulation of loprazolam occurs in the elderly following repeated dosage.", 
    "2": "The regional cerebral effects of an anxiolytic (clorazepate) in 20 patients with generalized anxiety disorder were assessed using 16-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectral estimate maps of the left hemisphere. Patients were studied with double-blind random assignment to placebo or drug and were assessed at baseline, day 7, and day 14 with EEG and Hamilton Anxiety Ratings. Ten age- and sex-matched normal controls were also tested. Hamilton Anxiety Ratings were decreased significantly more in the drug group than in the placebo group. Topographic maps of EEG activity revealed decreases in occipital alpha and parietal delta, together with increases in posterior frontal (central EEG leads) and parietal beta. Decreases in delta are consistent with a lack of sedation; the reciprocal beta increases in parietal cortex are similarly consistent. This pattern of regional EEG changes in the direction of alert attentiveness, together with individual differences, observed in frontal/parietal and occipital alpha activity, suggests the importance of at least these two cortical regions for anxiolytic action. Differences between patients with generalized anxiety disorder and normals were restricted to the occipital and temporal regions. These results suggest the importance of multilead recording in assessing EEG correlates of drug action.", 
    "3": "A case is presented in which a 68-year-old man became delirious after being withdrawn from a low dosage of alprazolam. The delirium was not affected by administration of alprazolam. The authors suggest that alprazolam may have enhanced specificity for a subpopulation of benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "4": "Empirical studies suggest the following main conclusions: functional somatic symptoms are extremely common; a large proportion appear to be caused by physiologic activity and tend to be aggravated by emotion. Hypochondriacal patients misunderstand the nature and significance of these symptoms and believe that they are evidence of serious disease. Hypochondriasis can be a part of another syndrome, usually an affective one, or it can be a primary disorder. The prevalence differs between cultures and social classes. Constitutional factors, disease in the family in childhood, and previous disease predispose to hypochondriasis. Various stressors can be precipitating events. Selective perception of symptoms, motivated by fear of disease, and subsequent increase in anxiety with more somatic symptoms appear to be links in the vicious cycle of the hypochondriacal reaction. Psychotherapy as well as psychotropic drugs are effective in the treatment of functional somatic symptoms. There are no adequate controlled studies of psychotherapy in hypochondriasis, and the recommended treatments are based on studies with similar disorders. The prognosis of treated hypochondriasis is good in a substantial proportion of patients.", 
    "5": "Both alprazolam and triazolam displaced clonazepam (but not Ro 5-4864) from rat brain membranes with high affinity, showing them to act at central but not peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. At 0 degrees C, 10 microM gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) increased the ability of alprazolam, but not of triazolam, to displace ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) and Ro 15-1788 from these receptors. At 37 degrees C, GABA increased the affinity of the receptors for both drugs, with a +GABA/-GABA ratio of 1.5 for each in promoting Ro 15-1788 binding displacement. As both triazolam and alprazolam act as anxiolytics in vivo, the results at 37 degrees C would be compatible with the hypothesis that GABA causes an increase in affinity of drugs that act in this way, but the results at 0 degrees C would not be compatible. At 37 degrees C, alprazolam had a higher IC50 for the benzodiazepine receptor than at 0 degrees C, whereas triazolam showed the reverse effect. The relative IC50 values in vitro at 37 degrees C correlated better with the potency in vivo than those obtained at 0 degrees C. At 0 degrees C, both drugs showed Hill plots with slopes of 0.9-1 with beta-CCE and Ro 15-1788. At 37 degrees C, the slopes with triazolam were much reduced, indicating that the drug may have a selective action on a subclass of central benzodiazepine receptors. In the studies reported here, alprazolam behaved like other benzodiazepines, whereas triazolam showed several anomalous properties. It would be of interest if these properties could be related either to the drug's use as a hypnotic or to the side effects it sometimes induces.", 
    "6": "Clonic seizures were induced in Swiss or DBA/2 mice by methyl-6-7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), 0.048 mmol/kg i.p., or by methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM), 0.044 mmol/kg i.p. Measurement of regional brain (cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum) amino acid levels after 15 min of seizure activity showed increases in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (in all regions after beta-CCM, and in cortex and hippocampus after DMCM), and an increase in glycine in the striatum after beta-CCM. Aspartate levels fell (in cortex and hippocampus) after DMCM, but were unchanged in all regions after beta-CCM. Glutamate levels fell in cortex after beta-CCM and in striatum after DMCM. Pretreatment with the excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist, 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid, 0.5 mmol/kg i.p., 45 min prior to the beta-carboline, significantly increased the ED50 for DMCM-induced clonic seizures (4.68 mumol/kg vs. 9.39 mumol/kg). Similar pretreatment did not significantly alter the ED50 for beta-CCM (4.22 mumol/kg vs. 6.6 mumol/kg). Pretreatment with 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid, 1.0 mmol/kg, blocked the increase in GABA content produced by DMCM but not the fall in cortical aspartate content. Potassium-induced release of preloaded D-[3H]aspartate from rat cortical or hippocampal minislices was enhanced in the presence of DMCM (100 microM). In contrast, stimulated release of D-[3H]aspartate (from cortex or hippocampus) was not altered in the presence of beta-CCM (100 microM). Although DMCM and beta-CCM are both considered to induce convulsion by acting at the GABA--benzodiazepine receptor complex, the convulsions differ in several pharmacological and biochemical respects. It is suggested that enhanced release of excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters plays a more important role in seizures induced by DMCM.",

    "8": "The extent to which hydromorphone, clonidine, and oxazepam alleviate the symptoms of opioid withdrawal and the extent and pattern of self-administration of these drugs during methadone detoxification were examined within a residential laboratory in three groups of patients dependent on methadone. Six times over the course of detoxification, acute effects of orally administered placebo and a single active drug (hydromorphone HCl, 3 mg, clonidine HCl, 0.3 mg, or oxazepam, 30 mg, all given twice daily) were tested, followed by an opportunity for subjects to self-administer the drug and dose of their choice. Hydromorphone significantly decreased opioid withdrawal symptoms and was more preferred for self-administration than the placebo. Clonidine and oxazepam did not significantly decrease withdrawal symptoms, nor was either drug self-administered significantly more than placebo. Clonidine, however, did induce side effects.", 
    "9": "The effects of pirenzepine on carbamylcholine-stimulated exocrine and endocrine pancreatic functions were compared with those of atropine in both the isolated pancreatic acini and the isolated perfused pancreas of rats. In the isolated acini pirenzepine and atropine produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of amylase secretion initiated by carbamylcholine. This inhibition resulted in a rightward shift in the dose-response curve for carbamylcholine-stimulated amylase secretion without altering the maximal increase in amylase secretion. Pirenzepine was, however, approximately 300 times less potent than atropine in inhibiting the stimulated amylase release. A similar difference in potency was observed with respect to carbamylcholine stimulation of pancreatic juice, amylase, and insulin release from the isolated perfused pancreas. The maximal inhibitory concentration of pirenzepine on a maximal effective concentration of pirenzepine on a maximal effective concentration of carbamylcholine for stimulating pancreatic exocrine secretion was 10 microM, whereas that of atropine was 30 nM. The present data define the pirenzepine receptors in the exocrine and endocrine pancreas as low-affinity-type receptors.", 
    "10": "Specific [3H]l-quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to rat nasal mucosa homogenates occurs to a homogeneous class of binding sites with Kd = 60 +/- 2 10(-12) M and Bmax = 8.1 +/- 2 pmol/g tissue. Binding is stereoselectively inhibited by benzetimide enantiomers. Pirenzepine inhibits [3H]l-quinuclidinyl benzilate binding with low affinity (Ki = 5.0 10(-7) M), classifying the binding sites as muscarinic M2-receptors. Methylfurtrethonium and methacholine inhibit [3H]l-quinuclidinyl benzilate binding following an almost sigmoid curve at high concentrations pointing to the presence of mainly low affinity agonist binding sites.", 
    "11": "We measured gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and benzodiazepine binding in autopsied frontal cortex of 8 patients dying with dialysis encephalopathy (DE). No alteration in [3H] GABA binding was observed. However, a mild reduction (-23%, P less than 0.05) of [3H] flunitrazepam-binding density was found in DE cortex. The magnitude of this reduction was similar to that observed in frontal cortex of amygdala-kindled rats [10]. We suggest that a reduction in benzodiazepine receptor number, in combination with markedly reduced GABA concentration in DE cerebral cortex may contribute to some of the clinical features (especially seizures) characteristically observed in this syndrome.", 
    "12": "Rats treated with the anxiogenic beta-carboline, N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG-7142), failed to acquire an escape response 24 h after treatment. Administration of FG-7142 resulted in a behavioral effect equivalent to a session of inescapable tailshock in this paradigm of learned helplessness. Pretreatment of rats with the selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro15-1788 blocked the development of learned helplessness elicited by FG-7142. These findings suggest that 'anxiety' may be a major factor in the development of learned helplessness.", 
    "13": "In vivo benzodiazepine receptor binding has generally been studied by \"ex vivo\" techniques. In this investigation, we identify the conditions where [3H]-Ro 15-1788 labels benzodiazepine receptors by true \"in vivo\" binding, i.e. where workable specific to nonspecific ratios are obtained in intact tissues without homogenization or washing. [3H]-Flunitrazepam and [3H]-clonazepam did not exhibit useful in vivo receptor binding.", 
    "14": "When the rat cerebellar climbing fibers degenerated, as induced by lesioning the inferior olive with 3-acetylpyridine (3-AP), GABAB receptor binding determined with 3H-(+/-)baclofen was reduced in the cerebellum but not in the cerebral cortex of rats. Computer analysis of saturation data revealed two components of the binding sites, and indicated that decrease of the binding in the cerebellum was due to reduction in receptor density, mainly of the high-affinity sites, the Bmax of which was reduced to one-third that in the control animals. In vitro treatment with 3-AP, of the membranes prepared from either the cerebellum or the cerebral cortex, induced no alteration in the binding sites, thereby indicating that the alteration of GABAB sites induced by in vivo treatment with 3-AP is not due to a direct action of 3-AP on the receptor. GABAA and benzodiazepine receptor binding labelled with 3H-muscimol and 3H-diazepam, respectively, in both of brain regions was not affected by destruction of the inferior olive. These results provide evidence that some of the GABAB sites but neither GABAA nor benzodiazepine receptors in the cerebellum are located at the climbing fiber terminals.", 
    "15": "Drugs affecting various steps of GABA transmission exhibit analgesia in a variety of experimental models in animals; this analgesic response generally requires high doses of the drugs and does not appear to be opiate-like since the GABAergic analgesia is naloxone-insensitive and lacks dependence liability. The outcome of the analgesia response is variable when opiate and GABAergic drugs are administered together; however, directly acting GABA receptor stimulants and GABA-transaminase inhibitors generally enhance the analgesic effect of opiates. The development of newer GABAergic drugs with greater potency and specificity may offer an alternative to opiate analgesics. The results obtained over the years, on the possible involvement of the GABA system in morphine tolerance and dependence are equivocal. Studies on region-specific changes in opiate-GABA interaction as well as opiate-GABA-benzodiazepine interaction are needed to further elucidate the role of GABA on opiate system.", 
    "16": "Six circus lions (Panthera leo) showed neurological and gastrointestinal signs after consuming casualty broiler chickens. Signs included ataxia, hindlimb paralysis and recumbency. Neurological examination of two affected males showed paralysis of extraocular muscles, fixed dilated pupils and inability to swallow. Replacement fluids and antibiotics were given and Clostridium botulinum type C antitoxin was found in serum samples. Type C antitoxin was not then available and therapy was started in one lioness with guanidine hydrochloride. Convulsions were controlled by diazepam but this animal died. One of the two males was given type C antitoxin; both were given anabolic steroids. All the remaining animals made slow recoveries over varying periods; one lion was recumbent for 41 days. No lion developed respiratory paralysis; other animals which had consumed the chickens remained healthy. Aspects of the treatment of botulism in animals are discussed.", 
    "17": "Prevention of gastrointestinal stress lesions by cimetidine or pirenzepine was investigated in a double blind study of trauma patients in an intensive care unit. Cimetidine or pirenzepine were administered intravenously to 55 consecutive randomized patients. All were checked by endoscopy on admission and 8 days later. 5 therapy failures were found in each group. Patients with more than 5 erosions and/or ulcerations were classified as failures. A side effect encountered was sinus tachycardia in 4 of 27 patients treated with pirenzepine. Overall, a trend towards fewer stress lesions was found in the pirenzepine protected group.", 
    "18": "We have tested several compounds interfering with the brain monoamine (noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin) and acetylcholine systems for their effects on limbic seizures produced by systemically (s.c.) injected kainic acid as well as on neurochemical changes in amygdala/pyriform cortex resulting from the kainic acid treatment. The characteristic neurochemical changes induced by s.c. kainic acid were a decrease in noradrenaline and an increase in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the acute (3 h after kainic acid injection) suggesting strongly increased neurotransmitter turnover in noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons. This was followed by a reduction of glutamic acid decarboxylase and choline acetyltransferase activities during the chronic phase (3 days) of the kainic acid action, indicating destruction of GABAergic and cholinergic neurons. The compounds tested in this model of limbic epilepsy included 1-propranolol, prazosin, clonidine, yohimbine, metergoline, atropine and haloperidol. Among these compounds the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist clonidine (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) exhibited a powerful protective action on kainic acid-induced limbic seizures as well as on the neurochemical changes in the amygdala and pyriform cortex. In addition, the adrenoceptor antagonists prazosin (alpha 1) and propranolol (beta) as well as the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol had significant but less potent - protective actions upon kainic acid-induced seizures and subsequent neurochemical changes. On the other hand, yohimbine (alpha 2-antagonist) and metergoline (serotonin-antagonist) potentiated the limbic seizure syndrome and no effect was found with atropine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "Amphetamine-induced twitching of the suprahyoid muscle in nialamide-pretreated, urethane-anaesthetised rats was inhibited by the benzodiazepine agonists RU 32007, diazepam and chlordiazepoxide and the GABAA agonist muscimol. Ro15-1788 and CGS 8216 induced slight, or no reduction in twitching, respectively, but reversed the effect of RU 32007 and diazepam. Ro15-1788 did not reverse the effect of muscimol. Picrotoxin reversed both muscimol and RU 32007 effects at a dose which induced only a small increase in twitching alone. Higher doses of picrotoxin markedly increased amphetamine twitching and induced twitching in the absence of amphetamine. Ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (BCE) weakly increased twitching and reversed the effect of RU 32007. CL 218872 weakly reduced twitching but also weakly antagonised RU 32007. In rats pretreated with a higher dose of nialamide methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (BCM) and BCE induced twitching. BCE-induced twitching was antagonised by RU 32007, Ro15-1788, CGS 8216, muscimol and weakly by CL 218872. Thus, benzodiazepine agonists inhibit twitching and inverse agonists induce twitching, both being blocked by antagonists. Partial agonism (CL 218872) or partial inverse agonism (CGS 8216) may be detected by differential effects against different inducers of twitching.", 
    "20": "Genetically spastic rats were used for studying the effect on muscle tone of beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid methylester (beta-CCM), an inverse benzodiazepine (BDZ) agonist, and that of Ro 15-1788 and CGS 8216, both putative antagonists of pharmacological actions of BDZs. These animals exhibit pathologically increased muscle tone, which can be recorded and quantified in the electromyogram (EMG) of the gastrocnemius (GS) muscle. beta-CCM, 2.5 and 3.0 mg/kg i.p., augmented the tonic activity in the EMG of GS muscle in spastic rats while it did not modify muscle tone at doses of 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg. Diazepam, 0.4 mg/kg i.p., and Ro 15-1788, 5 mg/kg i.p., but not CGS 8216, 5 mg/kg i.p., antagonised the effect of the beta-carboline on muscle tone. Ro 15-1788, at doses of 0.1-5 mg/kg i.p., did not affect muscle tone in the genetically spastic rats, whilst at doses of 25-200 mg/kg the imidazodiazepine dose dependently increased the tonic activity in the EMG. The action of Ro 15-1788, 50 mg/kg i.p., was reversed by diazepam, 0.4 mg/kg i.p., and beta-CCM, 2 mg/kg i.p., while CGS 8216, 5 mg/kg i.p., facilitated the effect of Ro 15-1788 on muscle tone. CGS 8216 at doses of 5 and 25 mg/kg i.p. was devoid of any effect on muscle tone, whilst at doses of 50 and 200 mg/kg the pyrazoloquinoline increased the tonic activity recorded in the EMG from the GS muscle of the spastic rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "Carbachol stimulated phosphatidic acid synthesis in cholinergically enriched synaptosomes from rat cerebral cortex. Increasing concentrations of pirenzepine (10-1000 nM) produced parallel concentration-response curves to carbachol which were shifted to the right. A pA2 value for pirenzepine of 8.4 +/- 0.3 was obtained from Schild analysis. We hypothesize that high affinity pirenzepine binding to M1 receptors is coupled to phosphatidic acid synthesis in the rat cerebral cortex.", 
    "22": "Four classes of non-mammalian vertebrates were examined for the presence of both 'brain-specific' and 'peripheral-type' binding sites for benzodiazepines in the central nervous system. 'Brain-specific' binding sites for benzodiazepines were found in the central nervous systems of all non-mammalian vertebrates studied. However, in contrast to mammals, either very low or undetectable levels of 'peripheral-type' binding sites for benzodiazepines were observed in the central nervous systems of these non-mammalian vertebrates. Furthermore, the density of 'peripheral-type' binding sites for benzodiazepines in non-mammalian vertebrate heart was less than or equal to 2% of that found in mammalian cardiac tissue. These findings suggest a very late evolutionary appearance of 'peripheral-type' binding sites for benzodiazepines, implying that these sites may have (a) highly specialized function(s) in both peripheral tissues and the central nervous system.", 
    "23": "An endogenous polypeptide of rat brain has been identified that is capable of displacing 1,4-benzodiazepines and the esters of the 3-carboxylic acid derivatives of beta-carbolines from their specific synaptic binding sites. This polypeptide was termed diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI). Previous studies have shown that DBI injected intraventricularly in rodents elicits \"proconflict\" responses and antagonizes the \"anticonflict\" action of benzodiazepines. An antiserum to this peptide, directed toward an immunodeterminant near its amino terminus, makes it possible to detect, measure, and study the neuronal location of this peptide in rat brain. In the rat cerebral cortex, DBI immunoreactivity is located in neurons that are not GABAergic (GABA, gamma-aminobutyric acid); in the cerebellum and hippocampus, however, it might be present also in GABAergic neurons.", 
    "24": "Circulating ethyl loflazepate metabolites in the baboon were determined, following a single oral administration of the 14C-labelled drug, by radio-high-performance liquid chromatography with injection of crude plasma samples and by selective extraction with thin-layer chromatographic analysis of the radioactive components. Metabolites identified by comparing their chromatographic behaviour with synthetic standards were loflazepate, descarboxyloflazepate and 3-hydroxydescarboxyloflazepate. Loflazepate represented about 70% of the circulating radioactivity; the two other metabolites were present in amounts too small to allow accurate quantification. The parent drug was not present in the blood. Comparison of high-performance liquid chromatography with solvent extraction demonstrated the inaccuracy of the latter to be caused by the conversion of loflazepate to descarboxyloflazepate.", 
    "25": "Diazepam (10(-5)-3 X 10(-4) M) selectively enhanced the negative inotropic responses of guinea-pig atria and the relaxation of guinea-pig taenia coli caused by adenosine and ATP. In the atria, the effect of 2-chloroadenosine, a stable analog of adenosine, was not affected by diazepam. Segments of guinea-pig atria or taenia coli took up 3H-activity during incubation with [3H]adenosine but did not take up 32P-activity from [32P]ATP. Diazepam at concentrations sufficient to enhance the in vitro responses reduced by half the uptake of 3H-activity into the preparations. Adenosine (10(-6) M) and ATP (10(-6) M) were degraded to inactive inosine during incubation with atrial segments and their degradation was inhibited by diazepam. In contrast, in rat atria, diazepam did not enhance the negative inotropic effects of adenosine and ATP, and did not prevent the uptake of adenosine. These results suggest that in guinea-pig atria and taenia coli, diazepam like dipyridamole, acts as an adenosine potentiator by preventing the uptake and degradation of adenosine.", 
    "26": "Wistar rats in our laboratory breeding colony spontaneously present petit mal-like, non-convulsive, epileptic seizures. In these rats, as in other animal petit mal models, GABAmimetics, agonists of GABA-A receptors such as 4, 5, 6, 7 tetrahydroisooxazolo (5,4-c) pyridin-3-ol (THIP), or inhibitors of GABA catabolism such as gamma-vinyl GABA (GVG) or L-cycloserine (CYC), aggravated the seizures. Diazepam not only abolished the spontaneous seizures but also completely blocked the effects of the GABAmimetics, totally suppressing seizures in rats given THIP, GVG or CYC. These findings show that the mode of action of benzodiazepines is not comparable to a non-specific potentiation of GABA transmission, and suggest that the anti-absence effects of the benzodiazepines could depend on interactions with neurotransmitter systems other than GABA.", 
    "27": "[3H]-diazepam binds to sites on human granulocyte membranes, with little or no binding to platelets or lymphocytes. These [3H]-diazepam binding sites are of the peripheral type, being strongly inhibited by R05-4864 (Ki = 6.23nM) but only weakly by clonazepam (Ki = 14 microM). Binding of [3H] diazepam at 0 degree is saturable, specific and stereoselective. Scatchard analysis indicates a single class of sites with Bmax of 109 +/- 17f moles per mg of protein and KD of 3.07 +/- 0.53nM. Hill plots of saturation experiments gave straight lines with a mean Hill coefficient of 1.03 +/- 0.014. Binding is time dependent and reversible and it varies linearly with granulocyte protein concentration over the range 0.025-0.300 mg of protein.", 
    "28": "Recent reports suggest that at least some of the behavioural effects of benzodiazepines may involve interaction with endogenous opioid mechanisms. In the present study, chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 10-20 mg/kg, i.p.) induced dose-dependent reductions in spontaneous locomotor activity and rearing in mice. Although naloxone (1 mg/kg) was itself without effect, and did not alter behavioural changes induced by the lower dose of CDP, it enhanced the depressant effects of 20 mg/kg CDP on locomotor activity. Results are discussed in relation to previous studies in which opiate antagonists have been found to block or to have no effect upon behavioural actions of benzodiazepines.", 
    "29": "The effects of methamphetamine (MAT) and apomorphine (APO), dopamine agonists, were studied in 16 cats to evaluate their effects on threshold for defensive attack behavior elicited by electrical stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH). Directed attack and hissing were selected from elementary responses as constituting a defensive attack. Hissing threshold was measured in two situations, one with human provocation and the other without provocation. MAT administered systemically lowered the thresholds for all three types of responses in a dose-related manner (0.5, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg). The effects of 1.0 mg/kg of APO were almost identical to those observed with 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg of MAT. These results suggest that MAT-induced aggressive behavior may be mediated by a dopamine-induced increase in the excitability of the VMH.", 
    "30": "Six healthy fasted volunteers each received oral doses of a placebo, 1 mg and 2 mg loprazolam with one week between treatments using a double-blind balanced crossover design. Serum samples were obtained at selected times after dosing for measurement of loprazolam using a combined high-performance liquid and gas chromatographic assay. Drug effect was also measured at the corresponding times using self-assessment scales and psychomotor tests. The serum levels of loprazolam followed a somewhat irregular shape with secondary and tertiary peaks possibly associated with food intake. The maximum serum levels of loprazolam following 1 mg and 2 mg doses of the drug (6.0 +/- 2.6 and 11.3 +/- 2.9 ng/ml, respectively) occurred at approximately one hour after dosing. Both the maximum serum levels and the area under the curve of loprazolam measured to six hours increased in direct proportion to dose. Statistically significant drug effects were seen after 2 mg loprazolam, although the subjects also appeared sedated after 1 mg doses. There appeared to be a good correlation between the logarithm of the serum concentration of loprazolam and effect which suggested that the hypnotic activity of the drug was not mediated via a long-lived metabolite. A threshold serum concentration associated with evident sedation was observed at approximately 3 ng/ml.", 
    "31": "Pharmacodynamic effects of ethyl 7-chloro-2,3-dihydro-5-(2-fluorophenyl)-2-oxo-1H-1,4- benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (CM6912), a new benzodiazepine derivative, and its main metabolites (CM6913 = M1, CM7116 = M2) on the peripheral systems were investigated in several species of animals. In pentobarbital-anesthetized rabbits, CM6912 and M2 (1 or 5 mg/kg, i.v.) had little effect on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG, but it slightly reduced the respiration rate. M1 decreased the heart rate without affecting respiration, blood pressure and ECG. In conscious rabbits, CM6912 and M2 (1 mg/kg, i.v.) did not affect respiration, blood pressure, heart rate and ECG, but M1 (1 mg/kg, i.v.) increased the heart rate. CM6912 (5 or 30 mg/kg), when administered orally, also increased heart rate. In pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs, CM6912 and its metabolites (5 mg/kg, i.v.) decreased respiration and heart rate without affecting blood pressure and ECG. CM 6912 (5 mg/kg, i.v.) did not affect cardiovascular responses to the carotid occlusion, vagus stimulation, and pre- and post-ganglionic stimulation of cardiac ganglion in anesthetized dogs. CM6912 and its metabolites affected neither the spontaneous contraction nor the heart rate of isolated rabbit atria. These compounds also had no action on isolated aortic strips from rabbits. CM6912 and its metabolites did not affect the muscle tone of isolated guinea pig intestine, and it had no effects on the contractile responses to acetylcholine, histamine, serotonin and barium chloride. In isolated rabbit intestine, CM6912 and M2 slightly reduced the amplitude of contraction, while M1 had no effect. CM6912 and its metabolites did not affect the spontaneous motility of isolated non-pregnant and pregnant rat uteri as well as in situ non-pregnant rat uterus and isolated guinea pig vas deferens, including the contractile response to adrenaline. CM6912 and M2 relaxed isolated guinea pig trachea strips only at high concentrations. CM6912 and its metabolites did not affect the contractile responses of isolated rat diaphragm to electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve. CM6912 (2 or 10 mg/kg, p.o.) did not affect the rat renal and hepatic functions. CM6912 influenced neither blood coagulation in rabbits nor blood hemolysis in rats. CM6912 and its metabolites did not affect the pupil size and its light reflex, and they did not produce a local anesthesia and edema. The present results suggest that CM6912 and its main metabolites exert only slight effects on the peripheral systems in animals.", 
    "32": "The derivatives of GABA and beta-phenylethylamine (PEA) the tranquilizer phenibut and muscle relaxant baclofen (p-chloro-beta-phenyl-GABA, lioresal) diminished all studied effect of PEA in mice, namely seizures, sedation, excitation, hyperthermia. Diazepam diminished only seizures whereas haloperidol excitation and hyperthermia. PEA injections anatogonized (the sedative and hypothermic effects of phenibut and diazepam and the anticonvulsant (against l-kynurenine) effect of phenibut and baclofen. The role of antagonism to PEA in the mechanism of the antianxiety effect of tranquilizers is discussed.", 
    "33": "It has been found in experimental behavioral interference during training in two conditioned reflexes, rapidly following each other, that intraperitoneal injection of diazepam (2 mg/kg) 30 min before training potentiates the inhibitory effect of the defensive reaction to the drinking one. Electrophysiological analysis of the modulating effect of amygdaloid stimulation on the peripheral signal transmission via the central gray matter has demonstrated that in the majority of the neurons, diazepam produced a longer and pronounced inhibition of the excitatory reactions in response to electrocutaneous stimulation after conditioning stimulation of the amygdaloid. The data obtained allow an assumption that inhibitory processes determined by the activity of the GABAergic amygdalofugal system underlie the interference interrelations.", 
    "34": "A patient was studied who every night experienced several attacks characterized by loud screaming, violent movements of limbs and trunk, and a tonic phase. No epileptiform activity was noted preceding or following these attacks. Prolonged EEG and videotape recordings before and after sleep deprivation, along with neuropsychological and pharmacological data, support the hypothesis of a seizure disorder involving the left temporal region. Nocturnal attacks completely disappeared with carbamazepine. This therapeutic effect was still present after six months of treatment. Sleep organization was also greatly influenced by this medication. The most striking change was the marked and sustained increase of stages 3 and 4 NREM sleep after treatment.", 
    "35": "Forced immobilization of rats produced changes in the multiple-unit activity in the medial, central and lateral nuclei of the amygdala. Chlordiazepoxide suppressed the activity of these units. Low-level electrical stimulation of the area of these units produced gastric erosions only when the stimulation was applied to the central amygdalar nucleus. It was concluded that these areas of the amygdala respond to the emotional component of immobilization stress.", 
    "36": "Lorazepam pharmacokinetics were evaluated in eight healthy male and eight healthy female subjects after a single 3.5 mg oral dose. This randomized crossover study consisted of a morning dose (7:00 a.m.) or an evening dose (7:00 p.m.) separated by one week. While no consistent temporal changes in any parameter characterizing elimination of lorazepam were observed, absorption constant rate (Ka) and absorption half-life (t1/2a) were significantly modified by the hour of administration, the drug being more rapidly absorbed after the morning (t1/2a = 0.52 +/- 0.11) than after the morning trial (t1/2a = 1.18 +/- 0.26, p less than 0.05). Daily differences in pharmacokinetic parameters observed in this work suggest the need for taking in account the hour of administration during its pharmacokinetics determination.", 
    "37": "Serum creatine kinase (CK) activity was measured after intramuscular injections in 44 patients hospitalized for non-cardiac reasons. The drugs injected were: diazepam, dipyrone, metoclopramide, meperidine, pentazocine and procaine penicillin. Only 3 out of 44 patients (7%) demonstrated significant elevation of CK levels following the intramuscular injections. In these 3 patients the elevation was mainly due to a rise of the MM-isoenzyme fraction with MB levels increased in one patient. These findings do not justify the common clinical notion of regarding intramuscular injections as a frequent cause of serum CK elevation. It is concluded that high CK serum values in a patient with chest pain should always be considered with utmost suspicion, disregarding the possible effects of a previous intramuscular injection.", 
    "38": "There is a group of patients who presents with intense anxiety and physical complaints suggestive of cardiac or gastrointestinal disease. These patients are more commonly women and complain of palpitations, lightheadedness, chest pains, and dyspnea. A work-up may reveal positive findings such as extrasystoles and mitral valve prolapse that appear to confirm the organic etiology of the symptoms. Evidence is presented that the positive findings serve to confuse the picture and are an impediment, rather than an aid, to the physician in making the correct diagnosis. Effective treatment using tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors is suggested.", 
    "39": "The influence of dibunol, phenazepam used alone and combined on rat conflict behavior and rat blood and brain malonic dialdehyde content was studied. It was shown that dibunol exerts an unmarked anticonflict action that can be removed by bicuculline. Combined administration of dibunol and phenazepam potentiates appreciably the anticonflict effect. This permits reducing the doses of the drugs. The anxiolytic effect of dibunol alone and combined with phenazepam is attended by a decrease in the content of malonic dialdehyde in rat blood and brain, evidence of the reduction of the lipid peroxidation intensity.", 
    "40": "To determine whether a benzodiazepine central nervous system depressant, alprazolam, inhibits sympathetic discharge during exercise stress, 11 healthy men, aged 21 to 35 years, performed symptom-limited treadmill tests before and on the third day of drug therapy (0.5 mg 3 times daily). Plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels were measured at rest and at 8 minutes, 11 minutes and maximal exercise. Owing to catheter malfunction during vigorous exercise, paired samples could be obtained from only 8 subjects at 8 minutes and from only 4 subjects at 11 minutes of exercise. During drug treatment, the plasma epinephrine level was lower at rest (30 +/- 4 vs 53 +/- 7 pg/ml, p less than 0.01), and at 8 minutes (60 +/- 13 vs 117 +/- 19 pg/ml, p less than 0.01), 11 minutes (120 +/- 39 vs 193 +/- 52 pg/ml, p less than 0.05), and maximal exercise (520 +/- 125 vs 970 +/- 324 pg/ml, p = 0.13). Plasma norepinephrine was unchanged at rest (452 +/- 57 vs 413 +/- 45 pg/ml) but lower at 8 minutes (730 +/- 75 vs 886 +/- 82 pg/ml, p less than 0.01), 11 minutes (1,077 +/- 197 vs 1,447 +/- 301 pg/ml, p less than 0.05) and at maximal exercise (3,453 +/- 487 vs 5,590 +/- 1,100 pg/ml, p = 0.09). Exercise duration (17 +/- 1 and 17 +/- 1 minutes) was unchanged on drug. Thus, alprazolam reduces the plasma catecholamine response to exercise stress, possibly by inhibiting centrally mediated sympathetic discharge. Blunting of sympathetic activation may be beneficial in cardiac disorders in which increased sympathetic tone is potentially deleterious.", 
    "41": "The influence of certain psychotropic drugs on the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to sheep red blood cells in BALB/c mice was studied. The effects on the overall response and the induction and elicitation phases were evaluated, using two alternative dosage schedules for each agent. It was found that diazepam had no effect on the DTH reaction but the administration of imipramine, haloperidol, chlorpromazine or meprobramate all resulted in depression of the response, impairing both the induction or elicitation phases. The results indicate that psychotropic drugs may produce in vivo depression of cell-mediated immunity by different mechanisms.", 
    "42": "d-Tubocurarine (d-TC) is a drug commonly used to produce muscle paralysis. Although it has been demonstrated to produce seizures when injected directly into the cerebral ventricles, no lasting neurotoxic effects have been reported. Data presented here suggest that amounts of d-TC as small as 1 microgram injected directly into rat hippocampus resulted in selective damage to dentate granule cells. Larger doses (5 to 10 micrograms) induced limbic and motor seizures with damage to hippocampal pyramidal cells. Other brain regions showed a differential sensitivity to direct injections. Pharmacologic studies suggest a nicotinic mechanism for both actions. The neurotoxic effects could not be elicited if d-TC was administered systemically, even when the blood-brain barrier was disrupted.", 
    "43": "We have assessed the relative neurochemical effects of valproic acid, ethosuximide, and diazepam on dissociated cultures of mouse cerebral cortex. Cultures were exposed chronically (11 days) to each antiepileptic drug and assayed for number of neurons, total protein, tetanus toxin fixation, high-affinity uptake of gamma-aminobutyric acid and beta-alanine, choline acetyltransferase activity, and specific and clonazepam-displaceable benzodiazepine binding. Ethosuximide-exposed cultures did not evidence neuronal toxicity; exposure to valproic acid and diazepam resulted in modest neuronal toxicity. However, exposure to each of these drugs resulted in a marked reduction in benzodiazepine binding. This effect may relate to a common mechanism of action of drugs used to treat absence seizures.", 
    "44": "The authors studied the somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in 16 cases of myoclonic encephalopathies: 8 cases of dyssynergia cerebellaris myoclonica (DCM); 2 cases of dyssynergia cerebellaris progressiva (DCP); 2 cases of Lafora's disease; 1 case of ceroid lipofuscinosis; 3 unclassifiable myoclonic syndromes. The mean age of the patients was 18 years and the mean duration of pre-study evolution was 10 years. All the patients had been treated by anticonvulsant drugs (phenobarbital, valproic acid, benzodiazepines). The amplitude of the complex P1N2 at the level of the contralateral parietal cortex, with stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist, was found to be enlarged in only 6 cases and giant responses (over 40 microV) were obtained in 2 cases. Only half of the patients with DCM presented a high amplitude response. There was no correlation either with clinical parameters (and in particular, certain patients with marked action myoclonic jerks have a normal SEP), or with the EEG data: on the contrary, the amplitude variations of the SEPs are most often similar to variations of the visual evoked potentials.", 
    "45": "The benzodiazepine receptor 'inverse agonist' CGS 8216 has a specific anxiogenic action in the social interaction test that cannot be reversed by other compounds acting at the benzodiazepine site: Ro 15-1788, FG 7142 or beta-CCE. We tried to reverse the anxiogenic effect with chlordiazepoxide, which is able to antagonise the anxiogenic effects of several other compounds acting at benzodiazepine or related sites. Chlordiazepoxide given acutely (10-20 mg/kg) was unable to antagonise the anxiogenic action of CGS 8216 (5-10 mg/kg); instead there was a tendency to enhance its effects. The effects of chlordiazepoxide after 5 days pretreatment were then assessed, since chronic treatment is necessary to reverse the anxiogenic actions of Ro 15-1788 and Ro 5-4864. At 5 mg/kg chronically, chlordiazepoxide was unable to antagonise the anxiogenic effect of CGS 8216, and at 20 mg/kg there was a significant enhancement of the effects of CGS 8216 on social interaction without an effect on locomotor activity. These results are discussed in terms of withdrawal from benzodiazepine treatment.", 
    "46": "Continuous transcutaneous oxygen and carbon dioxide monitoring during conscious sedation using diazepam, fentanyl, and methohexital indicates that hypoxia occurs in all patients maintained on room air; 36% of the patients maintained on room air showed a decrease in transcutaneous oxygen of greater than 20 mg Hg. Although the use of supplemental O2 prevented hypoxia, the combination of diazepam, fentanyl, and methohexital depressed all of the patient's carbon dioxide chemoreceptors, resulting in a rise in carbon dioxide in the oxygen-supplemented patients as well as in the patients who were maintained on room air. The need for supplemental oxygen in patients sedated with diazepam, fentanyl, and methohexital is clearly established.", 
    "47": "The effects on sleep of N6-L-(phenylisopropyl) adenosine, cyclohexyladenosine and adenosine-5'-ethylcarboxamide were studied in rats. Also, the effects on sleep of deoxycoformycin, a potent inhibitor of adenosine deaminase, and adenosine were examined. In addition, we determined the effects of 48 h of REM sleep deprivation on adenosine (A1) receptors in specific brain structures. N6-L-(phenylisopropyl) adenosine and cyclohexyl-adenosine increased deep slow wave sleep and REM sleep whereas adenosine-5'-ethylcarboxamide increased only deep slow-wave sleep. At the dose of 0.9 mumol/kg all three adenosine analogs suppressed REM sleep and except for adenosine-5-ethylcarboxamide, were without an effect on deep slow-wave sleep. In accordance, administration of deoxycoformycin increased REM and deep slow-wave sleep. Intracerebroventricular administration of 1, 10 and 100 nmoles of adenosine to rats decreased waking, increased deep slow-wave sleep and increased total sleep. In addition, REM sleep deprivation significantly increased the number of A1 receptors (Bmax) in cerebral cortex and corpus striatum which correlates with the increased pressure for REM sleep and the onset of REM sleep rebound. When these data are taken together, they indicate a role for adenosine in the regulation of sleep and, in contrast to barbiturate and benzodiazepine hypnotics, increase in behaviorally deep and REM sleep.", 
    "48": "Muscarinic receptors are involved in the control of gastric acid secretion. The characteristics of (3H)-N-methyl-scopolamine [(3H)-NMS] binding to isolated cells from rabbit fundic gastric mucosa and inhibition of this binding by muscarinic agonists, antagonists and other pharmacological agents known to regulate acid secretion are reported. Specific binding for (3H)-NMS was described: antagonists interact with high affinity sites (KD = 0.5 nM) whereas binding curves for agonists clearly deviated from the simple mass action isotherm with a flattening of the curve suggesting the presence of more than one class of sites. The low affinity sites for agonists are in the micromolar range. Pirenzine, a gastroselective antimuscarinic compound, known to differentiate between M1 and M2 sites, inhibited (3H)-NMS binding with an IC50 of 0.05 microM. On the same gastric cell population, muscarinic agonist carbachol stimulated (14C)-aminopyrine accumulation in a dose-dependent manner with an ED-50 of 10 microM, value close to that needed to 50% inhibit (3H)-NMS binding. This stimulation was competitively inhibited by muscarinic antagonists and pA2-values for atropine, QNB and pirenzepine, calculated from linear Schild plots, were in the following order: 9.2 for atropine, 8.6 for QNB and 7.0 for pirenzepine. In conclusion, fundic gastric mucosal cells from rabbit, isolated with collagenase and EDTA, contained specific muscarinic receptors coupled to the acid secretory mechanism and pirenzepine interact with these receptors with an intermediate affinity suggesting the presence of functional M2-sites.", 
    "49": "Membranes prepared from rat cerebral cortex were solubilized in buffer containing 1% digitonin. Material present in the supernatant after centrifugation at 147,000 X g was shown to contain binding sites for both [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate [( 3H]QNB) and [3H]pirenzepine [( 3H]PZ). Recovery of binding sites was approximately 25% of the initial membrane-bound [3H]QNB binding sites. The Kd values for [3H]QNB and [3H]PZ binding to solubilized receptors were 0.3 nM and 0.1 microM, respectively. As has been observed previously in membrane preparations, [3H]PZ appeared to label fewer solubilized binding sites than did [3H]QNB. Maximum binding values for [3H]PZ and [3H]QNB binding to solubilized receptors were approximately 400 and 950 fmol/mg of protein, respectively. Competition curves for PZ inhibiting the binding of [3H]QNB, however, had Hill slopes of 1, with a Ki value of 0.24 microM. The k1 and k-1 for [3H]PZ binding were 3.5 X 10(6) M-1 min-1 and 0.13 min-1, respectively. The muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine, scopolamine and PZ inhibited the binding of [3H]QNB and [3H]PZ to solubilized receptors with Hill slopes of 1, as did the muscarinic receptor agonist oxotremorine. The muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol competed for [3H]QNB and [3H]PZ binding with a Hill slope of less than 1 in cerebral cortex, but not in cerebellum. GTP did not alter the interactions of carbachol or oxotremorine with the solubilized receptor. Together, these data suggest that muscarinic receptor sites solubilized from rat brain retain their abilities to interact selectively with muscarinic receptor agonists and antagonists.", 
    "50": "A simple, reliable and reproducible method for the estimation of midazolam in plasma samples is described. This involves extraction with benzene and estimation by gas-liquid chromatography using diazepam as the internal standard. Reproducibility was good and the extraction from plasma was 94% efficient.", 
    "51": "The technique of in vitro autoradiography which was developed by Kuhar and others was applied to the rat brain with use of 3H-flunitrazepam (flu) as a radioactive ligand. The cerebral cortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra and cerebellar cortex were rich in 3H-flu binding sites. To differentiate the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) subtype, the authors used a type 1 specific ligand, either triazolopiridazine (CI 218872) or methyl-beta-carboline-carboxylate (beta-CCM), as an unlabeled displacer. The preparations were exposed on a 3H-sensitive film and then the film was developed. Computer-analysis of thus obtained autoradiographic pictures revealed that type 2 binding sites were distributed evenly within the rat brain, but with slight predominance in the hippocampus. After adding beta-CCM, no silver grains were noticed in the cerebellum and substantia nigra. These data meant that these two structures contained essentially type 1 BZR, while the hippocampus contained both type 1 and type 2 receptors. Autoradiographically, characteristic distribution of BZR represented by 3H-flu binding was considerably lost by adding a type 1 specific ligand, and this treatment caused the silver grains to be evenly distributed. These data suggest that the BZR which is directly associated with characteristic pharmacological actions such as anxiolytic and hypnotic effects is type 1, and type 2 binding sites have a less characteristic distribution pattern and might be pharmacologically less specific.", 
    "52": "The effect of picrotoxinin on [3H]flunitrazepam binding to benzodiazepine receptors was investigated. In mouse forebrain membranes, picrotoxinin inhibited basal, GABA- and pentobarbital-stimulated [3H]flunitrazepam binding; this inhibitory activity was temperature- and chloride ion-dependent. Scatchard analysis of the data indicates that picrotoxinin decreases the number of binding sites without altering binding affinity. In cerebellar membranes, picrotoxinin did not alter [3H]flunitrazepam receptor binding.", 
    "53": "The syntheses of some 2-aryl-3-methyl-4,5-dihydro-2H-pyrazolo [4,3-c] quinolin-4-ones and 1-aryl-3-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo-[4,5-c] quinolin-4-ones are reported. Some of the latter have shown a high activity in displacing specific [3H]-flunitrazepam binding from bovine brain membranes.", 
    "54": "Intracellular recordings have been made from CA1, CA3 and dentate cells of the mouse hippocampal slice. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the water-soluble benzodiazepines, midazolam and flurazepam were applied close to the impaled cell somata by microelectrophoresis. GABA always caused a fall in input resistance, although the associated changes in membrane potential were variable. These were consistent with reports which have defined a hyperpolarizing response to somatic and a depolarizing response to dendritic application of GABA to CA1 and CA3 cells in the rat and guinea-pig. In this study, the phenomenon was seen in CA1, CA3 and dentate cells. The reversal potential for the hyperpolarizing, somatic response to GABA lay between -70 and -75 mV, similar to the reversal potential of the evoked recurrent inhibitory post-synaptic potential (i.p.s.p.). The change in cell input conductance caused by GABA was larger at membrane potentials positive to the resting potential and smaller at hyperpolarized membrane potentials. Extracellular recordings of action potential frequency were made from ten cells in which the application of either midazolam or flurazepam increased the inhibitory potency of GABA. In three of these cells, the benzodiazepine reduced action potential frequency slightly when applied alone. Neither midazolam nor flurazepam had a consistent effect on membrane potential, resting input resistance or the current-voltage (I-V) relations of the cells when ejected alone. In twenty-eight of forty-one cells examined in detail, ejection of either midazolam or flurazepam was found to increase the response to GABA. In six cells, the response to GABA was significantly reduced by the benzodiazepine tested whilst in the remainder, no interaction of the drugs could be demonstrated. Examination of the dose-response relation for GABA alone and in the presence of midazolam or flurazepam showed that the maximal response to GABA was increased by the benzodiazepine in some cells while it was unchanged in others. When intracellular electrodes were filled with potassium chloride, spontaneous depolarizing GABA-mediated post-synaptic potentials (p.s.p.s) were seen. Measurement of the interval and amplitude distributions of these events showed that flurazepam increased their amplitude but not their frequency.", 
    "55": "The effects of a benzodiazepine receptor agonist (diazepam), antagonist (Ro 15-1788), and an \"active\" antagonist [inverse agonist] (3-carboethoxy-beta-carboline) were examined in an isolation-induced model of aggression. Diazepam (4 mg/kg) and 3-carboethoxy-beta-carboline (10 mg/kg), but not Ro 15-1788, significantly inhibited aggressive behavior in this model. Ro 15-1788 (10 mg/kg) reduced the anti-aggressive actions of both diazepam and 3-carboethoxy-beta-carboline, while mice treated with a combination of diazepam and 3-carboethoxy-beta-carboline had aggression scores increased to values not significantly different from vehicle treated mice. These findings suggest that both diazepam and 3-carboethoxy-beta-carboline have anti-aggressive properties in the isolation-induced model of aggression which are mediated through CNS benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "56": "Benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor binding was assayed in situ in dispersed cultures of fetal mouse cerebral cortex at 37 degrees C and at 0 degrees C and compared. Contrary to data obtained from disrupted tissues, receptor binding at physiologic temperature was reduced only to 40% of that observed in the cold when intact tissues were used for assay. Neuronal (clonazepam-displaceable) receptor binding was essentially unaffected by changes in temperature; however, non-neuronal (Ro5-4864-displaceable) binding was reduced to 25% of that of 0 degrees C. A relatively high-affinity (Kd approximately 24 nM) as well as a low-affinity (Kd approximately 200 nM) binding site were identified; the numbers of binding sites were only modestly reduced at physiologic temperature and probably reflect a predominant reduction in non-neuronal sites.", 
    "57": "The involvement of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the vagal-stimulated reflex inhibition of sympathetic nerve discharge (SND) was investigated in the cat. Computer summation was used to assess the sympathoinhibitory response to vagal afferent stimulation and the resultant changes seen with agents known to effect GABAergic neurotransmission. The GABA antagonists picrotoxin and bicuculline at 0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg i.v. attenuated the vagal sympathetic inhibitory response, but increased the 1:1 locking of SND to the arterial pulse. Conversely, the GABA agonist diazepam at 0.3 mg/kg i.v. potentiated the vagal sympathoinhibition, reduced total SND and diminished SND locking to the arterial pulse. Picrotoxin also blocked the vagal sympathoinhibitory response in midcollicular transected cats and when applied topically to the dorsal brain stem. Midcollicular transection forestalled the irregular SND spiking normally seen with picrotoxin in the intact cat, thus resulting in improved 3 cycle/sec SND periodicity. None of these drug-induced changes effected the SND shutoff response to vasopressor tests, however. These results suggest that GABA plays a role in the SND inhibitory response to vagal afferent stimulation in the brain stem, independent of the sinoarterial baroreceptors, and may also be involved in the entrainment of SND to the arterial pulse.", 
    "58": "The electroencephalographic (EEG) effects of inverse benzodiazepine (BDZ) agonists have been studied in rabbits after i.v. administration. A dose-dependent progression of three different stages of EEG changes have been observed with inverse BDZ agonists. At first, trains of slow waves in the occipital cortex occur, followed by trains of spike-and-wave complexes in the sensorimotor cortex. These two stages are superimposed on a desynchronized cortical activity, accompanied by an enhancement of the hippocampal theta rhythm. These EEG changes parallel a state of alertness. The third stage is characterized by generalized grand-mal seizures made up of high voltage spikes in the cortical and subcortical brain areas accompanied by generalized tonico-clonic convulsions. No modification of electrical activity is observed at the level of the spinal cord. Methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) (at doses higher than 0.2 mg/kg) and 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) (at doses higher than 0.4 mg/kg) elicit all three stages, whereas ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) (0.2-2 mg/kg) and N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (2-20 mg/kg) only elicit the first two, and finally CGS 8216 only the first. The extent of the EEG progression by inverse BDZ agonists may therefore be used as an index of the efficacy of each compound. The BDZ antagonists Ro 15-1788 and Ro 15-3505 (0.3 mg/kg or higher), which do not change the EEG pattern, block the effects of the convulsant and subconvulsant doses of the inverse BDZ agonists, giving rise to a desynchronized EEG pattern.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "59": "When rat brain membranes were incubated with [3H]flunitrazepam in the presence of UV light, predominantly one protein (P51) was irreversibly labeled in cerebellum and at least two proteins (P51 and P55) were labeled in hippocampus. On digestion of membranes with increasing concentrations of trypsin up to 40% of radioactivity irreversibly bound to proteins was removed from the membranes. In addition, P51 was nearly completely degraded to a peptide with apparent molecular weight 39,000 and this peptide was further degraded to a peptide with apparent molecular weight 25,000. In contrast, protein P55 was only partially degraded by trypsin and yielded two proteolytic peptides with apparent molecular weights 42,000 and 45,000 which seemed to be rather stable against further attack by trypsin. Membranes treated with trypsin still had the capacity to bind [3H]-flunitrazepam reversibly with an affinity similar to that of membranes not previously treated with trypsin. When these membranes were irradiated with UV light, the same proteolytic peptides were detected as in membranes first photolabeled and then digested with trypsin. These results suggest a close association between reversible and irreversible benzodiazepine binding sites and indicate that membrane-associated proteins P51 and P55 are differentially protected against degradation by trypsin.", 
    "60": "Radiation inactivation was used to estimate the molecular weight of the benzodiazepine (BZ), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and associated chloride ionophore (picrotoxinin/barbiturate) binding sites in frozen membranes prepared from rat forebrain. The target size of the BZ recognition site (as defined by the binding of the agonists [3H]diazepam and [3H]flunitrazepam, the antagonists [3H]Ro 15-1788 and [3H]CGS 8216, and the inverse agonist [3H]ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) averaged 51,000 +/- 2,000 daltons. The presence or absence of GABA during irradiation had no effect on the target size of the BZ recognition site. The apparent molecular weight of the GABA binding site labelled with [3H]muscimol was identical to the BZ receptor when determined under identical assay conditions. However the target size of the picrotoxinin/barbiturate binding site labelled with the cage convulsant [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate was about threefold larger (138,000 daltons). The effects of lyophilization on BZ receptor binding activity and target size analysis were also determined. A decrease in the number of BZ binding sites (Bmax) was observed in the nonirradiated, lyophilized membranes compared with frozen membranes. Lyophilization of membranes prior to irradiation at -135 degrees C or 30 degrees C resulted in a 53 and 151% increase, respectively, in the molecular weight (target size) estimates of the BZ recognition site when compared with frozen membrane preparations. Two enzymes were also added to the membrane preparations for subsequent target size analysis. In lyophilized preparations irradiated at 30 degrees C, the target size for beta-galactosidase was also increased 71% when compared with frozen membrane preparations. In contrast, the target size for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was not altered by lyophilization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "Acute experiments on mice were made to investigate the anticonvulsant activity of diazepam and its combination with nicotinamide in experimental seizures induced by corazol, picrotoxin, bicucullin and thiosemicarbazide. It was shown that diazepam (0.2-1.6 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent anticonvulsant effect in all models under study. Nicotinamide (250 mg/kg) substantially reduced the animals' lethality and seizure manifestations induced by picrotoxin and completely protected some of the animals from the bicucullin-induced seizures. Nicotinamide (250 mg/kg) potentiated the anticonvulsant effect of diazepam in all the experimental seizures under study. Micotinamide had a more pronounced effect in respect of the protection of the animals from tonic seizures as compared with clonic ones. The data suggest that the mechanisms of the anticonvulsant action of nicotinamide are mediated via the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "62": "Although gastric acidity is essential for the development of DU, the pathogenesis is more complex and includes an imbalance in the \"defending\" forces, mainly in mucous secretion, prostaglandin and bicarbonate synthesis and cell turnover. The new drugs available for inhibition of acid secretion, ulcer isolation and cytoprotection make it possible to attack the problem from different sites. The decision of which drug to choose should take into account side effects, drug interactions, cost and recurrence.", 
    "63": "Benzodiazepines currently represent the most widely prescribed family of hypnotic drugs. They possess obvious advantages: actual hypnotic efficacy, at least with short-term use, low toxicity, and excellent tolerance. However, several side effects need to be mentioned: besides morning drowsiness (which represents the untoward continuation of their sedative properties), anterograde amnesia, increase of daytime anxiety, and rebound insomnia. Moreover, benzodiazepines significantly modify several sleep parameters: they decrease slow wave sleep and delay the first period of REM sleep. Any hypnotic benzodiazepine should only be prescribed in case of actual need and after exclusion of non-pharmacologic means. The \"softest\" agent, at the lowest dose, and during the shortest period should always be preferred.", 
    "64": "Belgium was one of the 71 States represented at the United Nations Conference that took place in Vienna in 1971 for the introduction of a protocol on psychotropic substances. The Conference decided that the measures taken had to be coordinated and universal and the psychotropic substances were registered in four Tables. The Committee of Narcotics has decided, on the Vienna session from 6 to 10 February 1984, to register 33 benzodiazepines in Table IV. In Belgium, sales of the entirety of drugs slightly decreased (4% from 1974 to 1980) and sales of antibiotics shrunk a little (0,39% decrease from 1976 to 1979), while sales of benzodiazepines strongly progressed (21% from 1976 to 1980).", 
    "65": "An accumulation of research results, laboratory and clinic, leads to revise the classification of disorders of anxious nature (anxiety disorders according to the DSM-III). An empirical confirmation allows to separate anxious states from panic attack and phobic behavior constituting a component separated from generalized anxiety, exaggerated emotional reactions to stress agents and obsessive-compulsive disorders. The response to pharmacotherapeutic agents and the important number of anxiety depression and mixed depression tends to make permeable the separating line between the nosological entities anxiety and depression. The observations of subjects suffering from endogenous anxiety obliges to revise the classification by introducing three varieties of neurotic anxiety: phobic endogenous anxiety, endogenous anxiety without phobic formation, and exogenous anxiety. Endogenous anxiety is close to the concept of anxious thymopathy. By its pragmatic conception, modifications obtained by psychoactive agents are used (antidepressants of the group imipramine and IMAO, classical benzodiazepines and alprazolam, provocation controlled in laboratory) in order to strengthen innovating hypotheses and allow to elaborate useful treatment strategies for neuroses.", 
    "66": "The author establishes reports between humoral disorders and anxiety disorders. The relative use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of depressive states is analyzed and a simple drug treatment schedule is proposed.", 
    "67": "It is commonly thought that central nervous system depressant drugs exert their actions through enhancement of gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA)-mediated mechanisms. Recently, the cellular electrophysiological evidence from this laboratory and others suggests that both sedative hypnotics and general anaesthetics inhibit central neurons by increasing potassium conductance (GK). We have utilized the mammalian in vitro hippocampal and cerebellar slice preparations at 34-36 degrees C. Intracellular recordings from CA1, CA3, and cerebellar Purkinje cells were obtained. Low dose (sedative) concentrations of ethanol (less than or equal to 20 mM), two different benzodiazepines (midazolam and clonazepam in low nanomolar concentrations), and pentobarbital (10(-6) to 10(-4) M) were applied by pressure ejection or were bath perfused. All drugs caused a hyperpolarization with decreased spontaneous activity, and enhanced post spike afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs). These long-lasting AHPs are presumably due to enhanced calcium-mediated GK. Increased responsiveness to focally applied GABA was only seen at higher doses (ethanol, 100 mM; midazolam, 10(-7) M; pentobarbital, 10(-4) M). These data suggest that the above neurodepressant drugs, when applied at sedative doses to hippocampal pyramidal cells, enhance GK and not the actions of GABA.", 
    "68": "The effects of various benzodiazepine tranquillizers (clobazam 20 mg, bromazepam 6 mg and lorazepam 2 mg) were investigated by posturography in 16 subjects in a controlled trial. Twelve received each of the three anxiolytics for 1 week in a cross-over design, four received placebo for 1 week during the three successive treatment periods. A pharmacodynamic study was carried out after the first administration, and another assessment was done after 1 week of treatment. The first administration of lorazepam caused the most marked disturbances of body sway (increase of spectral energies, length and amplitude of the stabilogram). The first administration of bromazepam was also accompanied by an increase of the posturographic parameters, although less marked. Administration of clobazam did not produce any impairment of equilibrium, indicating that it is devoid of any sedative effect measurable by posturography. No changes of the postural sway can be detected on the measurement recorded 10 h after the last dose of 1 week's treatment.", 
    "69": "Treatments which increase gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission or those which cause stimulation of benzodiazepine receptors, produce anxiolytic effects; but the converse (anxiogenic) effects have not been reported after suppression of either system alone. We report here that simultaneous inhibition of these two systems produces anxiogenic effects. After partial depletion of GABA by isoniazid, the benzodiazepine antagonists, RO 15-1788 and CGS8216, produced pentobarbital reversible anxiogenic effects in the pentylenetetrazol discrimination assay. These results support the hypothesis that GABA and endogenous anxiolytics mutually facilitate modulation of anxiety. They also indicate that there may exist endogenous anxiogenics which act at non-benzodiazepine recognition sites.", 
    "70": "Tolerance to the anticonvulsant action of benzodiazepines was studied in rats that had been treated for 4 weeks with 100-150 mg/kg per day of flurazepam. Previous studies had shown that this treatment produced tolerance to motor impairment induced by benzodiazepines and also down-regulation of benzodiazepine receptors in brain, which was seen as a reduced number of binding sites with no change in binding affinity. In the present study, seizures were produced using pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). In rats that had been chronically treated with flurazepam, pretreatment with diazepam was significantly less effective in blocking pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures, thus indicating tolerance. This tolerance could not be explained by a change in sensitivity to pentylenetetrazol resulting from chronic treatment, nor by any differences in levels of active drug in the brain following doses of diazepam. Residual amounts of flurazepam and its active metabolites may have artifactually reduced the apparent degree of tolerance measured 12 hr after the end of chronic treatment, but not at later times. Tolerance to the antipentylenetetrazol action of diazepam was evident up to the fourth day following chronic treatment with flurazepam, but tolerance had largely disappeared a week after chronic treatment. The duration of tolerance was much longer than that reported for tolerance to motor impairment induced by benzodiazepines, and for down-regulation of receptors. These results suggest that different mechanisms or different neural systems must mediate tolerance to these different actions of benzodiazepines. Furthermore, an adaptive reduction in the number of benzodiazepine receptors does not seem to be a likely mechanism for tolerance to the anticonvulsant action of these drugs.", 
    "71": "The techniques of theoretical chemistry have been used to elucidate the molecular properties and modes of receptor binding that modulate receptor affinity and antagonist activity of the beta-carbolines, a class of potent benzodiazepine antagonists. Six analogs were chosen in order to investigate the role of the amine (NH) group, the aromatic nitrogen, and the C3-substituent in determining receptor affinities. Electrostatic potential mapping and characterization of explicit drug-receptor interactions have led to the hypothesis that simultaneous interaction of a model cationic arginine site with the N2 and C3-substituents could play a key role in determining receptor affinities. The electron-withdrawing effects of C3-substituents on the amine nitrogen appear less important, though interactions of these groups with an anionic glutamate or aspartate site could also occur at the receptor. Similarly, stacking interactions with neutral or cationic aromatic residues such as tryptophan or protonated histidine could occur, but do not appear to be determinants of the relative receptor affinity of the beta-carbolines.", 
    "72": "The benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 was administered in a 10-mg intravenous bolus dose to seven healthy young adult volunteers to evaluate the drug's efficacy and duration of action against midazolam. A steady state serum concentration of midazolam was obtained by an initial fast infusion rate of 6.0 mg/min (duration: 10 min) and a maintenance infusion rate of 0.275 mg/min. After administering the antagonist, all subjects opened their eyes without any command in a median time of 36 s (range: 28-48 s). Their personal, temporal and local orientation was reestablished within 54-120 s (median time: 65 s). The subjects fell deeply asleep, again in a median time of 145 min (range: 115-150 min), which was interpreted as an indication of the returning action of midazolam, which was infused for a total period of 210 min. Ro 15-788 deserves further study as an antagonist, since it could prove useful in the management of benzodiazepine overdosage and in the reversal of benzodiazepine action following surgical anesthesia and in the intensive care.", 
    "73": "Three patients receiving alprazolam developed, within days after beginning treatment, acute excitatory states with features more suggestive of mania than of disinhibition syndrome. The authors suggest a neurochemical link between mania and disinhibitory states.", 
    "74": "Several serious questions exist regarding the diagnostic classification of anxiety disorders. The authors examine the diagnostic validity of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder and explore their relationship to major depression, critically reviewing relevant descriptive, lifetime occurrence, family and genetic, drug treatment, and neurobiological studies. There is strong support for the diagnostic validity of panic disorder, but few data are found to support a separate diagnostic classification of generalized anxiety disorder. In addition, several lines of evidence suggest that a common vulnerability may exist for some forms of panic disorder and major depression. The implications of these findings for diagnostic application, treatment, and future research are discussed.", 
    "75": "Diagnosis of Alzheimer-type dementia is made by excluding other causes of dementia. This type of dementia is not well understood, but affects one million persons in the United States. Ergoloid mesylates are sometimes useful. A promising approach may be increasing brain cholinergic activity through combinations of drugs, such as lecithin and physostigmine. Sleep disturbances and impulsivity may both respond to benzodiazepines. Other drugs are being studied, but nonpharmacologic strategies may accomplish more.", 
    "76": "On a residential research ward, the acute effects of placebo, 0.5 to 3.0 mg of triazolam (TZ) and 100 to 600 mg of pentobarbital (PTB) were examined using a within-subject, double-blind design in male volunteers with documented histories of drug abuse. Drug effects were examined through the use of subject ratings including measures of drug liking and estimates of street value, staff ratings, objective psychomotor/cognitive performance measures, subject estimates of performance, immediate and delayed recognition memory tasks and subject ratings of nighttime sleep quality. Staff ratings and objective performance measures showed that TZ and PTB produced comparable dose-related impairment; TZ had a more rapid onset and a shorter duration of action than PTB. With these measures, TZ was 159 to 274 times more potent than PTB. With subject-rated measures of drug effect, sleepiness and drunkenness, in contrast, TZ produced smaller effects than PTB or was only 135 to 163 times more potent than PTB. Similarly, with subject ratings of drug liking and estimated street value, TZ produced smaller effects than PTB and was only 91 to 122 times more potent than PTB. Other results showed that TZ produced greater amnestic effects than PTB and subjects under the influence of TZ more consistently underestimated the degree of their impairment. Overall, these results suggest that TZ has a lower liability for abuse (likelihood) than PTB, but a greater liability of abuse (hazard) with regard to performance impairment on certain kinds of tasks."
