To demonstrate the relative importance of OATPs and CYP3A4 in the hepatic elimination of atorvastatin in vivo, a clinical cassette microdose study was performed. A cocktail consisting of a microdose of atorvastatin along with probe substrates for OATPs (pravastatin) and CYP3A4 (midazolam) was orally administered to eight healthy volunteers. The pharmacokinetics of this cocktail was observed at baseline, after an oral dose of 600 mg rifampicin (an inhibitor of OATPs), and after an intravenous dose of 200 mg itraconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor). Rifampicin increased the pravastatin dose-normalized area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) (4.6-fold), and itraconazole significantly increased the midazolam dose-normalized AUC (1.7-fold). The atorvastatin dose-normalized AUC increased 12-fold when coadministered with rifampicin but did not change when coadministered with itraconazole.

The juvenile (subacute), chronic, and adult-onset variants of hexosaminidase A deficiency have later onsets, slower progression, and more variable neurologic findings, including: progressive dystonia, spinocerebellar degeneration, motor neuron disease, and, in some individuals with adult-onset disease, a bipolar form of psychosis.",

Molecular genetic testing of HEXA, the only gene in which mutations cause hexosaminidase A deficiency, is used primarily to: (1) distinguish pseudodeficiency alleles from disease-causing mutations in healthy individuals with apparent deficiency of HEX A enzymatic activity identified in population screening programs; and to (2) identify the specific disease-causing mutations in an affected individual to allow for genetic counseling of at-risk family members.",

    "50": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced ROS release (RIRR) is a fundamental mechanism by which cardiac mitochondria respond to elevated ROS levels by stimulating endogenous ROS production in a regenerative, autocatalytic process that ultimately results in global oxidative stress (OS), cellular dysfunction and death. Despite elegant studies describing the phenomenon of RIRR under artificial conditions such as photo-induced oxidation of discrete regions within cardiomyocytes, the existence, biophysical properties and functional consequences of RIRR in intact myocardium remain unclear. Here, we used a semi-quantitative approach of optical superoxide (O(2)(-)) mapping using dihydroethidium (DHE) fluorescence to explore RIRR, its arrhythmic consequences and underlying mechanisms in intact myocardium. Initially, perfusion of rat hearts with 200 \u03bcM H(2)O(2) for 40 min (n = 4) elicited two distinct O(2)(-) peaks that were readily distinguished by their timing and amplitude. The first peak (P1), which was generated rapidly (within 5-8 min of H(2)O(2) perfusion) was associated with a relatively limited (10 \u00b1 2%) rise in normalized O(2)(-) levels relative to baseline. In contrast, the second peak (P2) occurred 19-26 min following onset of H(2)O(2) perfusion and was associated with a significantly greater amplitude compared to P1. Spatio-temporal ROS mapping during P2 revealed active O(2)(-) propagation across the myocardium at a velocity of ~20 \u03bcm s(-1). Exposure of hearts (n = 18) to a short (10 min) episode of H(2)O(2) perfusion revealed consistent generation of P2 by high (\u2265200 \u03bcM, 8/8) but not lower (\u2264100 \u03bcM, 3/8) H(2)O(2) concentrations (P < 0.03). In these hearts, onset of P2 occurred following, not during, the 10 min OS protocol, consistent with RIRR. Importantly, P2 (+) hearts exhibited a markedly greater (by 3.8-fold, P < 0.001) arrhythmia score compared to P2 (-) hearts. To explore the mechanism underlying RIRR in intact myocardium, hearts were perfused with either cyclosporin A (CsA) or 4-chlorodiazepam (4-Cl-DZP) to inhibit the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) or the inner membrane anion channel (IMAC), respectively. Surprisingly, perfusion with CsA failed to suppress (P = 0.75, n.s.) or even delay H(2)O(2)-induced P2 or the incidence of arrhythmias compared to untreated hearts. In sharp contrast, perfusion with 4-Cl-DZP markedly blunted O(2)(-) levels during P2, and suppressed the incidence of sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF). Finally, perfusion of hearts with the synthetic superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic EUK-134 completely abolished the H(2)O(2)-mediated RIRR response as well as the incidence of arrhythmias. These findings extend the concept of RIRR to the level of the intact heart, establish regenerative O(2)(-) production as the mediator of RIRR-related arrhythmias and reveal their strong dependence on IMAC and not the mPTP in this acute model of OS.",

Nineteen patients had blood and/or urine analyzed using GC/MS. MDPV was detected in 13 of 17 live patients (range 24-241 ng/mL, mean 58 ng/mL). The four samples with no drug detected, reported last use of bath salts >20 h prior to presentation. Three of five patients had MDPV detected in urine (range 34-1386 ng/mL, mean 856 ng/mL). No mephedrone or methylone was detected in any sample. Quantitative analysis performed on postmortem samples detected MDPV in blood at 170 ng/mL and in urine at 1400 ng/mL. No other synthetic cathinones were detected.",

Mean and categorical changes in metabolic parameters were analyzed. Mean changes in weight, glucose, and most lipids were generally not significantly different between treatment groups. Weight changes over time followed similar patterns and were not significantly different at endpoint between the two treatment-formulation groups. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased significantly less among olanzapine LAI-treated patients. Percentages of patients with potentially clinically significant changes in blood glucose and lipid concentrations were similar for the two treatments. Percentages of patients experiencing adverse events related to weight, diabetes, or dyslipidemia were also not significantly different between treatments. Metabolic changes in patients with schizophrenia appeared generally similar during treatment with oral olanzapine or olanzapine LAI.",

Children in group M (n = 42) were premedicated with 0.5 mg kg oral midazolam and children in group MH (n = 42) were premedicated with 0.5 mg kg oral midazolam and 1 mg kg hydroxyzine given 30 min before anaesthesia induction. A caudal epidural block was performed following anaesthesia induction. Induction quality, parental separation scores and emergence agitation were evaluated. Emergence agitation was evaluated with the PAED score (Paediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium) every 5 min during the first 30 min after admission to recovery room. Induction quality and parental separation were assessed with 4-point scores. Postoperative pain was evaluated with the 10-point Children's and Infants' Postoperative Pain Scale.",

Furthermore, the midazolam and hydroxyzine combination provided better premedication quality than midazolam alone.", 
    "75": "Analytical improvements were developed and validated for measuring select personal care products (PCPs) and two pharmaceuticals in fish tissue. The method was validated using fortified fillet tissue for twelve PCPs including fragrance materials, alkylphenols, photo initiators, and triclosan as well as two pharmaceuticals including carbamazepine (anti-seizure) and diazepam (anti-convulsant). The analytical method utilized pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) combined with silica gel cleanup, gel permeation chromatography, and gas chromatography ion-trap tandem mass spectrometry. Silica gel cleanup was combined with the PLE to produce one automated extraction/cleanup technique. This analytical improvement served to reduce the incurred cost, time, and loss of potential target analytes associated with independent cleanup steps. The combined extraction/cleanup technique resulted in an average increase of 10% in analyte recoveries. Average triplicate recoveries and relative standard deviations for the entire method, using 2.5 g of fish fillet tissue, were 92 \u00b1 9% (recoveries ranged from 64 to 131%). The sensitivity of the analytical methods was improved by optimizing the resonant collision induced dissociation energy to the hundredths place (0.01 V). Improvements in ion production range from 24 to 122% for six of the 12 PCPs. Statistically derived method detection limits (MDLs) were also lowered on average by a factor of 8 and ranged from 1.2 to 38 ng/g wet weight. MDLs for carbamazepine and diazepam were 18 and 3.7 ng/g wet weight, respectively. Galaxolide and tonalide were measured in an environmental sample at concentrations of 81 and 5.5 ng/g wet weight, respectively.", 
    "76": "The specificity of the response of an organism is an important variable influencing stress-related parameters and psychopathological states. We have shown that trait anxiety in C57BL/6 mice, determined by their emergence latencies in the free choice open field test, positively correlates with the long-term behavioral and neuroendocrinological changes induced by a stressor. Here, we show that this interindividual variability is caused by a different reactivity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis upon exposure to a stressor. Mice with high trait anxiety (long emergence latency, LEL) display a more pronounced stress-induced activation of the HPA axis than mice with low trait anxiety (short emergence latency, SEL). Moreover, stress-induced activation of tyrosine hydroxylase and corticotropin-releasing hormone occurred in LEL but not SEL mice. In search of the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences, we found that under non-stressed conditions mRNA and protein levels of the glucocorticoid receptor in the hippocampus were higher in LEL mice compared to SEL mice. Also, systemic injection of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 decreased the stress-induced activation of the HPA axis and the long-term anxiogenic effects of stress observed in LEL mice. Finally, the rewarding properties of cocaine were enhanced in LEL mice compared to SEL mice, suggesting a causal link between trait anxiety, stress activity and the behavioral responses to drugs of addiction.", 
    "77": "Older people tend to have multiple comorbid conditions and subsequent polypharmacy, which place them at higher risk of adverse drug events, drug-drug and drug-disease interactions and IP. IP includes several patterns, such as inappropriate dose or duration, prescribing drugs having significant drug-disease or drug-drug interactions, and the omission of potentially beneficial medications. The main purpose was to evaluate the prevalence of IP among medical inpatients in a medical center, so to evaluate the associative factors of IP in Taiwan. From January to December of 2009, all patients aged 65 years and older who were discharged from the medical wards of Taipei Veterans General Hospital were randomly sampled for study (the sampling rate around 1.0%). The IP was evaluated by the STOPP and START criteria. Each medical record was carefully reviewed by physicians who had been trained. Overall, 520 records of elderly medical ward inpatients (mean age = 79.2 \u00b1 6.7 years, 73.8% males) were included for study. In total, 3455 items of medication were prescribed for these 520 patients (mean = 6.6 \u00b1 3.2 items). According to STOPP criteria, 36.2% of the study subjects had at least one potentially inappropriate medication (PIM). The most common PIMs were: (1) medications that may adversely affect those who are prone to falls, e.g., benzodiazepines, neuroleptics and first generation antihistamines (14.2%). (2) Ca-channel blockers with chronic constipation (12.3%). (3) Use of neuroleptic agents (5.6%). (4) Long-term, long-acting benzodiazepines (2.5%). (5) Prolonged use of first generation antihistamines (2.1%). Besides, 218 patients (41.9%) had at least one potentially prescribing omission (PPO). Common PPOs included: (1) statin therapy in diabetes mellitus if coexisting major cardiovascular risk factors present (19.0%). (2) Antiplatelet therapy in diabetes mellitus with co-existing major cardiovascular risk factors (12.5%). (3) Metformin with type 2 diabetes with or without metabolic syndrome (in the absence of renal impairment) (8.7%). (4) Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blockers with chronic heart failure (7.3%). (5) Aspirin or clopidogrel with a documented history of atherosclerotic coronary, cerebral or peripheral vascular disease in patients with sinus rhythm (7.1%). Logistic regression showed that older age and number of medications were significant risk factors for PIMs. In conclusion, the prevalence of PIMs among elderly medical inpatients in a medical center in Taiwan was 36.2% and PPOs was 41.9%. Further study is needed to clarify the underlying causes of potentially IP to promote better quality of prescribing for older patients.", 
    "78": "In rodents, administration of a mixture of the psychostimulant d-amphetamine and the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide results in supra-additive hyperlocomotion, a phenomenon used to identify mood stabilizers. In an attempt to determine whether the d-amphetamine/chlordiazepoxide assay could extend to other behaviors that are affected in mania, we evaluated the effects of the mixture on prepulse inhibition. In addition, we combined chlordiazepoxide with the selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor GBR 12909 or the noradrenergic stimulant (-) ephedrine, and tested these alternative mixtures in locomotor activity and prepulse inhibition tests. Chlordiazepoxide (3mg/kg) robustly potentiated amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, but did not change the amphetamine-induced disruption of prepulse inhibition. This indicates that the d-amphetamine-chlordiazepoxide-induced hyperlocomotion does not extend to other dopamine-driven behaviors. GBR 12909 (16mg/kg) and (-) ephedrine (50mg/kg) both enhanced locomotor activity and disrupted PPI, but combined treatment of either of these compounds with chlordiazepoxide had no significant additive effect on locomotor activity or prepulse inhibition. These findings suggest that the effect of the d-amphetamine/chlordiazepoxide mixture cannot be accounted for by the dopamine enhancing properties of amphetamine alone. Last, valproic acid (120-240mg/kg) did not reduce the GBR-induced hyperactivity. Therefore, further pharmacological evaluation of GBR 12909-induced hyperactivity is warranted to determine its pharmacological potential to model mania-like behavior. Based on the current results, it is concluded that the utility of the pharmacological d-amphetamine/chlordiazepoxide assay as a tool to study brain mechanisms relevant to mania is limited.", 
    "79": "Early maternal deprivation (MD), 24h of dam-litter separation on postnatal day (PND) 9, has been proposed as a suitable animal model to investigate some neuropsychiatric disorders with a base in neurodevelopment that also compromises metabolic and endocrine homeostasis. Atypical antipsychotics are frequently prescribed to children and adolescents as first-line treatment for several mental disorders despite the adverse metabolic effects frequently reported. However, persistent long-term effects after adolescent drug therapy have been scarcely investigated. In the present study we aimed to investigate the long-lasting metabolic and behavioral effects of MD in combination with the administration of an atypical antipsychotic, i.e. olanzapine, during adolescence. For that purpose, male and female Wistar rats not exposed (control group, Co) and exposed to the MD protocol were administered with oral olanzapine (Olan, 7.5mg/kg/day) or vehicle (Vh, 1mM acetic acid) in drinking water from PND 28 to PND 49. Body weight gain, glycaemia and plasma triglyceride (TG) levels were evaluated as relevant metabolic parameters. MD significantly diminished body weight gain, while Olan administration only induced a subtle decrease in body weight gain among female animals in the long-term. Olan discontinuation decreased plasma TG levels in adult rats, an effect that was counteracted by neonatal exposure to the MD protocol. Both MD and Olan treatment impaired cognitive function in the novel object recognition test, although no interaction between treatments was observed. Neither MD nor Olan administration affected psychotic-related symptoms evaluated in the prepulse inhibition task, although animals treated with Olan showed an increased reactivity to the first acoustic stimulus. MD diminished the corticosterone stress-induced response among females, and reduced the expression of CB1 receptors in the hippocampus of both male and female rats. Notably, Olan administration tended to counterbalance these two MD-induced effects (i.e. corticosterone response and CB1 receptor expression). Present findings provide evidence for the long-lasting effects of neonatal MD and Olan administration during adolescence, and suggest some sex-dependent interactions between these two protocols. Further research on the interactions between early life stress and antipsychotic drugs is urgently needed, and sex differences should be consistently considered both in animal models and in translation to human studies.",

Arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n-6) plays a critical role in brain signaling and an up-regulated AA metabolic cascade was reported in postmortem brains from bipolar disorder patients. In this study, we tested whether, similar to the action of the mood stabilizers lithium, carbamazepine and valproate, chronic OLZ treatment would reduce AA turnover in rat brain. We administered OLZ (6 mg/kg/day) or vehicle i.p. to male rats once daily for 21 days. A washout group received 21 days of OLZ followed by vehicle on day 22. Two hours after the last injection, [1-\u00b9\u2074C]AA was infused intravenously for 5 min, and timed arterial blood samples were taken. After the rat was killed at 5 min, its brain was microwaved, removed and analyzed. Chronic OLZ decreased plasma unesterified AA concentration, AA incorporation rates and AA turnover in brain phospholipids. These effects were absent after washout. Consistent with reduced AA turnover, OLZ decreased brain cyclooxygenase activity and the brain concentration of the proinflammatory AA-derived metabolite, prostaglandin E\u2082, In view of up-regulated brain AA metabolic markers in bipolar disorder, the abilities of OLZ and the mood stabilizers to commonly decrease prostaglandin E\u2082, and AA turnover in rat brain phospholipids, albeit by different mechanisms, may be related to their efficacy against the disease.", 
    "101": "Children with burn injuries receive a broad range of medications, from analgesics to antipsychotics, but how utilization of these drugs differs from one pediatric burn center to another is unclear. This study examined utilization patterns of six categories of medication administered acutely to burned children as a first step in creating evidence-based practice guidelines. Six medications administered to pediatric patients enrolled in a multicenter study were recorded from patient charts using a standardized chart review template. The medication categories included opiates, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, beta-blockers, two different anesthetics, and antipsychotics. Data were analyzed by \u03c7 and logistical regression analysis. Analysis of data from three sites and 470 patients revealed significant differences in prescription patterns across hospitals for all medication groups except opiates. Differences were significant for benzodiazepines and antidepressants (\u03c7 = 7.3; P < .01 for both) controlling for age, gender, race, language, burn size, and length of stay. Differences in prescribing patterns for beta-blockers and the anesthetics ketamine and propofol failed to reach statistical significance; however, the results did trend in that direction (\u03c7 = 3.8 and 3.4, respectively; P < .10 for both). The pharmacotherapeutic agents described in this study are an integral part of acute pediatric burn care, and yet there is variation in use of these medications among the centers. The differences in prescribing indicate that, for certain drugs, a range of approaches to pharmacotherapeutics is being used and suggest that evidence-based guidelines for administration of these agents need to be developed.", 
    "102": "The primary aim of the present study was to test diazepam (DZ) effect, a benzodiazepine (BDZ) usually prescribed to reduce anxiety and to induce sleep, on EEG activity while performing a visual sustained attention task. The EEG activity was recorded in a double-blind placebo experiment, and prestimulus spectral power and inter- and intrahemispheric temporal coupling were assessed during visual sustained attention task performance. A single DZ dose (5 mg) was enough to increase reaction times during visual sustained attention task responses. DZ decreased prestimulus EEG power in the 1- to 6-, 8- to 12-, and 19- to 35-Hz bands and disrupted right intrahemispheric temporal coupling in the \u03b1-frequency range (8-12 Hz). The combined reduction in power and temporal coupling suggests both local and interregional DZ-induced disruption of neuronal synchronicity especially in the right hemisphere in agreement with the prominent attention-related networks in this hemisphere. These data support the notion that the influence of DZ on behavior goes beyond sedative effects and can potentially compromise higher cognitive functions with negative consequences to daily life situations.",

Since opioids suppress GABA neuron activity, we conducted the first study to determine 1) whether the \u03bc opioid receptor (MOR), \u03b4 opioid receptor (DOR), and opioid ligand proenkephalin are altered in the PFC of a large cohort of schizophrenia subjects and 2) the postnatal developmental trajectory in monkey PFC of opioid markers that are altered in schizophrenia. We used quantitative polymerase chain reaction to measure mRNA levels from 42 schizophrenia and 42 matched healthy comparison subjects; 18 monkeys chronically exposed to haloperidol, olanzapine, or placebo; and 49 monkeys aged 1 week-11.5 years. We found higher levels for MOR mRNA (+27%) in schizophrenia but no differences in DOR or proenkephalin mRNAs. Elevated MOR mRNA levels in schizophrenia did not appear to be explained by substance abuse, psychotropic medications, or illness chronicity. Finally, MOR mRNA levels declined through early postnatal development, stabilized shortly before adolescence and increased across adulthood in monkey PFC. In schizophrenia, higher MOR mRNA levels may contribute to suppressed PFC GABA neuron activity and might be attributable to alterations in the postnatal developmental trajectory of MOR signaling.",

The genes encoding these enzymes have recently been cloned and their functions tentatively assigned, but there is limited biochemical evidence supporting the assignments of the last three steps. One enzyme, TomN, shows 58% pairwise sequence similarity with 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT), an enzyme found in a catabolic pathway for aromatic hydrocarbons. The TomN sequence includes three amino acids (Pro-1, Arg-11, and Arg-39) that have been identified as critical catalytic residues in 4-OT. However, the proposed substrate for TomN is very different from that processed by 4-OT. To establish the function and mechanism of TomN and its relationship with 4-OT, we conducted kinetic, mutagenic, and structural studies. The kinetic parameters for TomN, and four alanine mutants, P1A, R11A, R39A, and R61A, were determined using 2-hydroxymuconate, the substrate for 4-OT. The TomN-catalyzed reaction using this substrate compares favorably to that of 4-OT. In addition, the kinetic parameters for the P1A, R11A, and R39A mutants of TomN parallel the trends observed for the corresponding 4-OT mutants, implicating an analogous mechanism. A high-resolution crystal structure (1.4 \u00c5) of TomN shows that the overall structure and the active site region are highly similar to those of 4-OT with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.81 \u00c5. Moreover, key active site residues are positionally conserved. The combined results suggest that the tentative assignment for TomN and the proposed sequence of events in the biosynthetic pathway leading to the formation of the C ring of tomaymycin might not be correct. An alternative pathway that awaits biochemical confirmation is proposed.",

Psychosocial and clinicofunctional features typical for elderly people of behavioral type A and with diagnosed CHD and ways for treatment optimization and disease prophylaxis are being under consideration. We studied the clinical efficiency and influence of Anaprilin, Metoprolol, Phenazepam, non-medical methods on psychoendocrine parameters in CHD elderly patients with behavioral type A. In addition to positive changes in the anginal syndrome sleep, decreases in hot temper, irritability, anxiety, phobic manifestations, hypochondrial trends, and neurotic asthenization, increased working and social orientation were improved. During Anaprilin, Metoprolol, Phenazepam therapy, cardialgias reduced or disappered, the incidence of arrhythmia decreased. There was a reduction in the personality profile in the neurotic triad and psychoasthenia scales, the reactive anxiety diminished significantly, and levels of aldosterone, cortisol, triiodothyronine, and thyroxine in the blood decreased. Thus, supplementation of Anapriline, Metoprolol, Phenazepam to the combined therapy for patients with CHD of behavioral type A positively effected to the clinical course of the disease. Configuration of the personality profile was leveled in patients with CHD of coronary type, signs of behavioral type A decreased.", 
    "107": "Recently we have evaluated the role of glucocorticoids (GC) and other stress hormones in the pathogeny of age-related diseases. In order to perform this evaluation, we considered the DOHaD paradigm discussing long-term effects of adverse perinatal factors. In the present work, a part of the data collected previously was used for analyzing the role of GC in aging, as well as in age-related pharmacotherapy. The data were gathered in various databases, preferably in English, during the last 25-30 years. Although some authors suggest that GC can be considered as hormones of aging, the majority of investigators are quite careful in this respect. Nevertheless, it appears that the role of GC in various stages of ontogeny and transitions between them is well established. Besides, there are a lot of data that confirm a contribution of GC to the phenomena of perinatal programming/imprinting of adult diseases. What for the relationship between GC and aging, some studies confirm its existence, at least partially. Having analyzed the dynamics of morbidity and mortality of age-related diseases, we concluded on the absence of evidence in favor of unique general scheme of aging, where GC could play a role. However, in a rather paradoxal mode it was demonstrated that GC participate, at least indirectly, in the mechanisms of action of various drugs used for the treatment of cardiometabolic disorders (beta-blockers, angiotensin antagonists, some oral hypoglycemic agents) and neuropsychiatric diseases (antidepressants, antipsychotic agents, benzodiazepines and some anticonvulsive medicines), as well as in the effects of toxic agents (for example, drugs of abuse, including caffeine). Using the concept of hormesis, we discuss a reason for frequent utilization of these drugs, and not GC or their antagonists, in age-related pharmacotherapy. The caution is suggested in considering the essential function of GC in aging. Nevertheless, due to existence of theory that connects GC with aging via the mechanisms of allostasis, we are planning to elaborate a more detailed model that might include, besides GC, also some other hormones, cytokines, etc., as well as their interactions. It is stressed that the interactions of GC with other bioregulators should be reevaluated in a chronobiological mode, in order to strengthen the bases of chronopharmacotherapy. One of the principal challenges is the prevention of adverse effects of pharmacotherapy in long-term. In this sense, DOHaD paradigm has opened the discussion of possibility for pharmacotoxicologic programming / imprinting, an important question attracting the attention of researchers.",

Although methadone represented less than 5% of opioid prescriptions dispensed, one third of opioid-related deaths nationwide implicated methadone. Root causes identified by the panel were physician error due to knowledge deficits, patient non-adherence to the prescribed medication regimen, unanticipated medical and mental health comorbidities, including substance use disorders, and payer policies that mandate methadone as first-line therapy. Other likely contributors to all opioid-related deaths were the presence of additional central nervous system-depressant drugs (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, and antidepressants) and sleep-disordered breathing.", 
    "111": "Causes of opioid-related deaths are multifactorial, so solutions must address prescriber behaviors, patient contributory factors, nonmedical use patterns, and systemic failures.

Furthermore, our results do not demonstrate any additional risk associated with haloperidol when compared with alternative agents. Although pharmacovigilance data does not routinely include a denominator regarding frequency of use, regulatory agencies are currently advising against the use of intravenous haloperidol based on pharmacovigilance, but the number of overall reports is greater for quetiapine and olanzapine when compared to haloperidol. Improved pharmacovigilance approaches are needed to more accurately address the safe, effective use of medicines.",

    "129": "There is accumulating evidence that sex plays a critical role in drug abuse. Female sex hormones have been shown to affect central nervous system function and modulate the effects of drugs of abuse. For example, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor function is positively modulated by progesterone metabolites. There is evidence from preclinical in-vitro and in-vivo studies as well as some clinical research suggesting that progesterone and its metabolites may enhance the behavioral effects of benzodiazepines, which also serve as positive modulators of GABA(A) receptors. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the independent and combined discriminative stimulus, subjective and psychomotor effects of progesterone and triazolam in healthy adult premenopausal women. Oral micronized progesterone (100 mg), triazolam (0.06, 0.12 and 0.25 mg/70 kg) and placebo were administered to healthy, premenopausal women (n=9) under conditions of low circulating sex hormones. Triazolam alone functioned as a discriminative stimulus and produced prototypical sedative-like effects (e.g., performance impairment, enhanced reports of sedative effects). Progesterone alone produced sedative-like effects on several subjective and performance measures, and the dose combination effects of progesterone and triazolam on several subjective measures of drug effect were similar to the summation of the two drug effects in isolation. Progesterone did not substitute for or modify the discriminative stimulus effects of triazolam. These results suggest that the parent hormone, progesterone, and triazolam have discordant neuropharmacological mechanisms of action. Additional research is necessary to determine the degree to which neurosteroids influence sex differences in benzodiazepine use and abuse.", 
    "130": "Patients experiencing a dyspnea exacerbation will often report feeling smothered or suffocated. This highly distressing, prevalent, multidimensional symptom is the chief complaint signifying pulmonary dysregulation. Increasing dyspnea intensity heralds the onset of respiratory failure, leading to hospitalization and/or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Dyspnea can only be known from the patient's report about the personal experience. However, many ICU patients experience temporary or permanent cognitive impairment precluding a symptom report; thus, a behavioral assessment is indicated. Comprehensive dyspnea assessment informs subsequent treatment. Conventional treatment of dyspnea includes reducing or eliminating the underlying cause, mechanical ventilation, supplemental oxygen, balancing rest with activity, and positioning. Opioids and benzodiazepines reduce dyspnea and the associated fear or anxiety and are most often used to maintain ventilator-patient synchrony, in terminal illness or during the withdrawal of mechanical ventilation. Inhaled furosemide is under investigation as an alternative to opioids. The focus of this article is to provide an evidence-based approach to nursing assessment and management of dyspnea.",

Furthermore, Fa173 blocked the potentiation of GABA responses by high, but not low, concentrations of diazepam, but did not block the potentiation induced by propofol, the neurosteroid THP or the barbiturate thiopental. Mutational studies on 'anaesthetic-influencing' residues showed that, compared with wild-type GABA(A) receptors, \u03b11M236W\u03b22\u03b32L and \u03b11\u03b22N265S\u03b32L receptors are resistant to potentiation by etomidate, loreclezole and Fa131.",

The procedure involved the injection of clear supernatant extracts after centrifugation and provided limit of detection values ranging from 2.0 to 18 \u03bcg L(-1), and a precision, expressed as relative standard deviation, from 2.9% to 16%, depending on the different benzodiazepines studied. Those values are appropriate for their positive identification in saliva samples in which benzodiazepine concentration, after a chronic or acute dose, is in the range of 2-30 \u03bcg L(-1). Problems related with overlapped benzodiazepine signals have been successfully overcome by application of multivariate curve resolution, which is a helpful tool to improve the resolution of the technique, without sacrificing the method simplicity and frequency of analysis. The possibility of false positives caused by the presence of interferents with the same drift time as the benzodiazepines and the possibility of false negatives due to the presence of interferents by competitive ionization have been critically evaluated.

Baseline BMI predicted greater fasting glucose and HgbA1c levels at 12 months for both treatments. Early BMI change predicted fasting glucose levels at 6 months, but not HgbA1c or BMI, at either time point. For patients who received no concomitant mood stabilizers, early BMI change predicted 12 month HgbA1c values in the OLZ group, and 6- (but not 12-) month fasting glucose and HgbA1c values in the RIS group. Neither baseline BMI nor early BMI change consistently predicted increases in lipids with either drug. OLZ-treated patients with normal baseline BMI had greater increases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, and non-HDL-cholesterol than those who were overweight or obese. In conclusion, higher baseline BMI predicted adverse glycemic changes after 12 months with OLZ and RIS. Individuals with normal baseline BMI may be most susceptible to OLZ-induced hyperlipidosis. Frequency of metabolic screening should be independent of baseline BMI or rapid increases in BMI.",

    "172": "We have observed paroxysmal automatic movements including drum-beating and pedaling motions in three full-term neonates following intravenous bolus injections (0.1-0.3 mg/kg/dose) or drip infusions (0.2 mg/kg/h) of midazolam used for sedation. In one patient, abnormal movements were also induced by a bolus injection of midazolam during the EEG recording, and no change was revealed in the EEG during the episode. In another patient, abnormal movements were further worsened by an injection of diazepam. Interictal EEGs of all patients were normal. The clinical manifestations of these paroxysmal automatic movements and the mode of their appearance were quite similar in all patients. It is quite likely that abnormal movements in the patient without ictal EEG change do not have epileptic origin but brainstem release phenomenon induced by midazolam. Because the abnormal movements in the other two cases had similar clinical manifestations and mode of appearance, we suspected that these movements were also non-epileptic though ictal EEGs were not recorded in theses cases. When we encounter paroxysmal automatic movements mimicking neonatal seizures following intravenous midazolam administration, ictal EEG recordings are recommended. If there are no ictal changes, we should avoid treatment with anticonvulsant drugs for these movements. Since midazolam is frequently used in neonates for sedation during various examinations, future investigations on the selection of appropriate drugs and dosage for sedation in neonates, including the usage of midazolam, are necessary.",

Benzodiazepines - which non-selectively target GABA(A) receptors containing the \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13 or \u03b15 subunits - have been in clinical use for decades and are still among the most widely prescribed drugs for the treatment of insomnia and anxiety disorders. However, their use is limited by side effects and the risk of drug dependence.

    "179": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder. Recognition of neurobiological abnormalities associated with this condition suggests the potential efficacy of medication in its treatment. Nevertheless, questions regarding the efficacy of medications remain, despite general endorsement by clinical practice guidelines of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as first-line agents in treating PTSD. This paper reviews evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the efficacy of acute and long-term pharmacotherapy for PTSD, including the treatment of refractory PTSD. In addition, we conducted a systematic meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of different medications in treating PTSD. The effects of methodological study features (including year of publication, duration, number of centres) and sample characteristics (proportion of combat veterans, gender composition) were also tested. The largest body of evidence for short- and long-term efficacy of medication currently exists for SSRIs, with promising initial findings for the selective noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine and the atypical antipsychotic risperidone. Treatment effect was predicted by number of centres and recency of the study, with little evidence that sample characteristics predicted response. Evidence for the effectiveness of benzodiazepines is lacking, despite their continued use in clinical practice. Finally, the \u03b11 antagonist prazosin and the atypical antipsychotics show some efficacy in treatment-resistant PTSD. Adequately powered trials that are designed in accordance with best-practice guidelines are required to provide conclusive evidence of clinically relevant differences in efficacy between agents in treating PTSD, and to help estimate clinical and methodological predictors of treatment response.",

The present study investigated these relationships with a sample of clients enrolled in a low-threshold MMT program (i.e., clients are not expelled if they continue to use substances). Some clients enrolled in low-threshold programs may never achieve complete abstinence from all substances. Thus, understanding the possibly perpetuating relationships between concurrent substance use and psychiatric symptoms is important. Understanding such relationships may aid in developing possible target areas of treatment to reduce substance use and/or related harms in this population.",

Current non-prescribed benzodiazepine use was a predictor for increased severity (i.e., symptom count) of almost all anxiety and mood disorders assessed.

    "184": "Advances in resuscitation and critical care management have resulted in the survival of many patients despite severe brain damage. These patients may remain in coma or in vegetative state. The probability of recovery of conscious function is dependent on the extent of structural brain damage, which is difficult to assess by clinical, laboratory or functional tests. Positron emission tomography (PET) of 18F-fluordeoxyglucose (FDG) can be used to investigate metabolic and functional impairment of the brain. In acute vegetative state (AVS, duration <1 month), overall glucose utilization was significantly reduced in comparison with age-matched controls. In a few cases with locked-in syndrome, cortical metabolism was in the normal range. 11C-Flumazenil (FMZ) measures the density of benzodiazepine receptors (BZRs) and thereby furnishes an estimate of neuronal integrity. PET with this tracer demonstrated a considerable reduction in BZRs in cortical areas, but indicated that the cerebellum was spared from neuronal loss. The comparison of FDG- and FMZ-PET findings in AVS demonstrates that alterations of cerebral glucose consumption do not represent mere functional inactivation, but also irreversible structural damage. In some cases with minimally conscious state, auditory stimuli with emotional valence induced more brain activation (investigated by H215O-PET) than meaningless noise; such studies can be used to detect residual cortical function. To improve prognostication of chances for recovery, a combination of functional activation studies and assessment of the extent of neuronal damage might be the optimal procedure and should be tested in larger cohorts of patients with comatose states of different severity.",

Sample loading, washing, and elution of the target drugs were accomplished simply by centrifugation of the column. Opiates and benzodiazepines are abused throughout the world. Identification and quantification of these drugs is very important to solve crimes or the cause of death. Three opiates (morphine, codeine, and dihydrocodeine) were extracted from urine and serum by using the column. After conversion to trimethylsilyl derivatives of the opiates by vigorous mixing with the derivatizing reagent, the solution was subjected to GC/MS. A linear curve was observed for opiates from 10 to 2500 ng/mL in urine and 5 to 1200 ng/mL in serum, respectively (correlation coefficient > 0.996). For benzodiazepines, the hydroxyl metabolites of triazolam and etizolam were extracted from urine using the column, and the eluate was directly analyzed by HPLC/MS without evaporation. The LOD values were at the ppb level, with RSD values lower than 15%. The proposed methods were successfully applied to clinical and forensic cases, and good agreement of results was obtained compared to conventional methods.", 
    "186": "The current study was designed to investigate the mechanisms by which ropivacaine may act within the central nervous system (CNS) to produce cardiotoxicity. Eighty New Zealand rabbits were divided into four groups randomly. In Group 1, 20 rabbits received intracerebroventricular (icv) saline, and then received icv ropivacaine 30 min later. In Group 2, 20 rabbits received icv ropivacaine. Whenever dysrhythmias continued for more than 5 min, 0.1 ml saline was administered into the left cerebral ventricle. Ten minutes later, 0.1 ml midazolam was given into the left lateral ventricle. In Group 3, 20 rabbits received icv ropivacaine, and once the dysrhythmias developed, the inspired isoflurane concentration was increased from 0.75% to 1.50%. In Group 4, 20 animals received an intravenous (iv) phenylephrine infusion until dysrhythmias occurred. In Group 1, the rabbits did not develop dysrhythmias in response to icv saline, whereas dysrhythmias did develop in these animals after icv ropivacaine. In Group 2, icv saline had no effect on the dysrhythmias; however, icv midazolam terminated cardiac dysrhythmias. In Group 3, an increase in the concentration of the inspired isoflurane had no effect on dysrhythmias. In Group 4, icv midazolam had no effect on dysrhythmias in response to iv phenylephrine. Ropivacaine administered directly into the CNS is capable of producing cardiac dysrhythmias; midazolam terminated dysrhythmias presumably by potentiation of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor activity. Our results suggest that ropivacaine produces some of its cardiotoxicity not only by the direct cardiotoxicity of the drug, but also by the CNS effects of ropivacaine.",

    "195": "Plasmodium falciparum relies on anion channels activated in the erythrocyte membrane to ensure the transport of nutrients and waste products necessary for its replication and survival after invasion. The molecular identity of these anion channels, termed \"new permeability pathways\" is unknown, but their currents correspond to up-regulation of endogenous channels displaying complex gating and kinetics similar to those of ligand-gated channels. This report demonstrates that a peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, including the voltage dependent anion channel, is present in the human erythrocyte membrane. This receptor mediates the maxi-anion currents previously described in the erythrocyte membrane. Ligands that block this peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor reduce membrane transport and conductance in P falciparum-infected erythrocytes. These ligands also inhibit in vitro intraerythrocytic growth of P falciparum. These data support the hypothesis that dormant peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors become the \"new permeability pathways\" in infected erythrocytes after up-regulation by P falciparum. These channels are obvious targets for selective inhibition in anti-malarial therapies, as well as potential routes for drug delivery in pharmacologic applications.", 
    "196": "The balance of inhibitory to excitatory (I/E) synaptic inputs is thought to control information processing and behavioral output of the central nervous system. We sought to test the effects of the decreased or increased I/E ratio on visual circuit function and visually guided behavior in Xenopus tadpoles. We selectively decreased inhibitory synaptic transmission in optic tectal neurons by knocking down the \u03b32 subunit of the GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)R) using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides or by expressing a peptide corresponding to an intracellular loop of the \u03b32 subunit, called ICL, which interferes with anchoring GABA(A)R at synapses. Recordings of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) and miniature excitatory PSCs (mEPSCs) showed that these treatments decreased the frequency of mIPSCs compared with control tectal neurons without affecting mEPSC frequency, resulting in an \u223c50% decrease in the ratio of I/E synaptic input. ICL expression and \u03b32-subunit knockdown also decreased the ratio of optic nerve-evoked synaptic I/E responses. We recorded visually evoked responses from optic tectal neurons, in which the synaptic I/E ratio was decreased. Decreasing the synaptic I/E ratio in tectal neurons increased the variance of first spike latency in response to full-field visual stimulation, increased recurrent activity in the tectal circuit, enlarged spatial receptive fields, and lengthened the temporal integration window. We used the benzodiazepine, diazepam (DZ), to increase inhibitory synaptic activity. DZ increased optic nerve-evoked inhibitory transmission but did not affect evoked excitatory currents, resulting in an increase in the I/E ratio of \u223c30%. Increasing the I/E ratio with DZ decreased the variance of first spike latency, decreased spatial receptive field size, and lengthened temporal receptive fields. Sequential recordings of spikes and excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to the same visual stimuli demonstrated that decreasing or increasing the I/E ratio disrupted input/output relations. We assessed the effect of an altered I/E ratio on a visually guided behavior that requires the optic tectum. Increasing and decreasing I/E in tectal neurons blocked the tectally mediated visual avoidance behavior. Because ICL expression, \u03b32-subunit knockdown, and DZ did not directly affect excitatory synaptic transmission, we interpret the results of our study as evidence that partially decreasing or increasing the ratio of I/E disrupts several measures of visual system information processing and visually guided behavior in an intact vertebrate.", 
    "197": "Parvalbumin-positive (PV+) fast-spiking basket cells are thought to play key roles in network functions related to precise time keeping during behaviorally relevant hippocampal synchronous oscillations. Although they express relatively few receptors for neuromodulators, the highly abundant and functionally important neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) is able to selectively depolarize PV+ basket cells, making these cells sensitive biosensors for CCK. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the CCK-induced selective and powerful excitation of PV+ basket cells are not understood. We used single and paired patch-clamp recordings in acute rat hippocampal slices, in combination with post hoc identification of the recorded interneurons, to demonstrate that CCK acts via G-protein-coupled CCK2 receptors to engage sharply divergent intracellular pathways to exert its cell-type-selective effects. In contrast to CCK2 receptors on pyramidal cells that signal through the canonical G(q)-PLC pathway to trigger endocannabinoid-mediated signaling events, CCK2 receptors on neighboring PV+ basket cells couple to an unusual, pertussis-toxin-sensitive pathway. The latter pathway involves ryanodine receptors on intracellular calcium stores that ultimately activate a nonselective cationic conductance to depolarize PV+ basket cells. CCK has highly cell-type-selective effects even within the PV+ cell population, as the PV+ dendrite-targeting bistratified cells do not respond to CCK. Together, these results demonstrate that an abundant ligand such as CCK can signal through the same receptor in different neurons to use cell-type-selective signaling pathways to provide divergence and specificity to its effects.",

In the present study the anxiolytic profile of mGlu2/3 receptor agonists LY-354740 and LY-404039 and the mGlu2 receptor PAM 1-methyl-2-((cis-3-methyl-4-(4-trifluoromethyl-2-methoxy)-phenyl)piperidin-1-yl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (MTFIP) were evaluated using neurophysiology-based assays. Activation of mGlu2/3 receptors by these compounds, as well as the positive control diazepam, significantly decreased the frequency of hippocampal theta oscillation elicited by stimulation of the brainstem nucleus pontis oralis (nPO), a characteristic action of anxiolytic compounds. Since the nPO is a critical region involved in regulation of rapid eye movement sleep, mGlu2/3 receptor activators were also tested on sleep parameters, as well as on cortical and hippocampal encephalography (EEG) activity. Both mGlu2/3 agonists and the mGlu2 PAM significantly prolonged REM sleep latency and reduced total REM sleep duration while during the active awake state all compounds lowered hippocampal peak theta frequency. However, diazepam and mGlu2/3 agonists/PAM elicited opposite changes in cortical EEG delta and beta bands. Delta power significantly increased after any of the mGlu2/3 compounds but decreased after diazepam. In the beta band, mGlu2/3 receptor agonists dose-dependently decreased beta power in contrast to the well-known beta activation by diazepam. These effects lasted 3-4h and could not be explained by modest, transient changes (<1h) in waking and slow wave sleep. The current observations support the role of mGlu2/3 receptor activators as potential anxiolytic compounds, but indicate a distinct action on cortical EEG activity which is different from the effects of GABA(A) PAMs. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Anxiety and Depression'.",

In the usual configuration of this test the animal is forced to explore the open arena and its behavior includes both anxiety and non-anxiety responses. However, the open arena is generally small and allows only limited expression of exploratory behavior. The recently developed dimensionality emergence assay in which an animal is housed in a home cage with free access to a large circular arena elicits graded exploration and promises to serve as a more ethological test of anxiety. Here we examined the predictive validity of this assay for anxiety-related measures in mice. First, we compared their behavior in the presence or absence of access to the home cage and found that mice with access to the home cage exhibited a gradual build-up in exploration of the arena while those without did not. Then we identified behavioral measures that responded to treatment with the anxiolytic drug diazepam. Diazepam altered several classical measures of innate anxiety, such as distance traveled and thigmotaxis, but also led to a dose-dependent acceleration of the build-up as reflected in a significantly reduced latency to attain several exploratory landmarks. Finally, we tested the utility of the dimensionality emergence assay in assessing alterations in innate anxiety reported in mice carrying a knockout allele for the serotonin 1A receptor (Htr1a). Our findings support the validity of the dimensionality emergence assay as a method to extract an expanded repertoire of behavioral measures for the assessment of anxiety in laboratory mice.",

Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the primary motor cortex leg area was applied to elicit motor evoked potentials in the anterior tibial muscle (TA). Coupling between populations of TA motor units was calculated in the frequency (coherence) domain during isometric dorsiflexion. Subjects receiving placebo showed statistically significant improvement in motor performance (q\u00a0=\u00a034.1, P\u00a0=\u00a00.014) accompanied by a statistically significant reduction in intramuscular coherence. Subjects receiving baclofen and diazepam conversely showed no progression in motor performance (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05), and the training was not accompanied by a decrease in intramuscular coherence. TA motor evoked potentials had significantly lower threshold following the training in the placebo group, whereas this was not the case in the treatment groups. These data indicate that diazepam and baclofen interfere with the acquisition of a motor skill by disrupting some of the neuroplastic changes that are involved in improved motor performance. This suggests that antispastic treatment should be used with caution in subjects receiving concomitant physiotherapy.", 
    "210": "Treatment or prophylaxis of invasive fungal infection in recipients of haemopoietic SCT (HSCT) may require management of coexistent malnutrition, organ dysfunction and GVHD, all of which create added potential for inter- and intra-patient variations in drug metabolism as well as drug interactions. Polymorphism is common in genes encoding pathway components of antifungal drug metabolism such as enzymes (cytochrome P450 (CYP450), glutathione S-transferase, N-acetyltransferase and uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase), uptake transporters (organic cationic transporter, novel organic cationic transporter, organic anion transporter protein (OATP), organic anion transport (OAT), and peptide tranporter) and efflux transporters (breast cancer resistance protein, bile sale export pump (BSEP), multidrug and toxin extrusion type transporter, multidrug resistance protein (MRP), OAT, permeability glycoprotein (P-gp), and urate transporter). Specific polymorphisms may be generalised throughout a population or largely confined to ethnic groups. CYP450 enzymes, especially 2C9 and 2C19, exhibit extensive polymorphism and are central to the metabolism of azole antifungals and their interactions with other drugs including calcineurin inhibitors, cytotoxics and benzodiazepines. Polymorphism may ultimately affect drug efficacy: CYP2C19 variation leads to a fivefold variation in voriconazole levels between individuals. Anticipated routine provision of pharmacogenomic data in the future for new drugs, together with accumulating knowledge about established agents, challenge physicians to assimilate and apply that information to drug prescribing. Increasing availability of pharmacogenomic data may strengthen demand for rapid turn-around therapeutic drug monitoring of antifungal agents in HSCT recipients.", 
    "211": "Benzodiazepine (BZD) overdose (OD) continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality in the UK. Flumazenil is an effective antidote but there is a risk of seizures, particularly in those who have co-ingested tricyclic antidepressants. A study was undertaken to examine the frequency of use, safety and efficacy of flumazenil in the management of BZD OD in the UK.", 
    "212": "A 2-year retrospective cohort study was performed of all enquiries to the UK National Poisons Information Service involving BZD OD.", 
    "213": "Flumazenil was administered to 80 patients in 4504 BZD-related enquiries, 68 of whom did not have ventilatory failure or had recognised contraindications to flumazenil. Factors associated with flumazenil use were increased age, severe poisoning and ventilatory failure. Co-ingestion of tricyclic antidepressants and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease did not influence flumazenil administration. Seizure frequency in patients not treated with flumazenil was 0.3%. The frequency of prior seizure in flumazenil-treated patients was 30 times higher (8.8%). Seven patients who had seizures prior to flumazenil therapy had no recurrence of their seizures. Ventilation or consciousness improved in 70% of flumazenil-treated patients. Flumazenil administration was followed by one instance each of agitation and brief seizure.", 
    "214": "Flumazenil is used infrequently in the management of BZD OD in the UK. It was effective and associated with a low incidence of seizure. These results compare favourably with the results of published randomised controlled trials and cohort studies, although previous studies have not reported the use of flumazenil in such a high-risk population. This study should inform the continuing review of national guidance on flumazenil therapy.", 
    "215": "To study the safety of deep sedation in an urban-based oral maxillofacial surgery training program.", 
    "216": "Charts of patients undergoing an intravenous sedation from January 2005 through December 2009 were reviewed. Data recorded included age, gender, type of procedures performed, and intravenous medications. Patients were divided in 2 groups depending on whether they received a general anesthetic agent (propofol or ketamine) or not. Anesthesia complications and failures were recorded and categorized.", 
    "217": "In total, 1,167 intravenous sedations were recorded. Eight patients developed adverse reactions, 3 of which required further evaluation in the emergency department. In addition, 7 intravenous sedations needed to be aborted because of patient agitation and combativeness. No deaths or long-term morbidities were reported.", 
    "218": "The safety of deep sedation in an urban-based oral maxillofacial training program is similar to office-based anesthesia. Sedations failures may be attributed to paradoxical benzodiazepine reactions.", 
    "219": "A single administration of benzodiazepine-site ligands of the inhibitory GABA(A) receptors has been shown to lead to persistently potentiated AMPA receptor-mediated responses in dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). This plasticity has been suggested to be a common property of different kinds of addictive drugs. We now wanted to test if the plasticity induced by diazepam would also affect behaviors elicited by other drugs of abuse. Activity and plasticity of the VTA dopaminergic neurons are known to be essential for the initiation and/or sensitization of the psychomotor responses to morphine and amphetamine. The effect of diazepam pre-treatment (a single dose of 5 mg/kg) was studied 24-72 h later in behaving C57BL/6J mice on locomotor activity induced by acute and repeated administration of morphine (5 mg/kg) and amphetamine (2.5 mg/kg). The pre-treatment attenuated the locomotor-activating effect of morphine. On the other hand, it reduced the amphetamine-induced locomotor sensitization in male mice in N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent manner. The acute amphetamine effect was not affected. The results indicate that benzodiazepine-induced neural plasticity transiently reduces the sensitivity to psychomotor stimulation by opioids and stimulants.", 
    "220": "Clozapine and olanzapine are antipsychotic drugs commonly used to treat schizophrenia and psychosis; however, few studies have investigated their effects on cognitive function using animal models. Thus, the effects of olanzapine and clozapine on memory acquisition, consolidation and retrieval were investigated in naive mice using a modified elevated plus maze (mEPM) task. Olanzapine (0.15 and 0.30 mg/kg) and clozapine (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) into male Balb-c mice before training, immediately after training or before the second day of the trial. Our results showed that both olanzapine and clozapine disrupted the acquisition of spatial memory. In addition, clozapine impaired the consolidation of spatial memory, while olanzapine had no effect. Furthermore, olanzapine and clozapine significantly disrupted memory retrieval in naive mice. Thus, these results at least suggest that olanzapine can be a superior treatment for schizophrenia compared to clozapine.", 
    "221": "Long-term kindling of limbic system structures may produce substantial changes in emotional behavior in rats. This study examined long-term changes in two kindled structures that have opposite effects on anxiety, the lateral septum and the central nucleus of the amygdala. The purpose of the experiment was to examine the specificity of the emotional effects of kindling by employing a double dissociation design. Animals were tested in two common animal models of anxiety, the water-lick conflict test and the elevated plus-maze. In the conflict test amygdala-kindled animals demonstrated a significant anxiolytic effect when compared with sham-kindled animals. This effect was potentiated by chlordiazepoxide. Septally-kindled animals exhibited a significant anticonflict effect when compared to sham-kindled animals in the first session. Septally-kindled animals spent significantly more time on the open arms of the elevated plus-maze than did sham-kindled animals. Observed changes persisted 6weeks after the termination of 150 kindling sessions. The effects of long-term kindling were highly consistent with those of disruption rather than facilitation.", 
    "222": "We present the case of a 24-year-old-female patient, who made an attempt to autolysis with valproic acid, benzodiazepines and neuroleptic. The valproic acid plasma level was very high (1437 \u03bcg/mL), confirming it was a severe intoxication. She presents an acute encephalopathy with prolonged status epilepticus, a lactic metabolic acidosis and hematologic disorders such as bicytopenia. Treatment including L-carnintine and continuous veno-venous haemodialysis (CVVHD) was rapidly introduced to prevent the occurrence of cerebral oedema. The evolution was favourable despite the occurrence of a nosocomial ventilation acute lung injury. The patient had motor sequelae of cranial nerves following status epilepticus extended, which disappeared spontaneously after several days.", 
    "223": "To explore the effect of oxytocin on uterine fibroids treated by ultrasound ablation.", 
    "224": "Eighty-two single points in 29 uterine fibroids from 26 patients were sonicated with magnetic resonance imaging guided by high intensity focused ultrasound before and after using oxytocin. The required total energy, sonication time required to reach 60\u00b0C and the acoustic energy for increasing 1\u00b0C of temperature at the single point before and after using oxytocin were compared.", 
    "225": "Before intravenous infusion of oxytocin, the average total sonication energy required to reach 60\u00b0C was (5320 \u00b1 910) J and it took (21 \u00b1 20) seconds for sonicating a single point, the energy required for increasing 1\u00b0C was (255 \u00b1 302) J. In contrast, after intravenous infusion of oxytocin, the average total sonication energy required to reach 60\u00b0C was (2890 \u00b1 325) J, and it took (12 \u00b1 7) seconds for sonicating a single point, the energy required for increasing 1\u00b0C was (126 \u00b1 94) J. Those three index all reached statistical difference (P = 0.002, P = 0.001, P = 0.002, respectively).", 
    "226": "It seemed that Oxytocin could significantly decrease the energy required for ablating uterine fibroids, shorten treatment time and improve the treatment efficiency.", 
    "227": "Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug that has been increasingly used in acute treatment of, and therapeutic support for, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other psychoses. Considering that olanzapine acts on the dopaminergic receptor and this receptor is detected in germ cells, the present study aims to investigate the effects of treatment with different doses of olanzapine on spermatogenesis, plasma testosterone and weight of androgen-dependent organs in rats. Results showed reduced plasma testosterone levels, and reduced testis, epididymis and prostate weights. Histopathologic and histomorphometric analysis of spermatogenesis indicated testicular degeneration. Furthermore, germ cell desquamation, syncytial multinucleated cells, Sertoli cell vacuolization and presence of necrotic and apoptotic germ cells wwew observed. Olanzapine treatment in rats promoted endocrinological changes and lesions in the testis, leading to a disturbance in spermatogenesis.", 
    "228": "Alcohol (ethanol) is widely consumed for its desirable effects but unfortunately has strong addiction potential. Some imidazobenzodiazepines such as Ro15-4513 are able to antagonize many ethanol-induced behaviors. Controversial biochemical and pharmacological evidence suggest that the effects of these ethanol antagonists and ethanol are mediated specifically via overlapping binding sites on \u03b14/\u03b4-containing GABA(A)-Rs. To investigate the requirement of \u03b14-containing GABA(A)-Rs in the mechanism of action of Ro15-4513 on behavior, wildtype (WT) and \u03b14 knockout (KO) mice were compared for antagonism of ethanol-induced motor incoordination and hypnosis. Motor effects of ethanol were tested in two different fixed speed rotarod assays. In the first experiment, mice were injected with 2.0\u2009g/kg ethanol followed 5\u2009min later by 10\u2009mg/kg Ro15-4513 (or vehicle) and tested on a rotarod at 8\u2009rpm. In the second experiment, mice received a single injection of 1.5\u2009g/kg ethanol\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u2009mg/kg Ro15-4513 and were tested on a rotarod at 12\u2009rpm. In both experiments, the robust Ro15-4513 antagonism of ethanol-induced motor ataxia that was observed in WT mice was absent in KO mice. A loss of righting reflex (LORR) assay was used to test Ro15-4513 (20\u2009mg/kg) antagonism of ethanol (3.5\u2009g/kg)-induced hypnosis. An effect of sex was observed on the LORR assay, so males and females were analyzed separately. In male mice, Ro15-4513 markedly reduced ethanol-induced LORR in WT controls, but \u03b14 KO mice were insensitive to this effect of Ro15-4513. In contrast, female KO mice did not differ from WT controls in the antagonistic effects of Ro15-4513 on ethanol-induced LORR. We conclude that Ro15-4513 requires \u03b14-containing receptors for antagonism of ethanol-induced LORR (in males) and motor ataxia."
