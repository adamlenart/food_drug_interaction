The duration of the disorder was significantly shorter in the uremic RLS group than in the iRLS group. The PSQI and IRLS scores before treatment were higher in the uremic RLS group than in the iRLS group. The periodic leg movement index (PLM index) on PSG and the SIT index were also higher in the uremic RLS group (P < 0.001, respectively). The bromocriptine equivalent dose of dopaminergic agonists used to treat RLS was significantly higher in the uremic RLS group (P < 0.001). Uremic RLS appears to deteriorate faster and to become more severe than iRLS. Moreover, uremic RLS patients appear to have a decreased response to dopaminergic agonists.",

    "21": "Functional muscarinic acetylcholine receptors present in the mouse uterus were characterized by pharmacological and molecular biological studies using control (DDY and wild-type) mice, muscarinic M2 or M3 single receptor knockout (M2KO, M3KO), and M2 and M3 receptor double knockout mice (M2/M3KO). Carbachol (10 nM-100 microM) increased muscle tonus and phasic contractile activity of uterine strips of control mice in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximum carbachol-induced contractions (Emax) differed between cervical and ovarian regions of the uterus. The stage of the estrous cycle had no significant effect on carbachol concentration-response relationships. Tetrodotoxin did not decrease carbachol-induced contractions, but the muscarinic receptor antagonists (11-[[2-[(diethylaminomethyl)-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepin6-one (AF-DX116), N-[2-[2-[(dipropylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]ethyl]-5,6-dihydro-6-oxo-11H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4] benzodiazepine-11-carboxamide (AF-DX384), 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine(4-DAMP), para-fluoro-hexa hydro-sila-diphenidol (p-F-HHSiD), himbacine, methoctramine, pirenzepine, and tropicamide) inhibited carbachol-induced contractions in a competitive fashion. The pKb values for these muscarinic receptor antagonists correlated well with the known pKi values of these antagonists for the M3 muscarinic receptor. In uterine strips isolated from mice treated with pertussis toxin (100 microg/kg, i.p. for 96 h), Emax values for carbachol were significantly decreased, but effective concentration that caused 50% of Emax values (EC50) remained unchanged. In uterine strips treated with 4-DAMP mustard (30 nM) and AF-DX116 (1 microM), followed by subsequent washout of AF-DX116, neither carbachol nor N,N,N,-trimethyl-4-(2-oxo-1-pyrolidinyl)-2-butyn-1-ammonium iodide (oxotremorine-M) caused any contractile responses. Both M2 and M3 muscarinic receptor messenger RNAs were detected in the mouse uterus via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Carbachol also caused contraction of uterine strips isolated from M2KO mice, but the concentration-response curve was shifted to the right and downward compared with that for the corresponding wild-type mice. On the other hand, uterine strips isolated from M3KO and M2/M3 double KO mice were virtually insensitive to carbachol. In conclusion, although both M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors were expressed in the mouse uterus, carbachol-induced contractile responses were predominantly mediated by the M3 receptor. Activation of M2 receptors alone did not cause uterine contractions; however, M2 receptor activation enhanced M3 receptor-mediated contractions in the mouse uterus.",

Presented here is a case report of a 19-year-old woman appearing in a catatonic state that did not respond to lorazepam. On the basis of emerging evidence that atypical antipsychotics and weak N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor-antagonists may effectively treat catatonia, we treated our patient with olanzapine and amantadine, which resulted in a dramatic reduction in her catatonic symptoms.",

Global alpha 4 subunit knockout (KO) mice exhibit greatly reduced tonic currents and insensitivity to ataxic, sedative and analgesic effects of gaboxadol compared to wild type (WT) controls. The alpha 4 KO mice were also significantly more sensitive to pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. However, no differences were observed between alpha 4 KO and WT mice in other baseline behaviors or in the effects of EtOH on these behaviors. To examine possible functional and pharmacological GABA(A)R alterations, and search for causes for the lack of differences in EtOH behaviors we studied the effects of acute EtOH application on GABA(A)R-currents of DG cells from alpha 4 KO and WT control mice complemented by Western blot measurements.",

Potentiation of mIPSCs by alphaxalone was greatly reduced in alpha 4 KO mice. Ro15-4513 had no effect on mIPSCs from WT or KO mice.

The gamma 2 subunit protein levels were selectively increased in hippocampus and thalamus, but not cortex of alpha 4 KO mice.",

    "41": "According to the National Institutes of Health, approximately 30 percent of all Americans complain of sleep disruption, while 10 percent display symptoms congruent with chronic insomnia. One of the most common treatments for insomnia is prescription sleep medications that help people fall asleep and remain asleep. Historically barbiturates were initially popular for treating insomnia, but their long \"hangover\" effect made them easily replaced with the introduction of the benzodiazepines. Triazolam (Halcion), diazepam (Valium), and oxazepam (Serax) rapidly became the treatment of choice for insomnia. Recently a new class of nonbenzodiazepines---the \"z-sedatives\"--has overtaken the older benzodiazepines as the most commonly prescribed sleep medications. The three most popular z-drugs are zolpidem (Ambien), zaleplon (Sonata), and eszopiclone (Lunesta). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also recently approved the production of zolpidem tartrate, a generic form of Ambien. Many dentists prescribe these medications for patients who have difficulty sleeping the night prior to an appointment or as a procedural sedative. With 43 million prescriptions for sleep medications filled in 2005, generating $2.7 billion for pharmaceutical companies, it is important that dentists be aware of these drugs' mechanism of action and potential drug interactions.", 
    "42": "Several studies have indicated a functional differentiation across the septotemporal axis of rat hippocampus. Our previous results have shown that the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2-GABAA receptor subtype dominates in dorsal hippocampus (DH), while the alpha 2 beta 1 gamma 2-subtype prevails in ventral hippocampus (VH). We therefore studied possible differences in the pharmacological properties and receptor binding parameters of the GABAA receptor subtypes between DH and VH, by examining: (1)(a) the specific binding of [3H]-flunitrazepam (Benzodiazepine sites agonist) by using quantitative autoradiography, (b) the kinetic parameters of [3H]-flunitrazepam specific binding, by using the \"wipe off\" technique and (2) the competitive displacement of [3H]-flunitrazepam binding by using zolpidem (selective agonist of the alpha 1-subtype) and L-655,708 (selective inverse agonist of the alpha 5-subtype) and the enhancement of [3H]-flunitrazepam binding by using etomidate (selective positive modulator of the beta 2-subunit), in an autoradiographical saturation kinetic study. Our results showed in VH compared to DH: (A) lower level of [3H]-flunitrazepam binding, apparently due to weaker binding affinity (higher KD value), since no differences in the Bmax value could be detected, (B) higher IC50 values for zolpidem and lower IC50 values for L-655,708 and (C) higher EC50 values for etomidate. In conclusion, the lower binding for zolpidem and etomidate and the higher binding for L-655,708 observed in VH support the evidence that the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2-GABAA receptor subtype dominates in DH and the alpha 5-subtype prevails in VH. Further, our results suggest differential pharmacological effects of the benzodiazepines in DH compared to VH, with the sedative effects being more potent in the dorsal hippocampus.", 
    "43": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor and protein kinase A have been proposed to modulate placental steroidogenesis. Binding of the radioactive benzodiazepine PK 11195 has been observed in membranes isolated from whole human placenta, but the presence of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, now called translocator protein, does not seem to be indispensable. We hypothesized that cAMP analogs could induce the translocator protein expression in BeWo cells increasing steroidogenesis in the presence of benzodiazepines. The effect of two benzodiazepines and of 8-Br-cAMP on steroidogenesis in BeWo cells or in isolated human placental mitochondria was studied. Benzodiazepines did not modify progesterone synthesis in either system. Progesterone increased three times in BeWo cells incubated in the presence of 8-Br-cAMP. The translocator protein was not identified by western blot in mitochondria isolated from either the human placenta or BeWo cells but it was present in isolated rat testicular mitochondria. Neither was it observed in isolated mitochondria from BeWo cells incubated with 8-Br-cAMP. An inhibitor of protein kinase A activity, H89, at 25 microM inhibited 90% the steroidogenesis in BeWo cells, even in the presence of 8-Br-cAMP, but protein phosphorylation in mitochondria increased in the presence of H89, suggesting that protein kinase A modulates the phosphorylation cycle of mitochondrial proteins. The results suggest that placental steroidogenesis is regulated via activation of protein kinase A modulated by cAMP.", 
    "44": "Deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) activity is an inborn error of purine metabolism associated with uric acid overproduction and a continuum spectrum of neurological manifestations depending on the degree of the enzymatic deficiency. The prevalence is estimated at 1/380,000 live births in Canada, and 1/235,000 live births in Spain. Uric acid overproduction is present inall HPRT-deficient patients and is associated with lithiasis and gout. Neurological manifestations include severe action dystonia, choreoathetosis, ballismus, cognitive and attention deficit, and self-injurious behaviour. The most severe forms are known as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (patients are normal at birth and diagnosis can be accomplished when psychomotor delay becomes apparent). Partial HPRT-deficient patients present these symptoms with a different intensity, and in the least severe forms symptoms may be unapparent. Megaloblastic anaemia is also associated with the disease. Inheritance of HPRT deficiency is X-linked recessive, thus males are generally affected and heterozygous female are carriers (usually asymptomatic). Human HPRT is encoded by a single structural gene on the long arm of the X chromosome at Xq26. To date, more than 300 disease-associated mutations in the HPRT1 gene have been identified. The diagnosis is based on clinical and biochemical findings (hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria associated with psychomotor delay), and enzymatic (HPRT activity determination in haemolysate, intact erythrocytes or fibroblasts) and molecular tests. Molecular diagnosis allows faster and more accurate carrier and prenatal diagnosis. Prenatal diagnosis can be performed with amniotic cells obtained by amniocentesis at about 15-18 weeks' gestation, or chorionic villus cells obtained at about 10-12 weeks' gestation. Uric acid overproduction can be managed by allopurinol treatment. Doses must be carefully adjusted to avoid xanthine lithiasis. The lack of precise understanding of the neurological dysfunction has precluded development of useful therapies. Spasticity, when present, and dystonia can be managed with benzodiazepines and gamma-aminobutyric acid inhibitors such as baclofen. Physical rehabilitation, including management of dysarthria and dysphagia, special devices to enable hand control, appropriate walking aids, and a programme of posture management to prevent deformities are recommended. Self-injurious behaviour must be managed by a combination of physical restraints, behavioural and pharmaceutical treatments.",

The O-desmethyl analogue of 10 was converted into [ (11)C] 10 with [ (11)C]iodomethane. [ (11)C] 3 and [ (11)C] 10 were each injected into monkey to assess their brain kinetics with positron emission tomography (PET). After administration of either radioligand there was moderately high brain uptake of radioactivity. Receptor blocking and displacement experiments showed that a high proportion of this radioactivity was bound specifically to PBR. In monkey and rat, 3 and 10 were rapidly metabolized by ester hydrolysis and N-debenzylation, respectively, each to a single polar radiometabolite. [ (11)C] 3 and [ (11)C] 10 are effective for imaging PBR in monkey brain. [ (11)C] 10 especially warrants further evaluation in human subjects.",

A combination of a narcotic and benzodiazepine was used, with the target being moderate sedation and analgesia. Deep sedation was defined by MOAA/S score of 1-2 and BIS score of <or=75. With MOAA/S as the reference standard, the accuracy of BIS for detecting deep sedation was evaluated.",

Deep sedation, defined by MOAA/S and BIS, was seen in 204 (26%) and 92 (12%) observations, respectively. BIS correlated poorly with deep sedation (rho, -0.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.16-0.12). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (95% CI) for detecting deep sedation were 29.6 (23.4-36.3), 94.9 (92.8-96.6), 68.2 (57.4-77.7), and 78.6 (75.3-81.7), respectively.",

    "85": "Recently, we reported that an alarm pheromone released from the perianal region of male rats aggravated stress-induced hyperthermia and increased defensive and risk assessment behaviors in recipient male rats. Based on these results, we hypothesized that the primary effect of the alarm pheromone is to increase anxiety; however, there is still no clear evidence for this pheromone effect. Therefore, we examined this issue by assessing the effect of the alarm pheromone on the acoustic startle reflex (ASR), which is a useful index for studying negative emotions such as anxiety in rats. The alarm pheromone enhanced the ASR for 105-dB auditory stimuli, but not for those of 90 and 120 dB, when these three intensities of sound were used randomly. The same results were obtained when one of these three intensities was used repeatedly. In addition, pretreatment with diazepam (i.p.) at doses of 0.7 and 2.0 mg/kg suppressed the ASR of the pheromone recipients, whereas the lower dose (0.2 mg/kg) slightly attenuated the pheromone effect and the control injection (vehicle) had no effect. These results indicate that the alarm pheromone enhances the ASR by increasing anxiety in recipient rats, suggesting that the primary effect of the alarm pheromone is to increase the anxiety level.",

The impact of inflammation on drug disposition was studied in mice bearing a number of common tumour xenografts. C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with tumour xenografts. Hepatic expressions of Cyp3a and drug transporters were analysed at the mRNA, protein and functional levels (Cyp3a only). Circulating serum cytokines and the hepatic expression of acute phase proteins (APPs) were measured. Intratumoral levels of multidrug resistance genes were determined. Tumour xenografts elicited an inflammatory response that coincided with repression in hepatic Cyp3a11 activity and the expression of a number of hepatic drug transporters. With tumour growth, a progressive reduction in hepatic Cyp3a11 mRNA expression was seen. Conversely, an increase in the hepatic APP expression and circulating interleukin (IL)-6 levels was observed. Furthermore, a correlation was seen between increased intratumoral expression of the multidrug resistance gene, Mdr1a, and levels of circulating IL-6. Malignancy results in reduced hepatic drug disposition that correlates with an associated inflammatory response. Reduction of inflammation may improve the clinical outcome for patients receiving chemotherapeutic agents that undergo hepatic metabolism.",

However, the mechanism of anticancer action of AMPA antagonists is not known. Here we report that the AMPA antagonists GYKI 52466 and CFM-2 inhibit the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2) pathway, an intracellular signaling cascade which is activated by growth factors and controls proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma cells. AMPA antagonists reduced phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), suppressed expression of cyclin D1, upregulated the cell cycle regulators and tumor suppressor proteins p21 and p53 and decreased number of lung adenocarcinoma cells in G2 and S phases of the cell cycle. These findings reveal potential mechanism of antiproliferative action of AMPA antagonists and indicate that this class of compounds may be useful in the therapy of human cancers.",

    "111": "A review of US poison center data for 2004 showed over 8,000 ingestions of methylphenidate. A guideline that determines the conditions for emergency department referral and prehospital care could potentially optimize patient outcome, avoid unnecessary emergency department visits, reduce health care costs, and reduce life disruption for patients and caregivers. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create the guideline. Relevant articles were abstracted by a trained physician researcher. The first draft of the guideline was created by the lead author. The entire panel discussed and refined the guideline before distribution to secondary reviewers for comment. The panel then made changes based on the secondary review comments. The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate out-of-hospital triage and initial out-of-hospital management of patients with suspected ingestions of methylphenidate by 1) describing the process by which a specialist in poison information should evaluate an exposure to methylphenidate, 2) identifying the key decision elements in managing cases of methylphenidate ingestion, 3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and 4) identifying needs for research. This review focuses on the ingestion of more than a single therapeutic dose of methylphenidate and the effects of an overdose and is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions may be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. Recommendations are in chronological order of likely clinical use. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. 1) All patients with suicidal intent, intentional abuse, or in cases in which a malicious intent is suspected (e.g., child abuse or neglect) should be referred to an emergency department (Grade D). 2) In patients without evidence of self-harm, abuse, or malicious intent, poison center personnel should elicit additional information including the time of the ingestion, the precise dose ingested, and the presence of coingestants (Grade D). 3) Patients who are chronically taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and who have ingested any amount of methylphenidate require referral to an emergency department (Grade D). 4) Patients experiencing any changes in behavior other than mild stimulation or agitation should be referred to an emergency department. Examples of moderate to severe symptoms that warrant referral include moderate-to-severe agitation, hallucinations, abnormal muscle movements, headache, chest pain, loss of consciousness, or convulsions (Grade D). 5) For patients referred to an emergency department, transportation via ambulance should be considered based on several factors including the condition of the patient and the length of time it will take for the patient to arrive at the emergency department (Grade D). 6) If the patient has no symptoms, and more than 3 hours have elapsed between the time of ingestion and the call to the poison center, referral to an emergency department is not recommended (Grade D). 7) Patients with acute or acute-on-chronic ingestions of less than a toxic dose (see recommendations 8, 9, and 10) or chronic exposures to methylphenidate with no or mild symptoms can be observed at home with instructions to call the poison center back if symptoms develop or worsen. For acute-on-chronic ingestions, the caller should be instructed not to administer methylphenidate to the patient for the next 24 hours. The poison center should consider making a follow-up call at approximately 3 hours after ingestion (Grade D). 8) Patients who ingest more than 2 mg/kg or 60 mg, whichever is less, of an immediate-release formulation (or the equivalent amount of a modified-release formulation that has been chewed) should be referred to an emergency department (Grade C). 9) If a patch has been swallowed, consider the entire contents of the patch (not just the labeled dose of the patch) to have been ingested. Patients who ingest more than 2 mg/kg or 60 mg, whichever is less should be referred to an emergency department. If it is known that the patch has been chewed only briefly, and the patch remains intact, significant toxicity is unlikely and emergency department referral is not necessary (Grade D). 10) Patients who ingest more than 4 mg/kg or 120 mg, whichever is less, of an intact modified-release formulation should be referred to an emergency department (Grade D). 11) For oral exposures, do not induce emesis (Grade D). 12) Pre-hospital activated charcoal administration, if available, should only be carried out by health professionals and only if no contraindications are present. Do not delay transportation in order to administer activate charcoal (Grade D). 13) Benzodiazepines can be administered by EMS personnel if agitation, dystonia, or convulsions are present and if authorized by EMS medical direction expressed by written treatment protocol or policy or direct medical oversight (Grade C). 14) Standard advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) measures should be administered by EMS personnel if respiratory arrest, cardiac dysrhythmias, or cardiac arrest are present and if authorized by EMS medical direction expressed by written treatment protocol or policy or direct medical oversight (Grade C).",

For all kinds of sleep-inducing drugs, the drug efficacy of most generic drugs is not necessarily equal to that of the original drug. The main reason for the difference appears to be due to differences in the rate of absorption of the main drug. Any other differences between an original drug and a generic drug are caused by drug additives, the crystal form of the main drug, the formulation, and so on. In this study, the formulation was not the reason for the differences because all of the drugs were pulverized in a mortar and had no special coating. The drug additives for all the drugs are listed and the drug efficacy compared. Unfortunately, the information was not sufficient to shed any light on the differences in drug efficacy.

In the present study, we demonstrate that Bz-423 (formulated for topical delivery) reduces epidermal hyperplasia in human psoriatic skin after transplantation to severe, combined immunodeficient (scid) mice. Bz-423 also suppresses the hyperplasia that develops in nonpsoriatic human skin as a consequence of transplantation to scid mice. Proliferation of human epidermal keratinocytes in monolayer culture was suppressed by Bz-423 at concentrations of 0.5 to 2.0 muM (noncytotoxic concentrations). Keratinocyte growth inhibition was accompanied by increased oxidant generation in Bz-423-treated cells, and treatment with vitamin E along with Bz-423 reversed the growth inhibition. Growth inhibition was accompanied by a redistribution of beta-catenin from a cytoplasmic pool to the cell membrane and by reduced levels of c-myc and cyclin D1 (two molecules associated with Wnt pathway signaling). Several analogs of Bz-423 were examined for antiproliferative activity against human epidermal keratinocytes and human dermal fibroblasts in monolayer culture. Each of the analogs tested suppressed growth of both cell types, but in all cases, keratinocytes were more sensitive than fibroblasts. Two of the compounds were found to suppress epidermal hyperplasia induced with all-trans retinoic acid in organ cultures of human skin. Taken together, these data show that Bz-423 and certain analogs produce biological responses in skin cells in vitro and in vivo that are consistent with therapeutic goals for treating psoriasis or epidermal hyperplasia resulting from other causes.", 
    "127": "A 24-h pretreatment with BNDF enhanced excitotoxic neuronal death in cultured mouse cortical cells challenged with NMDA in the presence of extracellular Mg(2+). The GABA(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline, enhanced NMDA toxicity in control cultures but, unexpectedly, became neuroprotective in cultures pretreated with BDNF. In contrast, drugs that activate GABA(A) receptors (e.g. muscimol, benzodiazepines, or phenobarbital) or drugs that indirectly enhance GABAergic transmission were protective in control cultures but amplified NMDA toxicity after pretreatment with BDNF. The atypical behaviour of GABAergic drugs in cultures pretreated with BDNF depended on changes in the anion reversal potential because (i) increases in extracellular Cl(-) concentrations abolished the neurotoxic action of muscimol; (ii) muscimol stimulated (36)Cl(-) efflux after pretreatment with BDNF; and (iii) exposure to BDNF reduced the expression of the neuronal K(+)/Cl(-) co-transporter, KCC2. Our data raise the concern that GABAergic drugs may become neurotoxic under conditions associated with increases in brain BDNF levels.",

In contrast, haloperidol (0.01-10 muM) did not affect cell viability but exacerbated cell death at 10 muM under serum-free conditions (p<0.01). Western blot analysis showed that olanzapine, but not haloperidol, prevented the serum withdrawal-induced decrease in levels of neuroprotective proteins such as p-GSK-3beta, beta-catenin, and Bcl-2 (p<0.01), whereas haloperidol robustly reduced the levels of these proteins at a 10 muM dose in serum-starved cells (p<0.05). Moreover, olanzapine alone significantly increased phosphorylation of GSK-3beta under normal conditions (p<0.05).",

    "132": "Over the past 20 years it has become apparent that certain steroids, synthesised de novo in the brain, hence named neurosteroids, produce immediate changes (within seconds) in neuronal excitability, a time scale that precludes a genomic locus of action. Identified molecular targets underlying modulation of brain excitability include both the inhibitory GABA(A) and the excitatory NMDA receptor. Of particular interest is the interaction of certain neurosteroids with the GABA(A) receptor, the major inhibitory receptor in mammalian brain. During the last decade, compelling evidence has accrued to reveal that locally produced neurosteroids may selectively \"fine tune\" neuronal inhibition. A range of molecular mechanisms including the subunit composition of the receptor(s), phosphorylation and local steroid metabolism, underpin the region- and neuronal selectivity of action of neurosteroids at synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors. The relative contribution played by each of these mechanisms in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological scenarios is currently being scrutinised at a cellular and molecular level. However, it is not known how such mechanisms may act in concert to influence behavioural profiles in health and disease. An important question concerns the identification of the anatomical substrates mediating the repertoire of behaviours produced by neurosteroids. \"Knock-in\" mice expressing mutant GABA(A) subunits engineered to be insensitive to benzodiazepines or general anaesthetics have proved invaluable in evaluating the role of GABA(A) receptor subtypes in complex behaviours such as sedation, cognition and anxiety [Rudolph, U., Mohler, H., 2006. GABA-based therapeutic approaches: GABA(A) receptor subtype functions. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 6, 18-23]. However, the development of a similar approach for neurosteroids has been hampered by the limited knowledge that, until recently, has surrounded the identity of the amino acid residues contributing to the neurosteroid binding pocket. Here, we will review recent progress in identifying the neurosteroid binding site on the GABA(A) receptor, and discuss how these discoveries will impact on our understanding of the role of neurosteroids in health and disease.", 
    "133": "The effects of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide were assessed in a 3D maze which is a modification of an 8-arm radial maze. Each arm of the maze is attached to a bridge radiating from a central platform. Animals exposed for the first time to the maze do not venture beyond the line that separate a bridge from an arm. The prime criteria set for an anxiolytic effect is whether mice would increase the frequency of entries onto arms and increase arm/bridge entries ratio. C57 mice readily cross the line on first exposure and make more than 8 arm visits onto arms on second exposure, while other strains (CD-1 and Balb/c) hold back and rarely cross the line on first exposure and require more sessions to make more than 8 arm entries. An anxiolytic drug is expected to encourage intermediate (CD-1) and high (Balb/c) anxiety mice to adventure onto the arms of the maze and make more visits to the arms to comparable levels seen with low anxiety c57 mice. In the present report, administration of different doses of diazepam (0.625, 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg kg(-1) i.p.) and chlordiazepoxide (5, 10 and 15 mg kg(-1) i.p.) did not reduce anxiety in animals, with the lowest dose of diazepam increasing motor activity in Balb/c and increasing anxiety in c57 mice while the highest doses of both diazepam (2.5 and 5 mg kg(-1) i.p.) and chlordiazepoxide (15 mg kg(-1) i.p.) induced mild sedation.

The same variables were monitored in rats with an intraperitoneal administration of olanzapine (10mg/kg bw), injected 30 min before the orexin administration. The results show that orexin A increases the sympathetic firing rate, IBAT, colonic temperatures and heart rate. This increase is blocked by the injection of olanzapine.

In eukaryotes, the corresponding proteins (PBR, peripheral benzodiazepine receptor; VDAC, voltage-dependant anion channel; and CypD, cyclophilin D) participate in the formation of the mammalian mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), a complex involved in cell apoptosis. Intriguingly, the presence of these proteins has never been reported in the same bacterium and constitutes, up to now, a unique feature of L. pneumophila.

Increased awareness of the negative clinical and economic consequences associated with not treating insomnia may serve to raise the perceived importance of having effective formulary options for this disease area. Because the elderly population is now covered by Medicare Part D, health plans previously without a Medicare drug benefit must now select and reimburse for sedative-hypnotics for the elderly. A review of the major Medicare Part D plans' formularies reveals they offer a limited number of sedative-hypnotic alternatives, but not all are available. Due to variable response, variation in comorbidities, drug and disease interactions, and individual patient needs, managed care organizations should cover a reasonable array of drugs. This is essential to optimally manage patients with chronic insomnia to reduce the long-term clinical morbidity and economic consequences.",

Rather than simply treating the primary disorder, whereby symptoms of insomnia may go unaddressed, now there is a push to acknowledge the existence of chronic insomnia as a disorder that itself merits treatment. This recognition is due to the identification of pathophysiologic changes and associated morbidity, which can be substantial. Insomnia patients have increased risk for psychiatric disorders, especially depression, anxiety, decreased quality of life, increased healthcare utilization and costs, drug/alcohol abuse, decreased occupational performance, and increased falls/accidents. Current management patterns explore non-nightly or discontinuous hypnotic treatment - non-nightly flexible, non-nightly semiflexible, non-nightly fixed, and flexible timing - which deviates from past trends of continuous dosing with hypnotics. These trends reflect a change from considering insomnia a symptom to treating insomnia as a disorder.",

Use of certain agents in the elderly and patients with abuse/addiction potential is a concern. Medicare Part D does not cover benzodiazepines (classified as controlled substances). Nonprescription agents are affordable but have sedation and anticholinergic side effects. Medication use should be considered a possible contributing factor. Insomnia patients experience significantly more limited activity and higher total health services than those without insomnia. Annual costs are between $92.5 billion and $107.5 billion.

    "179": "Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia. Finally, Joseph A. Lieberman III, MD, MPH, provides an overview of therapeutics utilized in patients with insomnia, including behavioral therapies and pharmacologic options.", 
    "180": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in hospitalised patients in correlation with patient's age and number of drugs prescribed and to determine the prevalence of inappropriate drugs prescribed to elderly patients.", 
    "181": "Drugs prescribed during 1 day to all hospitalised patients at seven wards of Department of Medicine in University Hospital Rijeka were recorded by reviewing patient medical charts. Potential DDIs were evaluated using a list of potentially harmful drug combinations compiled from the literature. Beers criteria were used to identify potentially inappropriate medications in patients aged 65 years or older.", 
    "182": "The study included 225 patients that received a total of 1301 drugs. Twenty-two percent of the patients receiving drug therapy were prescribed drug combinations that are potentially harmful. The most common potentially harmful drug combination was an ACE inhibitor with a potassium supplement (33.9% of all combinations). In the multivariate analysis, age and number of drugs are significantly associated with potential DDIs (r = 0.8629). One quarter of elderly patients received a drug potentially inappropriate considering their age. The most commonly prescribed potentially inappropriate drug was amiodarone, followed by diazepam.", 
    "183": "Polypharmacy and older age have been proven to be important risk factors for potential drug interactions. We identified a high rate of prescribing potentially inappropriate medications among elders. Results of this study indicate that particular caution should be given when prescribing drugs to patients already receiving drugs and to elderly patients, considering the risk of drug-related problems.", 
    "184": "No consensus exists for the safest and most effective agent and for optimal drug doses for sedation during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). We aimed to compare the efficacy of midazolam with that of midazolam+meperidine, which provided comfort for the patient during ERCP.", 
    "185": "The patients were randomized to sedation with midazolam only (2.87+/-0.67 mg) (n=48, median age 55.54+/-14.66, 21 women, 27 men) or midazolam (1.82+/-0.71 mg) with meperidine (42.81+/-14.61 mg) (n= 48, median age 55.48+/-2.57, 20 women, 28 men). Procedure-related parameters and the efficacy of sedation as assessed by the endoscopist and the patients were compared.", 
    "186": "Prior endoscopic history, preprocedure anxiety scores, age, sex, baseline vital signs and type of interventions were similar in both groups. Sedation level, duration of procedure and recovery time were comparable in both groups. Sedation quality assessment scale was significantly higher in the midazolam with meperidine group. Degree of pain sensed during the procedure was significantly lower in the midazolam with meperidine group. Midazolam with meperidine group had better patient satisfaction. Twenty-four hours after the procedure, the degree of amnesia between both sedation groups was similar. The number of patients unwilling to repeat the procedure was distinctly higher in midazolam group. Development of hypoxia and arrythmia in the midazolam and midazolam with meperidine groups were comparable. Two patients in the midazolam group developed paradoxical agitation.", 
    "187": "Conscious sedation for ERCP can be successfully and safely achieved by using either only midazolam or a low dose of midazolam with meperidine. Adding of meperidine to midazolam resulted in better patient and endoscopist comfort.", 
    "188": "Analysis of the developmental and sexual expression of cytochrome P450 drug-metabolizing enzymes is impeded by multiple and varied external factors that influence its regulation. In the present study, a CYP2D6/CYP3A4-double transgenic (Tg-CYP2D6/CYP3A4) mouse model was employed to investigate hepatic CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 ontogeny and sexual dimorphism. Both age and sex have considerable effects on hepatic CYP3A4 protein expression in 3- to 8-week-old transgenic mice, whereas neither factor alters CYP2D6 content. Constitutive CYP2D6 expression resulted in 2- to 3-fold higher dextromethorphan O-demethylase activity in Tg-CYP2D6/CYP3A4 mouse liver microsomes compared with wild-type mice. In contrast, expression of CYP3A4 in transgenic mouse livers did not increase dextromethorphan N-demethylase and midazolam 1'-hydroxylase activities. Pretreatment with pregnenolone 16alpha-carbonitrile (PCN) and 1,4-bis-2-(3, 5-dichloropyridyloxy)-benzene (TCPOBOP) elevated CYP3A4 expression in double transgenic mice. Interestingly, induction of hepatic CYP3A4 was greater in females than age- and treatment-matched males. Consequently, the increase in midazolam 1'-hydroxylase activity was markedly higher in 8-week-old female mice than in corresponding males (8-fold versus 6-fold for PCN treatment and 6-fold versus 5-fold for TCPOBOP). Furthermore, increases in testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase activity after CYP3A induction were relatively lower compared with those in midazolam 1'-hydroxylation for age-, sex-, and treatment-matched mice. The difference in CYP3A4 expression and induction between male and female mice suggests that women may be more susceptible to CYP3A4-mediated drug-drug interactions, and the extent of drug-drug interactions could be substrate dependent.", 
    "189": "Previous reports from our laboratory described the sedative activity of hesperidin (hesperetin-7-rhamnoglucoside). This property is greatly increased when the glycoside is injected jointly with diazepam and this interaction has been shown to be synergistic. In the present work the generality of the synergistic phenomenon is proved, since potentiation also occurs with several other benzodiazepines, namely alprazolam, bromazepam, midazolam and flunitrazepam. In order to advance in the study of the mechanism of action of hesperidin, the possible participation of several brain receptors, which are implicated in the control of numerous behavioral and physiological functions, was explored by investigating the effects of a variety of their antagonists on hesperidin actions. The results showed that the 5-HT2 receptor and the alpha1-adrenoceptor seem unlikely to be involved in the behavioral effects of hesperidin. Naltrexone, a nonselective antagonist of opioid receptors, totally blocked hesperidin effects on locomotion, and partially antagonized hesperidin-induced decreased exploration in the hole board test. Nor-binaltorphimine, a selective kappa opioid receptor antagonist, was able to partially block hesperidin effects on locomotor activity. Furthermore, hesperidin-induced antinociception was partially blocked by naltrexone, and potentiated by co-administration with alprazolam. Hence, the participation of the opioid system in the sedative, antinociceptive and potentianting effects of hesperidin with benzodiazepines in mice is highly probable. Our results suggest a possible beneficial use of the association of hesperidin with benzodiazepines, not only to improve human sedative therapy, but also in the management of pain.", 
    "190": "Our laboratory has shown that male testosterone levels are not solely controlled by the release of hypothalamic gonadotrophin-releasing hormone and pituitary luteinising hormone, but are also regulated by a multisynaptic pathway connecting the brain and the testis that interferes with the testosterone response to gonadotrophins. This pathway, which is independent of the pituitary gland, is activated by an i.c.v. injection of either the stress-related peptide corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) or of beta-adrenoceptor agonists, both of which alter androgen release and decrease levels of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor and the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein within Leydig cells. Our original studies used the retrograde transganglionic tracer pseudorabies virus (PRV) to map progression of the virus from the testes to upper brain levels. The present study aimed to extend this work by identifying the regions where CRF and catecholamine neurones represented components of the stress-activated, brain-testicular pathway that prevents testosterone increases. To this end, anaesthetised adult male rats received an intra-testicular injection of PRV. Using immunofluorescence, we identified co-labelling of PRV and either CRF or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the enzyme responsible for biogenic amine synthesis. Co-labelling of PRV and CRF was found in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) and the central amygdala. Co-labelling of PRV and TH was found in the PVN, substantia nigra, A7/K\u00f6lliker-Fuse area, area of A5, locus coeruleus, nucleus of solitary tract, area of C3, area of C2 and the area of C1/A1. These results indicate that most cell groups of the ventral noradrenergic pathway have neurones that are a part of the brain-testicular pathway. This suggests that the stress hormones CRF and catecholamines may act as neurotransmitters that signal the pathway to inhibit increases in plasma testosterone levels.", 
    "191": "Indiplon is a novel sedative-hypnotic recently approved for the treatment of insomnia. Like other non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, its mechanism of action is to modulate subunits, especially the alpha-1 subunit, of the GABA receptor complex in order to induce sedation. Indiplon was developed in two different formulations to address two different types of insomnia complaint: indiplon-IR (immediate release) was designed for sleep onset difficulties, while indiplon-MR (modified release) was developed for sleep maintenance insomnia. While there are currently few peer reviewed articles about indiplon clinical trial results, the early information that is available seems to indicate that both formulations have been well tolerated and have proven effective at improving both patient reported and objectively measured sleep parameters in both adult and elderly insomnia patients. In May 2006, the FDA indicated that indiplon-IR was approvable and plans are to resubmit the application in 2007. Indiplon-MR was unapprovable and may require further evaluation.", 
    "192": "We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of subhypnotic doses of midazolam and propofol for peripartum nausea and vomiting during regional anesthesia for elective cesarean section in order to prevent emesis in at least 50% of patients.", 
    "193": "A prospective, double blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out. Patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups to receive placebo (saline, N=28), propofol (20 mg bolus and 1.0 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) infusion, N=30), and midazolam (1 mg bolus and 1.0 mg x h(-1) infusion, N=30) at subhypnotic doses intravenously (i.v.) immediately after the umbilical cord was clamped. Bupivacaine hydrochloride (8-10 mg) and fentanyl (10 microg) were injected into the intervertebral space for spinal anesthesia. Blood pressure was monitored at 2 min intervals and intraoperative postdelivery emetic episodes and ephedrine consumption were recorded. The study was carried out at the Anesthesiology Department, Hacettepe University, Turkey, hospitalized care. We included 90 parturients with ASA physical status I and II between the ages of 20 and 38 years undergoing spinal anesthesia for elective cesarean delivery to evaluate the efficacy of subhypnotic doses of propofol and midazolam and, in particular, the incidence of nausea, retching, and vomiting intraoperatively.", 
    "194": "The incidence of nausea, retching, and vomiting was significantly higher in the control group, compared to the propofol and midazolam groups. Total ephedrine consumption was significantly higher in the control group compared to the propofol and midazolam groups.", 
    "195": "A subhypnotic dose of midazolam (1 mg x h(-1)) was as effective as the subhypnotic dose of propofol (1 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in parturients undergoing cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.", 
    "196": "A significant body of data suggests that GABA(A) receptors are altered in the CNS of subjects with schizophrenia. However, subjects with schizophrenia are treated with antipsychotic drugs and, in some cases, antipsychotic drugs and benzodiazepines. It has therefore been suggested that the changes in GABA(A) receptors in the CNS of subjects with schizophrenia are due to such drug treatments. Surprisingly, there appear to be no studies to determine the effect of a combined antipsychotic-benzodiazepine treatment on GABA(A) receptors. We therefore measured both the GABA binding site ([3H]muscimol) and the benzodiazepine binding site ([3H]flumazenil) in the CNS of rats treated with either haloperidol, diazepam or a combination of the two drugs. The main findings of our study are that treatment with diazepam or the combination of diazepam and haloperidol results in regionally selective increases GABA binding sites but treatment with haloperidol alone decreases the GABA binding site in the thalamus but increases these sites in the hypothalamus. By contrast, treatment with diazepam, haloperidol and a combination of the two drugs resulted in widespread decreases in the number of benzodiazepine binding sites in the rat CNS. The notable exception to this outcome was increased numbers of benzodiazepine binding sites in the frontal cortex of rats that had received diazepam. Our data suggests that there are complex changes in the GABA(A) receptor following treatment with haloperidol, diazepam or a combination of these drugs. This outcome may be relevant to the therapeutic benefits of using both drugs in conjunction early in the treatment of a psychotic episode.", 
    "197": "Privileged structures are defined as molecular frameworks which are able of providing useful ligands for more than one type of receptor or enzyme target by judicious structural modifications. In the present work, we describe some examples and applications of the usefulness of the privileged structure concept for the structural design of new drug candidates, by discussing the eligibility of such motifs, including the identification of the N-acylhydrazone template as privileged structures.", 
    "198": "Many studies indicate a dissociation between two forms of orientation: allocentric orientation, in which an organism orients on the basis of cues external to the organism, and egocentric spatial orientation (ESO) by which an organism orients on the basis of proprioceptive information. While allocentric orientation is mediated primarily by the hippocampus and its afferent and efferent connections, ESO is mediated by the prefronto-striatal system. Striatal lesions as well as classical neuroleptics, which block dopamine receptors, act through the prefronto-striatal system and impair ESO. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of the atypical antipsychotics clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone which are believed to exert its antipsychotic effects mainly by dopaminergic, cholinergic and serotonergic mechanisms. A delayed-two-alternative-choice-task, under conditions that required ESO and at the same time excluded allocentric spatial orientation was used. Clozapine and olanzapine treated rats made more errors than risperidone treated rats in the delayed alternation in comparison with the controls. Motor abilities were not impaired by any of the drugs. Thus, with regard to the delayed alternation requiring ESO, clozapine and olanzapine but not risperidone affects the prefronto-striatal system in a similar way as classical neuroleptics does.", 
    "199": "A successful unified pharmacophore/receptor model which has guided the synthesis of subtype selective compounds is reviewed in light of recent developments both in ligand synthesis and structural studies of the binding site itself. The evaluation of experimental data in combination with a comparative model of the alpha1beta2gamma2 GABA(A) receptor leads to an orientation of the pharmacophore model within the Bz BS. Results not only are important for the rational design of selective ligands, but also for the identification and evaluation of possible roles which specific residues may have within the benzodiazepine binding pocket.", 
    "200": "The relief of post-cesarean delivery pain is important. Good pain relief improves mobility and reduces the risk of thromboembolic disease, which may have been increased during pregnancy. Pain may impair the mother's ability to optimally care for her infant in the immediate postpartum period and may adversely affect early interactions between mother and infant. It is necessary, therefore that pain relief be safe and effective and results in no adverse neonatal effects during breast-feeding. Music may be considered as a potential method of post cesarean pain therapy due to its noninvasiveness and lack of side effects. In this study we evaluated the effect of intraoperative music under general anesthesia for reducing the postoperative morphine requirements after cesarean section.", 
    "201": "In a double blind placebo-controlled trial, 100 women (ASA I) scheduled for elective cesarean section under general anesthesia, were randomly allocated into two groups of fifty. After standardization of anesthesia, patients in the music group were exposed to a compact disk of Spanish guitar after induction of anesthesia up to the time of wound dressing. In the control group patients were exposed to white music. Post operative pain and anxiety were evaluated by visual analog scale (VAS) up to six hours after discharge from PACU. Morphine was given intravenously for reducing pain to VAS < or = 3 postoperatively.", 
    "202": "There was not statistically significant difference in VAS for pain between two groups up to six hours postoperatively (P>0.05). In addition, morphine requirements were not different between two groups at different time intervals up to six hours postoperatively (P>0.05). There were not statistically significant difference between two groups regarding postoperative anxiety score and vomiting frequency (P>0.05).", 
    "203": "As per conditions of this study, intraoperative Spanish music was not effective in reducing postoperative pain after cesarean section. In addition postoperative morphine requirement, anxiety, and vomiting were not affected by the music during general anesthesia.", 
    "204": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia affecting nearly 18 million people around the world and 4.5 million in the US. It is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that is estimated to dramatically increase in prevalence as the elderly population continues to grow. As the cognitive and neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms of AD progresses in severity over time, affected individuals become increasingly dependent on others for assistance in performing all activities of daily living. The burden of caring for someone affected by the disorder is great and has substantial impact on a family's emotional, social and financial well-being. In the US, the currently approved medications for the treatment of mild to moderate stages of AD are the cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs). Cholinesterase inhibitors have shown modest efficacy in terms of symptomatic improvement and stabilization for periods generally ranging from 6 to 12 months. There are additional data that have emerged, which suggest longer-term benefits. For the moderate to severe stages of AD, memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist is in widespread use and has shown modest benefit as monotherapy and in combination with ChEIs. The cost effectiveness of the currently available therapeutic agents for AD has undergone great scrutiny and remains controversial, especially outside the US. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as agitation and psychosis are common in AD. Unfortunately, in the US there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents for the treatment of these symptoms, although atypical antipsychotics have shown some efficacy and have been widely used. However, the use of these agents has recently warranted special caution due to reports of associated adverse effects such as weight gain, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, cerebrovascular events, and an increased risk for death. Alternative agents used to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms include serotonergic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and anticonvulsant medications.", 
    "205": "Benzodiazepines are the most commonly prescribed psychoactive drug in western societies. While associated with risk and harm, they have a legitimate place in therapeutics. Prescribing practice does not reflect guidelines and guidelines rarely provide the practical strategies required to manage the complex clinical management of conditions such as anxiety, insomnia and drug dependence.", 
    "206": "This article proposes a model for rational prescribing of benzodiazepines that may be transferable to other therapeutic situations requiring the consideration of complex health, social and system factors.", 
    "207": "Benzodiazepines, like all psychoactive drugs, have their 'good', 'bad' and 'ugly' side. Prescribing decisions are complex along the spectrum of use. Many subtle factors influence how each of us prescribe such as our knowledge of our patients, their medical histories, their personal situations and the individual doctor-patient relationship.", 
    "208": "Up to 15% of people that are visited in the Emergency Department of a Hospital have a mental disorder and/or a psychiatric symptom: often this is not recognized or not properly treated. The reasons for this are more than one and involve: the emergency physicians that are not always prepared and sensible to face this kind of disorders; the psychiatrists that are not always well tuned with the language and the clinic of the emergency; and the patients, that can ignore or deny the psychiatric nature of their problems. After an initial definitions of the most important terms and concepts (Psychiatric Emergency and Urgency, Behavioral Emergency, Acute Presentations of Mental Disorders, and Crisis) the Medical and Psychiatric Assessment are discussed with different Clinical Presentations and Classifications, Psychosocial Evaluation and Risk Assessment. Finally the Clinical Management and the Pharmacological Treatment are presented with special attention to the underlying medical causes and to the use of new drugs, especially second generation antipsychotics, alone or combined with benzodiazepines.", 
    "209": "The aim of the present study was to develop a population pharmacokinetic model of carbamazepine from routine therapeutic drug monitoring data. Steady-state carbamazepine plasma concentrations determined by homogenous enzyme immunoassay technique, dosing history including cotherapy, schedule of blood sampling, and patients' demographic characteristics were collected retrospectively from patients' chart histories. A one-compartment model was fitted to the data using nonlinear mixed effects modeling. The influence of weight, age, gender, smoking, allergy, carbamazepine daily dose, and cotherapy on clearance (CL/F) was evaluated. Additionally, bioavailability of controlled-release relative to immediate-release tablets was assessed. Two hundred sixty-five patients (423 concentrations) were used to develop a population pharmacokinetic model. The population estimate of CL/F from the base model was 5.14 L/h with interindividual variability of 50.20%. Patients' gender, age, smoking, allergy, cotherapy with lamotrigine and benzodiazepines had no effect on CL/F. Patient weight (WT), daily carbamazepine dose (DCBZ), daily dose of phenobarbitone (DPB) and valproic acid (VPA), when its daily dose exceeded 750 mg, significantly influenced CL/F and were included in the final model:[equation: see text] where VPA is 1 if dose is greater than 750 mg or 0 otherwise. No difference in bioavailability of carbamazepine between controlled- and immediate-release tablets was detected. The model predictions in the validation set had no bias and satisfactory precision. The model can be used for estimation of carbamazepine CL/F in individual patients in the postautoinduction phase and for selection of optimum dosing regimen in routine patient care.", 
    "210": "An original method based on the use of high-performance liquid chromatography with both coulometric and diode array detection has been developed for the therapeutic drug monitoring of patients with bipolar disorders being treated with olanzapine and lamotrigine. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a reversed-phase C8 column (150 x 4.6 mm internal diameter, 5 microm) using a mobile phase composed of methanol (27%) and a 50.0 mmol/L, pH 3.5 phosphate buffer (73%). For the analysis of olanzapine and its main metabolite, N-desmethylolanzapine, a coulometric detector was used, with electrode 1 set at -200 mV and electrode 2 at +500 mV. Lamotrigine was determined using a diode array detection at 220 nm. The two detectors were connected in series. For the analysis of biological samples, a clean-up procedure was implemented by means of solid-phase extraction using phenyl cartridges and eluting the analytes with methanol; only a small volume of plasma (150 microL) was needed to analyze both olanzapine and lamotrigine. Linear responses were obtained between 0.1 and 50.0 ng mL(-1) for olanzapine, 0.1 and 25.0 ng mL(-1) for N-desmethylolanzapine, and between 0.25 and 10.0 microg mL(-1) for lamotrigine. The extraction yield values were always higher than 90% for all the analytes, with precision (expressed as relative standard deviation values) lower than 3.4%. The method was applied successfully to some human plasma samples drawn from bipolar patients undergoing combined therapy with the two drugs. Satisfactory values for accuracy were obtained, with mean recovery higher than 91%. Thus, the method appears suitable for the investigation of the chemical-clinical correlations in patients receiving therapy with olanzapine and lamotrigine.", 
    "211": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were introduced in 1987 as an alternative treatment option for patients with depression or certain anxiety disorders. Unfortunately, this greater use has prompted a corresponding increase in reports of more severe side effects and fatalities, with a majority of fatalities occurring due to coingestion of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with other substances or serotonergic drugs. We report a case which exemplifies one such fatality related to sertraline, lorazepam, and codeine coingestion. A brief discussion of the presumed mechanism by which death occurred will be offered.", 
    "212": "Extraction of arterial input functions from dynamic brain scans may obviate the need for arterial sampling and would increase the clinical applicability of quantitative PET studies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate applicability and accuracy of image derived input functions (IDIFs) following reconstruction based partial volume correction (PVC). Settings for the PVC ordered subset expectation maximization (PVC-OSEM) reconstruction algorithm were varied. In addition, different methods for defining arterial regions of interest (ROI) in order to extract IDIFs were evaluated. [(11)C]flumazenil data of 10 subjects were used in the present study. Results obtained with IDIFs were compared with those using standard on-line measured arterial input functions. These included areas under the curve (AUC) for peak (1-2 min) and tail (2-60 min), volume of distribution (V(T)) obtained using Logan analysis, and V(T) and K(1) obtained with a basis function implementation of a single tissue compartment model. Best results were obtained with PVC-OSEM using 4 iterations and 16 subsets. Based on (11)C point source measurements, a 4.5 mm FWHM (full width at half maximum) resolution kernel was used to correct for partial volume effects. A ROI consisting of the four hottest pixels per plane (over the carotid arteries) was the best method to extract IDIFs. Excellent peak AUC ratios (0.99+/-0.09) between IDIF and blood sampler input function (BSIF) were found. Furthermore, extracted IDIFs provided V(T) and K(1) values that were very similar to those obtained using BSIFs. The proposed method appears to be suitable for analysing [(11)C]flumazenil data without the need for online arterial sampling."
