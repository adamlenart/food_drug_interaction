Apathy was defined as an Apathy Scale score > or =14 points in 152 Huntington's disease mutation carriers and 56 noncarriers. Correlates of apathy were analyzed cross-sectionally in mutation carriers using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Forty-nine (32%) Huntington's disease mutation carriers showed apathy compared to none of the noncarriers. After exclusion of 10 depressed patients, apathy was independently associated with male sex, worse global functioning, and higher use of neuroleptics and benzodiazepines.",

Block performance time, block onset time, duration of surgery, and block duration were measured. Seventeen consecutive patients were recruited. The mean (SD) block performance and onset times were 271 (67.9) seconds and 9.7 (3.7) minutes, respectively. Block duration was 160.8 (30.7) minutes. All operations were performed using regional anesthesia alone. The duration of anesthesia obtained is sufficient for most ambulatory hand surgery.", 
    "2": "The oral administration of midazolam has often been used for sedation in pediatric patients. However, oral administration of an intravenous formulation of midazolam is difficult for younger pediatric patients because of its bitter taste. Liposomes have been developed as vesicles encapsulating various kinds of drugs to serve as a medical drug-delivery system. Thus, the aim of the present study was to produce pH-sensitive liposomes encapsulating midazolam and to evaluate its pharmacokinetics on rabbits. Liposome-encapsulated midazolam was produced from hydrogenated L-\u03b1-phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, dipalmitoylphosphatidic acid, and midazolam. The capacity of liposomes to encapsulate midazolam (encapsulation efficiency), stability of encapsulation, and release efficiency were evaluated in vitro. Further, the produced liposome-encapsulated midazolam solution was orally administered to rabbits in vivo. As a result, midazolam was encapsulated by liposomes with a high encapsulation efficiency and was stably encapsulated in a physiological medium. Further, the produced liposomes rapidly and effectively released midazolam in an acidic medium in vitro. When the liposome-encapsulated midazolam solution was orally administered to rabbits, the time to achieve the maximum plasma concentration of midazolam after administration was slightly longer, but both the maximum plasma concentration and area under the concentration-time curve were higher than those receiving midazolam solution. In conclusion, we produced pH-sensitive liposome-encapsulated midazolam, which remained stable in a physiological medium and showed efficient release in an acidic environment. The results suggest that it is possible to clinically use liposome-encapsulated midazolam for oral administration as a useful drug-delivery vehicle.", 
    "3": "Among a variety of drugs used in the treatment of anxiety disorders, benzodiazepines and antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are at present the most established and prescribed. In fact, recent guidelines recommend the antidepressants SSRI and SNRI as well as pregabaline, a newly developed drug, as the 1st choice treatment in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, antidepressants have several disadvantages (latency of onset of action, adverse effects and drug interactions) that should not be neglected. Pregabaline is a drug with a new mechanism of action. Clinical studies up to now indicate a rather rapid and efficient anxiolytic effect comparable to that of benzodiazepines, with no risk of abuse. Pregabaline has been recently introduced in Switzerland for the treatment of GAD.", 
    "4": "The objective of the present study was to prepare mucoadhesive in situ nasal gels with mucilage isolated from fig fruits (Ficus carica, family: Moraceae) containing midazolam hydrochloride. Nasal gels of midazolam were prepared using three different concentrations (0.5%, 1.0% and 1.5% w/v) of F. carica mucilage (FCM) and synthetic polymers (hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and Carbopol 934). Evaluation of FCM showed that it was as safe as the synthetic polymers for nasal administration. In situ gels were prepared with mixture Pluronic F127 and mucoadhesive agents. Evaluation of the prepared gels was carried out, including determination of viscosity, texture profile analysis and mucoadhesive strength. In vitro drug permeation study was conducted with the gels prepared with and without permeation enhancer (0.5% w/v sodium taurocholate) using excised goat nasal mucosa. In vitro permeation profiles were evaluated, and histological study of nasal mucosae before and after permeation study was also conducted to determine histological change, if any. In vivo experiments conducted in rabbits further confirmed that in situ nasal gels provided better bioavailability of midazolam than the gels prepared from synthetic mucoadhesive polymers. It was observed that the nasal gel containing 0.5% FCM and 0.5% sodium taurocholate exhibited appropriate rheological, mechanical and mucoadhesive properties and showed better drug release profiles. Moreover, this formulation produced no damage to the nasal mucosa that was used for the permeation study, and absolute bioavailability was also higher compared to gels prepared from synthetic polymers.", 
    "5": "We evaluated cortical damages following traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the acute phase with [(123)I] iomazenil (IMZ) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In all, 12 patients with cerebral contusion following TBI were recruited. All patients underwent IMZ SPECT within 1 week after TBI. To investigate the changes in distribution of IMZ in the cortex in the chronic phase, after conventional treatment, patients underwent IMZ SPECT again. A decrease in the accumulation of radioligand for the central benzodiazepine receptor in the cortex corresponding to the contusion revealed with computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were shown on IMZ SPECT in the acute phase in all patients. In 9 of 12 patients (75%), images of IMZ SPECT obtained in the chronic phase of TBI showed that areas with a decreased distribution of IMZ were remarkably reduced in comparison with those obtained in the acute phase. Both CT scans and MRI showed a normal appearance of the cortex morphologically, where the binding potential of IMZ recovered in the chronic phase. Reduced binding potential of radioligand for the central benzodiazepine receptor is considered to be an irreversible reaction; however, in this study, IMZ accumulation in the cortex following TBI was recovered in the chronic phase in several patients. [(123)I] iomazenil SPECT may have a potential to disclose a reversible vulnerability of neurons following TBI.",

Twenty-four adult patients received an intravenous Bu-cyclophoshamide conditioning regimen prior to bone marrow transplantation. Busilvex (0.8 mg/kg) was administered every six hours during four consecutive days. Clonazepam (0.025 to 0.03 mg/kg/day as a continuous 12-h i.v. infusion) was administered at least 12 hours prior to i.v. Bu dosing and continued until 24 hours after the last dose. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data were compared with those previously collected in patients (n=127) treated with phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis. Through population PK analysis, a 10% average increase (coefficient of variation, RSE=5.35%) in total clearance of Bu was quantified when Bu was associated with clonazepam as compared to phenytoin, which was considered as not being clinically relevant. The suspected induction on Bu metabolism by phenytoin should have resulted in the opposite effect. The patient efficacy and safety profiles were comparable between the two cohorts.",

During the hyperinsulinemic clamp, the glucose infusion rate (GIR) required to maintain euglycemia and the rate of glucose utilization (R(d)) were decreased in OLZ-IV, whereas endogenous glucose production (EGP) rate was increased compared with vehicle-IV. Consistent with an elevation in EGP, the OLZ-IV group had higher hepatic mRNA levels for the enzymes glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Phosphorylation of hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was increased in OLZ-IV rats compared with controls. Similarly, an intracerebroventricular infusion of OLZ resulted in a transient increase in glycemia as well as a higher R(a) in the basal period. During the hyperinsulinemic period, OLZ-ICV caused a decreased GIR, an increased EGP, but no change in R(d). Furthermore, OLZ-ICV rats had increased hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes and elevated hypothalamic neuropeptide-Y and agouti-related protein mRNA levels.",

    "11": "Endoscopic procedures are often necessary in patients with chronic liver disease. The preprocedure evaluation of such patients should include an assessment of hepatic synthetic function and identification of neuropsychiatric findings suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy. It may be possible, in some cases, to perform diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoscopy without administration of sedation; this is desirable to eliminate the risks of sedation, especially encephalopathy. Nonetheless, most patients undergoing upper and lower endoscopy require sedation. Currently, the use of propofol is preferred to benzodiazepines and opioids for endoscopic sedation of patients with advanced liver disease due to its short biologic half-life and low risk of provoking hepatic encephalopathy. In appropriately selected patients, gastroenterologist-directed propofol administration seems safe.", 
    "12": "Despite data supporting its efficacy, barriers to implementation of buprenorphine for office-based treatment are present. Complications can occur during buprenorphine inductions, yet few published studies have examined this phase of treatment. To examine factors associated with complications during buprenorphine induction, we conducted a retrospective chart review of the first 107 patients receiving buprenorphine treatment in an urban community health center. The primary outcome, defined as complicated induction (precipitated or protracted withdrawal), was observed in 18 (16.8%) patients. Complicated inductions were associated with poorer treatment retention (than routine inductions) and decreased over time. Factors independently associated with complicated inductions included recent use of prescribed methadone, recent benzodiazepine use, no prior experience with buprenorphine, and a low initial dose of buprenorphine/naloxone. Findings from this study and further investigation of patient characteristics and treatment characteristics associated with complicated inductions can help guide buprenorphine treatment strategies.",

Although osteoblasts contribute to the regulation of the hematopoietic stem cell niche and control osteoclastogenesis through production of proresorptive cytokine RANKL (receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand), their role in cancer metastases to bone is not fully understood. C57BL/6J mouse bone marrow cells were treated for 3-12 days with ascorbic acid (50 \u03bcg/ml) in the presence or absence of 10% medium conditioned by breast carcinoma cells MDA-MB-231, 4T1, or MCF7. Treatment with cancer-derived factors resulted in a sustained 40-60% decrease in osteoblast differentiation markers, compared with treatment with ascorbic acid alone, and induced an osteoclastogenic change in the RANKL/osteoprotegerin ratio. Importantly, exposure of bone cells to breast cancer-derived factors stimulated the subsequent attachment of cancer cells to immature osteoblasts. Inhibition of \u03b3-secretase using pharmacological inhibitors DAPT and Compound E completely reversed cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis as well as cancer-induced enhancement of cancer cell attachment, identifying \u03b3-secretase activity as a key mediator of these effects. Thus, we have uncovered osteoblasts as critical intermediary of premetastatic signaling by breast cancer cells and pinpointed \u03b3-secretase as a robust target for developing therapeutics potentially capable of reducing both homing and progression of cancer metastases to bone.",

Based on information from her family and a mental state examination, her primary diagnosis was sleep state misperception. She was treated with Trazodone. Because she was unresponsive to the treatment, a full psychiatric evaluation and wrist actigraphy report were undertaken, resulting in a revised diagnosis of delusional disorder. She was started on Olanzapine and, after 6 weeks was discharged with good improvement. Sleep state misperception might be considered not just as a sleep disorder, but also as a psychiatric disorder with psychotic symptoms. Further research is recommended.",

    "71": "Neurosteroids regulate GABA-A receptor plasticity. Neurosteroid withdrawal occurs during menstruation and is associated with a marked increase in expression of GABA-A receptor \u03b14-subunit, a key subunit linked to enhanced neuronal excitability, seizure susceptibility and benzodiazepine resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the upregulation of \u03b14-subunit expression remain unclear. Here we utilized the progesterone receptor (PR) knockout mouse to investigate molecular pathways of PR and the transcription factor early growth response factor-3 (Egr3) in regulation of the GABA-A receptor \u03b14-subunit expression in the hippocampus in a mouse neurosteroid withdrawal paradigm. Neurosteroid withdrawal induced a threefold increase in \u03b14-subunit expression in wild-type mice, but this upregulation was unchanged in PR knockout mice. The expression of Egr3, which controls \u03b14-subunit transcription, was increased significantly following neurosteroid withdrawal in wild-type and PR knockout mice. Neurosteroid withdrawal-induced \u03b14-subunit upregulation was completely suppressed by antisense Egr3 inhibition. In the hippocampus kindling model of epilepsy, there was heightened seizure activity, significant reduction in the antiseizure sensitivity of diazepam (a benzodiazepine insensitive at \u03b14\u03b2\u03b3-receptors) and conferral of increased seizure protection of flumazenil (a low-affinity agonist at \u03b14\u03b2\u03b3-receptors) in neurosteroid-withdrawn wild-type and PR knockout mice. These observations are consistent with enhanced \u03b14-containing receptor abundance in vivo. Neurosteroid withdrawal-induced seizure exacerbation, diazepam insensitivity, and flumazenil efficacy in the kindling model were reversed by inhibition of Egr3. These results indicate that neurosteroid withdrawal-induced upregulation of GABA-A receptor \u03b14-subunit expression is mediated by the Egr3 via a PR-independent signaling pathway. These findings help advance our understanding of the molecular basis of catamenial epilepsy, a neuroendocrine condition that occurs around the perimenstrual period and is characterized by neurosteroid withdrawal-linked seizure exacerbations in women with epilepsy.",

    "86": "Anxiety disorders, as a group, are among the most common mental health conditions and frequently cause significant functional impairment. Both psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic techniques are recognized to be effective management strategies. This review provides a discussion of the major classes of psychotropic medications investigated in clinical trials of the following anxiety disorders: panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Findings suggest that both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are useful first-line agents for most of the anxiety disorders, particularly given the frequent comorbidity with mood disorders. Highly serotonergic agents are preferred for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Other antidepressants, such as tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, are generally reserved as second- and third-line strategies due to tolerability issues. Evidence for other agents, including anticonvulsants and atypical antipsychotics, suggests that they may have an adjunctive role to antidepressants in cases of treatment resistance, while azapirones have been used effectively for generalized anxiety disorder, and a substantial body of evidence supports benzodiazepine use in panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Despite notable advances, many patients with anxiety disorders fail to adequately respond to existing pharmacologic treatments. Increased research attention should be focused on systematizing pharmacologic and combined pharmacologic-psychosocial strategies to address treatment resistance and developing novel treatments for anxiety disorders.",

    "90": "The mdm2 oncogene product, MDM2, is an ubiquitin protein ligase that inhibits the transcriptional activity of the tumor suppressor p53 and promotes its degradation. About 50% of all human cancers present mutations or deletions in the TP53 gene. In the remaining half of all human neoplasias that express the wild-type protein, aberrations of p53 regulators, such as MDM2, account for p53 inhibition. For this reason, designing small-molecule inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 protein-protein interaction is a promising strategy for the treatment of cancers retaining wild-type p53. The development of inhibitors has been challenging. Although many small-molecule MDM2 inhibitors have shown potent in vitro activity, only a limited number of compounds have demonstrated to possess acceptable pharmacokinetic properties for in vivo evaluation. To date, the most studied chemotypes have been cis-imidazolines (such as nutlins), benzodiazepines, and spiro-oxindoles. The cis-imidazolines were the first discovered potent and selective small-molecule inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 interaction and they continue to show therapeutic potential. This review will focus on recent molecular modeling approaches (molecular dynamics, pharmacophore-based, molecular docking, structure-based design) used with the aim to better understand the behavior of these proteins and to discover new small-molecule inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 protein-protein interaction for the treatment of cancer.", 
    "91": "A series of molecular complexes, both co-crystals and salts, of a triazole drug-alprazolam-with carboxylic acids, boric acid, boronic acids, and phenols have been analyzed with respect to heterosynthons present in the crystal structures. In all cases, the triazole ring behaves as an efficient hydrogen bond acceptor with the acidic coformers. The hydrogen bond patterns exhibited with aromatic carboxylic acids were found to depend on the nature and position of the substituents. Being a strong acid, 2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid forms a salt with alprazolam. With aliphatic dicarboxylic acids alprazolam forms hydrates and the water molecules play a central role in synthon formation and crystal packing. The triazole ring makes two distinct heterosynthons in the molecular complex with boric acid. Boronic acids and phenols form consistent hydrogen bond patterns, and these are seemingly independent of the substitutional effects. Boronic acids form noncentrosymmetric cyclic synthons, while phenols form O--H...N hydrogen bonds with the triazole ring.", 
    "92": "We evaluated sequential changes in rat brain function up to 14 days after focal ischemic insult with a small animal positron emission tomography (PET).

At 1 and 3 days after PIT, [(18)F]FDG indicated lower uptake in the infarct area. Interestingly, unexpectedly high-[(18)F]FDG uptake was observed in the peri-infarct area surrounding the infarct area at day 7. The high-[(18)F]FDG uptake region completely overlapped with the high-[(11)C](R)-PK uptake region at day 7, which resulted in the underestimation of neuronal damage. Immunohistochemical data also suggested that the high-[(18)F]FDG uptake peak at day 7 was caused by inflammation including microglial cell activation. In contrast, imaging with [(11)C]FMZ indicated cortical neuronal damage on days 7 and 14 without any disturbance by microglial formation. These results indicated that [(18)F]FDG might not be a suitable ligand for ischemic neuronal damage detection from acute to subacute phases.",

Z-drugs are covered by SHIs but physicians can also provide private prescriptions for SHI insured persons, who then have to pay for these out of pocket.

There are substantial regional variations for zolpidem (28.8-82.6%) and zopiclone (22.5-68.6%). In all federal states the proportion of zolpidem not reimbursed by SHIs is higher than that of zopiclone (6.3-15.4%). The nation-wide outpatient consumption was 2.5 DID for zolpidem and 2.7 DID for zopiclone with large regional variations.",

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of sodium valproate and olanzapine administered alone or in combination in patients suffering from acute mania. Patients (N = 30) suffering from acute mania were divided into two equal groups. Group 1 patients were treated with sodium valproate 250 mg 3 times a day and Group 2 patients received olanzapine 5 mg twice daily. In both groups sodium valproate or olanzapine was given as add-on therapy at 3 weeks. The primary method of assessment was 50% or more improvement on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). The serum levels of valproic acid were also measured. Sodium valproate and olanzapine were effective in the treatment of acute mania with all patients demonstrating a 50% or more improvement on the YMRS. Sodium valproate-treated patients receiving olanzapine in the third week had a 15.3% decrease in the YMRS score and patients on olanzapine receiving sodium valproate had a 23.7% decrease. Patients who attained serum valproic acid levels of 100 \u03bcg/mL showed improvement on the YMRS.

Carriers of the deletion allele (n=29) were compared with Ins/Ins homozygotes (noncarriers, n=29) in a mixed model encompassing 10 weight measurements over 16 weeks. Deletion allele carriers showed significantly more weight gain after 6 weeks of treatment regardless of assigned medication. Although deletion carriers were prescribed higher doses of olanzapine (but not risperidone), dose did not seem to account for the genotype effects on weight gain. Given earlier evidence that deletion carriers show reduced symptom response to medication, additional study of appropriate treatment options for these patients seems warranted.",

    "104": "The pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBD) are naturally occurring antitumor antibiotics, and a PBD dimer (SJG-136, SG2000) is in phase II trials. Many potent PBDs contain a C2-endo-exo unsaturated motif associated with the pyrrolo C-ring. The novel compound SG2202 is a PBD dimer containing this motif. SG2285 is a water-soluble prodrug of SG2202 in which two bisulfite groups inactivate the PBD N10-C11 imines. Once the bisulfites are eliminated, the imine moieties can bind covalently in the DNA minor groove, forming an interstrand cross-link. The mean in vitro cytotoxic potency of SG2285 against human tumor cell lines is GI(50) 20 pmol/L. SG2285 is highly efficient at producing DNA interstrand cross-links in cells, but they form more slowly than those produced by SG2202. Cellular sensitivity to SG2285 was primarily dependent on ERCC1 and homologous recombination repair. In primary B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples, the mean LD(50) was significantly lower than in normal age-matched B and T lymphocytes. Antitumor activity was shown in several human tumor xenograft models, including ovarian, non-small cell lung, prostate, pancreatic, and melanoma, with cures obtained in the latter model with a single dose. Further, in an advanced-stage colon model, SG2285 administered either as a single dose, or in two repeat dose schedules, was superior to irinotecan. Our findings define SG2285 as a highly active cytotoxic compound with antitumor properties desirable for further development.",

We treated Balb/c mice with diazepam and infected them with cowpox (CPXV) and vaccinia virus (VACV). Disease index, weight loss and the antibody response were determined. Additionally the influence of different benzodiazepines on the mitogen response of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and spleen cells was tested. Diazepam led to earlier disease onset, prolonged duration of symptoms, higher weight loss and overall disease index in VACV infected mice. CPXV infected mice developed poxviral skin lesions only after drug administration and a significant decrease in the specific antibody response was also observed. Diazepam and alprazolam also inhibited the proliferative response of human lymphocytes/spleen cells in vitro but did not show noteworthy apoptotic effects. It is surprising that even a single dose of diazepam has a profound influence on the immune system, sufficient to facilitate symptomatic infectious disease. These data provide first evidence that commonly used drugs like Valium may augment severity of rare poxvirus infections such as CPXV or monkeypox. As VACV is still used as life vaccine against smallpox there is also a risk of enhanced side effects or possible interference with the success of vaccination.",

Additional guidance is provided about effective management of side effects, and appropriate coadministration of benzodiazepines and other agents, to achieve desired outcomes.", 
    "114": "In many countries, benzodiazepines are the most commonly used and misused psychoactive medicinal drugs. Results of epidemiological studies investigating the association between benzodiazepine use and traffic accidents seem to be inconclusive or inconsistent at first sight. However, the outcome of epidemiological studies may be influenced by several methodological factors like study design, study population, exposure measurement, outcome definitions and possible confounders. Our objective was to conduct a systematic literature review of epidemiological studies that investigated the association between benzodiazepine use and traffic accidents, including related outcomes like culpability and injury or accident severity. We searched EMBASE, PubMed and Forensic Science Abstracts 3/0 (FORS) for references included in these databases at 1 June 2009 using the term 'benzodiazepines' in combination with 'driving performance' or 'accident risk' or 'traffic accident'. For inclusion in this review, the study design had to be comparative, include road users involved in accidents and provide specific data about benzodiazepines. Sixty-six studies were included in the review. The study populations varied from the general (driving) population, accident-involved road users with or without injury and persons admitted to a hospital to fatally injured accident-involved drivers. Exposure assessment was performed by using toxicological results, prescription data or questionnaires. The divergent study populations and comparison groups and the variety of methods used to express the outcome of interest hampered comparison between results. Evidence is growing that exposure to benzodiazepines is related to increased accident risk. The literature indicates that the greatest accident risk is associated with the use of long half-life benzodiazepines, increasing dosage and the first few weeks of use of benzodiazepines. Clear evidence of increased culpability associated with benzodiazepine use is scarce. More research has to be done to elucidate the relationship between benzodiazepine use and injury severity.",

The majority of family physicians agreed with restrictions in their prescription based on the guidelines.", 
    "129": "Fatigue is a common side effect of medications. This review summarizes some of the mechanisms by which drugs may cause fatigue. One major mechanism by which medications can cause fatigue is by central nervous system (CNS) depression. CNS depression can result from decreased excitatory activity, as is commonly seen with some anticholinergic agents, centrally acting alpha-agonists, and anticonvulsants. CNS depression can also result from increased inhibitory activity within the CNS, as is seen with benzodiazepines and barbiturates, which augment the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid. Opioids also increase inhibitory CNS activity through their interactions with the various subtypes of opioid receptors. Acting outside of the CNS, medications may cause fatigue as a result of either a true or a functional anemia by a number of mechanisms. Bone marrow toxicity, which results in decreased hematopoiesis, is such a mechanism. This is commonly seen with antineoplastics agents, but can also be observed in association with a wide variety of medication classes, including anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and antimicrobial agents. Another way that medications can cause anemia is by increased red blood cell destruction, as is seen with immune hemolytic anemia. Additionally, medications may cause a functional anemia through alteration of the heme group within the hemoglobin molecule, as is seen in methemoglobinemia. Finally, many drugs, including placebos, cause fatigue by unknown mechanisms. In addition to causing fatigue, some medications may be used to help relieve fatigue, although this drug class is limited in number at this point in time.",

    "131": "TLN-4601 is a farnesylated dibenzodiazepinone isolated from Micromonospora sp. with an antiproliferative effect on several human cancer cell lines. Although the mechanism of action of TLN-4601 is unknown, our earlier work indicated that TLN-4601 binds the PBR (peripheral benzodiazepine receptor; more recently known as the translocator protein or TSPO), an 18 kDa protein associated with the mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) pore. While the exact function of the PBR remains a matter of debate, it has been implicated in heme and steroid synthesis, cellular growth and differentiation, oxygen consumption and apoptosis. Using the Jurkat immortalized T-lymphocyte cell line, documented to have negligible PBR expression, and Jurkat cells stably transfected with a human PBR cDNA, the present study demonstrates that TLN-4601 induces apoptosis independently of PBR expression. As PBRs are overexpressed in brain tumors compared to normal brain, we examined if TLN-4601 would preferentially accumulate in tumors using an intra-cerebral tumor model. Our results demonstrate the ability of TLN-4601 to effectively bind the PBR in vivo as determined by competitive binding assay and receptor occupancy. Analysis of TLN-4601 tissue and plasma indicated that TLN-4601 preferentially accumulates in the tumor. Indeed, drug levels were 200-fold higher in the tumor compared to the normal brain. TLN-4601 accumulation in the tumor (176 \u03bcg/g) was also significant compared to liver (24.8 \u03bcg/g; 7-fold) and plasma (16.2 \u03bcg/mL; 11-fold). Taken together our data indicate that while PBR binding does not mediate cell growth inhibition and apoptosis, PBR binding may allow for the specific accumulation of TLN-4601 in PBR positive tumors.",

    "136": "Long-lasting presence of avoidance and emotional numbing are reliable behavioral markers for PTSD, but little is known about its psychological and biological underpinnings. We employed our recently established mouse model of PTSD (i) to study the emergence of avoidance behavior in the aftermath of a trauma, (ii) to disentangle the impact of context generalization vs. lack of motivation vs. novelty fear and (iii) to assess the therapeutic value of benzodiazepines and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Specific conditioned avoidance to shock-paired odor turned into generalized avoidance after 28 days of fear incubation. Combination of habituation to the novel environment and extinction of contextual fear abolished both generalized and specific avoidance behavior. Chronic fluoxetine treatment partially reversed the phenotype, whereas acute treatment with diazepam did not. Our animal model may help understanding the mechanisms underlying psychological and biological mechanisms of PTSD for the benefit of developing pharmacotherapeutic strategies, which specifically address generalized avoidance.", 
    "137": "Illicit drugs and metabolites have been recognized recently as a group of emerging contaminants of concern, as a consequence of their high volumes of use and production. Drug residue levels in the aquatic environment have also been pointed out as good indicators of illicit drug abuse. The present work assesses for the first time drug abuse in a penal complex from the levels of different drug residues measured in the prison sewage waters and evaluates the suitability of this approach to track and control illicit drug usage in such facilities. The presence of various drugs of abuse and metabolites in sewage waters from a penal complex was determined by an analytical method based on on-line solid phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Levels of consumption indicators measured in this water were used to back-calculate drugs usage in the penal complex. Daily use was observed for methadone (average of 156 doses/day/1000 inh), alprazolam (129 doses/day/1000 inh), ephedrine (46 doses/day/1000 inh), cannabis (33 doses/day/1000 inh.) and cocaine (3 doses/day/1000 inh). Sporadic consumption was observed for heroin, amphetamine, methamphetamine, and ecstasy. In spite of the fact that this and other sewage epidemiological approaches described may suffer from bias that still need to be investigated and refined, it provides near \"real-time\" information on collective drug use in an anonymous way and constitutes a very useful, economic and fast tool to evaluate the efficiency of measures adopted to control and track drug abuse in this type of facilities (or any other provided that has a STP associated or an accessible collector system).",

    "143": "Zolpidem, a widely used hypnotic drug which acts through benzodiazepine binding sites, is a positive allosteric modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) action with preferential affinity for GABA(A) receptors containing alpha1 subunit. The pharmacological profile of zolpidem is different from that of classical benzodiazepines. The aim of this study was to find out whether zolpidem treatment triggers adaptive changes in the recombinant alpha1 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors other than those observed following treatment with classical benzodiazepine-diazepam. Radioligand binding studies showed that 2-day exposure of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably expressing recombinant alpha1beta2gamma2s GABA(A) receptors to zolpidem (10 muM) up-regulated the maximum number (B (max)) of [(3)H]flunitrazepam, [(3)H]muscimol, and [(3)H]t-butylbicycloorthobenzoate ([(3)H]TBOB) binding sites without changing their affinity (K (d)), suggesting an increase in total GABA(A) receptor number. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated increased levels of alpha1 subunit mRNA, while Western blot demonstrated up-regulated gamma2 subunit proteins, suggesting that zolpidem induced de novo synthesis of receptors proteins, at both the transcriptional and translational levels. GABA-induced potentiation of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding to membranes obtained from zolpidem-treated cells was markedly reduced, indicating allosteric uncoupling between GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites. The number of benzodiazepine and convulsant binding sites as well as the functional coupling between GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites normalized in 24 h following discontinuation of zolpidem treatment. The results of our in vitro studies suggest that a 2-day exposure of recombinant alpha1 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors stably transfected in HEK 293 cells to zolpidem induces adaptive changes in this selective GABA(A) receptor subtype, which are not substantially different from those obtained after prolonged exposure of cells to high concentrations of diazepam.",

However, concerns over efficacy and safety during prolonged administration are a limiting factor for use in this patient population. A literature review was conducted to assess the clinical evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine for longer than 24 hours. A total of 11 studies were identified. Of these trials, 6 included adult patients and 5 included pediatric patients. Of the 6 adult trials, 3 comparative trials demonstrated a similar efficacy with benzodiazepines (i.e., midazolam and lorazepam) or propofol, with a reduction in the incidence of delirium and coma associated with dexmedetomidine. In noncomparative trials, dexmedetomidine was efficacious in achieving sedation goals with only mild adverse effects. In the 5 pediatric trials evaluated, efficacy to achieve a target sedation scale score could not be assessed, as most studies did not use validated sedation scales to measure goal sedation. Alternatively, the safety of dexmedetomidine has been demonstrated throughout an extended duration of use. In all of the studies evaluated, dexmedetomidine was associated with bradycardia; however, there were no reports of withdrawal effects, including rebound tachycardia and hypertension, upon discontinuation of dexmedetomidine infusion.",

Studies have shown that the risk of sudden cardiac death is threefold higher among patients treated with APs. To investigate the presence of APs in postmortem cases, a liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS method was developed using only 0.1 ml of blood sample with 10 microl of internal standard (IS) (haloperidol-d(4), 1 microg/ml). After the addition of 0.2 ml of Trizma buffer, the blood sample was extracted using liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) with 1 ml of 1-chlorobutane for 5 min on a shaker at 1500 rpm. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 1 min, the separated solvent layer was transferred to an autosampler vial and evaporated to dryness under N(2). The residue was reconstituted in 0.05 ml acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid, vortexed for 30 s and an additional 0.45 ml of 50 mmol/l ammonium formate pH 3.5 was added and the sample vortexed; 0.1 ml of the final extract was injected into a Shimadzu Prominence HPLC system, with detection of drugs achieved using an Applied Biosystems 3200 Q-TRAP LC-MS/MS system equipped with a Turbo V ion source [electron spray ionization (ESI), multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode]. The method has been validated according to international guidelines and was found to be selective for all tested compounds. Calibration was satisfactory for all drugs, except olanzapine, from subtherapeutic to toxic concentrations. The lower limits of quantifications (LLOQs) corresponded to the lowest concentrations used for the calibration curves. With the exception of the lowest concentrations of bromperidol, buspirone and perphenazine, accuracy data were within the acceptance interval of +/- 15% (+/- 20% at LLOQ) of the nominal values for all drugs. The method has been proven to be useful for the routine analysis of APs in postmortem blood samples.",

Unfortunately, there are limited data regarding the prevalence and risk factors of delirium in critically ill burn patients. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of delirium in ventilated burn patients, using validated instruments, and to identify its risk factors. Adult ventilated burn patients at two tertiary centers were prospectively evaluated for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method in the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) for 30 days or until intensive care unit discharge. Patients with neurologic injuries, severe dementia, and those not expected to survive >24 hours were excluded. Markov logistic regression was used to identify the risk factors of delirium, adjusting for clinically relevant covariates. The 82 ventilated burn patients had a median (interquartile range) age of 48 (38-62) years, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores 27 (21-30), and percent burns of 20 (7-32). Prevalence of delirium was 77% with a median duration of 3 (1-6) days. Exposure to benzodiazepines was an independent risk factor for the development of delirium (odds ratio: 6.8 [confidence interval: 3.1-15], P < .001), whereas exposure to both intravenous opiates (0.5 [0.4-0.6], P < .001) and methadone (0.7 [0.5-0.9], P = .02) was associated with a lower risk of delirium. In conclusion, delirium occurred at least once in approximately 80% of ventilated burn patients. Exposure to benzodiazepines was an independent risk factor for delirium, whereas opiates and methadone reduced the risk of developing delirium, possibly through reduction of pain in these patients.", 
    "159": "The basolateral amygdala is a nodal structure within a distributed and interconnected network that regulates anxiety states and anxiety-related behavior. Administration of multiple anxiogenic drugs increases cellular responses (i.e., increases c-Fos expression) in a subregion of the basolateral amygdala, but the neurochemical phenotypes of these cells are not known. The basolateral amygdala contains glutamatergic projection neurons and several populations of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid-synthesizing (GABAergic) interneurons, including a population of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GABAergic interneurons that co-express the excitatory 5-HT(2A) receptor. The role for these PV-expressing GABAergic interneurons in anxiety-states is unclear. In this experiment we examined the effects of multiple anxiogenic drugs including the 5-HT(2C/2A) receptor agonist m-chlorophenyl piperazine (mCPP), the adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine, the \u03b1(2)-adrenoreceptor antagonist yohimbine and the partial inverse agonist at the benzodiazepine allosteric site on the GABA(A) receptor, N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG-7142), on c-Fos expression in PV-immunoreactive (PV-ir) interneurons in subdivisions of the basolateral amygdala. All drugs with the exception of mCPP increased c-Fos expression in PV-ir neurons in the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, anterior part (BLA). The numbers of c-Fos-immunoreactive (c-Fos-ir)/PV-ir GABAergic interneurons in the BLA were positively correlated with the numbers of c-Fos-ir serotonergic neurons in the mid-rostrocaudal dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) and with a measure of anxiety-related behavior. All four drugs increased c-Fos expression in non-PV-ir cells in most of the subdivisions of the basolateral amygdala that were sampled, compared with vehicle-injected controls. Together, these data suggest that the PV/5-HT(2A) receptor expressing GABAergic interneurons in the basolateral amygdala are part of a DR-basolateral amygdala neuronal circuit modulating anxiety-states and anxiety-related behavior.",

This plant extract induced anxiolytic-like actions similar to those induced by diazepam in the avoidance exploratory behavior paradigm. Its significant activity was shown at doses from 1.62 to 6.25 mg/kg. It also enhanced pentobarbital-induced hypnosis time, and at high doses produced motor coordination impairment. The benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor binding, evaluated by in vitro autoradiography following a single administration of R. mucosa, revealed that this plant extract reduced BDZ binding in the hippocampus (29%), amygdala (26%), and temporal cortex of mice (36%).

CBR is found exclusively in the central nervous system on the membranes of neurons and is coupled with the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid receptor/chloride channel (3). In contrast, PBR is a mitochondrial protein found in brain and peripheral tissues (adrenal gland, heart, lung, kidney, and testis) (4). The brain has lower levels of PBR than do peripheral tissues, while both glial cells and macrophages contain high levels of PBR (5-7). Increased PBR expression after brain injury or neuroinflammation is associated with microglial activation, such as occurs with the neuronal damage that accompanies several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy.

The GABA receptors (GABAR) comprise several different pharmacological subtypes depending on the type of subunits constituting the receptor complex, and GABA mediates its effects primarily through the GABAA receptors (3). Also, individuals with the Angleman syndrome (AS) have a neurodevelopmental disorder that results in severe mental retardation, delayed motor development, and epilepsy (4). It has been shown that surviving gabrag3-knockout mice are epileptic and have a phenotype that is similar to AS patients, indicating that the GABR\u03b23 gene in humans could have a role in the development of AS (5). Interestingly, genes coding for the various GABAR subunits (\u03b23, \u03b15, and \u03b33) are located within the same 15q11-q13 region of the human chromosome that is believed to have a function in the development of AS (5, 6), suggesting that the GABAR\u03b23 gene may have a role in the development of AS in humans. In addition, the GABAAknockout mice were shown to have reduced levels of the GABAA receptor. A benzodiazepine (BDZ) site antagonist labeled with radioactive carbon ([(11)C]), ethyl 8-fluoro-5-[(11)C]methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate ([(11)C]flumazenil ([(11)C]FMZ)), which has a high affinity for the GABAA receptors, has been used widely with positron emission tomography (PET) for the investigation of the these receptors (7).

PBR is mainly located in the glial cells of the brain, and PBR expression in vivo was increased in microglia activated by brain injury (1). The increase of PBR density has thus been used as an indicator of neuronal damage and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (1). PBR has been studied with in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) using [(11)C]PK11195. However, the relatively low uptake of [(11)C]PK11195 into the brain limited its wide application. To characterize PBR precisely using a PET ligand with improved behaviors compared to [(11)C]PK11195, [(11)C]DAA1106 (2) and [(18)F]FEDAA1106 (3) were developed for PBR imaging in the brain.

The central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) is found exclusively in the central nervous system on the membranes of neurons and is coupled to the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid receptor/chloride channel (2). The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), first thought to be a subtype of the CBR, was later identified as a separate class of receptor with its own structure, physiologic functions, and location on the outer membrane of the mitochondria (3). The PBR structure consists of a trimeric complex with an adenine nucleotide carrier and a voltage-dependent anion that form the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (3). Although it has been shown to be involved in numerous biological processes, the physiologic role of the PBR is still unclear (4). PBR is abundant in peripheral organs such as the kidneys, lungs, and heart, whereas lower levels are found in the brain (5). A significant increase in PBR expression after neural injury or inflammation (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy) has been observed and has been associated with microglial activation (6, 7).

N-(5-Fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-N-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl-5-methoxybenzyl)acetamide ([(18)F]FEDAA1106) and [(11)C]DAA1106 have been developed as potential PET ligands with highly selective and specific binding to PBRs. 6-Chloro-2-(4'-iodophenyl)-3-(N,N-diethyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-acetamide (CLINDE), which has an imidazopyridine-3-acetamide structure, has also been shown to have high affinity for PBRs (10, 11). 6-Chloro-2-(4'-[(123)I]iodophenyl)-3-(N,N-diethyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-acetamide ([(123)I]CLINDE) has been developed for single-photon emission computed tomography imaging of PBRs in the brain.", 
    "186": "Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, are potent psychoactive drugs used for their sedative and anxiolytic properties (1, 2). There are two types of benzodiazepine receptors, which have been designated as the central and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. The central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) is found exclusively in the central nervous system on the membranes of neurons and is coupled to the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid receptor/chloride channel (3). In contrast, the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is a mitochondrial protein found in brain and peripheral tissues (adrenal gland, heart, lung, kidney, and testis) (4). The brain has lower levels of PBRs than do the peripheral tissues. Both glial cells and macrophages contain high levels of PBRs (5-7). Increased PBR expression after brain injury or neuroinflammation is associated with microglial activation, such as occurs with the neuronal damage accompanying several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. PBRs have been studied in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET) using [(11)C]PK11195, an isoquinoline carboxamide with specific PBR-antagonistic activity. [(11)C]PK11195 is being developed as a PET agent for non-invasive studies of microglia and macrophage activation in the brain, lung, and heart. However, accumulation of this tracer in the brain is limited. N-(2,5-Dimethoxybenzyl)-N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide (DAA1106) was found to be a selective agonist for studying PBRs in the central nervous system (8, 9). DAA1106 was reported to have a higher affinity for PBRs in mitochondrial fractions of rat and monkey brains than did PK11195 (8, 9). Therefore, both tracers are able to cross the normal cell membrane to reach the mitochondrial receptor sites. [(11)C]DAA1106 has been studied as a PET agent for the non-invasive study of microglia and macrophage activation in the brain. [(11)C]DAA1106 binding was 3-fold higher than [(11)C]PK11195 binding in the monkey occipital cortex (9). N-(5-Fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-N-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl-5-methoxybenzyl)acetamide ([(18)F]FEDAA1106), a fluoroethyl analog of DA1106, is being developed as a potential PET ligand with highly selective and specific binding to PBR.",

    "188": "Determinants of antipsychotic selection and response include parameters of the primary disorder, psychiatric and physical comorbidities, past treatment effects, patient preferences, availability and acceptability of different treatments and formulations, as well as expected efficacy and safety. In the absence of consistent and sufficiently large efficacy differences among antipsychotics (except for clozapine in refractory patients), and in view of a greater focus on physical health, functional outcomes and quality of life, relatively more predictable differences in adverse events have become an important management consideration. Treatments are often selected because of a relatively lower propensity for extrapyramidal and sexual side effects, sedation, and, especially, the reduced development of cardiometabolic risk states and disorders. In this context, differences in receptor binding affinity, intrinsic activity and in the half life of antipsychotics are crucial to adopt adequate dosing and switching strategies. Dopamine rebound phenomena can occur when the level of dopamine blockade is not kept relatively constant during the switch process. This can happen when the new antipsychotic is underdosed or not fully absorbed, the switch is too abrupt from an antipsychotic with a short half life to one with a much longer half life, or when a dopamine antagonist is switched too fast to an antipsychotic with markedly less dopamine affinity or to a partial dopamine agonist. Intra-switch destabilization can also occur when changing too quickly from antipsychotics with strong histaminergic and/or cholinergic blockade to ones with lower affinity to these receptors. Overlapping \"plateau\" switch strategies and transient co-treatment with calming medications, such as benzodiazepines, have emerged as potential solutions to these rebound phenomena that can complicate the early switch period. To optimize outcomes, antipsychotic treatment should be pharmacologically informed and measurement based, combining both acute and long-term management goals and balancing efficacy and adverse effect considerations.", 
    "189": "Seizures rapidly become self-sustaining and pharmacoresistant to benzodiazepines during status epilepticus (SE). A decrease in the number of postsynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptors with SE causes a loss of synaptic inhibition, whereas increases in postsynaptic glutamatergic receptors further upset the balance between excitation and inhibition. Although extracellular GABA levels may increase during SE and contribute to postsynaptic GABA(A) receptor desensitization, other pathways involving glutamatergic activation ultimately may be responsible for the persistent down-regulation of postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors and erosion of synaptic inhibition."
