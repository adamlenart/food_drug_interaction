Differences between the healthy and the diseased as to the number of given factors were established by means of the Lawly test. Up to 6 factors were determined for patients, up to 3 for the healthy. On medication, the number of factors rose in the delta and beta bands, remaining unchanged in the alpha band dropping the theta band. The patients manifested a sort of interindividual uniformity and intraindividual simplification. Except for different sites of pathological foci, the patients' EEG recordings were more like each other than those of healthy subjects. The latter might have undergone a similar process on medication. This enabled to establish more factors in the patients, moreover in such a way as to expose some general laws of cortical electric activity, such as unified cortical activity despite its various facets, hemispheral specificity, and finally also a relative autonomy of the frontal lobes.", 
    "1": "The plasma concentration of phenobarbital given as anticonvulsive treatment in the newborn period has been followed in 18 infants. With constant daily doses, the drug accummulated for at least 5 days. After intramuscular injection of a single dose, 90% of the peak concentration was reached within 4 hours in 8 of the 10 infants. The peak concentration (in mug/ml) approximately equalled 1.3 x the dose (in mg/kg). Absorption after oral administration was less reliable. In 12 of the infants the clinical course allowed attempts to evaluate the anticonvulsive effect of phenobarbital. In 4 cases the convulsions continued. In those 8 infants where phenobarbital seemed to be effective, the approximate range of phenobarbital concentration when convulsions ceased was 12-30 mug/ml. Phenobarbital half-life ranged between 59 and 182 hours. In some infants the rate of phenobarbital disappearance from the plasma varied considerably from day to day. The pathological conditions causing seizures probably influence the distribution, metabolism and excretion of the drug. For the often seriously ill infants with convulsions it is therefore difficult to construct rational maintenance dose schedules, and optimal dosage must be based on repeated determinations of the plasma concentration.", 
    "2": "In open-chest dog preparations i.v. administration of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide caused increases in coronary blood flow and cardiac output while reducing blood pressure, heart rate, and myocardial contractile force. The decrease in force was independent of the alteration in coronary flow. Arterial--coronary sinus oxygen difference narrowed and myocardial oxygen consumption decreased. These data show that both diazepam and chlordiazepoxide exert an oxygen conserving action along with an increase in myocardial oxygen delivery and suggest that these drugs may be of benefit to the patient with coronary insufficiency by a direct effect on the cardiovascular system as well as through CNS-mediated antianxiety effects.", 
    "3": "To suppress the hyperglycemic effect of malathion in rats, a smaller amount of atropine was required when the drug was injected by intraventricular (i. vent.) than s.c. Pentobarbital, but not diazepam, blocked the hyperglycemic response. The results suggest that central accumulation of acetylcholine was the mediator of the response. Since hyperglycemia was not abolished by adrenalectomy and/or hypophysectomy, a hypothesis is presented to explain how central accumulation of acetylcholine might cause hyperglycemia.", 
    "4": "Intravenous diazepam will not significantly suppress gastric secretion within the first hour after \"maximal\" stimulation with pentagastrin. In the second and third hours, however, gastric secretion is significantly diminished. Further suppression after pentagastrin and diazepam is possible in each of the three post-stimulation hours by the simultaneous administration of atropine. Diazepam does not suppress the seven-hour basal nocturnal gastric secretion during sleep. This suggests that diazepam acts during wakefulness by inhibition of secretory stimuli arising centrally, thus providing a rationale for use of this drug in patients with peptic ulcer in whom stress may be a factor in the pathogenesis.", 
    "5": "The effects of chlordiazepoxide-hydrochloride (CDZ) on the isolated perfused rat liver were examined. CDZ administration decreased bile flow, biliary excretion of sulfobromophthalein (BSP) and hepatic uptake of BSP. The addition of CDZ to the perfusate of livers obtained from phenobarbital (Pb) pretreated rats led to 50% greater reductions in bile flow, concentration of BSP in bile and hepatic uptake of BSP. The adverse effects of CDZ on BSP excretion per g liver, however, did not appear to be enhanced by Pb pretreatment. The complex nature of the interrelationship of the effects of Pb and of CDZ on the control liver prevented differentiation of the role of CDZ from that of a metabolite on the adverse effect on liver function.", 
    "6": "Pigeons obtained food by making four responses on three keys in a specified sequence, e.g., left, right, center, right. Under the \"tandem-learning\" condition, all three keys were the same color throughout the response sequence, and the sequence was changed from session to session. After total errors per session (overall accuracy) and within-session error reduction (learning) had stabilized, the effects of varying doses phenobarbital and chlordiazepoxide were assessed. For comparison, the drug tests were also conducted under a \"tandem-performance\" condition, in which the response sequence was the same from session to session, and under corresponding \"chain-learning\" and \"chain-performance\" conditions, where different colored keylights were associated with the response sequence. Under all four baseline conditions, the largest dose of each drug impaired overall accuracy. Under the two learning conditions, the error rate decreased across trials within each session, but the degree of negative acceleration was less in the drug sessions than in the control sessions. In contrast, under the two performance conditions, the error rate was relatively constant across trials, but was higher in the drug sessions than in the control sessions. Of the four baselines, the chain-learning condition was the most sensitive to the drug effects.", 
    "7": "The central nervous system and concurrent cardiovascular effects of bupivacaine infusion were studied in cats. It was possible to block cortical E.E.G. desynchronization resulting from a sensory stimulus with bupivacaine. The earliest subcortical change that occurred was rhythmic activity in the amygdala and later in the hippocampus. Occasionally, this activity appeared simultaneously in both these sites. Diazepam pretreatment raised the seizure threshold of bupivacaine. Diazepam was also effective in terminating established seizure activity resulting from bupivacaine. All animals pretreated with diazepam (Valium) or diazepam solvent developed cardiac dysrhythmias durind bupivacaine infusion. The possible clinical significance of the interaction of bupivacaine and diazepam solvent is considered.", 
    "8": "Sixty-three volunteer patients participated in an investigation disigned to evaluate memory of the surgical experinece with three different methods of balanced nitrous oxide-curare anaesthesia. Two of the methods (Liverpool and Roosevelt protocols) used thiopentone for induction but did not utilize any neuroleptic drug, while the third (Diazepam protocol) used the tranquilizer diazepam in combination with morphine for both premedication and induction. In general, the results suggest that all three variations are successful in producing anaesthesia and that patients have no recall of the major portion of the surgical procedure. The major differences among the groups were exhibited in the post-operative periods. These findings suggest that diazepam affects the emotional quality associated with memory and thus aids the patients by reducing both the incidence of noxious psychological reactions and the possibility of severe emotional trauma. Finally, the findings also suggest the importance of using a narcotic analgesic as part of nitrous oxide-curare anaesthesia.", 
    "9": "The administration of Na benzoate to grown and suckling Gunn rats in single doses of 7 and 35 mg/kg failed to significantly alter serum bilirubin concentrations. These doses are comparable to quantities of Na benzoate contained in injectable diazepam used therapeutically for newborn infants. Repeated doses of 7 mg/kg in the grown rat showed no effect, as well. A single dose of 100 or 200 mg/kg of Na benzoate and repeated doses of 35 mg/kg resulted in depressed serum bilirubin concentrations. The higher concentrations of Na benzoate, however, greatly exceed amounts contained in doses of diazepam recommended for clinical use in the human neonate. The data suggest that the use of injectable diazepam, in appropriate quantities, poses no hazard to the newborn infant in terms of bilirubin toxicity. The greater affinity for bilirubin of human albumin, than that of rat albumin, may further minimize the risk.", 
    "10": "Diazepam (DZ) placental transfer in pregnant women at term, following single or repeated drug administration by various routes, was evaluated. DZ and its metabolite N-demethyldiazepam (NDZ) were constantly present in umbilical cord plasma at concentrations comparable to the mother's shortly after drug administration. N-methyloxazepam (MOX) was detected in cord plasma only in a limited number of cases following chronic DZ treatment. Postmortem analysis of fetal tissue concentrations showed accumulation of NDZ in heart and lungs. Differences in NDZ concentrations between venous cord (VC) and arterial cord (AC) plasms suggest metabolic degradation of DZ in the fetus. The DZ apparent plasma half-life in the newborn was found to be longer (31 plus or minus 2 hr) than previously observed in infants and children. The low drug clearance appears to be linked to reduced urinary excretion of hydroxylated metabolites, suggesting limited capability to dispose of DZ in the newborn.", 
    "11": "The author reports on four patients, all women, who developed conjunctival hypersensitivity during diazepam treatment. This hypersensitivity is self-limited after diazepam treatment is discontinued. The author suggests that conjunctival hypersensitivity could be mistakenly attributed to contact lens irritation rather than to diazepam.", 
    "12": "Electron-microscopical exammination of a liver biopsy from a young female drug addict with clinically relapsing serum hepatitis revealed virus-like particles free in the liver cell cytoplasm. In addition, there was intracellular cholestasis, and numerous clefts were found in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, presumably caused by the presence of cholesterol crystals which were dissolved during the processing of the tissue. Such clefts have earlier been reported in liver cells in patients with cholestasis and hypercholesterolemia, but not in patients with viral hepatitis and a normal serum cholesterol concentration.", 
    "13": "In locally anesthetized, paralyzed cats with bilateral conjugated estrogen (CE)-induced foci in sensory motor cortex, electrographic activity was characterized by 2 to 3 Hz spike and slow wave discharge. Commonly used anti-petit mal drugs (esthosuximide, trimethadione, acetazolamide and diazepam) all reduced CE-induced spike wave activity while diphenylhydantoin converted such activity into 9 to 12 Hz polyspike bursts separated by periods of interictal silence. Correlation appears to exist, therefore, between the ability of the drug to reduce CE-induced spike wave activity and its clinical utility in petit mal epilepsy. In addition to the above compounds, five drugs of less proven utility were evaluated. Of these, two benzodiazepine derivatives (clonazepam and clorazepate) were found to exert a potent and prolonged depressant action on CE-induced activity. The relation of CE to clinical petit mal epilepsy and the potential usefulness of CE as a laboratory model for the evaluation of anti-petit mal drugs are discussed.", 
    "14": "It has been suggested that depression is a disease of cholinergic dominance and since the beta-adrenergic blocking drug propranolol hydrochloride can cause depression, there arises the possibility that a beta-adrenergic stimulant could benefit the condition. For ethical reasons, the adrenergic drug metaproterenol sulfate was combined with chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and compared to placebo and chlordiazepoxide in a formal double-blind trial. However, the results did not show any advantage for the addition of metaproterenol either in respect of enhanced antidepressant effect or a reduced incidence, nature, or severity of side-effects.", 
    "15": "This report is an example of tumor metastasis to the temporomandibular joint and its effect on pain, restriction of jaw movement, and the subsequent inability of the patient to function normally. Neoplasm is not the usual etiology of myofascial pain dysfunctionsyndrome and the muscle sparm component of this patient's jaw dysfunction was emphasizedby the relief of symptoms from the use of symptomatic reversible type therapy (tranquilizer, muscle relaxant, and heat). There was an overlay of stress-tension factors in this case history that contributed to the muscle spasm symptoms of the patient. There canbe other etiological factors in jaw dysfunction associated with TMJ pathology such asdevelopmental anomalies, trauma, arthritis, and neoplasm, but as a group they comprise only about 5% of TMJ dysfunction problems (D.M. Laskin, personal communication).", 
    "16": "The therapeutic efficacy of orally administered clonazepam has been evaluated in 32 epileptic patients, with substantial improvement in 22. The drug is active in all types of seizures, particularly in myoclonus, petit mal absences, and partial complex epilepsy; it seems the drug of choice in generalized infantile organic epilepsy, although the treatment of these patients is still unsatisfactory. In some patients, the drug seemed less effective after months of therapy. Drowsiness is the main side effect.", 
    "17": "After a preliminary encouraging trial of mepiprazol (EMD 16.923) on 8 patients, a double-blind cross-over study of mepiprazol and diazepam was performed in order to compare their effect in the treatment of neurotic disorders, particularly on various forms of anxiety.", 
    "18": "The study involved 34 surgical patients in whom anaesthesia was induced by the intravenous injection of an average dose of 2.5 mg of flunitrazepam (Rohypnol or Ro-5-4200). The induction of anaesthetic sleep was obtained in 50 to 60 seconds and the duration of the anaesthetic effect 15 to 20 minutes. The patients continued to show hypnosedative effects for several hours postoperatively. The cardiovascular parameters studied - radial BP, ECG and pulmonary arterial pressure - were recorded directly whilst cardiac output was measured by thermodilution using a Swan-Ganz catheter. The decrease in systolic and diastolic pressures in relation to pre-anaesthetic values was 21 p. 100 and 16 p. 100 respectively, whilst pulmonary artery pressure fell by 13 p. 100. Cardiac output fell in a non-significant fashion and the same applied to systolic ejection volume for a given constant heart rate. There was a significant (18 p. 100) decrease in total peripheral resistance but alterations in central venous pressure were negligeable. The decrease in peripheral vascular and pulmonary artery resistances suggest that the product has a peripheral circulatory action and it is possible to correct the alterations seen.", 
    "19": "Female C57BL/6J mice fed diets containing diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, oxazepam, prazepam, flurazepam, or nitrazepam exhibited significant decreases in the frequency of vaginal estrus.", 
    "20": "In mice, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and flurazepam reduced 5-HT synthesis and metabolism in the teldiencephalon following an i.v. injection of 3H-tryptophan. Only diazepam produced a significant effect in the brainstem. The steady state level of brain 5-HT or of tryptophan was not altered by any of the drugs. Chlordiazepoxide and diazepam, but not flurazepam, decreased the rate of norepinephrine loss from the brain following inhibition of synthesis with alpha-methyltyrosine.", 
    "21": "Thirty-five human volunteers and eight Rhesus monkeys were studied with standard gastrooesophageal manometric techniqes and their reflux status was evaluated witha pH probe placed in the lower oesophagus. morphine sulphate, pethidine hydrochloride, or idazepam was given intravenously until drowsiness was induced. The manometric and pH studies were repeated. All three drugs decreased the lower oesophageal high pressure zone and increased the probability of relux in both monkeys and man. Thes findings are relevant in the preparation of patients for surgery since gastrooesophageal reflux and pulmonary aspiration may be a problen in the pre-and postoperative phases.", 
    "22": "Senegalese baboons (Papio papio), with a natural syndrome of photosensitive epilepsy, consistently show generalized myoclonic jerks if stimulated stroboscopically at hourly intervals, two to eight hours after the intravenous administration of allylglycine, 200 mg/kg. This provides a model for testing the acute antiepileptic effects of established or new drugs. The relationship between concentration of drug, antiepileptic action, and acute neurological toxic effects can be studied. Pnehobarbital (15 mg/kg) and diazepam (0;5 to 1.5 mg/kg) were highly effective in the absence of signs of toxic reaction (plasma levels: phenobarbital sodium, 0.7 to 1.7 mg/100 ml; diazepam, greater than 0.5 mug/ml). After administration of carbamazepine (30 to 40 mg/kg) and diphenylhydantoin sodium (40 to 50 mg/kg), antiepileptic action was seen, but was accompanied by severe toxic signs (nystagmus and ataxia). Sulthiame (20 to 125 mg/kg) and ethosuximide (50 to 100 mg/kg) had little antiepileptic activity and no acute toxic effects. This primate model may aid the identification of new drugs that are active against grand mal seizures and status epilepticus.", 
    "23": "Arterial blood gases were not significantly altered by 0.15 mg/kg intravenous dose of diazepam in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. The PalphaO-2 was significantly reduced and the P-alphaCO-2 increased after administration of 1.5 mg/kg meperidine intravenously and the combination of 1.5 mg/kg meperidine with 0.15 mg/kg diazepam. Diazepam did not, however, significantly increase the ventilatory depression induced by meperidine. Therefore, 0.15 mg/kg diazepam intravenously causes no ventilatory depression by meperidine in patients with chronic obstructive lung diseases.", 
    "24": "Triazolam, 0.4 and 0.8 mg, flurazepam, 15 and 30 mg, and placebo were compared in a double-blind, randomized 5-night crossover study in 25 inpatient insomniacs. These patients all complained difficulty falling asleep; all said they usually slept less than 5 hr a nigh and woke up too early in the morning. Results of the patients' global evaluation of the medications shows that all of the treatments were rated significantly higher than placebo, with the exception of triazolam, 0.4 mg, which was not significantly different from flurazepam, 15 or 30 mg, or from placebo. In subjective evaluation of sleep onset, only triazolam, 0.4 and 0.8 mg, was rated faster than placebo. All 4 active medications increased duration of sleep. Triazolam, 0.8 mg, and flurazepam, 30 mg, were rated as providing deeper sleep than placebo while all treatments except flurazepam, 15 mg, decreased the number of awakenings below that on placebo. A significant dose-response curve was obtained with triazolam and flurazepam for some of the parameters. Very few adverse effects were reported. One patient reported feeling groggy and drowsy on 0.4 mg triazolam while 2 reported nightmares on placebo.", 
    "25": "Current methods permit frequent, accurate serum anticonvulsant drug concentration measurements and continuous, 24-hour electroencephalographic recording with minimal environmental restriction. These techniques were used to perform longitudinal, 24-hour recordings of electroencephalographic paroxysmal activity and sleep-wake state concurrently with frequent measurements of serum anticonvulsant drug concentrations in two patients with poorly controlled convulsions. Drug administration was designed with the intent of producing high serum concentrations at times of maximum electroencephalographic paroxysmal activity. The suppression of clinical seizures coincided with decreased numbers of paroxysmal bursts in the electroencephalogram and increased serum anticonvulsant drug concentration.", 
    "26": "Pairs of rats were placed in an apparatus where their sole food source hung over an electrified grid. The current was shut off only while one rat remained on a platform out of reach of the food, thus allowing his partner to eat. Mastery of the process of taking turns at eating required about 10 daily sessions. Injection of imipramine or chlordiazepoxide a few minutes after each feeding session prevented the development of this cooperative behavior. Drug injection 3 hrs after each session had no effect. Suppression of REM sleep during the first 3 hrs after training was considered the most likely mechanism of the drug-induced impairment.", 
    "27": "Despite the use of barbiturates, phenytoin sodium and diazepam given intravenously, status epilepticus continued in the three cases described until chlormethizaole (Heminevrin) was administered, when rapid resolution of the status occurred.", 
    "28": "The effect of emotional stress on the pituitary-adrenocortical system in the rat was studied. Hall's open field apparatus was used to give a novel stimulus, a mild and purely not show any significant differences among all the experimental groups. Psychological stimulus produced by a novel environment. Animals were male albino rats of the Wistar-strain, bred in groups and weighing about 250 gm. They were taken out of their home cage and placed gently in the centre of an open field, a novel environment. After a certain period of time, they were returned to the cage and decapitated. Plasma corticosterone was determined by the fluorometric method of van der Vies. The results were as follows: 1. When the animals were exposed to the novel stimulus for 3 min., plasma corticosterone showed a definite increase 15 min. after the end of the stimulus, reached a maximal level at 30 min. and returned to the resting level at 60 min. 2. When the duration of the stimulus, i.e. time spent in the open field, was changed, a 15min.-stay in the field gave the maximal rise of plasma corticosterone and 30, 45, 60min.-stays maintained the plateau level. When the 3 min. open field test was repeated every day, the plasma coritcosterone response was definite in the first trial, but was suppressed at the second and absent at the third and fifth episodes. The results indicate that the acquisition of adaptation to a novel stimulus depends upon the repetition, but not upon the duration of stimulus. 3. Plasma corticosterone responded in the same manner as in the standard open field test, even when olfactory, visual and special factor were changed. This indicates that no special cue (s) is responsible for the adrenocortical response to a novel stimulus. 4. The pretreatment of the animals with tranquilizers such as chloropromazine and diazepam showed no inhibitory effect on the plasma corticosterone response to novel stimulus.", 
    "29": "A method is described for the determination C3-hydroxylated benzodiazepine glucuronides in biological samples. Oxazepam and lorazepam glucuronides are measured as methyl esters and trimethylsilyl derivates by a gas chromatographic procedure. The applicability of the method has been tested on the urine of rats, guinea pigs, rabbits and man, receiving oxazepam orally. Oxazepam glucuronide was not found in rat urine but it was present in the urine of rabbits (5.7% of the administered dose), guinea pigs (9.5%) and man (13.4-26.9%).", 
    "30": "The addition of intravenous diazepam to other, routinely employed preoperative medications prior to intraocular surgical procedures was evaluated to determine if symptoms of extreme apprehension and anxiety could be alleviated and the necessity to resort to general anesthesia reduced. It was observed that patients who were given intravenous diazepam preoperatively sleep or were drowsy during the procedure, tolerated the surgery uneventfully and did not manifest symptoms of apprehension. Also, they could be aroused without difficulty after the procedure and were responsive to questioning and routine aftercare. The only adverse reaction, difficulty in breathing because of airway obstruction due to the tongue falling backward into the throat as a result of the light anesthesia employed, can be easily handled by lifting the chin upward or, if necessary, the use of an airway.", 
    "31": "In a fatal case of self-poisoning with lithium carbonate there was a progressive increase in serum lithium concentration for 48 hours after ingestion of the overdose. It is suggested that the continuous increase in serum lithium concentration reflects prolonged absorption of lithium from relatively insoluble aggregates of lithium carbonate in the gastrointestinal tract. In this case there was an interval of 45 hours between ingestion of the overdose and the onset of central nervous system depression. Simultaneous peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis were effective in rapidly reducing the serum lithium concentration but there was little concomitant change in the patient's level of consciousness. The terminal event was a respiratory complication of the comatose state.", 
    "32": "Clonazepam (CNP) and its principal metabolite in plasma, 7-amino-CNP (ACNP), have been investigated in a prospective study of 27 newly diagnosed epileptics and correlated with specified side-effects. At a daily dose of 6 mg, the average plasma levels of both substances were about 50ng/ml, and individual values ranged from 30 to about 80 ng/ml. There was a linear correlation between changes in dose and the resulting plasma levels, which indicates first order elimination kinetics. Side-effects were frequent, but neither their severity nor their occurrence could be related to plasma levels or to the rate of increase in plasma concentration of the drug. Three out of five patients who developed serious dysphoria had significantly high CNP levels. The concentration of ACNP was considerably increased in four patients who subsequently suffered from withdrawal symptoms. Drug interaction with diphenylhydantoin, i.e. decreased CNP level, was observed in all five patients who received both compounds. In general it is not yet possible to define an upper limit for the plasma levels of CNP and ACNP at which toxicity occurs. In patients treated with conventional doses of CNP, measurement of plasma concentration is not required, except in special circumstances, because of the lack of correlation between plasma level and side-effects.", 
    "33": "In a follow-up study of 50,282 pregnancies (lasting at least five lunar months) and the offspring, malformations identified before the first birthday, or at death before the fourth birthday, were identified in 3248 children (6.5 per cent). A total of 1870 children exposed in utero to meprobamate or chlordiazepoxide were compared with 48,412 children who were not. No significant differences were found either overall or in specific outcomes; rates were also similar when exposures occurred during the first trimester or at other times during pregnancy. Deaths (stillbirth to the fourth birthday) occurred in 2227 children (4.4 per cent), and there was no evidence that antenatal exposure to either drug increased the death rate. Finally, as judged by mental and motor scores at the age of eight months, and intelligence quotient scores at four years, there was no evidence that the drugs cause brain damage.", 
    "34": "Cardiac contractility was studied in 4 groups of patients using, as parameter, the I/(PEP)2 index proposed by Reitan. 15 patients received 10 mg diazepam i.v. as sedation. The patients in group I were given lumbar peridural anesthesia with 20 ml prilocaine 2%. There was no significant change in the index. The patients in group II were given lumbar peridural anesthesia with 20 ml prilocaine and adrenalin 1/200,000. For 20 to 30 minutes there was a marked rise in the index. The patients in group III received the same lumbar peridural anesthesia as group II, but with a subsequent subcutaneous injection of 50 mg ephedrine HCl. At first the index rose rapidly; this rise was followed by a more rapid return to the initial value. Finally, the patients in group IV, who were under stabilized NLA narcosis, received 2 mg/kg prilocaine intravenously. There was no change in the index before and after the injection.", 
    "35": "A series of 2-methyldialkylammoniumalkylthio-4,p-substituted phenyl-3H-1,5-benzodiazepine iodides has been synthesized. Some compounds showed high selective activity against Staph. aureus and Strep. pyogenes. The nature of the sustituents at the phenyl moiety bound to the 4-position of the 1,5-benzodiazepine ring is of decisive influence, wherease the length of the aliphatic chain and the modification of the cationic head are of minor importance for the activity. The most active compound, 2-methyldiethylammoniumethylthio-4,p-phenylthiophenyl-3H-1,5-benzodiazepine iodide (XXXVIII), was selected for further research.", 
    "36": "A gas-chromatographic method is reported which completely resolves diazepam and its major metabolites and thus enables the specific quantitation of these compounds after extraction from serum and urine. The sensitivity limits are about 3 ng/ml if 4 ml serum or urine are extracted.", 
    "37": "Results of a previous experiment indicated that naive rats given a choice between morphine-admixed food (0.5 similar to 1mg/g of food) and quinine-admixed food (0.5 similar to 1 mg/g of food) for 3 weeks gradually and spontaneously preferred the morphine-admixed food, and this choice behavior revealed one of the psychological aspects of morphine dependent rats. In the present work, the ability of preference formation was detected for morphine, phenobarbital and diazepam by a defferent chioce test using drug dependent rats. Rats were pretreated with morpnine, phenobarbital, and/or diazepam by drug admixed food ingestion method for 12 similar to 15 weeks, and the choice test was practiced for one week at 3 intervals (4 similar to 5 trials). Control groups of rats were given the same choice testas the naive rats. Results indicated that (a) of all the drugs employed, morphine showed the most rapid and intensive preference formation (b) Phenobarbital and diazepam had almost the same degree of preference formation. (c) Phenobarbital showed no dose-dependent intensity of preference formation in the 50-90 mg/kg/day dose range, however, a more rapid development of preference was observed dose-dependently among the 80-120 mg/kg/day dose range of diazepam. Thus these studies utilizing a choice test provide a clear demonstration of drug-seeking behavior in rats. In addition, the present method is useful for drug screening tests involving weak psychological dependence liability, and moreover, the data could be analyzed statistically.", 
    "38": "Diazepam was shown to increase postexcitatory inhibition within the brain cortex as revealed by its influence upon the recovery cycles both of intracortical and primary responses. The specific interrelationship between diazepam and some drugs affecting brain GABA level suggests the possibility of a GABA mediated mechanism in the diazepam effect. The sensitivity of the brain cortex to diazepam is not lower than that of the amygdala and significantly higher than that of the hippocampus.", 
    "39": "1. Nimetazepam distributed more rapidly in the brain than its desmethyl derivative (nitrazepam). The brain concentration of the active metabolites of the former was about twice that of the latter at 1h after oral administration. 2. At least four kinds of reactions were involved in the biotransformation of nimetazepam and its desmethyl derivative (nitrazepam) : (i) demethylation at N-1, (ii) hydroxylation at C-3, (iii) reduction of the nitro group at C-7 to the amino group and (iv) subsequent acetylation of the amino group. 3. The 1-N-demethylation of nimetazepam was slow compared with the other three reactions. 4. Nimetazepam was rapidly hydroxylated at C-3, while the 3-hydroxylation of its desmethyl derivative (nitrazepam) was very slow. 5. The reduction of the nitro group at C-7 and subsequent acetylation were important routes for the excretion of these drugs.", 
    "40": "The hepatic synthesis of cholesterol-measured as incorporation of 14C-acetate into digitonin-precipitable sterols-has been evaluated in needle biopsy material of normal untreated patients and patients under short-term treatment with Diazepam, Phenobarbital, Chlorpromazine or Diphenylhydantoin. A significant increase of cholesterol synthesis was observed in the first two groups with much higher levels of incorporation in the Diazepam-treated patients. Moreover in this group the levels were still elevated from 4 to 7 days after drug withdrawl. Ultrastructural and morphometric studies performed on the same biopsy material showed a significant increase of smooth endoplasmic reticulum in hepatocytes of Diazepam-treated patients; in addition, there seemed to be a positive correlation between the increased cholesterol synthesis and the formation of areas of non vesicular, type 2, smooth endoplasmic reticulum. These findings suggest an early stimulation of the liver cell microsomal system by Diazepam in man; they also point to side effects of some drugs, which are not predictable from studies in Wistar rats.", 
    "41": "Attempts were made to control prolonged seizures with rapid intravenous administration of either diazepam or methohexitone in relatively small doses under electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring. The clinical and EEG features are discussed in relation to 65 episodes which occurred in 51 infants and children. Both clinical and EEG effects may become apparent in half a minute when the drug is administered with this technique and no undesirable side-effects were observed. The return of consciousness was not impaired by the small amounts of these drugs and the cumulative effects were negligible, allowing repeated injections if necessary. This technique avoids the disadvantages of larger doses of drugs given by slow intravenous infusion.", 
    "42": "During general anaesthesia with controlled ventilation and normocapnia the A-a DO2 and pulmonary shunt were investigated in a group of 7 patients undergoing a parotidectomy or laryngectomy. In a second group of 21 patients the behaviour of the total, lung- and thorax compliance was investigated. Within the first 1 1/2 hours after induction of anesthesia the A-a DO2 and shunt increased. During the time the thorax compliance did not change, whereas the total and lung compliance decreased significantly. After 1 1/2 hours no further change occured.", 
    "43": "Diazepam has been used to an increasing extent in cardioversion, since avoiding general anaesthesia simplifier the procedure. The present study concerns the effect of diazepam on BP and blood gases in 13 cases of cardioversion. A moderate fall of both systolic and diastolic BP occurred. The arterial pO2 and pCO2 did not change significantly.", 
    "44": "In this study, intravenous diazepam was a convenient, safe, and entirely adequate replacement of anesthesia for orthopaedia manipulations. It was administered in the hospital emergency room to both healthy and ill patients. A wide age range of patients was treated, and many very difficult reductions were accomplished. It is the author's firm opinion, however, that the physician using this technique should be capable of using emergency respiratory resuscitation equipment and that such equipment should be immediately available. Close attention should be paid to the recomended method of drug administration and the physician should be congnizant of potential complications.", 
    "45": "Depression is a common reaction to the vicissitudes of life among elderly people. Aged persons are physiologically and psychologically less able to adapt, yet they are required to change their life styles because of retirement, lowered financial resources, death of family and friends, and illness. Although many mental health professionals are reluctant to treat geropsychiatric patients, the prognosis for depressed patients can be good. Drug therapy is usually the most effective, although psychotherapy and other behavioral therapies may be used adjunctively. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be indicated for severely depressed patients. The beginning dosage of medication should be lower than for younger patients, and elderly patients must be monitored carefully for side effects. Adverse reactions due to multiple drug interactions are also possible. When aged persons become severely depressed, they are at high risk of suicide; almost all suicide attempts by elderly people are successfl. Depression in later life is treatable, and the pessimism that often surrounds the prognosis for geropsychiatric patients is unwarranted.", 
    "46": "The central nervous system toxicities of etidocaine, bupivacaine, and lidocaine were studied during constant-rate intravenous infusions in rhesus monkeys. Comparison of drug effects was achieved by determining the drug dosages and arterial plasma concentrations that induced electrical seizure activity. The central nervous system toxicity of etidocaine was similar to that of bupivacaine. The toxicity of each was four times greater than that of lidocaine. Since the drug infusion rates were proportional to anesthetic potencies in clinical usage, the therapeutic-toxic ratios of these three drugs are similar.", 
    "47": "Skills related to driving, the ability to discriminate the fusion of flickering light, and hand and foot proprioception, were measured double-blind in 34 healthy volunteers before and after three doses of i.v. diazepam. The effects of diazepam were most harmful to co-ordination. With 0.15 mg/kg, 0.30 mg/kg and 0.45 mg/kg of diazepam the impairment of co-ordinative skills was statistically significant (P less than 0.05) up to 2, 6 and 8 hr respectively. No impairment of performance on any test was measurable at 6 hr after 0.15 mg/kg or at 10 hr after 0.30 or 0.45 mg/kg of diazepam. There were large interindividual variations in serum concentrations of diazepam within each dose level. The increases in serum concentrations of diazepam after the intake of food support the concept of an enterohepatic cycle for diazepam. It was concluded that patients should not drive or operate machinery for at least 6 hr after 0.15 mg/kg of i.v. diazepam and at least 10 hr after 0.30 mg/kg and 0.45 mg/kg.", 
    "48": "Three groups of patients with myofascial pain-dysfunction syndrome received 12 eclectic group psychotherapy sessions. The principal reason for selecting this mode of treatment was to observe the group dynamics for the operation of intra and interpersonal variables that might support the psychophysiologic hypothesis for myofascial pain-dysfunction syndrome and validate the existence of personality characteristics that are associated with patients who have myofascial pain-dysfunction."
