In this study, two novel radioiodinated 1,4-benzodiazepines, (S)-1-(3-iodophenyl)-3-(1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[e][1,4]diazepin-3-yl)urea (9) and (R)-1-(3-iodophenyl)-3-(1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[e][1,4]diazepin-3-yl)urea (7), were developed. They were characterized in vitro as high affinity selective antagonists at cholecystokinin types 1 and 2 (CCK(1) and CCK(2)) receptors using receptor binding, calcium mobilization, and internalization studies. Their binding to human tumor tissues was assessed with in vitro receptor autoradiography and compared with an established peptidic CCK agonist radioligand. The (125)I-labeled CCK(1) receptor-selective compound 9 often revealed a substantially higher amount of CCK(1) receptor binding sites in tumors than the agonist (125)I-CCK. Conversely, the radioiodinated CCK(2) receptor-selective compound 7 showed generally weaker tumor binding than (125)I-CCK. In conclusion, compound 9 is an excellent radioiodinated nonpeptidic antagonist ligand for direct and selective labeling of CCK(1) receptors in vitro. Moreover, it represents a suitable candidate to test antagonist binding to CCK(1) receptor-expressing tumors in vivo.",

Both groups received a median dose of 3 mg of midazolam (range 2-5 mg). In patients receiving lower doses (2-2.5 and 3-3.5 mg), recovery times were significantly faster with fentanyl (P < .01 and <.05, respectively), whereas at higher doses of midazolam (> or =4 mg) there was no difference between the 2 groups.",

This type of a disorder is recorded in patients with a first episode of schizophrenia, as well as in chronic patients (Saykin et al. 1994). These researches show that this deficit is not influenced by neuroleptics. Paulsen and associates suggest that the deficit of verbal learning in schizophrenia is related to difficulties in encoding retrieving information without significant storage (rapid forgetting) problems (Paulsen at al. 1995).

Following an ambulatory treatment, the patient was diagnosed with Anorexia nervosa. The patient, a girl, was 175 centimeters tall, weighting only 39 kilos. Within the clinical picture, there were few dominant disorders present; anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, fear of feminization, with recurrent psychotic episodes. By the implementation of an intensive psychotherapeutic treatment, without the use of psychopharmacs, the weight was kept stable. In accordance with the girl's mother, a psychopharmacotherapy was commenced, a combination of olanzapine and paroxetine (the choice of psychopharmacs was lead by the side effects known). At the end of a 24-month period of a psychological treatment which was combined with psychopharmacotherapy, the patient exhibited no symptomatology and a stable clinical remission of the illness was achieved.", 
    "16": "A scientific progress, due to the advancements within the pharmacological industry nowdays, is offering an ever increasing number of atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia treatment. The atypics are gradually taking over the leadership of the more conventional antipsychotics in treating schizophrenia. The advantages of using atypics are fewer instances of side-effects and a good tolerance of the drug, which promotes an adequate and a satisfactory collaboration of the patients during the treatment. The daily practice often shows a polypragmasia within the treatment itself and a less frequent presence of a monotherapy as a way of treatment of schizophrenia. A question arises asking us, whether these are just a number of some old practices or, in the other hand, some fears and doubts between the clinitians and patients? The answer remanis for us to ponder upon. The patient diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia had been treated with a combination of conventional antipsychotics for many years. Eight years back, olanzapine was introduced in a 20 mg daily dose, combined with an anxiolytic, to which he reacted well. He was kept on the same olanzapine dose exclusively, for the past five years. During the treatment, he used to be monitored regularly (laboratory analyses, body weight) and no side-effects were percieved. He was in a stable remission during the treatment and a good recovery is evident via social functioning and a working ability.",

Among the pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs) sibiromycin, one of two identified glycosylated PBDs, displays the highest affinity for DNA and the most potent antitumor properties. Despite the promising antitumor properties clinical trials of sibiromycin were precluded by the cardiotoxicity effect in animals attributed to the presence of the C-9 hydroxyl group. As a first step toward the development of sibiromycin analogs, we have cloned and localized the sibiromycin gene cluster to a 32.7-kb contiguous DNA region. Cluster boundaries tentatively assigned by comparative genomics were verified by gene replacement experiments. The sibiromycin gene cluster consisting of 26 open reading frames reveals a \"modular\" strategy in which the synthesis of the anthranilic and dihydropyrrole moieties is completed before assembly by the nonribosomal peptide synthetase enzymes. In addition, the gene cluster identified includes open reading frames encoding enzymes involved in sibirosamine biosynthesis, as well as regulatory and resistance proteins.

    "39": "The actions of neuropeptide AF (NPAF), on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, behavior and autonomic functions were investigated. NPAF (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 nmol) was administered intracerebroventricularly to rats, the behavior of which was monitored by means of telemetry, open-field (OF) observations and elevated plus-maze (EPM) tests. The temperature and heart rate were recorded by telemetry, and the plasma ACTH and corticosterone levels were used as indices of the HPA activation. The dopamine release from striatal and amygdala slices after peptide treatment (100 nM and 1 microM) was measured with a superfusion apparatus. To establish the transmission of the HPA response, animals were pretreated with the corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) receptor antagonist antalarmin or astressin 2B (0.5 nmol). In the OF test, the animals were pretreated with antalarmin or haloperidol (10 microg/kg), while in the EPM test they were pretreated with antalarmin or diazepam (1 mg/kg). NPAF stimulated ACTH and corticosterone release, which was inhibited by antalarmin. It activated exploratory locomotion (square crossings and rearings) and grooming in OF observations, and decreased the entries to and the time spent in the open arms during the EPM tests. The antagonists inhibited the locomotor responses, and also attenuated grooming and the EPM responses. NPAF also increased spontaneous locomotion, and tended to decrease the core temperature and the heart rate in telemetry, while it augmented the dopamine release from striatal and amygdala slices. These results demonstrate, that acute administration of exogenous NPAF stimulates the HPA axis and behavioral paradigms through CRH and dopamine release.",

    "42": "There were significant differences among the three medication groups in weight gain and in increases in blood lipids and glucose. Patients on haloperidol showed no increase on any of these parameters. Patients on olanzapine gained the most weight, but patients on clozapine had the greatest increases in cholesterol, triglyceride, and glucose. An effect of ethnicity was observed, as African-American patients were more likely to develop metabolic abnormalities than other ethnic groups, especially on clozapine.",

    "44": "Signal detection methods were used to identify values of metabolic variables that predict development of prediabetes or diabetes before (moderators) or associated with treatment (mediators), utilizing data from two multi-center clinical trials of patients with schizophrenia, treated for 6 months with olanzapine (OLZ) or ziprasidone (ZIP). At baseline, participants were often overweight/obese (63% with a body mass index >or=25.0kg/m(2)), dyslipidemic [more than one-third had elevated triglyceride (TG) and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations], and prediabetic (20%). Weight gain was significantly greater in OLZ-treated patients, as was accentuation of dyslipidemia. However, there were no significant correlations between weight gain and lipid changes from baseline to weeks 2, 4, 8 or to last observation. Type 2 diabetes developed in 4% and prediabetes in 18% of the population. Significant baseline predictors of diabetes were a HDL-C concentration <28mg/dL, or being >or=58-years-old if HDL-C concentration was >or=28mg/dL. Baseline plasma glucose concentration >or=92mg/dL was the only significant predictor of developing prediabetes, accounting for 60% of cases. Post-treatment increments in plasma TG concentrations >or=145mg/dL or >or=59mg/dL were significant predictors of diabetes (23%) or prediabetes (27%), respectively. If the increase in TG was <145mg/dL, rapid weight gain >or=6.1kg in 2 weeks predicted development of diabetes (18%). These findings provide a quantitative approach to identify those at greatest treatment-associated risk to develop glucose intolerance, and emphasize the need to address co-morbid medical disorders in these patients.",

    "49": "Previous studies have demonstrated that microinjections of midazolam, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, into the amygdala produce anxiolytic-like effects in elevated plus-maze (EPM)-na\u00efve rodents. However, systemic or intracerebral administration of benzodiazepines (BDZ) fails to alter anxiety in maze-experienced animals, a phenomenon defined as \"one trial tolerance\" (OTT). This study focused on the effects of intra-amygdala infusion of midazolam in maze-experienced mice. In addition, the effects of flumazenil in the amygdala of maze-na\u00efve and experienced mice were also investigated. To investigate intrinsic effects of intra-amygdala flumazenil on anxiety, animals were systemically treated with the BDZ receptor inverse agonist, DMCM (4-ethyl-6,7-dimethoxy-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester hydrochloride). Conventional measures of anxiety (% open arm entries and % open arm time), locomotor activity (frequency of closed arm entries) and a range of ethological measures related to risk assessment were recorded. Intra-amygdala midazolam (3.0 and 30 nmol) attenuated anxiety in maze-experienced mice. A similar behavioral profile was produced by intra-amygdala flumazenil in maze-na\u00efve (4.0 and 16 nmol) and maze-experienced (16 nmol) mice. Intra-amygdala flumazenil (at 2.0 nmol, a dose devoid of any intrinsic effect on anxiety measures in the EPM) selectively and completely blocked the anxiogenic-like effects of systemic administration of DMCM (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) in maze-na\u00efve mice. Together, these results demonstrate that the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex located within the amygdala does not play a role in the OTT phenomenon. Present results also suggest that the release of an endogenous BDZ receptor inverse agonist within the amygdala seems to be an important correlate of the emotional state induced by the plus-maze test.", 
    "50": "In order to find an effective treatment option for status epilepticus in progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME), we reviewed the clinical course of 9 patients with PME. Initially, epilepsy was successfully treated with antiepileptics. However, it gradually became refractory to medication, and status epilepticus emerged 3-19 years after the onset of epilepsy. In these patients, status epilepticus in PME was classified into (1) myoclonic status epilepticus (MSE), (2) myoclonic-generalized status epilepticus (MGSE), and (3) generalized status epilepticus (GSE). MSE was common in patients with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, and GSE was common in those with dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. MGSE was characterized by the mixture of escalating myoclonus and generalized seizures, and was observed in patients with Gaucher disease or unspecified PME. All patients were often refractory to infusion of benzodiazepines and barbiturates but phenytoin was able to terminate status epilepticus in 7 patients. Oral phenytoin administration as preventive therapy was effective in 6 patients. Aggravation of myoclonus was not provoked by these treatments. We propose that phenytoin should be considered as a treatment choice for PME patients at late stages to prevent the detrimental effects of prolonged or repeated status epilepticus on the brain tissues.", 
    "51": "Status epilepticus (SE) refractory to benzodiazepines and other antiepileptic agents is managed with intravenous anesthetic compounds, such as thiopental, propofol or midazolam. These drugs display quite different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, but have not been prospectively compared to date. Their use is clearly advocated for the treatment of generalized convulsive SE, whereas partial-complex, or absence SE are generally managed less aggressively, in consideration of their better prognosis. The most important aspect seems to be related to the correct use of these anesthetics in the right context, rather than the choice of one specific compound. An electroencephalographic burst-suppression should be targeted for about 24 hour, before progressive weaning of the dosage under EEG monitoring. If this approach proves unsuccessful, the use of other drugs, including inhalational anesthetics, has been described.", 
    "52": "Adolescent dental patients pose a unique challenge to providers, particularly when intravenous sedation is introduced to the treatment plan. Surveys show many adolescents are afraid of the dentist. Five to six per cent overall are fearful of dental injections and may avoid care or have irregular attendance. At the same time, adolescents may assert their independence by refusing to cooperate with providers' and parents' requests even while accepting that the goal of better health is reasonable. Successful treatment of--and rapport with--the adolescent dental patient, however, can ensure that adolescents' oral needs are met. Successful providers recognise that adolescents alternate between childlike and mature coping strategies during the course of dental treatment. Identifying an adolescent's current coping style can help the dental team select appropriate strategies to help treatment proceed more smoothly for the adolescent and clinical team. Working with adolescents' individual coping styles, rather than expecting consistently adult behaviour, will ideally help decrease frustration and improve treatment outcome.", 
    "53": "The aim of this prospective pragmatic audit was to investigate the level of consciousness experienced by children requiring conscious sedation in a primary care sedation service, using an 'alternative technique' to avoid referral to hospital for general anaesthesia. This technique was only applied to children who were unable to accept treatment with the use of standard inhalation sedation. The technique involved titrated inhaled oxygen and nitrous oxide and titrated sevoflurane with intravenous fentanyl and titrated midazolam. The described technique was provided by an experienced team with appropriate facilities that complied with contemporary standards and guidance. During treatment and recovery the consciousness level of children was recorded using a modified Wilson's scale. Of the sample of 573 children who received the audited technique, 1.9% (11 children) scored level 5 on the modified Wilson scale (eyes closed but responsive to mild physical stimulus). Due to the fine control this technique offers, the duration of this level of consciousness was for mostly less than a minute and no more than five minutes. No children became unresponsive. The results of this audit demonstrate that the technique meets current standards and guidelines for 'alternative' conscious sedation, with a wide margin of safety and the rendering of loss of consciousness unlikely. 99% of patients who would otherwise have required general anaesthetic for dental treatment successfully completed their treatment using this technique.",

    "62": "This audit confirmed results from previous audits. The standards set for referral were not met. Despite the efficacy of psychological treatments, referring clinicians do not seem to consider their use for anxious patients. Referral patterns seemed to support the idea that a minority of practitioners refer significantly higher numbers of patients than their peers.", 
    "63": "The clinical use of benzodiazepines (BZs) is hampered by sedation and cognitive deterioration. Although genetic and pharmacological studies suggest that alpha1- and alpha5-containing GABA(A) receptors mediate and/or modulate these effects, their molecular substrate is not fully elucidated. By the use of two selective ligands: the alpha1-subunit affinity-selective antagonist beta-CCt, and the alpha5-subunit affinity- and efficacy-selective antagonist XLi093, we examined the mechanisms of behavioural effects of diazepam in the tests of spontaneous locomotor activity and water-maze acquisition and recall, the two paradigms indicative of sedative- and cognition-impairing effects of BZs, respectively. The locomotor-activity decreasing propensity of diazepam (significant at 1.5 and 5 mg/kg) was antagonized by beta-CCt (5 and 15 mg/kg), while it tended to be potentiated by XLi093 in doses of 10 mg/kg, and especially 20 mg/kg. Diazepam decreased acquisition and recall in the water maze, with a minimum effective dose of 1.5 mg/kg. Both antagonists reversed the thigmotaxis induced by 2 mg/kg diazepam throughout the test, suggesting that both GABA(A) receptor subtypes participate in BZ effects on the procedural component of the task. Diazepam-induced impairment in the declarative component of the task, as assessed by path efficiency, the latency and distance before finding the platform across acquisition trials, and also by the spatial parameters in the probe trial, was partially prevented by both, 15 mg/kg beta-CCt and 10 mg/kg XLi093. Combining a BZ with beta-CCt results in the near to control level of performance of a cognitive task, without sedation, and may be worth testing on human subjects.", 
    "64": "Atypical antipsychotics interfere with central and peripheral neurotransmitter systems and with hormonal production. In this study we compared the effect of olanzapine and risperidone on hormonal state and sexual function (by using the Questionnaire for Sexual Dysfunction, QSD) in 40 patients with a first episode psychosis. Results were compared to those of 34 healthy controls. Patients using risperidone had significant higher prolactin levels than patients using olanzapine. Patients using olanzapine had significantly higher 17beta-estradiol levels than patients using risperidone. Overall satisfaction with sexuality was less in patients compared to controls, but not different between patients using olanzapine and those using risperidone. Problems with sexual arousal were significantly higher in patients using olanzapine compared to patients using risperidone. A significantly higher frequency of problems with ejaculation and problems with insensibility of genitals were found in patients compared to healthy controls. We found no relation between medication, prolactin and 17beta-estradiol levels, frequency of sexual activity, overall satisfaction with sexuality and any of the 18 sexual dysfunctions we investigated. Our results suggests that sexual dysfunction in patients with first episode psychosis might occur despite normal prolactin levels. Also, sexual dysfunction is highly prevalent in healthy controls. Awareness should be raised of potential sexual problems in young adults.", 
    "65": "Convulsive status epilepticus in childhood is a life threatening condition with serious risk of neurological sequelae which constitutes a medical emergency. Clinical and experimental data suggest that prolonged seizures can have immediate and long-term adverse consequences on the immature and developing brain. So the child who presents with a continuous generalized convulsive seizure lasting greater than five minutes should be promptly treated. The outcome is mainly determined by the underlying etiology, age and duration of status epilepticus. In children the mortality from status epilepticus ranges from 3 to 5% and the morbidity is two-fold higher. Mortality and morbidity are highest with status epilepticus associated with central nervous system infections, which is the most important cause of status epilepticus. There are few evidence-based data to guide management decisions for the child with status epilepticus. Immediate goals are stabilization of airways, breathing and circulation and termination of seizures. Benzodiazepines remain the first-line drugs recommended for prompt termination of seizures. As intravenous lorazepam is not available in France, we suggest clonazepam as the best choice for initial therapy. Rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam remain important options. Intravenous phenytoin/fosphenytoin and phenobarbital are the second-line drugs. Phenytoin is being increasingly substituted by fosphenytoin, but pediatric data are scarce and fosphenytoin is not authorized for use in France below five years old. In children, phenytoin is often preferred to phenobarbital, even though no comparative studies have demonstrated a better efficacy. To manage status epilepticus refractory to a benzodiazepine and administration of phenytoin and/or phenobarbital, many pediatricians today prefer high-dose midazolam infusion rather than thiopental to minimize serious side effects from barbiturate anesthesia. There is no benefit/risk ratio to support the use of propofol for children with refractory status epilepticus.", 
    "66": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the anxiolytic effects of luteolin and its potential interaction with the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Lemon balm has traditionally been used as an herbal remedy in the treatment of many medical conditions, including anxiety. Luteolin is a major component of the essential oil lemon balm. We divided 55 rats into 5 groups: (1) control (negative control), (2) luteolin, (3) midazolam (positive control), (4) flumazenil and luteolin, and (5) midazolam and luteolin. The behavioral component of anxiety was examined by using the elevated plus-maze (open arm time/total time) and motor movements. Data analyses were performed using a 2-tailed multivariate analysis of variance and Sheff\u00e9 post hoc test. Our data suggest that luteolin does not produce anxiolysis by modulation of the GABAA receptor; however, luteolin may modulate motor movements and locomotion.",

    "69": "The aim of the present investigation is to study the effects of acute ethanol administration in measures of attention and response control in the five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) in two strains of mice, C57BL/6JOlaHsd and CD1.", 
    "70": "Mice were trained in the 5-CSRTT and then were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 0, 0.5, 1 and 2 g/kg ethanol before testing under standard parameters and in a long inter-trial interval (ITI) session, which promotes the emergence of premature responses, a measure of poor inhibitory control. To examine if the effects of ethanol in the 5-CSRTT were due to its actions at GABA(A) receptors or at NMDA receptors, the GABA(A) receptor agonist diazepam (1 and 2 mg/kg, i.p.) and the non-competitive NMDA antagonist ketamine (10 and 20 mg/kg, i.p.) were tested in long ITI sessions.", 
    "71": "Ethanol did not affect attention or impulsivity in the standard procedure, but increased premature responding in long ITI sessions. The effects of ethanol were mimicked by diazepam in both strains of mice, whereas ketamine increased premature responding only in the CD1 strain.", 
    "72": "Ethanol's ability to increase impulsivity in the 5-CSRTT is mediated by both common and different neurotransmitter systems in the two strains of mice and is dependent on the task's parameters. Furthermore, ethanol did not decrease response accuracy, suggesting that attentional mechanisms are preserved after acute ethanol in mice and that the increases in impulsive behaviour are independent of attentional performance.",

    "74": "A longitudinal cohort study involving 246 women seen at the maternity unit of Hospital Manoel Gon\u00e7alves in Ita\u00fana, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. A monthly follow-up of mothers and newborns was performed for the first 12 months postpartum or until weaning. The effect of the practice of self-medication on the duration of breastfeeding was evaluated by multivariate analysis using Cox's regression model with time-dependent variables.", 
    "75": "Self-medication was practiced by 52.4% of the nursing mothers. The most used pharmacological classes were: analgesics/antipyretics (54.5%), non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (15%), spasmolytics (6.2%), laxatives (3.5%), benzodiazepines (3%), nasal decongestants (1.4%), and antibiotics (0.9%). The most used drugs were dipyrone (31.5%) and paracetamol (17.9%). The practice of self-medication was associated with a higher probability of the use of drugs posing the risk of adverse effects for the infant or for lactation (p = 0.000). However, the practice of self-medication was not associated with weaning (p = 0.135).", 
    "76": "The high rates of self-medication among nursing mothers and the use of drugs posing risks of undesirable effects for the infant and for lactation reveal the need for better education on the risks of self-medication by nursing mothers.

Initial cylization of N-(beta-haloacyl)-o-aminobenzonitrile to obtain the corresponding lactam (e.g.alpha,alpha-dimethyl-N-(2-cyanophenyl)-beta-lactam) increased the yield of 1,5-benzodiazocin-4-ones significantly. Somewhat surprisingly, addition of lithium reagents to N-(beta-haloacyl)-o-aminobenzonitrile gave 4,4-disubstituted quinazolines via Grob fragmentation.", 
    "78": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between urine levels of target drugs of abuse for which Triage DOA gave positive results, as well as the cut-off levels for these drugs. Thirty-eight forensic urine samples positive for commonly abused drugs were involved. Of these samples, 12 were positive for barbiturates (BAR), 11 for benzodiazepines (BZO), 8 for opiates (OPI), 7 for amphetamines (AMP), and 4 for tricyclic antidepressants (TCA). In the BAR-positive urine samples, phenobarbital, amobarbital or barbital was detected at concentrations higher than cut-off levels. In the BZO-positive samples, diazepam, nordiazepam, triazolam, nitrazepam and/or midazolam was detected at concentrations lower than cut-off levels; in the triazolam-involved urine, alpha-hydroxytriazolam, a metabolite of triazolam, showed concentrations higher than cut-off level. In the AMP-positive samples, methamphetamine was detected at concentrations higher than cut-off level. Urine samples positive for OPI contained total dihydrocodeine, codeine or morphine at concentrations higher than cut-off levels. In TCA-positive samples, amitriptyline was detected at concentrations higher or lower than cut-off level, and clomipramine was detected at a concentration much lower than cut-off level. Metabolites of BZO and TCA, which are not typically analyzed by instrumental procedures, may cross-react to varying degrees with the antibodies used for Triage DOA.",

    "84": "Since the discovery of endogenous cannabinoid signaling, the number of studies exploring its role in health and disease has increased exponentially. Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the enzyme responsible for degradation of the endocannabinoid anandamide, has emerged as a promising target for anxiety-related disorders. FAAH inhibitors (e.g., URB597) increase brain levels of anandamide and induce anxiolytic-like effects in rodents. Recent findings, however, questioned the efficacy of URB597 as an anxiolytic.", 
    "85": "We tested here the hypothesis that conflicting findings are due to variations in the stressfulness of experimental conditions employed in various studies.", 
    "86": "We found that URB597 (0.1-0.3 mg/kg) did not produce anxiolytic effects when the aversiveness of testing procedures was minimized by handling rats daily before experimentation, by habituating them to the experimental room, or by employing low illumination during testing. In contrast, URB597 had robust anxiolytic effects when the aversiveness of the testing environment was increased by eliminating habituation to the experimental room or by employing bright lighting conditions. Unlike URB597, the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) had anxiolytic effects under all testing conditions. The anxiolytic effects of URB597 were abolished by the cannabinoid CB1-receptor antagonist AM251, showing that they were mediated by CB1 receptors. Close inspection of experimental conditions employed in earlier reports suggests that conflicting findings with URB597 can be explained by different testing conditions, such as those manipulated in the present study.",

    "88": "Agonists at the benzodiazepine-binding site of ionotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptors are in clinical use as hypnotics, anxiolytics, and anticonvulsants since the early 1960. Analgesic effects of classical benzodiazepines have occasionally been reported in certain subgroups of patients suffering from chronic pain or after spinal delivery through intrathecal catheters. However, these drugs are generally not considered as analgesics but should in fact be avoided in patients with chronic pain. Recent evidence from genetically modified mice now indicates that agents targeting only a subset of benzodiazepine (GABA(A)) receptors should provide pronounced antihyperalgesic activity against inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Several such compounds have been developed recently, which exhibit significant antihyperalgesia in mice and rats and appear to be devoid of the typical side-effects of classical benzodiazepines.", 
    "89": "Pulmonary embolus (PE) is not an uncommon cause of sudden death, and forensic pathologists are not unaccustomed to being the first to diagnose a PE in a patient, since they are often fatal. Forensic pathologists are also familiar with the known risk factors for development of PEs, including advanced age, use of oral contraceptives, smoking, obesity, a sedimentary lifestyle, postsurgery or postinjury, pregnancy, certain malignancies, factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutations, and anticardiolipin antibodies. It has recently been shown in the clinical literature that antipsychotic medications are associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Clozapine, a close relative of olanzapine, has been implicated as an independent risk factor for developing a PE. Four cases have been published within the last 2 years questioning whether olanzapine may also be associated with an increased risk for PE. We report 6 cases from the Bexar County Medical Examiner's Office, occurring between 1998 and 2005 where olanzapine may have been a risk factor in the development of, and death from, PE.", 
    "90": "A rapid, human on-site urine multidrug test was used to screen canine urine samples for the presence of five illegal drugs and drugs from three commonly abused drug classes. Each sample was sent to a toxicology laboratory for gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) validation. On-site test results and GC/MS assays confirmed that the human on-site test kit did identify barbiturates, opiates, benzodiazepines, and amphetamines/methamphetamines in urine from dogs that had received these common illicit drugs/drug classes either intravenously and/or orally. However, neither the on-site test kit nor the GC/MS individual assays for marijuana or methadone, a synthetic opiate, were effective in identifying marijuana and methadone in urine from dogs with suspected or known exposure. No index of suspicion was seen for exposure to phencyclidines or cocaine during the study period, and no exposures were indicated by the on-site test results. Overall, the test is a rapid, readily available, affordable, and useful complement to the veterinarian's clinical consideration and professional judgment.",

Two hundred sixty-four patients between 6 months and 5 years of age were randomized to chloral hydrate or midazolam groups. Either 50 mg/kg of chloral hydrate orally or 0.3 mg/kg of midazolam sublingually was given in each groups. If the child was not responded within 30 minutes after the first dose, another half dose of each drug for the second dose will be required. The action duration time, sedation score level and the ability to complete echocardiogram were collected.", 
    "94": "Both groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, body weight, underlying heart disease, baseline O2 saturation and functional heart classification. The children in chloral hydrate group needed the second dose for sedation more than midazolam group (10.6%, 5.3% p = 0.111). The onset, action duration and total study time were significantly shorter in midazolam than in chloral hydrate group (p < 0.001). The number of the patients who had the action duration within the optimal time (< 45 min) were significantly more cases in midazolam than in chloral hydrate group (93.1%, 43.5% p < 0.001). Success rate of echocardiogram was 99.2% in each group. There was no difference in echocardiographic time performed in both groups. The children in chloral hydrate group had deeper in level of sedation (p < 0.001). Both groups showed no significant difference in term of the ability to complete echocardiographic examination. The reaction of the children to take the medication and the number of the patients who had systemic O2 saturation change more than 5%from the baseline were higher in chloral hydrate group significantly (14.4%, 4.5% p = 0.006 and 9.9%, 3.1% p = 0.025).",

The elimination half-life of midazolam administered intravenously (5 mg kg(-1)) or orally (15 mg kg(-1)) was significantly decreased by 70% and 73%, respectively, 24 h after a single oral administration of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, 300 mg kg(-1)) in rats. In the liver there was a significant enhancement of the hydroxylation of midazolam in the microsomes and expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and CYP3A2 mRNA. 2. The C(max) and area under the curve (AUC)(0-infinity) of midazolam were significantly (1.8-2.3 fold) increased by the single oral treatment with UDCA (100 and 300 mg kg(-1)). Thus, the oral bioavailability, estimated from the AUC(0-infinity), of midazolam administered intravenously and orally was significantly (1.8- and 2.3-fold, respectively) increased by the treatment with UDCA. 3. Repeated administration of UDCA (300 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) for 7 days did not alter the pharmacokinetics of midazolam administered intravenously or orally, and the expression of mRNA for CYP3As in the rat liver. 4. The study has shown that a single administration of UDCA in rats induces significant hepatic CYP3A activity and increases significantly the oral bioavailability of midazolam.

To assess the substrate-dependent effects of the low-activity allele of human CYP3A4, CYP3A4*16 (Thr185Ser), a recombinant wild-type (CYP3A4.1) or variant (CYP3A4.16) protein was co-expressed with human NADPH-P450 reductase in Sf21 insect cells using a baculovirus-insect cell system. 2. The holo-CYP3A4 protein level of CYP3A4.16 in insect microsomes was slightly higher than that of CYP3A4.1, while no difference in total (apo- and holo-) CYP3A4 protein levels was observed between them. 3. When midazolam was used as a substrate, K(m) and V(max) for 1'-hydroxylation in CYP3A4.16 were significantly higher and lower, respectively, than those in the wild-type, resulting in a 50% decrease in intrinsic clearance (V(max)/K(m)) of the variant. In contrast, intrinsic clearance for 4-hydroxylation of the variant was decreased by 30% due to a significant increase in K(m) without a difference in V(max). 4. Both the wild-type and variant exhibited sigmoidal kinetic profiles for carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide formation. When the modified two-site equation was applied for the analysis of kinetic parameters, K(m2) and V(max2) of CYP3A4.16 were approximately two times higher and lower than those of the wild-type, resulting in a 74% decrease in intrinsic clearance. 5. These results demonstrated that CYP3A4.16 shows the substrate-dependent altered kinetics compared with CYP3A4.1.",

In the course of these proceedings, exhibits relating to the deaths of a total of 13 patients who had died due to chemical-toxicological causes were reviewed. Nine of them were exhumed. On average, death had occurred 22 months prior to exhumation (range of 1-34 months). The average age of the deceased was 76 years (range of 65-92 years). In five of the cases, analysis results and an evaluation of the medical records confirmed that a final, undocumented dose of sodium nitroprusside or midazolam was administered. After administration of sodium nitroprusside, the active agent rapidly releases nitrogen monoxide, itself undetectable. Another indicator that can be detected, however, is the cyanide that is also released. In one of the exhumed patients, cyanide could still be detected 18 months after death.

    "114": "The necessary evidence of new therapies of clinical interest extends beyond clinical trials in a less controlled population and closer to clinical practice justified since several years the need of conducting observational, noninterventional studies. Observational studies must include epidemiological (quantitative observational) data to define prevalence and natural history of the target conditions. Moreover, pharmacological interventions in \"naturalistic\" patients populations, selected by clinicians as per clinical judgment within the scope of the target disease will allow to generate data to complement clinical trials. Clinical trials designed to show robust data on efficacy and tolerability particularly during registration trials must be complemented by robust observational research to confirm and better describe clinical effectiveness in the target population. A noninterventional, observational trial is a study where the medicinal product(s) is (are) prescribed in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of the marketing authorization. The assignment of the patient to a particular therapeutic strategy is not decided in advance by a trial protocol but falls within current practice and the prescription of the medicine is clearly separated from the decision to include the patient in the study.

Patients entered in the cohort as per clinicians decision underwent a treatment with olanzapine during an outpatient's consultation or at hospitalization. More than two thirds of the patients were followed up during 12 months after onset of this treatment. Clinical outcome was assessed at three, six, nine and 12 months following cohort inclusion using the following tools: CGI, PANSS, Calgary and GAF; as per CGI 78% of the patients cohort were severely ill, the mean PANSS score was 94.1.

Treatment included elements of 12-step facilitation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and motivational enhancement. All urine tests included cannabinoids, opioids, benzodiazepines, cocaine, and amphetamines. Patients with negative urines or perfect attendance earned chances to draw weekly from a bag for prizes of varying value, and the number of draws increased with each consecutive negative urine test. Data were collected for those patients (age 12-18) treated immediately before (n=83) and after (n=264) the CM program was introduced to the treatment center, and positive urine rates were compared using chi-square tests. Patients treated with the CM program had lower rates of urines positive for opioids (p<0.005) and cocaine (p<0.05), and non-significantly but consistently lower rates of urines positive for all other drug classes. Altogether, the proportion of urines positive for any drug decreased from 33.3% to 23.4% (p<0.01). Pre- and post-CM comparisons of attendance reveal lower daily attendance rates but longer retention in treatment. Expenses were minimal at $0.39 per patient per day.

    "120": "The topic of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), including delirium tremens and especially seizures, is reviewed. From mice and rat studies, it is known that both N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors are involved in AWS. During alcohol intoxication chronic adaptations of NMDA and GABA receptors occur, and during alcohol withdrawal a hyperexcitable state develops. In studies on humans, during intoxication the NMDA receptors are activated and mediate tonic inhibition. In withdrawal, a rebound activation of these receptors occurs. Both GABA-A and GABA-B receptors, especially the alpha2 subunit of GABA-A receptors, are also likely involved. Homocysteine increases with active drinking, and in withdrawal, excitotoxicity likely is induced by a further increase in homocysteine, viewed as a risk factor for AWS and also as a screening tool. The dopamine transporter gene is also associated with AWS. Characteristics involves changes in the ECG, especially an increase in QT interval, and EEG changes, including abnormal quantified EEG, at times periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges, and especially seizures, usually occurring 6-48h after the cessation of drinking. Therapy has emphasized benzodiazepines, mainly diazepam and lorazepam, but more standard antiepileptic drugs, like carbamazepine and topiramate, are also effective and safe.",

Patients with dementia, aged 65 and above and resident in 35 Alzheimer special care units were sequentially enrolled into a 18-month prospective observational study. Data on sociodemographic, cognitive, functional, behavioural and clinical characteristics and drug exposure were collected at baseline and at 6-month intervals up to 18 months. The prevalence of antipsychotic use and the association with BPSD and clinical predictors were analysed. Of the 349 patients with dementia enrolled in the study, 209 (60%) were taking at least one antipsychotic. Risperidone and promazine were the most frequently prescribed antipsychotic; 40.7% simultaneously received a benzodiazepine, 20% an antidepressant. More than 50% were still taking antipsychotics at 18 months of follow-up. No associations were found between antipsychotic use and level of cognitive impairment, basal activity of daily living disability and comorbidity. Multivariate analysis showed that the use of antipsychotics was highest in patients in the highest quartiles of Neuropsychiatric Inventory Scale score (III quartile, odds ratio: 1.63; 95% confidence interval: 1.19-2.23; IV quartile, odds ratio: 2.27; 95% confidence interval: 1.61-3.26).

    "129": "Scientific evidence for the viability of hypnosis as a treatment for pain has flourished over the past two decades (Rainville, Duncan, Price, Carrier and Bushnell, 1997; Montgomery, DuHamel and Redd, 2000; Lang and Rosen, 2002; Patterson and Jensen, 2003). However its widespread use has been limited by factors such as the advanced expertise, time and effort required by clinicians to provide hypnosis, and the cognitive effort required by patients to engage in hypnosis.The theory in developing virtual reality hypnosis was to apply three-dimensional, immersive, virtual reality technology to guide the patient through the same steps used when hypnosis is induced through an interpersonal process. Virtual reality replaces many of the stimuli that the patients have to struggle to imagine via verbal cueing from the therapist. The purpose of this paper is to explore how virtual reality may be useful in delivering hypnosis, and to summarize the scientific literature to date. We will also explore various theoretical and methodological issues that can guide future research.In spite of the encouraging scientific and clinical findings, hypnosis for analgesia is not universally used in medical centres. One reason for the slow acceptance is the extensive provider training required in order for hypnosis to be an effective pain management modality. Training in hypnosis is not commonly offered in medical schools or even psychology graduate curricula. Another reason is that hypnosis requires far more time and effort to administer than an analgesic pill or injection. Hypnosis requires training, skill and patience to deliver in medical centres that are often fast-paced and highly demanding of clinician time. Finally, the attention and cognitive effort required for hypnosis may be more than patients in an acute care setting, who may be under the influence of opiates and benzodiazepines, are able to impart. It is a challenge to make hypnosis a standard part of care in this environment.Over the past 25 years, researchers have been investigating ways to make hypnosis more standardized and accessible. There have been a handful of studies that have looked at the efficacy of using audiotapes to provide the hypnotic intervention (Johnson and Wiese, 1979; Hart, 1980; Block, Ghoneim, Sum Ping and Ali, 1991; Enqvist, Bjorklund, Engman and Jakobsson, 1997; Eberhart, Doring, Holzrichter, Roscher and Seeling, 1998; Perugini, Kirsch, Allen, et al., 1998; Forbes, MacAuley, Chiotakakou-Faliakou, 2000; Ghoneim, Block, Sarasin, Davis and Marchman, 2000). These studies have yielded mixed results. Generally, we can conclude that audio-taped hypnosis is more effective than no treatment at all, but less effective than the presence of a live hypnotherapist. Grant and Nash (1995) were the first to use computer-assisted hypnosis as a behavioural measure to assess hypnotizability. They used a digitized voice that guided subjects through a procedure and tailored software according to the subject's unique responses and reactions. However, it utilized conventional two-dimensional screen technology that required patients to focus their attention on a computer screen, making them vulnerable to any type of distraction that might enter the environment. Further, the two-dimensional technology did not present compelling visual stimuli for capturing the user's attention.",

Of the 10 studies that evaluated parents' anxiety, most did not find parental presence to be more effective than no parental presence, midazolam, or parental presence plus midazolam. Of the 11 studies that examined children's anxiety, most did not find parental presence to be more effective than no parental presence, midazolam, parental presence plus midazolam, or parental presence plus a video game.", 
    "133": "Contrary to popular belief, in most cases parental presence does not appear to alleviate parents' or children's anxiety. In the rare instances when it does seem to diminish parents' or children's anxiety, premedicating children with midazolam has shown to be a viable alternative. Other anxiety-reducing solutions, such as distracting children with video games, should also be considered.", 
    "134": "Given the prominent role of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) in the metabolism of drugs, it is critical to determine whether new chemical entities will be affected by the inhibition of this enzyme system and result in clinically relevant drug interactions. Ketoconazole interaction studies are frequently performed to determine a given compound's sensitivity to CYP3A metabolism. The present study evaluated whether probing a sensitive substrate (midazolam) with a potent inhibitor (ketoconazole) at earlier time points (days 1 or 2) might be used to reliably gauge the magnitude of a meaningful interaction. The geometric mean ratios (ketoconazole+midazolamday 5/ketoconazole+midazolamday 1 and ketoconazole+midazolamday 5/ketoconazole+midazolamday 2) for midazolam AUC0-infinity were 1.36 and 1.06 with corresponding 90% confidence intervals of (1.17, 1.57) and (0.83, 1.23), respectively. These findings suggest that short-term drug-drug interaction studies can predict the magnitude of change in AUC as reliably as studies using longer duration treatments.", 
    "135": "The purpose of the study was to assess the haemodynamic (blood pressure and heart rate) changes and stress responses (serum cortisol and serum amyloid A [SAA] concentrations) to surgery in piglets during total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and fentanyl. After preanaesthetic medication with intramuscular midazolam (0.5 mg/kg body mass), ketamine (10 mg/kg) and butorphanol (0.5 mg/kg) anaesthesia was induced in five piglets, with intravenous propofol (1 mg/kg) followed by tracheal intubation and mechanical lung ventilation. Soft tissue surgery was performed in the jugular and inguinal regions during TIVA with propofol (8 mg/kg/h) and fentanyl (35 microg/kg/h). Anaesthesia was maintained for 300 min after surgery as the piglets were the control group of a project involving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Mean plasma cortisol concentration decreased significantly (P<0.05) from 59+/-39.9 nmol/L (mean+/-1 SD) before surgery to 7.5+/-2.5 nmol/L 300 min after end of surgical procedure. The mean SAA concentrations increased over the same period from 1.6+/-2.3 microg/mL to 4.2+/-5.6 microg/mL without statistical significance. The baseline (presurgery) mean arterial pressure (MAP) was 72+/-9 mmHg compared with 72+/-11 mmHg 300 min after end of surgery. Neither heart rate nor lactate concentrations changed significantly over the same time points: heart rate was 104+/-11 and 103+/-15 beats/min whereas mean lactate concentrations were reduced from 1.14+/-0.45 mmol/L to 0.90+/-0.22 mmol/L. Haemodynamic stability, a decrease in serum cortisol and a non-statistically significant rise in mean SAA concentrations suggest that the anaesthetic described suppresses the stress response of piglets to surgery without adverse cardiovascular effects. Therefore, it may prove useful in cardiovascular research.",

Patients also completed a 100-mm VAS describing their level of nausea. Pain and nausea measurements were repeated 30 and 60 minutes after medication administration. Patients also completed the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) 30 and 60 minutes after medication administration. Descriptive statistics were used as appropriate.

    "141": "Carisoprodol is a frequently prescribed muscle relaxant. In recent years, this drug has been increasingly abused. The effects of carisoprodol have been attributed to its metabolite, meprobamate, a controlled substance that produces sedation via GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs). Given the structural similarities between carisoprodol and meprobamate, we used electrophysiological and behavioral approaches to investigate whether carisoprodol directly affects GABA(A)R function. In whole-cell patch-clamp studies, carisoprodol allosterically modulated and directly activated human alpha1beta2gamma2 GABA(A)R function in a barbiturate-like manner. At millimolar concentrations, inhibitory effects were apparent. Similar allosteric effects were not observed for homomeric rho1 GABA or glycine alpha1 receptors. In the absence of GABA, carisoprodol produced picrotoxin-sensitive, inward currents that were significantly larger than those produced by meprobamate, suggesting carisoprodol may directly produce GABAergic effects in vivo. When administered to mice via intraperitoneal or oral routes, carisoprodol elicited locomotor depression within 8 to 12 min after injection. Intraperitoneal administration of meprobamate depressed locomotor activity in the same time frame. In drug discrimination studies with carisoprodol-trained rats, the GABAergic ligands pentobarbital, chlordiazepoxide, and meprobamate each substituted for carisoprodol in a dose-dependent manner. In accordance with findings in vitro, the discriminative stimulus effects of carisoprodol were antagonized by a barbiturate antagonist, bemegride, but not by the benzodiazepine site antagonist, flumazenil. The results of our studies in vivo and in vitro collectively suggest the barbiturate-like effects of carisoprodol may not be due solely to its metabolite, meprobamate. Furthermore, the functional traits we have identified probably contribute to the abuse potential of carisoprodol.", 
    "142": "The purpose of this study was to identify the short-term safety and efficacy of treating patients with intravenous (i.v.) sodium valproate (VPA) for diazepam (DZP) refractory convulsive status epilepticus (CSE). We prospectively registered 48 patients with refractory CSE who were treated at West China Hospital with i.v. VPA (30mg/kg, 6mg/kg per hour) after a loading dose of i.v. DZP and intramuscular phenobarbitone (PBT) failed. VPA stopped seizures in 87.5% of patients within 1h, and patients regained baseline mental status within 1h of seizure cessation. CSE did not recur in patients within the next 12h, and no significant VPA-related systemic or local side effects were found during their hospital stay. In conclusion, this study suggests that i.v. VPA is a promising option for DZP refractory CSE in mainland China, since i.v. PBT is unavailable in most hospitals, and anesthesia is unacceptable to most of the Chinese population.", 
    "143": "Early detection of vascular complications following liver surgery is crucial. In the present study, intrahepatic microdialysis was used for continuous monitoring of porcine liver metabolism during occlusion of either the portal vein or the hepatic artery. Our aim was to assess whether microdialysis can be used to detect impaired vascular inflow by metabolic changes in the liver. Changes in metabolite concentrations in the hepatic interstitium were taken as markers for metabolic changes. After laparotomy, microdialysis catheters were introduced directly into the liver, enabling repeated measurements of local metabolism. Glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and glycerol were analyzed at bedside every 20 minutes, and the lactate/pyruvate ratio was calculated. In the arterial clamping group, the glucose, lactate, glycerol, and lactate/pyruvate ratio significantly increased during the 2-hour vessel occlusion and returned to baseline levels during the 3-hour reperfusion. In the portal occlusion group and in the control group, the measured metabolites were stable throughout the experiment. Our findings show that liver metabolism, as reflected by changes in the concentrations of glucose, lactate, and glycerol and in the lactate/pyruvate ratio, is markedly affected by occlusion of the hepatic artery. Surprisingly, portal occlusion resulted in no major metabolic changes. In conclusion, the microdialysis technique can detect and monitor arterial vascular complications of liver surgery, whereas potential metabolic changes in the liver induced by portal occlusion were not seen in the current study. Microdialysis may thus be suitable for use in liver surgery to monitor intrahepatic metabolic changes.",

Blood sugar, serum electrolytes and arterial blood gas analysis were normal. Postoperatively, there was no evidence of postictal phase, serum electrolytes and postoperative computerized tomographic scanning of the head were normal. Patient had uneventful recovery. The administration of propofol has been associated with abnormal movements collectively termed as seizure-like phenomenon. Despite the claims that propofol may have proconvalsant activity, there is significant amount of evidence to the contrary also. The pathophysiological mechanisms behind the neuroexcitatory symptoms with propofol are unknown. Propofol alters the conscious state, the transition from the conscious state to anesthesia or vice versa may be a particularly vulnerable period and may be prolonged after the end of propofol administration.",

After specimen preparation, samples were assayed by liquid-liquid or solid phase extraction with gas chromatographic and gas chromatographic mass spectrometric detection. The majority of decedents were white males with 28% of individuals between the ages of 41 to 50 years. The cause of death was drug intoxication in 22 cases. The most prevalent drugs detected in the blood males and females were opiates and bases. Morphine, codeine, and oxycodone were detected in bone, whereas 6-acetylmorphine and hydrocodone were absent. For alkaline extractable drugs, in only 57% of blood positive specimens, the corresponding bone was also positive. These included antidepressants and antihistamines. Diazepam and nordiazepam were detected in the bone of all blood positive cases. Bone concentrations were higher than blood levels. Benzoylecgonine was the most common cocaine analyte detected in bone. These data demonstrated that drugs may be detected in bone using current technologies and that in general concentrations were higher than those observed in corresponding blood specimens. A negative result in bone, however, should be interpreted with caution because multiple factors determine the deposition of a drug in this matrix.", 
    "158": "Postanoxic status epilepticus (PSE) is considered a predictor of fatal outcome and therefore not intensively treated; however, some patients have had favorable outcomes. The aim of this study was to identify favorable predictors for awakening beyond vegetative state in PSE.", 
    "159": "We studied six subjects treated with hypothermia improving beyond vegetative state after cerebral anoxia, despite PSE. They were among a cohort of patients treated for anoxic encephalopathy with therapeutic hypothermia in our institution between October 1999 and May 2006 (retrospectively, 3/107 patients) and June 2006 and May 2008 (prospectively, 3/74 patients). PSE was defined by clinical and EEG criteria. Outcome was assessed according to the Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC).", 
    "160": "All improving patients had preserved brainstem reflexes, cortical somatosensory evoked potentials, and reactive EEG background during PSE. Half of them had myoclonic PSE, while three had nonconvulsive PSE. In the prospective arm, 3/28 patients with PSE showed this clinical-electrophysiologic profile; all awoke. Treatments consisted of benzodiazepines, various antiepileptic drugs, and propofol. One subject died of pneumonia in a minimally conscious state, one patient returned to baseline (CPC1), three had moderate impairment (CPC2), and one remained dependent (CPC3). Patients with nonconvulsive PSE showed a better prognosis than subjects with myoclonic PSE (p = 0.042).", 
    "161": "Patients with postanoxic status epilepticus and preserved brainstem reactions, somatosensory evoked potentials, and EEG reactivity may have a favorable outcome if their condition is treated as status epilepticus.", 
    "162": "The present study was undertaken in order to evaluate feasibility of a limited sampling strategy (LSS) to predict the systemic clearance of midazolam (MDZ), which is a hepatic CYP3A activity phenotyping probe. Groups of rats pretreated with or without serial doses of ketoconazole, which is a selective inhibitor on CYP3A, were used as training set. Linear regression analysis and a Jack-knife validation procedure were performed based on plasma MDZ concentrations at specific time points after sublingual vein injection of MDZ to establish the most informative LSS equations for accurately estimating the clearance of MDZ. Another group of rats in the same setting was used as the validation set to confirm the individual values of estimated clearance (Clest) that were derived from the predictive equations developed in the training set. LSS that were derived from one, two or three sampling times, namely 90 min, 60-90 min, 30-60-90 min and 30-60-120 min, gave the best correlation and acceptable errors between the values of observed clearance (Clobs) and Clest and were chosen to evaluate hepatic CYP3A activity. Our results supported the hypothesis that using limited plasma sampling is simpler than the usual method of estimating CYP3A phenotyping by predicting the systemic clearance of MDZ when the hepatic activity of CYP3A is reduced in the rat. This experimental design offers opportunities to reduce animal use in the study of drug metabolism.", 
    "163": "Although the efficacy of midazolam in refractory status epilepticus and as a first-line agent in children with established status epilepticus has been reported, differences in starting doses, continuation method, timing of efficacy assessment, and discontinuation pose limitations in deriving a specific protocol for midazolam use. An audit of clinical experience with a protocol of midazolam as first-line agent for impending status epilepticus (defined as a continuous, generalized, convulsive seizure lasting >5 minutes) in 76 episodes of unprovoked convulsive status epilepticus in children 1-15 years old with treatment-refractory epilepsy demonstrated that: (1) repeated bolus midazolam 0.1mg/kg (every 5 minutes, maximum 5) controlled 91% of events; (2) three bolus doses controlled 89% of the episodes, with minimal chance of response beyond that; (3) treating impending status resulted in lower doses (mean 0.17 mg/kg) than reported and infrequent utilization of additional anticonvulsants (9%); and (4) adverse events were infrequent (respiratory depression 13%, assisted ventilation 3%).", 
    "164": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a major neurological emergency with an incidence of about 20/100,000 and a mortality between 3 and 40% depending on etiology, age, status type, and status duration. Generalized tonic-clonic SE, in particular, requires immediate, aggressive, and effective treatment to stop seizure activity, and to prevent neuronal damage and systemic complications and death. Benzodiazepines and phenytoin/fosphenytoin are traditionally used as first-line drugs and are effective in about 60% of all episodes. However, a notable portion of patients remain in SE. For those, narcotics and induction of general anesthesia are used as second-line treatment. Therefore, there is a need for more effective first-line treatment options. Recently, valproic acid was approved for the treatment of status epilepticus in some European countries, and two of the newer antiepileptic drugs have become available for intravenous use: Levetiracetam (LEV) and lacosamide (LCM) should be evaluated in prospective controlled trials as possible treatment options. Standardized protocols for the management of SE are useful to improve immediate care.", 
    "165": "A 7-day treatment with memantine (25 mg/kg, i.p.), a drug that is currently prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, increased the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and reduced the expression of the neuron-specific K(+)/Cl(-) co-transporter, KCC2, in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of mice. Knowing that KCC2 maintains low intracellular Cl(-) concentrations, which drive Cl(-) influx in response to GABA(A) receptor activation, we monitored the behavioural response to the GABA(A) receptor enhancer, diazepam, in mice pre-treated for 7 days with saline or 25 mg/kg of memantine. Memantine treatment substantially attenuated motor impairment induced by an acute challenge with diazepam (6 mg/kg, i.p.), as assessed by the rotarod test and the horizontal wire test. We suggest that a prolonged treatment with memantine induces changes in the activity of GABA(A) receptors that might contribute to the therapeutic and/or toxic effects of the drug.",

    "167": "To provide the best available evidence supporting the pharmacotherapy of bipolar depression.", 
    "168": "A systematic review was conducted, focusing on randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses.", 
    "169": "Despite FDA approval of both the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination and quetiapine for the treatment of acute bipolar depression, independent RCTs (i.e., not trials conducted 'under the umbrella' of a drug company) have not found any drug to have antidepressant effects similar to those seen in unipolar depression. A practice-based suggestion, valuable for both short- and long-term treatment, might be to have a background of mood stabilizers and to add drugs, following one of several treatment options, trusting to find a drug with a degree of effectiveness by trial and error. The list of drugs that could be used would include all the current antidepressants, the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination and probably quetiapine too. Special features and situations might also influence treatment options.", 
    "170": "The primary purpose of this study was to assess the overall clinical profile of menopausal women complaining of insomnia who were referred to a sleep laboratory.", 
    "171": "A total of 206 menopausal women who had complaints related to insomnia were interviewed. Each participant completed a questionnaire in order to obtain data on general health, menopausal status, medications, and sleep patterns.", 
    "172": "The mean age of the participants was 55.9 years. Clinical profiles revealed that the most prevalent health problems were systemic arterial hypertension (33.9%) and osteoporosis (19%), though there was no association between insomnia and incidence of chronic disease. Our data demonstrate an overall prevalence of insomnia of 4-5 times a week in 62% of the women, with 68.9% complaining of hot flashes. However, there was no association between hot flashes and frequency of insomnia across the menopausal transition period. Only 7% of women had already undergone polysomnography. Less than 5% of the participants were undergoing treatment for menopause, while 8% were taking benzodiazepines for sleep problems.", 
    "173": "This study provides evidence that insomnia in postmenopausal women was not associated with incidence of chronic disease. In addition, the majority of the participants were not undergoing treatment for menopause or for sleep disturbance.", 
    "174": "Neonatal seizures represent a major challenge among the epilepsies vis-\u00e0-vis seizure classification, electroclinical correlation, inherent excitability of neocortex, ontogenic characteristics of neurotransmitter receptors, and responsiveness to standard antiepileptic drugs. Each of these factors renders neonatal seizures more difficult to treat, and therapy has been a vexing area for recent advances in this seizure category. Conversely, specific metabolic disorders have very special therapeutic considerations in the clinical setting of neonatal seizures which require a high index of clinical suspicion and rapid intervention for a successful outcome. The prototype is pyridoxine dependency, although pyridoxal 5'-phosphate dependency is a recently recognized but treatable neonatal epilepsy that deserves earmarked distinction. Clinicians must remain vigilant for these possibilities, including atypical cases where apparent seizure-free intervals may occur. Folinic acid-dependent seizures are allelic with pyridoxine dependency. Serine-dependent seizures and glucose transporter deficiency may present with neonatal seizures and have specific therapy. A vital potassium channel regulated by serum ATP/ADP ratios in the pancreas and brain may be mutated with a resultant neuroendocrinopathy characterized by development delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes (DEND). This requires oral hypoglycaemic therapy, and not insulin, for neurological responsiveness. The startle syndrome of hyperekplexia, which mimics neonatal epilepsy, has been associated with laryngospasm and sudden death but is treated with benzodiazepines.", 
    "175": "Patients with impaired ability to understand and communicate can be difficult to manage perioperatively. They frequently require lateral thinking on the part of the anesthesiologists to make the induction process as smooth as possible. We present a case of a severely autistic and violent patient scheduled for dental rehabilitation under general anesthesia. A combination of oral ketamine and midazolam was mixed in the beverage Dr Pepper to mask the taste and the appearance of the drugs. The unique flavor of Dr Pepper is well suited to increase the palatibility and the acceptability of medications in children and patients with developmental delay.",

    "179": "The effect of oral ramosetron 0.1 mg was comparable to that of IV ramosetron 0.3 mg on the prevention of PONV in women undergoing gynecological laparoscopy with TIVA. Both the oral and IV forms were effective at preventing PONV during the first 1 h after surgery.", 
    "180": "It is still controversial whether an electroencephalogram could be a useful monitor of sedation levels. The present study was performed to compare the bispectral index (BIS) and the auditory evoked potentials index (AAI) during light sedation with propofol infusion in spinal anesthesia.", 
    "181": "Eighty patients, aged 20 to 70 years, scheduled for surgery of the lower extremities under spinal anesthesia were assigned to one of four groups (20 patients each). Patients in the AAI propofol and BIS propofol groups were sedated with propofol infusion at an initial rate of 2 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1). Propofol infusion was controlled to try to keep the observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAAS) scale at 3 or 4. Patients in the AAI control and BIS control groups did not receive propofol.", 
    "182": "The OAAS scales and the AAI or BIS decreased significantly in all groups during surgery, while the decrease was larger in the AAI propofol and BIS propofol groups. The AAI was significantly lower along with lower OAAS scales. There was no overlap in the AAI between OAAS scale 3 and scale 5 in the AAI propofol group, while in the BIS propofol group, no difference was observed in the BIS among OAAS scales 2, 3, 4, and 5.",

    "185": "Fifteen patients with depressive episodes of bipolar disorder and nonbipolar recurrent depression and patients who underwent a series of three consecutive ECT treatments were studied as a crossover design. In this double-blind and placebo-controlled study, patients were randomly allocated to receive either dexmedetomidine, 0.5 microg x kg(-1) (group Dex), midazolam, 0.025 mg x kg(-1) (group Dor), or saline (group C) in a total volume of 20 ml given intravenously 10 min before the induction of anesthesia. Propofol was administered until the patients did not respond to a verbal command.",

    "188": "During the last 2 years, the knowledge on the metabolic pathway of tetrazepam, a muscle relaxant drug, was expanded by the fact that diazepam was identified as a degradation product of tetrazepam. The present study demonstrates that this metabolic conversion, recently discovered by in vivo studies, can also be predicted on the basis of a purely instrumental method, consisting of an electrochemical cell (EC) coupled to online liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS). By implementing a new electrochemical cell type into the EC-LC-MS set-up and by an enhanced oxidation potential range up to 2V, one limitation of the electrochemical metabolism simulation, the hydroxylation of alkanes and alkenes, has been overcome. Instead of commonly used flow-through cell with a porous glassy carbon working electrode, a wall-jet cell with exchangeable electrode material was used for this study. Thereby, the entire metabolic pathway of tetrazepam, in particular including the hydroxylation of the tetrazepam cyclohexenyl moiety, was simulated. The electrochemical results were not only compared to microsomal incubations, but also to in vivo experiments, by analysing urine samples from a patient after tetrazepam delivery. For structure elucidation of the detected metabolites, MS/MS experiments were performed. The comparison of electrochemistry to in vitro as well as to in vivo experiments underlines the high potential of electrochemistry as a fast screening tool in the prediction of metabolic transformations in drug development.", 
    "189": "Efficient synthesis of 3,4-diazabenzo[b]tropone was first achieved utilizing 4pi-8pi sequential electrocyclic reactions of functionalized benzocyclobutenone derivatives. These compounds are highly electron deficient and readily form amine adducts at ambient temperature. Furthermore, gentle heating resulted in quantitative nitrogen extrusion to produce indenone derivatives. These diazabenzotropones were found to exhibit potent apoptosis-inducing activity against human lymphoma cells. Thus, novel amine-catalyzed nitrogen extrusion reactions and interesting bioactivities were found to be characteristic of these novel diazabenzotropone compounds.",

The bioavailability, dose proportionality and tolerability of a supersaturated intranasal formulation of diazepam (DZP) solubilized in a glycofurol-water cosolvent system was investigated. Eight healthy volunteers were randomized into a single-blind, three-way crossover study to compare 5 and 10mg intranasal DZP doses of the investigational formulation with a 5mg dose of a DZP solution (DZP injectable, 5mg/mL) administered intravenously. Treatments were separated by a two-week washout period. Plasma samples for DZP analysis were collected pre-dose and at regular intervals up to 48h post-dose and assayed by HPLC. Visual analog scales (VAS) were used to assess tolerability (1-tolerable; 10-extremely intolerable) and pain (1-no pain; 4-extreme pain) at predefined time points. Following the 5 and 10mg doses, the median t(max) were 20 and 30min and the mean C(max) were 134.3+/-62 and 247.6+/-61ng/mL. Estimated bioavailability was 75% for both doses. Pain scores of 2 and 2.3 were observed following the 5 and 10mg doses; tolerability scores were 4.4 and 4.7. Pain and tolerability scores returned to baseline within 10h. Our formulation provided reasonable bioavailability, but was not well tolerated.", 
    "207": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) represents the procedure of choice for detection of anatomical lesions in epilepsy. Vascular malformations in central nervous system, such as cavernoma, can cause symptomatic epilepsy. We describe a case of ictal aphasia as manifestation of a partial status epilepticus probably due to a mutual interaction between a recent bleeding cavernoma and a concomitant reduction of antiepileptic treatment in a long-lasting misdiagnosed symptomatic epilepsy. We conclude that MRI is a mandatory diagnostic method to identify structural abnormalities underlying epilepsy in all patients affected by recurrent focal seizures independent of the duration of epilepsy."
