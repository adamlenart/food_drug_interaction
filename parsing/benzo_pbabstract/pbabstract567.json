    "1": "Sodium fusidate, an antibiotic used in staphylococcal infections, is strongly bound to human serum albumin, competitively with bilirubin. It is given in molar amounts sufficient to occupy a considerable fraction of circulating albumin. In order to avoid a risk of bilirubin encephalopathy, induced by displacement of bilirubin, fusidate should be given with caution to newborn infants, particularly if patients are prematurely born, icteric or acidotic. Fusidate does not interfere with albumin binding of warfarin or diazepam.", 
    "2": "In modelling of neuroses, successive stages of development of this pathology were observed in dogs. The first stage is characterized by circular disturbances of conditioned activity, vegetative shifts of compensatory character and intensification of individual characteristics of behaviour. At the second stage, parallel with sharp disturbances of conditioned reflexes and with vegetative dystonia, a distortion of emotional reactions was observed in dogs. It is essential that resumption of neurotization episodes in experiments on dogs with the second stage of disease promoted a development of depressive-like states. Diazepam corrected the behavioural and vegetative shifts at the first stage of neurosis. Non-typical antidepressants eliminated the manifestation of symptoms complex of the disease, especially at prolonged treatment.", 
    "3": "Experiments were performed, using electrophysiological techniques, to investigate the effects and interactions of diazepam with commonly-used neuromuscular blocking agents and cholinergic agonists in chick and rat isolated nerve-muscle preparations. The results showed that in low concentrations (3.4-340 mumol/l, i.e. 1-100 micrograms ml-1) diazepam increased, in a dose-dependent manner, the twitch contractions in response to motor nerve stimulation of the chick and rat. High concentrations of diazepam (greater than 340 mumol/l) decreased the twitch tension and greatly reduced the contractures produced by acetylcholine (ACh) and tetraethylammonium (TEA) in the chick skeletal muscle. However, in the concentration range studied (close to a therapeutic dose of 0.15 mg kg-1), diazepam had no significant effect on the neuromuscular blockade produced either by tubocurarine or by succinylcholine. It was concluded that diazepam may either increase or decrease the twitch tension, in rat and chick skeletal muscle, the effect being dependent on the concentrations used. The mechanism of action of diazepam may depend on an increasing intracellular calcium concentration, which is directly involved in the increase of the twitch tension by low concentrations of diazepam.", 
    "4": "N-Allyl substituted derivatives of pentobarbital were prepared, and their pharmacological activities (hypnotic activity and anticonvulsant activity against pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures) were investigated with single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection using mice. N-Monoallylpentobarbital (MAPB) was found to possess hypnotic activity [HD50 = 77.5(64.3-93.4) mg/kg, i.p.] and anticonvulsant activity [PTZ-ED50 = 23.5(14.2-38.9)mg/kg, i.p.]. N,N'-Diallylpentobarbital (DAPB) was devoid of not only the hypnotic activity of parent compound but also the anticonvulsant activity. The interaction of these N-allyl derivatives with barbiturates (pentobarbital (PB), barbital (B), phenobarbital (PheB), amobarbital (AB) and thiopental (TP] or diazepam (DZ) was further studied to characterize as antagonist or agonist. MAPB and DAPB (5-160mg/kg, i.p.) showed potent prolonging effect on PB-induced sleeping time and time of their peak effect was observed. The prolonging effects of these allyl compounds on PB-induced sleep were dose-dependent. Both compounds (80mg/kg, i.p.) also prolonged sleeping time induced by PheB, AB and TP. Although DAPB showed prolonging effect on B-induced sleep at a time interval 1 min, the compound shortened the sleeping time at 15 and 60 min. DAPB (5, 10 and 80mg/kg, i.p.) enhanced the DZ-induced motor incoordination.", 
    "5": "The data for this cross-sectional survey were obtained from a stratified probability sample of 510 residents in South-Verona during the period May-June 1980. The two-week prevalence of psychotropic drug consumption was found to be 13%. The prevalence was higher in women (18%) than in men (9%). The most commonly consumed category of psychotropic drugs were the benzodiazepines, which accounted for 70% of all the psychotropic drugs consumed by women and 85% of those consumed by men. Using a logistic analysis, a strong association between drug consumption and minor psychiatric morbidity, as indicated by the GHQ scores, was found for both sexes, a finding not significantly different from that found in the West London study by Murray et al. (1981). Alcohol abuse in men was less prevalent in the youngest age-group. Thirty-three (19%) of the male GHQ low scorers were alcohol abusers, compared with 12 (40%) of the high scorers. No significant association was found between psychotropic drug consumption and alcohol abuse in men.",

    "7": "The anticonvulsant efficacy of the benzodiazepine flurazepam was tested in rats treated with a convulsant dose of either picrotoxin or 3-mercaptopropionic acid. Against picrotoxin, a significant anticonvulsant effect was observed in the range of 30-60 mg/kg, i.p. Epileptogenicity increased as doses of flurazepam were increased from 60 to 200 mg/kg, and at a dose of 400 mg/kg all subjects died. In similar tests, the benzodiazepines clonazepam and triazolam produced only dose-dependent increases in anticonvulsant efficacy. Flurazepam also proved to be an effective anticonvulsant in tests against 3-mercaptopropionic acid. The results of this study provide further evidence that benzodiazepines have varying degrees of epileptogenicity.", 
    "8": "Trazodone, its active metabolite 1-(m-chlorophenyl)piperazine (mCPP) and two isomers of mCPP were tested for affinity to the binding sites for [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FLU) and [3H]p-aminoclonidine ([3H]pAC) in the frontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus of the rat. When tested at the binding site for [3H]flunitrazepam, trazodone showed an average IC50 of 1.7 mM in all three regions of the brain while mCPP yielded an average IC50 of 0.36 mM. These same two compounds, when tested at the binding site for [3H]p-aminoclonidine, resulted in an average IC50 of 4.5 microM for trazodone and 0.6 microM for mCPP. When plasma values of trazodone and mCPP in the rat were similar to those obtained in patients given therapeutic doses, the concentrations of trazodone were found to be between 6 and 7 microM and between 2 and 3 microM for mCPP in the same brain regions of the brain used in the binding assays. Thus, a sufficient concentration of trazodone and mCPP can accumulate in brain tissue to displace approx. 50% of the [3H]p-aminoclonidine from its binding site but very little [3H]flunitrazepam from its binding site. These results, combined with the reported anxiolytic effects of the alpha-2 agonist, clonidine and the noradrenergic hyperactivity theory of anxiety, indicate that the mechanism of the anxiolytic activity of trazodone, may be a direct action on the central alpha-2 binding site.",

    "12": "This study evaluated the antinociceptive effects of several opiate and nonopiate analgesics in the rhesus monkey using a discrete trial shock titration paradigm. Morphine sulfate (1, 5 and 10 mg/kg i.m.) and codeine sulfate (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg i.m.) produced a significant and dose-dependent increase in mean shock threshold that was not accompanied by a significant increase in mean response latency. The mean number of shocks terminated was significantly decreased at the highest dose of each opiate. Aspirin (100 and 300 mg/kg p.o.) or ibuprofen (200 mg/kg p.o.) did not significantly increase mean shock threshold or mean response latency or decrease mean number of shocks terminated. However, 6 mg/kg i.m. of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo [5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol produced a significant increase in mean shock threshold and mean response latency with no significant effect on mean number of shocks terminated. The absence of any effects of a 2-mg/kg dose of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol and the severe side effects produced by 10 mg/kg prevented determination of its dose-response relationship. Diazepam (0.5, 2 and 8 mg/kg i.m.) produced a significant, dose-dependent increase in mean shock threshold and a significant increase in mean response latency with no consistent or significant effect on mean number of shocks terminated. Doses of 2 and 8 mg/kg of diazepam also produced signs of ataxia. These results suggest that the discrete trial shock titration paradigm is suitable for demonstration of the antinociceptive effects of opiate and certain nonopiate analgesics, but not nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics in the rhesus monkey.", 
    "13": "Dose-effect curves were determined for the effects of the opioid antagonist, naltrexone, on lever-pressing responses of squirrel monkeys maintained under a 30-response fixed-ratio schedule of food presentation. Cumulative doses of naltrexone up to 3 mg/kg i.m. had little or no effect on fixed-ratio responding, whereas higher doses reduced responding in all monkeys. After initial determinations of the dose-effect curve for naltrexone, repeated daily injections of high doses of naltrexone resulted in enhanced sensitivity to its behavioral effects. The cumulative dose-effect curve for naltrexone determined after termination of daily injections was shifted more than 3-fold to the left. In these same monkeys, the dose-effect curve for naltrexone methobromide, a quaternary derivative of naltrexone with limited access to the central nervous system, was similar to the initial dose-effect curve for naltrexone. Chlordiazepoxide given 1 hr before the experimental session shifted the naltrexone dose-effect curve back toward its initial position before the regimen of daily injections, but had no systematic effect on the dose-effect curve for quaternary naltrexone. Enhanced sensitivity to the behavioral effects of naltrexone in these experiments appears to depend on a central component of action and is attenuated by chlordiazepoxide.", 
    "14": "Paracetamol 20 mg kg-1 dissolved in 200 ml of water was given by mouth to seven healthy volunteers, together with a single i.v. dose of diazepam 0.2 mg kg-1 or saline 0.04 ml kg-1. This study demonstrated that the rate of paracetamol absorption was not significantly changed by diazepam, indicating that there was no delay in gastric emptying attributable to diazepam per se.", 
    "15": "In contrast to reports of the untoward hemodynamic effects of fentanyl and diazepam in intact organisms, we found that neither a bolus of 100 micrograms/kg fentanyl nor the addition of intravenous doses of diazepam, up to and including 1 mg/kg (cumulative dose 2 mg/kg) caused cardiovascular depression in 13 anesthetized dogs after elimination of their sympathetic and parasympathetic tone. There were no significant changes in mean arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, heart rate, peak left ventricular dP/dt, cardiac filling pressures, or systemic vascular resistance. Rapid bolus injection of 3 mg/kg diazepam (cumulative dose 5 mg/kg) caused a significant (P less than 0.05) but transient (time to 50% recovery less than 2 min) decrease in systemic vascular resistance, blood pressure, and dP/dt. When corrected for pressure changed (dP/dt divided by simultaneous left ventricular pressure), the decrease in dP/dt did not attain statistical significance, nor did changes in cardiac output or filling pressures, even after this large dose of diazepam. We conclude that previously reported decreases in hemodynamic function in subjects with intact autonomic function after fentanyl alone, or after the combination of fentanyl and diazepam, are indirect in nature, that is, are caused by a centrally mediated decrease in vasoregulatory (mainly sympathetic) outflow from the central nervous system.", 
    "16": "24 patients, ages ranging from 6 months to 14.5 years, affected by epilepsy resistant to common antiepileptic drugs were studied. CDDZ was administered intravenously at doses from 0.5 to 2 mg and EEG was recorded for 45 min (15 min before and 30 after drug administration). In 20 patients the EEGraphic paroxystic activity was modified: in 5 cases a total remission and in 2 cases a partial remission were obtained; in 13 cases the EEG alterations were reduced. Myoclonic petit mal and organic focal seizures were the forms of epilepsy showing the best responses to CDDZ administration. The drug was well tolerated and only in two cases was persistent drowsiness observed for more than six hours, possibly due to concomitant barbiturate therapy.", 
    "17": "Neurobiological changes induced by social isolation of mice are affected by several drugs in different manner. Lithium is able to prevent changes in head-twitches seen after short term isolation as well as enhanced aggressivity and enhanced spontaneous locomotion demonstrable after long term isolation. Similar to lithium are the effects of carbamazepine, whereas the other tested substances: Ca-valproate, diazepam, desipramine, clomipramine as well as piracetam, methylglucaminorotate and meclofenoxate show different effects. The model of social isolation is discussed in view of its ability to differentiate the qualities of chronic drug administration during functional dynamic changes of the CNS in animals.", 
    "18": "Concentrations of diazepam (DZ) and desmethyldiazepam (DMDZ) were determined quantitatively in the brain, skeletal muscle, heart, liver, lung, fat, adrenal gland, and kidney in 14 autopsied patients who had been treated with DZ or clorazepate (a DMDZ prodrug) during their hospital course. To facilitate interpatient comparisons, all tissue concentrations from the same patient were normalized as ratios to the concentration of DZ or DMDZ found in that patient's skeletal muscle. Tissue uptake ratios were not influenced by gender or chronicity of dosage. Distribution equilibrium was reached in at least two hours. Tissue uptake ratios differed considerably among tissues for DZ and DMDZ. Mean (+/- SE) DZ uptake ratio was highest for adrenal gland (12.1 +/- 5.9), liver (5.9 +/- 1.9), heart (4.3 +/- 1.0), and kidney (4.0 +/- 1.0), with lower values for lung (2.1 +/- 0.5), fat (2.2 +/- 0.4), and brain (1.9 +/- 0.4). Similar patterns were observed for DMDZ, except for significantly lower fat uptake. Extrapolating to an average body composition for a 70 kg man with 16% body fat, the largest fractions of total body stores of DZ would be found in muscle (42%), fat (35%), and liver (12%), with smaller stores in brain (4.3%), lung (3.3%), heart (1.7%), kidney (2.0%), and adrenal gland (0.24%).", 
    "19": "Intraperitoneal and intracerebral injections of methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta CCM) and intracerebral injections of RO 15-1788 were given to rats. The performance of the rats in the social interaction test was measured to determine if changes in social interaction induced by beta CCM were mediated in part by the nucleus raph\u00e9 dorsalis (NRD). Intraperitoneal injections of beta CCM, 2 and 4 mg kg-1, reduced social interaction. Intracerebral microinjections of beta CCM (10-0.1 ng in 0.5 microliter) into the NRD reduced social interaction. Injections outside the NRD did not have this effect. Intracerebral microinjections of RO 15-1788 (1 ng in 0.5 microliters) into the NRD had no effect when given alone, but blocked the reduction in social interaction caused by intracerebral or intraperitoneal injections of beta CCM. No effect was observed when R 15-1788 was microinjected into sites outside the NRD. Changes in social interaction may reflect changes in anxiety. The NRD may be one of the important sites for the expression of the anxiogenic actions of beta CCM.", 
    "20": "Dogs, surgically implanted with a chronic gastric fistula, were chronically dosed with N-desmethyldiazepam (32 mg/kg/day) in four divided doses to attain N-desmethyldiazepam plasma levels comparable to those observed in dogs dependent on diazepam (60 mg/kg/day). The time course of N-desmethyldiazepam abstinence was studied, beginning not less than 2 weeks after stabilization levels had been achieved. The abstinence syndrome observed after abrupt discontinuation of N-desmethyldiazepam was similar to the diazepam abstinence syndrome but differed in several important aspects. In diazepam-dependent dogs, there was a short burst of tremor very early in withdrawal (approximately 1-2 hr after the last dose of diazepam) that was not seen in N-desmethyldiazepam-dependent dogs. Signs of abstinence such as tremor, hot foot walking and twitches and jerks were more frequently observed in N-desmethyldiazepam-dependent dogs than in diazepam-dependent dogs as were decreases in food and water intake and in body weight. The overall intensity of abstinence, as measured by the Diazepam Withdrawal Abstinence Scale, was greater in N-desmethyldiazepam-dependent dogs than in dogs dependent on either lorazepam or diazepam. Plasma levels of N-desmethyldiazepam and oxazepam were nearly equal in dogs dependent on diazepam or on N-desmethyldiazepam and were 4 to 10 times greater than the plasma levels of diazepam or lorazepam in diazepam- or lorazepam-dependent dogs, respectively. Furthermore, the plasma levels of N-desmethyldiazepam and oxazepam declined much more slowly than the levels of diazepam and lorazepam. These results suggest that physical dependence on diazepam is caused by the accumulation and actions of N-desmethyldiazepam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "The anticonvulsant long-term efficacy of diazepam was studied in amygdala-kindled rats. The drug was administered three times daily at doses of 5 mg/kg i.p. for 2 weeks in fully kindled animals. The severity of the kindled seizures was markedly reduced throughout the period of treatment, while tolerance developed to the effect of diazepam on seizure latency and duration and, less marked, on duration of amygdala afterdischarges. Concomitant determination of plasma concentrations of diazepam and its major metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, showed that diazepam increased during the 2 weeks of treatment, suggesting that the observed tolerance was not metabolic but functional in nature. After cessation of treatment, there was no clear indication for withdrawal symptoms except a significant increase in kindled seizure duration after 2 days. The data demonstrate that amygdala-kindled rats are a useful model to study the long-term efficacy of anticonvulsant drugs.", 
    "22": "Four consecutive trials were undertaken to study lorazepam at each of three dosage levels and diphenhydramine when used in combination with iv metoclopramide and dexamethasone in patients receiving cisplatin at 120 mg/m2. The combination containing diphenhydramine had been the most effective treatment identified in prior trials. Earlier studies have found lorazepam to be a useful adjunct to other antiemetic agents. Sixty-five patients who had never received chemotherapy or antiemetics were directly observed in the hospital for 24 hours following cisplatin. Overall, 56% of the patients experienced no emesis and 78.5% of the patients had two or fewer vomiting episodes during the study period. No significant differences were noted in the number of patients who experienced no emesis or two or fewer episodes among the four trials. More sedation was seen with the lorazepam-containing regimens; other side effects were similar in type and severity. The trial using the highest dose of lorazepam (1.5 mg/m2) demonstrated significantly greater patient satisfaction (P = 0.039) and less anxiety during therapy (P = 0.02) when compared with the diphenhydramine combination. We conclude that combinations of iv metoclopramide plus dexamethasone with either diphenhydramine or lorazepam are well tolerated and effective in controlling cisplatin-induced emesis. The regimens containing lorazepam produced better subjective evaluations, and the combination using the highest lorazepam dose tested showed superior patient satisfaction and less anxiety during therapy.", 
    "23": "Muscarinic receptors in human tracheal smooth muscle were characterized by radioligand binding and functional studies. Specific [3H]-(-)-quinuclidinylbenzilate ([3H]-(-)-QNB) binding to tracheal smooth muscle membranes was reversible, stereoselective and of high affinity (Kd = 47 +/- 4 pmol/l; RT = 920 +/- 120 fmol/g tissue). Inhibition of specific [3H]-(-)-QNB binding by the M-1 selective antagonist pirenzepine was found to occur at relative high concentrations classifying the muscarinic receptor population as belonging to the M-2 subclass. Inhibition of specific [3H]-(-)-QNB binding by muscarinic agonists revealed the presence of high and low affinity sites in nearly equal proportions. 5'-Guanylylimidodiphosphate converted high affinity sites into low affinity sites although its effect was minimal. Log dose-contraction curves of methacholine had Hill coefficients of 1.10 +/- 0.04 with pD2-values of 6.75 +/- 0.02. Inhibition of specific [3H]-(-)-QNB binding by methacholine, however, was best described by a two binding site model with pKi-values considerably lower. The difference between these affinity values points to the presence of substantial receptor reserve.", 
    "24": "In a prospective randomised study, 289 children admitted consecutively to hospital with their first febrile seizure were allocated, by date of admission, to short term diazepam prophylaxis (n = 152) or to no prophylaxis (n = 137) and followed for 18 months. In untreated children, five major risk factors for recurrent febrile convulsions were identified: age 15 months or less at the time of the first febrile seizure, epilepsy in first degree relatives, febrile convulsions in first degree relatives, a first complex febrile seizure, and day nursery care. The 18 month recurrence rate was 80 to 100% if three to five risk factors were present, 50% if two factors were identified, 25% where one factor was found, and 12% if there were no predictors. During prophylaxis the recurrence rate was uniformly low (mean 12%) in all risk groups. In high (three or more factors) and intermediate (two factors) risk children prophylaxis provided effective seizure control and reduced the recurrence rate from 80%, or more, to 12% and 50% to 12%, respectively. In children with one risk factor 50% of all recurrences were prevented (25% to 12%). Prophylaxis was ineffective in very low risk children (12% to 12%).",

Predictors of improvement included low educational level, lack of previous treatment, presence of precipitating stress, low occupational and/or family adjustment, low levels of trait anxiety, and high levels of state anxiety.", 
    "27": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIAs), administered preoperatively and for three days postoperatively, were evaluated for reduction in the occurrence of venous complications following conscious sedation with intravenous diazepam.

    "28": "The sedative and cardiovascular effects of rectally administered diazepam (0.6 mg/kg) were compared to placebo in uncooperative children who required sedation during dental treatment. Twelve healthy preschool children, who required amalgam restorations, were treated during two standardized restorative appointments in a double-blind, crossover study. Blood pressure and pulse were obtained during four specified intervals during the appointment. The behavior of the children during the treatment visits was videotaped and later statistically analyzed using a kinesics/vocalization instrument. Behavioral ratings of cooperation were significantly improved during the treatment visit following diazepam. All interfering bodily movements, patient vocalizations and operator commands for the diazepam group were reduced significantly (p\u22640.0001). No significant differences were observed for noninterfering behavioral response. Rectally administered diazepam did not alter blood pressure or pulse significantly in these sedated children when compared to the placebo. These findings indicate that rectal diazepam is an effective sedative agent with minimal effect on the cardiovascular system for the management of the young pediatric dental patient.", 
    "29": "In 12 healthy volunteers, a rectosigmoid motility index (RSMI) was measured when either placebo, 0.5 mg atropine, or 5 mg pirenzepine was given intravenously as a single dose, double-blind, in random order after a control period of 30 min. Compared with the control period, atropine gave a significant decrease of the RSMI during the entire recorded period of 90 min, whereas pirenzepine inhibited RSMI only during the first two 15-min periods. In another series of experiments, gastrointestinal transit was assessed by means of a radiographic marker method. In healthy volunteers, gastrointestinal transit was estimated (n = 20) and gastric secretion was measured (basally and after modified sham feeding; n = 10) during oral medication with placebo, 50 mg pirenzepine twice daily, or 17.5 mg benzilonium bromide twice daily. In 10 of the volunteers gastrointestinal transit was also estimated with 35 mg benzilonium bromide twice daily, and in the other 10 volunteers with 0.6 mg L-hyoscyamine twice daily. The number of retained markers was significantly lower during pirenzepine than during L-hyoscyamine treatment. Neither dose of benzilonium bromide changed the transit of markers. Compared with non-selective antimuscarinics, the effect of pirenzepine was differential: with equipotently acid-reducing doses the decrease of the RSMI after pirenzepine lasted shorter and gastrointestinal transit was accelerated.", 
    "30": "Rats, given CC14 (6670 mg/Kg, sc), exhibited a significant increase in SGPT (425.7 +/- 51.3 mU/ml), together with impaired pharmacokinetics of intravenous diazepam (t beta 1/2: 53.87 h; AUC: 101.05 micrograms/ml/h) when compared with saline treated animal (SGPT: 33.6 +/- 3.8 mU/ml; t beta 1/2: 2.087 h; AUC: 1.37 micrograms/ml/h). FCE 20700 (5 micrograms/ml, sc) did not change, by itself, either SGPT or diazepam pharmacokinetic parameters, but significantly antagonized the changes induced by CC14 (SGPT: 45.3 +/- 5.3 mU/ml; t beta 1/2: 0.167 h; AUC: 2.426 micrograms/ml/h). Further support to this cytoprotective effects was given by histological examination of the livers. Data indicate that this new prostaglandin E2 derivative might be useful in patients with liver failure.", 
    "31": "In normolipidaemic young rats the intraperitoneal administration of diazepam (10 mg/kg) induced a marked fall of the total serum lipids and total cholesterol. A dose of 5 mg/kg brought about an increase of HDL2 lipoprotein fraction and an elevation of the HDL2/HDL2.HDL3 ratio. Margarine administration elicited a significant augmentation of the total serum lipids and a reduction of the HDL2/HDL2.HDL3 ratio. The intraperitoneal injection of diazepam in margarine-treated rats brought about a decrease of total serum lipids and total cholesterol, (when compared to the margarine values), an obvious elevation of the HDL2 fraction and of HDL2/HDL2.HDL3 ratio. The LDL1 (beta) fraction was decreased. These data confirm our earlier findings which show that diazepam improves the HDL cholesterol/total cholesterol ratio.", 
    "32": "The dose-response curves for the anticonvulsive activity of sulfated and nonsulfated cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8-SE and CCK-8-NS) against picrotoxin-induced (6 mg/kg SC) seizures were assessed either following or without pretreatment with a single high dose of CCK-8-SE or CCK-8-NS, to examine acute tolerance to the effect after IP injections in mice. As CCK-8-SE or CCK-8-NS pretreatment, a 1.6 mumole/kg dose was injected 2 hr prior to the second injection. No acute tolerance to the anticonvulsive activity was demonstrated, and CCK-8-NS pretreatment significantly potentiated its own anticonvulsive activity. Chronic (8-day) daily treatment with a 0.16 mumole/kg dose of CCK-8-SE or CCK-8-NS antagonized seizures by picrotoxin, presumably in a cumulative manner. To investigate the interactions of CCK octapeptides with other anticonvulsive agents, picrotoxin-induced seizures were antagonized with several doses of diazepam following or without acute, high-dose pretreatment with CCK-8-SE or CCK-8-NS. The two octapeptides only slightly modified the activity of diazepam: CCK-8-SE pretreatment displayed a tendency to antagonize it, while CCK-8-NS pretreatment to potentiate it. The results suggest that multiple treatment with CCK-8 induces sensitization of CCK receptors mediating anticonvulsive activity.", 
    "33": "In experiments on mice the existence of common mechanisms of action was revealed in picrotoxin and kynurenine and quinolinic acid. Picrotoxin selectively potentiated convulsions induced by kynurenine and quinolinic acid and the antagonists of these endogenous convulsants--picolinic, kynurenic and xanthurenic acids--selectively antagonized picrotoxin convulsions. GABA-ergic preparations, effective in kynurenine convulsions and the anticonvulsants diazepam and phenobarbital, were highly effective against picrotoxin-induced convulsions also. Puphemid and trimethin indicated for treating petit mal epilepsy, proved ineffective. The obtained data suggest the possibility of action of kynurenine and quinolinic acid via picrotoxin-sensitive subunits of the benzodiazepine-GABA-receptor-ionophore complex.", 
    "34": "The influences of morphine sulphate, morphine-3-glucuronide and tifluadom on social encounters were compared in male and female mice that were allowed to interact with an anosmic male partner. The drugs were compared, as morphine sulphate is thought to act via mu, and tifluadom via kappa opiate receptors; morphine-3-glucuronide is the breakdown product of morphine. Neither morphine sulphate nor morphine-3-glucuronide significantly influenced inter-male social encounters. However, tifluadom increased non-social and decreased social behaviour, while increasing timid/defensive activities. Tifluadom did not significantly influence the behaviour of female mice in this social encounter: in contrast both morphine sulphate and morphine-3-glucuronide decreased timid/defensive behaviour and stimulated non-social behaviour. It was concluded that the results could be explained by suggesting that morphine sulphate decreases whereas tifluadom increases timidity.", 
    "35": "PK 11195 (1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxami de, a potent ligand for peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites, was unable to reverse the anxiogenic effects of Ro 5-4864 (chlorodiazepam) in the social interaction test or in the punished drinking test. However, at 90 mg/kg PK 11195 also reduced social interaction, indicating an anxiogenic effect. Both PK 11195 (30-120 mg/kg) and Ro 5-4864 (20-60 mg/kg) significantly increased the plasma corticosterone concentrations of rats left in their home cages after injection, and in those placed in novel apparatus. Because both drugs had effects in the same direction and because the doses were far higher than those needed to saturate the peripheral receptor, it is unlikely that these behavioural actions are mediated by peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites. It is suggested that the effect of PK 11195 could even be mediated by the classical CNS benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "36": "Two models have been chosen to study the effect of 2-amino-6-trifluoromethoxy benzothiazole (PK 26124) on excitatory amino acid neurotransmission: the pool of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the cerebellum and the release of acetylcholine in the striatum and olfactory tubercles. The release of acetylcholine induced by N-methyl-DL-aspartate in the striatum and olfactory tubercles was antagonized by PK 26124 which was less potent on the release of acetylcholine induced electrically. The increase in levels of cGMP in the cerebellum induced by excitatory amino acids such as glutamate and quisqualate was antagonized by PK 26124, but the drug was inactive against N-methyl-DL-aspartate, L-aspartate, kainate and cysteine sulphinate. In vivo it antagonized the increases of cGMP in the cerebellum elicited by all these excitatory compounds. All these results are compatible with a possible antagonism by PK 26124 of the excitatory amino acid neurotransmission and may explain its anticonvulsant properties.", 
    "37": "Aminophylline (50 and 100 mg/kg) and CGS 8216 (20 and 40 mg/kg) decreased the anticonvulsant potency of diazepam (5 and 10 mg/kg) against electroshock-induced seizures. It should be emphasized that aminophylline moderately affected the protective action of the benzodiazepine at a dose of 5 mg/kg, whereas it was equipotent with CGS 8216 with regard to diazepam at a dose of 10 mg/kg. Consequently, participation of a purinergic component in the anticonvulsant action of diazepam is suggested. On the other hand, the use of aminophylline in epileptic patients suffering from asthma seems unjustified.", 
    "38": "(RS)-5-(Aminomethyl)-2-isoxazolin-3-ol (dihydromuscimol, DHM) is a potent 4-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist, the inhibitory effects of which on neurons are sensitive to the antagonist bicuculline methochloride (BMC), and it also interacts with the GABA uptake system in vitro. (S)-(+)-DHM (4) and (R)-(-)-DHM (5) were obtained in optically pure forms via resolution of tert-butyloxycarbonyl-protected DHM (1) using cinchonidine as the only resolving agent. The optical purity and absolute stereochemistry of 4 and 5 were established by chemical correlation to the (S)-(+) enantiomer of 3-hydroxy-4-aminobutyric acid (GABOB). While 4 was a specific and potent BMC-sensitive GABA agonist in vivo and in vitro, possibly the most potent GABA agonist so far described, the inhibition of GABA uptake by DHM proved to reside exclusively in the (R)-(-) enantiomer (5). The affinity of 5 for BMC-sensitive GABA receptor sites in vitro was some 50 times lower than that of 4. Compounds 4 and 5 can be considered semirigid isosteres of the conformationally flexible GABA analogues (S)-(+)- and (R)-(-)-GABOB, respectively, which show a very low degree of enantioselectivity with respect to GABA synaptic mechanisms. This correlation between the degree of enantioselectivity and conformational mobility of chiral GABA analogues might be of importance for the design of new drugs with specific actions at synapses at which GABA is the transmitter.", 
    "39": "Experiments on isolated strips of the rabbit uterus showed the ability of GABA, GABAA-receptor agonist (diazepam) and GABAB-receptor antagonist (phenibut) to inhibit uterine contractility. GABAA-receptor antagonist (bicuculline) had a stimulating effect on contractility. It is assumed that GABA-ergic system plays an important role in the regulation of functional inhibition of contractile activity in the rabbit uterus, with GABA agonists regarded as potential gravidoprotectors in uterine hyperactivity or threatening miscarriage.", 
    "40": "The ability of a variety of detergents to solubilize peripheral benzodiazepine-binding sites from rat kidney was tested. Of all the detergents tested, only digitonin was found to be suitable for solubilization. This detergent solubilized 21% of the binding activity; 47% was inactivated, and 32% remained in the pellet. Specific binding of [3H]Ro 5-4864 to membrane-bound and solubilized peripheral benzodiazepine-binding sites was saturable, yielding a linear Scatchard plot (r = 0.96). KD values obtained for the membrane-bound and solubilized peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites were 3.9 +/- 0.4 nM and 5.4 +/- 0.4 nM, respectively. Respective Bmax values were 4.6 +/- 0.5 and 1.9 +/- 0.2 pmol/mg of protein. The KD value for the solubilized material obtained from kinetic experiments was 5.3 +/- 0.6 nM. The potency of PK 11195, Ro 5-4864, diazepam, flurazepam, chlordiazepoxide, Ro 15-1788, methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, and clonazepam to displace bound [3H]Ro 5-4864 from peripheral binding sites was similar in the membrane-bound and the soluble states. Most of the binding activity of the solubilized binding sites was destroyed by heating at 60 degrees C for 30 min or by treatment with 2 M guanidinium chloride or 4 M urea. More than 95% of the binding activity of the solubilized binding sites was retained after 18 hr at 4 degrees C, and more than 60% was retained after 4 days at the same temperature. These results indicate that the binding characteristics of peripheral benzodiazepine-binding sites extant in the membrane-bound state are retained after solubilization.", 
    "41": "Quantitative autoradiography was used to ascertain alterations in [3H]muscimol, [3H]flunitrazepam (FLU), [3H]naloxone, [3H]D-alanine-D-leucine-enkephalin (DADL), and [3H]spiroperidol binding in basal ganglia 1 week, 4 weeks, and 5 months after unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) in the rat. At 1 and 4 weeks following lesions, [3H]spiroperidol binding increased 33% in striatum. At 5 months, [3H]spiroperidol was only nonsignificantly increased above control. At 1 week, [3H]muscimol binding decreased 39% in ipsilateral globus pallidus (GP), but increased 41% and 11% in entopeduncular nucleus (EPN) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), respectively. At 4 weeks, [3H]muscimol binding was reduced 19% in striatum and 44% in GP and remained enhanced by 32% in both EPN and SNr. These changes in [3H]muscimol binding persisted at 5 months. [3H]FLU binding was altered in the same direction as [3H]muscimol binding; however, changes were slower in onset and became significant (and remained so) only at 4 weeks after lesions. Decreases in [3H]naloxone and [3H]DADL binding were seen in striatum, GP, EPN, and SNr. Scatchard analyses revealed that only receptor numbers were altered. This study provides biochemical evidence for differential regulation of striatal GABAergic output to GP and EPN/SNr.", 
    "42": "A mixed micelle formulation of diazepam was compared with midazolam and diazepam in propylene glycol for evidence of venous intolerance following IV injection. The overall incidence of venous morbidity was 17% for diazepam mixed micelle, 26% for midazolam and 90% for diazepam in propylene glycol. Diazepam mixed micelle is suggested as a preferable alternative to the standard formulation.", 
    "43": "The anticonvulsive action of diazepam, carbamazepine, sodium valproate and their combinations with pyridoxal-5-phosphate, nicotinamide, and alpha-tocopherol were investigated in acute experiments on mice with corazole-induced seizures. Diazepam (0.5 mg/kg), carbamazepine (50 mg/kg) and sodium valproate (200 mg/kg) were shown to reduce convulsive intensity and lethality. Vitamins nicotinamide (250 mg/kg), pyridoxal-5-phosphate (10 mg/kg) and alpha-tocopherol (100 mg/kg) potentiated anticonvulsive action of the above antiepileptic drugs. The results of the investigation suggest the efficacy of pathogenetic therapy and give new evidence of the advisability of using vitamins in combination with synthetic anticonvulsive drugs.", 
    "44": "Squirrel monkeys were trained to respond on one of two levers depending on whether midazolam (0.3 mg/kg) or saline had been injected. After i.v. injections of midazolam 10 consecutive responses on one lever either produced food or terminated a stimulus associated with electric shock, whereas after i.v. injections of saline 10 consecutive responses on the other lever either produced food or terminated the stimulus. The discriminative-stimulus effects of drugs were determined by administering cumulative doses i.v. during timeout periods that preceded sequential components of the experimental session. The benzodiazepines midazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam, the cyclopyrrolone zopiclone and the triazolopyridazine CL 218,872 had qualitatively similar stimulus effects regardless of the type of consequence (food presentation or stimulus-shock termination) that maintained responding. Administration of each of these drugs resulted in greater than 90% of responses on the midazolam-associated lever at cumulative doses that did not severely suppress the overall rate of responding. The order of potency was: midazolam = diazepam greater than or equal to N-desmethyldiazepam greater than or equal to zopiclone greater than CL 218,872 greater than or equal to chlordiazepoxide. Administration of the 5-hydroxytryptamine antagonists cyproheptadine and cinanserin also resulted in greater than 90% of responses on the midazolam-associated lever in about half the subjects, although these effects were observed only with cumulative doses that markedly reduced the overall rate of responding. Administration of pentobarbital, barbital, clozapine, muscimol, buspirone, diphenhydramine, tripelennamine, caffeine and Ro 15-1788 did not result in substantial responding on the midazolam-associated lever at doses up to those that reduced or eliminated responding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "45": "Studies of the possible interactions between the water-soluble benzodiazepine, midazolam, and two non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs, vecuronium and tubocurarine, were performed in the rat in vivo sciatic nerve-tibialis anterior muscle preparation. Midazolam 0.5 and 5 mg kg-1 caused 17% and 34% depression of the twitch height, respectively, once a steady-state blockade of the twitch height had been induced by vecuronium. The potentiation of the tubocurarine steady state blockade by midazolam 5 mg kg-1 was quantitatively equal to that of vecuronium, but was slower in onset. The buffer solvent of midazolam 5 mg kg-1 did not change the steady-state blockade of vecuronium. Midazolam 5 mg kg-1 caused a shift to the left of the cumulative dose-response curves of vecuronium.", 
    "46": "The widespread use of benzodiazepines has led the authors to review the pharmacological and clinical aspects of these substances. On a molecular level, the benzodiazepines have an effect on receptors in relation with the GABA system. Presently, endogenous ligand(s) to these receptors have not yet been fully demonstrated. The main benzodiazepines are also compared for their kinetics which is function of absorption, metabolisation and various factors such as binding to the receptor, age, hepatic and renal disorders. These pharmacological studies have clinical implications. The authors finally make a brief review of the clinical indications of the benzodiazepines.", 
    "47": "In order to study effects of antianxiety drugs on the threshold of intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS), the auto-titration technique was used in the two lever Skinner box. This procedure consisted of conventional ICSS except the brain stimulation current intensity was decreased after every 20 lever press for ICSS, and the animal could press the another reset lever (at any time) to reset the stimulation current intensity to the preseted level. The current intensity at which the animal pressed the reset lever (reset current) was defined as the threshold of ICSS. Since reset currents that the animals showed were very stable during this experiment, the effects of chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and meprobamate were studied. The reset current was significantly lowered by 5.0 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide, p.o., at 1 hr after administration accompanied by the significant increase of ICSS, and the reset current was significantly lowered by 20.0 mg/kg of chlordiazepoxide. On the other hand, diazepam did not lower the reset current, although a significant increase of ICSS was observed at 1.0 mg/kg, p.o. The reset current was lowered by meprobamate at 100 mg/kg, p.o., accompanied by the increase of ICSS, and a significant increase of ICSS was observed at 200 mg/kg but not accompanied by lowered reset current. From these results, increased susceptibility to the brain stimulation current may be involved in the facilitating effects of chlordiazepoxide and meprobamate on ICSS.", 
    "48": "Psychomotor effects of oral lorazepam 3 mg were studied in psychiatric patients stratified into four groups: 1) a group of six patients with no previous use of psychotrophic drugs (NoD), 2) a group of 12 patients treated with antidepressants and/or neuroleptics (PsyD), 3) a group of 10 patients treated with low doses of benzodiazepines (BZs) (lowBZ), and 4) a group of nine patients treated with high doses of BZs (high BZ). Similar objective psychomotor tests and subjective assessments were administered under single-blind conditions to all treatment groups at baseline, after intake of placebo, and after intake of 3 mg lorazepam. Both lorazepam (CGC) and total BZs (bioassay) in serum were assayed. The results demonstrate that treatment with BZs induce dose-dependent development of tolerance to psychomotor effects of lorazepam. Antidepressants and neuroleptics failed to induce cross-tolerance to lorazepam. The rise in serum lorazepam concentrations after lorazepam intake was similar (about 28 micrograms/l) in all treatment groups, suggesting a functional, not dispositional, tolerance. However, the initial learning effect in psychomotor performance was poorer among BZ users than among others.", 
    "49": "According to the method described earlier (1), the effect of some anxiolytics on memory retention in \"good\" and \"poor\" learning mice was studied. While the classical benzodiazepine (diazepam) significantly improves performance of both sub-populations of mice, non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics worsen that of poor learners and triazolobenzodiazepines increase performance.", 
    "50": "A good agreement was established between the anxiolytic (tranquilizing) effect of phenazepam after administration to rats per os and the rate of its supply to the systemic blood flow. The magnitude of the myorelaxant effect of phenazepam in rats after its oral and intravenous administration correlated well with the drug concentration in blood only at the late periods of time.", 
    "51": "Evidence from studies which utilise either opiate receptor agonists and antagonists strongly indicate a role for endorphinergic mechanisms in the control of feeding responses. Two means by which these compounds may exert an effect on feeding can be singled-out. Firstly, emerging evidence suggests that the process of achieving satiety (terminating a meal, or choice of a commodity) may be accelerated following treatments with opiate receptor antagonists. Secondly, the preference for highly palatable solutions (sweet solutions have received most attention) in two-bottle tests is blocked after injection of opiate receptor antagonists. This finding has been interpreted in terms of the abolition of the reward or incentive quality associated with the particularly attractive flavour. These two mechanisms of action may represent two aspects of a single, fundamental process. Following an introduction to rat urination model of in vivo kappa agonist activity, the consistent effect of several kappa agonists (including the highly selective U-50,488H) to stimulate food consumption is described. Recognising that members of the dynorphin group of endogenous opioid peptides are kappa receptor ligands, some with a high degree of selectivity, and the evidence the dynorphins and neo-endorphins produce hyperphagia in rats is particularly interesting. Such lines of evidence lead to the hypothesis that peptides of the dynorphin group may act endogenously to promote the expression of normal feeding behaviour.", 
    "52": "There is a pharmacokinetic interaction between digoxin and diazepam that increases the elimination half-life of digoxin. It may be due to a reduction of digoxin tissue concentrations and to an enhanced effect of diazepam on digoxin binding to plasma albumin. Diazepam (10(-5) M) also induces a positive inotropic effect in guinea-pig isolated atria. In a study of a possible pharmacodynamic interaction between both drugs, the inotropic response to digoxin has been examined in rat isolated atria in the presence of diazepam. The atria were kept in Tyrode at 37 degrees C, bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 and electrically stimulated at twice the threshold voltage. The results indicate that diazepam induces an inotropic effect at 10(-5) M (P less than 0.05) and reduces (P less than 0.05) at 10(-9), 10(-7) and 10(-5) M the inotropic response to digoxin (10(-5) M).", 
    "53": "The DSM-III divides anxiety disorders into two broad categories, Phobic Disorders and Anxiety States. Anxiety states characterised by panic attacks have been separated from generalised anxiety disorders. While this classification may not be generally accepted it is of heuristic value. Delineation of panic disorder as a distinct diagnostic entity has led to renewed efforts to identify a biological cause for the sudden severe somatic and psychological symptoms experienced by these patients. A review of evidence for the involvement of the major neurotransmitter systems is presented. Systematic investigations in DSM-III defined groups of patients are only beginning to be reported. It is difficult as yet to draw any definite conclusions, but some tentative evidence for abnormalities of the noradrenergic system and the GABA-benzodiazepine chloride ionophore receptor complex are emerging. The reliable induction of panic attacks by chemical agents provides the promise of a greater understanding of the possible biological mechanisms involved in this anxiety disorder.", 
    "54": "Each of a series of benzodiazepines was found to be effective in preventing convulsions evoked by intermittent photic stimulation of epileptic chickens. There was a high correlation between the anticonvulsant potencies (mean effective dosages) and the affinity of the agents for the putative benzodiazepine receptor as measured by displacement of [3H]diazepam from binding sites on chicken synaptosomal membranes. This correlation in a genetic model of epilepsy provides further evidence that benzodiazepines exert their anticonvulsant effects by interacting with the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "55": "This article briefly reviews the well known effects of sedative-hypnotics, alcohol and narcotics on sleep. These drugs also have respiratory depressant effects, and the limited information about their effects on sleep-related breathing disturbances is reviewed. They exacerbate obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and have moderate to minimal effects on occasional apnea or hypopnea, but do not induce breathing disturbances de novo.", 
    "56": "Although electrochemical (EC) methods have been demonstrated to be sensitive and selective, wide use of EC detection in high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assays in forensic and clinical toxicology laboratories has not been forthcoming. This fact is due to the general difficulty involved with the use of reductive EC detection methods, as well as to the lack of EC response in either the oxidative or reductive mode, for a number of classes of drugs having substantial clinical and forensic importance. The use of an on-line, post-column, continuous photolytic derivatization step, followed by conventional oxidative amperometric detection, alleviates many of these problems. In this report, the use of HPLC-photolysis-EC (HPLC-h nu-EC) for the trace determination of a number of controlled substances in biological fluids is presented. Following system optimization, the determination of phenobarbital, cocaine, methylphenidate, and several 1,4-benzodiazepines (and metabolites) is linear over three orders of magnitude. In addition, HPLC-h nu-EC offers a sensitive approach for these compounds, in that limits of detection (LODs) are all below 1 microgram/ml, ranging from 1 ng/ml to 750 ng/ml. The validity of this newer method is demonstrated in collaborative studies involving the trace determinations of phenobarbital in human serum, and chlordiazepoxide and its major metabolite, norchlordiazepoxide, in human urine. Finally, the authors' view of the role of HPLC-h nu-EC in the clinical and forensic toxicology laboratory is presented.", 
    "57": "In addition to possessing anti-anxiety activity in man, triazolobenzodiazepines have been reported to have antidepressant and antipanic properties. In this they differ from classical 1,4-benzodiazepines that have only anti-anxiety activity. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of the triazolobenzodiazepines in two animal tests of anxiety and in the holeboard, to see whether clear differences could be observed between them and the 1,4-benzodiazepines. After acute administration, U-43,465 (16 mg kg-1) had a significant anxiolytic effect in the social interaction test. Neither adinazolam (1-3.5 mg kg-1) nor alprazolam (0.125-2 mg kg-1) had a significant effect. It is suggested that this is because, with adinazolam and alprazolam, doses at which anxiolytic effects can be observed are close to those at which sedative effects can be observed. U-43,465 (8-16 mg kg-1) and alprazolam (1-2 mg kg-1) had significant anxiolytic effects in the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety. U-43,465 (8-32 mg kg-1), adinazolam (0.5-5 mg kg-1) and alprazolam (0.2-2.0 mg kg-1) caused dose-related reductions in exploratory head-dipping, locomotor activity and rearing in the holeboard. In general the results seen in the three tests with the triazolobenzodiazepines alprazolam and adinazolam were similar to those seen with classical 1,4-benzodiazepines. With U-43,465, however, an anxiolytic effect was observed in the social interaction test after acute treatment; chronic treatment is required to see an effect with classical 1,4-benzodiazepines. In this U-43,465 resembles the effects of several novel non-benzodiazepine putative anxiolytic compounds that are believed to have less sedative potential than the benzodiazepines.", 
    "58": "In the light of recent attempts to subclassify muscarinic receptors, agonist-antagonist interactions at muscarinic receptors have been re-examined using improved techniques, on the mouse, isolated, lumen-perfused stomach gastric acid assay. Using 5-methylfurmethide as the muscarinic agonist, the pKB estimated for atropine was significantly lower on the stomach assay (7.78) than on the guinea-pig trachea (8.93). However pKB values for N-methylatropine, the quaternary ammonium derivative of atropine, at concentrations producing dose-ratios above 20 on the stomach assay (pKB = 9.67), and over the full concentration range studied on the trachea (pKB = 9.69) were not significantly different. The deviation from simple competitive behaviour at low dose-ratios with N-methylatropine in the stomach assay is consistent with the effects of a saturable uptake mechanism for quaternary ammonium compounds. The pKB values for pirenzepine on the stomach (6.67) and the trachea (6.87) were not significantly different suggesting that pirenzepine behaves more like N-methylatropine in terms of expressed affinity. We conclude that the oxyntic cell muscarinic receptors are homogeneous with those in the guinea-pig trachea. An initial exploration suggests that there is a relationship between the lipophilicity (log P) of the antagonists and the degree of apparent underestimation of antagonist affinity in the stomach assay. This supports the hypothesis that the underestimation of antagonist affinity is due to the loss of antagonist into the gastric secretion from the receptor compartment. Apparently, relatively selective inhibition of acid secretion, compared to atropine, could be explained without the need to postulate heterogeneity of muscarinic receptor populations.", 
    "59": "Blood plasma content of cAMP and cGMP in C57BL/6, BALB/c mice and their reciprocal F1-hybrids has been studied at rest, upon exposure to stress induced in an open field technique and phenazepam injection at a dose of 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg. Interstrain differences in baseline content and changes of nucleotide concentration in conditions of stress have been revealed. F1-hybrids inherit initial correlation between nucleotide content and the type of cAMP changes of C57BL/6 mice and cGMP changes of BALB/c mice. Phenazepam injection to C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice was shown to produce specific shifts in blood plasma cyclic nucleotide content.", 
    "60": "Considerable work across the last 10 yr has implicated the endogenous opioid peptides in the regulation of ingestion. The opioid antagonists, such as naloxone and naltrexone, reduce intake of water, flavored water, and food. Naloxone's effects are pharmacologically specific, ie, its effects are dose-related and stereoselective. Further, a variety of antagonists produce similar effects. A primary site of action of naloxone, with respect to intake, is in the central nervous system. Naloxone's effects are also behaviorally specific, ie, its effects seem particularly related to palatability functions. The effects of opioid agonists, in small doses, enhance intake of some nutrients, but these effects are not opposite those of the antagonists. Benzodiazepines enhance drinking and eating and apparently interact with opioid systems. These observations combine with those directly measuring features of the endogenous opioid peptides to support a conclusion that opioid peptides are part of a system for regulating ingestion.", 
    "61": "A method is described for reproducible measurement of ultrasonic vocalization induced by tail-holding stress in rat pups. The anxiolytic benzodiazepines, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, and CL 218872, reduced the ultrasounds at doses inducing little CNS depressant activity. Gross behavioral disruption such as sedation (muscimol, prazosin, and chlorpromazine), tremors (yohimbine), myoclonus (MK 212), and immobility (morphine) resulted in reduction of ultrasounds. Non-behaviourally active doses of these compound or any doses tested of mephenesin, amphetamine, amitriptyline, haloperidol, and naloxone did not affect the ultrasounds. Metergoline inhibited ultrasounds at doses producing little change in overt behavior. This method is proposed as a convenient model of anxiety which may also be influenced by central 5-hydroxytryptamine transmission.", 
    "62": "Five patients with severe chronic lung disease were given placebo or 7.5 mg of clorazepate, a benzodiazepine, at bedtime for two weeks using a double-blind cross-over study design. Exercise tolerance, arterial blood gases, pulmonary function tests, self-rated breathlessness, and self-administered depression and anxiety scores were similar during drug treatment, placebo treatment, and washout periods. Higher doses of clorazepate were not tolerated by three of five patients. Nonanxious patients with chronic lung disease seem not to benefit subjectively or objectively from a low-dose benzodiazepine regimen.", 
    "63": "Eight healthy men received a single, 1.25 mg dose of digoxin on two occasions, once in an otherwise drug-free control state and again while concurrently receiving alprazolam, 1.5 mg/day. There was no significant difference between control and alprazolam conditions in digoxin volume of distribution (11.0 vs. 11.2 L/kg), elimination t1/2 (46 vs. 41 hours), or total clearance from serum (2.8 vs. 3.6 ml/min/kg). Alprazolam coadministration slightly reduced mean 96-hour urinary excretion of digoxin (37.6% vs. 30.9% of dose; P less than 0.01), but there was no significant difference between treatment conditions in projected total cumulative excretion of digoxin (45.2% vs. 40.9% of dose) or in renal clearance of digoxin (1.23 vs. 1.44 ml/min/kg). Creatinine clearance also did not differ between the control and alprazolam conditions (164 vs. 142 ml/min). Thus therapeutic doses of alprazolam do not significantly alter digoxin clearance in healthy man.", 
    "64": "The sedative, psychomotor, and memory effects of single oral doses of alprazolam (ALP), lorazepam (LOR), temazepam (TMP), and triazolam (TRZ) were evaluated in women taking oral contraceptives (OCs) and a comparable group of control women. Nine women taking OCs and 11 control women took doses of 1 mg ALP and 2 mg LOR and 10 OC users and 10 control women took 30 mg TMP and 0.5 mg TRZ on two occasions separated by 28 days. Minimal psychomotor impairment was noted after TMP. ALP, LOR, and TRZ produced greater performance impairment in the OC users. Correcting the maximum observed performance decrement for plasma concentration did not account for the differences between OC users and controls. After TMP, there was less sedation during the first 2 hours in OC users, who also had higher plasma TMP clearance. There were no differences in sedation between OC users and controls after ALP, LOR, and TRZ; however, there was less than 50% power to detect a 30% difference. Amnestic effects in OC users and controls did not differ after any of the four drugs. The observed patterns of anterograde amnesia were different, with the earliest and most pronounced recognition failure after TRZ (50% at 1.5 hours), while the LOR effect increased to a maximum (30%) 4 hours after dosing. Our data suggest that differences in benzodiazepine pharmacokinetics between OC users and control women do not account for observed differences in psychomotor impairment. Women taking OCs are more sensitive to the psychomotor effects of single oral doses of benzodiazepines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "65": "The effect of two repeated oral doses of 100 mg tofisopam 15 mg midazolam and placebo on the concentrations of monoamine metabolites (MHPG, 5-HIAA, HVA) in lumbar CSF were studied in general surgical patients operated on under spinal analgesia (n = 12 in each group). Midazolam, but not tofisopam, improved the quality of sleep the night before surgery. Both active agents reduced preoperative anxiety of the patients, but tofisopam was without subjective sedative action. In the placebo group, in contrast to the active drug groups, there was a slight positive correlation between the MHPG concentration and degree of anxiety before surgery. The only significant difference in the monoamine metabolites in lumbar CSF was found in the concentrations of HVA between tofisopam and placebo treated patients. The lower HVA concentrations suggest that the curious 3,4-benzodiazepine derivative, tofisopam, modifies central dopaminergic activity.", 
    "66": "In view of the recent M1 and M2 subclassification of muscarinic receptors and the suggestion of separate populations of muscarinic receptors on oxyntic and histamine cells in the gastric mucosa, we have analysed the effects of McN-A 343, classified as an M1-selective agonist, on gastric acid secretion by the mouse, isolated, lumen-perfused stomach assay. Acid secretion stimulated by McN-A 343 was not inhibited by tetrodotoxin pretreatment, although it was competitively antagonized by atropine (pKB 7.90), suggesting a muscarinic site of action between postganglionic neurones and the final secretory event. Acid secretion stimulated by McN-A 343 was more sensitive than 5-methylfurmethide-stimulated secretion to H2-receptor blockade: the profile of inhibition was consistent with expectations for a model of indirect agonism, suggesting that McN-A 343 preferentially stimulated the release of endogenous histamine from mucosal histamine cells. In view of this selective action the McN-A 343-pirenzepine interaction was studied, the latter being classified as an M1-selective antagonist. Results were consistent with expectations for a competitive interaction but the pKB (6.69) was not significantly different from the value obtained at the oxyntic cell, using 5-methylfurmethide as agonist in the presence of H2-receptor blockade, in a previous study. We suggest that there is no need to postulate differences in oxyntic and histamine cell muscarinic receptors to account for the selective stimulant activity of McN-A 343 observed in this study and the relatively selective inhibition of gastric acid secretion by pirenzepine in vivo. McN-A 343 selectivity may be accounted for by a higher muscarinic receptor density on the histamine cell and pirenzepine selectivity by a smaller degree of loss into the gastric secretion compared to atropine.", 
    "67": "In slices of rat cuneate nucleus, responses to the GABA-A receptor agonist muscimol were potentiated by flurazepam. The maximal potentiation by 1 microM flurazepam was antagonized by the neuronal benzodiazepine receptor ligand Ro15-1788 3 microM, by the quinoline derivative PK8165 0.1 microM and by the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor ligand Ro5-4864 0.1 microM. Another ligand for the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, PK11195 10 microM, enhanced the potentiating effect of a submaximal concentration of flurazepam 0.1 microM and prevented the antagonism of flurazepam by Ro5-4864. At much higher concentrations of these drugs, additional effects were seen. Ro15-1788 30 microM and PK11195 30 microM each caused small potentiations of muscimol while Ro5-4864 30 microM caused a small antagonism. Ro15-1788 30 microM, PK8165 100 microM and Ro5-4864 30 microM all antagonized the potentiation of muscimol by pentobarbitone 10 microM; also, PK8165 and Ro5-4864 enhanced the potency of picrotoxin as an antagonist of muscimol. It is concluded that both Ro5-4864 and PK8165 have several distinct effects on the GABA-A receptor complex, all of which could result in reduced responses to muscimol.", 
    "68": "The benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist N'-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG 7142; 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a dose-dependent reduction in the consumption of a familiar, highly palatable diet by non-food-deprived male rats. At dose levels which exhibited no significant intrinsic effects, the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist 2-phenylpyrazolo-[4,3-c]-quinoline-3(5H)-one (CGS 8216; 1.25-5.0 mg/kg, i.p.) reversed the anorectic effect of FG 7142. When clonazepam and FG 7142 were given in combination, mutual cancelling of their opposite effects occurred. These results are consistent with an action of FG 7142 at benzodiazepine recognition sites to reduce the level of palatable food consumption, and imply that a bidirectional control of food intake via benzodiazepine recognition sites can be achieved. The anorectic effect of FG 7142 was not reversed by 24-h food deprivation, indicating a possible separation from the effects of hunger mechanisms.", 
    "69": "The selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, Ro 15-1788, produced behavioral effects in pigeons at doses at least 100 times lower than those previously reported to possess intrinsic pharmacological activity in mammals. In contrast to its effects in mammalian species, in pigeons, Ro 15-1788 does not exhibit partial agonist activity. Key-peck responses of pigeons were studied under a multiple fixed-interval 3-min, fixed-interval 3-min schedule in which the first response after 3-min produced food in the presence of red or white keylights. In addition, every 30th response during the red keylight produced a brief electric shock (punishment). Under control conditions, punished responding was suppressed to 30% of unpunished response levels. Ro 15-1788 (0.01 mg/kg, i.m.) increased unpunished response rates by 33% without affecting rates of punished responding. Doses of 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg Ro 15-1788 produced dose-related decreases in both punished and unpunished responding. As is characteristic of other benzodiazepines, midazolam (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, i.m.) markedly increased punished responding but had little effect on rates of unpunished responding. Ro 15-1788 antagonized the increases in punished responding and also reversed the rate-decreasing effects of higher doses of midazolam. However, the effectiveness of Ro 15-1788 as a benzodiazepine antagonist was limited by its intrinsic activity: rate-decreasing doses of Ro 15-1788 were unable to completely reverse behavioral effects of midazolam. Midazolam was an effective antagonist of the behavioral effects of Ro 15-1788 (up to 0.1 mg/kg) but midazolam did not influence the rate-decreasing effects of 1.0 mg/kg Ro 15-1788 across a 100-fold dose range. In the pigeon, the behavioral effects of relatively low doses of Ro 15-1788 (0.01-0.1 mg/kg) appear to be related to benzodiazepine receptor mechanisms, whereas other systems appear to be involved in the effects of higher doses.", 
    "70": "Other methods for the treatment of anxiety are discussed--psychotherapeutic, behavioural and pharmacological. Among the psychotherapeutic methods are psychoanalytical and supportive therapy, psycho-education, cognitive therapy and paradoxical intention. Behaviour- modifying methods include systematic desensitization, flooding, thought blocking and biofeedback. However, none of these methods in isolation seems to be effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Drugs such as beta-blockers, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotic drugs and buspirone are reviewed. Buspirone seems to be as effective as the benzodiazepines in the alleviation of anxiety and may have less untoward effects. A few new drugs that are still being evaluated--fenobam, suriclone, synaptamine, fominoben and tracazolate--are mentioned.", 
    "71": "The coexistence of anxiety and depression as one syndrome is well documented. Benzodiazepines are not effective in the treatment of endogenous depression where tricyclic and newer antidepressants are more effective. However, they do combat the symptoms of non-endogenous depression and many of those found in anxiety disorders, including depressed mood, i.e. they may elevate the depressed mood that occurs secondary to anxiety. A study using bromazepam undertaken in 1984 by Roche with general practitioners confirmed this trend towards normalization of mood."
