It is suggested that the observed decrease in motility is related to development of a pathologic reaction of anxiety. The method is recommended as a test for anxious behaviour in experiment.", 
    "1": "Stress-protective effect of phenazepam (1 mg/kg) was studied in rats with different ability to avoid acute aversive situation. Two types of extreme situations were created, immobilization and hyperkinesia (permanent running inside the wheel). It was found out that rats which easily avoided acute aversive situation (I group) were more resistant to extreme effects. In immobilization stress phenazepam produced protective effect mostly in rats with low ability to avoid acute stress situation (II group). In situation with hyperkinesia the drug did not essentially influence the state of rats of the II group and even aggravated the state of rats of the I group. It seems likely that stress resistance of animals and dissimilar protective effects of phenazepam are determined by distinctions in coping mechanisms.", 
    "2": "In 10 patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting under midazolam-sufentanil anaesthesia, the influence of hypothermia on the plasma concentration-response and biodisposition of rocuronium were investigated. Neuromuscular function was monitored mechanomyographically. Plasma and urine concentrations of rocuronium were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass prolonged the duration of action of maintenance doses and altered the plasma concentration-response relationship. The elimination and distribution half-lives, following the last maintenance dose after rewarming, and the urinary excretion of rocuronium were similar to values obtained during normothermia. A diminished hepatic uptake and storage in the liver of rocuronium during hypothermia may explain the more pronounced prolongation of the duration compared to that of other steroidal neuromuscular blocking agents.", 
    "3": "We assessed the outcome after 2 months of 28 alcohol-dependent subjects following out-patient detoxification using an uncontrolled follow-up study with data collected at the time of detoxification (T1) and after 2 months (T2). We also determined the cost of out-patient versus in-patient detoxification. The setting was a psychiatric emergency clinic at a South West London University Hospital. Self-reported alcohol consumption in the week before T1 and T2, score on the 'Alcohol Problems Inventory' measuring alcohol-related relational, occupation, legal and medical problems in the 2 months prior to T1 and T2, mean corpuscular volume and gamma-glutamyl transferase at T1 and T2 were used as outcome measures. Eight subjects had a 'good' outcome (seven were abstinent and one only drank four units on one day). Nine subjects were 'improved' by either having their alcohol consumption, or halving their 'Alcohol Problems Inventory' score at T2. 'Good' and 'improved' outcome were confirmed by mean corpuscular volume and gamma-glutamyl transferase results. Eleven subjects were 'not improved'. Engagement following detoxification with voluntary alcohol agencies was associated with a better outcome. In-patient detoxification is calculated to be six times more expensive than out-patient detoxification. Out-patient detoxification is a cost-effective step in the treatment of alcohol-dependent patients.", 
    "4": "A chronic alcoholic who had ingested a very high dose of disulfiram (29 g over a 1-week period) without simultaneous alcohol intake developed an acute encephalopathy and a severe flaccid tetraparesis that worsened over the course of several days, even after the intake of the drug had stopped. Recovery was both slow and incomplete. One year after intoxication, the patient still had distal weakness in the arms and legs, and hypesthesia in the hands and feet.", 
    "5": "The central pharmacological effects of ethanol are well known and resemble those of the benzodiazepines (BZD). In addition BZD may interact with ethanol, resulting in enhanced cerebral depression. Ro 15-4513, BZD inverse agonist, potentially antagonizes a lot of effects of ethanol but not all. In our study, another BZD inverse agonist, CGS 8216, reverses the hypnotic effect of ethanol and hypoactivity in mice and rats. CGS 8216 increased also ethanol's locomotor stimulation in mice. This supports the hypothesis that some effects of ethanol are mediated by the GABA-BZD-chloride channel receptor complex. Our behavioural experiments described in this report suggest that CGS 8216, like Ro 15-4513, may act on the alpha-6 subunit of this receptor complex.", 
    "6": "1. The rates of diazepam (DZ) metabolism to the primary metabolites 3-hydroxydiazepam, 4'-hydroxydiazepam and nordiazepam were studied in vitro using rat hepatic microsomes and hepatocytes. 4'-hydroxydiazepam had the largest intrinsic clearance (Vmax/Km ratio, CL(int)) in both microsomes and hepatocytes representing 49 and 70% of total metabolism respectively. Whereas the contribution of 3-hydroxydiazepam was similar in both systems (21-24%), the N-demethylation pathway was greater in microsomes (27%) than hepatocytes (9%). 2. The pharmacokinetics of DZ were determined in vivo using the intraportal route to avoid blood flow limitations due to the high clearance of DZ. No dose dependency was observed in either clearance or steady state volume of distribution, which were estimated to be 38 ml/min/SRW (where SRW is a standard rat weight of 250 g) and 1.3 L/SRW respectively. Blood binding of DZ was concentration independent, the unbound fraction being 0.22. 3. Scaling factors were used to relate the in vitro CL(int) to the in vivo unbound clearance. Hepatocytes (123 ml/min/SRW) produced a more realistic prediction for the in vivo value (174 ml/min/SRW) than microsomes (41 ml/min/SRW). This situation is believed to arise from the quantitative differences in the three metabolic pathways in the two in vitro systems. It is speculated that end product inhibition is responsible for reduced total metabolism in microsomes whereas hepatocytes operate kinetically in a manner close to in vivo.", 
    "7": "Recent studies have suggested that the benzodiazepine (BZ) lorazepam (LZ) differs from other BZs in its impairing effects on implicit memory tasks. The present study was designed to assess whether this atypical effect withstood the experimental rigour of Schacter's retrieval intentionality criterion and further, whether it could be reversed by the BZ antagonist, flumazenil (FL). The separate and combined effects of LZ, FL and placebo (PL) were assessed on indices of memory, sedation, and attention in 48 healthy volunteers. LZ disrupted performance on both explicit and implicit memory tasks, induced motor sedation and impaired focussed attention. Fl attenuated LZ-induced attentional deficits but did not affect motor sedation. FL also attenuated LZ-induced impairment on the implicit retrieval task. On the explicit retrieval task FL attenuated LZ-induced impairment for words which had been deeply processed at study but not words which had been shallowly processed. A subsequent recognition test showed LZ impaired recognition memory only when accompanied by recollective experience and flumazenil again attenuated this effect. FL itself lowered performance on several measures, reflecting intrinsic activity of this \"antagonist\". Assessment of the relationship between the mnestic and other effects of the drugs suggested that attentional effects contribute to, but do not explain, effects on implicit memory tasks. These results imply that the apparent atypical effects of LZ on implicit memory tasks are mediated by the same BZ receptor complex as mediates LZ's other effects.", 
    "8": "Prior work has suggested that the mediation of the behavioral effects of inescapable shock (IS) might involve release of an endogenous beta-carboline-like ligand at the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) that binds to the benzodiazepine (BZ) recognition site on the GABAA complex, thereby disinhibiting the DRN. This was tested by microinjection of the BZ receptor antagonists flumazenil and CGS8216 in the region of the DRN, either before IS or before later behavioral testing. Both compounds blocked subsequent enhancement of fear conditioning and interference with shuttlebox escape when administered before IS, but had no effect when given before testing. In addition, flumazenil did not alter the behavior of escapably shocked subjects.", 
    "9": "The effects of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, on triazolam- and zolpidem-induced memory impairment were investigated. Sixty subjects received oral triazolam 0.5 mg, zolpidem 20.0 mg, or placebo at 10 a.m. (n = 20 per drug). Ninety minutes later, half of the subjects (n = 10) in each oral drug group were administered flumazenil 1.0 mg, while the remaining half received placebo (normal saline), through indwelling venous catheters. Learning/memory tests (including Simulated Escape, Restricted Reminding, Paired-Associates, and Repeated Acquisition) were administered at that time, and at 1.5-h intervals over the next 6 h. Triazolam/placebo and zolpidem/placebo drug combinations impaired memory on all tests (all Ps < 0.05). However, the triazolam/flumazenil and zolpidem/flumazenil groups showed no evidence of impairment during any test session. These results demonstrate that flumazenil 1.0 mg rapidly and lastingly reverses memory impairment caused by agonists of the benzodiazepine receptor. Furthermore, nonsignificant trends suggested that performance of the placebo/flumazenil group was consistently better than that of the placebo/placebo group, denoting a possible role of endogenous benzodiazepine agonists in natural sleep/wake processes.", 
    "10": "As the catecholamines have long been implicated in attentional processes, the present investigation compared the effects of the mixed alpha 1/alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist clonidine (CLO), the benzodiazepine diazepam (DZP), the D1/D2 antagonist haloperidol (HAL) and a low-tryptophan drink (Lo-TRP) on performance of tests of selective attention with distractors in four groups of young, healthy volunteers. Using a placebo-controlled, cross-over design, selective and dissociable effects on performance were found with each pharmacological manipulation. Specifically, CLO acted to broaden the focus of attention, HAL generally slowed reaction times during attentional search, and DZP and Lo-TRP produced differential effects on stimulus-response compatibility during attentional search. Furthermore, these results underline the usefulness of employing a single test with several neurochemical manipulations, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of the neurochemical basis of attention.", 
    "11": "The experiments described in this report used a concurrent access procedure to study ethanol reinforcement. Rats were trained to lever press for a 10% sucrose solution and a 10% ethanol/10% sucrose mixture, and both reinforcers were available on variable-interval 5-s schedules. In baseline and vehicle injection sessions, the animals distributed their responding between both solutions. When injected with the partial inverse benzodiazepine agonist Ro 15-4513 (3, 9, and 18 mg/kg), responding for the ethanol solution decreased while responding for sucrose remained intact. Ethanol injections (0.5 and 1.0 g/kg) engendered a similar profile. Chlordiazepoxide led to an increase in ethanol mix responding at 2 mg/kg and a decrease in ethanol mix responding at higher doses; no dose affected sucrose responding. Morphine (0.5-16 mg/kg) decreased responding for both the ethanol mix and sucrose solutions, more or less simultaneously. Naloxone (0.125-20 mg/kg) selectively reduced ethanol mix responding at low doses, and decreased responding for both reinforcers at high doses. In another group of animals, isocaloric alternatives were concurrently available: 10% ethanol/0.25% saccharin versus 14% sucrose. Injections of Ro 15-4513 and chloridiazepoxide produced similar results as in the first group of rats: an increase in ethanol mix responding with low dose chlordizepoxide, and a decrease in ethanol mix responding with Ro 15-4513. However, naloxone injections did not selectively affect responding for either of the reinforcers when they were isocaloric. These results are discussed in terms of ethanol's neuropharmacological actions.", 
    "12": "The non-peptide NK2 receptor antagonist, GR159897, was evaluated in two putative models of anxiety, the mouse light-dark box and the marmoset human intruder response test. Effects were compared to the structurally dissimilar NK2 antagonist, (+/-) SR48968 and the benzodiazepines, diazepam and chlordiazepoxide. GR159897 (0.0005-50 micrograms/kg SC) caused significant and dose-dependent increases in the amount of time mice spent in the more aversive light compartment of the light-dark box, with no effect on locomotor activity. (+/-)SR48968 (0.0005-0.5 microgram/kg SC) and diazepam (1-1.75 mg/kg SC), also increased time spent in the light compartment, without effect on locomotor activity. In the marmoset human intruder response test, GR159897 (0.2-50 micrograms/kg SC) significantly increased the amount of time marmosets spent at the front of the cage during confrontation with a human observer (\"threat\"). Similar effects were produced by (+/-)SR48968 (10-50 micrograms/kg SC) and chlordiazepoxide (0.3-3.0 mg/kg SC). These results provide further evidence, in both rodent and primate species, for the ability of NK2 antagonists to restore behaviours which have been suppressed by novel aversive environments. Such effects indicate that NK2 antagonists may have anxiolytic activity.", 
    "13": "The effects of long-term treatment (three times a day for 3 weeks) with pharmacologically active doses of the novel anxiolytics and anticovulsants abecarnil (0.5 mg/kg, IP) and imidazenil (0.5 mg/kg, IP) on basal hippocampal acetylcholine release in freely moving rats were compared with those of diazepam (3 mg/kg, IP). Challenge doses of diazepam, abecarnil, and imidazenil decreased the extracellular acetyl-choline concentration in the hippocampus by the same extent in animals chronically treated with the respective drug or vehicle. Moreover, the abrupt discontinuation of long-term treatment with diazepam, abecarnil, or imidazenil failed to affect hippocampal acetylcholine release during the first 5 days of withdrawal. In contrast, the acute administration of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (1 mg/kg, IP) 2 days after diazepam withdrawal elicited a marked increase (65%) in acetylcholine release in the hippocampus. Flumazenil failed to induce the same effect 5 days after diazepam withdrawal or 2 or 5 days after discontinuation of long-term treatment with abecarnil or imidazenil. These results indicate that (i) the inhibitory effects of full (diazepam), partial (imidazenil), and selective (abecarnil) benzodiazepine receptor agonists on acetylcholine output in rat hippocampus are not affected by repeated drug administration; (ii) discontinuation of long-term treatment with each type of agonist does not affect hippocampal cholinergic mechanisms; and (iii) flumazenil increases acetylcholine release only in the hippocampus of rats chronically treated with diazepam. Together, these data further differentiate the pharmacology of benzodiazepine receptor full agonists from that of partial and selective agonists.", 
    "14": "This study explored whether benzodiazepines selectively affect aspects of attention and/or visual information processing, as they do memory. A cued visual-search paradigm was employed, using normal volunteers and a single dose of triazolam. This paradigm provided for a detailed examination of two aspects of visual attention and information processing: 1) controlled versus automatic attention allocation (via central and peripheral cues), and 2) the extent to which processing an item in a non-cued location affects performance (via cue-validity). Triazolam, compared to placebo, significantly increased response time, and Drug Condition interacted with Cue-Validity but not Cue-Type. Based on these data, we argue that triazolam does not affect attention allocation but does affect attentional disengagement and/or attention switching mechanisms.", 
    "15": "1. The attenuation of morphine withdrawal syndrome by acute benzodiazepine administration has been well documented. However, the pharmacological mechanisms implicated in this effect remain unclear. 2. In this study, the possible participation of noradrenergic, serotonergic and benzodiazepine receptors on flunitrazepam-modified morphine withdrawal syndrome was investigated in mice. Flunitrazepam was associated to the noradrenergic antagonists prazosin (1 mg/kg) and propranolol (0.5 mg/kg), the serotonergic agents ritanserine (1 mg/kg) and p-chloro phenylalanine (600 mg/kg), the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (10 mg/kg), and the benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist Ro 15-4513 (5 mg/kg). 3. The decrease in jumping behavior-induced by flunitrazepam was potentiated by prazosin, while ritanserine, flumazenil and Ro 15-4513 blocked this effect. 4. Flunitrazepam-induced increase on wet dog shake frequency was partially reduced by flumazenil, and strongly antagonized by ritanserine and Ro 15-4513. 5. Noradrenergic and serotonergic systems seem to be primarily implicated in the changes induced on jumping and wet dog shakes respectively. These modifications are induced through the activation of the benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "16": "The self-medication hypothesis of addictive disorders postulates that individuals with psychiatric symptoms use drugs to alleviate their symptoms. Although commonly cited to explain the etiology of substance abuse, self-medication has not been experimentally validated. This study evaluated one version of the self-medication hypothesis by formulating it into a testable hypothesis: are highly anxious volunteers more likely to self-administer anxiolytic drugs than non-anxious controls. Anxious (ANX, n = 22) and control (CTL, n = 23) subjects participated in two double-blind placebo-controlled experiments, one testing ethanol (0.8 g/kg) and the other testing diazepam (20 mg). Subjects sampled and then chose between ethanol and placebo in one experiment, and diazepam and placebo in the other. The main dependent measures were choice of drug over placebo and subjective responses to the drugs. Ethanol decreased self-reported anxiety in ANX subjects, but ANX subjects did not choose ethanol more often than CTL subjects. Diazepam did not measurably reduce anxiety, but ANX subjects nevertheless chose diazepam more often than did CTL subjects. Thus, there were some differences in drug responses between the ANX and CTL subjects, and the study provided limited support for the self-medication hypothesis. However, drug choice was not directly related to anxiolytic drug effects with either ethanol or diazepam. The procedure may be used to test other formulations of the self-medication hypothesis (e.g., examining other psychiatric risk factors).", 
    "17": "The effect of various psychotropic drugs on the ambivalent behaviour \"stretched approach posture\" (SAP) in the rat was assessed. SAP was elicited after a mild startle reaction due to physical contact with an electrified prod at one end of a straight runway. Using ethological observation methods, SAP as well as intention movements, prod contact, crossings, rearing, exploration, grooming and immobility were recorded. The benzodiazepine receptor agonists chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and alprazolam, the 5-HT1A receptor agonists flesinoxan and ipsapirone and the 5-HT uptake inhibitor clomipramine selectively (no effect on crossings) reduced SAP. Except for alprazolam, these drugs also reduced intention movements. In addition, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam enhanced prod contact. Reductions of SAP and intentions with concomitant reductions of crossings (nonspecific antiambivalent effects) were established for the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine and the MAO inhibitor clorgyline. The 5-HT uptake inhibitor fluvoxamine suppressed intention movements, but not SAP. The mixed 5-HT/NA uptake inhibitor imipramine did not significantly affect SAP or intentions, but reduced crossings. The 5-HT2C/1B receptor agonist m-CPP, the inverse BZD receptor agonists FG 7142 and DMCM, and the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine, to all of which putative anxiogenic effects have been ascribed, had no effect on SAP directed towards the prod. m-CPP, however, produced an increase in the stretched posture directed away from the prod (SAwayP). FG 7142 reduced intentions while strongly enhancing immobility (freezing). SAwayP and/or freezing may possibly reflect anxiogenic properties of drugs. The putative anxiogenic drug pentylenetetrazol false positively reduced SAP while increasing exploration. The dopamine-D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol and the catecholamine releaser dl-amphetamine had no effect on ambivalent behaviour. The muscarine receptor antagonist scopolamine reduced SAP and intentions while stimulating crossings. Finally, the 5-HT2C receptor antagonist ritanserine, the CCKA receptor antagonist devazepide, the CCKB receptor antagonist L-365.260 and the strychnine-insensitive glycine site antagonist 7-Cl-kynurenic acid were without effect on the behaviours in this paradigm using single doses. In conclusion, SAP and intention movements were reduced selectively by anxiolytic agents from different classes, including benzodiazepine receptor agonists, 5-HT1A receptor agonists and a 5-HT uptake inhibitor, whereas an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist and a MAO inhibitor reduced SAP non-selectively. SAP in relation to other behaviours may therefore serve as a valuable paradigm to characterize anxiolytic drugs.", 
    "18": "A continuing challenge for preclinical research on anxiolytic drugs is to capture the affective dimension that characterizes anxiety and aggression, either in their adaptive forms or when they become of clinical concern. Experimental protocols for the preclinical study of anxiolytic drugs typically involve the suppression of conditioned or unconditioned social and exploratory behavior (e.g., punished drinking or social interactions) and demonstrate the reversal of this behavioral suppression by drugs acting on the benzodiazepine-GABAA complex. Less frequently, aversive events engender increases in conditioned or unconditioned behavior that are reversed by anxiolytic drugs (e.g., fear-potentiated startle). More recently, putative anxiolytics which target 5-HT receptor subtypes produced effects in these traditional protocols that often are not systematic and robust. We propose ethological studies of vocal expressions in rodents and primates during social confrontations, separation from social companions, or exposure to aversive environmental events as promising sources of information on the affective features of behavior. This approach focuses on vocal and other display behavior with clear functional validity and homology. Drugs with anxiolytic effects that act on the benzodiazepine-GABAA receptor complex and on 5-HT1A receptors systematically and potently alter specific vocalizations in rodents and primates in a pharmacologically reversible manner; the specificity of these effects on vocalizations is evident due to the effectiveness of low doses that do not compromise other physiological and behavioral processes. Antagonists at the benzodiazepine receptor reverse the effects of full agonists on vocalizations, particularly when these occur in threatening, startling and distressing contexts. With the development of antagonists at 5-HT receptor subtypes, it can be anticipated that similar receptor-specificity can be established for the effects of 5-HT anxiolytics.", 
    "19": "Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rats have been proposed as an animal model of depression because they resemble depressed humans in that they have elevated REM sleep, reduced activity, and increased immobility and anhedonia after exposure to stressors. The present paper reviews experiments on the drug treatment of FSL and control Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) rats related to their utility as an animal model of depression, and presents new information. FSL rats exhibited exaggerated immobility in the forced swim test which is counteracted by the tricyclic antidepressants imipramine and desipramine and the serotonin reuptake blocker sertraline; the low immobility exhibited by the FRL rats is generally unaffected by these compounds. In contrast to these \"therapeutic\" effects of well recognized antidepressants, lithium and bright light treatment did not alter the exaggerated immobility of FSL rats. Novel data indicated that neither FSL nor FRL rats exhibited alterations in swim test immobility following chronic administration of the psychomotor stimulant amphetamine (2 mg/kg) and the anticholinergic scopolamine (2 mg/kg), which typically reduce immobility after acute administration. However, it was found that the calcium channel blockers verapamil (5 and 15 mg/kg) and nicardipine (10 mg/kg) did reduce the exaggerated immobility in FSL rats following chronic administration, suggesting that these compounds need to be evaluated further in humans. Previous studies have indicated no differences between FSL and FRL rats evaluated in the elevated plus maze, either at baseline or after the administration of diazepam, suggesting that the FSL rat may not differ from controls in anxiety-related behavior. Another recently published study showed that the FSL rat also did not differ from normal Sprague-Dawley rats in startle tests, indicating that the FSL rats do not exhibit behaviors shown in animal models of schizophrenia. These findings confirm the utility of FSL rats as an animal model of depression because the FSL rats do not appear to exhibit behaviors analogous to anxiety or schizophrenia and because they respond \"therapeutically\" to antidepressants and not psychomotor stimulants.", 
    "20": "The effects of cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor ligands were studied in the rat safety signal withdrawal conflict procedure, an operant paradigm sensitive to both anxiolytic and anxiogenic compounds. In this procedure, behavioural suppression of lever pressing for food was induced by the withdrawal of a conditioned signal for safety without the usual presentation of a conditioned signal for danger. The compounds tested were selective CCK-B antagonists [CI-988 (0.01-1 mg/kg SC), L-365,260 (0.004-2 mg/kg IP) and LY 262,691 (0.001-1 mg/kg SC)], CCK-B agonists [CCK-4 (0.01-1 mg/kg SC) and BC 264 (0.004-1 mg/kg IP)] and CCK-A antagonists [devazepide (0.001-1 mg/kg SC) and lorglumide (0.01-1 mg/kg SC)]. None of these drugs induced the expected behavioural effects, i.e. an anxiolytic-like release of the behavioural suppression with CCK-B and, possibly, CCK-A antagonists and/or a further reduction of lever pressing with CCK-B agonists, indicative of an anxiogenic-like potential. In contrast, the established anxiolytic lorazepam (0.06-0.25 mg/kg IP), as well as diazepam (2 mg/kg IP) and buspirone (0.25 mg/kg SC) used as positive control drugs, released the suppression of pressing for food during the period associated with the safety signal withdrawal, whereas picrotoxin (1 mg/kg IP), used as an anxiogenic control, further reduced responding during this conflict period. The present results contrast with a series of published data suggesting the involvement of CCK processes in anxiety-related behaviour in rodent models such as the elevated plus-maze or the light:dark two compartment test, and in panic disorders in humans.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "The present series of experiments examined the effects of five benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) partial inverse agonists on the behaviour of rats on an elevated plus maze. The drugs were tested in a standard plus maze with 3-cm walls added to the open arms, as this has been shown to increase the sensitivity of the plus maze to anxiogenic-like drugs effects (Jones and Cole 1995). The drugs tested were FG 7142 (0-100 mg/kg), beta-CCE (0-30 mg/kg), ZK 132,556 (0-100 mg/kg), ZK 90 886 (0-30 mg/kg) and Ro 15-4513 (0-30 mg/kg). In addition, to allow a comparison with previous studies, the effects of three reference substances, DMCM (0-2.5 mg/kg), pentylenetetrazol (PTZ; 0-30 mg/kg) and yohimbine (0-5 mg/kg), were also examined. These three reference compounds produced a dose-dependent reduction in the duration of open arm exploration and the total number of open arm entries, indicative of anxiogenic-like effects. DMCM produced significant effects at the doses of 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg, PTZ at 30 mg/kg, and yohimbine at 5 mg/kg. The BZR partial inverse agonist FG 7142 (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg) also reduced the duration of open arm exploration and the total number of arm entries. The minimally effective dose resulted in a receptor occupancy of approximately 80%. Ro 15-4513 also produced anxiogenic-like effects, but only at a dose (30 mg/kg) that resulted in a receptor occupancy of approximately 95%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "22": "The effects of the CCKB receptor antagonists L-365,260, CI-988 and L-740,093, a new compound with improved bioavailability and CNS penetration, were assessed for anxiolytic-like effects in three rat anxiolytic screens sensitive to benzodiazepines, the elevated plus maze (EPM), conditioned suppression of drinking (CSD) and conditioned emotional response (CER) tests. In the EPM, L-740,093 (0.1-1.0 mg/kg), L-365,260 (0.00001-10.0 mg/kg), and CI-988 (0.01-1.0 mg/kg) did not increase the time spent on the open arms of the maze or the number of entries onto the open arms. In contrast, the benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist, bretazenil (0.3-10.0 mg/kg), significantly increased both the time spent on the open arms and the number of open arm entries. In the CSD and the CER tests, L-740,093 (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) L-365,260 (0.0001-0.1 mg/kg) and CI-988 (0.01-10.0 mg/kg) failed to increase suppression ratios compared to the vehicle-treated control rats, whereas, the benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist FG 8205 (10.0 mg/kg) (CSD) and bretazenil (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) (CER) both significantly increased suppression ratios compared to vehicle-treated control rats. In addition, L-365,260 (1.0-50.0 mg/kg), CI-988 (0.1-10.0 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) were assessed in a squirrel monkey conflict procedure. Although diazepam significantly increased suppressed lever pressing rates, L-365,260 and CI-988 were without effect. The present findings provide little support for the hypothesis that CCKB receptor antagonists have anti-anxiety effects in animals.", 
    "23": "It is well established that benzodiazepines can produce anterograde amnesia in humans and interfere with the acquisition of passive avoidance and spatial responses in rodents. However, the extent to which the disruption of learning is a secondary effect of the sedation produced by these drugs has not been clearly established. In order to investigate this question, the effects of several BZ (omega) receptor partial agonists were studied on the acquisition of conditioned fear (passive avoidance learning) in mice. As these drugs have been shown to produce anticonvulsant and anxiolytic-like effects without sedation or depression of motor activity, it was of interest to see whether they could disrupt learning. Clear effects on the acquisition of conditioned fear were produced by imidazenil (0.01-1.0 mg/kg), divaplon (1-60 mg/kg), ZK 91296 (3-60 mg/kg), and Ro 17-1812 (0.1-10 mg/kg). However, bretazenil (0.1-10 mg/kg) did not produce statistically significant effects. Only the high dose of imidazenil (1.0 mg/kg) decreased levels of exploratory behaviour. These results show that BZ (omega) receptor partial agonists without apparent sedative actions can disrupt fear learning, indicating that the effects of this class of drugs on passive avoidance learning can be dissociated from sedation. The reasons for the observed differences between the different compounds studied are unclear at present and may be related to differences in intrinsic activity or receptor subtype selectivity.", 
    "24": "Psychopharmacotherapy of the elderly must take into account the effects of age-related changes in the structure and function of the brain and various organs. In general, older people are more sensitive than young people to both the therapeutic and toxic effects of psychotropic medications, necessitating lower doses and longer dosage intervals. This holds true for the treatment of 5 major types of psychiatric illness (depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, psychotic disorders and dementia). The tricyclic antidepressants, although efficacious, inexpensive, and backed by 30 years of experience, are less well tolerated by the elderly than are newer antidepressants such as the selective serotonin uptake inhibitors. Problems with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, including orthostatic hypotension and restrictions in diet and other medication use, have been overcome by the advent of reversible selective inhibitors of MAO-A, but the efficacy of these in the elderly has yet to be proven in clinical trials. Lithium remains the mainstay for the treatment of bipolar disorder. However, careful dosing and monitoring of plasma lithium concentrations are required in the elderly due to changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics which make older patients very sensitive to the toxic effects of this medication. Similarly, age-related changes in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the benzodiazepines, the most frequently prescribed medications for anxiety in the elderly, result in recommendations for lower doses and preferential use of those agents metabolised by conjugation (e.g. oxazepam). Buspirone, a partial serotonin 5-HT1A-agonist which is better tolerated than benzodiazepines in the elderly, may be used as an alternative. The elderly are extremely sensitive to extrapyramidal adverse effects which the typical antipsychotics (neuroleptics) exhibit to varying extents. The selection of a suitable agent for the treatment of a psychotic disorder should be based upon the adverse effect profile of the drug and the specific symptoms and situation of the patient. The newer atypical antipsychotics, clozapine and risperidone, have yet to be well-studied in the elderly. Dementia, exemplified by Alzheimer's disease, is almost exclusively an illness of the elderly. Only one medication, tacrine, has been approved for its treatment, based on extensive basic research and positive results of several clinical trials. Its long-term benefits have yet to be determined and it has several adverse effects, including a tendency to increase liver enzymes to the extent that the medication has to be discontinued.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Several areas of the rat cerebral cortex, hippocampus, mesencephalon, cerebellum and lateral geniculate nucleus were studied in animals, chronically treated with ethanol, and 24 or 48 hr after ethanol withdrawal. The [3H]flunitrazepam binding and the relative percentages of binding to BZ1 and BZ2 sites, using zolpidem as a BZ1 site inhibitor, are described. The cerebellum and red nucleus, which only express BZ1 binding sites, appear to be areas significantly modified by ethanol and its withdrawal. In no other structure did ethanol modify [3H]flunitrazepam binding nor change the relative percentage of BZ1 and BZ2 sites.", 
    "32": "Modulation of benzodiazepine receptor ligand binding to the GABAA receptor complex by the neuroactive steroids 3 alpha-hydroxy-dihydroprogesterone (3 alpha-OH-DHP) and 3 alpha-hydroxycorticosterone (3 alpha- THDOC) was assessed in an in vitro binding assay with the benzodiazepine antagonist [3H]flumazenil using rat cortical membranes. Neuroactive steroids, pentobarbital, GABA and bicuculline did not significantly affect flumazenil binding. However, the addition of neuroactive steroids significantly decreased the Ki of benzodiazepine agonists, including alprazolam, diazepam and clonazepam, indicating an increase in agonist affinity. Only the addition of 3 beta-OH-DHP, an inactive stereoisomer had no effect on the Ki of these agonists. The binding of the benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG 7142 was not significantly affected by these steroids, but the addition of GABA significantly increased the Ki of FG 7142 indicating a decrease in inverse agonist affinity. High concentrations of GABA or bicuculline were able to occlude the 3 alpha-THDOC mediated decrease in alprasolam Ki, indicating a GABA dependent mechanism of binding enhancement. An advantage of using [3H]flumazenil is that neither the Ki nor the Bmax change in the presence of allosteric site modulators, permitting the simple and direct assessment of alterations in benzodiazepine ligand affinity for the GABAA receptor complex by neuroactive steroids.", 
    "33": "The effects of nifedipine on the development of physical dependence on barbital and diazepam in rats were examined using the drug-admixed food method. Rats were chronically treated with either barbital- or barbital in combination with nifedipine-admixed food for 28 days, and with either diazepam- or diazepam in combination with nifedipine-admixed food for 26 days, on schedules of gradually increasing doses of barbital or diazepam. Withdrawal was conducted by substituting normal food for drug-admixed food on the last day of the treatment. Co-administration of nifedipine with barbital potentiated weight loss and withdrawal scores after the termination of barbital treatment. However, the withdrawal signs after the termination of diazepam treatment were not affected by co-administration of nifedipine with diazepam. These results suggest that nifedipine potentiates the development of physical dependence on barbital but not diazepam. It is known that co-administration of dihydropyridine derivative nitrendipine suppresses the development of physical dependence on ethanol. Basing on the differences in sensitivity of central depressants, barbiturates, benzodiazepines and ethanol, to three types of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, such as L-, N- and T-types studied so far, the development of physical dependence on central depressants may be modified differently by L-type Ca2+ channel blockers, corresponding to respective depressants.", 
    "34": "Due to the complex nature of endogenous and exogenous hormone concentration, formation, and metabolism and assay complexity, the pharmacokinetics of estrogen are difficult to study. Oral estrogens have minimal systemic bioavailability (2% to 10%) due to gut and liver (first-pass) metabolism. High concentrations of estrone are achieved with oral administration, whereas higher concentrations of estradiol are generally achieved after percutaneous absorption. Although vaginal products (such as gel, rings, etc.) are administered locally, they achieve high serum concentrations. Estradiol and estrone concentrations and estradiol-to-estrone ratios vary with different estrogen therapies. Approximately 95% to 98% of estradiol is bound loosely to albumin or tightly to sex hormone binding globulin, the major binding protein. The terminal half lives for the different estrogen compounds (after oral or intravenous administration) vary from 1-12 hours. Some conversion rates have been calculated between estrogen and its metabolites. Smoking decreases achievable estrogen concentrations, and has a greater effect on oral products. Oral contraceptives have been found to decrease antipyrine clearance. In the one study evaluating conjugated estrogens, antipyrine clearance was not altered. Oral contraceptives have a variable effect on the elimination of medications. Acetaminophen clearance is increased, whereas clearance of some benzodiazepines, caffeine,and prednisolone is decreased. Phenytoin increases the metabolism of conjugated estrogens. The various estrogen products may produce different clinical effects based on composition. The metabolites (minor components) of conjugated estrogens have been found to have significant effects on lipid concentrations, uterine weight, liver generated compounds, and bone resorption. Because transdermal products bypass the first-pass effect, delayed or decreased effects on lipid profiles and liver generated compounds have been observed.", 
    "35": "This review summarizes the data showing the possible involvement of an endogenous ligand for benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors, diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), in the development of alcohol dependence. The expression of cerebral DBI mRNA significantly increased in EtOH-inhaled and EtOH-withdrawn mice in comparison with that in EtOH-untreated mice, whereas the DBI mRNA level was not altered after a single administration of EtOH. After EtOH-withdrawal, this increase in the DBI mRNA expression in the mouse cerebral cortex diminished over 14 days despite the disappearance of withdrawal signs within 2 days after the withdrawal of EtOH. Simultaneous administration of flunitrazepam, a BDZ receptor agonist, with EtOH completely abolished the EtOH-induced increase in DBI mRNA expression. These results lead to the assumption that the changes in the expression of cerebral DBI mRNA induced by continuous EtOH treatment may be involved in the establishment of alcohol dependence, and such changes may be also regulated by BDZ receptors.",

    "37": "1. Muscimol, the specific GABAA receptor agonist, increased the secretion of catecholamines by chromaffin cells with an EC50 of 2.9 +/- 0.4 microM. 2. GABAA receptors of these cells were modulated by the same drugs which modulate GABAA receptors in brain tissue. 3. Benzodiazepines enhanced muscimol-evoked catecholamine secretion by between 20 and 80%. This effect seems to be mediated by binding to a central type of benzodiazepine receptor because it was completely blocked by the specific antagonist, Ro 15 1788. This antagonist was able to displace [3H]-flunitrazepam binding with an EC50 of 0.26 +/- 0.05 nM. 4. beta-Carbolines weakly inhibited muscimol-induced catecholamine secretion and were able to displace [3H]-flunitrazepam binding with an EC50 between 0.2 and 0.9 nM, depending on the beta-carboline used. 5. Pregnanolone and related neuroactive steroids enhanced muscimol-evoked catecholamine secretion by up to 87%, in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast pregnenolone weakly inhibited muscimol-evoked catecholamine secretion. 6. Zn2+ did not affect GABAA receptor-induced catecholamine secretion. 7.

In tubocurarine (0.6-0.8 microM)-partially paralyzed preparations, diazepam (35 microM) and Ro 5-4864 (3-30 microM), a peripheral type benzodiazepine receptor agonist, potentiated the inhibitory effect of adenosine on indirect twitch responses. 3. The central type receptor agonist, clonazepam did not affect the inhibitory effect of adenosine. 4. The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, PK11195 (1-10 microM) attenuated the adenosine inhibition and antagonized the potentiation by Ro 5-4864. 5. Ro 5-4864 failed to enhance further the inhibitory effect of adenosine in the presence of dipyridamole, an adenosine uptake inhibitor that also potentiated adenosine inhibition. 6. Neither Ro 5-4864 nor PK 11195 affected the inhibition produced by a stable adenosine analogue, 2-chloroadenosine, which is not a substrate for the adenosine uptake system. 7. Ro 5-4864 did not affect endplate potentials (e.p.ps) in the absence of adenosine, but reduced the amplitude of e.p.ps in the presence of adenosine without affecting miniature e.p.ps. 8.

    "39": "We have established a culture system for microexplants of rat cerebellar cortical tissue in which cells develop morphologically, express type-A receptors for the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and form GABAergic synaptic connections. Criteria of cell size and shape allow reliable identification of granule and Purkinje neurons, criteria confirmed by studies of the binding of antibodies to calbindin D28K and GABA. Both granule and Purkinje neurons express GABAA receptors, but granule neurons fall into two classes in terms of their sensitivity. Granule neurons which do not show spontaneous synaptic currents are relatively insensitive to GABA, while granule neurons with synaptic currents are much more sensitive. The responses of Purkinje neurons to application of 1 microM GABA are relatively insensitive to Zn2+ ion (10 microM), and are potentiated by chlordiazepoxide (100 microM) and La3+ ions (100 microM). Responses of innervated granule neurons, on the other hand, are blocked more strongly by Zn2+ ions, are less affected by chlordiazepoxide and are equally potentiated by La3+ ions. Hence these cultures provide a source of identifiable, functionally innervated cells which express distinct types of GABAA receptors.",

Itraconazole increased the area under the midazolam concentration-time curve six-fold (P < 0.001), the peak concentration 2.5-fold (P < 0.001) and the elimination half-life two-fold (P < 0.001) compared with placebo and terbinafine pretreatments. The pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ between placebo and terbinafine phases. The higher concentrations of midazolam during the itraconazole phase were associated with increased effects. In contrast to itraconazole, terbinafine had no effect on midazolam pharmacokinetics and psychomotor performance tests were unchanged from placebo.",

    "42": "The earliest treatments of anxiety included cathartics and emetics, which were used to remove the excess of black bile (hence our word melancholia) thought to be responsible for the patient's demeanor. By the 1700s, physicians were prescribing drugs that are more selective for the CNS, chiefly opium and strengthening tonics. In the 1860s, cardioactive drugs such as atropine, aconite, and digitalis were assumed to counteract anxiety because it could be associated with tachycardia and/or melancholia. A little later, the emergence of laboratory animal models, culminating in the conditioned avoidance response, and also Freudian psychiatry, permitted the evolution of new definitions of anxiety, as well as the introduction of sedative agents such as KBr, chloral hydrate, and barbiturates for its treatment. The first somewhat selective anxiolytics, reserpine, meprobamate, and chlorpromazine, appeared in the early 1950s, while in 1959 the benzodiazepines were the first to prove more selective than all the others in a systematic battery of screening tests.",

The aim of the present investigation was to establish dose-response curves for intravitreal and subconjunctivally injected pirenzepine and to determine receptor specificity. Chicks were monocularly deprived of form vision for five days and received daily injections of either pirenzepine or saline. Keratometry, retinoscopy and A-scan ultrasonography of axial ocular dimensions were then taken. Intravitreally injected pirenzepine was effective at preventing form deprivation myopia in a dose dependent manner with an ED50 of 175 micrograms. A 500 micrograms dose totally prevented induced myopia (+0.9 D versus -13.7 D) and axial enlargement (-0.14 mm versus +0.32 mm). Daily subconjunctival injection of pirenzepine was significantly less effective in preventing form deprivation myopia. Form deprivation myopia could still be induced in animals which had undergone pirenzepine treatment. Pirenzepine was effective in preventing the axial elongation associated with experimental myopia in a dose dependent manner and via a functional not toxic mechanism.", 
    "44": "The biodistribution, metabolism and excretion of 123I-iomazenil have been studied in rats, rabbits and humans following i.v. administration. In all the species, 123I-iomazenil was rapidly metabolized and more than 90% of the administrated radioactivity was excreted within the first 24 hr. Dominant metabolites were acid metabolite (R-COOH), glucuronide of the acid (R-COOH-Glc) and free iodide (I-) in rats and humans. On the other hand, R-COOH, oxidative metabolite (R'-CH2COOH) and I- were found in rabbits. Thus, the possible metabolic pathways of iomazenil were hydrolysis, oxidation, conjugation and deiodination. The radioactivity was excreted into both urine and feces in rats, while primary route of excretion in rabbits and humans was from the kidneys. At 3 hr after injection, more than 97% of the radioactivity in rat brain was found in the form of the parent compound. This result indicates that metabolites of 123I-iomazenil do not cross the blood-brain barrier.",

    "51": "The isoenzymes which catalyse the polymorphic hydroxylations of debrisoquine/sparteine and S-mephenytoin are cytochromes P450 2D6 and P450 2C19 (CYP2D6 and CYP2C19), respectively. CYP2D6 is involved in the stereospecific metabolism of several important groups of drugs, for example antiarrhythmics, antidepressants and neuroleptics. About 7% of Caucasians but only 1% of Orientals are poor metabolisers (PMs) of debrisoquine. The most common mutated allele CYP2D6B in Caucasian PMs is almost absent from their Oriental counterparts. On the other hand, the mean activity of CYP2D6 in Oriental extensive metabolisers (EMs) is lower than that in Caucasian EMs. This is due to the frequent distribution of a partially deficient CYP2D6 allele causing a Pro34-->Ser amino acid exchange in as many as 50% of Oriental alleles. This is the molecular genetic basis for slower metabolism of antidepressants and neuroleptics observed in Oriental compared with Caucasian people, and consequently for the lower dosages of these drugs used. While CYP2D6 catalyses the metabolism of lipophilic bases only, CYP2C19 is involved in the metabolism of acids (e.g. S-mephenytoin), bases (e.g. imipramine and omeprazole) and neutral drugs (e.g. diazepam). About 3% of Caucasians and 12 to 22% of Orientals are PMs of S-mephenytoin. Polymerase chain reaction-based genotyping techniques recently became available for the two CYP2C19 mutated alleles m1 and m2, which cause no enzyme to be expressed. M1 accounts for about 80% of the mutations responsible for the PM phenotypes in Caucasians, Oriental and Black people. Diazepam is partially demethylated by CYP2C19, and the high frequency of mutated alleles in Orientals is probably the reason why such populations have a slower metabolism and are treated with lower doses of diazepam than Caucasians. Omeprazole is to a major extent hydroxylated by CYP2C19, and there is an approximately 10-fold difference in oral clearance between EMs and PMs of S-mephenytoin. The separation of Caucasians from Orientals is fairly recent in the evolutionary process (40,000 to 60,000 years ago); the separation of Black from Caucasian/Oriental people occurred much earlier, about 150,000 years ago. As pronounced differences have been found between Caucasians and Orientals in the CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 enzymes, it might be expected that Black people will show even greater differences in this respect. Some studies have been performed with Black participants, but the picture is not clear. The mean CYP2D6 activity in Black EMs seems to be lower than that in Caucasian EMs and similar to that of Oriental EMs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "52": "Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine which differs in structure from the benzodiazepines and zopiclone. It is a strong sedative with only minor anxiolytic, myorelaxant and anticonvulsant properties, and has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining sleep in adults. The available evidence suggests that zolpidem produces no rebound or withdrawal effects, and patients have experienced good daytime alertness. Zolpidem 10mg in non-elderly and a reduced dose of 5mg in elderly individuals are clinically effective. In humans, the major metabolic routes include oxidation and hydroxylation; none of the metabolites appears to be pharmacologically active. The pharmacological activity of zolpidem results from selective binding to the central benzodiazepine receptors of the omega 1 subtype. Zolpidem is approximately 92% bound to plasma proteins; absolute bio-availability of zolpidem is about 70%. After single 20mg oral doses, typical values of pharmacokinetic variables for zolpidem in humans are: a peak plasma concentration of 192 to 324 micrograms/L occurring 0.75 to 2.6 hours postdose; a terminal elimination half-line of 1.5 to 3.2 hours; and total clearance of 0.24 to 0.27 ml/min/kg. Zolpidem pharmacokinetics are unchanged during multiple-dose treatment. Zolpidem pharmacokinetics are not significantly influenced by gender. Clearance of zolpidem in children is 3 times higher than in young adults, and is lower in very elderly people. There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters between various racial groups. Dosage reduction appears to be prudent in patients with renal disease, and caution should be exercised when prescribing zolpidem to elderly patients with hepatic impairment. Coadministration of haloperidol, cimetidine, ranitidine, chlorpromazine, warfarin, digoxin or flumazenil do not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolpidem; flumazenil predictably antagonises the hypnotic effects of zolpidem. Alertness tends to be reduced when cimetidine is combined with zolpidem. Volunteers treated with imipramine plus zolpidem developed anterograde amnesia.",

Objective and subjective performance tests were made before, and 30 and 90 min after the intake of midazolam. MID 10 and MID 15 moderately impaired performance on digit symbol substitution, letter cancellation and flicker fusion tests, and visual analogue scales revealed mild sedation. FLU + MID 10 had similar or slightly stronger effects than MID 10; it differed from MID 10 in that it lowered the flicker fusion threshold and produced subjective slowness and overall impairment. In study II 5 subjects received MID 10 after placebo, after FLU, and after 750 mg erythromycin (ERY) at 1-week intervals, following a crossover and double-blinded study design. Blood was sampled before MID intake and 30, 60 and 90 min after it, and performance was measured.

When ALDH activity assays were carried out spectrophotometrically on a hemoglobin-free lysate of human erythrocytes with propionaldehyde as substrate, addition of diazepam (10 mumol/l) did not affect the enzyme activity. When assays were carried out on intact or hemolysed erythrocytes using high performance liquid chromatographic technique with 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde as substrate, no significant increase in erythrocyte ALDH activity was found in the presence of chlordiazepoxide, oxazepam, diazepam, or desmethyldiazepam in the concentration range 1-20 mumol/l. Rather, a significant decrease (about 50%) in activity was obtained when lysed cells were incubated with 20 mumol/l chlordiazepoxide. Diazepam inhibited the rat liver mitochondrial low Km ALDH activity by about 50%. Disulfiram inhibited the ALDH activity almost completely in assays on human erythrocyte or rat liver mitochondrial ALDH. The ALDH activity was not regained by the subsequent addition of diazepam, nor was the effect of disulfiram reduced when diazepam was added prior to disulfiram. In an alcoholic subject who was followed during onset of disulfiram (Antabuse) therapy, the concurrent use of diazepam did not prevent a rapid decline in blood ALDH activity.

    "68": "The optimization of in vitro activity and oral potency and duration of action in vivo is described for three novel structural types of platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist: [1,5]benzodiazepines 5-12 onto which a variety of other heterocyclic rings were fused, pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]-diazepinones 13-26, and pyrazolo[3,4-b][1,4]diazepinones 27-46. Compounds 5-12 were prepared by elaboration of the [1,5]benzodiazepine-2-thiones 47 and 48, and 13-46 were prepared by cyclocondensation reactions of a variety of 2,3-diaminopyridine and 4,5-diaminopyrazole derivatives with ethyl 4'-(2-methylimidazo[4,5-c] pyrid-1-yl)benzoylacetate (53). The presence of imine-enamine tautomerism was observed in certain diazepine derivatives and is discussed. Structure-activity relationships were evaluated where PAF antagonist activity was measured in vitro by determining the concentration of compound (IC50) required to inhibit PAF-induced aggregation of rabbit washed platelets and in vivo by determining the oral dose (ED50) which protected mice from a lethal injection of PAF. In addition, the duration of action in conscious dogs as measured by determining the oral dose of selected compounds required to inhibit completely PAF-induced whole blood aggregation ex vivo. The most potent compound was 1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1,8-dimethyl-5-[4-(2-methylimidazo [4,5-c]pyrid-1-yl)phenyl]-7-oxo-3-(3-pyridyl) pyrazolo[3,4-b][1,4]diazepine (43, UK-91,473) (IC50 = 2.4 nM, ED50 = 0.01 mg/kg po), which was found to be significantly more potent in vivo (murine lethality) than the dihydropyridine PAF antagonist 4-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,4-dihydro-3-(ethoxycarbonyl)-6-methyl- 4-[(2-methylimidazo[4,5-c]pyrid-1-yl)phenyl]-5- [N-(2-pyridyl)carbamoyl]pyridine (4, UK-74,505) (ED50 = 0.26 mg/kg po). Compound 43 also possessed a longer duration of action than compound 4 in the conscious dog at one-fourth of the dose.

Structure-activity relationships were evaluated where PAF antagonist activity was measured in vitro by determining the concentration of compound (IC50) required to inhibit the PAF-induced aggregation of rabbit washed platelets and in vivo by determining the oral dose (ED50) which protected mice from a lethal injection of PAF. [1,5]Benzodiazepines, e.g., 14 (2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-4-[4-(2-methylimidazo[4,5-c] pyrid-1-yl)phenyl]-1H-[1,5]benzodiazepin-2-one) (IC50 = 4.9 nM, Ed50 = 0.03 mg/kg po), were found to possess equivalent or superior potency to the 1,4-dihydropyridine PAF antagonist UK-74,505 (1,4-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,4-dihydro-3-(ethoxycarbonyl)-6-methyl-2- [4-(2-methylimidazo[4,5-c]pyrid-1-yl)phenyl]-5-[N-(2-pyridyl) carbamoyl]pyridine) in vitro and in vivo.

These investigations prompted the synthesis and evaluation of additional diazepine derivatives, which are described in the following paper. The relationship between the key PAF antagonist pharmacophores of 2-methyl-1-phenylimidazo[4,5-c]pyridine, a triazolothienodiazepine (WEB2170), and a pyrrolothiazolidine (RP-52,770) is discussed.", 
    "70": "The isoquinoline carboxamide photoaffinity probe PK14105, a ligand with selectivity for mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors, has been established to photolabel an 18-kDa protein. When this radioactive probe is used to photolabel rat mitochondrial preparations, a protein of 10 kDa, in addition to the 18-kDa protein, is identified following electrophoretic separation and extended autoradiography. These proteins are referred to herein as pk10 and pk18, respectively. Both proteins exhibited the same specificity to a series of ligands used in competition photolabeling studies and are mutually present at apparently similar ratios across multiple tissues. Subcellular fractionation of rat adrenals indicated that pk10 and pk18 comigrated with the mitochondrial marker enzyme cytochrome c oxidase. In numerous paradigms examining specificity, photolabeling of pk18 invariably coincided with photolabeling of pk10. In detergent-solubilized extracts of rat adrenal mitochondria, pk18 and pk10 coimmunoprecipitated when using antisera raised against pk18. Furthermore, purification of the photolabeled proteins using nondenaturing conditions demonstrated that pk18 and pk10 copurify substantiating their intimate association. A set of three antisera, specific to different regions of pk18, did not recognize pk10 on Western blots. Likewise, partial amino acid sequence of peptide fragments indicate that pk10 is not derived from proteolytic cleavage of pk18. These data suggest that pk10 represents another component of mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors whose identity is not apparent with any known protein.", 
    "71": "We tested whether a high spinal anesthesia may alter the susceptibility to the soporific effects of sedatives. Twenty ASA grade I and II women undergoing elective abdominal hysterectomy were randomly allocated into two groups. Patients in Group I were given a subarachnoid injection of 12 mg hyperbaric tetracaine and those patients who after 10 min had a sensory level of T4-6 (10 patients) were included in the study. Ten additional patients (Group II) received no spinal injection. Induction of anesthesia was performed on all patients by injecting 1 mg of midazolam intravenously every 30 s until the patient failed to respond to three repeated commands to squeeze the anesthetist's hand. This was considered the induction dose or end-point for the purposes of the study. Patients were then given a neuromuscular blocker, ventilated with oxygen, nitrous oxide, and a volatile anesthetic, tracheally intubated, and maintained under general anesthesia for the remainder of the operation. The dose of midazolam administered to the point of patient failure to respond to command was 7.6 +/- 0.72 mg SEM for Group I and 14.7 +/- 1.16 mg SEM for Group II, (P < 0.0001). These results support the conclusion that patients having a high spinal anesthetic are more sensitive to the sedative effects of midazolam.", 
    "72": "Since volatile anesthetics, barbiturates, and local anesthetics have been reported to inhibit endothelium-dependent relaxation, we hypothesized that any drug with anesthetic action would suppress this relaxation. In the present study, using rat thoracic aortae, we attempted to determine whether nonbarbiturate intravenous anesthetics, including midazolam, propofol, and ketamine, suppress endothelium-dependent relaxation, and to clarify the mechanism(s) involved. Acetylcholine-induced, endothelium-dependent relaxation was significantly attenuated by propofol and ketamine, but was unaffected by midazolam. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced relaxation was attenuated by propofol, but not by midazolam or ketamine. The acetylcholine-stimulated 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) level was reduced by pretreatment with propofol and ketamine but not by midazolam, and that stimulated by SNP was reduced by propofol but not by ketamine or midazolam. We conclude that propofol and ketamine suppress endothelium-dependent relaxation, whereas midazolam has no influence. Moreover, the suppressive effect of ketamine on endothelium-dependent relaxation is mediated by suppression of nitrous oxide (NO) formation, whereas that of propofol may be mediated at least partly by suppression of NO function.", 
    "73": "Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) and catatonia share many clinical features and distinguishing between them on the basis of the physical examination may be difficult and even impossible. Although several reports have been made of NCSE simulating catatonia, there are no published cases of catatonia mimicking NCSE. We report a 24-year-old woman whose initial examination was notable for a fixed stare, no response to voice or command, gaze preference, tonic head posturing, constant stereotypic chewing movements, profuse foamy salivation, and dramatic response to the parenteral administration of benzodiazepines (BZDs). She was initially misdiagnosed as having NCSE. EEG, however, was normal. We believe this is the first published report of catatonia simulating NCSE. The EEg may be more useful than the clinical examination in distinguishing NCSE from catatonia.",

In situ hybridization, radioligand autoradiography, and immunocytochemistry were used to examine GABAA/BZ receptor alpha 1, alpha 6, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 subunit expression in murine Purkinje, granule, and deep cerebellar neurons after in vivo ethanol exposure. Chronic ethanol treatment resulted in decreased alpha 1 subunit mRNA expression in each cell type, whereas the expression of alpha 6 and gamma 2 subunit mRNA levels increased; no changes were observed in the expression of beta 2 and beta 3 subunit mRNA. GABA and BZ agonist binding and antibody staining paralleled the changes in mRNA levels. Acute ethanol injection resulted in increased expression of alpha 1 and beta 3 mRNAs, whereas levels of alpha 6, beta 2, and gamma 2 mRNAs remained stable. Our results indicate that, in cerebellar neurons, the expression of specific GABAA/BZ receptor subunit mRNAs, polypeptides, and binding sites is independently regulated by in vivo administration of alcohol. The observed changes were not restricted to any one cerebellar cell type, because subunit expression in Purkinje, granule, and deep cerebellar cells was similarly affected.",

A clonal cell line (S2-Dm1-1) has been isolated which, after induction of mAChR expression with CuSO4, exhibits high-affinity, saturable, specific binding of the muscarinic antagonist N-methyl scopolamine (NMS). The apparent molecular mass of the expressed protein, calculated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), is in good agreement with the apparent molecular mass of mAChRs purified from Drosophila brain. Functional expression of the cloned mAChR in this stable cell line has been demonstrated by quantitative fluorescence ratio-imaging of Fura-2-loaded cells. We have observed transient, agonist-induced elevations in intracellular Ca2+ levels which can be completely blocked by atropine, whereas AFDX-116, a muscarinic antagonist which binds preferentially to the vertebrate mAChR M2 subtype, has little effect at 100 mumol l-1.

For carboquinones, networks with one hidden layer processing element (PE) for each compound achieved significantly better training set RMSE values than corresponding back-propagation and multiregression results and test set RMSE values as good or slightly worse than back-propagation. Test set results improved by 10-15% using networks with fewer hidden layer PEs than carboquinones; the smallest test set RMSE values are between 0 and 10% better than back-propagation values, about 1.3 times greater than corresponding training set values, and occur when there are about as many competitive layer PEs as there are compounds in the data set. Training set RMSE values increase with decreasing number of competitive layer PEs and approach those of test sets. Both counter-propagation and back-propagation networks, however, have worse predictive capability than multiregression. For benzodiazepines, networks with one hidden layer PE for each compound achieved significantly better training set RMSE values than back-propagation and multiregression results and test set RMSE values slightly worse than back-propagation. Test set results improved by 10-15% using fewer hidden layer PEs than benzodiazepines; the smallest test set RMSE values are 0-10% better than back-propagation values, about 1.3 times greater than training set values, and occur when there are about half as many competitive layer PEs as there are compounds in the data set.

In 9 patients ureteroscopy was performed with lindocaine jelly in the urethra only, and in 129 with additional intravenous analgesia Fentanyl, a synthetic morphine derivative, was used for intravenous analgesia. Ureteroscopy was performed for stone fragmentation or extraction in 119 patients for taking away a double J catheter which showed migration into ureter in 8 and for diagnostic purposes in 11. Ureteric lesions were observed in 7 patients (5%). The findings suggest that ureteroscopy when performed without general or regional anaesthesia does not increase the risk of complications or compromise the results of treatment.",

But, in this report, the effect of diazepam in the treatment of infantile spasms and intractable epilepsies were reported. Single high-dose oral administration of diazepam at bedtime was tried to the patients with intractable seizures. There were good responses to the therapy of partial seizures and infantile spasms basically escaping from hypsarhythmia. The therapeutic range of blood concentration was not decided, but probably the following values are necessary; over 200 nl/ml for partial seizures and over 300 ng/ml for infantile spasms 2 hours after the administration. Plasma level of diazepam during the daytime was very low, but the seizures were controlled sufficiently.",

Customers buying drugs at 54 pharmacies were interviewed during peak shopping hours. The mode of acquisition of the drugs was classified as self-medication, medical prescription, or prescription from pharmacy salesperson, and the drugs were grouped as essential or nonessential. Products that are prohibited or greatly restricted in other countries were also identified. The most frequently bought products were analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamins, broad-spectrum antibiotics, steroids, cold and flu medications, narrow-spectrum antibiotics, and benzodiazepines. Of 1388 products sold, 394 (28.4%) appear on the list of essential drugs. The mode of acquisition was self-medication for 51.4% of the sales, medical prescription for 35.6%, and recommendation of a pharmacy employee for 13%. In addition, 14.3% of the products bought were prohibited or restricted in other countries. The results highlighted the need for greater precision in the General Health Law of Mexico with regard to regulation of drug sales. The results also imply the need for other actions, namely, educational campaigns directed to the general population to discourage self-medication; Strengthening of coordination between government and the pharmaceutical industry; improvement in the availability of and information on generic drugs; and modification of pharmacological training programs.",

    "89": "Of 467 patients with preeclampsia or superimposed preeclampsia managed without seizure prophylaxis, 18 had seizure activity, 3.9% (95% confidence interval 2.3% to 6.0%). There was no seizure-related maternal mortality or major morbidity, and the perinatal mortality rate after 28 gestational weeks was the same in patients with or without seizures. By logistic regression seizures were 17.4 times more likely in preeclampsia and 8.1 times more likely in chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia, compared with gestational or chronic hypertension alone.",

    "91": "Although parasites are reported to alter host responses to predators, little is known about the neurochemical mechanisms involved. Using an odour preference test, we examined the effects of an acute, subclinical infection with the naturally occurring, single host, enteric protozoan parasite, Eimeria vermiformis, on the responses of male laboratory mice, Mus musculus, to a predator. Uninfected mice avoided the odour of a predatory cat, spending a minimal amount of time in a Y-maze in the vicinity of the cat odour. In contrast, mice infected with E. vermiformis, spent a significantly greater amount of time in the proximity of the cat odour, showing a reduced avoidance of the cat odour and a reduction in predator-induced fear or anxiety. This was not related to augmented opioid activity and decreased pain sensitivity in the infected mice, as neither treatment with the exogenous opiate, morphine, nor restraint stress-induced augmentation of endogenous opioid activity, had any significant effects on the responses of uninfected mice to cat odour. The altered responses of the infected mice to the cat odour were reduced by peripheral administration of the gamma-aminobutyric A (GABAA) antagonists, bicuculline and picrotoxin, but were not significantly affected by either the benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788, the opiate antagonist, naloxone, or the excitatory amino acid, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, MK-801. These results indicate that infection with E. vermiformis in mice reduces the avoidance of predator odour through neurochemical systems associated with anxiety involving, at least in part, GABAA receptor mechanisms.", 
    "92": "Chronic treatments with drugs that stimulate or potentiate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor function cause uncoupling of allosteric sites and downregulation of the GABAA receptors expressed in neurons. To study these effects on receptors having a defined subunit composition, we treated stably transfected mouse Ltk- cells (PA3 cells) with drugs known to uncouple GABAA receptors. Because dexamethasone controls the expression of bovine alpha-1, beta-1 and gamma 2L GABAA receptor subunit genes in PA3 cells, this expression system provides a way to study receptors in the absence of neuronal subunit gene promoters. We assayed binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to measure allosteric coupling and uptake of 36Cl- to measure GABAA receptor function. Chronic (4 day) treatment of PA3 cells with muscimol, GABA or flunitrazepam reduced the GABA enhancement of binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to PA3 cells. Chronic flurazepam or muscimol treatments also caused downregulation of benzodiazepine potentiation of muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake. Chronic treatment with muscimol did not affect levels of subunit mRNAS and alpha 1- or beta 1-subunit protein of GABAA receptors and chronic flunitrazepam did not affect subunit mRNAs or alpha 1 protein. We conclude that chronic drug treatments regulate allosteric coupling and function of GABAA receptors in stably transfected cells and this regulation cannot be attributed to decreases in the expression of receptor subunits or to expression of subunits other than alpha 1 beta 1 or gamma 2L.", 
    "93": "The anticonvulsant effects of 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(f)quinoxaline (NBQX), phencyclidine (PCP) and diazepam against audiogenic seizures in DBA/2 mice and against seizures induced by methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) in NMRI mice were compared. Motor impairment was assessed in a rotarod apparatus in DBA/2 as well as NMRI mice. At 30 min after i.p. administration, NBQX was as effective as PCP and diazepam in protecting against audiogenic seizures and had a therapeutic ratio slightly higher than diazepam's and 7-fold higher than PCP's. Whereas diazepam was fully effective, NBQX and PCP were both ineffective against seizures induced by DMCM 30 min after i.p. administration. The anticonvulsant potential and motor-impairing effects of NBQX were evaluated further by the i.p. and the i.v. routes at different time points after administration. At all pretreatment intervals, NBQX protected against audiogenic seizures more potently than it produced motor impairment. NBQX administered i.p. protected against DMCM-induced seizures when given 15 min but not 5 min before testing, whereas after i.v. administration NBQX produced anticonvulsant and motor-impairing effects in the same dose range. NBQX only slightly and non-dose-dependently attenuated the discriminative effects of pentylenetetrazole in rats, showing a limited anxiolytic potential. NBQX produced no PCP-like or morphine-like discriminative effects in rats, suggesting lack of PCP or opiate-like subjective effects. These data demonstrate that NBQX has anticonvulsant effects, has limited anxiolytic effects, and does not produce subjective effects of PCP or opiate type.", 
    "94": "The time course of the novel benzodiazepine inverse agonist, RO19--4603 (0.075 or 0.150 mg/kg) in antagonizing the depressant effects of ethanol (EtOH) (0.50, 1.0 and 1.5 g/kg) and the development of tolerance on locomotor behaviors (e.g., ambulatory count, total distance and stereotypy count) were investigated in Sprague-Dawley rats given EtOH injections spaced at 24-hr intervals. A single dose of RO19--4603 prevented the development of tolerance to the 0.50- and 1.0-g/kg EtOH doses 24-hr post-RO19--4603 administration on most locomotor behaviors. On Day 1, the 0.150-mg/kg RO19--4603 dose prevented the reduction of motor behaviors after the 1.0- and 1.5-g/kg EtOH doses, whereas the 0.075-mg/kg RO19--4603 dose prevented the reduction of motor behaviors only after the 1.5-g/kg EtOH dose. The 0.075- and 0.150-mg/kg RO19--4603 doses also prevented the EtOH-induced reduction of motor behaviors after the 1.5-g/kg EtOH dose 24-hr post-RO19--4603 administration. RO19--4603 was without effect on activity when given alone. These data suggest that the motor impairing effects of EtOH and the development of tolerance to them may involve gamma-aminobutyric acidA-benzodiazepine receptor mechanisms that when occupied, even briefly by certain benzodiazepine inverse agonists, produce long-lasting effects on locomotion and tolerance.", 
    "95": "CPB produces changes in the blood-gas partition coefficient dependent on the prime used and temperature. Fortunately, the overall effect for hypothermic CPB and a crystalloid prime is only +2%. A volatile agent started during hypothermic CPB takes longer to equilibrate and agents already in use need to re-equilibrate, potentially changing the depth of anaesthesia, until equilibration is complete. As these agents are metabolized to a small degree and washout is fast, the duration of action is not prolonged after CPB.", 
    "96": "Cultured cerebellar granule cells become vulnerable to excitatory amino acids, especially to NMDA and kainate, by 9 days in vitro. In the same time, the sensitivity of cells to (RS)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA), in terms of AMPA-induced toxicity or 45Ca2+ uptake, was very low. The low AMPA responsiveness was due to receptor desensitization, because agents known to block desensitization, cyclothiazide and the lectins concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin, rendered granule cells vulnerable to AMPA and produced a pronounced stimulation of 45Ca2+ accumulation. 45Ca2+ influx was induced specifically by AMPA-receptor stimulation, because it was blocked virtually completely by 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzoquinoxaline (NBQX) and the benzodiazepine GYKI 52466 (selective non-NMDA receptor antagonists). Nevertheless, indirect routes activated by cellular responses to AMPA-receptor stimulation contributed significantly to the overall 45Ca2+ influx. These included Ca2+ uptake through NMDA-receptor channels, voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels, and via Na+/Ca2+ exchange. However, nearly one-fifth of the total 45Ca2+ influx remained unaccounted for and this estimate was similar to 45Ca2+ influx observed under Na(+)-free conditions. This observation suggested that a significant proportion of the Ca2+ flux passes through the AMPA-receptor channel proper, a view supported by Co2+ uptake into nearly all granule cells on exposure to AMPA in the presence of cyclothiazide. Results are discussed in light of the reported AMPA receptor-subunit composition of cerebellar granule cells in vitro.", 
    "97": "Sedation, with or without analgesia, is commonly used for colonoscopy procedures in the United States. Prudent drug product selection, careful titration of drug dosage to ensure use of the lowest effective dose (Table 1), and vigilant monitoring of medicated patients will optimize the value of conscious sedation in colonoscopy. When a close patient-physician relationship exists in the primary care setting, use of medications only \"if needed\" during the procedure may be a reasonable alternative that can minimize the exposure of patients to sedation-related side effects. Patient-controlled medication delivery may be one method used to address patient variability in the need for sedation.", 
    "98": "The effects of different housing conditions and ethanol treatment (6 vol % in the drinking water) on the in vitro binding characteristics of striatal dopaminergic D2 ([3H]spiperone), hippocampal serotonergic 5-HT1A ([3H]8-OH-DPAT), and cortical benzodiazepine ([3H]flunitrazepam) receptors have been examined. Social deprivation due to contact caging, short- (1 day) and long-term isolation (5 weeks) yielded a significant decrease of striatal D2 receptor density with the greatest decrease after long-term isolation (-21% Bmax) without changes of Kd in comparison to group animals. The effect of ethanol on striatal D2 receptor density depended on the housing conditions. Whereas ethanol treatment reduced receptor density of group animals (down to 88%), chronic exposure to ethanol under long-term isolation elicited no significant alteration of D2 receptor density compared with group animals. Different housing and ethanol treatment had no effect on 5-HT1A receptor affinity and density. Alterations of benzodiazepine receptor density were not found, but social deprivation as well as ethanol treatment of group animals caused an increased affinity of [3H]flunitrazepam (reduced Kd value). These results indicate that different housing conditions of adult rats evoked significant alterations in D2 and benzodiazepine receptor binding assays, which were modified by ethanol treatment in the case of striatal D2 receptor density.", 
    "99": "The possible antiethanol effect of intracerebellarly microinjected Ro15-4513 was investigated using motor incoordination as the test response. The results of this study further confirmed reports from this and other laboratories that this partially negative ligand of benzodiazepine selectively attenuated and nearly reversed the motor impairment of acute ethanol. The attenuation observed after microinjections of doses of 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 ng was significant and dose related. There was no effect on normal coordination when the highest dose, 0.5 ng, was administered followed by saline instead of a test dose of ethanol. When 0.5 ng of Ro15-4513 alone was microinjected into the cerebellum, no significant change in the locomotor activity was observed. Even a 10-fold higher intracerebellar dose (5 ng) of Ro15-4513 administered alone produced no significant changes in locomotor activity. This suggests that attenuation of ethanol-induced motor incoordination was most likely due to the selective antiethanol effect of Ro15-4513 at the dose range used in the present investigation. The antiethanol effect of intracerebellar Ro15-4513 also reaffirmed the well-known belief that the cerebellum is an important brain region for ethanol's motor-impairing effect. The results also indirectly suggest the inhibition of GABAA-gated chloride ion channel activity as the most likely basis of Ro15-4513's antiethanol effect.", 
    "100": "Both in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that Ro 15-4513 can antagonize many of the pharmacologic actions of ethanol. In contrast to many benzodiazepine receptor (BzR) ligands, Ro 15-4513 binds with high affinity to a novel GABAA receptor subtype, referred to as \"diazepam-insensitive\" (DI). This study examined the contribution of DI GABAA receptors to the modulation of ethanol-induced sleep time by Ro 15-4513 and related imidazobenzodiazepines [e.g., Ro 19-4603, Ro 16-6028, and ZG-63 (t-butyl-8-chloro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-imidazo[1,5,a] [1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate)] that possess high affinities for this GABAA receptor subtype. Ro 15-4513 (0.6-5 mg/kg) significantly reduced ethanol (3.5 g/kg, i.p.) sleep time in mice (p < 0.001, analysis of variance). This effect was not blocked by BzR antagonists ZK 93426 (5 mg/kg) and Ro 14-7437 (5 mg/kg), which possess low affinities for DI but bind with high affinities to other \"diazepam-sensitive\" (DS) GABAA receptor isoforms. Although Ro 19-4603 (2.5 mg/kg) also reduced ethanol sleep time (p < 0.01), this effect was attenuated by coadministration of ZK 93426 (2.5 mg/kg). Ro 16-6028 (2.5 mg/kg) prolonged (p < 0.01) ethanol sleep time. However, in the presence of either Ro 19-7437 (5 mg/kg) or ZK 93426 (2.5 mg/kg) ethanol-induced sleep time was reduced to values approaching those obtained with ethanol in the presence of Ro 15-4513. A low dose (2.5 mg/kg) of ZG-63 did not significantly affect alcohol sleep time. However, in the presence of ZK 93426, ZG-63 increased sleep time (p < 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "101": "The ability of ovarian steroids to regulate the excitability of hippocampal neurons may be mediated by alterations in the inhibitory activity of GABA. We assessed the ability of estradiol, progesterone, and 3 alpha-OH-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (3 alpha-OH-DHP; a metabolite of progesterone) to regulate gene expression of selected GABAA receptor subunits (alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, beta 2, and gamma 2). Using in situ hybridization, we found that progesterone, or 3 alpha-OH-DHP, suppressed mRNA levels for the alpha 1 subunit in the CA2, CA3, and the dentate gyrus subfields of the hippocampus in animals that were pretreated with estradiol. Progesterone had a more limited effect on the alpha 2 subunit, suppressing mRNA levels in estradiol-primed animals only in the CA3 region. In contrast, progesterone increased mRNA levels for the gamma 2 subunit in the CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions of the hippocampus, but only in animals that were not estradiol-primed. Estradiol alone had no significant effect on the expression of any subunit examined. Beta 1 and beta 2 subunit mRNA levels were not altered by any of the hormones tested. These data support the conclusion that progesterone and its metabolites may regulate excitability of the hippocampus by modulating the GABAA receptor gene expression; these effects of progesterone are dependent upon the circulating levels of estradiol. Alterations in the gene expression of selective subunits may lead to changes in the density of GABAA receptor protein or to changes in receptor subunit composition which might alter receptor sensitivity to activation by GABA or modulators such as the benzodiazepines and convulsants.", 
    "102": "Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) plays a role in coordinating endocrine, autonomic, and behavioral responses to stressful stimuli. Benzodiazepines exert many effects which oppose those of CRF, including anxiolysis and suppression of the pituitary-adrenal axis. In the present study, we employed in situ analysis of CRF heteronucleous RNA (hnRNA) and c-fos mRNA to assess stimulus-induced CRF gene transcription rate following stress and its modulation by chlordiazepoxide (CDP). Male albino rats were exposed to restraint stress for 30 min and sacrificed 30 and 120 min after the onset of stress. Either CDP or vehicle was given intraperitoneally 60 min before stress. To determine plasma ACTH levels by immunoradiometric assay, another group of rats was decapitated 10 min after the onset of restraint stress. Restraint stress induced rapidly and significantly c-fos mRNA and CRF hnRNA expression in the PVN at the 30 min time point. Increases in both RNA copies were significantly inhibited by administration of CDP at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg. CRF mRNA concentrations were increased significantly in the PVN 120 min after stress and again, CDP attenuated significantly these increases in the PVN. The plasma ACTH increase in response to stress was inhibited significantly by CDP administration at every dose tested. CDP did not change CRF mRNA levels in the non-stressed animal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "103": "This study involved the evaluation of the Abbott TDx serum benzodiazepine assay, a fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA), for the detection of lorazepam, adinazolam, and N-desmethyladinazolam in serum. Precision of the assay was determined by using three control serums containing 75, 300, and 700 ng/mL nordiazepam. Between-run precision studies (N = 22) gave mean values of 76, 306, and 690 ng/mL with coefficients of variation of 6.5, 3.3, and 5.7%, respectively. Percent cross-reactivity of serum lorazepam standards (35-500 ng/mL) ranged from 29 to 69%. The cross-reactivity of serum adinazolam ranged from 40 to 47% between 50 and 150 ng/mL and from 38 to 55% for N-desmethyladinazolam between 50 and 250 ng/mL. Serum specimens (48) collected from individuals known to be receiving lorazepam were analyzed. Twenty-two specimens were positive for benzodiazepines. Serum specimens were collected from 0.25 to 24 h after administering a 15-mg oral dose of adinazolam to six volunteers. The FPIA results were compared with combined high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) results for adinazolam and N-desmethyladinazolam. The FPIA method did not detect benzodiazepines at 0.25 h after administration of adinazolam but did detect benzodiazepines from 0.5 to 24 h after administration. The correlation between HPLC (N-desmethyladinazolam) and FPIA results by regression analysis gave the following: y = 0.937x + 4.449, r = 0.98, n = 15. It was concluded that the Abbott FPIA assay for benzodiazepines can detect lorazepam when prescribed in therapeutic doses and when present at greater than 25 ng/mL and can semiquantitatively detect adinazolam or N-desmethyladinazolam or both when present at concentrations greater than 50 ng/mL.", 
    "104": "The purpose of this report is to describe the anaesthetic considerations for layngoplastic procedures. Thyroplasty is a procedure which restores the voice in unilateral vocal cord paralysis. The procedure employs an external approach via a window cut at the appropriate level in the thyroid ala. A wedge of silastic is inserted against the inner perichondrium, thereby displacing the vocal cord medially and permitting voice production. Correct placement of the implant is assessed by asking the patient to phonate; patient cooperation is therefore necessary at certain times during the procedure. We describe our management of a patient undergoing thyroplasty. The use of a benzodiazepine agonist-antagonist combination provided both optimal operating conditions and patient comfort.", 
    "105": "In a randomized, double-blind study we have examined the analgesic efficacy of caudal administration of midazolam, bupivacaine, or a mixture of both drugs in 45 children, undergoing inguinal herniotomy. They were allocated randomly into three groups (n = 15 in each) to receive a caudal injection of either 0.25% bupivacaine 1 ml.kg-1 with or without midazolam 50 micrograms.kg-1 or midazolam 50 micrograms.kg-1 with normal saline 1 ml.kg-1. There were no differences in quality of pain relief, postoperative behaviour or analgesic requirements between the midazolam group and the other two groups. Times to first analgesic administration (paracetamol suppositories) were longer (P < 0.001) in the bupivacaine-midazolam group than in the other two groups. Further, the bupivacaine-midazolam group received fewer (P < 0.05) doses of paracetamol than the bupivacaine group. Side effects such as motor weakness, respiratory depression or prolonged sedation were not observed in patients who received caudal epidural midazolam only. We conclude that caudal midazolam in a dose of 50 micrograms.kg-1 provides equivalent analgesia to bupivacaine 0.25%, when administered postoperatively in a volume of 1 ml.kg-1 for children following unilateral inguinal herniotomy.",

    "110": "We have previously shown that blocking GABAA receptors with bicuculline in the dorsal and lateral quadrants of the rostral two-thirds of the midbrain central gray (MCG) in rats reduces the lordosis quotient (LQ) and proceptive behaviors without increasing the defensive index (McCarthy, Pfaff, and Schwartz-Giblin, 1991b), indicating that tonic release of endogenous GABA in the MCG has a primary facilitatory effect on reproductive behaviors. The present study tests whether two modulators of the GABAA-benzodiazepine-receptor complex, diazepam and the progesterone metabolite, allopregnanolone, facilitate female receptivity as well as open-field behavior. Ovariectomized estradiol benzoate (EB)-treated rats were bilaterally infused in the MCG with vehicle, diazepam, or allopregnanolone and tested 20 min after diazepam and 12 min after allopregnanolone. Animals were tested once each for both receptive or open-field behavior with testing sessions being at least 1 week apart in a crossover design between vehicle and one of the two drugs. Both diazepam and allopregnanolone significantly increased the lordosis quotient in a dose-dependent manner, the lowest effective dose tested being 100 and 250 ng, respectively. In the open-field test, infusion of diazepam (100 ng) in EB-treated rats significantly increased the ratio of central squares entered to total squares entered (C/T) without a change in total activity. Rats without EB elicited comparable C/T ratios when tested with five times as much diazepam. Diazepam infusions at more dorsal sites in the midbrain and in overlying cortex were without effect on C/T ratios in EB-treated rats. Allopregnanolone (500 ng) infusions in MCG of EB-treated rats did not alter C/T ratios compared to animals without EB. Our results are consistent with diazepam and allopregnanolone acting through the GABAA receptors of the MCG to enhance female sexual receptivity and with estradiol potentiating the effect of diazepam in the MCG to increase open-field behavior.", 
    "111": "The following double-blind, randomised study dealt with three questions: (1) Is a multidimensional psychometric rating scale suitable for the measurement of mood before anaesthesia? (2) What are the effects of the new benzodiazepine-like drug zolpidem on preoperative mood compared with phenobarbital? (3) Is the combination with Promethazine suggestive? METHODS. Three hundred and four patients were assigned to four groups (group 1: zolpidem 8.03 mg/promethazine 50 mg; group 2: zolpidem 8.03 mg/placebo; group 3: phenobarbital 100 mg/promethazine 50 mg; group 4: phenobarbital 100 mg/placebo). The drugs were given the evening before anaesthesia (09:30-10:00 p.m.). The sample was shifted by age and sex. Mood was measured by a multidimensional rating scale, which assessed aspects of elated mood, anxiety, hostility, deactivation, vigilance, and introversion. Statistics were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS. Zolpidem led to significantly higher expressions of hostility (negative mood, irritability, aggressiveness) than phenobarbital. Compared with placebo, promethazine led to greater deactivation (more tiredness and numbness, lower level of wakefulness). Specific emotions and somatic aspects were not affected. Patients who had received promethazine received a lower dose of thiopentone for induction of anaesthesia than patients with placebo. CONCLUSIONS. Zolpidem and phenobarbital have many common effects on preoperative mood. Differences were found in the unspecific emotional aspects of agitation and hostility. These negative effects must be weighed against the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic advantages of zolpidem when this drug is administered for premedication. The effects of zolpidem seem to be more sedative than anxiolytic. The study shows that a combination with promethazine is suggestive, because promethazine has a selective deactivating effect. The finding that promethazine lowers the dose of thiopentone required for induction of anaesthesia is an additional interesting point. The results of this study highlight the importance of using multidimensional rating scales for the measurement of mood before anaesthesia.", 
    "112": "Epilepsy is, for many patients, a lifelong condition that requires treatment with powerful drugs whose doses must be carefully titrated to avoid both breakthrough seizures and toxicity. The medication regimens used to treat epilepsy are further complicated by the fact that most seizure medications are metabolized in the liver and have the potential for serious pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with many other medications. Successful management of epilepsy requires a high degree of cooperation among the patient, the pharmacist, and the treating physician. Such cooperation can ensure that the appropriate treatment and drug preparation are selected, compliance is maintained, and dangerous drug-drug interactions are avoided.", 
    "113": "In a four-and-a-half year period, 19 patients with focal neurological deficits accompanied by a focal electrographic status epilepticus were encountered. Sixteen of these patients showed clouding of consciousness or confusion. Computed tomography of the brain revealed focal lesions in 15 patients. In 7 patients the lesions were the result of a recent cerebral event and in 8 patients they were long-standing. All patients were treated with anti-epileptic drugs. Ten of the 12 patients without an acute lesion showed a complete recovery in a few days. In these patients the symptoms may have been caused by the continuous seizure activity, classifying them as cases of non-convulsive focal status epilepticus. Only 2 of the 7 patients with an acute lesion had a full recovery. In patients with an acute lesion the part played by the electrographic status epilepticus in the acquired deficits is unclear. Continuous or frequent intermittent focal epileptic discharges on the EEG may warrant treatment with anti-epileptic drugs in patients with focal neurological deficits, even when one of the hallmarks of epilepsy, clonic movements, is absent.", 
    "114": "The binding of the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor agonist [3H]flunitrazepam was studied in the hippocampus of rats kindled by daily stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals, using semi-quantitative autoradiography. Two kindled stages were investigated: (i) 24 h after the last generalized tonic-clonic seizure (fully kindled) and (ii) 28 days after the last generalized seizure (long-term). The binding of [3H]flunitrazepam was determined at two concentrations, 3 and 16 nM. In the CA1 area, we found a small but significant decrease (ca. 10%), both in the 3 and 16 nM [3H]flunitrazepam binding at the fully kindled stage. In contrast, there was a significant increase in the 3 nM binding (c. 15%) at the long-term stage. The 16 nM binding was not significantly different from control binding at this stage. In the granular and molecular layers of the fascia dentata, we found at both kindled stages a significantly increased 3 nM (ca. 9 and 19%, respectively) and 16 nM (ca. 19 and 14%, respectively) binding. Furthermore, we found that muscimol was still able to enhance the [3H]flunitrazepam binding in kindled animals, indicating that the GABAA receptor agonist binding site and benzodiazepine agonist binding site are still functionally coupled. The changes in [3H]flunitrazepam binding at the fully kindled stage are in agreement with the recently observed kindling-induced changes in [3H]muscimol binding in the hippocampal formation of the same animals [Titulaer M. N. G. et al. (1994) Neuroscience 59, 817-826] and extend these observations to the benzodiazepine modulatory site of the GABAA receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

These compounds therefore may be candidate endogenous benzodiazepine-receptor ligands. In light of these and other data possible correlations between phospholipid methylation and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor function are discussed."
