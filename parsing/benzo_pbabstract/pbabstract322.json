(S)-AMPA (3-600 microM) failed to produce rapid neuronal swelling, but morphological observations and monitoring of viability at 24-72 h revealed 50% cell death consistent with apoptosis. (S)-AMPA induced cell shrinkage, neurite blebbing and nuclear condensation. Cyclothiazide (50 and 100 microM), which blocks AMPA receptor desensitization potentiated excitotoxicity with 75% of neurones undergoing slow death. The AMPA-selective antagonist GYKI 52466 (10-50 microM), attenuated (S)-AMPA-mediated neurotoxicity. DNA condensation, a hallmark of apoptosis, was found by labelling neurones with the DNA binding dye 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole HCl (DAPI). Gel electrophoresis revealed DNA fragmentation, which was increased by cyclothiazide and reduced by GYKI 52466 and cycloheximide. Overstimulation of the AMPA receptor produces a novel form of neuronal death, which is apoptotic, very slow in nature, and which could contribute to various neuropathologies.",

    "3": "Drugs and their effects on olfactory learning processes in rats were tested using a modified version of the runway apparatus developed by Ades. Rats were first exposed to a conspecific urine sample and 24 h later were exposed to the same stimulus in the runway. Observations recorded the time spent investigating the urine and the number of sniffs at the site, these being considered to be indices of memory. Diazepam-treated rats (4 or 6 mg/kg) and scopolamine-treated rats (0.5 or 1 mg/kg) showed increases for both parameters. When both drugs were administered simultaneously, the impairing effect was potentiated. However, no changes in learning responses were observed in rats treated with physostigmine (0.125, 0.25, 0.5 mg/kg) or methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (0.3, 0.5, 1 mg/kg), although the administration of physostigmine or methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate was shown to antagonize the impairing effect of diazepam or scopolamine respectively. These observations support the hypothesis of interactions existing between cholinergic agents and benzodiazepine receptor ligands and of such interactions affecting olfactory acquisition processes. The runway apparatus appears to be a valid candidate model to be used for the assessment of pharmacological influences on olfactory learning in rats.", 
    "4": "In short-term chamber (GVK-250) \"descents\" by three healthy male volunteers mechanisms of hyperbaric narcosis against high partial pressures of indifferent nitrogen and argon were compared with anesthetic ketamine and sibason. Clinical biochemistry was engaged to determine any possible changes in metabolism due to the \"descents\" up to 0.4-0.6 MPa. Cubital vein blood was sampled prior to and following decompression. Plasma spectrophotometry was performed using biochemical analyzer EPAC-6140 (Eppendorf, Germany) and standard sets of reagents by Raichem (USA) and Biocon (Germany). On the whole, shifts in albumin, total protein, uric acid, lactate, and the creatine kinase activity were found to be within the physiological norm. However, several cases of excursion outside the boundaries of the clinical norm (A/T, AT, lactate dehydrogenase, triglycerides, lipase) could be associated with changes in the functional state of the liver caused by administration of the anesthetics during the hyperbaric exposure.", 
    "5": "The effects of the GABA analogues, cis- and trans-4-aminocrotonic acid (ACA) on GABA(A) receptor function and GABA uptake, together with the presence of p-1 subunit mRNA and putative GABAc receptors, were studied in primary cultures of neocortical neurons and cerebellar granule cells. Both isomers induced a Cl- influx, which was inhibited by bicuculline, t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS), picrotoxinin (PTX), and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH or lindane). [3H]-flunitrazepam binding was also increased by both isomers and this increase was inhibited by bicuculline. In neocortical neurons, the transisomer completely inhibited the [3H]GABA uptake, whereas the cis-isomer produced only a 25% inhibition at the highest concentration used. The possible presence of GABAc receptors was investigated only in neocortical cultures by using RT-PCR in order to detect the presence of the mRNA encoding the p-1 subunit which assembles to form homooligomeric Cl-channels. The results presented here show that p-1 subunits, and thus GABAc receptors, may represent a very minor population of GABA receptors in these neuronal preparations. We conclude that both GABA analogues may act as agonists at the GABA(A) receptors, although with very different potencies.",

    "11": "Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most prevalent form of epilepsy, characterized by recurrent complex partial seizures and hippocampal sclerosis. The pathophysiology underlying this disorder remains unidentified. While a loss of benzodiazepine binding sites is a key diagnostic feature of MTLE, experimental studies have shown enhanced inhibitory transmission and increased expression of GABA(A)-receptors, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms are operative in epileptic hippocampus. In the present study, changes in the expression and cellular distribution of major GABA(A)-receptor subunits were investigated in the hippocampus of pilocarpine-treated rats during the phase of spontaneous recurrent seizures. A uniform decrease in GABA(A)-receptor subunit-immunoreactivity was observed in regions of extensive neuronal death (i.e. CA1, CA3, hilus). whereas a prominent increase occurred in the dentate gyrus (DG). Most strikingly, the increase was largest for the alpha3- and alpha5-subunits, which are expressed at very low levels in the DG of control rats, suggesting the formation of novel GABA(A)-receptor subtypes in epileptic tissue. Furthermore, an extensive loss of interneurons expressing the alpha1-subunit, representing presumptive basket cells, was seen in the DG. These changes were very similar to those reported in a novel mouse model of MTLE, based on the unilateral injection of kainic acid into the dorsal hippocampus (Bouilleret et al., 1999). This indicates that the regulation of GABA(A)-receptor expression is related to chronic recurrent seizures, and is not due to the extrahippocampal neuronal damage affecting pilocarpine-treated rats. These results allow causal relationships in the induction and maintenance of chronic recurrent seizures to be distinguished. The loss of a critical number of interneurons in the DG is a possible cause of seizure initiation, whereas the long-lasting upregulation of GABA(A)-receptors in granule cells represents a compensatory response to seizure activity.", 
    "12": "Hippocampal noradrenergic and cerebellar glutamatergic granule cell axon terminals possess GABA(A) receptors mediating enhancement of noradrenaline and glutamate release, respectively. The hippocampal receptor is benzodiazepine-sensitive, whereas the cerebellar one is not affected by benzodiazepine agonists, indicating the presence of an alpha6 subunit. We tested here the effects of Zn2+ on these two native GABA(A) receptor subtypes using superfused rat hippocampal and cerebellar synaptosomes. In the cerebellum, zinc ions strongly inhibited (IC50 approximately 1 microM) the potentiation of the K(+)-evoked [3H]D-aspartate release induced by GABA. In contrast, the GABA-evoked release of [3H]noradrenaline from hippocampal synaptosomes was much less sensitive to Zn2+ (IC50 > 30 microM). The effects of Zn2+ were then studied in two rat lines selected for high (ANT) and low (AT) alcohol sensitivity because granule cell GABA(A) receptors in ANT, but not AT, rats respond to benzodiazepine agonists due to a critical mutation in the alpha6 subunit. GABA increased the K(+)-evoked release of [3H]DCNS REGIONS-aspartate from cerebellar synaptosomes of AT and ANT rats, an effect prevented by the GABAA selective antagonist bicuculline. In AT rat cerebellum, the effect of GABA was strongly inhibited by Zn2+ (IC50 < or = 1 microM), whereas in ANT rats, the divalent cation was about 100-fold less potent. Thus, native benzodiazepine-sensitive GABAA receptors appear largely insensitive to functional inhibition by Zn2+ and vice versa. Changes in sensitivity to Zn2+ inhibition consequent to mutations in cerebellar granule cell GABA(A) receptor subunits may lead to changes in glutamate release from parallel fibers onto Purkinje cells and may play important roles in cerebellar dysfunctions.", 
    "13": "Until 1987, when the first GABA-A receptor subunit cDNAs were cloned and sequenced, it was thought that there were perhaps two subtypes of receptor in the brain. These were defined by the fact that benzodiazepines, which act through the GABA-A receptor, had two binding sites with different affinities. By 1991 it was known that the GABA-A receptor family existed as a family of subunits which coassembled to form a family of receptor subtypes in the brain. More recently, two additional GABA-A receptor subunits have been identified, epsilon and theta. The identification of these new members of the gene family, and the characterisation of the receptor subtypes into which they are incorporated, is reviewed.", 
    "14": "Cerebellar granule neurons can be conveniently kept in culture. They constitute a useful model to study regulation of glutamatergic activity, in particular the inhibitory action of GABA (7-aminobutyrate). GABA exerts an inhibitory action on evoked transmitter release acting on both GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors. The functional properties of these receptors are dependent upon the environment of the neurons during early development in culture as the expression of both receptor subtypes is enhanced by exposure of the neurons to GABA(A) receptor agonists. Thus, the inducible GABA(A) receptors are of low affinity and lack benzodiazepine sensitivity, and the G-protein coupling differs among the native and the inducible GABA(B) receptors. Moreover, the GABA(A) and the GABA(B) receptors are functionally coupled, leading to a disinhibitory action of GABA. Therefore drugs exhibiting selective agonist or antagonist action on subclasses of GABA(A) and GABA(B) may be of potential use as regulators of glutamatergic excitatory activity.",

The aim of our study was to establish the mechanism of action of CCK in the rat intestine using an in vivo model and focusing on the nervous pathways involved in the response as well as type of receptors. Anesthetized rats were prepared with two strain-gauges, in duodenum and jejunum, to record circular muscle motor activity. A group of animals was also prepared with a catheter to infuse capsaicin inside the duodenum. Responses to CCK-octapeptide (CCK-8) as well as to CCK agonists were studied. CCK-8 was also infused after CCK antagonists, atropine, hexamethonium or L-nitroarginine. Results show that duodenal response to CCK-8 is excitatory although inhibitory responses can be induced by gastrin. In the jejunum, CCK-8 induces an inhibitory response that is mediated by both CCK-A and -B receptors. Excitatory responses to CCK-8 are due to stimulation of preganglionic receptors while inhibitory responses are NO mediated through stimulation of postganglionic CCK-B receptors. Capsaicin locally applied in duodenal mucosa significantly decreased CCK-8 response, whereas mucosal exposure to lidocaine completely blocked CCK-8 response. In conclusion our results show that CCK response varies along the intestine according to the predominance of excitatory or inhibitory efferent innervation. Moreover, CCK-8 actions are mediated through both extrinsic and intrinsic afferent fibres.",

A functional polymorphism in the upstream regulatory region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) has been recently reported to be associated with both unipolar and bipolar disorder. In this study, we investigated the possibility that the 5-HTTLPR might be associated with depressive symptomatology in a sample of mood disorder subjects. One hundred and thirty-two psychiatric inpatients affected by major depressive (n = 67) and bipolar (n = 65) disorder (DSM-IV) were assessed at admission by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-21, divided into Core, Sleep, Activity, Psychic anxiety, Somatic anxiety and Delusion clusters) and were typed using PCR techniques. The only prior treatment permitted was low dose benzodiazepines (<5 mg diazepam or equivalent); no prior (<2 weeks) antidepressant or neuroleptic treatment was allowed. 5-HTTLPR variants were not associated with total depressive symptomatology as measured by HAMD. The short 5-HTTLPR variant was marginally associated with higher psychic anxiety scores (F = 7.11, d.f. = 1,262, P = 0.008). The association was stronger among bipolars and early onset subjects. 5-HTTLPR variants were not associated with the remaining symptom clusters. The upstream regulatory region of the serotonin transporter gene has not, therefore, a major influence on the depressive symptomatology in mood disorder subjects.", 
    "23": "The effects of the muscarinic cholinoceptor antagonists atropine (non-selective), pirenzepine (M1-selective), methoctramine (M2-selective) and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP; M3-selective) were examined on the responsiveness of guinea pig and rat tracheal tissue to acetylcholine and carbachol. Results indicate that smooth muscle contraction in isolated tracheal tissue from both species was mediated primarily by muscarinic M3 cholinoceptors. The effects of atropine, pirenzepine and 4-DAMP were similar against the contractile actions of acetylcholine and carbachol in both species and in epithelium-intact and epithelium-denuded tissue. In contrast, differences in the effects of methoctramine in antagonising contractile responses to acetylcholine and carbachol were observed between the two species and following epithelium removal in the guinea pig. Thus, whilst this study has found that tracheal smooth muscle contraction in the guinea pig and rat is mediated primarily by muscarinic M3 cholinoceptors, anomalies in the functional inositol phosphate generation results obtained with the muscarinic cholinoceptor antagonists highlight species differences in the actions of acetylcholine and carbachol in eliciting smooth muscle contraction suggesting the possible existence of functional non-M3 muscarinic cholinoceptors.",

    "26": "In this well-validated anxiolytic screening test, Swiss mice are directly confronted with a natural threat (a rat) as well as situations associated with this threat. Primary measures taken during and after rat confrontation were flight, risk assessment (RA), defensive threat/attack and escape attempts.", 
    "27": "Diazepam significantly decreased flight reactions after the rat was introduced into the runway, reduced RA activities of mice chased by the rat, increased RA responses displayed when subjects were constrained in a straight alley and reduced defensive upright postures and biting upon forced contact. All the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonists and NAN-190 also reduced flight, RA in the chase test, and defensive threat and attack behaviours. (S)-UH-301 and pindobind-5-HT1A reduced RA in the chase test, but only partially modified defensive threat and attack. Unlike the other drugs tested, MM-77 produced significant effects only at doses which also markedly reduced spontaneous locomotor activity, suggesting a behaviourally non-specific action. In contrast to diazepam, the 5-HT1A receptor ligands failed to affect RA in the straight alley test. Following removal of the rat from the test area, only diazepam and (S)-UH-301 reduced escape behaviour (contextual defence) at doses which did not decrease locomotion. Overall, the present findings indicate that except for one RA behaviour and escape responses, the 5-HT1A receptor ligands studied modified the same defensive behaviours as diazepam, suggesting potential therapeutic efficacy in the management of anxiety disorders. However, the magnitude of the effects of the 5-HT1A compounds on defence was generally smaller than that of the benzodiazepine.",

Clozapine has been shown to be effective in about one third of this population, but carries with it medical risks and weekly blood draws.

The study involved 1066 drug addicts recruited during the month of October 1997 from 38 French health centres connected with the Centres for Evaluation and Information on Drug Addiction (CEIP). The most frequently reported drugs were benzodiazepines (n = 323), some of which, especially flunitrazepam (Rohypnol, n = 123), are extremely addictive. The data showed a slight decrease in heroin consumption as well as a marked increase in the use of maintenance treatments. The association between benzodiazepines and buprenorphine (Subutex) should consequently be studied, whether buprenorphine is being used illicitly or prescribed as a maintenance treatment.", 
    "38": "Central venous catheters have had an increasingly important role in a variety of patient care situations, including long-term antibiotic therapy, chemotherapy, and nutritional support. The recent past has seen a gradual transition from placement of vascular access catheters by surgeons to placement by interventional radiologists. The interventional radiology service places a majority of the vascular access devices at our children's hospital, including peripherally inserted central catheters, tunneled central venous catheters, temporary and permanent hemodialysis catheters, and subcutaneous ports. Most procedures performed by our interventional radiology service in children can be successfully completed with use of intravenous (i.v.) sedation, and a few require general anesthesia (GA). Key advantages of GA over i.v. sedation include the ability to have positive pressure ventilation (PPV) or controlled apnea during the procedure. We report our experience of venous air embolism in three small children during placement of tunneled central venous catheters when GA was not used.", 
    "39": "The in vivo benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor occupancy in mouse brain was measured by employing 3H-flumazenil (FMZ) in comparison with 125I-iomazenil (IMZ), in order to obtain fundamental data for PET and SPECT studies, respectively. Mice were pretreated with various doses of flunitrazepam (FNP) 40 min prior to the tracer injection. At 20 min after the tracer injection, mice were killed by decapitation and receptor occupancy in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and pons-medulla were determined by the modified method reported by Goeders and Kuhar (1985). In all regions studied, BZ receptor occupancy by FNP measured with 3H-FMZ was significantly higher than that of 125I-IMZ. For instance, 0.1 mg/kg of FNP inhibited almost 50% of the specific binding of 3H-FMZ, on the other hand almost no inhibition of 125I-IMZ with the same dose of FNP was seen. This type of discrepancy was also observed in other types of benzodiazepine agonists, nimetazepam and triazolam, or inverse agonist ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (CCE). It is of interest that in in vitro binding study using brain homogenate, almost the same competitive inhibition curve was observed between these two radioligands, which strongly suggested that discrepancy of receptor occupancy is likely observed in intact brain. The mechanism for such discrepancy is unknown, although the different kinetics properties of these two radioligand seems to be an important factor.", 
    "40": "Clinical investigations using isoform-selective probes to phenotype cytochrome P450 activity and interaction studies using isoform-selective inhibitors to determine P450 involvement in drug metabolism assume minimal interday variability in P450 activity. CYP3A4 is the most abundant human P450 isoform and metabolizes approximately half of all therapeutic agents. This investigation evaluated interday variability in hepatic CYP3A4 activity in males, using the clearances of midazolam and alfentanil as metabolic probes. Midazolam (1 mg) followed 1 hour later by alfentanil (20 micrograms/kg) were administered by intravenous bolus to 9 nonsmoking male volunteers (ages 30 +/- 8 years). Drug administration was repeated 12 and 20 days later. Venous plasma midazolam and alfentanil concentrations were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometery. Drug clearances were determined by noncompartmental and multiexponential analysis. There were no significant interday differences in plasma drug concentrations or clearances (3.9 +/- 1.4, 3.9 +/- 1.7, and 4.2 +/- 1.7 ml/kg/min for alfentanil, respectively, and 6.6 +/- 2.0, 7.9 +/- 2.4, and 7.9 +/- 2.5 ml/kg/min for midazolam, respectively, on days 1, 13, and 21 [mean +/- SD]). Interday variability in clearance was 13% +/- 6% and 19% +/- 12% for alfentanil and midazolam, respectively. Interday variability in the clearance of these probes, and presumably hepatic CYP3A4 activity, was small compared with interindividual variability. Consideration of interday variability in the hepatic metabolism of CYP3A4 substrates does not appear significant in the design of clinical trials.", 
    "41": "Diazepam is known to prolong survival in an atmosphere containing 5% oxygen, and to reduce cerebral metabolic rate and cerebral perfusion. It also depresses the arousal response to hypoxia and protects the optic nerve from anoxia. We hypothesised that diazepam might extend survival in a confined atmosphere with a limited amount of oxygen. Pigs consumed the oxygen in a sealed chamber until they reached the terminal state. The experimental pigs (n = 6) were sedated with diazepam 0.3 mg/kg i.v. and were compared with a control group (n = 5). We measured blood pressure, inspired O2 and CO2, minute ventilation, ECG, ambient and body temperatures, and PO2, PCO2, O2 content and pH in arterial and venous blood. In the diazepam-treated pigs, oxygen consumption was reduced in the hypoxic range (PIO2 below 60 torr) compared with the control pigs. Diazepam prevented the elevated hypoxic cardiac output found in the control pigs. There were almost no differences between the diazepam and control groups in the other parameters measured in the course of the exposure and in the terminal state. Terminal PIO2, PaO2, and PvO2 were 36.9 +/- 5.6, 27.9 +/- 8.6, 14.3 +/- 2.0 torr, and 36.9 +/- 5.7, 23.7 +/- 7.3, 15.7 +/- 7.6 torr in the diazepam and control groups, respectively. The survival time was 220 +/- 51 and 255 +/- 50 min in diazepam and control pigs, respectively. In spite of its anticonvulsant effect and the fact that it protects CNS white matter from anoxia, prolongs anoxic survival and eliminates the high oxygen demand in hypoxic arousal, diazepam failed to extend hypoxic survival in a confined atmosphere to a lower PIO2. However, diazepam had no deleterious effect on survival, and may therefore be used to ease stressful hypoxic conditions.", 
    "42": "Using a novel antibody directed against the alpha4 subunit of gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptors, 5% of all [3H]muscimol but only about 2% of all [3H]Ro15-4513 binding sites present in brain membrane extracts could be precipitated. This indicated that part of the alpha4 receptors containing [3H]muscimol binding sites did not contain [3H]Ro15-4513 binding sites. Immunoaffinity purification and Western blot analysis of alpha4 receptors demonstrated that not only alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, beta1, beta2, and beta3 subunits but also gamma1, gamma2, gamma3, and delta subunits can be colocalized with alpha4 subunits in native GABAA receptors. Quantification experiments, however, indicated that only 7, 33, 4, or 7% of all alpha4 receptors contained gamma1, gamma2, gamma3, or delta subunits, respectively. These data not only explain the low percentage of [3H]Ro15-4513 binding sites precipitated by the anti-alpha4 antibody but also indicate that approximately 50% of the alpha4 receptors did not contain gamma1, gamma2, gamma3, or delta subunits. These receptors, thus, either are composed of alpha4 and beta1-3 subunits only, or additionally contain epsilon, pi, or so far unidentified GABAA receptor subunits.",

Pharmacokinetic parameters were similar in both groups (clearance, 399+/-91 and 388+/-97 mL/min; steady-state volume of distribution, 85+/-22 and 104 +/-11 L in young and elderly subjects, respectively). Pharmacodynamic data showed a large difference in half-maximum concentration (EC50; young subjects, 522+/-236 ng/mL; elderly subjects, 223+/-56 ng/mL; P < .05), a steep concentration-response curve, and distinct hysteresis. We found much interindividual variability in the plasma concentrations necessary to achieve the clinical end points, regardless of age.", 
    "46": "These results suggest that the lower doses needed to reach sedation in the elderly subjects were attributable to a 50% decrease in EC50, not to changes in pharmacokinetics.", 
    "47": "The effect of muscarinic cholinoceptor antagonists was investigated on the ascending neural pathways activated by electrical stimulation in the guinea-pig ileum. For comparison, prejunctional and postjunctional effects of muscarinic cholinoceptor antagonists were also studied on circular smooth muscle. A two-compartment (oral and anal compartments) bath was used to study the ascending neural pathways. These were activated by electrical field stimulation in the anal compartment and the resulting contraction of the intestinal circular muscle in the oral compartment was recorded isotonically. Pirenzepine (10-300 nM), a muscarinic M1 cholinoceptor antagonist, reduced the ascending neural contractions in a concentration-dependent fashion when applied either to the oral or anal compartments (11-52% and 13-55% inhibition, respectively, P < 0.05). Pirenzepine inhibited (31+/-7%, P < 0.05) the acetylcholine (100 nM)-induced contractions at a higher non-selective concentration (300 nM), while its effect on the electrically-induced contractions was biphasic (10 and 30nM: 8-15% increase, P<0.05; 100 and 300 nM: 16-28% inhibition, P<0.05). The muscarinic M2 cholinoceptor antagonist methoctramine (3-100 nM) did not modify the contractions produced by 100 nM acetylcholine, electrically-induced contractions and the ascending neural contractions (when applied to either compartment). Parafluorohexahydrosiladifenidol (3-100 nM), a muscarinic M3 cholinoceptor antagonist, inhibited the contractions produced by 100 nM acetylcholine (19-81% and 15-69%), electrically-induced contractions (11-71% and 12-72%) and the ascending neural contractions (13-76% and 866%) when applied to the oral compartment, but it was without effect when applied to the anal compartment. These studies suggest that in the enteric ascending neural pathway, muscarinic M1 receptors are involved in neuroneuronal transmission, muscle contraction is mediated by muscarinic M3 cholinergic receptors, whereas muscarinic M2 receptors do not seem to participate.", 
    "48": "Recent developments of benzodiazepine receptor imaging (123I-Iomazenil SPECT and 11C-Flumazenil PET) in neuropsychiatric disorders were reviewed. In focal epilepsy, a number of previous studies have reported a decreased benzodiazepine receptor binding in epileptic foci and greater sensitivity compared to regional cerebral blood flow imaging, especially for diagnosis of medial temporal lobe epilepsy. These findings indicate clinical validity of benzodiazepine receptor imaging in focal epilepsy and may be related to the \"disinhibition mechanism\" in GABA/benzodiazepine systems underlying epilepsy. In panic disorder, abnormal benzodiazepine receptor bindings are recently demonstrated in the temporal, parietal or frontal cortex. Further studies would clarify the \"benzodiazepine dysfunction hypothesis\" in panic disorder.", 
    "49": "Cinnarizine is a calcium-entry blocker drug used in vertiginous disorders; among its most rare adverse effects appear extrapyramidal symptoms and depression, these effects can persist during weeks, months or years after the withdrawal of the drug and have been explained by the inhibition of the passage of calcium in striatal neurons and a direct antidopaminergic features because of the similar chemical structure with neuroleptic drugs. Clinical case. A case of cinnarizine-induced akathisia, parkinsonism and depression in a 25 years-old patient after 11 days of treatment is described. Sequential evaluation were done using the following instruments: Barnes' scale for akathisia, Simpson-Angus scale for extrapyramidal symptoms, Beck's depression scale, Zung's depression scale and SCID for major depression according to DSM-IV criteria. The patient was treated with benzodiazepines, propranolol and orphenadrine.",

    "51": "Cancer of the pancreas is a highly malignant disease with a very poor prognosis. Depression and anxiety occur more frequently in cancer of the pancreas than they do in other forms of intra-abdominal malignancies and other cancers in general. Yet, the etiology of psychiatric symptoms in patients with cancer of the pancreas may not be traced solely to poor prognosis, pain, or existential issues related to death and dying. In as many as half of patients that go on to be diagnosed with the disease, symptoms of depression and anxiety precede knowledge of the diagnosis. This observation has raised speculation that mood and anxiety syndromes are related to disruption in one of the physiologic functions of the pancreas. In this paper, we present a patient who had no prior psychiatric history and developed panic attacks just prior to diagnosis of her cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature where panic attacks, not simply anxiety, presented prior to a pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Her symptoms resolved following resection of the tumor. Implications of such phenomena for the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety and depression in pancreas cancer are discussed.", 
    "52": "Post-operative nausea and vomiting is distressing for patients and can cause dissatisfaction and impaired well-being in the post-operative period. This study examined the question whether the reduced incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting inevitably translates into improved clinical status and well-being. In this context high doses of droperidol were investigated. On the one hand, droperidol is known to be a powerful anti-emetic, but on the other hand there is concern about psychological effects, both in the pre- and the post-operative period. In this prospective randomized double-blinded study, droperidol (5-7.5 mg) was compared with midazolam (5-7.5 mg) used to supplement fentanyl-N2O based anaesthesia, with respect to post-operative mood and well-being using a psychological questionnaire (Bf-S-test). Furthermore, the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting was recorded. Out of 160 patients undergoing thyroidectomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy, data from 150 patients were analysed. The administration of droperidol significantly lowered the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting from 77.8% to 55.1% compared with midazolam (P = 0.0059; chi 2-test). Although post-operative nausea and vomiting is an independent risk factor for post-operative discomfort and bad mood, patients receiving droperidol showed impaired well-being 6 h after surgery. Well-being scores returned to pre-operative base-line values and did not differ between the two groups 24 and 48 h post-operatively. The reduced incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting achieved with high dose droperidol does not equate with increased post-operative well-being. It is an important point at issue to decide whether smaller doses of droperidol that are commonly used for anti-emetic therapy are free of these side effects.", 
    "53": "In our previous in vitro micronucleus (MN) study, we showed that aneugens, in addition to inducing micronuclei, induce a higher frequency of polynuclear (PN) and mitotic (M) cells than clastogens. We hypothesized that the frequency of PN and M cells induced can distinguish aneugens from clastogens. To test the hypothesis, we conducted the micronucleus tests with mitomycin C (MMC), N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), vincristine (VINC) and diazepam in a Chinese hamster cell line (CHL) and VINC, benzo[a]pyrene (BP) and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) in a subclone of V79 cells (V79-MZ). All chemicals increased the frequency of M cells with statistical significance. All chemicals except diazepam increased the frequency of PN cells with statistical significance. Three of the aneugens (VINC, BP and DMBA) induced >/=200 PN cells/1000 cells while the clastogens (MNNG and MMC) induced 100 PN cells at most. All the aneugens but no clastogens significantly increased the frequency of M cells. We propose that micronucleus test-positive chemicals that induce >/=200 PN cells/1000 cells and significantly increase the frequency of M cells are aneugens and those that induce at most 100 PN cells/1000 cells and do not significantly increase the frequency of M cells in our MN test protocol are clastogens. Diazepam, however, did not induce PN cells, although it increased the frequency of M cells dose dependently. We explain this fact in relation to diazepam's mode of action. Our proposal suggests a quick, easy and practical way to distinguish aneugens from clastogens for screening purposes.", 
    "54": "We studied the effect of oral premedication with midazolam on the recovery characteristics of sevoflurane anesthesia in small children. In a randomized, double-blinded study, 60 children (1-3 yr, ASA physical status I or II) undergoing ambulatory adenoidectomy received either midazolam 0.5 mg/kg (Group M) or placebo (Group P) PO approximately 30 min before the induction of anesthesia. All children received atropine 0.01 mg/kg IV and alfentanil 10 microg/kg IV before the induction of anesthesia with sevoflurane up to 8 vol% inspired concentration in N2O 67% in O2. Tracheal intubation was facilitated with mivacurium 0.2 mg/kg. Anesthesia was continued with sevoflurane adjusted to maintain hemodynamic stability. In the postanesthesia care unit, predetermined recovery end points (emergence, recovery, discharge) were recorded. A pain/ discomfort scale was used to determine the quality of recovery. A postoperative questionnaire was used to evaluate the well-being of the patient at home 24 h after surgery. Emergence (spontaneous eye opening), recovery (full points on the modified Aldrete scale), and discharge were achieved later in Group M than in Group P (15+/-6 vs. 11+/-3 min [P = 0.002], 25+/-17 vs. 16+/-6 min [P = 0.01], and 80+/-23 vs. 70+/-23 min [P = 0.03]). Side effects, postanesthetic excitement, and analgesic treatment did not differ significantly between groups. At home, more children in Group P (30%) experienced disturbed sleep during the night compared with those in Group M (4%) (P = 0.007).", 
    "55": "In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, premedication with midazolam 0.5 mg/kg PO delayed recovery in children 1-3 yr of age after brief (<30 min) sevoflurane anesthesia. Except for more peaceful sleep at home, premedication did not affect the quality of recovery.", 
    "56": "The relative risk of psychotropic medication use in women with puerperal psychiatric illness who are breastfeeding has yet to be quantified adequately. Although the emotional and medical benefits of breastfeeding and adverse effects of maternal depression on infant development are well described, how these absolute benefits weigh against the potential effects of psychotropic drug use during lactation to ultimately guide clinical decisions is still unclear. The objective of this report was to evaluate the extent that psychotropic medications were present in the serum of infants breastfed by mothers treated with antidepressants and benzodiazepines.",

    "61": "Seventy-four percent (n = 26) of infants had serum medication concentrations below the laboratory limit of detection (assay sensitivity 5-50 ng/mL). In the remaining 26% of the sample (n = 9), serum concentrations of psychotropic medications and/or active metabolites were detected. In each of these cases, infants had been exposed to the medication during pregnancy. Medications were not detected in infant serum when mothers had taken these agents solely during the postpartum period. No readily apparent difficulties with the infants were reported by mothers.", 
    "62": "These data support the low incidence of infant toxicity and adverse effects associated with antidepressant and benzodiazepine use during breastfeeding. These data also suggest that infant serum monitoring is helpful in the assessment of medication exposure in children of mothers who breastfeed while using psychotropic medications. Given the limited accumulated data regarding serum concentrations of psychotropic medications in breastfeeding infants, no single agent seems to be safer than another. Therefore, choice of pharmacologic treatment should be guided by the likelihood that it will result in restoration of maternal psychiatric well-being.", 
    "63": "Previous studies evaluating the respiratory effects of sedation regimens have focused on events such as a decline in O2 saturation or apnea.

    "65": "During the procedure, O2 saturation decreased by 3% or more in three patients. Supplemental oxygen at 2 liters per minute was administered to these patients. The lowest oxygen saturation was 84%. During the total of 767 minutes of monitoring, there were 3068 ETCO2 values recorded. The high ETCO2 values ranged from 37 to 53 mmHg (40.5 +/- 3.3 mmHg). Ninety percent, or 2760, of the values were 40 mmHg or less, 7% or 214 were between 41 and 45 mmHg, 3% or 92 were between 46 and 49 mmHg, and 2 isolated values were greater than 50 mmHg. One episode of airway obstruction was identified by noting cessation of the ETCO2 waveform. This was relieved by repositioning the patient's airway. The three episodes of O2 desaturation, two ETCO2 values greater than 50 mmHg, and the episode of upper airway obstruction all occurred in three patients. Two of these patients had trisomy 21 with macroglossia, and the third had had a recent upper respiratory infection and a history of tonsillar hypertrophy.", 
    "66": "The incidence of adverse cardiorespiratory events associated with the current sedation regimen of midazolam-ketamine is lower than that reported with other commonly used regimens.

Opioids were also used in 84% of patients. Twenty-six percent of children with normal lungs, most of whom had received relatively high opioid doses, developed decreased oxygen saturation (as low as 65%) after sedation. Other adverse events included airway obstruction (n = 3) and vomiting (n = 1).", 
    "70": "The frequent choice of midazolam, usually combined with an opioid, indicates its wide acceptance. Midazolam doses were inversely related to age.

The causes varied from benign such as postviral acute cerebellar ataxia and benign paroxysmal vertigo to potentially life-threatening such as intoxication with benzodiazepines and medulloblastoma. Treatment led to complete or partial recovery. (Sub)acute balance disorders in previously healthy children can be due to cerebellar ataxia, vestibular disorders and abnormal proprioception. Ancillary investigations are warranted in case of gradually developing ataxia, accompanying neurological deficits, suspicion of intoxication, recurrent or familial ataxia, no spontaneous remission or even progression. In children with an isolated cerebellar ataxia without these features, ancillary investigations may be avoided, although in such cases careful follow-up remains necessary.",

    "74": "Coexistence of hippocampal sclerosis and a potentially epileptogenic cortical lesion is referred to as dual pathology and can be responsible for poor surgical outcome in patients with medically intractable partial epilepsy. [11C]Flumazenil (FMZ) positron emission tomography (PET) is a sensitive method for visualizing epileptogenic foci. In this study of 12 patients with dual pathology, we addressed the sensitivity of FMZ PET to detect hippocampal abnormalities and compared magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with visual as well as quantitative FMZ PET findings.", 
    "75": "All patients underwent volumetric MRI, prolonged video-EEG monitoring, and glucose metabolism PET before the FMZ PET. MRI-coregistered partial volume-corrected PET images were used to measure FMZ-binding asymmetries by using asymmetry indices (AIs) in the whole hippocampus and in three (anterior, middle, and posterior) hippocampal subregions. Cortical sites of decreased FMZ binding also were evaluated by using AIs for regions with MRI-verified cortical lesions as well as for non-lesional areas with visually detected asymmetry.", 
    "76": "Abnormally decreased FMZ binding could be detected by quantitative analysis in the atrophic hippocampus of all 12 patients, including three patients with discordant or inconclusive EEG findings. Decreased FMZ binding was restricted to only one subregion of the hippocampus in three patients. Areas of decreased cortical FMZ binding were obvious visually in all patients. Decreased FMZ binding was detected visually in nonlesional cortical areas in four patients. The AIs for these nonlesional regions with visual asymmetry were significantly lower than those for regions showing MRI lesions (paired t test, p = 0.0075).", 
    "77": "Visual as well as quantitative analyses of FMZ-binding asymmetry are sensitive methods to detect decreased benzodiazepine-receptor binding in the hippocampus and neocortex of patients with dual pathology. MRI-defined hippocampal atrophy is always associated with decreased FMZ binding, although the latter may be localized to only one sub-region within the hippocampus. FMZ PET abnormalities can occur in areas with normal appearance on MRI, but FMZ-binding asymmetry of these regions is lower when compared with that of lesional areas. FMZ PET can be especially helpful when MRI and EEG findings of patients with intractable epilepsy are discordant.",

Neuronal count and karyometry did not revealed significant differences between controls and experimental rats. Only the group of old rats showed a slight increase in the number of dark neurons, with a decrease in the karyometric index.", 
    "79": "Repeated administration of amphetamine or methamphetamine (MA) results in an augmentation of its locomotor-activating effects, which is a phenomenon known as behavioral sensitization. In humans, chronic use of the drug elicits a progressive augmentation in paranoid symptoms that closely resemble schizophrenia. Behavioral sensitization has some common properties with other forms of neural plasticity such as kindling, learning and long-term potentiation (LTP). The author examined in the present study whether behavioral sensitization could be blocked by GABA-benzodiazepine agonists, known to inhibit kindling, learning as well as LTP. Rats (Male Wistar-King rats) treated with MA (1 mg/kg, s.c.) for 10 days displayed significantly enhanced motor activity when tested with MA (1 mg/kg) after a 7-8 day withdrawal period indicating the acquisition of behavioral sensitization. Treatment with clonazepam (CZP) (0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg), a GABA-benzodiazepine agonist, prior to MA administration prevented the acquisition of sensitization. In contrast, treatment with flumazenil (Flu) (10 mg/kg), a GABA-benzodiazepine antagonist, prior to MA administration did not affect the acquisition of sensitization. And treatment with Flu prior to CZP administration suppressed the inhibitory effect of CZP. CZP had no effect on the expression of sensitization in the sensitized rats, when given prior to the MA readministration. These results suggest that stimulation of GABA-benzodiazepine receptors plays a role in the acquisition but not in the expression of behavioral sensitization.", 
    "80": "Pharmacological study of rat thalamic gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptors revealed the presence of two distinct populations, namely, diazepam-sensitive and diazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro15-4513 binding sites accounting for 94 +/- 2% (1339 +/- 253 fmol/mg protein) and 6 +/- 2% (90 +/- 44 fmol/mg protein) of total sites, respectively. Thalamic diazepam-insensitive sites exhibited a pharmacology that was distinct from diazepam-sensitive sites but comparable to that of the alpha4beta3gamma2 subtype of the GABAA receptor stably expressed in L(tk-) cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments with a specific anti-alpha4-antiserum immunoprecipitated 20 and 7% of total thalamic [3H]muscimol and [3H]Ro15-4513 sites, respectively. Combinatorial immunoprecipitation using antisera against the alpha4, gamma2, and delta subunit revealed that alpha4delta- and alpha4gamma2-containing receptors account for 13 +/- 2 and 8 +/- 3% of [3H]muscimol sites from thalamus, respectively. It also indicated that all delta subunits coexist with an alpha4 subunit in this brain region. In conclusion, our results show that in rat thalamus both alpha4betagamma2 and alpha4betadelta subtypes are expressed but alpha4betadelta is the major alpha4-containing GABAA receptor population.", 
    "81": "1. Gastrin stimulates rat stomach ECL cells to secrete histamine and pacreastatin, a chromogranin A (CGA)-derived peptide. The present report describes the effect of nine cholecystokinin2 (CCK2) receptor antagonists and one CCK1 receptor antagonist on the gastrin-evoked secretion of pancreastatin from isolated ECL cells. 2. The CCK2 receptor antagonists comprised three benzodiazepine derivatives L-740,093, YM022 and YF476, one ureidoacetamide compound RP73870, one benzimidazole compound JB 93182, one ureidoindoline compound AG041R and three tryptophan dipeptoids PD 134308 (CI988), PD135158 and PD 136450. The CCK1 receptor antagonist was devazepide. 3. A preparation of well-functioning ECL cells (approximately 80% purity) was prepared from rat oxyntic mucosa using counter-flow elutriation. The cells were cultured for 48 h in the presence of 0.1 nM gastrin; they were then washed and incubated with antagonist alone or with various concentrations of antagonist plus 10 nM gastrin (a maximally effective concentration) for 30 min. Gastrin dose-response curves were constructed in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of antagonist. The amount of pancreastatin secreted was determined by radioimmunoassay. 4. The gastrin-evoked secretion of pancreastatin was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. YM022, AG041R and YF476 had IC50 values of 0.5, 2.2 and 2.7 nM respectively. L-740,093, JB93182 and RP73870 had IC50 values of 7.8, 9.3 and 9.8 nM, while PD135158, PD136450 and PD134308 had IC50 values of 76, 135 and 145 nM. The CCK1 receptor antagonist devazepide was a poor CCK2 receptor antagonist with an IC50 of about 800 nM. 5. YM022, YF476 and AG041R were chosen for further analysis. YM022 and YF476 shifted the gastrin dose-response curve to the right in a manner suggesting competitive antagonism, while the effects of AG041R could not be explained by simple competitive antagonism. pK(B) values were 11.3 for YM022, 10.8 for YF476 and the apparent pK(B) for AG041R was 10.4.", 
    "82": "The effect of saiboku-to on gastric lesions induced by restraint water-immersion stress and ethanol has been examined in rats. Thirty minutes after oral administration of saiboku-to, the rats were placed in restraint cages and immersed in water at 23 degrees C for 7 h, or orally administered 99.5% ethanol (1 mL) and placed in normal cages for 1 h. The stress for 7 h or the ethanol treatment for 1h induced erosion in the glandular area of the stomach. Histology showed that the surface epithelial cells were desquamated and part of the lamina propria mucosae was injured. The evaluation of lesion index, the cumulative length of the gastric lesion, on the gross appearance of the stomach, revealed that saiboku-to dose-dependently inhibited both the water-immersion stress-induced gastric erosion and ethanol-induced gastric erosion. To determine whether the anti-erosion effect of saiboku-to was because of a mild irritant effect, saiboku-to or 20% ethanol, which is known as a typical mild irritant, were given orally. After 30 min a strong irritant, 99.5% ethanol, was given orally. Histological examination was performed 30 min after administration of saiboku-to or the mild irritant, and 1 h after administration of the strong irritant. The mild irritant induced a reduction in surface epithelial cells 30 min after administration. Furthermore, the mild irritant protected the stomach against mucosal erosion produced by the strong irritant. Saiboku-to protected the strong irritant-induced erosion without producing mild irritation as observed in stomach treated with 20% ethanol. Pretreatment with saiboku-to also inhibited the decrease in the levels of hexosamine, gastric mucus glycoprotein, induced by the strong irritant. In pylorus-ligated rats, saiboku-to dose-dependently inhibited gastric acid secretion, a gastric aggressive factor. These results suggest that the anti-erosion effect of saiboku-to which is not a mild irritant, involves both inhibition of aggressive factors, such as gastric acid secretion, and augmentation of defensive factors, such as gastric mucus cells.", 
    "83": "The metabolic clearance of midazolam, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A substrate, by the liver under normal and increased enzyme activity in rats was determined in-vivo and in-vitro to elucidate the reproducibility of the in-vivo hepatic extraction ratio of midazolam from the in-vitro study. The hepatic enzyme activity was modified by pretreating rats with a CYP inducer such as dexamethasone and clotrimazole. The in-vivo hepatic extraction ratio (ERh,obs) of midazolam under a steady-state plasma concentration (approx. 3 nmolmL(-1)) in untreated (control) rats was 0.864. This value increased to 0.984 in dexamethasone-pretreated rats and to 0.964 in clotrimazole-pretreated rats. The in-vitro hepatic intrinsic clearance (CL(int,in-vitro)), expressed as mLmin(-1) (mg microsomal protein)(-1), of midazolam was estimated as Vmax (Km)(-1) by in-vitro metabolism studies using liver microsomes. The CL(int,in-vitro) value was converted to the CL(int,cal) value, expressed as mLmin(-1)kg(-1), by considering the microsomal protein content (g liver)(-1) and the microsomal protein content (g liver)(-1)kg(-1). The estimated CL(int,cal) value was then converted to the ERh value (ER(h,cal)) according to the well-stirred, the parallel-tube and the dispersion models. The ERh(h,cal) values obtained by the parallel-tube model were in good agreement with corresponding in-vivo ERh(h,obs) values. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that high hepatic clearances of midazolam under normal and increased CYP3A activity were reasonably predicted from in-vitro metabolism studies using liver microsomes.", 
    "84": "To furnish a systemic effect after intranasal administration, a formulation must contain the therapeutic dose in no more than 150 L, the maximum volume that can be applied as a single administration in one nostril in man. The objectives of these studies were to examine the local toxicity of formulations containing benzodiazepines and to document the effects to support clinical trials in man. After stability, pharmacological and pharmacokinetic studies of several benzodiazepine formulations, we studied nasal toxicity after single and repeated administration to rabbits of poly(ethylene glycol) 200, tetra(ethylene glycol), glycofurolum and mixtures of these vehicles both with and without benzodiazepines. Single-dose studies with examinations 5 or 10min after application were undertaken with poly(ethylene glycol), tetra(ethylene glycol), glycofurolum and tetra(ethylene glycol)-glycofurolum in the ratio 95:5; the reactions were similar to that after physiological saline. A 14-day repeated-dose study was conducted with diazepam, lorazepam and flunitrazepam formulations in poly(ethylene glycol), and flunitrazepam in poly(ethylene glycol)-glycofurolum in the ratio 70:30; the two vehicles without any benzodiazepine were also examined. Microscopic study revealed mild changes only in the treated groups. A final four-week study was conducted with repeated administration of clonazepam formulated in tetra(ethylene glycol)-glycofurolum in the ratio 95:5; microscopy revealed mild changes after three 150-microL doses daily, but no abnormalities after one or three 100-microL doses daily. It was concluded that these three solvents individually or as mixtures resulted in only mild local toxicity and might be acceptable as vehicles in nasal preparations of benzodiazepines and other non-irritating drugs for short-term use in man.", 
    "85": "Although oxazepam (Serax), a widely used benzodiazepine anxiolytic, does not induce gene mutations in vitro or chromosomal aberrations in vivo, it was found to be a hepatocarcinogen in a 2 year bioassay in B6C3F1 mice. Thus, it was of interest to determine whether this carcinogen is mutagenic in vivo. Male B6C3F1 Big Blue transgenic mice were fed 2500 p.p.m. oxazepam or control diet alone for 180 days and killed on the next day. The mutant frequency (MF) of lacI in control mice was 5.02 +/- 2.4x10(5), whereas the MF in the oxazepam-treated mice was 9.17 +/- 4.82x10(-5), a significant increase (P < 0.05). Correction of the mutant frequency of lacI from the oxazepam-treated mice for clonality resulted in a decrease in the mean mutant frequency to 8.15 +/- 2. 54x10(-5). Although the mutant frequency difference was small, sequencing of a random collection of the mutants from each oxazepam-exposed mouse showed a significant difference (P < 0.015) in the mutation spectrum compared with that from control mice. In the oxazepam-exposed mice, an increase in G:C-->T:A and G:C-->C:G transversions and a concomitant decrease in G:C-->A:T transitions were observed. Clonal expansion of mutations at guanines in 5'-CpG-3' sequencing contexts at three sites was noted. It is postulated that some of the mutations found in the oxazepam-derived spectrum were due to oxidative damage elicited by induction of CYP2B isozymes as the result of chronic oxazepam administration. This study demonstrates that the in vivo Big Blue transgenic rodent mutation assay can detect mutations derived from a carcinogen that did not induce gene mutations in vitro or micronuclei in mouse bone marrow. Moreover, the sequencing of the recovered mutants can distinguish between the mutation spectrum from treated mice compared with that from control mice, thereby confirming the genotoxic consequences.", 
    "86": "Olanzapine acutely induced disabling hypofrontal symptoms in a 31-year-old male. This occurred after 13 years of exposure to typical neuroleptics without such symptoms. Presumably, hypofrontal symptoms should limit the dose of atypical neuroleptics in some patients. Milder expressions of hypofrontal symptoms should be more common.", 
    "87": "The program Catalyst was used to build three-dimensional quantitative structure activity relationship (3D-QSAR) pharmacophore models of the structural features common to competitive-type inhibitors of cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A4. These were compared with 3D- and four-dimensional (4D)-QSAR partial least-squares (PLS) models built using molecular surface-weighted holistic invariant molecular (MS-WHIM) descriptors for size and shape of the inhibitor. The Catalyst pharmacophore model generated from multiple conformers of competitive inhibitors of CYP3A4-mediated midazolam 1'-hydroxylation (n = 14) yielded a high correlation of observed and predicted Ki values of r = 0.91. Similarly, PLS MS-WHIM was used to produce 3D- and 4D-QSARs for this data set and produced models that were statistically predictable after cross-validation. Two additional Catalyst pharmacophores were constructed from literature Ki values (n = 32) derived from the inhibition of CYP3A-mediated cyclosporin A metabolism and IC50 data (n = 22) from the inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated quinine 3-hydroxylation. These Catalyst pharmacophores illustrated correlations of observed and predicted inhibition for CYP3A4 of r = 0.77 and 0.92, respectively. The corresponding 4D-QSARs generated by PLS MS-WHIM for these data sets were of comparable quality as judged by cross-validation. Both Ki pharmacophores generated with Catalyst were also validated by predicting the Ki(apparent) values of a test set of eight CYP3A4 inhibitors not included in either model. In seven of eight cases, the residuals of the predicted Ki(apparent) values were within 1 log unit of the observed values. The 3D- and 4D-QSAR models produced in this study suggest the utility of future in silico prediction of CYP3A4-mediated drug-drug interactions.", 
    "88": "In this study, we have investigated the ability of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) to inhibit HIV long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven gene expression. Using COS 7 cells cotransfected with tat and an HIV LTR linked to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter, we observed that physiological levels of IGF-I (10(-9) M) significantly inhibited CAT expression in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. IGF-I did not inhibit CAT expression in COS 7 cells transfected with pSVCAT, and did not affect CAT expression in the absence of cotransfection with tat. Transfection of HIV-1 proviral DNA into COS 7 cells +/- IGF-I resulted in a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in infectious virion production. Both IGF-I and Ro24-7429 inhibited LTR-driven CAT expression, while TNF-alpha-enhanced CAT expression was not affected by IGF-I. On the other hand, a plasmid encoding parathyroid hormone-related peptide exhibited dramatic additivity of inhibition of CAT expression in COS 7 cells. Finally, we show that in Jurkat or U937 cells cotransfected with HIVLTRCAT/tat, IGF-I significantly inhibited CAT expression. Further, interleukin 4 showed in U937 cells inhibition of CAT expression that was not additive to IGF-I induced inhibition. Our data demonstrate that IGF-I can specifically inhibit HIVLTRCAT expression. This inhibition may occur at the level of the tat/TAR interaction. Finally, this IGF-I effect is seen in target cell lines and similar paths of inhibition may be involved in the various cell types employed.", 
    "89": "Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were made from superficial dorsal horn neurons in thin slices of neonatal rat spinal cord. Spontaneously occurring glutaminergic miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were recorded in the presence of tetrodotoxin, strychnine and bicuculline. Bath-application of midazolam (5-60 microM) reduced the frequency of mEPSCs dose-dependently and this depression was antagonized by flumazenil 15 microM. In 8 neurons studied, midazolam 15 microM affected neither the amplitude profiles nor the mean amplitudes of the mEPSCs, suggesting a presynaptic site of action. In a nominally Ca(2+)-free solution, midazolam still reduced the frequency of mEPSCs, but to a lesser extent than in a standard solution. We conclude that midazolam may presynaptically inhibit excitatory synaptic transmission in the superficial dorsal horn by affecting both Ca2+ entry into the nerve terminals and transmitter release mechanisms downstream to Ca2+ entry.", 
    "90": "Management of epilepsy in the elderly involves many challenges, including the presence of concomitant diseases, polypharmacy and changes in body physiology. Age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have to be taken into account in order to avoid potentially severe adverse drug reactions in elderly people. The present study reviews the most commonly used antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in the elderly. Because some AEDs may induce the metabolism of other agents and reduce the effectiveness of several drugs, the physicians have to carefully evaluate concomitant drugs being administered. Moreover, the main problems appear to be when beginning therapy, the first choice drug, the appropriate dosage and pharmacologic compliance. Elderly patients must be screened for hepatic and renal functions before beginning a treatment with an AED, carefully interviewed to reduce complaints for drug side-effects which may negatively influence compliance and monitored for total and free blood levels. Besides the 'classic' AEDs, such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, valproic acid, primidone and benzodiazepines, the review shows the possible advantages of new AEDs, such as felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine and gamma-vinyl-GABA, which may be used in the elderly too for their good tolerability. A careful control of drug assumption is requested in the elderly, especially when it is difficult to achieve seizure control.", 
    "91": "In many countries, prescription data are used as an instrument to provide feedback on prescribing. This article describes the development and implementation of a computer program as a tool for pharmacotherapy audit meetings and it illustrates the possibilities of such a program. The program was developed to support the optimisation of prescribing in the various stages of behavioural change. It enables pharmacists to make sophisticated overviews of prescribing by physicians in their audit group and furthermore, pharmacists can conduct drug utilisation studies or pharmaco-epidemiological studies in their own patient population. Forty percent of Dutch pharmacies have purchased the computer program since its introduction; it was distributed together with a technical handbook and a course book, which elaborated on the types of graphs available and their interpretation. An educational course was developed regarding the optimal selection and interpretation of graphs. Examples of prescription data as a tool to support various aims of audit meetings are given. The program is acknowledged as a welcome contribution to pharmacotherapy audit and to the pharmacists' advisory role in pharmacotherapy.", 
    "92": "Psychoactive medication is frequently used in methadone maintenance treatment programs (MMP) to treat comorbid mental disorders (depression, anxiety, schizophrenia) in opiate-addicts. Thus, several pharmacological interactions are possible. This problem becomes more relevant with the introduction of new CNS-drugs like SSRI, atypical antipsychotics or new anticonvulsants. The most common interactions seen in practice are pharmacodynamic in nature, most often due to the cumulative effects of different drugs on the central nervous system (e.g. neuroleptics or benzodiazepine interactions). However important pharmacokinetic interactions may occur particularly between methadone and antidepressant drugs: Desipramine plasma levels are increased by methadone; further fluvoxamine (and fluoxetine to a less extent) may cause an important increase in serum methadone concentrations. The inhibition of different clusters of the cytochrome P450 system are involved in these interactions. Several lines of evidence suggest that benzodiazepines and methadone may have synergistic interactions and that opiate sedation or respiratory depression could be increased. This is a serious problem, given the widespread use of benzodiazepines among MMP patients. Experimental but not clinical data support methadone and lithium interactions. Finally, classic anticonvulsant drugs, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital, produce dramatic decreases in methadone levels, which may precipitate a withdrawal syndrome; valproic acid and the new anticonvulsant drugs do not have these effects. Accordingly, caution is advised in the clinical use of methadone when other CNS-drugs are administered.",

    "94": "During the first six months of 1997, 232 admissions into the Infectious Disease Unit at Ram\u00f3n y Cajal Hospital (191 patients) were systematically evaluated by the nursery staff. A specific questionnaire was designed for this interview. After having performed univariants analysis, a logistic regression was used to identify the most relevant variables in the claim for consultation liaison.", 
    "95": "The claim for consultation liaison was associated to: consume in the unit OR (yes/no)= 7.9, confusional syndrome OR (yes/no)= 5.6, social worker consultation liaison OR (yes/no)= 2.1. use of benzodiazepines OR (yes/no)= 2.4. No medical treatment respect to bad accomplishment OR= 3.6. Only taking into account the known features after the first examination: use of benzodiazepines OR (yes/no)= 2.1, use of cocaine OR (yes/no)= 1.8, recognized income (yes/no)= 2.2, no medical treatment due to bad accomplishment OR= 2.1.", 
    "96": "In our environment the demand for consultation liaison psychiatry is related to behavioural problems due to the use of substances and marginality. The variables which predict the demand and may be identified at the time of admission are: the use of benzodiazepines, cocaine, the lack of a recognized income and the absence of medical treatment for the HIV infection. Recognizing these features will allow us to identify patients who are going to have behavioural problems and demand psychiatric assistance.",

    "99": "Mice were observed for the number of head-dips they made into the holes of the hole-board apparatus during a 5-min period, starting 30 min after acute (20 mg/kg) and repeated oral dose (20 mg/kg, twice a day for 4 days) administration of caffeine and pentoxifylline. In separate experiments, the response to an acute challenge with graded doses of diazepam (0.375 3 mg/kg, SC) was observed in naive mice or mice on acute and repeated dose regimen with methyl xanthines.", 
    "100": "Mice on acute but not after repeated dose regimen demonstrated a significantly increased number of hole-dips, indicating an anxiolytic-like effect of methylxanthines. Diazepam at the lower doses (0.375 and 0.75 mg/kg) but not at the highest doses (1.5 and 3 mg/kg) examined produced a significant anxiolytic-like effect. After an acute dose exposure of mice to caffeine and pentoxifylline, a rightward shift in the dose-response curve of diazepam was observed and particularly at 1.5 mg/kg dose, the net effect of diazepam was significantly enhanced which was, however, impaired upon repeated administration, more so with caffeine than with pentoxifylline.", 
    "101": "It is concluded that the xanthine drugs exert anxiolytic-like activity similar to diazepam in the hole-board test. In addition, they seem to modulate the anxiolytic effects of diazepam after both acute and repeated administration, probably as a result of an endogenous adenosinergic mechanism which may have therapeutic significance.", 
    "102": "The imidazopyridine hypnotic zolpidem may produce less memory and cognitive impairment than classic benzodiazepines, due to its relatively low binding affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor subtypes found in areas of the brain which are involved in learning and memory.", 
    "103": "The study was designed to compare the acute effects of single oral doses of zolpidem (5, 10, 20 mg/70 kg) and the benzodiazepine hypnotic triazolam (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/70 kg) on specific memory and attentional processes.", 
    "104": "Drug effects on memory for target (i.e., focal) information and contextual information (i.e., peripheral details surrounding a target stimulus presentation) were evaluated using a source monitoring paradigm, and drug effects on selective attention mechanisms were evaluated using a negative priming paradigm, in 18 healthy volunteers in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design.", 
    "105": "Triazolam and zolpidem produced strikingly similar dose-related effects on memory for target information. Both triazolam and zolpidem impaired subjects' ability to remember whether a word stimulus had been presented to them on the computer screen or whether they had been asked to generate the stimulus based on an antonym cue (memory for the origin of a stimulus, which is one type of contextual information). The results suggested that triazolam, but not zolpidem, impaired memory for the screen location of picture stimuli (spatial contextual information). Although both triazolam and zolpidem increased overall reaction time in the negative priming task, only triazolam increased the magnitude of negative priming relative to placebo.",

    "107": "1. The benzodiazepines are among the most frequently prescribed of all drugs and have been used for their anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and sedative/hypnotic properties. Since absorption rates, volumes of distribution, and elimination rates differ greatly among the benzodiazepine derivatives, each benzodiazepine has a unique plasma concentration curve. Although the time to peak plasma levels provides a rough guide, it is not equivalent to the time to clinical onset of effect. The importance of alpha and beta half-lives in the actions of benzodiazepines is discussed. 2. The role of cytochrome P450 isozymes in the metabolism of benzodiazepines and in potential pharmacokinetic interactions between the benzodiazepines and other coadministered drugs is discussed. 3. Buspirone, an anxiolytic with minimal sedative effects, undergoes extensive metabolism, with hydroxylation and dealkylation being the major pathways. Pharmacokinetic interactions of buspirone with other coadministered drugs seem to be minimal. 4. Zopiclone and zolpidem are used primarily as hypnotics. Both are extensively metabolized; N-demethylation, N-oxidation, and decarboxylation of zopiclone occur, and zolpidem undergoes oxidation of methyl groups and hydroxylation of a position on the imidazolepyridine ring system. Zopiclone has a chiral centre, and demonstrates stereoselective pharmacokinetics. Metabolic drug-drug interactions have been reported with zopiclone and erythromycin, trimipramine, and carbamazepine. Reports to date indicate minimal interactions of zolpidem with coadministered drugs; however, it has been reported to affect the Cmax and clearance of chlorpromazepine and to decrease metabolism of the antiviral agent ritonavin. Since CYP3A4 has been reported to play an important role in metabolism of zolpidem, possible interactions with drugs which are substrates and/or inhibitors of that CYP isozyme should be considered.",

The cardiovascular status of the patients needs special attention, since the long-term prognosis is predominantly influenced by concomitant coronary artery disease. General anesthesia techniques are raising the challenge of maintaining cardiovascular stability and establishing adequate cerebral monitoring. Randomly selected 30 patients gave informed consent to this approved study. Fifteen patients were anaesthetised with propofol-fentanyl or midazolam-fentanyl combined with N2O-O2.

All children presenting with seizures to a children's A & E department over a period of 9 months were studied prospectively. Respiratory depression was defined as a fall in respiratory rate or oxygen saturation, or apnoea resulting in ventilation or resuscitation with bag-and-mask oxygen. There were 130 patient episodes involving 97 children who received treatment for their seizures before admission and/or in the A & E department. Administration of diazepam resulted in 122 patient episodes. The route of administration was rectal in 91 episodes, intravenous in 12 episodes, and both rectal and intravenous in 19 episodes. Eleven children had respiratory depression in relation to diazepam administration. Eight of these children required ventilation. The overall incidence of respiratory depression following the use of diazepam was 9%. The incidence of respiratory depression following diazepam given intravenously or rectally is high. The use of diazepam as first-line therapy for children with acute seizures needs to be reviewed.",

Smaller numbers of samples were positive for other drugs:- opiates (11), benzodiazepines (4), cocaine (3) and one each for amphetamines and methadone. Polydrug use was detected in nine individuals. Only two samples tested positive for ethanol. The proportion with a urine cotinine level indicative of active smoking was 34.3%. The outcome of the pregnancy was traced for 288 subjects. Cannabis use was associated with a lower gestational age at delivery (P < 0.005), an increased risk of prematurity (P < 0.02) and reduction in birth weight (P < 0.002). Whilst maternal smoking was associated with a reduction in infant birth weight (P < 0.05), this was less pronounced than the effect of other substance misuse.",

There was no other apparent cause for his symptoms, which resolved within 24 hours after the diazepam was discontinued. This case suggests that short-term use of diazepam can lead to a brief fugue-like state with retrograde amnesia that has not been reported previously.",

    "132": "The effect of diabetes on the effect of diazepam on the propofol-induced loss of the righting reflex was investigated. There was no significant difference in the duration of the propofol-induced loss of the righting reflex between non-diabetic and diabetic mice. Diazepam increased the duration of the propofol-induced loss of the righting reflex in both diabetic and non-diabetic mice. The diazepam-induced enhancement of the effect of propofol was significantly lower in diabetic mice than that in non-diabetic mice. These effects were antagonized by the pretreatment with flumazenil. Pretreatment with FG7142, a benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist, attenuated the duration of the propofol-induced loss of the righting reflex in non-diabetic mice, but not in diabetic mice. These results suggest that the attenuation of the diazepam-induced enhancement of the duration of the propofol-induced loss of the righting reflex in diabetic mice may be due to the dysfunction of benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "133": "In this study, we have analyzed the role of cyclic AMP (cAMP) as the mediator of the decrease in action potential duration induced by diazepam. Diazepam (1-100 microM) reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, the duration of intracellular action potential recorded in the papillary muscle obtained from the right ventricle of the guinea pig heart. This effect was mimicked by the analog of cyclic AMP, 8-Br-cAMP (100 microM), but not by gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA). Also, the selective antagonist of the benzodiazepine receptors, flumazenil did not modify the effect of diazepam. The diazepam-induced shortening of action potential duration was partially antagonized by the inhibitor of cAMP synthesis carbachol (1 microM) or the blocker of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, Rp-cAMP[S] (1 microM). These results indicate that cyclic AMP is involved in the diazepam-induced shortening of the action potential duration of the guinea pig papillary muscle.", 
    "134": "Neuroleptic-induced akathisia should be definitely diagnosed as acute, tardive, withdrawal, and chronic. The diagnostic assessment must be identified from the subjective report and objective features. Various assessments of measuring akathisia can be clinically used by instrumental methods and rating scales. The pharmacological basis of neuroleptic-induced akathisia is the inhibition of the dopamine receptors in the brain. The pathogenesis of neuroleptic-induced akathisia may involve GABAergic hypoactivity, noradrenergic hyperactivity, and serotonergic dysfunction in CNS. Iron deficiency and hyperglycemia may be risk factors of neuroleptic induced akathisia in relation to the dopamine function in the brain. Neurological disorders may be associated with the development of a syndrome resembling drug-induced akathisia. The lesion of the thalamic nuclei would originally produce the syndrome. The difference between acute and tardive akathisia on the strategy of the drug treatment should be sufficiently comprehended. In particular, the long-term use of anticholinergic drugs and benzodiazepines should not be prevailed.", 
    "135": "1. The whole-cell patch clamp technique was used to study the role of muscarinic receptors in regulating the frequency of giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs) in CA3 hippocampal neurones in slices from postnatal (P) P1-P8 rats. 2. Atropine (1 microM) reduced the frequency of GDPs by 64.2 +/- 2.9 %. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor edrophonium (20 microM) increased the frequency of GDPs in a developmentally regulated way. This effect was antagonized by the M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine. 3. In the presence of edrophonium, tetanic stimulation of cholinergic fibres induced either an enhancement of GDP frequency (179 +/- 79 %) or a membrane depolarization (27 +/- 16 mV) associated with an increase in synaptic noise. These effects were prevented by atropine. 4. Application of carbachol (3 microM) produced an increase in GDP frequency that at P5-P6 was associated with a membrane depolarization and an increase in synaptic noise. These effects were prevented by atropine, pirenzepine (3 microM) and bicuculline (10 microM). 5. In the presence of pirenzepine, carbachol reduced GDP frequency by 50 +/- 4 %. Conversely, in the presence of methoctramine (3 microM), carbachol enhanced GDP frequency by 117 +/- 4 %. 6. It is concluded that endogenous acetylcholine, through the activation of M1 receptors, enhances the release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), in a developmentally regulated way. On the other hand, carbachol exerts both an up- and downregulation of GABA release through the activation of M1 and M2 receptors, respectively.", 
    "136": "Cardiac arrhythmia can be a serious complication during general anaesthesia of patients suffering from cardiac arrhythmias and using antiarrhythmic drugs. The aim of the present experiments was to establish the way in which lidocaine and verapamil influence haemodynamic parameters of rabbits after midazolam anaesthesia. The experiments were performed on rabbits. Heart rate was counted according to ECG. Blood pressure was measured directly in the carotid artery. Cardiac output, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance were estimated using the method of human 125J albumin dilution. Midazolam caused a gradual fall of arterial blood pressure till 30 min of the experiment. The decrease of blood pressure in the first 45 min of the experiment might be a result of decreasing peripheral resistance, and after 60 min should be rather attributed to a decrease of cardiac output and stroke volume. Lidocaine did not change the influence of midazolam on the blood pressure and heart rate. The consequence was a decrease of blood pressure after midazolam and lidocaine administration. Combined administration of midazolam and lidocaine decreased the influence of both midazolam and lidocaine on the total peripheral resistance. An injection of midazolam with verapamil resulted in a significant decrease of blood pressure. Combined administration of midazolam and verapamil caused a significant decrease of heart rate as compared with the initial value and administration of midazolam alone.",

Chlordiazepoxide (2.5-5 mg kg-1, p.o.), diazepam (2.5-5 mg kg-1, p.o.) and lorazepam (0.5-1 mg kg-1, p.o.) induced dose-dependent significant changes in certain social and solitary behavioural responses. Thus increases in social grooming, approach, contact, self grooming, feeding and resting with eyes open and decreased aggressiveness and vigilance. On the other hand buspirone (5-10 mg kg-1, p.o.) produced no significant alteration in social and solitary behavioural patterns. On the basis of the above findings the social and solitary behaviour protocol in non-human primates can be a useful tool for studying the effect of a new anxiolytic compound before clinical trial.", 
    "138": "Clinical studies with clozapine have clearly demonstrated its superior efficacy over that of conventional antipsychotics in treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients. In comparative trials with these drugs, considerably more patients respond to treatment with clozapine than to conventional antipsychotic medication. Recently, new antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, and zotepine, have been introduced, but extensive data on their effects in treatment-resistant patients are not yet available. Published studies have drawn criticism in terms of inappropriate titration schedules, nonequivalent dosing between treatment groups, short treatment duration, and inadequate sample sizes. Further research will be needed to determine whether novel antipsychotics may substitute for clozapine in the future or whether clozapine will retain its unique role in the management of patients suffering from difficult-to-treat schizophrenic disorders.", 
    "139": "The participation of central cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8) receptors in the modulatory effect of D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol enkephalin (DAGO), a selective mu-opioid receptor agonist, on the spike burst activity of the gastrointestinal tract (rumen, reticulum, antrum, duodenum, colon and caecum) in sheep was investigated. DAGO was infused intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) at doses of 0.1-1 microg/kg body weight (BW). It was shown that DAGO significantly inhibited myoelectrical activity of the wall of the forestomachs, abomasum and colon but stimulated this activity in the duodenum (rate of myoelectrical migrant complex-MMC). The effects of DAGO were prevented by CCK-8 antagonists (L-364.718 and L-365.260) previously infused at doses of 5-20 microg/kg BW. The results of this present study indicate that central receptors of CCK-8 participated in the modulatory action of an opioid on myoelectrical activity of the gastrointestinal tract in sheep. Furthermore, this result suggests that CCK-8 is released in response to mu-receptor stimulation, because CCK-8 antagonists (L-364.718 and L-365.260) prevented the modulatory action of DAGO on the gastrointestinal motility in sheep.", 
    "140": "The rectal administration of diazepam (DZP) has provided a safer existence to many epilepsy patients and their carers, when prolonged or serial seizures are present. However, in patients with frequent seizures, chronic, intermittent over-administration may occur, particularly in the presence of multihandicaps.", 
    "141": "Six patients who experienced untoward effects from excessive rectal DZP are reported. In two patients, serial plasma levels of DZP and its active metabolites were monitored.", 
    "142": "Three patients exhibited a pattern of cyclic reappearance of seizures, interrupted by rectal DZP, followed by sedation and gradual awakening. The intervals were approximately 4 days. The three other patients had variable and complex symptoms with serial seizures and alternating states of tension, apathy, and sleepiness. The plasma levels of DZP and desmethyl-DZP showed rapid fluctuations.", 
    "143": "When rectal DZP is prescribed, chronic and excessive administration should be avoided. Fluctuating plasma-levels may probably support a cyclic reappearance of seizures in some patients. The combination of high bolus doses and a rapid drug clearance due to enzyme inducing co-medication may probably increase the risk for rebound reactions. Toxic, withdrawal, and epileptic symptoms may be intermingled and difficult to manage. A replacement strategy in the form of a prophylactic, oral, low dose benzodiaepine regimen may facilitate the discontinuation of this prescription pattern. Adequate counselling and medically appropriate, written directions for the use of rectal DZP is mandatory.", 
    "144": "Extensive evidence indicates that benzodiazepine receptors in the amygdala are involved in regulating memory consolidation. Recent findings indicate that many other drugs and hormones influence memory through selective activation of the basolateral amygdala nucleus (BLA). This experiment examined whether the memory-modulatory effect of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, selectively involves the BLA. Bilateral microinfusions of flumazenil (12 nmol in 0.2 microl) into the BLA of rats administered immediately after training in an inhibitory avoidance task significantly enhanced 48-h retention performance whereas infusions into the central nucleus were ineffective. These findings indicate that the BLA is selectively involved in mediating flumazenil's influence on memory storage and are thus consistent with extensive evidence indicating that the BLA is involved in regulating memory consolidation.", 
    "145": "Electroencephalograms (EEGs) and event-related potentials (ERPs) to auditory stimuli were recorded following intracerebroventricular administration of neuropeptide Y (saline, NPY: 1.0, 3.0 nmol) in two lines of rats that have been genetically selected for alcohol preferring (P) or non-preferring (NP) behaviors. Previous studies have demonstrated that NPY has a distinct electrophysiological profile that is similar to that of ethanol. In outbred Wistar rats, both NPY and ethanol produced highly significant decreases in the amplitude and increases in the latency of the N1 component of the ERP to all three auditory stimuli. Because the N1 has been associated with attention, these data suggest that both NPY and alcohol may diminish attentional processes. In the present study, NPY-induced decreases in N1 amplitude were also found, but only to the frequently presented tone. This suggests that both P and NP rats may have attenuated responses to NPY's effects on attention/arousal. Like outbred Wistars, P and NP rats were also found to have significant NPY-induced increases in N1 latency in the cortex and hippocampus. However, in the amygdala, while P rats evidenced increases in N1 latency and decreases in N1 amplitudes, NP rats displayed the opposite effects. Spectral analysis revealed that NPY also produced differential EEG responses in P and NP rats. In previous studies in outbred Wistar rats NPY has been found to produce slowing of delta (1-2 Hz) frequencies at the 1-nmol dose and reductions in power, particularly in the higher frequencies in the amygdala, at the 3-nmol dose. This electrophysiological profile is not unlike what is seen following alcohol and benzodiazepines and is associated with anxiolysis. P rats were found to have this general pattern of EEG responses to NPY but attenuated suggesting that they may have reduced responses to electrophysiological measures of the anxiolytic effects of NPY. In contrast, NP rats had NPY-induced EEG effects in amygdala and frontal cortex that were opposite to those seen in P rats. These opposing responses to NPY tended to produce a \"normalization\" of the power differences that existed between the two rat lines at baseline. Taken together with previous findings that P rats have decreased NPY concentrations in limbic and frontal cortical sites, these data suggest that differences in the regulation of NPY neurons may contribute to the expression of behavioral preference for ethanol consumption in these rat lines.", 
    "146": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) channels responsible for inhibitory synaptic transmission possess a consistent heterogeneity of structure in terms of distinct constitutive subunits. During the past 10 years, considerable progress has been made in understanding the magnitude of this large diversity. Structural requirements for clinically important drugs such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates have been elucidated, and the anatomical distribution in distinct neuronal populations and the developmental profiles of individual subunits have been elucidated with various techniques. However, the relevance of subunit heterogeneity to synaptic transmission is still largely lacking. Recently, substantial progress has been achieved in understanding the crucial role of desensitization as a molecular determinant in defining the duration and frequency responses of inhibitory synaptic transmission. This development, together with a combination of different experimental approaches, including patch-clamp recordings and ultrafast agonist applications in brain slices and mammalian cells expressing recombinant GABA(A) receptor, has begun to shed light on a possible role for subunit composition of synaptic receptors in shaping the physiological characteristics of synaptic transmission. Nowhere else in the central nervous system is the anatomical and developmental profile of GABA receptor heterogeneity as well understood as it is in the cerebellum. This review summarizes advances in the understanding of functional correlates to subunit heterogeneity in the cerebellum relevant for inhibitory synaptic function.", 
    "147": "Triazolam has shown promise as a sedative agent for use in pediatric dentistry. However, the efficacy of triazolam has not been previously examined in a placebo-controlled study. The present clinical trial used a two-group, randomized, double-blind study design to compare the efficacy of oral triazolam with that of a placebo. The primary hypothesis tested was that triazolam would reduce negative behaviors of pediatric dental patients compared with a placebo. A secondary hypothesis was that triazolam would increase the efficiency of dental treatment by reducing the need for time-consuming behavior management by the pediatric dentist. The subjects were 54 3- to 5-year-old children, randomly assigned to the drug and placebo groups. The active drug, 0.03 mg/kg triazolam (Halcion), or lactose placebo was given orally 30 min before dental treatment. Behavior management techniques commonly used in pediatric dentistry were used during dental treatment. A single pediatric dentist provided all of the dental treatment. The procedure included an inferior block anesthesia and careful attention to anesthesia effectiveness. All sessions were video-taped and the tapes coded for child and dentist behaviors by an independent observer. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups with respect to completion of dental treatment. There were no significant differences found in either the total time or the percent of time that the subjects exhibited disruptive movements, verbal or non-verbal distress. The total use of time in the dental chair was slightly higher in the placebo than in the drug group due to more time spent preparing the child. Contrary to preliminary reports in the literature, this investigation found little or no improvement in child behavior when triazolam was used as a sedative compared with a placebo. However, triazolam did shorten the length of dental treatment, primarily by reducing dentist time in preparing the child for the dental procedure (e.g., establishing rapport and shaping behavior).", 
    "148": "It has recently been reported that the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (formerly Ro15-1788) has depressant actions of its own on hippocampal potentials. It is noted here that similar results were obtained over ten years earlier, in association with work showing that benzodiazepine agonists and antagonists could inhibit the uptake of adenosine. Such an action would lead to the extracellular accumulation of adenosine which, because of its ability to suppress transmitter release, could explain the recent results.", 
    "149": "Detection of low levels of flunitrazepam and its metabolites was developed using solid-phase extraction to isolate the drugs from whole liquid blood and dried bloodstains, with subsequent derivatization with pentafluoropropionic anhydride (PFPA) followed by N-(tert-butyldimethyl-silyl)-N-methyl-trifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA) with 1% TBDMSCI. Analysis was confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy using select ion monitoring (sim) in electron impact mode. The limit of detection of this procedure using 1 ml of blood was determined to be 0.1 microgram/dl.", 
    "150": "Novel 1-aryl-3,5-dihydro-7,8-methylenedioxy-4H-2,3-benzodiazepine-4-ones (12a-j) were prepared and their anticonvulsant effects were evaluated by using various models of experimental epilepsy. The seizures were evoked both by means of auditory stimulation in DBA/2 mice and by pentylenetetrazole or maximal electroshock in Swiss mice. Some of these compounds possess marked anticonvulsant properties in all tests employed. Compounds 12 antagonise seizures induced by AMPA in analogy to the structurally-related 1-(4'-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3- benzodiazepine (1) (GYKI 52466), a well-known non-competitive AMPA-receptor antagonist. On the other hand, these novel 2,3-benzodiazepines exhibit anticonvulsant properties that are not affected by flumazenil, but are reversed by aniracetam. In addition, when compared to model compound 1, compounds 12 show a longer-lasting anticonvulsant activity and a lower toxicity. A structure-activity relationship study carried out on compounds 12 as well as analogous 7,8-dimethoxy derivatives 2 offers an approach for designing more potent agents.", 
    "151": "Poly(ethylene glycol)(PEG) macromers terminated with acrylate groups and semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (SIPNs) composed of poly(epsilon-caprolactone)(PCL) and PEG macromer were synthesized to obtain a bioerodible hydrogel. Polymerization of PEG macromer resulted in the formation of cross-linked gels due to the multifunctionality of macromer. Glass transition temperature (Tg) and melting temperature (Tm) of PEG networks and PCL in the SIPNs were inner-shifted, indicating an interpenetration of PCL and PEG chains. Water content in the SIPNs increased with increasing PEG weight fraction due to the hydrophilicity of PEG. The amount of clonazepam (CNZ) released from the SIPNs increased with higher content in the SIPNs, lower drug loading, lower concentration of PEG macromer during the SIPNs preparation, and higher molecular weight of PEG. In particular, a combination with low PEG content and low CNZ solubility in water led to long-term constant release from these matrices in vitro and in vivo."
