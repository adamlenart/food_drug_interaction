Intracisternally administered GABA or homotaurine inhibited, in a bicuculline-sensitive manner, the supraspinal micturition reflex. Bicuculline or picrotoxin increased the amplitude and duration of the micturition contractions of supraspinal origin, suggesting the existence of a tonic GABAergic inhibitory mechanism. Neither diazepam nor bicuculline or picrotoxin had any significant effect on threshold of the spinal vesico-vesical micturition reflex. Aminooxyacetic acid, an inhibitor of GABA catabolism, increased threshold of the spinal but not of the supraspinal vesico-vesical reflex in a bicuculline-sensitive manner. Volume threshold for eliciting the supraspinal reflex was increased by diazepam and decreased by picrotoxin. Neither picrotoxin nor aminooxyacetic acid modified amplitude of bladder contractions elicited by pinching of the perineal skin (spinal somato-vesical reflex) nor of that produced by preganglionic nerve stimulation of the excitatory nerves. It is concluded that endogenous GABAergic mechanisms involving the activation of GABA A receptors modulate both the spinal and the supraspinal vesico-vesical micturition reflexes. These endogenous GABAergic mechanism(s) are operating tonically in inhibiting micturition at supraspinal but not spinal level.", 
    "1": "At intrathecal administration the antinociceptive effect of morphine and DADL significantly exceeds the antinociceptive effect of pentazocine (ED50 in tail flick test were 1.1, 1.64, 75.0 nmol per mouse and in \"writhing\" test 0.0064, 0.0047, 24.53 nmol per mouse, respectively). All the agonists tested exhibited significantly higher activity at chemical stimulation than at thermal one. During the analysis of pA2 of naloxone during the interaction with morphine, DADL and pentazocine under thermal and chemical stimulation a pronounced mu-receptor component in the effect of DADL and pentazocine was suggested. A preliminary subcutaneous injection of sodium oxybutyrate (150 mg/kg) fails to change the activity of opioids administered intrathecally. Diazepam (5 mg/kg, subcutaneously) enhances the antinociceptive activity of DADL only at chemical stimulation. Haloperidol (2 mg/kg) increases the antinociceptive effect of morphine and DADL at pain stimulation of both types but exerts no influence on the analgesic effect of pentazocine. Haloperidol produces the most pronounced enhancement of the spinal component of delta-agonist DADL antinociceptive action. The enhancing effect of haloperidol is realized at the supraspinal level.", 
    "2": "Although the relationship between alcohol and traffic safety has been the subject of numerous studies, much remains unknown about the mechanisms by which alcohol contributes to traffic accidents. A number of other factors, which are reviewed in this paper, also can contribute to car accidents. They may also interact with alcohol, perhaps in a complex manner. Therefore, multiple factors rather than one single factor may contribute to automobile accidents for those who drink and drive.", 
    "3": "The purpose of this paper is to review our understanding of the involvement of central and peripheral factors in the control of feed intake in ruminants. The regulation of body weight under various states of energy need depends on an animal's ability to control feed intake to meet these needs. In the central nervous system (CNS), the ventromedial and lateral hypothalamus appear to be the areas involved in satiety and hunger, respectively; other important areas are the paraventricular nucleus and rostral brain areas. Intracerebroventricular injection of neurotransmitters, alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists, has stimulated feeding in ruminants; intravenous administration of benzodiazepines stimulated feed intake in sheep and cattle, possibly by increasing GABA levels in the brain. Neuropeptides of the opioid and cholecystokinin families have reciprocal hunger-stimulating and satiety-eliciting effects when administered centrally in sheep. Further, concentrations of these neuropeptides in specific areas of the hypothalamus have been shown to change with the state of hunger-satiety of sheep. In the periphery, none of the hormones associated with the pituitary, adrenal gland, pancreas or gastrointestinal tract has been shown to have significant effects on the control of feed intake. In addition, the physical properties of the ingested feed in the gastrointestinal tract, while possibly influencing the rate or pattern of feeding, do not appear to be primary factors in the control of feed intake under many feeding conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "Asperlicin, a product derived from the fungus Aspergillus alliaceus, antagonized the multiple stimulatory effects of cholecystokinin (CCK-8S) on isolated islets. At a level of 10 microM, asperlicin completely inhibited insulin release in response to 25 nM CCK-8S. Increasing the level of CCK-8S to 100 nM partially restored a secretory response, while an even greater insulin stimulatory effect was noted with 500 nM CCK-8S. The inhibitory effect of asperlicin on CCK-8S-induced release was reversible. Asperlicin exposure had no effect on glucose or glyceraldehyde-induced secretion. Asperlicin reduced, in parallel with secretion, the increase in 3H efflux from [3H]inositol prelabeled islets usually noted with CCK-8S addition. Asperlicin did not influence the small glucose-stimulated increase in 3H efflux. The results support the notion that asperlicin is a specific and potent antagonist of the multiple stimulatory effects of CCK-8S on islet tissue.", 
    "5": "War surgery presents conditions and problems that are radically different from those of peacetime surgery. Categorization of the injured may be necessary (triage), while a short or erratic supply of drugs, materials and personnel may exist. In this study, the hospital mortality following military action was 6.4 per cent. In the group of patients with combined thoracoabdominal injuries mortality was high. However, the inflow of this type of patient was relatively low. In 50 per cent of the cases, ketamine/benzodiazepine anaesthesia without intubation and artificial ventilation was sufficient, with the result that the use of oxygen and nitrous oxide was minimized.", 
    "6": "Behavioral effects of zopiclone were investigated in mice and rats and compared with the data on diazepam, nitrazepam and flurazepam. The electroencephalographic effect of the drug was also examined in unanesthetized rabbits with chronic electrode implants and compared with that of diazepam. The present results indicate that zopiclone possesses pharmacological properties qualitatively similar to benzodiazepines, which are characterized by potent anticonflict and antiaggressive effects and much weaker anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, ataxiogenic, sedative and anesthesia potentiating effects; the properties of this drug were compared with those of diazepam, nitrazepam and flurazepam. Zopiclone suppressed the EEG arousal responses and inhibited afterdischarges induced by electrical stimulation of the hippocampus and amygdala. The effects of zopiclone on EEG and afterdischarges were approximately 1/10 those of diazepam.", 
    "7": "The infusion rate of propofol required to supplement 67% nitrous oxide in oxygen to maintain surgical anaesthesia was determined in 72 patients premedicated with lorazepam. Following an induction dose of propofol 2 mg kg-1, groups of eight patients received an infusion of propofol varying from 60 to 200 micrograms kg-1 min-1. Probit analysis was used to determine the ED50 (130 micrograms kg-1 min-1; 95% confidence limits: 106-167 micrograms kg-1 min-1) and ED95 (348 micrograms kg-1 min-1; 95% confidence limits: 233-1296 micrograms kg-1 min-1) for propofol infusion. Whole blood propofol concentrations at the time of surgical incision correlated strongly with the infusion rate, giving an EC50 value of 2.5 micrograms ml-1, and an EC95 value of 5.92 micrograms ml-1. There was no significant correlation between the rate of infusion of propofol, or the total propofol dose, and the times to response to command, or to recall of birthdate.", 
    "8": "Intravenous and oral diazepam were evaluated as to their effectiveness in conscious sedation during two similar surgical episodes. Ten patients, six females and four males, from 30 to 60 years of age were included in the study. Patients received either 10 mg oral diazepam and saline intravenous injection or oral placebo and 10 mg intravenous (IV) diazepam at each trial. Half the patients received the oral diazepam first and the other half received the IV diazepam first. Patients were not informed as to the route of administration during each trial. Physiologic stress was measured by monitoring blood pressure, heart rate, skin temperature, galvanic skin response, and plasma catecholamine levels. Patients evaluated their comfort and nervousness levels on a questionnaire. Anterograde amnesia was tested by patient's ability to recall objects shown them during the procedure. As evidenced by the physiologic and biochemical parameters, intravenous diazepam was more effective in reducing anxiety and stress as compared with an equivalent oral dose. Patients' subjective ratings were consistent with these findings. Intravenous diazepam was effective in producing anterograde amnesia in the majority of patients, whereas no amnesic effect was noted with oral diazepam. Correlation statistics demonstrated a relative independence of the parameters measured in the present study indicating that all parameters must be considered in overall patient evaluation. Reduction of anxiety during the first surgery resulted in less anxiety on the subsequent visit.", 
    "9": "Thirty three healthy patients (ASA 1) who required the removal of impacted third molars were included in a double-blind cross-over trial to compare the amnestic and anxiolytic efficacy of diazepam and midazolam. The anxiolytic properties of the two drugs were assessed objectively by the measurement of changes in blood pressure, pulse rate, plasma cortisol levels, and subjectively by a patient assessment using a visual analogue scale for anxiety. The amnestic properties were evaluated by patient's ability to recall two visual stimuli they were shown. The first drug given was titrated to clinical sedation and the second drug was given in an \"equipotent\" ratio of 1.0 midazolam to 2.86 diazepam. There was a statistically significant fall in anxiety and good levels of amnesia achieved using both drugs. No statistical differences were detected between the two drugs.", 
    "10": "The hepatic microsomal nitroreductase activity and urinary excretion of the sum of the main metabolites of clonazepam (CNZ) were investigated in rats that had received 7 daily injections of 2 mg/kg of the compound. Despite the significant decrease in CNZ nitroreductase activity, there was only poor correlation between the enzyme activity and excretion of the assayed metabolites.", 
    "11": "Only in recent years has serious attention been given to the control of chemotherapy-induced emesis (CIE) which is to the patient a most obnoxious side-effect. Important advances in the understanding of the mechanisms of CIE have led to the scientific appraisal of potential anti-emetics whilst additional, useful anti-emetics have appeared by serendipity. CIE has largely been studied in trials separating either cis-platinum (severely emetic) or non-cis-platinum(moderately emetic)-induced emesis. In the evolution of these trials the difficulty and importance of accurate evaluation of emesis has been revealed and the whole area of psychogenic emesis opened to investigation and treatment. Phenothiazines and butyrophenones have a definite modest anti-emetic role against moderately emetogenic chemotherapy but increasingly corticosteroids, benzodiazepines, high dose metoclopramide and cannabinoids are being used with great effect even with severely emetic drugs. Combination anti-emesis has further improved control rates and new schedules of currently available anti-emetics are now proving their worth. Major advances in anti-emetic control have been achieved recently and every patient at risk of CIE should have good control, if not total abolition, of emesis with appropriate use of anti-emetics.", 
    "12": "The Ames test has shown that the action of nitrosomorpholine and cyclophosphane promutagens on bacteria of Salmonella typhimurium TA 1950 increases while using S-9 liver fraction of rats treated with pharmaceuticals of amidopyrine, reserpine and pyrazidol and decreases while using those treated with phenazepam.", 
    "13": "The development of ambulatory surgery has favored use of rapidly eliminated anesthetic agents or at least those whose clinical effects are easily predictable. Central analgesics such as fentanyl have not been very satisfactory; fentanyl is believed to have a short duration of action, but it has also been found to have a long half-life. A comparative study was conducted to determine whether the newer alfentanil would be more suitable for use in ambulatory surgery. 30 patients undergoing induced abortions arrived fasting at the hospital on the morning of the operation and were premedicated intravenously with .18 mg/kg midazolan and 2.2 mcg/kg of fentanyl or 24.2 mcg/kg of alfentanil. The efficacy of the premedication was assessed 5 minutes later just prior to anesthesia induction, which was achieved with 40 mcg/kg of alphadione. The delay to sleep was assessed by the disappearance of reflexes and of pain reaction. The delay to awakening was assessed by spontaneous opening of the eyes, response to a simple command, and unaided sitting up. Psychometric tests were administered 2 and 4 hours after anesthesia and compared to preoperative performance of the same tests. The 15 fentanyl and 15 alfentanil patients did not differ significantly in height, weight, or age. Premedication was considered good in the 15 fentanyl patients but excessive in 7 of the 15 alfentanil patients because of depressed respiration. There were no significant differences in pulse rate in the 2 groups. Systolic blood pressure diminished significantly in the 2 groups after induction but values returned to normal after 3 minutes. The respiratory response was significantly more marked and more prolonged in the alfentanil group, with respiratory frequency declining from 18 to 9 breaths/minute with 3 apnea episodes for 15 patients. Respiratory frequency declined from 19 to 15 breaths/minute in the fentanyl group. The average delay to sleep was shorter in the alfentanil group but the difference was not statistically significant. The duration of the operations was comparable in the 2 groups. Reinjection of analgesic was necessary for a few patients in each group. The difference was not statistically significant although the anesthesia appeared more stable in the alfentanil group. Awakening time appeared more rapid in the alfentanil group but the difference was not statistically significant. There was no significant difference in the test results for the 2 groups 2 and 4 hours after anesthesia. The results of this study do not appear to provide a decisive argument in favor or alfentanil for short term anesthesia.", 
    "14": "In a double-blind, randomized study the efficacy of Ro 15-1788 as a benzodiazepine antagonist was evaluated in patients anaesthetized with flunitrazepam. The effects were compared with a comparable group of patients who did not receive the antagonist. Ro 15-1788 significantly reversed the sedative and hypnotic effects of flunitrazepam and reduced the degree of anterograde amnesia. No side-effects were attributable to the drug.", 
    "15": "The antiepileptic action of clonazepam was studied on epileptogenic foci induced by penicillin in sensorimotor cortex in acute experiments in rats. Clonazepam (1 mg/kg intraperitoneally) only moderately decreased the frequency of interictal discharges of single cortical focus and delayed the propagation of discharges into the ipsilateral occipital region. On the contrary, clonazepam failed to influence the callosal projection of interictal discharges in single unilateral as well as in two symmetrical foci. Spontaneous transition of interictal discharges into ictal phases regularly seen when two symmetrical foci were formed was only delayed but not blocked by clonazepam. It may be concluded that clonazepam exhibits only a weak anticonvulsant action against cortical foci and against secondary generalization of epileptic activity.", 
    "16": "A constant gastric pH-value greater than 5 is decisive in drug therapy and prophylaxis of relapse after gastroduodenal ulcer bleeding. The optimal adjustment of therapy can be controlled by gastric long-time pH-metry. The method is demonstrated by representative case histories of children.", 
    "17": "The pyrazoloquinoline CGS 8216, a benzodiazepine receptor ligand, produced a dose-related (2.5-10.0 mg/kg, IP) attenuation of sham feeding a 30% sucrose solution by rats with open gastric fistulas. Ingestion was reduced by over 50% following the largest dose of CGS 8216 in a 60 min test. The initiation of sham feeding was not delayed by CGS 8216, but sham feeding was subsequently slowed over an extended test period. The suppressant effect of CGS 8216 was reversed by the specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro15-1788 (20 and 40 mg/kg, IP). Hence the effect of CGS 8216 on sham feeding may be mediated by benzodiazepine receptors, and is consistent therefore with the characterization of CGS 8216 as a benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist. In contrast to sham feeding, CGS 8216 (10.0 mg/kg, IP) did not affect sham drinking in 17 hr water-deprived rats. The results are discussed in relation to possible benzodiazepine receptor involvement in the neurochemical mediation of food palatability.", 
    "18": "The GABAA receptor has been purified to homogeneity from bovine cerebral cortex. Under stringent conditions of isolation, the GABAA receptor was shown to consist only of alpha (Mr 53 000) and beta (Mr 57 000) subunits. A densitometric scan of SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions showed that these subunits were present in a 1:1 ratio. A model of the receptor as a heterologous tetramer alpha 2 beta 2 is proposed. Monoclonal antibodies have been raised to the purified bovine GABAA receptor. One of these antibodies, 1A6, was shown to react with both the alpha and beta subunits of the purified receptor. The subunits were still positive in immunoblots following the removal of the carbohydrate moieties of the respective polypeptides by endoglycosidase F treatment. This antibody has been employed to demonstrate antigenic cross-reactivity between the GABAA receptors of three vertebrate species. It is further proposed that there is partial amino acid sequence homology between the alpha and beta polypeptides and hence that they are derived from a single ancestral gene.", 
    "19": "Rats tested on two occasions in a holeboard apparatus showed between-session habituation of exploratory activity. No habituation was observed on the measure of locomotor activity. Administration of chlordiazepoxide before the first test reduced exploratory behavior in this test and also reduced the degree of between-session habituation. Administration of RO 15-1788 reversed the effect of chlordiazepoxide on exploration in the first test, but failed to reverse the drug's effect on between-session habituation. It is unlikely that state-dependent retrieval could account for these results. The results are discussed in relation to the effects of benzodiazepines on learning and memory.", 
    "20": "The modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor by alphaxalone has been investigated by use of voltage-clamp recordings from enzymatically isolated bovine chromaffin cells maintained in cell culture. Alphaxalone (greater than 30 nM) reversibly and dose-dependently potentiated the amplitude of membrane currents elicited by locally applied GABA (100 microM). The potentiation was not associated with a change in the reversal potential of GABA-evoked currents and was not influenced by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, Ro15-1788 (300 nM). At relatively high concentrations (greater than 1 microM), alphaxalone directly elicited a membrane current. It is concluded that such currents result from GABAA receptor activation since they were reversibly suppressed by bicuculline (3 microM), dose-dependently enhanced by phenobarbitone (100-500 microM), and had a similar reversal potential (approximately 0 mV) to currents elicited by GABA. Additionally, on outside-out membrane patches, alphaxalone activated single channel currents with amplitudes and a reversal potential similar to those evoked by GABA. Alphaxalone (30 nM-1 microM) had no effect upon the amplitude of membrane currents elicited by locally applied acetylcholine (ACh) (100 microM). However, higher concentrations of alphaxalone (10-100 microM) reversibly suppressed ACh-evoked currents, the IC50 for blockade being 20 microM. The beta-hydroxy isomer of alphaxalone, betaxalone (100 nM-1 microM), did not potentiate GABA-induced currents, nor did higher concentrations of the steroid (10-100 microM) directly evoke a membrane current. However, over the latter concentration range, betaxalone suppressed the amplitude of currents elicited either by GABA or ACh. The relevance of the present results to the anaesthetic action of alphaxalone is discussed together with the broader implications of steroidal modulation of the GABAA receptor.", 
    "21": "The binding of the cage convulsant, [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS), to a picrotoxin-sensitive site in rat cerebral cortical homogenates was used to identify and characterize the site of action of the phenylquinolines PK 8165 and PK 9084, the isoquinoline PK 11195 and the atypical benzodiazepine (BZ) Ro5 4864. These agents were found to allosterically modulate the binding of 2 nM [35S]TBPS in a pharmacologically relevant fashion. Evidence is presented to suggest that these compounds share a common site of action as modulators of [35S]TBPS binding. The relative potencies of these compounds in vitro are in the submicromolar to micromolar concentration range and correlate well with the concentrations reported to elicit specific responses in behavioral and electrophysiologic studies. Modulation of [35S]TBPS binding in vitro is affected by micromolar quantities of gamma-aminobutyric acid in a (+)-bicuculline-sensitive fashion and is unaffected by the central BZ receptor \"antagonist\" Ro15 1788. Collectively, the evidence presented suggests the existence of a novel drug binding site that is functionally coupled to a gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptor and a [35S]TBPS-labeled chloride ionophore. Moreover, this site is distinct from the central BZ receptor recognized by clonazepam and the high-affinity peripheral BZ binding site labeled by [3H] Ro5 4864. The hypothesis is proposed that the novel \"Ro5 4864 site\" identified in the present study is a functionally relevant binding site that mediates some of the pharmacologic effects of Ro5 4864, PK 8165, PK 9084 and PK 11195 in the mammalian central nervous system.", 
    "22": "A statistically significant decrease in the density of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors was observed in renal membranes of rats beginning 2 weeks after adrenalectomy when compared with sham-operated controls. This decrease in peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density was manifest as a decrease in the maximum binding of two ligands, [3H]Ro 5-4864 and [3H]PK 11195, without accompanying changes in their Kd for this site. Similar changes were not seen in another aldosterone-sensitive organ, the submandibular salivary gland. The decrease in peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density observed in adrenalectomized rat renal membranes was restored to control levels after 1 week of aldosterone administration using a dose (12.5 micrograms/kg/day) that had no effect on peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density in sham-operated animals. In contrast, dexamethasone administration (50 micrograms/kg/day, 1 week) had no effect on renal peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density when administered to either adrenalectomized or sham-operated rats. Further, adrenal demedullation had no effect on renal peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density or affinity. The decrease in peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density was localized to the renal cortex and the outer stripe of the medulla by gross dissection of renal slices and renal tissue section autoradiography. The specific effect of adrenalectomy on renal peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density, the lack of direct effect of aldosterone on [3H] Ro 5-4864 binding and the localization of the change in peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density to the renal cortex and outer stripe suggest that these changes may reflect an adaptation of the renal nephron (possibly the distal convoluted tubule, intermediate tubule and/or the collecting duct) to the loss of mineralocorticoid hormones.", 
    "23": "DBI (diazepam-binding inhibitor) is a putative neuromodulatory peptide isolated from rat brain that acts on gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine-Cl- ionophore receptor complex inducing beta-carboline-like effects. We used a cDNA probe complementary to DBI mRNA and a specific antibody for rat DBI to study in rat brain how the dynamic state of DBI can be affected after protracted (three times a day for 10 days) treatment with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide by oral gavage. Both the content of DBI and DBI mRNA increased in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex but failed to change in the hippocampus and striatum of rats receiving this protracted benzodiazepine treatment. Acute treatment with diazepam did not affect the dynamic state of brain DBI. An antibody was raised against a biologically active octadecaneuropeptide (Gln-Ala-Thr-Val-Gly-Asp-Val-Asn-Thr-Asp-Arg-Pro-Gly-Leu-Leu-Asp-Leu-Lys ) derived from the tryptic digestion of DBI. The combined HPLC/RIA analysis of rat cerebellar extracts carried out with this antibody showed that multiple molecular forms of the octadecaneuropeptide-like reactivity are present and all of them are increased in rats receiving repeated daily injections of diazepam. It is inferred that tolerance to benzodiazepines is associated with an increase in the turnover rate of DBI, which may be responsible for the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor desensitization that occurs after protracted benzodiazepine administration.", 
    "24": "The binding of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS), a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-activated chloride ionophore ligand; [3H]diazepam, a benzodiazepine agonist; and [3H]muscimol, a GABA receptor probe, were used to assess the effects at 100 microM of deltamethrin, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and three experimental insecticides--a DDT-pyrethroid hybrid, GH414 (cycloprothrin), and two DDT-analogues, GH266 and GH149 (EDO), on GABA receptor ionophore complexes in a rat brain membrane preparation. GH266 and GH149 were found to inhibit a greater percentage of [35S]TBPS binding than the same concentration of deltamethrin or DDT, although GH414 had little effect. GH266 and GH149 enhanced [3H]diazepam binding by nearly 200%, in contrast to the inhibitory effects of deltamethrin, DDT, and GH414. GH266 and GH149 also caused a dramatic enhancement of [3H]muscimol binding, 367 and 236% of control, respectively, whereas DDT and deltamethrin caused only a moderate enhancement. The effects of the insecticides on binding affinity and density were examined for each of the ligands. The results show a differential interaction of the insecticides on the various ligand binding sites.", 
    "25": "Computed axial brain tomography was studied in 25 patients with panic disorder. Patients had normal ventricular-brain ratio (VBR) compared to published norms. There was a significant association between VBR and duration of benzodiazepine use.", 
    "26": "Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide immunoreactivity (IrANP) was measured before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass for coronary artery bypass graft placement. Eight subjects scheduled for elective operation had in the premedicated preoperative state slightly elevated IrANP compared to controls. Neither induction of anesthesia with a high dose narcotic/non-depolarising relaxant/diazepam technique nor cardiopulmonary bypass changed IrANP significantly. Mixed venous and arterial IrANP increased immediately after discontinuing bypass, and remained elevated 1 h later. Because ANPs affect peripheral resistance as well as urinary sodium loss, the post-bypass elevations in these peptides may contribute to cardiovascular and diuretic effects after cardiopulmonary bypass.", 
    "27": "The disposition of diazepam (D) after a single oral dose of 10 mg was evaluated in nine healthy male volunteers under the following conditions (randomized, double-blind, crossover design): D + comedication of placebo and D + nocturnal dosing with 300 mg ranitidine or 300 mg nizatidine. Plasma concentrations of D and its major active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam (DD), were monitored by a gas-liquid chromatography-electron-capture detection assay for 84 hours. Neither ranitidine nor nizatidine had any significant effect on the hepatic elimination of D as characterized by its terminal half-life (mean +/- SD) of 35.3 +/- 24.2 hours (+ ranitidine: 30.1 +/- 9.9 hr; + nizatidine: 37.3 +/- 18.3 hr) or total plasma clearance of 28.2 +/- 12.0 mL/min (+ ranitidine: 26.5 +/- 7.9 mL/min; + nizatidine: 26.7 +/- 10.4 mL/min). Likewise, the formation of DD as measured by its AUC was not affected by ranitidine or nizatidine. Thus, it can be concluded that concomitant once-daily dosing (300 mg nocturnally) with ranitidine or nizatidine does not impair hepatic drug metabolism.", 
    "28": "Double-blind study comparing efficacy and safety of alprazolam and bromazepam in 119 ambulatory anxious patients receiving flexible dosage. 119 ambulatory anxious patients (global score on the Hamilton anxiety rating scale between 18 and 35) have been included in this double-blind trial (duration 4 weeks) comparing alprazolam and bromazepam given at flexible dosage. The global score on the Hamilton anxiety rating scale improved by 57.8% and 55.3% for alprazolam and bromazepam respectively. The percentage of therapeutic success according to the psychiatrist and the patient were respectively 82.7% and 79.3% for alprazolam compared to 74.1% and 71.9% for bromazepam. Fewer side-effects were recorded in the alprazolam group (97) than in the bromazepam group (120) and global safety of alprazolam seemed superior (p = 0.07). At trial-end, mean dosage reached 1.70 mg/day for alprazolam and 10.35 mg for bromazepam, but no correlation was found between anxiety intensity and optimal daily dosage used; however, a correlation has been found between the improvement of the overall Hamilton rating scale score and the dosage given (p = 0.02). The overall results suggest that the efficacy/safety ratio is better for alprazolam.", 
    "29": "The interaction of diazepam and midazolam with non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs was studied in the sciatic nerve-tibialis anterior muscle preparation of the anaesthetized cat. Both diazepam and midazolam (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) caused a significant enhancement of a constant 50% neuromuscular block, produced by infusions of vecuronium or pancuronium. Increasing the dose of midazolam from 0.3 to 1.5 mg/kg, caused no significant further potentiation of vecuronium, but decreased the onset time of potentiation. Ro 15-1788, a selective benzodiazepine antagonist, did not antagonize the vecuronium potentiation caused by midazolam 0.3 mg/kg. However, when given before midazolam (1.5 mg/kg), Ro 15-1788 delayed the onset of potentiation. Ro 15-1788 antagonized and prevented the considerable blood pressure decrease produced by midazolam 0.3 and 1.5 mg/kg. There appears to exist a ceiling to the benzodiazepine-induced blood pressure decrease and potentiation of vecuronium in the cat.", 
    "30": "A patient with chronic psychosis and intermittent psychotic misidentification of the Capgras and intermetamorphosis types refractory to neuroleptic treatment was given a trial of clorazepate. Complete remission of psychotic symptoms was achieved for the first time in 19 years, but these recurred when the patient discontinued her clorazepate. It is concluded that clorazepate may be a useful treatment for some cases of chronic psychosis and psychotic misidentification. A possible mechanism for this is discussed.", 
    "31": "The purpose of the study was to ascertain whether the new hypnotic, zopiclone, was likely to produce rebound problems after short-term use, in comparison with placebo and a standard hypnotic, temazepam, and whether tapering the dosage lessened any such effects. Ten normal v olunteer subjects were administered 5 treatment sequences, each lasting 4 weeks, using a balanced design, with at least 2 weeks between sequences. The treatment sequences were: (table: see text) Each drug was given at night before retiring to bed. Daily ratings comprised a Sleep Questionnaire, Mood Rating Scales, the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory and Bodily Symptom Scales. Both drugs improved quality of sleep but their discontinuation was followed by some worsening which was postponed but not avoided by halving the dosage for a week. Speed of, and feeling on, awakening showed discontinuation effects with temazepam but not with zopiclone. Zopiclone was associated with feelings of being troubled, tense, antagonistic and bored whereas temazepam produced drowsiness, clumsiness, dreaminess and sadness. Some increase in these ratings was noted after stopping temazepam and these were less after having the dosage. Zopiclone was associated with minimal such effects. For bodily symptoms, zopiclone produced some headache, a metallic taste, and some blurring of vision; temazepam induced nausea, memory impairment and pins and needles. Withdrawal effects on bodily symptom ratings were inconsistent and not affected by tapering off the dose. In conclusion, the administration of zopiclone tends to be associated with some dysphoric effects, temazepam with sedation. Rebound effects are minimal with zopiclone and reducing the dosage gradually does not seem necessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "32": "Sixteen patients with neuroleptic-induced akathisia were treated with lorazepam. A marked improvement in symptoms was observed in 9 of the patient and moderate improvement in 5. Symptoms remained unchanged in 2 patients. The drop in the akathisia score from a pretreatment value of 1.81 to 0.5 after 7 days and to 0.32 after 14 days was statistically significant. Symptoms did not improve significantly during observation of the spontaneous course. No severe side effects were observed. The physiologic mechanisms of action of lorazepam on the akathisia syndrome are discussed.", 
    "33": "Buspirone is a novel anxiolytic chemically unrelated to the benzodiazepines. In clinical trials it has been shown to be as effective as diazepam, with fewer side effects. Buspirone is primarily active in dopaminergic pathways. It has the properties of both a dopamine agonist and antagonist. In this paper a model for treatment of tardive dyskinesia with buspirone is developed, based on dopamine autoreceptor blockade. A clinical trial of buspirone in the treatment of movement disorders is warranted.", 
    "34": "In experiments on superfused cerebral hemispheric cortex slices of rats preincubated with 3H-gamma aminobutyric acid (3H-GABA), 3H-serotonin (3H-ST) or 3H-noradrenaline (3H-NA) it was shown that benzodiazepine tranquillizers (chlordiazepoxide and diazepam at the concentration of 3 X 10(-5) M) fail to change basal and slice electrostimulation-induced release of 3H-GABA, depress presynaptic release of 3H-NA and significantly enhance impulse release of 3H-ST. In contrast to benzodiazepine tranquillizers, harmane and its derivatives administered at the same concentration enhance slice electrostimulation-induced release of 3H-GABA, 3H-ST and 3H-NA.", 
    "35": "The outcome of routine drug-supportive psychotherapy treatment of 100 patients with alcohol-related problem in Kuwait's only psychiatric hospital was evaluated in four 6 month's intervals. Patients were assessed on 9 post-treatment questions reflecting improvement or deterioration. Correlation of follow-up changes to pre-treatment data shows that non-Kuwaitis do better than Kuwaitis in resuming employment and social reintegration. Patients on chronic benzodiazepine prescription were less likely to become abstinent, had poor social re-integration and more re-admissions. Good relationships with the family were clearly associated with a better treatment outcome. Scores of weighted follow-up findings were calculated to assess patients' status at each follow-up. Progress during the whole follow-up period was measured by the direction of slope calculated from linear regression model for individual scores. The relationship between pre-treatment conditions and patterns of follow-up was evaluated cross-sectionally (answers distribution) and longitudinally (direction of slope). A pattern of shift emerged where different patient groups crossed over to the opposite end of the score scale. Kuwait society's indulgent attitudes towards Kuwaiti patients with alcohol-related problems in employment have to be changed and utilization of the role of the Arab extended family in therapy is stressed.", 
    "36": "The ability of three benzodiazepines to maintain self-administration behavior was studied in rhesus monkeys using a substitution procedure. Lever-press responding was maintained in six monkeys under a fixed-ratio schedule of IV pentobarbital delivery in daily sessions of 3 hr duration. Each of several doses of flurazepam, lorazepam and estazolam as well as saline and vehicle was periodically substituted for 4-13 consecutive sessions. Between dose or vehicle substitutions, responding was maintained by pentobarbital. All six monkeys self-administered flurazepam above vehicle or saline levels. In addition four of five monkeys tested with lorazepam and four of six tested with estazolam self-administered at least one dose of drug above control levels. These results indicate that self-administration performance can be reliably maintained in rhesus monkeys by certain benzodiazepines under appropriate experimental conditions.", 
    "37": "The binding of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, tolmetin (1-methyl-5-p-toluoylpyrrole-2-acetic acid) to human serum albumin (HSA) has been shown by circular dichroism, fluorescence and equilibrium dialysis to be dependent on the N-B conformational change of the albumin. The influence of calcium and chloride ions on the interaction was also investigated using the same techniques. Experiments suggested that calcium ions increased the binding constant of tolmetin to HSA whereas chloride ions decreased it. The displacement study showed that tolmetin caused a significant increase in the affinity of diazepam to HSA whereas it decreased the binding of warfarin to HSA. Tolmetin seems to cause an allosteric change in the diazepam binding site in spite of it sharing a primary site with warfarin.", 
    "38": "During 1984 and 1985, a study was conducted of 104 new adult users of benzodiazepines or antidepressants prescribed by sixty-two general practitioners in Sydney, Australia. New users of antidepressants tended to be older than new users of benzodiazepines. Seventy per cent of new users of psychotropic drugs were women and 67% were suffering significant psychological distress according to the 12-item general health questionnaire administered in a home interview. It was estimated that the general practitioners initiated approximately one new episode of use per week, and that repeat prescriptions constituted the bulk of general practitioner prescribing of these drugs.", 
    "39": "A retrospective study of pediatric patients presenting to a community hospital emergency department with acute intentional toxidromes was conducted. The characteristics of these patients and their initial medical management were reviewed. Forty-six patients were included in this study with 35 recreational overdoses and 11 suicide attempts or gestures. The mean age of these patients was 15.8 (range 10 to 18 years). The most commonly abused substance was ethanol, followed in frequency by benzodiazepines and barbiturates. Initial management centered on active airway management, gastrointestinal decontamination, and extended observation. Ten patients were intubated, lavaged, extubated, and subsequently discharged from the emergency department. Only one patient required hospital admission. The value of toxicologic screens, emergency department endotracheal intubations, gastric lavage, and charcoal/cathartic therapy is discussed.", 
    "40": "It is well established that compounds that modify dopaminergic and cholinergic activity in man may induce changes in circulating growth hormone (GH). We have, therefore, investigated the effect of a dopamine agonist, bromocriptine, and a dopamine antagonist, domperidone, as well as a muscarinic cholinergic antagonist, pirenzepine, on the GH response to an analogue of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) in normal male subjects. GHRH(1-29)NH2 induced a rise in serum GH that was augmented by bromocriptine, antagonized by pirenzepine, but was unaltered by domperidone. As this dose of GHRH(1-29) NH2 has been shown to be maximally stimulatory to GH release, it is suggested that there are dopamine stimulatory and cholinergic inhibitory receptors to GH release independent of GHRH in man.", 
    "41": "The binding of two anthranilic acid derivatives, glafenic and floctafenic acids, to human erythrocytes and plasma proteins has been investigated in vitro by equilibrium dialysis. Despite their close chemical structures it was shown that the binding of the two compounds to serum albumin, lipoproteins, and erythrocytes was dramatically different both in quality and quantity. Using various techniques including fluorometry and circular dichroism, it was shown that glafenic acid binds to the human serum albumin (HSA) warfarin/azapropazone site and that floctafenic acid binds to both warfarin/azapropazone and benzodiazepine sites. Glafenic acid is strongly bound to HSA with n = 1, k = 2.4 X 10(6) liters/mol and to erythrocytes with N = 12.4 mumol/liter, K = 1.7 X 10(6) liters/mol. Floctafenic acid is bound with a weaker affinity to HSA, n = 2, k = 0.3 X 10(6) liters/mol and to erythrocytes, N = 2900 mumol/liter and K = 0.007 X 10(6) liters/mol.", 
    "42": "Insomnia is a disorder of initiation and maintenance of sleep that results in daytime somnolence. The differential diagnosis of the various forms of insomnia is based primarily on the history, including information from the sleeping partner. The possibility of underlying depression or sleep apnea must be given consideration in every patient with insomnia, because inappropriate therapy may be dangerous in these instances. In general, the benzodiazepines have supplanted the traditional hypnotics in the treatment of insomnia.", 
    "43": "Anxious patients, and more specifically, patients experiencing panic attacks, are thought to have a significant biological component to their illness. This study looks at two promising biological markers associated with this patient population-mitral valve prolapse and lactate-induced panic. We present our findings, which further characterize clinical and biological aspects of these two markers.", 
    "44": "Sporadic spike discharges recorded on EEGs from epidural electrodes appeared 5-10 min after topical application of 0.3 nmol delta-guanidinovaleric acid (DGVA) on the pia mater of the sensorimotor cortex, on the same side as the application. Spike discharges induced by DGVA were completely suppressed within 10 min of supplementary application of GABA (50 nmol), (3R)-(-)-4-amino-3-hydroxybutanoic acid (L-GABOB) (5 nmols) or muscimol (5 nmols) on the pia mater, but the discharges were not affected by supplementing with 500 nmol of alpha-amino-DGVA, i.e., arginine (Arg). Whereas spike discharges were not induced by DGVA together with L-GABOB or muscimol, DGVA applied together with Arg induced spike discharges. Neither phenobarbital (PB) (20 mg/kg, i.m.), diazepam (DZ) (10 mg/kg, i.p.), sodium valproate (200 mg/kg, i.p.) nor diphenylhydantoin (20 mg/kg, i.p.) showed any suppressive effects on spike discharges induced by DGVA. DGVA induced spike discharges 20 min after pre-injection of PB or DZ. These electroencephalographic findings suggest that DGVA, which has one more carbon in its chain than N-amidino-GABA, might act directly on the GABA-receptor to induce spike discharges and might be a specific GABA-receptor antagonist.", 
    "45": "Calcium is a major second messenger in neurons and modulates many neuronal functions, including protein phosphorylation, phospholipid metabolism, cytoskeletal activity, and neurotransmitter release. These important events, which regulate neuronal activity, are directly dependent on the influx of extracellular calcium through voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs) in the neuronal membrane. Modulation of VSCC function represents an important strategy for regulating neuronal excitability. Although substantial evidence supports the ability of dihydropyridines to block VSCCs and contractility in cardiovascular tissue, their ability to block the majority of neuronal VSCCs remains controversial. Benzodiazepines, and other anticonvulsants, block depolarization-dependent 45Ca uptake through VSCCs in brain synaptosome preparations. In addition, benzodiazepines reduce voltage-gated calcium conductance as determined by voltage clamp studies of identified invertebrate neurons. Inhibition of VSCC activity may be an important mechanism by which these compounds produce their anticonvulsant and sedative effects. Intrasomal injection of calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase modulates calcium conductance in invertebrate neurons, suggesting that protein phosphorylation may be an endogenous regulatory mechanism of VSCC activity. Developing novel pharmacological approaches to regulating VSCCs and understanding the endogenous regulatory mechanisms may lead to new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of neurological diseases.", 
    "46": "Experiments were designed to compare the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s) in response to various muscarinic receptor agonists from canine femoral arteries mounted in organ chambers or perfused in a bioassay system. In rings of femoral arteries, suspended for isometric tension recording in organ chambers, acetylcholine induced endothelium-dependent relaxations during contractions evoked by prostaglandin F2 alpha. Atropine and pirenzepine antagonized these relaxations in a competitive manner, atropine with a higher affinity (KB = 1.9 X 10(-9) M) than pirenzepine (KB = 5.4 X 10(-7) M). Carbachol and McN-A-343 also evoked endothelium-dependent relaxations, and pirenzepine inhibited these responses with a similar low potency. The order of relative potency of the agonists in organ chamber studies was acetylcholine = carbachol much greater than McN-A-343. Isolated segments of femoral arteries with endothelium were perfused (2 ml/min) with modified Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate solution containing indomethacin; the perfusate was bioassayed for endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s) by means of a ring of coronary artery without endothelium. When infused above but not below the femoral artery, low concentrations (10(-8)-10(-7) M) of acetylcholine caused transient relaxations of the bioassay ring contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha; higher concentrations of acetylcholine caused sustained decreases in tension. Atropine inhibited the two phases of the concentration-relaxation curve with similar potencies. Pirenzepine inhibited both phases in a competitive manner but exhibited significantly higher potency against the first- (ED50, 1.9 X 10(-9) M) than against the second-phase responses (ED50, 2.1 X 10(-7) M). Compound McN-A-343 induced only transient decreases in tension, whereas carbachol caused sustained relaxations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "47": "Quantitative analysis of drug effects on the EEG is usually performed on a minicomputer using an EEG signal that has been recorded on a high frequency FM tape recorder and edited to remove artefact. However, this equipment is expensive and so the present study evaluated a much cheaper system, an 'on-line' microcomputer and 3 programs for data reduction. Using this system to assess diazepam effects on the rat electrocorticogram, it was concluded that period amplitude analysis may be preferable to the Fast Fourier Transform or Hjorth analysis.", 
    "48": "The effects of oral administration of 3 doses of ethanol (0.75, 1.0 and 1.5 g/kg) and single doses of morphine (2.5 mg/kg) and diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) on spectral components of the EEG were investigated in the squirrel monkey Saimiri sciureus. Comparisons of mean spectral power in the 4 frequency bands (2-4 Hz, 4-8 Hz, 8-16 Hz, 16-32 Hz) revealed that the lowest dose of ethanol (0.75 g/kg) produced some increase in power in all 4 frequency bands with significant increases in the 8-16 Hz band. Morphine also produced some increase in power in all bands; however, significant increases were prominent in the 16-32 Hz range. Moderate doses of ethanol (1.0, 1.5 g/kg) produced dose-dependent decreases in the lower frequencies which were significant in the 2-4 Hz band. Diazepam also produced significant decreases in the lower frequencies (2-4, 4-8 Hz) but also produced significant decreases in 8-16 Hz and increases in the 16-32 Hz band. The distribution of these power changes as a function of time (power spectral band time series) was also studied. Evaluation of fluctuations in the 8-16 Hz band which is a measure of the periodic shifts in alertness demonstrated that ethanol and diazepam slowed the dominant frequency of the time series; whereas, morphine caused an increase in the frequency. This study suggests that two EEG measures, mean EEG spectral profiles and power spectral band time series analysis, can successfully discriminate the electrophysiological actions of ethanol, and that these markers may provide a means for uncovering ethanol's mechanisms of action.", 
    "49": "There is evidence that central monoamines are involved in the actions of benzodiazepines. We have investigated the effects of a single dose of the benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist, FG 7142, on radioligand binding to alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptors in mouse cerebral cortex. We found that seven days after a single injection of FG 7142 there was a large increase in the density of beta-adrenoceptors. This rise was not detectable either 15-30 min, or 24 h after the injection and no statistically significant changes in alpha 2-adrenoceptor binding were found at any of these times. Administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 at the same time as FG 7142 prevented the rise in beta-adrenoceptor density. We discuss the possibility that the beta-adrenoceptor upregulation is related to the behavioural effects of FG 7142.", 
    "50": "Compounds of different chemical classes, with affinity for central benzodiazepine receptors, were investigated for effects on handling-induced ultrasonic cries in rat pups. Diazepam and clobazam inhibited ultrasounds and impaired motor performance at higher doses. Suriclone showed a similar profile to diazepam but premazepam clearly separated ultrasound inhibition from motor impairment. ZK 91296, CGS 9896, RU 39419 and RU 43028 inhibited ultrasounds with a lower maximal response but induced little or no motor incoordination. CL 218872 inconsistently inhibited sounds with no motor impairment and PK 8165 and PK 9084 had no consistent effects. Benzodiazepine antagonists weakly inhibited (RU 40410) or did not affect (Ro 15-1788 or CGS 8216) ultrasounds alone but fully (Ro 15-1788 or CGS 8216) or partially (RU 40410) antagonised the effects of benzodiazepines. Inverse agonists FG 7142, methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (BCM) and DMCM tended to increase ultrasounds alone, particularly when less stressful handling stimuli were used, and antagonised benzodiazepines. This procedure detects the differing behavioural effects of benzodiazepines receptor ligands and is proposed as a simple model of anxiety.", 
    "51": "The interaction of the 'neurosteroid', pregnenolone-sulfate (PS), with the GABA/benzodiazepine/chloride ionophore receptor complex was investigated in rat brain subcellular preparations. At low micromolar concentrations PS competitively inhibited the binding of the convulsant [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) and antagonized pentobarbital-stimulated [3H]flunitrazepam binding to synaptosomes. In addition, PS inhibited muscimol-stimulated 36Cl-uptake in brain synaptoneurosomes, including that PS has characteristics of a relatively potent antagonist of the chloride channel coupled to the GABA receptor. Together with our previous finding that A-ring reduced metabolites of progesterone and deoxycorticosterone also interact with the GABA receptor complex but as hypnotic barbiturates, these data suggest that the regulation of GABAergic neurotransmission by various neurosteroids may be an important mechanism for controlling neuronal excitability.", 
    "52": "The effects of electric foot-shock on the activity of the mesocortical dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons were estimated by measuring the changes in dihydrophenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and DA content in the prefrontal cortex of the rat. A marked rise in DOPAC content (+80%) and a significant decrease in DA levels (-23%) were observed after a 20 min foot-shock session. These effects were completely prevented by pretreatment with diazepam (5 mg/kg i.p.). ZK 93423, a recently synthesized beta-carboline with benzodiazepine-like properties, prevented the decrease in DA content induced by foot-shock at the dose of 20 mg/kg. Moreover, the stress-induced increase in DOPAC levels was partly or completely blocked by pretreatment with 20 or 40 mg/kg of ZK 93423, respectively. These results provide further support for the view that the mesocortical DAergic system can be modulated by drugs that selectively interact with the benzodiazepine recognition site.", 
    "53": "Previous results have suggested that behavioural adaptation to restraint might be promoted by post-restraint stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors. Therefore, rats were restrained for 2 h and injected with vehicle or 60-1,000 micrograms/kg of the 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) s.c. Vehicle-treated restrained rats showed reduced locomotor activity and increased defaecation in an open field test the day after the end of restraint. A single injection of 250 or 1,000 micrograms/kg 8-OH-DPAT attenuated these effects. The above locomotor deficits were also attenuated by chronic pretreatment with the antidepressants desipramine and sertraline but not by a single treatment with desipramine or the benzodiazepine anxiolytic drugs chlordiazepoxide and diazepam; none of these treatments unambiguously reversed stress-induced increases in defaecation. Evidence suggests that the above action of 8-OH-DPAT is mediated by 5-HT1A receptors since it was antagonised by the 5-HT1A antagonist spiperone but not by the 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin and was not mimicked by the 5-HT1B agonist RU 24969. However, the 5-HT1A agonists buspirone and TVXQ 7821 (ipsapirone) and the non-specific 5-HT agonist quipazine all possess similar properties to 8-OH-DPAT in this test. The results suggest that 5-HT1A agonists may have rapid antidepressant properties.", 
    "54": "We have evaluated the effect of Ro5-4864, a selective probe to label peripheral type benzodiazepine receptor, on \"in vitro\" testicular androgen production. Decapsulated testes from adult rats showed a significant increase in the basal and hCG-stimulated testosterone secretion into the medium in response to 10(-5) M, 10(-6) M, and 10(-7) M Ro5-4864. In addition, we have studied the changes in testicular GABA content at three different ages and we found its highest concentration at 31 days of age. When we evaluated the effect of GABA on \"in vitro\" androgen production at different stages of gonadal maturation we observed that the highest concentration of GABA (10(-6) M) was able to modify the basal and hCG-stimulated androgen production from adult (60 days) and pubertal (45 days) testes. In addition, when prepubertal testes (31 days) were incubated under basal conditions, 10(-6) M GABA induced a significant increment of androstanediol production, while the stimulatory effect of hCG was reduced in the presence of the same GABA concentration. The present results suggest that GABA plays a physiological role in the regulation of rat testicular androgen production depending on the stage of sexual maturation.", 
    "55": "Afferent connections of the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) are classically thought to originate in the mammillary body and limbic cortex. This study explores nonlimbic sources of ATN afferents by using retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to ascertain the relative contribution of these connections. Spread of HRP into adjacent regions was prevented either by removing the overlying cortex or by injecting through permanently implanted cannulas. The main sources of nonlimbic ATN afferents are the pretectum and central gray. Pretectal neurons were HRP-labeled primarily in the contralateral medial pretectal nucleus with a smaller number in the ipsilateral posterior pretectal nucleus. In the central gray, labeled cells were concentrated ipsilaterally in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus. Additional projections to ATN originate in the reticular and ventral lateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus, raphe nuclei, peripontine tegmental nucleus, and locus coeruleus. The association of ATN afferents with muscarinic receptors was also explored by means of in vitro receptor autoradiography with the muscarinic ligands propylbenzilylcholine mustard (PrBCM) and pirenzepine (PZ) in normal rats and rats with ablations. Ibotenic acid injections into ATN were used to destroy intrinsic neurons while leaving afferent fibers intact. Whereas such ablations produced statistically significant decreases in PrBCM binding in the anterior dorsal (AD, -45%) and anterior ventral, magnocellular part (AVm, -51%) nuclei, binding in the anterior ventral, parvicellular part (AVp) and anterior medial (AM) nuclei was not significantly decreased. Furthermore, PZ binding in normal rat ATN was significantly less (-72%) than PrBCM binding. These results suggest that a major proportion of muscarinic binding is associated with presynaptic elements. Ibotenic acid ablations of the mammillary body reduced PrBCM binding in ATN whereas lesions in cingulate cortex and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus had no effect. Compared to sham lesion controls, mammillary body lesions resulted in statistically significant decreases in binding bilaterally in AD (-15%), AVm (-19%), and AM (-20%). In conclusion, ATN receive afferents from several nonlimbic regions. Of these inputs, the pretectum may be the primary route through which sensory information reaches ATN. In addition, cholinergic input may modulate activity in projections from the mammillary body to ATN through presynaptic muscarinic receptors.", 
    "56": "In 1983-1984, 9.8 million prescriptions were written for the 12 most common psychotropic drugs that are available under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Our analysis shows that, of these prescriptions, 59% (374 per 1000 persons) were for the four most commonly prescribed benzodiazepine agents; 34% (216 per 1000 persons) were for the five main antidepressant agents; and 7% (41 per 1000 persons) were for the three main phenothiazine agents. In the period from 1977-1978 to 1983-1984, prescription volumes were relatively stable for antidepressant and phenothiazine drugs. Fluctuations in the prescribing of individual benzodiazepine agents are discussed. Older patients and women of all ages receive the majority of the psychotropic drug prescriptions that are written by Australian general practitioners.", 
    "57": "Propofol (2,6,di-isopropylphenol) was given by continuous intravenous infusion to provide sedation after cardiac surgery in 30 patients and its effects compared with those of midazolam given to a further 30 patients. Propofol infusion allowed rapid and accurate control of the level of sedation, which was satisfactory for longer than with midazolam. Patients given propofol recovered significantly more rapidly from their sedation once they had fulfilled the criteria for weaning from artificial ventilation and as a result spent a significantly shorter time attached to a ventilator. There were no serious complications in either group. Both medical and nursing staff considered the propofol infusion to be superior to midazolam in these patients. These findings suggest that propofol is a suitable replacement for etomidate and alphaxalone-alphadolone for sedating patients receiving intensive care.", 
    "58": "The [1-14C]2-deoxyglucose technique was employed for an evaluation of the regional pattern of alteration of brain metabolism induced by the anxiolytics phenobarbital (which is described in small doses as anxiolytic agent) and meprobamate. Their effects were compared with those produced by the anxiolytic benzodiazepine diazepam which we have described in a previous study. In low doses, both meprobamate (30 mg/kg i.v.) and phenobarbital (5 mg/kg i.v.) elicited a regional pattern of changes similar to those seen with diazepam. Thus, the local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) of the mammillary nuclei, the lateral and ventral thalamic nuclei, the anterior thalamic nuclei and the geniculate nuclei was significantly decreased. A doubling of the dose (meprobamate 60 mg/kg i.v.; phenobarbital 10 mg/kg i.v.), however, resulted in a decrement in LCGU in virtually every brain region examined. Further, at this higher dose, phenobarbital significantly increased LCGU in the interpeduncular nucleus. These data demonstrate that both meprobamate and phenobarbital, in moderate doses induce selective alterations in LCGU in particular brain regions with the pattern of changes similar to that induced by diazepam. The structures affected may be of general importance for the expression of the anxiolytic actions of each of those classes of minor tranquilizers in clinical use.", 
    "59": "Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195, ligands for the peripheral benzodiazepine binding site, blocked 45Ca2+ uptake into depolarized guinea-pig cortical synaptosomes. The fast phase of uptake was significantly more sensitive than the slow phase. The central benzodiazepine ligands, Ro 15-1788 and beta-CCE at 10(-4) and 5 X 10(-5) M respectively, were less effective and did not discriminate between fast and slow uptake phases. Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195 inhibited and potentiated respectively the binding of [3H]nitrendipine to synaptosomes by effects on the KD value. PK 11195 (10(-5) M), blocked K+ depolarization and Bay K 8644-induced tension responses in guinea-pig ileal longitudinal smooth muscle. Benzodiazepines do interact with voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels but the present data are insufficient to prove direct coupling of peripheral benzodiazepine sites with Ca2+ channels.", 
    "60": "Male Sprague Dawley rats were trained to discriminate an interoceptive effect associated with a subconvulsant dose (30 mg/kg i.p.) of the excitatory amino acid receptor agonist, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). Approximately 60% of the rats learned to discriminate this compound from saline in 45 +/- 5 sessions, and the stimuli were dose dependent (ED50 value = 13.6 mg/kg i.p.). The specific NMDA receptor antagonist, 3-[+/-)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP), blocked NMDA-induced discriminative stimuli with an ED50 value equal to 2 mg/kg i.p., confirming that the NMDA cue is mediated by activation of NMDA receptors. Through the use of NMDA discriminative stimuli, the consequences of NMDA excitation can be studied in vivo and compounds with potential NMDA antagonist properties can be identified.", 
    "61": "Membrane effects of carbachol (50 microM) on GH3 pituitary cells were studied using whole-cell type electrophysiological techniques. Carbachol (50 microM) decreased the threshold for generation of spontaneous and current-induced action potentials and prolonged their duration. It is suggested that carbachol blocks potassium channels in GH3 pituitary cells, and that the effect is mediated via activation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors.", 
    "62": "Treatments for chronic anxiety have received considerable interest recently. Firstly, there is a body of research which has shown problems of dependence and habituation in the long-term use of anti-anxiety drugs. A second development is that of psychological treatments for anxiety. Because of the problems involved in the use of benzodiazepines, it is important to determine whether or not psychological treatments are a reasonable alternative when treating chronic anxiety. This study was designed to test the relative effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural therapy, anxiety management training and treatment by benzodiazepines against a waiting list control. Measures were taken on both the process and outcome of treatment. The most immediate and greatest improvements in anxiety were seen in the group receiving drugs. However, these improvements reduced as the trial progressed and were minimal at the end of therapy. Both psychological treatment groups improved as the trial progressed with the most significant and consistent changes seen in the cognitive-behaviour therapy group. However, at follow-up there was no difference between the two groups receiving psychological treatments. Because of their lack of sustained improvement, over half of the group receiving drugs refused to wait without treatment until the follow-up assessment.", 
    "63": "In many endoscopy units midazolam is replacing diazepam as the intravenous sedative of first choice. Midazolam is approximately twice as potent as diazepam. Although generally considered a safe drug, there have been a number of recent reports, particularly in the elderly, of the drug causing hypotension, respiratory depression and even death. There have been at least ten studies comparing diazepam with midazolam for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy but many have involved relatively small numbers and none have adequately addressed the question of dosage in the elderly. We have carefully recorded the dose of intravenous midazolam used to produce adequate sedation prior to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in 800 consecutive patients. The dose of midazolam decreased markedly with age in both male and female patients. There was a highly significant correlation in both sexes between age and the dose of midazolam (rho -0.787, P less than 0.001 for males and rho -0.768, P less than 0.001 for females). There was only a small difference in dose in men and women, an average of 1 mg; and no difference in dose over the age of 70 years. In patients over 70 years of age the dose of midazolam necessary for endoscopy is often so small that overdosage is all too easy.", 
    "64": "The development of anticonvulsant tolerance during 10 days treatment with either clobazam or its principal metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam (NDMC), was compared in mice using an i.v. infusion of pentylenetetrazole as the convulsive stimulus. Subsequently the anticonvulsant activity of NDMC was assessed in patients with refractory epilepsy. In mice, a highly significant tolerance (P less than 0.001) developed to clobazam (10 mg kg-1 twice daily). During the same period, there was no significant change (P greater than 0.05) in the protection afforded by NDMC (40 or 80 mg kg-1 twice daily) although some reduction in anticonvulsant activity was apparent. NDMC (30 mg once daily) was given to nine patients with frequent complex partial and/or grand mal seizures who had become tolerant to the anticonvulsant effect of clobazam. Seven of the patients had been free from benzodiazepine therapy for at least 2 weeks, while the other two patients were switched directly from clobazam. Eight of the nine patients showed a favourable response to NDMC. In the seven who had been given a holiday from clobazam the response to NDMC was similar to the initial response to clobazam and was achieved at plasma NDMC concentrations in the same range as those seen during clobazam administration (1000-3000 ng ml-1). It is concluded that NDMC is active as an anticonvulsant in man and there is evidence from the animal studies to suggest that it may be preferable to clobazam.", 
    "65": "The role of Pavlovian conditioning in tolerance to the depressant effect of a benzodiazepine (midazolam) on the ambulatory activity of rats was examined. The depression of activity by low doses (1.0 and 4.0 mg/kg, ip) of midazolam diminished quickly over repeated doses given at 48-hr intervals (Experiment 1). Equivalent tolerance was observed in groups measured at 2 min and 30 min after drug injection. When challenged with saline, however, drug-tolerant animals tested immediately after injection were hyperactive in comparison with nontolerant controls, whereas equivalent groups tested 30 min after injection were not. A second context was designed, and its discriminability from the original was established by assessing context-specific suppression of activity following exposure to mild electric shock (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3A, although tolerant animals tested in the drug-associated context remained fully tolerant, a second group demonstrated a complete loss of tolerance when given the drug in a saline-associated context. Both groups were fully tolerant when tested again in the drug-associated context after 14 drug-free days. In Experiment 3B, tolerance was significantly reduced by 14 extinction exposures to the drug-associated environment without the drug. These results are uniquely predicted by associative models of drug tolerance and may have implications for the clinical use of this class of drugs.", 
    "66": "The effects of fentanyl or diazepam on somatosensory, visual and brainstem auditory evoked potentials were studied in 13 healthy patients scheduled for elective surgery. Following control recordings of evoked potentials, either diazepam 20 mg or fentanyl 200 micrograms was administered intravenously. Evoked potentials were then recorded twice in the subsequent hour. No significant changes occurred in the latency or amplitude of somatosensory, visual or brainstem auditory evoked potentials. Although dose-related changes in evoked potential latencies and amplitudes have been demonstrated with both the inhalational and intravenous anaesthetics, these changes did not occur with diazepam or fentanyl used alone. An anaesthetic technique based on these two drugs would be suitable when intra-operative evoked potential monitoring is required to assess ischaemia and preservation of evoked responses.", 
    "67": "Platelet serotonin (5-HT) concentration did not significantly differ between control subjects (N = 45) and schizophrenic (N = 62) or chronic schizophrenic (N = 39) patients. No clinical feature was associated with hyperserotonemia, but the subgroup receiving benzodiazepines had a significantly higher 5-HT level than other patients.", 
    "68": "The astute family physician recognizes that such complaints as fatigue, pain, weight change and insomnia may be manifestations of depression rather than of physical illness. This diagnostic challenge is simplified by a working knowledge of the criteria for depression and mania. In addition to diagnosing depression, family physicians can successfully treat this condition with antidepressant medications.", 
    "69": "Pretreatment with anticonvulsants partially protects animals against the brain damage induced by intraparenchymal injection of kainate, an analogue of the neurotransmitter glutamate. In murine cortical cell culture, high concentrations of phenobarbital, diazepam, phenytoin, or GABA itself did not prevent glutamate-induced neuronal loss. Addition of a glutamate receptor antagonist (gamma-D-glutamyl glycine) did reduce glutamate neurotoxicity. The in vivo protective effect of anticonvulsant drugs against the toxicity of excitatory amino acids must be indirect.", 
    "70": "We report our experience with 300 consecutive parenteral doses of lorazepam (LOR) for status epilepticus (SE) or serial seizures in 77 children and young adults. The median dose for SE in children less than 12 years old was 0.10 mg/kg. LOR stopped the SE in 79% and diminished the intensity of SE in an additional 4%. Prior acute or chronic anticonvulsant use (excepting chronic benzodiazepines) did not alter effectiveness or increase side effects. Duration of freedom from seizures following acute therapy was independent of LOR dosage. In patients requiring sequential doses, LOR becomes progressively less effective. Side effects were few and, when present, always associated with a single or first dose in a series. LOR is a safe and effective acute anticonvulsant agent for in-hospital control of SE in the pediatric age group. Tachyphylaxis of anticonvulsant action occurs when serial doses are used.", 
    "71": "The novel anxiolytic buspirone was administered to pigeons in a two-key drug discrimination task in an effort to characterize the stimulus properties of the drug and thereby aid in isolating the pharmacologic basis for its anticonflict effect. Key pecking was maintained by a schedule of reinforcement in which every 30th injection-appropriate response was reinforced by the presentation of food. Subjects were first trained to discriminate buspirone (1.0 mg/kg) from saline, and then generalization tests were conducted using a cumulative dosing procedure. Cumulative doses of buspirone (1.0-3.0 mg/kg), the buspirone analog MJ 13805 (1.0 mg/kg) and the 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A ligand 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (0.3-1.0 mg/kg) produced in excess of 90% buspirone-appropriate responding, whereas midazolam (0.03-1.0 mg/kg), haloperidol (0.03-1.7 mg/kg), apomorphine (0.03-1.0 mg/kg), clozapine (0.1-3.0 mg/kg), methysergide (0.1-3.0 mg/kg) and the 5-hydroxytryptamine-1B ligand 1-[3-chlorophenyl]piperazine (0.3-10.0 mg/kg) produced little or no buspirone-appropriate responding up to those doses that markedly decreased response rate. These findings support recent behavioral and receptor binding studies suggesting that serotonin receptors, and 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A receptors in particular, may be responsible for mediating the anticonflict effects of buspirone and other atypical anxiolytics. The results also corroborate other behavioral work showing that the anxiolytic effects of buspirone are most likely not mediated by the dopaminergic system.", 
    "72": "Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are being used more frequently in the treatment of various psychiatric and neurological disorders. Although adverse effects of MAOI treatment are widely known, withdrawal symptoms are less well known. They include nausea, sweating, palpitations, nightmares, and psychosis. Withdrawal reactions from combination therapy with an MAOI and another agent are seldom described. Reported here is the occurrence of myoclonic seizures after the abrupt discontinuation of phenelzine and alprazolam. Alterations in the GABA and serotonin neurotransmitter systems as a result of withdrawal of the MAOI and the benzodiazepine may account for the seizures.", 
    "73": "The action of topical convulsants, such as strychnine, is not exerted equally on all sets of neurons in the sensorimotor cortex of cats. Small-field neurons near the surface are influenced whereas deeper, wide-field neurons are affected only indirectly. The agent, picrotoxin, was used to test whether or not the deeper neurons are spared the effects of topical convulsants simply because of their location. Picrotoxin, injected intravenously, produced enhancement of the corticofugal reflex discharge evoked by stimulation of any of the four paws and by auditory stimulation. The surface-recorded primary evoked response was also enhanced but only slightly, far less than with topical application. The evoked response in the medial lemniscus was not altered by picrotoxin, but that in the thalamic radiations was enhanced. The drug diazepam, injected intravenously, diminished the enhancements of both the corticofugal reflex discharge and the evoked potential, in some cases reducing the responses to amplitudes smaller than control values. Single-cell recordings in other laboratories have shown that intravenous picrotoxin converts small-field cells to wide-field cells, and that diazepam reverses this effect. The increase in the surface-recorded primary response and the size of the increase in the corticofugal reflex suggest that there is also a direct effect on wide-field neurons or on the pathway leading to them.", 
    "74": "Intravenous access for the administration of antiepileptic drugs can be both time-consuming and difficult in an actively seizing infant. We conducted a study to examine the intraosseous route as an alternate means of vascular access for the administration of diazepam in a pentylenetetrazol-seizure model in pigs. Epileptogenic activity was induced with pentylenetetrazol 100 mg/kg in 15 domestic swine that had undergone craniotomies for electrocortical recording. Diazepam (0.1 mg/kg) was administered IV (n = 5) or intraosseously (n = 5); control animals received no drug (n = 5). Epileptogenic activity was suppressed below control levels within one minute in the IV group and within two minutes in the intraosseous group. A two-way analysis of variance did not show a significant difference between the IV and intraosseous routes; however, both were significantly different when compared to the control. There also was no significant difference in plasma diazepam levels between the two groups at one, two, five, ten, 15, and 20 minutes. Our study demonstrated that the intraosseous route is a rapid and effective alternative for diazepam administration.", 
    "75": "A prospective study of non-convulsive status epilepticus was undertaken in order to evaluate the occurrence and characteristics of this condition in adults. The diagnosis was established in 22 of 113 patients (19 per cent) presenting with status epilepticus over a 23-month period. Non-convulsive status was most prevalent in the over 60 age group. Its two subgroups, absence status (18 cases) and complex partial status (four cases) were both manifest clinically by a prolonged alteration of consciousness of variable extent. Absence status presented de novo (six cases) or against a background of epilepsy (12 cases), often with a long seizure-free interval before presentation. Precipitating factors included infection, inadequate anticonvulsant medication and benzodiazepine withdrawal. The clouding of consciousness was usually characterised by confusion, disorientation and partial responsiveness. Myoclonic or clonic movements of the eyes, face or jaw were evident in all but two patients. Automatisms, including ambulatory behaviour (three cases) were less common. Serious psychiatric disorders preceded the status in seven cases, and contributed to the difficulty in diagnosis. Complex partial status was associated with underlying cerebrovascular disease in three of four cases, and is characterised by a more severe and variable clouding of consciousness, less frequent facial clonic movements, episodic adversive head and eye movements, and a more gradual recovery after treatment."
