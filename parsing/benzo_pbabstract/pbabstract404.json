Clinically, an autoimmune reaction involving the GABA biosynthesizing enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase has been implicated in the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. To determine the subtypes of GABAA receptor expressed in human pancreas, we analyzed, with the use of the reverse-transcription/polymerase chain reaction technique human pancreatic tissue for the presence of GABAA receptor subunits alpha 1-6, beta 1-3, and gamma 1-2 transcripts. Unlike brain tissue, pancreatic tissue only expresses the alpha 2, beta 3 and gamma 1 subunits. Our results provide evidence of a specific GABAA receptor subtype expressed in human pancreatic tissue.", 
    "1": "The akinetic crisis is an \"off\" state that lasts more than 48 hours with akinesia, rigidity and bradykinesia, occurring with signs of CNS dysregulation in advanced stages of Parkinson's disease. 7 akinetic crises lasting 4 to 14 days (average 9.3) were observed in 744 hospitalizations over a period of 7 years. The age of the patients with akinetic crisis and the mean duration and the severity of the disease were significantly higher than in the other patients. While bradykinesia and rigor are the most relevant clinical signs in some 40% of parkinsonian patients, 6 of our 7 patients (86%) had an akinetic-rigid form of the disease. Levodopa withdrawal preceded the akinetic crisis in 4 patients: in 3 patients the akinetic crisis occurred despite adequate dopaminergic therapy, in one patient after benzodiazepine withdrawal, in another case after gastrointestinal bleeding, and in one case without known cause. Hyperthermia, tachycardia and sweating were the most common collateral manifestations. Apomorphine given subcutaneously was effective in four cases, apomorphine and amantidine were effective in one case, and one patient died during an akinetic crisis. The akinetic crisis is a distinct form of motor fluctuation in advanced stages of Parkinson's disease, with clinical signs resembling malignant neuroleptic syndrome (NMS). While NMS is related to dopaminergic receptor blockade or dopaminergic depletion, akinetic crisis can occur despite adequate dopaminergic therapy as a symptom of severe basal ganglia dysfunction related to the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease. Outcome and therapy of akinetic crisis depend on the underlying causes.", 
    "2": "Antibodies specific for subunits of the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor have been used to immunoprecipitate [3H]muscimol, [3H]Ro 15-4513, and [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding sites from deoxycholate-solubilized preparations of rat cerebellum. Of the antisera raised against alpha subunits, those specific for alpha 6 immunoprecipitated the largest proportion of receptors. Two populations of alpha 6-containing GABAA receptors were identified. The first was labeled with [3H]Ro 15-4513 and exhibited a pharmacological profile consistent with that observed for alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 in transfected cells (L\u00fcddens, H., Pritchett, D. B., Kohler, M., Killisch, I., Keinanen, K., Monyer, H., Sprengel, R., and Seeberg, P. H. (1990) Nature 346, 648-651). The second population was labeled only with [3H]muscimol and was deduced, from quantitative immunoprecipitation studies using combinations of antibodies, to contain both alpha 6 and delta subunits. The alpha 6 subunit was not observed to be present in combination with other alpha subunits or the gamma 1 subunit. Each of the other alpha subunits was found to be present in only one population of receptors in the cerebellum. Some subunits (alpha 4, alpha 5, and gamma 3) were not detectable. By combining information from quantitative immunoprecipitation experiments and Western blot analysis, a model describing the composition of all GABAA receptors in the cerebellum was constructed that defined the following alpha and gamma/delta combinations (percentage of cerebellar GABAA receptors): alpha 6 gamma 2 (36%), alpha 6 delta (23%), alpha 1 gamma 2 (28%), alpha 2 gamma 1 (8%), and alpha 3 gamma 2 (5%).", 
    "3": "Drug dependence in \"pain patients\" usually involves primary headache syndromes with chronicity resulting from the use of analgesic-psychotropic or ergotamine-containing combination preparations. Since, during the withdrawal phase, enhancement of pain intensity together with other abstinence phenomena are to be expected, hospitalization is usually indicated. Psychosomatic pain syndromes with dependence on benzodiazepine derivatives represent the second largest group. In these patients, withdrawal is effected stepwise, usually on an outpatient basis. Opioid analgesics administered to patients to treat chronic pain do not necessarily lead to the development of tolerance. Occasionally, dependency is observed in organic or psychosomatic pain states. In all three groups, typical addition behavior is rare.", 
    "4": "Autoradiographic and immunohistochemical methods were used to study the distributions of GABAA, GABAB and benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors in the pigeon fore- and midbrain. GABAA, GABAB and BDZ binding sites were found to be abundant although heterogeneously distributed in the telencephalon. The primary sensory areas of the pallium of the avian telencephalon (Wulst and dorsal ventricular ridge) tended to be low in all three binding sites, while the surrounding second order belt regions of the pallium were typically high in all three. Finally, the outermost rind of the pallium (termed the pallium externum by us), which surrounds the belt regions and projects to the striatum of the basal ganglia, was intermediate in all three GABAergic receptors types. Although both GABAA and benzodiazepine receptors were abundant within the basal ganglia, GABAA binding sites were densest in the striatum and BDZ binding sites were densest in the pallidum. Among the brainstem regions receiving GABAergic basal ganglia input, the anterior and posterior nuclei of the ansa lenticularis showed very low levels of all three receptors, while the lateral spiriform nucleus and the ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra complex contained moderate abundance of the three binding sites. The dorsalmost part of the dorsal thalamus (containing nonspecific nuclei) was rich in all three binding sites, while the more ventral part of the dorsal thalamus (containing specific sensory nuclei), the ventral thalamus and the hypothalamus were poor in all three binding sites. The pretectum was also generally poor in all three, although some nuclei displayed higher levels of one or more binding sites. The optic tectum, inferior colliculus, and central gray were rich in all three sites, while among the isthmic nuclei, the parvicellular isthmic nucleus was conspicuously rich in BDZ sites. The results show a strong correlation of the regional abundance of GABA binding sites with previously described distributions of GABAergic fibers and terminals in the avian forebrain and midbrain. The regional distribution of these binding sites is also remarkably similar to that in mammals, indicating a conservative evolution of forebrain and midbrain GABA systems among amniotes.", 
    "5": "The effect of caffeine was studied on the progress of gamma aminobutyric acid A receptor channel (GABAAR) mediated transmembrane 36Cl-flux and [3H]GABA release in native membrane vesicles from rat cerebral cortex using rapid kinetic techniques. GABA response on the second time-scale mediated by the slower desensitizing GABAAR was inactivated by 5 mM caffeine whereas subsecond GABA response retained activity. An inhibitor of caffeine-evoked GABA release, dantrolene (0.025 mM), inhibited the effect of caffeine on GABA-mediated transmembrane 36Cl- ion flux. The caffeine-evoked GABA release indicated a rise of [Ca2+]i near to completion within 0.2 s. It can be assumed that elevated [Ca2+]i during depolarization and inhibition of GABAAR with longer mean lifetime function together resulting in a disinhibition of neurotransmission.", 
    "6": "Workplace drug urinalysis protocols include an initial immunoassay followed by a confirmation gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) test of immunoassay-positive samples. (Drug categories that are commonly tested include: amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine, lysergic acid diethyl amide, methadone, methaqualone, opiates, phencyclidine, and propoxyphene. Not all drug categories are tested by all workplace drug urinalysis programs.) Only those samples that are tested positive by both the initial and the confirmatory procedures can be reported as positive. Thus, when adopting an immunoassay, one must have knowledge of the assay's cross-reacting characteristics and the assay's apparent analyze concentration that corresponds to a specific analyze concentration determined by the GC/MS procedure. The underlying principles of the commonly used radioimmunoassay, enzyme immunoassay, fluorescence polarization immunoassay, and particle immunoassay are outlined. Cross-reacting characteristics of these immunoassays as reported by the manufacturers and independent laboratories are tabulated. This information shown that commercial immunoassay kits for drug categories that are included in workplace drug urinalysis programs are generally more specific than those kits that are for clinical use only. Furthermore, recently manufactured immunoassay kits targeted for use in workplace drug urinalysis programs are more specific than those manufactured earlier. Reported effects of adulterants, such as salt, cleaning agents, etc., on commonly used immunoassays are summarized. Without more comprehensive and systematic studies, it is difficult to make general statements concerning the superiority of one methodology over the others. It is clear, however, that cannabinoid assesses are most susceptible to the influence of adulterants. Reported immunoassay-GC/MS correlation data are reviewed. Significant correlations exist in all cases. The immunoassay apparent analyze concentration corresponding to a specific GC/MS analyze concentration may be approximately based on the resulting regression equations. Since the corresponding immunoassay apparent analyze concentrations vary with the specificities of the reagent used, the immunoassay reagent manufacturers should carefully study specificity characteristics of each manufacturing batch and provide these correlation data for users' evaluation and adaptation.", 
    "7": "GABAA receptors present on rat cerebellar granule cells in culture were studied by the whole cell patch clamp technique. Muscimol appeared to be more potent than GABA itself in activating Cl(-) currents. A benzodiazepine, flunitrazepam, only slightly (10%) potentiated the GABA action.These results support the previous suggestion that GABAA receptors containing the\u03b4 subunit, such as those in the cerebellum granule cells, are potently activated by muscimol. The present results also bear out the concept that GABA action on receptors containing the\u03b4 subunit is not potentiated by benzodiazepines.", 
    "8": "Nociceptive stimuli are modulated at the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This modulation is performed by various systems working independently complementarily, additively or supra-additively. Non-opioid analgesics relieve pain without a motor blockade. In contrast to spinal opioids a reduced risk of respiratory depression is expected. In the therapy of chronic pain non-opioid analgesics may be an alternative, given alone or in combination with an opioid. Clinically relevant dosages for antinociception mediated by the alphaadrenoceptoragonistclonidine are >/=150 mug epidurally. Clonidine is effective in reducing acute and chronic pain. In combination with opioids the action of the opioids is intensified. Clonidine intensifies and prolongs the action of local anesthetics. If opioid tolerance occurs, epidural clonidine alone or in combination with an opioid has good antinociceptive action.Midazolam, a water-soluble benzodiazepine, was injected spinally for the reduction of pain for various indications (postoperative, malignancy, chronic back pain, spinal spasticity). Spinal benzodiazepine should not be injected into the spine in patients until it has been proven that there are no neurotoxic effects. Intrathecally injectedbaclofen is a well-known means of reducing spinal spasticity. Used in this way, it may have a secondary analgesic effect. No significant direct analgesic effect has so far been demonstrated. Spinalcalcitonin often leads to insufficient pain relief when given alone. Combination with an opioid may reduce the dosage of the opioid. Nausea and vomiting are frequent side effects of spinal calcitonin. Intrathecalsomatostatin produces antinociception. However, in animal studies neurotoxic action has been observed. Administration in man has not yet been proved to be safe. Spinalketamine has procluted controversial results in clinical studies, and has not yet been excluded that the substance is not neurotoxic.Lysine acetylsalicylic acid (L-ASA) has been given intrathecally for the therapy of severe cancer pain and chronic back pain. In most patients good analgesia was observed up to 2 months after a single injection. If neurotoxity can be excluded, L-ASA may be an alternative in the therapy of cancer pain before neurodestructive therapy is done.", 
    "9": "Rats were trained to discriminate nicotine (0.4mg/kg s.c.), midazolam (0.2mg/kg s.c.) or the combination of these drugs from saline (n = 10). The rats were trained to 95% accuracy in a two-bar operant procedure with a tandem schedule of food reinforcement. Testing with the individual drugs in the mixture-trained group showed that nicotine (85% drug-appropriate responding) was a more salient component than midazolam (47%) in the compound stimulus. The rats were tested with benzodiazepine and nicotine antagonists individually and in combination (mecamylamine 0.2-1.6mg/kg s.c.; flumazenil 2.5-20mg/kg i.p.). Results for the mixture-trained animals showed that flumazenil had no effect on its own, however mecamylamine on its own produced a significant but incomplete block in doses of 0.4-1.6mg/kg. The greater salience of the nicotine component of the cue would explain the block by mecamylamine but not flumazenil. The antagonists in combination produced greater blockade than mecamylamine on its own. The selectivity of the antagonist actions on the different cue components was also demonstrated. The results suggest that in drug discrimination experiments, \"false negative\" results may be obtained with antagonists when a training drug produces a stimulus with more than one component.", 
    "10": "Six healthy human volunteers (ages 18 to 24) acquired a triazolam (0.32mg/70kg) vs placebo discrimination under a standard, two-response drug discrimination procedure. Dose-effect curves were then determined for triazolam (0.1-0.56mg/70kg), lorazepam (0.75-3.0mg/70kg) and buspirone (7.5-30mg/70kg) under a novel response procedure that provided a response alternative for drugs unlike triazolam or placebo (i.e. a novel-appropriate response). Triazolam dose-dependently increased triazolam-appropriate responding but did not occasion any novel-appropriate responding. Lorazepam dose-dependently increased triazolam-appropriate responding in four of six subjects, but at least one dose also occasioned novel-appropriate responding in three subjects. Buspirone dose-dependently increased novel-appropriate responding, although three of six subjects also made triazolam-appropriate responses following some dose(s). All three drugs comparably increased self-reported sedation. Self-reported effects did not differentiate triazolam from lorazepam whereas only buspirone increased \"bad\" self-reports, and did not increase \"liking\" and \"good\" self-reports. The results suggest that the novel response procedure enhanced the pharmacological selectivity of human benzodiazepine discrimination and may help interpret partial generalization under two-choice drug discrimination procedures. The results also add to the evidence of a close relationship between the discriminative stimulus and self-reported effects of drugs.", 
    "11": "The widespread use of benzodiazepines and caffeine makes their combined use inevitable. The purpose of the present experiment was to assess the acute effects of lorazepam (0,2.8 and 5.6mg/70kg) and caffeine (0, 250 and 500mg/70kg), alone and in combination, on human learning, performance and self-reports. Subjects were nine healthy, male volunteers. Subjects received all possible combinations according to a Latin Square design. Lorazepam administered alone dose-dependently disrupted learning and performance on the Repeated Acquisition and Performance procedure and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and increased subject ratings of sedation. Caffeine administered alone did not affect learning, performance or subject ratings to a statistically significant degree. Caffeine attenuated lorazepam-induced decrements in learning and performance on the Repeated Acquisition and Performance procedure and DSST. Consistent with the learning and performance measures, caffeine offset lorazepam-induced increases in subject ratings of sedation. These results demonstrate that caffeine generally attenuates the behavioral and self-reported effects of lorazepam on a variety of performance measures. An important extension of these findings would be to test the combined effects of lorazepam and caffeine in other behavioral paradigms such as drug self-administration.",

    "13": "The present study was designed to investigate the efficacy of clonazepam in neuroleptic-induced akathisia. Twelve patients were treated during 2 weeks with clonazepam or placebo in a double-blind randomized design. Akathisia was scored by an independent rater before and after treatment, as well as 1 week after medication withdrawal. Clonazepam (0.5-2.5 mg/day) induced a significantly higher reduction in the akathisia scores than placebo (p < 0.05). One week after stopping the drug, there was a partial but significant relapse in the treated group as compared with controls, in whom the symptoms remained stable. In addition, the clinical improvement was significantly correlated with the daily dose of clonazepam (rs = 0.827; p < 0.002). These results support the potential usefulness of clonazepam in the treatment of neuroleptic-induced akathisia and suggest an optimal daily dose in the range of 10-40 micrograms/kg.", 
    "14": "The central benzodiazepine binding site mediates the therapeutically relevant pharmacologic actions of benzodiazepine agonists, including reducing anxiety, sedation, muscle relaxation, and antagonism of seizure production. Benzodiazepines potentiate the ability of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to promote membrane chloride ion conductance by binding reversibly to a distinct site on the GABAA receptor complex. Although the role of this central benzodiazepine binding site in mediating the pharmacologic actions of benzodiazepine agonists has been shown conclusively, its participation in an animal's response to stress is less certain. Data are reviewed consistent with an environmental stress-induced modification of the structure and function of the central benzodiazepine binding site. Modifications show brain anatomic regional selectivity. The mechanisms of these modifications include rapid enzyme-mediated phosphorylations of the GABAA receptor complex and the selective transcription of individual polypeptide subunits. The potential relevance of the data on environmental stress-induced functional modifications of the central benzodiazepine binding site to the development of newer medications and improved understanding of the pathophysiology of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders is discussed.", 
    "15": "The benzodiazepines are a family of anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs. When taken concurrently with ethanol, a pharmacological interaction may occur, potentiating the central nervous system depression produced by either drug. In addition to this pharmacological interaction, this report describes a novel chemical reaction between temazepam (a 3-hydroxy-1,4-benzodiazepine) and ethanol under acidic conditions similar to those found in vivo, resulting in a 3-ethoxylated product. Optimal conditions, kinetics, equilibrium, and the mechanism of this acid-catalyzed ethanolysis are reported. The results raise the possibility that the ethanolysis reaction may occur in the stomach of people who consume alcohol and 3-hydroxy-1,4-benzodiazepine on a regular basis. The acid-catalyzed ethanol-drug reaction is a relatively unexplored area and may alter the pharmacological action of some drugs.",

At the request of the Home Office, manufacturers have developed solid dose forms to replace the liquid filled capsules, but a number of cases of accidental intra-arterial injection of the new formulation have been reported, with varying management strategies advocated. A case is presented where prompt aggressive management using surgical and pharmacological measures resulted in complete limb salvage. Previous reported cases and management options are discussed.", 
    "17": "The ability of mammals to measure seasonal changes in daylength depends upon a circadian clock and the phase-relationship between this clock and the light: dark cycle. Recently, a number of pharmacological and nonpharmacological stimuli have been shown to have pronounced effects on the phase of the circadian clock of rodents. The objective of the present study was to determine if a drug-induced change in the phase-relationship between a measurable circadian rhythm (i.e., wheel running behavior) and the light:dark cycle would alter the effects of the light cycle on the neuroendocrine-gonadal axis. Adult male hamsters with regressed testes due to exposure to an inhibitory 10:14-hr light:dark cycle were daily injected with vehicle or the short-acting benzodiazepine, triazolam, while remaining on short days, while a control group of hamsters was transferred to a photostimulatory 14:10-hr light:dark cycle. Two other groups of hamsters with regressed testes were blinded and daily injected with vehicle or triazolam. The injections were timed to occur about 4 hr before activity onset because previous studies had demonstrated that injections of triazolam at this time can lead to a phase advance in the activity rhythm. The circadian rhythm of wheel running behavior was measured in all the animals maintained on the 10:14-hr light:dark cycle in order to monitor circadian phase. While no testicular growth was observed after 25 days of vehicle injections, growth was observed in the triazolam-treated animals that was comparable to that observed in control animals transferred to long days. Testicular growth in triazolam-treated animals was associated with an earlier onset of locomotor activity, when compared with the vehicle-treated animals. Importantly, triazolam had no effect on the testicular size of blind animals. These results indicate that daily injections of triazolam can stimulate neuroendocrine-gonadal activity by altering the phase-relationship between the cycle and the circadian clock involved in photoperiodic time measurement, and that agents which can affect the clock may be useful in altering seasonal cycles.",

The antagonism produced by FK480 was competitive in nature because intraduodenal as well as intravenous infusion of FK480 (50-250 nmol/kg/hr) caused a parallel rightward shift of the entire dose-response curve for cerulein-stimulated pancreatic exocrine secretion without altering the maximal increase. The magnitude of the shift was proportional to the dose of FK480. The mean pA2 and ID50 values of intravenously administered FK480 were 8.2 and 24 nmol/kg/hr, respectively, and those of intraduodenally infused FK480 were 7.7 and 168 nmol/kg/hr, respectively. Thus, FK480 given by the intravenous route was about sevenfold more potent than that given by the oral route. The antagonistic effects produced by intravenous FK480 were specific for CCK receptor in that the stimulatory effects of cerulein were inhibited whereas those of bombesin and secretin were not altered. In addition, intravenous administration of 50 nmol/kg/hr FK480 completely suppressed pancreatic exocrine secretion in response to intraduodenal infusion of 10% casein (400 mg/hr). FK480 was active as a CCK receptor antagonist for more than 12 hr because oral administration of FK480 (1.0 mg/kg) had significant inhibitory effects even after 12 hr on cerulein-stimulated pancreatic exocrine secretion. These results indicate that FK480 is a potent, competitive, and specific CCK receptor antagonist on the exocrine pancreas in vivo, having oral bioavailability and a long biological half-life.",

To determine whether diabetes- and diuresis-induced alterations in muscarinic receptors in rat bladder dome are reversible, we administered insulin (beginning 8 weeks after the onset of diabetes) or removed sucrose from drinking water of diuretic rats (beginning 8 weeks after the onset of diuresis). Five groups of rats were maintained for 16 weeks: 1) STZ-induced diabetic rats (65 mg/kg intravenously); 2) insulin-treated diabetic rats (5-8 U/day insulin subcutaneously beginning 8 weeks after the onset of diabetes); 3) sucrose-fed diuretic rats (5% sucrose in drinking water throughout 16 weeks); 4) sucrose-removed rats (sucrose withdrawn from drinking water after 8 weeks of the sucrose-induced diuretic state); and 5) age-matched control rats. Radioligand receptor binding experiments with [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate showed an increase in the density of muscarinic receptors in bladder dome of diabetic and sucrose-fed rats compared with age-matched control rats.

    "43": "Benzodiazepines, a class of drugs widely used as anxiolytics, can induce a depression of respiration. This study was designed to determine if endogenous benzodiazepine ligands could act in a similar fashion and exert a tonic inhibitory influence on respiration. Administration of a benzodiazepine antagonist should then facilitate respiration. This might be especially visible in hypoxia, the condition characterized by both central respiratory depression and potentially enhanced benzodiazepine expression. We addressed this issue by comparing the effects on the phrenic neurogram of the specific benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (200 micrograms i.v. boluses) in the contrasting conditions of hypoxia and hyperoxia in anesthetized, both spontaneously breathing and paralyzed ventilated cats. Contrary to our hypothesis, flumazenil showed a modest but definite inhibitory effect on respiration. Flumazenil also lengthened the duration of the Hering-Breuer inspiratory inhibition. The respiratory depression was neither related to chemical drive nor to the GABA receptor complex, for it was sustained after antagonism of GABA with picrotoxin and bicuculline. We conclude that the endogenous benzodiazepine system is unlikely to play an inhibitory role in the regulation of respiration. The physiologic role of this system remains to be established.", 
    "44": "The effect of diazepam on the trade-off function between current and frequency for stimulation-induced feeding was evaluated in five rats with electrodes implanted in medial forebrain bundle structures. Three of the five exhibited stimulation-induced feeding (SIF) in vehicle tests, while in the remaining two attention to food was interspersed with periods of high activity. In all cases diazepam facilitated stimulation-induced feeding; the expression of stimulation-induced feeding was observed at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg and 5.0 mg/kg, where tested, and frequency threshold shifts ranged from 10% to 25%. The degree of facilitation was consistent across currents in two of the four pairs of trade-off functions examined. The results suggest that diazepam can facilitate stimulation-induced feeding and its expression in feeding sites with a competing arousal component.", 
    "45": "To clarify experimentally which of benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor or regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) imaging is more sensitive in the detection of epileptic foci, we simultaneously examined the BZ receptor and rCBF distribution changes in hippocampal kindled rabbits with in vivo double tracer autoradiography using 125I-labeled Ro 16-0154 (125I-Iomazenil) and 99mTc-labeled hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO). In visual analysis of brain slices extracted after the intravenous injection of the double tracer following the kindling completion, 125I-Iomazenil accumulation was more markedly and extensively decreased in the kindled right CA1 region mimicking a primary epileptic focus than 99mTc-HMPAO accumulation. Further, this decrease in 125I-Iomazenil accumulation was not due to neuropathological abnormalities which consisted only of tissue damage corresponding to electrode track in the right CA1. These results suggest that BZ receptor imaging is more sensitive in the detection of epileptic foci than rCBF imaging and, therefore, that BZ receptor imaging is useful in clinical epilepsy.", 
    "46": "The effects of acute and chronic IP injections of diazepam on the guinea pig righting reflex latency (RRL) were measured using an automated measurement system known as a \"tolerometer.\" Single IP injections of 2.0, 6.0, 18.0, and 20.0 mg/kg diazepam significantly increased the RRL compared to no injection (naive animals), diazepam vehicle injections, or 1.0 mg/kg diazepam injections. The effects of chronic IP injection schedules on the RRL were compared: 18 or 20 mg/kg in a single, once daily injection for 5 days; 6 mg/kg in a single, once daily injection for 5 days; and 6 mg/kg, three times a day, for 5 days. Neither 20, 18, nor 6 mg/kg/day for 5 days resulted in significant tolerance to the depressive effects of diazepam on the righting reflex. By contrast, when 6 mg/kg was administered three times a day for 5 days, tolerance developed by the third day of treatment. There were no differences between the three groups in the amount of exposure to the measurement apparatus or the testing situation. These results support the view that species like guinea pig and rat that metabolise diazepam rapidly, develop tolerance more quickly if diazepam is administered in divided doses or by continuous release; this may be because the duration of the occupation of CNS benzodiazepine recognition sites is a critical factor in the development of tolerance.", 
    "47": "The effect of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) antagonist alpha-helical CRF9-41 (alpha H CRF9-41; 25 and 50 micrograms) was examined in four strains of mice (BALB/C, NIH Swiss, CF-1, and CD) in the elevated plus-maze anxiolytic test and found to significantly increase percent open arm activity in only the BALB/C mice. A marginal anxiolytic response was obtained in NIH Swiss, while no effect of the antagonist was noted in CF-1 or CD mice in this test. Diazepam (1-4 mg/kg IP) significantly increased percent open arm activity in all four mouse strains. Thus, all strains were sensitive to the effects of a known anxiolytic in this test. The locomotor-suppressing effect of the agonist CRF was assessed in the four strains of mice. While CRF suppressed locomotor activity in each of the strains, the peptide was more efficacious and more potent in the BALB/C strain than in any of the other three strains. The behavioral differences in responsiveness to CRF and the antagonist alpha H CRF9-41 could not be explained on the basis of differential binding of CRF to forebrain membranes in the four mouse strains. These data suggest that the BALB/C mouse is more sensitive to the behavioral effects of CRF and its antagonist than other strains and may be a useful strain for examining the effects of CRF and/or stress.", 
    "48": "The cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist MK-329 (previously L-364,718) was administered intraperitoneally to free-feeding broiler chickens and tested for conditioning effects using the colored food paradigm. The 8.0, 16.0, and 32.0 micrograms/kg doses of MK-329 did not exert any effect on food intake and failed to condition a color preference or aversion. When higher doses were used (90, 180, and 360 micrograms/kg) MK-329 caused a significant increase in food intake during the 2-h test period. Intravenously injected MK-329 (70, 140, and 280 micrograms/kg) produced an increase in food intake, with maximum increases occurring at a dose of 70 micrograms/kg. CCK (14 micrograms/kg) caused a reduction in feeding, and this effect was not blocked by pretreatment with intraperitoneal injection of MK-329 (32, 90, 180, and 360 micrograms/kg). The results question the role of endogenous CCK in satiety in chickens.", 
    "49": "The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the full benzodiazepine (BDZ) agonist chlordiazepoxide (CDAP) and the partial BDZ agonist bretazenil would produce acute dependence in rats, as evidenced by disruptions in fixed-interval responding during precipitated abstinence withdrawal. Doses of CDAP and bretazenil administered acutely were 10, 75, and 100 mg/kg; flumazenil (1-56 mg/kg) was administered 1, 2, 4, or 18 h later. Withdrawal, defined as a significant decrease in fixed-interval responding, was only seen when a high dose of flumazenil was administered 18 h after 100 mg/kg of CDAP. These results support those of others (5) who found that high (75-450 mg/kg) doses of CDAP were required to produce acute physical dependence. That bretazenil did not produce acute physical dependence supports the findings of others (20,23) who report that chronic administration of bretazenil does not result in physical dependence.", 
    "50": "Previously we have shown that intrathecal administration of midazolam can increase or decrease morphine-induced antinociception, depending upon relative concentration of these drugs by modulating spinal opioid receptors, and it also can inhibit morphine-induced tolerance and dependence in the rat. Now we report that midazolam also influences catalepsy, lethality, and analgesia induced by morphine in the rat. In the acute treatment, animals were first treated with saline or midazolam (0.03 to 30.0 mg/kg, b.wt., IP), and 30 min later with a second injection of saline or morphine (1.0 to 100.0 mg/kg, b.wt., SC). The catalepsy was measured 60 min after the second injection and lethality was checked after 24 h. Midazolam injection increased the morphine-induced catalepsy and lethality. In the chronic treatment, animals were injected with two injections daily for 11 days. The first injection consisted of saline or midazolam (0.03 to 3.0 mg/kg, b.wt., IP), and 30 min later with a second injection of saline or morphine (10.0 mg/kg, b.wt., IP) was given. Lethality, antinociception, and body weight were measured. Chronic morphine treatment also increased lethality in a dose-dependent manner. Chronic treatment with midazolam and morphine increased the antinociception on day 11, as measured in the tail-flick and hot-plate tests. Midazolam administration also prevented the morphine-induced weight loss. These results suggest a strong interaction between midazolam and morphine in altering catalepsy, lethality, and analgesia in rat.", 
    "51": "Two patients developed seizure immediately after flumazenil administration that aimed to reverse the prolonged sedative effect of diazepam. The use of benzodiazepine for sedation in ICU may mask valuable information relevant to an ongoing pathological change. The seizure in our patients seemed most likely to result from septic encephalopathy which was unmasked by flumazenil. However, flumazenil has the potential to provoke seizure and should be used with caution.",

The children were most commonly 1 to 3 years of age (66.2%), especially between 13 to 24 months. Benzodiazepines, pesticides and coins were the most common causes in drug, household material and foreign body groups, respectively. Sixty-two percent of cases had symptoms, and the major presentations occurred in central nervous system. Ninety-two percent of non-traumatic injuries happened at home, and ninety-two percent of the events were accidental. Approximately thirty percent of patients needed hospitalization.

    "56": "1. A retrospective analysis of 352 consecutive cases of fatal substance overdose that occurred in the Lothian and Borders region of Scotland (LBRS) between 1983 and 1992 (inclusive) is presented. All these cases were subjected to a full forensic autopsy with histological and toxicological studies. 2. The overall male:female ratio is 1.2:1. Males significantly predominate (1.9:1) in the 21-30 year age group, but females significantly predominate (0.7-0.9:1) above the age of 50 years (P < 0.001). A significant progressive alteration in the sex ratio is noted: from 0.7:1 in 1988 to 2.4:1 in 1992 (P < 0.001). 3. Analgesics account for 43.2% of all overdose deaths with narcotic analgesics representing 32.4%. Dextropropoxyphene is the commonest (38.2%) narcotic analgesic and fatal overdoses on it have been increasing since 1989; methadone deaths also showed an increase. Death from heroin overdose fell sharply in 1985. 4. Antidepressants account for 20.2% of deaths (tricyclics representing 19.3%): Amitriptyline is the commonest (75.0%) tricyclic and its use, particularly by female suicides, has been increasing since 1989. Barbiturate poisoning has declined considerably since 1986. 5. Temazepam comprises 65.4% of all benzodiazepines overdose deaths; two-thirds of fatal benzodiazepine abuse involve males. 6. This study once more emphasises that physicians, and especially general practitioners, must prescribe cautiously for their patients. Control through legislation of the sale of non-narcotic analgesics is worth serious consideration.", 
    "57": "Development of depression in patients with organ transplants is accompanied by an increased incidence of suicide attempts. A 60-year-old man with chronic polycystic renal disease underwent a kidney transplant 2 years previously. Six months prior to admission, the patient had been medicated for depression. This course was complicated by noncompliance and worsening family problems. One morning, the patient was found unconscious, along with a suicide note and empty bottles of cyclosporine (CsA), imipramine (IP), meticorten, azathioprine, oxazepam, alprazolam, and fluoxetin, approximately 24 h after the presumed intake of these agents. Initial plasma IP level was 2260 ng/ml, whole blood total cyclosporine (T-CsA) concentration was 1,800 ng/ml and that of specific cyclosporine (Sp-CsA), 714 ng/ml. Urine toxic screening was positive also for benzodiazepines metabolites. IP and CsA blood levels were measured daily. Five days after overdose, the IP concentration was 232 ng/ml, that of T-CsA 401 ng/ml, and that of Sp-CsA 96 ng/ml. Compared to subjects on therapeutic doses, a significant prolongation of the half-life, t 1/2, was observed for both IP (t1/2, 43.4 h) and Sp-CsA (t1/2, 70.1 h). In the present case, prolonged elevated IP plasma levels were not associated with cardiovascular complications. On the 5th hospital day, after the patient had apparently recovered from the intoxication, he jumped from the 8th floor to his death.",

We studied our experience of 107 episodes of status epilepticus in 43 patients over a 5-year period. Overall mortality was 2% and permanent sequelae developed in 11 cases (10%). Although hospital admission was rapid, treatment could be initiated more quickly in the community (P < 0.0001). However treatment given before admission did not significantly reduce the duration of status (median difference 38 minutes, 95% C.I., 24 to 55 minutes). Diazepam was the first line treatment in 98 episodes, chlormethiazole and phenytoin were used in 27 and 18 episodes, respectively. Paraldehyde was used in 12 episodes. Midazolam was used in the intensive care setting in two cases. Clonazepam, lorazepam, lignocaine and phenobarbitone were not used at all. There was a marked failure to adhere to the recommended management protocols.", 
    "59": "Complexes made up of the kinases, hexokinase and glycerol kinase, together with the outer mitochondrial membrane voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) protein, porin, and the inner mitochondrial membrane protein, the adenine nucleotide translocator, are involved in tumorigenesis, diabetes mellitus, and central nervous system function. Identification of these two mitochondrial membrane proteins, along with an 18 kD protein, as components of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, provides independent confirmation of the interaction of porin and the adenine nucleotide translocator to form functional contact sites between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. We suggest that these are dynamic structures, with channel conductances altered by the presence of ATP, and that ligand-mediated conformational changes in the porin-adenine nucleotide translocator complexes may be a general mechanism in signal transduction.", 
    "60": "Social phobia, though the third most common psychiatric disorder in the United States, has received little systematic attention until recently. Chronic and disabling symptoms usually precede other disorders in individuals with comorbidity, including alcohol abuse. Though about 80% of individuals do not seek treatment, controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy for several medications, of which phenelzine (an irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor [MAOI]) is the best studied. The benzodiazepines, clonazepam and alprazolam, also hold promise. New reversible MAOIs such as moclobemide and brofaromine are under investigation; fluoxetine and other serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors need further controlled study. The benefits of group cognitive-behavioral therapy also appear substantial. Issues for future investigation include long-term outcome, differential therapeutics, diagnostic subtyping, and combination treatments.",

Without intervention, it is unlikely that patients will attain significant relief from the symptoms and disability associated with the disease. The authors review the results of studies concerning the use of high-potency benzodiazepines in the treatment of social phobia. These studies, which include open trials as well as a double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of clonazepam, have demonstrated clinical efficacy and suggest a therapeutic role for this drug class in the treatment of social phobia. Developmental work with the Davidson Brief Social Phobia Scale is described, along with predictors of treatment outcome for clonazepam and placebo and relapse data upon discontinuation of both treatments. Finally, the authors discuss general issues concerning the relapse of patients upon drug discontinuation, the long-term use of benzodiazepines, and other important issues concerning the use of these agents for the treatment of social phobia.", 
    "62": "1. We have compared the binding properties of several hexocyclium and sila-hexocyclium derivatives to muscarinic M1 receptors (in rat brain, human neuroblastoma (NB-OK 1) cells and calf superior cervical ganglia), rat heart M2 receptors, rat pancreas M3 receptors and M4 receptors in rat striatum, with their functional antimuscarinic properties in rabbit vas deferens (M1/M4-like), guinea-pig atria (M2), and guinea-pig ileum (M3) muscarinic receptors. 2. Sila-substitution (C/Si exchange) of hexocyclium (-->sila-hexocyclium) and demethyl-hexocyclium (-->demethyl-sila-hexocyclium) did not significantly affect their affinities for muscarinic receptors. By contrast, sila-substitution of o-methoxy-hexocyclium increased its affinity 2 to 3 fold for all the muscarinic receptor subtypes studied. 3. The p-fluoro- and p-chloro-derivatives of sila-hexocyclium had lower affinities than the parent compound at the four receptor subtypes, in binding and pharmacological studies. 4. In binding studies, o-methoxy-sila-hexocyclium (M1 = M4 > or = M3 > or = M2) had a much lower affinity than sila-hexocyclium for the four receptor subtypes, and discriminated the receptor subtypes more poorly than sila-hexocyclium (M1 = M3 > M4 > M2). This is in marked contrast with the very clear selectivity of o-methoxy-sila-hexocyclium for the prejunctional M1/M4-like heteroreceptors in rabbit vas deferens. 5. The tertiary amines demethyl-hexocyclium, demethyl-sila-hexocyclium and demethyl-o-methoxy-sila-hexocyclium had 10 to 30 fold lower affinities than the corresponding quaternary ammonium derivatives.", 
    "63": "1. The effects of benzodiazepines on cholecystokinin (CCK) responses produced following activation of CCKB receptors by pentagastrin in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) or CCKA receptors by CCK-8S in the dorsal raphe of the rat brain in vitro have been investigated. 2. The benzodiazepine agonist, flurazepam, at high concentrations, blocked pentagastrin-induced excitations in the rat VMH yielding an equilibrium constant (Ke) value of 12.5 microM. 3. In the rat dorsal raphe, where activation of CCKA receptors leads to neuronal depolarization, flurazepam also produced a weak block of the CCK response. 4. Flurazepam blocked CCK responses but not carbachol-induced excitations of VMH neurones. The inhibition of CCK responses by flurazepam was not blocked by the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil. 5. These data suggest that flurazepam is a weak antagonist at central CCKB receptors. 6. At central CCKA receptors, flurazepam blocked CCK-8S responses but the inhibition was not competitive, with a reduction in the peak CCK-8S obtainable in the presence of flurazepam. These results suggest that flurazepam acts at a site other than the CCKA receptor itself to block CCK responses in the dorsal raphe.", 
    "64": "A 43 year old female with previously undiagnosed myotonic dystrophy received abdominal hysterectomy under spinal anesthesia. Respiratory arrest occurred when diazepam 5 mg was slowly administered intravenously during operation. Mask ventilation was continued during operation with nitrous oxide and pentazocine 30 mg i.v. After the operation ventilatory failure continued. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH; 7.21, Pao2; 57 mmHg, Paco2; 82 mmHg in spite of oxygen therapy by a face mask. For 5 days after the operation, oxygen therapy was necessary. The patient was diagnosed as myotonic dystrophy by further examination after the operation. In a patient with myotonic dystrophy, we should be very careful in administering a drug which may cause respiratory depression to prevent respiratory complication.", 
    "65": "Midazolam has a slow onset of action, while thiamylal causes pain on injection and circulatory changes. To compensate for these drawbacks, the usefulness of a combination of midazolam and thiamylal in anesthesia induction was studied. The combination method was compared to the induction with single use of thiamylal in 40 patients (20 patients in each group). The combination of 0.2 mg.kg-1 of midazolam and 1.9 mg.kg-1 of thiamylal showed a shorter onset of action than the 4-5 mg.kg-1 of thiamylal. Pain on injection was observed in 5 cases of thiamylal group but in no cases of combination group. The changes in blood pressure, heart rate and rate pressure product were obviously smaller in combination group than in thiamylal group. Although the recovery time from anesthesia of combination group (13.2 minutes) was longer than that of thiamylal group (10.5 minutes), this was not clinically important. It is concluded that anesthesia induction with the combination of midazolam 0.2 mg.kg-1 and thiamylal 1.9 mg.kg-1 is more useful than that of thiamylal alone.", 
    "66": "Selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) is a neurosurgical procedure used for treating lower extremity spasticity in patients with cerebral palsy. The purpose of this paper is to present a review of our institution's first three years' experience with postoperative pain and spasticity management in patients who have undergone SDR. The medical records of the 55 patients who had an SDR during the study period were reviewed. The basis of postoperative analgesia was morphine, with the majority of patients receiving continuous morphine infusions (20-40 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1 (n = 49), 60 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1 (n = 1)). Four patients used a patient-controlled delivery system. One patient had successful analgesia with epidural morphine. Ketorolac (1 mg.kg-1 i.v. loading dose followed by 0.5 mg.kg-1 i.v. every six hr for 48 hr) was used as an adjunct to morphine in six patients. For management of postoperative muscle spasm, an intravenous benzodiazepine was used (diazepam 0.1 mg.kg-1 (n = 2), or midazolam infusion 10-30 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1 (n = 51)). All patients were cared for on a ward where nurses were familiar with the use of continuous opioid and benzodiazepine infusions. All patients received continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring as well as frequent nursing assessment. There were no episodes of postoperative apnoea or excessive sedation. We have found the use of continuous infusions of morphine and midazolam, along with adjunct ketorolac, to be effective in treating postoperative pain and muscle spasms following SDR.", 
    "67": "Midazolam was given for sedation as an initial bolus, followed by either a continuous infusion or a patient controlled infusion during third molar extractions. The results showed that there were no significant changes in blood pressure, pulse rate or oxygen saturation during the procedure. Both methods gave good amnesia to events at the start, (100%), as well as to events during, (70% and 75%), and at the end, (61% and 70%), of surgery. There was high acceptance of both methods of sedation (93% and 98% respectively). There was no patient preference for either method of sedation, nor was the operator able to distinguish between the two methods. Hence it is concluded that patient controlled infusion and continuous infusion of midazolam are both satisfactory methods of sedation for patients undergoing surgery under local anaesthesia.",

FK 480 increased the level of CCK mRNA in the intestine to 1.7 times the level in control rats, but did not affect the level of secretin mRNA. It did not increase plasma CCK immunoreactivity or CCK content in the intestinal mucosa. These results suggest that the ingested FK 480 directly increased CCK mRNA level in the intestine and produced a dissociation between the synthesis and release of CCK.", 
    "73": "It is hypothesized that because of its potential to increase coronary flow and simultaneously decrease myocardial performance and O2 consumption, midazolam would minimize regional metabolic impairment during myocardial ischemia. Therefore, the hemodynamic and regional metabolic effects of systemic midazolam administration were compared during moderate and severe constrictions of the left anterior descending artery (LADa) to nontreated but ischemic animals in a canine model of acute coronary occlusion. In 16 anesthetized, ventilated, surgically prepared, and catheterized dogs, resting flow in the LADa was decreased by 50% and 75% for 15 minutes with 1 hour of normal flow in between. By arbitrary assignment, 7 dogs received midazolam (0.3 mg/kg and then 0.05 mg/kg/min) before thoracotomy. In all dogs, heart rate, electrocardiogram, LADa flow, left ventricular (LV) first time-derivative, and aortic, pulmonary artery, LADa, and LV pressures were measured continuously. Before and during constrictions, cardiac output by thermodilution and regional myocardial blood flow by microspheres were measured and blood was sampled for analysis. Data (mean +/- SEM) were compared within and between groups using ANOVA. Before placement of the LADa ligature, midazolam decreased heart rate and mean aortic pressure. Before ischemia, heart rate and LADa pressure were lower with midazolam than without it, but baseline metabolic variables were similar between the two groups (except for O2 consumption in the ischemic zone, which was lower with midazolam than without it). During 75% constriction with midazolam, LV end-diastolic pressure, coronary resistance, and ischemic zone O2 consumption were lower than without midazolam. Ischemic zone O2 delivery/consumption ratio was higher.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "74": "Twenty-three informed and consenting patients scheduled for CABG were anesthetized using computer-controlled infusions of alfentanil, midazolam, and pancuronium. Thirteen middle-aged patients received a preprogrammed infusion scheme of alfentanil, simulated using the population pharmacokinetic set of Maitre et al (Group M), and 10 elderly patients received a preprogrammed infusion scheme simulated using the model of Helmers et al (Group H). The target alfentanil concentrations in groups M and H for tracheal intubation were: 300-500 ng/mL and for sternotomy: 500-700 ng/mL. Blood alfentanil concentrations were measured at tracheal intubation, skin incision, sternotomy, and aortic cannulation. The bias, inaccuracy, and precision of each pharmacokinetic set were assessed by the median performance error (MDPE), the median absolute performance error (MDAPE), and the 10th and 90th percentiles of the performance errors (P10, P90), respectively. The predictive accuracy of seven other alfentanil pharmacokinetic sets selected from the literature was also evaluated retrospectively. The measured alfentanil concentrations were underpredicted when using all the pharmacokinetic sets, except the set of Scott et al (MDPE: -15.9%). The sets of Maitre et al and Helmers et al were found not to be accurate (MDAPE > 40%) in both groups M and H. The set of Scott et al with the lowest clearance (2.4 mL/kg/min) shows the best accuracy (MDAPE: 19.5%) and precision (P10: -40%, P90: 16%). In conclusion, the set of Scott et al should preferably be selected to predict prebypass alfentanil infusion accurately in either middle aged or elderly patients who have normal myocardial function (LVEF > 50%) and are scheduled for CABG.", 
    "75": "Even though the measurement of transitory evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) is easy and without problems in babies, sedation might be necessary in children aged between 1 and 4 years. As only very little information is available on the influence of a sedation on the TEOAE, the present study was performed. 35 normal hearing patients who were treated with benzodiazepines as a premedication for an operation were included in the investigation. 15 patients received diazepam and 20 were given flunitrazepam in a dosage of 10 and 1 mg respectively. The TEOAE were measured using the ILO 88 system by Bray and Kemp 1 day before, 1 hour after and 3 days after drug intake. 10 additional subjects of whom measurements were taken at the same time intervals served as controls. No statistically significant changes could be detected before and after drug treatment in respect of amplitudes of the TEOAE and frequency of maximum amplitudes. Hence, we conclude that sedation as used in this study must be considered negligible when measuring TEOAE.",

    "77": "In adrenal cortex and other steroidogenic tissues including glial cells, the conversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone is catalyzed by the cytochrome P450scc located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. A complex mechanism operative in regulating cholesterol access to P450scc limits the rate of pregnenolone biosynthesis. Participating in this mechanism are DBI (diazepam binding inhibitor), an endogenous peptide that is highly expressed in steroidogenic cells and some of the DBI processing products including DBI 17-50 (TTN). DBI and TTN activate steroidogenesis by binding to a specific receptor located in the outer mitochondrial membrane, termed mitochondrial DBI receptor complex (MDRC). MDRC is a hetero-oligomeric protein: only the subunit that includes the DBI and benzodiazepine (BZD) recognition sites has been cloned. Several 2-aryl-3-indoleacetamide derivatives (FGIN-1-X) with highly selective affinity (nM) for MDRC were synthesized which can stimulate steroidogenesis in mitochondrial preparations. These compounds stimulate adrenal cortex steroidogenesis in hypophysectomized rats but not in intact animals. Moreover, this steroidogenesis is inhibited by the isoquinoline carboxamide derivative PK 11195, a specific high affinity ligand for MDRC with a low intrinsic steroidogenic activity. Some of the FGIN-1-X derivatives stimulate brain pregnenolone accumulation in adrenalectomized-castrated rats. The FGIN-1-X derivatives that increase brain pregnenolone content, elicit antineophobic activity and antagonize punished behavior in the Vogel conflict test in rats. These actions of FGIN-1-X are resistant to inhibition by flumazenil, a specific inhibitor of BZD action in GABAA receptors but are antagonized by PK 11195, a specific blocker of the steroidogenesis activation via MDRC stimulation. It is postulated that the pharmacological action of FGIN-1-X depends on a positive modulation of the GABA action on GABAA receptors mediated by the stimulation of brain neurosteroid production.", 
    "78": "In 30 female patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy, we have compared the anxiolytic effect of diazepam 10 mg with placebo, using measurements of cardiovascular (arterial pressure and heart rate), biochemical (plasma concentrations of noradrenaline, adrenaline, cortisol and dopamine beta-hydroxylase), subjective (visual analogue scale) and behavioural (Hamilton anxiety test) variables. Pretreatment evaluation was carried out the day before surgery and post-treatment examination was performed 1.5-2 h after oral administration of premedication, immediately before transfer of patients to the operating room. We found that diazepam 10 mg had no significant effect on any of the measured variables.", 
    "79": "Antibodies specific for the gamma 1, gamma 2, and gamma 3 subunits of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor have been used to probe the composition of naturally occurring GABAA receptors in the rat brain. Most GABAA receptors contain at least one of these three subunits. The percentage of each, determined by immunoprecipitation of [3H]muscimol binding, was 11 +/- 1%, 59 +/- 3%, and 14 +/- 2% for gamma 1, gamma 2, and gamma 3 subunits, respectively. Receptors containing gamma 2 or gamma 3 subunits were labeled by benzodiazepine site ligands with high affinity, whereas gamma 1-containing receptors could be labeled only by [3H]muscimol. Receptors immunoprecipitated by anti-gamma 2 or anti-gamma 3 antibodies were labeled with [3H]Ro 15-1788 with similar affinities (Kd for anti-gamma 2-immunoprecipitated receptors, 1.9 nM; Kd for anti-gamma 3-immunoprecipitated receptors, 1.7 nM). Immunoprecipitation or Western blot analysis of GABAA receptors solubilized from rat cerebellar or whole-brain preparations indicated that gamma 1 was not present coassembled with any other gamma subunit. Western blot analysis of receptors purified on alpha-specific immunoaffinity resins showed that gamma 1 was predominantly assembled with the alpha 2 subunit. Some GABAA receptors may contain more than one type of gamma subunit. Quantitative immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis both indicated that gamma 2 and gamma 3 subunits can exist in the same receptor complex. A large proportion of GABAA receptors immunopurified on a gamma 3 affinity resin also appeared to contain a gamma 2 subunit. In contrast, when receptors were purified on a gamma 2 affinity resin a small proportion also appeared to contain a gamma 3 subunit. We conclude that most gamma 1-containing receptors have no other gamma subunit in the same receptor complex but some GABAA receptors contain both gamma 2 and gamma 3 subunits.", 
    "80": "In a randomised double-blind study, 34 elderly patients (ASA grades 1-2) underwent elective intra-ocular surgery. Patients were allocated randomly to two groups to receive oral clonidine 300 micrograms or oral diazepam 10 mg 2 h before surgery. Facial block and retrobulbar block were given at 2 h after premedication. Anaesthetic recovery was assessed using a clinical recovery score (at 0, 30, 60 and 120 min after arrival in the recovery room) and brain stem auditory evoked potential responses (BAER) (immediately after operation and at 120 min after operation). In both the groups the clinical recovery scores decreased significantly at 30 and 60 min following recovery (p < 0.01). At 120 min this score returned to the pre-operative value in the clonidine group, but in the diazepam group there was a significant difference between the 2h value and pre-operative value (p < 0.05). In the clonidine group there was no significant rise in the interpeak latencies and absolute peak latencies of brain stem auditory evoked responses recorded immediately after operation and 120 min after operation. In the diazepam group, there was a significant rise in the interpeak latencies immediately after operation and 120 min after operation and a rise in absolute peak latencies (p < 0.05) immediately after operation. In the clonidine group there was a reduction (p < 0.05) in amplitude of wave V at immediately after operation. We conclude that clonidine 300 micrograms orally before surgery does not delay recovery.", 
    "81": "Auditory evoked potentials have been used as an indicator of awareness. In the present study we combined epidural analgesia with three techniques of general anaesthesia. Motor signs of intra-operative wakefulness were documented and assessed along with cardiovascular changes and with midlatency auditory evoked potentials. Thirty patients undergoing elective laparotomy were studied as follows: first continuous epidural analgesia was used in all patients to block painful sensation to the level of T5. Intravenous general anaesthesia was induced with propofol (2.5 mg.kg-1 b.w., group 1, n = 10), thiopentone (5 mg.kg-1 b.w., group 2, n = 10) or etomidate (0.2 mg.kg-1 b.w., group 3, n = 10) and maintained with a propofol (3-5 mg.kg-1, group 1), isoflurane (0.4-0.8 Vol%, group 2), flunitrazepam and fentanyl (0.005 mg.kg-1 b.w.) bolus injection every 20 to 30 s (group 3). Heart rate and arterial pressure were recorded continuously. Purposeful movements of the limbs, eye-opening or other movements as well as coughing were documented as motor signs of intra-operative wakefulness. Auditory evoked potentials were recorded in the awake state, after induction and during maintenance of general anaesthesia. Motor signs of intra-operative wakefulness occurred statistically significantly more often in the patients of the flunitrazepam/fentanyl group than in those of the propofol and isoflurane group. There was no correlation between wakefulness and cardiocirculatory parameters. In the awake patients midlatency auditory evoked potentials had high peak to peak amplitudes and a periodic waveform.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

One must note the difficulties the doctor may find in front such problems to judge the reliability of interviews made in such difficult conditions. Residual disturbances of superior functions, more precisely of vigilance during the period with follow the suicidal action must not be overlooked. Thanks to a clinical scale easily used the residual disturbances have been put in evidence on a sample of 20 subjects who had been admitted with this aim in view in a university ward specialized in psychiatric emergencies.

Diagnoses were: psychotic depression (8); bipolar disorder, manic phase (13); schizoaffective disorder (14); and schizophrenia (2). All patients were very severely disturbed and had failed to respond to medication given at highest levels judged to be safe, usually over 3-4 weeks. Response to ECT was generally rapid and marked, allowing substantial reductions in medication. To achieve the same clinical outcome for each course of ECT, 50% more unilateral than bilateral treatments were required, suggesting that bilateral ECT has a more rapid effect in this highly disturbed population.", 
    "84": "We previously reported nocturnal plasma IL-1 beta (beta) increases during sleep in absence of stress-induced activation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In this paper we evaluate the presence of plasma IL-1 beta secretion in nine healthy volunteers (mean age 31.2 +/- 4.2) during post-prandial naps, after the administration of zolpidem, a benzodiazepine receptorial agonist. Although a significant increase in IL-1 beta plasma levels during spontaneous sleep was present in only four subjects when compared to those obtained during wake and induced-sleep, spontaneous sleep IL-1 beta mean plasma levels appeared slightly higher than both wake and induced-sleep values. Moreover, a negative correlation was present between IL-1 beta and cortisol (F) values obtained during the early afternoon (r = 7; p < 0.05). Our findings are consistent with a possible association of IL-1 beta secretion to physiologic sleep also during daytime spontaneous naps, with the presence of F influence on this phenomenon, and with the lack of IL-1 beta association to daytime naps after sleep-inducer pharmacological agents.",

It is concluded that (a) anxiety in patients undergoing MRI is a multifaceted phenomenon involving fear of enclosed places (claustrophobia), pain, the unknown, as well as apprehension about what the test might reveal, and (b) the best way to avoid traumatizing the patient is to assess these variables in advance of the procedure. Methods to reduce anxiety can then be tailored to the needs of the patient.", 
    "87": "The expression of subtypes of the GABA-A/benzodiazepine receptor complex has been studied during pre- and postnatal development of Macaca monkey visual cortex using complementary radioligand and immunocytochemical labeling. Type I benzodiazepine receptors were labeled directly by [3H]zolpidem. Type II receptors were determined by the amount of binding for [3H]flunitrazepam (FZ) persisting in the presence of the type I-specific ligand CL218872. Monoclonal antibody bd24 was used to label alpha 1 subunits and bd17 to label beta 2 and beta 3 subunits of the GABA-A receptor. Radioligand binding data and bd17 immunoreactivity indicated that type II benzodiazepine receptors were present by fetal day (Fd) 74 (44% of gestation). Immunoreactivity for the beta 2/beta 3 subunits increased until 3-6 weeks after birth, and then declined somewhat into adulthood. Neither radioligand labeling for type I receptors nor immunocytochemical staining for the alpha 1 subunit were apparent until mid-gestation. Both markers appeared shortly before birth in layer 4C, and then in other cortical layers after birth. Immunoreactivity for the alpha 1 subunit increased steadily after birth until it became more intense than that for beta 2/3 subunits in the adult. Quantitative densitometry of CL218872 competition for [3H]FZ binding showed that type I/II distribution was 22%/78% at Fd103; 42%/58% at Fd131; 67%/33% at 9 months; and 61%/39% in adult visual cortex. This \"switch\" between benzodiazepine receptor subtypes overlaps the postnatal critical period for geniculostriate development, suggesting that the change from type II to type I receptors and the appearance of alpha 1 subunits may play a decisive role in the maturation of geniculocortical axon terminations and cortical response properties. It remains to be shown whether this \"switch\" is dependent on functional visual input.", 
    "88": "To test the feasibility of comparing epilepsy treatment policies and outcome, a secondary and a tertiary epilepsy care facility have been audited in a previous study (1). Marked differences were observed in the treatment policies and outcome and in the distribution of seizure types and duration of epilepsy. For this reason the patients of that study were matched according to seizure type and duration of epilepsy, resulting in two groups each of 32 patients per centre. The outcome of treatment was assessed by using clinimetrical indexes for seizure frequency and severity and toxicity of medication, resulting in the Composite Index of Impairments (CII), reflecting all treatment-related impairments. For the statistical analysis the X2-test and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used. Differences were found to be statistically significant when p < 0.05. No distinct differences were found in the treatment policies of both centres. However, differences were observed in the outcome of treatment. The toxicity ratings in this study were significantly higher for the Epilepsy Centre. Also the Composite Index of Impairments (CII) was significantly higher at the Epilepsy Centre. The number of patients with a CII score of > 100 did not differ significantly for both centres. The finding that pharmacotherapy is similar in both centres, suggests that pharmacotherapy is pushed to its limits in both, and that referral to a tertiary facility is mainly for the non-pharmacotherapeutic care modalities available. For the corroboration of this assumption the use of a quality of life index would be more appropriate than the CII.",

    "96": "The locus coeruleus (LC), a major noradrenergic nucleus in the brain, probably has a functional role in the regulation of anxiety states as well as vigilance, attention, learning and memory. LC neurons are under the inhibitory control of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) via ionotropic GABAA receptors. However, to date, little is known of the receptor binding characteristics of these neurons. In the present investigation we therefore examined by receptor radioautography the localization of the binding sites for different components of the GABAA receptor complex in the rat and human LC. Both rat and human LC neurons have a high density of binding sites for the pyridazinyl-GABA derivative [3H]SR 95531 (gabazine, a GABAA receptor antagonist for low affinity GABA recognition sites). However, at the concentrations used, no binding sites in the LC were detectable for the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist [3H]flumazenil, the GABAA receptor agonist (for high affinity sites) [3H]muscimol or the ionophore ligand [35S]t-butyl bicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS). Unexpectedly, the pharmacological specificity of [3H]SR 95531 binding to the LC differed markedly from that to most brain regions (IC50 values for GABA and RU 5135 respectively in the LC were > 10(-2) and 10(-3) M; and, for example, in the dentate gyrus the most labelled structure after the LC, 8 x 10(-7) and 1.8 x 10(-9) M). These differences prompted the further characterization of [3H]SR 95531 binding in the LC, revealing a significant affinity for monoamine oxidase type A (MAO-A), which is highly concentrated in this nucleus. In a competition binding study, a reduction of up to 25% of the [3H]SR 95531 binding was observed with MAO-A but not MAO-B inhibitors, at concentrations which produce maximum but selective enzyme inhibition. Correspondingly, 2 h after the oral administration of supramaximal doses of the MAO-A inhibitors moclobemide and Ro 41-1049 (but not the MAO-B inhibitor lazabemide) the in vitro binding of [3H]SR 95531 was markedly reduced (by 77 and 82% of controls respectively). Moreover, enzyme radioautography with [3H]Ro 41-1049 revealed that SR 95531 has a significant affinity for MAO-A (IC50 values were 10(-5) and 4 x 10(-6) M in the LC and dentate gyrus respectively) but not for MAO-B ([3H]lazabemide binding). Altogether, these findings suggest that the high-affinity binding of [3H]SR 95531 to the LC mainly reflects its affinity for MAO-A, which questions its utility as a selective ligand for low-affinity GABA recognition sites in the CNS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "97": "Effects of medetomidine (40 micrograms/kg)-midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) on plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were evaluated in laboratory pigs. Intramuscular injection of medetomidine-midazolam induced a gradual hyperglycemic response associated with hypoinsulinemia which was much smaller than that by 80 micrograms/kg of medetomidine alone and was almost within a physiological fluctuation. These mild responses induced by medetomidine-midazolam were antagonized by use of an alpha 2-adrenoreceptor antagonist atipamezole (160 micrograms/kg), therefore those changes were thought to be mainly attributed to the effect of medetomidine on alpha 2-adrenoreceptors. A combination of medetomidine at a low dose and midazolam reduces undesirable effects, while providing more profound sedation than medetomidine alone in laboratory pigs.", 
    "98": "The effects of ethanol, chlordiazepoxide, and MK-801 on performance in the elevated-plus maze and on activity measured in a circular activity monitor were compared in Sprague-Dawley rats to determine whether these effects of ethanol could be explained by its action on either GABAA or NMDA receptors. Both ethanol and chlordiazepoxide produced an increase in the time spent in the open arms of the elevated-plus maze and in the ratio of open arm to total arm entries, indicative of an anxiolytic action of these drugs. MK-801 did not alter either the time spent in the open arms or the ratio of open to total arm entries. Chlordiazepoxide and MK-801 produced an increase in total arm entries that suggested that these compounds were increasing locomotor activity. Ethanol also increased total arm entries, but the effect was not statistically reliable. Following habituation to an activity monitor, neither ethanol nor chlordiazepoxide increased activity in this task, whereas MK-801 produced a robust increase in locomotion. Additionally, neither ethanol nor chlordiazepoxide blocked the MK-801-induced locomotor stimulation. The latter finding suggests that the effects of ethanol on GABAA receptors was not blocking an increased activity level produced by its antagonism of NMDA. Additionally, these results indicate that the anxiolytic and locomotor action of ethanol in rats parallel the effects of a benzodiazepine and not those of an NMDA antagonist. Finally, these results suggest that the consequence of ethanol's antagonism of NMDA receptor function is more restricted than that produced by MK-801.",

    "100": "PTSD is a common disorder with high comorbidity and a tendency toward chronicity, which responds slowly to treatment and, in many patients, may not totally resolve even with long-term treatment. For most persons with PTSD, a combined approach to treatment is beneficial, at least in the acute stages of the illness. Pharmacotherapy is an important component of treatment during the acute stages of the illness and may be necessary on a long-term basis for many patients. Because the data from controlled trials of pharmacotherapy are limited, it is not possible to present a unified approach or develop a consensus that is well supported by research findings. What has emerged from the available data is that antidepressants, particularly those with serotoninergic properties, are helpful for core PTSD symptoms when given at higher dose levels for at least 5 to 8 weeks. The TCAs as a group appear to be effective in amelioration of the intrusive symptoms and of anxiety and depressive symptoms, while having little effect on avoidance symptoms. Initial data from studies of the SSRIs suggests that they may have greater efficacy than other drugs in the treatment of avoidance and numbing symptoms and may effect enough overall global improvement in PTSD symptoms that some patients will no longer meet the diagnostic criteria. The hyperarousal symptoms may respond somewhat to antidepressants, but should symptoms continue to be disabling, buspirone or benzodiazepines may be indicated. In choosing a benzodiazepine, those less likely to have distressing withdrawal symptoms, such as clonazepam and chlordiazepoxide, should be considered. Clonazepam, with its serotoninergic properties, may prove to be a particularly efficacious drug. For some patients, phenelzine may be a good choice because it has proven efficacy for the intrusive PTSD symptoms, for depressive symptoms, and for some symptoms of autonomic arousal, such as panic attacks. Other agents to be considered for alleviation of hyperarousal symptoms are lithium, anticonvulsants, and clonidine. In addressing the symptoms of poor impulse control, lithium, beta-blocking drugs, and carbamazepine may be helpful. Brief psychotic episodes should respond to a neuroleptic, although psychoticlike dissociative spells may be nonresponsive.", 
    "101": "Changes in the tail-flick latency (TFL) to noxious heat stimulation and behavioral changes produced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) or intra-amygdala administration of cholinergic agonists were studied in the rat. A significant increase in the TFL and behavioral changes were produced by carbachol (CCh, 2.2-8.8 nmol) injected into the dorsomedial portion (LVm) and inferior horn of the lateral ventricle (LVi), the effects being more prominent following injection into the LVi. Atropine (0.7 nmol), but not mecamylamine (5 nmol), fully inhibited the effects of CCh injected into the LVi. Bethanechol (4.4 nmol) and oxotremorine (1.1-5.5 nmol), but not dimethylphenyl-piperazinium (DMPP, 4.4 nmol), also increased the TFL following administration into the LVi. These cholinergic agonists were generally all less effective than CCh in eliciting behavioral changes. These results are indicative that muscarinic mechanisms of structures in the immediate vicinity of the LVi may be involved in cholinergic antinociception. When microinjected into the medial, central, basolateral, and posterior lateral nuclei of the amygdala complex (AC), both CCh and oxotremorine produced a significant increase in the TFL, but in no case was the effect stronger than that produced by stimulation of the medial nucleus. When microinjected into the same nuclei of the AC, CCh, but not oxotremorine, produced behavioral changes which were less frequent after stimulation of the medial nucleus. The behavioral changes, but not the antinociception, produced by CCh microinjected into the medial nucleus were inhibited by diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p. These results are indicative that antinociception and behavioral changes evoked by CCh injected into the AC depend on drug action on different amygdala structures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "102": "In rat hippocampal slices, BC 264 (0.1-1 microM), a highly potent and selective CCK-B agonist, was found to increase basal release of endogenous glutamate and aspartate but not that of GABA. The natural peptide cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK8) at 1 microM, induced the same effect. The selective CCK-B receptor antagonist, L-365,260, completely reversed these responses, confirming that they are related to CCK-B receptor activation. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the increase in excitatory amino acid release was completely abolished. In contrast to the basal release, the potassium evoked release of aspartate and glutamate was not modified by BC 264.", 
    "103": "Systemic treatment with cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8, 2.5-10 micrograms/kg, s.c.), a non-selective CCK agonist, decreased the exploratory activity of mice in an elevated plus-maze. At higher doses (5-10 micrograms/kg) CCK-8 reduced the frequency of rearing, but only 10 micrograms/kg of CCK-8 significantly inhibited the number of line crossings in the open-field test. A preferential CCKB antagonist L-365,260 (1 and 100 micrograms/kg, i.p.) and a non-selective CCK antagonist proglumide (0.1-1 microgram/kg, i.p.) potentiated the anti-exploratory effect of CCK-8 (2.5 micrograms/kg). Devazepide, a preferential CCKA antagonist, only at a high dose (100 micrograms/kg) tended to increase the action of CCK-8 in the plus-maze. However, the concomitant treatment of CCK-8 with L-365,260 and proglumide, differently from devazepide, also suppressed the locomotor activity in the open-field test. Therefore, it is likely that the potentiation by CCK antagonists of the anti-exploratory effect of CCK-8 is related to the suppression of motor activity. This peculiar interaction between CCK-8 and CCK antagonists could be explained in the light of the opposite role of CCKA and CCKB receptors in the regulation of motor activity in mice.", 
    "104": "The effect of sulphated cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8S) on immediate early gene expression in the rat CNS was investigated using the technique of in situ hybridization. A rapid and transient induction of c-fos, NGFI-A and NGFI-B (nerve growth factor-induced genes A and B) mRNA was demonstrated in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), area postrema (AP), hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei, and central nucleus of the amygdala, following peripheral administration of CCK-8S (1-100 micrograms/kg i.p.). In contrast, levels of c-jun, junB and junD mRNA were unaffected by the peptide. The closely related decapeptide, caerulein (50 micrograms/kg i.p.), induced the same pattern of IEG expression as CCK-8S, whereas the desulphated octapeptide, CCK-8DS (50 micrograms/kg i.p.), had no effect on levels of mRNA for any IEG studied. Expression of IEG mRNA in these areas was suppressed by bilateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, and by pretreatment with the selective CCKA receptor antagonist, devazepide (0.1 and 1 mg/kg i.p.). In contrast, CCK-8S induction of IEG mRNA was not blocked by pretreatment with the selective CCKB receptor antagonist, CI-988 (1 or 10 mg/kg i.p.). In addition, the selective CCKB receptor agonists, CCK-4 (50 micrograms/kg i.p.) or pentagastrin (2 mg/kg i.p.), failed to induce IEG expression in any of the areas studied. These results suggest that systemic CCK-8S primarily acts via CCKA receptors on vagal afferents to stimulate IEG mRNA expression in the rat CNS.", 
    "105": "This study was done to compare the hemodynamics, serum catecholamine levels and postoperative analgesia in total intravenous anesthesia with inhalation anesthesia. Thirteen patients for elective upper abdominal surgery, aged from 40 to 75 years, were studied. In the total intravenous anesthesia group (TIVA group, 7 patients), anesthesia was induced with 0.3 mg.kg-1 midazolam and maintained with 0.68 mg.kg-1.hr-1 midazolam for 15 minutes followed by 0.125 mg.kg-1.hr-1. Fentanyl was also administered as necessary. In the inhalation anesthesia group (inhalation group, 6 patients), anesthesia was induced with 5 mg.kg-1 thiamylal and maintained with 0.5-2.0% enflurane and 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen. In the TIVA group, the blood pressure and heart rate were as stable as those in the inhalation group. The serum concentration of catecholamines in the TIVA group rose significantly 60 minutes after intubation, in particular, the serum epinephrine level was higher than in the inhalation group. The time for extubation, respiratory rate and PaCO2 were not different between the two groups. The postoperative analgesic duration in the TIVA group was significantly longer than that in the inhalation group. The elimination half-life of midazolam was 1.675 +/- 0.281 hours in the TIVA group. In this study, TIVA failed to suppress the elevation of serum catecholamine levels, but it achieved stable hemodynamics during upper abdominal surgery and enough postoperative analgesia without affecting the extubation time, the respiratory conditions and the elimination half-life of midazolam.", 
    "106": "1. Experiments were carried out using patch-clamp techniques in rat thalamic slices, maintained in vitro, to examine the effects of the benzodiazepine compound, clonazepam (CZP), on intrathalamic inhibition. Bath-applied CZP reduced the gamma-aminobutyric acid-B (GABAB) component of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials and currents (IPSPs and IPSCs, respectively) evoked in rat thalamic somatosensory relay neurons by stimulation of nucleus reticularis thalami (nRt), without consistently affecting the GABAA IPSP. Secondary IPSPs, which occur as a result of intrathalamic oscillations, were dramatically reduced. 2. Voltage-clamp experiments combined with local or bath perfusion of the GABAA antagonist bicuculline methiodide (BMI), demonstrated that nRt is a site of GABAA-mediated postsynaptic inhibition that affects inhibitory output onto relay neurons. BMI enhanced both GABAA and GABAB postsynaptic inhibition in relay neurons when applied to nRt. Focal applications in the ventrobasal relay nucleus near the recording electrode blocked the GABAA-mediated IPSP but had no effects on GABAB inhibitory potentials. 3. Results suggest that CZP acts to facilitate recurrent inhibition in nRt and decrease its inhibitory output onto relay neurons. Intra-nRt GABAA-mediated inhibition thus has an important role in controlling thalamic excitability and in the anti-absence actions of CZP.", 
    "107": "GABA receptors are distributed widely throughout the central nervous system on a variety of cell types. It has become increasingly clear that astrocytes, both in cell culture and tissue slices, express abundant GABAA receptors. In astrocytes, GABA activates Cl(-)-specific channels that are modulated by barbiturates and benzodiazepines; however, the neuronal inverse agonist methyl-4-ethyl-6, 7-dimethoxy-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate enhances the current in a subpopulation of astrocytes. The properties of astrocytic GABAA receptors, therefore, are remarkably similar to their neuronal counterparts, with only a few pharmacological exceptions. In stellate glial cells of the pituitary pars intermedia, GABA released from neuronal terminals activates postsynaptic potentials directly. The physiological significance of astrocytic GABAA-receptor activation remains unknown, but it may be involved in extracellular ion homeostasis and pH regulation. At present, there is considerably less evidence for the presence of GABAB receptors on astrocytes. The data that have emerged, however, indicate a prominent role for second-messenger regulation by this receptor.",

This SIH can be antagonized by benzodiazepines, alcohol and 5-HT1A receptor agonists, but not by specific 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. When rat pups are separated from their mother and littermates they produce ultrasonic sounds, indicative of a separation distress. Benzodiazepines, 5-HT1A receptor agonists and SSRIs decrease this calling, whereas 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have no effect. Antidepressants in general do not decrease pup calling because in contrast to the SSRIs, noradrenergic uptake blockers enhance calling. These two animal models of anxiety can be added to the range of anxiety models and will be of help in predicting new putative anxiolytic drugs.", 
    "109": "The concepts of dependence, addiction and abuse comprise overlapping clinical phenomena. The earlier anxiolytic drugs, in particular the barbiturates, were prone to abuse, i.e., non-medical use, and to high-dose misuse. Their modern counterparts, the benzodiazepines, are abused in a patchy way and are sometimes taken in regularly high doses. However, the main problem is physical dependence as manifested by a withdrawal syndrome on discontinuation of the drug. The withdrawal syndrome has been carefully described and comprises physical and psychological features. In particular, perceptual symptoms such as photophobia, hyperacusis and feelings of unsteadiness may predominate. The syndrome may come on during dosage reduction but generally starts 2-10 days after cessation of the benzodiazepine, depending on its elimination half-life. About a third of long-term users suffer a recognisable syndrome even after a tapered withdrawal, its duration usually being only a few weeks. A few patients go on to a prolonged withdrawal syndrome, often characterised by muscular spasm. The treatment of the withdrawal syndrome is supportive and non-specific. A few patients started on benzodiazepine therapy escalate the dose. They tend to show the characteristic 'passive-dependent' personality features and may previously have misused other CNS depressants such as the barbiturates and alcohol. Abuse of benzodiazepines occurs in a rather varied way from country to country. Worldwide, flunitrazepam has caused concern but, in the UK, the main problem has been the intravenous use of temazepam. The molecular pharmacology of the benzodiazepine receptor has been extensively studied and is undoubtedly complex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "110": "We studied the effects of desipramine, alprazolam, muscimol and dizocilpine (MK-801) (alone or associated with desipramine) in the forced swimming test in rats after long-lasting termination of chronic exposure to vehicle and pentylenetetrazol. Sensitisation with pentylenetetrazol was ineffective in changing immobility time in the forced swimming test compared to vehicle treatment; pentylenetetrazol enhanced the anti-immobility effect of desipramine, abolished the anti-immobility effect of alprazolam and did not affect the anti-immobility effect of muscimol. MK-801 at the dose that did not modify immobility time in vehicle-treated rats and in pentylenetetrazol-treated animals strongly potentiated the anti-immobility effect of desipramine in pentylenetetrazol-treated rats. MK-801 in association with desipramine induced a marked hyperlocomotion and hyperexcitability, with swaying movements and oral stereotypies in pentylenetetrazol-sensitised rats. Results are considered the experimental representation of a 'gating mechanism' toward psychotic-like symptoms.",

    "112": "A literature search of articles from January 1966 to July 1993 using MEDLINE, EM-Base, and Current Concepts/Life Sciences, as well as bibliographies of relevant articles.", 
    "113": "All identified original and review publications regarding the clinical features, epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of infantile spasms were reviewed. Emphasis was placed on original studies published since 1975.",

    "115": "Infantile spasms constitute a rare epileptic syndrome with a poor long-term prognosis for normal intellectual development. The spasms are characterized by a brief symmetric contraction of the muscles of the neck, trunk, and/or extremities, often occurring in a series of 2 to more than 100 spasms during a single episode. The disorder is age-specific, with the peak onset of symptoms occurring between 2 and 8 months of age. Spasms of no identifiable cause in infants with normal development prior to the onset of infantile spasms are classified as cryptogenic or idiopathic, whereas those with an identifiable cause are classified as symptomatic. Long-term prognosis is best in cryptogenic cases, with 30-70 percent attaining normal intellect compared with 5-19 percent in symptomatic cases. The etiology and pathophysiology are not well understood. Recent theory postulates that infantile spasms may be caused by an excess of corticotropin-releasing hormone activity during infancy. The suspected association between the whole-cell pertussis vaccine and infantile spasms is coincidental. Few well-designed, prospective, controlled clinical trials for the treatment of infantile spasms have been conducted.", 
    "116": "Standard anticonvulsants such as phenytoin, the barbiturates, carbamazepine, and the succinimides have been ineffective. Of the anticonvulsants, only the benzodiazepines, valproic acid, and vigabatrin have shown efficacy in reducing spasm frequency and severity. Hormonal therapy with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and/or prednisone has been the most frequently studied treatment modality and appears to be the most effective. Hormonal therapy achieves complete spasm control in 50-75 percent of infants within four weeks of initiation. Opinions differ regarding the relative efficacy between ACTH and prednisone, the need for early initiation of hormonal treatment, and the benefits of high dosages of ACTH (> 40 units/d). No treatment has been shown conclusively to improve the long-term intellectual development of these infants. Neurosurgery may be the treatment of choice in select cases when a localized central nervous system abnormality can be demonstrated. Well-designed, blind, prospective clinical trials are needed to answer definitively many lingering questions regarding the treatment of infantile spasms.", 
    "117": "It has been argued that the control of instrumental action by motivational states is indirect, being mediated by the effects these states have on the incentive value of the instrumental outcome (A. Dickinson & B. W. Balleine, 1994). In this study, the benzodiazepine agonist midazolam was found to control instrumental action in a similar manner. Midazolam (1 mg/kg) increased rewarded instrumental performance in rats trained undeprived but only elevated performance in extinction when rats were reexposed to the instrumental outcome under midazolam before the test. This effect of reexposure under midazolam did not transfer to a test conducted under food deprivation, suggesting that it was not produced by drug-induced hunger. Finally, in animals trained hungry, midazolam was found to block outcome devaluation induced by a reduction in food deprivation, indicating that midazolam and food deprivation affect outcome value via a common substrate."
