    "0": "This review underlines the importance of considering in the overall evaluation of drug effect and efficacy not only the kinetics and activities of the administered drug, but also those of the chemical species (metabolites) which are formed in the body. The circumstances in which a role for active drug metabolites may be suspected are described, and a number of specific examples are given. Four different categories are described: drugs which are inactive precursors of active metabolites (e.g. DOPA and cyclophosphamide); active metabolites which contribute to the duration of action of the parent compound (e.g. hexamethylmelamine and clobazam); active metabolites showing a mechanism of action different from that of the parent compound (e.g. buspirone and 1-pyrimidinyl piperazine; fenfluramine and norfenfluramine); and active metabolites showing an antagonistic effect on the activity of the parent drug (e.g. trazodone and m-chlorophenyl-piperazine; aspirin and salicylate).", 
    "1": "To investigate the effectiveness of a new benzodiazepine, alprazolam, and to compare this with amitriptyline (AMT) and with placebo, a trial was undertaken in 65 patients in whom depression was considered to be the dominating feature but not considered to be the primary cause of their condition; it was designed to exclude endogenous depressions. A consistent pattern was found favouring alprazolam over AMT both in rate of response and in total response, as well as significant differences in favour of both alprazolam and AMT over placebo. A comparison of side effects showed a definite trend in favour of alprazolam and placebo over AMT.", 
    "2": "The pharmacokinetics of oral loprazolam and pharmacodynamic responses on the morning following nightly drug administration were examined after single and after seven consecutive 1 mg doses in six non-fasting healthy subjects. The serum concentration-time profiles for unchanged loprazolam measured by a specific high pressure liquid chromatography/gas chromatography (h.p.l.c./g.c.) method and for benzodiazepine material measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) were qualitatively similar although RIA levels were consistently higher. Approximate elimination half-life of unchanged loprazolam after single doses was 8.0 h. For RIA measured material, approximate half-life was 11.7 h following acute administration and 12.8 h after seven consecutive doses. Compared to results after single doses, maximum serum concentration and AUC were greater following 1 week's treatment. Using RIA results, the increases were 27.2% (95% CL 6.9 to 47.4%) and 35.1% (95% CL 15.8 to 54.3%) respectively and using h.p.l.c./g.c. data, 11% (95% CL - 22.6% to 44.5%) and 41% (95% CL - 50.9 to 133.0%). After repeated doses of loprazolam, there were no significant changes with respect to results after single doses in psychomotor function assessed objectively by critical flicker fusion threshold or choice reaction time, or in sleep quality or behaviour on awakening assessed subjectively by 10 cm analogue scales. Mean time to maximum serum concentration was 4.95 h with considerable inter-individual variability (range 1-12 h) and there was a lag time of 1-1.5 h before drug was detectable in blood.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "In adult and elderly non-epileptic subjects psychoactive drugs may cause an altered state of consciousness and repetitive irritative EEG discharges. The neurotoxic pathogenesis of this drug-induced confusion and the differentiation from absence status are discussed. Dramatic relief by intravenous benzodiazepines is detailed. Recovery is complete and prognosis is excellent on withdrawal of the offending drug.", 
    "4": "In selected patients with episodic behavioral disorders, rapidly absorbed benzodiazepines can be given orally to abort paroxysmal symptoms in their prodromal stages or to disrupt a cycle of continuous, serial symptoms. A case example illustrates each use.", 
    "5": "In neuroleptic maintenance therapy, first-illness schizophrenic patients should be prescribed continuing medication for at least one year. In the management of chronic schizophrenic patients following relapse, neuroleptic medication in standard oral doses or depot injections is recommended for periods in excess of 5 years to reduce the risk of relapse. Results are summarized from studies regarding drug therapy in conjunction with psychotherapeutic factors and family environment, the efficacy of lower dosage, benefit/risk ratios, and the advantages of long-term neuroleptic maintenance. The relationships of neuroleptic dose to plasma level and to therapeutic response are considered, as well as the implications of polypharmacy (e.g., use of anticholinergic drugs with neuroleptics).", 
    "6": "Eighty patients admitted to a specialized alcohol detoxification unit, who had blood alcohol levels of .15% or less and were not currently intoxicated, participated in a double-blind trial involving treatment with either halazepam or chlordiazepoxide. A flexible dosage schedule was followed for 5 days with the objective of using the largest dose on the first day, followed by daily reductions as clinically feasible. Efficacy evaluations indicated that halazepam was as effective as chlordiazepoxide in the control of symptoms in patients hospitalized for the medical management of acute alcohol withdrawal. No significant side effects were noted.", 
    "7": "The kinetic and dynamic consequences of the coadministration of triazolam and ethanol were investigated in six normal subjects. Each received three treatments: triazolam, 0.25 mg by mouth, preceded by 1 hour and followed for 7.5 hours by oral ethanol dosed to maintain breath concentrations of 800 to 950 mg/L; placebo and ethanol; and triazolam and orange juice. After ethanol, triazolam total AUC0-infinity increased (mean +/- SD = 21% +/- 18%). Subjects showed greater psychomotor impairment on measures of free recall, postural stability, and hand-eye coordination after the combination than after either drug alone. These dynamic interactions are greater than the kinetic changes.", 
    "8": "There is preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting that one neural mechanism responsible for antipanic efficacy is a reduction in brain noradrenergic function. Alprazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine, has been demonstrated to have antipanic properties; however, to our knowledge, its effects on noradrenergic function have not been established. To assess whether alprazolam alters noradrenergic function, the effects of alprazolam on baseline plasma free 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (MHPG), and yohimbine-induced increases in plasma MHPG level, anxiety-nervousness, blood pressure, and somatic symptoms were studied in 14 patients with agoraphobia and panic disorder. Long-term alprazolam treatment significantly reduced plasma MHPG baseline and blunted the yohimbine-induced increases in plasma MHPG, anxiety-nervousness, and sitting systolic blood pressure. These observations suggest that the antipanic mechanism of action of alprazolam may be due in part to an interaction between benzodiazepine-sensitive and noradrenergic neural systems.", 
    "9": "The quiescent canine gastrointestinal tract responsed to close intraarterial acetylcholine with an atropine-sensitive, hexamethonium, and tetrodotoxin-insensitive contraction, thus suggesting acetylcholine interacts with a muscarinic receptor located on the muscle. When the gut is actively contracting (spontaneously, in response to field stimulation or to motilin), acetylcholine caused a contraction followed by prolonged inhibition of contractions. No such inhibition was apparent after tetrodotoxin; therefore, the receptor for acetylcholine-induced inhibition was apparently on nerves. Neither the acetylcholine-induced excitation nor the inhibition was altered by hexamethonium or reserpine treatment. Both inhibitory and excitatory responses were greatly reduced by atropine, suggesting that both receptors were muscarinic in nature. McNeil A343 produced inhibition but no excitation. Tetrodotoxin, hexamethonium, reserpine, and pirenzepine all increased the concentration of McNeil A343 required for production of 50% inhibition, suggesting it acts via multiple mechanisms. Furthermore, pirenzepine reduced both the inhibitory and excitatory response to acetylcholine, suggesting that it is nonselective in its action on the neural inhibitory or muscular excitatory receptors. We suggest that the presynaptic muscarinic receptor responsible for inhibitory effects of acetylcholine is on the postganglionic cholinergic neuron itself and constitutes an important negative-feedback loop to reduce excessive cholinergic output. Although such a mechanism has been found in vitro previously, this is the first report in vivo in canine small intestine.", 
    "10": "Muscarinic receptor activation stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis and inhibits cyclic AMP formation in dissociated embryonic chick heart cells. We used this preparation to examine the hypothesis that the putative M1 and M2 receptor subtypes are selectively coupled to these two responses. Atropine blocks the effects of carbachol on cyclic AMP formation and phosphoinositide breakdown with nearly identical KI values (1.9 and 0.8 nM); these values are close to the apparent KD (1.8 nM) of atropine competition for [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding. Pirenzepine blocks the effect of carbachol on cyclic AMP formation with a KI of 48 nM, a value similar to the apparent KD (23 nM) determined in radioligand-binding studies. In contrast, a higher concentration of pirenzepine is needed to inhibit carbachol-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis (KI = 255 nM). Two selective agonists, McN-A343 and AHR 602, inhibit cyclic AMP formation but do not stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis in chick heart cells. Muscarinic receptor-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells is also insensitive to McN-A343 or AHR 602 and is antagonized only by relatively high concentrations of pirenzepine. The M1 receptor, as previously defined, has high affinity for pirenzepine and is activated by McN-A343. We find that these ligands have greater activity at muscarinic receptors that inhibit cyclic AMP formation than at those that stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Thus, if different receptor subtypes are associated with these two responses, the M1 receptor regulates cyclic AMP rather than phosphoinositide metabolism. Our data also demonstrate that the chick heart has muscarinic receptors with high affinity for pirenzepine, and thus, in contrast to rat heart, appears to have predominantly M1 receptors.", 
    "11": "Previous studies have shown that Ro 5-4864 is a potent convulsant and increases the firing rate of substantia nigra zona reticulata neurons. The pharmacologic profile of compounds that antagonize these actions suggested that the effects of Ro 5-4864 were not mediated by \"brain-type\" benzodiazepine receptors. We examined a number of compounds that are structurally related to Ro 5-4864 for their capacities to displace [3H]Ro 5-4864 from \"peripheral-type\" binding sites and their potencies as convulsants (or as antagonists of Ro 5-4864-induced convulsions). It was observed that compounds such as KW 3600 (the N-desmethyl analog of Ro 5-4864), which have very low affinities for \"peripheral-type\" sites, are convulsants with a potency nearly equal to that of Ro 5-4864. In contrast, compounds such as Ro 5-6900 and PK 11195, which bind with very high affinities to \"peripheral-type\" binding sites, are neither convulsants nor do they antagonize the convulsant actions of Ro 5-4864. Within a series of compounds that are structurally related to Ro 5-4864 there is a good correlation (r = 0.93; p less than 0.01) between their potencies as convulsants and their capacities to displace [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate from sites that may be associated with the chloride ionophore. Thus, it appears that occupation of \"peripheral-type\" binding sites by high-affinity ligands may not be directly involved in the convulsant actions of Ro 5-4864 and related compounds.", 
    "12": "The effect of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) on emotional responsiveness to stress was determined in CD-1 male mice. The relationship of the monoamines to the mediation of emotional behavior was examined with drugs having selective actions on serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA). Emotional behavior as measured by locomotor activity was increased by stress. This activation enhanced the stimulatory effect of low doses of CDP (5 and 10 mg/kg) and attenuated the depressant action of higher doses (20 and 40 mg/kg). Quipazine (0.5 mg/kg) reduced the depressant effect of CDP in stressed animals. Its action failed to support a proposed anti-serotonergic action of CDP and implicated possible dopaminergic involvement. In stressed mice, apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg) and clonidine (0.1 mg/kg) antagonized the stimulatory action of low doses of CDP. Behavioral effects of clonidine provide support for the notion that the stimulatory effects of CDP may be due to enhanced catecholamine (CA) neurotransmission. Whole brain levels of NE and DA were significantly increased when clonidine was combined with CDP. This indicated a possible reduction in CA turnover and activity.", 
    "13": "The feasibility of visualizing the heterogeneity of benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors in the brain of living baboons was investigated using Positron Emission Tomography. Ethyl 8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl 6-oxo-4H-imidazo (1,5-a) (1, 4) benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (RO 15 1788) labelled by carbon 11 (11C-RO 15 1788) was I.V. injected for the \"in vivo\" labelling of the central type BDZ receptors. Displacement experiments were performed 20 minutes after the administration of the radioligand by two different cold drugs: RO 15 1788 which has an equal affinity for central type BDZ receptors, and propyl B-Carboline-3-carboxylate (B-CCP) which favours the sites located in the cerebellum. Different sensitivities to these two drugs displacement of 11C-RO 15 1788 binding \"in vivo\" were observed: on the one hand in the regional localization of the displacement, and on the other hand, in the amount of the radioactivity displaced. The apparent interregional heterogeneity of the displacement seen in the cerebellum and in the temporal cortex are discussed in terms of discrepancies observed \"in vitro\" at physiological temperature, between cerebellar and non-cerebellar BDZ central type binding sites.", 
    "14": "A group of patients suffering from anxiety, as assessed by general practitioners and psychologists using research criteria for generalised anxiety, were treated with either diazepam or placebo double blind for six weeks. This active treatment period was preceded by a one week single blind placebo \"wash in\" period and followed by a two week single blind placebo \"wash out\" period. The results suggest that diazepam can produce rebound anxiety and withdrawal symptoms when used in moderate doses and for what has previously been regarded as a safe length of time. If replicated these results have implications for the therapeutic use of benzodiazepines.", 
    "15": "Within the Center for Bio-Pharmaceutical Sciences research on medicinal chemistry is centered around two themes: receptor recognition and photochemistry of drugs. Extremely little is known about the conformation of receptor recognition sites. The approach that should lead to a more detailed knowledge is outlined. Similarly the interaction between enzymes and their inhibitors will be studied. The photochemistry of drugs can be useful (phototherapy) or harmful (phototoxicity). The phototoxicity of benzodiazepines was found to be attributable to the formation of oxaziridines on the N-oxide groups.", 
    "16": "Within the Center for Bio-Pharmaceutical Sciences pharmacological research has its emphasis on kinetics of drug disposition, and its interrelationship with pharmacodynamics. The benzodiazepines present a class of related compounds where comparative studies have been performed. Both in humans and in animal models the relationship between plasma levels and central effects has been studied. Also the factors that influence individual responses to the same dose of a drug have been investigated. One of the approaches is the predictive value of antipyrine metabolite formation. Nifedipine shows polymorphism in oxidation, but it is possible to obtain the desired pharmacodynamic effect while minimizing side effects even in slow metabolizers.", 
    "17": "Much recent research has shown that benzodiazepine binding sites in the central nervous system are associated with GABA receptors. It is therefore possible that the pharmacological and therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines and drugs with similar profiles are mediated through GABAergic mechanisms. In this paper the evidence is considered for a possible involvement of GABA in the behavioral effects of anxiolytic drugs. There are a number of reports that the behavioral actions of anxiolytics can be antagonised by GABA antagonists such as bicuculline or picrotoxin but there are many contradictory findings and these drugs are difficult to use effectively in behavioral studies. In general, GABA agonists do not exert anxiolytic-like behavioral effects after systemic injection but intracerebral administration of muscimol has been shown to produce benzodiazepine-like actions. Although a number of questions remain unanswered, current evidence does not provide strong support for a role for GABA in the behavioral effects of anxiolytic drugs.", 
    "18": "Clonazepam, up to concentrations of 5 x 10(-5) M produced only 15% inhibition of contraction without effecting isoproterenol-induced slow action potentials (APs) of guinea pig papillary muscles. On the other hand, 10(-6) M diltiazem completely inhibited both slow APs and contractions. Both clonazepam and diltiazem inhibited Na+-induced Ca2+ release from isolated mitochondria. The half-maximum effect of clonazepam and diltiazem occurred at 7 and 8 x 10(-6) M respectively. The results suggest that clonazepam more specifically inhibits the Na+-induced Ca2+ release process of mitochondria.", 
    "19": "The purpose of this study was to investigate further the kappa opioid receptor selectivity of the field-stimulated isolated rabbit vas deferens preparation and to study the profile of a series of kappa agonists in this tissue. Agonists acting at mu, delta and sigma receptors were without detectable effect in the rabbit vas deferens. But a number of kappa agonists, including bremazocine, tifluadom, ethylketocyclazocine, ketocyclazocine, U-50,488 and Win 42,610 all depressed contractions, producing parallel dose-response curves. Mr 2034 generally produced a shallower dose-response curve and achieved a lower maximum effect, thus acting like a partial agonist. The effect of ethylketocyclazocine was not reduced by the irreversible mu antagonist, beta-funaltrexamine, confirming that it is not acting via mu receptors. Another group of drugs, including nalorphine, butorphanol and proxorphan, which produce an agonist action via kappa receptors in the guinea-pig ileum and mouse vas deferens, were antagonists in the rabbit vas deferens, suggesting that this tissue will only respond to high efficacy kappa agonists.", 
    "20": "ZK 91296, a newly synthesised beta-carboline with partial agonistic activity at the benzodiazepine receptor raised the threshold current necessary to elicit electroconvulsions in mice. This effect was dose-dependent and could be reversed by Ro 15-1788. ZK 91296 antagonised the anticonvulsant action of diazepam, but potentiated that of phenobarbitone. ZK 91296 protected mice from DMCM-induced seizures with high potency, this effect being benzodiazepine specific. In mutant rats exhibiting an increased muscle tone of the hindlimbs, ZK 91296 was devoid of muscle relaxant effect and antagonised the muscle relaxant action of both diazepam and phenobarbitone. The latter effect could be blocked by Ro 15-1788. The results suggest that the actions of ZK 91296 are only partly due to its partial agonistic properties at the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "21": "Indoxyl derivatives were detected as minor products among the urinary metabolites of two trial drugs, a benzodiazepine (GP 55 129) and a benzophenone (CGP 11 952). Their structures were elucidated by NMR and mass spectroscopy. Presumably, metabolites containing potential aldehyde functions react spontaneously with endogenous indoxyl. Such derivatives have not hitherto been encountered in drug metabolism.",

    "23": "A method for the direct quantitative densitometry of nitrazepam and its main metabolites (7-aminonitrazepam, 7-acetamidonitrazepam and 2-amino-5-nitrobenzophenone) in urine was developed. The unchanged drug and its metabolites were extracted with benzene-dichloromethane (4:1), subjected to thin-layer chromatography, and determined by direct ultraviolet densitometry. Recovery experiments showed that the method was quantitative. The limit of detection was 5 ng/ml for 2-amino-5-nitrobenzophenone and 10 ng/ml for other compounds. The method was applied to the determination of nitrazepam and its metabolites excreted in human urine after administration of 10 mg of the drug.", 
    "24": "The effects of Ro 15-1788 and ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) were studied alone and in combination on the behavioral performances of squirrel monkeys. Under one procedure, performances maintained by food were suppressed by electric shock presentation (punishment or \"conflict\" procedure). Under a second procedure, responding was maintained either by food or electric shock delivery under a 5-min fixed-interval schedule. Doses of beta-CCE between 0.1 and 3.0 mg/kg, i.m., produced graded decreases in punished responding which were reversed by pretreatment with Ro 15-1788 (1.0 - 10.0 mg/kg, i.m.). Low doses of beta-CCE (0.03 - 0.3 mg/kg, i.m.) increased responding of monkeys maintained by shock presentation, but did not affect food-maintained responding; higher doses of beta-CCE decreased responding under both schedules. These effects of beta-CCE are opposite those produced by the benzodiazepines under this procedure. Ro 15-1788 (1.0 mg/kg i.m.) antagonized the effects of beta-CCE, producing a shift to the right in the dose-response curves. These findings provide further support for the view that beta-CCE and Ro 15-1788 produce effects mediated by the same benzodiazepine receptor recognition site.", 
    "25": "The brain regional distribution and kinetics of RO 15-1788, a benzodiazepine (BZD) antagonist labeled with 11C was studied by time-of-flight positron tomography after intravenous injection in four normal human volunteers. In two control studies, there was a high uptake of [11C]RO 15-1788 in gray matter structures initially (brain/blood ratio approximately 3), and subsequent retention that was highest in cerebral cortex, a structure known to have a high density of BZD receptors in vitro. Variation in tissue kinetics of [11C]RO among different gray matter structures may, however, suggest regional differences in binding characteristics or environment of BZD receptors. In two displacement studies, unlabeled RO 15-1788 was injected ten minutes after the radioligand: there was an immediate and marked washout of [11C]brain radioactivity that reached 70% in the occipital cortex with a 0.05 mg/kg dose (indicating a high specific to non-specific binding ratio) but was less prominent with a 0.01 mg/kg dose. These data suggest that [11C]RO 15-1788 may be useful for in vivo mapping of human brain BZD receptors using positron tomography.", 
    "26": "Exhaustive photoaffinity coupling of flunitrazepam to living spinal cord neurons reduced the capacity of benzodiazepines to potentiate the electrophysiologically measured GABA response. In qualitative agreement with reversible binding data the dose-response curve for enhancement of the GABA response by benzodiazepines was shifted to the right, indicating that the remaining reversible benzodiazepine binding sites have lower affinity for benzodiazepines. Photoaffinity labeling did not reduce inhibition of the GABA response by beta-carbolines and there was only a small decrease in beta-carboline binding. In both control and photoaffinity-labeled cultures, the inhibitory effect of beta-carbolines on the GABA response was reversed in the presence of excess benzodiazepine. The results indicate that the effects of photoaffinity labeling are confined to the BZD recognition site, and that coupling between benzodiazepine receptors and GABA receptors remains intact.", 
    "27": "Administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist, RO 15-1788, to baboons that were chronically exposed to diazepam or triazolam precipitated withdrawal signs. When RO 15-1788 was administered repeatedly at one or three day intervals, precipitated withdrawal signs were attenuated. However, these baboons remained tolerant to the sedative effects of the high doses of benzodiazepines to which they were continuously exposed. While tolerance to agonist effects of drugs and development of physical dependence are often thought to be functionally interrelated phenomena, the present results suggest that these may be separable properties of the benzodiazepines. The present results clearly indicate that certain actions of benzodiazepine agonists and antagonists can be independently regulated.", 
    "28": "Three benzodiazepines, chlordiazepoxide (CDP), diazepam (DZP) and medazepam (MZP), inhibited the contractile response of circular muscle strips from the isolated guinea-pig gallbladder to sulfated cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK8) in the presence of atropine. The dose-response curves for CCK8 were shifted in parallel to the right by 10(-6) to 10(-5) M of the three benzodiazepines, although the maximum response to CCK8 was depressed by higher concentrations. Schild plot analysis of the antagonism gave pA2 values of 6.70 for CDP and 7.33 for DZP and slopes of the regression lines close to 1.0, suggesting that the antagonism was competitive in nature. The responses to acetylcholine, histamine and bradykinin were also depressed by 10(-5) M of DZP, but no parallel shift of their dose-response curves was observed. The non-specific inhibitory action of the benzodiazepines on these agonists was presumed to be due to the calcium antagonist-like action of the benzodiazepines. The antagonism between CCK8 and the benzodiazepines in the gallbladder was unaffected by GABA.", 
    "29": "Chronic daily injections of diazepam (5 mg/kg i.p.) for 21-30 days have previously been shown to cause a selective subsensitivity to microiontophoretically applied GABA in serotonergic dorsal raphe neurons in the rat. Following termination of chronic benzodiazepine treatment, GABAergic sensitivity remained depressed for up to 96 h even though pharmacologically active concentrations of diazepam and its active metabolites could no longer be detected in brain tissue. In contrast, a single injection of the specific benzodiazepine antagonist, RO 15-1788, given 22 h prior to electrophysiological recording, restored GABAergic sensitivity to the control range. Sensitivity of dorsal raphe neurons to serotonin was not altered by either chronic treatment with or withdrawal from diazepam. These results indicate that (1) RO 15-1788 can accelerate the time course of withdrawal and (2) administration of this benzodiazepine antagonist can induce a persistent change in GABAergic responsiveness.", 
    "30": "The regional distribution of diazepam (DZP) was established in eleven discrete brain areas in the rat after i.m. chronic treatment (15 days; 5 mg/kg/day). In addition, the kinetic profiles of this drug were investigated in plasma, eryhtrocytes, and three CNS regions (nucleus caudatus, hippocampus, and cerebellum) upon which the pharmacokinetic study was focused. The modifications occuring in plasma-protein binding and erythrocytes binding were reported. In the CNS, the DZP was rapidly distributed; its concentrations and its kinetic profiles were not uniform in the different brain areas studied. The highest amount of DZP was noted in the hypothalamus, while nucleus caudatus and colliculi also presented important DZP levels. Concerning the kinetic parameters after chronic administration, an increase in the elimination half-life time value in central and peripheral compartments, as compared to values reported after acute administration, was observed. The study of cerebral DZP levels as compared with those in the erythrocytes or in plasma suggests a linear correlation in the three CNS areas investigated. These experimental results demonstrate the interest of such studies for psychotropic drug monitoring.", 
    "31": "The usefulness of diazepam as a provocative stimulus for hGH secretion has been suggested as a simple, reliable test in clinical hGH assessment of pituitary disorders. We have investigated the effects of diazepam (10 mg im) on plasma hGH and hPRL in 5 normal and 7 acromegalic subjects. No significant variations in hGH and hPRL levels have been observed in any of the studied subjects. These findings indicate that the drug is ineffective on hGH and hPRL release and that it cannot be considered a valid provocative test either in normal or acromegalic subjects.", 
    "32": "A retrospective study of 781 alcoholics detoxified at two treatment centers suggested that magnesium sulfate was significant in preventing seizures and that benzodiazepines were essential in minimizing other complications. Future investigations should determine the most effective mineral dosage levels for alcohol detoxification.", 
    "33": "Two hundred and fifty female patients about to undergo elective gynaecological surgery, were randomly allocated to a single oral dose of either 5, 15, 30 mg Org 3770, placebo, or 10 mg diazepam the evening before operation. Assessment of sleep quality next morning using self-rated questionnaires showed that both Org 3770 and diazepam were significantly better than placebo in enhancing sleep. In addition, a dose-response effect was seen with Org 3770, 15 mg seeming optimal. Assessment of presurgery anxiety, again using self-rated questionnaires, showed that 15 mg Org 3770, and 10 mg diazepam were significantly more effective than placebo at reducing anxiety. None of the medications produced any troublesome side effects nor did they have an effect on blood pressure.", 
    "34": "A single dose of Ro 11-3128 was found to be 98-100% effective against Schistosoma mansoni infections at intervals of 3 h to 15 days following infection, and apparently killed the schistosomula stages soon after administration, thus allowing an assessment of the immunizing potential of progressive larval stages. Following infection with 500 unirradiated cercariae, optimum resistance was manifest by groups drug-treated at 48-96 h (60-75%). Significantly lower levels of resistance occurred with early (3 h) or later (6-15 day) treatments. Superimposition of an infection treated at 15 days on a prior infection which had been treated at 2 days did not reduce the level of resistance caused by the latter, indicating that the infection plus delayed treatment had not induced suppression. Thus the peak resistance manifest during the 48-96 h period may reflect optimum expression of protective antigens. Comparison of irradiated (20 krad.) with unirradiated infections showed that, when drug-terminated 24, 48 or 96 h post-infection, irradiated cercariae induced significantly less resistance than unirradiated cercariae, perhaps indicating a delayed appearance of protective antigens following radiation treatment.", 
    "35": "Effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) on memory, cognition, psychomotor function, subjective moods, and incidence of adverse reactions were investigated in 34 healthy young volunteers. The drug caused impairment of immediate and delayed recall. Most of the impairment was due to interference with retrieval processes. Recovery was virtually complete 60 minutes after administration. The incidence of adverse reactions was high. Benzodiazepines need to be administered even when ketamine is used in subanesthetic doses.", 
    "36": "Antipsychotic medications have traditionally been used for their sedative effects in the management of the behavioral and emotional agitation of mania while awaiting the therapeutic effect of lithium. On the premise that a nonantipsychotic sedative might satisfactorily and more specifically control this agitation without neuroleptic or hypotensive side effects and without prolongation of the acute illness, the authors conducted an open trial with four acutely manic patients in which only the benzodiazepine lorazepam was administered along with lithium; no antipsychotic medications were used. Lorazepam, administered in oral and parenteral form on an as-needed basis to maintain patient cooperation with the treatment plan and milieu, was found to be rapid and effective in controlling the manic agitation of these patients, with few troublesome side effects, and with no obvious prolongation of the acute illness.", 
    "37": "Inhalation anesthetics have been shown to substantially diminish the clearance of several drugs eliminated by hepatic routes. The purpose of the present study was to determine the influence of halothane-oxygen anesthesia on the hepatic metabolism of diazepam and its proximate metabolites in anesthetized rats whose physiologic status was monitored and maintained. The portal vein, femoral artery and bile duct of male Sprague-Dawley rats 370 to 395 g, were cannulated under pentobarbital anesthesia. After a 2-hr recovery period, [14C]diazepam was administered in to the portal vein as a 0.25-mg/kg bolus followed immediately by a 0.25-mg/kg/hr infusion by the same route. After the attainment of steady state, the halothane group (seven rats) received 1% halothane in oxygen whereas the control group (six rats) continued to breathe room air. The diazepam infusion was maintained for an additional 3 hr. Concentrations of diazepam, N-desmethyldiazepam, 4-hydroxyphenyldiazepam and 3-hydroxydiazepam were determined in plasma; these metabolites as well as oxazepam and N-desmethyl-4-hydroxyphenyldiazepam were also determined in bile. Radioactivity in bile was approximately 98% conjugated; radioactivity in plasma was approximately 30% conjugated. Halothane anesthesia caused an increase in the concentrations of diazepam and its metabolites in plasma, but the steady-state ratios of the concentration of the individual metabolites in plasma to diazepam concentration were not changed. The intrinsic clearance of diazepam was decreased by 42%, P less than .01, and the ratio of formation to elimination clearance of the metabolites measured in plasma was not changed. Halothane anesthesia also decreased the excretion rate of 14C into bile.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "38": "Twelve healthy volunteers were enrolled in a double-blind placebo-controlled study to evaluate the amnestic effects of orally administered lorazepam. The subjects were tested for immediate and delayed recall, using a word recall memory task. The subjects taking lorazepam did not differ from subjects receiving placebo on immediate recall. However, the delayed recall scores of lorazepam subjects were significantly lower compared to the placebo group (p less than .01).", 
    "39": "A 34-yr-old male in delirium tremens required a total of 2640 mg iv diazepam for adequate sedation. Doses of benzodiazepines clearly must be individualized, and doses higher than those currently recommended may be required.", 
    "40": "Single-dose kinetics of 0.1 mg/kg intravenous diazepam, 10 mg/kg oral antipyrine, and 300 mg oral phenytoin were followed in healthy subjects before and after 400 mg metronidazole twice a day for 5 days. When data before metronidazole dosing were compared with those after metronidazole dosing, there were no changes in total plasma clearance of diazepam (0.53 and 0.65 ml/min/kg), antipyrine (39.0 and 38.0 ml/min/kg), or phenytoin (0.56 and 0.55 ml/min/kg). Plasma t 1/2s and volumes of distribution of the three drugs tested were not affected by metronidazole, but urinary excretion of 4-hydroxyantipyrine decreased after metronidazole dosing. There was no change in the elimination of phenytoin as its hydroxylated metabolite after metronidazole. It is concluded that, at therapeutic concentrations, metronidazole does not significantly inhibit oxidative drug metabolism.", 
    "41": "Experimental and more limited clinical studies have suggested that influenza vaccination may depress the oxidative hepatic metabolism of various drugs and lead to drug toxicity. The alleged mechanism is the formation of interferon and the resulting decrease in cytochrome P-450 available for drug oxidation. Because of the clinical and basic science implications of these reports, we undertook to study the effects of influenza vaccine on the metabolism of three commonly used drugs: chlordiazepoxide, theophylline, and lorazepam. Our healthy male subjects were studied just before and 1 and 7 days after vaccination. As expected, lorazepam metabolism, which proceeds by glucuronidation and not oxidation, was not altered by vaccination. Surprisingly, however, the oxidation of chlordiazepoxide was also not depressed by the vaccine. Theophylline oxidation, which proceeds primarily by microsomal oxidation (demethylation), was significantly decreased 1 day, but not 7 days, after vaccination. Serum alpha-interferon levels rose after vaccination for only about 8 hours, and levels of gamma-interferon rose to about 500 IU/ml at 24 hours, peaked at 72 hours, and returned to normal by 100 hours after dosing. It appeared that the higher the theophylline clearance before vaccination, the greater the degree of clearance depression after vaccination. Thus the inhibition of drug oxidation after influenza vaccination is selective and each drug should be studied individually. The degree of depression of theophylline clearance is small and transient and appears to be greater in subjects with higher prevaccination clearance.", 
    "42": "Twenty patients withdrawing from alcohol who had reliable histories of previous alcohol-withdrawal seizures and thus were at high risk for a subsequent seizure were treated in hospital with oral diazepam loading: 20 mg of the drug was given every hour to a minimum total of 60 mg. None of the patients had a seizure during the stay in hospital. We believe that phenytoin prophylaxis is not necessary in these circumstances. However, if the patient is already taking phenytoin, this drug should not be abruptly discontinued in the withdrawal period in favour of diazepam loading.", 
    "43": "The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of the acute and subchronic administration of the benzodiazepine clobazam (20 mg/kg orally) on the plasma levels of the pituitary hormones (prolactin, FSH and LH) in the male rat. This 1.5 benzodiazepine did not induce any variation of the hormone levels either after acute or subchronic administration. These negative data are discussed as compared to the effects of other benzodiazepines of GABA and GABA receptor agonists and antagonists on the pituitary hormone levels according to particular experimental conditions.", 
    "44": "Two personal observations of absence status appearing on eye closure are described and similar cases in the literature considered. Treatment of such an absence status with clobazam is proposed.", 
    "45": "The effects of glycine and other inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters on strychnine convulsive threshold were studied in mice. The mean intravenous threshold dose for strychnine to produce its convulsive effects in briefly restrained mice was determined to be 1.386 +/- 0.035 mg/kg. The dose of strychnine produced 100% postconvulsive mortality in all the mice tested. Intraperitoneal administration of various doses (100-500 mg/kg) of glycine, beta-alanine and L-threonine, 15-20 minutes prior to strychnine infusion produced an increase of 13.92%, 25.73% and 17.15% respectively in strychnine convulsive threshold in mice. Diazepam, known to produce its anticonvulsant, sedative and muscle relaxant effects through its interaction either with central GABA or glycine receptors was found to be the most potent (48.39%) in increasing strychnine convulsive threshold. Taurine and Baclofen were found to be ineffective in raising strychnine convulsive threshold in mice. These observations favor the possible use of either glycine or beta-alanine in addition to diazepam in treating clinical cases of strychnine neurotoxicoses.", 
    "46": "In a double-blind cross-over study the effects of propranolol (80 mg) and of lorazepam (1 or 2.5 mg) were assessed in normal student volunteers using a number of performance tests and mood-rating and bodily symptom questionnaires. Drug effects on experimentally-induced anxiety were also studied. The high dose of lorazepam impaired performance in digit-symbol substitution, symbol copying and verbal learning tests, and increased subjects' ratings of dizziness. Both lorazepam and propranolol increased simple reaction time. Lorazepam but not propranolol increased ratings of sedation. Although the stressor increased subjects' ratings of anxiety, neither drug altered anxiety ratings. Propranolol decreased and lorazepam increased subjects' pulse. These changes were not reflected in subjects' self-ratings - lorazepam caused a reduction in ratings of palpitations. The results suggest that if administered acutely, neither drug is beneficial in the treatment of short-term anxiety associated with intellectual stress.", 
    "47": "The effects of antimuscarinic agents, claimed as acting selectively on gastric acid secretion (pirenzepine) or gut motility (secoverine) or lacking selectivity (atropine and ipratropium bromide), were assayed on both functions by means of two simple experimental models: the gastric acid secretion induced by pylorus ligation and the gastric emptying of a high viscosity meal in the conscious rat. When the same experimental conditions were used in the two tests (i.v. route; duration of the test: 1 hr) we found that pirenzepine was not more selective than atropine on either function while ipratropium bromide was 16 times more selective for gastric secretion and secoverine 2.6 times more selective for gastric motility. Even if routes of administration and times of duration were different between the two tests, similar results were obtained. It was concluded that, when compared to atropine, in our in vivo experimental conditions pirenzepine and secoverine show a scant if any selectivity for either function, while, paradoxically, a sharp selectivity for gastric secretion is shown by the bronchodilator ipratropium bromide.", 
    "48": "Patients who had given their informed consent took part in a study to compare the sedative properties of the new benzodiazepine, midazolam, with diazepam. The drugs were administered intravenously and the quality of sedation, profoundness of amnesia, and rate of recovery were examined. Both drugs provided good-quality sedation, with midazolam producing a significantly greater degree of amnesia. Psychomotor tests used to assess recovery showed that patient performance following exposure to either drug had returned to normal 2 hours postsedation. However, patients who had received diazepam were drowsier later in the day and during the night following sedation than those who received midazolam. The implications of these findings are discussed.", 
    "49": "Binding of gamma-aminobutyrate and benzodiazepine receptor ligands has been studied in the cerebellum of adult normal (C3H) and Lurcher mutant mice. The adult mutant has lost all Purkinje cells and more than 90% of the granule cells in the cerebellar cortex. When compared with their normal littermates Lurcher mice displayed large decreases in the number of high-affinity binding sites for [3H]muscimol, a synaptic gamma-aminobutyrate receptor ligand, in washed cerebellar homogenates. This observation was consistent with the extensive loss of gamma-aminobutyrate receptive Purkinje and granule cells from the Lurcher cerebellum. However, specific binding of the benzodiazepine-receptor ligand [3H]flunitrazepam to Lurcher cerebellum remained unchanged. Indeed quantitative autoradiography, employing [3H]flunitrazepam as a photoaffinity label, showed no significant differences in the density of labelling between Lurcher and normal littermate mice in any region of the cerebellum. These benzodiazepine binding sites in washed homogenates or tissue sections displayed a gamma-aminobutyrate-induced enhancement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding which occurred to the same extent in both Lurcher and normal cerebellum, a facilitatory effect which could be blocked by the addition of bicuculline methobromide. Our results suggest that a large proportion of the high-affinity, specific benzodiazepine binding sites in mouse cerebellum are not coupled to the synaptic gamma-aminobutyrate receptors thought to be labelled by high affinity [3H]muscimol binding. Further, that benzodiazepine binding sites do not appear to be enriched on either the soma or dendrites of Purkinje cells, as has been suggested from previous studies. Investigations at the electron microscope level are now required to elucidate the cellular location of benzodiazepine binding sites in the cerebellar cortex and to examine whether or not they are likely to be exposed to gamma-aminobutyrate in vivo.", 
    "50": "Spinal monosynaptic responses, evoked by repetitive stimulation, undergo homosynaptic depression the pattern of which is altered by 0.5 mg/kg of clonazepam. The dependence of this effect of clonazepam on the GABAergic system was examined in spinal unanaesthetized cats. Topical application of bicuculline to the spinal cord did not change any feature of the homosynaptic depression in the biceps-semitendinosus (BST) or triceps surae (TS) monosynaptic pathway but antagonized the action of clonazepam. Semicarbazide (200 mg/kg, i.v.) also prevented the effect of the benzodiazepine but alone had actions of its own. Evidence is presented that clonazepam influenced homosynaptic depression of the biceps-semitendinosus pathway by lengthening the primary afferent depolarization (PAD). This prolongation of the primary afferent depolarization did not last for the entire duration of the train as primary afferent depolarization also underwent depression. Therefore later responses in the train were unaffected by clonazepam. Homosynaptic depression of the triceps surae pathway was not similarly affected because activation of triceps surae afferents does not cause significant depolarization of its own afferents. It is suggested that the enhancement of GABAergic transmission at least partially underlies the effect of clonazepam on homosynaptic depression.", 
    "51": "Clonazepam (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) changed the characteristic pattern of the exponential decline of the monosynaptic responses, the early tetanic rundown, evoked by trains of 10 stimuli (2, 5 or 10 Hz) applied to either the biceps-semitendinosus or triceps surae nerve, and recorded from the ventral root in spinal cats. In the case of the biceps-semitendinosus, clonazepam did not affect the first monosynaptic response or the last five monosynaptic responses forming the plateau, while the second monosynaptic response was markedly depressed, especially at the higher frequencies tested. The triceps surae reacted differently to the administration of clonazepam, in that the first response was increased and the amount of depression of the second response was lessened, with no change of the plateau. All the effects of clonazepam were reversed by the benzodiazepine antagonist, ethyl 8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-a] [1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (Ro15-1788; 5 mg/kg, i.v.), which alone had no effect of its own on any parameters, suggesting that the effects of clonazepam were mediated by central benzodiazepine receptors. Diazepam (1.0 mg/kg, i.v.), caused the same changes in the homosynaptic depression of the biceps-semitendinosus pathway as did clonazepam, but increased the plateau instead of the second response in that of the triceps surae pathway.", 
    "52": "Several N-(indol-3-ylglyoxylyl)amino acid derivatives were synthesized and tested for their affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor in bovine cortical membranes. From these compounds, the N-[(5-chloro-, 5-bromo-, or 5-nitroindol-3-yl)glyoxylyl]glycine or -alanine esters were clearly the most potent, while the 5-methoxy analogues were considerably less active. Moreover, esters were more active than the corresponding acids. It is concluded that the affinity of these derivatives for the benzodiazepine receptor is profoundly dependent on amino acid molecular size, as well as the hydrophobic and electronic properties of the compounds.", 
    "53": "The binding sites for t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S] TBPS) and [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]Flu) were solubilized from freshly prepared and washed membranes from rat forebrain with 20 mM 3-[(cholamidopropyl)-dimethylamonio]-1-propanesulfonate in the presence of protease inhibitors. Approximately 64% of the protein, 56% of the [35S]TBPS sites and 45% of the [3H] Flu sites were solubilized. The soluble and membrane-bound binding sites for [3H]Flu were relatively stable on storage at 0 degree C or at -65 degrees C for 11 days. Binding of [35S]TBPS to membranes was increased after freezing the membranes at -65 degrees C for 1 to 11 days and was relatively unchanged if the membranes were stored at 0 degree C for 1 to 11 days. Solubilized [35S]TBPS binding sites were stable when stored at -65 degrees C but declined to 20% of control when stored at 0 degree C for 11 days. Tested shortly after preparation, [35S]TBPS binding to both soluble and membrane preparations demonstrated similar affinity, temperature dependence and noncompetitive inhibition by pentobarbital (pb). Stimulation by pb of [3H]Flu binding to the soluble fraction decayed on storage of the solubilized material at 0 degree C with a time course similar to the loss of [35S]TBPS binding. This finding might suggest that the stimulation of [3H]Flu binding by pb is mediated via its action on TBPS sites. However in membrane preparations stored at 0 degree C, [35S]TBPS binding was stable whereas the pb effects declined with time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "The subcellular localization of central-type benzodiazepine receptors in bovine cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and corpus striatum has been studied. In all regions except for the corpus striatum, benzodiazepine receptors are most highly enriched in purified postsynaptic densities (PSDs) prepared by Triton X-100/hypotonic lysis of purified synaptosomal plasma membranes. Benzodiazepine receptor enrichment in PSDs varies regionally, following the order cerebellum (approximately 8.5-fold enriched relative to crude P2 membranes) greater than cerebral cortex greater than hippocampus greater than striatum (no significant enrichment); the percentage of putative type I benzodiazepine receptors in each of these brain regions follows the same rank order. In cerebral cortex, analysis of displacement of the benzodiazepine antagonist [3H]Ro-15-1788 by the type I-selective drug CL-218,872 reveals that PSDs contain type I benzodiazepine receptors exclusively; other subcellular fractions contain mixtures of type I and type II benzodiazepine receptors. Benzodiazepine receptors in PSDs resist further extraction with detergent but can be solubilized with detergent containing greater than or equal to 0.2 M NaCl. The enrichment of detergent-resistant/detergent-plus-salt extractable type I benzodiazepine receptors in PSDs might account in part for the differential solubilization of type I and type II benzodiazepine receptors from crude brain membranes previously reported. The benzodiazepine-binding protein in cerebral cortical PSDs was identified by photoaffinity labeling with [3H]flunitrazepam followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and fluorography. The PSD benzodiazepine-binding protein is identical in molecular weight to the binding protein from whole brain; partial tryptic and alpha-chymotryptic fingerprints are also very similar in PSDs and whole brain.", 
    "55": "GABAA receptor agonists modulate [3H]diazepam binding in rat cortical membranes with different efficacies. At 23 degrees C, the relative potencies for enhancement of [3H]diazepam binding by agonists parallel their potencies in inhibiting [3H]gamma-aminobutyric acid [( 3H]GABA) binding. The agonist concentrations needed for enhancement of [3H]diazepam binding are up to 35 times higher than for [3H]GABA binding and correspond closely to the concentrations required for displacement of [3H]bicuculline methochloride (BMC) binding. The maximum enhancement of [3H]diazepam varied among agonists: muscimol = GABA greater than isoguvacine greater than 3-aminopropane sulphonic acid (3APS) = imidazoleacetic acid (IAA) greater than 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo (4,5,6)-pyridin-3-ol (THIP) = taurine greater than piperidine 4-sulphonic acid (P4S). At 37 degrees C, the potencies of agonists remained unchanged, but isoguvacine, 3 APS, and THIP acquired efficacies similar to GABA, whereas IAA, taurine, and P4S maintained their partial agonist profiles. At both temperatures the agonist-induced enhancement of [3H]diazepam binding was reversible by bicuculline methobromide and by the steroid GABA antagonist RU 5135. These results stress the importance of studying receptor-receptor interaction under near-physiological conditions and offer an in vitro assay that may predict the agonist status of putative GABA receptor ligands.", 
    "56": "The anthelminthic natural product avermectin B1a (AVM) modulates the binding of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor ligands to membrane homogenates of mammalian brain. The potent (EC50 = 40 nM) enhancement by AVM of [3H]diazepam binding to rat or bovine brain membranes resembled that of barbiturates and pyrazolopyridines in being inhibited (partially) by the convulsants picrotoxin, bicuculline, and strychnine, and by the anticonvulsants phenobarbital and chlormethiazole. The maximal effect of AVM was not increased by pentobarbital or etazolate. However, AVM affected BZ receptor subpopulations or conformational states in a manner different from pentobarbital. Further, unlike pentobarbital and etazolate, AVM did not inhibit allosterically the binding of the BZ receptor inverse agonist [3H]beta-carboline-3-carboxylate methyl ester, nor did it inhibit, but rather enhanced, the binding of the cage convulsant [35S]t-butyl bicyclophosphorothionate to picrotoxin receptor sites. AVM at submicromolar concentrations had the opposite effect of pentobarbital and etazolate on GABA receptor binding, decreasing by half the high-affinity binding of [3H]GABA and related agonist ligands, and increasing by over twofold the binding of the antagonist [3H]bicuculline methochloride, an effect that was potentiated by picrotoxin. AVM also reversed the enhancement of GABA agonists and inhibition of GABA antagonist binding by barbiturates and pyrazolopyridines. These overall effects of AVM are unique and require the presence of another separate drug receptor site on the GABA/BZ receptor complex.", 
    "57": "The results of therapy have been analyzed in a series of 192 patients admitted for status epilepticus over 7 years in two intensive care units. Most (142 cases without any prior epilepsy) corresponded to secondary forms. In 2/3 of the cases, the patients were admitted because of failure of benzodiazepines and/or phenobarbitone. Sodium thiopentone achieved control of seizures in 75%; short-acting barbiturates should be especially prescribed in grand mal status with impending brain anoxia. Diphenylhydantoin would appear suitable in non-life-threatening conditions such as serial seizures or partial status. Chlormethiazole often succeeds in controlling convulsive status which has proved refractory to other treatment. Supportive management is mandatory: 52% of patients required respiratory assistance. Fatalities (36%) exclusively correspond to the underlying cerebral conditions and systemic disorders.", 
    "58": "A new benzodiazepine compound, ethyl loflazepate (ethyl-7-chloro-2,3-dihydro-5-(2-fluorophenyl)-2-oxo-1H,1,4- benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate; CM6912) was studied using in vitro experimental systems for its displacement activity on 3H-diazepam binding to the synaptosomal membrane fraction of rat cerebrum and potentiating action on GABA. CM6912 inhibited the specific binding of 3H-diazepam by 25%, 75% and 90% at concentrations of 0.01 microM, 0.1 microM and 1 microM, respectively, while its metabolites CM6913 and CM7116, at 0.1 microM, completely inhibited the binding. Concentrations for 50% inhibition (IC50) were 25 nM for CM6912, 3.2 nM for CM6913 and 1.4 nM for CM7116. These results suggest that the metabolite CM7116 is stronger than its parent compound in displacing the 3H-diazepam binding, and they also suggest that the long-lasting anti-anxietic action of CM6912 might be due to the in vivo formation of CM7116. CM6912, CM7116 and diazepam potentiated the suppressive action of GABA on spontaneous spikes of Purkinje cells in guinea pig cerebellar slices in a dose-dependent manner. Concentrations for 50% suppression (IC50) were 96.0 microM for GABA alone, 75.0 microM for GABA plus diazepam (5 microM), 78.9 microM for GABA plus CM6912 (5 microM) and 60.8 microM for GABA plus CM7116 (5 microM). These findings suggest that CM6912 and CM7116 may potentiate the postsynaptic inhibitory action of GABA in a manner similar to and probably more strongly than diazepam.", 
    "59": "Forty-seven children aged between four and 11 years received temazepam 0.5 mg/kg in a novel fast dispensing dosage form. The preparation was well accepted and associated with few side-effects. Satisfactory sedation and anxiolysis was obtained in over 93% of patients. The relative merits of a variety of routes of administration of premedicant drugs for children are discussed and the advantages of buccally administered formulations for this age group are presented.", 
    "60": "Triazolam 0.25 mg, diazepam 10 mg and placebo were compared in a randomized double-blind trial of oral premedication in 90 patients undergoing minor gynaecological surgery. Both triazolam and diazepam produced a significant sedative effect as measured by patient self assessment linear analogue scales but only diazepam was more anxiolytic than placebo. Psychomotor performance assessed by the letter-search test at 3 and 6 hours after awakening showed a decrement in performance in patients receiving triazolam at 3 hours compared with the two other groups. Triazolam was shown to have a pronounced amnesic effect and whilst it might be used for premedication, its lack of anxiolysis coupled with a significant impairment of psychomotor performance at 3 hours after awakening, render the drug unsuitable for premedication in the short stay patient.", 
    "61": "An automated technique for the continuous analysis of different frequency bands of the electrocorticogram (ECoG) of the rat has been used to quantify the actions of phencyclidine (PCP) and various other stimulant drugs. It has been demonstrated that phencyclidine, etoxadrol and LY154045 produced similar changes in the individual frequency bands whereas amphetamine and apomorphine had different profiles of activity. The phencyclidine-like compounds exhibited extremely strong stimulation of the ECoG with very large increases recorded in high frequency (15-50 Hz) activity and reductions in all other frequency bands. Various compounds have been used in an attempt to antagonise the changes in the ECoG. Chlorpromazine caused a slight shift in the dose-response curves as did chlordiazepoxide when used with phencyclidine. The GABA agonists, THIP and muscimol, had no effect on the stimulation of the ECoG. In contrast another presumed GABA agonist, baclofen, proved to be the most effective agent for blocking the stimulation induced by phencyclidine. The role of the GABAB receptor in the action of phencyclidine is discussed.", 
    "62": "In order to define the modulatory role played by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in corticopetal cholinergic projections, the effect of this amino acid and related drugs on gross behaviour, the EEG and the release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the cerebral cortex in freely moving guinea-pigs was studied. gamma Aminobutyric acid, injected intracerebroventricularly (20-50 mumol) induced a three-phase picture: first (5-15 min) behavioural activation and increased release of ACh, then (30-90 min) depression, EEG synchronization and reduced release of ACh, and finally \"rebound\" stimulation. Ethanolamine-O-sulphate (EOS) injected intraventricularly (28 mumol/kg) or intraperitoneally (14 mmol/kg) reproduced the first two phases of the effects of GABA (i.e. stimulation followed by inhibition), while diazepam (0.7 and 3.5 mumol/kg, i.p.) and flurazepam (32 mumol/kg, i.p.) caused, at first, only depression. Muscimol and 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo(4,5-c)pyridine-3-ol (THIP) injected intraventricularly (in the nmol range) or intraperitoneally (in the mumol range) produced behavioural activation and increased release of ACh; the depressant signs appeared only after very large, toxic doses. Picrotoxin and bicuculline, at sub-convulsive doses, reduced the symptomatology caused by GABA and antagonized the sedation produced by diazepam. Methysergide (8-16 mumol/kg, i.p.) prevented the behavioural activation and the increased release of ACh by GABA, unmasked the depression due to subthreshold doses of diazepam (i.c.v., 7-70 nmol) and reversed the stimulation induced by muscimol into sedation and reduced the outflow of ACh. Pretreatment with 5,7-HT also dampened and shortened the stimulation by muscimol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "CL 218,872 is a triazolopyridazine that acts at the benzodiazepine binding site. At low doses (0.5-7.5 mg kg-1) it is proconvulsant when combined with subconvulsant doses of picrotoxin but not when combined with pentetrazol (leptazol, pentylenetetrazol). At high doses (20-60 mg kg-1) CL 218,872 counteracted seizures caused by pentetrazol but not those caused by picrotoxin. There was tolerance to the proconvulsant effects after five days of treatment and to the anticonvulsant effects after 15-20 days. Two phenylquinolines, PK 8165 and PK 9084, that also act at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex have proconvulsant actions in combination with picrotoxin. Significant tolerance to these effects had not developed even after 20 days of treatment. It is concluded that three different sites on the GABA-benzodiazepine complex mediate the pro- and anti-convulsant actions of CL 218,872 and the proconvulsant actions of PK 8165 and PK 9084.", 
    "64": "In order to investigate the central action of zopiclone, the rat brain was divided into 8 regions and the changes in monoamines (MA) in each region were examined. The effect of zopiclone on stress was also examined from changes in brain monoamines under electro-footshock stress load in comparison with that of nitrazepam and flurazepam. The animals were decapitated at 1 h after administration of zopiclone, nitrazepam and flurazepam at each dose of 1 and 10 mg/kg (p.o.). No changes in MA at each region of the brain were noted, but the metabolite, homovanillic acid (HVA) was reduced at the cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and cerebellum. 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) was reduced at the amygdala. Noradrenaline (NA) turnover accelerated by electro-footshock stress load was inhibited by zopiclone. From the results of this experiment, it was found that the effects of zopiclone on brain MA were similar to those of nitrazepam and flurazepam: inhibition of 5-HT turnover at the amygdala was common to these three compounds. This result suggests that zopiclone has similar pharmacological properties to benzodiazepines as an antianxiety agent.", 
    "65": "A multicenter, double-blind, sleep laboratory and performance study was conducted to evaluate the hypnotic efficacy and residual effects of midazolam (15 mg) and temazepam (30 mg) compared to placebo when administered in the middle of the night. Eighteen volunteers with objectively verified sleep maintenance insomnia received placebo for 3 nights during week 1 (adaptation and screening). During weeks 2, 3, and 4 they received 2 consecutive nights of midazolam, temazepam, and placebo (one treatment per week) in a balanced crossover design. Treatment was administered in the middle of the night (3.5 hours after bedtime). Neither drug reduced the latency to return to sleep after the middle of the night awakening. Both drugs significantly increased total sleep time, reduced wake during sleep, and number of awakenings over 4.5 hours in bed after treatment. In the morning (5 to 6.5 hours postdrug) significant performance decrements and reduced daytime sleep latency (7 hours postdrug) were found with temazepam but not midazolam.", 
    "66": "The decreased sensitivity to the anxiolytic action of diazepam, BC-3-KEE, IME-6MEO-TGBC, IME-6MEO-DBC was shown in rats with experimental alcoholism. The degree of the decreased sensitivity was dependent on the affinity of the compounds to benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "67": "The influence of Ro 15-1788 and bicuculline on the action of GABA-positive drugs (muscimol), GABA cethyl ester, piracetam and depakine and benzodiazepine tranquilizers (diazepam, phenazepam) on motivated aggression has been studied. It has been shown that Ro 15-1788 which has a weak antiaggressive effect selectively antagonizes the anti-aggressive effect of tranquilizers but not that of GABA-positive drugs. Bicuculline antagonizes antiaggressive activity of the drugs of both types. The action of these antagonists on the effect of the drugs under study as regards the analgetic activity of morphine was also studied. It has been shown that Ro 15-1788 antagonizes the potentiation of morphine analgesia caused by diazepam. At the same time Ro 15-1788 does not influence morphine analgesia potentiated by muscimol. Bicuculline removes the potentiation of morphine analgesia caused both by diazepam and muscimol it is concluded that bicuculline-sensitive GABA receptors modulate the antiaggressive effect of benzodiazepines and their influence on the analgetic action of opiates.", 
    "68": "Thirteen patients with benzodiazepine overdosage received the specific benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788. Intravenous administration of 1.5 to 10 mg reversed the central nervous system depression induced by different benzodiazepine compounds within one to two minutes of injection. These case reports indicate that Ro 15-1788 may be an effective tool in the primary management of self-poisoning."
