Depending on the drugs that would be given before the induction of anesthesia with etomidate, the patients were separated into 4 groups: no pretreatment (Group NP), fentanyl 1 \u00b5g\u00b7kg-1 (Group F), midazolam 0.03 mg\u00b7kg-1 (Group M), and midazolam 0.015 mg\u00b7kg-1 + fentanyl 0.5 \u00b5g\u00b7kg-1 (Group FM). Patients who received the same anesthetic procedure were selected: 2 minutes after intravenous injections of the pretreatment drugs, anesthesia is induced with 0.3 mg\u00b7kg-1 etomidate injected intravenously over a period of 20-30 seconds. Myoclonic movements are evaluated, which were observed and graded according to clinical severity during the 2 minutes after etomidate injection. The severity of pain due to etomidate injection, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and adverse effects were also evaluated.",

    "5": "A wide range of agents have been tested as adjuncts to peripheral nerve blocks, which are commonly performed for regional anesthesia during or after hand or arm surgery, neck or spine surgery, and other procedures. Studies to determine the comparative merits of nerve block adjuncts are complicated by the wide variety of coadministered local anesthetics and sites of administration and by the heterogeneity of primary endpoints. Sodium bicarbonate has been shown to speed the onset of mepivacaine nerve blocks but delay the onset of others. Epinephrine has been shown to prolong sensory nerve blockade and delay systemic uptake of local anesthetics, thus reducing the risk of anesthetic toxicity. Tramadol, buprenorphine, dexamethasone, and clonidine appear to be effective additives in some situations. Midazolam, magnesium, dexmedetomidine, and ketamine cannot be routinely recommended as nerve block additives due to a dearth of supportive data, modest efficacy, and (in the case of ketamine) significant adverse effects. Recent studies suggest that administering additives intravenously or intramuscularly can provide many of the benefits of perineural administration while reducing the potential for neurotoxicity, contamination, and other hazards.",

    "7": "Individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) often receive complex polypharmacy regimens as part of treatment, yet few studies have sought to evaluate patient characteristics associated with this high medication burden. This retrospective chart review study examined rates of complex polypharmacy (i.e., \u22654 psychotropic medications), patterns of psychotropic medication use, and their demographic and clinical correlates in a naturalistic sample of adults with bipolar I disorder (BDI; N=230) presenting for psychiatric hospital admission. Using a computer algorithm, a hospital administrator extracted relevant demographic, clinical, and community treatment information for analysis. Patients reported taking an average of 3.31 (S.D.=1.46) psychotropic medications, and 5.94 (S.D.=3.78) total medications at intake. Overall, 82 (36%) met criteria for complex polypharmacy. Those receiving complex polypharmacy were significantly more likely to be female, to be depressed, to have a comorbid anxiety disorder, and to have a history of suicide attempt. Women were significantly more likely than men to be prescribed antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and stimulants, even after controlling for mood episode polarity. Study data highlight the high medication burden experienced by patients with BD, especially those who are acutely symptomatic. Data also highlight the particularly high medication burden experienced by women with BD; a burden not fully accounted for by depression.", 
    "8": "Extrapyramidal syndromes (EPS) caused by antipsychotic therapy are currently treated with anticholinergics that lack selectivity for the five muscarinic receptor subtypes. Since these receptors are heterogeneously expressed among the different classes of striatal neurons and their afferents, it can be expected that their simultaneous blockade will cause distinct, sometimes opposed, effects within the striatal circuitry. In order to test the hypothesis that the differential blockade of the muscarinic receptor subtypes would influence their potency and efficacy to prevent EPS, here we tested four anticholinergics with varying order of affinities for the muscarinic receptor subtypes, and compared their dose-response curves to inhibit haloperidol-induced catalepsy in male rats. Drugs were applied into the lateral ventricle 15\u00a0min before haloperidol (2\u00a0mg/kg, s.c.). Catalepsy was measured in the bar test at 15\u00a0min intervals during 5\u00a0h. The preferential M1/M4 antagonist pirenzepine (3, 10, 30, 100, and 300\u00a0nmol) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of catalepsy intensity: ED50\u00a0=\u00a05.6\u00a0nmol [95% CI, 3.9-8.1], and latency: ED50\u00a0=\u00a05.6\u00a0nmol [95% CI, 3.7-8.6]. Pirenzepine had the steepest dose-response curve, producing maximal inhibition (84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05%) at the dose of 10\u00a0nmol, while its effect tended to reverse at higher doses (62\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011%). The purported M1/M3 antagonist 4-DAMP (30, 100, and 300\u00a0nmol) also caused a dose-dependent inhibition of catalepsy intensity: ED50\u00a0=\u00a029.5\u00a0nmol [95% CI, 7.0 to 123.0], and latency: ED50\u00a0=\u00a028.5\u00a0nmol [95% CI, 2.2 to 362.0]. However, the curve for 4-DAMP had a less pronounced slope, reaching its maximal effect (63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014%) at the dose of 300\u00a0nmol. The M2/M4 antagonist AF-DX 116 (10, 30, and 300\u00a0nmol) only caused a partial inhibition of catalepsy (30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011%) at the dose of 30\u00a0nmol, but this changed to a non-significant increment (15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010%) at the dose of 100\u00a0nmol. The alleged M4 antagonist tropicamide (30, 100, 300, and 600\u00a0nmol) produced a partial inhibition of catalepsy (36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012%) at the dose of 300\u00a0nmol, but lacked effect at higher or lower doses. Concurrent treatment with pirenzepine (10\u00a0nmol) and tropicamide (300\u00a0nmol) produced an effect similar to that of tropicamide alone. The greater potency and efficacy of pirenzepine for catalepsy inhibition could be due to its higher affinity for M1 receptors and, to a lesser extent, for M4 receptors. It is suggested that selective M1 antagonists would be more effective than M2, M3 or M4 antagonists to prevent EPS caused by antipsychotic drugs.", 
    "9": "Clobazam (CLB), a 1,5-benzodiazepine (BZD), was FDA-approved in October 2011 for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years and older. BZDs exert various CNS effects through allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors. The structurally distinct, 1,4-BZD clonazepam (CLN) is also approved to treat LGS. The precise mechanisms of action and clinical efficacy of both are unknown. Data show that the GABAA \u03b1\u2081-subunit-selective compound zolpidem [ZOL] exhibits hypnotic/sedative effects. Conversely, data from knock-in mice carrying BZD binding site mutations suggest that the \u03b1\u2082 subunit mediates anticonvulsant effects, without sedative actions. Hence, the specific pattern of interactions across the GABAA receptor complexes of BZDs might be reflected in their clinical efficacies and adverse effect profiles. In this study, GABAA-receptor binding affinities of CLB, N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB, the major metabolite of CLB), CLN, and ZOL were characterized with native receptors from rat-brain homogenates and on cloned receptors from HEK293 cells transfected with combinations of \u03b1 (\u03b1\u2081, \u03b1\u2082, \u03b1\u2083, or \u03b1\u2085), \u03b2\u2082, and \u03b3\u2082 subtypes. Our results demonstrate that CLB and N-CLB have significantly greater binding affinities for \u03b1\u2082- vs. \u03b1\u2081-receptor complexes, a difference not observed for CLN, for which no distinction between \u03b1\u2082 and \u03b1\u2081 receptors was observed. Our experiments with ZOL confirmed the high preference for \u03b1\u2081 receptors. These results provide potential clues to a new understanding of the pharmacologic modes of action of CLB and N-CLB.", 
    "10": "Anxiety and depression, while very common problems in Parkinson's disease (PD), have not been subject to adequate treatment trials. While a handful of double blind placebo-controlled trials of depression have been published, only a small number of subjects have been enrolled in most of these. There have been no adequate treatment trials of anxiety. Thus, most practitioners base their treatments on what has been published in the general population and their own personal experience. The data suggest that depression is probably treatable in some cases, but there are no data to support any drug treatment of anxiety. Much of the rationale for treating these disorders is based primarily on side effect profiles rather than efficacy and is almost entirely based on anecdotal experience. Although we lack convincing data, we do believe in the pharmacologic treatment of depression and anxiety and choose medications based on side effect profiles, some of which may be useful. We favor the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in general for both depression and anxiety because of their relative freedom from side effects but will often choose mirtazapine if insomnia or weight loss is a problem, clonazepam for anxiety without depression if an SSRI is insufficient or if REM sleep behavior disorder is a problem, or a tricyclic antidepressant if drooling is troubling and the patient is not demented. Alternatively, we use the serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine in those who do not tolerate an SSRI. SSRIs cannot be used for anxiety on an as needed basis, whereas short-acting benzodiazepines may be useful for this purpose. Psychosocial treatments of both depression and anxiety have also been under-studied, with probable benefits and a benign adverse effect profile.",

    "15": "The purpose of this study was to examine concentration-dependent effects of Azone\u00ae (AZ) on the buccal absorption of diazepam (DIAZ). Porcine buccal mucosa was placed in modified Ussing chambers and pretreated with 10 \u03bcL of 0%, 5%, 20%, and 50% (w/v) AZ in ethanol. DIAZ was administered to the donor chamber either in solution or a chitosan-based gel. The donor chamber disappearance, receptor chamber appearance, and tissue retention of DIAZ were monitored over 2 h by HPLC, with AZ tissue disposition also measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry profiling of tissue cryosections. DIAZ steady-state flux values significantly (p < 0.05) decreased 1.4- and 2.4-fold in 20% and 50% AZ-pretreated tissues, respectively. Only 20% and 50% AZ-pretreated tissues were also accompanied by an increased loss of DIAZ from the donor chamber, suggesting DIAZ was forming a reservoir in the buccal mucosa with higher AZ concentrations. Indeed, the percentage of the initial DIAZ dose remaining in the mucosa following a 2 h experiment was increased 3.0-fold with a 50% AZ pretreatment compared with control. AZ provided a concentration-dependent reservoir for DIAZ in buccal mucosa, resulting in retarded release into the receptor chamber, an approach that may be exploited for controlled release of DIAZ.",

    "21": "The induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) is an important source of drug-drug interaction (DDI) and can result in pronounced changes in pharmacokinetics (PK). Rifampicin (RIF) is a potent inducer of CYP3A4 and also acts as a competitive inhibitor which can partially mask the induction. The objective of this study was to determine a clinical DDI study design for RIF resulting in maximum CYP3A4 induction. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to project the dynamics and magnitude of CYP3A4 induction in vivo from in vitro data generated with primary human hepatocytes. The interaction model included both inductive and inhibitory effects of RIF on CYP3A4 in gut and liver and accounting for the observed RIF auto-induction. The model has been verified for 4 CYP3A4 substrates: midazolam, triazolam, alfentanil and nifedipine using plasma concentration data from 20 clinical study designs with intravenous (n=7) and oral (n=13) administrations. Finally, the influence of the time between RIF and substrate administration was explored for the interaction between midazolam and RIF. The model integrating in vitro induction parameters correctly predicted intravenous induction but underestimated oral induction with 30% of simulated concentrations more than 2-fold higher than of observed data. The use of a 1.6-fold higher value for the maximum induction effect (Emax) improved significantly the accuracy and precision of oral induction with 82% of simulated concentrations and all predicted PK parameters within 2-fold of observed data. Our simulations suggested that a concomitant administration of RIF and midazolam resulted in significant competitive inhibition limited to intestinal enzyme. Accordingly, a maximum induction effect could be achieved with a RIF pretreatment of 600 mg/day during 5 days and a substrate administration at least 2 h after the last RIF dose. A period of 2 weeks after RIF removal was found sufficient to allow return to baseline levels of enzyme.",

Most of them revealed similar to superior binding affinity to the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex, relative to diazepam as the reference drug. Among them, 5-(4-chloro-2-(2-fluorophenoxy)benzyl)-3-benzylthio-4H-1,2,4-triazole (8l) showed the highest affinity (IC\u2085\u2080=0.892 nM) relative to diazepam (IC\u2085\u2080=2.857 nM) and also showed the most increase in pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure threshold relative to diazepam as the reference drug.", 
    "23": "In postmortem investigations of fatal intoxications it is often challenging to determine which drug/s caused the death. To improve the interpretation of postmortem blood concentrations of sedative and hypnotic drugs and/or clonazepam, all medico-legal autopsies in Sweden - where these drugs had been detected in femoral vein blood during 1992-2006 - were identified in the databases of the National Board of Forensic Medicine. For each drug, concentrations in postmortem control cases - where the cause of death was not intoxication and where incapacitation by drugs could be excluded - were compiled as well as the levels found in living subjects; drugged driving cases and therapeutic drug monitoring cases. Subsequently, fatal intoxications were assessed with regards to the primary substances contributing to death, and blood levels were compiled for single and multiple drug intoxications. The postmortem femoral blood levels are reported for 16 sedative and hypnotic drugs, based on findings in 3560 autopsy cases. The cases were classified as single substance intoxications (N=498), multiple substance intoxications (N=1555) and postmortem controls (N=1507). Each autopsy case could be represented more than once in the group of multiple intoxications and among the postmortem controls if more than one of the included substances were detected. The concentration ranges for all groups are provided. Overlap in concentrations between fatal intoxications and reference groups was seen for most substances. However, the concentrations found in single and multiple intoxications were significantly higher than concentrations found in postmortem controls for all substances except alprazolam and triazolam. Concentrations observed among drugged drivers were similar to the concentrations observed among the therapeutic drug monitoring cases. Flunitrazepam was the substance with the highest number of single intoxications, when related to sales. In summary, this study provides reference drug concentrations primarily to be used for improving interpretation of postmortem drug levels in obscure cases, but which also may assist in drug safety work and in pharmacovigilance efforts.",

All patients were titrated on iloperidone to 6mg BID by Day 4, then flexibly dosing between 6 and 12mg BID, as needed. The primary variable was the Integrated Clinical Global Impression of Change (I-CGI-C) and the primary analysis time point was Week 12. A total of 500 patients were randomized and received iloperidone (gradual switch, 240; immediate switch, 260), with 175, 155, and 170 patients switched from risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole, respectively. I-CGI-C Results confirmed improved outcomes at Week 12, with scores that were similar between the gradual- and immediate-switch groups, respectively, for risperidone, 2.82 and 2.67 (95% CI: -0.229, 0.511); olanzapine, 2.87 and 3.03 (95% CI: -0.548, 0.235); and aripiprazole, 2.79 and 2.81 (95% CI: -0.405, 0.368). Incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar in both switch groups, with the most frequently reported (\u226510%) being dizziness, dry mouth, somnolence, and weight increase. In conclusion, switching to iloperidone by either a gradual or an immediate method did not reveal any clinically significant differences in ratings of overall efficacy and safety/tolerability outcomes, based on the I-CGI-C at 12weeks. Similar overall safety/AE profiles were observed regardless of the specific agent from which patients were switched.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the quinine/3-hydroxyquinine metabolic ratio (quinine MR) with other suggested markers for CYP3A induction: endogenously formed 4\u03b2-hydroxycholesterol, midazolam clearance in plasma and the 6\u03b2-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio in urine. We have previously performed a clinical trial in which 24 healthy subjects were randomized to take 10, 20 or 100 mg daily doses of rifampicin for 14 days (n = 8 in each group) to achieve a low and moderate CYP3A induction. In newly analyzed data from this study we can show that the quinine MR could detect CYP3A-induction even at the lowest dose of rifampicin (10 mg) (p < 0.01), comparable to a 4\u03b2-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratio and midazolam clearance. The median fold-induction for the quinine MR compared to baseline was 1.7, 1.8 and 2.6 for the three dosing groups (10, 20 and 100 mg). In conclusion, in this study the quinine MR was comparable to midazolam clearance as a measure of CYP3A activity but easier to determine since only a single blood sample needs to be drawn.",

    "61": "Propofol is a short acting intravenous anesthetic that has been used in the treatment of status epileptics. However, the occurrence of seizures in epileptic and non-epileptic patients during recovery from propofol induced anesthesia suggests that propofol may have proconvulsant effects. We have previously shown that propofol displays anticonvulsant effects against picrotoxin (PTX) induced seizures during its peak sedative effects. The purpose of the present study was to compare the time course of the effect of intravenous administration of various doses (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) of propofol and midazolam on PTX-induced seizures in adult female Sprague-Dawley rats. The latency to onset of clonic seizures induced by intraperitoneal injection of PTX was significantly increased by the highest dose of propofol and all doses of midazolam, suggesting that both agents display anticonvulsant effects. The anticonvulsant effects of propofol (10 mg/kg) lasted about 20 min and PTX-induced clonic seizures were observed thereafter and peaked within 30 min post drug administration. Clonic seizures progressed rapidly to tonic seizures leading to high rate of PTX-induced mortality. In midazolam (10 mg/kg) treated rats, clonic seizures were observed 25 min after drug administration and the number of rats exhibiting clonic seizures was highest within 40 min. However, clonic seizures did not progress into tonic seizures and thus, PTX-induced seizure related mortality was significantly reduced. In conclusion, this study provides further evidence for the anticonvulsant effects of propofol and midazolam against PTX-induced seizures. Furthermore, the data of the current study showed that midazolam was more effective than propofol against PTX-induced tonic seizures.",

In this study, we evaluated AC-3933 potential for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, a disorder characterized by progressive decline mainly in cholinergic function. Oral administration of AC-3933 (0.01-0.03mg/kg) resulted in the amelioration of scopolamine-induced amnesia, as well as a shift in electroencephalogram (EEG) relative power characteristic of pro-cognitive cholinergic activators, such as donepezil. In addition, treatment with AC-3933 even at the high dose of 100mg/kg p.o. produced no seizure or anxiety, two major adverse effects of BzR inverse agonists developed in the past. These findings indicate that AC-3933 with its low risk for side effects may be useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

However, this increase reached a plateau at 30 nM with hardly any change at a concentration range of 100-3000 nM (from 115.2% to 117.1%). AC-3933 (0.1-10 \u03bcM) significantly enhanced KCl-evoked acetylcholine (ACh) release from rat hippocampal slices in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, in vivo brain microdialysis showed that intragastric administration of AC-3933 at the dose of 10 mg/kg significantly increased extracellular ACh levels in the hippocampus of freely moving rats (area under the curve (AUC\u2080\u208b\u2082 h) of ACh level; 288.3% of baseline).

    "79": "Fibromyalgia (FM) primarily affects women, and it is increasingly recognized by health care providers as more patients seek assistance for their chronic pain conditions. FM patients suffer from reduced quality of life, daily functioning and productivity. A single FM patient can cost society tens of thousands of dollars each year, with the overall expense increasing alongside disease severity. Indirect costs account for the majority of total expenditures and involve losses in productivity, reduced work hours, absenteeism, disability, unemployment, early retirement, informal care and other out-of-pocket costs. Health care utilization increases in concert with the severity of illness. Moreover, FM patients often have several comorbid illnesses (e.g. depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances), resulting in extreme escalation of overall health care expenditures. Medications with the best efficacy in the treatment of FM include the tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline and nortriptyline, cyclobenzaprine (a skeletal muscle relaxant), tramadol, duloxetine, milnacipran, pregabalin and gabapentin. Corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics, with the exception of tramadol, are not considered efficacious.

    "80": "Although recent studies have shown that catatonia can occur in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), the overlap of the behavioral features between these disorders raises many diagnostic challenges. In fact, in clinical practice it is common to misinterpret catatonic symptoms, including mutism, stereotypic speech, repetitive behaviors, echolalia, posturing, mannerisms, purposeless agitation and rigidity, as features of ASDs. The current medical treatment algorithm for catatonia in ASDs recommends the use of benzodiazepines. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is indicated when patients are unresponsive, or insufficiently responsive, to benzodiazepines. Other pharmacological options are also described for the treatment of catatonic patients resistant to benzodiazepines and ECT, and there is evidence for the effectiveness of a psychological treatment, co-occurring with medical treatments, in order to support the management of these patients. In this article we provide a summary of studies exploring catatonia in ASDs and our clinical experience in the management and treatment of this syndrome through the presentation of three brief case studies. Moreover, we review the mechanisms underlying symptoms of catatonia in ASDs, as well as the diagnostic challenges, providing an outline for the management and treatment of this syndrome in this clinical population.",

Here, a novel methodology is reported for intrinsic solubility improvement, using in silico prediction of crystal structures, by perturbing key interactions in the crystalline solid state. The methodology was evaluated with a set of benzodiazepine molecules, using the two-dimensional molecular structure as the only a priori input. The overall trend in intrinsic solubility was correctly predicted for the entire set of benzodiazepines molecules. The results also indicate that, in drug compound series where the melting point is relatively high (i.e., \"brick dust\" compounds), the reported methodology should be very suitable for identifying strategically important molecular substitutions to improve solubility. As such, this approach could be a useful predictive tool for rational compound design in the early stages of drug development.", 
    "86": "DYT1 dystonia is a movement disorder caused by a deletion in the C-terminal of the protein torsinA. It is unclear how torsinA mutation might disrupt cellular processes encoding motor activity, and whether this impairment occurs in specific brain regions. Here, we report a selective impairment of corticostriatal synaptic plasticity in knock-in mice heterozygous for \u0394-torsinA (Tor1a(+/\u0394gag) mice) as compared to controls (Tor1a(+/+) mice). In striatal spiny neurons from Tor1a(+/\u0394gag) mice, high-frequency stimulation failed to induce long-term depression (LTD), whereas long-term potentiation (LTP) exhibited increased amplitude. Of interest, blockade of D2 dopamine receptors (D2Rs) increased LTP in Tor1a(+/+) mice to a level comparable to that measured in Tor1a(+/\u0394gag) mice and normalized the levels of potentiation across mouse groups. A low-frequency stimulation (LFS) protocol was unable to depotentiate corticostriatal synapses in Tor1a(+/\u0394gag) mice. Muscarinic M1 acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) blockade rescued plasticity deficits. Additionally, we found an abnormal responsiveness of cholinergic interneurons to D2R activation, consisting in an excitatory response rather than the expected inhibition, further confirming an imbalance between dopaminergic and cholinergic signaling in the striatum. Conversely, synaptic activity and plasticity in the CA1 hippocampal region were unaltered in Tor1a(+/\u0394gag) mice. Importantly, the M1 mAChR-dependent enhancement of hippocampal LTP was unaffected in both genotypes. Similarly, both basic properties of dopaminergic nigral neurons and their responses to D2R activation were normal. These results provide evidence for a regional specificity of the electrophysiological abnormalities observed and demonstrate the reproducibility of such alterations in distinct models of DYT1 dystonia.",

Seizures in those with int dup(15) are less common, with a frequency similar to the general autism population. In addition to broad spectrum AED, medications such as carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are also relatively effective in controlling seizures in this population, suggesting a possible multifocal etiology, which may also explain the high rate of infantile spasms. Our small sample suggests a relative lack of efficacy of vigabatrin and other \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic medications, such as typical benzodiazepines, which may be attributable to abnormal GABAergic transmission resulting from the duplication of a cluster of GABA\u03b23 receptor genes in the 15q11.2-13 region.",

Using recombinant expression in oocytes combined with two electrode voltage clamp, we show with chimeric \u03b22/\u03b23 subunits that differences in alcohol sensitivity among \u03b2 subunits are determined by the extracellular N-terminal part of the protein. Furthermore, by using point mutations, we show that the \u03b23 alcohol selectivity is determined by a single amino acid residue in the N-terminus that differs between GABAR \u03b2 subunits (\u03b23Y66, \u03b22A66, \u03b21S66). The \u03b23Y66 residue is located in a region called \"loop D\" which in \u03b3 subunits contributes to the imidazobenzodiazepine (iBZ) binding site at the classical \u03b1+\u03b32- subunit interface. In structural homology models \u03b23Y66 is the equivalent of \u03b32T81 which is one of three critical residues lining the benzodiazepine binding site in the \u03b32 subunit loop D, opposite to the \"100H/R-site\" benzodiazepine binding residue in GABAR \u03b1 subunits. We have shown that the \u03b16R100Q mutation at this site leads to increased alcohol-induced motor in-coordination in alcohol non-tolerant rats carrying the \u03b16R100Q mutated allele. Based on the identification of these two amino acid residues \u03b16R100 and \u03b266 we propose a model in which \u03b23 and \u03b4 containing GABA receptors contain a unique ethanol site at the \u03b14/6+\u03b23- subunit interface. This site is homologous to the classical benzodiazepine binding site and we propose that it not only binds ethanol at relevant concentrations (EC50-17\u00a0mM), but also has high affinity for a few selected benzodiazepine site ligands including alcohol antagonistic iBZs (Ro15-4513, RY023, RY024, RY80) which have in common a large moiety at the C7 position of the benzodiazepine ring. We suggest that large moieties at the C7-BZ ring compete with alcohol for its binding pocket at a \u03b14/6+\u03b23- EtOH/Ro15-4513 site. This model reconciles many years of alcohol research on GABARs and provides a plausible explanation for the competitive relationship between ethanol and iBZ alcohol antagonists in which bulky moieties at the C7 position compete with ethanol for its binding site. We conclude with a critical discussion to suggest that much of the controversy surrounding this issue might be due to fundamental species differences in alcohol and alcohol antagonist responses in rats and mice.", 
    "97": "Diazepam is often used as an adjuvant to pain therapy. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and 2C19 metabolize diazepam into the active metabolites: nordiazepam, temazepam and oxazepam. Owing to diazepam's side-effect profile, mortality risk and potential for drug-drug interactions with CYP 3A4 and/or CYP 2C19 inhibitors, urine drug testing (UDT) could be a helpful monitoring tool. This was a retrospective data analysis that evaluated urine specimens from pain management practices for the distribution of diazepam metabolites with and without CYP 3A4 and 2C19 inhibitors. Intersubject nordiazepam, temazepam and oxazepam geometric mean fractions were 0.16, 0.34 and 0.47, respectively. Intrasubject geometric mean fractions were 0.157, 0.311 and 0.494, respectively. Sex, but not age or urinary pH, had an effect on metabolite fractions. Methadone significantly increased temazepam and oxazepam urinary fractions via CYP3A4 inhibition, whereas fluoxetine and esomeprazole increased nordiazepam fractions via CYP2C19 inhibition. Although more studies are needed, these results suggest the viability of UDT for increased monitoring for therapy and possible drug-drug interactions.",

    "136": "The beneficial effects of vitamin D3 are exerted through 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3], the dihydroxy metabolite of vitamin D3. Hepatic and intestinal biotransformation of 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 and modifiers of metabolic capacity could be important determinants of bioavailability in serum and tissues. Ginsenosides and their aglycones, mainly 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (aPPD) and 20(S)-protopanaxatriol (aPPT), are routinely ingested as health supplements. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the potential of ginsenosides and their aglycones to block hepatic and intestinal inactivation of 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3, which is the most potent ligand of vitamin D receptor. In vitro biotransformation reactions were initiated with NADPH regenerating solutions following initial preincubation of pooled human hepatic or intestinal microsomal protein or human recombinant CYP3A4 supersomes with 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 or midazolam. Formation of hydroxylated metabolites of 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 or midazolam was analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Co-incubation of 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 with various ginsenosides (Rg1, Rh2, aPPD, aPPT and total ginsenosides) led to differential inhibition (30-100%) of its hydroxylation. Results suggest that aPPD, aPPT and Rh2 strongly attenuated the hydroxylation of 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3. Follow up inhibition studies with aPPD and aPPT at varying concentrations (0.5-100\u03bcM) led to up to 91-100% inhibition of formation of hydroxylated metabolites of 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 thus preventing inactivation of active vitamin D3. The IC50 values of aPPD or aPPT for the most abundant hydroxylated metabolites of 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 ranged from 3.3 to 9.0\u03bcM in human microsomes. The inhibitory mechanism of aPPD or aPPT for CYP3A4-mediated biotransformation of 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 was competitive in nature (apparent Ki: 1.7-2.9\u03bcM). Similar inhibitory effects were also observed upon addition of aPPD or aPPT into midazolam hydroxylation assay.

Also, alterations in synaptic response to paired-pulse stimulation were improved. The present study further investigated some molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of 6 months of voluntary exercise on synaptic plasticity in 7-month-old 3xTg-AD mice. Changes in binding parameters of [(3)H]-flunitrazepam to GABAA receptor and of [(3)H]-MK-801 to NMDA receptor in cerebral cortex of 3xTgAD mice were restored by voluntary exercise.

We investigated, for the first time, the effects of \u03b1-thujone or \u03b2-thujone administrated centrally on the fear/anxiety behaviour of 3-day-old chicks in an Open Field and their modulation on the GABAA receptor. Higher doses were convulsant by eliciting a toxic and excitatory action, with the results showing that a dose of 78 nmol of either of the two diastereoisomers had an anxiogenic-like effect observed as an increased latency to ambulate and a reduced locomotor activity in an Open Field. Nevertheless, only the central administration of \u03b1-thujone reversed the increase induced by acute stress in the flunitrazepam-sensitive GABAA receptor recruitment. These findings demonstrated that \u03b1-thujone, when intracerebroventricularly administered, suppressed the GABAA receptor recruitment induced by acute stress, maybe due to \u03b1-thujone blocking the benzodiazepine binding site or another site of the GABAA complex. However, it should not be discarded that acute stress associated with novelty may have induced the recruitment of a subpopulation of GABAA receptors more sensitive to \u03b1-thujone than to the constitutive receptors, or that this monoterpene could have inhibited any protein or enzyme trafficking that modulated the phosphorylation of the receptor involved in the turnover of GABAA receptor. \u03b2-Thujone showed behavioural effects similar to its diastereoisomer \u03b1-thujone. However, its action mechanism may have been mediated by other neurotransmitter systems, such as the serotonergic one or by a different biological effectiveness due to a distinct stereochemistry at the specific site of the GABAA receptor.",

Research in our laboratory has focused on the relationship between stress, the subsequent activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and psychomotor stimulant reinforcement for almost 30 years. This research has led to the development of a combination of low doses of the cortisol synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone, and the benzodiazepine, oxazepam, as a potential pharmacological treatment for cocaine and other substance use disorders. In fact, we have conducted a pilot clinical trial that demonstrated that this combination can reduce cocaine craving and cocaine use. Our initial hypothesis underlying this effect was that the combination of metyrapone and oxazepam reduced cocaine seeking and taking by decreasing activity within the HPA axis. Even so, doses of the metyrapone and oxazepam combination that consistently reduced cocaine taking and seeking did not reliably alter plasma corticosterone (or cortisol in the pilot clinical trial). Furthermore, subsequent research has demonstrated that this drug combination is effective in adrenalectomized rats, suggesting that these effects must be mediated above the level of the adrenal gland. Our evolving hypothesis is that the combination of metyrapone and oxazepam produces its effects by increasing the levels of neuroactive steroids, most notably tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone, in the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Additional research will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis and may lead to the development of improved and specific pharmacotherapies for the treatment of psychomotor stimulant use.",

    "169": "The mesolimbic reward system is primarily comprised of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc) as well as their afferent and efferent connections. This circuitry is essential for learning about stimuli associated with motivationally-relevant outcomes. Moreover, addictive drugs affect and remodel this system, which may underlie their addictive properties. In addition to dopamine (DA) neurons, the VTA also contains approximately 30% \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons. The task of signaling both rewarding and aversive events from the VTA to the NAc has mostly been ascribed to DA neurons and the role of GABA neurons has been largely neglected until recently. GABA neurons provide local inhibition of DA neurons and also long-range inhibition of projection regions, including the NAc. Here we review studies using a combination of in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiology, pharmacogenetic and optogenetic manipulations that have characterized the functional neuroanatomy of inhibitory circuits in the mesolimbic system, and describe how GABA neurons of the VTA regulate reward and aversion-related learning. We also discuss pharmacogenetic manipulation of this system with benzodiazepines (BDZs), a class of addictive drugs, which act directly on GABAA receptors located on GABA neurons of the VTA. The results gathered with each of these approaches suggest that VTA GABA neurons bi-directionally modulate activity of local DA neurons, underlying reward or aversion at the behavioral level. Conversely, long-range GABA projections from the VTA to the NAc selectively target cholinergic interneurons (CINs) to pause their firing and temporarily reduce cholinergic tone in the NAc, which modulates associative learning. Further characterization of inhibitory circuit function within and beyond the VTA is needed in order to fully understand the function of the mesolimbic system under normal and pathological conditions.",

We report on SH-I-048A, a newly synthesized chiral positive modulator of GABAA receptors characterized by exceptional subnanomolar affinity, high efficacy and non-selectivity. Its influence on behavior was assessed in Wistar rats and contrasted to that obtained with 2mg/kg diazepam. SH-I-048A reached micromolar concentrations in brain tissue, while the unbound fraction in brain homogenate was around 1.5%. The approximated electrophysiological responses, which estimated free concentrations of SH-I-048A or diazepam are able to elicit, suggested a similarity between the 10mg/kg dose of the novel ligand and 2mg/kg diazepam; however, SH-I-048A was relatively more active at \u03b11- and \u03b15-containing GABAA receptors. Behaviorally, SH-I-048A induced sedative, muscle relaxant and ataxic effects, reversed mechanical hyperalgesia 24h after injury, while it was devoid of clear anxiolytic actions and did not affect water-maze performance. While lack of clear anxiolytic actions may be connected with an enhanced potentiation at \u03b11-containing GABAA receptors, the observed behavior in the rotarod, water maze and peripheral nerve injury tests was possibly affected by its prominent action at receptors containing the \u03b15 subunit. The current results encourage further innovative approaches aimed at linking in vitro and in vivo data in order to help define fine-tuning mechanisms at four sensitive receptor populations that underlie subtle differences in behavioral profiles of benzodiazepine site ligands.",

Overall, the quality of the evidence from pooled studies was low or had unclear risk of bias. Four trials compared clonidine with a placebo or no treatment, six trials compared clonidine with midazolam, and one trial compared clonidine with fentanyl. There was substantial methodological heterogeneity between trials; the dose and route of clonidine administration varied as did the patient populations, the types of surgery and the outcomes measured. It was therefore difficult to combine the outcomes of some trials for meta-analysis.When clonidine was compared to placebo, pooling studies of low or unclear risk of bias, the need for additional analgesia was reduced when clonidine premedication was given orally at 4 \u00b5g/kg (risk ratio (RR) 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.51). Only one small trial (15 patients per arm) compared clonidine to midazolam for the same outcome; this also found a reduction in the need for additional postoperative analgesia (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.71) when clonidine premedication was given orally at 2 or 4 \u00b5g/kg compared to oral midazolam at 0.5 mg/kg. A trial comparing oral clonidine at 4 \u00b5g/kg with intravenous fentanyl at 3 \u00b5g/kg found no statistically significant difference in the need for rescue analgesia (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.42). When clonidine 4 \u00b5g/kg was compared to clonidine 2 \u00b5g/kg, there was a statistically significant difference in the number of patients requiring additional analgesia, in favour of the higher dose, as reported by a single, higher-quality trial (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.65).The effect of clonidine on pain scores was hard to interpret due to differences in study methodology, the doses and route of drug administration, and the pain scale used. However, when given at a dose of 4 \u00b5g/kg, clonidine may have reduced analgesia requirements after surgery. There were no significant side effects of clonidine that were reported such as severe hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive sedation requiring intervention. However, several studies used atropine prophylactically with the aim of preventing such adverse effects.",

Side effects were minimal, but some of the studies used atropine prophylactically with the intention of preventing bradycardia and hypotension.

Ghrelin is an orexigenic hormone secreted mainly from the stomach, which can induce weight gain and hyperphagia through regulating neuropeptides at the hypothalamus. Accumulating evidence implicates a relationship between ghrelin signalling and SGA-induced hyperphagia and weight gain. We report that olanzapine (a SGA with high weight gain liability) potently and time-dependently up-regulate ghrelin and ghrelin signalling, leading to hyperphagia and weight gain in female Sprague-Dawley rats, an action reversed by i.c.v. injection of a ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a) antagonist.

One of the dead was liver and kidneys, and two were kidneys donors.", 
    "213": "Imbalance of inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission has been proposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). This study aimed to investigate whether [(18)F]-flumazenil ([(18)F]-FMZ) PET could be used to non-invasively characterise GABAA/central benzodiazepine receptor (GABAA/cBZR) density and affinity in vivo in the post-kainic acid status epilepticus (SE) model of TLE.", 
    "214": "Dynamic [(18)F]-FMZ -PET scans using a multi-injection protocol were acquired in four male wistar rats for validation of the partial saturation model (PSM). SE was induced in eight male Wistar rats (10 weeks of age) by i.p. injection of kainic acid (7.5-25 mg/kg), while control rats (n\u200a=\u200a7) received saline injections. Five weeks post-SE, an anatomic MRI scan was acquired and the following week an [(18)F]-FMZ PET scan (3.6-4.6 nmol). The PET data was co-registered to the MRI and regions of interest drawn on the MRI for selected structures. A PSM was used to derive receptor density and apparent affinity from the [(18)F]-FMZ PET data.", 
    "215": "The PSM was found to adequately model [(18)F]-FMZ binding in vivo. There was a significant decrease in hippocampal receptor density in the SE group (p<0.01), accompanied by an increase in apparent affinity (p<0.05) compared to controls. No change in cortical receptor binding was observed. Hippocampal volume reduction and cell loss was only seen in a subset of animals. Histological assessment of hippocampal cell loss was significantly correlated with hippocampal volume measured by MRI (p<0.05), but did not correlate with [(18)F]-FMZ binding.", 
    "216": "Alterations to hippocampal GABAA/cBZR density and affinity in the post-kainic acid SE model of TLE are detectable in vivo with [(18)F]-FMZ PET and a PSM. These changes are independent from hippocampal cell and volume loss. [(18)F]-FMZ PET is useful for investigating the role that changes GABAA/cBZR density and binding affinity play in the pathogenesis of TLE.", 
    "217": "Eighteen female New Zealand White rabbits (3.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009kg) were anaesthetized with sufentanil-midazolam by intravenous infusion (SUF-MID, n\u2009=\u20099) or isoflurane (ISO, n\u2009=\u20099) for bilateral creation of an osteochondral defect in the medial femur condyle. Subcutaneous premedication with 0.1\u2009mg/kg medetomidine and anaesthesia induction by intravenous infusion of 1.1\u2009\u00b5g/kg sufentanil and 0.2\u2009mg/kg midazolam were identical in both groups. During surgery (60\u2009min), the effects on respiratory and circulatory variables serum lactate, total protein and blood glucose were examined. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) was initiated if apnoea lasted>30\u2009s or if end-tidal CO2 \u22658\u2009kPa. The righting reflex was lost in 3\u2009min. IPPV was necessary during most of the anaesthesia for most of the rabbits. Maintenance doses during surgery were 2.0\u2009\u00b5g/kg/h sufentanil and 0.4\u2009mg/kg/h midazolam, and 1.4% isoflurane, respectively. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was higher in group SUF-MID than group ISO during surgery (63\u2009\u00b1\u200912 vs 50\u2009\u00b1\u20098\u2009mmHg). In group ISO the heart rate was higher during surgery than before anaesthesia (197\u2009\u00b1\u200926 vs 158\u2009\u00b1\u200940 bpm) as was blood glucose (9\u2009\u00b1\u20092 vs 12\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u2009mmol/L). Serum lactate levels remained unchanged whereas total protein decreased in both groups. Time to recover from anaesthesia did not differ between groups (20\u2009min). Intravenous sufentanil-midazolam infusion provided surgical anaesthesia with a higher MAP than isoflurane anaesthesia. The protocol can be useful in situations in which gas anaesthesia cannot be used or in animals with limited cardiovascular reserves. However, IPPV is necessary.", 
    "218": "Trials of novel compounds for the treatment of schizophrenia are typically tested in patients following brief withdrawal of ongoing medication despite known long-term changes in the dopamine (DA) system following chronic antipsychotic drug therapy. The present study explored the impact of withdrawal from repeated haloperidol (HAL) treatment, as well as the response to a novel \u03b15 gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor positive allosteric modulator (\u03b15PAM), on the activity of the DA system in the methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia. Electrophysiological recordings were conducted from DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area of MAM and saline (SAL) rats following 7-day withdrawal from repeated HAL (21 d, 0.6 mg/kg, orally). In separate animals, amphetamine-induced locomotion was measured to assess changes in DA behavioral sensitivity. SAL rats withdrawn from HAL demonstrated reduced spontaneous DA neuron activity along with an enhanced locomotor response to amphetamine, indicative of the development of DA supersensitivity. Both \u03b15PAM treatment and ventral hippocampal (vHPC) inactivation reversed the DA neuron depolarization block following HAL withdrawal in SAL rats. In contrast, MAM rats withdrawn from HAL exhibited reduced spontaneous DA activity and enhanced locomotor response to amphetamine compared with untreated SAL rats; however, this condition was unresponsive to \u03b15PAM treatment or vHPC inactivation. Withdrawal from prior HAL treatment interferes with the therapeutic actions of this novel treatment in the MAM model of schizophrenia. Consequently, testing novel compounds on chronically treated schizophrenia patients may be ineffective.", 
    "219": "Human arylacetamide deacetylase (AADAC) catalyzes the hydrolysis of some clinically used drugs, but the information available on its substrates is limited. To increase our knowledge of the AADAC substrates, we examined whether AADAC catalyzes the hydrolysis of indiplon, which was initially developed as a hypnotic sedative drug. It has been reported that approximately 30-40% of the administered indiplon was hydrolyzed to deacetylindiplon in humans, but the enzyme responsible for this hydrolysis had not been identified. We detected high levels of indiplon hydrolase activity in human liver microsomes (HLMs), but the levels found in human liver cytosol and plasma were scarcely detectable. Recombinant AADAC showed a high level of indiplon hydrolase activity, whereas recombinant carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) and 2 (CES2) showed marginal activity. The indiplon hydrolase activity of HLM was potently inhibited by vinblastine, a potent inhibitor of AADAC and CES2, but it was not inhibited by digitonin and telmisartan, inhibitors of CES1 and CES2, respectively. In a panel of 24 individual HLM samples, the indiplon hydrolase activities were significantly correlated with the hydrolase activities of flutamide, phenacetin, and rifampicin, which are known AADAC substrates. An HLM sample with a homozygous AADAC*3 allele, which was previously found to exhibit decreased enzyme activity, showed the lowest indiplon hydrolase activity among the 24 tested samples. Collectively, we found that human AADAC is responsible for the hydrolysis of indiplon. Thus, we can add indiplon to the list of human AADAC substrates.", 
    "220": "The effects of mitragynine on anxiety-related behaviours in the open-field and elevated plus-maze tests were evaluated. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally treated with mitragynine (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) or diazepam (10 mg/kg) 60 min before behavioural testing. Mitragynine doses used in this study were selected on the basis of approximately human equivalent doses with reference to our previous literature reports. Acute administration of mitragynine (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) or diazepam (10 mg/kg) increased central zone and open arms exploration in the open-field and elevated plus-maze tests respectively. These anxiolytic-like effects of mitragynine were effectively antagonized by intraperitoneal administration of naloxone (2 mg/kg), flumazenil (10 mg/kg), sulpiride (0.5 mg/kg) or SCH 23390 (0.02 mg/kg) 15 min before mitragynine treatments. These findings reveal that the acute administration of mitragynine produces anxiolytic-like effects and this could be possibly attributed to the interactions among opioidergic, GABAergic and dopaminergic systems in brain regions involved in anxiety."
