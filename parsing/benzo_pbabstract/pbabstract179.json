We have previously shown that the decrease in pLMV is associated with specific and transient withdrawal signs. In the present study, the selective benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist flumazenil significantly antagonized (P<0.05), by co-application, the ability of each agonist to produce the withdrawal. These results: (1) suggest that benzodiazepine-receptor agonists, for two different chemical categories, produce dose-related physical dependence manifested as abstinence-induced withdrawal in this simple and convenient model, and (2) in the absence of cloning or radioligand binding literature, suggest a possible specific interaction site (receptor?) for these compounds in planarians.",

The medical records of 539 intravenous sedation patients treated at the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic at our institution were retrospectively evaluated to determine the incidence of failed sedation. Patients sedated with midazolam and fentanyl were placed in group A. There were 323 patients in group A. We placed patients sedated with midazolam, fentanyl and methohexital into group B. There were 216 patients in group B. The gender, medical history, type of procedure being performed, amount of drug given, and the patient's vital signs throughout the procedure were recorded.", 
    "3": "There were 9 failed sedations with a rate of 1.6% (9/539); 3 in group B (1%) and 6 in group A (2%). Five of our failures were undergoing multiple tooth extractions. Two of the failures were undergoing surgical removal of impacted third molars. Two patients underwent mandibular fracture reduction. Failure was attributed to increased agitation and combativeness, uncontrolled hypertension, tachycardia and desaturation.", 
    "4": "The mandible fracture population and multiple teeth extraction patients had higher rates of failure than other groups. This may be the result of procedure length, type of procedure, or a preoperative anxiety and attitude toward treatment expressed by the patient making sedation unpredictable. Level of training and experience of the practitioner may contribute to sedation failure. These results allow us to develop a prospective study protocol of outpatient sedation and to quantify more detailed information about preoperative anxiety, medical status, and social history than we had available during our chart review. More specific conclusions may help us determine if certain patient populations are at a higher risk for failed sedations.",

    "12": "We applied diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) in the pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) model to investigate the evolution of acute phase changes in brain diffusion with and without early anticonvulsive therapy correlated to long-term SE-induced neuronal cell loss. Hereby, DWI was performed before (baseline) and serially between 3 and 120 min after onset of SE in untreated and treated animals (n=15 in each group). Anticonvulsive-treated animals received 20 mg/kg diazepam at 15 min after onset of SE. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) were calculated for the parietal, temporal and piriform cortex, thalamus, hippocampus and amygdala and compared to baseline. Neuronal cell loss was quantified at 2 weeks after onset of SE utilizing cresyle-violet-staining. The results of ADC-mapping demonstrated a significant transient increase in ADC (to 116+/-4% of baseline) in the very acute phase starting 3 min after SE onset, lasting for 10 min in both groups. In untreated animals, there was a significant gradual decline in ADC to 75+/-12% of baseline while this decline in diazepam-treated animals was significantly less pronounced (P<0.05) and ADC recovered to 93+/-6% of baseline. There was good correlation between neuronal cell loss in specific brain regions at 2 weeks after SE and maximal decrease in ADC (r>0.79). In conclusion, serial DWI is a sensitive noninvasive technique for early detection, monitoring and prediction of SE-induced neuronal alterations. Using ADC-mapping, verification of early anticonvulsive therapy in SE seems to be possible as there is good correlation between the maximal decrease in ACD in the acute phase of SE and late neuronal cell loss.",

Safety concerns limit the use of benzodiazepines and antipsychotic medications in the elderly individual, making anticonvulsants an attractive alternative. This paper reviews three specific anticonvulsants for this purpose: gabapentin, oxcarbazepine and topiramate, describing safety and efficacy in elderly patients with severe agitation from psychosis or dementia. Gabapentin, renally excreted, with a half-life of 6.5-10.5 h, may cause ataxia. Oxcarbazapine, hepatically reduced, may cause hyponatremia, and topiramate may cause significant cognitive impairment. Nonetheless, these are important medications to consider in the treatment of agitation.",

Of the 37 (23%) clients who tested positive for ACP, 23 (62%) were interviewed. A profile of zopiclone misusers is outlined, including details of demographics, drug history, viral status, recent urinalysis results and opinions on zopiclone. Of the 14 (38%) clients who were not interviewed, information was obtained from their clinical casenotes and documented urinalysis results. The prevalence of zopiclone misuse was reported as 23%. Benzodiazepines were the most popular drug of misuse with zopiclone followed by heroin/opiates. Zopiclone is being misused by drug users in Dublin in the context of many other drugs. Prescribing of zopiclone should be restricted, especially among drug misusers.", 
    "22": "This study analyzed indicators of alcohol-related problems in opiate addicts before, during, and after leaving methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), in relation to illicit drug use and retention in treatment. The study was based on 204 patients, admitted to MMT for the first time between 1 January 1995 and 31 July 2000, and followed until 31 December 2000. Three measures were used to indicate alcohol use and alcohol-related problems; records of hospital care with an alcohol-related diagnosis, any treatment with alcohol-sensitizing drugs (disulfiram or calcium carbimide) during MMT, and results of the 5-hydroxytryptophol to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid ratio (5HTOL/5HIAA) in urine, a sensitive biomarker for recent drinking. Use of illicit drugs was determined by routine urine drug testing. About one third of the patients (n = 69) had a lifetime prevalence of hospital treatment for an alcohol-related diagnosis, 45 of whom had been hospitalized (mean 4.2 stays) prior to the start of MMT. There was a significant association (p<0.05) between the number of alcohol-related diagnoses prior to treatment and a positive 5HTOL/5HIAA test during MMT. The alcohol indicators first became positive on average 1.6 years after admission to treatment, compared with after about 4 months for illicit drugs. Use of cannabis or benzodiazepines was significantly associated with alcohol use. Female methadone patients with indications of alcohol-related problems relapsed more often into illicit drug use than did women without such indications (3.9 vs. 2.5 relapse periods/year; p<0.005), whereas no significant association was found for men. The results of the present study indicate that drinking problems among patients undergoing MMT is associated with an increased risk of relapse into illicit drug use and with discharge from treatment. Concurrent treatment of alcohol-related problems, including systematic monitoring of alcohol use, therefore should be recommended to reduce the risk for relapse into illicit drug use and improve overall treatment outcome in MMT.",

Blockade of muscarinic M1 and M2-cholinoceptors had little effect on cardiac activity. Blockade of muscarinic M3-cholinoceptors was followed by heart acceleration. The data suggest that the tonic inhibitory influence of the vagus nerve is mediated via cardiac muscarinic M3-cholinoceptors. Electrostimulation of the right vagus nerve during selective blockade of various subtypes of muscarinic cholinoceptors was followed by the decrease in heart rate. Our results indicate that muscarinic cholinoceptors play a role in the immediate inhibition of cardiac activity upon vagus nerve stimulation.",

Inhibition of PARP-1 enhances the efficacy of DNA alkylating agents, topoisomerase I poisons, and ionizing radiation. Our aim was to identify a PARP inhibitor for clinical trial from a panel of 42 potent PARP inhibitors (K(i), 1.4-15.1 nmol/L) based on the quinazolinone, benzimidazole, tricyclic benzimidazole, tricyclic indole, and tricyclic indole-1-one core structures. We evaluated chemosensitization of temozolomide and topotecan using LoVo and SW620 human colorectal cells; in vitro radiosensitization was measured using LoVo cells, and the enhancement of antitumor activity of temozolomide was evaluated in mice bearing SW620 xenografts. Excellent chemopotentiation and radiopotentiation were observed in vitro, with 17 of the compounds causing a greater temozolomide and topotecan sensitization than the benchmark inhibitor AG14361 and 10 compounds were more potent radiosensitizers than AG14361. In tumor-bearing mice, none of the compounds were toxic when given alone, and the antitumor activity of the PARP inhibitor-temozolomide combinations was unrelated to toxicity. Compounds that were more potent chemosensitizers in vivo than AG14361 were also more potent in vitro, validating in vitro assays as a prescreen. These studies have identified a compound, AG14447, as a PARP inhibitor with outstanding in vivo chemosensitization potency at tolerable doses, which is at least 10 times more potent than the initial lead, AG14361. The phosphate salt of AG14447 (AG014699), which has improved aqueous solubility, has been selected for clinical trial.", 
    "28": "Anxiolytic therapy with the benzodiazepine alprazolam is an established therapy in patients with panic disorder. Normally, panic-like anxiety and its concomitant physical symptoms quickly disappear under such treatment. Therefore we investigated whether there is a difference in sympathetic nervous system in patients with panic disorder compared to healthy controls. Three groups of subjects were included: ten patients with panic disorder, who received alprazolam and 20 healthy control subjects who were given either alprazolam (n=10) or matching placebo (n=10). Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and heart rate did not differ at baseline but significantly increased both in patients and healthy controls after intake of alprazolam (1 mg). However, in both groups both MSNA and heart rate were significantly elevated when compared to both baseline and the placebo control group. This study demonstrates (1) that anxiolytic therapy with alprazolam increases muscle sympathetic nerve activity and heart rate not only in patients with panic disorder but also in healthy controls and (2) that a significant difference in sympathetic nervous system activity between patients and controls, at baseline and during the therapy with alprazolam could not be demonstrated.", 
    "29": "The restless legs syndrome (RLS), affecting between 3% and 15% of the population, is characterised by an urge to move the legs during wakefulness, associated with a range of unpleasant sensory symptoms, especially when sitting or lying down at night. The symptoms can even be painful, and lead to sleep disturbances and depression. RLS is treated with dopaminergic agents, anticonvulsants, opioids, clonidine and benzodiazepines. In a small percentage of cases, RLS is refractory to treatment, requiring combination therapy. Botulinum toxin (BTX), derived from the exotoxin of Clostridium botulinum, cleaves soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins, causing chemodenervation of cholinergic neurons. BTX has been demonstrated to ameliorate pain syndromes, possibly by reducing peripheral and central sensitization to pain. We postulate that BTX can be injected subcutaneously to the lower limbs to effect amelioration of the symptoms of RLS.", 
    "30": "Theophylline-associated seizures (TAS) are considered a neurologic emergency, as they can sometimes be intractable and difficult to stop with standard treatments such as intravenous administration of diazepam. As a consequence, a proportion of patients who experience status epilepticus while receiving theophylline will require endotracheal intubation. The optimal first-line therapy for TAS has not yet been fully investigated. We compared 54 cases of TAS with 779 cases of non-TAS, that had presented at a single institution between 1991 and 2002. Among the 54 cases of TAS, 36 experienced generalized tonic-clonic seizures, with the remainder experiencing partial seizures. TAS occurred mainly in children under 3 years of age, and serum theophylline levels were within the therapeutic range in 78% of the cases. The duration of TAS tended to be longer than for non-TAS, and intravenous administration of diazepam was less effective in controlling TAS (45%), compared with non-TAS (68%). Many cases required repeated injections of diazepam, and 15 cases (27%) eventually required endotracheal intubation. Reports concerning the therapy for TAS were also reviewed. Theophylline is known to antagonize the effects of benzodiazepines, and this may explain why drugs such as diazepam are relatively ineffective in treating TAS. In TAS, the prompt use of barbiturates is recommended when diazepam is not effective, to avoid potential brain injury secondary to status epilepticus.", 
    "31": "Convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) in childhood is a medical emergency and its aetiology and outcome mean that it should be studied separately from adult CSE. The incidence in developed countries is between 17 and 23/100,000 with a higher incidence in younger children. Febrile CSE is the commonest single group with a good prognosis in sharp distinction to CSE related to central nervous system infections which have a high mortality. The aim of treatment is to intervene at 5 min and studies indicate that intravenous (i.v.) lorazepam may be a better first-line treatment than rectal diazepam and i.v. phenytoin a better second-line treatment than rectal paraldehyde. An epidemiological study strongly supports the development of prehospital treatment with buccal midazolam becoming a widely used but unlicensed option in the community. More than two doses of benzodiazepines increase the rate of respiratory depression without obvious benefit. The 1 year recurrence rate is 17% and the hospital mortality is about 3%.", 
    "32": "Status epilepticus (SE) describes an enduring epileptic state during which seizures are unremitting and tend to be self-perpetuating. We describe the clinical phases of generalized convulsive SE, impending SE, established SE, and subtle SE. We discuss the physiological and biochemical cascades which characterize self-sustaining SE (SSSE) in animal models. At the transition from single seizures to SSSE, GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptors move from the synaptic membrane to the cytoplasm, where they are functionally inactive. This reduces the number of GABA(A) receptors available for binding GABA or GABAergic drugs, and may in part explain the development of time-dependent pharmacoresistance to benzodiazepines and the tendency of seizures to become self-sustaining. At the same time, 'spare' subunits of AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid) receptors move from subsynaptic sites to the synaptic membrane, causing further hyperexcitability and possibly explaining the preserved sensitivity to NMDA blockers late in the course of SE. Maladaptive changes in neuropeptide expression occur on a slower time course, with depletion of the inhibitory peptides dynorphin, galanin, somatostatin and neuropeptide Y, and with an increased expression of the proconvulsant tachykinins, substance P and neurokinin B. Finally, SE-induced neuronal injury and epileptogenesis are briefly discussed.", 
    "33": "The binding sites for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and GABA(A) receptor agonists are located differently from the binding sites for benzodiazepine receptor agonists. Furthermore, the major pharmacological effects of benzodiazepine receptor agonists and the GABA(A) receptor agonist gaboxadol (4,5,6,7-tetrahydrroisoxazolo(5,4-c)pyridin-3-ol, THIP) are mediated by different GABA(A) receptor subunit compositions; that is, gaboxadol may interact primarily with extra-synaptically located alpha(4)beta(2/3)delta-containing receptors and benzodiazepines with the synaptically located alpha(1)beta(2/3)gamma(2)-containing receptors.",

The onset of orthostatic myoclonus was accompanied by complaints of leg jerking or observed leg jerking in 13 of 15 patients during upright posture. An insidious deterioration of gait that was often described as \"apraxia\" or \"gait initiation difficulty\" accompanied the myoclonus in 13 of 15 patients.

    "44": "A reduction in GABAergic neurotransmission has been put forward as a pathophysiological mechanism for human epilepsy. However, in slices of human epileptogenic neocortex, GABAergic inhibition can be clearly demonstrated. In this article we present data showing an increase in the functional lability of GABAergic inhibition in epileptogenic tissue compared with nonepileptogenic human tissue. We have previously shown that the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH is the kinase involved in the glycolysis-dependent endogenous phosphorylation of the alpha1-subunit of GABA(A) receptor, a mechanism necessary for maintaining GABA(A) function. In human epileptogenic cortex obtained during curative surgery of patients with partial seizures, we demonstrate an intrinsic deficiency of GABA(A) receptor endogenous phosphorylation resulting in an increased lability of GABAergic currents in neurons isolated from this tissue when compared with neurons from nonepileptogenic human tissue. This feature was not related to a reduction in the number of GABA(A) receptor alpha1-subunits in the epileptogenic tissue as measured by [(3)H]flunitrazepam photoaffinity labeling. Maintaining the receptor in a phosphorylated state either by favoring the endogenous phosphorylation or by inhibiting a membrane-associated phosphatase is needed to sustain GABA(A) receptor responses in epileptogenic cortex. The increased functional lability induced by the deficiency in phosphorylation can account for transient GABAergic disinhibition favoring seizure initiation and propagation. These findings imply new therapeutic approaches and suggest a functional link to the regional cerebral glucose hypometabolism observed in patients with partial epilepsy, because the dysfunctional GABAergic mechanism depends on the locally produced glycolytic ATP.", 
    "45": "GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain, exerts its effects through multiple GABA(A) receptor subtypes with different pharmacological profiles, the alpha subunit variant mainly determining the binding properties of benzodiazepine site on the receptor protein. In adult experimental epileptic animals and in humans with epilepsy, increased excitation, i.e. seizures, alters GABA(A) receptor subunit expression leading to changes in the receptor structure, function, and pharmacology. Whether this also occurs in the developing brain, in which GABA has a trophic, excitatory effect, is not known. We have now applied autoradiography to study properties of GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptors in 9-day-old rats acutely (6 h) and sub-acutely (7 days) after kainic acid-induced status epilepticus by analyzing displacement of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding by zolpidem, a ligand selective for the alpha1beta2gamma2 receptor subtype. Regional changes in the binding properties were further corroborated at the cellular level by immunocytochemistry. The results revealed that status epilepticus significantly decreased displacement of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding by zolpidem 6 h after the kainic acid-treatment in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, parietal cortex, and thalamus, and in the hippocampal CA3 and CA1 cell layers 1 week after the treatment. Our results suggest that status epilepticus modifies region-specifically the pharmacological properties of GABA(A) receptors, and may thus disturb the normal, strictly developmentally-regulated maturation of zolpidem-sensitive GABA(A) receptors in the immature rat brain. A part of these changes could be due to alterations in the cell surface expression of receptor subtypes.", 
    "46": "Local GABAergic circuits trigger visual cortical plasticity in early postnatal life. How these diverse connections contribute to critical period onset was investigated by nonstationary fluctuation analysis following laser photo-uncaging of GABA onto discrete sites upon individual pyramidal cells in slices of mouse visual cortex. The GABA(A) receptor number decreased on the soma-proximal dendrite (SPD), but not at the axon initial segment, with age and sensory deprivation. Benzodiazepine sensitivity was also higher on the immature SPD. Too many or too few SPD receptors in immature or dark-reared mice, respectively, were adjusted to critical period levels by benzodiazepine treatment in vivo, which engages ocular dominance plasticity in these animal models. Combining GAD65 deletion with dark rearing from birth confirmed that an intermediate number of SPD receptors enable plasticity. Site-specific optimization of perisomatic GABA response may thus trigger experience-dependent development in visual cortex.",

The majority of patients demonstrate thymic hyperplasia and have been shown to benefit from thymectomy. The main considerations for the anesthesiologist are the degree of muscle weakness, the muscle groups involved and sensitivity to neuromuscular blocking drugs and volatile agents. Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with epidural analgesia is probably the anesthetic technique of choice, although the latter is often avoided, because of the risk of a very high block. Two cases of thymectomy are presented where anesthesia was provided using a combination of TIVA and thoracic epidural analgesia.

    "51": "In this study of nonventilated children in PICU undergoing central line placement, M/F and M/K provided a clinically comparable total sedation time. However, the M/K sedation regimen was associated with a higher rate of minor complications. A longer period of study is required to assess the efficacy and safety of these sedative agents for PICU procedures in nonintubated children.", 
    "52": "Behavioral disturbance in children following sevoflurane anesthesia is a relatively frequent event. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a higher dose of preoperatively administered rectal midazolam compared with a lower would alleviate this phenomenon. Furthermore the impact of these two doses of midazolam on sedation at induction of anesthesia was compared.", 
    "53": "A total of 115 children presenting for minor surgery under anesthesia were included in the study. The children were randomized to receive rectally either 1 mg.kg(-1) midazolam (group H) or 0.5 mg.kg(-1) midazolam (group L). General anesthesia was induced with propofol or sevoflurane and maintained with 1.5% sevoflurane in the inspiratory limb. Prior to the start of surgery a regional block was performed to ensure adequate pain relief. Behavior on emergence was assessed using a three point scale. In case of severe agitation propofol was administered IV.", 
    "54": "The children in group H were significantly better sedated preoperatively (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in emergence behavior: 42.1% of children in group H compared with 36.2% of children in group L exhibited severe agitation requiring sedation with propofol (P = 0.37). However, regardless of the preoperative dose of midazolam more children under the age of 36 months (61.4%) were severely distressed at emergence compared with older children (16.7%) (P < 0.01).", 
    "55": "A higher dose of 1 mg.kg(-1) rectal midazolam results in much better sedated children on induction of anesthesia than 0.5 mg.kg(-1). This, however, does not result in a reduced incidence of emergence delirium after sevoflurane anesthesia. Regardless of the premedication negative behavioral changes occur more frequently in children younger than 3 years of age.", 
    "56": "In drug-drug interaction (DDI) research, a two drug interaction is usually predicted by individual drug pharmacokinetics (PK). Although subject-specific drug concentration data from clinical PK studies on inhibitor/inducer or substrate's PK are not usually published, sample mean plasma drug concentrations and their standard deviations have been routinely reported. In this paper, an innovative DDI prediction method based on a three-level hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis model is developed. The first level model is a study-specific sample mean model; the second level model is a random effect model connecting different PK studies; and all priors of PK parameters are specified in the third level model. A Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) PK parameter estimation procedure is developed, and DDI prediction for a future study is conducted based on the PK models of two drugs and posterior distributions of the PK parameters. The performance of Bayesian meta-analysis in DDI prediction is demonstrated through a ketoconazole-midazolam example. The biases of DDI prediction are evaluated through statistical simulation studies. The DDI marker, ratio of area under the concentration curves, is predicted with little bias (less than 5 per cent), and its 90 per cent credible interval coverage rate is close to the nominal level. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to justify prior distribution selections.",

Similar effect was found only in the case of non-estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells MDA-MB 231. It suggest that PBR-ligand mediated inhibition of mitogenesis may represent a new anticancer strategy in non-estrogen-dependent breast cancer. In respect to macrophages inhibition of the cell division by both PBR ligands may have implication in modulation of inflammatory response. It has been postulated that PBR ligands may have anti-inflammatory activity in rheumatoid arthritis.

Physicians minimized other risks of benzodiazepines and did not view monitoring or restricting renewal of prescriptions as an important clinical focus relative to higher-priority medical issues. Many physicians expressed skepticism about risks of continued use and considerable pessimism in the successful taper/discontinuation in older patients with long-term use and prior failed attempts. Physicians also anticipated patient resistance to any such efforts, including switching physicians.",

None of the patients had been assessed using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA-Ar) scale. Patients at one hospital received substantially higher mean diazepam doses (64 mg v. 26 mg; p < 0.001) than did the patients at the other hospital, and the patients at the first hospital had fewer seizures during their emergency department stay (1% v. 9%; p = 0.012). Patients spent an average of 9 hours and 40 minutes in the emergency department.", 
    "77": "There is significant variability in the documentation and treatment of alcohol withdrawal. Lower benzodiazepine doses are associated with higher rate of withdrawal seizures and prolonged emergency department length of stay. A standardized approach using symptom-triggered management is likely to improve outcomes for patients presenting with alcohol withdrawal.", 
    "78": "Spatial memory has been strongly associated with hippocampal function. There are several reports of the participation of this structure in acquisition and consolidation of spatial tasks. In this study, we evaluated the effects of selective and non-selective muscarinic antagonists in the dorsal hippocampus of rats during acquisition and encoding of a spatial task. Rats were trained in a Morris water maze for 4 days with identical daily sessions, and tested for long-term memory (LTM) 1 week after training. The animals were injected bilaterally in the dorsal hippocampus 20 min before the start of every day of training. The results showed that the non-selective muscarinic antagonist, scopolamine, disrupted acquisition of water maze memory formation. Moreover, microinjections of a selective postsynaptic muscarinic antagonist, pirenzepine, disrupted LTM, whereas it did not affect acquisition. Conversely, a selective presynaptic muscarinic antagonist, AFDX-116, did not disrupt either water maze acquisition or LTM formation. Combination of AFDX-116 and pirenzepine had similar effects as scopolamine, partially blocking acquisition and impairing long-term spatial memory. These results support the view that muscarinic receptors are involved in spatial learning and that postsynaptic muscarinic receptors in the dorsal hippocampus are particularly involved in long-term spatial memory formation.",

This review details studies of PET tracers aimed at interrogating cholinergic, serotonergic, opiate, benzodiazepine, and inflammatory pathways as well as PET tracers that illuminate amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in AD. Progress has been remarkable. Together with studies of brain structure with MRI and of functional regional brain activity, e.g., through measures of blood flow and glucose metabolic rate, molecular imaging promises to dramatically alter our understanding of the structural and physiological abnormalities underlying AD symptomatology. A more immediate impact on the diagnosis and treatment evaluation of AD patients in clinical trials is predicted while the possibility of personalized treatment or prevention of AD may not be that far away.", 
    "84": "Activated microglia have been proposed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of Huntington's Disease (HD). PK11195 is a ligand which binds selectively to peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites, a type of receptor selectively expressed by activated microglia in the central nervous system. Using (11)C-(R)-PK11195 positron emission tomography (PET), we have recently shown in vivo evidence of increased microglial activation in both symptomatic and presymptomatic HD gene carriers and that the degree of microglial activation in the striatum correlates with the severity of striatal dopamine D2 receptor dysfunction measured with (11)C-raclopride PET. Our findings indicate that microglial activation is an early process in the HD pathology, occurring before the onset of symptoms. The close spatial and temporal relationship between microglial activation and neuronal dysfunction lends further support to the pathogenic link between the two processes in HD. Further longitudinal studies are needed to fully elucidate this link.", 
    "85": "Nitrous oxide (N(2)O) has been used for well over 150 years in clinical dentistry for its analgesic and anxiolytic properties. This small and simple inorganic chemical molecule has indisputable effects of analgesia, anxiolysis, and anesthesia that are of great clinical interest. Recent studies have helped to clarify the analgesic mechanisms of N(2)O, but the mechanisms involved in its anxiolytic and anesthetic actions remain less clear. Findings to date indicate that the analgesic effect of N(2)O is opioid in nature, and, like morphine, may involve a myriad of neuromodulators in the spinal cord. The anxiolytic effect of N(2)O, on the other hand, resembles that of benzodiazepines and may be initiated at selected subunits of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor. Similarly, the anesthetic effect of N(2)O may involve actions at GABA(A) receptors and possibly at N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors as well. This article reviews the latest information on the proposed modes of action for these clinical effects of N(2)O.",

All patients had been pre-assessed and deemed to be of sufficient mental and physical maturity to be treated with IVCS. Written informed consent was gained from patients and their parents/guardians with full discussion of the alternative pain and anxiety control methods available including GA. All cases were undertaken by experienced SAS grade surgeons assisted by two dental nurses holding the certificate in dental sedation nursing and their recovery was supervised by registered general nurses. Patients were clinically monitored throughout together with continuous pulse oximetry and intermittent recording of non invasive blood pressure and pulse at 10-15 minute intervals.

    "91": "Assessing foot shock sensitivity in rodents can be useful in identifying analgesic or hyperalgesic drugs, and phenotyping inbred or genetically altered mice. Furthermore, as foot shock is an integral part of several rodent behavioral models, sensitivity should also be assessed to accurately interpret behavioral measures from these models. To eliminate variability and increase the efficiency of manually scored shock sensitivity paradigms, we utilized a startle reflex system to automatically quantify responses to varying levels of foot shock. Eight inbred mouse strains were tested for reactivity to foot shock in this system, as well as inherent startle response activity to loud noise bursts. Strain rank order for shock reactivity differed from that for acoustic startle, suggesting that pathways activated in response to each differed. Analgesic doses of morphine and acetaminophen specifically reduced foot shock responses without affecting motor reflexive responses to loud noises in each strain tested. We also tested diazepam and scopolamine, which are often used to disrupt behavior in shock-related paradigms to illustrate the usefulness of this assay. Overall, these results demonstrate that our automated method is a quick and simple way to accurately assess potential foot shock sensitivity differences owing to strain, genotype or drug treatments.", 
    "92": "A new, simple, rapid, sensitive, and repeatable isocratic reverse-phase HPLC method was developed and validated for simultaneous determination of midazolam and its main three hydroxylated metabolites, i.e. 1'-hydroxymidazolam, 4-hydroxymidazolam, and 1',4-dihydroxymidazolam in rat liver perfusate and also plasma. Diazepam was used as an internal standard to ensure precision and accuracy of this method. Analytes were extracted from alkalinized samples into diethyl ether using single-step liquid-liquid extraction. A C18 analytical column and a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile and sodium acetate buffer were used for the chromatographic separation with UV detection. Limits of detection varied between 7.9 and 19.6 microg/L for midazolam and its hydroxy metabolites. The overall recovery for the analytes exceeded 92%, for concentrations twice the limits of detection. The intra- and inter-day precision at three different concentrations never exceeded 8 and 11% variation, respectively. This method is applicable for modeling and description of possible pharmacological interactions on rat (CYP3A1/2) or human (CYP3A4/5) cytochrome P450 enzymes.", 
    "93": "Binding of two bactericidal pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimers, SJG-136 and ELB-21, to genomic DNA from Staphylococcus aureus EMRSA-16 was investigated. Both agents cross-linked purified EMRSA-16 DNA. The more potent agent, ELB-21, had a greater capacity to cross-link DNA after incubation with intact cells than SJG-136. Extensive interstrand cross-linking at multiple sites on the EMRSA-16 genome was demonstrated by probing EcoRI-restricted DNA with mecA and 16S rDNA. Cross-linking was again greater in DNA extracted from ELB-21-treated cells and was compatible with frequency analysis of preferred binding sequences in EMRSA-16 DNA. These studies support the premise that the potency of ELB-21 is due to efficient cell penetration and provide evidence that the antibacterial activity of PBD dimers results from cross-linking at specific genomic sites.", 
    "94": "Alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) is a widely distributed hormone. This tridecapeptide exhibits various biological activities mediated through different receptors. alpha-MSH binds to the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1-R), mainly expressed in keratinocytes and melanocytes, inducing melanogenesis and anti-inflammatory processes. The central His-Phe-Arg-Trp tetrapeptide sequence of alpha-MSH is known to form a turn in the bioactive conformation. To find new potent analogs of alpha-MSH, we decided to introduce non-peptide building blocks in the alpha-MSH sequence. Molecular modeling studies showed that two amino acids of the central core sequence could be replaced by the benzodiazepinone building block without loosing the beta-turn conformation. Benzodiazepines are well-known pharmacophores exhibiting a wide scope of biological activities and are described as constrained dipeptide mimics templates. Although numerous synthetic pathways leading to benzodiazepinones have been described in literature, no methodology has 1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5-diones building blocks bearing a free carboxylic acid function and a protected amino function suitable for incorporation into peptide sequences. In this study, we report the synthesis of peptides with a benzodiazepinone moiety obtained directly during the course of solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). This \"on-line\" strategy leads to the generation of a 54-member pseudo-peptide library of alpha-MSH analogs. After LC/MS purification, binding assays were performed on the MC1 receptor leading to the discovery of several micromolar ligands.", 
    "95": "The chromanol 293B (293B, trans-6-cyano-4-(N-ethylsulfonyl-N-methylamino)-3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-chroman) is a lead compound of potential class III antiarrhythmics that inhibit cardiac I(Ks) potassium channels. These channels are formed by the coassembly of KCNQ1 (Kv7.1, KvLQT1) and KCNE1 subunits. Although homomeric KCNQ1 channels are the principal molecular targets, entry of KCNE1 to the channel complex enhances the chromanol block. Because closely related neuronal KCNQ2 potassium channels are insensitive to the drug, we used KCNQ1/KCNQ2 chimeras to identify the binding site of the inhibitor. We localized the putative drug receptor to the H5 selectivity filter and the S6 transmembrane segment. Single residues affecting 293B inhibition were subsequently identified through systematic exchange of amino acids that were either different in KCNQ1 and KCNQ2 or predicted by a docking model of 293B in the open and closed conformation of KCNQ1. Mutant channel proteins T312S, I337V, and F340Y displayed dramatically lowered sensitivity to chromanol block. The predicted drug binding receptor lies in the inner pore vestibule containing the lower part of the selectivity filter, and the S6 transmembrane domain also reported to be important for binding of benzodiazepines. We propose that the block of the ion permeation pathway involves hydrophobic interactions with the S6 transmembrane residues Ile337 and Phe340, and stabilization of chromanol 293B binding through electrostatic interactions of its oxygen atoms with the most internal potassium ion within the selectivity filter.", 
    "96": "The aims of the present study were: to characterize the mechanisms of hemodynamic alterations induced by GLP-2, and, to compare the responses elicited in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) to other vascular beds. Anesthetized rats were infused at the doses of 0.9, 2.3, 4.6 and 9.3 nmol/kg into the jugular vein for 60 min. Blood flow in the various arteries was measured by the ultrasonic transit time technique. Some animals were pretreated with indomethacin (5 mg/kg, ip), L-NAME (9, 18, 36 and 72 micromol/kg, iv), atropine sulfate (1-2 mg/kg, iv), CCK-1 and CCK-2 receptor antagonists (L-364,718 and L-365,260, 1 mg/kg, iv), exendin (9-39) amide (35 nmol/kg, iv) and lidocaine (74 micromol/kg, iv) prior to the infusion of GLP-2 (4.6 nmol/kg). In another group, capsaicin was applied either systematically (125 mg/kg, sc) or vagally (1 mg/rat). GLP-2 administration at all doses significantly increased the SMA blood flow throughout the experiments. GLP-2 (4.6 nmol/kg) infusion significantly increased blood flow of inferior mesenteric artery and carotid artery but not in any other vessel measured. Only the pretreatments with L-NAME and lidocaine were ineffective in preventing the GLP-2-induced responses. These results implicate that GLP-2-induced blood flow alterations are most significant in the SMA and are not mediated by prostaglandins, muscarinic, GLP-1 or CCK receptors. Our results also suggest that the stimulatory effect of GLP-2 on SMA blood flow is NO-dependent and mediated via intrinsic, non-cholinergic enteric neurons.",

    "99": "NONMEM population parameter estimates were in close agreement with those produced by the Bayesian analysis although there was a substantial shortening of run time for both the animal WBPBPK model (4.5 vs. 21 h) and human WBPBPK models (2 vs. 167 h). The adequacy of the model and the final parameter estimates were judged to be sufficient by the model's ability to describe individual tissue concentration-time profiles. The model provided a good overall description of the plasma concentration-time data in both rat and man with comparable parameter precision. A limited nonparametric bootstrap (n = 50) was performed to assess parameter sensitivity, bias and imprecision. No systematic bias was seen when comparing bootstrap means to final parameter estimates.",

    "101": "A novel ion gate for electrospray-ionization atmospheric-pressure ion-mobility spectrometry (ESI-IMS) has been constructed and evaluated. The ion gate consisted of a chopper wheel with two windows--one for periodic ion passage from the ESI source into the drift region and the other for timing and synchronization purposes. The instrument contained a 45.0 cm long drift tube comprising 78 stainless steel rings (0.12 cm thick, 4.90 cm o.d., 2.55 cm i.d.). The rings were connected together in series with 3.34-MOmega resistors. The interface plate and the back plate were also connected with the first and the last rings, respectively, of the drift tube with 3.34-MOmega resistors. A potential of -20.0 kV was applied to the back plate and the interface plate was grounded. The drift tube was maintained at an electric field strength of approximately 400 V cm-1. An aperture grid was attached to the last ring in front of a Faraday plate detector, center-to-center. Several sample solutions were electrosprayed at +5.0 kV with +500 V applied to the ion gate. Baseline separations of selected benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and antibiotics were observed with moderate experimental resolution of approximately 70.", 
    "102": "General practitioner (GP) prescribing has been identified as an arena that has broad social and political implications, which stretch beyond individual outcomes for patients. This article revisits aspects of the controversy about prescribing benzodiazepines (or 'minor tranquillizers') through an exploration of contemporary views of GPs. In the 1980s the prescribing of these drugs was considered to be both a clinical and social problem, which brought medical decision making under public scrutiny. The legacy of this controversy for recent GPs remains a relatively under-explored topic. This article describes a qualitative study of GPs practising in the north-west of England about their views of prescribing benzodiazepines. The accounts of the respondents highlight a number of points about: blame allocation, past and present; clinical challenges about risk management; and deserving and undeserving patients. These GP views are then discussed in the wider context of psychotropic drug use. It is concluded that, while there has been a recent consensus that the benzodiazepines have been problematic, when they are placed in a longer historical context, a different picture is apparent because other psychotropic drugs have raised similar problems.",

Its origins can be traced as far back as 4500 BC, to four ancient books of knowledge, (the \"Vedas\") and it is still officially recognized by the government of India. The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of Anwala churna (Emblica officinalis Gaertn.), an Ayurvedic preparation on memory, total serum cholesterol levels and brain cholinesterase activity in mice. Anwala churna was administered orally in three doses (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) for fifteen days to different groups of young and aged mice. Elevated plus maze and passive avoidance apparatus served as the exteroceptive behavioral models for testing memory. Diazepam-, scopolamine- and ageing-induced amnesia served as the interoceptive behavioral models. Total serum cholesterol levels and brain cholinesterase activity also estimated. Anwala churna (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg, p.o.) produced a dose-dependent improvement in memory scores of young and aged mice. Furthermore, it reversed the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.). Interestingly, brain cholinesterase activity and total cholesterol levels were reduced by Anwala churna administered orally for 15 days. Anwala churna may prove to be a useful remedy for the management of Alzheimer's disease on account of its multifarious beneficial effects such as, memory improving property, cholesterol lowering property and anticholinesterase activity.",

The association between pre- and post-treatment use of SSRIs, benzodiazepines (BZs), and any anti-anxiety or anti-depressant (A/D) medication were investigated for three indicators of treatment outcome (PD severity, presence of agoraphobia (AG), anxiety sensitivity) at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. Controlling for pre-treatment severity, pre-treatment SSRI use was associated with worse outcomes for AG (p=.04) and anxiety sensitivity (p=.047); post-treatment SSRI use was associated with delayed improvements in PD severity (p=.05). Pre-treatment use of A/D was associated with poorer PD severity outcomes (p=.04). Post-treatment use of A/D was associated with higher anxiety sensitivity scores across post-treatment and 6-month follow-up (p=.03). BZ use was not associated with significantly worse outcomes. However, there was a decrease in the number of patients using BZs from pre-treatment to post-treatment (p=.06) and follow-up (p=.006). In conclusion, controlling for pre-treatment severity, pre- and post-treatment use of SSRIs and A/D was associated with poorer outcomes, particularly for PD severity and anxiety sensitivity.",

    "113": "Phencyclidine (PCP) is a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. Several studies have demonstrated that chronic NMDA receptor antagonist treatment in humans and animals can cause long-term behavioral changes that are reminiscent of negative and cognitive schizophrenia-like symptoms. The muscarinic cholinergic system, which is associated with cognitive functions, has been hypothesized to contribute to PCP's mechanism of action. No study, however, has examined the status of M1/4 receptors in the PCP model of schizophrenia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of chronic (14 day) PCP treatment on mouse brain M1/4 receptors in the short term (1 hr and 24 hr) and long term (14 days) after last PCP administration. [(3)H]pirenzepine was used to target M1/4 receptors. In the short term following chronic PCP treatment, M1/4 binding was significantly increased in regions of the limbic system, caudate-putamen, cortex, and thalamus (ranging from 56% to 368%), compared with saline-treated mice. There were no differences in binding between mice treated with PCP for 14 days and sacrificed 1 hr or 24 hr after the final PCP treatment. In the long term following chronic PCP treatment, M1/4 binding was significantly decreased in all of the above-mentioned brain regions (ranging from 31% to 72%), except in the thalamus, which showed no change. These findings in the long-term group are similar to those reported in post-mortem studies of patients suffering from schizophrenia.",

Racemic 1,4-benzodiazepines show potent anti-RSV activity in vitro. Anti-RSV evaluation of 3-position R- and S-benzodiazepine enantiomers and subsequent optimization of this series resulted in selection of a clinical candidate. Antiviral activity was found to reside mainly in the S-enantiomer, and the R-enantiomers were consistently less active against RSV. Analogues of 1,4-(S)-benzodiazepine were synthesized as part of the lead optimization program at Arrow and tested in the XTT assay. From this exercise, (S)-1-(2-fluorophenyl)-3-(2-oxo-5-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[e][1,4]-diazepin-3-yl)-urea, 17b (RSV-604) was identified as a clinical candidate, exhibiting potent anti-RSV activity in the XTT assay, which was confirmed in secondary assays.

Clozapine and olanzapine showed similar effects on ethanol-induced AA release in mouse striatum. However, their effects on ethanol-induced AA release in mouse prefrontal cortex have not been reported. Thus, their effects on this neurochemical event were further investigated in the present study. The results showed that ethanol (4.0 gkg i.p.) significantly stimulated AA release in the prefrontal cortex by about 200 of baseline in mice. Clozapine and olanzapine, at the dose of 1.0 mgkg s.c., had no effect on basal AA or ethanol-induced AA release. However, both drugs, at the dose of 10 mgkg s.c., significantly inhibited ethanol-induced AA release. The present study demonstrated for the first time that similar actions were exhibited by clozapine and olanzapine for the regulation of ethanol-induced AA release in the mouse prefrontal cortex.", 
    "121": "The use of a drug to modify a person's behavior for criminal gain is not a recent phenomenon. However, the recent increase in reports of drug-facilitated crimes (sexual assault, robbery) has caused alarm in the general public. The drugs involved can be pharmaceuticals, such as benzodiazepines (flunitrazepam, lorazepam, etc.), hypnotics (zopiclone, zolpidem), sedatives (neuroleptics, some anti-H1) or anaesthetics (gamma-hydroxybutyrate, ketamine), drugs of abuse, such as cannabis, ecstasy or LSD, or more often ethanol. To perform successful toxicological examinations, the analyst must follow some important rules: (1) obtain as soon as possible the corresponding biological specimens (blood and urine); (2) collect hair about 1 month after the alleged event; (3) use sophisticated analytical techniques (gas or liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, MS/MS, headspace gas chromatography); and (4) take care in the interpretation of the findings. Drugs used to facilitate sexual assaults can be difficult to detect (active products at low doses, chemical instability), possess amnesic properties and can be rapidly cleared from the body (short half-life). In these situations, blood or even urine can be of low interest. This is the reason why some laboratories have developed an original approach based on hair testing. Hair was suggested as a valuable specimen in situations where, as a result of a delay in reporting the crime, natural processes have eliminated the drug from typical biological specimens. While there are a lot of papers that have focused on the identification of drugs in hair following chronic drug use, those dealing with a single dose are very scarce. The experience of the author and a review of the existing literature will be presented for cases involving benzodiazepines, hypnotics, gamma-hydroxybutyrate and various sedatives or chemical weapons. The expected concentrations in hair are in the low picogram/milligram range for most compounds. Hair analysis may be a useful adjunct to conventional drug testing in sexual assault. It should not be considered as an alternative to blood and urine analyses, but as a complement. This approach may find useful applications, but the definition of legally defensible cutoff values would require much more data. MS/MS technologies appear as a prerequisite in drug-facilitated cases.",

Nevertheless, [(35)S]TBPS binding in human brain could be inhibited by TBPS, picrotoxin, loreclezole and pentobarbital and modulated by GABA with potencies comparable to those observed in rats. In addition, the GABA-induced reduction in human brain [(35)S]TBPS binding could be modulated by benzodiazepine site ligands in a manner that reflected their intrinsic efficacies.",

    "130": "The US FDA has approved a limited number of treatments for alcohol, nicotine and opioid dependence; however, no treatments for other abused drugs such as marijuana, cocaine or methamphetamine are approved. This review focuses on research into drug pharmacotherapies, particularly single-drug therapies, for substance abuse and dependence contributing to the most important dual substance use disorders (SUDs). Given the implications of poly-substance abuse, it is essential that clinicians and researchers be aware of potential pharmacotherapies for the treatment of dual SUDs.A substantial number of patients abuse more than one drug concurrently, complicating the treatment of SUD and leaving clinicians with few FDA-approved drug options for their patients. In this era of evidence-based medicine, such patients are typically treated with therapeutically proven medications, but in ways that are outside the scope of a drug's original indication by the FDA. Such 'off-label' prescribing has become an important therapeutic strategy for practitioners seeking treatments for other diseases in subpopulations such as paediatrics and gerontology or for medical conditions such as oncology or mental illness. Similarly, the information that most clinicians use to make their decisions for treating patients abusing multiple drugs stems from trials treating a single SUD, anecdotal experiences from their own practice or that of their colleagues, or single-case studies reported in the literature. The existing evidence suggests there are few treatments for SUDs that confer significant reductions in substance use across a broad patient population. Moreover, even fewer clinical efficacy trials have been conducted that provide evidence of therapeutic benefit for these drugs. Recognising the difficulty in making the proper drug choice for facilitating maximum treatment success, this review highlights the single drugs or drug combinations that show some potential for treating dual SUDs. This review finds strongest support for the use of disulfiram for treatment of alcohol and cocaine dependence (with or without concomitant methadone maintenance), baclofen for alcohol and cocaine dependence (but not opioid-dependent cocaine users), tiagabine for cocaine dependence in methadone-maintained patients, and topiramate for alcohol, nicotine and cocaine dependence. While ondansetron and olanzapine show some efficacy in treating alcohol and cocaine dependence, more research is needed to better delineate the subpopulation in which these drugs may provide their maximum effect.", 
    "131": "Many chemoinformatics applications, including high-throughput virtual screening, benefit from being able to rapidly predict the physical, chemical, and biological properties of small molecules to screen large repositories and identify suitable candidates. When training sets are available, machine learning methods provide an effective alternative to ab initio methods for these predictions. Here, we leverage rich molecular representations including 1D SMILES strings, 2D graphs of bonds, and 3D coordinates to derive efficient machine learning kernels to address regression problems. We further expand the library of available spectral kernels for small molecules developed for classification problems to include 2.5D surface and 3D kernels using Delaunay tetrahedrization and other techniques from computational geometry, 3D pharmacophore kernels, and 3.5D or 4D kernels capable of taking into account multiple molecular configurations, such as conformers. The kernels are comprehensively tested using cross-validation and redundancy-reduction methods on regression problems using several available data sets to predict boiling points, melting points, aqueous solubility, octanol/water partition coefficients, and biological activity with state-of-the art results. When sufficient training data are available, 2D spectral kernels in general tend to yield the best and most robust results, better than state-of-the art. On data sets containing thousands of molecules, the kernels achieve a squared correlation coefficient of 0.91 for aqueous solubility prediction and 0.94 for octanol/water partition coefficient prediction. Averaging over conformations improves the performance of kernels based on the three-dimensional structure of molecules, especially on challenging data sets. Kernel predictors for aqueous solubility (kSOL), LogP (kLOGP), and melting point (kMELT) are available over the Web through: http://cdb.ics.uci.edu.", 
    "132": "The subthalamic nucleus occupies a position in the indirect pathway of basal ganglia circuit, which plays an important role in the movement regulation. Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine agonist with a high affinity on the benzodiazepine site of GABA(A) receptors containing alpha 1 subunit. Recently, zolpidem has been reported to be useful in treating subgroups of parkinsonian patients. A high density of zolpidem binding sites has been shown in rat subthalamic nucleus. To further investigate the modulation of zolpidem on GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory synaptic current in subthalamic nucleus, whole-cell patch clamp recordings were used in the present study. Zolpidem at 100nM significantly prolonged the decay time and rise time of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents, with no effect on the amplitude and frequency. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil could completely block the potentiation induced by zolpidem, confirming the specificity on the benzodiazepine site. At a high concentration of 1 microM, zolpidem significantly increased the decay time, rise time, amplitude and frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents. In the behaving rats, unilateral microinjection of zolpidem into subthalamic nucleus induced a significant contralateral rotation. The present findings on the effect of zolpidem in subthalamic nucleus provide a rationale for further investigations into its potential in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

Expanding on these findings, the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study aimed to assess whether a differential modulation of cognitive brain activation by an acute GABAergic drug challenge could be detected in patients with alcoholism. Eight detoxified male patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence and nine healthy male control subjects were studied with fMRI while performing a 2-back working memory task. The fMRI scans were performed 1 h after intravenous administration of saline and again 1 h after 0.03 mg/kg lorazepam I.V. After saline, a task x group interaction effect with higher task activation in alcoholic patients in the left cerebellum and the right prefrontal cortex emerged. Additionally, a differential task x drug x group interaction was identified in the right cerebellum with more pronounced reduction in cognitive activation after lorazepam in the patient group. A significant correlation between lorazepam sensitivity and duration of alcohol dependence was detected. The present findings are in line with previous studies suggesting disrupted prefrontal-cerebellar activation with potential compensatory hyperactivation of the compromised brain networks in alcoholism. Moreover, the results suggest enhanced responsivity to an acute GABAergic challenge in the right cerebellum with disease-related disruption of cerebellar functional integrity.",

PSM has been recently observed also in restless legs syndrome, during relaxed wakefulness preceding falling asleep, coexisting with motor restlessness and sensory discomfort. PSM disappeared when spindles and K-complexes and typical Periodic Limb Movements appeared with EMG activity limited to leg muscles, without propriospinal propagation.",

Several short-term open-label randomised studies, typically enrolling two- to three-hundred patients, have compared an atypical antipsychotic with haloperidol. These studies show that IM ziprasidone, IM olanzapine and IM aripiprazole are at least as effective and better tolerated than IM haloperidol, with lower extrapyramidal side effects. Successful transitions from an IM to oral formulation of the same agent have been performed in double-blind randomised trials assessing haloperidol, olanzapine, ziprasidone and aripiprazole. Avoiding over-sedation is now recognised as important, and randomised clinical trial data indicate that oral ziprasone, quetiapine, and IM olanzapine have high dose-related sedative potential while oral risperidone and IM aripiprazole have low sedative potential. In summary, IM formulations of atypical antipsychotics are recommended as first-line treatment of acute agitation with subsequent transition to an oral formulation of the same agent for ongoing management.",

In an effort to achieve affinity-based selectivity among BzR subtypes, these compounds were designed to probe the LDi and L2 lipophilic regions. Taking the alpha1-selective benzylindolylglyoxylamides Ia and Ib as leads, we varied the substituent on the benzylamide phenyl ring (compounds 10-23) or replaced the benzyl moiety with alkyl groups (compounds 24-37). The above structural changes gave no shift of selectivity from the alpha1 toward the alpha2 or alpha5 subtypes, thus confirming that a ligand which occupies the LDi region probably exhibits alpha1 selectivity, despite its interactions with other lipophilic areas in the receptor binding cleft. Compound 11 (N-(p-methylbenzyl)-5-nitroindol-3-ylglyoxylamide), which selectively binds with a full agonist efficacy at the alpha1 receptor subtype and displays sedative action, can be regarded as an interesting potential zolpidem-like sedative-hypnotic agent.",

These data suggest a possible physiological relationship, through the GABA-A receptor channel, between memory processes, anxiety, and ultimately, in pathological states, epileptic seizures. This relationship seems to be confirmed partially by experiments on mouse strains selected for their resistance (BR) and sensitivity (BS) to a single convulsive dose of a beta-carboline.

    "150": "The effects of haloperidol and olanzapine on polysomnographic measures made in bipolar patients during manic episodes were compared. Twelve DSM-IV mania patients were randomly assigned to receive either haloperidol (mean +/- SD final dosage: 5.8 +/- 3.8 mg) or olanzapine (mean +/- SD final dosage: 13.6 +/- 6.9 mg) in a 6-week, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial. One-night polysomnographic evaluation was performed before and after the haloperidol or olanzapine treatment. Psychopathology and illness severity were rated respectively with the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and the Clinical Global Impressions - Bipolar version (CGI-BP). There was a significant improvement in the YMRS and CGI-BP scores at the end of the study for both groups. Mixed ANOVA used to compare the polysomnographic measures of both drugs demonstrated significant improvement in sleep measures with olanzapine. In the olanzapine group, statistically significant time-drug interaction effects on sleep continuity measures were observed: sleep efficiency (mean +/- SEM pre-treatment value: 6.7 +/- 20.3%; after-treatment: 85.7 +/- 10.9%), total wake time (pre-treatment: 140.0 +/- 92.5 min; after-treatment: 55.2 +/- 44.2 min), and wake time after sleep onset (pre-treatment: 109.7 +/- 70.8 min; after-treatment: 32.2 +/- 20.7 min). Conversely, improvement of polysomnographic measures was not observed for the haloperidol group (P > 0.05). These results suggest that olanzapine is more effective than haloperidol in terms of sleep-promoting effects, although olanzapine is comparatively as effective as haloperidol in treating mania.

A database on hospital discharges with a diagnosis (ICD-9/10) of poisoning between 1981 and 2001 was used. Annual admissions were described for seven main drug categories, and proportions of patients readmitted within 1-5 years from first admission, were computed for each category. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate prognostic factors for readmission risk over 1981-2001. For both sexes, admissions increased from the early to mid 1990s, and declined thereafter. The proportion readmitted varied with the drug taken at first admission, from 11.9% (95% CI: 10.8-13%) for non-opiate analgesics, to 17.6% (16.5-18.7%) for benzodiazepines. Deprivation was positively related to readmission risk after first admissions with paracetamol (P < 0.001) and benzodiazepines (P < 0.001).

We examined the clinical features such as age, sex, age of onset, duration of illness, types of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, severity, improvement after treatment, insight into disease, depression, comorbidity, involving family members in compulsive or ritualistic behavior, and the level of social adaptation of each OCD group.", 
    "154": "Twenty five patients showed a good response to SSRI monotherapy, 15 showed a response to antipsychotic augmentation, and 10 were non-responders to both SSRI and SSRI with an atypical antipsychotic. Significantly lower insight levels were observed only in group B and higher depressive levels in group C. OCD patients who were refractory to SSRI monotherapy showed comorbidity at a significantly higher frequency. OCD patients in group A showed significantly greater improvement, and group B showed inferior social adaptation after treatment. There were no significant differences in age, sex, age of onset, duration of illness, severity, involving family members in compulsive or ritualistic behavior, and social adaptation before treatment in the three OCD groups.", 
    "155": "There were differences in the clinical features of OCD patients who showed different responses to pharmacological treatment. Our results suggest that OCD is clinically and biologically heterogeneous. It may be important to divide OCD patients into subgroups for future studies.", 
    "156": "The AGD acknowledges that dentists may need an additional permit to perform the procedure described in this article. Many states require dental practitioners to have additional or advanced training in order to perform enteral sedation. In some states, practitioners must have an i.v./conscious sedation permit before they are allowed to titrate (dose) oral medication. The ADA does not believe that oral medication can be titrated (dosed) without an i.v. sedation license. The AGD has adopted and published a white paper on sedation issues, which appeared in the September-October 2006 issue of General Dentistry. The AGD encourages continuing education in sedation modalities for general dentists. Oral conscious sedation (OCS) is an increasingly common practice in dentistry and is at the forefront of evolving state regulations. At the center of the OCS controversy is the oral titration of medications. Most medications available for OCS are used in an \"off-label\" manner and have no determined maximum recommended dosage for that purpose. This article proposes cumulative maximum dosing guidelines for in-office OCS, with an emphasis on triazolam.",

    "159": "A retrospective review of all consecutive admissions to these two adult psychiatric units was conducted during the period 1st January to 30th June 2002. Patient demographics, diagnosis and sedative-hypnotic treatment data were extracted from clinical files. Average benzodiazepine daily dose was calculated for each admission in diazepam equivalents (Diaz(e)).",

    "161": "Data from 257 patients and 293 admissions were analysed. Almost all admissions (86.7%) involved treatment with a sedative-hypnotic. A benzodiazepine was prescribed for 82.6% of admissions, of which 64.9% was administered on an \"as-needed (prn)\" basis. Zopiclone was used in 56.7% of admissions, of which 83.7% was \"as-needed (prn)\" treatment. Most benzodiazepine treatment was with a single agent (61.6%) and lorazepam was the most frequently prescribed (54.8%). Over two-thirds of admissions used benzodiazepine treatment for 50% or less of the admission duration. The duration of treatment was shortest in those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder. Almost two-thirds of admissions were discharged without any prescription for sedative-hypnotic treatment.", 
    "162": "The use of sedative-hypnotic treatment in the acute adult inpatient psychiatric environment compared favourably with best practice recommendations regarding dose, duration of treatment and discharge treatment. The study identified key areas for intervention by clinical pharmacists to ensure appropriate use of sedative-hypnotics including in-service education, regular review of all sedative-hypnotic treatment and discharge medication planning.", 
    "163": "There is a great deal of variation in individual management of non-sharp oesophageal food bolus obstruction in the United Kingdom. An e-mail survey of consultants and specialist registrars in ENT was carried out to establish current UK practice. A review of the published literature was under-taken to establish whether current practice is evidence based. The majority of practitioners (95%) do not proceed immediately to rigid oesophagoscopy but use antispasmodic drugs (83%), most commonly hyoscine butylbromide (Buscopan) and diazepam, to try to induce spontaneous passage of the obstruction. There is currently no evidence in the published literature to support the use of these drugs. The use of Buscopan seems to have been encouraged by a misquoted reference in a prominent ENT textbook. Better evidence is needed to establish the best form of treatment for this relatively common problem.", 
    "164": "Both psychotropic drugs and mental disorders have typical signatures in quantitative electroencephalography (EEG). Previous studies found that some psychotropic drugs had EEG effects opposite to the EEG effects of the mental disorders treated with these drugs (key-lock principle).", 
    "165": "We performed a placebo-controlled pharmaco-EEG study on two conventional antipsychotics (chlorpromazine and haloperidol) and four atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, perospirone, quetiapine, and risperidone) in healthy volunteers. We investigated differences between conventional and atypical drug effects and whether the drug effects were compatible with the key-lock principle.", 
    "166": "Fourteen subjects underwent seven EEG recording sessions, one for each drug (dosage equivalent of 1 mg haloperidol). In a time-domain analysis, we quantified the EEG by identifying clusters of transiently stable EEG topographies (microstates). Frequency-domain analysis used absolute power across electrodes and the location of the center of gravity (centroid) of the spatial distribution of power in different frequency bands.", 
    "167": "Perospirone increased duration of a microstate class typically shortened in schizophrenics. Haloperidol increased mean microstate duration of all classes, increased alpha 1 and beta 1 power, and tended to shift the beta 1 centroid posterior. Quetiapine decreased alpha 1 power and shifted the centroid anterior in both alpha bands. Olanzapine shifted the centroid anterior in alpha 2 and beta 1.", 
    "168": "The increased microstate duration under perospirone and haloperidol was opposite to effects previously reported in schizophrenic patients, suggesting a key-lock mechanism. The opposite centroid changes induced by olanzapine and quetiapine compared to haloperidol might characterize the difference between conventional and atypical antipsychotics.", 
    "169": "Trefoil family factor 2 (TFF2) is expressed in gastrointestinal epithelial cells where it serves to maintain mucosal integrity and promote epithelial repair. The peptide hormone, gastrin, stimulates acid secretion but also induces proliferation of the acid-secreting mucosa. Because the relationship between these peptides of overlapping function is not understood, we chose to investigate the regulatory effect of gastrin on TFF2 expression. The expression of mRNA and protein of TFF2 was determined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. A series of truncated and mutant murine TFF2 promoter constructs was generated. Promoter activity was assessed using dual luciferase reporter assays. Gastrin-responsive DNA-binding sites in the TFF2 promoter were evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Gastrin significantly increased the level of endogenous mRNA of TFF2 in the gastrin receptor-expressing AGS-E gastric cancer cell line in a time- and dose-dependent manner. TFF2 protein expression in the gastric fundus was elevated in hypergastrinemic (INS-GAS) transgenic mice and reduced in gastrin-deficient mice. Gastrin treatment increased TFF2 promoter activity through cis-acting regions, containing CCAATA- and GC-rich enhancers. Pretreatment with Y-F476, a gastrin/CCK(B) receptor antagonist, abolished gastrin-dependent promoter activity. Inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK1), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) reduced gastrin-dependent TFF2 promoter activity, whereas an epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor had no effect. We found that gastrin regulates TFF2 transcription through a GC-rich DNA-binding site and a PKC-, MEK1- and PI 3-kinase-dependent but EGFR-independent pathway. Regulation of TFF2 by gastrin may play a role in the maintenance and repair of the gastrointestinal mucosa.",

    "172": "Cumulative concentration-response curves were determined for the muscarinic receptor agonist bethanechol with or without prior incubation with subtype-specific receptor antagonists in an organ bath. Effects of bethanechol and antagonists and the influence of intestinal location on basal tone, maximal amplitude (A(max)), and area under the curve (AUC) were evaluated.", 
    "173": "Bethanechol induced a significant, concentration-dependent increase in all preparations and variables. The effect of bethanechol was more pronounced in jejunal than in duodenal samples and in circular than in longitudinal preparations. Significant inhibition of the effects of bethanechol was observed after prior incubation with muscarinic receptor subtype M(3) antagonists (more commonly for basal tone than for A(max) and AUC). The M(2) receptor antagonists partly inhibited the response to bethanechol, especially for basal tone. The M(3) receptor antagonists were generally more potent than the M(2) receptor antagonists. In a protection experiment, an M(3) receptor antagonist was less potent than when used in combination with an M(2) receptor antagonist. Receptor antagonists for M(1) and M(4) did not affect contractility variables.",

    "175": "Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with persistent symptomatology, severe functional disability, and residual morbidity characteristic of neurodegenerative brain diseases. The illness begins with genetic susceptibility and generally expresses itself after puberty through subtle changes that begin during the prodromal stage. Symptoms get progressively worse and tend to become more resistant to treatment with each relapse. Evidence for a neuroprotective effect of some forms of early treatment is beginning to emerge. While the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain, atypical antipsychotics may counteract some of the progressive deteriorative effects by enhancing synaptic plasticity and cellular resilience. However, identifying and treating patients in the earliest disease states presents methodological challenges as there is no consensus on the best methods of intervention and differences in at-risk children are not readily detectable or substantial enough to predict which ones will develop schizophrenia. In this expert roundtable supplement, Jeffrey A. Lieberman, MD, reviews the historical context of progressive deterioration in schizophrenia. Next, Diana O. Perkins, MD, MPH, reviews some of the challenges to early identification of illness as well as the impact of early versus delayed treatment. Finally, L. Fredrik Jarskog, MD, focuses on the neurobiology of functional progression in schizophrenia as well as pharmacology and the potential for neuroprotection.",

    "177": "Consenting patients were enrolled in the NIMH Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) project. In phase 1, patients were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine, perphenazine, quetiapine, risperidone, or ziprasidone for up to 18 months. Clozapine was included for patients who chose this pathway after discontinuing phase 1 due to inefficacy; all other patients received another second-generation antipsychotic. Psychosocial functioning was assessed using the Quality of Life Scale.", 
    "178": "Psychosocial functioning modestly improved for the one-third of phase 1 patients who reached the primary Quality of Life Scale analysis endpoint of 12 months (average effect size 0.19 SD units). Although for several of the drugs individually there were significant changes from baseline, overall there were no significant differences between the different agents. Results were similar at 6 and 18 months. There were no significant differences among the treatment groups in the amount of change in the Quality of Life Scale total score or subscale scores at 6, 12, or 18 months. Patients treated with clozapine in the efficacy pathway made comparable gains. Early treatment discontinuations, especially among patients most impaired at baseline, limited the ability to achieve more substantial functional gains.", 
    "179": "All antipsychotic treatment groups in all phases made modest improvements in psychosocial functioning. There were no differences among them after 6, 12, or 18 months. More substantial improvements would likely require more intensive adjunctive psychosocial rehabilitation interventions.", 
    "180": "The relative effectiveness of newly started antipsychotic drugs for individuals with schizophrenia may depend on multiple factors, including each patient's previous treatment response and the reason for a new medication trial. This randomized, double-blind study compared olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone in patients who had just discontinued the older antipsychotic perphenazine.", 
    "181": "Subjects with schizophrenia (N=114) who had been randomly assigned to and then discontinued perphenazine in phase 1 of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) schizophrenia study were reassigned randomly to double-blinded treatment with olanzapine, 7.5-30.0 mg/day (N=38); quetiapine, 200-800 mg/day (N=38); or risperidone, 1.5-6.0 mg/day (N=38). The primary aim was to determine whether there were differences among these three treatments in effectiveness, as measured by time to treatment discontinuation for any reason. Secondary outcomes included reasons for treatment discontinuation and measures of drug tolerability.", 
    "182": "The time to treatment discontinuation was longer for patients treated with quetiapine (median, 9.9 months) and olanzapine (7.1 months) than with risperidone (3.6 months). There were no significant differences between treatments on discontinuation due to inefficacy, intolerability, or patient decision.", 
    "183": "Among this group of patients with chronic schizophrenia who had just discontinued the older antipsychotic perphenazine, quetiapine and olanzapine were more effective than risperidone, as reflected by longer time to discontinuation for any reason. In the context of other results from the CATIE study, the effectiveness and acceptability of antipsychotic drugs appears to vary considerably according to clinical circumstances.", 
    "184": "Buspirone is a serotonin 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist licensed for the treatment of anxiety. Other anxiolytic drugs such as benzodiazepines show significant sedative and other unwanted effects on cognition. Studies to date have yet to investigate cognitive effects of buspirone using well-validated computerized tests. The aim of this study was to assess acute subjective and cognitive effects of buspirone in healthy volunteers. Sixty healthy male volunteers received 20 mg buspirone, 30 mg buspirone, or placebo per os in a double-blind parallel groups design (N=20 per group). Subjective ratings (visual analogue scales) were completed at baseline, and at 1.5 and 3.5 hours post-capsule. Cognitive assessment was undertaken between 1.5 and 3.5 hours post-capsule, including tests of memory, executive planning, impulse control, decision making and cognitive flexibility. The 30 mg buspirone group showed significantly higher subjective ratings of contentedness 3.5 hours after capsule relative to placebo. Treatment and placebo groups did not differ significantly on cognitive measures. In contrast to benzodiazepines, the anxiolytic buspirone appears to lack detectable deleterious effects on cognition when administered acutely at clinically meaningful doses. Future research directions are discussed in relation to acute and chronic studies in neuropsychiatric populations."
