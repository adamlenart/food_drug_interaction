    "0": "This study applied the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation test to patients with panic disorder, before and during treatment with alprazolam, and to control subjects. In contrast to some, but not all prior studies, untreated, nondepressed panic disorder patients failed to show blunted adrenocorticotropic hormone or cortisol responses to CRH. In fact, the responses were subtly enhanced in that they were more rapid than those of controls. After 12 weeks of alprazolam treatment, repeat testing gave results that were indistinguishable from those of controls. Inconsistency among reports of CRH testing in panic disorder may be related to interactions among illness mechanisms, concurrent subthreshold depressive symptoms, the chronic stress of the illness, and hyperresponsiveness of panic patients to the acute stress of experimental manipulations. Pretreatment abnormalities in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function appear to resolve with alprazolam treatment. Preliminary observations suggest that pretreatment dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system may predict a more difficult or less satisfactory treatment.", 
    "1": "Benzodiazepine abuse is common among clients at methadone maintenance clinics. Diazepam and lorazepam are readily detected by immunological screening methods and confirmed by GC/MS. Alprazolam has been relatively difficult to confirm. We recently reported a modification of an existing serum HPLC procedure which allows us to analyze whole blood. We report here three cases of fatal drug overdose caused by co-ingestion of methadone and alprazolam. In all three cases, alprazolam was detected by HPLC and could not be identified by alkaline extraction GC/MS. Postmortem blood concentrations of methadone were at the lower range or below the concentrations previously identified in methadone overdose fatalities, suggesting an increased risk from co-ingestion of methadone and alprazolam.", 
    "2": "Benzodiazepine receptor partial agonists manifest full efficacy in preclinical tests of anxiolytic drug action but do not fully reproduce the discriminative stimulus effects of benzodiazepine receptor full agonists in pigeons. The partial agonist, bretazenil, binds to both diazepam-sensitive and diazepam-insensitive GABAA receptors. Previous studies have suggested a role for each of these receptor populations in some behavioral effects of bretazenil in pigeons. A possible role for these receptor subtypes in the behavioral effects of bretazenil was further investigated through drug interaction studies with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonists, flumazenil and ZK 93,426. Whereas flumazenil binds with high affinity to both receptor isoforms, ZK 93,426 binds preferentially to diazepam-sensitive binding sites. Bretazenil markedly increased punished responding of pigeons without significantly affecting nonpunished responding. In pigeons discriminating the full benzodiazepine receptor agonist, midazolam, from saline, bretazenil produced only 60-75% maximal effect. Flumazenil and ZK 93,426 neither increased punished responding nor substituted for midazolam, but dose-dependently blocked the effects of bretazenil on punished responding. Flumazenil also dose-dependently blocked the effects of bretazenil in midazolam-discriminating pigeons, whereas ZK 93,426 only attenuated this effect. These results indicate that bretazenil's actions as a partial agonist at diazepam-sensitive benzodiazepine receptors mediate increases in punished responding and substitution for the discriminative stimulus effects of midazolam in pigeons. The differences in the effects of flumazenil and ZK 93,426 on the discriminative stimulus effects of bretazenil suggest a potential contribution of diazepam-insensitive sites to this behavioral effect.", 
    "3": "We demonstrated previously that pancreatic secretion of individual enzymes is specifically regulated (1). In the present study, we investigated and defined contributing roles of cholinergic and cholecystokinin tones to the specific regulation of rat pancreatic secretion of digestive enzymes. Animals were provided with pancreatic, biliary, duodenal, and jugular vein cannulas allowing separate drainage of bile and pure pancreatic juice, as well as intravenous infusions of MK329 or atropine sulfate along with SMS 201-995 (SMS). Rats kept in restraint cages were divided into four groups. The first rat group was infused with 5 micrograms kg-1 h-1 SMS alone; the second group was infused with a mixture of SMS and MK329 (5 micrograms kg-1 h-1:0.5 mg kg-1 h-1); the third group received a mixture of SMS and atropine (5 micrograms kg-1 h-1); and rats in the fourth group were administrated a mixture of SMS, MK329, and atropine (5 micrograms kg-1 h-1:0.5 mg kg-1:100 micrograms kg-1 h-1). Food, but not water, was denied rats 10 h before the experiment and throughout the 6-h experimental period. During the experiment, pancreatic juice was continuously collected every 15 min from each rat, and a 15-microliter aliquot of the pancreatic juice sample was removed for total protein, amylase, lipase, trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, and proelastase assays. Pancreatic juice previously collected from a donor rat was mixed with the fresh bile and the mixture was recirculated into the duodenum. The secretory patterns over the 6-h experimental period showed that during the first hour of drug infusion, MK329 alone did not alter the SMS-induced inhibitory process of total protein and amylase, trypsinogen, and proelastase secretion, and there was no marked change in total protein and enzyme outputs. Adding atropine to SMS did not alter the secretory pattern during the first hour of drug infusion, but a significantly greater decrease in protein and enzymes outputs occurred. Correlations between paired enzyme outputs greatly increased with SMS alone, but some changed when either MK329 or atropine was infused along with SMS. When all drugs were infused together, enzyme outputs became strongly correlated. These results suggest that under fasting conditions, somatostatin and atropine can neutralize basal pancreatic enzyme outputs, leading to a constitutive type of secretion characterized by parallel secretion of the digestive enzymes. Furthermore, it is proposed that under basal secretion conditions, acetylcholine and cholecystokinin reaching the pancreatic acinar cells may act to dissociate pancreatic secretion of individual digestive enzymes originating from heterogeneous secretory granules.", 
    "4": "This study examines the effects of genetically determined S-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation capacity and cigarette smoking on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of oral alprazolam in 12 healthy male volunteers. Six subjects each were extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs) of S-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation. Seven subjects were smokers (> 10 cigarettes/day), and five were nonsmokers, according to their self-reports. Each subject took a single oral dose of 0.8 mg of alprazolam, and blood samples were collected up to 48 hours postdose. Psychomotor function was assessed at times of blood samplings using the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and UKU Side Effect Rating Scale. Plasma alprazolam concentrations were measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography assay. None of the mean pharmacokinetic parameters was significantly different between the EM and PM phenotype groups. Although the mean elimination half-life was significantly shorter in the smoker group (p < .01) than in the nonsmoker group (13.1 +/- 2.9 vs. 20.0 +/- 2.7 hours, mean +/- SD), other pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between the two groups. Psychomotor function parameters did not differ significantly either between the EM and PM groups or between the nonsmoker and smoker groups. The present study thus suggests that neither S-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation status nor self-reports of extensive cigarette smoking has a major impact on the metabolism of alprazolam in humans.", 
    "5": "Olanzapine is a new antipsychotic drug with affinity for 5-HT2, D2, D1, and muscarinic receptors. Positron emission tomography and the radioligands [11C]raclopride and [11C]NMSP were used to measure D2 and 5-HT2 receptor occupancy in three healthy subjects after 10 mg olanzapine orally. After seven hours D2 receptor occupancy was 63%, 62% and 59%, respectively. After 9.5 hours 5-HT2 receptor occupancy was 74%, 86% and 92%. D2 and 5-HT2 receptor occupancy was comparable to that found in patients continuously treated with clozapine. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated for olanzapine in the dose range 5 to 15 mg per day. Extrapolation from our present observations after a 10 mg single-dose suggest, that at the lower end of the clinically examined dose range the D2 and 5-HT2 receptor occupancy should be similar to that induced by standard doses of clozapine. Detailed evaluation of the dose-response characteristics of olanzapine and direct clinical comparison to clozapine will thus provide valuable leads to the clarification of atypical antipsychotic action.", 
    "6": "The role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulation of septohippocampal cholinergic neurons in kindling was investigated. Hippocampal acetylcholine release was evaluated with the microdialysis technique in freely moving rats either after acute administration of isoniazid (an inhibitor of GABA synthesis) or pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (a blocker of the GABAA receptor-associated Cl- channel) or after chronic administration of PTZ. Short-term treatment with PTZ (5-50 mg/kg, i.p.) or isoniazid (150-250 mg/kg, s.c.) increased hippocampal acetylcholine release in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the basal concentration of acetylcholine in the dialysate from the hippocampus of rats chronically treated with PTZ (kindled animals) was significantly reduced relative to that of vehicle-treated rats (2.39 +/- 0.21 vs. 4.2 +/- 0.31 pmol per 20-min sample; p < 0.01). Moreover, the release of acetylcholine was markedly more sensitive to the effect of a challenge injection of PTZ (10 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.) in kindled rats than in naive rats or rats chronically treated with vehicle. Abecarnil, a selective benzodiazepine receptor agonist with marked anticonvulsant activity, was administered together with chronic PTZ to evaluate whether persistent activation of GABAA receptors and suppression of seizures during kindling might affect the sensitivity of septohippocampal cholinergic neurons to a challenge dose of PTZ. Abecarnil (1 mg/kg, i.p.) administered 40 min before each PTZ injection neither antagonized the decrease in basal acetylcholine release (2.26 +/- 0.19 pmol per 20-min sample) nor prevented the development of kindling. In contrast, abecarnil prevented the chronic PTZ-induced increase in the sensitivity of acetylcholine release to a challenge dose of PTZ. These results provide novel in vivo data concerning the role of hippocampal acetylcholine function in the development of kindling and potentially in the learning and memory deficits associated with this phenomenon.", 
    "7": "Previous binding studies have suggested the existence of two affinity states for cholecystokinin-B (CCK-B) receptor. One study, using BC 197 and BC 264, two highly selective CCK-B agonists, has shown that BC 197 is selective for one subsite, B1, and that BC 264 has the same affinity for the two subsites, B1 and B2. Therefore, the possible involvement of CCK-B subsites in the modulation of endogenous dopamine (DA) release from slices of the anterior part of the nucleus accumbens was investigated with these two agonists in order to associate a functional response with activation of each subsite. The selective B1 agonist BC 197 produced a dose-dependent increase of 35 mM K(+)-stimulated DA release. In contrast, at a low concentration (20 nM), BC 264 inhibited the K(+)-evoked DA release, whereas at a higher concentration (1 microM), it stimulated the DA release. These two opposing effects were suppressed by the CCK-B antagonist PD-134,308, but not by the CCK-A antagonist L-364,718 and were not prevented by tetrodotoxin, a Na(+)-channel blocker. Moreover, BC 264 at 20 nM, in the presence of PD-134,308 at a concentration that would block the B2 subsites (0.1 nM), increased the evoked DA release. All together, these results support further the existence of distinct CCK-B subsites and suggest that, in the anterior nucleus accumbens, their stimulation mediates opposite effects on K(+)-stimulated DA release via a presynaptic mechanism.", 
    "8": "We present a simple way of assessing dynamic or time-dependent changes in displacement during single-subject radioligand positron emission tomography (PET) activation studies. The approach is designed to facilitate dynamic activation studies using selective radioligands. These studies are, in principle, capable of characterising functional neurochemistry by analogy with the study of functional neuroanatomy using rCBF activation studies. The proposed approach combines time-dependent compartmental models of tracer kinetics and the general linear model used in statistical parametric mapping. This provides for a comprehensive, voxel-based and data-led assessment of regionally specific effects. The statistical model proposed in this paper is predicated on a single-compartment model extended to allow for time-dependent changes in kinetics. We have addressed the sensitivity and specificity of the analysis, as it would be used operationally, by applying the analysis to 11C-Flumazenil dynamic displacement studies. The activation used in this demonstration study was a pharmacological (i.v. midazolam) challenge, 30 min after administration of the tracer. We were able to demonstrate, and make statistical inferences about, regional increases in k2 (or decreases in the volume of distribution) in prefrontal and other cortical areas.",

Cats that were having cluster seizures or status epilepticus at the time of admission were treated orally with phenobarbital and with constant IV administration of diazepam. The other cats were treated with long-term oral administration of phenobarbital if the frequency of their seizures justified it. Follow-up included evaluation of seizure frequency, serum antiepileptic drug concentrations, and hematologic and serum biochemical values. Outcome was documented on the basis of survival and seizure frequency at the end of the followup period, which ranged from 3 to 21 months.",

Seventeen had a good outcome; 11 were not having any more seizures and 6 were having a low frequency of seizures. For 3 other cats, seizures were not well controlled. Four cats had been euthanatized (2 because of intractable seizures, 1 because of postcraniotomy complications, and 1 because the owners did not want to pursue treatment).",

    "15": "Five rats were trained to respond for 10% sucrose and 10% sucrose/0.006% quinine in an operant procedure. Both solutions were concurrently available on independent, variable-interval 5-s schedules of reinforcement. Rats reliably responded for both solutions throughout the sessions and made approximately 68% of their total daily responses for the sucrose solution. When injected prior to the sessions with 4 mg/kg of chlordiazepoxide, rats selectively increased quinine responding; injections of the benzodiazepine inverse agonist Ro 15-4513 (9 mg/kg) led to decreased quinine responding. The effects of both chlordiazepoxide and Ro 15-4513 were reversed by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Presession injections of flumazenil, muscimol, baclofen, or picrotoxin all resulted in no changes in responding, or a decrease in responding for both solutions. These results are discussed in terms of a bidirectional modulation of sweet-bitter taste preference by drugs acting on the benzodiazepine receptor. Moreover, the data from these experiments suggest that any changes in the oral consumption of alcohol following administration of benzodiazepine drugs must be examined in light of their effects on taste palatability.", 
    "16": "The effect of lesioning hippocampal cholinergic neurons with the neurotoxin AF64A on the ability of cholinergic agonists to modulate stimulation-induced release of 3H-norepinephrine (NE) from rat hippocampal slices was studied. Rats received intracerebroventricular injections of either AF64A (ethylcholine mustard aziridinium, 2 nmol) or vehicle (sham operated). Six weeks after treatment, release of 3H-NE evoked by electrical stimulation (2 Hz, 2 min) in the presence or absence of cholinergic agonists and/or antagonists was measured. Activation of M2 receptors with oxotremorine (in the presence of the M1 antagonist pirenzepine) caused a small inhibition of NE release, which was abolished in hippocampi from AF64A-treated rats. The Kd for high-affinity binding of the selective M2 ligand [3H] AF-DX 384 was increased 10-fold in lesioned tissues. The M1 selective agonist McN-A-343 produced a significant enhancement of NE release, which was unchanged by AF64A lesion. Binding studies with [3H] pirenzepine showed no change in the affinity or number of M1 receptors. Nicotine also caused a significant enhancement of evoked NE release, but this effect was markedly reduced in tissues from AF64A-treated rats. AF64A treatment caused a twofold decrease in the number of [3H] nicotine binding sites. This study suggests that long-term lesion of hippocampal cholinergic neurons with AF64A alters the function of postsynaptic muscarinic M2 and nicotinic cholinergic receptors that modulate the release of NE in the hippocampus.", 
    "17": "We have reexamined the effect of NMDA antagonists [(+)MK-801 and ketamine] on rapid tolerance to chlordiazepoxide. (+)MK-801 and ketamine blocked the development of rapid tolerance to chlordiazepoxide, but this effect was dependent on the dose ratio of the NMDA antagonist to that of the benzodiazepine used to produce rapid tolerance. Furthermore, NMDA antagonists blocked both learned and unlearned tolerance to chlordiazepoxide. It appears that in addition to impairment of memory and learning, NMDA antagonists may also influence some other mechanism involved in the production of drug-tolerance.", 
    "18": "The benzodiazepine (BZ), triazolam (TRZ), results in tolerance and physical dependence. We performed in situ hybridization (ISH) experiments to gain a more complete understanding of the processes involved in mediating the effects of chronic TRZ ISH allowed us to determine whether GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs are affected by 4 weeks of TRZ administration and its withdrawal and to localize the changes to discrete brain regions. Using oligonucleotide probes directed toward the alpha 1-6, beta 1-3, and delta subunit mRNAs, we analyzed message density in 63 brain regions of TRZ-treated and control rat brains, alpha 1-4, beta 1-3, and delta subunit mRNA levels were altered by 28 days of chronic TRZ. No changes were noted in alpha 5-6 mRNA levels. Many of the changes measured were localized to neural structures within the limbic circuit of Papez, or in close communication with this pathway. After a 24 h withdrawal period from 4 weeks of TRZ treatment, the changes noted on the 28th day of treatment were reversed. Moreover, brain regions that were unaffected by the 4-week treatment were altered by the 24 h withdrawal. Our results indicate that chronic treatment and withdrawal are associated with separate processes and that chronic TRZ is correlated with limbic alterations which may be responsible for some of its chronic effects.", 
    "19": "RB 101 (N-[(R,S)-2-benzyl-3-[(S)-2-amino-4-methylthiobutyldithio]-1-oxopr opyl]-L -phenylalaninebenzyl ester), a systemically active inhibitor of enkep halin catabolism, has been shown to elicit antidepressant-like effects in mice, both in the forced-swimming and in the conditioned suppression of the mobility tests. The same type of response has been also observed following administration of the cholecystokinin CCK(B) receptor antagonist L-365,260 ((3R)-(+)-N-(2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepin -3-yl)-3 -methylphenylurea). In terestingly, the delta-opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole (17-cyclopropylmethyl-6,7-dehydro-4,5alpha-epoxy-3,14-dihydroxy-6, 7,2'-3'-indolomorphinan) blocks the effect of both RB 101 and L-365,260 in the conditioned suppression of the motility test. In this work we have investigated the involvement of the opioid system in the antidepressant response to the CCK(B) receptor antagonist L-365,260 in the forced-swimming test in mice. The effect of L-365,260 was decreased by the delta-opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole. Furthermore, the CCK(B) receptor agonist, BC 264 (Boc-Tyr(OSO3H)-gNle-mGly-Trp-(NMe)Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2), blocked the antidepressant-like effect of RB 101 while CCK-8 (H-Asp-Tyr(OSO3H)-Met-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2) enhanced the effect of this drug, probably through stimulation of central CCK(A) receptors, since the CCK(A) receptor antagonist devazepide ((3S)-(-)-(2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepin++ +-3-yl)-1H-indole-2 -carboxamide) abolished the CCK-8-induced potentiation of the RB 101 effect. In addition, RB 101 enhanced the effect of L-365,260. Such an effect was blocked by the delta-opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole. These data further support the involvement of opioid receptors in the antidepressant-type effect induced by CCK(B) receptor blockers and support the hypothesis of a regulatory role of CCK in the activity of the endogenous opioid system. As in other experimental paradigms, CCK(A) and CCK(B) receptor stimulation appears to have opposite effects in modulating opioidergic activity.", 
    "20": "6,3'-Dintroflavone is a synthetic flavone derivative with high affinity for central benzodiazepine receptors that has anxiolytic effects. Here, we describe its biochemical and pharmacological characterization. 6,3'-Dinitroflavone inhibited differentially [3H]flunitrazepam binding to central benzodiazepine receptors in several brain regions, showing a lower Ki value in the cerebellum (central benzodiazepine receptor type I-enriched area), and a higher Ki value in the spinal cord and in the dentate gyrus (central benzodiazepine receptor type II-enriched area). When i.p. injected in mice, 6,3'-dinitroflavone had a potent anxiolytic effect in the elevated plus maze test. This effect was blocked by the specific central benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, Ro 15-1788. 6,3'-Dinitroflavone did not exhibit anticonvulsant or myorelaxant effects in mice or amnestic effects in rats. Moreover, it abolished the myorelaxant effect of diazepam. On the other hand, 6,3'-dinitroflavone possessed a mild sedative action only at doses 100-300-fold greater than the anxiolytic one. Based on these findings, we suggest that 6,3'-dinitroflavone has a benzodiazepine partial agonist profile, with low selectivity for central benzodiazepine receptor types I and II.", 
    "21": "The pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines are mediated through a class of recognition sites associated with the neuronal gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor. A second class of benzodiazepine binding sites is found in virtually all mammalian peripheral tissues, in blood cells, and in glial cells in the brain, but its functions remain unclear. Although these peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites (PBBS) have been localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane in many tissues, a growing body of evidence suggests that they may also exist on the plasma membrane. Plasma membrane PBBS have been described in heart, liver, adrenal, and testis and on hemopoietic cells. In rat liver, the two subcellular forms of PBBS are found separately in two different subpopulations of cells. The discovery of a plasma membrane fraction of PBBS clearly has implications for some of its putative functions, including steroidogenesis, mitochondrial respiration, heme metabolism, calcium channel modulation, cell growth, and immunomodulation. This commentary reviews the evidence for two locations for the PBBS and discusses the relevance of mitochondrial and plasma membrane forms with regard to structure, molecular biology, and proposed roles.", 
    "22": "An in vivo saturation study using 11C-labelled Ro15-4513 with high specific radioactivity (> 70 GBq mumol-1) revealed the presence of very high-affinity and high-affinity binding sites (Kd values in the amygdala approximately 0.4 and 18.7 nM, respectively) in the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A/benzodiazepine (GABAA/BZ) receptor in the living monkey brain. Subtraction of an image obtained using [11C]Ro15-4513 with low specific radioactivity from an image obtained by that with high specific radioactivity, both of which were scanned with a high spatial resolution positron emission tomography camera, demonstrated that the very high-affinity sites are exclusively localized in the limbic system, such as in the amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate, septum, nucleus accumbens and insular cortex. The localization of the very high-affinity binding sites, which may be derived from a subclass of central GABAA/BZ receptors, might account for the anxiolytic effect of BZ analogues.", 
    "23": "To develop cell lines which respond to both a physiological cytokine and chemical agents by the induction of differentiation pathway, factor dependent B6SUtA murine bone marrow cells were transfected with the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR). Clones were obtained that exhibited different sensitivities to erythopoietin (Epo), with one clone exhibiting erythroid differentiation in response to Epo, while in another Epo acted as a proliferation stimulus. Moreover, parental B6SUtA cells were sensitive to the initiation of differentiation by butyrate, diazepam and hemin. Thus, B6SUtA cells appear to represent a unique model to dissect the signaling molecules involved in the growth and differentiation pathways employed by Epo and non-physiological chemicals.", 
    "24": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) is an important target for chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of AIDS; the TIBO compounds are potent non-nucleoside inhibitors of HIV-1 RT (NNRTIs). Crystal structures of HIV-1 RT complexed with 8-Cl TIBO (R86183, IC50 = 4.6 nM) and 9-Cl TIBO (R82913, IC50 = 33 nM) have been determined at 3.0 A resolution. Mutant HIV-1 RT, containing Cys in place of Tyr at position 181 (Tyrl81Cys), is highly resistant to many NNRTIs and HIV-1 variants containing this mutation have been selected in both cell culture and clinical trials. We also report the crystal structure of Tyrl81Cys HIV-1 RT in complex with 8-Cl TIBO (IC50 = 130 nM) determined at 3.2 A resolution. Averaging of the electron density maps computed for different HIV-1 RT/NNRTI complexes and from diffraction datasets obtained using a synchrotron source from frozen (-165 degrees C) and cooled (-10 degrees C) crystals of the same complex was employed to improve the quality of electron density maps and to reduce model bias. The overall locations and conformations of the bound inhibitors in the complexes containing wild-type HIV-1 RT and the two TIBO inhibitors are very similar, as are the overall shapes and volumes of the non-nucleoside inhibitor-binding pocket (NNIBP). The major differences between the two wild-type HIV-1 RT/TIBO complexes occur in the vicinity of the TIBO chlorine substituents and involve the polypeptide segments around the beta5-beta6 connecting loop (residues 95 to 105) and the beta13-beta14 hairpin (residues 235 and 236). In all known structures of HIV-1 RT/NNRTI complexes, including these two, the position of the beta12-beta13 hairpin or the \"primer grip\" is significantly displaced relative to the position in the structure of HIV-1 RT complexed with a double-stranded DNA and in unliganded HIV-1 RT structures. Since the primer grip helps to position the template-primer, this displacement suggests that binding of NNRTIs would affect the relative positions of the primer terminus and the polymerase active site. This could explain biochemical data showing that NNRTI binding to HIV-1 RT reduces efficiency of the chemical step of DNA polymerization, but does not prevent binding of either dNTPs or DNA. When the structure of the Tyr181Cys mutant HIV-1 RT in complex with 8-Cl TIBO is compared with the corresponding structure containing wild-type HIV-1 RT, the overall conformations of Tyr181Cys and wild-type HIV-1 RT and of the 8-Cl TIBO inhibitors are very similar. Some positional changes in the polypeptide backbone of the beta6-beta10-beta9 sheet containing residue 181 are observed when the Tyr181Cys and wild-type complexes are compared, particularlty near residue Val179 of beta9. In the p51 subunit, the Cys181 side-chain is oriented in a similar direction to the Tyr181 side-chain in the wild-type complex. However, the electron density corresponding to the sulfur of the Cys181 side-chain in the p66 subunit is very weak, indicating that the thiol group is disordered, presumably because there is no significant interaction with either 8-Cl TIBO or nearby amino acid residues. In the mutant complex, there are slight rearrangements of the side-chains of other amino acid residues in the NNIBP and of the flexible dimethylallyl group of 8-Cl TIBO; these conformational changes could potentially compensate for the interactions that were lost when the relatively large tyrosine at position 181 was replaced by a less bulky cysteine residue. In the corresponding wild-type complex, Tyr181 iin the p66 subunit has significant interactions with the bound inhibitor and the position of the Tyr181 side-chain is well defined in both subunits. Apparently the Tyr181 --> Cys mutation eliminates favorable contacts of the aromatic ring of the tyrosine and the bou", 
    "25": "A novel tool, called a genetic neural network (GNN), has been developed for obtaining quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) for high-dimensional data sets (J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39, 1521-1530). The GNN method uses a neural network to correlate activity with descriptors that are preselected by a genetic algorithm. To provide an extended test of the GNN method, the data on 57 benzodiazepines given by Maddalena and Johnston (MJ; J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 715-724) have been examined with an enhanced version of GNN, and the results are compared with the excellent QSAR of MJ. The problematic steepest descent training has been replaced by the scaled conjugate gradient algorithm. This leads to a substantial gain in performance in both robustness of prediction and speed of computation. The cross-validation GNN simulation and the subsequent run based on an unbiased and more efficient protocol led to the discovery of other 10-descriptor QSARs that are superior to the best model of MJ based on backward elimination selection and neural network training. Results from a series of GNNs with a different number of inputs showed that a neural network with fewer inputs can produce QSARs as good as or even better than those with higher dimensions. The top-ranking models from a GNN simulation using only six input descriptors are presented, and the chemical significance of the chosen descriptors is discussed. The statistical significance of these GNN QSARs is validated. The best QSARs are used to provide a graphical tool that aids the design of new drug analogues. By replacing functional groups at the 7- and 2'-positions with ones that have optimal substituent parameters, a number of new benzodiazepines with high potency are predicted.", 
    "26": "Analogs of the previously reported 1,5-benzodiazepine peripheral cholecystokinin (CCK-A) receptor agonist 1 were prepared which explore substitution and/or replacement of the C-3 phenyl urea moiety. Agonist efficacy on the isolated guinea pig gallbladder (GPGB) was retained with a variety of substituted ureas and amide analogs. Three compounds were identified which were orally active in the mouse gallbladder emptying assay (MGBE). The 2-indolamide (52) and N-(carboxymethyl)-2-indolamide (54) derivatives had improved affinity for the human CCK-A receptor but reduced agonist efficacy on the GPGB. Neither indolamide was orally active in a rat feeding assay. In contrast, the (3-carboxyphenyl)urea derivative (29, GW7854) had moderately increased affinity for the human CCK-B receptor but was a potent full agonist on the GPGB and was orally active in both the MGBE and rat feeding assays. GW7854 was a full agonist (EC50 = 60 nM) for calcium mobilization on CHO K1 cells expressing hCCK-A receptors and a potent antagonist of CCK-8 (pA2 = 9.1) on CHO K1 cells expressing hCCK-B receptors. GW7854 is a potent mixed CCK-A agonist/CCK-B antagonist which is orally active in two in vivo models of CCK-A-mediated agonist activity.", 
    "27": "A number of N-(indol-3-ylglyoxylyl)benzylamine derivatives were synthesized and tested for [3H]flunitrazepam displacing activity in bovine brain membranes. Some of these derivatives (9, 12, 14, 15, 17, 27, 34, 35, 38, 41, and 45) exhibited high affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor (BzR) with Ki values ranging from 67 to 11 nM. The GABA ratio and [35S]-tert-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding data, determined for the most active compounds, showed that they elicit an efficacy profile at the BzR which depends on the kind of substituent present on the phenyl ring of the benzylamine moiety. Moreover, lengthening (propylamine derivatives 1-3) and shortening (aniline derivatives 46-54) of the distance between the phenyl ring and the amide group of the side chain gave compounds with a drastically lower binding potency. The biological results are discussed in the light of a recently proposed pharmacophore model and compared, by molecular modeling studies, with those obtained from effective BzR ligands.", 
    "28": "The effect of the novel non-peptide neuropeptide Y Y1 receptor antagonist BIBP3226, N2-(diphenylacetyl)-N-[(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-methyl]-D-arginine amide, on exploratory behaviour of rats in the elevated plus-maze was studied. BIBP3226 (0.5 and 5 micrograms, i.c.v.) induced an anxiogenic-like effect at the higher dose tested. This effect was antagonised by diazepam (0.5 mg/kg). The anxiogenic-like effect of BIBP3226 was not related to a decrease in general locomotor activity. These findings support the hypothesis that neuropeptide Y Y1 receptor subtype is involved in anxiety regulation.", 
    "29": "Insomnia is not frequently a disease and is rather to be considered as a symptom or a physiological signal. Consequently, its treatment should tend to be etiological. If a pharmacological sleep inducing intervention proves necessary, it has to be included within a more general synchronizing approach. Resynchronizing techniques lie on chronophysiology i.e. rhythms hygiena, control of sleep schedules, sleep restriction. Other non-pharmacological approaches include behaviorism, paradoxical injunctions, relaxation, psychotherapies. Prescription of hypnotics (benzodiazepine or non-benzodiazepine drugs) is sometimes necessary and must be submitted to certain rules including indications, contra-indications, length of treatment, specific withdrawal techniques.", 
    "30": "There is suggestive evidence that depression increases risk of myocardial infarction (MI), but there are no prospective studies in which the measure of depression corresponds to clinical criteria. This study examines prospectively whether a major depressive episode increases the risk of incident MI and evaluates the role of psychotropic medication use in this relationship.", 
    "31": "The study is based on a follow-up of the Baltimore cohort of the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study, a survey of psychiatric disorders in the general population. A history of major depressive episode, dysphoria (2 weeks of sadness), and psychotropic medication use were assessed in 1981, and self-reported MI was assessed in 1994. Sixty-four MIs were reported among 1551 respondents free of heart trouble in 1981. Compared with respondents with no history of dysphoria, the odds ratio for MI associated with a history of dysphoria was 2.07 (95% CI, 1.16 to 3.71), and the odds ratio associated with a history of major depressive episode was 4.54 (95% CI, 1.65 to 12.44), independent of coronary risk factors. In multivariate models, use of barbiturates, meprobamates, phenothiazines, and lithium was associated with an increased risk of MI, whereas use of tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines was not. Among individuals with no history of dysphoria, only lithium use was significantly associated with MI.", 
    "32": "These data suggest that a history of dysphoria and a major depressive episode increase the risk of MI. The association between psychotropic medication use and MI is probably a reflection of the primary relationship between depression and MI.", 
    "33": "An 8-year-old 38-kg spayed female Golden Retriever was admitted for vomiting, signs of abdominal pain on palpation, ataxia, anorexia, and generalized weakness of 2 days' duration. Ten hours prior to onset of clinical signs, the dog was found standing in and drinking from large pools of an accidentally spilled herbicide that contained an octanoic acid ester of bromoxynil (3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile) and an isooctyl ester of (2-methyl-4-chloro) phenoxyacetic acid (MCPA). Appendicular muscles were firm on palpation and persistent muscle contraction (myotonia > 1 minute duration) was found on muscle percussion, using a reflex hammer. Electrical activity indicative of myotonia was identified on electromyographic evaluation. With supportive treatment, the dog eventually recovered from suspected MCPA toxicosis. Although rare, MCPA toxicosis should be considered as a cause of acquired myotonia in dogs.", 
    "34": "Several decades of research have led to different hypotheses about cognitive functioning in depression; one of the hypotheses states that there is altered functioning of the hemispheres during a depressive episode. Lateralization studies have found diminished neuropsychological functioning in depressive patients; especially right-hemisphere functions seem impaired. In our study we used conventional neuropsychological tests to study shifts in hemispheric functioning. Neuropsychological testing before and after therapy in 52 (for the most part therapy-resistant) depressives showed no substantial effects in lateralized functioning. None of the measures enabled prediction of response to treatment; however 17 different interaction variables were identified, five of which make an unique contribution.", 
    "35": "Ten men inpatients who met DSM-III-R criteria for schizophrenia participated. On five occasions at least one week apart, each subject had an intravenous line placed at 0730 after an overnight fast. On each occasion blood samples were drawn at 0800 and hourly thereafter through 1200 noon for measurement of plasma homovanillic acid (HVA). Total four-hour urine collections were obtained for measurement of urinary HVA. Subjects received five experimental conditions, in randomized sequence: no intervention, smoking one cigarette per hour, drinking one caffeinated cola per hour, lorazepam 2 mg IV push, or a high monoamine meal. Baseline (0800) plasma HVA measures showed only minor intrinsic variability. The average standard deviation in baseline plasma HVA over five occasions of measurement was low relative to the changes in HVA produced during treatment with antipsychotic medications. The high monoamine meal significantly elevated plasma HVA, with a similar trend for urinary HVA. Neither caffeine, nicotine, nor lorazepam significantly affected plasma or urinary HVA.", 
    "36": "A two-step, general synthesis of 1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5-diones (BZDs) is presented. This synthesis employs an Ugi four-component condensation using a convertible isocyanide (1-isocyanocyclohexene), followed by an acid-activated cyclization reaction. This synthesis represents a dramatically improved route to BZDs over those currently in the literature. In addition, since amino acids are not used as inputs, the potential for molecular diversity is much greater than that with existing syntheses. It was also found that BZDs substituted with methylenes at the C-3 and N-4 positions display conformational isomerism in the NMR spectra at room temperature. Variable-temperature NMR experiments support this observation and offer the interesting conclusion that the BZD core structure, in certain examples, might not be as rigid as previously supposed.", 
    "37": "An increase in intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was observed following the application of nicotine to isolated adult dorsal unpaired median (DUM) neurons of the cockroach (Periplaneta americana) terminal abdominal ganglion (TAG) using Fura-2 fluorescence measurements. Bath-applied nicotine (1 mM) induced a transient increase in [Ca2+]i. Calcium responses to bath-applied nicotine were blocked completely by alpha-bungarotoxin (100 nM) and were reduced by 50% in the presence of pirenzepine (1 microM). The sensitivity of the response to both nicotinic and muscarinic antagonists suggested that it was mediated by an acetylcholine receptor with 'mixed' pharmacology. In whole cell current-clamp experiments, nicotine reduced the frequency of evoked action potentials by decreasing the slope of the predepolarization in the last two-thirds of the pacemaker potential. Voltage-clamp studies revealed that nicotine modified the inactivation properties of the maintained low-voltage-activated (LVA) calcium current increasing the rate of relaxation of this current and transforming a U-shaped voltage dependence of inactivation into a monotonic relationship to voltage. These effects were blocked when isolated DUM neurons were pretreated with 0.5 microM alpha-bungarotoxin. Our findings suggested a novel calcium-dependent regulation of firing behavior in TAG DUM neurons following activation of an acetylcholine receptor with 'mixed' pharmacology, resulting in a rise in [Ca2+]i which reduces firing frequency by modulating a maintained LVA calcium current responsible for the action potential predepolarization.", 
    "38": "The effects of ethanol and the benzodiazepine receptor ligand ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo-[1,5a] [1,4] benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (Ro 15-4513), were examined in NMRI mice exposed to small platform stress. This model contains several factors of stress, like rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation, isolation, immobilization, falling into water and soaking. In control mice, ethanol exerted an anxiolytic effect in the plus-maze, but did not further enhance the anxiolytic-like effects induced by small platform stress. Ro 15-4513 antagonized ethanol-induced sleep in control animals, but enhanced the hypnotic and lethal actions of ethanol in small platform stressed mice. Small platform stress did not alter the characteristics (KD and Bmax) of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding to cerebellar membranes. Muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake into brain microsacs was significantly reduced in cortex from small platform stressed animals. Ethanol had no effect on 36Cl- uptake into brain microsacs from cortex or cerebellum. It is proposed that small platform stress alters the activity of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor-chloride ionophore complex, causing changes in the interaction between ethanol and Ro 15-4513.", 
    "39": "The central and peripheral benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor antagonists, flumazenil (FLU) and PK 11195 (PK), administered intrathecally (IT) to diazepam (DZ)-dependent rats produced a precipitated abstinence syndrome. The scores for abstinence increased with increasing dose of FLU but not with increasing dose of PK. Twitches and jerks increased with increased doses of both. Head and body tremors were produced by FLU, but not by PK. Neither FLU nor PK precipitated abstinence in controls. In DZ-dependent rats IT administered FLU and PK did not significantly change the spectral content and the total power of the EEG. The data indicate that an abstinence syndrome is precipitated at the spinal level in DZ-dependent rats and that both central and peripheral BZ receptors are involved.", 
    "40": "In conferring the 1990s as the decade of the brain, clinicians and scientists have recognized schizophrenia as a priority disorder for the development of innovative therapies and the deployment of research resources. This article reviews the progress gained so far during this period which gives cause for optimism for better understanding and treatment of schizophrenia.", 
    "41": "In this study we have investigated the expression of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) and its endogenous ligand octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) in the sciatic nerve of the adult rat by immunohistochemistry. We have also determined the effect of nerve freezing lesion or chronic denervation on PBR and ODN expression. In the sciatic nerve of control rats PBR- and ODN-immunoreactivities (IR) were associated to Schwann cells. Ten days after nerve injury, PBR- and ODN-IR increased significantly in the distal stump. PBR-IR was associated to Schwann cells and macrophages, whereas ODN-IR was only detected in Schwann cells. Immunoreactivities returned to normal levels when axons were allowed to regenerate for 2 months after nerve freezing-injury. Under chronic denervation conditions, PBR- and ODN-IR remained elevated in the distal stump, at least for this period of time. These results suggest that PBR and ODN are regulated by signals from regenerating axons and that PBR and its endogenous ligand may play a role in peripheral nerve regeneration.", 
    "42": "We have studied the effects of the neuroleptic haloperidol and the non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics buspirone and lesopitron on the expression of c-Fos immunoreactivity in the rat forebrain. Haloperidol and buspirone administration resulted in a significant quantitative increase in the number of Fos-immunoreactive neurons in the lateral striatum and a presumable qualitative increase in the nucleus accumbens. In contrast, lesopitron did not lead to a significant increase in the c-Fos expression in the striatum. The induction of c-Fos immunoreactivity by buspirone is compatible with an interaction of this compound with D2 dopamine receptors, as documented for haloperidol. The lack of effects after lesopitron administration suggests that, in contrast with buspirone, this compound has no dopaminergic blocking activity.", 
    "43": "Norharman is a \u00df-carboline, possibly of endogenous origin, although cigarette smoking and food are sources too. In brain specific binding sites have been demonstrated. In higher doses norharman binds to benzodiazepine receptors and has MAO-B inhibitory activity. From animal experiments it can be concluded that norharman induces sedation and muscle relaxation. A role in psychosis is unclear, a role in the pathogenesis in anxiety is possible, but has to be further substantiated. As current research suggests, norharman may be an important factor in addiction and withdrawal.", 
    "44": "The athlete who panics or hyperventilates requires immediate stabilization and assessment to rule out more serious diagnoses. Repeated attacks may indicate panic disorder, which can be treated effectively with a combination of psychological and pharmacologic therapy. Drug options include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors.", 
    "45": "In order to study the potentials of indirect and direct detection of neuronal damages in humans by single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), we compared ex vivo cerebral biodistribution of [125I]PK 11195 with that of [125I]TISCH in a rat model of unilateral striatal excitotoxic lesion. Experiments on in vitro binding with [3H]PK 11195 as a ligand for peripheral type benzodiazepine binding sites (PTBBS) and [3H]SCH 23390 as a ligand for dopamine D1 receptors were also performed to validate our experimental model. We observed a very high increase in the PTBBS and a dramatic decrease in the D1 receptors on the lesioned striatum compared to the intact side. Moreover, we showed that [125I]PK 11195 bound specifically to PTBBS in lesioned cerebral areas ex vivo 5 days after striatal infusion of quinolinic acid (600 nmoles). Increases of 192%, 168%, and 30% were obtained in the striatum, the cortex, and the hippocampus, respectively, on the lesioned side. These results showed that iodinated PK 11195 bound specifically to PTBBS ex vivo and that this binding was dramatically increased at the sites of brain lesion. This ligand could therefore be suitable to detect brain injuries in humans by SPECT, complementing the information given by ligands which image loss in a specific neuron population.", 
    "46": "The purpose of the study was to determine the solubility and the intrinsic rates of dissolution of three crystal modifications, two anhydrate, and one dihydrate of alprazolam, a 1,4-benzodiazepine derivative. Solubility was determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry at different levels of pH, and intrinsic dissolution rates were determined by a rotating disk method. The apparent solubility of alprazolam crystal modifications was dependent on pH, being 8-10 mg/ml at pH 1.6 and 0.1 mg/ml at pH 5.0. The apparent solubility values for the anhydrate forms were similar, whereas the hydrate form showed lower apparent solubility at each pH. The mean intrinsic rates of dissolution for the anhydrate forms were 16 and 18 micrograms cm-2 min-1, and for the dihydrate modification 21 micrograms cm-2 min-1 at 50 rpm, respectively. At 75 rpm, the corresponding values were 22, 22, and 27 micrograms cm-2 min-1. The rate of intrinsic dissolution was also dependent on the pH. It can be concluded that the apparent solubility and the intrinsic dissolution rate of the anhydrate and hydrate forms were different. The obtained apparent solubility values at different levels of pH for the water-solvated crystal modification were evidently lower than those of the two anhydrate forms studied. Furthermore, the intrinsic rate of dissolution was significantly (p < 0.05) higher for the hydrate form of alprazolam.", 
    "47": "This general presentation reviews briefly the various psychotherapies proposed for panic attacks and agoraphobia treatment. Cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) is the only validated therapy. Behavioural model of agoraphobia and cognitive model of panic attacks are detailed. The main techniques are described. The results of controlled studies and meta-analyses demonstrate that CBT represents an alternative to anxiolytics and antidepressants. CBT is a brief form of therapy (10-20 sessions) which has been compared with waiting list, placebo, relaxation, antidepressants, anxiolytics or supportive therapy. Four meta-analyses agree on that in vivo exposure is a core element of the treatment of panic attacks and agoraphobia. They demonstrate also that agoraphobia is more difficult to treat than panic attacks in which placebo effect is quite powerful. Cognitive therapy centered on panic attacks demonstrated a significant effectiveness in controlled studies. CBT facilitates benzodiazepines withdrawal. Combination of in vivo exposure with high doses of benzodiazepines is counter-productive in the long term. Controlled studies are favorable to the combination of CBT with imipramine, SSRI (paroxetine, fluvoxamine) or buspirone. But the positive effects of these combinations are only found in the short term. CBT possesses the advantage of stable long term effects.", 
    "48": "The concept of Panic Disorders has itself been developed on the strength of therapeutic effects of drug treatments and it is therefore not surprising that psychotropic medications are currently the main therapeutic tool for this condition. Their use may be indicated in two differing circumstances, as treatment for Panic Attack itself or as a long-term treatment for what is properly called Panic Disorder. The latter scenario is that which has been most actively studied and represents the more original side of the question. Treatment of acute Panic Attack involves administration of sedative anxiolytics, principally benzodiazepines (BZD). Long-term treatment aiming to prevent repeated attacks is the core strategy for treatment for Panic Disorder. For the past fifteen years, a large number of research projects have shown the elective anti-panic efficacy of a number of drugs, principally antidepressants and anxiolytics. The response profile to anti-depressant treatment is characterized by a lag time which is sometimes longer than that observed when they are used solely as antidepressants; frequently they are also less well tolerated which necessitates a very gradual step-up in dosage. The \"classic\" MAOI (non-selective and irreversible) have a proven anti-panic effect. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) anti-depressants are currently drugs of choice in the treatment of Panic Disorder. Although the anti-panic effect appears to be common to all the various SSRI drugs available, and directly attributable to their mechanism of action, not all of them however have undergone controlled studies. In France, paroxetine is the first anti-depressant in this group to obtain a marketing authorization for this particular indication. The advantages of the SSRI drugs are principally related to their limited adverse effects and lack of toxicity, thereby making them particularly straightforward to use. Benzodiazepines (BZD) are the second group of psychotropic medications which have been shown to be effective in the treatment of Panic Disorder. The major disadvantage of the BZD for this indication is chiefly related to the major risk of promoting a dependency state with the corresponding appearance of a withdrawal syndrome when treatment is stopped. This risk constitutes a major stumbling block to the use of BZD as a first-line treatment for Panic Disorder. Various other drugs have been evaluated in the treatment of Panic Disorder with varying success. The current anti-panic pharmacopoeia therefore appears to be relatively well stocked. In this context, antidepressants-especially the SSRI drugs-are the first-line treatment of choice for Panic Disorders. In all cases, it appears useful to integrate pharmacological treatment within an overall management plan for the patient with Panic Disorder, especially if it is hoped to maintain therapeutic benefit long-term.", 
    "49": "The purpose of the present study is to assess the importance of pirenzepine, a selective M1 antimuscarinic drug, as hypotonic agent for diagnostic double-contrast studies of the upper gastrointestinal tract and for double-contrast barium enema studies of the large bowel. Pirenzepine and scopolamine methylbromide (SMB) (Buscopan) were compared in a single blind randomized trial. One hundred-thirty consecutive patients were enrolled in the study. Seventy of them underwent double-contrast studies of the stomach and duodenum and sixty double-contrast barium enema studies of the large bowel. Visceral distension and painting of stomach, duodenal bulb and large bowel and global quality of the images were blindly evaluated by 4 independent observers by means of a numerical score (1 to 4). Quantitative analysis of bowel distension was done measuring the maximum diameter of the transverse colon before and after drug administration. No differences were found in the diagnostic performance between the two drugs in the study of the duodenal bulb (2.8 +/- 0.8 vs 2.9 +/- 0.7, p = NS) and of the large bowel (3.0 +/- 0.6 vs 3.1 +/- 0.6, p = NS). Under SMB, slightly but significantly better results were obtained in the stomach (3.0 +/- 0.6 vs 2.7 +/- 0.6, p = 0.01). However, large bowel distension was slightly but significantly improved with Pirenzepine (68 +/- 12 vs 65 +/- 8 mm, p = 0.02). Heart rate and rhythm during the study were recorded by ECG. SMB induced tachycardia in all patients while pirenzepine did not. Moreover, after SMB, 3 patients exhibited faintness, some patients complained of visual accommodation defects, dryness of the mouth and dizziness. Under pirenzepine, no side-effects were reported. To conclude, pirenzepine gives good results in double contrast studies, as good as SMB but with no adverse effects; thus, it could be proposed as the hypotonic agent of choice in upper gastrointestinal and large bowel examinations.", 
    "50": "The objective of this study was to review the effectiveness and safety of antidepressants in neuropathic pain. In a systematic review of randomised controlled trials, the main outcomes were global judgements, pain relief or fall in pain intensity which approximated to more than 50% pain relief, and information about minor and major adverse effects. Dichotomous data for effectiveness and adverse effects were analysed using odds ratio and number needed-to-treat (NNT) methods. Twenty-one placebo-controlled treatments in 17 randomised controlled trials were included, involving 10 antidepressants. In six of 13 diabetic neuropathy studies the odds ratios showed significant benefit compared with placebo. The combined odds ratio was 3.6 (95% CI 2.5-5.2), with a NNT for benefit of 3 (2.4-4). In two of three postherpetic neuralgia studies the odds ratios showed significant benefit, and the combined odds ratio was 6.8 (3.5-14.3), with a NNT of 2.3 (1.7-3.3). In two atypical facial pain studies the combined odds ratio for benefit was 4.1 (2.3-7.5), with a NNT of 2.8 (2-4.7). Only one of three central pain studies had analysable dichotomous data. The NNT point estimate was 1.7. Comparisons of tricyclic antidepressants did not show any significant difference between them; they were significantly more effective than benzodiazepines in the three comparisons available. Paroxetine and mianserin were less effective than imipramine. For 11 of the 21 placebo-controlled treatments there was dichotomous information on minor adverse effects; combining across pain syndromes the NNT for minor (noted in published report) adverse effects was 3.7 (2.9-5.2). Information on major (drug-related study withdrawal) adverse effects was available from 19 reports; combining across pain syndromes the NNT for major adverse effects was 22 (13.5-58). Antidepressants are effective in relieving neuropathic pain. Compared with placebo, of 100 patients with neuropathic pain who are given antidepressants, 30 will obtain more than 50% pain relief, 30 will have minor adverse reactions and four will have to stop treatment because of major adverse effects. With very similar results for anticonvulsants it is still unclear which drug class should be first choice. Treatment would be improved if we could harness the dramatic improvement seen on placebo in some of the trials.", 
    "51": "Fifty patients with sleep-related breathing disorders were tested with nocturnal polysomnography and with nasendoscopic diurnal polysomnography after diazepam administration, and various indices of breathing disorders were examined, and the results obtained in the two sleep studies compared. There were no significant differences between the two sleep studies in either the type of apnoea or the indices of breathing disorder except for the longest duration of apnoea. There was a significant difference in the duration of REM sleep between the two sleep studies, but no significant difference in the duration of each stage of non-REM sleep. We speculate that nasendoscopic diurnal polysomnography with diazepam can be used as a substitute for nocturnal polysomnography in the clinical study of non-REM sleep stage but it is not sufficient in evaluating REM sleep stage, in patients with sleep-related breathing disorders without pathological obesity or abnormal respiratory function.", 
    "52": "The present study has been divided into two sets. In the first set, the aim of the experiments was to investigate the dose-response effect of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram on rat exploratory behaviour in the elevated plus-maze. In the second set of experiments, the effect of cholecystokinin (CCK) CCKA and CCKB receptor antagonists, devazepide and L 365260, on citalopram-induced decrease of exploratory behaviour in the elevated plus-maze was studied. Citalopram (5 and 10 mg/kg) decreased the number of open and total arm entries, line crossings on open arms, and percentage of time spent exploring in open arm. Dose 15 mg/kg was without any effect on rat exploratory behaviour. Devazepide (0.01 and 1.0 mg/kg) failed to modify any of the citalopram-induced changes observed. L 365260 (1.0 mg/kg) reversed most of the effects of citalopram: the numbers of open and total arm entries, the number of line crossings, and the percentage of time spent exploring in open arms. L 365260 at dose level 0.01 mg/kg was ineffective. These results support the involvement of the CCKB receptor subtype in SSRI-induced anxiogenic-like effects in rodents.", 
    "53": "Devazepide (L-364718, a non-peptide antagonist of CCK-A receptors), inhibits the proliferation and induces morphologic changes in the mucous-secreting, autonomously proliferating human cancer colon cell line (HT29-S-B6. Addition of devazepide (10 microM) for at least 3 days in the exponential phase of growth enhanced the baseline production of gastric M1 mucins 2-3-fold and that of carcinoembryonic antigens 5-fold. Moreover, devazepide induced an increase in the amount of the MUC-5AC mRNA expressed by HT29-S-B6 cells. The increased in mucins secretion induced by devazepide was persistent after removal and independent of the presence of serum. In conclusion, devazepide-L-364718 behaves as a maturation agent in the cell clone HT29-S-B6.", 
    "54": "Despite recent advances in its treatment, congestive heart failure associated with depressed left ventricular function continues to be associated with excess morbidity and mortality. Multiple factors may contribute to the progressively declining course of heart failure. Nocturnal arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation caused by sleep-disordered breathing could be a contributing factor, particularly because it has been associated with excess mortality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Cheyne and Stokes were the first to observe periodic breathing in patients with heart failure (Cheyne-Stokes respiration). However, relatively large-scale systematic studies have been performed only recently. We studied 42 patients with stable, optimally treated heart failure, without other co-morbid disorders: 19 patients (45%) had an apnea-hypopnea index of more than 20/hour. These episodes were associated with an excess number of arousals and arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation. Treatment options include nocturnal administration of oxygen, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and medications such as theophylline. Large-scale studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of these treatment options on quality of life, morbidity, and mortality of patients with heart failure.", 
    "55": "Propofol is commonly used in total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) for brief surgical procedures because it offers rapid recovery and has fewer side effects. However, concomittent use of other adjuvant agents has been considered so that the same anesthetic effects can be achieved at lower doses of propofol which is more expensive without compromising rapid recovery and increasing the adverse effects. This study was therefore designed to evaluate the co-administration of midazolam and propofol during anesthesia for endoscopic microsurgery and test its influences on the consumption of propofol and the quality of anesthesia.", 
    "56": "Forty-two patients receiving selective endoscopic microsurgery were enrolled in this study. All patients received high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) under TIVA. The control group (n = 21) received propofol (20 mg/5 s) during induction and 10 mg/kg/h as maintenance. The study group (n = 21) received midazolam (0.06 mg/kg) and propofol (20 mg/5 s) for induction with propofol 8 mg/kg/hr for maintenance. Doses of propofol, vital signs, recovery time, post-anesthetic high cortical function, and adverse events were evaluated and compared.", 
    "57": "Co-administration of midazolam and propofol in TIVA could reduce the induction dose and the total dose of propofol by 51% and 26% respectively but still achieve the same anesthetic effects. Vital signs and recovery were not influenced, and incidence of adverse effects did not increase.", 
    "58": "Our result suggests that co-administration of midazolam and propofol in TIVA appears to be safe, effective, and economic alternative to that with propofol alone. The effects were synergic but side effects were not.", 
    "59": "We report on two patients with severe rhabdomyolysis and peripheral nerve involvement after drug intoxication. Nerve conduction studies of the paretic extremities of both patients could be performed within 12 h of the onset. Several nerves revealed evidence of conduction blocks in the paretic extremities. One of the patients who had taken heroin died and postmortem examination was performed. A drug-induced immune vasculitis could not be demonstrated. Besides striated muscle necrosis, extensive myocardial fragmentation was shown. Territorial ischemia, resulting from systemic hypotension and mechanical compression of arteries, seems to have been the cause of the myonecroses and peripheral nerve damage in the unconscious patients.", 
    "60": "The use of AEDs in the management of epilepsy requires an ongoing risk-benefit analysis that attempts to maximize seizure control while minimizing adverse cognitive side-effects. Although the effects of other factors on cognition are generally greater than AED effects in patients with epilepsy, the cognitive effects of AEDs are of special concern because they are iatrogenically induced. Baseline evaluation of mental functioning is essential and should be repeated whenever a change in cognitive performance is suspected. The cognitive effects of the major AEDs, including phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate, appear modest when dosages are kept within standard therapeutic ranges and polypharmacy is avoided. Violation of these guidelines increases the risk of alterations in arousal, attention, memory and psychomotor functioning. In turn, dysfunction in these areas can contribute to deficits in higher cognitive processes. Evidence suggests that these primary and secondary deficits are relatively greater for benzodiazepines, bromide and phenobarbital. Initial studies involving the newer AEDs suggest that the cognitive profile of these drugs is favourable, but further research is required to determine their relative effects to each other and to the older AEDs. For some patients, optimal seizure management may require the use of polypharmacy or AED dosages that exceed the standard therapeutic range. In such cases, the physician should remain sensitive to the increased risk of cognitive side-effects. The impact of such effects will be greatest for those whose daily functioning requires sustained attention or psychomotor speed. Although the cognitive risks of AEDs appear rather modest for most adults, questions remain regarding the impact of AEDs on patients at extremes of age. Initial studies with children and older adults suggest that the effects of the major AEDs are comparable across the developmental lifespan. However, during the formative years of a child's intellectual development, close scrutiny should be paid to the possibility that subtle attentional or arousal deficits could contribute to cumulative deficits in learning or memory. Preliminary studies involving both animals and humans suggest that the impact of AEDs might be greatest during in utero exposure; however, additional research is required to fully delineate the long-term effects of AED exposure in this earliest period of neurodevelopment.", 
    "61": "The major established drugs used in the management of epilepsy are carbamazepine, valproic acid, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, ethosuximide and benzodiazepine drugs. Carbamazepine and phenytoin are used mainly in the treatment of partial seizures and primarily or secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Valproic acid is effective against all types of seizures, but it is used most extensively in the management of generalized epilepsies. Ethosuximide is effective against absence seizures. Phenobarbital and primidone are effective against all types of seizures (except for absences) although they are less commonly used because of their sedative properties and adverse effects on cognition. Benzodiazepines are most valuable in the treatment of status epilepticus, but their long-term use is often associated with undesirable sedation and development of tolerance to their antiepileptic effect. Irrespective of the drug used, optimal clinical management requires individualization of dosage and dosing schedules based on careful evaluation of clinical response and sound knowledge of the pharmacokinetics and interaction potential of the individual compounds. Monitoring serum drug concentrations may provide a useful guide to dosage adjustments, particularly in the case of phenytoin, which shows dose-dependent kinetics within the therapeutic dosage range.", 
    "62": "The objectives of the present study were to compare in a randomized double-blind crossover study design the concentration-effect relationships of Ro 48-6791, a new benzodiazepine agonist, and midazolam, following infusion in young and elderly male volunteers. Therefore, linearly increasing plasma concentrations were generated by computer controlled infusion pumps to achieve a deep hypnotic effect. The endpoint of the infusion was defined by loss of response to loud verbal commands and a median frequency of the recorded EEG power spectrum below 4 Hz. Arterial blood samples were collected in regular intervals up to 6 hours after cessation of the infusion. The method of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling was used to quantify the concentration-effect relationship, including age related differences, already in this early phase I study. The total clearance of Ro 48-6791 was found to be 1410 +/- 380 vs. 399 +/- 91 ml min-1 for midazolam (mean +/- SD; P < 0.005) and the central volume of distribution to be 20.5 +/- 7.1 vs. 7.9 +/- 3.0 l, respectively (P < 0.005). The comparison between young and elderly volunteers yielded for Ro 48-6791 a statistically not significant reduction of 16% for clearance with age and a slowed distribution of 47% for midazolam (P < 0.05). The recovery period for Ro 48-6791 was reduced by 66% (P < 0.005) in the young and 45% (P < 0.01) in the elderly, respectively, in comparison with midazolam. With respect to the total doses administered, Ro 48-6791 appeared to be 2.5 times as potent as midazolam in all volunteers (P < 0.001). Comparing both age groups, the doses necessary to cause similar effects were reduced by one half for both compounds in the elderly (P < 0.001). The major advantages of Ro 48-6791 compared to midazolam were its shorter duration of action as well as the faster recovery and thus the better controllability. Further investigations would have to confirm these results in a greater number of patients. The applied method of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling not only allowed to quantify the efficacy of Ro 48-6791 but also provided data to augment the safety for further investigations.", 
    "63": "A retrospective review of 239 patients with benign essential blepharospasm and Meige syndrome was performed in order to determine patients' long term treatment preferences.", 
    "64": "Of 239 patients evaluated, 228 received local injections of botulinum toxin, type A, into the eyelid and facial musculature over 11 years.", 
    "65": "Of 228 patients, 202 (72.1%) were still treated with botulinum toxin, type A. Eighteen patients (6.9%) no longer received botulinum toxin injections and sought no other treatment. Five patients (2.2%) had apparent remission of their disease after injection. Three patients (1.3%) ultimately obtained relief from orbicularis muscle extirpative surgery and required no additional treatment. Two of the 11 patients (4.6%) who chose not to receive botulinum toxin injections were successfully treated with other modalities: psychotherapy (one patient) and oral haloperidol (one patient).", 
    "66": "While botulinum toxin is the most highly effective treatment for benign essential blepharospasm and Meige syndrome over a long period of time, adjunctive oral drug therapy, including minor tranquillisers as well as eyelid surgery, may augment its effectiveness.", 
    "67": "This study was undertaken in 102 adult patients to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous (i.v.) midazolam in the setting of bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy (BMAT). Combined local anaesthetic (LA) and sedation was used in 87% of patients and 13% received LA alone. Amnesia occurred in all sedated patients with only 9% experiencing a mild degree of post-procedure pain. This contrasted sharply with the non-sedated group, in whom 85% had intense pain during the biopsy followed by protracted local discomfort in approximately 54%. Drowsiness and some psychomotor impairment were the only notable sedation-related side-effects in approximately 20%. None required assisted ventilation. There was a resounding patient preference for BMAT with sedation. Considering the ease of use, safety and efficacy of i.v. midazolam, the availability of flumazenil as a reversal agent and the undoubted positive effects on quality of life, we would advocate using it in BMAT provided that there were no contraindications.", 
    "68": "Great progress has been made in the development of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) from their early empirical stage until the current scientifically-founded advancement based on our greater understanding of the genesis of epilepsy. Available AEDs decrease neuronal membrane excitability, acting on ion channels or synaptic receptors. The classic AEDs act on sodium channels (phenytoin and carbamazepine); increase GABA-A receptor-mediated inhibition (benzodiazepines and barbiturates); and on T-type Ca2+ channels (sodium valproate and ethosuximide). Many patients are resistant to these AEDs. The introduction of new drugs whose mechanisms of action are not well established has improved therapeutic prospects. Four promising new AEDs are now available in many countries. Vigabatrin is an irreversible inhibitor of GABA transaminase. Lamotrigine blocks Na+ channels, thereby inhibiting the presynaptic release of excitatory neurotransmitters. Gabapentin increases GABAergic inhibition and Felbamate acts on the NMDA receptor and Na+ channels. New techniques in molecular biology are likely to facilitate the design of better AEDs.", 
    "69": "Prolonged or repeated seizures--or status epilepticus (SE)--presents diagnostic and therapeutic problems and is one of the most common neurologic emergencies. SE is defined as seizure lasting longer then 30 minutes or the repetition of at least two seizures within a short period of time, independently of the patient's state of consciousness or the type of seizure. At least 10% of epileptic patients suffer an SE during the course of their disease. Fifty percent of SEs appear in patients with no known history of epilepsy. SE is more frequent in symptomatic epilepsies, particularly those arising from trauma, tumor or infection. Most are found in epilepsies involving the frontal lobe. SE is present in nearly all epileptic syndromes, even idiopathic ones, although it is more frequent in cryptogenic and symptomatic forms. Tonic-clonic SE is the best known type and its diagnosis is simple. Partial SE, above complex partial SE, presents a diagnostic challenge. Particularly difficult is the differential diagnosis of complex partial SE and absence SE, above all the form termed late-onset de novo absence SE, which presents as confusional syndrome in the elderly. The treatment of SE, which is always a medical emergency, is based on intravenous benzodiazepines along with phenytoin, barbiturates or both. We discuss the utility of other drugs, such as lidocaine and valproic acid i.v., as well as the possibility of drugs like phosphenytoin becoming available in the near future.", 
    "70": "To determine the adequate models for studying the functions of pancreatic acinar cells, secretory responses to CCK and to CCK receptor antagonist, L-364, 718 were examined in freshly isolated cells and confluent monolayer cells. The results showed that as CCK concentration increased, releases of amylase and lipase increased dose-dependently reaching a maximum at 10(-9) M in acinar cells cultured in serum-containing media as well as in serum-free media. Acinar response to CCK was partially inhibited by L-364, 718, L-364, 718 itself had no effect on the releases of both amylase and lipase. Confluent monolayer of acinar cells released relatively low levels of enzymes and exhibited less response to CCK. In conclusion, short-term culture of acinar cells would be suitable to study the regulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion, and serum factors do not influence acinar response to the secretagogues. However, confluency of the acinar cells resulted in the loss of their secretory potential in the aspect of amylase and lipase release.", 
    "71": "Several studies have indicated that benzodiazepines influence immunity in both animals and humans. As these medications are commonly utilized by and for psychiatric patients, investigation of psycho-immunologic relationships in human psychiatric disorders may be confounded by use of these medications.", 
    "72": "We undertook an investigation for possible effects of recent benzodiazepine use on depression-immune relationships by comparing 43 patients with current major depressive disorder (MDD) who used benzodiazepines in the week prior to study to 27 patients with current MDD but no use of benzodiazepines in the past month. Both functional and ennumerative measures were investigated.", 
    "73": "We found no differences in absolute numbers of lymphocytes or the lymphocyte and NK functional measures. We did find differences between these two groups in the percentage of lymphocytes and of NK cells. Upon further analysis, controlling for symptom severity, these differences were shown to not be independently predicted by benzodiazepine use.", 
    "74": "Immune measures in subjects with current MDD and recent benzodiazepine use did not differ from those without such recent use. Therefore, such recent use is unlikely to confound PNI results.", 
    "75": "Some 2-arylpyrazolo[1,5-c][1,3]benzoxazin-5-ones 1 and 5- oxopyrazolo[1,5-c][1,3]benzoxazin-2-carboxylates 2 were prepared and biologically evaluated for their binding at benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) in rat cortical membranes. Structure-activity relationship studies suggest that, although proton donor d and proton acceptor a1 are both optional pharmacophoric descriptors, at least one of them must be present for good BZR affinity. When the proton donor d is not present, the heteroatom acceptor a1 is necessary either in the tricyclic core or in the appended substituent at the C-2 to obtain sub-micromolar BZR affinity.", 
    "76": "In order to examine the investigators' clinical suspicion that Vietnamese patients were more sensitive to the sedative effects of midazolam than were Caucasians, the pharmacokinetics of a single, weight-adjusted intravenous dose of midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) were compared in a group of healthy Caucasian and Vietnamese male volunteers. The Vietnamese group (n = 8) had a significantly lower height, lean body mass and mean weight (59.8 +/- 5.5 vs 72.1 +/- 8.1 kg, respectively) compared with the Caucasian group (n = 8). No significant differences were found between the Vietnamese and Caucasian groups with regard to distribution half-life of midazolam (8.38 +/- 13.1 vs 1.49 +/- 0.63 min, respectively), elimination half-life (2.49 +/- 1.80 vs 1.48 +/- 0.66 h, respectively), clearance (4.93 +/- 1.31 vs 5.90 +/- 2.12 mL/min per kg, respectively), steady state volume of distribution (0.863 +/- 0.497 vs 0.530 +/- 0.132 L/kg, respectively) or percentage of unbound drug in plasma (4.89 +/- 0.74 vs 4.11 +/- 1.08, respectively). This suggests that dosage of midazolam in Vietnamese should be based on total bodyweight. Two Vietnamese subjects who were brothers had marked elevation of distribution half-life and initial volume of distribution and lesser elevations in elimination half-life and volume of distribution at steady state. This suggests that the known subgroup of subjects who demonstrate dyshomogeneity in midazolam volume of distribution may be genetically determined.", 
    "77": "Acute effects of oral flunitrazepam (0.5 and 1 mg), nitrazepam (5 and 10 mg) and placebo were assessed on direct (free recall of words and prose, stem-cued recall) and indirect (stem and fragment completion) memory tasks. Fifty health volunteers took part in this double-blind, independent group study. The relative effects of the two benzodiazepines (BZs) on memory revealed a different pattern from their effects on alertness, indicating that their amnesic effects are not totally secondary to their sedative effects. The higher dose of flunitrazepam impaired free recall of words and prose but not cued recall, while neither drug affected the two indirect tasks. Differences in drug effects on the direct and indirect memory tasks were discussed in terms of resource demands of the various tests. We conclude that whether BZs impair performance on memory tasks depends more on the cues given at retrieval than the retrieval instructions (direct/indirect). The implications for this in terms of BZ amnestic effects are drawn out for contextual encoding deficits induced by BZs.", 
    "78": "We administered a mixture of uracil and tegafur (UFT)/cisplatin (CDDP) chemotherapy in 28 patients with scirrhous gastric cancer. In the regimen, UFT was orally administered at a dose of 200 mg/m2 twice a day. The CDDP was administered at a dose of 90 mg/m2 by 24-hour continuous infusion every 4 weeks. As a result, antitumor effects for primary gastric foci were achieved in 14 of the 28 patients (50%). Ascites from peritoneal dissemination disappeared completely in eight of 13 patients (62%). Total gastrectomy was performed in ten patients after 2 to 3 courses of chemotherapy. Histological response grades assessed on the resected specimen were Grade 2 in four, Grade 1b in three, Grade 1a in one and Grade 0 in two patients. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is feasible against scirrhous gastric cancer and a subsequent prospective randomized trial should be prepared to clarify the survival benefit of the treatment.", 
    "79": "Although a decrease in new prescribing has occurred for anxiolytic benzodiazepines, concerns have been raised that a 'core' of long-term users has been left behind. Typically, elderly people represent this 'core', using the benzodiazepines as hypnotics.", 
    "80": "The present study focuses on the reasons why hypnotic benzodiazepines are used for protracted lengths of time. By examining patient experiences and cognitions, a deeper understanding may be gained of why patients continue to use benzodiazepines.", 
    "81": "Elderly, long-term users of benzodiazepine hypnotics were interviewed using a semi-structured interview procedure. A comparison group of non-users of the drugs were given a brief interview to collect comparative data. Interview data were analysed from transcripts using qualitative methodology; statistical comparisons between the groups were made using non-parametric statistics.", 
    "82": "The long-term users had significantly fewer hours of sleep per night than the non-users. There was some evidence of tolerance and a suggestion that symptoms of withdrawal were maintaining continual use. None of the long-term users had clean knowledge of what their doctors thought of their use of benzodiazepines.", 
    "83": "The data suggest that the power of the doctor may not be utilized to its full potential in the prevention of long-term use, that at least 50% of elderly benzodiazepine users would like to discontinue use, and that patients need information and advice on how to discontinue these drugs.", 
    "84": "A large series of 2-aryl-2,5-dihydropyridazino[4,3-b]indol-3(3H)ones (PIs) carrying properly selected substituents at the indole and N2-phenyl rings was prepared and tested as central benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) ligands and potential (anti)convulsant agents. Stereoelectronic requirements for high receptor affinity were detected by means of 2-D and 3-D QSAR analyses. BZR affinities and pharmacological profiles of the compounds were examined in comparison with some other pyridazinoindolones recently described by us and with pyrazoloquinoline (PQ) analogues. An anticonvulsant activity greater than PQs was generally observed for PIs. Notably, in the test of audiogenically induced seizures, one compound showed a potency comparable to that of diazepam.", 
    "85": "Status epilepticus refractory to first-line therapy is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Correct diagnosis and adequate treatment of this condition require electrographic monitoring and anaesthetic facilities available in specialist intensive care units (ICUs). We carried out an audit of 26 patients admitted to a neurological ICU with a diagnosis of status epilepticus, to identify deficiencies in diagnosis and management prior to transfer to the ICU, and examine the effectiveness of ICU management. Or transfer, only 14 (54%) were in status epilepticus; six were in drug-induced coma or were encephalopathic, and six had pseudostatus epilepticus, of whom four had been intubated. The commonest treatments prior to transfer were benzodiazepines, chlormethiazole and phenytoin; the loading dose of phenytoin was adequate in at least 7/16 cases. All those in status epilepticus on transfer had their seizures successfully controlled, but ten required general anaesthesia with thiopentone, propofol, ketamine or midazolam. Two died--one had a severe encephalitis and the other had had a cardiac arrest prior to treatment. This study highlights deficiencies in the initial diagnosis and management of status epilepticus, the role of specialist neurological intensive care, and the importance of early referral.", 
    "86": "The basis for sex-specific differences in chemically-induced and age-related aneuploidy of mammalian germ cells is still unknown. We have analysed the maturation of isolated mouse oocytes to characterize the mechanisms underlying drug-induced aneuploidy produced by two compounds, chloral hydrate (CH) and diazepam (DZ). When administered in vivo both drugs increase hyperploidy in male but not in female germ cells. In the assay presented here we show that both CH and DZ caused meiotic delay in in vitro maturing mouse oocytes. CH blocked meiotic progression irreversibly, affecting even dictyate stage oocytes. DZ-exposure slowed down maturation but many oocytes may eventually develop to metaphase II. Under the influence of CH asymmetric spindles were formed. Often chromosomes failed to align properly. This appeared to be responsible for triggering a meiotic checkpoint which arrests oocytes in meiosis I. Many oocytes escaping the block became 'diploid'. Lagging of chromosomes at anaphase I may contribute to significant rises in hypoploidy, while the scattering of chromosomes at metaphase II and the premature decondensation of chromatin may also predispose oocytes to the formation of structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations during meiosis II. In contrast, diazepam appeared to enhance the resumption of meiosis in immature oocytes at pharmacologically relevant doses, and only at high concentrations lead to a prominent meiotic arrest/delay. Importantly, several oocytes matured for 16 h in 25 micrograms/ml DZ displayed scattered chromosomes on the spindle and were hyperploid. Concomitantly, precocious separation of homologues occurred after DZ, and oocytes contained uneven numbers of chromatids, suggesting equational division at anaphase I. Cytoplasmic maturation. e.g., association of mitochondria with the spindle was disturbed by DZ. We compared the potential of the in vitro test to evaluate the aneugenic potential, the targets, threshold concentrations and long-lasting effects of relevant environmental pollutants on mammalian oogenesis with the in vivo findings, and evaluated the basis for sex-specific responses to aneugens.", 
    "87": "To determine the acceptance by patients of transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) under local anaesthesia.", 
    "88": "The study comprised 30 consecutive patients who elected to undergo local anaesthesia for TUIP and were treated between December 1994 and September 1995. Twenty-two were considered a high risk for general anaesthesia and eight patients chose local anaesthesia for personal reasons. Patients were premedicated (opioid and benzodiazepine) and 1% lidocaine was infiltrated transurethrally using an endoscopic needle. The level of acceptance was determined using an immediate post-operative questionnaire which included a linear visual analogue scale (VAS) to rate pain.", 
    "89": "No patient required conversion to another type of anaesthesia and there were no complications related to the local anaesthesia. The mean (SE) VAS score was 3.2 (1.7) and the questionnaire results showed that 83% of the patients did not consider that general anaesthesia was necessary for the operation and that 90% would agree to undergo the procedure again under local anaesthesia.", 
    "90": "TUIP under local anaesthesia was well tolerated in motivated patients. We recommend it as the operation of choice for the relief of obstruction in high-risk patients with a small benign prostatic hyperplasia.", 
    "91": "Intrathecal midazolam causes antinociception by combining with spinal cord benzodiazepine receptors. This effect is reversible with doses of naloxone, suggesting involvement of spinal kappa or delta but not mu opioid receptors. The antinociceptive effects of intrathecally administered drugs in the spinal cord were demonstrated by measurements of the electrical current threshold for avoidance behaviour in rats with chronically implanted lumbar intrathecal catheters. A comparison was made of suppression by two opioid selective antagonists (nor-binaltorphimine (kappa selective) and naltrindole (delta selective)) of spinal antinociception caused by equipotent doses of opioids selective for different receptor subtypes (U-50488H (kappa), DSLET and DSBULET (delta), fentanyl (mu)) and the benzodiazepine midazolam. Nor-binaltorphimine selectively suppressed the effects of U-50488H but not midazolam or fentanyl. However, the delta selective antagonist, naltrindole, caused dose-related suppression of antinociception produced by both delta opioid agonists and midazolam with the same ED50 (0.5 nmol). We conclude that intrathecal midazolam caused spinally mediated antinociception in rats by a mechanism involving delta opioid receptor activation.", 
    "92": "A case of repetitive hallucinations during treatment with a therapeutic dosage of triazolam (0.25 mg/day) and nitrazepam (5 mg/day) is presented. The patient suffered from acute pneumonia and chronic renal failure. Such non-psychotic symptoms as anxiety, tremor and depressed feeling were observed initially. However, after co-administration of erythromycin (600 mg/day), visual hallucinations and abnormal bodily sensations developed repeatedly after each administration of triazolam or nitrazepam. This report suggests that benzodiazepine hypnotics even at a therapeutic dosage with co-administration of erythromycin causes serious psychotic symptoms in vulnerable patients with physical complications.", 
    "93": "Terfenadine is metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 3A subfamily of enzymes (CYP3A). Certain macrolide antibiotic agents inhibit CYP3A and, when coadministered with terfenadine, result in a drug interaction. The authors compared the abilities of dirithromycin (a new macrolide antibiotic agent), its major metabolite erythromycylamine, and the known CYP3A substrate terfenadine to inhibit CYP3A in vitro. The hydroxylation of midazolam in human liver microsomes was used as a probe for CYP3A activity. Dirithromycin and erythromycylamine were low affinity inhibitors of CYP3A (inhibitory binding affinities of 493 mumol/L and 701 mumol/L, respectively); conversely, terfenadine was a moderate affinity inhibitor (inhibitory binding affinity of 28 mumol/L). Based on these data, the authors tested the hypothesis that dirithromycin would not interact with terfenadine in humans. Six healthy men received terfenadine alone (60 mg twice daily) for 8 days, after which dirithromycin (500 mg once daily) was added to the terfenadine regimen for an additional 10 days. The pharmacokinetics of terfenadine (and its acid metabolite) and the QTc interval were measured during both treatments, and it was found that neither parameter was affected. In this study, dirithromycin was found to have low affinity for human CYP3A in vitro, which is in accordance with the study's finding that in vivo dirithromycin has no major effect on the metabolism of the CYP3A substrate terfenadine in humans.", 
    "94": "Our results suggest that the cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist L-364,718 has a protective effect on taurocholate-induced pancreatitis, and thus, it is inferred that CCK may have a significant pathophysiological role in the early phase of pancreatitis.", 
    "95": "Conflicting results have been obtained from studies designed to determine the role of CCK in the initial stages of pancreatitis.", 
    "96": "We evaluated the protective effect of the CCK receptor antagonist L-364,718 (devazepide) and of the trypsin inhibitor camostat, on taurocholate-induced pancreatitis in rats. L-364,718 (1 mg/kg) or camostat (200 mg/kg) was administered intragastrically 30 min before the induction of pancreatitis.", 
    "97": "Infusion of sodium taurocholate (50 mg/kg) into the pancreaticobiliary duct caused severe pancreatitis with marked hyperamylasemia and reduction of tissue enzyme content at 12 h postinfusion. Pretreatment with L-364,718, but not with camostat, caused significant improvement in signs of experimental pancreatitis based on tissue enzyme content and morphology. Compared with untreated pancreatitis, there was relatively well-preserved lobular architecture, less edema, less infiltration of inflammatory cells, and more zymogen granules after L-364,718 pretreatment. Moreover, the reduction of enzyme content owing to pancreatitis was ameliorated by L-364,718 pretreatment.", 
    "98": "The use of interactive mixtures of drugs adhering to the surface of carriers can promote drug dissolution. The mechanism of dissolution of such mixtures has been studied using the rotating-disc method under conditions eliminating secondary influences such as carrier surface characteristics and drug particle aggregation. Levich plots were used to characterize the dissolution behaviour. Diazepam-compactrol interactive mixtures had initial dissolution rates similar to that of pure diazepam owing to the deposition of a continuous layer of diazepam on the disc surface from the interactive mixture. Linear Levich plots were produced at all drug loadings and the presence of compactrol in the disc slightly enhanced dissolution rates. Dissolution rates for diazepam-emcompress interactive mixtures were lower than those of pure diazepam. The Levich plots for these systems were non-linear with increasing negative curvature as the diazepam loading decreased. The rate of dissolution of diazepam in the lactose interactive mixture was markedly higher than that of pure diazepam, but high diazepam loadings in the lactose mixtures inhibited diazepam dissolution. Rapid carrier dissolution caused surface retraction of the disc, enhancing the dissolution rate. The Levich plots showed an upward curvature due to turbulence. Linear Levich plots for diazepam and other benzodiazepines and for diazepam-compactrol interactive mixtures showed that their dissolution in pH 5 phosphate buffer was diffusion-controlled. The Levich plots for diazepam-emcompress interactive mixtures were indicative of some interfacial control during dissolution, but the hypothesis of common ion precipitation of dissolved carrier, calcium phosphate, onto the disc surface did not fully explain this effect.", 
    "99": "The influence of progesterone and oestrogens on the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in mice was studied. The intraperitoneal administration of 15 mg/kg of flumazenil induced a withdrawal syndrome in chronic diazepam-treated mice, characterized by jerks, usually accompanied by tail lifts, and seizures. The principal finding of the present work is that the intensity of diazepam withdrawal syndrome was significantly reduced by acute administration of progesterone as revealed by a low incidence of jerks and seizures. The action of progesterone could be due to a modulatory role of the hormone on neuronal activity as an anxiolytic agent. The modulatory activity of progesterone appears to be related to changes in the pharmacological properties of benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "100": "Gastrin, histamine and acetylcholine are physiological stimuli of gastric acid secretion. The cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor antagonists YM022 and RP73870 were used to study the effect of gastrin receptor blockade on acid secretion. Gastrin, histamine, insulin or bethanechol were administered to conscious gastric fistula rats with or without the concomitant intravenous infusion of YM022 or RP73870. Other rats were subjected to pylorus ligation. YM022 and RP73870 inhibited the gastrin-induced acid secretion in a dose- and time-dependent manner; maximal inhibition was observed at a dose of 0.3 mumol.kg-1.hr-1 for both YM022 and RP73870, the ID50 values being 0.02 mumol.kg-1.hr-1 and 0.05 mumol.kg-1.hr-1 for YM022 and RP7870, respectively. At a dose of 0.3 mumol.kg-1.hr-1 YM022 and RP73870 failed to inhibit basal and histamine-, bethanechol-, and insulin-evoked secretion. They also failed to affect the secretion evoked by infusion of a cocktail of maximally effective doses of gastrin-17, histamine and bethanechol. YM022 and RP73870, finally, were without effect on the acid response to pylorus ligation. We suggest that endogenous gastrin in the conscious rat does not contribute to the basal acid secretion and does not participate in the acid response to histamine or to vagus stimulation.", 
    "101": "The current paper examines critically the literature on deaths attributed to heroin overdose, and examines the characteristics and circumstances of such deaths. In particular, the dominance of the widely held belief that heroin-related fatalities are a consequence of overdose is challenged. Deaths attributed to overdose represented in the literature are typically older, heroin-dependent males not in drug treatment at the time of death. Fatalities involving only heroin appear to form a minority of overdose occasions, the presence of other drugs (primarily central nervous system depressants such as alcohol and benzodiazepines) being commonly detected at autopsy. Furthermore, deaths attributed to overdose are likely to have morphine levels no higher than those who survive, or heroin users who die from other causes. It is concluded that the term overdose is, in many cases, a misleading term, since it implies the same mechanism of death in all cases, an implication that is neither clinically useful nor consistent with published data. Implications for the prevention of heroin-related deaths are discussed.", 
    "102": "A muscarinic cholinergic receptor (mAchR) is present in the non-neuronal epithelial cell line from Chironomus tentans. Scatchard plot analysis (KD = 1.4 nM) using the non-selective antagonist quinuclidinylbenzilate (QNB), as well as kinetic data (KD = 1.7 nM), reveals one class of high affinity binding sites. About 2000 binding sites/cell are present. The receptor concentration (54.5 +/- 7.5 fmol/mg protein) is comparable to the values reported from insect brain. The receptor interacts only with muscarinic ligands; nicotinergic acetylcholine receptors are not present. Binding properties are not comparable to any of the muscarinic subtypes known from vertebrate tissues. The rank order of competition of radiolabelled QNB is: QNB > atropine > PrBCM > oxotremorine, pirenzepine > methoctramine. The competition curve obtained with carbamylcholine is shifted to higher ligand concentrations in the presence of Gpp(NH)p and to lower carbamylcholine concentrations by 1 mM NEM. With antibodies against muscarinic receptor from calf brain one band with a molecular weight of about 80 kDa is detected on Western blots. The moulting hormone 20-OH-ecdysone transiently increases the concentration of muscarinic receptor.", 
    "103": "We used the type A cholecystokinin receptor (CCK-AR) antagonist devazepide to assess the importance of CCK in mediating the anorexia produced by 2-h duodenal infusions of glucose (9.2, 11.0, and 18.3 mmol.kg-1.h-1) and the glucose dimer maltose (4.5, 6.7, and 8.5 mmol.kg-1.h-1) at the start of the dark period in nonfasted rats with free access to food. Glucose and maltose appeared to inhibit 2- to 3-h food intakes dose dependently from 19 to 91%. The highest doses of glucose and maltose administered suppressed feeding similarly by increasing first meal latency and decreasing meal frequency; lower doses produced less reliable effects on meal patterns. Devazepide appeared to completely reverse the cumulative intake responses and some of the meal pattern responses to the 9.2-mmol.kg-1.h-1 dose of glucose and to partially attenuate responses to the two higher glucose doses and to the minimal effective dose of maltose (6.7 mmol.kg-1.h-1). The magnitudes of these devazepide effects were not statistically different from those produced by devazepide when vehicle was infused duodenally. These results suggest that CCK may play a significant necessary role in mediating the satiety response to duodenal delivery of small but not large loads of glucose.", 
    "104": "We investigated the role of M1 and M3 receptors in regulating exocrine secretion from acini isolated from rat sublingual glands. In secretion experiments, we derived affinity values (KB) from Schild regression analysis for the antagonists pirenzepine (61.0 nM) and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP; 1.06 nM). The KB for 4-DAMP is similar to its affinity value [equilibrium dissociation constant from competition studies (Ki); 1.81 nM] determined from radioligand competition experiments. In contrast, the KB for pirenzepine is between its high-affinity (17.6 nM) and low-affinity (404 nM) Ki values. In separate secretion experiments, we found that the M1 receptor antagonist, M1-toxin, induces a rightward shift in the concentration-response curve to muscarinic agonist and inhibits maximal secretion by 40%. The inhibitory effect of M1-toxin appears specific for M1 receptor blockade, since the toxin abolishes acinar high-affinity pirenzepine-binding sites and does not inhibit secretion induced by nonmuscarinic agents. Additional pharmacological studies indicate muscarinic receptors do not function through putative neural elements within isolated acini. Our combined results are consistent with both M1 and M3 receptors directly regulating mucous acinar exocrine secretion and indicate M3 receptors alone are insufficient to induce a maximal muscarinic response.", 
    "105": "We investigated the physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties of a solid dispersion (SD) derived from a solution of the poorly water-soluble drug (R)-1-[2,3-dihydro-1-(2'-methylphenacyl)-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1, 4-benzodiazepin-3-yl]-3-(3-methylphenyl)urea (YM022), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose 2910 (TC-5E) and polyoxyethylene hydrogenated caster oil 60 (HCO-60). Colloidal particles produced when the SD was dispersed into water had a mean diameter of 160 nm and contained 67-77% YM022. Powder X-ray diffractometry showed that YM022 existed in the colloidal particles in an amorphous state. The particle diameter and YM022 content remained unchanged during storage for 7 d, confirming that the colloidal solution was stable. On oral administration to rats, good absorption was observed for both the colloidal solution prepared immediately before and the sample stored for 7 d before administration. Thus, the stability of this colloidal solution of SD was confirmed by in vitro storage tests and by in vivo absorption experiments in rats.", 
    "106": "The effects of long-term oral administration of low doses of caffeine (0.3 g/l) and its metabolites theophylline, theobromine and paraxanthine (each at 0.5 g/l in drinking water) on bicuculline- and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures and c-fos expression were studied in mice. In addition, adenosine and benzodiazepine receptor density was examined. The plasma levels of the methylxanthines were much higher during the active period at night than during the day. The maximal level of caffeine was 14 microM. Brain theophylline levels (8-13 nmol/g) tended to be higher and more constant than brain caffeine levels in caffeine-consuming mice. Clonic seizures induced by bicuculline (4 mg/kg i.p.) were significantly reduced in severity by 14 day caffeine treatment and mortality was also reduced. Long-term treatment with caffeine metabolites was less effective. The seizures induced by PTZ (60 mg/kg i.p.) were also significantly reduced by long-term caffeine treatment. After bicuculline or PTZ treatment, c-fos mRNA expression was weaker in the cerebral cortex in animals receiving caffeine, irrespective of whether the animals had seizures or not. No significant changes in the binding of adenosine receptor ligands or benzodiazepines were seen after long-term caffeine treatment. These results show that long-term treatment with caffeine in a dose that is commonly seen in humans decreases the seizures induced by bicuculline, and to a lesser extent, those induced by PTZ. This may be related to a decreased neuronal excitability. The effect is due to the combined effects of theophylline, to which caffeine is metabolized in brain, and caffeine itself, but could not be ascribed to changes in A1 and A2A adenosine or benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "107": "Although social phobia is thought to be a chronic disorder, little is known about its long-term course in patients who engage in brief treatment studies. We, therefore, conducted a follow-up study of social phobics who had participated in a brief, placebo-controlled treatment trial of clonazepam. Of the original 75 subjects, 56 were assessed through telephone interview and self-report questionnaires that evaluated current social phobia symptoms. Information was also gathered about treatment received in the 2-year interval since the initial pharmacotherapy trial. The group as a whole showed maintenance of the gains acquired during initial treatment. On a number of symptom scales, subjects initially treated with clonazepam exhibited significantly less severe scores compared with placebo subjects. This study provides evidence of long-term benefit for social phobics when treated with a brief medication trial.",

Diazepam is used in acute chloroquine intoxication on the basis of clinical and experimental observations, but its utility alone, in man, remains unproven.

    "119": "After clinical evaluation of depth of sedation according to the Ramsay sedation score, the RR variability over 512 RR intervals and predominant respiratory rate were measured. The power spectrum of RR variability was calculated by a fast Fourier transformation and the resulting total frequency band (0.016-0.35 Hz) was subdivided into a very low, a low, and a high frequency band. Stepwise multiple regression analysis in the first 10 patients (group 1) showed a significant relationship between depth of sedation and measures of RR variability combined with respiratory rate (r2 = 0.59; F = 12.1; p < 0.001). The more effective sedation was, the more depressed were both RR variability and predominant respiratory rate. Mean heart rate, mean respiratory rate, median deviation of RR intervals from the mean, and the ratio between spectral power density in the high and the low frequency bands proved to be the most important predictors of the Ramsay score (+/-1 level accuracy: 87%, p < 0.001). Using this regression equation, the Ramsay score was predicted in the remaining 10 patients (group 2) with a +/-1 level of accuracy of 81% (p < 0.001).",

    "121": "Manipulations of GABA function have been found to produce highly variable effects in animal models of anxiety. In the present series, an ethological version of the murine elevated plus-maze was used to examine in detail the behavioural profiles of diazepam (1.5 mg/kg; positive control) and a range of GABA-related compounds: valproic acid (100-400 mg/kg), No-711 (1.25-10.0 mg/kg), muscimol (0.5-3.0 mg/kg), (+)bicuculline (4.0-8.0 mg/kg), picrotoxin (0.25-2.0 mg/kg), R(+)baclofen (0.375-3.0 mg/kg) and CGP 35348 (25-200 mg/kg). On both conventional and ethological indices, results confirmed the anxiolytic profile of diazepam under present test conditions, and revealed substantially similar effects for the GABA-T inhibitor, valproic acid (100-400 mg/kg), and the GABAA receptor agonist, muscimol (2 mg/kg). The GABA reuptake inhibitor, No-711, produced weak anxiolytic-like effects at low doses (1.25-2.5 mg/kg) but disrupted behaviour at the highest dose tested (10 mg/ kg). Although the GABAA receptor antagonists, (+)bicuculline and picrotoxin, produced changes indicative of anxiety enhancement, concomitant behavioural suppression was evident at high doses (8 mg/kg and 1-2 mg/kg, respectively). Further studies suggested that the effects observed with bicuculline may be mediated by an active metabolite, such as bicucine. In contrast to the effects of valproic acid and direct GABAA receptor manipulations, the GABAB receptor agonist, R(+) baclofen, non-specifically disrupted behaviour at the highest dose tested (3 mg/kg) while the GABAB receptor antagonist, CGP 35348, was inactive over the dose range studied. Although present data confirm the sensitivity of the plus-maze to agents which modify GABAA receptor function, further studies will be required in order more fully to characterize this relationship.", 
    "122": "1. Focal cortical epilepsy was investigated by applying tetanic stimulation repeatedly (100 Hz. 2 s in duration, once every 10 min, 10 episodes) to layer III association fibers in rat piriform cortex slices and recording both extracellular and intracellular responses from the endopiriform nucleus. To promote excitability, piriform slices were incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing 0.9 mM Mg2+ and 5 mM K+, at an initial temperature of 10-12 degrees C, which was allowed to warm passively to room temperature. 2. Responses recorded extracellularly in the endopiriform nucleus consisted of two types: weak stimulation evoked an early-occurring, small-amplitude, negatively deflecting potential; strong stimulation evoked a more complex response comprising both an early potential of maximal amplitude and a later-occurring epileptiform potential of greater amplitude and longer duration. Late-occurring epileptiform potentials were not observed in slices incubated in ACSF at room temperature. 3. Both the early potential and the late-occurring epileptiform responses were abolished by the non-N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (non-NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor blocker, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; 10 microM). Application of D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV; 50 microM) to block NMDA receptors was without effect on the early potential but diminished the late-occurring epileptiform potential. The late-occurring potential was unable to follow stimulation delivered at a frequency of 1 Hz. These results suggest that the early potential was generated monosynaptically and dependent solely on the activation of non-NMDA receptors, whereas the late-occurring epileptiform potential was polysynaptic in origin and possessed both a CNQX- and an APV-sensitive component. 4. Responses increased progressively in both amplitude and duration after tetanic stimulation. The threshold intensity required to evoke the complex dual-component potential was reduced by tetanic stimulation. An increase in multiunit spiking activity, indicating an increase in synchronous discharges, was also observed. A residual potential could be evoked in the presence of CNQX (10 microM) after the tetanic stimulation procedure. 5. Spontaneous discharges occurred as early as after the first episode of tetanic stimulation and persisted for the duration of the experiment. Spontaneous discharges were abolished by either CNQX or by a fourfold increase in extracellular Mg2+ concentration, the latter reversibly. APV reduced the frequency of spontaneous discharges by 38.6 +/- 9.3% (mean +/- SE). The conventional anticonvulsant drug 5,5-diphenylhydantoin, the benzodiazepine receptor agonist midazolam, and the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil were without effect on the frequency of spontaneous discharges. Evoked responses were also unaffected by either 5,5-diphenylhydantoin or midazolam. Slices not exposed to cold ACSF, although demonstrating potentiation of evoked responses after tetanization did not produce spontaneous epileptiform discharges. 6. Intracellular recordings from endopiriform neurons revealed the cellular correlates of the extracellular responses. Weak stimulation evoked a small-amplitude depolarizing potential. Increasing the intensity of stimulation increased the amplitude of this response and also evoked a second depolarizing potential of greater amplitude occurring at variable latencies. Maximal stimulation evoked an action potential. After tetanic stimuli, responses resembling a paroxysmal depolarizing shift consisting of a depolarizing potential with superimposed multiple action potentials were evoked reliably. Passive membrane properties after repeated tetanic stimulation were not different when compared with control. 7. This novel model of in vitro focal cortical epilepsy has many features characteristic of conventional kindling including 1) progressive nature; 2) reduced threshold to evoke discharges; and 3) persist", 
    "123": "1. Intracellular recordings were made from slices of guinea pig spinal trigeminal nucleus pars caudalis (SG). 2. Muscarine [0.3-30 microM; half maximally effective concentration (EC50) = 2.9 microM] hyperpolarized 61% of SG neurons. The effect was mimicked by carbachol (0.3-30 microM; EC50 = 3.9 microM) and antagonized by pirenzepine (1 microM). Thirty-four percent of the neurons were depolarized by muscarine and carbachol (1-30 microM: EC50 = 5.7 microM), and the effect was antagonized by pirenzepine (100 nM). 3. In approximately 80% of recordings, muscarine (10-30 microM) evoked repetitive spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) that were sensitive to bicuculline (10 microM). 4. Muscarine (1-30 microM; EC50 = 3 microM) decreased the amplitude of the majority of evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), and the effect was mimicked by carbachol and antagonized by pirenzepine (100 nM). 5. These results indicate that there are at least three mechanisms by which muscarine inhibits SG neurons: 1) hyperpolarization through activation of non-M1 receptors; 2) activation of gamma-amino-butyric acid-containing interneurons that mediate IPSPs in a subset of neurons; and 3) a decrease in evoked EPSP amplitude. Muscarine can also activate SG neurons via interaction with an M1-type receptor.", 
    "124": "Hypoxia is the most common cause of neonatal seizures and encephalopathy. We have previously developed an in vivo experimental model of perinatal hypoxia which exhibits age-dependent acute and chronic epileptogenic effects. Between postnatal day (P) 10-12, the rat exhibits acute seizure activity during global hypoxia, while no seizures are induced at earlier (P5) or older (P60) ages. Rats exposed to hypoxia between P10-12 have reduced seizure thresholds to chemical convulsants in adulthood. The nonNMDA antagonists NBQX appears to suppress both the acute and long term epileptogenic effects of hypoxia. The age-dependency of the hyperexcitable response to hypoxia in vivo can be reproduced in vitro using hippocampal slices. In Mg(2+)-free media, hypoxia induced ictal discharges within 60 s of onset in 79% of slices from normal P10 rat pups compared to 11% of adult slices (p < 0.001). Model systems such as that described here allow for correlation of in vitro and in vivo electrophysiology and should provide data regarding the pharmacological and physiological characteristics of hypoxia-induced seizure activity in the immature brain which could ultimately be applied to therapeutic strategies.", 
    "125": "Alterations in the brain of rats receiving a single non-convulsive administration pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), 30 mig/kg, i.p. (single PTZ group) were investigated and compared with those detected in fully PTZ kindled rats (chronic PTZ group). In vitro receptor autoradiography experiments showed that both single and chronic PTZ groups presented mu opioid and benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor binding in specific brain areas. Using an antibody generated against the delta opioid receptor (DOR-1), it was found that DOR-1 like immunoreactivity was reduced in cortex and amygdala in mice following single and chronic PTZ administration. Microdialysis experiments revealed that the administration of PTZ 30 mg/kg, i.p. in freely moving rats without previous experience with the drug, induces a rise in glutamate release, detected in the first and second 10 min dialysates collected from amygdala (138% and 50%, respectively) and frontal cortex (70% and 45%, respectively) as well as aspartate in frontal cortex in the first and second PTZ-dialysates (143% and 80%, respectively). Subsequently, values returned to basal conditions. It may be speculated that decreased BDZ receptor binding results from enhanced release of GABA. On the other hand, the decrease of mu receptor binding and DOR-1 immunoreactivity observed after PTZ administration may be the result of enhanced levels of opioid peptides probably released over the kindling procedure. In conclusion, the present study indicates that PTZ-kindling is associated with an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory systems which is apparent early in the epileptogenic process.", 
    "126": "Benzodiazepines may induce hypotension by inhibiting the pressor response. Ephedrine has adrenergic effects on the circulation. After exercise, changes in cardiovascular control impair orthostatic tolerance. The impaired pressure response can be compensated for by chronotropic control of the heart. We studied the effect of midazolam and ephedrine on post-exercise cardiac autonomic chronotropic control in six 21-year-old female volunteers, who received single doses of 15 mg midazolam, 50 mg ephedrine, or placebo orally according to a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design. After exercise, the subjects assumed the supine position for rest, then a -10 degrees head-down position followed by a 70 degrees head-up position. Power spectral analysis of heart rate variability for 7 min and steady-state brachial arterial blood pressure were measured in each position. After administration of midazolam, three subjects had an abnormal fall in their arterial blood pressure (with one presyncope) as a response to head-up tilt. Changes in heart rate variability exceeded those seen during placebo treatment (p < 0.01) and involved oscillations, suggesting activation of both sympathetic and parasympathetic dynamics. After ephedrine administration, arterial blood pressure increased during head-down tilt, but parasympathetic dynamics to the heart were dampened. Head-up tilt induced increased sympathetic stimulation of the heart and a sympathicotonic cardiovascular response (p < 0.01). In conclusion, midazolam induced unexpectedly great changes in dynamic cardiac control during cardiovascular stimulation. Ephedrine increased tonic sympathetic activity and stabilized the neural circulatory control of the heart by immobilizing dynamic parasympathetic activation."
