Most patients were postmenopausal women, and the tongue was the most frequently afflicted site. Although 39% of the patients complained of dry mouth, no causative factors were evident. Therefore BMS is assumed to be a functional disorder. This was at least partially confirmed because the most effective management was in response to mood-altering drugs. From our data BMS appears to be a chronic condition with variations in symptoms among patients and without a predictable endpoint.", 
    "1": "64 general practitioners and 42 psychiatrists in central Norway answered a questionnaire which evaluated the doctors attitudes to benzodiazepines through their responses to 19 statements regarding these drugs. In addition, eight patient questionnaires were used to assess prescribing habits regarding benzodiazepines. There was considerable variation between the responses from the two groups of doctors. Psychiatrists exhibited significantly (p less than 0.001) more negative attitudes and stricter prescription habits as regards benzodiazepines than general practitioners did. Another finding was a significant and positive correlation between attitudes and prescribing habits.", 
    "2": "Prescribing of anti-anxiety benzodiazepines was registered in five one month periods in 1989 and 1990 in Moss, a medium-sized Norwegian town. The general practitioners received feed-back on their own prescribing habits and were offered an opportunity to meet colleagues in a self-evaluation group. The results indicate that GPs are influenced by such feed-back, since a reduction in the amount of defined daily doses prescribed was registered. The reduction was mainly a consequence of a change to prescribing a smaller number of pills on each occasion. The authors anticipated a potential reduction in prescribing to elderly persons, but in fact found a substantial reduction in the prescribing of anti-anxiety drugs to young men (with a potential problem of misuse).", 
    "3": "In a European multicenter study all the suicide attempts in the city and agglomeration of Berne which came under medical treatment during a 12-month period were surveyed. There were 243 females and 153 males, corresponding to a rate of 177.1 and 128.6 per 100,000 respectively. The investigated region can be regarded as representative of Switzerland. Comparison with other centers shows that the incidence of attempted suicide in Switzerland--unlike that of suicide--is approximately in line with the European average. The usual method is overdose of drugs, in particular benzodiazepines. Nearly all the drugs involved in the overdoses were obviously prescribed by physicians. The choice of drugs suggests that many suicidal people deliberately take anxiety-and tension-reducing agents, a fact which points to a relationship between anxiety states and attempted suicide. Both are to be regarded as the expression of acute emotional stress and require an appropriate therapeutic approach.", 
    "4": "We examined the kinetic interaction of purified recombinant DNA-derived human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase with R82150, a member of the tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jk]-[1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-thione family of compounds (Pauwels, R., Andries, K., Desmyter, J., Schols, D., Kukla, M.J., Breslin, H.J., Raeymaeckers, A., Van Gelder, J., Woestenborghs, R., Heykants, J., Schellekens, K., Janssen, M.A.C., De Clercq, E., and Janssen, P.A.J. (1990) Nature 343, 470-474). R82150 inhibited noncompetitively the utilization of homopolymeric and heteropolymeric template-primers (KI range 280-300 nM). Inhibition of dNTP substrate incorporation was also noncompetitive (KI range 100-890 nM). In contrast, 100 microM R82150 did not inhibit human DNA polymerases alpha, beta, or gamma. Gel electrophoresis was used to analyze the effect of inhibitors on extension of heteropolymeric template-primers by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. ddCTP induced accumulation of partially extended primers which had been terminated at sites requiring incorporation of deoxycytidylate. Competing template-primers reduced accumulation of both fully and partially extended primers. In contrast, R82150 induced accumulation of shortened primers that were terminated at various sites that did not correspond to any one particular deoxynucleotide species. Our results suggest that R82150 does not interact with HIV-1 reverse transcriptase as an analog of either template-primer or deoxynucleoside triphosphate substrate, but may bind allosterically at a site unique to this replicase.", 
    "5": "The results of placebo-controlled clinical trials of the treatment of non-ulcer dyspepsia with antacids, H2-receptor blockers, pirenzepine, sucralfate and colloidal bismuth subcitrate are reviewed. The methodological difficulties involved in connection with clinical trials of treatment of a vaguely defined condition such as non-ulcer dyspepsia are discussed with particular attention to the criteria for inclusion, assessment of effect and selection bias. None of the pharmacological agents have proved convincingly better than a placebo but sub-groups of the condition probably exist where symptomatic effects may be anticipated.", 
    "6": "The effects of 40 microM pentobarbital (PB), 1 microM diazepam (DZ) and 50 mM ethanol (EtOH) on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated chloride flux into rat cerebral cortical microsacs were studied during 50 ms incubations with 36Cl. A quench-flow machine was used, allowing for preincubations and incubation of precise duration. A 1 s preincubation with PB did not increase the already significant effect of PB on GABA-mediated flux during the 50 ms incubation, but the 1 s preincubation was necessary for showing the effect of diazepam. EtOH had no effect, whether or not it was added in the preincubation. When microsacs were preincubated with 32 microM GABA for 1 s, far greater potentiation of the GABA effect was seen when the PB was also present during the preincubation than when it was only introduced in the incubation. Preincubation with both DZ and GABA also had a greater effect than merely adding DZ into the incubation, after the preincubation with GABA. Ethanol had no effect when added either during or after the 1 s preincubation with GABA. The different effects of these sedatives on GABA-mediated chloride flux are strongly suggestive of different loci or mechanisms of action.", 
    "7": "Recent studies have identified two alternatively spliced forms of the GABA(A) receptor gamma(2) subunit that differ by the presence (gamma(2L)) or absence (gamma(2S)) of an eight-amino acid segment. This insert in the gamma(2L) isoform exists in the proposed cytoplasmic loop region, between M3 and M4, and contains a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by protein kinase C. To examine the regional distribution of this novel receptor subunit in the brain, gamma(2L) subunit mRNA was detected using both in situ hybridization histochemistry and and PCR amplification methods. Hybridization histochemistry with a gamma(2L), subunit-specific oligonucleotide probe revealed that the gamma(2L), subunit mRNA is widely distributed throughout the mouse brain. The highest levels of expression are found in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, olfactory lobe, and cerebellum. The presence of the gamma(2L), subunit in these regions was confirmed using PCR. Additionally, PCR experiments detected yes subunit mRNA in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus but not in the cerebellum. To examine the functional properties of the gamma(2) subunit isoforms, gamma(2S) and gamma(2L), subunit mRNAs were coexpressed with alpha(1)beta(1) subunit mRNAs in Xenopus oocytes. These experiments indicate that the gamma(2L) and gamma(2S) subunit variants exhibit similar pharmacological properties, including the ability of both isoforms to confer diazepam sensitivity to the receptor complex. In addition, potentiation of GABA responses by pentobarbital in oocytes expressing either subunit isoform is similar. These data indicate that the presence or absence of the additional eight amino acids in the gamma(2) subunit isoforms does not appear to alter the response of the GABA(A) receptor complex to either benzodiazepines and barbiturates at the level of protein phosphorylation present in the oocyte.", 
    "8": "The purpose of this investigation was to determine if the preoperative administration of an oral anxiolytic agent (triazolam) is beneficial in reducing the cardiovascular response to stress and anxiety. Twelve consecutive patients, six who received the drug and six who received a placebo, were monitored from the night before surgery at home until the morning with a Holter monitor. On presentation for surgery, levels of anxiety as well as heart rate and presence of cardiac arrhythmias were determined for the two groups. Patients who received the study medication had an anxiety level on the day of surgery similar to that recorded at an earlier consultation visit, whereas the placebo group showed a tendency toward an increase in anxiety on the day of surgery. There was a significant difference for resting heart rate between the two groups at various intervals associated with the preparation for the surgery. There were no complications related to the medication and, therefore, on the basis of this study, it appears that the administration of an oral anxiolytic agent prior to the patient presenting for surgery is beneficial in reducing the stress and anxiety associated with the operation as well as in reducing some of the cardiac manifestations of this stress.", 
    "9": "Concurrent drug misuse is an increasing trend among alcoholics. It is occurring in an age-dependent manner so that the younger the age, the higher the incidence of concurrent misuse. Drugs concurrently misused by alcoholics, in decreasing order of frequency, are marijuana, cocaine and other sympathomimetics, phencyclidine, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and psychedelics. Because of increasing prevalence of concurrent misuse, evaluation for alcohol detoxification should always include consideration of other drugs. Concurrent alcohol/drug addiction in alcoholics as well as increased incidence in alcoholism in families of drug addicts suggest a common genetic vulnerability to alcoholism and drug addiction.", 
    "10": "The cardiopulmonary effects of 15 mg ketamine/kg b. wt. and 15 mg ketamine/kg in combination with 1 mg climazolam/kg b. wt. or in combination with 18.5 mg Xylazine/kg b. wt. were tested after intramuscular injection in 17 pigs. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, arterial pH, pO2, pCO2, lactate in venous blood and body temperature were evaluated over a period of 2 hours. The activities of CK and ASAT in blood plasma were measured until 24 hours after the injections. There was little influence on heart rate and blood pressure after ketamine alone and also after one of the two combinations. Ketamine produced a tachypnea which was seen to a smaller extent also following injection of combinations of the drugs. This tachypnea produced a slight respiratory alkalosis. The metabolic acidosis, indicated by increasing lactate levels, occurring initially and during the recovery period was largely compensated by the respiratory alkalosis. The increased levels of CK and ASAT are explained by the destruction of muscle tissue at the locus of the injection.", 
    "11": "The disease of old age considerably differs from the disease in adults. This is based on a decreased function of the organ systems caused by old age and on the multimorbidity which can regularly be proved at older age. The therapeutic peculiarities consist in the fact that the measures of rehabilitation become more and more difficult with growing age and that the effect of medicaments has changed by alterations of the water and fat content as well as of the cardiovascular system and the respiration caused by old age. By the mental restriction a deterioration of the observance rate of prescriptions of medicaments develops. Above all at old age there is often a gross discrepancy between the objectively recognizable findings and the complaints. Adaptability to the external conditions of a disease lead to the notion of the \"conditioned health\" also at old age.", 
    "12": "The current study reports the effect of 0-8-hr naps placed prior to two consecutive nights of total sleep deprivation. A total of 104 young adult male subjects were randomly assigned to one of four prophylactic nap conditions (0, 2, 4 or 8 hr). After a normal baseline night of sleep and a morning of baseline test performance, subjects returned to bed at 1200, 1600 or 1800 hr or not at all prior to a continuous operation that extended until each subject's normal bedtime on the third following night. All subjects who napped arose at 2000 hr, and all subjects maintained the same schedule of computer-administered performance tests throughout the sleep-loss period. Results indicated that performance and alertness in all nap conditions were improved in a dose-response fashion compared to a no-nap control throughout the first 24 hr of sleep loss. However, significant improvement in nap conditions compared to the no-nap condition was not seen in many variables during the second night of sleep loss. Whereas an 8-hr nap prior to an operation maintained performance at a high level for 24-30 hr, significant improvement in alertness and performance as compared to the no-nap control was also documented by shorter naps. No nap could reverse the profound loss of alertness seen during the second night of sleep loss.", 
    "13": "Arecoline produces a biphasic response in rat left atria, i.e., a depression of basal inotropy at low doses and a positive inotropic effect at higher doses. These present studies were designed to determine whether it can be shown that the two separate responses to arecoline are mediated by two distinct cell surface muscarinic receptors. The antagonists scopolamine, 4-DAMP and AF-DX 116 produced apparent simple competitive antagonism of the negative responses to arecoline. Schild analysis was used to measure the equilibrium dissociation constant of the antagonist-receptor complex for antagonism of this response to arecoline by these antagonists. In atria from rats treated with pertussis toxin, the negative inotropy to arecoline was abolished and only the positive inotropic effects were observed. The antagonism of the positive inotropic response to arecoline by these antagonists was studied separately in atria from rats treated with pertussis toxin by the Schild technique. The pKB estimates made from the Schild regressions indicated no evidence to suggest that the two responses to arecoline (negative and positive inotropy) were mediated by two separate receptors in rat left atria. These data are discussed in terms of a single muscarinic receptor in this tissue mediating these two responses by interaction with two G-proteins in the same cell membrane. These data also are discussed in terms of the use of agonist potency ratios for the classification of receptors.", 
    "14": "The authors describe the evolution of the EEG during a 3-yr period in a case of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) revealed by epilepsy in a 9 yr-old boy. During the first 2 yr, the EEG was markedly abnormal (diffuse spike-waves, delta rhythms). During the static period, it looked like a continuous non-convulsive status epilepticus. The typical periodic abnormal activity only appeared at the terminal stage, and after a Valium test. Then slow wave complexes persisted on a dysrhythmic background. This type of EEG has never been described; our study stressed the efficacy of the Valium test in this particular case.", 
    "15": "An open-label, dose-escalation study was conducted to determine doses of lorazepam required to induce anterograde amnesia and sedation in children without producing excessive toxicity. Oncology patients 4 to 17 years of age undergoing lumbar puncture or bone marrow aspiration were eligible; a patient could be entered in the study for a second procedure at a different lorazepam dose. A single oral dose of lorazepam was administered 45-60 minutes before the procedure. Starting with 0.02 mg/kg, the same dose was given to three patients; if no dose-limiting effects occurred, dose was increased by 0.01 mg/kg. Before the procedure the patient was shown a toy that he or she was later asked to identify. Immediately after the procedure (usually 60-75 minutes after the lorazepam dose), sedation was assessed on a scale of 0 (alert) to 4 (coma), and the clinician performing the procedure was asked to subjectively evaluate sedation. Patients were rated for amnesia 24 hours after the procedure; a scale of 0 (recalls procedure and toy without prompting) to 4 (recalls nothing since procedure) was used. Twenty patients received 28 doses of lorazepam. The study was terminated when two patients who received 0.10 mg/kg had excessive ataxia. Sedation was subjectively considered adequate for 24 of the procedures. Sedation and amnesia scores were not well correlated with increased dose. Amnesia occurred in some patients with doses as low as 0.03 mg/kg. In children undergoing lumbar puncture or bone marrow aspiration, premedication with oral lorazepam 0.02-0.09 mg/kg generally produced adequate sedation for the procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Activation of cholinergic pathways with pyridostigmine did not increase GH responses to GHRH in these patients.

Our findings demonstrate a further mechanism by means of which thyroid status may affect the secretory activity of the somatotroph.", 
    "22": "The effects of diazepam on regional cerebral metabolism were examined in eight healthy volunteers using positron emission tomography with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose as the tracer. Each subject was tested three times, at 1-week intervals, with placebo, a low oral dose of diazepam (0.07 mg/kg), and a moderate dose of diazepam (0.14 mg/kg). Subjects completed mood questionnaires before and at regular intervals after taking the drug, and performed a vigilance task during the 60-minute period of tracer uptake. The effects of the drug on cerebral metabolism were examined alone and in relation to the subjective and behavioral effects of the drug. Both doses of diazepam decreased global (whole brain) metabolic rate but did not affect specific regions differentially. Subjects experienced sedative like effects during all three scans (placebo as well as drug). Compared to placebo, both doses of diazepam decreased anxiety, and neither dose produced significant impairment of task performance. Neither the subjective nor behavioral drug effects were correlated with the changes in metabolic rate. Thus, diazepam decreased whole brain metabolic rate at doses that produced only modest subjective or behavioral effects. The changes in metabolic rate were not clearly related to other observable drug effects.", 
    "23": "The relationship between family history of alcoholism and risk for benzodiazepine abuse was examined by assessing the reinforcing and subjective effects of diazepam (DZ; 4-28 mg) in 14 normal (i.e., nonalcoholic) males with a first-degree alcoholic relative (family history positive; FHP) and in 13 control subjects without alcoholic relatives (FHN). Reinforcing effects were measured using a double-blind preference procedure in which subjects first sampled DZ and placebo (PL) and then chose the substance they preferred. Subjects were also allowed to select the dose of drug they preferred on each choice session. The subjective effects of DZ were assessed using standardized self-report questionnaires. Neither group chose the DZ more often than PL. The FHP group chose DZ slightly (but not significantly) more often than the FHN group (mean choices FHP 1.42 vs. FHN 1.15 out of 3 choice options), and they chose slightly (but not significantly) more doses of DZ within sessions (FHP 25 mg vs. FHN 18 mg). The groups did not differ in their responses to DZ on other measures (e.g., subjective drug effects or drug liking). To the extent that laboratory procedures such as the one used here provide a model for assessing the abuse liability of drugs, these results do not provide strong evidence that males with a family history of alcoholism have an elevated risk for developing benzodiazepine abuse or dependence.", 
    "24": "A study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between nitroreduction of nitrazepam and its teratogenic effects and the involvement of the intestinal microflora in Sprague-Dawley rats. Incubation of bacterial suspensions from rat cecal contents with nitrazepam resulted in extensive reduction to 7-aminonitrazepam. Rat liver homogenates also reduced nitrazepam but only under anaerobic conditions. Following oral administration of 300 mg/kg nitrazepam to pregnant rats, total excretion of reduced metabolites (7-aminonitrazepam and 7-acetylaminonitrazepam) in urine and feces accounted for approximately 30% of the administered dose. When antibiotics were administered to dams to deplete their intestinal microflora prior to administration to nitrazepam, the total excretion of the reduced metabolites in the urine and feces decreased to 2% of the dose. Nitroreductase activity of cecal contents was almost completely suppressed by antibiotic pretreatment, but the activity of liver homogenates was not significantly altered by the same treatment. The incidence of nitrazepam-induced malformations was markedly decreased by antibiotic pretreatment. These results suggest that the intestinal microflora plays an important role in the reductive metabolism of nitrazepam and that the teratogenicity of nitrazepam may be related to its nitroreduction by the microflora.", 
    "25": "The hot-plate (HP) and tail-flick (TF) tests are widely used to assess analgesic activity of drugs. These tests do not directly measure the intensity of the noxious stimulus perceived by the animal, but only the animal's response to it, and so may be affected by non-analgesic drugs. Sedatives and muscle relaxants, for example, may impair the ability to respond and hence be wrongly considered to have analgesic activity. We examined response of rats in the HP (55 degrees C, cutoff time 25 sec) and TF (cutoff time 5 sec) tests following administration of pentobarbitone, diazepam or pancuronium. These drugs all impaired motor performance as assessed by reduction in mean rotarod performance times to 6-32% of predrug values. However, HP and TF latencies were not appreciably prolonged. We also found that pancuronium did not alter effects of morphine on HP or TF latencies, despite reduction in rotarod performance to 38% of predrug values. Our results support the validity of HP and TF tests as analgesic assays even in the presence of substantial impairment of motor performance.", 
    "26": "When disposition is monoexponential, extravascular concentration-time (C, t) data yield both disposition and absorption parameters, the latter via the Wagner-Nelson method or deconvolution which are equivalent. Classically, when disposition is multiexponential, disposition parameters are obtained from intravenous administration and absorption data are obtained from extravascular C, t data via the Loo-Riegelman or Exact Loo-Riegelman methods or via deconvolution. Thus, in multiexponential disposition one assumes no intrasubject variation in disposition, a hypothesis that has not been proven for most drugs. Based on the classical two- and three-compartment open models with central compartment elimination, and using postabsorptive extravascular C, t data only, we have developed four equations to estimate k10 when disposition is biexponential and two other equations to estimate k10 when disposition is triexponential. The other disposition rate constants are readily obtained without intravenous data. We have analyzed extravascular data of flurbiprofen (12 sets), mesoridazine (20 sets), flunarizine (5 sets), labetalol (9 sets), and diazepam (4 sets). In the case of diazepam intravenous C, t data were also available for analysis. After disposition parameters had been estimated from the extravascular data the Exact Loo-Riegelman method with the Proost modification was applied to the absorptive extravascular data to obtain AT/VP as a function of time. These latter data for each subject and each drug studied were found to be fitted by a function indicating either simple first-order absorption, two consecutive first-order processes, or zero-order absorption. After absorption and disposition parameters had been estimated, for each set of extravascular data analyzed, a reconstruction trend line through the original C, t data was made. The new methods allow testing of the hypothesis of constancy of disposition with any given drug. There is also a need for new methods of analysis since the majority of drugs have no marketed intravenous formulation, hence the classical methods cannot be applied.", 
    "27": "NONMEM, the only available supported program for population pharmacokinetic analysis, does not provide the analyst with individual subject parameter estimates. As a result, the relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters and demographic factors such as age, gender, and body weight cannot be sought by plotting demographic factors vs. kinetic parameters. To overcome this problem, we devised a three-step approach. In step 1, an initial NONMEM analysis provides the population pharmacokinetic parameters without taking into account the demographic factors. Step 2 consists of individual bayesian regressions using the measured drug concentrations for each subject and the population pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in step 1. The bayesian parameter estimates of the individual subject can be plotted against the demographic factors of interest. From the scatter plots, it can be seen which are the demographic factors that appear to affect the pharmacokinetic parameters. In step 3, the NONMEM analysis is resumed, and the demographic factors found in step 2 are entered into the NONMEM regression model in a stepwise manner. This method was used to analyze the pharmacokinetics of midazolam in 64 subjects from 714 plasma concentrations and 11 demographic factors. CL (elimination clearance) and V1 were found to be a function of body weight. Age and liver disease were found to decrease CL. Of the 11 demographic factors recorded for each patient, none was found to influence VSS or intercompartmental clearance.", 
    "28": "Estazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine with an intermediate elimination half-life, has been shown previously to be an effective and safe hypnotic in insomniacs without concomitant psychiatric illness. Our study of the efficacy of estazolam in patients with insomnia associated with generalized anxiety disorder began when 108 patients meeting criteria for generalized anxiety disorder (mean total score of Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety [HAM-A] = 22.0 +/- 3.1 [SD]) and insomnia were given single-blind placebo for 7 nights. Nine patients whose anxiety and/or insomnia improved were dropped as placebo responders. The remaining 99 patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to double-blind treatment with either estazolam 2.0 mg or matching placebo for 7 nights. Hypnotic efficacy, as determined by patient-completed sleep questionnaires, was statistically significant for estazolam 2.0 mg versus placebo for all sleep indices (p less than 0.01). Patients treated with estazolam 2.0 mg showed significantly greater improvement in anxiety than those receiving placebo on the mean total score of HAM-A ([placebo, -3.4; estazolam, -7.1; p less than 0.001] and without the insomnia item [placebo, -2.7; estazolam, -5.5; p less than 0.001]). Anxiety scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory showed greater improvement in the estazolam group, but without statistical significance (p = 0.237). Estazolam 2.0 mg is an effective hypnotic in patients with generalized anxiety disorder and appears to have a favorable anxiolytic action.", 
    "29": "Three mothers of infants with holoprosencephaly consumed alcohol heavily in pregnancy. We postulate that early alcohol exposure is a possible cause of their malformation. The 3 mothers consumed alcohol only in the first trimester but the first mother continued to take chlordiazepoxide and imipramine throughout the pregnancy. Her infant had an alobar holoprosencephaly associated with a median cleft lip, ocular hypotelorism, and a flat nose. The other infants had semilobar holoprosencephaly and hydrocephalus. These latter 2 infants did not show the characteristic facies of the fetal alcohol syndrome. G-band chromosome studies were normal in all 3 infants. The association of holoprosencephaly with alcohol exposure during pregnancy in humans has been mentioned only briefly, although this malformation has been induced by alcohol in animals. These 3 infants may support the hypothesis that acute or subacute heavy alcohol exposure early in pregnancy could lead to holoprosencephaly without the necessity of a chronic alcohol exposure and without necessarily causing the typical facial findings of the fetal alcohol syndrome.", 
    "30": "We report on 2 unrelated Japanese families, each with several individuals affected with hyperekplexia, a rare autosomal dominant form of exaggerated startle response of neonatal onset. In the first family, affected relatives included a 4-week-old boy, his mother, grandmother, a maternal uncle, and 2 maternal cousins. In the second family, affected were a 4-week-old boy, his father, and an elder brother. These 9 individuals had various combinations of transient infantile hypertonia and hypokinesia, exaggerated startle response with falling episodes, nocturnal myoclonus and an easily elicited head retraction reflex, hip dislocation, and umbilical hernia. Treatment with clonazepam was effective in relieving these manifestations in the affected infants and children. Genetic analysis of these 2 families and 4 others in the literature suggests autosomal dominant inheritance with considerable variability but complete penetrance. Another 3 families in the literature were reported, suggesting the existence of startle disorder with an autosomal recessive inheritance. A sporadic case is also known, presumably representing a fresh mutation of a dominantly inherited trait.", 
    "31": "A survey has been carried out amongst the UK based members of the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland regarding their practice of premedication. Ninety-three per cent of respondents (reply rate 51.7%) used sedative-hypnotic premedication routinely in adults and 84% in children. However, anticholinergic premedication was used by only 36% in adults and 56% in children. Temazepam was the most frequently used sedative premedicant in adults and trimeprazine in children. Atropine and hyoscine were the most frequently used anticholinergic drugs. The main reasons for using sedative-hypnotic premedication were allaying anxiety and providing sedation. The main reasons for using anticholinergic drugs were drying of secretions and protection against vagal overactivity. This survey concludes that while sedative-hypnotic premedication continues to be used in the majority of patients with oral benzodiazepines the most frequently used drugs, the use of anti-cholinergic premedication continues to decline.", 
    "32": "Interactions with oral contraceptives (OCs) occur with drugs commonly used to treat epilepsy, tuberculosis, and depression. Most women are more likely to use antibiotics, analgesics, and antihistamines, which have also been shown to interact with OCs. The mechanisms behind these interactions may be hepatic microsomal enzyme induction or inhibition, interference with the enterohepatic circulation of steroid metabolites, interference with absorption, competition between two drugs for the same metabolizing enzyme, or induction of an opposite physiologic effect. Rifampin was the first drug reported to interfere with the efficacy of OCs. The anticonvulsants and certain antibiotics, namely ampicillin and tetracycline, also decrease the efficacy of OCs. Oral contraceptives also interfere with the metabolism of other drugs. Plasma concentrations of theophylline, diazepam, and certain other benzodiazepines are increased by OC steroids. Because OCs interact with a wide variety of prescription and over-the-counter medications, a thorough drug history should be taken in all patients taking OCs.", 
    "33": "Estazolam is a new benzodiazepine hypnotic agent with an intermediate half-life of 12 to 15 hours. The authors designed an investigation to compare its hypnotic efficacy to that of flurazepam, generally considered the reference standard. The hypnotic efficacy of estazolam at two doses (1 mg and 2 mg) was compared with that of flurazepam (30 mg) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, 7-night study that involved 223 outpatients with insomnia. On subjective assessments of the patients, no differences were noted between estazolam 2 mg and flurazepam 30 mg on any of six sleep parameters. Patients who were receiving estazolam 1 mg rated their sleep significantly better than did patients who were receiving placebo on all parameters except sleep latency. Global evaluation of the physicians indicated significant improvement in quality of sleep, sleep depth, sleep duration, and nocturnal awakenings in all three active treatment groups; estazolam 2 mg and flurazepam also decreased sleep latency significantly. The percentage of patients who reported any adverse experience was 68% for flurazepam, 58% for estazolam 2 mg, and 54% for estazolam 1 mg; the incidence of adverse events in the placebo group was 43%. In conclusion, estazolam 2 mg was found to be as effective a hypnotic as flurazepam 30 mg. Estazolam 1 mg is also effective in the treatment of outpatients with insomnia, but to a lesser degree.", 
    "34": "The effects of single oral doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg temazepam were evaluated with the adaptive tracking test, analysis of smooth-pursuit and saccadic eye movements, and visual analog lines in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover experiment with 12 healthy volunteers. Pharmacodynamic testing was performed until 10 hours and pharmacokinetics were evaluated until 24 hours. Temazepam, 20 mg, caused effects in all tests, with peak effects occurring at 30 minutes. The 10 mg dose caused effects on saccadic eye movements and subjective scores of alertness, whereas 5 mg temazepam was detected only by analysis of saccadic eye movements. Linear relationships between plasma concentrations and effects were found in nine subjects for saccadic peak velocity and eight subjects for subjective scores of alertness. The results of this study demonstrate manifest differences in the sensitivities of performance tests and stress the importance of validation of methods when effects of drugs on human performance are studied.",

Antipyrine clearance normalized to body weight was significantly greater in children than in adults (0.91 versus 0.59 ml/min/kg; p = 0.012), but was not different when normalized to body surface area. In contrast, lorazepam total clearance (CL) and unbound clearance (CLu) normalized to body weight were not significantly different between children and adults but were smaller in children when normalized to body surface area (CL = 31.9 versus 40.6 ml/min/m2, p = 0.036; CLu = 352 versus 485 ml/min/m2, p = 0.010). The mean lorazepam fraction unbound in children was 0.087, which was not different from adult volunteers (0.084). This study has identified significant differences between children and adults in the disposition of these two compounds, with higher milliliter per minute per kilogram clearance for antipyrine but not lorazepam.", 
    "36": "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the muscarinic modulation of neostriatal acetylcholine release changes with senescence. Neostriatal slices from Fischer 344 rats aged 3, 10 and 28 months were prepared and incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer oxygenated with 95% O2/5% CO2. Acetylcholine release from slices of each age group was monitored in the presence or absence of muscarinic agents, and the release in the presence of the drug was compared to the release from slices of age-matched controls in the absence of drug. The muscarinic agonist, oxotremorine, and two muscarinic antagonists, atropine and pirenzepine, were tested for their effects on acetylcholine release. Pirenzepine is selective in its interaction with the M1 muscarinic receptor subtype; atropine and oxotremorine are nonselective in their actions. Of the three drugs tested, pirenzepine displayed a significant age-related difference in its effects on acetylcholine release. Whereas the effects of pirenzepine (50 microM) on acetylcholine release modulation in slices from the 3-month rats were negligible, the M1-selective antagonist increased the release of acetylcholine from slices of 10- and 28-month rats by another 42 and 192% (P less than .05), respectively. Atropine (1 microM) was also tested, and an increase in acetylcholine release by another 64, 104 and 218% (all P less than .05) was observed in slices from the 3-, 10- and 28-month rats, respectively. In the presence of oxotremorine (50 microM), acetylcholine release decreased in slices from the 3-month rats by 35% (P less than .1), but changed by only 7 and 15% in the 10- and 28-month slices, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "37": "Controversy exists over whether diazepam can be used for sedation during esophageal manometry studies without affecting the results. To evaluate the effect of diazepam, 20 healthy asymptomatic volunteers were studied using a standard manometry protocol employing an Arndorfer capillary infusion system. Following a baseline manometry, each subject received 0.1 mg/kg diazepam intravenously over 1 min and underwent repeat manometry 5 min after completion of the injection. All manometry recordings were coded and read blindly. The amplitude of the lower esophageal sphincter was significantly reduced by diazepam from 26.2 +/- 10.9 and 30.0 +/- 10.9 mm Hg to 18.8 +/- 7.6 and 24.5 +/- 9.7 mm Hg by rapid and station pull-through methods, respectively (P less than 0.01 both methods). Esophageal contraction wave duration was significantly increased following diazepam at 3, 8, and 13 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter (P less than 0.01 all levels). There was a trend toward increased contraction wave amplitude following diazepam administration in the lower three fourths of the esophagus. On the basis of these results, we conclude that diazepam sedation may produce misleading results when used during esophageal manometric testing. It is recommended that diazepam not be used in manometric studies of normal subjects or patients with reflux esophagitis and that manometric findings in patients with hypertensive or spastic disorders be interpreted with caution if diazepam is given as a premedication.", 
    "38": "Autopsy tissue specimens of 69 cases of hypersensitivity myocarditis were studied to determine drug association, spectrum of histologic findings, distribution of infiltrates, and correlation between degree of infiltrates and cardiac symptoms. Hypersensitivity myocarditis was defined by the presence of eosinophils, a mixed lymphohistiocytic infiltrate along natural planes of separation, and an absence of fibrosis or granulation tissue in areas of infiltrate. Commonly implicated drugs were methyldopa, hydrochlorothiazide, ampicillin, furosemide, digoxin, tetracycline, aminophylline, phenytoin, benzodiazepines, and tricyclic antidepressants. Histiocytes composed the predominant cell type (in addition to eosinophils and lymphocytes). Lymphocytes were predominantly T cells in 12 cases studied immunohistochemically. Small foci of myocyte necrosis were present in 37 cases, and they correlated with the degree of infiltrate. A nonnecrotizing vasculitis was present in 28 cases. The right ventricle was involved in all but three cases. Cardiac arrhythmias or unexplained death occurred in 29 patients and did not correlate with the degree of myocardial infiltrate or presence of necrosis. Eosinophils were present in the livers of 30 of 58 patients, and their presence correlated with the degree of cardiac infiltration. A causative association between histologic findings and drugs is difficult to prove because of the common usage of many of the drugs implicated, multiple drug use, and the absence of clinical criteria of hypersensitivity. Symptoms do not appear related to the degree of infiltrate. In more than half the cases, infiltrates may be missed by endomyocardial biopsy due to focality of lesions.", 
    "39": "Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, reliably reverses midazolam-induced sedation; however, its effect on respiratory depression has not been established completely. Twelve healthy volunteers received sufficient midazolam (0.13 +/- 0.01 mg.kg-1 mean +/- SE) to render them unresponsive to verbal command; they then received flumazenil 1.0 mg or placebo (flumazenil vehicle) in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Ventilatory drive was measured before and after administration of midazolam, as well as 3, 30, 60, and 120 min after administration of flumazenil or placebo. Seven to 30 days later, the study was repeated, with subjects receiving placebo or flumazenil (whichever they had not received during their first trial). Midazolam caused significant decreases in the slope of the CO2 response (-29 +/- 5%; P less than 0.005); minute ventilation (VE) at end-tidal CO2 tension (PETCO2) = 46 mmHg (-28 +/- 4%; P less than 0.001), and tidal volume at PETCO2 = 46 mmHg (-44 +/- 4%; P less than 0.005). Three minutes after intravenous administration of flumazenil 1.0 mg, VE46 and tidal volume increased to 108 +/- 6% and 105 +/- 6%, respectively, of their premidazolam values; at the same time after administration of placebo, VE46 and tidal volume remained significantly depressed (between groups, P less than 0.005 for each variable). Thirty minutes later, these variables did not differ between groups, probably because the effects of flumazenil and midazolam were diminishing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "Effects of the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist phencyclidine (PCP) and competitive antagonists 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) and 2-amino-4,5-(1,2-cyclohexyl)-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (NPC 12626) were studied in 6 squirrel monkeys trained under a multiple schedule of unpunished and punished lever pressing. PCP (0.03-0.3 mg/kg, IM) failed to produce increases in punished responding, even at doses that produced extreme response-rate decreases in nonpunishment components. Similarly, CPP (1-17 mg/kg) and NPC 12626 (3-30 mg/kg) did not produce increases in punished responding at any dose tested. Repeated administration of NPC 12626 (17 mg/kg) for 4 consecutive days did not result in increased rates of punished responding. The benzodiazepine anxiolytic midazolam (0.3 mg/kg) and, to a lesser extent, the barbiturate pentobarbital (5.6 mg/kg), produced increases in punished responding in the same subjects at doses that did not markedly affect unpunished responding. Coadministration of PCP (0.03 mg/kg) with doses of midazolam ranging from 0.03-3 mg/kg did not produce changes in the midazolam dose-response curve for either unpunished or punished responding. These results fail to support findings in rats that NMDA antagonists produce antipunishment effects similar to those of benzodiazepine anxiolytics.", 
    "41": "Previous experiments have shown that anxiolytic drugs reduce the frequency of hippocampal rhythmic slow activity, induced by high frequency stimulation of the reticular formation and flatten the function relating threshold septal stimulation to the frequency of driven rhythmic slow activity. All of the drugs involved are known to augment GABAergic transmission. The present experiments investigated the effects of the novel anxiolytic compound buspirone which, unlike conventional anxiolytics, does not interact with GABA, yet is a clinically effective anxiolytic. Buspirone (0.156-40 mg/kg, i.p.) was found to reduce the frequency of reticular-elicited rhythmic slow activity, in a similar manner to chlordiazepoxide (0.019-20 mg/kg, i.p.). Buspirone did not change the linearity of the voltage-frequency function. Buspirone (10 mg/kg, i.p.) also altered the threshold for septal driving of rhythmic slow activity, in a similar manner to classical anxiolytics. The combination of chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg, i.p.) with corticosterone (0.2 mg, s.c.) removed the minor differences between buspirone and chlordiazepoxide in both the septal and reticular tests. These results show that buspirone altered the control of rhythmic slow activity in the hippocampus, in a manner which appeared functionally equivalent to other anxiolytics but which depends on mechanisms which are likely to be neurally and pharmacologically distinct from those of other anxiolytic drugs.", 
    "42": "Seventy-five women undergoing elective day case gynaecological surgery were randomised into one of three groups to receive an oral formulation of midazolam IV solution 10 mg, temazepam 20 mg or placebo for premedication. The two treatment groups showed a significant reduction in anxiety score compared with placebo (P less than 0.002 and P less than 0.04 for placebo compared with temazepam and midazolam respectively). Similarly the treatment groups showed a significantly greater sedation score compared with placebo. Recovery as assessed by letter deletion and memory tests was no worse for the treatment groups than for placebo. Patient acceptance of the two treatment groups was significantly greater than that of placebo. There was no significant difference between treatment groups with respect to anxiolysis, sedation or recovery. As a day case premedicant, midazolam IV solution 10 mg orally was found to be as effective as temazepam 20 mg and superior to placebo, in terms of anxiolysis and sedation, but did not offer any clinical advantage over temazepam in this setting.", 
    "43": "Two experiments were conducted to examine the effects of the anxiolytic drug, diazepam, on long-term habituation of the acoustic startle response. The experiments were based upon the hypothesis that manipulations that reduce fear should enhance long-term response decrements by reducing a fear-like sensitization process. In Experiment 1 rats given intraperitoneal injections of 0.5, 1.2, or 2.5 mg/kg showed larger decrements of startle amplitude than vehicle-injected controls both over trials within sessions and over days. In Experiment 2 rats injected with 35 micrograms of diazepam bilaterally into the amygdala showed larger decrements of startle amplitudes over days than vehicle-injected controls. No within-session startle effects were detected in Experiment 2. Freezing behavior was measured in Experiment 2 as an index of fear, and the amygdala injections of diazepam retarded the development of fear in the startle chamber. This index of fear was not possible in Experiment 1 because of the sedating effects of systemic diazepam. We conclude that diazepam, acting at least in part through the amygdala, attenuates the fear-like sensitization process associated with the acoustic startle stimulus. By attenuating sensitization diazepam produces larger than normal reductions in startle amplitudes over trials and days without significantly affecting initial responsiveness.", 
    "44": "Discriminative stimulus effects have been studied extensively with the two-response, food-reinforced operant procedure and more recently also with discriminated taste aversion (DTA) procedures. DTA procedures have the advantage of a more rapid discrimination training. However, the test phase, i.e., drug substitution, of the DTA procedure is more time consuming (1 test per 4 days) than the test phase of the two-response procedure (2 tests per 5 days). The present study investigated whether a DTA procedure with 2 tests per 5 days could be implemented. In addition, the specificity of the DTA procedure was investigated. Rats were trained to discriminate chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 20 mg/kg, IP) from vehicle using a discriminated taste aversion procedure. Selective suppression of saccharin consumption after CDP injections was maximal after seven CDP-LiCl pairings. In subsequent substitution tests, with 2 tests per 5 days, CDP-mimicking effects were found only for another benzodiazepine, diazepam, and for a barbiturate, pentobarbital. The results indicate that rats can be rapidly trained to discriminate CDP from vehicle in the discriminated taste aversion procedure and that the CDP-cue so produced has the same specificity as in a two-response, food-reinforced operant procedure. However, the DTA procedure has a number of drawbacks that make its advantage over the two-response procedure questionable.", 
    "45": "This study compared the effects of sera from patients given various anesthetics on in vitro mouse preimplantation embryo development. Patients electing bilateral laparoscopic tubal sterilization were subjected to general anesthesia with nitrous oxide (N2O) that included either isofluorane (ISO/N2O) as an inhalant or fentanyl or morphine (FEN/MOR/N2O). The addition of sera collected 1 hr after anesthetic induction significantly reduced the numbers of two-cell mouse embryos that developed to blastocyst in the ISO/N2O group as compared to that of preanesthesia sera. In contrast, no detrimental effects were revealed from sera of patients given FEN/MOR/N2O. Comparison of sera from patients given ISO/N2O and FEN/MOR/N2O for laparoscopic oocyte retrieval and from patients given spinal anesthesia and/or i.v. sedation for ultrasonic retrieval also revealed a decrease in mouse embryo development in the ISO/N2O group, but no differences were seen in the other anesthetic regimens. ISO/N2O anesthesia was also associated with a significantly decreased fertilization rate of mature oocytes retrieved. However, no significant effect of ISO/N2O anesthesia on IVF pregnancy rates could be demonstrated. These studies indicate that embryo toxic effects can be detected in sera from patients given ISO/N2O and that this anesthetic may be detrimental to the success of in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer.", 
    "46": "A new task for the analysis of drug effects on the cognitive function in mice was investigated using a 4-arm maze with three selectable arms. Each trial consisted of a forced run either to the right or left arm containing a food pellet, which was changed for each trial, followed by a free-choice run after a delay (0-120 sec). The correct response was to turn to the arm 180 degrees opposite from the forced one. Entrance into the center arm in the free-choice run, which was called the non-reward response, was not reinforced at any time. As the delay became longer, correct responses decreased, but non-reward response errors remained unchanged in the well-trained mice. Without increasing the non-reward response, scopolamine and atropine, but not methylscopolamine, decreased the correct response in a delay-dependent manner at a low dose range, while diazepam did so in a delay-independent manner. Physostigmine ameliorated scopolamine-induced impairment in performance, but had less effect on the delay-induced decrease in the correct response. Other tested drugs (chlorpromazine, haloperidol, apomorphine, phentolamine, propranolol, lithium chloride, ketamine, and caffeine) had no significant effect on performance. These results suggest that CNS muscarinic blockades and diazepam treatment selectively attenuate working memory in different ways.", 
    "47": "The interaction between opioid analgesics (morphine and buprenorphine) and central depressants (ethanol, pentobarbital and diazepam) was investigated by means of ambulatory activity in mice. The ambulation-increasing effect of both morphine (10 mg/kg, s.c.) and buprenorphine (1 mg/kg, s.c.) was enhanced by the combined administration of ethanol (0.8-3.2 g/kg, p.o.) in a dose-dependent manner. Naloxone (0.1 mg/kg, s.c.) was effective for reducing the enhanced ambulatory activity. The pretreatment with Ca-cyanamide (5 mg/kg, p.o., 30 min before) reduced the enhancement of the ambulation-increasing effect induced by the combined administration of opioid analgesics with ethanol, although it scarcely modified that of morphine and buprenorphine alone. On the other hand, neither pentobarbital (1-30 mg/kg, s.c.) nor diazepam (0.25-2 mg/kg, s.c.) modified markedly the ambulation-increasing effect of morphine and buprenorphine. The present results suggest that ethanol specifically interacted with opioid analgesics when the mouse's ambulatory activity was used as the indicator.", 
    "48": "Blood coagulation and fibrinolytic activity was studied in SART (specific alternation of rhythm in temperature)-stressed animals found to exhibit thrombocytopenia and prolonged bleeding time, and drug effects on the abnormalities were evaluated. 1) SART-stressed rats revealed prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin and thrombin time, no change in prothrombin time, decreased plasma fibrinogen levels, and shortened euglobulin clot lysis time (ELT). Antithrombin III and alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor activity remained constant following stress exposure. 2) During stress, fibrinogen levels declined from day 5 and remained depressed up to day 14. Reduction in ELT developed in a similar manner to fibrinogen. 3) Decreased fibrinogen levels were prevented by consecutive doses of tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic, and Neurotropin, a sedative analgesic. Shortened ELT was counteracted by chronic treatment with Neurotropin and alprazolam, an anxiolytic. Single administrations of the above agents failed to affect either change. These results indicate that SART-stressed animals exhibit suppressed intrinsic coagulability and enhanced fibrinolytic activity, but normal extrinsic coagulability. Considering the previous report together with the above results, the hemostatic system under SART stress tends uniformly toward hemorrhage. Moreover, Neurotropin appears to improve and normalize hemostatic imbalance due to SART stress, a chronic form of stress.", 
    "49": "Administration of Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine antagonist (3.6 mg/kg/day in drinking water for 14 days), increased total sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in rats. Standard six-hour EEG recording periods were obtained on day 0, 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, as well as 24 and 72 hours following withdrawal. Enhanced REM sleep reached significance on day 7 of continuous drug treatment and remained significantly increased on day 10 and 14, as well as at 24 and 72 hours following drug withdrawal. The present data show that chronic administration of Ro 15-1788 increases total sleep time due to increases in REM sleep. The actions of Ro 15-1788 presumably occur through either adenosinergic or cholinergic mechanisms.", 
    "50": "1. Interaction of quinolone antibiotics and the anti-inflammatory agent fenbufen with the gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptor-chloride channel complex in pyramidal neurons freshly dissociated from the hippocampal CA1 region of the rats was investigated in whole-cell mode, using the patch-clamp technique under voltage-clamp conditions. 2. Quinolones in clinical doses had no effects on the GABA-gated Cl- current (ICl) but slightly suppressed the response at concentrations greater than 10(-5) M. A metabolite of fenbufen, 4-biphenylacetic acid (BPA), also had little effect on the GABA response at therapeutic concentrations. 3. Coadministration of one of quinolones and BPA suppressed the GABA-gated ICl with increase in each of them in a concentration-dependent manner, and there was a parallel shift of the concentration-response curve for GABA to the right but with no effect on the maximum response, thereby indicating a competitive antagonism. The inhibitory potency of antibiotics in combination with BPA was in the order of norfloxacin much greater than enoxacin greater than cyprofloxacin greater than pipemidic acid much greater than ofloxacin greater than cinoxacin = piromidic acid = nalidixic acid = 0. 4. Norfloxacin and BPA, administered simultaneously, also strongly suppressed pentobarbital sodium (PB)-gated ICl, but they did not act on benzodiazepine (BZP) receptors. 5. Both GABA- and PB-induced ICls reversed at the Cl- equilibrium potential (ECl). In the presence of BPA, the quinolone-induced inhibition of GABA-gated ICls showed no voltage dependence. 6. It was concluded that, in the presence of an anti-inflammatory agent, the quinolone antibiotics decrease the affinity of GABAA receptors, the result being induction of epileptogenic neurotoxicities.", 
    "51": "Considerable evidence indicates that dopamine may, under certain circumstances, play a role in the mediation of central nervous system tissue damage. Furthermore, recent studies suggest a synergistic role between the neurotoxic effects of excitatory amino acids and dopamine. To address this issue, rats received a unilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine or vehicle into the medial forebrain bundle. After recovery (18 days), both groups of animals received an ibotenic acid injection of the ipsilateral striatum. Seven days later the brains were removed and the size of the striatal lesion was assessed histologically and by means of receptor autoradiography. Regional analysis of profound D1 receptor loss was determined using [3H]SCH 23390, and extent of astrocytic proliferation was examined using autoradiography with the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand [3H]R05-4864. Prior interruption of the nigrostriatal pathway (resulting in dopaminergic denervation of the ipsilateral striatum) partially protected this latter structure from subsequent injection of ibotenic acid (the extent of the lesion was reduced by 28%, P less than .05). The findings indicate that endogenous dopamine release may modulate (and intensify) the excitotoxic effects of ibotenic acid.", 
    "52": "One hundred male patients (average age 68.2 yrs) with acute retention (n = 20) or with symptoms of outflow obstruction (n = 80) underwent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) under sedation (midazolam) and local anesthesia (lidocaine)--referred to as sedoanalgesia technique. Procedures lasted twenty-four minutes on average (range 15-35 min), and the weight of prostatic tissue resected ranged from 2-35 g (average 11.1 g). There were no complications related to the use of midazolam or lidocaine. The technique of sedoanalgesia proved safe and acceptable to all patients regardless of their pre-existing medical condition. Where the weight of prostate to be resected is estimated to be less than 40 g, TURP under sedoanalgesia proves an effective alternative to general or regional anesthesia.", 
    "53": "In Papio papio baboons benzodiazepines can facilitate the appearance of a naturally occurring non-epileptic myoclonus, suggesting a possible role of GABAergic transmission in their physiopathology. Nevertheless, as this myoclonus is blocked by physostigmine, the effect of benzodiazepines is probably due to their indirect action on the cholinergic system. Therefore, in this study, we report the effects on the non-epileptic myoclonus of drugs influencing GABAergic transmission. Systemic injections of progabide (GABA precursor), baclofen (GABAB receptor agonist) and allylglycine (glutamic acid decarboxylase inhibitor) did not modify or induce the non-epileptic myoclonus. In the same way, localized chronic injections of GABA into various cerebral structures (prefrontal and motor cortical areas, reticular magnocellular nucleus and substantia nigra) had no effect. When the two types of myoclonus were present in the same photosensitive animal, the epileptic myoclonus induced by photic stimulation was blocked by benzodiazepines but was not influenced by physostigmine, thus differing from the non-epileptic myoclonus. This suggests that different neurochemical mechanisms are involved in the two types of myoclonus, the non-epileptic myoclonus not being directly influenced by the GABAergic transmission.", 
    "54": "The metabolic pathways of medazepam, oxazepam, and diazepam were modeled using graph-theoretic transforms which are incorporable into computer-assisted metabolic analysis programs. The information, represented in the form of a graph-theoretic transform kit, which was obtained from these pathways was then used to predict the metabolites of other benzodiazepine compounds. The transform kits gave statistically significant predictions with respect to a statistical method for evaluating the performance of the transform kits.", 
    "55": "Medetomidine, a new selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, potentiated bicuculline seizures in mice. In vivo pretreatment with medetomidine in mouse cerebral cortex reduced dose-dependently (2.5-100 micrograms/kg) GABA-potentiated 3H-flunitrazepam binding. The affinity of 3H-muscimol was also reduced by medetomidine. This effect of medetomidine on GABA-potentiated benzodiazepine binding was reversed by pretreatment with atipamezole (1 mg/kg), a specific alpha 2-antagonist. In an elevated plus-maze model of anxiety medetomidine (0.5-10 micrograms/kg) was inactive both in rats and mice and did not antagonize the behavioural effects of an anxiogenic beta-carboline, DMCM. However, at lower doses medetomidine (10 but not 50 micrograms/kg) antagonized the swimming stress caused increase of central benzodiazepine binding sites (labeled with 3H-Ro 15-1788) in mouse cerebral cortex. The increase of peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites on brain and heart cryostat cut slices caused by stress was also antagonized by pretreatment with medetomidine. The behavioural and biochemical data obtained in this study are evidence that medetomidine does not have anxiolytic effect but may have, in lower doses, stress-protective activity.", 
    "56": "Select benzodiazepine (BDZ) agonists, such as clonazepam, evoke wet-dog shakes (WDS) in the rat, a behavior which may be influenced by serotonergic drugs. To further study the role of serotonin (5-HT) and BDZ receptors in BDZ-induced WDS, we injected adult rats daily for 21 days with clonazepam and measured WDS and 5-HT1, 5-HT2, and BDZ receptors. Clonazepam 5 mg/kg upregulated 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors in frontal cortex, but not in brainstem or spinal cord, compared to vehicle controls, without a change in BDZ receptors. A 10 mg/kg dose of the same drugs, however, did not alter 5-HT receptors. Chronic treatment with clonazepam failed to decrease clonazepam-induced WDS, resulting instead in a significant increase. The increase was prevented by chronic cotreatment with the 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin, which significantly down-regulated 5-HT2 and BDZ sites. In vitro, clonazepam did not inhibit radioligand binding at 5-HT1 or 5-HT2 receptors in frontal cortex, brainstem, or spinal cord. Lack of tolerance to WDS evoked by clonazepam suggests different mechanisms for the excitatory and inhibitory effects of BDZs. The dose-independent effects of chronic clonazepam administration on 5-HT receptors are not mediated by activity of clonazepam at 5-HT receptor recognition sites.", 
    "57": "The putative anxiolytic activity of the white and red varieties of ginseng, the root of Panax ginseng, was investigated in rats and mice using a number of experimental paradigms of anxiety and compared with that of diazepam. Pilot studies indicated that single-dose administration of ginseng had little to no acute behavioural effects, hence the two varieties of ginseng were administered orally at two dose levels twice daily for 5 days, while diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered acutely. White and red varieties of ginseng (20 and 50 mg/kg) showed positive results when tested against several paradigms of experimental anxiety. Both were effective in the open-field and elevated plus-maze tests and reduced conflict behaviour in thirsty rats and footshock-induced fighting in paired mice. Ginseng also attenuated pentylenetetrazole-induced decrease in rat brain MAO activity, confirming its anxiolytic activity since this has been proposed to be an endogenous marker for anxiety. The effects induced by white and red ginseng (50 mg/kg x 5 days) were comparable to those induced by diazepam (1 mg/kg).", 
    "58": "We have developed a model of benzodiazepine-type physical dependence in which mice were injected subcutaneously with the test compound on a fixed schedule (0800 and 1600 for 3 days, the PM dose = AM dose x 2). If tolerated, then a starting dose of 150 mg/kg/day was generally used initially and the dose was lowered to 15 and 1.5 mg/kg/day in subsequent assays if the higher doses were active in the test. Twenty-four hours after the last dose, the mice received an intravenous injection of flumazenil (2.5 mg/kg), and 5 min later they were tested for electroshock seizure thresholds by an up-down titration method. Flumazenil-precipitated withdrawal was manifested by a lowering of the mA seizure threshold. We have found that compounds with benzodiazepine agonist properties significantly lower these thresholds in a dose-related fashion. For example, the following compounds (lowest effective mg/kg/day dose) were active in this regard, chlordiazepoxide (150), diazepam (15), flurazepam (15), alprazolam (15), triazolam (15), midazolam (15), zopiclone (150), Ro 16-6028 (150), and Ro 17-1812 (150). In contrast, zolpidem (150), tracazolate (15), and CL 218872 (15) did not cause physical dependence by this criterion. This rapid and simple screening test may be readily used to predict the physical-dependence-inducing properties of compounds that act at the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "59": "One hundred female patients scheduled for elective breast surgery (mean age 60 +/- 11 years were randomly assigned to receive one of two premedications: ketobemidone (Ketogan) 1-1.5 ml or midazolam 4-5 mg, intramuscularly. The effects on preoperative anxiety and postoperative emetic sequelae were studied. All patients were anaesthetised with thiopentone, fentanyl and atracurium, and ventilated with a mixture of nitrous oxide in oxygen with supplementary isoflurane. Sixty-nine percent of the midazolam- and 50% of the ketobemidone-premedicated patients experienced a reduction in anxiety. Midazolam was found to be more effective than ketobemidone in reducing anxiety among more tense patients--those with a VAS grading before premedication of 2 or more (P less than 0.05). Midazolam-premedicated patients were also assessed by observers as being more relaxed (P less than 0.05). No difference was seen in the frequency of emetic sequelae: 20 patients in the midazolam group and 14 patients in the ketobemidone group vomited once or more during the 24-h observation period. There was no difference between the two groups in time until an analgetic was required. In conclusion, midazolam seemed more effective in reducing preoperative anxiety than ketobemidone without any negative effects on postoperative emesis or time until an analgetic was required.", 
    "60": "With the aging of the U.S. population, an increase in the use of the psychiatric emergency room by elderly persons is expected. In this study of 118 elderly persons seen in a general hospital psychiatric emergency room, half had a history of psychiatric illness. A third appeared to have chronic organic brain disease, and a third had affective disorders. Misprescription or misuse of medications was implicated in the problems of 27 patients. The problems of most patients were not emergencies; most had experienced symptoms of their presenting complaint for more than six months, finally overtaxing the coping capacities of their caregivers. The authors discuss factors that prevent elderly persons from seeking help on their own and emphasize the need for earlier interventions with elderly patients and for education of the public and professionals about issues, such as overmedication, that are important in the care of elderly persons.", 
    "61": "The medical community is becoming increasingly concerned about violent patients in healthcare settings. Healthcare professionals should be trained to deal with aggressive patients, and they should have access to a room free of dangerous objects for evaluation and examination. Having security personnel stand by may be appropriate in some cases. Verbal intervention is the key to dealing with violent patients. The safest and most effective pharmacologic intervention is use of benzodiazepines, either alone or in conjunction with antipsychotic agents when indicated. Seclusion or restraint may be needed for some violent patients; in such situations, close patient monitoring and explicit documentation are essential. Physicians can be held liable for injuries patients sustain while being restrained, so staff members should receive instruction in safe physical intervention techniques.", 
    "62": "A study of 50 opiate addicts attending a London service for treatment of drug dependence found that 47 subjects had previously made at least one attempt at self-detoxification. These subjects reported 212 previous attempts. Although 30 subjects reported having managed to complete at least one attempt, the success rate per episode was low (24%). One of the most commonly reported methods, used by 28 subjects, involved an abrupt cessation of opiates ('cold turkey'). Of the drugs used in their attempts at self-detoxification, benzodiazepines were reported by 24 subjects and opiates by 20. Practical strategies such as distraction and avoidance were also used. Self-help detoxification materials for opiate addicts might be useful.", 
    "63": "The presence of GABAA receptors (GABARs) in auditory brainstem nuclei of the chick was determined by immunocytochemical (ICC) and receptor autoradiographic techniques. A monoclonal antibody to the GABAR/benzodiazepine/chloride channel complex and radiolabeled ligand binding using [3H]-muscimol, a GABA agonist, revealed labeling in nucleus magnocellularis (NM), nucleus laminaris (NL), nucleus angularis (NA), and the superior olive (SO) in both posthatch and embryonic chicks. GABAR-immunoreactivity (GABAR-I), as well as [3H]-muscimol binding, appear homogeneous throughout these nuclei at all ages studied. During development, GABAR-I is first observed in these nuclei around embryonic day 13 (E13). GABAR-I, which appears heavier in embryos than in posthatch chicks, becomes less intense with age in all 4 nuclei. Levels of receptor binding are also greater in embryos compared to posthatch chicks. [3H]-Muscimol binding is consistently greatest in SO followed by that in NL. NM and NA exhibit the least amount of binding at all ages studied. [3H]-Muscimol binding decreases in auditory brainstem nuclei as a function of age. Two days after unilateral cochlea removal, there is an apparent increase in GABAR-I in the ipsilateral NM compared to controls. This, however, may be the result of a decrease in the cross-sectional area of NM neurons as a result of de-afferentation (Born and Rubel, 1985). In contrast, there is a 28% decrease in [3H]-muscimol binding in the ipsilateral NM compared to controls probably reflecting the 30% reduction in the number of NM neurons due to cochlea removal (Born and Rubel, 1985). Fourteen days after cochlea removal, there is still a small, but not significant, decrease in [3H]-muscimol binding in the ipsilateral NM. In the contralateral NM, GABAR-I is less intense compared to that in the ipsilateral NM and controls. Additionally, there is a slight but insignificant decrease in [3H]-muscimol binding compared to that in controls 2 days after cochlea removal. After 14 days survival, however, the average binding is similar to that in controls. Thus, cochlea removal appears to transiently decrease the number of GABARs in the ipsilateral NM and may have a similar, but not as dramatic, effect in the contralateral NM. These GABARs are most likely to be postsynaptic, that is, located on NM neurons.", 
    "64": "The effects of the competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists CPP (5 & 10 mg/kg) and NPC 12626 (25 & 40 mg/kg) and the noncompetitive NMDA antagonists phencyclidine (1, 3, & 6.25 mg/kg) and MK 801 (0.1 & 0.2 mg/kg) on performance of rats on a nonspatial delayed matching-to-sample working memory task were evaluated. At the highest dose, each NMDA antagonist reduced choice accuracy at all retention intervals. In contrast, the reference anticholinergic agent scopolamine selectively reduced accuracy at long retention intervals, suggesting that scopolamine but not the NMDA antagonists directly interfered with time-dependent working memory retention. Propranolol, diazepam, and phenylisopropyladenosine had little or no effect on choice accuracy, suggesting that noradrenergic, gamma-aminobutyric acid-diazepam, and adenosine receptors may be relatively unimportant for working memory performance as assessed in this task. The NMDA antagonists also differed from scopolamine in that doses of NMDA antagonists that reduced response accuracy also reduced response probability, altered bias (competitive antagonists only), and increased intertrial interval responding (noncompetitive antagonists only). It was concluded that NMDA antagonists disrupt cognitive functions including, but not limited to, those required for accurate working memory performance.", 
    "65": "1. The effects of cholecystokinin (CCK) on intact guinea-pig gall-bladder ganglia were investigated with intracellular, single-electrode current- and voltage-clamp recording techniques. 2. Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8; 0.01-100 nM) increased the amplitude of the fast excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) that was evoked by stimulation of interganglionic fibre tracts. In most cases, neurones that exhibited subthreshold EPSPs in normal Krebs solution fired action potentials in the presence of CCK-8. In a low Ca2+/high Mg2+ solution, CCK-8 caused a 3-fold increase in the amplitude of fast EPSPs. 3. The amplitude of the evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) was increased by CCK-8 (0.01-100 nM) in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect was maximal at 1.0 nM. 4. Cholecystokinin octapeptide caused a 3-fold increase in the quantal content of the EPSP in a low Ca2+/high Mg2+ solution, but had no effect on the quantal size. 5. The specific CCK-A receptor antagonist, MK-329 (formerly L-364,718; 1.0 nM), reversibly blocked the facilitatory effect of CCK-8 on ganglionic transmission. However, the specific CCK-B receptor antagonist, L-365,260 (10 nM), did not alter the presynaptic facilitatory effect of CCK-8. 6. The response of gall-bladder neurones to exogenously applied ACh was not modified by CCK-8. 7. Application of CCK-8, by superfusion (0.001-100 nM) or by pressure microejection (100 microM), had no effect on the membrane potential, membrane conductance, action potential, or threshold of gall-bladder neurones. 8. Immunohistochemistry was employed to determine whether the actions of CCK could be elicited by release of the peptide from nerve terminals within the ganglionated plexus of the gall-bladder. Immunoreactivity for CCK was not detected in the ganglionated plexus of the gall-bladder, but CCK immunoreactivity was plentiful in control preparations of intestinal myenteric and submucosal plexuses. 9. These results show that CCK has a presynaptic facilitatory effect on fast synaptic transmission in guinea-pig gall-bladder ganglia, and that this effect is mediated by presynaptic CCK-A receptors. Furthermore, it appears that such an effect would normally occur in response to hormonal CCK, rather than CCK that is released from nerve terminals.", 
    "66": "It is well known that some volatile anaesthetic drugs, such as halothane and isoflurane, alter the functions of the human thyroid gland, but the action of other anaesthetic drugs, such as thiopental, midazolam and ketamine, on thyroid function is still unknown. We have investigated the effects of these three drugs on the functional properties of human thyrocytes cultured in monolayers or follicles and stimulated by TSH. Thiopental, midazolam and ketamine induced total suppression or a partial reduction, depending on the dose administered, of cyclic AMP (cAMP), follicular thyroglobulin (Tg) and free tri-iodothyronine (FT3) production. In contrast, free thyroxine levels increased in the medium of thyrocytes cultured as follicles. Small doses of the drugs did not affect thyrocyte production. The inhibiting effect of thiopental, midazolam and ketamine on Tg and FT3 production seems to result from the inhibition of cAMP production and 5'-deiodinase.", 
    "67": "The ability of brain tissue preparation to generate superoxide from xenobiotic interactions has been investigated. We showed that a significant superoxide production occurred with different molecules known to undergo a single electron reductive pathway of metabolism, both in a homogenate derived from neuronal and glial cells and in isolated cerebral microvessels which form the blood-brain barrier. Determination of the nucleotide cofactors requirement and data obtained with different subcellular fractions indicated that this production was largely associated with the microsomal fraction in a NADPH-dependent pathway and was probably mediated by NADPH-cytochrome P450 (c) reductase. A significant xenobiotic-mediated production of superoxide also occurred in mitochondria under in vitro conditions. Thus the evidence of reductive pathways of xenobiotic metabolism and the generation of oxygenated free radicals observed are of neurotoxicological significance.", 
    "68": "The utility of the peripheral type benzodiazepine site ligand 11C-PK 11195, for imaging human glioma in conjunction with Positron Emission Tomography, relies on a high specific binding of the tracer to tumoral peripheral type benzodiazepines sites. In a patient with glioblastoma, we found that 11C-PK 11195 binding was two-fold higher in the tumor than in normal gray matter and that 30% of tumoral binding could be displaced by a large excess of unlabeled drug. These findings suggest that tumoral retention of the ligand is due, in part, to specific binding.", 
    "69": "Central and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors were localized in the rat, monkey, and human eye by in vitro autoradiography. Central benzodiazepine binding sites, visualized with 3H-R015-1788, were enriched in the inner plexiform layer in all three species. Binding sites also were present in the nerve fiber layer, the ganglion cell layer, and in portions of the inner nuclear layer. Peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites, visualized with 3H-PK-11195, were found in the corneal epithelium and endothelium, iris, ciliary epithelium, trabecular meshwork, and throughout the retina. Binding sites for 3H-PK-11195 also were present in the retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris areas and retinal vascular structures.", 
    "70": "Central type benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor binding in spontaneously epileptic rats (SER) and their parent strains, tremor rats and zitter rats, and Kyoto/Wistar rats were investigated. Significantly lower BDZ receptor densities (Bmax) and no differences in affinity (KD) were found in the hippocampus of the two epileptic strains, SER and tremor rats, in comparison with Kyoto/Wistar rats and zitter rats. This abnormality is considered to be due to a tremor gene and to be related to absence-like seizures in SER and tremor rats. A significant decrease of KD and an increase of Bmax in the brain stem were found in SER in comparison with Kyoto/Wistar rats. These changes may be due to a zitter gene, since zitter rats show the same tendency, and they may be related to tonic seizures in SER. Bmax was significantly increased in the cerebellum and hippocampus of the zitter rats, while KD was not changed, in comparison with Kyoto/Wistar rats and tremor rats. These changes may reflect the relatively selective loss of tissue lacking BDZ receptors or an upregulation in response to the loss of GABAergic neurons in zitter rats.", 
    "71": "The existence of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) in vascular smooth muscle has been demonstrated in this laboratory. The present study utilized the photoaffinity ligand [3H]PK14105 to identify the protein subunit in rat aortic and other smooth muscle types to which high affinity ligands for the PBR bind. [3H]PK14105 bound to mitochondrial fractions isolated from rat aortic smooth muscle with high affinity (Kd = 7.0 +/- 0.5 nM) and high density (Bmax = 10.1 +/- 1.5 pmol/mg protein). The rank order of potency of a series of PBR ligands displacing the binding was PK11195 approximately equal to Ro5-4864 greater than protoporphyrin IX greater than flunitrazepam greater than diazepam much greater than clonazepam. [3H]PK14105 bound with comparable affinity and density to mitochondria isolated from rat myometrium and gastric smooth muscle as well. With ultraviolet irradiation, [3H]PK14105 specifically labeled a single protein of approximately 17 kDa in all three smooth muscle types examined. This protein was identical in size to that identified by [3H]PK14105 in rat adrenal gland. In adrenal gland an additional, minor protein of approximately 43 kDa was also specifically labeled by [3H]PK14105. Utilizing a probe designed from the known nucleotide sequence of the PBR in rat adrenal gland, an mRNA transcript of approximately 0.8 kilobases in size was identified in rat aortic smooth muscle by Northern blot analysis. These data indicate that a protein subunit of approximately 17 kDa comprises, at least in part, the PBR not only in vascular smooth muscle, but also in other smooth muscle types and adrenal gland as well.", 
    "72": "Diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) is a 9-kDa polypeptide that was initially isolated from rat brain and subsequently found to be present in several peripheral tissues. DBI is particularly abundant in steroidogenic tissues, such as the adrenal glands and testes, which also contain a high concentration of peripheral/mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors (MBRs). Because occupancy of adrenal MBRs with DBI results in increased steroidogenesis, we have investigated the relation between ACTH, DBI, and the MBR in the rat adrenal glands. Evidence presented here indicates that both the amount of DBI and its rate of synthesis in the adrenal cortex are under the control of ACTH. Seven and 9 days after hypophysectomy, the amount of DBI-like immunoreactivity (DBI-LI) in rat adrenal glands decreased dramatically from approximately 80 to 15 ng/mg tissue. The administration of single dose of ACTH (ACTH residues 1-39; 200 mU/kg, iv) or repeated doses of ACTH-R (ACTH in saline containing 16% gelatin; 15 U/kg, sc, twice daily) reduced the decrease in adrenal DBI-LI caused by hypophysectomy. In hypophysectomized rats (7 days after hypophysectomy) the increases in both adrenal DBI-LI and plasma corticosterone induced by ACTH 1 h after a single injection (200 mU/kg, iv) were inhibited by injection of cycloheximide (40 mg/kg, ip) 10 min after ACTH. However, cycloheximide at this dose had no effect on the ACTH-induced increase in adrenal cAMP concentration or the number of affinity of MBRs for 4'-[3H]chlorodiazepam.", 
    "73": "The antinociceptive effects of an intrathecally administered benzodiazepine agonist midazolam, alone and in combination with morphine, were examined in the rat by using the tail-flick test. The duration of antinociceptive effect produced by midazolam was significantly less (P less than 0.05) than that produced by morphine. Low doses of midazolam (10 micrograms) and morphine (10 micrograms) produced a synergistic effect in prolonging antinociceptive effect. However, at higher doses (20 or 30 micrograms), these drugs reduced the extent of antinociception produced by each other. Naloxone administration prevented antinociception produced by these drugs, indicating interactions between midazolam and opioid receptors. Midazolam had dual effects on the binding of opioid ligands to the spinal opioid receptors. At low dose, it potentiated the displacement of [3H]naloxone by morphine. At higher doses, midazolam inhibited the binding of opioid ligands to their spinal receptors in the following order: kappa greater than delta greater than mu. These results indicate that differential antinociceptive effects of midazolam on morphine-induced antinociception involve interaction of this benzodiazepine with spinal opioid receptors.", 
    "74": "Unique cytoplasmic loop regions of the alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, and alpha 5 subunits of the GABAA receptor have been expressed in E. coli and used to generate polyclonal antisera specific for these subunits. The antibodies identify proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting of molecular size 51 kDa, 53 kDa, 59 kDa and 55 kDa, respectively, which show differential patterns of expression during development. Whereas the alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunits are present at early stages, the expression of alpha 1 and alpha 3 subunits is low at birth and increases with age. This differential expression could be correlated with previous studies examining the developmental expression of BZ1 and BZ2 benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "75": "In the preceding paper, by means of selective agonists to gastrin (HG-17) and cholecystokinin (CCK-39), we evidenced the existence of \"gastrin-type\" receptors that could regulate histamine release and \"CCK-type\" receptors that could stimulate somatostatin release in isolated rabbit fundic non-parietal cells (F1 cells). Furthermore, these receptors could induce phosphoinositide breakdown. To confirm the involvement of these receptor types in these biological and biochemical processes, we used selective antagonists, L-364,718 (3-(benzoylamino)-benzodiazepine) specific to \"CCK-A-type\" receptor and L-365,260 (3-(acylamino)-benzodiazepine) specific to \"gastrin/CCK-B-type\" receptor. Neither L-364,718 nor L-365,260 alone caused any significant stimulation of [3H]inositol phosphate ([3H]InsP) production and release of histamine or somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI). Each analogue inhibited in a dose-dependent manner [125I]HG-17 or [125I]CCK-39 binding to F1 cells, [3H]InsP accumulation and histamine and SLI release stimulated by HG-17 or CCK-39. L-365,260 appeared to be 30-70 times more potent than L-364,718 in inhibiting [125I]HG-17 binding to F1 cells, as well as HG-17-induced [3H]InsP accumulation and HG-17-or CCK-39-enhanced histamine release (IC50 values: approximately 5-20 nM for L-365,260 and approximately 200-1500 nM for L-364,718). In contrast, L-364,718 was 200 to 400 times more potent than L-365,260 in inhibiting [125I]CCK-39 binding to F1 cells, CCK-39-induced [3H]-InsP accumulation and SLI release stimulated by CCK-39 or HG-17 (IC50 values: approximately 0.3-1 nM for L-364,718 and 100-200 nM for L-365,260). These results led to conclude: (i) the existence of a \"gastrin-type\" receptor related to histamine release: (ii) the existence of a \"CCK-A-type\" receptor related to somatostatin release; (iii) the existence of \"gastrin type\" and \"CCK-A-type\" receptors linked to the phosphoinositide breakdown pathway.", 
    "76": "The muscarinic receptor subtype which triggers acid secretion was investigated in isolated rabbit gastric parietal cells. Cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), measured with the fluorescent indicator FURA-2, increased rapidly after full agonist (carbachol) stimulation (6-8 sec), then returned to an intermediate sustained value. Other M2-agonists, oxotremorine and arecoline, produced a partial [Ca2+]i increase, whereas M1-agonists, pilocarpine and [4-m-chlorophenylcarbamoyloxyl]-2-butynyl-trimethylammonium, were without any significant effect. [Ca2+]i rise was inhibited by selective muscarinic antagonists: atropine greater than 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine methbromide greater than quinuclidinylbenzilate (QNB) greater than pirenzepine greater than 11-[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H- pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one, this sequence being characteristic of the involvement of an M3-subtype. This inhibition was shown to be stereoselective; dexetimide and (-)QNB were more potent than levetimide and (+)QNB. The IC50 values for inhibition of [Ca2+]i increase by muscarinic antagonists were in good agreement with those obtained for inhibition of phospholipase C activation. In conclusion, the muscarinic receptor that controls acid secretion appears to be of the M3-subtype and the biochemical events coupled to the activation of this receptor system are also controlled through the same subtype.", 
    "77": "High affinity binding of isoquinolines, such as PK 11195, is a conserved feature of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) across species. However, species differences in PBR ligand binding have been described based on the affinity for N1-alkyl-1,4-benzodiazepines, such as Ro5-4864. Ro5-4864 binds with high affinity to the rat receptor but has low affinity for the bovine PBR. Photolabeling with an isoquinoline ligand, [3H]PK 14105, identifies a 17-kDa protein, the PBR isoquinoline binding protein (PBR/IBP), in both species. To further elucidate the role of the PBR/IBP in determining PBR benzodiazepine and isoquinoline binding characteristics, the bovine PBR/IBP was cloned and expressed. Using a cDNA encoding a rat PBR/IBP to screen a fetal bovine adrenal cDNA library, a bovine cDNA encoding a polypeptide of 169 residues was cloned. The bovine and rat PBR/IBPs had similar hydropathy profiles exhibiting five potential transmembrane domains. Transfecting the cloned bovine PBR/IBP cDNA into COS-7 cells resulted in an 11-fold increase in the density of high affinity [3H]PK 11195 binding sites which had only low affinity for Ro5-4864. Expression of the bovine PBR/IBP yields a receptor which is pharmacologically distinct from both endogenous COS-7 PBR and the rat PBR based on the affinity for several N1-alkyl-1,4-benzodiazepine ligands. These results suggest the PBR/IBP is the minimal functional component required for PBR ligand binding characteristics and the different protein sequences account for the species differences in PBR benzodiazepine ligand binding.", 
    "78": "To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of acid secretion by cholecystokinin (CCK) in vivo, we compared the effects of CCK and gastrin on acid secretion and histidine decarboxylase (HDC) activity. We also examined the effects of MK-329, a specific antagonist for pancreatic-type CCK receptor, and L-365,260, a specific antagonist for gastrin-type CCK receptor, on the action of CCK. Graded doses of CCK or gastrin were intravenously infused into conscious rats with gastric fistula. Gastrin-17 I infusion up to 10 nmol/kg/h resulted in dose-related increases in acid secretion. CCK-8 infusion also caused an increase in acid secretion. However, it reached a peak with 0.3 nmol/kg/h CCK-8 and attenuated with higher concentrations of CCK-8. This attenuating effect of a higher dose of CCK was reversed by MK-329, but not by L-365,260. Both CCK and gastrin were potent in increasing fundic HDC activity, and the effect of CCK on HDC activity was significantly inhibited by L-365,260, but not by MK-329. Taken together, the present study suggests that CCK and gastrin stimulate histamine formation via a gastrin-type CCK receptor, and the attenuating action of CCK with higher concentrations on acid secretion in vivo is mediated by a pancreatic-type CCK receptor.", 
    "79": "In order to identify the receptor subtype responsible for acetylcholine (ACh)-induced relaxation of bovine coronary artery, we determined the affinity of six subtype-selective muscarinic antagonists and compared them with affinity estimates obtained for bovine left atria. At low concentrations, ACh potently relaxed circular strips of coronary artery with endothelium (EC50 0.15 microM), but contracted them at higher agonist concentrations with potencies that depended on the presence or absence of endothelium: EC50 1.8 microM (without endothelium); 4.6 microM (with endothelium). The pA2 values obtained for antagonism of relaxant responses to ACh were: pirenzepine (M1-selective) 7.38 +/- 0.12; AF-DX 116 (11-[2-(diethylamino-methyl)-1-piperidinyl-acetyl]-5,11- dihydro-6H-pyrido(2,3-b)1,4-benzodiazepine-6-one; M2-selective) 5.79 +/- 0.09; and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine-methobromide (4-DAMP; M3/M1-selective) 9.07 +/- 0.12. The corresponding Schild slopes were 0.98 +/- 0.07 for pirenzepine, 1.17 +/- 0.09 for AF-DX 116 and 1.01 +/- 0.04 for 4-DAMP. For the following three antagonists, pKB values were determined at two different antagonist concentrations: dicyclomine (M1-selective) 7.49 +/- 0.10, cyclohexylphenyl-(2-piperidinoethyl)-silanol (CPPS; M3-selective) 8.0 +/- 0.10, and parafluoro-hexahydrosila-difenidol (pFHHSiD; M3-selective) 7.87 +/- 0.10. For comparison, the antagonism of methacholine-induced negative inotropy in left atria was determined for three antagonists, yielding the following pA2 values: pirenzepine 5.98 +/- 0.14; AF-DX 116 6.81 +/- 0.14 and 4-DAMP 7.99 +/- 0.14. The slopes of the corresponding Schild plots were 1.05 +/- 0.10, 1.14 +/- 0.12 and 1.08 +/- 0.08, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "80": "The present study investigated whether there is any difference between the effects of benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics on maternal aggression in lactating mice, using an ethological technique. We used SM-3997, a 5-HT1A receptor ligand, as a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic. Behavior towards an intruder male mouse was assessed on postpartum days 5 and 7 in female mice that had been housed alone since the end of the 4-day mating period. Acute oral administration of diazepam had a biphasic effect on the frequency of bites: 1 mg/kg diazepam significantly increased bite frequency, while 2.5 mg/kg diazepam significantly decreased it. However, 2.5 mg/kg diazepam also caused a significant decrease in locomotor activity. In contrast, SM-3997 (1, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg p.o.) significantly decreased the frequency of bites in a dose-dependent manner without causing motor dysfunction. Chronic treatment with 5 mg/kg SM-3997 significantly decreased the frequency of bites when compared with vehicle, whereas diazepam was ineffective at the doses used (0.5 and 1 mg/kg p.o.). The findings suggest that the proaggressive effect is specific to benzodiazepines, and that 5-HT1A receptors may be involved in the suppression of maternal aggression in mice.", 
    "81": "Pentobarbital and benzodiazepines were compared in their interaction with the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonists picrotoxin and bicuculline on GABAA receptor-mediated events. On excised vagal nerves and dorsal roots pentobarbital, in contrast to the benzodiazepines diazepam, lorazepam and flurazepam, was able to enhance GABA-induced depolarizations recorded in the presence of picrotoxin or bicuculline. On hemicord preparations picrotoxin simultaneously depressed the electrically evoked dorsal root-dorsal root potential and enhanced the dorsal root-ventral root potential. Pentobarbital overcame the effects of picrotoxin, whereas diazepam and midazolam were without effect. These results may be explained by the suggestion that the GABA receptors in these test systems are not tightly associated with the benzodiazepine receptor activated by diazepam, lorazepam, midazolam and flurazepam, and correspond to the recently described GABAA2 subdivision of GABA receptors.", 
    "82": "R 82913, a tetrahydroimidazobenzodiazepinthione (TIBO) derivative with potent activity against human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) in vitro, was given to 22 patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex in a dose-escalating pilot study. Doses of 10 to 300 mg administered daily by intravenous infusion were well tolerated for up to 50 weeks, with no haematological or biochemical evidence of toxicity. Mean OKT4 cell count rose slightly during the second month of treatment when higher steady-state plasma concentrations of the drug were achieved. Median p24 antigen concentration fell by 41% during the first month of therapy. When the rise in p24 antigen before therapy was compared to the fall during treatment, end-point analysis showed a significant difference (p less than 0.03). The combination of potent antiretroviral activity in vitro and the observed effect on HIV p24 antigen and absence of toxicity in vivo indicate that R 82913 and related TIBO derivatives merit further study in the treatment of retroviral infections.", 
    "83": "3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) was measured by differential pulse voltammetry in the neostriatum of anesthetized rats. DL-Muscarine (2.9 nmol) applied into the substantia nigra pars compacta, increased DOPAC concentration in the ipsilateral neostriatum. This effect was blocked by pirenzepine (2.8 nmol), and potentiated by AF-DX 116 (2.8 nmol). These results indicate the existence of two types of muscarinic receptors on dopaminergic neurons, whose activation produces opposing effects on dopamine metabolism in neostriatum.", 
    "84": "Using Sokoloff's 2-deoxyglucose autoradiography procedure, the effects of trizolam, a classical benzodiazepine (BZ) hypnotic, were compared to those of zolpidem, which preferentially binds to BZ1 receptor subtypes. Triazolam depressed metabolism in 40 of the more than 60 brain regions evaluated. Zolpidem depressed metabolism in all of these areas, including the spinal cord, an area where the BZ1 receptor subtype is not supposed to exist. Zolpidem and triazolam also depressed metabolism in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, an area low in BZ1 receptors. Neither drug affected metabolism in 21 areas, including the regions most specific for the BZ1 subtype (cerebellum, inferior colliculus, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra pars reticularis). It is concluded that: (i) zolpidem and triazolam depress energy metabolism of the same areas of the brain, (ii) zolpidem's effects may not be mediated solely through the BZ1 receptor subtype, and (iii) the BZ2 receptor may be functionally more significant than the BZ1 receptor.",

In cats from age embryonic day 40 to postnatal day 6 and at adulthood, M1 sites were labeled with [3H]pirenzepine and M2 sites were labeled with [3H]N-methylscopolamine in competition with pirenzepine. Comparisons were made among binding site distributions, acetylcholinesterase staining and tyrosine hydroxylase-like immunoreactivity in serial or neighboring nigral tissue sections. M1 and M2 binding sites were present in the substantia nigra at all ages studied. Qualitative comparisons showed that M1 binding delineated the substantia nigra more distinctly than did M2 binding. For M1 binding sites in particular, the embryonic pars reticulata of the substantia nigra was more prominently labeled than the pars compacta. At adulthood both nigral subdivisions clearly exhibited M1 and M2 binding, with the pars compacta demonstrating some internal heterogeneity of binding density. These findings provide further evidence that the substantia nigra is a site of cholinergic transmission and suggest that the functional balance between acetylcholine and dopamine in the basal ganglia acts here as well as in the striatum.", 
    "87": "Previous studies have shown that the alpha subunit of the GABAA receptor contains the flunitrazepam binding site. In the present study, in situ hybridization and receptor autoradiography were used to examine the temporal and spatial relationships between alpha 1 subunit mRNA and [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites in the developing mouse cerebellum. A [35S]cRNA probe was used to study the expression of GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor alpha 1 subunit mRNA by in situ hybridization. At postnatal day (P) 1, a diffuse band of labeling was observed in the molecular/Purkinje cell layer; subsequently, this band became progressively more concentrated and restricted to the interface between the granular and molecular layers. By P5-P7, high intensity labeling was clearly associated with Purkinje cells. Clusters of grains became visible over basket and stellate cells in the molecular layer between P11 and P13; the internal granule cell layer and the deep cerebellar nuclei showed an increasingly strong hybridization signal during postnatal development. The external germinal layer was devoid of labeling throughout its existence. The developmental distribution of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites was studied by receptor autoradiography. Cerebellar labeling was detectable at birth, with the highest levels present over the deep cerebellar nuclei, and relatively low levels equally distributed over the molecular and Purkinje cell layers. Cerebellar cortical grain density increased gradually during postnatal weeks 1 and 2, with the molecular, Purkinje and granule cell layers remaining essentially equally labeled. Between P11 and P15, the labeling over the molecular layer increased dramatically, reaching the high adult levels by P20. As with the in situ hybridization studies, there was a complete absence of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites in the external germinal layer throughout development. These results indicate that, in the Purkinje cell, the production of mRNA and the synthesis of the alpha 1 subunit occur prior to the formation of afferent inhibitory synapses, suggesting that GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor expression precedes, and is independent of GABAergic synaptic input.", 
    "88": "The convulsive effects of methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM), a benzodiazepine receptor ligand, are different in two inbred strains of mice: BALB/cBy mice are more sensitive to beta-CCM than C57BL/6J mice. In the present article, we report the effects of [3H]flunitrazepam binding in these two strains, which suggest a possible explanation of the differences in their sensitivity to beta-CCM by the involvement of brain benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "89": "The peripheral type benzodiazepine binding site (PTBBS) has been proposed to be a good marker for reactive glial cells following brain insults. In the present study, homogenate binding of 3H-Ro5-4864 and quantitative autoradiography of 3H-PK-11195 binding (two ligands for the PTBBS) were used to assess the distribution, time-course and extent of reactive gliosis in the hippocampus following deafferentation by unilateral entorhinal cortex lesion or neuronal death produced by intrahippocampal colchicine injection. Intrahippocampal colchicine injections produced a 3-fold increase in 3H-Ro5-4864 binding in the dentate gyrus within 2 days. This effect was doubled in animals pretreated with the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine. Quantitative autoradiography of 3H-PK-11195 binding 1 or 2 weeks after colchicine injection indicated that the increase in binding was restricted to the dorsal hippocampus both rostrally and caudally and was present in the dentate gyrus and CA1. Following a unilateral electrolytic lesion of the entorhinal cortex, the binding of 3H-Ro5-4864 to homogenates of the dentate gyrus was doubled 18 h after the lesion, reached a maximum at 4 days post-lesion, and returned to control values by 2 months after the lesion. A transient increase in binding was also observed 2 and 4 days post-lesion in the dentate gyrus contralateral to the lesion side. Autoradiography of 3H-PK-11195 binding indicated that the increase in PTBBS following entorhinal cortex lesion was restricted to the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
