    "0": "The behavior of four monkeys trained on a multiple schedule was differentially sensitive to selected pharmacological agents. The three components of the multiple schedule were: (1) a variable-interval schedule in which responses were reinforced on the average of once per minute; (2) a concurrent schedule in which every tenth response was reinforced and every fifteenth response, on the average, was shocked; and, (3) a neutral stimulus in the presence of which responses were neither reinforced nor shocked. Pentobarbital, chlordiazepoxide, and meprobamate increased responding during each of the components. Scopolamine and d-amphetamine decreased variable-interval performance, had minimal effects on performance during the concurrent-schedule component, and increased responding in the presence of the neutral stimulus. Chlorpromazine decreased variable-interval responding and had slight effects on the responding during the other two components."
