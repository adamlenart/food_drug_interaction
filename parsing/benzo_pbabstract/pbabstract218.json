A population-based case-control study was conducted in which the prevalence of risk factors and the medical histories of patients prescribed COX-2 inhibitors and traditional nonselective NSAIDs were compared. The study population consisted of a random sample of members of the Quebec drug plan (age 18 years or older) who received at least one dispensation of celecoxib (n = 42,422; cases), rofecoxib (n = 25,674; cases), or traditional nonselective NSAIDs (n = 12,418; controls) during the year 2000. All study data were obtained from the Quebec health care databases. Adjusting for income level, Chronic Disease Score, prior use of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, prescriber specialty, and time period, the following factors were significantly associated with the prescription of COX-2 inhibitors: age 75 years or older (odds ratio [OR] 4.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.95-4.51), age 55-74 years (OR 3.23, 95% CI 3.06-3.40), female sex (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.45-1.58), prior diagnosis of gastropathy (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.08-1.36) and prior dispensation of gastroprotective agents (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.47-1.67). Patients who received a traditional nonselective NSAID recently were more likely to switch to a coxib, especially first-time users (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.93-2.43). Associations were significantly greater for celecoxib than rofecoxib for age, chronic NSAID use, and last NSAID use between 1 and 3 months before the index date. At the time of introduction of COX-2 inhibitors into the formulary, prescription channeling could confound risk comparisons across products.", 
    "1": "Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia occurs commonly in patients in primary care settings. This article assesses multiple evidence-based reviews of effective treatments for panic disorder. Antidepressant medications successfully reduce the severity of panic symptoms and eliminate panic attacks. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants are equally effective in the treatment of panic disorder. The choice of medication is based on side effect profiles and patient preferences. Strong evidence supports the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy in treating panic disorder. Family physicians who are not trained in cognitive behavior therapy may refer patients with panic disorder to therapists with such training. Cognitive behavior therapy can be used alone or in combination with antidepressants to treat patients with panic disorder. Benzodiazepines are effective in treating panic disorder symptoms, but they are less effective than antidepressants and cognitive behavior therapy.",

By random-effects calculations, the results of large and smaller trials differed beyond chance in four meta-analyses (25%). In three of these disagreements (effect of day care on IQ, discontinuation of antidepressants, risperidone versus typical antipsychotics for schizophrenia), the smaller trials showed greater effect sizes than the large trials. The inverse was seen in one case (olanzapine versus typical antipsychotics for schizophrenia). With fixed-effects models, disagreements beyond chance occurred in five cases (31%). In four meta-analyses, the effect size differed over twofold between large and smaller trials.

    "6": "Previous studies had shown that pretreatment with midazolam inhibited morphine-induced tolerance and dependence. The present study was to investigate the role of spinal nitric oxide (NO) in the inhibitory effect of midazolam on the development of morphine-induced analgesia tolerance. Subcutaneous injection of 100 mg/kg morphine to mice caused an acute morphine-induced analgesia tolerance model. To develop chronic morphine tolerance in mice, morphine was injected for three consecutive days (10, 20, 50 mg/kg sc on Day 1, 2, 3, respectively). In order to develop chronic tolerance model in rats, 10 mg/kg of morphine was given twice daily at 12 h intervals for 10 days. Midazolam was intraperitoneally injected 30 min prior to administration of morphine. Tail-flick test, hot-plate and formalin test were conducted to assess the nociceptive response. Immunocytochemistry, histochemistry and western blot were performed to determine the effect of midazolam on formalin-induced expression of Fos protein, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in chronic morphine-tolerant rats, respectively. The results showed that pretreatment with midazolam significantly inhibited the development of acute and chronic morphine tolerance in mice, which could be partially reversed by intrathecal injection of NO precursor L-arginine (L-Arg). In chronic morphine-tolerant rats, pretreatment with midazolam significantly decreased the formalin-induced expression of Fos and Fos/NADPH-d double-labeled neurons in the contralateral spinal cord and NADPH-d positive neurons in the bilateral spinal cord. Both inducible NOS (iNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS) protein levels in the spinal cord were significantly increased after injection of formalin, which could be inhibited by pretreatment with midazolam. The above results suggested that the decrease of the activity and expression of NOS contributed to the inhibitory effect of midazolam on the development of morphine tolerance.", 
    "7": "Forced swimming induces alterations in the GABA brain concentration and could change the sensitivity of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor-chloride ionophore complex to benzodiazepines. This change in sensitivity could be explained by the allopregnanolone release that takes place during stress. The current study was carried out to determine whether forced swimming is able to modify the anti-anxiety effect of diazepam and to explore the possible relation of this change to allopregnanolone, the GABA concentration or/and the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor density. Unstressed and stressed mice, injected with the vehicle or diazepam, were evaluated in the exploratory behavior test. Diazepam induced clear anxiolytic actions at all doses in unstressed animals, but such an effect was not observed in stressed animals. The injection of allopregnanolone 24 h before the anxiety test blocked the effect of this benzodiazepine. Forced swimming decreased GABA concentrations in the hippocampus and the thalamus-hypothalamus region, besides decreasing the [(3)H]flunitrazepam labeling in both the hypothalamus and amygdala. These results show that forced swimming abolishes the anti-anxiety effect of diazepam.",

There was no effect of MPEP up to 30 mg/kg on working memory in the DMTP task, but at 100 mg/kg, there was a significant reduction in choice accuracy at the longest delay interval (24 s). MPEP (3--30 mg/kg) did not significantly impair spatial learning in the Morris water maze, although during the last probe trial, 30-mg/kg-treated rats were significantly less accurate than controls. In contrast, diazepam significantly impaired performance in both the DMTP and Morris water maze tests. Assessment of plasma and brain concentration of MPEP approximately 75 min following oral administration showed a dose linearity from 3 to 30 mg/kg and good brain penetration, i.e. a brain/plasma ratio of 3.1.",

    "13": "Despite the advances in antipsychotic pharmacotherapy over the past decade, many atypical antipsychotic agents are not readily accessible by patients with major psychosis or in developing countries where the acquisition costs may be prohibitive. Olanzapine is an efficacious and widely prescribed atypical antipsychotic agent. In theory, olanzapine therapeutic dose requirement may be reduced during concurrent treatment with inhibitors of drug metabolism. In vitro studies suggest that smoking-inducible cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 contributes to formation of the metabolite 4'-N-desmethylolanzapine. The present prospective study tested the hypothesis that olanzapine steady-state doses can be significantly decreased by coadministration of a low subclinical dose of fluvoxamine, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 1A2. The study design followed a targeted \"at-risk\" population approach with a focus on smokers who were likely to exhibit increased cytochrome P450 1A2 expression. Patients with stable psychotic illness (N = 10 men, all smokers) and receiving chronic olanzapine treatment were evaluated for steady-state plasma concentrations of olanzapine and 4'-N-desmethylolanzapine. Subsequently, olanzapine dose was reduced from 17.5 +/- 4.2 mg/d (mean +/- SD) to 13.0 +/- 3.3 mg/d, and a nontherapeutic dose of fluvoxamine (25 mg/d, PO) was added to regimen. Patients were reevaluated at 2, 4, and 6 weeks during olanzapine-fluvoxamine cotreatment. There was no significant change in olanzapine plasma concentration, antipsychotic response, or metabolic indices (eg, serum glucose and lipids) after dose reduction in the presence of fluvoxamine (P > 0.05). 4'-N-desmethylolanzapine/olanzapine metabolic ratio decreased from 0.45 +/- 0.20 at baseline to 0.25 +/- 0.11 at week 6, suggesting inhibition of the cytochrome P450 1A2-mediated olanzapine 4'-N-demethylation by fluvoxamine (P < 0.05). In conclusion, this prospective pilot study suggests that a 26% reduction in olanzapine therapeutic dose requirement may be achieved by coadministration of a nontherapeutic oral dose of fluvoxamine.", 
    "14": "A meta-analytic review of the efficacy of pharmacological treatment in generalized anxiety disorder was conducted. The main substance classes were compared: benzodiazepines and azapirones. The impact of methodological variables was investigated such as sample size and use of a placebo run-in. After a comprehensive literature search to May 2002 (via databases, hand search, secondary sources, internet, contact of researchers, and pharmaceutical companies), the results of 48 studies were integrated. Weighted Hedges g was computed and a random-effects analysis was done. Effect sizes were computed for anxiety, depression, and clinical significance. Sensitivity analyses were conducted. Pharmacotherapy was superior to placebo in all symptom categories. Azapirones and benzodiazepines were equally effective. Compliance (as measured by dropout rate) was higher for benzodiazepines. Only sample size was significantly associated with effect size. Pharmacotherapy, especially benzodiazepines and azapirones, is effective in the short-term treatment of patients with generalized anxiety disorder. There was no superiority of 1 drug class in reducing symptomatology.", 
    "15": "Diazepam is commonly used as premedicant for endoscopic procedures. Wide interindividual differences have been observed in the residual cognitive effects of the drug after gastrointestinal endoscopy. Our aim was to clarify the major factors, including pharmacokinetic factors, contributing to this wide variation in residual cognitive effect after gastrointestinal endoscopy in the study. Sixty-one outpatients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy participated in the study. Cognitive effects were evaluated in the diazepam group (n=52) by the digit symbol substitution test (DSST) twice before and 30 min after an intravenous administration of 5 mg diazepam; in the intervening time gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed. Plasma concentrations of diazepam were determined by HPLC. The control group (n=9) was tested by DSST in the same manner. The cognitive effects according to the change in DSST score was significantly decline in the diazepam group compared with the control group (by 0.2 versus -4.6; P=0.014). This prospective study confirmed that cognition was significantly impaired after gastrointestinal endoscopy by premedication to subjects with 5 mg diazepam. There were very wide variations in change in DSST score. However we could not identify the independent variables that best predicted DSST score difference in a multiple regression analysis for age, plasma albumin level, and plasma diazepam concentration 30 min after intravenous administration. We should pay attention to patients' individual states in cognitive performance following gastrointestinal endoscopy after single-dose diazepam.", 
    "16": "We have studied the mechanism of apoptosis elicited by the farnesyltransferase inhibitor (R)-7-cyano-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1-(1H-imidazol-4-ylmethyl)-3-(phenylmethyl)-4-(2-thienylsulfonyl)-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine (BMS-214662) in human myeloma cell lines. Low concentrations of BMS-214662 efficiently inhibited protein farnesylation but did not affect the activation of Akt. BMS-214662 treatment increased levels of the BH3-only protein PUMA; induced proapoptotic conformational changes of Bax and Bak; reduced Mcl-1 levels; caused mitochondrial transmembrane potential loss; induced cytochrome c release, caspase activation, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) nuclear translocation, and phosphatidylserine exposure; and allowed the development of apoptotic morphology. Western blot analysis of cell extracts revealed the activation of caspases 2, 3, 8, and 9 upon treatment with BMS-214662. The general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk significantly prevented BMS-214662-induced death in U266 and RPMI 8226 cells but not in NCI-H929 cells. A mixture of selective caspase inhibitors for caspases 9 [N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-LEHD-fmk)], 3 (Z-DEVD-fmk), and 6 (Z-VEID-fmk) approached the protective effect of Z-VAD upon cell death. However, Z-VAD-fmk did not prevent BMS-214662-induced Bax and Bak activation and decrease of Mcl-1 levels. According to its effect on cell death, Z-VAD-fmk inhibited nuclear translocation of AIF in RPMI 8226 and U266 but not in NCI-H929 cells. These results suggest that apoptosis triggered by BMS-214662 is initiated by a PUMA/Bax/Bak/Mcl-1-dependent mechanism. In some cell lines, Bax/Bak activation is not sufficient per se to induce mitochondrial failure and release of apoptogenic proteins, and so caspases need to be activated to facilitate apoptosis. After DeltaPsi(m) loss, execution of apoptosis was performed in all cases by a cytochrome c-enabled, caspase-9-triggered, caspase cascade and the nuclear action of AIF.", 
    "17": "Reelin and GAD(67) expression is downregulated in cortical interneurons of schizophrenia (SZ) patients. This downregulation is probably mediated by epigenetic hypermethylation of the respective promoters caused by the selective increase of DNA-methyltransferase 1 in GABAergic neurons. Mice receiving methionine (MET) provide an epigenetic model for neuropathologies related to SZ. We studied whether MET-induced epigenetic reelin promoter hypermethylation and the associated behavioral alterations can be reduced by valproate in doses that inhibit histone deacetylases (HDACs).",

    "21": "Gynaecologic oncology day surgery deals primarily with the diagnosis of endometrial, cervical, vulvar and vaginal tumors. Conscious sedation is an important technique used in gynaecologic oncology day surgery. It is often associated with regional anaesthesia. The goals of conscious sedation are to provide effective pain control with complete safety, reduction of the recovery time, of the infection risk and cost. Since the consequences of the immunosuppressive effects of the opiates and the surgical stress could lead to an increased susceptibility to post-operative infections and a possible lack of immunological defence in the cancer patients, we investigated the possibility of eliminating the administration of opiates during minor operations in gynaecologic oncology day surgery. In this study, 400 patients, aged between 35 and 77 years, underwent surgery using sedation at the day hospital annexed to the Gynaecology and Obstetrics Department of the 2nd University of Naples, Italy. The patients were randomized into two equal study groups, according to a computer-generated randomised list. All patients were seen by the consultant anaesthetist three days before surgery. In all cases, during surgery, we monitored the main vital parameters such as ECG, HR and RR, BT, BP and SO. The drugs commonly used were: opioids, hypnotics and benzodiazepines, associated or not, with local anaesthetics. By using these drugs, pain and anxiety were reduced, sedation and amnesia were accomplished. In our experience, conscious sedation seems to be the best choice in gynaecologic oncology day surgery because it presents low toxicity, is short acting and readily reversible, has a low cost and, finally, because it is more comfortable for the patients. Moreover, it is possible to eliminate the administration of opiates during conscious sedation for less invasive surgical procedures.", 
    "22": "Due to their widespread biological activities and favorable pharmacokinetic properties, benzodiazepines were among the first classes of small molecules to be synthesized on solid supports. Since then, there have been numerous reports on the synthesis of similar skeletons. We have employed the T1 triazene linker to yield 1,4-benzodiazepin-5-one. Starting from various substituted triazene resins, cleavage in the presence of an azide donor, such as trimethylsilylazide, gave rise to aryl azides. Intramolecular aza-Wittig reactions produced the appropriately functionalized N-heterocycles. By using this route, the natural product deoxyvasicinone and related compounds were prepared.",

    "24": "Ten healthy volunteers received 500 mg oral clarithromycin twice a day for 7 days. Before and after administration of clarithromycin, small-bowel mucosal biopsy specimens were obtained endoscopically. Intestinal CYP3A activity was determined from the rate of 1'-hydroxymidazolam and 4-hydroxymidazolam formation by incubation of small-bowel homogenate with midazolam (25 micromol/L) and NADPH for 5 minutes. Intestinal CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 messenger ribonucleic acid was quantified by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Intestinal CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 protein concentrations were determined by immunoblotting.

All subjects had detectable serum clarithromycin concentrations after 7 days of clarithromycin (3.71 +/- 2.43 micromol/L). The mean concentration of clarithromycin in the intestinal biopsy homogenate was 1.2 +/- 0.7 nmol/L (range, 0.42-2.39 nmol/L). Compared with CYP3A5 nonexpressers, subjects with at least 1 CYP3A5*1 allele (CYP3A5 expressers) had greater inhibition of intestinal CYP3A activity after treatment with clarithromycin. There was a strong linear relationship between the decrease in intestinal CYP3A activity and baseline catalytic activity (R(2) = 0.9).",

    "27": "Atypical antipsychotics have been linked to weight gain, hyperglycemia, and diabetes. We examined the effects of atypical antipsychotics olanzapine (OLZ) and risperidone (RIS) versus placebo on adiposity, insulin sensitivity (S(I)), and pancreatic beta-cell compensation. Dogs were fed ad libitum and given OLZ (15 mg/day; n = 10), RIS (5 mg/day; n = 10), or gelatin capsules (n = 6) for 4-6 weeks. OLZ resulted in substantial increases in adiposity: increased total body fat (+91 +/- 20%; P = 0.000001) reflecting marked increases in subcutaneous (+106 +/- 24%; P = 0.0001) and visceral (+84 +/- 22%; P = 0.000001) adipose stores. Changes in adiposity with RIS were not different from that observed in the placebo group (P > 0.33).

OLZ-induced beta-cell dysfunction was further demonstrated when beta-cell compensation was compared with a group of animals with adiposity and insulin resistance induced by moderate fat feeding alone (+8% of calories from fat; n = 6). These results may explain the diabetogenic effects of atypical antipsychotics and suggest that beta-cell compensation is under neural control.",

Clinical examination revealed truncal flexion from contraction of the rectus abdominis, with no involvement of limbs or face and no jerking in sleep. He was biochemically thyrotoxic. Treatment with clonazepam and propylthiouracil resulted in resolution of the myoclonic jerks within the next 3 weeks. He stopped taking clonazepam within the next 3 months with no recurrence of myoclonus. He remained well until he stopped taking his antithyroid medications 9 months later, when he developed spasmodic truncal jerking again. Biochemical tests confirmed that he was hyperthyroid at this time. These movements ceased within a month of compliance with antithyroid therapy, and he has been well since. MRI of the brain and thoracic spine were unremarkable. Thyrotoxicosis is known to cause chorea and tremors, and has rarely been described in association with myoclonus.",

Sensitivity, repeatability, retention times and stability of the derivatives, as well as specificity of mass fragmentation, were studied in detail. Also other parameters affecting the derivatization chemistry of benzodiazepines are discussed. tert-Butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) derivatives proved to be more stable, reproducible and sensitive than corresponding trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives for the GC-EI-MS analysis of benzodiazepines. Based on the TBDMS derivatives, a rapid, reliable, sensitive and quantitative GC-MS method was developed for the determination of 14 benzodiazepines and two hydroxy metabolites, as well as two non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agents, zolpidem and zaleplon, using 50 microl of whole blood. The method was completely validated in terms of accuracy, intra- and interday precision, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantitation (LOQ), linearity, selectivity and extraction efficiency; these were all within the required limits, except for the accuracy of nitrazepam at a medium concentration level.",

Some possible explanations to the occurrence of this phenomenon (one-trial tolerance-OTT) involve behavioral modifications thought to be consequence of some kind of learning in the first trial. In the present study, the influence of learning-impairing situations on the effects of the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide on mice re-tested in the EPM is investigated. The results showed that: (1) as expected, the administration of chlordiazepoxide to mice re-tested in the EPM- under the same conditions of the first trial- failed to induce anxiolysis; (2) a decreased percent time in the open arms was observed on the second trial of mice exposed to both trials under the same experimental conditions; (3) neither the increase in open arm avoidance by mice re-exposed to the EPM nor the OTT to chlordiazepoxide effect were modified by administration of the amnestic agent scopolamine; (4) the decrement of the duration of the first trial to 1 min or the change in light and noise conditions in both trials counteracted the increase in open arm avoidance on trial 2; (5) none of the later procedures modified the phenomenon of OTT. Although not discarding the modulation exerted by other memory processes in the OTT phenomenon, the results indicate that situations that impair the learned avoidance response to the open arms in the EPM do not modify the phenomenon of OTT.",

The first step in providing an effective intervention among many regular amphetamine users, particularly those attending non-treatment settings, may include provision of: a structured assessment of amphetamine use and related problems; self-help material; and regular monitoring of amphetamine use and related harms. Regular amphetamine users who present to treatment settings could be offered two sessions of CBT, while people with moderate to severe levels of depression may best be offered four sessions of CBT for amphetamine use from the outset, with further treatment for amphetamine use and/or depression depending on response. Pharmacotherapy and/or longer-term psychotherapy may be suitable for non-responders. An RCT of a stepped-care approach among regular amphetamine users is suggested.", 
    "38": "Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterised by at least 6 months of excessive uncontrollable worry accompanied by symptoms of motor tension and vigilance and scanning. As with other anxiety disorders, GAD is less prevalent in older adults than younger adults. GAD has a high level of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders and this has a bearing on estimates of its prevalence. GAD that is comorbid with another psychiatric disorder has a period prevalence of approximately 4% in community-dwelling older people. On the other hand, 'pure' GAD is less common, with a period prevalence of approximately 1%. Pure GAD in late life is a fairly even mix of chronic cases that began earlier in life and cases starting for the first time in later life. The most frequent and consistent finding regarding late-life generalised anxiety is its high level of comorbidity with major depression. There are few longitudinal data pertaining to the temporal association of generalised anxiety and major depression in late life, but the data that do exist suggest that the anxiety is frequently symptomatic of the depression. If generalised anxiety occurs exclusively during episodes of major depression, a separate diagnosis of GAD is not warranted. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is the most frequently studied psychological treatment for GAD. Although CBT is more effective than a wait-list control condition, it is not more effective than nondirective therapies in late-life GAD. Furthermore, a standard course of CBT appears to be less efficacious for GAD in older adults than younger adults. Further research is needed to develop more efficacious and specific forms of psychotherapy for late-life GAD. The three classes of medications that are most commonly used for GAD are: (i) antidepressants; (ii) benzodiazepines; and (iii) buspirone. Antidepressant medication is the pharmacological treatment of choice for most older adults with generalised anxiety. When generalised anxiety is secondary to an episode of major depression, the selection of an antidepressant is guided by the same principles that apply to treatment of nonanxious depression. Antidepressant medication is also effective for GAD in the absence of an episode of major depression. In this situation, citalopram and venlafaxine have been found to be efficacious in older people. Data from studies of mixed-aged patients suggest that escitalopram, paroxetine and trazodone may also be beneficial in late-life GAD. Despite their widespread use in older persons with anxiety, benzodiazepines have a limited role in the treatment of GAD in the elderly. If a benzodiazepine is initiated, pharmacokinetic considerations favour the use of either lorazepam or oxazepam. Buspirone also has a more limited role than antidepressants in the treatment of late-life GAD.", 
    "39": "The efficacies and ease of administration of four oral preanesthetic sedation protocols were compared in 18 adult, male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) to achieve heavy sedation and alleviate anxiety, agitation, and potential trauma associated with remote anesthesia induction. The macaques, with average age and weight of 10 yr and 12.5 kg, respectively, were randomly assigned to one of four groups. Group 1 was given 10 mg/kg tiletaminezolazepam and 0.05 mg/kg medetomidine p.o., group 2 was given 1 mg/kg midazolam and 20 mg/kg ketamine p.o., group 3 was given 20 mg/kg ketamine and 0.05 mg/kg medetomidine p.o., and group 4 was given 3 mg/kg midazolam p.o. All protocols produced effects ranging from mild sedation to no response to noxious stimuli, depending on the success of administration. The mean interval to peak effect was 27-43 min in all groups. Ketamine and medetomidine provided significantly better sedation than midazolam alone; there were no other statistically significant differences among the four protocols. Oral tiletamine-zolazepam and medetomidine provided smooth, mild to moderate sedation with few side effects. The midazolam and ketamine combination resulted in severe ataxia. Orally administered ketamine and medetomidine provided smooth, easily reversible, heavy sedation leading to no response to noxious stimuli. Midazolam alone provided only mild sedation. No statistically significant differences in palatability of the four protocols were identified. Orally administered ketamine and medetomidine (group 3) provided the most consistently heavy sedation. A compounding pharmacy may be able to increase the palatability and level of acceptance of these combinations. Alternatively, oral midazolam syrup is well accepted by some animals and provides a mild sedative and calming effect, which may decrease stress associated with the induction of anesthesia via darting, pole syringes, etc.", 
    "40": "We hypothesize that ovarian hormones may improve serotonin neuron survival. We sought the effect of estradiol (E) and progesterone (P) on novel gene expression in the macaque dorsal raphe region with Affymetrix array analysis. Nine spayed rhesus macaques were treated with either placebo, E or E+P via Silastic implant for 1 month prior to euthanasia (n=3 per treatment). RNA was extracted from a small block of midbrain containing the dorsal raphe and examined on an Agilent Bioanalyzer. The RNA from each monkey was labeled and hybridized to an Affymetrix HG_U95AV Human GeneChip Array. After filtering and sorting, 25 named genes remained that were regulated by E, and 24 named genes remained that were regulated by supplemental P. These genes further sorted into functional categories that would promote neuronal plasticity, transmitter synthesis, and trafficking, as well as reduce apoptosis. The relative abundance of four pivotal genes was examined in all nine animals with quantitative RT-PCR and normalized by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). E+/-P caused a significant threefold reduction in JNK-1 (a pro-apoptosis gene, p<0.007); and a significant sixfold decrease in kynurenine mono-oxygenase (produces neurotoxic quinolones, p<0.05). GABA-A receptor (alpha3 subunit; benzodiazepine site) and E2F1 (interferes with cytokine signaling) were unaffected by E, but increased sevenfold (p<0.02) and fourfold (p<0.009), respectively, upon treatment with P. In summary, subsets of genes related to tissue remodeling or apoptosis were up- or down-regulated by E and P in a tissue block containing the dorsal raphe. These changes could promote cellular resilience in the region where serotonin neurons originate.", 
    "41": "Midazolam and propofol often provoke retrograde amnesia after recovery from anesthesia in humans. Because an increase in central serotonergic activity impairs learning and memory, the authors examined the relation between changes in the serotonergic activity caused by intravenous anesthetics and memory.", 
    "42": "Changes in extracellular concentrations of monoamines and their metabolites were investigated in rat striatum by a microdialysis procedure, and the effects of intraperitoneal injections of midazolam (5 mg/kg), propofol (60 mg/kg), and pentobarbital (15 mg/kg) were then examined. To evaluate the behavioral alteration with these agents, the authors used a step-through passive avoidance test.", 
    "43": "Midazolam and propofol slightly increased the extracellular concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the striatum, although pentobarbital did not produce any changes. Midazolam and propofol increased the extracellular concentration of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, a metabolite of 5-hydroxytryptamine, with the peak values each 138% and 138% of that in saline-injected animals, respectively. However, pentobarbital decreased the 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentration to 61% of that in the saline group. Administration of midazolam or propofol immediately after the completing the passive avoidance learning reduced step-through latencies after 24 h, although pentobarbital-injected animals maintained a consistent performance. The effects of midazolam and propofol on step-through latencies were completely antagonized by intracerebroventricular administration of spiroxatrine (5 microg), a 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A antagonist, 30 min before training.", 
    "44": "Midazolam and propofol increased central serotonergic activity and provoked retrograde amnesia. Because amnesia was completely diminished by a 5-hydroxytryptamine antagonist, facilitation of the serotonergic system may be involved in retrograde amnesia caused by these agents.", 
    "45": "Recent molecular strategies demonstrated that the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is a major target site of anesthetic agents. In a previous article, the authors showed that knocking out the NMDA receptor epsilon1 subunit gene markedly reduced the hypnotic effect of ketamine in mice. In the current study, the authors examined the in vivo contribution of the NMDA receptor epsilon1 subunit to the action of other anesthetic drugs.", 
    "46": "The authors determined the anesthetic effects of nitrous oxide on sevoflurane potency in NMDA receptor epsilon1 subunit knockout mice compared with those in wild-type mice. They then tested the hypnotic effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated agents, such as propofol, pentobarbital, diazepam, and midazolam, in knockout mice and wild-type mice.", 
    "47": "The anesthetic action of sevoflurane itself was unaffected by the abrogation of the NMDA receptor epsilon1 subunit. Adding nitrous oxide reduced the required concentration of sevoflurane to induce anesthesia in wild-type mice, whereas this sparing effect was diminished in knockout mice. Furthermore, propofol, pentobarbital, diazepam, and midazolam also had markedly attenuated effects in knockout mice.", 
    "48": "Although it has been demonstrated that knocking out the expression of receptors may induce changes in the composition of the subunits, the network circuitry, or both, the current findings show consistently that the NMDA receptor epsilon1 subunit mediates nitrous oxide but not sevoflurane anesthesia. Furthermore, the attenuated anesthetic impact of propofol, pentobarbital, diazepam, and midazolam as well as ketamine in knockout mice suggests that the NMDA receptor epsilon1 subunit could be indirectly involved in the hypnotic action of these drugs in vivo.", 
    "49": "Brief periods of handling during the neonatal period have been shown to have profound and long-lasting physiological consequences. Previous studies performed in our laboratory have demonstrated that handling the pups during the neonatal period leads to increased sweet food ingestion in adult life. The objective of this study is to verify if this effect could be explained by the enhanced anxiety levels in these animals. Litters were divided in: (1) intact; (2) handled (10 min in an incubator/day) and (3) handled + tactile stimulation (10 min/day). Procedures were performed on days 1-10 after birth. When adults, rats were tested in the elevated plus maze apparatus, light dark exploration test and open field test. They were also tested for sweet food ingestion, being injected with 2 mg/kg diazepam or vehicle 60 min before the test. Handling and handling + tactile stimulation do not alter performance in the plus maze test, but handled rats presented more crossings in the light/dark exploration test and open field (two-way ANOVA). Females also spent more % time in the open arms in the plus maze and more time in the lit compartment in the light/dark test, presenting more crossings in both tests. Both treated rats (handled and handled + tactile stimulation groups) consumed more sweet food than intact ones (two-way ANOVA). When diazepam was injected prior to the measurement of sweet food ingestion, there was no effect of the drug. We suggest that handling during the neonatal period leads to plastic alterations in the central nervous system of these animals, causing an increased ingestion of palatable food in adult life, and this alteration does not express an anxiety-like behavior.", 
    "50": "Rodent seizure models have significantly contributed to our basic understanding of epilepsy. However, medically intractable forms of epilepsy persist and the fundamental mechanisms underlying this disease remain unclear. Here we show that seizures can be elicited in a simple vertebrate system e.g. zebrafish larvae (Danio rerio). Exposure to a common convulsant agent (pentylenetetrazole, PTZ) induced a stereotyped and concentration-dependent sequence of behavioral changes culminating in clonus-like convulsions. Extracellular recordings from fish optic tectum revealed ictal and interictal-like electrographic discharges after application of PTZ, which could be blocked by tetrodotoxin or glutamate receptor antagonists. Epileptiform discharges were suppressed by commonly used antiepileptic drugs, valproate and diazepam, in a concentration-dependent manner. Up-regulation of c-fos expression was also observed in CNS structures of zebrafish exposed to PTZ. Taken together, these results demonstrate that chemically-induced seizures in zebrafish exhibit behavioral, electrographic, and molecular changes that would be expected from a rodent seizure model. Therefore, zebrafish larvae represent a powerful new system to study the underlying basis of seizure generation, epilepsy and epileptogenesis.", 
    "51": "The olfactory bulb, first relay of olfactory pathways, is densely innervated by serotoninergic centrifugal fibers originating from the raphe nuclei. Although serotonin innervation was reported to be involved in olfactory learning in mammals, the action of this neurotransmitter on its putative cellular targets has been never described through unitary recordings. This lack of data initiated the present study where the effects of 5HT on juxtaglomerular and mitral cells are analyzed using whole-cell recordings on olfactory bulb slices. Serotonin depolarizes 34% of 525 JG cells. A multivariate statistical analysis of juxtaglomerular cells characteristics shows that the serotonin responsive cell group can be individualized regarding their tonic discharge-mode in response to a direct current injection, their lower expression of hyperpolarization-activated cation current and their low membrane capacities. The use of ion channel blockers and ramp voltage protocol indicate that serotoninergic depolarization of juxtaglomerular cells may be due to a nonselective cation current with a reversal potential of -44 mV. Pharmacological tests with serotonin receptor antagonists and agonists reveal that 5HT action on juxtaglomerular cells would be mainly mediated by 5HT2C receptors. In mitral cells, serotonin acts on 49.1% of the 242 tested cells, inducing two types of responses. A first subset of mitral cells (26.8%, n=65) were hyperpolarized by serotonin. This response would be indirect and mediated by action of GABA on GABAA receptors since it was antagonized by bicuculline. The involved GABAergic neurons are hypothesized to be juxtaglomerular and granular cells, on which serotonin would act mainly via 5HT2C and via 5HT2A receptors respectively. The second subset of mitral cells (22.3%, n=54) were directly depolarized by serotonin acting through 5HT2A receptors. Our data on serotonin action on juxtaglomerular cells and mitral cells reveal a part of functional mechanisms whereby serotonin can act on olfactory bulb network. This is expected to enrich the understanding of its determining role in olfactory learning.",

The success of this method depends on formation of conformationally chiral enolates that racemize very slowly under the reaction conditions. As a prelude to undertaking experimental and computational studies on the racemization of these enolates, we have studied the ring-inversion process of the parent 1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones. In this paper, we use dynamic and 2D-EXSY NMR to characterize inversion barriers. Using DFT calculations, we reproduce the experimental results with high accuracy (within 1-2 kcal/mol). Structural parameters obtained from DFT calculations provide valuable insights into the important effect of the N1 substituent on the ring-inversion barrier and shed light on the mechanism of the memory of chirality method. These measurements and calculations provide a foundation for future studies of benzodiazepine enolates and will be valuable in the design of new memory of chirality reactions.",

A retrospective cohort chart review was performed of 191 randomly selected patients who were being treated with ziprasidone or olanzapine in an integrated health care system. Significant differences on QTc interval were not observed. A significant weight gain was observed in olanzapine-treated patients (P<0.001) but not in the ziprasidone-treated cohort (P>0.05). Furthermore, adverse metabolic changes associated with olanzapine administration were significant with respect to effects on total cholesterol (P=0.01), triglycerides (P=0.05) and haemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) (P<0.05), whereas significant favourable metabolic effects were observed in ziprasidone-treated patients with regard to total cholesterol (P<0.05), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (P<0.01), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (P<0.05) and HbA1c (P<0.05). Our results suggest that these two atypical antipsychotics are safe and well tolerated from a cardiovascular standpoint, with no differences in QTc interval prolongation being observed. Olanzapine-treated patients exhibited significant weight increases, whereas ziprasidone-treated patients exhibited weight loss. Olanzapine treatment was also associated with significant adverse effect on patient's lipid profile and HbA1c. These adverse metabolic effects were not observed in ziprasidone-treated patients although favourable effects were observed with regard to effect on total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and HbA1c.",

Betahistine, a histamine enhancer with H1 agonistic/H3 antagonistic properties (48 mg t.i.d.), was coadministered with olanzapine (10 mg/day) in three first-episode schizophrenia patients for 6 weeks. Body weight was measured at baseline and weekly thereafter. Clinical rating scales were completed at baseline and at week 6. All participants gained weight (mean weight gain 3.1+/-0.9 kg) and a similar pattern of weight gain was observed: an increase during the first 2 weeks and no additional weight gain (two patients) or minor weight loss (one patient) from weeks 3 to 6. None gained 7% of baseline weight, which is the cut-off for clinically significant weight gain. Betahistine was safe and well tolerated and did not interfere with the antipsychotic effect of olanzapine. Our findings justify a placebo-controlled evaluation of the putative weight-attenuating effect of betahistine in olanzapine-induced weight gain.",

    "72": "Asymmetrical generalization between drugs on drug-discrimination procedures has been demonstrated for sedative and stimulant drugs in animals and to some extent with sedative drugs in humans. The aim of this experiment was to examine the discriminative-stimulus effects of d-amphetamine in methylphenidate-trained humans. A previous study demonstrated that methylphenidate substitutes for d-amphetamine in d-amphetamine-trained humans. Six healthy human participants first learned to discriminate 30 mg oral methylphenidate. Doses of oral methylphenidate, d-amphetamine, triazolam, and placebo were then tested to determine whether they share discriminative-stimulus and self-reported effects with 30 mg methylphenidate. Methylphenidate and d-amphetamine dose-dependently increased methylphenidate-appropriate responding and produced prototypical stimulant-like effects. Triazolam produced low levels of methylphenidate-appropriate responding and prototypical sedative-like effects. The results of this experiment are concordant with previous studies and suggest that the behavioral effects of oral methylphenidate and d-amphetamine overlap extensively and that the discriminative-stimulus effects of methylphenidate and d-amphetamine are symmetrical.",

    "74": "Clinical and experimental data indicate that epilepsy may lead to neuronal death and lesions placed in diverse brain regions. Also, the anticonvulsant activity of some antiepileptic drugs can be impaired in case of neurodegeneration in the brain. The main aim of this review is making a reader familiar with a patomechanism of neurodegeneration as well as the current data concerning the neuro-protective potential of antiepileptic drugs. It is noteworthy that a great number of papers devoted to this problem concern animal models of neurodegeneration produced by either seizure activity or ischemia. Interestingly, there are apparent differences in the direct central effects of antiepileptic drugs in adult and young animals. Majority of antiepileptics at anticonvulsant doses produce massive apoptosis in brains of young rodents, this effect being not present in adult animals. Only topiramate required higher than anticonvulsant doses to induce apoptotic response. Neuroprotective activity in models of ischemia and epilepsy was evident for benzodiazepines (diazepam), lamotrigine, tiagabine, topiramate, and vigabatrin. Recently, topiramate has been documented to exert potent neuroprotective action in human oligodendrocytes exposed to hypoxic-ischemic damage.", 
    "75": "Repeated withdrawals from chronic ethanol induce a persistent adaptive change. Further, stress substitutes for the initial two withdrawals of a multiple-withdrawal protocol to sensitize rats to withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior ('anxiety'). Therefore, it was tested whether the persistent adaptation induced by multiple-withdrawal exposures allows stress to elicit anxiety after a period of abstinence. Social interaction was used to assess the degree of anxiety induced by 45 min of restraint stress 3, 7, or 14 days after rats were exposed to multiple withdrawals from a chronic 4.5% ethanol diet. Restraint stress reduced social interaction (ie anxiety-like behavior) at 3, but not at 7 or 14 days, after the multiple withdrawals. No anxiety response was observed in animals that received multiple withdrawals without stress or in animals that received stress when exposed only to control liquid diet. Drugs (ie a CRF1-receptor antagonist, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, and a 5-HT1A-receptor agonist) previously demonstrated to block the cumulative adaptation, when administered during repeated withdrawals, prevented stress-induced anxiety-like behavior during abstinence. Additionally, these drugs applied prior to stress in the rats previously exposed to the repeated withdrawal protocol, likewise, minimized stress-induced anxiety. The anxiety following stress during abstinence from previous chronic ethanol exposure is indicative of an interaction of stress with the persistent adaptive change caused by repeated withdrawals. Stress eliciting anxiety-like behavior during abstinence from previous ethanol exposures in rats is consistent with stress inducing anxiety during recovery (sobriety) in the alcoholic, a circumstance that can facilitate craving and relapse.",

Only rare fatalities have been attributed to alprazolam alone. We undertook a retrospective review of cases investigated by the Palm Beach County Medical Examiner's Office in which postmortem toxicologic studies indicated the presence of alprazolam, to further study the pattern of alprazolam abuse. Our review consisted of 178 cases, including 87 in which death was attributed to combined drug toxicity, 2 to alprazolam toxicity alone, 44 to trauma, 12 to natural causes, and 33 to another drug or drugs. Cocaine and methadone were the most common cointoxicants in the cases of combined drug toxicity, while heroin was less frequently detected. There was considerable overlap in the postmortem blood alprazolam concentrations among the groups. The overlapping ranges of concentrations of alprazolam detected indicate that it may be difficult to define a lethal alprazolam range, and that it may not be possible to determine the actual role of alprazolam as a causal factor in cases of combined drug toxicity. This study confirms that alprazolam alone is rarely a cause of death, and that alprazolam abuse usually occurs within a polydrug use pattern. The high incidence of cocaine as a cointoxicant has not been previously reported.", 
    "81": "Diazepam is a benzodiazepine with anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, sedative and muscle-relaxing properties. Many aspects of its toxicity have been investigated, including genotoxic and carcinogenic effects in various model systems. However, it is still unclear whether diazepam is in fact a genotoxic agent. Propofol is a rapid-onset, short-acting intravenous anesthetic agent. It is used widely for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia as well as for long-term sedation in intensive care units. There is limited information in the literature on its genotoxic effects. Both drugs are commonly used as anesthetic in patients undergoing open-heart surgery. Therefore, we investigated the possible genotoxic effects of propofol and diazepam in those patients, using a chromosomal aberration (CA) assay. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 45 patients before induction of anesthesia and at the end of the anesthesia with diazepam or propofol. In Group I (n=24), anesthesia was induced with 0.2 mg kg(-1) diazepam and 10 microg kg(-1) fentanyl. In Group II (n=21), anesthesia was induced with 1 mg kg(-1) propofol and 10 microg kg(-1) fentanyl. Pancuronium bromide (0.1 mg kg(-1)) was administered for skeletal muscle relaxation in both groups. Anesthesia was maintained by diazepam administration at 5 mg kg(-1) in Group I or by continuous propofol administration at 2-4 mg (kg h)(-1) in Group II. All patients received 0.02 mg kg(-1) pancuronium and 5 microg kg(-1) fentanyl boluses at 30-40 min intervals for anesthesia maintenance. Body temperature was controlled during bypass in the two groups. We found that the mean frequency of CAs in both groups before and at the end of the anesthesia were not statistically significantly different. Our analysis also indicated that age, smoking habit and gender were not confounding factors. In conclusion, our results indicate that diazepam and propofol do not exert genotoxic effects in blood cells during open-heart surgery.",

Following the failure of other agents (chloral hydrate and/or midazolam), dexmedetomidine was administered as a loading dose of 0.3-1.0 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) over 5-10 min followed by an infusion of 0.5-1.0 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1). The dexmedetomidine loading dose required to induce sedation was 0.78 +/- 0.42 microg x kg(-1) (range 0.3-1.2). The maintenance infusion rate was 0.57 +/- 0.06 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1) (range 0.48-0.69). The imaging procedures were completed without difficulty. No patient required additional bolus administrations or changes in the infusion rate. The duration of the dexmedetomidine infusion ranged from 30 to 50 min. The mean decrease in heart rate was 13.6 +/- 5.1 b x min(-1) (14.3 +/- 5.0% from baseline; P = 0.02), the mean decrease in systolic blood pressure was 26.4 +/- 15.2 mmHg (24.6 +/- 12.4% decrease from baseline; P = 0.004), and the mean decrease in respiratory rate was 1.4 +/- 1.5 min(-1) (7.5 +/- 7.9% decrease from baseline; P = NS). P(E)CO2 exceeded 6.5 kPa (50 mmHg) in one patient [maximum 6.6 kPa (51 mmHg)] with a maximum value of 6.0 +/- 0.4 kPa (46 +/- 3 mmHg). Oxygen saturation decreased from 98 +/- 1 to 95 +/- 1%; P = 0.001. No patient developed hypoxemia (oxygen saturation less than 90%). Mean time to recovery to baseline status was 112.5 +/- 50.6 min and time to discharge was 173.8 +/- 83.8 min.",

The nicotine dependence was assessed by the Fagerstrom test, initially and after 28 days of magnesium intake. Plasmatic magnesium level was determined before any therapy and at 28 days. All patients received benzodiazepines during the trial. Our data show that patients that received magnesium therapy showed a significant decrease in the number of cigarettes smoked and Fagerstrom test after 4 weeks [Fagerstrom score 7.93 +/- 0.17 before magnesium therapy versus 6.78 +/- 0.18 (P < 0.05) after 28 days of magnesium therapy]. In the group of smokers who did not receive magnesium, the Fagerstrom score did not change significantly [Fagerstrom score 7.48 +/- 0.22 initial versus 7.24 +/- 0.19 after 28 days]. Magnesium supplementation raised plasmatic levels (17.2 +/- 1.2 mg/L before versus 26.1 +/- 1.6 mg/L after 28 days of magnesium intake, P < 0.01). The results suggest that this cation might be a useful adjuvant in treatment of nicotine pharmacodependence.",

Since the poisoning crimes in 1998, such as the curry poisoning with arsenic in Wakayama, the sodium azide poisoning in Niigata, and the potassium cyanide poisoning in Nagano, we have introduced methods for rapid qualitative analysis of arsenic compounds, cyanides and azides, and developed methods for qualitative analysis of three types of surfactants (cationic, anionic, and nonionic) on the basis of the statistics for intoxication patients transferred to the Center. In 1999, the Analysis Method Investigation Committee of the Japanese Society for Clinical Toxicology requested individual medical institutions to analyze 15 selected intoxicating substances, focusing on the following three aspects. 1. Intoxication with a high degree of fatality. 2. Intoxication where analysis plays an immediate role in treatment. 3. Intoxication with a high frequency of requests by clinical physicians for analysis. The selected substances included methanol, barbital drugs, benzodiazepines, tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants, methamphetamine, acetaminophen, salicylic acid, bromovalerylurea, organophosphorus pesticides, carbamate pesticides, paraquat, glufosinate, cyanides, arsenic, and theophylline. Responding to the Committee's request, out laboratory has been making efforts so that analysis of drugs and intoxicating substances can play an immediate role in emergency medical service, giving the highest priority to the aforementioned 15 substances. As a result, anyone of us can now rapidly analyze about 35 substances, including those listed by the Society, day and night.", 
    "92": "The effects of anxiogenic (pentylentetrazole) and anxiolytic (diazepam) agents on <behavioral despair> and cold swim stress-induced analgesia were investigated in SHR and NMRI male mice. It was shown that behavioral response to acute stress was associated with a change in the pain tolerance threshold. Diazepam increased immobility time and attenuated stress-induced analgesia (SIA). NMRI mice were more responsive to anxiolytic than the SHR mice, but the lattes manifested more dramatic changes when anxiety was pharmacologically enhanced (immobility time was significantly reduced and the SIA exaggerated). Our findings suggest that the main parameters change in reciprocal manner following a pharmacologically altered anxiety, and reveal that differences between two strains of mice are determined by differences in their sensitivity to stress.",

The instrumental response automation effect could be obtained at once following a bilateral microinjection of carbacholine into the neostriatum. The same albeit a weaker effect could be obtained with bilateral microinjections of D2 Dopamine receptor blocking agent Raclopride into the neostriatum. Bilateral injections of Pyrenzepine yield an opposite result: an increase in the physical component of the response < a disorder in the diagonal pattern of posture readjustment, and a diffuse nature of projection of the mass centre position of anterior paws on tensoplatforms. Indirect efferent output of the neostriatum seems to play an important role in motor instrumental reflex as well as in the process of automation of the motor skill.",

They clearly demonstrate the efficacy of temazepam, and may give patients additional confidence to discontinue regular hypnotic use. The value of N-of-1 trials for patients who are less motivated is unclear, as the size of treatment effect does not seem to influence future hypnotic use.", 
    "99": "A straightforward method for the preparation of no-carrier-added (n.c.a.) [18F]flumazenil via standard nucleophilic radiofluorination of the corresponding nitro-analog Ro 15-2344 has been developed. The labeling was performed by employing the K18F/kryptofix complex in DMF at 160 degrees C for 30 min and equimolar ratio [K/K2.2.2]+18F-/precursor. Under these conditions, an 18F incorporation rate into flumazenil was in the range of 55-60%. The final product was isolated by HPLC purification within a total synthesis time of 75 min and a radiochemical yield of about 30% (EOB). Human post-mortem whole-hemisphere autoradiography of brain sections demonstrated selective uptake of the radioligand in the areas of high density of the central benzodiazepine receptors (BZR). PET studies in a cynomolgus monkey and metabolite studies by HPLC demonstrated similar results by [18F]flumazenil as for [11C]flumazenil. In blocking experiments, almost all radioactivity was inhibited by the addition of unlabeled flumazenil. [18F]Flumazenil is a suitable radioligand for PET assessment of the BZR.",

Further, coherence in cross-spectra presented depression in the LF band area after sedation with propofol. Before the end of surgery with sedation, LF and LF/HF in both HRV and SAPV were correlated with age in those with propofol; however, scarce relation was observed in those who received midazolam.",

However, the effects of phosphorylation have been inconsistent, possibly due to variability in neuron or GABAR populations. We used NT2-N neurons to address this issue in a more homogeneous cell population. Whole-cell and gramicidin \"perforated-patch\" recordings were used to analyze changes in GABAR currents induced by preincubation with 4beta-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), the inactive 4alpha-phorbol-didecanoate (4alpha-PDD) or bisindolylmaleimide (BIM, a PKC inhibitor). PDBu, but not 4alpha-PDD, caused a rightward shift of the concentration-response curve (C/R) for diazepam enhancement, without affecting maximal enhancement. BIM blocked the rightward shift of the diazepam C/R induced by PDBu. PDBu did not alter the GABA C/R or the current reversal potential. The PKC effect was specific to the benzodiazepine site, as PDBu did not alter potentiation of GABAR currents by pentobarbital. Exposure to diazepam (10 microM) for 7 days reduced maximal diazepam enhancement without affecting the EC(50); PDBu also caused a small rightward shift of the diazepam EC(50) in these cells. PKC activation reduced the apparent affinity of diazepam at NT2-N GABARs without altering maximal enhancement, suggesting decreased allosteric coupling of the benzodiazepine and GABA sites.",

Diazepam was used as a reference compound. CP 94253 (2.5 mg kg(-1)), SB 216641 (2.5 mg kg(-1)), GR 127935 (10 mg kg(-1)) and diazepam (5 mg kg(-1)) significantly increased the number of shocks accepted during experimental sessions in the conflict drinking test in vehicle- and p-CA-pretreated rats. Flumazenil did not change the anxiolytic-like effect of CP 94253 (2.5 mg kg(-1)), but wholly blocked the anxiolytic-like effects of SB 216641 (2.5 mg kg(-1)), GR 127935 (10 mg kg(-1)) and diazepam (5 mg kg(-1)). p-CA and flumazenil alone were inactive in the conflict drinking test. The results suggested that the anxiolytic-like effect of the 5-HT1B receptor ligands CP 94253, SB 216641 and GR 127935 was possibly linked to the postsynaptic 5-HT1B receptors or/and 5-HT1B heteroreceptors. The results suggested also that benzodiazepine receptors were indirectly involved in the effects of SB 216641 and GR 127935 (but not of CP 94253), which might have been due to a possible interaction between the 5-HT and the GABA/benzodiazepine systems.", 
    "110": "In this early phase of the new era of molecularly targeted patient friendly cancer chemotherapy, there is a need for novel viable anticancer molecular targets. The MDM2 oncoprotein has been validated as a potential target for cancer drug development. MDM2 amplification and/or overexpression occur in a wide variety of human cancers, several of which can be treated experimentally with MDM2 antagonists. MDM2 interacts primarily with the p53 tumor suppressor protein in an autoregulatory negative feedback loop to attenuate p53's cell cycle arrest and apoptosis functions. Inhibition of the p53-MDM2 interaction has been shown to cause selective cancer cell death, as well as sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy or radiation effects. Consequently, this interaction has been the main focus of anticancer drug discovery targeted to MDM2. The promotion of the proteasomal degradation of the p53 protein by MDM2 is central to its repression of the tumor suppressor functions of p53, and many proteins impinge upon this activity, either enhancing or inhibiting it. MDM2 also has oncogenic activity independent of its interaction with p53, but this has so far not been explored for drug discovery. Among the approaches for targeting MDM2 for cancer therapy, small molecule antagonists have recently featured as effective anticancer agents in experimental models, although the repertoire is currently limited and none has yet entered human clinical trials. Small molecules that have been reported to disrupt the p53-MDM2 binding, thereby enhancing p53 activity to elicit anticancer effects include the following: synthetic chalcones, norbornane derivatives, cis-imidazoline derivatives (Nutlins), a pyrazolidinedione sulfonamide and 1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5-diones, as well as tryptophan derivatives. In addition to compounds disrupting p53pMDM2 binding, three compounds have been discovered that are effective in inhibiting the E3 ligase activity of MDM2 towards p53, and should serve as leads for drug discovery targeting this aspect of the p53-MDM2 interaction as well. These compounds were discovered from library screening and/or structure-based rational drug design strategies.",

The influence of flumazenil (10.0 mg/kg) and beta-CCt (30.0 mg/kg) on the effects of the two agonists were also examined. In the schedule 2 x 30 trials, drugs were administered i.p. 20 min before the training session. Avoidance responses in the training session are an anxiety-mediated behavior, whereas performance in the retention session relates to the effects on memory.",

Flumazenil antagonized both effects. Beta-CCt potentiated the effect of midazolam, and partly antagonized the effect of DMCM. Midazolam (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) and zolpidem (1.0-3.0 mg/kg) impaired, while DMCM (0.1 mg/kg) facilitated the subjects' performance in the retention test. The amnesic effects were attenuated but not fully reversed, while the effect of DMCM was counteracted by both antagonists.",

Uric acid (UA) at the lower dose (3.75%) lacked an effect on burying behaviour but significantly increased the time spent and number of entries to the open arms; the higher UA dose (7.5%) produced a significant increase in the time spent and number of entries to the open arms and a statistically significant reduction in cumulative burying. Diazepam and buspirone produced a clear dose-dependent reduction in cumulative burying. In the plus maze, diazepam also induced an increase in the time spent and number of entries to the open arms. In the burying behaviour test, rats with a mild level of nociception (uric acid at 7.5%) were insensitive to the anxiolytic-like effect of these anxiolytic drugs.

Little is known about the effects of GABA on the cholinergic activity in the human central nervous system. In vivo evaluation of some cholinergic circuits of the human brain has recently been introduced using a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol based on coupling peripheral nerve stimulation with TMS of the motor cortex. Peripheral nerve inputs have an inhibitory effect on motor cortex excitability at short intervals (short latency afferent inhibition, SAI). We investigated whether GABA(A) activity enhancement by lorazepam modifies SAI. We also evaluated the effects produced by lorazepam on a different TMS protocol of cortical inhibition, the short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), which is believed to be directly related to GABA(A) activity. In 10 healthy volunteers, the effects of lorazepam were compared with those produced by quetiapine, a psychotropic drug with sedative effects with no appreciable affinity at cholinergic muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors, and with those of a placebo using a randomized double-blind study design. Administration of lorazepam produced a significant increase in SICI (F(3,9) = 3.19, P = 0.039). In contrast to SICI, SAI was significantly reduced by lorazepam (F(3,9) = 9.39, P = 0.0002). Our findings demonstrate that GABA(A) activity enhancement determines a suppression of SAI and an increase of SICI.",

Further, illicit use of psychotropic medicines, and anabolic steroids were also surveyed. This study was carried out in 107 Brazilian cities with more than 200,000 inhabitants aged 12-65 years. The sampling design adopted was that of sampling per aggregates in three stages: first, the census sectors were selected; second, homes were selected among the sectors; finally, in each home, a respondent was selected in a manner independent of the interviewer. There were 8589 persons interviewed. The questionnaire utilized was that of the SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) which was translated and adapted for Brazilian conditions. The lifetime use of alcohol in the 107 major cities of the country was 68.7%, which was close to numbers observed for Chile at 70.8% and the USA at 81.0%. Yet, tobacco lifetime use was 41.1% of the total, which is lower than the prevalence observed in the USA (70.5%). The data on the lifetime use of marijuana in Brazil (6.9%) approximated the findings for Colombia (5.4%), however, being much lower than that observed in the USA (34.2%) and the United Kingdom (25.0%). The prevalence of lifetime use of cocaine was 2.3%, well below the levels for the USA with 11.2% of the total population. The abuse of inhalants was 5.8% of the total, greater than that found in Colombia (1.4%) and about four times less than that in the United Kingdom with 20.0%. Among the medicaments, stimulants had a 1.5% prevalence of lifetime use, and that of benzodiazepines had similar percentages in Brazil (3.3%) and in the USA (5.8%). In this survey, only four individuals reported lifetime use of heroin, which was equivalent to about 0.04% of the sample and much lower than that in the USA with 1.2% and in Colombia reaching 1.5%.

A low dose of AVP has been shown to have a modest, but significant effect on ACTH response in normal weight subjects. The aim of this study was to test the response of the HPA axis in obese subjects in order to assess eventual primary neuroendocrine alterations, previously demonstrated by using AVP combined with corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). In addition, given its central inhibitory action on the HPA axis, we investigated whether the suppressive capacity of alprazolam (APZ) pretreatment on the hormone response to low-dose AVP challenge and daily urinary free cortisol (UFC) excretion rate may be altered in the presence of obesity.",

Overweight/obese women had higher ACTH and cortisol responses to the AVP tests and significantly greater hormone inhibition after APZ than controls. In both groups, AVP-induced delta-peak cortisol values before and after APZ pre-treatment were significantly correlated. Body fat distribution had no effect on the HPA axis response to AVP either before or after APZ. Moreover, APZ decreased 24h-UFC/creatinine values unsignificantly in controls and by approximately 50% in the overweight/obese subjects. These changes were unrelated to the cortisol response to the AVP test before and after APZ pretreatment. On the other hand, percent changes of 24h-UFC/creatinine after APZ were negatively related to the body mass index (BMI) but positively with waist circumference values, which indicates that the abdominal obesity phenotype may counteract the 24 h-UFC/creatinine that would be expected on the basis of BMI values.",

In the present study, impulsive behaviour was punished by an explicitly aversive stimulus, using a novel fixed consecutive number (FCN) schedule of electric shock avoidance.", 
    "142": "This study was conducted to demonstrate stable performance using the FCN avoidance procedure, and examine the effects of drugs previously shown to affect impulsive behaviour using a conventional FCN schedule.", 
    "143": "First, rats were trained in the appetitive FCN procedure. Pressing the right lever in an operant conditioning chamber after having pressed the left lever at least six times delivered a food pellet (FCN6). Responses on the right lever before completing this ratio resulted in a time out and restarted the ratio. The rats were then switched to FCN avoidance. Responses on the right lever made before completion of the ratio also resulted in food delivery, but were accompanied by an electric shock.", 
    "144": "Chlordiazepoxide (10.0 mg/kg), ethanol (1.0 g/kg), and haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg) increased impulsive behaviour by reducing the number of left lever responses made before the right lever was pressed. Imipramine (1.0-10.0 mg/kg) and desipramine (1.0-10.0 mg/kg) had no effect on impulsive choice. Amphetamine (0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg) and methylphenidate (6.0 mg/kg) significantly increased the mean chain length, and the proportion of very long chains, indicative of reduced impulsivity, although this did not improve efficiency.", 
    "145": "The increases in impulsivity produced by chlordiazepoxide, ethanol, and haloperidol were similar to those under appetitive FCN schedules. In contrast, amphetamine and methylphenidate, by reducing impulsivity in the FCN avoidance, induced effects opposite to those observed in an appetitive FCN procedure. These results suggest that the therapeutic actions of stimulants, to reduce impulsive behaviour in ADHD, may arise in part by increasing the control of behaviour by aversive stimuli.",

These symptoms worsen at rest, are relieved by activity, and are worse at night. Previous studies have suggested that dopaminergic drugs such as L-dopa and dopamine agonists, as well as benzodiazepines and opioids, can treat RLS successfully. The purpose of this study was to test the clinical efficacy of ropinirole, a D2/D3 agonist, in the treatment of RLS in a double-blind, short-term, placebo-controlled clinical trial.",

Even if epilepsy cannot be prevented, it would be beneficial if the pathologic process could be modified to result in a less severe disease. We examined whether early discontinuation of SE reduces the risk of epilepsy or results in milder disease. Epileptogenesis was triggered with SE induced by electrical stimulation of the amygdala. Animals (n = 72) were treated with vehicle or diazepam (DZP, 20 mg/kg) 2 h or 3 h after the beginning of SE. Electrode-implanted non-stimulated rats served as controls for histology. All animals underwent continuous long-term video-electroencephalography monitoring 7-9 weeks and 11-15 weeks later to detect the occurrence and severity of spontaneous seizures. As another outcome measure, the severity of hippocampal damage was assessed in histologic sections. In the vehicle group, 94% of animals developed epilepsy. DZP treatment reduced the percentage of epileptic animals to 42% in the 2-h DZP group and to 71% in the 3-h DZP group (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05 compared to the vehicle group, respectively). If epilepsy developed, the seizures were less frequent in DZP-treated animals compared to the vehicle group (median 16.4 seizures/day), particularly in the 2-h DZP group (median 0.4 seizures/day). Finally, if DZP treatment was started 2 h, but not 3 h after SE, the severity of hippocampal cell loss was milder and the density of mossy-fiber sprouting was lower than in the vehicle group. These data indicate that treatment of SE with DZP within 2 h reduces the risk of epilepsy later in life, and if epilepsy develops, it is milder.",

Furthermore, there is a significant discrepancy between the prevalence of mental health disorders and BZD drug use in the elderly population, which can be attributed to a measurement issue. The goal of this cross-sectional descriptive study was to determine the prevalence of mental health disorders among seniors using BZD and living in the community, basing this information on both a thorough face-to-face interview and a pair of self-reported validated instruments. Among the 216 seniors recruited in our study, nearly 20 % were users of BZD and over three quarters of them had been using this drug for more than a year. Thirteen subjects were recognized as depressed according to a self-report measure compared to 18 according to the interview. Likewise, 13 seniors were categorized as anxious, based on a self-report questionnaire compared to 39 based on the interview. Among self-reported measures of mental health variables, logistic regression indicated that insomnia increases by 7 the likelihood of using BZD (odds ratio: 7.2) and is the only statistically significant variable associated with BZD consumption. Based on thorough interviews, logistic regression showed that insomnia (odds ratio: 6.9) is still the dominant symptom associated with BZD drugs. In conclusion, our results clearly support the assertion that mental health status is influenced according to how it is measured. Finally, nurses should be aware that not all individuals are capable of expressing their mental health problems using either psychological or emotional terminologies.

It seems likely that a similar plastic phenomenon may occur on hippocampal formation after chronic (18 days) DZ administration. We postulate hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) underlying substrate to the behavioral alteration observed after chronic DZ administration. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of the serotonergic (5-HT) system in the possible neural circuitry recruited during DZ withdrawal and in the increased hippocampal synaptic plasticity associated with the discontinuation of chronic DZ administration. The results of the current research demonstrate an increased neuronal activity in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) during withdrawal. Previous MK-801 administration impairs the development of anxiety signs observed during withdrawal and the concomitant increased electrical activity on 5-HT neurons on DRN. These results are discussed in terms of the participation of 5-HT system in the modulation of hippocampal plasticity developed on DZ withdrawal.",

Withdrawal symptom intensities demonstrated an inverse correlation with beta-endorphin and met-enkephalin levels, a direct linear correlation with amplitude height of the evoked potential, and blood pressure and heart rate changes. Withdrawal intensities did not correlate with EEG power spectral edge frequency.",

Following sedation, abstinence symptoms seem to be related to postinhibitory increased endorphin synthesis. This is mostly seen in the combination of sufentanil/midazolam.

    "186": "Immobilization stress upregulates c-Fos expression in several CNS areas. Repeated stress or the use of drugs can modulate stress-induced c-Fos expression. Here, we investigated in 40 different areas of the rat brain the effects of dexamethasone (SDX, a synthetic glucocorticoid), diazepam (SBDZ, a benzodiazepine), and imipramine (IMI, an antidepressant) on the c-Fos expression induced by restraint stress. Wistar rats were divided into four groups and submitted to 20 days of daily injection of saline (three first groups) or imipramine, 15 mg/kg, i.p. On day 21, animals were submitted to injections of saline (somatosensory, SS), SDX (1 mg/kg, i.p.), SBDZ (5 mg/kg, i.p.), or IMI (15 mg/kg, i.p.) before being submitted to restraint. Immediately after stress, the animals were perfused and their brains processed with immunohistochemistry for c-Fos (Ab-5 Oncogene Science). Dexamethasone reduced stress-induced c-Fos expression in SS cortex, hippocampus, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), and locus coeruleus (LC), whereas diazepam reduced c-Fos staining in the SS cortex, hippocampus, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, septal area, and hypothalamus (preoptic area and supramammillary nucleus). Chronic administration of imipramine decreased staining in the hippocampus, PVH, and LC, while increasing it in the nucleus raphe pallidus. We conclude that dexamethasone, diazepam and imipramine differentially modulate stress-induced Fos expression. The present study provides an important comparative background that may help in the further understanding of the effects of these compounds and on the brain activation as well as on the behavioral, neuroendocrine, and autonomic responses to stress.",

    "188": "GABA and the GABAA and GABAB receptors play a pivotal role in the coordination of the central vestibular pathways. The commissural inhibition, which exists between the two vestibular nucleus complexes (VNCs) and which is responsible for enhancing the dynamic sensitivity of VNC neurons to head acceleration, is known to be substantially mediated by GABA acting on GABAA and GABAB receptors. After unilateral vestibular deafferentation (UVD), the large asymmetry in spontaneous resting activity between the two VNCs is reinforced and exacerbated by the GABAergic interaction between the ipsilateral and contralateral sides. Although it has been suggested that reduced GABAergic inhibition of the ipsilateral VNC may be partially responsible for the recovery of resting activity that underlies vestibular compensation of the static symptoms of UVD, at present there are few data available to test this hypothesis systematically. There is some evidence that GABA concentrations change in the ipsilateral VNC during the development of compensation; however, it is unclear whether these changes relate to GABA release or to metabolic pools of GABA. Most biochemical studies of GABA receptors have been conducted at the gene expression level. Therefore, it is unclear whether changes in the receptor protein also occur, although the most recent data suggest that changes in GABAA and GABAB receptor density in the VNC are unlikely. The few radioligand binding data relate to GABAA receptors with benzodiazepine binding sites only. A decrease in the sensitivity of ipsilateral VNC neurons from compensated animals to GABA receptor agonists has been reported; however, these studies have employed brainstem slices and therefore the functional identity of the neurons involved has been unclear. Although it seems likely that some changes in central GABAergic systems accompany the recovery of resting activity in the ipsilateral VNC during the development of vestibular compensation, at the present stage there is no compelling evidence that these changes have a causal role in the compensation process.",

This antidote combination is known to have effects on seizures, respiratory system, blood pressure and animal survival in experiments. However, the inflammatory responses following soman-intoxication leading to neuronal damage have not been fully evaluated. In this paper we focus on the cytokine IL-1beta induction in the rat brain after soman-intoxication (1.0 x LD50 and 1.1 x LD50) and during antidote treatment. We analyzed the IL-1beta levels in rat brain to determine the effects of time of antidote HI 6 and atropine; the effects of different combinations of HI 6 and atropine; and also the effects of antidotes diazepam and atropine following soman-intoxication. We observed that the initiation of the antidote combination of HI 6 and atropine following soman-intoxication was crucial for successful treatment. The study also demonstrated that atropine alone was more effective against IL-1beta up-regulation after soman-intoxication within the 2-h time frame, than the combination of the HI 6 and atropine, the therapy of choice in many countries. Furthermore, treatment with a combination of diazepam and atropine maintained IL-1beta levels at normal when administered at the onset of the seizures following soman exposure. Soman-intoxicated groups without seizures did not have an elevated cytokine level. This corroborates our earlier studies where soman-intoxicated animals with seizures had high levels of IL-1beta, while animals without seizures had normal values. Our results show that both time and the antidote regime are crucial to the success of treatment.", 
    "190": "Detoxification from alcohol can be undertaken in ambulatory settings with patients who are alcohol-dependent and show signs of mild to moderate withdrawal when they are not drinking. An appropriate candidate for outpatient detoxification should have arrangements to start an alcohol treatment program and a responsible support person who can monitor progress, and should not have significant, acute, comorbid conditions or risk factors for severe withdrawal. Long-acting benzodiazepines, the preferred medications for alcohol detoxification, can be given on a fixed schedule or through \"front-loading\" or \"symptom-triggered\" regimens. Adjuvant sympatholytics can be used to treat hyperadrenergic symptoms that persist despite adequate sedation. Progress can be monitored with the use of a standard withdrawal-assessment scale and daily physician contact. Detoxification is not a stand-alone treatment but should serve as a bridge to a formal treatment program for alcohol dependence.",

Sample pretreatment was achieved by solid-phase extraction using Oasis HLB cartridges. The extracts were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with single-quadrupole mass spectrometry (MS) with an electrospray ionization interface. The MS system was operated in the selected ion monitoring mode. HPLC was performed isocratically on a reversed-phase XTerra MS C18 analytical column (150 x 3.0 mm i.d., particle size 5 microm). Diazepam was used as the internal standard for quantitation. The assay was linear over a concentration range of 5.0-1000 ng ml(-1) for all compounds analyzed. The limit of quantitation was 5 ng ml(-1) for all compounds. Quality control samples (5, 10, 300 and 1000 ng ml(-1)) in five replicates from three different runs of analysis demonstrated an intra-assay precision (CV) of < or = 9.1%, an inter-assay precision of < or = 6.0% and an overall accuracy (relative error) of < 4.6%.

PBR expression in nervous system has been reported in glial and immune cells. We now show expression of both PBR mRNA and protein, and the appearance of binding of a synthetic ligand fluo-FGIN-1-27 in mitochondria of rat cerebellar granule cells (CGCs). Additionally, the effect of PBR ligands on colchicine-induced apoptosis was investigated. Colchicine-induced neurotoxicity in CGCs was measured at 24 h. We show that, in vitro, PBR ligands 1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide (PK11195), 7-chloro-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2H-1,4- benzodiazepin-2-one (Ro5-4864) and diazepam (25- 50 microM) enhanced apoptosis induced by colchicine, as demonstrated by viability experiments, flow cytometry and nuclear chromatin condensation. Enhancement of colchicine-induced apoptosis was characterized by an increase in mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and AIF proteins and an enhanced activation of caspase-3, suggesting mitochondrion dependent mechanism that is involved in apoptotic process. Our results indicate that exposure of neural cells to PBR ligands generates an amplification of apoptotic process induced by colchicine and that the MPT pore may be involved in this process.", 
    "193": "The Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a devastating sex-linked recessive disorder resulting from almost complete deficiency of the activity of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). The enzyme deficiency results in an inability to synthesize the nucleotides guanosine monophosphate and inosine monophosphate from the purine bases guanine and hypoxanthine, respectively, via the \"salvage\" pathway and an accelerated biosynthesis of these purines via the de novo pathway. The syndrome is characterized by neurologic manifestations, including the very dramatic symptom of compulsive self-mutilation. The neurologic manifestations may result, at least in part, from a mixture of neurodevelopmental (eg, a failure to \"arborize\" dopaminergic synaptic terminals) and neurotransmitter (eg, disruption of GABA and glutamate receptor-mediated neurotransmission) consequences. HPRT deficiency results in elevated extracellular levels of hypoxanthine, which can bind to the benzodiazepine agonist recognition site on the GABA(A) receptor complex, and the possibility of diminished levels of guanine-based purines in discrete \"pools\" involved in synaptic transmission. In addition to their critical roles in metabolism, gene replication and expression, and signal transduction, guanine-based purines may be important regulators of the synaptic availability of L-glutamate. Guanine-based purines may also have important trophic functions in the CNS. The investigation of the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome may serve to clarify these and other important neurotransmitter, neuromodulatory, and neurotrophic roles that guanine-based purines play in the central nervous system, especially the developing brain. A widespread and general deficiency of guanine-based purines would lead to impaired transduction of a variety of signals that depend on GTP-protein-coupled second messenger systems. This is less likely in view of a prominent localized pathologic effect of HPRT deficiency on presynaptic dopaminergic projections to the striatum. A possible more circumscribed effect of a deficiency of guanine-based purines could be interference with modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission. Guanosine has been shown to be an important modulator of glutamatergic neurotransmission, promoting glial reuptake of L-glutamate. A deficiency of guanosine could lead to dysregulated glutamatergic neurotransmission, including possible excitotoxic damage. Unfortunately, although the biochemical lesion has been known for quite some time (ie, HPRT deficiency), therapeutically beneficial interventions for these affected children and adults have not yet emerged based on this elucidation. Conceivably, guanosine or its analogues and excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists could participate in the pharmacotherapy of this devastating disorder.",

In the present study, we have shown that micromolar concentrations of FGIN-1-27 and Ro 5-4864, two chemically unrelated PBR ligands are toxic for both PBR-expressing SK-N-BE neuroblastoma cells and PBR-deficient Jurkat lymphoma cells. We have thereby demonstrated that the cytotoxicity of these drugs is unrelated to their PBR-binding activity. Moreover, Ro 5-4864-induced cell death differed strikingly between both cell types, being apoptotic in Jurkat cells while necrotic in SK-N-BE cells. Again, this did not seem to be related to PBR expression since Ro 5-4864-induced death of PBR-transfected Jurkat cells remained apoptotic. Taken together, our results show that PBR is unlikely to mediate all the effects of these PBR ligands. They however confirm that some of these ligands are very effective cytotoxic drugs towards various cancer cells, even for reputed chemoresistant tumors such as neuroblastoma, and, surprisingly, also for PBR-lacking tumor cells."
