First, their mental health profile was examined by a number of subjective and objective assessments. Second, the medical consumption of the users was studied with special attention to the psychotropic drugs prescribed. The prevalence of psychological problems and symptoms of psychological distress was higher among OTC-P users than among non-users. Somatic problems and symptoms were comparable in the two groups; social support was better in the OTC-P users. Half of the users were known to have mental health problems by their Primary Care Physician (PCP). The DSM IV Axis I disorders were mostly mood and anxiety disorders. A benzodiazepine had been prescribed to one-third of the OTC-P users. No other psychotropic drugs had been prescribed, and the medical consumption was comparable in the two groups. PCPs should be aware of concomitant OTC-Ps use.", 
    "1": "Depolarising GABA(A) receptor-mediated responses recorded from the optic nerve using a grease gap technique were modulated by classical potentiators of GABA(A) receptors. The benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide, the barbiturate, pentobarbitone and the widely used anaesthetic, propofol, all potentiated gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses. They did so with different maximal efficacies, propofol>pentobarbitone>chlordiazepoxide, and potencies on the basis of EC(50) estimates, chlordiazepoxide>propofol>pentobarbitone. The greater than expected GABA potentiating properties of propofol were explained by a direct hyperpolarising action that occurred in the same concentration range as its action at the GABA(A) receptor but that was unlikely to be mediated by GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "2": "Complementary behavioral and computational studies of 21 structurally diverse, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)(A) benzodiazepine receptor ligands that influence spontaneous locomotor activity have been performed in this work. This behavioral endpoint is a well-accepted indicator of sedation particularly for GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor ligands. The goal of the work presented here is the identification and assessment of the minimum requirements for ligand recognition of GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptors leading to activity at the sedation endpoint embedded in a common 3D pharmacophore for recognition. Using the experimental results, together with a systematic computational procedure developed in our laboratory, a five-component 3D pharmacophore for recognition of the GABA(A) receptor subtypes associated with the sedative behavioral response has been developed consisting of: two proton-accepting moieties, a hydrophobic region, a ring with polar moieties and an aromatic ring in a common geometric arrangement in all ligands having an effect at the sedation endpoint. To provide further evidence that the 3D pharmacophore developed embodied common requirements for receptor recognition, a pharmacophore analysis was performed for agonists, inverse agonists and antagonists separately. Each of the resulting pharmacophores contained the same five moieties at comparable distances to those found for the pharmacophore generated using all of them together. This result confirms that this pharmacophore constitutes a recognition pharmacophore representing required features in the overlapping portion of their binding sites. The reliability of this 3D pharmacophore was then assessed in several ways. First, it was determined that ligands that had no effect at the sedation endpoint did not comply with the pharmacophore requirements. Second, four benzodiazepine receptor ligands known to have an effect at the sedation endpoint, but not used in the pharmacophore development were found to satisfy the requirements of this pharmacophore. Third, the geometric and chemical requirements embedded in this pharmacophore were used to search 3D databases resulting in the identification of benzodiazepine receptor ligands known to affect sedation, but not included in the pharmacophore development. Finally, a 3D-quantitative structure analysis procedure (QSAR) model was developed based upon the ligands in the training set superimposed at their sedation pharmacophore points. The 3D-QSAR model shows good predictivity for binding of these ligands to receptor subtypes containing alpha1 but not alpha5 subunits. The pharmacophore developed for the sedation endpoint thus provides a predictive binding model for diverse ligand binding to alpha1 containing receptor subtypes.", 
    "3": "The generators of high frequency bursts (600-Hz activity) detected at the parietal scalp over the primary somatosensory cortex after electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves are not yet known. We investigated the influence of benzodiazepine on the somatosensory-evoked 600-Hz activity by means of neuromagnetic measurements and source analysis. After oral administration of lorazepam, the latency of the 600-Hz burst activity was increased; specifically later peaks were delayed more than earlier peaks. In contrast, the latency of the concurrent primary cortical low frequency response (N20m) was not significantly changed. The source strengths of both N20m and 600-Hz bursts were significantly increased. Our results provide evidence for two components of the 600-Hz activity with a different generator structure.", 
    "4": "Benzodiazepines protect hippocampal neurons when administered within the first few hours after transient cerebral ischemia. Here, we examined the ability of diazepam to prevent early signals of cell injury (before cell death) after in vitro ischemia. Ischemia in vitro or in vivo causes a rapid depletion of ATP and the generation of cell death signals, such as the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Hippocampal slices from adult rats were subjected to 7 min of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and assessed histologically 3 h after reoxygenation. At this time, area CA1 neurons appeared viable, although slight abnormalities in structure were evident. Immediately following OGD, ATP levels in hippocampus were decreased by 70%, and they recovered partially over the next 3 h of reoxygenation. When diazepam was included in the reoxygenation buffer, ATP levels recovered completely by 3 h after OGD. The effects of diazepam were blocked by picrotoxin, indicating that the protection was mediated by an influx of Cl(-) through the GABA(A) receptor. It is interesting that the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil did not prevent the action of diazepam, as has been shown in other studies using the hippocampus. Two hours after OGD, the partial recovery of ATP levels occurred simultaneously with an increase of cytochrome c (approximately 400%) in the cytosol. When diazepam was included in the reoxygenation buffer, it completely prevented the increase in cytosolic cytochrome c. Thus, complete recovery of ATP and prevention of cytochrome c release from mitochondria can be achieved when diazepam is given after the loss of ATP induced by OGD.", 
    "5": "This paper reviews pharmacological and other approaches currently used to treat tension-type headache (TTH), and examines aspects of the classification and pathogenesis of this common complaint. Accurate diagnosis is essential before treatment is prescribed and should involve complete history taking, thorough neurological examination and evaluation of possible associated factors. The most frequently used drugs for the acute treatment of TTH are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) of which only some have been shown to be efficacious in placebo-controlled trials. Amitriptyline remains the first choice treatment for prophylaxis. Other antidepressants, muscle relaxants and benzodiazepines may be used, but few have been evaluated adequately in placebo-controlled trials. Biofeedback and relaxation training, demonstrated efficacious by controlled studies, may be used when the aim is to avoid the side effects of pharmacological treatment.", 
    "6": "The viral protease inhibitor ritonavir has the capacity to inhibit and induce the activity of cytochrome P450-3A (CYP3A) isoforms, leading to drug interactions that may influence the efficacy and toxicity of other antiretroviral therapies, as well as pharmacologic treatments of coincident or complicating diseases.", 
    "7": "The inhibitory effect of ritonavir on the biotransformation of the hypnotic agents triazolam and zolpidem was tested in vitro using human liver microsomes. In a double-blind clinical study, volunteer study subjects received 0.125 mg triazolam or 5.0 mg zolpidem concurrent with low-dose ritonavir (four doses of 200 mg), or with placebo.", 
    "8": "Ritonavir was a potent in vitro inhibitor of triazolam hydroxylation but was less potent as an inhibitor of zolpidem hydroxylation. In the clinical study, ritonavir reduced triazolam clearance to < 4% of control values (p < .005), prolonged elimination half-life (41 versus 3 hours; p < .005), and magnified benzodiazepine agonist effects such as sedation and performance impairment. In contrast, ritonavir reduced zolpidem clearance to 78% of control values (p < .08), and slightly prolonged elimination half-life (2.4 versus 2.0 hours; NS). Benzodiazepine agonist effects of zolpidem were not altered by ritonavir.", 
    "9": "Short-term low-dose administration of ritonavir produces a large and significant impairment of triazolam clearance and enhancement of clinical effects. In contrast, ritonavir produced small and clinically unimportant reductions in zolpidem clearance. The findings are consistent with the complete dependence of triazolam clearance on CYP3A activity, compared with the partial dependence of zolpidem clearance on CYP3A.", 
    "10": "We have recently shown that benzodiazepines with high affinity for peripheral-type receptors such as 4'-chlordiazepam inhibit insulin secretion in vitro. PK 11195 [1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline-carboxami de], a potent and selective ligand for peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites, was also shown to inhibit insulin release from rat pancreatic islets. Both substances have been reported to interact with mitochondrial binding sites. Hence, the present study was performed to investigate the effects of PK 11195 on insulin secretion induced by either a metabolic or a non-metabolic stimulus. In the rat isolated pancreas perfused at a constant pressure with a Krebs-bicarbonate buffer containing a slightly stimulating glucose concentration (8.3 mM), PK 11195 (10(-7)-10(-5) M) induced a progressive and concentration-dependent decrease in insulin secretion. Simultaneously, we recorded the effects on the pancreatic flow rate; in contrast to 4'-chlordiazepam, previously shown to induce vasodilation in the same preparation, PK 11195 was ineffective. The differential effects of these two substances on vascular resistance and insulin secretion may suggest the existence of different subtypes of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors on pancreatic beta-cells and vessels. A metabolic stimulation of insulin secretion was induced by a glucose increment from 4.2 mM to 8.4 mM or by 2 mM alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (KIC), which is directly metabolized in the mitochondria; these stimulations could be reduced by 10(-5) M PK 11195 (P<0.05). In contrast, the drug was ineffective on the insulin secretion induced by 5 mM or 10 mM KCl in the presence of a nonstimulating glucose concentration (4.2 mM). These results suggest that PK 11195 inhibits insulin secretion by interfering with mitochondrial oxidative metabolism.", 
    "11": "Comparative clinical investigation was performed in 80 ASA I/II patients undergoing cataract surgery on one eye. Patients were randomly divided in to four groups, according to the method of anesthesia. Intraoperatively (T0-T6), decreasing of intraocular pressure (IOP) to the optimal values at the start of the operation (T3), and the hemodynamic stability of patients after the induction (T1) were evaluated. Postoperatively, the recovery rate, and the incidence of vomiting were measured. Optimal decreasing of IOP was noticed in the second group (75% of patients). Best hemodynamic stability was observed in the second group (80% patients). Fast recovery rate was noticed in the first and the second groups (13.9 +/- 1.1 and 14.4 +/- 0.8 min). Vomiting was noticed in 5% patients in the first group, 15% in the third group, and in 20% in the 4th group. The authors have concluded that TIVA fourth propofol and coinduction with midazolam is anesthesia of choice in the cataract surgery.", 
    "12": "While methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment for opiate dependence, its impact on the treatment outcome of other illicit drug abuse is not as clear. Using the initial urine drug screen (UDS) and follow-up UDS at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months, 167 patients consecutively admitted to MMT were evaluated for opiate, sedative (predominantly benzodiazepine), and stimulant (predominantly cocaine) use. Retention for the opiate only group was 97.32 days longer on average than for patients using opiates along with stimulants, sedatives, or both stimulants and sedatives. Patients abusing opiates only had the greatest decrease in drug use; however, MMT was also associated with decreases in cocaine and sedative use over the 24 month follow-up period. There was no evidence that patients \"switched\" their drugs of abuse with time in treatment. The negative impact of non-opiate drug use on outcome in MMT and its implications for treatment planning are discussed.", 
    "13": "Charts of patients hospitalized for uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal were examined and detoxification practices compared. Patients detoxified using a Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-revised (CIWA-Ar) based PRN protocol on the addiction unit received significantly fewer chlordiazepoxide milligram equivalents over shorter duration than patients managed by other detoxification methods on other hospital units. Significantly fewer patients received benzodiazepines in the CIWA-Ar protocol managed group, but inter-group differences (p < 0.01) remained when only medicated patients were compared. Differences between the protocol and non-protocol groups did not reach statistical significance when PRN only strategies were examined, suggesting that the use of a symptom-triggered strategy may account for the noted effects.", 
    "14": "Isolated human bronchi and rat tracheae were incubated in organ baths to measure histamine release. The calcium ionophore A23187, 3 micromol/L in rat trachea and 10 micromol/L in human bronchi, stimulated histamine release by 145 +/- 50% (n = 6) and 270 +/- 48% (n = 7) above the prestimulation level, respectively. Acetylcholine (100 pmol/L; human bronchi) or oxotremorine (1, 100, 10,000 nmol/L; rat trachea) did not affect the spontaneous histamine release. In rat tracheae neither acetylcholine nor oxotremorine inhibited A23187-evoked histamine release, whereas 100 pmol/L acetylcholine significantly suppressed the evoked histamine release in human bronchi by 86%. For receptor characterization the following subtype-specific muscarinic receptor antagonists were applied: pirenzepine (M1 subtype), para-fluorohexahydrosiladifendiol (pFHHSiD; similar affinities at human cloned M1-, M3-, and M4-receptors), AF-DX 116 (M2 subtype), and clozapine (antagonist at cloned M1-, M2-, M3-receptors; agonist at cloned M4-receptors). Pirenzepine, pFHHSiD, AF-DX 116, and clozapine (100 nmol/L each) antagonized the inhibitory effect of 100 pmol/L acetylcholine by 83 +/- 20% (n = 6), 83 +/- 9% (n = 8), 50 +/- 14% (n = 6), and 35 +/- 7% (6). In conclusion, a species difference exists in the cholinergic control of histamine release between human and rat airways. In human airways muscarinic receptors most likely of the M1 subtype are involved in the inhibitory control of mast cell function, whereas such an inhibitory pathway does not exist in the rat trachea.", 
    "15": "A simple and sensitive high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method using a semi-micro column, C8 reversed-phase column (3 mm i.d.) and a low flow rate 0.3 ml/min was developed and validated for the determination of five frequently prescribed benzodiazepines: clonazepam, diazepam, flunitrazepam, midazolam and oxazepam. Quantification was performed at 220 nm with methylclonazepam as internal standard. The method involved a simple extraction from alkalinized blood (1 ml) into 1-chlorobutane and provided excellent sensitivity, recovery, accuracy and reproducibility for benzodiazepines in therapeutic or toxic concentrations.", 
    "16": "We describe a 68-year-old woman who experienced pain and phantom limb sensation following an above-the-knee amputation of the right leg. A month later, the patient had myoclonic jerks of the stump. Polymyo-graphic recordings showed synchronous jerks in the vastus medialis and adductors of the thigh on the right side. The patient responded to clonazepam. We conclude that the myoclonic jerks were of spinal cord origin.", 
    "17": "The clinical and neurophysiological findings in a patient with a typical stiff-man syndrome and their three-year evolution are described. The patient had high titers of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain and spinal cord was normal. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) revealed a distinctive motor evoked potential (MEP) pattern in proximal lower limb muscles consisting of markedly increased MEP amplitudes and MEP/M ratios, reduced excitability thresholds, and absent silent period. However, MEP latencies, central and peripheral conduction times and amplitudes obtained by magnetic spinal root stimulation were normal. Treatment with benzodiazepine and baclofen normalized both the clinical picture and the MEP values. TMS may be useful both as a diagnostic tool and to monitor the response to drug treatment.", 
    "18": "The performance, observer-rated, and participant-rated effects of orally administered placebo, and two benzodiazepines, flunitrazepam (2, 4 and 8 mg/70 kg) and triazolam (0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/70 kg), were compared in 14 sedative drug abusers using a double-blind crossover design. Both flunitrazepam and triazolam produced dose-related decrements in memory and psychomotor/cognitive performance, and increases in many participant- and observer-rated measures. Effects of flunitrazepam had an earlier onset and a longer duration than those of triazolam. Although there was evidence that the flunitrazepam doses selected for study were somewhat higher overall relative to the selected triazolam doses, analysis of the participant-rated measures collected 24 h after drug administration (next-day) suggests that flunitrazepam may have a greater abuse liability than triazolam when abuse liability is assessed 24 h after drug administration. The highest flunitrazepam dose produced effects that were significantly greater than those of the highest triazolam dose on next-day ratings of good effects, take again, and worth; all tested flunitrazepam doses produced effects greater than any triazolam dose on next-day ratings of liking and take again. The highest flunitrazepam dose, but no triazolam dose, significantly increased the maximum dollar value at which participants chose drug over money in a Drug versus Money Choice Procedure.", 
    "19": "This study compared the direct effects and acute physical dependence of butorphanol and morphine, opioids with differing actions at mu versus kappa receptors. Six non-dependent heroin-using volunteers were exposed to six conditions in a within-subject, Latin square design using double-blind procedures. In each session, agonist effects of single i.m. injections of butorphanol (3 and 6 mg/70 kg), morphine (15 and 30 mg/70 kg), lorazepam (4 mg/70 kg) or saline were evaluated. Butorphanol and morphine produced effects of comparable magnitude on miosis and reports of 'any drug effect'. Volunteers reported dysphoria, confusion and sedation after butorphanol, subjective effects that overlapped with those of lorazepam, whereas morphine produced euphoria and stimulation. Acute physical dependence (i.e. precipitated withdrawal responses to naloxone 10 mg/70 kg i.m. administered 6 h after each treatment) significantly increased after 30 mg/70 kg morphine but not after butorphanol treatments. These differences in naloxone sensitivity are likely due to differences in opioid receptor (mu versus kappa) activity, affinity and efficacy of these compounds. Pharmacological ramifications of these results are discussed.",

Lithium, sodium valproate, carbamazapine, and adjunctive treatment with benzodiazapines and antipsychotics have been used to treat bipolar I disorders. We report a case of a 17-year-old adolescent male with bipolar I disorder who responded favorably to the treatment with the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine.

Initial sedation was the most common side effect observed. Youngsters who had not had a previous trial on any psychotropic did better than those that had failed a previous medication trial. Age was inversely correlated with positive response to olanzapine. Patients who experienced initial sedation did best once the initial sedation wore off. The majority of patients in the study improved on olanzapine.", 
    "27": "In this study we measured the ability of three newly-synthesized N-arylalkylindol-3-ylglyoxylylamide derivatives, which have recently been characterized as partial agonists at central benzodiazepine binding sites, to prevent the rat cardiac mitochondrial alterations resulting from acute loud noise exposure. In particular, we evaluated the effects of these new compounds on the ultrastructural damage induced by noise stress on the right atrium and ventricle after 6 and 12 hr of loud noise exposure. In parallel experiments, we measured the affinity of these compounds for peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites. Following a single injection of the test products, we observed a cardioprotective effect which was more marked after 6 hr compared with 12 hr of noise exposure. Confirming our recent data showing that full agonists at benzodiazepine receptors produce cardioprotection, we demonstrate in this study that partial agonists, like indolylglyoxylylamides, can also produce a cardioprotective effect. Based on their greater affinity in binding studies, the protective activity seems to be related more to their action at central than at peripheral benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "28": "Seventy-one patients with panic disorder (PD) and 46 patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) were studied in relation to their behavior before, during, and after participation in two contemporaneous and procedurally similar double-blind drug efficacy trials. The two groups were administered a battery of assessments aimed at comparing them on the nature and intensity of various symptom domains, social and work-related disability, personality, life events, and previous treatments. The results yielded few significant differences that were not due to definitional factors, most notably a more prevalent history of depression and treatment for depression in the GAD group and a higher rate of pharmacological treatment in the PD group. On the other hand, the two groups behaved in a comparable way in the screening, experimental, and postexperimental phases of the trials. The findings are in support of more similarities than differences between the groups. In addition, the comparable behavior of the two groups throughout the three phases of the trial suggests that differential pretreatment attrition and compliance with placebo-controlled trials may not present major confounding problems in comparative treatment effectiveness studies between GAD and PD diagnostic groups.",

These patients (aged 19-40 years) underwent a 52-week double-blind cross-over study with olanzapine (5 and 10 mg daily) vs. low-dose pimozide (2 and 4 mg daily). The reduction in rating scale scores for the syndrome was highly significant with 10 mg olanzapine vs. basal and vs. 2 mg pimozide, and was significant for 5 mg olanzapine vs. 4 mg pimozide. Only moderate sedation was reported by one patient during olanzapine treatment while three complained of minor motor side effects and sedation during pimozide treatment. At the end of the study all patients opted for olanzapine treatment.", 
    "30": "The behavioral effects of acute administration of two flavonoids, apigenin and chrysin, contained in Matricaria chamomilla and in Passiflora incarnata, respectively, were studied in rats. The data demonstrate that in our experimental conditions, the two flavonoids were equally able to reduce locomotor activity when injected in rats at a minimal effective dose of 25 mg/kg. However, while chrysin exhibited a clear anxiolytic effect when injected at the dose of 1 mg/kg, apigenin failed to exert this activity. The sedative effect of these flavonoids cannot be ascribed to an interaction with GABA-benzodiazepine receptors, since it was not counteracted by the benzodiazepine antagonist Flumazenil. To the contrary, the anxiolytic effect of chrysin, which was blocked by the injection of Flumazenil, could be linked to an activation of the GABA(A) receptor unit.", 
    "31": "The cytotoxic effects of flunitrazepam, zipeprol and trihexyphenidyl on cell viability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers were studied at concentrations from 10(-2) to 10(-8) M by 2 colorimetric in vitro assays: the neutral red uptake assay and thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide assay. All tested drugs of abuse were non-cytotoxic at concentrations lower than 10(-5) M. Possible immunomodulative effects of these substances were evaluated through phytohemagglutinin induced lymphocyte proliferation ([3H]-thymidine DNA incorporation assay) and by a 51Cr release natural killer assay.

    "32": "In this study, we present significant changes occurring in serum drug concentrations while using blood collection tubes that contain a barrier gel. This report also contains results with antidepressant drugs, which have not been studied before with human samples. The drug concentrations were measured either with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA). The results show that gel tubes are suitable for blood collection for antiepileptic, antibiotic, asthma and cardioactive drug measurements, since only slight adsorption was seen (0-5%). However, the studied tubes are not suitable for blood collection of antidepressants nor benzodiazepines, because the adsorption can be 5-30%. The adsorption was even higher (up to 40%) when samples were stored for 24 h after centrifugation in gel tubes. When the centrifugation step was performed after storage the effect of the barrier gel was lower (only 0-13%). Antidepressant drug measurements performed from patient specimens collected in the studied gel tubes and stored for 3 h showed <10% adsorption of the studied drugs. After 24 h storage time, concentrations of all analysed drugs decreased even more: adsorbed amount of drugs were about 5-20%. The studied gel tubes are proposed to be satisfactory for blood collection for antidepressant drug measurements if separation step is performed within 3 h after blood clotting. With the spiked samples the adsorption to barrier gel was higher, so it seems that adsorption is faster when drugs are not highly bound to serum proteins.",

Prior to starting olanzapine therapy, the patient's diabetes was controlled by diet modification with a glycosylated hemoglobin of 6.5%. During olanzapine therapy, blood glucose concentrations could not be regulated despite use of antidiabetic agents, insulin, and dietary interventions. The patient also gained a total of 13 kg. Two weeks after discontinuation of all antipsychotic medications (olanzapine, quetiapine), the patient's blood glucose concentrations became better regulated and remained better controlled until discharge.", 
    "35": "All atypical antipsychotics are associated with weight gain. Obesity is a well-documented risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Currently there are only six published reports that implicate olanzapine as being associated with glucose dysregulation. The exact cause of glucose dysregulation with olanzapine is unclear, but weight gain does not seem to be the sole etiology. It has been hypothesized that serotonin (5-HT1A) antagonism may decrease the responsiveness of the pancreatic beta-cells. This would then result in inappropriately low insulin secretion and, therefore, hyperglycemia. Based on the Naranjo probability scale, the likelihood that olanzapine caused the glucose dysregulation in our patient was possible.", 
    "36": "Although olanzapine has shown greater clinical efficacy and is associated with fewer extrapyramidal side effects than typical antipsychotics, it may produce exacerbation or new emergence of diabetes mellitus. Further examination of the incidence and etiology of glucose dysregulation after the initiation of olanzapine therapy is necessary.", 
    "37": "The present study was conducted to further explore plant-derived essential oils that possess an anticonflict effect using the Geller type conflict test in ICR mice. The benzodiazepine anxiolytic diazepam increased the response (lever pressing) rate during the alarm period (i.e., an anticonflict effect), but the 5-HT1A partial agonist buspirone did not. Oils of juniper, cypress, geranium and jasmine did not produce any effect in this test. Frankincense oil decreased the response rate during the safe period at 1600 mg/kg, but did not exhibit any effect on the response rate during the alarm period. In contrast, lavender oil increased the response rate during the alarm period in a dose-dependent manner in the same manner as diazepam. These results indicate that not only rose oil but also lavender oil possess an anticonflict effect in mice.",

Acute effects of the oral administration of DZ (0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10.0, 30.0 mg/kg) and MZ (same doses) were determined for the discriminated-force task before and after a repeated-administration procedure.", 
    "41": "When administered acutely, both drugs increased the peak force of responses in a dose-related manner and concomitantly reduced the proportion of reinforced responses, with MZ exhibiting greater potency. For the next 36 days, one group received drug before experimental sessions and the other group received drug after the experimental session. A second dose-effect determination demonstrated that rats chronically dosed with DZ or MZ pre-session displayed more contingent tolerance to alterations in peak force than rats that had received 36 drug injections postsession, where there was no opportunity to practice the force-discrimination response while under the drug state.",

A total of 370 veterans were compared by substance abuse diagnosis (50%), benzodiazepine use (36%), and their interaction on 1-year outcomes after inpatient discharge. Substance abusers were less likely to be prescribed benzodiazepines (26% vs. 45%). No outcome showed a differential worsening by substance abuse or benzodiazepines, although some baseline differences were noted. Outpatient health care utilization was lower in benzodiazepine users (47 vs. 33 visits). Among PTSD patients with comorbid substance abuse, benzodiazepine treatment was not associated with adverse effects on outcome, but it may reduce health care utilization.", 
    "44": "The present study describes the effect of (S)-2,3-dihydro-[3, 4]cyclopentano-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-1,1-dioxide (S18986-1), a positive allosteric modulator of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors with cognitive-enhancing effects, on (S)-AMPA-induced [3H]noradrenaline release in rat hippocampal and frontal cortex slices. (S)-AMPA significantly increased [3H]noradrenaline release in rat hippocampus and frontal cortex slices, whereas S18986-1 (3-1000 microM) alone, was inactive. However, S18986-1 between 30 and 1000 microM potently enhanced (+200%) (S)-AMPA-mediated [3H]noradrenaline release in both hippocampal and frontal cortex slices. The capacity of S18986-1 to potentiate [3H]noradrenaline release was specific for AMPA receptors as S18986-1 failed to potentiate either kainate and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated release of [3H]noradrenaline in rat hippocampal slices. Moreover, 1, 2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-nitro-2,3-dioxo-benzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX) and 1-(4-aminophenyl)-3-methylcarbamoyl-4-methyl-3, 4-dihydro-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI-53655) but not (5R,10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5, 10-imine ((+)-MK-801), inhibited (S)-AMPA and S18986-induced stimulation of (S)-AMPA-mediated [3H]noradrenaline release. In addition, S18986-1-induced stimulation of (S)-AMPA-evoked [3H]noradrenaline release was markedly attenuated in the presence of tetrodotoxin (1 microM) and in Ca(2+)-free buffer. S18986-1 enhanced (S)-AMPA-mediated [3H]noradrenaline release to a greater extent than its corresponding (R)-enantiomer S19024-1 and racemic mixture S17951-1. However, positive allosteric modulators of AMPA receptors such as aniracetam failed to potentiate AMPA-mediated noradrenaline release in hippocampal slices, whereas cyclothiazide potently enhanced (S)-AMPA-mediated [3H]noradrenaline release. These results suggest that the capacity of S18986-1 to enhance AMPA receptor-mediated release of noradrenaline in rat hippocampus and frontal cortex, could contribute to the cognition enhancing mechanisms of S18986-1.", 
    "45": "Ziprasidone (Zeldox) is a novel antipsychotic with a unique combination of antagonist activities at monoaminergic receptors and transporters and potent agonist activity at serotonin 5-HT(1A) receptors. 5-HT(1A) receptor agonism may be an important feature in ziprasidone's clinical actions because 5-HT(1A) agonists increase cortical dopamine release, which may underlie efficacy against negative symptoms and reduce dopamine D(2) antagonist-induced extrapyramidal side effects. This study investigated the in vivo 5-HT(1A) agonist activity of ziprasidone by measuring the contribution of 5-HT(1A) receptor activation to the ziprasidone-induced cortical dopamine release in rats.", 
    "46": "Effects on dopamine release were measured by microdialysis in prefrontal cortex and striatum. The role of 5-HT(1A) receptor activation was estimated by assessing the sensitivity of the response to pretreatment with the 5-HT(1A) antagonist, WAY-100635. For comparison, the D(2)/5-HT(2A) antagonists clozapine and olanzapine, the D(2) antagonist haloperidol, the 5-HT(2A) antagonist MDL 100,907 and the 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-OHDPAT were included.", 
    "47": "Low doses (<3.2 mg/kg) of ziprasidone, clozapine, and olanzapine increased dopamine release to approximately the same extent in prefrontal cortex as in striatum, but higher doses (> or =3.2 mg/kg) resulted in an increasingly preferential effect on cortical dopamine release. The 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-OHDPAT produced a robust increase in cortical dopamine (DA) release without affecting striatal DA release. In contrast, the D(2) antagonist haloperidol selectively increased striatal DA release, whereas the 5-HT(2A) antagonist MDL 100,907 had no effect on cortical or striatal DA release. Prior administration of WAY-100635 completely blocked the cortical DA increase produced by 8-OHDPAT and significantly attenuated the ziprasidone- and clozapine-induced cortical DA increase. WAY-100635 pretreatment had no effect on the olanzapine-induced DA increase.", 
    "48": "The preferential increase in DA release in rat prefrontal cortex produced by ziprasidone is mediated by 5-HT(1A) receptor activation. This result extends and confirms other in vitro and in vivo data suggesting that ziprasidone, like clozapine, acts as a 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist in vivo, which may contribute to its activity as an antipsychotic with efficacy against negative symptoms and a low extrapyramidal side effect liability.", 
    "49": "Among the main causes for the relatively small number of organ donors, the delay in the diagnosis of brain death plays a major role. Administration of drugs causing central nervous system (CNS) depression prevents diagnosis of brain death by clinical and electroencephalographic criteria until serum clearance of the drug has occurred. Confirming brain death by demonstrating persistent intracranial circulatory arrest might decrease the length of the diagnostic process. We have carried out a prospective study to investigate whether 99 mTc-hexamethyl propylenamino oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) brain scintigraphy and/or transcranial Doppler ultrasound can speed up the diagnosis of brain death in patients treated with CNS depressant drugs.", 
    "50": "All 138 consecutive patients with severe brain lesion that progressed to brain death in our center between January 1994 and December 1996 were controlled. Of them, 36 patients aged 1 to 65 years old (mean=25.6+/-18.3 years) who met clinical and EEG criteria for the diagnosis of brain death, except for the presence of significant serum levels of barbiturates (n=34), opiates (n=8), and benzodiazepines (n=3) were distributed in three groups according to the confirmatory test used; group 1: waiting for the metabolic clearance of CNS depressant drugs, or by demonstrating intracranial circulatory arrest with 99mTc-HMPAO (group 2) or transcranial Doppler (group 3). The delay in diagnosing brain death by the three methods was analyzed.", 
    "51": "The mean interval between the presumptive and the definitive diagnosis of brain death was 34.4+/-32.2 hr in group 1, 17.7+/-18.3 hr in group 2, and 5.0+/-4.6 hr in group 3 (P=0.004). The between-groups analysis showed that 99mTc-HMPAO and transcranial Doppler decreased the delay in diagnosing brain death with respect to waiting for drug clearance by 49% (P=0.16) and 85% (P<0.001), respectively. Moreover, transcranial Doppler decreased this time by 72% with respect to 99mTc-HMPAO (P<0.01).", 
    "52": "Transcranial Doppler ultrasound and 99mTc-HMPAO brain scintigraphy can significantly reduce the time taken to confirm brain death in patients with significant serum levels of CNS depressant drugs. In this setting, transcranial Doppler is superior to 99mTc-HMPAO in reducing the waiting time for a firm diagnosis of brain death.", 
    "53": "Psychosis frequently occurs in women of childbearing potential who may have unplanned pregnancies. Understanding the risk of prenatal antipsychotic exposure can be of benefit in selecting therapies. The authors evaluated the in utero and lactation exposure effects of olanzapine, a novel antipsychotic that is used in treating schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other conditions and that may have expanded use in the childbearing population. All prospectively and retrospectively ascertained pregnancy reports were collected as a registry in the Lilly Worldwide Pharmacovigilance Safety Database. Outcomes were available from 23 prospectively ascertained olanzapine-exposed pregnancies. Spontaneous abortion occurred in 13%, stillbirth in 5%, major malformation in 0%, and prematurity in 5%, all within the range of normal historic control rates. There were 11 retrospectively ascertained cases of pregnancy. Two retrospectively ascertained cases of lactation exposure did not suggest infant risk. The early experience with olanzapine use in pregnancy and lactation is encouraging in that no obvious added risk to the fetus or infant was observed. Additional cases of pregnancy and lactation exposure need to be evaluated to determine whether these early findings are representative of the risks of olanzapine exposure to the fetus and infant. At this time, olanzapine should only be used during pregnancy and lactation when the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus or infant.",

    "57": "Each study was examined for methodologic issues, criteria used, prevalence, nature and extent of inappropriate medication use, and factors associated with their use. Despite the methodologic differences, the review revealed some consistent patterns across healthcare settings. This review has shown that: (1) most of the researchers modified the Beers criteria to examine inappropriate medication use in the elderly; (2) studies using patient-based prevalence showed that between nearly one in four (23.5%) and one in seven (14.0%) elderly patients received an inappropriate medication as defined by either the Beers list of 20 inappropriate medications or the Modified Beers list; (3) the majority of these patients received one inappropriate agent; and (4) long-acting benzodiazepines, dipyridamole, propoxyphene, and amitriptyline were among the most frequently prescribed inappropriate medications. Univariate analyses indicated that women, patients >80 years old, and Medicaid patients appeared to receive more inappropriate medications than others; however, multivariate analyses found that only a higher number of medications was consistently associated with inappropriate medication use.",

    "59": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a condition requiring emergency care, which is often poorly managed in developing countries due to the lack of personnel, drugs, and insufficient technical and medical means. This study aims at determining the epidemiologic and etiologic characteristics and the difficulty in treating SE under the existing medical practice conditions in a developing country such as Senegal. A retrospective study was therefore carried out based on SE medical files at the University Hospital of Dakar over the period January 1988 to December 1998, and included several hospital departments, i.e., paediatrics, infectious diseases and neurology. Over an 11-year period 697 cases were recorded; of these, 48.2% of patients were under 5 years of age. The seizures were generalized in 58.2% of cases, partial in 21.2%, partial secondarily generalized, or with an association of both clinical presentations in 20.6% of cases. The etiology was as follows: mainly infectious (67%), followed by resistant and/or unbalanced epilepsy (9.9%), epilepsy of vascular origin (8%), and various other causes. The overall mortality rate was 24.8%. A long period between the onset of clinical symptoms and hospital treatment was noted, with an average time lapse of 16.6 h before treatment. The drugs utilized were diazepam and phenobarbitol, administered by injection. The overall outcome could be improved by better management, i.e., better prevention and an efficient treatment of infectious diseases, a reduction in the time before treatment, and improved means of intensive care.", 
    "60": "Non-convulsive confusional status epilepticus (NCSE) is classically separated into two forms on the basis of the ictal EEG, i.e., absence status (AS) and complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). The diagnosis is difficult on the basis of clinical semiology alone, and requires emergency EEG investigation. Absence status, or 'petit mal' status, is a polymorphic condition that can complicate many epileptic syndromes, and is the most frequently encountered form of NCSE. It is characterized by confusion of varying intensity, associated in 50% of cases with bilateral periocular myoclonias. The EEG shows ictal generalized paroximal activity; normalization is obtained after benzodiazepine injection. In AS, there is a significant nosographic heterogeneity. Four groups can be distinguished: i) typical AS occurs in the context of a generalized idiopathic epilepsy; ii) atypical AS occurs in patients with symptomatic or cryptogenic generalized epilepsies; iii) 'de novo' AS (of late onset) is characterized by toxic or metabolic precipitating factors in middle-aged subjects with no previous history of epilepsy; iv) AS with focal characteristics occurs in subjects with a pre-existing or newly diagnosed partial epilepsy, mostly of extra-temporal origin. The majority of cases are in fact transitional forms between these four groups. CPSE is characterized by continuous or rapidly recurring complex partial seizures which may involve temporal and/or extratemporal regions. Cyclic disturbance of consciousness is characteristic of CPSE of temporal lobe origin, which requires vigorous treatment to prevent recurrence or cognitive sequelae. CPSE of frontal lobe origin is a diagnostic challenge: it is rare, the symptoms are unusual, and the patients should be documented extensively. A focal frontal lesion is revealed in one-third of cases.", 
    "61": "We aimed to perform a prospective analysis of the main characteristics of deaths occurring in the oncohaematology department of a general hospital. From November 1995 to February 1997, a total of 81 patients died in our unit, 50 of whom (61.7%) were male. Their mean age was 67.8 (range 19-96) years. Underlying diseases were: multiple myeloma (9 cases), acute myeloid leukaemia (22), lymphoma (14), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (6), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (4), myelodysplastic syndromes (3), solid tumours (11), and other (12). The previous disease duration ranged from 5 days to 276 months (mean 31.9 months). The duration of the last hospital stay varied between 0 (death on arrival or on way to hospital) and 40 days (mean 9.3 days). Two patients died in the emergency unit just before entering our department (1 suicide). Only 15 patients had been admitted for the first time. In 70% of these cases death appeared predictable, as the consequence of refractory or end-stage disease. In these cases, all the \"do not resuscitate\" orders were in place at least 48 h before death. About half the patients died without any relative present. The frequencies of the clinical complaints evaluated were the following: pain necessitating opiates 27%; infection- or disease-related fever 40%; dyspnoea 44%; haemorrhage 20%; CNS disturbances 25%. The percentages of use of therapy tools chosen as indicators were: benzodiazepines 80%; chemotherapy 46%; anti-infectious agents 47%; transfusions 42%; major analgesics 27%; and steroids 40%. The circumstances and quality of patient deaths must be regularly evaluated so that palliative care in the final stages of life can be improved.",

The effects of these drugs on conventional measures of anxiety (% entries and % time in open arms) in a standard EPM test were also independently investigated.", 
    "65": "Open-arm confinement resulted in a high-magnitude antinociception (minimum 85%, maximum 450%) compared with enclosed arm confinement. The opiate antagonist naloxone (1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) neither blocked this open arm-induced antinociception (OAIA) nor modified indices of anxiety in EPM. Administration of midazolam (0.5-2 mg/kg, s.c.) increased OAIA and produced antinociception in enclosed confined animals, as well as attenuating anxiety in the EPM. The 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (0.05-1 mg/kg, s.c.) had biphasic effects on OAIA, antagonising the response at the lowest dose and intensifying it at the highest dose. In addition, low doses of this agent reduced anxiety in the EPM. Although bilateral injections of 8-OH-DPAT (5.6 nmol/0.4 microl) or NAN-190 (5.6 nmol and 10 nmol/0.4 microl) into the amygdala did not alter OAIA, increased anxiety was observed in the EPM. In contrast, intra-amygdala administration of midazolam (10 nmol and 30 nmol/0.4 microl) blocked both OAIA and anxiety.", 
    "66": "These results with systemic and intracerebral drug infusion suggest that 5-HT(1A) receptors localised in the amygdala are not involved in the pain inhibitory processes that are \"recruited\" during aversive situations. However, activation of these receptors does phasically increase anxiety. Although the intrinsic antinociceptive properties of systemically administered midazolam confounded interpretation of its effects on OAIA, intra-amygdala injections of this compound suggest that benzodiazepine receptors in this brain region modulate both the antinociceptive and behavioural (anxiety) responses to the EPM.",

Here, we analyzed, through [3H]-flumazenil binding, whether central BZD binding sites could be involved in the physiological processes underlying these differences of genetic sensitivities. In the JE/Le strain, where the effects of the chromosome 4 fragment can be analyzed, we found associations between [3H]-flumazenil binding and the convulsive action of beta-CCM. On the contrary, this no longer holds true in C3XtEso strain, where the effects of the chromosome 13 fragment were observed.",

A disturbance in mineralocorticoid action has been discussed, as mineralocorticoids regulate water balance. Desoxycorticosterone (DOC) is interesting, as it has mineralocorticoid effects and is a precursor to the neurosteroid 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha,21-diol-20-one (THDOC). THDOC is a steroid with direct benzodiazepine-like effects on the GABA-A receptor in the brain that is metabolized from DOC within the brain and in the periphery. Ten women with PMS having swelling as a major symptom and eight controls were recruited. They marked, on a validated visual-analog scale, three physical symptoms every evening during one menstrual cycle in conjunction with giving blood samples for progesterone and DOC measurements. DOC showed menstrual cycle-linked variation correlating with progesterone. There was no difference in plasma DOC concentrations between patients and controls. The symptoms reached a maximum 1-3 days before the onset of menstruation, with a delay of 3-6 days after the hormone peak. DOC was less strongly correlated with the symptoms than progesterone. These results do not support the hypothesis that DOC is involved in the etiology of physical symptoms in PMS or that physical and mental symptoms have separate etiologies.",

The syndrome may be complicated by dizziness, ataxia, confusion, headache, memory loss, and aggressive behavior. Serum chemistries are often deceptive because the anion gap is frequently normal in spite of severe metabolic acidosis. Moreover, the urine anion gap may be positive, incorrectly suggesting a defect in renal net acid excretion. Indeed, the combination of a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis and positive urine anion gap may erroneously suggest a diagnosis of renal tubular acidosis. Importantly, all reported cases of D-lactic acidosis secondary to bypass surgery have been encountered within 5 to 10 years following the surgery. Here we present an unusual case of D-lactic acidosis (complicated by encephalopathy) presenting 23 years after a jejuno-ileal bypass procedure. The patient was initially diagnosed with a drug intoxication secondary to benzodiazepines. Ultimately, the diagnosis of D-lactate encephalopathy was established after challenging the patient with a carbohydrate load. Thus, administration of 40 kcal/kg over 16 hours reproduced the clinical syndrome and was accompanied by a marked increment in serum and urine D-lactate concentration.

We searched for the optimal time for a static PET scan with FMZ as semi-quantitative imaging of BZR distribution. In 10 normal subjects, a dynamic series of decay-corrected PET scans was performed for 60 minutes, and the arterial blood was sampled during the scan to measure radioactivity and labeled metabolites. We generated 13 kinds of \"static scan\" images from the dynamic scan in each subject, and analyzed the pixel correlation for these images versus distribution volume (DV) images. We also analyzed the time for the [11C]FMZ in plasma and tissue to reach the equilibrium. The intra-subject pixel correlation demonstrated that the \"static scan\" images for the period centering around 30 minutes post-injection had the strongest linear correlation with the DV image. The ratio of radioactivity in the cortex to that in the plasma reached a peak at 40 minutes after injection. Considering the physical decay and patient burden, we conclude that the decay corrected static scan for [11C]FMZ PET as semi-quantitative imaging of BZR distribution is to be optimally acquired from 20 to 40 minutes after injection.",

Amylase activity was measured in each drop before and after rapid intravenous injection of caerulein (7.4 pmol/kg) or intraduodenal injection of L-tryptophan (1 mmol), sodium oleate (3 mmol), and HCl (3 mmol). All experiments were repeated in the presence of the M1 receptor antagonist telenzepine (81 nmol. kg(-1). h(-) iv) and the cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist L-364718 (0.1 mg/kg iv). Latency of amylase response (time between injection of stimulant and sustained increase in amylase activity greater than mean + 3 SD of prestimulatory activity) to tryptophan (17 +/- 7 s; n = 6) and oleate (16 +/- 5 s) was significantly (P < 0.05) shorter than to caerulein (28 +/- 4 s) and HCl (120 +/- 47 s). Telenzepine significantly increased the latency of amylase response to tryptophan and oleate by >10-fold but not the latency to caerulein or HCl. L-364718 abolished the amylase response to all stimulants. These findings indicate that the early amylase response to intraduodenal tryptophan and oleate is mediated by a neural enteropancreatic reflex ending on M1 receptors rather than by hormone release. However, the activation of (possibly vagal) CCK receptors is essential to run the reflex. The early amylase response to intraduodenal HCl is probably mediated by the release of CCK into the blood circulation.", 
    "93": "Opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore has increasingly been implicated in excitotoxic, ischemic, and apoptotic cell death, as well as in several neurodegenerative disease processes. However, much of the work directly characterizing properties of the transition pore has been performed in isolated liver mitochondria. Because of suggestions of tissue-specific differences in pore properties, we directly compared isolated brain mitochondria with liver mitochondria and used three quantitative biochemical and ultrastructural measurements of permeability transition. We provide evidence that brain mitochondria do not readily undergo permeability transition upon exposure to conditions that rapidly induce the opening of the transition pore in liver mitochondria. Exposure of liver mitochondria to transition-inducing agents led to a large, cyclosporin A-inhibitable decrease in spectrophotometric absorbance, a loss of mitochondrial glutathione, and morphologic evidence of matrix swelling and disruption, as expected. However, we found that similarly treated brain mitochondria showed very little absorbance change and no loss of glutathione. The absence of response in brain was not simply due to structural limitations, since large-amplitude swelling and release of glutathione occurred when membrane pores unrelated to the transition pore were formed. Additionally, electron microscopy revealed that the majority of brain mitochondria appeared morphologically unchanged following treatment to induce permeability transition. These findings show that isolated brain mitochondria are more resistant to induction of permeability transition than mitochondria from liver, which may have important implications for the study of the mechanisms involved in neuronal cell death.",

The authors investigated in a randomized controlled clinical trial if diazepam premedication would have a beneficial effect on side effects related to ketamine anesthesia for bone marrow punctures (BMPs) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Sixteen children 4 years or older at the time of BMP were eligible. The first 2 BMPs after complete remission was obtained were studied. BMPs were performed under ketamine anesthesia (1.0-1.5 mg/kg i.v.), as usual. Patients were randomized to receive 1 h before the first BMP blinded, either diazepam or placebo orally and before the second BMP the other way round. Blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation were monitored, and patients were observed for signs of anxiety, pain, and other side effects. The patients were interviewed after each BMP and asked for their preference 1 week after the second BMP. Ketamine anesthesia appeared as safe and effective after diazepam premedication as after placebo premedication. From the interviews and questionnaires, it was clear that half of the children preferred diazepam premedication because of less awful dreaming and more gradual falling asleep and waking up. Diazepam premedication may be useful for selected children with ALL receiving ketamine anesthesia for BMPs.", 
    "95": "There has been much debate about the nosologic forms of electrical status epilepticus during sleep (ESES) that can occur in a number of syndromes. The pathogenesis of ESES is unknown, and the natural course is variable. It is debatable whether these age-specific epileptic syndromes belong to the same spectrum of disorders with different severity but a common denominator of sleep-related hypersynchronization of generalized paroxysmal epileptic discharges. This report describes 18 children with medically refractory seizures, gradual deterioration in language skills, fine-motor incoordination, behavioral changes, psychologic and intellectual regression of different degrees, and the ESES phenomenon. Most exhibited clinical and electroencephalographic responses to intravenous or oral benzodiazepines, especially if initiated within the first 2 years of seizure onset. Seizure remission was nearly complete with cessation of seizures and marked improvement in language and fine-motor skills, behavior, and intellectual function in those with an idiopathic etiology. Therapeutic trials with benzodiazepines should be given to all children with the ESES phenomenon. Sleep electroencephalographic monitoring is recommended in all young children with epilepsy and language or psychologic deterioration so that the brain dysfunction can be reversed at a critical and vulnerable period of early life.",

The structure of sclerotigenin was established by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction study and by NMR spectroscopy. UV-guided screening for benzodiazepine production by other penicillia revealed that sclerotigenin was also produced by isolates of P. clavigerum, P. lanosum, P. melanoconidium, P. sclerotigenum and P. verrucosum. Sclerotigenin was detected both intra- and extracellularly. Apparently, P. aurantiogriseum is the only auranthine producing species in genus Penicillium.",

Devazepide did not affect the CCK level but decreased the pancreatic weight by 24% compared with BSA-infused rats. The BrdU labeling indicated that CCK-8S had no effect on cell proliferation. Immunofluorescence for the CCK-A receptor showed a decreased labeling intensity after CCK-8S infusion. The mean optical density of in situ hybridization labeling of the sections from CCK-8S-treated rats was decreased to 37% +/- 3% of that in controls. Devazepide did not affect the CCK-A receptor gene expression.",

Psychomotor performance of the patient was evaluated at these times also, by using the digit-symbol substitution test and Trieger dot test. Patients who received premedication with either midazolam or melatonin had a significant decrease in anxiety levels and increase in levels of sedation preoperatively compared with control subjects. Patients in the three midazolam groups experienced significant psychomotor impairment in the preoperative period compared with melatonin or placebo. After operation, patients who received 0.2 mg/kg midazolam premedication had increased levels of sedation at 90 min compared with 0.05 and 0. 1 mg/kg melatonin groups. In addition, patients in the three midazolam groups had impairment of performance on the digit-symbol substitution test at all times compared with the 0.05 mg/kg melatonin group.

The research was beset by problems of high attrition rates and short term follow up. Clozapine does seem equally acceptable to risperidone in the short term (leaving the study early, n=466, RR 1. 00 CI 0.73-1.37). For most other outcomes wide confidence intervals were obtained, which meant that it was impossible to judge whether the two compounds were equally effective, or whether one was in fact superior to the other. Olanzapine and risperidone seem broadly similar according to numbers of patients responding to treatment (40% reduction in PANSS scores: n=339, RR 1.14, CI 0.99-1.32). Olanzapine caused fewer people to leave the study early (n=404, RR 1. 31 CI 1.06-1.60; NNT 8 CI 4-32) and fewer extrapyramidal side effects (n=339, RR 1.67 CI 1.14-2.46; NNH 8 CI 5-33), although comparative doses of risperidone were higher than those recommended in practice.

The relationship between the prevalence and concentration of drugs and the culpability of the driver was examined using an objective method for assessing culpability. There were no significant differences between males and females with respect to culpability. However, there was a relationship between age and culpability: drivers under 26 years and over 60 years were more likely to be culpable. Drivers who tested positive for alcohol only, benzodiazepines only and the combinations of alcohol and THC and alcohol and benzodiazepines were significantly more likely to be culpable for the crash compared with the drug-free group. Conversely, a lower percentage of drivers who only tested positive for THC were culpable for the crash compared with drug-free drivers. This difference was not statistically significant. For car drivers in single-vehicle crashes, the majority of drivers were judged culpable irrespective of drug use. In multiple-vehicle crashes, car drivers testing positive for alcohol only or benzodiazepines only were more likely to be culpable for the crash compared with drug-free drivers. For motorcycle riders in both single- and multiple-vehicle crashes, there were no significant differences between the drug-positive and drug-free groups. A higher percentage of drug-free riders in multiple-vehicle crashes were culpable compared with riders who only tested positive for THC, but this difference was not statistically significant. There was a significant concentration-dependent relationship between alcohol and culpability: as blood alcohol concentration increased, so did the percentage of culpable drivers. When THC was used alone, there was no significant increase in culpability. For those drivers with benzodiazepines at therapeutic concentrations and above, there was a significant increase in culpability. The relationship between stimulants and culpability was not significant, although a higher proportion of stimulant-positive drivers were culpable compared with drug-free drivers. The combinations of alcohol and THC, and alcohol and benzodiazepines also produced a significant increase in culpability, but this increase was not significantly greater than that produced by alcohol alone.",

Alcohol was the most frequently detected drug. Cannabinoids were also detected at high rates, but the majority of drivers tested positive for THC-acid, the inactive metabolite of THC. Benzodiazepines and stimulants were detected at low rates, and detection rates for combinations of drugs were also low. Males were more likely to test positive for drugs, especially alcohol and THC, whereas females were more likely to test positive for benzodiazepines. A similar proportion of car drivers and motorcycle riders tested positive for drugs, although riders were more likely to test positive for THC.

During a 12-month period all patients admitted to a psychiatric intensive care unit were screened for catatonic signs using the BFCSI. Patients with catatonia were further assessed with the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS), the Modified Rogers Scale (MRS), and scales for associated psychotic and parkinsonian symptoms. They were treated with oral lorazepam or parenteral clonazepam and their responses evaluated daily. Neuroleptics were stopped for at least 3 days. Twenty four patients met the DSM IV criteria for catatonia, giving an incidence of 15% with a significantly higher proportion of non-Europeans. The most common associated diagnosis was schizophrenia (54%). Twenty two patients completed the benzodiazepine trial. All showed significant responses after 3 days of treatment. Sixteen (16/22, 73%) had full remission within 6 days, most within 2 to 4 days. Partial responders (n = 6) all had schizophrenia and were more likely to have longer pre-trial catatonic episodes. We find the BFCSI a simple and reliable tool to screen for catatonia, and our data attest to the efficacy of benzodiazepines in the treatment of catatonia.",

Here we present intracranial depth electrode recordings during a psychotic episode in a 20-year-old woman who was referred for presurgical evaluation. Unrelated to her seizures, she presented acoustic hallucinations and delusions and became agitated for a duration of 18-24 hours. During this period, a new unusual pattern of sharp slow waves was seen semi-rhythmically every 2-3 sec from left anterior neocortical temporal areas. Her condition responded well to a treatment with Haloperidol, but not with Benzodiazepines. Ictal and interictal scalp- and depth-EEG recordings outside the psychotic episode as well as MRI-based volumetry, PET, SPECT and neuropsychological testing gave evidence of bilateral temporal and frontal dysfunction. This case report suggests that psychosis in epileptic patients may be based on a bilateral cerebral dysfunction linked together in a pathological network, but with a focal (here: left temporal) driving mechanism.",

In study 1, eight healthy volunteers ingesting 600 ml/day water or grapefruit juice for 10 days took a single oral 0.8-mg dose of alprazolam on the eighth day. Plasma drug concentrations were monitored up to 48 h after alprazolam dosing together with evaluation of psychomotor function. Grapefruit juice altered neither the plasma concentrations of alprazolam at any time points, any pharmacokinetic parameters, nor the majority of psychomotor function parameters in subjects. In study 2, 11 patients with anxiety disorders receiving alprazolam (0.8-2.4 mg/day) ingested grapefruit juice (600 ml/day) for 7 days. Blood samples were collected before and during grapefruit juice ingestion and 1 week after its discontinuation together with an assessment of clinical status.

Further, performance on the DSST and immediate word recall was able to accurately predict family history status. Correspondingly, FHP women reported greater increases in \"difficulty concentrating\" and \"unmotivated\" and greater decreases in items such as positive mood following alprazolam than FHN women. In contrast, alprazolam produced similar dose-related increases in subject-rated and observer-rated drug strength ratings in both groups of females.

Drugs of all classes contributed to the increased risk, but the association was particularly strong for anticholinergics. Short-term use of other types of LES-relaxing drugs did not seem to be strongly associated with risk. The association almost disappeared after adjustment for reflux symptoms, indicating that promotion of reflux is the link between use of LES-relaxing drugs and esophageal adenocarcinoma. If 15,490 men in any age group take LES-relaxing drugs daily for 5 years, 1 additional case of adenocarcinoma would be expected (number needed to treat for harm); in men older than 60 years of age, the number needed to treat for harm is 5,570. Assuming a causal relation, about 10% of the esophageal adenocarcinomas occurring in the population may be attributable to intake of LES-relaxing drugs. Cardia adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma were not associated with use of LES-relaxing drugs.", 
    "163": "The widespread use of LES-relaxing drugs may have contributed to the increasing incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma.", 
    "164": "In the human central nervous system, the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor complex undergoes changes with both acute and chronic exposure to sedative-hypnotic drugs. These changes contribute to both the acute effects of these drugs as well as the chronic effects of sedative-hypnotic dependence, withdrawal, and drug craving. Clinically these chronic effects are difficult to treat in patients dependent on ethanol or benzodiazepines. Valproate may return the GABA type A receptor function to a state more closely resembling its normal function. By this mechanism, it is possible to reduce the symptoms of sedative-hypnotic withdrawal and relapse.", 
    "165": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurologic movement disorder that is often associated with a sleep complaint. Patients with RLS have an irresistible urge to move their legs, which is usually due to disagreeable sensations that are worse during periods of inactivity and often interfere with sleep. It is estimated that between 2 and 15 percent of the population may experience symptoms of RLS. Primary RLS likely has a genetic origin. Secondary causes of RLS include iron deficiency, neurologic lesions, pregnancy and uremia. RLS also may occur secondarily to the use of certain medications. The diagnosis of RLS is based primarily on the patient's history. A list of questions that may be used as a basis to assess the likelihood of RLS is included in this article. Pharmacologic treatment of RLS includes dopaminergic agents, opioids, benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants. The primary care physician plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of RLS.", 
    "166": "The temperature-dependent enantiomerization barriers of oxazepam, temazepam, and lorazepam have been determined between 0 and 30 degrees C by dynamic micellar electrokinetic chromatography (DMEKC) in an aqueous 20 mM borate/phosphate buffer system at pH 8 with 60 mM sodium cholate as chiral surfactant. Interconversion profiles featuring plateau formation and peak broadening were observed and simulated by the new program ChromWin based on the theoretical plate as well as on the stochastic model using the experimental data plateau height, hplateau, peak width at half-height, wh, total retention times, tR, and electroosmotic breakthrough time, t0. Peak form analysis yielded rate constants k and kinetic activation parameters, deltaG double dagger, deltaH double dagger, and deltaS double dagger, of the enantiomerization of oxazepam, temazepam, and lorazepam. At 25 degrees C, the enantiomerization barrier, deltaG double dagger, was determined to be approximately 90 kJ mol-1 and the half-lives, tau, were determined to be approximately 21 min. The new approach allows the fast and precise determination of enantiomerization barriers in a biogenic environment and it mimics physiological conditions, as no organic modifiers or abiotic chiral stationary phases (CSP) are employed.", 
    "167": "The objective of this double blind parallel-group multicentre study was to compare the efficacy and safety of the combination ondansetron + methylprednisolone + lorazepam (O + M + L) in the prevention of emesis induced by chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide or adriamycin . This tritherapy was compared to a bitherapy O + M. Patients included were suffering from severe haemopathy or breast cancer. They had to have an incomplete response to a previous antiemetic association of 5HT3 serotoninergic receptor antagonist and corticoid. One hundred and thirty-five adult patients were included and were randomised to receive : O + M + L or O + M for 3 days. The emesis control during the 3 days of treatment (no emetic episode during the complete course) was significantly superior in the group O + M + L than in the group O + M (69% versus 46%, p = 0. 042); nausea control on the worst day of the cure was significantly superior in the group O + M + L than in the group O + M (p = 0.04) with 76% of patients in the group O + M + L having complete or major nausea control compared to 51% in the group O + M. The stability of quality of life during the days following chemotherapy measured by one questionnaire, including two scales, one cancer specific (FLIC) and one emesis specific (FLIE), appeared significantly better in group O + M + L (p = 0.04 and p = 0.019). Safety of both antiemetic regimens was good and similar between the two treatment groups. This trial shows that the adjunction of lorazepam to ondansetron and corticoid in combination increases the antiemetic control for patients with an incomplete response to a previous regimen containing a 5HT3 serotoninergic receptor antagonist and a corticosteroid in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced emesis.", 
    "168": "We present a case of limb ischemia in a young man. For acute alcohol withdrawal, this patient was given chlordiazepoxide (Librium) through an angiocatheter inadvertently placed into a brachial arterial line. This caused severe spasm of the brachial artery and its branches. These findings were confirmed by angiography. Successful treatment occurred with intra-arterial papaverin.", 
    "169": "Several bioartificial liver devices have been developed as temporary therapy for patients suffering from fulminant hepatic failure. Some of these devices contain porcine hepatocytes entrapped in collagen matrices. In order to improve the function of these BAL devices, there exists a need to optimize metabolic function of cultured hepatocytes. The goal of these investigations was to evaluate the effect of altering culture conditions on rifampin-mediated induction of CYP3A isoforms in cultured porcine hepatocytes. Midazolam metabolism was compared in porcine hepatocytes cultured in a monolayer configuration on collagen gels, in a sandwich configuration between collagen gels and a Matrigel overlay, and in spheroidal cultures. The effect of culture conditions was evaluated, by measuring CYP3A-mediated metabolism of midazolam and by immunoblotting to detect CYP3A proteins, in control cultures and in rifampin-treated cultures. Results obtained by normalizing the metabolism rate data to cell numbers (based on DNA content) present at the end of the culture experiment, showed that there was no difference between the different culture conditions tested. Our results suggest that culturing porcine hepatocytes as spheroids or in a sandwich configuration between collagen and Matrigel, offers no advantage in terms of CYP3A-mediated metabolic function on a per cell basis compared to culturing on collagen gels.",

The immediate and delayed recall on the first day after admission (day 1) and 24 hours later (day 2) were rated. Each patient and the interviewer scored the patient's degree of sedation on a visual analogue scale. Patients also had to try to recognize, from photographs, the psychiatrist with whom they had spoken the day before.",

The PMS group provided prospective daily symptom ratings, which allowed ongoing investigation of effects of prior treatment. In the GAD groups, taper outcome was examined after 8 weeks of benzodiazepine therapy as a function of prior benzodiazepine use and as a function of time since last prior benzodiazepine use. Symptom scores were analyzed using t statistics in the PMS group and analysis of covariance with 8-week scores as the covariate in the GAD groups.", 
    "180": "The PMS subjects reported no increase in symptom scores and no significant difference from placebo-treated subjects during taper and discontinuation of alprazolam in the follicular phase of each treatment cycle.

    "182": "A column-switching high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the simultaneous determination of five frequently prescribed benzodiazepines: clonazepam, diazepam, flunitrazepam, midazolam and oxazepam was developed. A 50-microl plasma sample was directly injected into a BioTrap 500 MS (hydrophobic polymer) column. After a washing step with a mixture of phosphate buffer and acetonitrile, the retained benzodiazepines were back-flushed into a reversed-phase (LiChrospher Select B C8) column with a mobile phase of acetonitrile-phosphate buffer. The method showed excellent linearity from 50 to 1000 ng/ml for clonazepam, flunitrazepam and midazolam and from 50 to 5000 ng/ml for diazepam and oxazepam. The recoveries were around 98% for all the benzodiazepines studied. The relative standard deviation for between-and within-day assay was <20% for low concentrations close to the values of the limit of quantification and <4% for high concentrations. The procedure described is relatively simple and rapid because no off-line manipulation of the sample is required: the total analysis time is approximately 30 min.", 
    "183": "Intraoperative correction of preload in patients with acquired valvular disease (AVD) complicated by right-ventricular failure and severe pulmonary hypertension necessitates search for pathogenetically based algorithms of anesthesiological strategy. The objective of this study was to develop a strategy of assessing and treating the preload at the stage of induction anesthesia in patients with right-ventricular failure. During surgery central hemodynamic parameters and their response to a short head-down-tilt (15-20 degrees) were evaluated in patients (n = 42) with cardiac index (CI) less than 2 l/min/m2 after induction anesthesia. The patients were divided into 2 groups with different severity of preoperative status. Group 1 (main) included 24 patients with stages II-III cardiac failure (according to N. Strazhesko and B. Vasilenko) and group 2 (control) consisted of 18 patients with stage IIA cardiac failure. Progressing preoperative cardiac failure resulted in decrease of cardiac index and failure of compensatory hemodynamic mechanisms in AVD patients. The level of right-ventricular preload, pulmonary resistance, and stroke index were lower in group 1 than in the controls; however, 8% of group 1 patients responded positively to increased preload. In the control group 50% responded favorably to head-down-tilt. Hence, comprehensive assessment of cardiac index, central hemodynamic parameters and their response to head-down tilt help individually choose the anesthesiological strategy.", 
    "184": "Auditory evoked potentials (AEP) were recorded and analyzed in 12 children during general halothane and ketamine anesthesia. Ketamine suppressed the amplitude of primary negative component and eliminated secondary AEP components with latencies more than 60 ms, including N-200 and P-300 waves. By contrast, halothane did not affect primary components with less than 95 ms latencies and suppressed the latest components. Hence, ketamine suppresses the nonspecific afferent pathways and the brain structures responsible for memory and emotional functions, while halothane does not affect the afferent pulsation and partially suppresses emotional and mnemonic functions.", 
    "185": "Midazolam is frequently used for premedication in day-case surgical patients whereas clonidine is rarely administered for this indication. However, clonidine has several useful effects that make the drug an interesting alternative to conventional premedicants. Thus, in this randomised, double-blind, and controlled study the anxiolytic effect of midazolam was compared to that of clonidine. Furthermore, effects on postoperative complaints and minor complications, and readiness for discharge were investigated.", 
    "186": "100 ASA-1 patients undergoing wisdom teeth extraction on a day-case basis were included into the analysis. A further 50 patients who received no premedication served as a control group. General anaesthesia was standardised (propofol-fentanyl-isoflurane in N2O/O2). The anxiolytic effect of the premedication was assessed using the Erlanger anxiety- and tension scale (EAS). The test was applied before and after intravenous premedication with 1.5 micrograms/kg clonidine or 50 micrograms/kg midazolam and repeated once postoperatively. During recovery the incidence and severity of pain, nausea and vomiting, and shivering were recorded. The readiness for discharge was assessed using standardised discharge criteria. The recording of data was completed by a telephone interview on the day after surgery.", 
    "187": "The demographic data of the groups did not differ. In the two treatment groups there was a time-dependent decrease of anxiety and tension. However, postoperatively there was no difference between the levels of anxiety and inner tension between the premedicated patients and the untreated control group. Furthermore there was no difference in the incidence and severity of any postoperative complications. Time until the patients were ready for discharge did not differ between the three groups.", 
    "188": "The effects of an intravenous premedication with 1.5 micrograms/kg clonidine or 50 micrograms/kg midazolam, respectively in young ASA-1 patients undergoing minor surgical procedures on a day-case basis are restricted to decrease of anxiety and inner tension before surgery. No beneficial effects were found during the postoperative period compared with untreated control patients.", 
    "189": "In the cerebellum, infusion of NMDA (200 microM) for 20 min evoked a marked (200%) increase of extracellular cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels. The selective GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol (0.01-100 microM) was able to counteract the NMDA effect with an EC(50) of 0.65 microM; the inhibitory effect of muscimol (10 microM) was prevented by bicuculline (50 microM). Diazepam (10 microM) significantly potentiated the muscimol (1 microM) inhibition; furthermore, when coinfused with 0.1 microM muscimol (a concentration not affecting, on its own, the cGMP response to NMDA), diazepam (10 microM) reduced the NMDA effect. Similar results were obtained with zolpidem (0.1-1 microM). Finally, local infusion of the benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil (10 microM), together with muscimol and diazepam, almost completely restored the effect of NMDA on extracellular cGMP levels. It is concluded that GABA(A) receptors potently control the NMDA/nitric oxide/cGMP pathway in the cerebellum in vivo. In terms of the alpha subunit composition, we can deduce that the cerebellar GABA(A) receptor does not contain alpha(6) or beta(4) subunits because it is diazepam-sensitive. Moreover, the observation that zolpidem is active at a rather low concentration, in combination with localization studies present in the literature, tend to exclude the presence of alpha(5) subunits in the receptor composition and suggest the involvement of an alpha(1) subunit.", 
    "190": "Astrocytes and astrocytoma cells actively express the diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) gene, suggesting that DBI-processing products may regulate glial cell activity. In the present study, we have investigated the possible effect of one of the DBI-derived peptides, the triakontatetraneuropeptide (TTN), on [(3)H]thymidine incorporation in cultured rat astrocytes. Reversed-phase HPLC analysis of incubation media indicated that TTN is the major form of DBI-derived peptides released by cultured astrocytes. At very low concentrations (10(-14)-10(-11) M), TTN induced a dose-dependent increase in [(3)H]thymidine incorporation, whereas at higher concentrations (10(-10)-10(-5) M) the effect of TTN gradually declined. In the same range of concentrations, the specific peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) agonist Ro 5-4864 mimicked the bell-shaped stimulatory effect of TTN on [(3)H]thymidine incorporation. The PBR antagonist PK11195 (10(-6) M) suppressed the stimulatory action of both TTN and Ro 5-4864 on [(3)H]thymidine incorporation, whereas the central-type benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (10(-6) M) had no effect. The present study demonstrates that the endozepine TTN stimulates DNA synthesis in rat glial cells through activation of PBRs. These data strongly suggest that TTN exerts an autocrine/paracrine stimulatory effect on glial cell proliferation."
