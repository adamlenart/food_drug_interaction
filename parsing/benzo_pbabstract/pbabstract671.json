With this purpose in view the relationship between the amplitude of the vasomotor reflexes and the intensity of electric stimulation, as well as the nature of the drugs action upon the vasomotor reflexes, depending on the stimulation parameters adopted during their registration, were studied. The intensity and the nature of changes of the pressor vasomotor reflexes are shown to depend not only on the properties of the test drugs, but also upon the intensity of electric stimulation employed in the experiment during registration of the reflexes. The most adequate procedure for investigating the effect of pharmaceutics on the intensity of vasomotor reflexes, e. g. a study into the influence exerted by drugs on the threshold of the reflexes origination, is proposed.", 
    "1": "The effect of metanabol given to rats before irradiation (600 R) on exploring motility and cataleptic action of nitrazepam was investigated. The level of nitrazepam in the blood plasma and urine was determine. Most evident radioprotective effect of metanabol was found on 3rd day after irradiation. The drug inhibited the inhibited the increased response of the rats to the anticonvulsive action of nitrazepam and prevented the pharmacokinetic disturbances appearing in the course of radiation disease.", 
    "2": "Two twelve-animal groups of rats were trained to press a lever for food reinforcement under either a fixed ratio 20 (FR 20) or a fixed interval 2 min (FI 2 min) schedule. During the FI 2 min schedule a measure of adjunctive behavior (i.e., drinking) was taken. Each group was then administered various doses of chlorpromazine (2.5, 5.0, 10.0 mg/kg, P.O.), clozapine (2.5, 5.0, 10.0 mg/kg, P.O.) or diazepam (5.0, 10.0, 15.0 mg/kg, P.O.) in a random order. All three drugs reliably reduced FR 20 response rates in a dose dependent manner, but chlorpromazine and clozapine were more potent in this regard. Chlorpromazine reduced FI 2 min responses rates especially in the terminal portions of the fixed intervals while diazepam generally elevated rates primarily in the min-portion of the interval. Clozapine produced a less defined effect on overall responding. All three drugs affected index of curvature. Only chlorpromazine was able to reliably reduce occurrence of adjunctive behavior and reinforcements.", 
    "3": "Humans often respond to stress by overeating. A rat model of hyperphagia induced by a stressful tail-pinch has been described. Consumption of sweetened condensed milk by vaive rats was measured durin the stress. This milk drinking was prevented by pretreatment with d-amphetamine, chlorphentermine, diethylpropion, fenfluramine, methamphetamine, morphine, chlorpromazine and haloperidol. The benzodiazepines chlordiazepoxide and diazepam increased the hyperphagia. The relevance of dopaminergic agonistic and antagonist activities to anorexigenic activity are questioned.", 
    "4": "1 The comination of ethanol and diazepam elicits additive or supra-additive pharmacological effects in animals and humans. Since the mouse appeared to be a reasonably good animal model for man, this species was examined to determine if a biochemical basis for these effects could be established.2 The effect of ethanol (3 g/kg, orally), administered 0.5 h before [(14)C]-diazepam (5 mg/kg, orally), on the pharmacokinetics of diazepam in male Swiss Webster mice was examined.3 At 4, 6, 8 and 12 h after dosing, blood levels of (14)C were higher in ethanol pretreated mice than in vehicle pretreated controls. A tissue distribution study indicated that ethanol had similar effects on levels of (14)C in most tissues at 2, 6 and 12 hours.4 Both pretreated and control mice eliminated approximately 25% of the dose of isotope in the urine and 50% in the faeces by 48 hours.5 Biliary excretion was the major route of clearance in mice in which the bile ducts had been cannulated and ethanol reduced excretion at all time periods examined up to 12 hours.6 Oxazepam (the glucuronide in bile) and desmethyl diazepam were the major metabolites identified in bile, plasma and brain. Ethanol reduced oxazepam levels but increased desmethyl diazepam levels, suggesting that 3-hydroxylation of desmethyl diazepam was inhibited by ethanol.7 The accumulation of the pharmacologically active desmethyl diazepam in the brains of ethanol pretreated mice offers an explanation for the supra-additive effect of the ethanol-diazepam combination on motor coordination.", 
    "5": "On the basis of information abstracted from case histories, 41 patients who had experienced epileptic seizures thought to be due either to treatment with psychiatric drugs or to withdrawal from sedative drugs were compared with a control group of patients. Those who had experienced seizures were more commonly first born and had a history of post-natal brain damage. During the week preceding the seizure there had been a marked increase in drug prescribing. The implications for drug management are discussed.", 
    "6": "A rapid, precise, forward-phase (adsorption) high-performance liquid chromatographic procedure is presented for the determination of chlordiazepoxide and two common impurities, 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one 4-oxide and 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone, in commercial formulations and for the determination of the benzophenone in the chlordiazepoxide drug substance. The method involves simultaneous quantitation of chlordiazepoxide and the 1,3-dihhydro impurity, followed by quantitation of the benzophenone from a separate sample extract using a second mobile phase. A single microparticulate silica gel column is used throughout. Nitrazepam and o-dinitrobenzene are the internal standards, Quantitation is by peak area using a computing integrator, except that the peak due to the benzophenone is quantitated by peak height. The described procedure is of equivalent precision, but superior accuracy, to the BP 1973 spectrophotometric procedure for the analysis of chlordiazepoxide in chlordiazepoxide formulations. Quantitation of the 1,3-dihydro and the benzophenone impurities at levels as low as 6.3 and 0.9 ng, respectively, is demonstrated.", 
    "7": "The decomposition of a 1% dilution of nitrazepam in microcrystalline cellulose was established by quantitative determination of the two main breakdown products, 2-amino-5-nitrobenzophenone and 3-amino-6-nitro-4-phenyl-2(1H)-quinolone, using in situ diffuse reflectance measurements on thin-layer chromatograms. The decomposition and formation rate constant of nitrazepam and of the breakdown products, respectively, were determined at four temperatures and six relative humidities. By means of a three-parameter regression equation, it was possible to correlate quantitatively the decomposition constant of nitrazepam to both temperature and relative humidity.", 
    "8": "The effects of fentanyl (0.5 mg/kg iv), fentanyl with diazepam (1 mg/kg iv) and fentanyl, diazepam and pancuronium (0.1 mg/kg iv) on heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (BP), cardiac output (QT), urine flow rate and urine epinephrine and norepinephrine excretion were determined in nine dogs. Fentanyl did not significantly change QT or BP but did reduce HR and urine flow rate (P less than 0.05). Urine epinephrine and norepinephrine excretion rates were signicantly increased by fentanyl (P less than 0.05). Diazepam caused no significant further changes in QT, BP or HR 30 minutes after administration, but urine epinephrine and norepinephrine excretion rates were reduced to control (pre-fentanyl) levels. Addition of pancuronium after fentanyl and diazepam increased urine flow rate to pre-fentanyl levels and elevated QT, BP and HR above controls but produced no significant change in urine epinephrine or norepinephrine excretion. These data suggest that fentanyl increases catecholamine blood levels and imply that the latter may be one mechanism by which cardiovascular dynamics are maintained stable during fentanyl anaesthesia. Our findings also demonstrate that cardiovascular stimulation after pancuronium is not associated with increased urinary catecholamine excretion.", 
    "9": "Seventeen of eighteen patients hospitalized for active rheumatoid arthritis completed a three-day randomized, double-blind comparison of 100 mg indomethacin, 100 mg indomethacin with 10 mg diazepam and matching placebo as night medication. The results showed a consistent pattern in the four functions measured--pain, morning stiffness, sleep score and patient preference. In each, indomethacin proved superior to placebo and the combined therapy better than indomethacin alone. From this it has been concluded that the combination of indomethacin and diazepam should now be considered the treatment of choice for maximum control of night pain and morning stiffness in rheumatoid arthritis.", 
    "10": "Preparation of 4H-pyrrolo[1,2-a][1,5]benzodiazepine derivatives related to the antitumoral antibiotic anthramycin, a derivative of 5H-pyrrolo[2,1-c] [1,4]benzodiazepine, is reported. Reaction between 1-(o-acetamidophenyl)-2-dimethylaminomethylpyrrole iodomethylate and potassium cyanide afforded 4,6-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-a][1,5]benzodiazepine-5-one, which was then reduced to 5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[1,2-a][1,5]benzodiazepine by the action of lithium aluminum hydride. Some 6-acylderivatives of the latter compound are also described. The Vilsmeier-Haack reaction on 6-acetyl-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[1,2-a][1,5]benzodiazepine furnished the corresponding 1-formyl derivative which was then condensed with ethyl cyanoacetate to give the related compound with the acrylic moiety.", 
    "11": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with glomerulonephritis occurred in a patient with a long-standing neuronal storage disease and myoclonus. Intravenously administered diazepam was useful in controlling the myoclonus to permit a renal biopsy. The exact relationship between the patient's underlying illness and the development of SLE remains unknown.", 
    "12": "Ten healthy male volunteers received chlordiazepoxide (CDX) hydrochloride or matching placebo with Maalox or water in a four-way single-dose crossover trial. Coadministration of CDX with Maalox did not change the completeness of CDX absorption but significantly slowed its rate of absorption and the rate of desmethylchlordiazepoxide (DMCDX) appearance. Self-rating of feeling \"spacey\" at 1.0 and 2.5 hours were significantly increased over baseline for CDX taken with water but not with Maalox. Increases in \"spacey\" feelings at 1.0 hours were highly correlated with 0.5-hour but not with 1.0-hour blood levels. Similar findings were observed for self-ratings of \"thinking\" slowed down. Thus certain subjective effects of antianxiety agents after oral dosage may depend on the rate of drug absorption and may be attenuated or eliminated if the absorption rate is reduced.", 
    "13": "In comparing the neurotropic action of probon and amidopyrine it became evident that both analgesics inhibit the behavioral reactions of rats in \"open field\" tests, fail to produce any protective action with respect to the reflex reaction of the heart in response to pain stimulation and attenuate such an effect of seduxen. By lengthening the hexobarbital-induced sleep probon and amidopyrine change the EEG nature typical of the effect produced by barbiturates. The difference between the study analgesics is rather a quantitative one, viz. in many rests probon is more potent and its action manifestes itself in a wider range of dosages.", 
    "14": "The possible influence of food intake on the bioavailability of the anxiolytic drug oxazepam was assessed in eight healthy volunteers taking a single dose of the drug both on an empty stomach and together with a standardized breakfast meal. The serum concentrations of oxazepam were determined by gas chromatography on samples obtained before, and at numerous occasions up to 48 hours after drug administration. The results indicate that concomitant food intake has no essential influence on the bioavailability of oxazepam.", 
    "15": "Although pain and subsequent thrombophlebitis are complications in patients receiving intravenous (IV) diazepam, the mechanism and accompanying histology are unknown. To further elucidate the pathogenesis for this and determine whether it can be minimized, adult female rats received IV diazepam, diazepam vehicle, lidocaine, a combination of lidocaine and diazepam, or N saline solution, and underwent subsequent tissue light microscopy. Vascular tissue from animals receiving IV diazepam alone revealed marked inflammation with inflammatory edema and intramural polymorphonuclear-cell infiltration. Intravascular thrombosis and complete vein-wall destruction were also present in some animals as early as 48 hours after IV diazepam. Diazepam vehicle and diluted diazepam produced similar morphologic alterations. Lidocaine or saline IV resulted in no histologic alterations, while lidocaine added to diazepam did not reduce the inflammatory response. These results represent the first systematic morphologic evaluation of vein response to intravascular diazepam and suggest that it produces rapid and detrimental morphologic alterations. The dilution of diazepam or combination with lidocaine does not appear to alter these findings, and diazepam vehicle appears to assume a role in the production of the vascular injury.", 
    "16": "Diazepam is a valuable and widely-used adjunct to many inpatient and outpatient diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. However, the occasional and often unexpected delirium or coma induced by even modest doses of diazepam can be life threatening. Four cases are reported which demonstrate the prompt and effective reversal of diazepam-induced delirium and coma by the administration of physostigmine.", 
    "17": "A pilot study involving 36 patients was undertaken to test the efficacy of combining 1% lidocaine with 60% methylglucamine iothalamate for relief of the severe burning pain often experienced during peripheral arteriography. Of 24 patients premedicated with meperidine hydrochloride and promethazine hydrochloride, 12 received lidocaine with the contrast medium and 12 did not. The remaining 12 patients were premedicated with diazepam and received lidocaine with the contrast material. By both subjective and objective criteria, those patients receiving lidocaine in the intraarterial injection of contrast medium suffered less pain. Optimum results were achieved for the lidocaine group receiving analgesic premedication. No adverse reactions attributable to the lidocaine were encountered. Subsequent to completion of the pilot study, more than 300 patients have been studied with similar impressive results of pain relief and safety.", 
    "18": "Psychopharmacological investigations of the subjective state of being and the reactivity pattern of a group of 14 probands show a good agreement with the alterations of performance reported in the first part of this publication and with the data on polarity profiles. In addition to a sedative effect the interaction of alcohol and oxazepam in the oxazepam trial results in dysphoric changes of mood and related significant alterations of polarity profiles. A correlation of the changes of performance and the alterations of the polarity profiles with the respective blood levels of alcohol and oxazepam could be demonstrated.", 
    "19": "The effects of two muscle relaxant drugs of different chemical structures, parachlorophenylgaba and diazepam, were investigated in the sleep of normal young adults. Parachlorophenylgaba did not show any significant and dose-related effect. In contrast, diazepam induced clear modifications, including a decrease of stage 4 and of REM-sleep, an increase of spindles and a decrease of K potentials in stage 2, a decrease of rapid eye movements in REM-sleep, and finally a decrease of body movements. In addition, the recovery of REM-sleep upon withdrawal of the drug was much faster than the recovery of stage 4. These results add a new contribution to known differences in the pharmacological profiles of these two compounds ; for diazepam, the possible role of GABA mediated monoaminergic mechanisms is discussed.", 
    "20": "ID-690 was given at doses over 0.3 mg/kg, and increase in state of arousal and decrease in state of slow wave sleep were observed. Nitrazepam at doses over 1.0 mg/kg revealed similar effects. These agents increased incidences of paradoxical sleep at a low dose of 0.03 mg/kg. When ID-690 was given at doses over 0.3 mg/kg, the number and duration of incidences of paradoxical sleep decreased. Nitrazepam at doses over 0.1 mg/kg had a similar depressive effect on paradoxical sleep. These results suggest that these benzodiazepines have, dose-dependently, both facilitative and depressive actions on paradoxical sleep, and that the dose of these agents which affects arousal is not always the same as that which affects paradoxical sleep.", 
    "21": "There is no causal medical treatment of Meni\u00e8re's disease, further it seems very doubtful if it is possible to achieve a complete loss of symptoms by drugs alone. In spite of the fact that there are a great number of drugs being applied, there are some general principles in the treatment of this disease which should be followed. These principles are: 1. Improvement of blood supply of the inner ear by various methods. 2. Sedation of the patients to avoid physical stress, as it has clearly been shown that in many patients there is a correlation between psychical stress and Meni\u00e8re attacks. 3. Dehydration of the inner ear hydrops by osmotic diuresis or diuretic drugs. 4. Partial destruction of inner ear structures by intratympanally administration of ototoxic drugs or anaesthetics.", 
    "22": "Arterial blood-gas changes were studied in 21 healthy women undergoing laparoscopic sterilization with local anesthesia and supplemental IV sedation, employing CO2 as the inflating gas. No significant hypercarbia was noted. Two patients became transiently apneic following IV medication and 2 became extremely agitated during the procedure. This constituted a major nonsurgical complication rate of 19 percent. Safety requirements for patients undergoing this procedure is suggested.", 
    "23": "Presented in this paper are the effects of chlorpromazine, clozapine, d-amphetamine and diazepam on DRL behavior in rats. D-Amphetamine and diazepam, which showed similar effects on response errors, could be identified on the basis of burst responding and drug interaction. Clozapine, a new antipsychotic agent which does not cause extrapyramidal side effect in man affected DRL behavior in the same way as did chlorpromazine. Thus, DRL schedules are probably not useful in differentiating various neuroleptic agents.", 
    "24": "1 Daily administration of diazepam or bromazepam (10 mg/kg) for 22 days significantly increased the activity of mid-brain tryptophan hydroxylase by 36% and 39%, respectively. The concentration of tryptophan was also enhanced in the mid-brain region of rats subjected to benzodiazepine treatment.2 Chronic therapy with either of the two anti-anxiety agents enhanced the endogenous levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, pons-medulla, mid-brain and striatum.3 Whereas diazepam treatment decreased (13%) the activity of monoamine oxidase in mid-brain, bromazepam failed to exert any effect, suggesting that the observed elevation in 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid levels is not associated with enhanced deamination of 5-hydroxytryptamine.4 Discontinuation of treatment for 48 h significantly decreased the activity of mid-brain tryptophan hydroxylase to levels that were significantly lower than those seen for benzodiazepine-treated and normal rats. The concentrations of mid-brain tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptamine were also reduced in various brain regions examined.5 Withdrawal from diazepam or bromazepam therapy further augmented the levels of brain 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid.6 The results demonstrate that the depressant effects on behaviour of these agents are accompanied by increased metabolism of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the brain. Withdrawal from these minor tranquillizers, on the other hand, reduces the synthesis of this indoleamine.", 
    "25": "We reported on the haemodynamic effects of 0.03 mg/kg flunitrazepam during surgical procedures in neuroleptanalgesia in 39 patients with congenital or acquired heart diseases, functional class II-IV. The benzodiazepine derivative did not cause any relevant effect on the inotropic state of the myocardium. There were only minor changes in cardiac index, stroke index, right and left atrial pressure. Changes in arterial pressure and left ventricular pressure during and immediately after surgical procedures, and in arterial perfusion pressure during extracorporeal circulation, as well as an only short lasting increase in heart rate were demonstrative a peripheral vasodilator effect. The decrease in ventricular work and myocardial oxygen consumption are of value in patients with coronary heart disease, especially immediately after surgical procedures. Flunitrazepam is considered an additional drug during neuroleptanalgesia, when hypertension is causing some problems.", 
    "26": "We tried to determine whether short-term treatment with alpha-methyldopa, quinidine, digoxin, diazepam or furosemide--drugs in common use in hospitals--is capable of stimulating the activity of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzymes. Glucaric acid (GA) excretion and serum activity of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) were used as indicators of hepatic microsomal enzyme activity. Increased GA excretion was found in 45% and increased serum GGT activity in 40% of the patients on drug treatment. Only 14.3% showed an increase in both indicators. The excretion of GA rose significantly in patients who received drugs for less than 10 days, as compared with those who received drugs for less than 10 days, whereas the percentage of high GGT values did not rise significantly with increased duration of treatment. The lack of correlation between serum GGT activity and GA excretion casts doubt on the value of GGT as a consistent indicator of microsomal enzyme induction. GA excretion, on the other hand, seems to be a dependable index of microsomal enzyme induction in response to short-term treatment with standard doses of several widely used drugs.", 
    "27": "The safety and efficacy of 0.25 mg triazolam were compared to those of 15 mg flurazepam and placebo in 41 geriatric outpatients suffering from insomnia. The patients were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups. The medication was taken at bedtime for 28 days. Tolerance development was also studied. Triazolam was found to be significantly better than placebo in how much the medication helped the patients sleep, in sleep onset, in duration of sleep, number of nighttime awakenings, in quality (depth) of sleep, and in feeling of restfulness in the morning. Triazolam was significantly better than flurazepam in duration of sleep and was rated higher than flurazepam in all other variables. Flurazepam was significantly better than placebo in only two variables--onset of sleep and quality (depth) of sleep. Side effects were reported in each treatment group, and one patient on placebo discontinued because of side effects. There was no decrease in hypnotic effect over this four-week period, therefore, no evidence of tolerance development on either of the active compounds. Both active compounds provided the same amount of relief from insomnia after four weeks as they had after one week. Laboratory analyses and poststudy physical examinations showed no deleterious effects over the four-week period.", 
    "28": "Although anxiolytic sedatives are widely used in clinical practice, the methodology for assessing treatment effect of these compounds has not been well developed. The present double-blind study was designed to refine methodology for evaluating anxiolytics. Choice of rating scale, patient selection, maintenance of the double-blind status, the subjects' environment during the study, and the subjects' understanding of the study are discussed as considerations in reducing sources of variability and bias in the study of anxiolytics. After placebo prescreening, 14 subjects with diagnoses of anxiety recieved 3 to 6 mg lorazepam daily for four weeks, while 14 control subjects received placebo. The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) and the Wang Anxiety Rating Scale (WARS), with its Anxiolytic Adjunct Scale (AAS), were used to assess changes in anxiety. The Wang and Hamilton ratings correlated well at both comparison periods. Lorazepam demonstrated significant superiority to placebo and produced no serious adverse effects. Anxiolytic efficacy did not differ significantly among the four weekly ratings.", 
    "29": "An increased mean diffusion permeability across human chorion laeve in vitro was measured for meperidine (D = 5.26 x 10(-6) cm.2 sec.-1) and diazepam (D = 4.51 X 10(-6) cm.2 sec.-1). These values corresponded to large chloroform-buffer partition coefficients (49 and 29) measured for these two compounds. Diffusion permeability values of 3.98 and 2.18 x 10-6 cm.2 sec.-1 measured for urea and glucose corresponded to their relative insolubility in lipid, as indicated by chloroform-buffer partition coefficients of 0.05 and 0.0004, respectively. An increase in placental permeability in vitro to the weak organic acid 5,5-dimethyl, 2,4-oxazalidinedione at lower pH's corresponded to an increase in the fat-soluble nonionized fraction of this compound. These data support the concept that this tissue is most permeable to compounds of relatively small molecular size and/or with a high level of lipid solubility. The large diffusion permeability values measured for meperidine and diazepam suggest that these compounds will diffuse rapidly between mother and fetus at a maximal rate limited only by uterine blood flow.", 
    "30": "Hospital admissions due to acute barbiturate poisoning per million population in England and Wales have decreased since 1965 at about the same rate as NHS prescriptions for barbiturates. Admissions due to poisoning with other drugs have increased, but, largely because the benzodiazepine hypnotics and tranquillisers are much less toxic than the barbiturates that they are replacing, deaths from poisoning with all solids and liquids have decreased. The risk of death from self-poisoning associated with each barbiturate prescription has increased two and a half times since 1961, perhaps partly because greater quantities of barbiturate are being dispensed with each prescription and partly because patients for whom these drugs are still being prescribed would, in the event of an overdose, be unlikely to be found and admitted to hospital in time owing to their age and social circumstances. There is now little to justify prescribing barbiturate hypnotics or sedatives for anyone.", 
    "31": "Ten London pigeons were trained on a schedule which allowed concurrent measurement of motor and exteroceptive sensory changes. The task involved a conditional colour discrimination contingent upon the completion of a fixed interval schedule of responding. As a preliminary pharmacological study the effects of the benzodiazepines, chlordiazepoxide and flurazepam were investigated. Both drugs enhanced perseverative responding (after completion of the FI), and to a variable degree responding during the FI, although there was no evidence for an increase in responding during the inter-trial-intervals. On the other hand, no marked changes in discrimination performance were observed. It is concluded that the most significant effects of these benzodiazepines are on motor mechanisms.", 
    "32": "A combined thin layer and gas chromatography system was developed for qualitative and quantitative analysis of drugs in biological samples after extraction with heptane-isoamyl alcohol. Both acidic and basic extraction procedures were used. Special methods were used for the extraction and detection of salicylates, isoniazid, and morphine. Particular attention was given to the detection of psychostimulants; though these drugs have seldom been found in drinking drivers in Finland they are commonly found in Sweden. Two percent of all suspected drinking drivers were also suspected of concommitant drug use, which led to primary sampling of urine. Of 100 such drivers, 24 had blood alcohol levels (BALs) which were negative and 18 of that 24 had drugs in their sample. Seventy-six of the 100 had positive BALs and 25 of the 76 had drugs in their samples. Of the randomly chosen 100 suspected drinking drivers, 5 had drugs in their samples, and 4 of these 5 had positive BALs. The benzodiazeomes were the most commonly detected drugs. No stimulants were found in our subjects.", 
    "33": "Anthramycin, tomaymycin and sibiromycin are pyrrolo(1,4)benzodiazepine antitumor antibiotics. These compounds react with DNA and other guanine-containing polydeoxynucleotides to form covalently bound antibiotic - polydeoxynucleotide complexes. Experiments utilizing radiolabelled antibiotics have led to the following conclusions: 1. Sibiromycin reacts much faster than either anthramycin or tomaymycin with DNA. 2. At saturation binding the final antibiotic to base ratios for sibiromycin, anthramycin and tomaymycin are 1 : 8.8,1: 12.9, and 1 : 18.2, respectively. 3. No reaction with RNA or protein occurs with the pyrrolo(1,4)benzodiazepine antibiotics. 4. Sibiromycin effectively competes for the same DNA binding sites as anthramycin and tomaymycin; however, there is only partial overlap for the same binding sites between anthramycin and tomaymycin. 5. Whereas all three pyrrolo(1,4)benzodiazepine antibiotic-DNA complexes are relatively stable to alkaline conditions, their stability under acidic conditions increases in the order tomaymycin, anthramycin and sibiromycin. 6. No loss of non-exchangeable hydrogens in either the pyrrol ring or the side chains of these antibiotics occurs upon formation of their complexes with DNA. 7. Unchanged antibiotic has been demonstrated to be released upon acid treatment of the anthramycin-DNA and tomaymycin-DNA complexes. 8. A Schiff base linkage between the antibiotics and DNA has been eliminated. The comparative reactivity of the three antibiotics towards DNA and the stability of their DNA complexes is discussed in relation to their structures. A working hypothesis for the formation of the antibiotic-DNA covalent complexes is proposed based upon the available information.", 
    "34": "The excitation, fluorescence and phosphorescence characteristics of 29 compounds of psychopharmacological interest have been studied in ethanol at 77 k. Phosphorescence lifetimes are reported and the low-temperature luminescence spectra discussed. Luminescence characteristics of several important 1,4-benzodiazepines in acidic, basic and neutral solution are reported.", 
    "35": "The time-and dose-dependent uptake of chlordiazepoxide by the brain of rats was investigated and correlated with the blood levels of the drug. Peak concentration in the brain was reached in 10 min after i.p. injection of 25 mg/kg, and in 5 min with a dose of 50 mg/kg of the drug. Retention of chlordiazepoxide by the brain showed different characteristics dependeing on the size of the dose used.", 
    "36": "1 The effects of nitrazepam, glutethimide and placebo were assessed in a double-blind cross-over study with five healthy human subjects, using reaction time, and relating changes to drug concentrations in the plasma. 2 After glutethimide in all five subjects, and after nitrazepam in four subjects, larger doses led to higher concentrations in plasma and to greater changes in reaction time; one subject displayed the higher nitrazepam concentrations and the greater effect following the smaller dose. 3 The relationship between change in reaction time and concentration appeared to be mainly a within-subject dose-effect relationship, with the peak concentration in plasma as the 'dose' and the area under the reaction time curve as the effect.", 
    "37": "A technique of premiedication using oral diazepam and metoclopramide with a drink is described and shown to provide better sedation and less vomiting than pethidine and atropine given intramuscularly without a drink to a group of similar patients.", 
    "38": "Studies were performed to examine the effects of diazepam (DZP) on the biliary excretion of diphenylhydantoin (DPH, phenytoin) in the rat. One-hour pretreatment with DZP (150 mg/kg i.p. or 10 mg/kg i.v.) markedly suppressed the rates as well as the cumulative amounts of radioactivity excreted in bile after administration of 14C-DPH (70, 35 or 10 mg/kg i.v.). No changes in bile flow were apparent and the decreases in biliary excretion were not accompanied by increases in the urinary elimination of the drug or its metabolites. Disappearance of DPH from plasma and tissue were also reduced, and at 4 and 6 hours after DPH administration higher plasma and tissue concentrations were encountered in the DZP-treated group. The possible mechanisms by which DZP pretreatment altered the biliary excretion and the tissue distribution of DPH were examined; studies in vitro were correlated with the in vivo findings. DPH hepatic uptake and storage were apparently unaffected by DZP treatment, but liver/bile concentration ratios were suppressed. However, a direct competition between the two drugs for biliary transport was not evident. Further studies showed that liver microsomes from rats treated with DZP metabolized DPH in vitro less effectively than those from control rats. The metabolism of DPH was more markedly inhibited by the direct addition of DZP to the incubation mixtures in concentrations greater than 0.05 mM. Therefore, it appears that the effect of DZP on the metabolism of DPH is responsible for most of the observed effect although other mechanisms, including a direct effect on hepatocyte function, cannot be completely ruled out.", 
    "39": "Fifteen adults, hospitalized for fiberoptic endoscopy studies, were tested under two conditions using impedance audiometry. The first series of tests was conducted prior to the fiberoptic studies and sedation; the second immediately following examination, approximately 20 minutes after sedation with diazepam (Valium) and meperidine (Demerol) hydrochloride. Sedation with diazepam and meperidine failed to have a significant effect on tympanometry, static compliance, or differential loudness. These drugs were therefore considered effective sedatives for conducting impedance studies on difficult-to-test patients. This procedure is not recommended as a routine procedure and should be done only as a last resort.", 
    "40": "The effects of diazepam on reflex pathways in patients having complete spinal lesions and in patients having incomplete lesions of the spinal cord or multiple sclerosis are compared to determine whether diazepam has an action at spinal level. The drug produced no significant alteration in the excitability of the monosynaptic arc in the patients with complete spinal lesions. In contrast, in the group with incomplete spinal lesions or multiple sclerosis, diazepam reduced the excitability of the monosynaptic arc. This action did not appear to result from a reduction in fusimotor drive. Diazepam also reduced the tonic vibration reflex in this group. It is postulated that these effects may be due to a supraspinal action of the drug.", 
    "41": "7 patients (aged 15 months-72 years) were treated by intravenous infusion of alfatesine in varying dose depending on age and body weight. Treatment was effective in 6 of the 7 patients, 4 of whom had previously derived no benefit from standard treatment with benzodiazepines. Intravenous injection in 2 cases only increased the interval between seizures from 3-12 minutes to 25-40 minutes. No major side-effects were observed.", 
    "42": "Changes in sensitivity to anticonvulsant drugs were investigated after bilateral olfactory bulb ablations in mice. The sensitivity to benzodiazepines and acetazolamide increased, whereas that to phenylacetylurea and dipropylacetic acid decreased, and sensitivity to phenobarbital, diphenylhydantoin and trimethadion was not significantly changes after olfactory bulb ablations. Increase in sensitivity to benzodiazepines was the most significant in both electroshock and pentetrazol convulsions. It was suggested that altered activities and denervation supersensitivity in the limbic system, hypothalamus and midbrain might account for these changes in sensitivity to anticonvulsant drugs after olfactory bulb ablations.", 
    "43": "In a retrospective study, based on a biochemical survey of people aged 65 and over in a general practice, subjects taking a barbiturate preparation for indications other than epilepsy had a significantly lower serum calcium concentration than did those taking nitrazepam or diazepam. Ordinary doses of barbiturate may adversely affect vitamin D metabolism in the elderly.", 
    "44": "In six patients with cirrhosis and five patients with fibrosis of the liver elimination of diazepam (D) was compared after single and subchronic dosage. The pharmacokinetics of the major metabolite desmethyldiazepam (DD) was investigated in four healthy individuals and four patients with hepatic dysfunction and compared to its parent compound D. In the initial study, 11 patients with liver disease (cirrhosis and fibrosis) had a longer half-life (T 1/2(beta) of 99.2 +/- 23.2 hr after a single intravenous bolus of 0.1 mg/kg of D than to age-matched normal subjects (46.6 +/- 14.2). After subchronic treatment with 10 mg of D for 7 days T 1/2(beta) was prolonged only slightly (p = 0.043) in these patients (107.6 +/- 25.2 hr). Neither total plasma clearance (Cl) nor the apparent volume of distribution (VdSS or VdCl) showed significant changes. After intravenous injection of DD (0.1 mg/kg) plasma levels declined in the same biexponential manner as after D. The cross-over study in the four normal subjects demonstrated that DD was eliminated much more slowly than D. Whereas for D, T 1/2(beta) and Cl were 32.6 +/- 11.3 hr and 32.3 +/- 11.0 ml/min, respectively, the corresponding values for DD were 50.9 +/- 6.2 hr and 11.3 +/- 3.1 ml/min, respectively, the corresponding values for DD were 50.9 +/- 6.2 hr and 11.3 +/- 3.1 ml/min. The accumulation of DD after multiple dosage could be explained by the fact that it is formed faster from D than it is eliminated. In four patients with liver disease the elimination of D and the elimination of DD were altered. In these patients T 1/2(beta) for DD was prolonged (p = 0.015) to 108.2 +/- 40.3 hr. This prolongation was caused by a decrease in Cl of 4.6 +/- 1.1 ml/min, (p = 0.003) whereas Vd(Cl) did not change significantly. This indicates that at least two steps in diazepam metabolism are impaired in patients with liver disease.", 
    "45": "Effects of a new minor tranquilizer, CS-386, on the after-discharge(AD) and behavior induced by amygdaloid electrical stimulation in freely-moving cats were compared with those of cloxazolam, oxazolam, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, phenobarbital and chlorphromazine. Effects on change of the AD threshold and duration and on facial twitching, salivation and tonic-clonic convulsion were investigated. CS-386, cloxazolam and oxazolam inhibited amygdaloid AD. CS-386 had the most potent inhibitory effect. These drugs depressed all behavior described above. Diazepam had no effects on the AD threshold, but decreased the AD duration and inhibited the behavior. Chlordiazepoxide had no apparent effects on amygdaloid AD and on facial twitching. Salivation was inhibited with high doses of administration. Phenobarbital shortened the AD duration and at a high dose elevated the AD threshold. This drug also inhibited salivation, but inhibitory effects on other behavior required doses as high as 90 mg/kg. These results suggest that CS-386, cloxazolam and oxazolam are compounds belonging to a classification different from that of chlorpromazine. CS-386 in particular, is a more potent drug chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and phenobarbital and acts on the amygdala itself.", 
    "46": "Lorazepam, a new benzodiazepine, was compared with morphine for premedication. Ten patients received morphine 10 mg/70 kg i.m. and 10 received lorazepam 4 mg/70 kg i.m. Respiratory effects were assessed from the change in slope (S) and intercept (B) of the carbon dioxide response line, using a development of Read's rebreathing method. Morphine depressed S by 47% (P less than 0.01), but after lorazepam S increased by 27% (P less than 0.05), neither drug altering B significantly. In two volunteers lorazepam was assessed by both the rebreathing and the steady-state methods; after lorazepam S was smaller by the steady-state than by the rebreathing technique. The findings for lorazepam are consistent with the known effects of sleep on carbon dioxide sensitivity. Amnesia lasting 4-8 h occurred in all patients who received lorazepam so that pain and nausea during this period were not recalled, but no patient who received morphine experienced amnesia. We conclude that lorazepam merits further study, particularly where sedation without respiratory depression is needed, as in obstetrics, and where amnesia for uncomfortable procedures is required.", 
    "47": "The author has studied over 200 cases of asthenic neurosis. The ocular manifestations could be classified into four clinical types according to the dominant ocular symptoms. 58.34% of these patients were female and 41.66% were male. 78% of the patients were between 20 and 40 years. 59% were students. In 75% of these cases a raised retinal blood pressure as an ocular manifestation was discovered. The ocular disturbances in asthenic neurosis are present especially in persons who regularly work more than 8 hours continuously. The treatment consists of physical and intellectual rest periods, sedatives, tonics, and connective tissue therapy with extracts of whole eyeballs. In 80% of cases we had favourable results.", 
    "48": "The central hypotensive action of clonidine, infused into the vertebral artery of chloralose-anaesthetized cats was antagonized by several phenothiazine-neuroleptics (chlorpromazine, promazine, promethazine, thiethylperazine, thioridazine), by chlorprothixene and to a limited extent by haloperidol administered via the same route. Pimozide and some benzodiazepines (chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and flurazepam) hardly influenced the central hypotensive response to clonidine. The antagonism between clonidine and the psychotropic drugs is probably associated with central alpha-adrenoceptors, clonidine being the agonist and the neuroleptic agents the antagonists at these receptors. Virtually the same type of antagonism was observed in conscious, spontaneously hypertensive rats where both clonidine and the neuroleptic drugs were injected intravenously. The phenothiazines and also piperoxane effectively diminished the centrally induced hypotensive response to clonidine, whereas the initial pressor effect to clonidine was not reduced.", 
    "49": "The metabolic pathway of Pinazepam and Diazepam in vitro was studied with rat, guinea pig and dog liver microsomes using a chromatographic and spectrophotometric technique. Two main pathways were observed, N1-dealkylation and C3-hydroxylation. N1-dealkylation was shown to be the predominant reaction for Pinazepam in all the animal species studied, while C3-hydroxylation was the major metabolic pathway for Diazepam in the rat. No oxazepam was found when Pinazepam and Diazepam were incubated with liver microsomes.", 
    "50": "Most of the currently available antiepileptic drugs have a low therapeutic ratio and therefore a drug interaction causing elevation of the serum level of one of these compounds can readily lead to drug intoxication. Phenytoin, in particular, is vulnerable because its metabolism is dose-related and at therapeutic serum levels the enzyme system involved in its degradation is easily inhibited by concurrent drug administration. As multiple drug therapy has traditionally been practised in the management of epilepsy, clinically important interactions are common. Furthermore, most of the drugs used in the treatment of major epilepsies are potent inducers of hepatic microsomal enzymes and can therefore stimulate the metabolism of concurrently-administered drugs to such an extent that they may be rendered ineffective. The use of one drug alone is recommended, where possible, in the management of epilepsy.", 
    "51": "1 Seven normal subjects were given three different hypnotics (flunitrazepam 1 mg, amylobarbitone sodium 100 mg and dichloralphenazone 1300 mg) for four consecutive nights each. 2 All three substances improved subjective assessment of the ease of getting to sleep. Flunitrazepam was rated as better than eithr dichloralphenazone or amylobarbitone sodium in this respect. 3 The perceived quality of induced sleep was not altered by any of the preparations. 4 There was a disturbance of the subjective ratings of getting to sleep following cessation of treatment with dichloralphenazone, giving tentative support to the existence of a 'rebound' effect. 5 Dichloralphenazone produced an impairment in psychomotor performance as measured on a complex reaction time test following four nights medication with the drug.", 
    "52": "Favorable clinic experiences with an anaesthetic involving rohypnol (flunitrazepam) and fentanyl led to an investigation of the haemodynamic effect of this procedure in a group of 9 geriatric patients, aged from 86 to 95 years. Anaesthesia was induced with 0.5 mg rohypnol and 0.1 to 0.2 mg fentanyl depending on the narcotic effect of rohypnol, intubation was performed under relaxation with suxamethonium and long term relaxation was achieved with pancuronium. The patients were normoventilated with nitrous oxide/oxygen. The individual values of the changes in cardiac output and total peripheral resistance showed a great variation. There was a significant correlation between the relative changes in mean arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance (r = 0.69, p less than 0.05) but no correlation between mean arterial pressure and cardiac output (r = 0.09). This indicates that the pronounced drop in arterial pressure which occurred in 4 patients can be explained by a decrease in total peripheral resistance. Careful dosage of the drugs, in particular of fentanyl, and knowledge of adequate measures to treat a decrease in blood pressure if it occurs, appears to be a prerequisite for the use of this type of anaesthesia in poor risk patients.", 
    "53": "The hydrolysis kinetics of oxazepam and diazepam leading to a benzophenone product and a glycine derivative were quantified from pH 1 to 11. For oxazepam, two intermediates were isolated and identified, indicating a parallel consecutive reaction mechanism. The hydrolysis occurred uncatalyzed and demonstrated acid-base catalysis for both reaction steps. One intermediate was observed by TLC for diazepam hydrolysis. This intermediate, resulting from breakage of the azomethine linkage, was different than the major intermediate isolated for oxazepam hydrolytic degradation (amide hydrolysis preferred). Stability parameters involving rate constant-temperature dependence are reported."
