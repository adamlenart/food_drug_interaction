    "1": "The present study tested the hypothesis that intact and gonadectomized male and female rats might exhibit differential tolerance to the anxiolytic effects of diazepam (DZ).", 
    "2": "Following acute (3 days) or chronic (3 weeks) DZ exposure, all animals were tested on the elevated plus-maze and immediately sacrificed for analysis of corticosterone, adrenocorticotropin hormone, estrogen and progesterone levels in serum. In experiment 2, following acute or chronic DZ exposure, animals were treated with a DZ challenge dose on the test day.", 
    "3": "In experiment 1, both acute and chronic DZ treatment similarly enhanced percentage open arm time and entries, regardless of the hormonal status of the animal. The results of experiment 2 showed that both acute and chronic DZ-treated animals exhibited a significantly higher percentage open arm time than control animals after the DZ challenge dose, and males and females did not differ in their responses to DZ exposure.", 
    "4": "The findings from these experiments suggest that tolerance to the anxiolytic effects of DZ did not develop in males or females, and that the hormonal status of the animal does not significantly alter the anxiolytic effects of DZ following either acute or chronic exposure. Following plus-maze exposure, females had significantly higher corticosterone levels than males and acute DZ treatment diminished this stress response.", 
    "5": "Mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1) are the most common causes of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). We examined synaptic physiology in hippocampal brain slices of transgenic mice expressing the FAD-linked PS1 deletion of exon 9 variant. Basal excitatory transmission and paired-pulse facilitation in PS1 mutant mice were unchanged. Short- and long-term potentiation of excitatory transmission following high-frequency stimulation were greater in transgenic mice expressing mutant PS1. Mutants had enhanced synaptic inhibition, which may be a compensatory change offsetting an abnormally sensitized plasticity of excitatory transmission. Increasing inhibitory transmission in mutant animals even more with a benzodiazepine reverted synaptic potentiation to the levels of controls. These results support the potential use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of familial Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "6": "Over the past 20 years, several members of the 2,3-benzodiazepine family have been synthesized. Some of these compounds--tofisopam (Grandaxin), girisopam, nerisopam--exert significant anxiolytic and antipsychotic activities. Sites where actions of 2,3-benzodiazepines are mediated differ from those of 1,4-benzodiazepines. Binding of 2,3-benzodiazepines to neuronal cells in the central nervous system shows a unique and specific distribution pattern: their binding sites are located exclusively to the basal ganglia. Chemical lesioning of the striato-pallido-nigral system, surgical transections of the striato nigral pathway and the activation of c-fos expression in the basal ganglia after application of 2,3-benzodiazepines suggest that these compounds mainly bind to projecting neurons of the striatum. The binding sites are transported from the striatum to the substantia nigra and the entopeduncular nucleus. Recent studies on mechanism of action of 2,3-benzodiazepines indicate their possible role in opioid signal transduction since 2,3-benzodiazepines augment the agonist potency of morphine to induce catalepsy and analgesia, and their action is diminished in morphine tolerant animals. The possible biochemical target of 2,3-benzodiazepines is an alteration in the phosphorylation of protein(s) important in the signal transduction process. Agents affecting emotional responses evoked by endogenous opioids without danger of tolerance and dependence may represent a new therapeutic tool in the treatment of addiction and affective disorders.", 
    "7": "After direct administration into the dorsal hippocampus nicotine decreased the time spent in social interaction, without changing locomotor activity, indicating an anxiogenic effect. The possibility that post-synaptic M1 muscarinic receptors mediated this effect was examined by determining whether dorsal hippocampal administration of a specific M1 receptor agonist (McN-A-343) had anxiogenic effects, and whether the anxiogenic effect of nicotine could be reversed by co-administration of the M1 receptor antagonist, pirenzepine. McN-A-343 (0.3, 1.6, 3.2, 15.8 nmol) was without effect on social interaction, and pirenzepine (0.7 and 2.4 nmol) injection into the dorsal hippocampus failed to reverse the decrease in social interaction caused by nicotine (6.3 nmol) injection into this area. However, the decrease in social interaction after nicotine (50 nmol) was completely reversed by the specific 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY 100635 (0.4 nmol) after co-administration of both drugs into the dorsal hippocampus. Thus, the anxiogenic effect of nicotine in this brain region seems to be mediated by 5-HT1A, but not M1, receptors. In contrast to the effect of nicotine in naive animals, those retested after a second injection of 50 nmol did not show a significant anxiogenic effect. The theoretical implications of this are discussed and from a practical point of view this suggests caution in the retesting of animals after central injections.", 
    "8": "NPY exerts anxiolytic effects, which are mediated by activation of Y1 receptors in the amygdala. It has been shown that diazepam counteracts the anxiogenic effect of Y1 receptor antagonists, suggesting that NPYergic and GABAergic systems are coupled in the regulation of anxiety. We used a transgenic mouse model, expressing a mouse Y1 receptor-beta-galactosidase fusion gene (Y1R/LacZ), to study the effect of positive or negative modulators of GABA(A) receptors on Y1 receptor gene expression. Mice were treated for 14 days with diazepam (4 or 20 mg/kg), the anxiolytic beta-carboline-derivative abecarnil (0.3 or 6 mg/kg) and the anxiogenic beta-carboline FG7142 (20 mg/kg). Transgene expression was determined by quantitative analysis of beta-galactosidase histochemical staining in the medial amygdala and in the medial habenula as a control region. Chronic treatment with 20 mg/kg diazepam or 6 mg/kg abecarnil significantly increased, whereas FG 7142 decreased, transgene expression in the medial amygdala. A transient decrease in transgene expression was observed in the medial amygdala six hours after the acute treatment with 20 mg/kg FG 7142 but not with diazepam or abecarnil. No significant changes were observed in the medial habenula. These data suggest that modulation of GABA(A) receptor function may regulate Y1 receptor gene expression in medial amygdala.", 
    "9": "The effect of the selective dopamine D2 receptor agonist quinpirole, the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT and the selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin on catalepsy induced by atypical antipsychotics clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine and sertindole at higher doses was studied in rats. Haloperidol (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg), clozapine (50 and 75 mg/kg) and olanzapine (15 and 30 mg/kg) produced catalepsy dose-dependently while sertindole at doses up to 40 mg/kg failed to produce catalepsy in rats. However, sertindole (15, 30 and 45 mg/kg) produced a cataleptic effect in mice in a dose-dependent manner. At a high dose (5 mg/kg), risperidone produced catalepsy in rats. Quinpirole (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) reversed the cataleptic effect of haloperidol (2 mg/kg), risperidone (5 mg/kg), olanzapine (30 mg/kg) and sertindole (45 mg/kg). Quinpirole (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) reversed clozapine (75 mg/kg)-induced catalepsy. 8-OH-DPAT (0.15 and 0.3 mg/kg) dose-dependently reversed catalepsy induced by haloperidol (2 mg/kg) and risperidone (5 mg/kg) without affecting the cataleptic effect of olanzapine. However, the higher dose (0.45 mg/kg) of 8-OH-DPAT reversed it significantly. 8-OH-DPAT (0.3 mg/kg) reversed clozapine (75 mg/kg)-induced catalepsy. 8-OH-DPAT (0.15, 0.3 and 0.45 mg/kg) failed to reverse sertindole-induced catalepsy. Ketanserin (0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg) completely reversed catalepsy induced by haloperidol (2 mg/kg) and risperidone (5 mg/kg). Ketanserin (0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg) dose-dependently reversed olanzapine (30 mg/kg) and sertindole (45 mg/kg)-induced catalepsy without any effect on clozapine (75 mg/kg)-induced catalepsy. A higher dose (3 mg/kg) of ketanserin reversed clozapine-induced catalepsy. The present study suggests that atypical antipsychotics show fewer extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) due to greater modulation of the serotonergic system. Therefore, an antipsychotic with dopamine D2/5-HT2A antagonistic action and 5-HT1A agonistic action may prove to be superior to the existing antipsychotics.", 
    "10": "Classical emergency treatment of organophosphate poisoning includes the combined administration of a cholinesterase reactivator (an oxime), a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist (atropine) and a benzodiazepine anticonvulsant (diazepam). In subjects taking pyridostigmine and trained to autoadminister at least one autoinjector at the first signs of poisoning, classical emergency treatment ensures survival but only an antiglutamatergic compound like gacyclidine appears to be able to ensure optimal management of nerve agent poisoning in terms of rapid normalization of EEG activity, clinical recovery and total neuroprotection. All of this reinforces the therapeutical value of gacyclidine, which is in the process of approval for human use in France for treatment of head injury, as a central nervous system protective agent for the treatment of OP poisoning.", 
    "11": "The deleterious effects of ethanol on the developing human brain are poorly understood. Here it is reported that ethanol, acting by a dual mechanism [blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors and excessive activation of GABA(A) receptors], triggers widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing rat forebrain. Vulnerability coincides with the period of synaptogenesis, which in humans extends from the sixth month of gestation to several years after birth. During this period, transient ethanol exposure can delete millions of neurons from the developing brain. This can explain the reduced brain mass and neurobehavioral disturbances associated with human fetal alcohol syndrome.", 
    "12": "Because of its pain-attenuating and sedative properties oral ketamine has been used as premedication in children and adults. We wanted to compare in children scheduled for adenoidectomy safety and efficacy of oral ketamine with a premedication that causes similar preoperative sedation and relief of pain at the venepuncture site. We also evaluated the effect of i.v. glycopyrrolate added to these combinations.", 
    "13": "One hundred children between 10 and 15 kg of body weight scheduled for day-case adenoidectomy were randomly assigned to one of four groups: groups DG and DS received diclofenac 12.5 mg and diazepam 0.5 mg/kg rectally, EMLA cream at the venepuncture site, and placebo orally; groups KG and KS received ketamine 6.0 mg/kg orally, placebo cream at the puncture site, and placebo rectally; additionally, groups DG and KG received glycopyrrolate 5 microg/kg, and groups DS and KS received placebo intravenously. We recorded perioperatively scores (open scale 1-9) for stridor, sedation, bleeding, nausea, pain, heart rate, the need for analgesics and registered psychotomimesis and well-being at home.", 
    "14": "The children of the K-groups became more tearful during separation from their parents (P=0.0072). No other differences were found between the ketamine and diazepam/diclofenac groups before and after premedication until induction of anaesthesia. Oral ketamine produced unpleasant psychotomimesis in four out of 59 children. During the first 10 min postoperatively, the score for stridor was significantly higher in group KS than in the D-groups; stridor scores > or = 6 were seen in one child of the D-groups (DS) and in six children of the K-groups (n.s.), of whom three developed laryngospasm (one reintubation). Glycopyrrolate diminished salivation in all groups, but had no effect on stridor scores. Additionally, glycopyrrolate delayed the onset of eating at home.", 
    "15": "Premedication with racemic oral ketamine 6 mg/kg does not seem to be suitable for upper airway procedures. Addition of i.v. glycopyrrolate before the induction of anaesthesia significantly reduced the scores for salivation.", 
    "16": "To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intranasal midazolam in the treatment of autonomic crises in children with familial dysautonomia, intranasal midazolam was administered at the hospital to six patients during nine episodes of autonomic crisis. Treatment was successful in seven of nine episodes of autonomic crisis in five of six patients, with a mean interval to response of 9.25 +/- 1.25 minutes. The parents of five patients in whom the treatment was successful were instructed to use midazolam at home. At home, 16 additional episodes were treated by the parents, with successful control achieved in 14 (87%). The mean interval to response was 12.8 +/- 2 minutes. No significant side effects were observed at the hospital or at home after intranasal administration of midazolam. Midazolam, given intranasally, is effective and safe in the management of autonomic crises in patients with familial dysautonomia, either in the hospital or at home by the parents after appropriate instruction.", 
    "17": "The aim of this study was to identify predictors of treatment success and of relapse, 1 and 6 months after inpatient opiate detoxification in an 8-bed unit in Geneva. Of all 73 patients admitted between June 1994 and June 1995, a majority (73%) successfully finished opiate detoxification. Detoxification was performed mainly with methadone tapering; the average duration of hospitalisation was 15 days. Factors associated with treatment failure were: cocaine abuse, presence of legal problems, and short duration of hospital stay. After 1 month, 65% of the patients were using drugs (half of them were dependent again, half of them had used occasionally) and 35% were completely abstinent (21% when excluding those in residential treatment). Predictors of rapid relapse were cocaine abuse and little concern with own psychological situation at baseline. After 6 months, 50% were physically dependent again, 13% had lapsed occasionally, 37% were abstinent (28% when excluding those in residential treatment). Only high benzodiazepine use at baseline was associated with medium term abstinence. Addiction severity index composite scores had considerably improved between baseline and 6 months. Prevention of relapse to opiate use after inpatient detoxification, especially for those with a concurrent cocaine abuse, should be improved.", 
    "18": "Drug interactions occur when the efficacy or toxicity of a medication is changed by administration of another substance. Pharmacokinetic interactions often occur as a result of a change in drug metabolism. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 oxidises a broad spectrum of drugs by a number of metabolic processes. The location of CYP3A4 in the small bowel and liver permits an effect on both presystemic and systemic drug disposition. Some interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors may also involve inhibition of P-glycoprotein. Clinically important CYP3A4 inhibitors include itraconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir and grapefruit juice. Torsades de pointes, a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia associated with QT prolongation, can occur when these inhibitors are coadministered with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride or pimozide. Rhabdomyolysis has been associated with the coadministration of some 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors ('statins') and CYP3A4 inhibitors. Symptomatic hypotension may occur when CYP3A4 inhibitors are given with some dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, as well with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil. Excessive sedation can result from concomitant administration of benzodiazepine (midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam or diazepam) or nonbenzodiazepine (zopiclone and buspirone) hypnosedatives with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Ataxia can occur with carbamazepine, and ergotism with ergotamine, following the addition of a CYP3A4 inhibitor. Beneficial drug interactions can occur. Administration of a CYP3A4 inhibitor with cyclosporin may allow reduction of the dosage and cost of the immunosuppressant. Certain HIV protease inhibitors, e.g. saquinavir, have low oral bioavailability that can be profoundly increased by the addition of ritonavir. The clinical importance of any drug interaction depends on factors that are drug-, patient- and administration-related. Generally, a doubling or more in plasma drug concentration has the potential for enhanced adverse or beneficial drug response. Less pronounced pharmacokinetic interactions may still be clinically important for drugs with a steep concentration-response relationship or narrow therapeutic index. In most cases, the extent of drug interaction varies markedly among individuals; this is likely to be dependent on interindividual differences in CYP3A4 tissue content, pre-existing medical conditions and, possibly, age. Interactions may occur under single dose conditions or only at steady state. The pharmacodynamic consequences may or may not closely follow pharmacokinetic changes. Drug interactions may be most apparent when patients are stabilised on the affected drug and the CYP3A4 inhibitor is then added to the regimen. Temporal relationships between the administration of the drug and CYP3A4 inhibitor may be important in determining the extent of the interaction.", 
    "19": "Using 11C-flumazenil (FMZ) PET with correction for partial-volume effect, reductions of central benzodiazepine receptor (cBZR) binding can be detected reliably in vivo on remaining neurons in sclerotic hippocampi of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).",

    "22": "Significant abnormalities of absolute FMZ-Vd were found after partial volume effect correction in 5 of 10 patients: unilateral decrease in the amygdala ipsilateral to the EEG focus (1), unilateral hippocampal decreases and bilateral temporal and extratemporal neocortical decreases (2), unilateral increase in the temporal neocortex together with extratemporal neocortical increases (1), and bilateral posterior hippocampal increases together with temporal neocortical increases (1). In the three patients with extratemporal neocortical changes, the concomitant unilateral hippocampal or temporal neocortical changes were contralateral to the presumed epileptic focus. Significant asymmetries of FMZ-Vd between homologous regions were found in six patients. In four of those patients, absolute FMZ-Vd for the homologous regions were within normal limits, with two of the four patients showing relatively higher hippocampal values ipsilateral to the presumed epileptic focus. SPM analysis localized significant abnormalities of FMZ-Vd in similar locations in three of the seven patients in whom VOI analysis detected significant changes. In addition, SPM indicated significant unilateral contralateral hippocampal decreases in an eighth patient. However, both methods failed to localize epileptic foci in two patients identified by depth-EEG recordings.",

    "24": "The authors report a case of tianeptine abuse in a 30 year-old woman. After a medical prescription of the recommended dosage of 12.5 mg 3 times daily of oral tianeptine for a depressive illness, the patient spontaneously increased the dosage which after two months reached 150 tablets per day. No severe toxic effects were observed. As adverse effects, the patient, in the beginning of this high treatment period suffered from nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia with weight loss, constipation. These side effects progressively disappeared. The biological tolerance was excellent, and hepatic parameters were not affected. The patient experienced and seek a psychostimulant effect. After seven months of such a therapy, she was hospitalized to undergo a withdrawal. The discontinuation of the tianeptine treatment occurs in four days. A withdrawal syndrome marked by myalgia, and cold feeling was transient, and alleviated by sedative phenothiazine (cyamemazine) and myorelaxant benzodiazepine (tetrazepam).", 
    "25": "Zolpidem is an hypnotic drug that belongs to the imidazopyridine family. Its chemical structure is different from that of benzodiazepines though both type of drugs bind specifically to the same site of the GABA-A macromolecular complex: the omega 1 benzodiazepine receptor. This mechanism of action could be responsible for the predominantly hypnotic properties of zolpidem and its reduced liability to induce dependence in comparison with benzodiazepines. Yet, several cases of zolpidem abuse and dependence have been published recently. We report seven cases, from which three are detailed, of zolpidem abuse and/or dependence. These patients did not suffer from sedative effects of this drug despite important doses. We even noticed stimulating and euphorising effects in two of these patients, an effect that may explain at least in part the dependence to zolpidem. We will discuss the clinical similarities existing between zolpidem and benzodiazepines' effects. Furthermore we will discuss a molecular genetic hypothesis that may explain the differential effect of a specific benzodiazepine ligand on its receptors.", 
    "26": "Antipsychotic drugs are widely used in the long term treatment of bipolar and schizoaffective disorders. Nevertheless clinical trials devoted to the specific assessment of the mood stabilizing effect of these drugs are quite rare. Among recent studies only those by S. McElroy on olanzapine and by R. Bowden on divalproex have included mood symptoms as inclusion and outcome criteria. This paper reviews the different methodological proposals both in term of protocol designs (retrospective, naturalistic, longitudinal and prospective studies) and of efficacy criteria (time to relapse, reasons for drop outs, treatment switch, functional status).", 
    "27": "This study aims to describe the clinical patterns and therapeutic responses in 135 patients with dystonia. According to the classification, 54% were focal; 17.8% were segmental; 8.1% hemidistonia; 18.6% generalized and 1.5% were multifocal. There was a positive familial history in 5.9% of the cases. The treatment of the idiopathic dystonias is divided in: specific and symptomatic, and it can be local with botulinum toxin, or systemic with oral drugs. The most common drugs used in the treatment were anticholinergics and benzodiazepines, with poor responses in the generalized forms. Botulinum toxin A was the first line treatment for focal and segmental forms of dystonia. Meanwhile, the generalized forms of dystonia show poor response to the therapies utilized.", 
    "28": "The synthesis and psychotropic activity of 1,5-diakyl-1,5-benzodiazepine-2,4-dithiones (alkyl = methyl, ethyl and benzyl radicals) were studied. Alkylation reactions were performed in catalytic conditions by phase transfer. These reactions allowed us to isolate only one kind of product N-alkyl. Acute toxicity studies were conducted according to European protocols in two species of appropriate mammals in order to discover the lethal doses. The activity of the compounds on the CNS was then studied, using a battery of compartmental tests used in psychopharmacology. No toxicity was demonstrated at therapeutic doses. Each product had a sedative effect more or less pronounced and different from the reference substance clobazam (Urbanyl). They also had myorelaxant and anxiolytic effects, even lengthening the hypnotic effect of thiopental (synergic action).", 
    "29": "Declarative and procedural memory functions are related to dissociable neuroanatomic substrates. In the present study differential effects of pharmacologically induced changes in dopaminergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic activity in the brain on declarative (object and face recognition, immediate and delayed word recall) and procedural memory processes (compensatory tracking) were investigated. In a double-blind design, either 3 mg of haloperidol, 11 mg of midazolam, 1 mg of scopolamine, or placebo were administered to 80 healthy volunteers randomly assigned to one of the four drug conditions. Although all three drugs produced a detrimental effect on immediate and delayed word recall, recall performance was substantially more impaired by the benzodiazepine midazolam than by either haloperidol or scopolamine. While recognition of faces was affected by neither of the drugs, performance on object recognition was significantly decreased by midazolam as compared to placebo. Procedural learning was markedly impaired by all drugs but, again, the observed effect was most pronounced with midazolam. Additional analyses of measures of subjective activation, cortical arousal, and psychomotor performance argued against the assumption that the observed memory-impairing effects were secondary to drug-induced sedation. The overall pattern of results revealed that memory processes are much more susceptible to changes in GABAergic than in dopaminergic or cholinergic neurotransmitter activity. Furthermore, the present findings point to the conclusion that the modulating effects of dopaminergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurotransmitter systems on declarative and procedural memory functions are less specific than suggested by neuropsychological studies in patients.", 
    "30": "In-vivo neuroimaging allows the investigation of brain circuits involved in the experience of anxiety and of receptor changes associated with anxiety disorders. This review focuses on studies by research groups who have compared brain activation maps in different forms of anxiety and on binding studies of the benzodiazepine-GABA(A) receptor. Activation studies have revealed the involvement of many brain areas depending on the condition and the paradigm. However, the orbitofrontal cortex/anterior insula and the anterior cingulate are implicated in all the studies and may represent the nodal point between somatic and cognitive symptoms of any form of anxiety. Most studies of binding at the benzodiazepine-GABA(A) receptor are not interpretable because of substantial methodological problems, however, regional and/or global reductions are the most consistent finding in panic disorder.", 
    "31": "Pharmacological management of insomnia is continually evolving. The introduction of non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics provides an opportunity to understand different patterns of pharmacological activity with mechanistic differences in receptor activity. The impact of insomnia on daytime functioning and long-term health and socioeconomic status has been recognized. Epidemiological studies indicate that insomnia is associated with increased absenteeism and healthcare costs (although the latter appear to be partly attributable to comorbid depression). It will thus be important to determine whether hypnotics, in addition to their effects on sleep, provide other benefits for the patient that are related to these parameters. The successful resolution of this issue will require the adoption of additional outcome measures, such as effects on quality of life and healthcare costs. Recognition that long-term hypnotic use is widespread among insomniacs has prompted proposals for alternative prescribing patterns. Although certain hypnotics appear to be free of tolerance on prolonged use, caution is required in the long-term use of any hypnotic because of the lack of systematic data on chronic efficacy and safety. Therefore, alternative administration schedules (e.g. intermittent and 'as required') are being investigated. These may have very different consequences in terms of abuse liability and patients' perceptions of efficacy, and thus permit a more effective and appropriate use of this drug class.", 
    "32": "Between 1987 and 1989, the different protein subunits that make up the receptor for the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were identified. These make up the alpha, beta, gamma and delta families, for each of which exist several subtypes. This receptor is the molecular target of modern hypnotic drugs (i.e. benzodiazepines, zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon). In the 10 years that have followed this milestone, significant progress has been made in exploring the molecular mechanisms of hypnotic drug action. Receptor subtype specificity of hypnotics has been explained in terms of differential affinity for receptors containing different alpha subunits, which are expressed in different brain regions. Zolpidem and zaleplon bind preferentially to alpha1-containing receptors, whereas benzodiazepines and zopiclone are aspecific. Different sets of subunits are encoded in contiguous 'cassettes' on the genome, and the transcription of each set appears to be regulated coherently. The predominant GABA(A) receptor composition found in the brain is alpha1beta2gamma2, which are all encoded on human chromosome 5. Targeted gene disruption has provided clues to the physiological functions served by GABA(A) receptors containing different subunits. Receptors containing gamma2 appear to have a vital role in maintaining appropriate central inhibition, beta3-containing receptors may also be important determinants of excitability in certain brain regions, whereas a clear role for alpha5-, alpha6- and gamma3-containing receptors has not yet been established by these techniques. Site-directed mutagenesis has indicated that benzodiazepines bind to a cleft on the GABA(A) receptor surface at the interface between the alpha and gamma subunits. Other drugs (flumazenil, zopiclone, zolpidem) also bind to the a subunit, but interact with amino acids in different binding domains to the benzodiazepines. The molecular mechanism of hypnotic dependence has been explored, and seems to involve downregulation of transcription of the normally prevalent alpha1, beta2 and gamma2 subunits, and the reciprocal upregulation of the expression of rarer subunits. Chronic treatment with hypnotic drugs that may have less dependence potential, such as zopiclone and zolpidem, appears to produce more limited change in GABA(A) receptor subunit expression. These ideas will be important both for designing new hypnotic drugs with a better safety/efficacy profile, and for evaluating more appropriate ways of using the drugs available today.", 
    "33": "The paper presents an open noncomparative investigation of 36 patients with different manifestations of the syndrome of autonomic dystonia. 20 patients (group 1) had permanent autonomic disorder in context of generalyzed anxious disorders, 16 patients (group 2) had panic attacks. The examination was performed before and 4 weeks after monotherapy with xanax (1.5-2.5 mg/day). Clinical-neurologic study estimated both presence and a degree of manifestations of the syndrome of autonomic dysfunction, hyperventilatory syndrome and sleep disorders. Psychologic investigation included estimation of anxiety according to Spilberg's test, depression according to Beck's scale; SCL Scale was also used. Algesic syndrome was estimated by complex algesic questionnaire. Neurophysiologic study determined a contingent negative deviation and nociceptive flexory reflex. A positive therapeutic activity of xanax was established. The highest therapeutic effect was achieved in group 1 (83%) using lower doses (1.5 mg/day). In group 2 higher doses were needed (2.5 mg/day). In this case the effect was achieved in 83% of the cases, but full absence of panic attacks was observed only in 25% of the patients. Predictors of the drug's efficiency appeared to be short duration of the disease, slight manifestation of depression and absence of the algesic syndrome.",

Edman degradation of partially purified photolabeled peptides gave release of 3H counts in the ninth cycle of a tryptic peptide sequence. A second V8/chymotryptic peptide produced an impure sequence with release of 3H counts in the seventh through ninth cycle of sequence. The combined data support those previously reported, i.e., that the primary site for photoaffinity labeling by [3H]flunitrazepam is His102 of the bovine alpha1 subunit. In addition we also detected possible secondary labeling of Pro97.", 
    "40": "Native AMPA receptor complexes in the CNS are composed of hetero-oligomers of the GluR1-4 subunits, and generally contain the GluR2 subunit. To determine the contributions of GluR2 to pharmacological properties of receptor complexes, the effect of hetero-oligomerization with GluR2 on allosteric modulation of recombinant AMPA receptors was studied. The study of homo-oligomeric GluR2 was facilitated with a site-directed mutant of the pore, GluR2(R607Q), which allowed robust currents from this normally low-conducting subunit. The efficacy of the allosteric modulators was tested on homo-oligomeric GluR1-4, and then compared with hetero-oligomeric GluR1/GluR2, GluR3/GluR2 and GluR4/GluR2. Two selective allosteric modulators were tested, a positive modulator, cyclothiazide, and a negative modulator, LY300164. The results show that the pharmacological properties of homo-oligomeric GluR2 are not significantly different from those of GluR1, GluR3 or GluR4. The apparent affinity of cyclothiazide is not significantly changed upon hetero-oligomerization. However, the extent of potentiation of kainate responses by cyclothiazide is significantly decreased upon hetero-oligomerization. Hetero-oligomerization increases the apparent affinity of LY300164, a (-) isomer of the 2,3-benzodiazepine LY293606. These data indicate that although GluR2 has a dominant effect on the permeation properties, this subunit does not have a similarly dominant effect on pharmacological properties of native receptors. However, the state of hetero-oligomerization can alter the pharmacological properties of AMPA receptors.",

    "49": "The influence of diethyleneglycol monoethyl ether (transcutol), alone or in combination with propylene glycol, on clonazepam permeation through an artificial membrane and excised rabbit ear skin from Carbopol hydrogels was investigated. Drug kinetic permeation parameters were determined for both series of experiments and compared. Rheological characteristics, drug solubility and membrane/vehicle partition coefficient for each gel formulation were also determined, and their role in the formulation performance was investigated. Both series of experiments showed an increase of drug permeation as a function of transcutol content in the formulation. The combination of transcutol and propylene glycol resulted in a synergistic enhancement of clonazepam flux. A different trend was found in experiments with gels containing mixtures of the two enhancers, where an increase (in the case of artificial membrane) or a decrease (in the case of rabbit ear skin) of drug permeation was found by increasing the transcutol/propylene glycol ratio in the mixture. Such a result is explained on the basis of the particular mechanism of action demonstrated for transcutol which associates the increase of drug solubility to the potent effect of a depot in the skin.",

In the light/dark test, the strains could be divided into three distinct groups: two non-reactive strains (NZB and SJL), an intermediate-reactive group (C3H, CBA, DBA/2, NMRI, C57BL/6 and Swiss), and one highly reactive strain (BALB/c). In the elevated plus-maze, SJL, NMRI, CBA and, to a lesser extent, C3H strains of mice, consistently showed low levels of anxiety-related behaviours. Intermediate levels were seen in the Swiss and BALB/c strains, and high levels of emotional reactivity were seen in C57BL/6, DBA/2 and NZB. The strain distribution between the light/dark and the elevated plus-maze tests shows similarities and differences, suggesting that each of these experimental procedures represents a different set of behaviours. Marked differences between a number of strains of mice in their sensitivity to the anxiolytic-like action of diazepam were observed in both the light/dark and the elevated plus-maze tests. Mice of the BALB/c, Swiss and, to a lesser extent, CBA and C3H strains were responsive to diazepam in both tests, although in the case of CBA mice, effects may have been contaminated by behavioural suppression. SJL mice were largely unresponsive to the action of the benzodiazepine in both tests, whereas in C57, DBA/2, NMRI and NZB mice, diazepam produced positive effects only in the elevated plus-maze.", 
    "55": "The finding of differential strain distributions both with and without diazepam treatment in the light/dark and the elevated plus-maze tests, indicates that not all strains of mice are suitable for investigating the effects of GABA/BZ receptor ligands.

In contrast, no significant degree of generalization to the antidepressants imipramine and fluvoxamine and the putative antidepressants buspirone and flesinoxan was found. In antagonism studies alprazolam could be antagonized (almost) completely by flumazenil, partially by pentylenetetrazole, but not by methyl 6, 7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG-7142) and picrotoxin.",

    "66": "GABA(A) receptors can be constructed from a range of differing subunit isoforms: alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon. Expression studies have revealed that production of GABA-gated channels is achieved after coexpression of alpha and beta subunits. The expression of a gamma subunit isoform is essential to confer benzodiazepine sensitivity on the expressed receptor. However, how the specificity of subunit interactions is controlled during receptor assembly remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that residues 58-67 within alpha subunit isoforms are important in the assembly of receptors comprised of alphabeta and alphabetagamma subunits. Deletion of these residues from the alpha1 or alpha6 subunits results in retention of either alpha subunit isoform in the endoplasmic reticulum on coexpression with the beta3, or beta3 and gamma2 subunits. Immunoprecipitation revealed that residues 58-67 mediated oligomerization of the alpha1 and beta3 subunits, but were without affect on the production of alpha/gamma complexes. Within this domain, glutamine 67 was of central importance in mediating the production of functional alpha1beta3 receptors. Mutation of this residue resulted in a drastic decrease in the cell surface expression of alpha1beta3 receptors and the resulting expression of beta3 homomers. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation revealed that this residue was important for the production of a 9S alpha1beta3 complex representing functional GABA(A) receptors. Therefore, our studies detail residues that specify GABA(A) receptor alphabeta subunit interactions. This domain, which is conserved in all alpha subunit isoforms, will therefore play a critical role in the assembly of GABA(A) receptors composed of alphabeta and alphabetagamma subunits.", 
    "67": "Pyrethroids act on mammalian sodium channels, but we have previously shown that low concentrations of the type II pyrethroid deltamethrin also decrease the open channel probability (P(o)) of voltage-gated chloride channels. This effect would be expected to amplify the sodium channel-mediated signs of poisoning produced by pyrethroids. In the present study we evaluated potential chloride channel agonists in vitro, and then tested the most effective of these on pyrethroid-poisoned rats to determine the practical significance of chloride channel effects in vivo. Patch clamp experiments showed that, for voltage-gated maxi chloride channels in excised, inside-out patches from mouse N1E 115 neuroblastoma cells, ivermectin (10(-7) M) and pentobarbitone (10(-6) M) significantly increased open channel probability (p </= 0.01 and p </= 0.02, respectively), whereas phenobarbitone, hexobarbitone, mephobarbitone, thiopentone, and barbituric acid did not. This suggested that, if chloride channels were important in vivo, ivermectin and pentobarbitone should antagonize type II pyrethroid poisoning and phenobarbitone should not. Male F344 rats were then pretreated with ivermectin (4 mg/kg iv), equisedative doses of either pentobarbitone (15 mg/kg ip) or phenobarbitone (45 mg/kg ip), or solvent controls. This was followed by deltamethrin (1.5 or 2 mg/kg iv) or the type I pyrethroid cismethrin (4 mg/kg iv). Ivermectin produced a marked fall in deltamethrin-induced salivation (p </= 0.05) and also (in anesthetized rats) in repetitive electromyogram discharge and muscle twitch (p </= 0.01 and p </= 0.05, respectively). Pentobarbitone significantly reduced the motor signs score due to deltamethrin (p </= 0.01). Ivermectin therefore protected against the peripheral signs of deltamethrin poisoning and pentobarbitone protected against the central signs. As expected phenobarbitone had no protective effects. The motor signs produced by the type I pyrethroid cismethrin (which does not act on chloride channels) were not diminished by either barbiturate. The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor blocker PK11195 did not diminish the protective action of ivermectin on the muscle twitch (p </= 0.05), although it partially reversed the block of salivation (p </= 0.05). These results support the hypothesis that the voltage-dependent chloride channel is a toxicologically significant additional site of action for deltamethrin and that the use of chloride channel agonists can provide a rationale for a novel and effective therapy against type II pyrethroid poisoning.", 
    "68": "When designing an extracorporeal hybrid liver support device, special attention should be paid to providing the architectural basis for reconstructing a proper cellular microenvironment that ensures highest and prolonged functional activity of the liver cells. The common goal is to achieve high cell density culture and to design the bioreactor for full-scale primary liver cell cultures under adequate mass transfer conditions. An important aim of this study was to evaluate the biochemical performance of a flat membrane bioreactor that permits high-density hepatocyte culture and simultaneously to culture cells under sufficient oxygenation availability conditions comparable to the in vivo-like microenvironment. In such a bioreactor pig liver cells were cultured within an extracellular matrix between oxygen-permeable flat-sheet membranes. In this investigation we used a novel scaled-up prototype consisting of up to 20 modules in a parallel mode. Each module was seeded with 2 x 10(8) cells. Microscopic examination of the hepatocytes revealed morphological characteristics as found in vivo. Cell concentration increased in the first days of culture, as indicated by DNA measurements. The performance of the bioreactor was monitored for 18 days in terms of albumin synthesis, urea synthesis, ammonia elimination, and diazepam metabolism. The ability of the hepatocytes to synthesize albumin and urea increased during the first days of culture. Higher rates of albumin synthesis were obtained at day 9 and remained at a value of 1.41 pg/h/cell until day 18 of culture. The rate of urea synthesis increased from 23 ng/h/cell to 28 ng/h/cell and then remained constant. Cells eliminated ammonia at a rate of about 56 pg/h/cell, which was constant over the experimental period. Hepatocytes in the bioreactor metabolized diazepam and generated three different metabolites: nordiazepam, temazepam, and oxazepam. The production of such metabolites was sustained until 18 days of culture. These results demonstrated that the scale-up of the bioreactor was assessed, and it could be demonstrated that the device design aimed at the reconstruction of the liver-specific tissue architecture supported the expression of liver-specific functions of primary pig liver cells.", 
    "69": "A commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) was evaluated as a screening procedure for the detection of nine classes of abused drugs in postmortem blood and tissue specimens. Specifically, postmortem blood, fluid and/or tissue homogenates were screened for amphetamine (AMP), methamphetamine (MET), barbiturates (BARB), benzodiazepines (BZD), cannabinoids (CNB), cocaine (benzoylecgonine; BE), morphine-specific (MOR), opiates (class; OPI), phencyclidine (PCP) and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) by ELISA and by coated tube radioimmunoassay (CTR) (BARB, BE, OPI, PCP, LSD) or double-antibody radioimmunoassay (DAR) (AMP/METH, BZD, CNB). Specimens that screened 'positive' by any method were confirmed and quantitated by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The only assay that appeared to perform less optimally than RIA was the MOR assay (five false negatives). However, this assay is very specific for free morphine while the GC/MS confirmation method provided a total morphine value. The OPI assay was more sensitive, producing fewer false negatives, and is recommended for broad class opiate screening. EIA is an adequate alternative to RIA for screening postmortem specimens, including blood and tissue, for nine major classes of drugs.", 
    "70": "Tamoxifen (TAM) is used in the treatment of breast cancer and decreases the incidence of breast cancer when given to healthy women for different therapeutic purposes. This expansion of its use calls for further studies of its own potential side effects and those in combination with other prescription drugs. Diazepam (DP) is one such drug normally administered to patients who are under cancer treatment and those who suffer from insomnia. The present study examines the effect of individual and simultaneous administration of TAM and DP at therapeutic dose level of 0.8 mg/Kg/day of TAM and 0.3 mg/Kg/day of DP to normal female Wistar rats for a period of 12 weeks. The drugs were administered orally by mixing it in pellet made by wheat dough. There was no significant change in the terminal body weight and liver weights of animals. The ovary weights in TAM + DP treated animals were significantly decreased. The serum succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) levels were significantly lower in TAM, DP and TAM + DP treated rats and comparatively were lowest in TAM and TAM + DP treated animal groups. Serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT), acid and alkaline phosphatase (ACP & ALP) levels were significantly higher in the three treated groups, but comparatively lower in TAM + DP treated animals when compared to TAM or DP alone treated rats. There was marked increase in liver triglyceride and cholesterol levels in the three treated groups but remarkable decrease in liver glycogen. Total serum cholesterol levels were significantly high in DP and TAM + DP treated rats and total serum triglyceride levels were significantly high only in TAM treated rats. As a whole it can be concluded that DP does not enhance TAM toxicity on simultaneous administration, but on its own when administered individually brings about perturbation in lipid storage and metabolism.", 
    "71": "With the current and ever-growing offering of reagents along with the vast palette of organic reactions, virtual libraries accessible to combinatorial chemists have dramatically increased in size. Yet, extracting representative subsets for experimentation is an essential step in the design of combinatorial libraries. There has been some controversy whether it is necessary to consider product properties, at some computational expense, or whether sufficiently representative sets can be identified from considerations of the reagent space alone. This study compares the efficiency of reagent-based selections and that of product-based combinatorial subsetting in the identification of representative library subsets. Quantitative estimates reported herein show that the advantage of working in product space is descriptor dependent. For some descriptors, product-based approaches provide a distinct advantage, whereas for others results from reactant pools offer comparable results. Hence the behavior of descriptors, in mapping diversity from reagent space to product space, should be investigated prior to embarking into lengthy product-based considerations. Several classes of descriptors are studied including two-dimensional fingerprints (ISIS and Daylight) and physicochemical descriptors.", 
    "72": "We report the cases of two patients who developed prolonged sedation after routine doses of clorazepam for alcohol withdrawal syndrome. They required prolonged mechanical ventilation (10 days for both patients) followed by continuous flumazenil infusion (16 days for one patient and 3 days for the other) to avoid reintubation. In the two patients, nordazepam accumulation (main active metabolite of clorazepam) was demonstrated as the cause of the coma. This accumulation could be attributed, in one case, to impaired hepatic cytochrome P 450 3A4 activity. Caution is required when prescribing benzodiazepines to alcoholic patients and the use of benzodiazepine which do not undergo hepatic oxidation by cytochrome P 450 such as oxazepam or lorazepam is suggested.", 
    "73": "The CREM gene encodes both activators and repressors of cAMP-induced transcription. Inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) isoforms are generated upon activation of an alternative, intronic promoter within the CREM gene. ICER is proposed to down-regulate both its own expression and the expression of other genes that contain cAMP-responsive elements such as a number of growth factors. Thus, ICER has been postulated to play a role in proliferation and differentiation. Here we show that ICER gene expression is induced by gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and epidermal growth factor in AR42J cells. The time course of gastrin- and CCK-mediated ICER induction is rapid and transient, similar to forskolin- and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced ICER expression. The specific CCK-B receptor antagonist L740,093 blocks the gastrin but not the CCK response, indicating that both the CCK-B and the CCK-A receptor can mediate ICER gene activation. Noteworthy, CREB is constitutively phosphorylated at Ser-133 in AR42J cells, and ICER induction proceeds in the absence of increased CREB Ser(P)-133. Gastrin-mediated ICER induction was not reduced in the presence of the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89, indicating a protein kinase A-independent mechanism. This is the first report on ICER inducibility via G(q)/G(11) protein-coupled receptors.", 
    "74": "Male Wistar rats (120-230 g) were used in these experiments. Some rats were deprived of water for 48 h before testing in a conflict procedure. Then, after 20 licks from a water bottle with a metal drinking tube, the animal received an electric shock (0.5 mA/500 msec). The effects of two classical anxiolytic drugs, DIAZ (1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mg/Kg b.wt), and CDP (5.0 and 10.0 mg/Kg b.wt) were compared to those produced by MEL (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/Kg b.wt), 5-MTOPHOL (1.0 and 2.0 mg/Kg b.wt), 5-HTOPHOL (1.0 and 2.0 mg/Kg b.wt) and vehicle solution. Anxiolytic drugs as well as MEL produced a dose-dependent increase in the number of shocks received. The results suggest that the three pineal indoles are involved in the modulation of the stress responses. MEL showed a higher potency than the other indoles.", 
    "75": "Effects of housing condition and individual disposition on dopaminergically and GABAergically influenced open field locomotion and neurochemistry were studied in mice. Mice characterized as high active (HAM) and low active (LAM) by a running-wheel test were housed in groups or isolated for 1 day, 1 week, 3, 6, 12 or 18 weeks before an open field test was performed with saline, apomorphine (0.75 mg/kg) or diazepam (1.00 mg/kg) administration. Immediately afterwards animals were decapitated and brain sections were frozen for subsequent HPLC-analysis of dopaminergic and serotonergic transmitter metabolism. Principal component factor analysis (PCA) of locomotion variables provided three factors explaining 78.5% of total variance. Variables related to the amount of locomotion loaded highly on Factor 1 (F1-Activity), variables related to place utilization loaded highly on Factor 2 (F2-Exploration) and variables related to immobility and place preference loaded highly on Factor 3 (F3-Irritation). Apomorphine decreased F1-Activity with smaller effects in HAM and without changes in F2-Exploration and F3-Irritation independent on housing conditions. Diazepam exerted a decrease in F2-Exploration with a small increase in FI-Activity and no effects in F3-Irritation. Diazepam induced changes depended on housing conditions and were especially pronounced in isolated HAM. PCA of considerable locomotion and neurochemical data revealed interrelationships between striatal dopamine metabolism and F1-Activity, between cortical dopamine and serotonin metabolism and F2-Exploration as well as between cerebellar, hippocampal and striatal serotonin metabolism and F3-Irritation. The authors concluded that the application of PCA is a useful method to provide functionally relevant characteristics of behaviors and functionally relevant descriptions of interrrelationships between behavior and appropriate central nervous mechanisms. Furthermore the received behavioral characteristics (F1, F2, F3) of open field locomotion were sensitive to reveal housing and drug effects.", 
    "76": "1. A method for the isolation and cultivation of porcine hepatocytes and porcine duodenal enterocytes for the investigation of drug oxidation reactions has been established. 2. Hepatocytes as well as enterocytes metabolized ethoxyresorufin (EROD) and ethoxycoumarin (ECOD) effectively, the rate being 31+/-17 pmol/h x dish (EROD) and 9530+/-4062 pmol/h x dish (ECOD) in the case of hepatocytes, and 9+/-4 pmol/h x dish (EROD) and 510+/-467 pmol/h x dish (ECOD) in the case of enterocytes. Diazepam, another CYP monooxygenase substrate, was also metabolized by porcine hepatocytes but not with porcine enterocytes, thus indicating differences in the metabolic competence of the liver and the gut. 3. The ability to induce enzymes responsible for the metabolism of ethoxyresorufin and ethoxycoumarin was investigated in vitro on treatment of the cell cultures with either 50 microM 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) or 50 microM beta-naphthoflavone (beta-NF). With enterocyte cultures, ECOD activity was inducible up to 20-fold, whereas EROD remained unchanged following treatment with either 3-MC or beta-NF. 4. Western blotting provided additional evidence for the expression of CYP1A1 and CYP3A4 at the protein level and treatment of cultured enterocytes with 30 microM Aroclor 1254 or 50 microM beta-NF resulted in enhanced expression of the CYP1A protein, and CYP3A4 protein expression was induced following treatment with 50 microM DEX, 2 mM PB, 30 microM Aroclor 1254 or 50 microM beta-NF. 5. The metabolism of diazepam was also investigated with baculovirus-expressed human CYP enzymes (2C8, 2C9-ARG, 2C9-CYS, 2C19, 3A4, 3A4+cytochrome b5 and 3A5) and evidence was obtained to suggest the formation of temazepam and oxazepam by enzymes of the CYP3A subfamily. Small amounts (32+/-12 ng/ml) of desmethyldiazepam were additionally recovered in microsomal preparations of all CYP-transfected cell lines. 6. In conclusion, porcine duodenal enterocytes can successfully be cultured for a short period and may be used as a tool for studying intestinal metabolism, whereas porcine hepatocytes can be cultured for prolonged periods (>10 days) reliably to investigate hepatic drug oxidation reactions.", 
    "77": "We investigated 11 patients with moyamoya disease about 123I-Iomazenil kinetics in the brain using three-compartment, two-parameter model. The transition rate constant (K1) from the blood to the brain and the binding potential (BP) of the benzodiazepine to the receptors were calculated for every ROI (right and left side of cerebellum, frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe and temporal lobe; 10 ROIs a case). The K1 value correlated with BP value significantly, but not so closely (r = 0.639). And there is no significant difference in BP value among low-K1 group (mean (of K1) -S.D. < or = K1 < or = mean) and high-K1 group (mean < K1 < or = mean + S.D.). This means that CBF and BP do not correlate closely in the average Moyamoya disease patients. And we showed a case with IMP/IMZ discrepancy. The nerve cell in the hypoperfused area which has almost normal BP value is ischemic but viable. IMZ-SPECT presents an important information about the viability of the hypoperfused area in Moyamoya disease patients' brain.",

There was a significantly higher prevalence of alcohol intoxication in the group not involved in a road traffic accident (RTA) compared with the group who were involved in a RTA. Initial screening of urine for drugs revealed a prevalence of 51%. After 12 exclusions due to iatrogenic administration of opiates, the final confirmed prevalence was 35% in this trauma population. The individual drug prevalence was 13% for cannabinoids, 11% for codeine, 8% for morphine, 6% for amphetamine, 6% for benzodiazepines, 3% for cocaine, 1% for dihydrocodeine, and 1% for methadone.", 
    "82": "There is a notable prevalence of drug and alcohol use in this British accident and emergency trauma population. A significantly higher prevalence for alcohol intoxication was found in the non-RTA group compared with the RTA group. The patterns of drug usage detected reflect local influences and less cocaine use is seen compared with American studies. The association between alcohol, drugs, and trauma, together with ethically acceptable methods of screening, are discussed.", 
    "83": "The protective effect of 2-(4-chlorobenzoylamino)-3-[2(1H)-quinolinon-4-yl]-propionic acid (rebamipide) on gastric mucosa is well established. Here we demonstrate that rebamipide acts on pancreatic acinar cells to generate oscillations of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) through the activation of cholecystokinin subtype 1 (CCK(1)) receptors. At concentrations higher than 5 microM, rebamipide induced [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations in individual fura-2-loaded pancreatic acinar cells. The frequency of oscillations increased with increasing concentrations of rebamipide, while the latency between stimulation of cells and initiation of [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations decreased with increasing concentration. The [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations evoked by rebamipide were inhibited by the CCK(1) receptor antagonist L-364,718 but not by atropine or the CCK(2) receptor antagonist L-365,260 indicating that rebamipide is a nonpeptide CCK(1) receptor agonist.", 
    "84": "This study investigated a role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in the anxiolytic-like action of morphine, an agonist of mu-opioid receptors, in the rat plus-maze model of anxiety. The acute administration of morphine (1 mg/kg) induced a significant increase of exploratory activity in the plus-maze, but did not affect the locomotor activity in the motility test. The higher dose of morphine (2.5 mg/kg) tended to decrease the locomotor activity and, therefore, did not cause the anxiolytic-like action in the plus-maze. The other drugs (naloxone, BOC-CCK-4, L-365,260) and their combinations with morphine (0.5-1 mg/kg) did not affect the locomotor activity of rats. The opioid antagonist naloxone itself (0.5 mg/kg) did not change the exploratory activity in the plus-maze, but potently antagonized the anxiolytic-like action of morphine (1 mg/kg). An agonist of CCK(B)receptors BOC-CCK-4 (1-50 microgram/kg) induced a dose-dependent anxiogenic-like action in the plus-maze. Nevertheless, only one dose of BOC-CCK-4 (10 microgram/kg) completely reversed the action of morphine. Also, one dose of CCK(B)receptor antagonist L-365,260 (10 microgram/kg) was effective to modify the behaviour of rats in the elevated plus-maze. Namely, this dose of L-365,260 increased the ratio between open and total arm entries, a behavioural measure believed to reflect the anxiolytic-like action in the elevated plus-maze. The combination of L-365,260 (100 microgram/kg) with the sub-effective dose of morphine (0.5 mg/kg) caused the anxiolytic-like action in the plus-maze not seen if the drugs were given alone. In conclusion, morphine induces a potent anxiolytic-like action in the elevated plus-maze and CCK is acting as an endogenous antagonist of this effect of morphine.", 
    "85": "Central benzodiazepine receptor ligands, such as [(11)C]flumazenil (FMZ), are markers of neuronal integrity and therefore might be useful in the differentiation of functionally and morphologically damaged tissue early in ischemic stroke. We sought to assess the value of a benzodiazepine receptor ligand for the early identification of irreversible ischemic damage to cortical areas that cannot benefit from reperfusion.", 
    "86": "Eleven patients (7 male, 4 female, aged 52 to 75 years) with acute, hemispheric ischemic stroke were treated with alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator; 0.9 mg/kg according to National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke protocol) within 3 hours of onset of symptoms. At the beginning of thrombolysis, cortical cerebral blood flow ([(15)O]H(2)O) and FMZ binding were assessed by positron emission tomography (PET). Those early PET findings were related to the change in neurological deficit (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) and to the extent of cortical damage on MRI or CT 3 weeks after the stroke.", 
    "87": "Hypoperfusion was observed in all cases, and in 8 patients the values were below critical thresholds estimated at 12 mL/100 g per minute, comprising 1 to 174 cm(3) of cortical tissue. Substantial reperfusion was seen in most of these regions 24 hours after thrombolysis. In 4 cases, distinct areas of decreased FMZ binding were detected. Those patients suffered permanent lesions in cortical areas corresponding to their FMZ defects (112 versus 146, 3 versus 3, 2 versus 1, and 128 versus 136 cm(3)). In the other patients no morphological defects were detected on MRI or CT, although blood flow was critically decreased in areas ranging in size up to 78 cm(3) before thrombolysis.", 
    "88": "These findings suggest that imaging of benzodiazepine receptors by FMZ PET distinguishes between irreversibly damaged and viable penumbra tissue early after acute stroke.", 
    "89": "Neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity (NPY-LI) was investigated in naIve Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to acute, subchronic (7 days) or chronic (21 days) intraperitoneal treatment with diazepam (1 or 3 mg/kg once daily) or buspirone (1.5 or 5 mg/kg twice daily). NPY-LI was determined by radioimmunoassay in the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus and frontal cortex 24 h after the last dose of the drugs. Amygdala NPY-LI decreased after acute diazepam (3 mg/kg) or buspirone (1.5 mg/kg) and increased after subchronic treatment with both doses of diazepam and after chronic buspirone (1.5 mg/kg) treatment. Both diazepam and buspirone given in subchronic and chronic doses decreased NPY-LI levels in the nucleus accumbens. Hypothalamic NPY-LI changed only after chronic treatment: it decreased after diazepam and increased after buspirone (5 mg/kg). NPY-LI content in the frontal cortex decreased after subchronic diazepam (3 mg/kg) treatment and slightly increased after buspirone. The study has shown that both diazepam and buspirone affect NPY-LI levels in rats. These results suggest that the NPY system in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens is implicated in the anxiolytic effects of the drugs studied.",

Tc-99m-HMPAO SPECT was performed in three right handed children with LKS. A relative decrease in perfusion was found in the left temporal cortex of all three patients and also in the left frontoparietal cortex of one patient with hyperkinetic behavior. Degree of regional cerebral perfusion impairment did not correlate with the severity of clinical and EEG abnormalities. Asymmetrical temporoparietal perfusion appears characteristic of LKS. SPECT findings in LKS were evaluated as useful in elucidating the pathogenic features of the disorder in the brain.", 
    "91": "We have quantified the potentiating effects of 1.7% sevoflurane (n = 12) on vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block and compared the results with those obtained during balanced anaesthesia with propofol (n = 12) or midazolam (n = 12) in 36 patients. Neuromuscular function was monitored using an accelerograph and the train-of-four responses of the adductor pollicis muscle to ulnar nerve stimulation. Vecuronium 0.1 mg kg-1 was administered as an intubating dose, and maintenance doses of 0.02 mg kg-1 were administered on three occasions when T1/T0 had recovered to 25%. Thereafter, spontaneous recovery was monitored until complete. Times to 25% recovery of T1/T0 (DUR25) after an intubating dose of vecuronium did not differ between groups (mean 44.2 (SD 18.7) min for sevoflurane, 38.3 (7.5) min for propofol and 35.5 (9.5) min for midazolam). DUR25 values after each maintenance dose were 29.8 (9.5) min, 30.3 (10.4) min and 31.6 (10.7) min during sevoflurane anaesthesia, and were significantly longer than values for propofol (21.7 (6.0) min, 21.5 (5.8) min and 21.9 (5.8) min) and midazolam (20.0 (5.9) min, 19.3 (7.7) min and 19.8 (8.0) min) (P < 0.05) in each case). Recovery index25-75% and interval from T1/T0 = 25% to T4/T1 = 0.7 after the final dose of vecuronium were significantly prolonged by sevoflurane (28.3 (13.2) min and 42.7 (16.4) min) compared with propofol (17.6 (6.1) min and 26.6 (9.8) min) or midazolam (16.3 (9.4) min and 26.0 (10.2) min) (P < 0.05 in each case).", 
    "92": "Human myeloid leukemia K562 cells can be induced to differentiate to mature cells bidirectionary, i.e., hemin induces erythroid differentiation, while 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) induces differentiation to monocytes. The differentiation-inducing activity of various hemin-related compounds suggested certain structural requirements for the activity: 1) the iron moiety of hemin is not essential, and 2) the propionic acid side chains of hemin play an important role in the differentiation and induction. In addition, we have examined the influence of some bioresponse-modifying factors on hemin/protoporphyrin IX-induced differentiation of K562 cell line. Retinoids and tubulin-disruptors, themselves did not induce differentiation, enhanced hemin/protoporphyrin IX-induced differentiation of K562 cells. We also examined the possible involvement of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) in hemin/protoporphyrin IX-induced differentiation on K562 cell lines. The PBR specific ligands modified hemin-induced differentiation. These results suggest a requirement for retinoids (or retinoids-like cofactors) for hemin/protoporphyrin IX-induced differentiation of K562 cells and the involvement of PBR in erythroid differentiation of K562 cell line. Further we showed that TPA suppresses hemin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells, while retinoids augment it. TPA is a potent inducer of heme oxygenase (HO), which catabolizes heme to biliverdin. An HO inhibitor, tin protoporphyrin (SnPP), suppresses TPA-induced K562 cell differentiation to monocytes. It was also found that cotreatment of K562 cells with SnPP and TPA induces erythroid differentiation of K562 cells, though SnPP alone or TPA alone does not induce erythroid differentiation, suggesting a role of HO in the directional switch of differentiation.", 
    "93": "A 58-year-old male presented with reflex myoclonus and stiffness of the left facial, tongue, shoulder, and lower limbs muscles. Muscle stiffness and gait progressively worsened, leading to frequent falls. Acoustic and cutaneous stimuli of head precipitated reflex myoclonus like head retraction. Cutaneous of lower extremities precipitated jerky myoclonus of bilateral lower extremities. CSF analysis were unremarkable. No anti GAD antibody or anti amphiphysin antibody was detected in the serum and CSF. On surface EMG the spasms initiated with 4-5 short burst discharges at intervals between 59 and 84 ms, followed by a tonic decrescendo activity up to 3 s. After diazepam treatment, stiffness and reflex myoclonus of lower extremities were disappeared and head retraction like reflex myoclonus was improved but remained. CT of the chest revealed a mediastinal tumor. Biopsy of the tumor revealed undifferential carcinoma. The patient further improved after the resection of the tumor. These findings suggest that this stiff-man syndrome may occur as an autoimmune paraneoplastic syndrome of CNS.",

    "96": "Midazolam ketamine was used for the induction of anesthesia in 40 patients with a history of allergy (M-K group) and thiamylal was used for the induction of anesthesia in 40 patients without any history of allergy (BARB group). Venous blood samples were obtained before induction as a control and 0.5, 1, 3, 5 minutes after the administration of each drug in order to measure the plasma histamine level. In addition, any observed hemodynamic changes were simultaneously recorded. The plasma histamine level was measured using the HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) post-label system.", 
    "97": "The incidence of histamine release, skin reactions and hemodynamic changes were 37.5%, 10.0% and 7.5%, in the M-K group, and 40.0%, 12.5% and 12.5%, in the BARB group, respectively. Although the mean basal plasma histamine level in the M-K group (0.46 +/- 0.23 ng/ml) who had a history of allergy was much higher than that in the BARB group (0.28 +/- 0.17 ng/ml) (p < 0.001), the incidence of histamine release and clinical symptoms were similar between the two groups.", 
    "98": "The induction of anesthesia with midazolam-ketamine was thus found to be a valuable method for allergic patients, because the incidence of histamine release, skin reactions and hemodynamic changes in allergic patients were similar to those in non-allergic patients induced by thiamylal and no significant changes were observed in the plasma histamine level after the administration of midazolam-ketamine in spite of the high level of basal plasma histamine.", 
    "99": "Activation of calcium-ion (Ca2+) channels on the plasma membrane and on intracellular Ca2+ stores, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, generates local transient increases in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration that induce Ca2+ uptake by neighbouring mitochondria. Here, by using mitochondrially targeted aequorin proteins with different Ca2+ affinities, we show that half of the chromaffin-cell mitochondria exhibit surprisingly rapid millimolar Ca2+ transients upon stimulation of cells with acetylcholine, caffeine or high concentrations of potassium ions. Our results show a tight functional coupling of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels on the plasma membrane, ryanodine receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria. Cell stimulation generates localized Ca2+ transients, with Ca2+ concentrations above 20-40 microM, at these functional units. Protonophores abolish mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and increase stimulated secretion of catecholamines by three- to fivefold. These results indicate that mitochondria modulate secretion by controlling the availability of Ca2+ for exocytosis.", 
    "100": "Consistent with the epileptogenic and deleterious effects of the potent neurotoxin kainate, the activation of kainate receptors reduces the synaptic inhibition induced by the amino acid gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Extrapolating from these data led to the conclusion that kainate receptors are located presynaptically. However, kainate directly depolarizes the inhibitory interneurons, causing them to fire repeatedly. This effect might indirectly decrease the size of inhibitory postsynaptic currents recorded from pyramidal cells and places in doubt the presynaptic location for kainate receptors. Here we show that both effects, membrane depolarization and the reduction of inhibitory potentials, can be dissociated by several means, particularly by the natural agonist of kainate receptors, glutamate. Indeed, when applied at low concentrations, glutamate inhibited GABA release without affecting the firing rate of GABA interneurons. These results indicate that CA1 interneurons contain two populations of kainate receptors, each with different agonist sensitivity and coupled to distinct signaling pathways.", 
    "101": "Prescribing patterns for a group of outpatients with schizophrenia were surveyed for changes after the initiation of clozapine. Data were drawn from computerized pharmacy records, direct case record reviews, and interviews with the attending psychiatrists. The number of patients with two or more psychotropic drugs decreased by 31 percent after the initiation of clozapine, and a trend toward the use of clozapine without additional neuroleptics was detected. Decreases occurred in the use of anticholinergic agents, carbamazepine, and benzodiazepines, but selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and sodium valproate were more likely to be prescribed concomitantly with clozapine.", 
    "102": "Cholesterol and triglyceride levels were studied in the serum of aggressive muricidal and non-muricidal male Wistar rats. The muricidal behavior was either spontaneous or induced by a long-term isolation or by adrenalectomy. Cholesterol levels were slightly higher in the whole population of muricidal rats; this was mainly observed in spontaneously and in adrenalectomized muricidal rats, as compared to non-muricidal rats of the same series. As regards triglyceride levels, they were significantly higher in the whole population of muricidal rats, mainly in isolation- and adrenalectomy-induced muricidal rats; the ratio of triglycerides to body weight was higher in the serum of muricidal rats of all series. The possible significance of these results is discussed in light of the data of the literature and related to the functional role of either mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors or serotonin.", 
    "103": "Pigmented (C57BI) and nonpigmented (balb/c) mice, 25 days of age, were treated intraperitoneally with [3H]-nicotine (4 mg/kg, 555 dpm/ng) or [3H]-flunitrazepam (1 mg/kg, 2200 dpm/ng) daily for three days. After 21 days, shaved back hair was digested at 37 degrees C for 24 h with either 1 M sodium hydroxide or 1 M sodium sulfide. With both drugs, sodium sulfide extraction removed the same amount of radioactivity as sodium hydroxide from nonpigmented hair. However, sodium sulfide removed significantly more radioactivity from pigmented hair than did sodium hydroxide. In pigmented hair, sodium sulfide solubilized 35% and 74% of the flunitrazepam- and nicotine-associated radioactivity, respectively. Of this, 12% and 43%, respectively, could be partitioned into ethyl acetate. Microscopic examination of residual pellets after digestion demonstrated a more thorough dissolution of the hair shaft with sodium sulfide with only melanosomes remaining. The results demonstrate the significant interaction of flunitrazepam and nicotine with melanins and the utility of sodium sulfide in increasing drug recovery.", 
    "104": "A dual-column retention index method is described for quantitative gas chromatographic (GC) screening of 26 benzodiazepine drugs and metabolites in the blood using DB-5 and DB-17 capillary columns and electron capture detection. The method involves a one-step, small-scale liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate and derivatization with N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide with 1% tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride. The results from the GC screening of 514 postmortem blood samples were compared to those obtained from urine immunoassay (Syva ETSplus with a 200-ng/mL cutoff). Both methods gave a negative result in 284 cases and a positive result in 149 cases. In 48 cases, urine was negative by immunoassay but blood was positive by GC. The opposite situation (blood negative, urine positive) was detected only in four cases. In 29 cases, an invalid result was obtained by urine by immunoassay: 26 blood samples of those cases were negative and three samples positive by GC. In postmortem forensic toxicology, the present GC method seems to be a good alternative to the common combination of urinary immunoassay followed by quantitative analysis of blood by chromatography.", 
    "105": "Recently, flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) has become an increasingly popular drug of abuse among young adults, who take it for its euphoric effects. In other cases, the drug has been used by rapists for its sedative and hypnotic effects that can induce a catatonialike trance and memory loss in potential victims; as a result, it has been nicknamed the \"date-rape drug\". For these reasons, the Drug Enforcement Administration recently considered adding the drug (a.k.a. \"Roofies\") to the same category as heroin and LSD. A selective and sensitive technique has been developed for extracting, detecting, and identifying flunitrazepam and its two major metabolites (7-aminoflunitrazepam and N-desmethylflunitrazepam) in human urine. Using a solid-phase extraction cartridge containing a \"mixed-mode\" bonded silica gel (Bond Elut Certify), flunitrazepam and its metabolites were selectively isolated from other urine components and quantitated and identified by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with a benchtop ion mass spectrometer. The extraction method is rapid, reproducible, and precise, and it has a broad linear working range. The overall extraction efficiency was found to be more than 90% for the parent drug as well as the two major metabolites.", 
    "106": "A 60-year-old hypertensive woman had a pontine hemorrhage that caused slight right hemiplegia, deep sensory disturbance on her right side and dysarthria. Three months after the stroke, she was transferred to our hospital for rehabilitation. Approximately 6 months later, she gradually began to complain of the visual oscillation. Continual, unceasing conjugate vertical/rotatory eye movements were observed. Fixation was momentary at best because of an inability to dampen the spontaneous eye movements. Electrooculography (EOG) showed bilateral vertical/rotatory sinusoidal eye movements of 2.5 Hz frequency and 10- to 35-degree amplitude. Both vertical and horizontal optokinetic nystagmus were absent. Caloric stimulation did not evoke any responses bilaterally. There were no rhythmical movements at similar frequencies in other parts of the body such as palatal myoclonus. MRI revealed not only hematoma mainly at the dorsal pontine tegmentum but also hypertrophy of the inferior olive nucleus, suggesting disruption of the central tegmental tract. Lesions of this tract may be one cause of pendular nystagmus. Several drug therapies were investigated for the nystagmus. There was no response to baclofen 15 mg. Trihexyphenidyl 4 mg was discontinued because of drug-induced hallucinations. Tiapride 600 mg and phenobarbital 90 mg were each slightly effective in reducing both frequency and amplitude of nystagmus. Treatment with clonazepam 1 mg resulted in the striking disappearance of nystagmus. She was aware of this and no longer experienced oscillopsia. Despite the visual benefit, however, the patient did not wish to continue this drug because of drowsiness and muscle relaxation. The potential long-term therapeutic application of clonazepam should be further investigated. To our knowledge, there have been no reports of successful treatment in acquired pendular nystagmus with clonazepam. Therefore, based on this favorable experience, it is suggested that clonazepam should be added to the list of potential therapies for pendular nystagmus.", 
    "107": "The ECL cells in the oxyntic mucosa of rat stomach produce histamine and chromogranin A-derived peptides such as pancreastatin. The cells respond to gastrin via cholecystokinin-2 (CCK2) receptors. A CCK2 receptor blockade was induced by treatment (for up to 8 weeks) with two receptor antagonists, YM022 and YF476. Changes in ECL-cell morphology were examined by immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy, while changes in ECL cell-related biochemical parameters were monitored by measuring serum pancreastatin and oxyntic mucosal pancreastatin, and histamine concentrations, and histidine decarboxylase (HDC) activity. The CCK2 receptor blockade reduced the ECL-cell density only marginally, if at all, but transformed the ECL cells from slender, elongated cells with prominent projections to small, spherical cells without projections. The Golgi complex and the rough endoplasmic reticulum were diminished. Secretory vesicles were greatly reduced in volume density in the trans Golgi area. Circulating pancreastatin concentration and oxyntic mucosal HDC activity were lowered within a few hours. Oxyntic mucosal histamine and pancreastatin concentrations were reduced only gradually. The CCK2 receptor blockade was found to prevent the effects of omeprazole-evoked hypergastrinaemia on the ECL-cell activity and density. In conclusion, gastrin, acting on CCK2 receptors, is needed to maintain the shape, size and activity of the ECL cells, but not for maintaining the ECL-cell population.", 
    "108": "Thirteen subjects (seven men, six women) completed a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover study to determine whether an interaction occurs between clonazepam and sertraline. Ten days of once-daily doses of either clonazepam 1 mg and placebo (CZ + PL) or clonazepam 1 mg and sertraline 100 mg (CZ + SR) were administered; there was an 11-day washout period. Sertraline did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of clonazepam (p > 0.13). Clonazepam apparent oral clearance, volume of distribution, and half-life were 3.9 +/- 0.2 L/hr, 233 +/-11 L, and 40.5 +/- 0.3 hours, respectively. The kinetics of the inactive metabolite 7-aminoclonazepam were marginally affected by sertraline, with a 21% decrease in the elimination half-life (p = 0.03) relative to CZ + PL and no significant difference between treatments in area under the curve or metabolite ratio. Card sorting (CS), digit-symbol substitution test (DSST), nurse-rated sedation scale (NRSS), and self-rated sedation scores were assessed four times daily on days -1 (PL + PL), 1, 4, 7, and 10. There were no differences between treatments in area under the effect curve or maximum observed effect for CS, DSST, or NRSS. Maximum impairment on all assessment days was low, with a less than 10% change from the drug-free values for CS and DSST. Despite higher clonazepam concentrations, predose (time 0) psychomotor and sedation scores did not differ among days -1, 1, 4, 7, and 10 or between treatments. These results in healthy volunteers indicate that sertraline does not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of clonazepam.", 
    "109": "In a multicenter, double-blind trial, 310 patients who had received a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder were treated for 6 weeks with either abecarnil, diazepam, or placebo at mean daily doses of 12 mg of abecarnil or 22 mg of diazepam administered three times daily. Patients who were improved at 6 weeks could volunteer to continue double-blind treatment for a total of 24 weeks. The maintenance treatment phase allowed the comparison of taper results for the three treatments at several study periods (0-6 weeks, 7-12 weeks, and more than 12 weeks). Slightly more diazepam (77%) and placebo (75%) patients completed the 6-week study than abecarnil patients (66%). At intake and baseline, after a 1-week placebo washout, the patient was required to have a Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety score of > or =20. Major adverse events for both abecarnil and diazepam were drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, and coordination difficulties. Clinical improvement data showed that both abecarnil and diazepam produced statistically significantly more symptom relief than did placebo after 1 week of treatment. At 6 weeks treatment (using last observation carried forward analysis), however, only diazepam still differed significantly (p < 0.01) from placebo. High placebo response (56% moderate to marked global improvement) at 6 weeks, as well as a slightly lower nonsignificant improvement rate observed with abecarnil, a partial y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist, when compared with diazepam, a full GABA agonist, most likely contributed to our findings. Finally, taper results showed that only diazepam and not abecarnil caused the presence of temporary discontinuation symptoms, but only in patients who had been treated for at least 12 weeks.", 
    "110": "Several case reports have suggested that treatment with the benzodiazepine alprazolam can result in behavioral disinhibition. To address this question, the authors reviewed the medical records (blinded to all pharmacologic treatments the patients received) of 323 psychiatric inpatients treated with alprazolam (108 patients), clonazepam (111 patients), or no benzodiazepine (104 patients) between January 1989 and June 1990. During benzodiazepine treatment, there were no significant differences among the three groups on the following measures: (1) acts of self-injury (alprazolam, 1.9%; clonazepam, 1.8%; no benzodiazepine, 2.9%); (2) assaults on staff or other patients (alprazolam, 0%; clonazepam, 0.9%; no benzodiazepine, 1.0%); (3) need for seclusion or restraints (alprazolam, 3.7%; clonazepam, 6.3%; no benzodiazepine, 4.8%); (4) increased need for observation by hospital staff (alprazolam, 8.3%; clonazepam, 7.2%; no benzodiazepine, 6.7%); and (5) decrease in patient privileges (alprazolam, 11.1%; clonazepam, 12.6%; no benzodiazepine, 11.5%). The results indicate that in an inpatient psychiatric population, the frequency of behavioral disturbances with alprazolam, clonazepam, or no benzodiazepine does not differ. This suggests that alprazolam does not possess unique disinhibitory activity. Second, these data suggest that disinhibition may not be an important clinical problem associated with benzodiazepine use. The design of the study does not allow one to establish a relationship between the prescription of the benzodiazepine and worsening behaviors, and the findings need to be interpreted conservatively because it was a retrospective review of a heterogeneous population. However, it is noteworthy that the incidence of adverse events was low even in this high-risk population, and because the patients were in the hospital and under constant observation, the objective assessment of so-called paradoxical reactions was undertaken in a controlled setting.", 
    "111": "Studies on the association between long-term benzodiazepine use and brain abnormalities have yielded conflicting results. The computed tomographic (CT) scans of 20 long-term users of benzodiazepine (65% men; mean age +/- SD [range], 42 +/- 12.1 years [23-59]; mean daily benzodiazepine dose [diazepam equivalents], 19.5 +/- 16.2 mg [2.5-70]; mean cumulative benzodiazepine exposure, 55.2 g [1.8-198]) were compared with 36 age- (+/-3 years) and sex-matched controls. Controls were prospectively recruited from 96 patients attending a neurology clinic and were interviewed to screen for alcohol and substance use disorders and other conditions possibly leading to brain atrophy. Three neuroradiologists blindly assessed each CT scan for atrophy and measured ventricles (V1, V2, V3), sulci, fissures, cisterns, and folia. Reliability among observers ranged from 0.92 to <0.1, in which case deleting one observer increased all reliabilities to >0.45. No difference in atrophy was found between benzodiazepine users and controls. V1 measures were significantly higher for benzodiazepine users than for controls (mean +/- SD, 12.1 +/- 1.3 vs. 11.1 +/- 2.0;p = 0.02), but measures of third and fourth largest sulci were significantly higher in controls than in benzodiazepine users. Right third and fourth largest sulci (mean +/- SD), respectively, were the following: controls, 0.72 +/- 0.4 and 0.74 +/- 0.7; benzodiazepine users, 0.51 +/- 0.3 and 0.46 +/- 0.3 (p < 0.02).

Long-term benzodiazepine therapy does not result in brain abnormalities that can be demonstrated on CT scans.",

Rates of suicide using benzodiazepines increased despite decreasing prescription sales. Decreasing tricyclic antidepressant sales and increasing SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) sales were paralleled by decreasing rates of suicides employing antidepressants. The fatality ratio (FR) decreased for the antidepressant group, increased for benzodiazepines and remained more or less unchanged for analgesics among the elderly during the study period.",

    "116": "Gastrin is one of the main factors controlling enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell endocrine function and growth. Long-standing hypergastrinemia may give rise to ECL cell carcinoids in the gastric corpus in man and in experimental models. We have analysed the expression and function of CCK-B/gastrin receptors in normal ECL cells and in ECL cell tumours (gastric carcinoids) of the African rodent Mastomys natalensis. Hypergastrinemia induced by short-term (5 days) histamine2-receptor blockade (loxtidine) resulted in increased histidine decarboxylase (HDC) mRNA expression in the gastric oxyntic mucosa. This increase was significantly and dose-dependently reversed by selective CCK-B/gastrin receptor blockade (YM022). Long-term (12 months) hypergastrinemia, induced by histamine2-receptor blockade, gave rise to ECL cell carcinoids in the gastric oxyntic mucosa. CCK-B/gastrin receptor mRNA was only slightly elevated while HDC mRNA expression was eight-fold elevated in ECL cell carcinoids and was not influenced by CCK-B/gastrin receptor blockade. Thus CCK-B/gastrin receptor blockade of hypergastrinemic animals reduces the HDC mRNA expression in normal mucosa but not in ECL cell carcinoids. These results demonstrate that HDC mRNA expression in neoplastic ECL cells is not controlled by CCK-B/gastrin receptors.", 
    "117": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of CCK on the upper gut and pancreas microstructure and on pancreatic juice secretion in neonatal calves assessed by a repetitive intraduodenal administration of FK480, a CCK-A receptor antagonist, during the first 6 days of life. The experiment was performed on 10 neonatal calves surgically fitted with a pancreatic accessory duct catheter and duodenal cannulas. Calves were sacrificed on day 7 for tissue sampling. Treatment with FK480 resulted in: reduction of preprandial pancreatic juice secretion at days 1-3, smaller size of pancreatic acini and number of cells per acinus, reduction in intestinal crypt depth (except in the duodenal bulb), numerous modifications of intestinal villi length and width, lower mitotic index of crypt cells, and increased number and size of enterocytes with 'empty vacuoles'. In conclusion, the blockade of CCK-A receptors during early life both reduced pancreatic exocrine secretion and induced complex changes in pancreatic microstructure. The influence of CCK on the upper gut microstructure in neonatal calves could be either direct via activation of CCK-A receptors located in the mucosa of the upper gut or indirect by modulation of the secretion of pancreatic juice.", 
    "118": "This study evaluated the ability of six benzodiazepines to stop seizures produced by exposure to the nerve agent soman. Guinea pigs, previously prepared with electrodes to record electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, were pretreated with pyridostigmine (0.026 mg/kg, i.m.) 30 min before challenge with soman (56 microg/kg, s.c.) and then treated 1 min after soman exposure with atropine (2.0 mg/kg, i.m.) and pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM Cl; 25 mg/kg, i.m.). All animals developed seizures following this treatment. Benzodiazepines (avizafone, clonazepam, diazepam, loprazolam, lorazepam, and midazolam) were given i.m. 5 or 40 min after seizure onset. All benzodiazepines were effective in stopping soman-induced seizures, but there were marked differences between drugs in the rapidity of seizure control. The 50% effective dose (ED50) values and latencies for anticonvulsant effect for a given benzodiazepine were the same at the two times of treatment delay. Midazolam was the most potent and rapidly acting compound at both treatment times. Since rapid seizure control minimizes the chance of brain damage, use of midazolam as an anticonvulsant may lead to improved clinical outcome in the treatment of nerve agent seizures.", 
    "119": "Ondansetron (GR38032F, zofran)--a specific blocker of 5-HT3-receptors in a dose range of 0.05 to 0. mg/kg causes an anxiolytic effect in experiments on mice and rats on a model of elevated plus maze. The drug does not produce a sedative and myorelaxant effect. A 0.05 mg/kg dose of ondansetron reduces the level of anxiety and convulsive manifestations which are induced by discontinuation of long-term diazepam administration. The results of the study bear evidence of selectivity of the anxiolytic effect of ondansetron in intact animals and its effectiveness in rats with diazepam abstinence.", 
    "120": "Stereotyped behavior is elicited by activation of dopaminergic systems with drugs such as apomorphine and amphetamine. In previous studies, we have reported that the sulfated cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) decreased apomorphine-induced stereotypy in animals with normal and supersensitive dopamine receptors. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of CCK(1) and CCK(2) receptor antagonists on stereotyped behavior induced by apomorphine or amphetamine. Rats were pretreated with the CCK(1) (SR 27897B; 1-[[2-(4-(2-chlorophenyl) thiazol-2-yl) aminocarbonyl]indolyl]acetic acid; 500 microg/kg; i.p.) or CCK(2) (L-365,260; 3R-(+)-N-(2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5 phenyl-1H-1, 4-benzodiazepine-3-yl)-N'-(3-methyl phenyl)-urea; 500 microg/kg; i.p. ) receptor antagonists or saline 15 min before apomorphine (0.6 mg/kg; s.c.) or amphetamine (9.0 mg/kg; i.p.) injection. Both CCK(1) and CCK(2) receptor antagonists significantly increased apomorphine-induced stereotypy. In contrast, only the blockade of CCK(2) receptors significantly decreased amphetamine-induced stereotypy. The results suggest a dual opposite mechanism for CCK-dopamine interactions. These data also suggest that both apomorphine- and amphetamine-induced stereotypy should be used whenever effects of drugs acting on dopaminergic systems are being assessed.", 
    "121": "The effect of endogenous dopamine on in vivo measurement of dopamine D(2) receptors in extrastriatal regions (thalamus and temporal cortex) was evaluated with single photon emission computed tomography and the high affinity ligand [123I]epidepride by comparing the binding potential before and after acute dopamine depletion. Dopamine depletion was achieved by per-oral administration of 5.5 g/70 kg body weight alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine given in 37 h. The alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine treatment increased the binding potential significantly in the temporal cortex (13+/-15%, P=0.036) but not in the thalamus (2+/-9%). The increase of the binding potential in the temporal cortex correlated strongly with the increase of dysphoric mood evaluated by the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) (rho=0.88, P=0.004). These results imply that [123I]epidepride, coupled with acute dopamine depletion might provide estimates of synaptic dopamine concentration.", 
    "122": "Neuroleptics are known to stimulate dopamine release in neostriatal terminal areas. In the present study, we have investigated by brain microdialysis in freely moving rats the effect of typical and atypical neuroleptics on dopamine transmission in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis, a dopamine terminal area belonging to the limbic system and recently assigned the so-called extended amygdala. Mean basal dialysate dopamine values were 14.3 f moles/20 microliters sample. Dopamine output in dialysates was increased dose-dependently by clozapine (max + 158%, 298%, and 461% of basal at 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg i.p., respectively), risperidone (max + 115% and 221% of basal at 1 and 3 mg/kg i.p., respectively), olanzapine (max + 138% and 235% of basal at 3 and 6 mg/kg i.p., respectively), BIMG 80 (max + 64% and 164% of basal at 3 and 5 mg/kg i.p., respectively), amperozide (max + 110% and 194% of basal at 3 and 6 mg/kg i.p., respectively). The selective dopamine D4 antagonist L-745,870 increased dialysate dopamine but at rather high doses and not as effectively as clozapine (max + 32%, 89%, and 130% of basal at 2.7, 5.4, and 10.8 mg/kg i.p., respectively). The typical neuroleptic haloperidol (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg s.c.) and the selective D2 antagonist raclopride (0.14, 0.56, and 2.1 mg/kg s.c.), the serotonergic 5-HT2 antagonist ritanserin (0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg i.p.), and the adrenergic alpha 1 antagonist prazosin (0.91 and 2.73 mg/kg i.p.) did not affect dialysate dopamine in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis. Saline (1 ml/kg s.c. or 3 ml/kg i.p.) did not modify dialysate dopamine. Therefore, atypical neuroleptics share the ability of stimulating dopamine transmission in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis, but this property is not mimicked by any of the drug tested that selectively act on individual receptors among those that are affected by atypical neuroleptics. These observations raise the possibility that the property of increasing dopamine transmission in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis is the result of combined blockade of dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline receptors and that might be predictive of an atypical neuroleptic profile.", 
    "123": "Clinical signs of tolazoline toxicosis developed in a 4-year-old llama that received 2 doses of tolazoline hydrochloride to reverse xylazine-induced sedation. The full first dose (4.3 mg/kg [2.0 mg/lb] of body weight) was erroneously injected i.v., and the second dose was administered half i.v., half i.m. 45 minutes later, because the llama became weak and recumbent. Signs of anxiety, hyperesthesia, profuse salivation, and tachypnea were the first detectable clinical signs of tolazoline toxicosis. Convulsions, hypotension, gastrointestinal tract hypermotility, and diarrhea also developed. The llama was treated successfully with i.v. administration of diazepam, phenylephrine, and lactated Ringer's solution supplemented with potassium chloride and oxygen administered via nasal insufflation. We suggest that the maximum dose of tolazoline administered at any one time to llamas not exceed 2 mg/kg (0.91 mg/lb). Furthermore, tolazoline should be administered slowly i.v. or i.m. to reduce the risk of adverse reactions.", 
    "124": "The objective of this study was to correlate postnatal changes in levels of mRNAs encoding predominant GABA(A) receptor subunits with a functional index of receptor development. This study is the first to quantify the temporal relationship between postnatal changes in predominant GABA(A) receptor mRNAs and zolpidem-sensitive GABA(A) receptor subtypes. In Experiment 1, we measured zolpidem displacement of 3H-flunitrazepam from rat cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum at 0, 6, 14, 21, 29, and 90 postnatal days. Three independent 3H-flunitrazepam sites with high (K(i)=2. 7+/-0.6 nM), low (K(i)=67+/-4.8 nM), and very low (K(i)=4.1+/-0.9 mM) affinities for zolpidem varied in regional and developmental expression. In Experiment 2, we used RNAse protection assays to quantify levels of alpha1, alpha2, beta1, beta2, gamma2S and gamma2L mRNAs in the above regions at the same postnatal ages. Although there was a high degree of regional variation in the developmental expression of zolpidem-sensitive GABA(A) receptors and subunit mRNAs, a dramatic increase in high affinity zolpidem binding sites and alpha1 mRNA levels occurred within all three regions during the second postnatal week. Furthermore, a temporal overlap was observed between the rise in alpha1 mRNA and high affinity zolpidem binding and a more prolonged increase in gamma2L in each region. These results point to the inclusion of the alpha1 and gamma2L subunits in a GABA(A) receptor subtype with a high zolpidem affinity and suggest that a global signal may influence the emergence of this subtype in early postnatal life.", 
    "125": "We describe demographic, clinical, laboratory and aetiological findings in 93 consecutive patients with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD), which consists of excessive motor activity during dreaming in association with loss of skeletal muscle atonia of REM sleep. The patients were seen at the Mayo Sleep Disorders Center between January 1, 1991 and July 31, 1995. Eighty-one patients (87%) were male. The mean age of RBD onset was 60.9 years (range 36-84 years) and the mean age at presentation was 64.4 years (37-85 years). Thirty-two per cent of patients had injured themselves and 64% had assaulted their spouses. Subdural haematomas occurred in two patients. Dream content was altered and involved defence of the sleeper against attack in 87%. The frequency of nocturnal events decreased with time in seven untreated patients with neurodegenerative disease. MRI or CT head scans were performed in 56% of patients. Although four scans showed brainstem pathology, all of these patients had apparently unrelated neurodegenerative diseases known to be associated with RBD. Neurological disorders were present in 57% of patients; Parkinson's disease, dementia without parkinsonism and multiple system atrophy accounted for all but 14% of these. RBD developed before parkinsonism in 52% of the patients with Parkinson's disease. Five of the 14 patients with multiple system atrophy were female, and thus the strong male predominance in RBD is less evident in this condition. Psychiatric disorders, drug use or drug withdrawal were rarely causally related to RBD. Clonazepam treatment of RBD was completely or partially successful in 87% of the patients who used the drug. We conclude that RBD is a well-defined condition and that descriptions from different centres are fairly consistent. It is commonest in elderly males and may result in serious morbidity to patients and bed partners. There is a strong relationship to neurodegenerative disease, especially Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy and dementia, and neurologists should explore the possibility of RBD in patients with these conditions. RBD symptoms may be the first manifestations of these disorders and careful follow-up is needed. Neuroimaging is unlikely to reveal underlying disorders not suspected clinically. We confirm the effectiveness of clonazepam, but note that attention to the safety of the bed environment may be sufficient for patients with contraindications to the drug.", 
    "126": "An IM combination of meperidine, promethazine, and chlorpromazine (DPT) has been given as sedation for pediatric procedures for more than 40 years. We compared this IM combination to oral (PO) ketamine/midazolam in children having cardiac catheterization. A total of 51 children, ages 9 mo to 10 yr, were enrolled and randomized in this double-blinded study. All children received an IM injection at time zero and PO fluid 15 minutes later. We observed acceptance of medication, onset of sedation and sleep, and sedative efficacy. The cardiorespiratory changes were evaluated. Sedation was supplemented with IV propofol as required. Recovery time, parental satisfaction, and patient amnesia were assessed. Ketamine/midazolam given PO was better tolerated (P < 0.0005), had more rapid onset (P < 0.001), and provided superior sedation (P < 0.005). Respiratory rate decreased after IM DPT only. Heart rate and shortening fraction were stable. Oxygen saturation and mean blood pressure decreased minimally in both groups. Supplemental propofol was more frequently required (P < or = 0.02) and in larger doses (P < 0.05) after IM DPT. Parental satisfaction ratings were higher (P < 0.005) and amnesia was more reliably obtained (P = 0.007) with PO ketamine/midazolam. Two patients needed airway support after the PO medication, as did two other patients when PO ketamine/midazolam was supplemented with IV propofol. Although PO ketamine/midazolam provided superior sedation and amnesia compared to IM DPT, this regimen may require the supervision of an anesthesiologist for safe use.",

    "128": "In view of the substantial preclinical evidence that supports a seminal role of central corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neuronal systems in the physiology and pathophysiology of stress and anxiety, it is reasonable to suggest that the anxiolytic properties of benzodiazepines are mediated, at least in part, via regulation of CRFergic function. To begin to test this complex hypothesis, we examined the effects of acute and chronic administration of the triazolobenzodiazepine agonist alprazolam on CRF peptide concentrations, receptor-binding density, and mRNA expression in the CNS. Additionally, we measured mRNA expression for urocortin, a recently discovered neuropeptide that is generally considered to be a second endogenous ligand for CRF receptors. Both acute and chronic alprazolam administration was found to decrease CRF concentrations within the locus coeruleus. Furthermore, chronic alprazolam decreased basal activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, CRF mRNA expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala, and CRF(1) mRNA expression and receptor binding in the basolateral amygdala. In marked contrast, urocortin mRNA expression in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus and CRF(2A) receptor binding in the lateral septum and ventromedial hypothalamus were increased. Similar findings of an inverse relationship between the CRF(1) and CRF(2A) receptor systems have been reported in an anxiety model based on adverse early-life experience, suggesting the intriguing possibility that CRF neuronal systems may be comprised of two separate, but interrelated, subdivisions that can be coordinately and inversely regulated by stress, anxiety, or anxiolytic drugs.", 
    "129": "Chlorotriazine herbicides disrupt luteinizing hormone (LH) release in female rats following in vivo exposure. Although the mechanism of action is unknown, significant evidence suggests that inhibition of LH release by chlorotriazines may be mediated by effects in the central nervous system. GABA(A) receptors are important for neuronal regulation of gonadotropin releasing hormone and LH release. The ability of chlorotriazine herbicides to interact with GABA(A) receptors was examined by measuring their effects on [3H]muscimol, [3H]Ro15-4513 and [35S]tert-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding to rat cortical membranes. Cyanazine (1-400 microM) inhibited [3H]Ro15-4513 binding with an IC50 of approximately 105 microM (n=4). Atrazine (1-400 microM) also inhibited [3H]Ro15-4513 binding, but was less potent than cyanazine (IC50 = 305 microM). However, the chlorotriazine metabolites diaminochlorotriazine, 2-amino-4-chloro-6-ethylamino-s-triazine and 2-amino-4-chloro-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine were without significant effect on [3H]Ro15-4513 binding. Cyanazine and the other chlorotriazines were without effect on [3H]muscimol or [35S]TBPS binding. To examine whether cyanazine altered GABA(A) receptor function, GABA-stimulated 36Cl- flux into synaptoneurosomes was examined. Cyanazine (50-100 microM) alone did not significantly decrease GABA-stimulated 36Cl- flux. Diazepam (10 microM) and pentobarbital (100 microM) potentiated GABA-stimulated 36Cl- flux to 126 and 166% of control, respectively. At concentrations of 50 and 100 microM, cyanazine decreased potentiation by diazepam to 112 and 97% of control, respectively, and decreased potentiation by pentobarbital to 158 and 137% of control (n = 6). Interestingly, at lower concentrations (5 microM), cyanazine shifted the EC50 for GABA-stimulated 36Cl- flux into synaptoneurosomes from 28.9 to 19.4 microM, respectively (n = 5). These results suggest that cyanazine modulates benzodiazepine, but not the muscimol (GABA receptor site) or TBPS (Cl- channel), binding sites on GABA(A) receptors. Furthermore, at low concentrations, cyanazine may slightly enhance function of GABA(A) receptors, but at higher concentrations, cyanazine antagonizes GABA(A) receptor function and in particular antagonizes the positive modulatory effects of diazepam and pentobarbital.", 
    "130": "Akathisia is a frequent and common adverse effect of treatment with antipsychotic (neuroleptic) drugs. This syndrome consists of subjective (feeling of inner restlessness and the urge to move) as well as objective components (rocking while standing or sitting, lifting feet as if marching on the spot and crossing and uncrossing the legs while sitting). Antipsychotic-induced akathisia can be classified according to the time of onset in the course of antipsychotic treatment (acute, tardive, withdrawal and chronic akathisia). Reported prevalence rates vary widely between 5 and 36.8%. Numerous risk factors for acute akathisia have been described and the exact pathophysiology of akathisia is still unknown. Since akathisia is a drug-induced adverse effect, optimal management involves its prevention rather than treatment. Standardised titration and the use of novel antipsychotics are successful measures of prevention. This paper reviews different forms of therapeutic approaches for the treatment of akathisia. Based on the available literature, propranolol or other lipophilic beta-blockers seem to be the most consistently effective treatment for acute akathisia. There is nothing in the literature to guide a clinician when treatment with beta-blockers fails. Addition of benzodiazepines would appear to be a sensible next choice, especially if subjective distress persists. If all of these drugs are unsuccessful, amantadine or clonidine can be tried. Other agents that have been investigated include ritanserin, piracetam, valproic acid (sodium valproate) and tricyclic antidepressants. Evidence on the treatment of tardive akathisia is unsatisfactory.",

A claim-by-claim review of Medicaid prescriptions was conducted to detect 5 types of prescribing problems (dose, duration of therapy, duplicative therapy, drug-drug interactions, and contraindications or initial therapy). The study examined 8 drug categories: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, antidepressant agents, antipsychotic agents, benzodiazepines, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, histamine2-receptor antagonists, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The total number of persons with prescriptions in any of the 8 drug classes increased over the 8-year period, with the greatest growth in ACE inhibitors. Mean annual drug use per person declined in Maryland but increased in Washington and Iowa. Despite increasing use, the overall incidence of prescribing problems fell dramatically in all 3 states, particularly for dose- and duration-related criteria. Except in the area of drug-drug interactions, this elderly population was less likely to have received a prescription falling outside commonly accepted drug utilization review criteria for 8 major drug classes in 1996 than in 1989.",

The patient admitted to substantial GHB abuse on a daily basis for 2.5 years. Previous attempts at cessation reportedly resulted in diaphoresis, tremors, and agitation. The patient's symptoms, negative polypharmacy history, and negative urine and blood toxicological analysis for alcohol, benzodiazepines, sedative-hypnotics, or other substances suggested the diagnosis of GHB withdrawal. Later analysis of a patient drug sample confirmed the presence of GHB. The patient required 507 mg of lorazepam and 120 mg of diazepam over 90 h to control agitation. This is one of the few reported cases of GHB withdrawal and one of the most severe. Given the increasing use of GHB, more cases of severe GHB withdrawal should be anticipated.",

Carisoprodol and its active sedative-hypnotic metabolite, meprobamate, are gamma aminobutyric acid receptor indirect agonists with central nervous system chloride ion channel conduction effects similar to the benzodiazepines, thus making flumazenil a potentially useful antidote in toxic presentations.", 
    "139": "Since electroencephalographic (EEG) signal may be considered chaotic, Nonlinear Dynamics and Deterministic Chaos Theory may supply effective quantitative descriptors of EEG dynamics and of underlying chaos in the brain. We have used Karhunen-Loeve decomposition of the covariance matrix of the EEG signal to analyse EEG signals of 4 healthy subjects, under drug-free condition and under the influence of Diazepam. We found that what we call KL-complexity of the signal differs profoundly for the signals registered in different EEG channels, from about 5-8 for signals in frontal channels up to 40 and more in occipital ones. But no consistency in the influence of Diazepam administration on KL-complexity is observed. We also estimated the embedding dimension of the EEG signals of the same subjects, which turned to be between 7 and 11, so endorsing the presumption about existence of low-dimensional chaotic attractor. We are sure that nonlinear time series analysis can be used to investigate the dynamics underlying the generation of EEG signal. This approach does not seem practical yet, but deserves further study."
