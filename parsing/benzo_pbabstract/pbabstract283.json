    "0": "Progesterone (P(4)) in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and ventral tegmental (VTA) is important for facilitation of lordosis; however, P(4)'s actions in these brain areas are different. Using lordosis in rodents as in vivo experimental models, we have examined the effects progestins exert in the midbrain and hypothalamus. Localization and blocker studies indicate that P(4)'s actions in the VMH require intracellular progestin receptors (PRs) but in the VTA they do not. Progestins that have rapid, membrane effects, and/or are devoid of affinity for PRs, facilitate lordosis when applied to the VTA. Manipulation of GABA and/or GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor complexes (GBRs) in the VTA alter lordosis, which suggests that progestins may interact with GBRs to facilitate receptivity by enhancing the function of GABAergic neurons. Interfering with P(4)'s metabolism to 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one (3 alpha,5 alpha-THP), the most effective endogenous positive modulator of GBRs, or the biosynthesis of the neurosteroid 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP in the VTA attenuates female sexual behavior in rodents. Stimulation of mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors (MBRs), which enhance neurosteroid production, by infusions of a MBR agonist to the VTA enhances lordosis. 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP is increased in the midbrain of mated > proestrous > diestrous rodents. These data suggest that 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP has a proximate modulatory role on lordosis. In summary, the actions of P(4) in the VTA are different from those in the VMH that involve PRs. In the VTA, P(4) may facilitate lordosis following metabolism to and/or biosynthesis of 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP, which may have subsequent actions at GBRs and/or MBRs to acutely modulate female sexual behavior in rodents.",

    "2": "1. To determine how acetylcholine (ACh) modulates the somatodendritic processing of EPSPs, we performed whole-cell recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells of hippocampal slices and examined the effect of the cholinergic agonist, carbachol (CCh), on alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl isoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) EPSPs, miniature EPSPs, and EPSP-like waveforms evoked by brief dendritic glutamate pulses (glutamate-evoked postsynaptic potentials, GPSPs). 2. Although CCh is known to enhance the intrinsic excitability of the neuron in several ways, activation of atropine-sensitive (muscarinic) receptors on the apical dendrite or the soma of CA1 pyramidal cells consistently reduced the amplitude of EPSPs and GPSPs. 3. Cholinergic inhibition of evoked and simulated EPSP waveforms displayed considerable voltage dependence, with the amplitude of the postsynaptic potentials progressively declining with membrane hyperpolarization indicating the involvement of an inwardly rectifying current. 4. Extracellular Ba(2+) (200 microM) and tertiapin (30 nM), a novel and selective blocker of G protein-activated, inwardly rectifying K(+) (GIRK) channels, completely blocked the effect of CCh on GPSP amplitude. 5. Muscarinic reduction of GPSPs was not sensitive to the M1 receptor-preferring antagonist, pirenzepine, but was suppressed by the M2 receptor-preferring antagonist, methoctramine, and by the allosteric M2 receptor antagonist, gallamine. 6. In voltage-clamp recordings, CCh induced an ion current displaying inward rectification in the hyperpolarizing direction, which was identified as a GIRK current based on its sensitivity to low Ba(2+) and tertiapin. Its pharmacological profile paralleled that of the cholinergic GPSP reduction. 7. We link the observed reduction of postsynaptic potentials to the cholinergic activation of a GIRK conductance, which serves to partially shunt excitatory synaptic input.",

The benzodiazepine alprazolam has been used successfully in the treatment of panic disorder, but its long-term use presents problems with dependence. Since panic may be mediated by a dysfunction of serotonin neuronal pathways, there is a rationale for treatment with antidepressants that modulate serotonergic systems. In clinical trials, members of the SSRI class of antidepressant reduced panic attack frequency to zero in 36-86% of patients and were well tolerated over long-term administration, all important factors in ensuring patient compliance. In addition, antidepressants are preferable to benzodiazepines in the treatment of panic and comorbid depression, of which there is a high prevalence among panic disorder patients. This review emphasises the need for long-term treatment of this chronic and disabling condition with a therapy that is well tolerated and provides complete and sustained recovery from panic attacks, and resolution of anticipatory anxiety.",

Chemical restraint is used in all emergency departments surveyed. The commonest agents used are haloperidol (93%), midazolam (82%) and diazepam (59%). At least one benzodiazepine and one major tranquilliser are used in 97% of emergency departments. Manual restraint (87%) is frequently used as a prelude to chemical or, less frequently, mechanical restraint (69%). Seclusion restraint is used in 23% of Australasian emergency departments. Formal training is most commonly undertaken for chemical restraint, being used in 33% of departments surveyed.

    "16": "This prospective randomised controlled study evaluated the effects of postoperative sedation with propofol and midazolam on pancreatic function. We studied 42 intensive care unit patients undergoing elective major surgery who were expected to be sedated postoperatively. Patients were randomly assigned to a propofol group (n = 21) or a midazolam group (n = 21). To assess pancreatic function, the following parameters were measured: pancreatitis-associated protein, amylase, lipase, cholesterol and triglyceride prior to start of sedation on the intensive care unit, 4 h after the sedation was started and at the first postoperative day. Patients in the propofol group received on average (SD) 1292 (430) mg propofol and were sedated for 9.03 (4.26) h. The midazolam group received 92 (36) mg midazolam and were sedated for 8.81 (4.68) h. Plasma cholesterol concentrations did not differ significantly between groups. Triglyceride plasma levels 4 h after the start of infusion were significantly higher in the propofol group (140 (54) mg.dl(-1)) than the midazolam-treated patients (81 (29) mg.dl(-1)), but were within normal limits. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding amylase, lipase and pancreatitis-associated protein plasma concentrations at any time. No markers of pancreatic dysfunction were outside the normal range. We conclude that postoperative sedation with propofol induced a significant increase of serum triglyceride levels but that pancreatic function is unchanged with standard doses of propofol.",

Although CLB has a Ki value of 2,130 nM and thus has a lower affinity for the BZP receptor than 1,4-BZPs, it had the selectivity to omega 2 receptor contributing to anticonvulsive actions compared with omega 1 receptor in relation to other CNS activities such as sedation. CLB had a wide spectrum of anticonvulsive actions against seizures in several animal models induced by chemical convulsants and maximal electroshock. CLB reduced both seizure stage and afterdischarge duration in a dose-dependent manner in amygdala or hippocampal kindled rats. Usefulness of an anticonvulsant is generally assessed by quoting the protective index (PI) in the ratio of TD50 to ED50. As the PI for CLB was greater than that for 1,4-BZPs, it suggested that CLB was superior to 1,4-BZPs in tolerability while showing anticonvulsive actions. In clinical studies, CLB was used as an adjunctive treatment in patients with refractory epilepsies. From both experimental and clinical observations, CLB was proven to possess a wide spectrum of activity, high effectiveness and good tolerability in several types of epilepsies.",

    "24": "The aim of this study was to compare in vivo striatal D2 dopamine receptor occupancy induced by olanzapine and haloperidol in schizophrenic patients using a baseline-endpoint [(123)I]IBZM single photon computed emission tomography (SPECT) design. The relationships of striatal D2 receptor occupancy with clinical efficacy and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were also assessed. Twenty-seven inpatients with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder were included in a 4-week prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel and comparative clinical trial. Thirteen patients were treated with haloperidol (10 mg/day) and 14 with olanzapine (10 mg/day). Ratings of clinical status and EPS were obtained weekly. The percentage of D2 receptor occupancy was estimated by using basal ganglia (striatum)/frontal cortex IBZM uptake ratios obtained from each patient before and after 4 weeks of maintained antipsychotic treatment. Olanzapine led to a mean striatal D2 receptor occupancy of 49% (range 28-69%), which was significantly lower than that induced by haloperidol (mean 64%, range 46-90%). The baseline-endpoint SPECT design used in this study revealed lower antipsychotic D2 occupancy percentage values than those reported in the literature, using other approaches. The degree of striatal D2 receptor occupancy correlated to the EPS, which predominantly appeared in patients on haloperidol. No relationship was found between the striatal D2 receptor occupancy and clinical improvement. Olanzapine induced a lower striatal D2 occupancy than haloperidol. This low striatal D2 occupancy, together with the lower incidence of EPS in olanzapine-treated patients, contributed to confirm the atypical behavior of this new antipsychotic drug. Nevertheless, conclusions based on SPECT-estimated percentages of antipsychotic D2 occupancy should be cautious, since the SPECT design could influence the results. In this regard, SPECT studies including baseline and endpoint examinations should be encouraged.",

The parents of 3% of the children found the biopsy very unpleasant and another 3% suggested that the biopsy should be performed under general anaesthesia. The proportion of parents with negative reactions to the biopsy procedure did not differ significantly between the intravenously and intranasally sedated children.

Traditionally, treatment has included administration of iv. or im. benzodiazepines or neuroleptics. However, each of these is associated with adverse effects that may be serious in nature.

All four patients had been taking benzodiazepines, which were stopped 5-15 days before ECT. Two became catatonic after ECT no. 4, one after ECT no. 1, and one after ECT no. 10. The episodes of catatonia resolved promptly with the resumption of benzodiazepines. Two patients completed a course of ECT, whereas two received neuroleptics and/or antidepressants without further ECT. All showed improvements in their affective and psychotic symptoms. The cases illustrate the appearance of catatonia during a course of ECT and suggest recent cessation of benzodiazepines as a risk factor. Benzodiazepines relieve the catatonia, and ECT may be continued.",

Initial reports were that she had injected veterinary-grade diazepam and telazol. On-scene paramedics reported her as obtunded and arousable to deep painful stimuli, with gag reflex intact. Systolic blood pressure was 90 mm Hg by palpation. A fresh needle puncture mark was present on her right arm; nearby were a syringe, tourniquet, and bottles of each drug. Emergency Department assessment included airway, breathing, circulation, and intravenous access. She was lavaged and given activated charcoal with a cathartic.

The cost-effectiveness of the newer atypical antipsychotics has been examined using clinical decision-modeling studies and randomized clinical trials. The research evidence suggests that clozapine is a cost-effective treatment for neuroleptic refractory schizophrenia. Olanzapine and risperidone may be cost-neutral or, at best, slightly cost-saving compared with conventional antipsychotics, although they do improve clinical symptoms and quality of life outcomes.

Chronic, not acute, exposure to olanzapine was capable of up-regulating hippocampal mRNA levels for GluR-B and GluR-C, two alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole proprionic acid (AMPA)-forming subunits. This effect could be relevant for the improvement of schizophrenic alterations, which are thought to depend on dysfunction of the glutamatergic transmission within the hippocampal formation. We also found that the expression of group II glutamate metabotropic receptors was up-regulated in the frontal cortex after chronic exposure to clozapine, and to a lesser extent olanzapine, but not with haloperidol.",

    "41": "Earlier research has demonstrated similarities in the behavioral effects of nitrous oxide (N2O) and benzodiazepine (BZ) drugs such as chlordiazepoxide (CP). The present research was conducted to compare the behavioral effects of N2O and CP in mice in the light/dark exploration test. When challenged with either N2O or CP, mice exhibited significant dose-dependent increases in the time spent in the light compartment and also in the number of transitions between the light and dark compartments. Pretreatment with BZ receptor antagonist flumazenil (FLU), the GABA(A) receptor antagonist SR-95531 or the selective neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase (nNOS) inhibitor 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) all antagonized anxiolytic effects of N20 and CP. Based on these findings, it was concluded that N20 and CP evoke similar behavioral effects in the light/dark exploration test that are similar in their interaction with BZ and GABA(A) receptor antagonists. There also appears to be a specific role for nNOS in generating the NO involved in mediation of these effects.", 
    "42": "Effects of histaminergic agonists and antagonists were investigated on withdrawal signs in lorazepam-dependent rats. Physical dependence was developed by giving lorazepam admixed with the food in the following dose schedule (in mg/kg given daily x days): 10 x 4, 20 x 4, 40 x 4, 80 x 4, and 120 x 7. The parameters observed during the periods of administration of lorazepam and after its withdrawal were spontaneous locomotor activity (SLA), reaction time to pain, foot shock aggression (FSA), and audiogenic seizures. During the withdrawal period, the rats were divided into groups of 10 each. Control-withdrawal group did not receive any drug. The drugs (in mg/kg administered intramuscularly)--L-histidine (50), histamine-N-methyl (2), promethazine (10), pheniramine (10), astemizole (10), and thioperamide (1)--were given separately in other groups daily during the withdrawal period. The withdrawal signs in control group were hyperkinesia, hyperaggression, and audiogenic seizures. L-Histidine, precursor of histamine, and thioperamide, antagonist of H3 receptor, potentiated hyperkinesia, hyperaggression, and audiogenic seizures. Histamine-N-methyl, agonist of H3 receptor, and H1 receptor antagonists, promethazine and pheniramine, blocked all the withdrawal signs. Astemizole, a peripheral antagonist of H1 receptor, could not affect any withdrawal sign. It may be concluded that histamine H1 receptors are facilitatory and H3 receptors are inhibitory for benzodiazepine (BZD) withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "43": "The pharmacological response to benzodiazepines has been demonstrated to be different in aged individuals in comparison to adults. We studied the age-dependent changes in some of the in vitro and behavioral effects of diazepam in aged (24 months old) rats, comparing them to adults (3 months old). We evaluated the in vitro gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced 36Cl- uptake and the diazepam potentiation of GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake in microsacs from cerebral cortex of both groups of animals. We found no differences in the GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake between adult and aged animals, and diazepam failed to potentiate GABA-induced 36Cl- flux in the aged cortical microsacs. We also examined the effect of 0.03-10 mg of diazepam on locomotor activity in an open-field test and the anxiolytic-like action of diazepam in doses ranging from 0.03 to 1 in a dark-light transition test. We observed no anxiolytic-like action of the drug in the dark-light transition test in the aged rats, while there was a shift to the left in the diminution of locomotor activity evaluated by the open-field test. We conclude that the pharmacodynamic changes observed in cortical GABA(A) receptors in aged rats could partially explain the lack of anxiolytic-like action but not the oversedation evidenced in this group of animals.", 
    "44": "Eight compounds that bind to the benzodiazepine binding site on the gamma-amino butyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptor were assessed for their influence on contextual memory, an aspect of memory affected in various cognitive disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Using a Pavlovian fear-conditioning paradigm, each ligand was evaluated in C57Bl/6 mice in regards to its direct affect on contextual memory and whether the ligand could attenuate scopolamine-induced contextual memory impairment. Of the eight ligands tested, one impaired contextual memory (agonist), six attenuated scopolamine-induced contextual memory impairment (inverse agonists), and one antagonized the ability of an inverse agonist to attenuate scopolamine-induced contextual memory impairment. Hence, further demonstrating the bi-directional influence benzodiazepine binding site ligands are able to exert on memory modulation. This study serves as an initial starting point in the development of pharmacological tools to be used in deciphering how GABA(A) receptors influence contextual memory.", 
    "45": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) continues to be an unpredictable and rare, but potentially fatal complication of antipsychotic medications. Presumptively linked to dopamine blockade, it nonetheless occurs in patients receiving newer atypical antipsychotics. The features of NMS, its pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, clinical course, risk factors, and morbidity and mortality are reviewed. Nonpharmacologic management centers on aggressive supportive care including vigilant nursing, physical therapy, cooling, rehydration, anticoagulation. Pharmacologic interventions include immediate discontinuation of antipsychotics, judicious use of anticholinergics, and adjunctive benzodiazepines. The utility of specific agents in actively treating NMS is reviewed. Bromocriptine and other dopaminergic drugs and dantrolene sodium have alternatively been considered without merit or efficacious. Guidelines for using these agents are presented. Electroconvulsive therapy, also somewhat controversial, is identified as a second line of treatment. Finally, management of the post-NMS patient is also reviewed.", 
    "46": "Lofexidine is an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist which has proved useful in opiate withdrawal and which, through its attenuation of noradrenergic activity, might be a valuable adjunct in the management of alcohol withdrawal. The objective of this study was to compare the clinical effectiveness and patient retention with adjunctive lofexidine versus placebo in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal under chlordiazepoxide cover. This was done in a prospective double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial with 72 alcohol-dependent adults referred and admitted for in-patient alcohol detoxification. The adjunctive lofexidine group experienced significantly more severe withdrawal symptoms, greater hypotensive problems, more adverse effects, and no better rates of retention in treatment. Lofexidine provides no discernible benefit as an adjunctive medication (to chlordiazepoxide) in alcohol detoxification and, on the basis of our study, appears to be contra-indicated.", 
    "47": "Many psychiatric patients smoke, and are believed to be heavier smokers than those without psychiatric disorders. Cigarette smoking is one of the environmental factors that contributes to interindividual variations in response to an administered drug. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) present in cigarette smoke induce hepatic aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylases, thereby increasing metabolic clearance of drugs that are substrates for these enzymes. PAHs have been shown to induce 3 hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes, primarily CYP1A1, 1A2 and 2E1. Drug therapy can also be affected pharmacodynamically by nicotine. The most common effect of smoking on drug disposition in humans is an increase in biotransformation rate, consistent with induction of drug-metabolising enzymes. Induction of hepatic enzymes has been shown to increase the metabolism and to decrease the plasma concentrations of imipramine, clomipramine, fluvoxamine and trazodone. The effect of smoking on the plasma concentrations of amitriptyline and nortriptyline is variable. Amfebutamone (bupropion) does not appear to be affected by cigarette smoking. Smoking is associated with increased clearance of tiotixene, fluphenazine, haloperidol and olanzapine. Plasma concentrations of chlorpromazine and clozapine are reduced by cigarette smoking. Clinically, reduced drowsiness in smokers receiving chlorpromazine, and benzodiazepines, compared with nonsmokers has been reported. Increased clearance of the benzodiazepines alprazolam, lorazepam, oxazepam, diazepam and demethyl-diazepam is found in cigarette smokers, whereas chlordiazepoxide does not appear to be affected by smoking. Carbamazepine appears to be minimally affected by cigarette smoke, perhaps because hepatic enzymes are already stimulated by its own autoinductive properties. Cigarette smoking can affect the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of many psychotropic drugs. Clinicians should consider smoking as an important factor in the disposition of these drugs.",

However, pharmacotherapy is prescribed for some patients, e.g., unsuccessful surgery. We treated a woman in whom pituitary Cushing's syndrome was improved while she was on antimuscarinic cholinergic agents, atropine sulphate and pirenzepine hydrochloride. The diminished effect of anticholinergics on ACTH and cortisol was incidentally identified in an inferior petrosal sinus sampling procedure. A single intramuscular injection of atropine significantly decreased both ACTH (43.9 pg/ml to less than 12.0; normal, 12.0-40.0 pg/ml) and cortisol (29.9 microg/dl to 13.6; normal, 7.6-23.6 microg/dl). An M1-muscarinic receptor specific antagonist, pirenzepine hydrochloride, also had a diminishing effect on these hormones and this inhibiting effect was partially blocked by the simultaneous administration of an anticholinesterase agent, pyridostigmine bromide. Chronic oral ingestion of these agents led to improvement in clinical symptoms, and urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroid and 17-ketosteroid levels were at normal to upper-normal levels. This is the first documentation of involvement of the cholinergic system in the pathogenesis of pituitary Cushing's syndrome.", 
    "49": "Childhood abuse is an important public health problem; however, little is known about the effects of abuse on the brain and neurobiological development. This article reviews the behavioral and biological consequences of childhood abuse and places them in a developmental context. Animal studies show that both positive and negative events early in life can influence neurobiological development in unique ways. Early stressors such as maternal separation result in lasting effects on stress-responsive neurobiological systems, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and noradrenergic systems. These studies also implicate a brain area involved in learning and memory, the hippocampus. in the long-term consequences of early stress. Clinical studies of patients with a history of abuse also implicate dysfunction in the HPA axis and the noradrenergic and hippocampal systems; however, there are multiple questions related to chronicity of stress, developmental epoch at the time of the stressor, presence of stress-related psychiatric disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder and depression. and psychological factors mediating the response to trauma that need to be addressed in this field of research. Understanding the effects of abuse on the development of the brain and neurobiology will nevertheless have important treatment and policy implications.", 
    "50": "The protective effect and mechanism of diazepam on ischemia neurons during cerebral ischemia and reperfusion were studied. Sixty-three Wistar rats were divided randomly into nine groups: control group (n = 7), ischemia (is) groups including subgroups of is3 h, is3-h/rep1-h, is3-h/rep2-h, is3-h/rep3-h(n = 7 in each group), diazepam treated groups (10 mg/kg, i.p.), including subgroups of is3-h, is3-h/rep1-h, is3-h/rep2-h, is3-h/rep3-h (n = 7 in each group) with Zea longa's animal model of middle cerebral artery occlusion. The comparison between the ischemia group and diazepam-treated group showed that diazepam could obviously decrease the production of glutamate, asparate, MDA and increase the synthesis and release of GABA, SOD and GSH-PX. It was concluded that diazepam exerted its protective effects on neurons through complex mechanisms of regulating the synthesis and release of excitotary/inhibitory amino acids and free radicals.", 
    "51": "1. Using pharmacological analysis and fura-2 spectrofluorimetry, we examined the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and related substances on intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) of hybrid neurones, called MD3 cells. The cell line was produced by fusion between a mouse neuroblastoma cell and a mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurone. 2. MD3 cells exhibited DRG neurone-like properties, such as immunoreactivity to microtubule-associated protein-2 and neurofilament proteins. Bath applications of capsaicin and alpha, beta-methylene adenosine triphosphate reversibly increased [Ca(2+)]i. However, repeated applications of capsaicin were much less effective. 3. Pressure applications of GABA (100 microM), (Z)-3-[(aminoiminomethyl) thio] prop-2-enoic acid sulphate (ZAPA; 100 microM), an agonist at low affinity GABA(A)-receptors, or KCl (25 mM), transiently increased [Ca(2+)]i. 4. Bath application of bicuculline (100 nM - 100 microM), but not picrotoxinin (10 - 25 microM), antagonized GABA-induced increases in [Ca(2+)]i in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50)=9.3 microM). 5. Ca(2+)-free perfusion reversibly abolished GABA-evoked increases in [Ca(2+)]i. Nifedipine and nimodipine eliminated GABA-evoked increases in [Ca(2+)]i. These results imply GABA response dependence on extracellular Ca(2+). 6. Baclofen (500 nM - 100 microM) activation of GABA(B)-receptors reversibly attenuated KCl-induced increases in [Ca(2+)]i in a concentration-dependent manner (EC(50)=1.8 microM). 2-hydroxy-saclofen (1 - 20 microM) antagonized the baclofen-depression of the KCl-induced increase in [Ca(2+)]i. 7. In conclusion, GABA(A)-receptor activation had effects similar to depolarization by high external K(+), initiating Ca(2+) influx through high voltage-activated channels, thereby transiently elevating [Ca(2+)]i. GABA(B)-receptor activation reduced Ca(2+) influx evoked by depolarization, possibly at Ca(2+)-channel sites in MD3 cells.", 
    "52": "The bioavailability of diazepam in rabbits after rectal administration of three formulations: organic-aqueous Relsed rectal solution (containing ethanol, benzyl alcohol and propylene glycol), submicron emulsion and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), was studied. Submicron emulsion contained MCT oil (20% w/w), egg lecithin and poloxamer; SLN were prepared with cetyl palmitate 10% w/v and non-ionic emulsifying agent, Plantacare. All formulations contained 4 mg/ml of diazepam and the dose administrated to rabbits was 2 mg/kg. In both submicron preparations nearly the same mean size of the dispersed particles (201-206 nm) and the fraction of the free drug in aqueous phase (0.9-1.5%) was determined. Besides very moderate prolongation of drug release, the submicron emulsion as a vehicle did not alter pharmacokinetics of diazepam when compared with the solution: the mean C(max) was 48.9+/-24.0 and 49.5+/-17.0 ng/ml, and area under the curve was 134.0+/-42.3 and 186.8+/-59.8 ng h/ml, for solution and emulsion, respectively. The low relative bioavailability, 47% compared to the solution, was observed after administration of SLN. Transmission electron microscopy pictures revealed that some of diazepam is present on the surface of the SLN and this fraction was immediately absorbed, while the diffusion of the drug in the solid core was not efficient enough to allow a complete release. It may be concluded that submicron emulsion may be a good choice of an ethanol-free drug formulation, but lipid matrix, which is solid at body temperature, is not advantageous system for diazepam rectal delivery, even if delivered as a submicron dispersion.", 
    "53": "Many abused drugs can be established as orally delivered reinforcers for rhesus monkeys and other animals. Benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opioids, psychomotor stimulants, dissociative anesthetics, and ethanol can come to serve as reinforcers when taken by mouth. The principal problems in establishing drugs as reinforcers by the oral route of administration are (1) aversive taste, (2) delay in onset of central nervous system effects, and (3) consumption of low volumes of drug solution. Strategies have been devised to successfully overcome these problems, and orally delivered drugs can be established as effective reinforcers. Reinforcing actions are demonstrated by consumption of greater volumes of drug solution than volumes of the water vehicle, and supporting evidence for reinforcing effects consists of the maintenance of behavior under intermittent schedules of reinforcement and the generation of orderly dose-response functions. This article presents an overview of studies of behavior reinforced by oral drug reinforcement. Factors that control oral drug intake include dose, schedule of reinforcement, food restriction, and alternative reinforcers. Many drugs, administered by the experimenter, can alter oral drug reinforcement. Relative reinforcing effects can be assessed by choice procedures and by persistence of behavior across increases in schedule size. In general, reinforcing effects increase directly with dose. Rhesus monkeys prefer combinations of reinforcing drugs to the component drugs. The taste of drug solutions may act as a conditioned reinforcer and a discriminative stimulus. Consequences of drug intake include tolerance and physiological dependence. Findings with orally self-administered drugs are similar to many findings with other positive reinforcers, including intravenously self-administered drugs.", 
    "54": "This article had several objectives. First it aimed at investigating the anxiogenic-like behaviors elicited by unavoidable cat exposure and/or cat odor across nine strains of mice (BALB/c, C57BL/6, C3H, CBA, DBA/2, NMRI, NZB, SJL, Swiss) in a modified version of the free-exploration test. The second objective was to investigate possible neurochemical changes following cat exposure in Swiss mice by measuring the turnover of dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA) and serotonin (5-HT) in several brain regions known to be involved in the modulation of emotional processes (hippocampus, hypothalamus and striatum). Finally, the third objective was to examine the effects of anxiolytic drug treatments on the anxiogenic responses elicited by a cat odor (i.e. a feces) in Swiss mice previously exposed to a cat using the free-exploration test. Results from the strain comparison showed that mice could be divided into three distinct groups: two non-reactive strains (NZB and SJL) which were relatively insensitive to predatory exposure and/or odor; five intermediate-reactive strains (Swiss, NMRI, CBA, C3H and BALB/c) which displayed clear anxiogenic-like responses only when exposed to both cat and, subsequently, to feces; and two high reactive strains (C57BL/6 and DBA/2) which showed anxiogenic-like reactions following cat exposure, regardless of the stimulus (clay or feces) present in the free-exploration cage. Neurochemical data revealed that, while brain levels of NA, DA, 5-HT in cat exposed Swiss mice were not significantly different from those of control animals, turnover rates of these monoamines were increased in the hippocampus (NA and 5-HT), hypothalamus and striatum (DA) after cat exposure. Results from pharmacological experiments indicated that repeated administration of the 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (5-20 mg/kg, twice a day, for 5 days) completely abolished avoidance of the cat feces in Swiss mice previously exposed to the predator. Neither acute nor repeated administration of the classical anxiolytic diazepam was able to reduce avoidance behavior of the anxiogenic stimulus in the free-exploration test. Taken together, these findings indicate that the exposure of mice to unavoidable predatory stimuli is associated with behavioral and neurochemical changes consistent with increased anxiety.", 
    "55": "In situ radioligand binding and quantitative autoradiography have been used to measure the density of striatal D1-like, D2-like, and GABAA receptors in rats treated with haloperidol at 0.01 or 0.1 mg/kg/ day or chlorpromazine, olanzapine or clozapine at 0.1 or 1.0 mg/kg/day for 1, 3 or 7 months. [3H]SCH23390 binding to D1-like receptors was not changed by any drug treatments. There were significant increases in [3H]nemonapride binding to D2-like receptors at different time points due to treatment with haloperidol, chlorpromazine and olanzapine. By contrast, treatment with clozapine and olanzapine caused a time-dependent decrease in [3H]muscimol binding to the GABAA receptor. These data suggest that treatment with atypical antipsychotic drugs, but not typical antipsychotic drugs, affect striatal GABAergic neurons. In addition, it would appear that clozapine might be unique in that it does not increase dopamine-D2 like receptor density at doses which would be predicted to have antipsychotic effects in humans. The extent to which such changes are involved in the therapeutic effects of drugs such as olanzapine and clozapine remains to be determined.",

    "57": "four patients were examined because of scotomas and visual loss after an incidental exposure to a strong light source. One patient (two eyes) was exposed to standard camera flash; one patient (one eye) had a brief exposure to welding light; one patient (two eyes) underwent uncomplicated phacoemulsifications with intraocular lens implantation. The fourth patient had a severe retinal phototoxicity following a secondary intraocular lens implantation. All four patients underwent a thorough assessment including history of systemic drug use. These patients had ophthalmologic evaluation including: best corrected visual acuity (ETDRS charts), fundus examination, fluorescein and indocyanine green angiographies and were followed for 1 year.", 
    "58": "on presentation, the mean visual acuity was 7.5/20 (range: 20/400-20/20). Fundus examination disclosed yellow-gray sub-retinal lesions in all affected eyes. Early phase fluorescein angiography showed one or multiple hypofluorescent spots surrounded by a halo of hyperfluorescent window defect. In the late phase, some of these spots leaked the fluorescein dye. Indocyanine green angiography demonstrated hypofluorescent spots throughout with ill-defined borders of hyperfluorescence observed during the late stages. The common finding in these four patients was the fact that they were all taking one or more photosensitizing drugs (hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, allopurinol, and benzodiazepines). Three of the patients had a full visual recovery a few months after the phototoxicity. The fourth patient remained with a visual acuity of 20/60 12 months after the light exposure. Despite the visual recovery, non-homogeneous retinal pigment epithelial disturbances persisted in all affected eyes.",

    "60": "Idiopathic epilepsies comprise a wide variety of partial and generalized syndromes that have in common a known or presumed genetic etiology and the lack of overt abnormalities other than the epilepsy itself. Most of these epilepsies have a benign natural history and/or show a favorable response to antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy, but pharmacoresistance does occur in some patients. In general, therapeutic algorithms in idiopathic partial epilepsies (IPEs) are similar to those used for symptomatic partial epilepsies, but aggressive pharmacologic therapy is rarely indicated in these patients. In self-limited conditions such as benign epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes or some forms of benign epilepsy with occipital paroxysms, AED treatment may not even be indicated unless seizures interfere significantly with quality of life. Valproate (VPA) is usually regarded as the drug of choice in idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGEs). Most patients become rapidly seizure free, and poor compliance or prescription of an inappropriate AED because of misdiagnosis are the most common causes of treatment failure in IGEs. In those patients who did not respond well to VPA (or in whom VPA is considered contraindicated), the choice of alternative AEDs is guided by syndromic diagnosis and associated possible coexistence of multiple seizure types. Lamotrigine is establishing itself as a useful agent for many refractory IGEs, and might be considered for first-line use in selected patients. Topiramate (TPM) is another promising new agent in the management of refractory tonic-clonic seizures of nonfocal onset, but its potential efficacy against other primarily generalized seizure types has not been clearly established. Some of the older drugs, particularly ethosuximide (ESM), barbiturates, and benzodiazepines (BZDs), still have an important role in the management of refractory IGEs, especially in combination with VPA. Because carbamazepine (CBZ), phenytoin (PHT), tiagabine (TGB), vigabatrin (VGB), and gabapentin (GBP) may precipitate or aggravate absence and/or myoclonic jerks, their role in IGE syndromes associated with multiple seizure types is limited mostly to adjunctive use in patients unresponsive to first-line therapy.", 
    "61": "Epileptic encephalopathies are conditions in which neurologic deterioration results mainly from epileptic activity. It can be due to very frequent or severe seizures, or to subcontinuous paroxysmal interictal activity. The former consists mainly of severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (SMEN), in which patients exhibit seizures from the middle of the first year of life with repeated episodes of status epilepticus, and migrating partial epilepsy in infancy, in which, from the first trimester of life, partial seizures affect various areas of the cortex randomly and in a subcontinuous fashion. Cases with subcontinuous paroxysmal interictal activity affect newborns with suppression bursts, thus consisting of either Ohtahara syndrome or neonatal myoclonic encephalopathy, and infants with infantile spasms (IS), although rare cases do not start until age 4 years. In childhood, it consists of various types of generalized seizures combined with either slow spike-waves of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or with myoclonus and 3-Hz spike-waves of myoclonic-astatic epilepsy, and continuous spike-waves in slow sleep (CSWS) combined with various neuropsychological patterns including Landau-Kleffner syndrome, frontal lobe syndrome, orofacial dyspraxia, or negative myoclonus. Management differs for all these syndromes, with the combination of clobazam (CLB) and stiripentol (STP) being promising for SMEN, vigabatrin (VGB) for IS, lamotrigine (LTG) for LGS, and steroids for CSWS. It is important to avoid potential drug-induced worsening by phenobarbital (PB), phenytoin (PHT), carbamazepine (CBZ), tiagabine (TGB), and VGB; in children and especially in infants, treatment with valproate is preferred each time the proper diagnosis is not reached.", 
    "62": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the cerebral cortex, maintains the inhibitory tone that counterbalances neuronal excitation. When this balance is perturbed, seizures may ensue. GABA is formed within GABAergic axon terminals and released into the synapse, where it acts at one of two types of receptor: GABAA, which controls chloride entry into the cell, and GABAB, which increases potassium conductance, decreases calcium entry, and inhibits the presynaptic release of other transmitters. GABAA-receptor binding influences the early portion of the GABA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potential, whereas GABAB binding influences the late portion. GABA is rapidly removed by uptake into both glia and presynaptic nerve terminals and then catabolized by GABA transaminase. Experimental and clinical study evidence indicates that GABA has an important role in the mechanism and treatment of epilepsy: (a) Abnormalities of GABAergic function have been observed in genetic and acquired animal models of epilepsy; (b) Reductions of GABA-mediated inhibition, activity of glutamate decarboxylase, binding to GABAA and benzodiazepine sites, GABA in cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue, and GABA detected during microdialysis studies have been reported in studies of human epileptic brain tissue; (c) GABA agonists suppress seizures, and GABA antagonists produce seizures; (d) Drugs that inhibit GABA synthesis cause seizures; and (e) Benzodiazepines and barbiturates work by enhancing GABA-mediated inhibition. Finally, drugs that increase synaptic GABA are potent anticonvulsants. Two recently developed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), vigabatrin (VGB) and tiagabine (TGB), are examples of such agents. However, their mechanisms of action are quite different (VGB is an irreversible suicide inhibitor of GABA transaminase, whereas TGB blocks GABA reuptake into neurons and glia), which may account for observed differences in drug side-effect profile.", 
    "63": "Psychotic symptoms in different neuropsychiatric disorders are treated by neuroleptic drugs. Neuroleptics are known to block dopamine (DA) neurotransmission, however, cell types mediating their actions have not been determined. Recently, astrocytes have been demonstrated to express D1- and D2-DA receptors, whose activation leads to transient increases in intracellular calcium concentration. We show here that DA-sensitivity of cortical and striatal rat astroglial cultures, as monitored by calcium imaging, is reduced by a 12-h exposure to the atypical antipsychotic agents Clozapine (>1 nmol/liter), Olanzapine (>100 nmol/liter), and Risperidone (>1 nmol/liter), but not by classical neuroleptics Haloperidol and Sulpiride. These effects could not be reverted by the receptor-specific antagonists SCH23390, Sulpiride, L745 870, Ergotamine, and Propranolol. In addition, RT-PCR and Western blot analyses concerning the effects of Clozapine, Olanzapine, and Risperidone on DA receptor expression in cortical and striatal astroglial cells revealed no alterations in mRNAs and immunoreactive protein of D1- and D2-DA receptor subtypes. These results provide the first evidence that atypical but not classical neuroleptic drugs reduce astroglial DA-sensitivity, a mechanism that may be important for a better understanding of differences in effects and side effects between atypical and classical neuroleptic drugs.",

    "66": "Thirty-two patients were identified: 27 with ovarian cancer, 4 with primary peritoneal cancer, and 1 with cervical cancer. Nine patients experienced hypersensitivity reactions during the primary regimen and 23 during chemotherapy for recurrent disease. Hypersensitivity occurred following an average of nine courses. Hypersensitivity occurred secondary to paclitaxel (10) carboplatin (16), cisplatin (4), bleomycin (1), and paclitaxel/carboplatin combination therapy (1). Patients had previously received the agent in 93.8% of carboplatin reactions, in 54.5% of paclitaxel reactions, and in all other agent reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions most commonly included flushing, dyspnea/bronchospasm, back pain, chest discomfort, pruritus, erythema, and nausea and occasionally included alterations in blood pressure or pulse rate. Reactions were successfully treated in 96.9% of patients by interrupting the infusion and administering steroids, antihistamines, benzodiazepines, nebulized beta-agonists, and/or pressors. Seventeen patients underwent desensitization, one to two agents, with 94% success. Nine of ten patients had successful iv desensitization, and 8/10 patients had successful oral desensitization. One failure on the oral regimen had previous successful iv desensitization.",

A range of doses of oral cocaine (50-300 mg), methylphenidate (15-90 mg), triazolam (0.125-0.75 mg), and placebo were then tested to determine whether they shared discriminative-stimulus and participant-rated effects with 200 mg cocaine. Cocaine and methylphenidate dose-dependently increased cocaine-appropriate responding, produced prototypical stimulant-like participant-rated drug effects (e.g., increased participant ratings of Drug Liking), and increased heart rate and blood pressure. Triazolam produced low levels of cocaine-appropriate responding and impaired performance. Thus, consistent with previous studies, humans can reliably discriminate oral cocaine. Consistent with in vivo behavioral neuropharmacological data, the discriminative-stimulus, participant-rated, and physiological effects of oral cocaine and methylphenidate were similar.",

Patients were stabilized on 80 mg of methadone per day. After stabilization patients participated in methadone self-administration sessions. During each session, 128 presses (fixed ratio 128) of 1 button delivered 10 ml of 0.054 mg/ml methadone solution. The same number of button presses on a 2nd button delivered 10 ml of vehicle. Forty-five min prior to the self-administration session, 0 (placebo), 5, 10, or 20 mg per 70 kg body weight diazepam was administered. Ratings of drug liking, goodness, strength, and high were collected 5, 30, 60, 90, and 150 min after the end of the self-administration session.

Alprazolam was administered chronically as a daily bolus dose (2 mg/kg) via the intravenous route. Alprazolam decreased the reinforcement rate and increased the shorter response (nonreinforced) rate in a dose- and time-related fashion. Tolerance did not develop to the decreases in reinforcement rate; tolerance to increases in shorter response rate was negligible, occurring only at the low-concentration range. Clinically, an optimal dose regimen should be designed to avoid the tolerance development that occurs in the low serum benzodiazepine concentration range.",

On the other hand, elderly-onset depression has more cerebro-vascular changes such as deep white matter lesion and periventricular hyperintensity on MRI than young-onset depression. These findings together leads new disease category 'vascular depression' (VD), meaning depression primarily caused by cerebral infarction. VD patients show less family history and symptomatic changes within a day than those with non-vascular depression. Though anti-depressants are effective on VD, they have higher incidence of side effect on VD than on non-vascular depression. Benzodiazepines and cerebral circulation and metabolism enhancers are also used in VD therapy. The prognosis of VD is worse than that of non-VD or cerebral infarction without depression.",

Almost half of the neuroleptic prescriptions were given for patients aged 65 years or over. Only 40% were prescribed by psychiatrists or neurologists. Throughout the period from 1986 to 1995, neuroleptic prescriptions increased steadily, which was paralleled by a decrease in the prescription rates for benzodiazepines.",

    "76": "Case studies reveal that opiate addicts often premedicate themselves with benzodiazepine (BDZ) tranquilizers prior to taking their opiate. It has been hypothesized that such actions occur because the BDZ enhances the euphoric or reinforcing properties of the opiate. The present study tested this hypothesis in the animal laboratory. Sprague-Dawley rats were used to examine whether the magnitude of conditioned preferences for a distinctive environment associated with intravenous heroin delivery would be augmented by intraperitoneal alprazolam pretreatment. Results demonstrated that alprazolam produced a leftward shift of the heroin dose-response curve in the conditioned place preference test. The data obtained are consistent with the view that BDZs can augment the affective response to heroin in laboratory animals.", 
    "77": "Interactions between neurotransmitter receptors involved in the pathophysiology of depression, anxiety and ethanol consumption and two extracts (hydromethanolic and lipophilic extracts obtained with hypercritical CO2) from Hypericum Perforatum L or St. John's wort (SJW) and three constituents (hyperforin, hypericin and biapigenin) were evaluated by in vitro binding assays. The two extracts, tested at 10 microg/ml, did not inhibit ligand binding at the following receptors: serotonin 5-HT6 and 5-HT7, benzodiazepine, sigma and neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y1 and Y2 receptors. The hydromethanolic extract, but not the lipophilic extract, interacted with GABA(A) receptors (IC50 5.5 microg/ml), while both interacted with the dopamine (DA) transporters, albeit with high IC50 values (24.5 and 12.9 microg/ml, respectively). Biapigenin (1 microg/ml, 2 microM) inhibited ligand binding at benzodiazepine receptors only (IC50: 2 microM). Hyperforin (1 microg/ml, 2 microM) only inhibited [3H]WIN-35,428 binding to DA transporters, although the IC50 (5 microM) was higher than the IC50 found for inhibition of the synaptosomal DA reuptake (0.8 microM). This finding extended the same observation previously described for the 5-HTergic system to the DAergic system, confirming that the inhibition of monoamine reuptake is due to a different mechanism than that of synthetic antidepressants. Hypericin showed micromolar affinities for both NPY-Y1 and Y2 receptors and for sigma receptors (IC50 3-4 microM). These hypericin activities might be of interest because NPY and sigma receptors have been associated with anxiety disorders, depressive illnesses and ethanol consumption. However, they were present at relatively high hypericin concentrations, and were also light-dependent (i.e. the IC50 values increased when binding assays were carried out in the dark). Thus, our in vitro binding results may suggest that either the pharmacological effects of SJW are due to other molecules than hypericin or hyperforin (other constituents or active metabolites), or that the mechanism of action is different from those that have been considered up to now.", 
    "78": "The fear of \"choking to death\" is on the mind of most patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). So far, however, there have been no systematic surveys concerning the dying phase in a general ALS population. We therefore performed a structured telephone interview with the relatives of 121 patients who died from ALS and were followed by the Motor Neuron Outpatient Clinic of the Department of Neurology, University of Munich, Germany. These data are compared with those obtained by a retrospective analysis of medical records of 50 ALS patients who were followed by the Wisdom Hospice, Rochester, UK. The data show that most ALS patients (Germany 88%, UK 98%) died peacefully, and no patient \"choked to death\". The symptoms most frequently reported for the last 24 hours were dyspnoea, coughing, anxiety and restlessness. Around half (G 55%, UK 52%) of the patients died at home. The main palliative measures in place during the terminal phase were: home mechanical ventilation (G 21%, UK 0%), percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (G 27%, UK 14%), morphine (G 27%, UK 82%) and benzodiazepines (G 32%, UK 64%). The use of these palliative measures was judged to be beneficial by almost all relatives. These data support the hypothesis of a peaceful death process in ALS and should be communicated to patients and their relatives, at the latest after the onset of dyspnoea, to relieve unwarranted fears.",

    "83": "Forty-eight horses subjected to elective surgery were randomly assigned to three groups of 16 horses. After premedication with 0.1 mg/kg acepromazine intramuscularly and 0.6 mg/kg xylazine intravenously, anaesthesia was induced either with 2 g thiopentone in 500 ml of a 10 per cent guaifenesin solution, given intravenously at a dose of 1 ml/kg (group TG), or with 100 mg/kg guaifenesin and 2.2 mg/kg ketamine given intravenously (group KG), or with 0.06 mg/kg midazolam, and 2.2 mg/kg ketamine given intravenously (group KM). Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane. The mean (sd) end tidal isoflurane concentration (per cent) needed to maintain a light surgical anaesthesia (stage III, plane 2) was significantly lower in group KM (0.91 [0.03]) than in groups TG (1.11 [0.03]) and KG (1.14 [0.03]). The mean (sd) arterial pressure (mmHg) was significantly lower in group KG (67.4 [2.07]) than in groups TC (75.6 [2.23]) and KM (81.0 [2.16]). There were no significant differences in the logarithm of the heart rate, recovery time or quality of recovery between the three induction groups. However, pronounced ataxia was observed in the horses of group KM, especially after periods of anaesthesia lasting less than 75 minutes.", 
    "84": "Though substance abuse and its deleterious health sequelae are a serious problem in Taiwan, licit and illicit substance use patterns among nurses are understudied. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of substance use and to identify its related factors among clinical nurses. A total of 907 registered nurses were recruited for this study via stratified-random sampling from hospitals in Kaohsiung city. Each participant was requested to reply to a structured questionnaire anonymously and a 98.1% response rate was achieved. Prevalence of substance use during the past year was estimated as follows: alcohol drinking (regular use-3.8%); coffee drinking (regular use-44.7%); cigarette smoking (regular use-0.2%); regular use of analgesics 21.1%; regular use of benzodiazepines 1.8%; use of narcotics (ever use-0.7%). Significant factors related to substance use were analyzed by logistic regression. This revealed that for regular alcohol use, the significant factor was a positive attitude toward substance use; for BZD drug use, they were poor mental health, positive attitude toward substance use, being unmarried, and used analgesics; for regular analgesics use, they were work in non-critical care unit, self-perceived poor health status, and BZD drug use. Results generated from this study may act as reference for nursing administration to develop an effective health promotion program of physical and mental health for the clinical nurses.", 
    "85": "In this experiment we address the pharmacological modulation of repetition priming, a basic form of learning, using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. We measured brain activity in a word-stem completion paradigm in which, before study, volunteers were given either placebo, lorazepam (2 mg orally), or scopolamine (0.4 mg, i.v.). Relative to placebo, both drugs attenuated the behavioral expression of priming. Repetition was associated with a decreased neuronal response in left extrastriate, left middle frontal, and left inferior frontal cortices in the placebo group. Both drugs abolished these \"repetition suppression\" effects. By showing a concurrence of behavioral and neuronal modulations, the results suggest that GABAergic and cholinergic systems influence the neuronal plasticity necessary for repetition priming.", 
    "86": "Prohibitin is an evolutionary conserved protein that is associated with cellular differentiation, atresia, and luteolysis in the rat ovary. However, the specific cellular location and function of prohibitin in ovarian cells has not been clearly elucidated. To characterize the expression of prohibitin during cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell death, we have successfully established a temperature-sensitive granulosa cell line, designated RGA-1. At a permissive temperature of 33 C, RGA-1 cells proliferate, but revert to a differentiated phenotype at a nonpermissive temperature of 39 C. Significant inductions of prohibitin mRNA and protein expression were observed in the differentiated phenotype when compared with proliferating cells. Differentiated RGA-1 cells were found to express inhibin alpha- and beta-transcripts, as well as steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor proteins in a manner reminiscent of steroidogenic functional responses observed in primary differentiated granulosa cells. Prohibitin expression correlated well with the expression of these steroidogenic proteins. At 39 C, RGA-1 cells also displayed increases in p53 protein levels, indicative of growth arrest in the nonproliferating cells. Confocal and electron microscopic examinations revealed increased prohibitin localization to the mitochondria at 39 C, along with changes in mitochondrial size and shape. These changes were accompanied by marked reductions in cytochrome c oxidase subunit II levels and in unit mitochondrial transmembrane potential. In addition, cell fractionation studies demonstrated that the prohibitin protein was mainly localized to the mitochondrial membrane. Collectively, these findings suggest a role for prohibitin in mitochondrial structure and function during growth and differentiation in ovarian granulosa cells. Prohibitin expression may also be indicative of mitochondrial destabilization during apoptosis-related events.", 
    "87": "Venlafaxine is a phenethylamine antidepressant which inhibits both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and is structurally unrelated to the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Its major metabolite, O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV), also inhibits serotonin reuptake. Although metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) system, venlafaxine inhibits CYP 2D6 and 3A4 to a far lesser extent than do the SSRIs. Mechanisms of drug action are reviewed and evaluated in the investigation of 12 fatalities occurring over a 6-month-period where venlafaxine was detected.Venlafaxine and ODV were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) using atmospheric pressure ionization (API) electrospray in positive mode following an n-butyl chloride extraction. Postmortem tissue concentrations studied in each of 12 postmortem cases for venlafaxine and ODV, were 0.1-36 and <0.05-3.5mg/l (peripheral blood), <0.05-22 and <0.05-9.9mg/kg (liver), <0.05-10 and <0.05-1.5mg/l (vitreous), <0.05-53 and <0.05-6.8mg/l (bile), <0.05-55 and <0.05-21mg/l (urine), respectively, and 0.1-200mg of venlafaxine in the gastric contents. Venlafaxine was typically present with other drugs, including other antidepressants, alcohol, and benzodiazepines. The potential for interaction with each drug is discussed. Over the 6-month-period of this study, there were no deaths ascribed solely to venlafaxine intoxication.", 
    "88": "Buprenorphine at high dosage became available in France in 1996, as a substitution treatment for heroin addicts. Since this date, numerous deaths were attributed to this drug. This paper reports two original series of 39 and 78 fatalities involving buprenorphine observed at the Institute of Legal Medicine of Strasbourg and at 13 other French forensic centers, respectively. The files were recorded from January 1996-May 2000. The first 20 fatalities that were previously published were excluded from this epidemiological study. From these 117 subjects, 96 were male (82%). Buprenorphine and its primary metabolite norbuprenophine were assayed in post-mortem blood by HPLC/MS (n=11 labs) or by GC/MS (n=3 labs). Blood levels for buprenorphine ranged from 0.5 to 51.0ng/ml (mean 10.2ng/ml) and 0.1 to 76ng/ml (mean 12.6ng/ml) in Strasbourg and the other centers, respectively. Blood levels for norbuprenorphine ranged from 0.2 to 47.1ng/ml (mean 8.2ng/ml) and <0.1 to 65ng/ml (mean 10.6ng/ml) in Strasbourg and the other centers, respectively. The mean values appear to be within the therapeutic range. Buprenorphine was identified in 24 of the 26 hair samples assayed in Strasbourg, at concentrations ranging from 10 to 1080pg/mg. Intravenous injection of crushed tablets, a concomitant intake of psychotropics (especially benzodiazepines and neuroleptics) and the high dosage of the buprenorphine formulation available in France appear as the major risk factors for such fatalities. In addition, two suicide-related deaths were also observed, with blood buprenorphine concentrations at 144 and 3276ng/ml.", 
    "89": "The aim with this study was to evaluate the accuracy of several on-site testing devices on the market. A part of this study is included in the European Union's (EU's) roadside testing assessment project (ROSITA). An other request for this kind of study came from the Finnish prison department in the Ministry of Justice. The evaluation was performed on both urine assays and oral fluid assays. The on-site test results were compared with laboratory results (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS)). The samples were tested on amphetamines (AMP), cannabinoids (THC), opiates (OPI) and cocaine metabolites (COC). Some of the tests also included a metamphetamine (MET) and a benzodiazepine (BZO) test. Both positive and negative samples were tested. A total of 800 persons and eight on-site devices for urine and two for oral fluid testing were included in this study. Good results were obtained for the urine on-site devices, with accuracies of 93-99% for amphetamines, 97-99% for cannabinoids, 94-98% for opiates and 90-98% for benzodiazepines. However, differences in the ease of performance and interpretation of test result were observed. It was possible to detect amphetamines and opiates in oral fluid by the used on-site devices, but the benzodiazepines and cannabinoids did not fulfil the needs of sensitivity.", 
    "90": "The Correctional Service of Canada implemented a urine drug-screening program over 10 years ago. The objective of this report is to describe the program and drug test results in this program for 1999. Offenders in Canadian federal correctional institutions and those living in the community on conditional release were subject to urine drug testing. Urine specimens were collected at correctional facilities and shipped by courier to MAXXAM Analytics Inc. laboratory. All urine specimens were analyzed for amphetamines, cannabinoids, cocaine metabolite (benzoylecgonine), opiates, phencyclidine, benzodiazepines, methyl phenidate, meperidine, pentazocine and fluoxetine by immunoassay screening (homogeneous EIA and ELISA assays) followed by GC-MS confirmation. Ethyl alcohol was analyzed when specifically requested. Alternative screening and confirmation methods with lower cut-off values were used, whenever urine specimens were dilute (creatinine <20mg/dl and specific gravity <or=1.003). The number of urine specimens analyzed was 44,722 in 1999 and 6.2% of these specimens were dilute based on creatinine and specific gravity analysis. The positive rate for one or more drugs was 25.5% in 1999. The highest drug positive rates were for cannabinoids (10.7%), morphine (3.2%), cocaine metabolite (3.2%), codeine (2.6%), oxazepam (2.1%), temazepam (1.1%) and ethyl alcohol (1.0%). In correctional institutions (8606 non-dilute specimens analyzed in 1999), 16.4% were positive for cannabinoids, 4.9% positive for codeine and/or morphine and 2.7% positive for oxazepam and/or temazepam. In the 537 dilute specimens collected in institutions, 21% were positive for cannabinoids, 1.3% positive for codeine and/or morphine and 1.3% positive for oxazepam and/or temazepam. In the community setting, 33,928 non-dilute specimens were collected in 1999 (9.0% were positive for cannabinoids and 3.5% positive for cocaine metabolite). In the 1651 dilute specimens collected from offenders in the community in 1999, 12.6% were positive for cannabinoids and 9.5% positive for cocaine metabolite. We conclude that forensic urine drug testing provides an objective measure of drug use by offenders in Canadian federal institutions and those offenders living in the community on conditional release.", 
    "91": "Several reports have indicated that melatonin modulates striatal dopaminergic functions via its interaction with central and peripheral benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors. Clinical reports and animal studies speculated on the possible involvement of melatonin in the pathophysiology of tardive dyskinesia (TD). In view of this, the present experiment was performed to study the possible effect of melatonin in modulation of reserpine-induced dyskinesia. Melatonin (1-10 mg/kg) dose dependently suppressed the severity of vacuous chewing movements (VCMs) in rats. Prior administration of the putative melatonin receptor antagonists luzindole (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) or prazosin (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) failed to antagonize melatonin (2.5 mg/kg) reversal of reserpine-induced VCMs. However, the peripheral BZ receptor antagonist PK11195 (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) but not flumazenil (1 and 2 mg/kg), dose dependently antagonized melatonin's reversal of reserpine-induced VCMs. Taken together the present results demonstrate that melatonin reverses reserpine-induced VCMs and that this could be due to enhancement of GABAergic activity via peripheral BZ receptors.",

    "96": "Large species differences have been previously observed in the pharmacology of bradykinin (BK) B2 receptor antagonists. We investigated the effect of two novel non-peptide antagonists, compound 9 (a benzodiazepine peptidomimetic related to icatibant) and the thiosemicarbazide bradyzide on the rabbit B2 receptor (contractility of the jugular vein, competition of [3H]BK binding to a B2 receptor-green fluorescent protein (B2R-GFP) conjugate, subcellular distribution of B2R-GFP). While compound 9 is about 9000-fold less potent than icatibant, it shares with the latter peptide drug a selective, insurmountable and largely irreversible antagonist behavior against BK and the capacity to translocate B2R-GFP from the membrane into the cells. Bradyzide, reportedly very potent at rodent B2 receptors, was a competitive and reversible antagonist of moderate potency at the rabbit B2 receptor (contractility pA2 6.84, binding competition IC50 5 nM). The C-terminal region of icatibant, reproduced by compound 9, is likely to be important in the non-equilibrium behavior of icatibant. Bradyzide, a non-peptide antagonist developed on different structural grounds, is competitive at the rabbit B2 receptor.", 
    "97": "Activated microglia have a key role in the brain's immune response to neuronal degeneration. The transition of microglia from the normal resting state to the activated state is associated with an increased expression of receptors known as peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites, which are abundant on cells of mononuclear phagocyte lineage. We used brain imaging to study expression of these sites in healthy individuals and patients with Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "98": "We studied 15 normal individuals (age 32-80 years), eight patients with Alzheimer's disease, and one patient with minimal cognitive impairment.

    "101": "Ziprasidone is a novel antipsychotic agent with a unique combination of pharmacological activities at human receptors. Ziprasidone has high affinity for human 5-HT receptors and for human dopamine D(2) receptors. Ziprasidone is a 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist and an antagonist at 5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2C) and 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors. Additionally, ziprasidone inhibits neuronal uptake of 5-HT and norepinephrine comparable to the antidepressant imipramine. This unique pharmacological profile of ziprasidone may be related to its clinical effectiveness as a treatment for the positive, negative and affective symptoms of schizophrenia with a low propensity for extrapyramidal side effects, cognitive deficits and weight gain.", 
    "102": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is composed of three subunits with molecular masses of 18, 30, and 32 kDa. Many physiological functions have been attributed to the PBR, including regulation of steroidogenesis. Furthermore, the PBR itself is under hormonal regulation. In the current study, we investigated the role of female gonadal sex hormones in the regulation of PBR expression in steroidogenic and nonsteroidogenic tissues. To accomplish this, adult female rats were pharmacologically castrated using chronic administration of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist decapeptyl (triptorelin-D-Trp(6)-LHRH). Half of these rats received 17beta-estradiol as hormone replacement, while a control group received daily injections of vehicle only. We found that PBR binding capacity dropped by 40 and 48% in ovaries and adrenals, respectively, following decapeptyl administration, as opposed to no change in the kidney. This down-regulation of PBR densities was prevented by estradiol replacement. We did not find evidence for transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and translational mechanisms in this decapeptyl-induced down-regulation. In contrast, immunoprecipitation of the PBR complex, using antibodies against the 18- and 32-kDa subunits of the complex, demonstrated that there were changes in PBR subunit interactions, consistent with the down-regulation of PBR binding capacity. These findings represent a novel hormone-dependent posttranslational regulatory mechanism.", 
    "103": "According to current theories, schizophrenia results from altered connectivity in brain circuits for fundamental cognitive operations. Consequently, the poorly understood mechanisms of neuroleptic treatment may be explainable by altered functional interactions within such networks. The 'cognitive dysmetria' model hypothesizes that one key structure in these circuits is the cerebellum. To investigate the effects of olanzapine on cerebellar functional connectivity (CFC), a seed-voxel correlation analysis (SVCA) was used in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of a simple finger-tapping task.", 
    "104": "fMRI scans were obtained from six schizophrenic patients under both drug-free and olanzapine-treated conditions and from a matched control group of six healthy subjects at corresponding time points. SVCAs were performed for anatomically and functionally standardized seed voxels in the anterior cerebellum. SVCA results were then processed by three different randomization analyses.", 
    "105": "The analyses revealed that olanzapine caused widespread changes of CFC, including prominent changes in prefrontal cortex and mediodorsal thalamus. Significant changes in motor structures were found after subtractions within both groups and may thus indicate repetition effects rather than drug effects. Olanzapine 'normalized' the patients' CFC patterns for the right, but not for the left cerebellum.", 
    "106": "Even for a simple motor task, olanzapine affects functional interactions between the cerebellum and many non-motor brain regions, including elements of the 'cognitive dysmetria' circuit. Altogether, our findings suggest that olanzapine has a stronger differential effect on neural activity in prefrontal cortex and thalamus than in motor structures.", 
    "107": "There has been few reports on the effective treatment for SOD, which is phenomenologically similar to TD. A 66-year-old female with SOD was successfully treated by CNZ 2 mg/day. Even after one year of continuous treatment, tolerance, which is the major problem in the CNZ treatment for TD, did not develop. This report suggests that CNZ is effective at least for some patients with SOD.", 
    "108": "Small platform (SP) stress was induced by placing mice on small platforms (3.5 cm diameter) surrounded by water for 24 h. This model contains several factors of stress like rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation, isolation, immobilization and falling into the water. The staircase test consisted of placing a mouse in an enclosed staircase with 5 steps and recording (1) the number of steps and (2) rearings made during 3 min. SP stress increased the exploratory activity of mice in the staircase test as evidenced by an increase in the number of steps and rearings made In control mice diazepam (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) induced an anxiolytic effect in the staircase test as evidenced by a decrease in the number of rearings without changes in the number of steps. In SP stressed mice the anxiolytic effect of diazepam was not seen and the sedative effect as evidenced by a decrease in the number of steps was more pronounced. Buspirone at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg did not have effect on the behaviour of control or SP stressed mice in the staircase test. To study possible diurnal variations the staircase test was carried out at 3 different times of a day (08:00, 14:00, 20:00) with control and SP stressed mice. The exploratory activity of control mice in the staircase test gradually increased from 08:00 to 20:00 as evidenced by an increased number of steps and rearings made. SP stress increased the exploratory activity of mice irrespective of the time of testing. In conclusion, on the basis of these data the authors can propose that SP stress increases the exploratory activity of mice in the staircase test and induces a hyposensitivity of mice to the anxiolytic effect of diazepam. The effect of SP stress on the behaviour of mice in the staircase test is not caused by the disruptance of diurnal rhythms.",

    "110": "Leptin, a hormone primarily secreted from adipocytes, plays a key role in controlling body weight homeostasis. In vitro studies indicate that it is also implicated in immune responses. Hyperleptinaemia has been reported in acute inflammation, especially during the early stages of intestinal inflammation in rats. The present study investigated the possible role of leptin in the pathogenesis of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in rats. Since no specific antagonist of leptin is available, a CCK-B antagonist (YM022) and a beta3 agonist (BRL37344) were used in this study to inhibit leptin secretion. Colitis was induced by intracolonic instillation of TNBS in rats. Five TNBS-groups were subcutaneously implanted with micropumps containing: placebo, YM022, BRL37344, BRL37344 and exogenous leptin simultaneously, or leptin alone. At sacrifices, colitis severity was assessed by macroscopic and histological scoring systems and by determination of tissue myeloperoxidase activity. The TNBS-induced hyperleptinaemia was significantly reduced by YM022 and BRL37344 (p<0.05). Inhibition of leptin secretion markedly reduced colonic inflammation, whatever the criteria considered (i.e. macroscopic, histological or biochemical). In contrast, administration of exogenous leptin completely abolished the beneficial effect of leptin-lowering drugs on colitis severity. These results provide the first direct evidence for an important deleterious role of leptin in the pathogenesis of experimental intestinal inflammation and suggest that a pro-inflammatory activity is attributable to leptin in vivo. Further studies are required to determine if these results have clinical significance.", 
    "111": "To investigate the role of extracorporeal detoxification in cirrhotic patients with advanced hepatic encephalopathy not responding to medical treatment, 20 patients were randomized to receive six hours of additional sorbent dialysis or ongoing standardized medical treatment. Following treatment, the clinical stage of encephalopathy remained unchanged in both groups. Abnormal sensory evoked potentials improved following sorbent dialysis (N70 latency, 128 ms before versus 110 ms after treatment, P<0,05; cervico-cranial transmission, 7.7 ms versus 6.8 ms, P<0.01) indicating improvement in important aspects of cerebral function. In contrast, brain function remained unchanged following medical treatment (N70 latency, 114 ms versus 113 ms; cervico-cranial transmission, 7.7 ms versus 7.2 ms, P=NS, respectively). Serum benzodiazepine levels decreased significantly after sorbent dialysis but not after medical treatment. Biocompatibility of sorbent dialysis was limited and clinical complications occurred in a proportion of patients. In conclusion, a six-hour treatment with sorbent suspension dialysis did not ameliorate the clinical stage of HE but improved neurophysiologic function in cirrhotic patients who had not responded to conventional medical treatment.", 
    "112": "Stiff man syndrome (SMS), an uncommon neurological disease, is characterised by symmetrical muscle stiffness and spasms that often lead to skeletal deformity. Variants of the syndrome may involve one limb only (stiff leg syndrome), a variety of additional neurological symptoms and signs such as eye movement disturbances, ataxia, or Babinski signs (progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus), or be associated with malignant disease (paraneoplastic SMS). Antineuronal autoimmunity and accompanying autoimmune diseases, most often insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, are characteristic features of SMS and its variants. The condition is frequently misinterpreted as psychogenic movement disturbance, but electromyographic abnormalities and the presence of autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid help to establish the correct diagnosis. The aetiology of SMS is obscure. However, several features suggest that SMS is an autoimmune-mediated chronic encephalomyelitis. In line with this hypothesis, immunomodulation with a front-loaded methylprednisolone regimen reduces stiffness and spasms and improves other neurological symptoms in the majority of patients. Plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulins are effective less frequently. For symptomatic treatment, the benzodiazepines are drugs of first choice. An alternative of last resort is baclofen administered intrathecally via an implanted pump device.",

The primary end points were adequate stem cell mobilising ability (>1% circulating CD34-positive cells) and collection (> or = 4 x 10(6) CD34-positive cells/kg), and safety. The secondary end point was activity against myeloma. The regimen (d-TEC) consisted of dexamethasone, paclitaxel 200 mg/m(2) i.v., etoposide 60 mg/kg i.v., cyclophosphamide 3 g/m(2) i.v., and G-CSF 5-10 microg/kg/day i.v. A total of 84 cycles were administered to these 41 individuals. Patient characteristics included a median age of 53 years, a median of five prior chemotherapy cycles, and a median interval of 10 months from diagnosis of myeloma to first cycle of d-TEC. Seventy-five percent of the patients had stage II or III disease, 50% had received carmustine and/or melphalan previously, and 25% had received prior radiation therapy. Eighty-eight percent of patients mobilised adequately after the first cycle of d-TEC and 91% mobilized adequately after the second cycle. An adequate number of stem cells were collected in 32 patients. Of the remaining nine patients, three mobilised, but stem cells were not collected, two mobilised but stem cell collection was < 4 x 10(6) CD34-positive cells/kg, three did not mobilise, and one died of disease progression. Major toxicities included pancytopenia, alopecia, fever and stomatitis. One patient died from multi-organ failure and progressive disease. Fifty percent of evaluable patients demonstrated a partial response and 28.6% of patients had a minor response. This novel dose-intense regimen was safe, capable of stem cell mobilisation and collection, even in heavily pre-treated patients, and active against the underlying myeloma.", 
    "115": "This study tested the hypotheses that in utero exposure to diazepam (DZ): (1) exerts long-lasting effects on GABA(A) receptor function by altering GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNA levels in specific brain regions of adult animals and/or (2) alters GABA(A) subunit mRNA expression in exposed fetuses. We assayed levels of mRNAs encoding several of the most predominant GABA(A) receptor subunits as well as cyclophilin mRNA. Analysis of mRNA levels in the cortex in adults showed that only gamma2S mRNA levels varied significantly with prenatal drug exposure, an effect unrelated to DZ action to the GABA(A) receptor. Analysis in fetuses indicated that mRNA levels varied as a function of both fetal sex and fetal drug environment. Irrespective of sex, DZ exposure increased both alpha1 and cyclophilin mRNAs in fetal brainstem whereas the mRNA levels of gamma2S were increased and decreased, respectively, in the telencephalon and hypothalamus of DZ-exposed fetuses.", 
    "116": "Systemic injection of glutamate NMDA receptor antagonists or drugs that facilitate GABA(A)-mediated neurotransmission produces anxiolytic effects. The dorsomedial hypothalamic (DMH) region is proposed to be a possible site of action of these drugs. The objective of the present study was to investigate if facilitation of GABA(A)-mediated neurotransmission or blockade of NMDA receptors in the DMH would produce anxiolytic effects in the elevated plus-maze (EPM). Seven days after surgery, male Wistar rats with unilateral cannulas in the DMH were submitted to the behavioral studies. Results showed that midazolam, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic (30-60 nmol/0.3 microl), produced a dose-dependent increase in open arm exploration without changing the number of enclosed arm entries, indicating an anxiolytic effect. This effect was antagonized by previous treatment with flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist (60 nmol/0.3 microl). Flumazenil alone had an anxiogenic effect, decreasing exploration of the open arms of the EPM. 2-Amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (AP7), an NMDA receptor antagonist (0.2-2 nmol/0.3 microl), did not modify open arm exploration but decreased general exploratory activity. These results indicate that benzodiazepine receptors located in the DMH could modulate anxiety. Interference with NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission in this region, however, seems to change general exploratory activity rather than anxiety.", 
    "117": "Behavioral effects of desamino-3-iodozacopride (DAIZAC) [(S)-5-chloro-3-iodo-2-methoxy-N-(1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl)benzamide], a selective high-affinity 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist (K(D) 0.14 nM), were evaluated in the mouse elevated plus-maze using the anxiolytic benzodiazepine, diazepam, as a positive control. DAIZAC treatment produced a significant dose-related increase in the time spent in the open arm. The increased total time in the open arm resulted from a significant dose-dependent increase in the number of entries into that arm. The minimum dose of DAIZAC associated with a statistically significant increase in entries and time spent in the open arm was 0.05 mg/kg ip, consistent with its high affinity for the 5-HT(3) receptor. DAIZAC did not affect the amount of time spent in the open arm after each entry. Thus, DAIZAC reduced apparent avoidance of the open arm when the animal was in the central compartment, without affecting active avoidance of that arm when the animal was in the exposed condition. The increase in the open-arm entries was accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the number of entries into the closed arm with a consequent reduction in the time spent in the closed arm. The time spent in the closed arm after each entry was not altered by DAIZAC administration. As such, the sole apparent effect of DAIZAC was to alter the choice of arm to enter when the animal was in the central compartment. Diazepam also significantly increased total time in the open arm; however, the increase was not attributable to a single behavioral factor. The anxiolytic-like effects of DAIZAC reached maximum by 20-30 min and returned to baseline levels by 90 min. Ex vivo binding studies found that levels of DAIZAC-like activity assayed in brains of mice 25 min after DAIZAC injection were significantly correlated with the behavioral parameters associated with anxiolysis. These results indicate that DAIZAC produces dose-dependent anxiolytic-like behavioral changes in the mouse elevated plus-maze that are correlated with brain DAIZAC-like activity.", 
    "118": "The effects of repeated administration of nicotine on contextual fear conditioning, locomotor activity, and pain threshold, were examined in rats. It was found that a single injection of nicotine prior to the training session (three 0.7-mA footshocks, each 0.5 s long), decreased the freezing reaction during the retest 24 h later. The locomotor activity was moderately enhanced, and the pain threshold remained unchanged. The baseline freezing measured immediately after administration of a single dose of nicotine was not significantly different from the saline-treated group. The anxiolytic-like effect of nicotine was as potent as that of midazolam, a benzodiazepine derivative. After five day-by-day injections, the anxiolytic-like effect of nicotine (0.6 mg/kg, sc) was no longer present, independently whether the last drug injection was given 24 h or 5 min (i.e., the sixth, additional, nicotine injection), prior to the training session. Thus, it appeared that the expression of tolerance to the nicotine-induced anxiolytic-like action did not require a direct stimulation of nicotinic receptors. Simultaneously, in this group of animals, nicotine caused a potent stimulation of locomotor activity in the open field test. The applied dosage and regimen of nicotine administration did not change rat pain threshold (flinch-jump test). Collectively, the present data showed for the first time, that short-term, intermittent, administration of nicotine was sufficient to induce tolerance to the anxiolytic-like effect of this drug, in the model of fear conditioning to context. Importantly, a clear dissociation between the locomotor and anxiolytic-like effects of nicotine was present. This effect appeared independent also of changes in rat pain threshold. The possible mechanisms of this phenomenon are discussed.", 
    "119": "Male and female rats were exposed for 3 weeks to diazepam (DZ)-filled or empty capsules (CTR) prior to the daily administration of morphine (MOR, 5 mg/kg, IP) for 5 days. Thereafter, capsules were removed and 48 h later MOR was injected for the next 5 days. The tail-flick latency (TFL) was measured prior to and 15, 30, and 60 min after MOR assessed analgesia. Locomotion (LOC) was determined before and 15 min after injection. Prior to MOR injection (baseline), male rats were more sensitive to the thermal stimulus and were less active than female rats. Daily MOR injections neither affected the baseline TFL nor LOC. Regardless of gender, MOR produced greater analgesia in DZ-dependent and withdrawn rats than in CTR. MOR analgesia was greater in DZ-dependent male than in female rats. Gender differences in MOR analgesia were not of statistical significance in DZ-withdrawn rats. The first dose of MOR produced more depression of LOC in DZ-dependent female than in male rats. Across the time of MOR injections, female DZ-dependent and withdrawn rats were less active than CTR. LOC increased with repeated administration of MOR in all groups of rats. In summary, DZ dependence and withdrawal enhanced MOR analgesia in rats of both sexes. Regardless of chronic treatment, MOR produced more analgesia and less depression of LOC in male than in female rats. It is suggested that a decrease in the function of the GABAergic system plays a role in alteration of MOR analgesia.", 
    "120": "The neural mechanisms underlying benzodiazepine (BZD) dependence remain equivocal. The present studies tested the hypothesis that similar neural circuitry might be involved in the effects of chronic 7-chloro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-3H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2(1H)-one, diazepam (DZ, Roche), administration and withdrawal. The results of our study showed an increased hippocampal synaptic plasticity in slices from rats chronically treated with DZ (5 mg/kg/18 days), assessed as a decrease of the threshold in the stimulation rate for long-term potentiation (LTP) elicitation. Rats with the same schedule of DZ administration but without signs of withdrawal behaved similarly to vehicle-treated ones (VEH), in the threshold to induce LTP. Furthermore, the activity of locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine (NE) neurons in rats tested 24 h after the last DZ injection showed a significant increase. On the other hand, rats that after chronic DZ administration did not develop signs of withdrawal and exhibited a similar pattern of discharge on LC-NE nucleus compared with their controls. We conclude that chronic DZ administration enhances both hippocampal synaptic plasticity and activity of LC-NE neurons. This neural system could be the biological substrate underlying the behavioral alterations accompanying chronic DZ administration and withdrawal.", 
    "121": "Benzodiazepines and 5-HT(1A) agonists have been widely used as anxiolytic agents. Some clinical reports document that 5-HT(1A) agonists induce memory impairment to a lesser degree than diazepam. In the present study, we compared the effects of diazepam and 5-HT(1A) agonist, tandospirone, on hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in Schaffer collateral-CA1, mossy fiber-CA3 and perforant path-dentate gyrus synapses. In the diazepam-injected group, the reduction in LTP was observed in all three types of synapses, although the effective dose differed among these. In the tandospirone-injected group, no reduction in LTP was observed except in Schaffer-CA1 synapses. In addition, population spike amplitude was potentiated by tandospirone in mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, there was a discrepancy in the effects on hippocampal LTP between diazepam and tandospirone, possibly reflecting the reported clinical properties of these drugs, in that 5-HT(1A) partial agonists do not affect learning and memory, whereas diazepam impairs memory function.", 
    "122": "The characteristics of the development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of chronic treatment by dipotassium clorazepate and diazepam using amygdaloid-kindled rats were investigated. Dipotassium clorazepate (5 mg/kg) or diazepam (5 mg/kg) were intraperitoneally administered for 10 consecutive days. Tolerance to the anticonvulsant effect of dipotassium clorazepate developed in seizure stage on day 6, after-discharge duration on day 7 and seizure latency on day 4. In contrast, tolerance to the effects of diazepam developed more rapidly in seizure stage on day 4, after-discharge duration on day 4 and seizure latency on day 3. Thus tolerance to the anticonvulsive effect of dipotassium clorazepate developed relatively slower than that to diazepam. All rats had stage 5 convulsions 24 hr after cessation of the administration of dipotassium clorazepate and diazepam. Concomitant determinations of plasma concentrations of the main metabolite of dipotassium clorazepate and diazepam, desmethyldiazepam, showed no statistical difference during treatment, suggesting that the developed tolerance was not metabolic but functional.", 
    "123": "Sixteen synthetic chemical drugs, often found in adulterated Chinese medicines, were studied by capillary electrophoresis/UV absorbance (CE/UV) and capillary electrophoresis/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE/ESI-MS). Only nine peaks were detected with CZE/UV, but on-line CZE/MS provided clear identification for most compounds. For a real sample of a Chinese medicinal preparation, a few adulterants were identified by their migration times and protonated molecular ions. For coeluting compounds, more reliable identification was achieved by MS/MS in selected reaction monitoring mode. Micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) provided better separation than capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), and, under optimal conditions, fourteen peaks were detected using UV detection. In ESI, the interference of SDS was less severe in positive ion mode than in negative ion mode. Up to 20 mM SDS could be used in direct coupling of MEKC with ESI-MS if the mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode. Because of better resolution in MEKC, adulterants can be identified without the use of MS/MS.", 
    "124": "An aqueous alcohol extract of Eschscholzia californica (Ec) has been evaluated for benzodiazepine, neuroleptic, antidepressant, antihistaminic and analgesic properties, in order to complete the study of the sedative and anxiolytic effects previously demonstrated. The plant extract did not protect mice against the convulsant effects of pentylenetetrazol, and did not cause muscle relaxant effects but appeared to possess an affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor: thus, flumazenil, an antagonist of these receptors, suppressed the sedative and anxiolytic effects of the extract. The Ec extract induced peripheral analgesic effects in mice but did not possess antidepressant, neuroleptic or antihistaminic effects.", 
    "125": "Although phenobarbital, oxazepam and Wyeth 14,643 are carcinogens that do not form DNA adducts, they induce mutations in the Big Blue transgenic mouse model. The mutations produced by these compounds were predominantly G-->T and G-->C transversions that we suspect arose from oxidative damage to DNA. To test this, we employed the single cell electrophoresis (Comet) assay that detects alkali-labile lesions in cells sustaining DNA damage. Human myeloid leukemia K562 cells were treated with non-cytotoxic doses of the above compounds for 3 h, then placed on slides containing low melting point agarose. Cells were lysed, exposed to alkaline buffer, electrophoresed and analyzed by microscopy for the existence of DNA damage. Extensive DNA damage, most likely due to the existence of single- and double-strand breaks and apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites, was observed in cells exposed to oxazepam (1 mM) and Wyeth 14,643 (0.5 mM). On the other hand, damage of this sort was not observed in cells exposed to phenobarbital (1 mM). However, the addition of S9 liver extracts to cells exposed in the presence of phenobarbital resulted in significant amounts of DNA damage. We conclude from these studies that two of the three compounds evaluated in this study mediate their mutagenic effects through oxidative stress, but that the mechanism of DNA damage caused by phenobarbital differs from that elicited by oxazepam and Wyeth 14,643.", 
    "126": "There are several reports demonstrating that aneugens may preferentially affect segregation of particular chromosomes in somatic cells. Much less is known on specific susceptibility of individual chromosomes to non-disjunction in mammalian meiosis in response to chemical exposures. To explore possible chromosome-specific behaviour and susceptibility to errors in chromosome segregation in mammalian oogenesis we employed spindle immunofluoresecence in combination with FISH with chromosome-specific probes to analyse congression of chromosomes X, 8 and 16 in diazepam (DZ)-treated, meiotically delayed meiosis I oocytes of the mouse. Concomitantly, we assessed the susceptibility of homologues to precociously segregate prior to anaphase I during DZ-induced meiotic arrest. About 50% of all oocytes exposed to 25 microg/ml DZ became meiotically delayed. Chromosomes failed to congress at the spindle equator in one-third of these meiosis I oocytes. The X chromosome was significantly more often located away from the spindle equator as compared with the expected random behaviour. Concomitantly, DZ exposure induced untimely segregation of homologous chromosomes of the gonosome and the autosomes in meiosis I. This occurred with similar frequencies. The observations confirm that DZ perturbs cell cycle progression, interferes with chromosome alignment, causes predivision and thus may predispose mammalian oocytes to errors in chromosome segregation. For the first time, chromosome-specific behaviour is reported in female meiosis in response to exposure to an aneugenic chemical.", 
    "127": "The effect of concurrent nonopiate drug use on outcome of treatment for opiate dependence.", 
    "128": "Forty-seven opiate-dependent patients received a 6-month course of outpatient treatment with naltrexone and cognitive-behavioral therapy (behavioral naltrexone therapy, BNT) at a university-based research clinic. Opiate-negative urines and naltrexone ingestion were rewarded with monetary vouchers. Abstinence from other drugs was encouraged verbally, but no contingencies were placed on nonopiate drug use. The proportions of all urines (collected twice weekly) positive for cocaine, cannabis, and benzodiazepines over the course of treatment were evaluated as predictors of outcome of opiate dependence treatment, as measured by proportion of opiate-positive urines, days retained in treatment, and proportion of naltrexone doses taken, using Pearson product moment correlations and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).", 
    "129": "The majority of patients (78%) used a nonopiate drug at least once during the trial. There were no significant correlations between concurrent drug use measures and opiate dependence treatment outcomes, indicating no simple linear relationship between these measures. However, when concurrent drug use was trichotomized into abstinent, intermittent, and heavy use groups, groups with intermittent use had superior outcome compared to both abstinent and heavy use groups in several contrasts.", 
    "130": "Intermittent use of nonopiate drugs is common during outpatient treatment for opiate dependence and may be a favorable prognostic indicator. This may support a \"harm reduction\" approach as opposed to a strict abstinence-oriented approach. Further research is needed to identify the optimal therapeutic stance toward other drug use during treatment for opiate dependence.", 
    "131": "Chronic administration of melatonin for 5 days to antigen-primed mice increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 but decreased the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha. These results further confirm that melatonin activates Th2-like immune response. Whether melatonin-mediated Th2 response is dependent on opioid or central and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors was also examined. Hence, melatonin was administered to antigen-sensitised mice with either naltrexone (a mu opioid receptor antagonist) or flumazenil (a central benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) or PK11195 (a peripheral benzoidiazepine receptor antagonist). No significant difference in melatonin-induced Th2 cell response was observed by naltrexone, flumazenil or PK11195 treatment. These findings suggest that the Th2 cell response induced by melatonin in antigen sensitised mice neither dependent on endogenous opioid system nor is modulated through the central or peripheral benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "132": "Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and midazolam, are frequently administered to surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients for postoperative sedation. To date, the pharmacology of lorazepam in critically ill patients has not been described. The aim of the current study was to characterize and compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of lorazepam and midazolam administered as continuous intravenous infusions for postoperative sedation of surgical ICU patients.", 
    "133": "With Institutional Review Board approval, 24 consenting adult surgical patients were given either lorazepam or midazolam in a double-blind fashion (together with either intravenous fentanyl or epidural morphine for analgesia) through target-controlled intravenous infusions titrated to maintain a moderate level of sedation for 12-72 h postoperatively. Moderate sedation was defined as a Ramsay Sedation Scale score of 3 or 4. Sedation scores were measured, together with benzodiazepine plasma concentrations. Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were estimated using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling.", 
    "134": "A two-compartment model best described the pharmacokinetics of both lorazepam and midazolam. The pharmacodynamic model predicted depth of sedation for both midazolam and lorazepam with 76% accuracy. The estimated sedative potency of lorazepam was twice that of midazolam. The predicted C50,ss (plasma benzodiazepine concentrations where P(Sedation > or = ss) = 50%) values for midazolam (sedation score [SS] > or = n, where n = a Ramsay Sedation Score of 2, 3, ... 6) were 68, 101, 208, 304, and 375 ng/ml. The corresponding predicted C50,ss values for lorazepam were 34, 51, 104, 152, and 188 ng/ml, respectively. Age, fentanyl administration, and the resolving effects of surgery and anesthesia were significant covariates of benzodiazepine sedation. The relative amnestic potency of lorazepam to midazolam was 4 (observed). The predicted emergence times from sedation after a 72-h benzodiazepine infusion for light (SS = 3) and deep (SS = 5) sedation in a typical patient were 3.6 and 14.9 h for midazolam infusions and 11.9 and 31.1 h for lorazepam infusions, respectively.", 
    "135": "The pharmacology of intravenous infusions of lorazepam differs significantly from that of midazolam in critically ill patients. This results in significant delays in emergence from sedation with lorazepam as compared with midazolam when administered for ICU sedation.", 
    "136": "In monkeys discriminating midazolam (0.56 mg/kg s.c.) from saline, substitution for midazolam was elicited by various positive gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) modulators, including the benzodiazepines (BZs) triazolam, midazolam, and diazepam; the BZ(1)-selective ligands zaleplon and zolpidem; the barbiturates amobarbital and pentobarbital; and the neuroactive steroid pregnanolone. In another group of diazepam (5.6 mg/kg/day p.o.)-treated monkeys discriminating flumazenil (0.32 mg/kg s.c.) from vehicle, these positive GABA(A) modulators shifted the flumazenil dose-effect function to the right, i.e., attenuated diazepam withdrawal. The potency of positive GABA(A) modulators to substitute for midazolam in untreated monkeys did not predict their potency to attenuate the flumazenil stimulus in diazepam-treated monkeys. For instance, larger doses of BZs and BZ(1)-selective ligands were required to attenuate the flumazenil stimulus than to substitute for midazolam. The opposite relationship was revealed for non-BZ ligands, i.e., smaller doses of barbiturates and a neuroactive steroid were required to attenuate the flumazenil stimulus than to substitute for midazolam. The greater potency of non-BZ site ligands to attenuate diazepam withdrawal might be due to actions at a subtype of GABA(A) receptor not modulated by BZ site ligands, to the development of BZ tolerance without cross-tolerance to non-BZ site ligands, or to noncompetitive interactions at the GABA(A) receptor complex. Thus, interactions among GABA(A) modulators in BZ-dependent subjects are not predicted by their acute actions in nondependent subjects. It is not clear whether attenuation of BZ withdrawal is determined by subunit specificity or site of action on the GABA(A) receptor complex.", 
    "137": "To determine the effect of flunarizine therapy on patients with alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC), we sent a questionnaire by mail to council members of the Japanese Society of Child Neurology. We collected 28 AHC patients, and studied their clinical courses and the effects of drug therapy. All of the patients had received flunarizine. In 18 of the 28 patients, flunarizine reduced the severity, duration, or frequency of the hemiplegic attacks. No other drug was more effective than flunarizine. Some flunarizine non-effective patients were severely deteriorated, for example, they had dementia or were ventilator-assisted. Flunarizine had not only a short-term effect, i.e. it reduced the hemiplegic attacks, but also a long-term effect on the motor and intellectual development in some patients with AHC. Flunarizine is still an essential drug for treating AHC.", 
    "138": "From June 1998 to August 1999, 39 California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) were immobilized at a rehabilitation center in northern California (USA) using medetomidine plus zolazepam and tiletamine (MZT), alone and in combination with isoflurane, with atipamezole reversal. Animals were given 70 microg/kg medetomidine with 1 mg/kg of a 1:1 solution of tiletamine and zolazepam intramuscularly. Mean (+/-SD) time to maximal effect was 5+/-3 min. At the end of the procedure, animals were given 200 microg/kg atipamezole intramuscularly. Immobilization and recovery times were, respectively, 28+/-18 and 9+/-7 min for 15 animals maintained with MZT alone and 56+/-47 and 9+/-6 min for 18 animals intubated and maintained with isoflurane. One mortality occurred during anesthesia. Other disadvantages of the MZT combination included some prolonged ataxia, weakness and disorientation during recovery. However, the use of MZT resulted in faster induction and a more reliable plane of anesthesia that was reversible with atipamezole and safer than other previously used intramuscular agents. Physiological parameters including heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, pulse oximeter saturation, and end-tidal carbon dioxide were monitored.", 
    "139": "In this study on 99 outpatients who were being treated for alcohol and/or drug dependence and also using benzodiazepines (BZDs), prevalence rates of DSM-III-R and ICD-10 substance dependence diagnoses were ascertained and scalability, reliability and validity of the scales of the Benzodiaepine Dependence Self-Report Questionnaire (Bendep-SRQ) were assessed. The latter properties were investigated by Rasch analyses, discriminability coefficients, test-retest coefficients and factor analyses. BZD dependence was found to be a prevalent additional diagnosis. The psychometric findings appear to support the use of the Bendep-SRQ at outpatient addiction centers, which could contribute to a more differentiated treatment for poly-substance dependence."
