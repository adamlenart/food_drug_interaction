The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of PLB with intravenous midazolam and to evaluate patient acceptance of PLB with and without sedation. Two hundred seventeen consecutive patients underwent 301 percutaneous liver biopsies. One hundred fifty-one of the biopsies were done after the patients were sedated with intravenous midazolam immediately before the biopsy. The last 61 patients were questioned after the biopsy to evaluate the discomfort of the procedure, their memory of the procedure, and their willingness to undergo another PLB. The major complication rate was similar in the midazolam-treated (0.7%) and untreated (0.7%) groups. The midazolam-treated patients had a numerically lower mean pain score (1.5 +/- 0.4 vs 4.0 +/- 0.7) (mean +/- SEM) (P = 0.07) and significantly lower mean memory score (4.8 +/- 0.7 vs 9.9 +/- 0.1) (P < 0.01) than the untreated patients. The treated and untreated groups had similar mean willingness for repeat PLB scores (9.3 +/- 0.3 vs 9.1 +/- 0.6). We conclude that: (1) there is no increased risk of PLB with midazolam and (2) patients have less memory of the procedure with midazolam.",

Regeneration was stimulated by giving the rats a regular chow diet. The effects of bombesin (10 micrograms/kg three times a day for 7 days) or FOY-305 (200 mg/kg daily for 8 days) on the process of regeneration were examined.", 
    "4": "At the end of the degeneration phase, there was near-total destruction of pancreatic acinar cells. Both bombesin and FOY-305 stimulated pancreatic regeneration. Growth measurements (weight and total content of DNA and protein) were significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the bombesin- and FOY-305-treated rats compared with controls. Histologic examination revealed widespread repopulation of the pancreas with acinar cells in the bombesin- and FOY-305-treated groups. The stimulating effects of both bombesin and FOY-305 on pancreatic regeneration were blocked completely by the CCK-receptor antagonist L-364,718. Growth measurements were not significantly increased in the groups of control rats or rats given L-364,718 alone.", 
    "5": "These results show that bombesin and FOY-305 significantly stimulated pancreatic regeneration. Because the stimulating effects of bombesin and FOY-305 on regeneration were blocked by the specific CCK-receptor antagonist L-364,718, it was concluded that this effect was mediated by endogenous CCK.",

We describe eight patients with horizontal EN and hypothesize that the frequency of ictal discharge, anatomic localization of ictal activity, and level of consciousness determine its occurrence and mechanism. We believe that EN is due to epileptic activation of a cortical saccade region; in each case, quick phases were generated away from the side of the focus, and both quick and slow phases were totally confined to the field contraversive to the seizure focus.", 
    "8": "Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, clearly reverses midazolam-induced sedation; reversal of ventilatory depression has not been as well demonstrated. Thirty-two subjects completed this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigating the dose-response relationship and duration of flumazenil's effects on ventilatory depression and hypnosis induced by a continuous midazolam infusion. A computer-controlled infusion of midazolam was used to titrate the predicted midazolam plasma concentration to a level at which subjects were unresponsive to verbal commands and then to maintain that concentration. Measurements of ventilation and hypnosis were repeated at predetermined intervals: before midazolam administration, before test drug (flumazenil [1, 3, or 10 mg] or placebo), and 5, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min after test drug administration. Ventilation and tidal volume were measured during an isocapnic hyperoxia clamp at a PETCO2 of 46 mm Hg (VE46 and VT46, respectively). A pseudo-rebreathing technique was used to measure the hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR) slope and ventilation intercept at a PETCO2 of 58 mm Hg (VE58). Midazolam reduced VE46, VT46, and VE58, as well as hypnosis scores, in all test drug groups. The reduction in HCVR slope, however, was significant only when all 32 subjects were considered in aggregate. All three doses of flumazenil reversed hypnosis and also reversed the reduction in VE46 and VT46 within 5 min. The reduction in VE58, however, was reversed less consistently. Flumazenil's effect on VE46 and VT46 lasted at least 30 min after 1 mg and at least 60 min after 3 mg, paralleling the effect of these doses on hypnosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "Recent reports have shown an increase in specific binding (in vitro) of [3H]PK 11195 to peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors in both experimental animals and humans, reflecting a glial/macrophagic reaction within and around focal ischemic insults. We have evaluated by positron emission tomography the time course of changes in brain uptake in vivo of 11C-labeled PK 11195 and flumazenil (an antagonist of central benzodiazepine receptors) as indirect and direct markers of neuronal loss, respectively, after focal cerebral ischemia.", 
    "10": "Ten anesthetized baboons were submitted to sequential positron emission tomography studies between day 1 and day 91 after unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion. The studies consisted of successive assessments, in the same positron emission tomography session, of [11C]PK 11195, [11C]flumazenil, cerebral blood flow, and oxygen consumption; late computed tomographic scans were obtained to map the approximate contours of infarction and to define a concentric peri-infarct area.", 
    "11": "We found a significant time-dependent increase in [11C]PK 11195 uptake in the peri-infarcted area, maximum at 20 to 40 days after occlusion. In contrast, there was a time- and perfusion-independent significant decrease in [11C]flumazenil uptake in the infarcted area, stable from day 2 onward, and already present in one baboon at day 1. Challenge studies with saturating doses of cold ligands confirmed that these changes represented alterations in specific binding. [11C]Flumazenil uptake was not affected in hypometabolic (but apparently noninfarcted, ie, deafferented) cortical areas.", 
    "12": "The delayed and apparently transient increases in [11C]PK 11195 specific uptake in vivo presumably represent glial/macrophage reaction; the marked depression in [11C]flumazenil specific binding, which appears selective for synaptic damage, is both precocious and sustained and thus may be better suited for the early assessment of ischemic damage in humans.", 
    "13": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR)-regulated gene expression is stimulated independently by the cellular trans-activator NF-kappa B and the viral protein Tat. Noncytotoxic concentrations of the drug pentoxifylline (PTX) inhibited interaction of NF-kappa B with its motif and the stimulation of HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression in Jurkat cells. Tat protein (from a cotransfected Tat-expression vector) also induced activation of HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression. This activation was unaffected by PTX when NF-kappa B sites in the HIV-1 LTR were mutated, suggesting that this drug does not directly influence Tat function, which, however, was inhibited by the Tat-inhibitor Ro 24-7429. Transient reporter gene expression regulated by HIV-1 LTR with wild-type NF-kappa B motifs in the presence of Tat protein was 10- to 60-fold higher than in the presence of either of the trans-activators alone, demonstrating superactivation of HIV-1 LTR by the concerted action of both the trans-activators. Treatment of cells with either PTX or Ro 24-7429 inhibited this superactivation of the HIV-1 LTR. The inhibitory effect of these two drugs in combination, at concentrations that alone did not significantly influence viral promoter activity, was far more than additive. A cooperative action of PTX (NF-kappa B inhibitor) and Ro 24-7429 (Tat inhibitor) on HIV-1 LTR-regulated gene expression is suggested. Concentrations of the drugs that induced maximum inhibition of HIV-1 LTR through their cooperative action are far below cytotoxic levels. Thus, the combination of these two inhibitors could be very effective for anti-HIV therapy.", 
    "14": "Human diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) was originally isolated from the brain and subsequently found to be present in several peripheral tissues. The various physiologic effects recently attributed to DBI include acting as an endogenous ligand for the central and peripheral (mitochondrial) benzodiazepine receptors. The present work provides, for the first time, evidence of DBI immunoreactivity in skin. DBI immunoreactivity was found in the epidermis, in the eccrine sweat and in sebaceous glands. Ultrastructurally, DBI was distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Although the physiologic role of DBI in skin is unknown, our results indicate that DBI may serve as an endogenous ligand for mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors. Its activity could be related to the regulation of lipid and cholesterol synthesis in keratinocytes and sebaceous glands and to the secretion of sweat in sweat glands.",

Ten minutes after the beginning of study drug infusion, patients were evaluated using the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGIS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GSC), and Neurobehavioral Assessment Scale (NAS). The mean +/- SD CGIS score at ten minutes for BDZ-positive patients was 1.41 +/- 0.72 for patients who received flumazenil and 3.41 +/- 0.91 for the placebo group (P < .01). There was no difference in the mean CGIS score between the flumazenil (3.25 +/- 1.15) and placebo (3.75 +/- 0.69) groups in BDZ-negative patients. The GCS and NAS were also significantly better in patients who were BDZ-positive and received flumazenil. The mean +/- SD dose of flumazenil administered during the double-blind phase was 71.3 +/- 34.2 mL (7.13 mg) compared with 95.06 +/- 16.03 mL of placebo. Of the 39 patients who had BDZ-positive drug screens and received flumazenil, 29 (74%) responded to 3 mg or less. Six additional patients responded to 4 or 5 mg, and one patient responded to 8 mg. The most common adverse effects in patients who received flumazenil were injection site pain (10.3%), agitation (8%), vomiting (3.4%), dizziness (3.4%), headache (3.4%), tachycardia (3.4%), and crying (3.4%). Three patients developed seizures. Two were associated with significant tricyclic antidepressant overdoses and one with propoxyphene ingestion. Two patients had positive drug screens for BDZ.",

After controlled treatment with either imipramine or doxepin, patients received naturalistic treatment with antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and supportive psychotherapy. They were evaluated for anxiety, depression, and social disability at least every 3 months during the follow-up period. The data showed fluctuation of symptoms in both groups and a less favorable outcome for the patients with comorbid conditions. However, the overall outcome was better than that reported in other studies and indicates that panic disorder is quite responsive to appropriate treatment.", 
    "23": "Benzodiazepine (BZD) hypnotics have been known to decrease, to some degree, human slow wave sleep (SWS) although they elevate the arousal threshold during sleep. Zopiclone (ZPC), a cyclopyrrolone hypnotic, has attracted the interest of sleep researchers because an increase in human SWS has been reported. Since the increase has not been fully confirmed by all of the studies, the authors investigated the effects of ZPC 10 mg on SWS and the K-complexes for 7 healthy young adults because there is evidence indicating that delta waves consisting of SWS and the spontaneous K-complexes are identical. SWS and st. 4 sleep did not decrease on any of the ZPC nights but st. 3 sleep showed a tendency to reduce on the 1st ZPC night. The frequency of the K-complexes decreased significantly on the 2nd ZPC night and tended to reduce on the 1st ZPC night. Moreover, a significant positive correlation was noted between the decrease rates of SWS and the K-complexes on both the ZPC nights. The authors, therefore, could not obtain any findings suggesting an increase in SWS with ZPC.", 
    "24": "1. The effect of benzodiazepine pretreatment on the stress-induced decrease in MAO activity in rat tissues using footshock as stress model was investigated. 2. Animals were injected with vehicle, Lorazepam (1.25 mg/kg), or Clonazepam (0.5 mg/kg) 2 hr before or with PK 11195 (0.45 mg/kg) 2.5 hr before being subjected to one session of 10 inescapable footshocks or to a sham session. At the end of the session animals were sacrificed and MAO A and B activities in hearts and brains were determined. 3. Pretreatment of the animals with both Lorazepam and Clonazepam abolished the decrease induced by footshock in MAO A activity in brain. Pretreatment with Lorazepam but not with Clonazepam abolished the stress-induced decrease in MAO A in the heart. Pretreatment with PK 11195 before Lorazepam reversed its effects in the heart but not in the brain. Neither footshock nor any of the drugs used had any effect on heart and brain MAO B. 4. Our results suggest that in the heart but not in the brain, peripheral benzodiazepine receptors play a role in the regulation of MAO A activity under stress conditions.", 
    "25": "The ability of melatonin (MLT) to potentiate the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid and the benzodiazepines has been demonstrated repeatedly in animal models, and recent experimental data favored the hypothesis that MLT, given together with threshold doses of benzodiazepines, could significantly improve the quality of sleep. This preliminary study was designed to compare the effects of MLT (100 mg) with those of a benzodiazepine hypnotic [triazolam (TRI) 0.125 mg] and to explore the effects of a combination of MLT and TRI at a low dose in healthy volunteers. No significant changes in the classical polysomnographic variables were observed following MLT, TRI and MLT + TRI, whereas MLT and especially MLT + TRI resulted in significant modulation of some microstructural parameters. These changes were paralleled by ameliorated subjective sleep quality. A combination of MLT and low benzodiazepine doses could avoid the residual, dose-related benzodiazepine effects.", 
    "26": "We report the effects of withdrawal of clonazepam (CZP) at a rate of 1 mg/week in 23 patients with chronic active epilepsy. Seventeen (74%) discontinued CZP successfully. No clinical features were identified that were associated with an increased risk of failure of CZP withdrawal. In the six patients in whom seizures increased, reintroduction of CZP rapidly resulted in control. No significant change in cognitive function, mood or behaviour was noted in the patients who discontinued CZP.", 
    "27": "Treatment of pregnant Long Evans rats with benzodiazepines was found to cause alterations in cellular immune responses in their offspring. We now report on changes in interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-2 secretion which were analyzed in rats from birth until 12 weeks. Time-pregnant rats were treated with diazepam (1.25 mg/kg/day subcutaneously) from gestational day 14 to 20. Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated release of macrophage-derived IL-1 by spleen cells, determined on D10.G4.1 cells, remained in the control range during the preweaning period (postnatal day 6-28), then decreased in prenatally diazepam-exposed offspring, significantly in males during the postweaning period (postnatal day 34-61) and in both sexes in adults (postnatal day 62-83). Concanavalin A-stimulated release of T lymphocyte-derived IL-2 from spleen cells, determined on CTLL-2 cells, was reduced in male and female offspring during preweaning (postnatal day 3-28) and postweaning (postnatal day 33-55) periods and normalized in adulthood (postnatal day 60-84). The percentage of IL-2 receptor expressing (CD25+) cells was unaffected. From these and our earlier data it is evident that prenatal exposure to low doses of benzodiazepines can result in long-lasting alterations of the cytokine network, as indicated by reduced release of TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, IL-2 and interferon-gamma. The concomitant reduction of peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors on macrophages is discussed as a possible link between prenatal treatment and disturbed function.", 
    "28": "Previous studies in this laboratory have demonstrated that prior intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of the muscarinic antagonist, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) in morphine dependent rats significantly attenuates the development of cardiovascular and certain behavioral responses precipitated by the opiate antagonist, naloxone. The purpose of this study was to determine whether both supraspinal and spinal cholinergic neurons are involved in the expression of withdrawal symptoms. Employing localized (i.c.v. or intrathecal, i.t.) infusions of muscarinic antagonists, it was determined that a significant antiwithdrawal action could be produced through both an inhibition of supraspinal and spinal cholinergic neurons. Pharmacological difference emerged regarding the antiwithdrawal potential of 4-DAMP and the partially M1 selective antagonist, pirenzepine. While our previous studies had revealed that pirenzepine had essentially no antiwithdrawal activity when administered by the i.c.v. route, in the present study, pirenzepine evoked a marked antiwithdrawal action by the i.t. route, significantly inhibiting both cardiovascular and behavioral signs of withdrawal. In contrast, 4-DAMP which was effective by the i.c.v. route (especially for the cardiovascular symptoms), elicited no antiwithdrawal action by the i.t. route. As a muscarinic antagonist (ability to block the pressor response to central injection of carbachol) 4-DAMP was equally active by i.c.v. or i.t. injection. However, pirenzepine was clearly more effective in this regard by the i.t. route. These results are consistent with ability of muscarinic antagonists to offer significant anti-morphine withdrawal activity at both supraspinal and spinal locations. They also suggest that different muscarinic systems, possibly different receptor subtypes, mediate the expression of morphine withdrawal symptoms within the two regions of the CNS.", 
    "29": "Metabolism of diazepam (DZP) was studied in vitro to clarify the involvement of different forms of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) in rats, and humans of Japanese and Caucasian origin. Microsomal 3-hydroxylation was the major pathway of DZP metabolism in rats and was inhibited by anti-CYP3A antibodies. Purified CYP3As and CYP2C11 catalysed 3-hydroxylation and N-demethylation, respectively, in the reconstituted systems. The rates of both reactions in human liver microsomes depended on the substrate concentration: the rate of 3-hydroxylation was 3-4 times higher than N-demethylation at 0.2 mM; the two activities were essentially the same at a lower substrate concentration (0.02 mM). Inhibitions of the N-demethylation by anti-CYP2C antibody and S-mephenytoin also depended on the substrate concentration and was detectable only at a low substrate concentration. Kinetic studies revealed the presence of two distinct catalytic activities for the N-demethylation; low Km and low Vmax, and high Km and high Vmax. The former activity seems to be mediated by a CYP2C P450 form. On the other hand, DZP 3-hydroxylation was rather selectively catalysed by a CYP3A P450 at the low and high substrate concentrations. These results were consistent with the observation in vivo that DZP N-demethylation and S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation are closely correlated in humans. These results also suggest that the apparent discrepancy on the role of CYP forms in DZP metabolism in vitro and in vivo may reside in the difference in substrate concentration.", 
    "30": "This study investigates the distribution of some drugs in hair samples taken from different parts of the body (head, pubis and axillae). Samples drawn from 15 subjects who died from drug overdose were analysed. The concentrations of the drugs detected in the biological fluids did not appear to be correlated with those present in hair. The highest drug levels were observed in pubic hair. The concentration differences observed in the various types of hair can hypothetically be ascribed to a likely incorporation of the drugs from the outside.", 
    "31": "A young adult male, ASA status I, presented for left shoulder arthroscopy. His medications included indocin for shoulder pain and chloroquine, an antimalarial. He was anesthetized using propofol, midazolam, fentanyl, and a relaxant. His initial oximetry reading of 94% saturation was erroneously attributed to shivering and to the fact that the oximeter clip was distal to the blood pressure cuff on the right upper extremity, necessitated by proximity of surgery. The initial saturation level of 94% was persistent throughout the case. The methemoglobin level drawn immediately postoperatively was 9%. The patient was treated with methylene blue which resulted in an improvement in oxygen saturation to 98%. His remaining postoperative course was uneventful, and he was released one day later.", 
    "32": "Forty ASA I and II patients undergoing elective termination of pregnancy were studied. Patients were randomly selected to receive fentanyl or alfentanil. Patients received 1 to 2 mg midazolam, 2.0 to 2.5 mg/kg propofol, and 10 to 20 micrograms/kg alfentanil or 1 to 2 micrograms/kg fentanyl for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. In addition all patients were administered 70% N2O and 30% O2. The time from admission to the post anesthesia recovery unit until discharged home was defined as the discharge time. These times were compared using the student's t test to determine if there was a significant difference (P < .05) between the mean discharge time of the two groups. In addition, each patient's total postanesthesia recovery scores were evaluated on admission, at 15 minutes, and at discharge from the post anesthesia recovery unit. These data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test to determine if there was a significant difference in the mean rate of recovery in each area observed. The data revealed no statistically significant difference between the mean discharge times of the two groups or in the total post anesthesia recovery unit recovery scores.", 
    "33": "A three-dimensional (3D) model of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) has been built using molecular dynamics simulations. The transmembrane domain of the receptor has been modeled as five alpha-helices, which are not long enough to cross the entire bilayer membrane but correspond approximately to only one phospholipid layer. The receptor model has also been tested as a cholesterol carrier, and molecular dynamics simulations have shown that it could indeed accommodate a cholesterol molecule within the five helices. All three known PBR sequences have been modeled, and no significant difference has been found between them.", 
    "34": "Based on previous findings in humans and rhesus monkeys suggesting that diazepam has asymmetrical effects on frontal lobe activity and other literature supporting a role for the benzodiazepine system in the mediation of individual differences in anxiety and fearfulness, the relation between asymmetrical changes in scalp-recorded regional brain activity in response to diazepam and the temperamental dimension of behavioral inhibition indexed by freezing time in 9 rhesus monkeys was examined. Animals showed greater relative left-sided frontal activation in response to diazepam compared with the preceding baseline. The magnitude of this shift was strongly correlated with an aggregate measure of freezing time (r = .82). The implications of these findings for understanding the role of regional differences in the benzodiazepine system in mediating individual differences in fearfulness are discussed.", 
    "35": "The role of the amygdala in mediating the anxiolytic effects of diazepam was examined in two models of rat anxiety. As in our previous experiments, amygdaloid lesions by themselves did not increase rats' exploration of the open arms of the elevated plus-maze or decrease rats' burying of an electrified probe in the shock-probe burying test. However, amygdaloid lesions did increase rats' shock-probe contacts. Diazepam (2 mg/kg) increased open-arm activity and decreased burying behavior to an equal extent in sham-lesioned and amygdala-lesioned rats and had no significant effect on the facilitation of probe contacts induced by amygdaloid lesions. These results suggest that many of the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines are not mediated by the amygdala.",

Several compounds possess comparable and sometimes higher affinity for central benzodiazepine receptors than that of diazepam.

    "37": "In light of recently described and reviewed disorders of movement and behaviour during sleep, the long standing diagnosis of conversion disorder in a forty-nine year old Vietnam veteran was reappraised. Polysomnographic studies showed that the nocturnal component of his \"pseudoseizures\" was due to physical disorder, a severe mixed parasomnia comprising the recently described REM behaviour disorder and a non-REM parasomnia. His sleep architecture was also deranged, featuring reduced REM latency and increased REM density. An association between these abnormalities and psychological trauma is recognised in the literature. Treatment with clonazepam has abolished the nocturnal behavioural disturbance. His daytime pseudoseizures occur less frequently and his general well being is improved. The case is a reminder that physical disorder may underlie and act as prototype to the psychologically-driven symptom. Before attributing behavioural disturbance at night to psychological causes alone, polysomnographic studies should be done to exclude a treatable parasomnia.",

    "43": "Midazolam, a water-soluble benzodiazepine tranquilizer, has been considered by some veterinary anaesthesiologists to be suitable as a combination anaesthetic agent when administered concurrently with ketamine because of its water solubility and miscibility with ketamine. However, the pharmacokinetics of midazolam have not been extensively described in the dog. Twelve clinically healthy mixed breed dogs (22.2-33.4 kg) were divided into two groups at random and were administered ketamine (10 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) either as an intravenous bolus over 30 s (group 1) or as an i.v. infusion in 0.9% NaCl (2 ml/kg) over 15 min. Blood samples were obtained immediately before the drugs were injected and periodically for 6 h afterwards. Serum concentrations were determined using gas chromatography with electron-capture detection. Serum concentrations were best described using a two-compartment open model and indicated a t1/2-alpha of 1.8 min and t1/2-beta of 27.8 min after i.v. bolus, and t1/2-alpha of 1.35 min and t1/2-beta of 31.6 min after i.v. infusion. The calculated pharmacokinetic coefficient B was significantly smaller after i.v. infusion (429 +/- 244 ng/ml) than after i.v. bolus (888 +/- 130 ng/ml, P = 0.004). Furthermore, AUC was significantly smaller after i.v. infusion (29,800 +/- 6120 ng/h/ml) than after i.v. bolus (42,500 +/- 8460 ng/h/ml, P < 0.05), resulting in a larger ClB after i.v. infusion (17.4 +/- 4.00 ml/min/kg than after i.v. bolus (12.1 +/- 2.24 ml/min/kg, P < 0.05).

No procedures in the alfentanil group had to be discontinued because of patient discomfort. Side effects with alfentanil were minimal, and oxygen saturation remained above 90% for all patients. Combination midazolam-alfentanil anesthesia is safe and allows the urologist to treat renal and ureteral calculi effectively and efficiently without using general or regional anesthesia.", 
    "45": "The authors report six very low birth weight newborn infants who had RDS, IVH and cerebellar porencephalus and later suffered from West syndrome. Four of them have been followed up to the present time and have had MRI scans performed. Their present clinico-neurological features and MRI findings are described. The authors also raise the possibility of prevention of mental deterioration if anticipatory treatment is started early. Very low birth weight newborn infants with cerebellar porencephalus should be observed more carefully with clinical and EEG examinations to detect infantile spasms earlier and to protect them from further mental deterioration.", 
    "46": "Radioligand method was used to show 14C-GABA, 3H-flunitrazepam binding sites in human, rat, rabbit myometrium. We have used muscimol, bicucullin, picrotoxin, baclofen, thiosemicarbazide for identification of GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complexes and in pharmacologic analysis of uterine contractility. Receptor affinity depended on pregnancy term (early or late). A conclusion is drawn that GABAA, GABAB, and benzodiazepine receptors of the peripheral nervous system mediate the inhibitory effect of GABA-positive substances on mammalian uterine contractility.", 
    "47": "The pharmacokinetics and drug interactions of the agents of choice for treating epilepsy are examined. For effective treatment of epilepsy, target serum antiepileptic drug (AED) concentrations must be reached quickly and maintained. AEDs for acute treatment are formulated for quick absorption, while maintenance therapy is usually administered orally. AEDs have narrow therapeutic ranges. Individual differences in response necessitate that optimization of each regimen be based on the individual patient's clinical condition. Agents of choice for acute treatment are diazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, valproic acid, and phenytoin. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, phenobarbital, and benzodiazepines are typically used in maintenance therapy. The absorption, distribution, and metabolism or excretion characteristics of AEDs must be taken into account in optimizing the therapeutic regimen. Different AED formulations can have different absorption profiles. Drug interactions can affect all aspects of the pharmacokinetics of AEDs and should be considered when agents are removed from a regimen, as well as when they are added. Various factors can threaten seizure control and cause unexpected toxicity. Such problems can be avoided or controlled if the pharmacist is aware of the pharmacokinetics and potential interactions of the AEDs involved.", 
    "48": "A variety of drugs, known to induce acute attacks in porphyric patients has been found to inhibit the glyoxalase pathway. Glyoxalase I is competitively inhibited by sulphadimidine, oxytetracycline, chloramphenicol, etc. Allylisopropyl acetamide (AIA) seems to inhibit glyoxalase II. This inhibition could play a contributing role in the overproduction of porphyrins in porphyria and thus help explain the mechanism of induction of porphyric attacks. The results indicate, that the Heme pathway and the glyoxalase cycle are closely connected.", 
    "49": "This study has examined the use of flumazenil to improve recovery following sedation with midazolam in elderly patients undergoing invasive radiological procedures. Forty patients received either flumazenil or placebo in a randomized double-blind fashion following midazolam sedation. Nalbuphine 10-15 mg was given for premedication. All but one of the patients in the flumazenil group were fully awake immediately following the reversal agents compared to only one in the placebo group (P = 0.016). This statistically significant difference remained after 20 minutes (P = 0.029). There were no adverse effects on heart rate, blood pressure, forced expiratory volume in one second, vital capacity or oxygen saturation. The majority of patients (78% overall) could not recall their procedure. All patients said that they would be willing to undergo a similar technique in the future.", 
    "50": "Clonazepam and placebo were administered in a double-blind pilot study to 75 outpatients with social phobia. The mean maximum dose of clonazepam was 2.4 mg/day at endpoint (range, 0.5 to 3 mg). Treatment was continued for up to 10 weeks. The results of an intent-to-treat analysis indicated superior effects of clonazepam on most measures. Response rates for clonazepam and placebo were 78.3 and 20.0%. Drug effects were apparent on performance and generalized social anxiety, on fear and phobic avoidance, on interpersonal sensitivity, on fears of negative evaluation, and on disability measures. Significant differences were evident by week 1, 2, or 6, depending upon the rating scale used. Clonazepam was well tolerated in general, although unsteadiness and dizziness were more severe and persistent than was the case for placebo subjects.", 
    "51": "Through the genetic technique of selective breeding, a mouse line [Withdrawal Seizure Prone (WSP)] has been developed that expresses severe handling-induced convulsions (HIC) after cessation of chronic ethanol exposure. These mice also display rebound elevations in HIC after a single ethanol injection. In the current studies, we tested WSP mice in several paradigms. WSP mice were found to be marginally sensitive to the effects of acute doses of dizocilpine to reduce HIC. However, when tested during acute withdrawal from a single ethanol injection, WSP were more sensitive to this compound. Although N-methyl-D-aspartate significantly elevated HIC in naive WSP mice, it was more effective at low doses when given during acute withdrawal. Withdrawing mice were slightly more sensitive than naive mice to kainic acid. Pentylenetetrazole elevated HIC in naive and withdrawing mice; it was marginally more effective in naive mice. Diazepam inhibited HIC in both naive and withdrawing mice, and was slightly more effective during acute withdrawal. This pattern of results suggests that acute alcohol withdrawal is accompanied by altered sensitivity to convulsants and anticonvulsants. These changes include enhanced sensitivity in at least two excitatory amino acid-gated ion channel binding sites.", 
    "52": "In Experiment 1, twelve Sprague-Dawley rats were trained in a two-choice food-reinforced drug discrimination task (10-min sessions) using the state-dependent interoceptive stimulus attributes of ethanol's (ETOH) delayed or rebound effects (EDE) versus \"normal\" basal homeostasis. Rats were injected with either 4 g/kg ETOH or equivalent volumes of saline (SAL) 18 hr before the sessions. Each rat was injected with an additional 1 ml/kg injection of SAL 15 min before the sessions. EDE training sessions were always followed by a \"day off.\" SAL sessions were conducted between 36-96 hr after an EDE training session. Rats demonstrated > 90% discriminative accuracy. Test sessions showed a time-dependent, cyclic, return from the experimental \"hangover\" state to the \"normal\" state, by 48 hr. The acute (immediate) effects of ETOH and chlordiazepoxide (0.75 g/kg or 0.18 mg/kg, respectively; @15 min) did not cross-generalize with the \"hangover\" state. Both these low-dose ETOH and chlordiazepoxide pretreatments blocked the stimulus attributes of \"hangover.\" All subjects responded on the EDE-appropriate lever at 5.6 mg/kg pentylenetetrazole and exhibited an increase in susceptibility to clonic seizures. In Experiment 2 blood alcohol concentration kinetics functions were quantified in three groups (n = 8/group) of age-matched cohorts to Experiment 1 subjects (2, 3, and 4 g/kg ETOH) using a head-space gas chromatographic technique. The training stimulus state associated with 4 g/kg, at 18 hr postinjection intervals, in Experiment 1, did not produce any chromatogram peaks for ETOH or any its active metabolite (acetaldehyde, acetone, nor methanol).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "53": "The objective of this study was to assess whether melatonin injections accelerated reentrainment of locomotor activity and body temperature rhythms of Syrian hamsters after phase-advancing the light-dark (L:D) cycle and to what extent the effect can be modified by the benzodiazepine (BZP) receptor antagonist flumazenil. After a baseline recording of rhythms, a 6-h phase advance of the L:D cycle was made (day D). Groups of hamsters were subjected, on days D-2, D-1, and D, to one of the following treatments: two injections of vehicle 15 min apart; vehicle followed 15 min later by melatonin (1 mg/kg); flumazenil (5 mg/kg) followed 15 min later by vehicle; or flumazenil (5 mg/kg) followed 15 min later by melatonin (1 mg/kg). Injections were given at the expected time of lights off after the phase shift. In vehicle-injected and untreated controls, approximately 1 day per hour of phase advance was needed to resynchronize the rhythms. The administration of melatonin brought about a significant decrease of resynchronization time to 66% of vehicle-injected controls. The effect of melatonin was prevented by first administering flumazenil. Flumazenil, injected alone, did not modify resynchronization after the shift. The results agree with the view that melatonin activity on circadian rhythmicity is sensitive to central-type BZP antagonism.", 
    "54": "The purpose of the study was to develop an animal model for benzodiazepine tolerance and dependence on the basis of oral administration, using lorazepam as the test drug. We have used the continuous measurement of locomotor activity in home cages to obtain a narrow estimation of the time course of withdrawal related hyperactivity as an observer-independent symptom. Acute administration of lorazepam (9.5-37.5 mg/kg body weight/day) resulted in the first week in a dose-dependent muscle relaxation on the accelerod and sedation in the open field. The most striking manifestation of sedation, however, was the decrease of nocturnal locomotor activity in home cages. After 5 weeks of administration tolerance to the sedative effect had developed. In a second study, using a lower dose range (2.5-9.5 mg/kg body weight/day), a decrease of nocturnal locomotor activity was also observed as was the development of tolerance. The latter can be partly explained by dispositional tolerance, i.e., decreased serum concentrations after administration of lorazepam for more than 2 weeks. Withdrawal of lorazepam in the experiment using high doses led to three symptoms, i.e., a decrease in food intake, loss of body weight and an increase in daytime locomotor activity. The decrease in food intake and the loss of body weight were maximal on the first day of withdrawal. The increase in the daytime locomotor activity was present in the high dose experiment only, with a maximum on days 2-3 and a duration of at least 1 week. The increase however, was not dependent on the dose previously administered. The symptoms 'loss of body weight' and 'decrease in food intake' appeared to be more sensitive in benzodiazepine withdrawal: they were dose dependently present over the whole dosage range (2.5-37.5 mg/kg body weight/day). It is concluded that the model represents a sensitive model to measure lorazepam tolerance and dependence in animals. Comparative studies with other benzodiazepines are in progress.", 
    "55": "Rats were treated for 5 weeks with three subconvulsant doses of picrotoxin (PTX) and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) per week to induce a persistent reduction of the GABAA receptor function which results in chemical kindling. Fifteen days after termination of this treatment schedule, the effect of desipramine (DMI) and alprazolam (ALP) on immobility time in the forced swim test (FST) was evaluated. Chronic PTX and PTZ did not alter the immobility time. Acute PTX and PTZ reduced the immobility of rats chronically treated with vehicle but not of those exposed chronically to PTX and PTZ. Chronic PTX did not influence the anti-immobility effect of DMI, but blocked that of ALP. Chronic PTZ markedly potentiated the anti-immobility effect of DMI but blocked that of ALP. Concomitant administration of chlordiazepoxide prevented the effects of chronic PTX and PTZ. These findings suggest that a long-lasting reduction in GABAA receptor function, unlike acute reduction, does not play an important role in the mobility of rats in the FST and in the anti-immobility effect of DMI while it blocks that of ALP.", 
    "56": "Peripheral-type (mitochondrial) benzodiazepine receptors (PTBR) were studied in the brain and peripheral organs (kidney, liver, and testis) of normal male mice (CD-1/Y) and the congenitally hyperammonemic sparse fur (spf/Y) mouse. Radioligand binding assays were performed with [3H]PK 11195, a ligand with high selectivity and affinity for PTBR. Densities (maximal number of binding sites) of [3H]PK 11195 binding sites were greatest in kidney, followed by liver, testis, and brain. Densities of [3H]PK 11195 binding sites were significantly increased in all tissues of spf mice compared with control animals. In view of the localization of PTBR on the outer mitochondrial membrane, changes in PTBR in spf mouse tissues may modulate the altered mitochondrial function and oxidative metabolism, in brain and peripheral tissues, in congenital OTC deficiency. The positron emission tomography ligand 11C-PK 11195 could find an application in the assessment of end organ dysfunction in this disorder.", 
    "57": "To assess the effects of benzodiazepine alone and associated with caffeine on performance and substrate responses during supramaximal exercise, seven healthy volunteers performed the Wingate test after ingestion of placebo (Pla), benzodiazepine alone, i.e., 1 mg of lorazepam (Bz), and benzodiazepine followed by 250 mg of caffeine (Bz-Caf). Peak power (PP), mean power (MP), and percentage of power decrease (%PD) were determined, and substrate responses were estimated by blood lactate and catecholamine concentrations. Four hours after Bz ingestion, there was a significant decrease in PP (PPBz: 626 +/- 72 vs PPPla: 669 +/- 78 W), maximal blood lactate (La max) (La maxBz: 9.5 +/- 1.5 vs La maxPla: 12.4 +/- 1.8 mmol.l-1), and end-exercise epinephrine (E) (EBz: 339 +/- 113 vs EPla: 672 +/- 247 ng.l-1). No other changes were noted. Caffeine ingestion 1 h before the test (Bz-Caf) corrected the decrease in La max (La maxBz-Caf: 11.5 +/- 1.4 mmol.l-1) and E (EBz-Caf: 573 +/- 190 ng.l-1) but was unable to prevent the impairment of performance (PPBz-Caf: 625 +/- 68 W vs PPPla). Moderate benzodiazepine intake significantly altered performance and substrate responses during supramaximal exercise. Moderate caffeine intake antagonized the metabolic but not the performance effects of 1 mg of lorazepam.",

    "59": "Increased levels of natural benzodiazepine receptor agonists, produced in the body (endogenous) or ingested with food (exogenous) have been proposed as one of the factors causing hepatic encephalopathy in both experimental animals and human subjects. However, the divergent response of hepatic encephalopathy to benzodiazepine antagonists sheds doubt on this attractive hypothesis. Acute liver failure was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 17) with intraperitoneal thioacetamide (600 mg/kg/day for 3 days) while 14 control rats received vehicle only. Acute liver failure developed in all treated rats (AST: 1,898 +/- 1,359 IU/L vs. controls, 45 +/- 5 IU/L, p < 0.005; bilirubin: 36 +/- 27 mumol/L vs. controls, 1.5 +/- 0.5 mumol/L, p < 0.005; centrizonal necrosis) and grade 3 or 4 hepatic encephalopathy (neurologic assessment and activity monitoring). However, benzodiazepine receptor ligand activity, measured in the supernatant of whole-brain homogenates with a [3H]flumazenil binding competition assay, was clearly increased in only 1 of 17 rats with acute liver failure compared with controls (52.7 +/- 34.1 vs. 44.3 +/- 18.9 ng diazepam equivalents/gm; NS). To evaluate whether the reported increase in benzodiazepine receptor ligand activity could be due to prolonged residence of exogenous benzodiazepine-like substances, additional rats with acute liver failure and controls were treated with diazepam (five doses of 0.5 mg/kg at 12-hr intervals by gavage). Benzodiazepine receptor ligand activity was greater in animals with acute liver failure than in controls (223 +/- 65 vs. 103 +/- 23 ng diazepam equivalents/gm; p < 0.002) 1 to 3 hr after the last diazepam dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Self-ratings of avoidance and distress, frequency of panic attacks, diazepam use, and negative cognitions decreased with treatment. Treatment gains were maintained at 18-month follow-up. Tailoring of cognitive-behavioral treatment to panic with fears of loss of bowel control was emphasized.", 
    "61": "This paper addresses the issue of mind-brain correspondence, using a novel way to reduce brain electric field data in the frequency domain to estimates of intracerebral model source locations, and applying this method to brain electric data collected during the 2-s epochs immediately before the randomly solicited reports of spontaneous, conscious, covert experiences from 12 normal volunteers. The mentation reports were classified into visual imagery and abstract thought. The mean locations of the EEG model sources associated with abstract thoughts were generally more anterior and deeper than those of visual imagery, particularly significant for the delta/theta band; the finding was common across subjects. Thus, different brain functional states involving different geometries of activated neural populations exist during conscious, spontaneous, task-free mentations of the visual imagery type and of the abstract thought type.", 
    "62": "This study surveys the total community prescription use of benzodiazepine agents in Australia for the years 1990 and 1991. Also included is information on the utilisation of these agents on the Pharmaceutical Benefits and Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Schemes (PBS/RPBS) over the period 1987 to 1991. The Australian data are from the Drug Utilization Subcommittee (DUSC) database, which is derived from two sources: the PBS/RPBS (subsidized prescriptions), and a national sample of Pharmacy Guild of Australia pharmacies (private and under-copayment general prescriptions). The data are converted to defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day (DDD/1000/day) in accordance with the unit of measurement for drug utilisation studies approved by the World Health Organization. Benzodiazepine utilisation was 33.96 DDD/1000/day for 1990 and 29.31 DDD/1000/day for 1991. The four drugs listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, namely diazepam, oxazepam, nitrazepam and temazepam, constituted 82 per cent of the Australian market. The availability of government subsidy appears to influence benzodiazepine- prescribing behaviour. Benzodiazepine utilisation has been falling in recent years. The fall may be related to the impact of new guidelines and community awareness campaigns. There are major differences in the composition of the market between Australia and the Nordic countries.", 
    "63": "Methadone maintenance clients who used benzodiazepines were compared with other methadone maintenance clients on a range of drug use and psychosocial treatment outcome measures. Despite being on higher methadone doses, benzodiazepine users were more likely to have recently injected, to have used cocaine and amphetamines, to have borrowed or lent used needles and syringes, and to have reported polydrug use in the preceding month. Benzodiazepine users also exhibited higher levels of psychopathology and social dysfunction than other methadone maintenance clients. It is concluded that benzodiazepine-using methadone maintenance clients are a dysfunctional subgroup of the methadone population, who may require more clinical intervention than other clients.", 
    "64": "The binding of tenoxicam to human serum albumin has been shown by affinity chromatography proton titration and equilibrium dialysis to be dependent on the neutral to basic conformational change of the protein. The influence of diazepam on the interaction was also investigated using the same techniques, suggesting that diazepam increases the association of tenoxicam to albumin. Affinity chromatography revealed that the reciprocal effect also occurs. Displacement studies indicated that diazepam causes a significant increase in the affinity of tenoxicam to its main binding site, albumin site I, which is different from the diazepam site (site II). Tenoxicam seemed to cause an allosteric change in the conformation of the protein during its own binding, as did warfarin. The mechanism of this effect was a pH-dependent conformational change of albumin induced by electrostatic forces within the protein. Diazepam induced a distant accommodation of the protein, an effect accompanied by an enhanced inhibition of the release of protons from albumin.", 
    "65": "Studies were carried out on 28 male adult rats to investigate whether the selective cholecystokinin-receptor antagonist devazepide influences gastrointestinal transit under control conditions and when it is delayed by ileal infusion of lipid. Stomach-to-caecum transit time of the head of the test meal was measured using environmental hydrogen analysis and the distribution of the meal was assessed using the radiolabelled meal technique. Oral administration of devazepide (4 mg kg-1) had no significant effect on transit time of the head of the baked bean test meal under control conditions, but significantly reversed the delay in transit time induced by ileal infusion of lipid (P < 0.01). Studying the distribution of the meal showed that Intralipid delayed transit time by delaying both gastric emptying (P < 0.01) and small bowel transit (P < 0.05). Devazepide did not alter the control distribution of the meal during ileal saline infusion, but during ileal infusion of lipid, devazepide further delayed gastric emptying (P < 0.01); the geometric centre of the meal was situated more proximally in the gastrointestinal tract (P < 0.05), but there was more of the meal in the colon (P < 0.01). The latter is compatible with the early rise in environmental hydrogen during devazepide administration and ileal lipid infusion and suggests that peripheral cholecystokinin receptors may modulate or mediate the delay in small bowel transit induced by ileal lipid. However, the data also suggest that mechanisms other than those involving cholecystokinin play a dominant role in the regulation of postprandial and lipid-delayed gastric emptying of a meal.", 
    "66": "The pull-up test for muscle relaxation is described and validated. At testing, rats were evaluated for their ability to recover ('pull-up') from a fully inverted head-down position. Control animals rapidly regained position (median: 1 s). Known muscle relaxants increased latency to pull-up compared to controls. The test proved sensitive to the effects of barbiturates and benzodiazepines which produced graded dose-response functions. In general, results in the pull-up test corresponded with known potencies, with weaker muscle relaxants such as clobazam and oxazepam being less active. The test was relatively insensitive to non-benzodiazepine compounds (e.g., haloperidol, etomidate, morphine, fentanyl and risperidone) producing cataleptic, catatonic, neuroleptic, analgesic, sedative or hypnotic effects. In terms of ED50 values for barbiturates and benzodiazepines, the pull-up test correlated significantly with ED50s from the rotarod test, the antipentylenetetrazol test, ataxia in rats and muscle relaxation in cats. It was concluded that the pull-up test was relatively specific for muscle relaxation and provided a simple alternative to more time-consuming or equipment-intensive tests.", 
    "67": "This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ipsapirone (an azapirone anxiolytic) at daily dose levels of 10.0 to 30.0 mg with a daily dose of 2.0 to 6.0 mg of lorazepam (a benzodiazepine) or placebo when given to outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) of moderate or greater severity. A total of 317 outpatients with a primary diagnosis of GAD according to DSM-III criteria (at least 1 month's duration) were randomized. Study entry criteria at the time of screening and at baseline included a Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) score of 18 or more, a Covi Anxiety Scale score of 8 or more, and a Raskin Depression Scale score of 7 or less. The study design consisted of a 1-week, single-blind placebo evaluation, a 4-week, double-blind acute treatment period, and a 4-week extension period, followed by a 2-week, single-blind placebo withdrawal period. Efficacy was measured by changes in the HAM-A and Clinical Global Impression Scale and by evaluations of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Zung-Anxiety Self-Rating scale. The Raskin and Covi scales were performed at screening and baseline only. Withdrawal reactions were assessed during the withdrawal period by the Physician Withdrawal Checklist and by a patient self-rating checklist. Two-hundred sixty-three patients were valid for the analysis of efficacy in the ipsapirone (N = 87), lorazepam (N = 89), and placebo (N = 87) groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "68": "Beyond the continuing use of neuroleptic medication, psychopharmacological treatment approaches during the maintenance phase of schizophrenia often involve adjunctive medication. Appropriate use of such 'polypharmacy' can be crucial to patients in achieving their optimal levels of symptom management and functional capacity, although the risks of side-effects and medication interactions must be weighed. This paper reviews the use of adjunctive anti-Parkinsonian medication, benzodiazepines, propranolol, antidepressants, lithium, and carbamazepine in this context. It also explores a strategy of identifying secondary syndromes in the longitudinal course of schizophrenia which can be approached psychopharmacologically.", 
    "69": "Drug-naive mice failed to exhibit antipunishment effects of ascending doses of buspirone (1-30 mg/kg, PO) in an operant punishment paradigm; however, these same mice subsequently exhibited increased punished responding after diazepam (10 mg/kg, PO). In a separate group of drug-naive mice, diazepam (1-30 mg/kg, PO)produced a robust antipunishment effect under identical experimental conditions, but crossover to buspirone (10 mg/kg, PO) failed to enhance punished responding. In a further experiment using this conflict model, two groups of benzodiazepine-experienced mice received daily oral administration of either vehicle or buspirone (5 mg/kg) for four weeks followed by a test with buspirone; neither group exhibited an antipunishment effect. Two other groups of benzodiazepine-experienced mice received either oral vehicle or diazepam (5 mg/kg) daily for four weeks followed by a test with diazepam; both groups exhibited a clear antipunishment effect. Finally, a group of benzodiazepine-experienced mice given vehicle daily for four weeks followed by a test with vehicle failed to exhibit an antipunishment effect. Thus, despite the attempt to optimize some important experimental conditions in this mouse conflict paradigm, buspirone still failed to produce an antipunishment effect. In contrast, diazepam consistently exhibited a robust anxiolytic-like effect under the same experimental conditions.", 
    "70": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether withdrawal from chronic exposure to the female sex steroid progesterone (P) alters response of female rats to an electrified prod using the defensive burying paradigm, considered a rat model of anxiety. Withdrawal from chronic exposure to 500 micrograms P (daily, SC, for four days) resulted in a significant decrease in the latency (77%, P < 0.05) to prod burial and an increase in duration (75%, P < 0.05) of this reflexive response, compared with the behavior of oil-injected controls. These results are consistent with the idea that withdrawal from chronic exposure to P increases behaviors that accompany anxiety. At a lower dose (50 micrograms), withdrawal from chronically administered P produced significant changes in response to this paradigm only when the steroid was given concomitantly with estradiol (2 micrograms, SC, for two days). Prior exposure to indomethacin, which blocks the conversion of P to its metabolite 3 alpha,5 alpha-tetrahydroprogesterone (3-alpha-hydroxy-5-alpha-pregnan-20-one), prevented P withdrawal from altering response in the defensive burying paradigm. This finding suggests that it may be withdrawal from this metabolite, rather than P, which increases behaviors associated with increased anxiety.", 
    "71": "Our current state of knowledge regarding the pharmacologic management of BDs is at an early point in its evolution, exceeded only marginally by our ability to define the nosologic boundaries of these disorders. As the boundaries become better defined, especially those shared with the AD spectrum, and concurrently there is an effort to define nosologic subgroups based on differential drug treatment response, we gradually will be able to prospectively make better prescribing decisions and thereby reduce the trial-and-error aspect, with its potential for further sensitizing this population who already deal poorly with inconstancy.", 
    "72": "Of 890 nursing home patients with dementia, admitted between 1980 en 1989 to Dutch nursing home 'Joachim en Anna' in Nijmegen, each episode of psychotropic drug use was retrospectively registered. Drugs were coded by means of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)-classification system and the daily dose was expressed as the ratio of the prescribed daily dose and the internationally agreed defined daily dose. Side effects were analysed as were changes in prescription patterns throughout the years of patient admittance. A total of 3090 episodes were registered. Neuroleptics, benzodiazepines and antidepressants accounted for 58, 32 and 9% of the prescriptions. In almost every drug-prescription the prescribed daily dose was lower than the defined daily dose. More than 75% of the patients had at least one prescription for a psychotropic drug during institutionalization. Half of those patients who used a neuroleptic showed one or more side effects. Neither the total amount of patients with psychotropics nor the duration of usage changed throughout the years of patient admittance. It is concluded that a majority of these nursing home patients got at least one prescription of a psychotropic drug during institutionalization. Psychotropics were prescribed for long-term usage, but in low doses. Side effects were frequently observed in determining the right dose.", 
    "73": "Using the cannula insertion method, we investigated the vascular responses of isolated simian coronary artery to acetylcholine (ACh). When the preparation was partially precontracted by 20 mM KCl, ACh and carbachol induced vasodilation dose dependently in coronary artery with endothelium, but ACh and carbachol contracted the coronary artery after removal of the endothelium by 1 mg saponin. A selective M1 receptor agonist 4-[N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamoyloxy]-2-butinyltrimethylammonium++ + chloride (McN-A-343) did not affect the perfusion pressure of the precontracted coronary arteries significantly. Both these responses to ACh were inhibited by the M3 receptor antagonist 4-dipheny-lacetoxy N-methylpiperidine methobromide (4-DAMP) in a dose-dependent manner, but not by a selective M2 receptor antagonist AF-DX 116 (11-[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl] acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzo-diazepine-6-one). A selective M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine did not affect ACh-induced vasoconstriction significantly and inhibited the vasodilation partially only at the highest dose (100 nmol). The effects of three antagonists on the vasodilative responses to carbachol were also studied and almost the same results were observed. Removal of the endothelium did not affect sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced vasodilation significantly. Pirenzepine, AF-DX 116, and 4-DAMP did not affect the action of isoproterenol. These data suggest that the vasodilation elicited by ACh is mediated by release of endothelium-derived relaxing factors (EDRF) consequent to the activation of M3 receptors on endothelial cells, and the constriction is mediated by stimulation of M3 receptors on smooth muscle cells in isolated simian coronary arteries.", 
    "74": "The proconvulsant properties of exogenously administered opioids in man are not established. We prospectively evaluated relationships between epileptiform activity and opioid dose in 20 patients undergoing coronary artery revascularization. Baseline electroencephalograms were performed before surgery. Ten subjects were given fentanyl and 10 sufentanil, at 100 micrograms/kg and 10 micrograms/kg, respectively, in 4 divided doses, 3 min apart. Midazolam (4 mg) was given 3 min after the last dose of narcotic. Serum opioid concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. Within 3 min of the first opioid dose, 19 of 20 patients developed epileptiform activity, characterized by generalized single and multiphasic, low-to-moderate voltage spike discharges, similar in appearance to benign epileptiform transients of sleep (BETS). Despite continuously increasing serum concentrations of opioid, the number of spike discharges initially increased during the first and second dose intervals and then declined during the third and fourth dose intervals. This dissociation between epileptiform discharges and measured serum opioid concentration was unexpected and remained unexplained. Spike activity was consistently attenuated (P = 0.000003) within 20 sec of midazolam administration. Abrupt cessation of discharges after administration of the anticonvulsant, midazolam, suggests an epileptogenic mechanism for the opioid-induced activity.", 
    "75": "The cytoprotective effects of MK-801 and NBQX, selective N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonists, respectively, were compared both singularly and in combination in models of transient severe forebrain and transient focal cerebral ischemia. After 10 minutes of four-vessel occlusion ischemia, the sodium salt of NBQX (30 mg/kg IP) given at the time of reperfusion and, subsequently, 15 and 30 minutes later produced a dramatic reduction in CA1 hippocampal necrosis at 7 days. This effect was not obtained with the intraperitoneal administration of either MK-801 (1 mg/kg x 3) or the combination of both NBQX and MK-801 given at the same time intervals. This effect of intraperitoneal NBQX alone was reproduced in a two-vessel occlusion/hypotension model using this same drug administration. Delayed treatment with both NBQX and GYKI 52466, but neither MK-801 nor the combination of NBQX and MK-801 given after a delay, produced a significant reduction in the mean volume of neocortical infarction after transient focal ischemia. We conclude that the AMPA receptor may play a more important role than the NMDA receptor in both selective ischemic necrosis of hippocampal neurons and in neocortical infarction. AMPA antagonists should be subjected to clinical stroke trials.", 
    "76": "With the availability of selective gastrin/CCKB (L365,260) and CCKA (L364,718) receptor antagonists the present study was designed to investigate the role of gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors in meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion. Gastric acid output was measured by continuous intragastric titration in conscious rats. Vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide/saline, 3:1), L365,260 (3 or 9 mg/kg), or L364,718 (1 mg/kg) was given by i.v. bolus injection. Basal acid output was strongly inhibited by both doses of L365,260 while L364,718 had no effect. Intragastric peptone (4%, w/v) increased acid secretion 40-65% of the response to a maximal dose (2.5 nmol/kg per h) of gastrin-17. L365,260 completely abolished gastrin-17 stimulated acid secretion and partially inhibited peptone-induced acid secretion. Blockade of CCKA receptors by L364,718 did not affect peptone-stimulated acid output. This study demonstrates that gastrin/CCKB receptors are important in regulating basal acid secretion in the conscious rat while CCKA receptors do not appear to influence basal or peptone-stimulated gastric acid secretion. Blockade of gastrin/CCKB receptors partially inhibits intragastric meal-stimulated acid secretion indicating that the gastrin/CCKB receptor has a physiological role as mediator of food-stimulated acid secretory response in conscious rats.", 
    "77": "The distributions of sodium and potassium in the serum on admission, and the types of medicine used were studied retrospectively in hospitalized geriatric patients (n = 1418). Sodium concentrations below 130 mmol/l were found in 7.4% and potassium concentrations below 3.0 mmol/l in 5.0% of patients. Risk factors for low sodium concentrations were treatment with the combination of thiazide+amiloride, potassium-sparing diuretics, thiazides, emergency hospitalization and low body weight. Risk factors for low potassium concentrations were treatment with the combination of thiazide+amiloride, thiazides and female gender. On an average, patients were given two different drugs from specified groups both on admission and on discharge, but changes in medical treatment were often performed during the hospital stay. Prehospital treatment with thiazide diuretics and the combination of thiazide+amiloride was frequently withdrawn. 38% were given benzodiazepines on discharge. In 40.4% of these, treatment had been started during the hospital stay, most often on account of insomnia.", 
    "78": "We applied micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography to simultaneous separation and determination of nitrazepam and its major metabolites, 7-aminonitrazepam and 7-acetamidonitrazepam, in spiked urine. Prior to electrophoresis, the three compounds were successfully extracted from the spiked urine with commercial disposable solid-phase cartridges. The optimum running buffer for the separation was prepared by combining 85 parts of 60 mM sodium dodecyl sulphate-6 mM phosphate-borate, adjusted to pH 8.5, with 15 parts of methanol. The separation order, completed within 25 min, was 7-aminonitrazepam > 7-acetamidonitrazepam > nitrazepam, at an applied potential of 20 kV. We obtained reproducible electropherograms in successive repetitions, and few other peaks or interferences appeared in the electropherogram. The detection limits of the three compounds were 50-100 pg (0.1-0.2 microgram/ml of analyte in spiked urine), and the recoveries were 78.9-100.8% for 1 microgram/ml and 84.1-100.3% for 5 micrograms/ml. The application of this method to forensic or clinical samples is demonstrated.", 
    "79": "[3H]Azidobutyryl clentiazem, a new photoactivable diltiazem derivative, has a higher binding affinity than azidobutyryl diltiazem. It can be covalently incorporated into the alpha 1 subunit of the skeletal muscle calcium channel by UV irradiation, which allows the benzothiazepine binding site to be determined. The photolabeled alpha 1 subunit and its proteolytic fragments were analyzed with a panel of sequence-directed antibodies. The results suggest that the linker region between segment S5 and S6 of domain IV is involved in benzothiazepine binding. This site is different from the dihydropyridine and verapamil binding sites.", 
    "80": "Inherited myoclonus in Poll Hereford calves and spasticity in the spastic mouse (spa/spa) are characterized by myoclonic jerks of the skeletal musculature which occur spontaneously and in response to sensory stimuli, symptoms resembling those in subconvulsive strychnine poisoning. The primary, biochemical defect in these myoclonic animals is a deficit of inhibitory glycine receptors in the central nervous system. We now report the occurrence of similar stimulus-induced myoclonus in individual, pure-bred Peruvian Paso horses and an associated, specific deficiency in the density of [3H]strychnine binding to inhibitory glycine receptors sites in spinal cord of these animals. Specificity of the deficit was confirmed by a demonstrated lack of change in the density of several other receptor types in affected spinal cord, including muscarinic receptors and GABAA/benzodiazepine receptors. In light of the existence of genetically-inherited myoclonus in other species, these results suggest the occurrence of an equine form of the disorder.", 
    "81": "The ability of the non-NMDA glutamate antagonist NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulphamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline) to protect the brain against the neuronal death caused by glutamate agonists was examined. Glutamate agonists and NBQX were co-injected into the dorsal region of the rat hippocampus and 4 days later the brain was examined histochemically for the loss of neurons. 95 nmol NBQX prevented the toxicity of glutamate agonists acting on the AMPA receptor (quisqualate and AMPA [L-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate]), except for the higher dose of AMPA where toxicity was only partially reduced. This dose of NBQX also prevented about 50% of the toxicity of kainate, but produced a slight increase in the size of the lesions caused by NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate). With 190 nmol NBQX, a variable degree of non-specific damage resulted, but was mainly confined to the dentate region. Allowing for this damage, almost complete protection against the toxicity of non-NMDA glutamate agonists was obtained, with a partial protection against NMDA toxicity. Kainate, and a high dose of AMPA (2 nmol), consistently caused neuronal death in other limbic regions of the brain in addition to the hippocampal damage. About 50% of rats treated with 15 nmol quisqualate also showed damage to limbic regions. Both doses of NBQX prevented this distal damage caused by quisqualate, but not that caused by kainate. With AMPA, only the high dose of NBQX blocked the distal toxicity. Diazepam also blocked the distal toxicity of AMPA, but had only a minor effect on the hippocampal damage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "82": "In order to explore the potential clinical utility of CCK-B antagonists for the treatment of benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms, the auditory startle reflex was examined in rats undergoing withdrawal from the chronic administration of diazepam. Animals were exposed to diazepam continuously for 12 days (20 mg kg-1 per day) via osmotic minipumps. After 12 days the pumps were removed and the animals were allowed to go through spontaneous withdrawal for 4 days. Acute pretreatment with either diazepam or the selective CCK-B antagonist LY288513 dose-dependently blocked withdrawal-induced increases in the auditory startle response. These results support the hypothesis that the selective CCK-B antagonist LY288513 may be an effective treatment for alleviating at least some benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms in man.", 
    "83": "The triazolobenzodiazepine estazolam can be quantitated by gas chromatography with electron-capture detection. After addition of a suitable internal standard, plasma samples are extracted into toluene-isoamyl alcohol or benzene-isoamyl alcohol. The organic extract is separated, evaporated to dryness, reconstituted, and chromatographed using a 50:50 methyl-phenyl column (SP-2250). The sensitivity limit is approximately 1 ng of estazolam in a 1-ml sample. The method is suitable for clinical or experimental pharmacokinetic studies.", 
    "84": "The binding of carprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug of the aryl propionic acid class [2-(6-chlorocarbazole)propionic acid], and its enantiomers to human serum albumin (HSA) has been studied by dialysis and spectroscopic methods. Binding parameters obtained by different methods were in close agreement. The binding of carprofen to HSA by both fluorescence and equilibrium dialysis (ED) methods is characterized by two sets of association constants [K1 = 5.1 x 10(6) M-1 (fluorescence) and 3.7 x 10(6) M-1 (ED), K2 = 3.7 x 10(5) M-1 (fluorescence) and 1.3 x 10(5) M-1 (ED)]. The S(+)-enantiomer of carprofen showed slightly higher affinity for HSA than its corresponding antipode by both methods. Different analyses of the binding to HSA suggested the presence of one high affinity site and five to seven low affinity sites for carprofen and its enantiomers on HSA. Fluorescence displacement data implied that carprofen primarily binds to site II, the benzodiazepine site, while the low affinity site of carprofen is site I, the warfarin site. Circular dichroism data suggested different mechanisms for the high affinity and the low affinity binding of carprofen to HSA. The data are consistent with the major part of the binding energy at site II being electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, whereas for the low affinity binding, hydrophobic interactions. Binding was exothermic, entropy driven and spontaneous, as indicated by the thermodynamic analyses. From binding data with chemically modified HSA derivatives, it is likely that tyrosine, lysine and histidine residues are especially involved in carprofen binding to HSA, and it is most likely that the high affinity binding of carprofen is located in the N-terminal part of domain III or that section of protein plus the C-terminal part of domain II of the HSA molecule. When the binding of carprofen to HSA was compared to the binding of carprofen methyl ester to HSA (K = 0.1 x 10(6) M-1), the carboxyl group of carprofen was found to play an important role especially in the high affinity binding of carprofen to HSA. The high affinity of carprofen to HSA was independent of the conformational changes on HSA caused by N-B transition.", 
    "85": "The effect of chronic flurazepam treatment on the GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor/chloride channel complex was studied using GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx into brain microsacs, and its potentiation by diazepam, clonazepam and bretazenil. Rats were given flurazepam for 1 week, then microsacs were prepared from cerebral cortices of rats that were still receiving flurazepam, and from those that had stopped treatment 48 h earlier. Diazepam and clonazepam produced concentration-dependent increases in GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx while bretazenil produced a much smaller effect, which did not reach statistical significance in the tissue from control rats. There was no significant change in the basal or 10 microM GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx between control and treated groups. Tolerance was shown by a significantly reduced effect of diazepam and clonazepam to enhance GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx in the tissue prepared from non-withdrawn rats. However, for both diazepam and clonazepam, there was no tolerance 48 h after chronic treatment. The results suggest that changes in the GABA receptor/Cl- channel complex on cerebral cortical neurons contribute to cross-tolerance from flurazepam to other benzodiazepines.", 
    "86": "Ro 16-6028 (bretazenil) has a pharmacological profile characteristic of a partial agonist at the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor-linked benzodiazepine site. The present study utilized modulation of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) binding and enhancement of GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake to further assess Ro 16-6028's partial agonist profile in vitro. Ro 16-6028 was the most potent benzodiazepine examined, exhibiting an IC50 (concentration at which half-maximal inhibition of specific [35S]TBPS binding occurs) of 6.1 nM, compared to clonazepam (7.9 nM), flunitrazepam (13.6 nM) and diazepam (91.1 nM). The rank order of potency for inhibition of [35S]TBPS binding was identical to that for inhibition of [3H]flunitrazepam binding. However, Ro 16-6028 was less efficacious in that it produced 27% inhibition of specific [35S]TBPS binding, compared to clonazepam (34%), flunitrazepam (41%) or diazepam (49%). Ro 16-6028 antagonized the inhibition of [35S]TBPS binding produced by 10 microM diazepam. Ro 16-6028 was also more potent and less efficacious than diazepam in potentiating GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake. These results provide further evidence that Ro 16-6028 is acting as a partial agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor in modulating function of the GABAA receptor complex.", 
    "87": "In vivo microdialysis was used to determine the ability of benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) ligands to modulate stimulated cortical acetylcholine (ACh) efflux in awake, freely-moving Fischer-344/BNNia rats. Cortical ACh efflux was reliably enhanced during presentation of a complex stimulus (exposure to darkness coupled with presentation of a small amount of palatable food) in animals entrained with that stimulus. Administration of the BZR selective inverse agonist ZK 93,426 (5.0 mg/kg, i.p.) potentiated the ability of the darkness/food stimulus to enhance efflux, whereas administration of the BZR full agonist, chlordiazepoxide (5.0 mg/kg, i.p.) blocked the enhancement. The interaction of the BZR ligands with the entrained stimulus in affecting cortical ACh efflux was not secondary to effects on motor activity. These results, combined with results from a previous study, suggest that modulation of cortical ACh efflux by BZR ligands is bidirectional and dependent on the level of activity within cortical cholinergic neurons. This relationship enables the trans-synaptic stimulation of cortical ACh transmission by BZR inverse agonists to be most effective during behavioral activities which recruit the basal forebrain cholinergic system.", 
    "88": "Previous pharmacological studies of methylated oxotremorine derivatives bearing substituents at the 3-, 4-, and 5-positions of the pyrrolidinone ring have been conducted using racemic mixtures, and not with optically active compounds. The synthesis and radioligand binding data of optically active, methylated oxotremorine derivatives at the 3- and 4-positions are described. There are significant pharmacological differences between the 3- and 4-position derivatives. The 4-position enantiomers have weak, approximately equal affinity and antagonist-like profiles, whereas the 3-position enantiomers have significantly different affinities and partial agonist-like profiles.", 
    "89": "The paper consists in a report of a retrospective study (of data from 1987) on the prevalence of benzodiazepines in blood at the time of death. Of 2,007 autopsies, forensic chemical analyses were performed in 1,587 cases, in 159 of which benzodiazepines were found. Of these 159 deaths, 22 were considered to be due to natural causes, and in another 22 cases the cause of death was still unclear after examination; the remaining 115 deaths were due to accidents (N = 16), suicide (N = 60), drug addiction (N = 29) or alcoholism (N = 10). Multiple benzodiazepine intake was found in 37 cases, a subgroup including all 29 cases of death due to drug addiction. In a comparison of suicides and natural deaths, the concentrations both of flunitrazepam and nitrazepam were significantly higher among the suicides (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). In four cases, the sole cause of death was benzodiazepine intake. It is concluded that some benzodiazepines, particularly flunitrazepam, may be more toxic than formerly supposed.", 
    "90": "The ability of muscarinic receptor antagonists to compete with (-)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) binding was compared with their ability to block carbachol-mediated stimulation of particulate guanylate cyclase activity in rat colonocytes. The binding of [3H]QNB to membranes was inhibited by antagonists with the following rank order of potencies (inhibitory constants, nM): atropine (2.5) approximately 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine iodide (4-DAMP) [4.6] > pirenzepine (121) > methoctramine (385). 4-DAMP (IC50 = approximately 10 nM) was also more potent in blocking carbachol-induced stimulation of guanylate cyclase activity than either pirenzepine (IC50 = approximately 700 nM) or methoctramine (IC50 = approximately 1500 nM).", 
    "91": "The purified mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (mBzR) is a complex comprising the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), adenine nucleotide carrier, and an 18-kDa protein that binds isoquinoline carboxamide ligands (McEnery, M. W., Snowman, A. M., Trifiletti, R. R., and Snyder, S. H. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 3170-3174). An antiserum raised against the mBzR complex reacts selectively with VDAC and is used, along with purification, electrophysiological and immunohistochemical techniques, to characterize the properties and distribution of rat brain VDAC. Although purified VDAC displays biochemical and electrical conductance properties similar to VDAC from other sources, the immunohistochemical distribution of VDAC in rat brain is heterogeneous with pronounced regional variations; the pontine nuclei, the supraoptic nucleus, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, and the caudate putamen evidence the highest density. The distribution of VDAC is inclusive of the more discretely localized 18-kDa mBzR protein, suggesting that only a portion of the total VDAC participates in the mBzR. The histochemical localizations of the mitochondrial marker enzymes glutamate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase also indicate marked regional variability in both mitochondrial content and composition. The discrete expression of VDAC reflects a striking heterogeneity of rat brain mitochondria and underlying differences in the utilization of mitochondrial outer membrane ion channels.", 
    "92": "Drug utilisation review (DUR) has been adopted as a mechanism for balancing cost containment and quality in prescription drug programmes. In this article we review published DUR reports in order to examine the cost effectiveness of DUR in an outpatient setting. DUR reports are defined either as DUR studies, which examine patterns of drug use, or as DUR programmes, which examine patterns of drug use and subsequent efforts to alter drug use. An adequate cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is defined as one that used multiple methods to measure and evaluate patterns of drug use, and/or efforts to alter drug use, and that also performed an analysis of the costs of the review or intervention methods employed, with a focus on efficiency. DUR studies and programmes that satisfied all the criteria and thus fit the framework for conducting CEA were included; others that satisfied only some of the criteria were examined for the insights that they could contribute to a study of costs relative to outcomes. We identified 14 reports that could be categorised as DUR studies. Only 3 of these examined more than 1 method of measuring and evaluating drug use, thereby potentially fitting the CEA framework, but none included a cost analysis. Of the other DUR studies, only 1 contained estimates of costs for the DUR method employed, but since it examined only 1 DUR method it did not satisfy the criteria for an adequate CEA. Although such studies provide information about different methods of identifying drug use patterns (a somewhat intermediate outcome), they do not provide insight into the cost effectiveness of methods designed to influence drug use. We identified 34 reports of DUR programmes. Only 5 of these reports fit the CEA framework; they examined multiple efforts to change drug use patterns (after identifying drug use patterns). None of them satisfied the criteria for an adequate CEA; in 3 of the reports no costs were provided, and the other 2 provided only partial input costs or costs for only some of the interventions designed to change drug use. DUR programmes were grouped by drug or drug use issue in an attempt to gain insights by comparing reports on similar drugs. The drugs or drug classes and number of reports reviewed were: cephalosporins (3); chloramphenicol (3); antiulcer drugs (2); dextropropoxyphene (2); tranquillisers (benzodiazepines) {3}; anti-infective agents (5); 'all drugs' (7); and other drugs/miscellaneous (9).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "93": "This study is based on the steady state method for the calculation of Kd values recently described by Lassen (J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 12 (1992), 709), in which a constant infusion of the examined nonradioactive ligand is used with a bolus injection of tracer. Eight volunteers were examined twice, once without receptor blockade and once with a constant degree of partial blockade of the benzodiazepine receptors by infusion of nonradioactive flumazenil (Lanexat) or midazolam (Dormicum). Single photon emission computer tomography and blood sampling were performed intermittently for 6 h after bolus injection of [123I]iomazenil. The tracer in plasma was determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography and also by a simple octanol extraction procedure. The free concentration of flumazenil and midazolam in plasma water averaged 52% and 3.5% of that in whole plasma. The Kd values for the entire cortical rim for flumazenil were 7.4, 10.0, 10.3 and 17.7 nmol/l plasma water and, for midazolam, 73, 76, 58 and 30 nmol/l plasma water. The variation exceeds random methodological error and is probably due to interindividual differences in receptor affinity. The Kd level of midazolam is considerably higher than expected from the results of in vitro studies.", 
    "94": "We examined the effects of the gastrin family of peptides on gastric mucus glycoprotein (mucin) biosynthesis in rat gastric mucosa using an organ culture technique. Radiolabeled mucin was obtained from the tissue and culture medium of the corpus and antrum of rat stomach incubated for 5 hr with [3H]glucosamine (GlcN), [14C]threonine (Thr), and [35S]sulfate in vitro. With the addition of 10(-8) and 10(-7) M tetragastrin to the culture medium, [3H]GlcN labeled mucin in the corpus tissue increased to 120-135% that of the control (P < 0.01). The biosynthetic responses to cholecystokinin (CCK)-8 and the 17-peptide gastrin were essentially the same as that to tetragastrin. Tetragastrin 10(-8) M also increased the incorporation of [35S]sulfate into the corpus mucin but failed to change [14C]Thr incorporation. In the antrum, biosynthetic activity showed no significant change with 10(-9) approximately 10(-5) M tetragastrin. Ranitidine, diphenhydramine and omeprazole at 10(-5) M did not suppress the tetragastrin-induced increase in [3H]GlcN incorporation into mucin, but L-365,260 at a concentration of 10(-6) M completely blocked this effect. These results suggest that gastrin stimulates mucin production via CCK-B/gastrin receptors in the oxyntic region of rat gastric mucosa.", 
    "95": "Metabolism of the anticancer drug taxol was investigated in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes. Two main metabolites were separated by reversed-phase HPLC and shown by tandem mass spectrometry to be monohydroxylated metabolites. Kinetic studies revealed apparent Km values of 68 and 61 microM with identical Vmax values for the two metabolites. Verapamil and midazolam, but not phenacetin, showed concentration-dependent inhibition of taxol metabolism with both metabolites being affected equally. The IC50 was about 100 microM for verapamil and 25 microM for midazolam. These observations demonstrate for the first time in vitro metabolism of taxol and suggest that the metabolism may be subject to potentially important interactions with numerous other drugs.", 
    "96": "Sixty ASA Grade II-III patients, without clinical symptoms of ventricular dysfunction and scheduled for elective bifemoral grafting for abdominal aneurysms, were allocated randomly to three equal groups to receive 150 micrograms sufentanil intravenously, epidurally or intrathecally. All patients received midazolam, vecuronium and nitrous oxide. Except for right ventricular stroke work index and pulmonary vascular resistance, all haemodynamic measurements decreased after sufentanil injection, but to the greatest extent after intravenous injection. Response to abdominal incision reversed the haemodynamic changes, although this was not accompanied by an increase in heart rate and coronary perfusion pressure after intrathecal injection. Four patients given intravenous, and four patients given epidural sufentanil required additional sufentanil after abdominal incision. Despite the changes in systemic vascular resistance and the concordant alterations in cardiac index after aortic cross-clamping and revascularization, intrathecal sufentanil provided more stability in heart rate than intravenous or epidural sufentanil. In conclusion, intrathecal sufentanil produced the most stable heart rate. Two patients in the intrathecal group developed spinal headaches post-operatively.",

The quality of the pre-operative night's sleep assessed subjectively was significantly better in patients receiving temazepam (P = < 0.05) and midazolam (P = < 0.05) compared with those receiving no drug. The concentrations of cortisol and monoamine neurotransmitters or their metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid were of no value in monitoring the quality of the pre-operative night's sleep.", 
    "98": "Current evidence suggests that anxiety has a neurobiologic basis. It is thought to be caused by dysfunction of one or more neurotransmitters and their receptors. Most data, which are derived from study of the benzodiazepine-gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor complex, indicate that alteration of the influx of chloride ions within this receptor complex is associated with the development of anxiety. The primary therapeutic effect of benzodiazepines occurs at this receptor complex. All clinically available benzodiazepines are active at this receptor complex, producing therapeutic results and side effects. Subtypes of benzodiazepine receptors as well as endogenous benzodiazepine ligands also have been identified. These may play a role in the pathogenesis of anxiety. Benzodiazepines also modulate the production of neuroactive steroids in the central nervous system. In the future, drugs that affect these varying benzodiazepine functions may play a role in the treatment of anxiety. Other neurotransmitters also have been implicated in the genesis of anxiety. Drugs affecting the noradrenergic beta receptor and the 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptors have anxiolytic properties. New evidence also suggests a role for adenosine and cholecystokinin in the development of anxiety; drugs interacting with these neurotransmitters also may have anxiolytic properties.", 
    "99": "Orthostatic tremor, sometimes known as \"shaky legs syndrome,\" is a disorder of middle-aged or elderly people characterized by feelings of unsteadiness in the legs and a fear of falling when standing. Patients stand on a wide base but walk normally. These symptoms are due to high-frequency (13-18 Hz) burst firing in weight-bearing muscles. They are attenuated by walking and are abolished immediately by sitting. Some authors believe that the disorder is a variant of essential tremor. This study reports the clinical and electrophysiologic features of orthostatic tremor in 30 patients. The findings indicate that orthostatic tremor is distinct from essential tremor, both clinically and electrophysiologically. The major differences are the frequency of electromyographic burst firing, the invariable involvement of lower limb and paraspinal muscles, and the task-specific nature of the tremor in orthostatic tremor. The study shows that the diagnosis can be established rapidly with surface electromyographic recordings.", 
    "100": "We investigated the mechanism of cramps in 2 patients: a 48-year-old man with bulbospinal neuronopathy, and a 46-year-old man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Cramps were quite easily induced by volitional exertion and high-frequency stimulation of the peripheral nerves. When an ulnar nerve was blocked with lidocaine at the elbow, no cramp was induced despite the application of high-frequency stimulation at the wrist. Diazepam (GABAA agonist) was effective in the first patient and baclofen (GABAB agonist) in the second, with no cramps induced in spite of increasing stimulation intensity. Impairment of interneurons mediated by GABA as the neurotransmitter is thought to be involved in the mechanism of the cramps.", 
    "101": "The clinical effectiveness of cyclosporine is limited by changes in resorption and metabolism of cyclosporine and by possible drug interactions. This study examined the influence of five gastrointestinal agents on duration and resorption of cyclosporine and dosage/level relations: cimetidine, famotidine, pirenzepine, aluminum hydroxide, and omeprazole. These gastrointestinal agents were studied in 64 rat experiments, in which the impact of each single drug and of drug combinations on cyclosporine resorption and metabolism was tested. A standardized dosage of cyclosporine was given orally, and the duration was calculated for the maximum whole blood level of cyclosporine to be achieved; the dosage/level quotient was calculated. Cimetidine, famotidine, pirenzepine, and combination treatment prolonged duration of cyclosporine resorption. Furthermore, cimetidine, famotidine, and omeprazole lowered the dosage/level quotient, thus leading to higher cyclosporine levels with the same dosage; pirenzepine increased the dosage/level quotient. For clinical comparison, 163 heart transplant patients who had received standard triple-drug immunosuppressive therapy were analyzed. The time interval until a therapeutic cyclosporine level was achieved and the dosage/level quotient were once again calculated. Similar to the results in the animal experiments, cimetidine and famotidine significantly delayed the resorption of cyclosporine; cimetidine, famotidine, and omeprazole lowered the cyclosporine dosage/level quotient, thus leading to higher cyclosporine levels with the same dosage. Aluminum hydroxide did not lead to any changes in the resorption or metabolism of cyclosporine. Most examined gastrointestinal agents, and particularly H2-blocking drugs, led to significant prolongation of cyclosporine resorption and cyclosporine level alterations. The initial prolongation of cyclosporine resorption was successfully avoided by intravenous administration of cyclosporine for the first 4 postoperative days in 40 consecutive patients."
