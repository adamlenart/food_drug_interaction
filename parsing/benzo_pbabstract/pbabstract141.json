    "19": "Pineal melatonin is synthesized and secreted in close association with the light/dark cycle. The temporal relationship between the nocturnal rise in melatonin secretion and the \"opening of the sleep gate\" (i.e., the increase in sleep propensity at the beginning of the night), coupled with the sleep-promoting effects of exogenous melatonin, suggest that melatonin is involved in the regulation of sleep. The sleep-promoting and sleep/wake rhythm regulating effects of melatonin are attributed to its action on MT(1) and MT(2) melatonin receptors present in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Animal experiments carried out in rats, cats, and monkeys have revealed that melatonin has the ability to reduce sleep onset time and increase sleep duration. However, clinical studies reveal inconsistent findings, with some of them reporting beneficial effects of melatonin on sleep, whereas in others only marginal effects are documented. Recently a prolonged-release 2-mg melatonin preparation (Circadin(TM)) was approved by the European Medicines Agency as a monotherapy for the short-term treatment of primary insomnia in patients who are aged 55 or above. Several melatonin derivatives have been shown to increase nonrapid eye movement (NREM) in rats and are of potential pharmacological importance. So far only one of these melatonin derivatives, ramelteon, has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to be used as a sleep promoter. Ramelteon is a novel MT(1) and MT(2) melatonergic agonist that has specific effects on melatonin receptors in the SCN and is effective in promoting sleep in experimental animals such as cats and monkeys. In clinical trials, ramelteon reduced sleep onset latency and promoted sleep in patients with chronic insomnia, including an older adult population. Both melatonin and ramelteon promote sleep by regulating the sleep/wake rhythm through their actions on melatonin receptors in the SCN, a unique mechanism of action not shared by any other hypnotics. Moreover, unlike benzodiazepines, ramelteon causes neither withdrawal effects nor dependence. Agomelatine, another novel melatonergic antidepressant in its final phase of approval for clinical use, has been shown to improve sleep in depressed patients and to have an antidepressant efficacy that is partially attributed to its effects on sleep-regulating mechanisms.",

Initially, it was assumed to be muscle uptake secondary to patient anxiety or tension, which could be prevented by diazepam treatment. However, PET-computed tomography data have shown that 18F-FDG uptake is not restricted to the musculature but is also localised within the non-muscular soft tissue, such as brown adipose tissue.

    "44": "The drug therapy of epilepsy evolved enormously in this 50 year period. Advances in therapeutics included the incorporation of pharmacokinetics into clinical practice, enormous advances in neurochemistry, a trend to antiepileptic drug monotherapy, better drug assessment, better understanding of therapeutic outcomes, and the recognition of the large epilepsy treatment gap in many countries. An unprecedented range of new drugs was introduced in this period. Before 1989, these included carbamazepine, valproate, ethosuximide, and the benzodiazepines. Since 1989, 13 more new drugs have been licensed and marketed and there are others in the pipeline. The International League Against Epilepsy and its leading figures have played an important role in these developments. In this period, too, there has been a rapid expansion in research and development within the pharmaceutical industry and a rise in the value of the antiepileptic drug market. In parallel, governmental regulation of pharmaceuticals has greatly increased. To what extent the overall prognosis of epilepsy has improved as a result of these activities is an interesting and perplexing question.",

We pay particular attention to the impact of the ILAE and its principal members on the understanding and awareness of status epilepticus.

    "46": "Antipsychotic drugs at noncataleptic doses selectively suppress conditioned avoidance response in rats. In our previous study, we had used a two-way active avoidance response paradigm to show that the antipsychotic-induced interoceptive state is one of the mechanisms underlying the avoidance-disruptive effect of antipsychotics. In this study, we sought to further examine this mechanism using a novel drug-drug conditioning procedure. We made use of the fact that both the typical neuroleptic haloperidol and the atypical neuroleptic olanzapine disrupt conditioned avoidance responding, whereas chlordiazepoxide (an anxiolytic) does not. We reasoned that if the antipsychotic interoceptive state is important in causing a disruption on avoidance responding (an index of antipsychotic efficacy), pairing chlordiazepoxide (a cueing drug conditional stimulus) with haloperidol or olanzapine (a cued drug unconditional stimulus) should engender chlordiazepoxide to exhibit this property and behave like an antipsychotic drug. Chlordiazepoxide exhibited an acquired antipsychotic-like property in disrupting avoidance responding after being repeatedly paired with haloperidol, but not with olanzapine. In contrast, it significantly attenuated the antiavoidance efficacy of olanzapine but not haloperidol after being repeatedly paired with these drugs. This study suggests that the haloperidol-induced interoceptive drug state is directly involved in its antiavoidance action, and chlordiazepoxide may attenuate the antiavoidance efficacy of antipsychotics (especially olanzapine). To the extent that the antiavoidance effect predicts clinical effects of antipsychotic treatment, this study suggests that the antipsychotic-induced interoceptive drug state may be an important behavioral mechanism mediating the clinical effects of antipsychotic treatments.", 
    "47": "Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic agent, appears to have rapid antidepressant effects at sub-anesthetic doses in clinically depressed patients. Although promising, these results need to be replicated in double-blind placebo-controlled studies, a strategy thwarted by the psychoactive effects of ketamine, which are obvious to both patients and clinicians. Alternatively, demonstrations of the psychotherapeutic effects of ketamine in animal models are also complicated by ketamine's side-effects on general activity, which have not been routinely measured or taken into account in experimental studies. In this study we found that ketamine decreased \"behavioral despair\" in the forced swim test, a widely used rats model of antidepressant drug action. This effect was not confounded by side-effects on general activity, and was comparable to that of a standard antidepressant drug, fluoxetine. Interestingly, ketamine also produced anxiolytic-like effects in the elevated-plus-maze. Importantly, the effective dose of ketamine in the plus-maze did not affect general locomotion measures, in either the plus-maze or in the open field test. While the selective N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK-801 also produced antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects, these were mostly confounded by changes in general activity. Finally, in a neurophysiological model of anxiolytic drug action, ketamine reduced the frequency of reticularly-activated theta oscillations in the hippocampus, similar to the proven anxiolytic drug diazepam. This particular neurophysiological signature is common to all known classes of anxiolytic drugs (i.e. benzodiazepines, 5-HT1A agonists, antidepressants) and provides strong converging evidence for the anxiolytic-like effects of ketamine. Further studies are needed to understand the underlying pharmacological mechanisms of ketamine's effects in these experiments, since it is not clear they were mimicked by the selective NMDA antagonist MK-801.",

The treatment decision must be adapted to the individual characteristics and needs of each patient. This article reviews the issues from the perspective of the initial management of acute psychosis as it is currently practised in Europe, and discusses the pragmatic implications for initial treatment decisions and the elaboration of a long-term treatment plan. Initially, administration of antipsychotics to control psychotic symptoms and benzodiazepines to control agitation represents the cornerstone of treatment. Oral medication is preferable to injectable forms wherever possible, and atypical antipsychotics are to be preferred over conventional agents because of their lower risk of extrapyramidal adverse effects, which are a major determinant of poor adherence to treatment. Whatever antipsychotic is chosen by the physician during the initial period, it is likely that it will need to be continued for many years, and it is thus important to take into account the long-term safety profile of the drug chosen, particularly in relation to extrapyramidal adverse effects, metabolic complications and quality of life. Building a therapeutic alliance with the patient and his/her family or carers is an important element that should be included in the initial management of psychosis. The long-term goal should be to minimize the risk of psychotic relapse through adequate treatment adherence.",

HSCT efficacy relies on replacing the intra- and extra-vascular hematopoietic cell compartments, including CNS microglia, with a cell population expressing the functional enzyme. Non-invasive and quantitative assessment of microglia activation and of its reduction upon HSCT might allow for evaluation of disease evolution and response to treatment in LSD. We here demonstrate that microglia activation can be quantified ex vivo and in vivo by PET using the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand PK11195 in two models of LSD. Furthermore, we show a differential PBR binding following microglia replacement by donor cells in mice undergoing HSCT. Our data indicates that PBR ligands constitute valuable tools for monitoring the evolution and the response to treatment of LSD with CNS involvement, and enable us to evaluate whether the turnover between endogenous and donor microglia following HSCT could be adequate enough to delay disease progression.",

An age dependent increase in specific [3H](R)-PK11195 binding to peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR)/translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO) was observed in the cortex of TASTPM mice compared to wild type mice, indicative of microglial activation. This was consistent with immunohistochemical data showing age-dependent increases in CD68 immunoreactivity co-localised with amyloid beta (Abeta) deposits. In 10 month old TASTPM mice, pioglitazone (20 mg/kg) and ciglitazone (50 mg/kg) significantly reduced [3H](R)-PK11195 and [3H]DPA-713 binding in cortex and hippocampus, indicative of reduced microglial activation. In AD brain, significant [3H](R)-PK11195 and [3H]DPA-713 binding was observed across all stages of the disease.

This is a rare phenomenon, but it can occur in any amputee with or without a history of previous phantom limb pain. We describe a case whose phantom pain of the amputated limb stump was twice induced by spinal anesthesia during two consecutive surgeries in the contralateral lower limb. It was revealed that midazolam was successful in treating this rare phantom limb pain after spinal anesthesia. Here, we discuss the management of phantom limb pain during spinal anesthesia and the anesthetic management for subsequent surgery in patients with previous spinal anesthesia-induced phantom limb pain.",

There was partial relief with propoxyphene, however, it was stopped because of side effects. The symptoms disappeared once olanzapine was switched to another antipsychotic medication. Only two prior published reports associate olanzapine usage with development of RLS. In one report, low-dose benzodiazepines and ropinirole were associated with resolution of RLS symptoms stating dopamine depletion as the likely etiology. In our patient, however, RLS due to olanzapine was refractory to the trial of both high-dose benzodiazepine and ropinirole. This suggests that RLS occurring as a side effect of olanzapine therapy may have additional causative mechanisms beyond simple dopamine depletion as postulated before. High-dose narcotics, if tolerated, may be an alternative in such refractory cases.", 
    "68": "Infectious and autoimmune pathogenic hypotheses of schizophrenia have been proposed, prompting searches for antibodies against viruses or brain structures, and for altered levels of immunoglobulins. Previous experiments have shown that allele frequencies of the Ig heavy chain 3' enhancer HS1,2*A are associated with several autoimmune diseases, suggesting a possible correlation between HS1,2 alleles and Ig production. To test this, we analyzed levels of serum Igs and HS1,2*A genotypes in two independent cohorts, one of 88 schizophrenic inpatients (24 women) and a second of 133 healthy subjects (59 women). Both groups were similar in the frequency of individuals with altered serum concentration of Ig classes and IgG subclasses (schizophrenia panel-80 percent; controls-68 percent). With the possible exception of a stabilizing effect of olanzapine, no psychopharmacological drug consumed during the month prior to serum sampling in the schizophrenia group significantly affected Ig levels. In both patient and control cohorts, an increased frequency of the HS1,2*2A allele corresponded to increased Ig plasma levels, while an increased frequency of the HS1,2*1A allele corresponded to decreased Ig plasma levels. EMSA analysis with nuclear extracts from human B cells showed that the transcription factor SP1 bound to the polymorphic region of both HS1,2*1A and HS1,2*2A while NF-kB bound only to the HS1,2*2A. We predict that differences in transcription factor binding sites in the two allelic variants of the 3' IgH enhancer HS1,2 may provide a mechanism by which differences in Ig expression are affected.", 
    "69": "The aim of this study was to localize oxytocin receptor (OTR) in the stomach and to investigate the effect of OT on gastric motility in rats. Western blot and immunohistochemistry methods were used to localize OTR in stomach. The motility of stomach was recorded in vivo (recording of the intragastric pressure), in vitro (recording of the contraction of muscle strips) and on isolated smooth muscle cells. OTR was expressed on cells of both circular and longitudinal muscle of stomach. Systemic administration of OT induced an early transient decrease and a subsequent increase on intragastric pressure. Devazepide (1 mg kg(-1), i.v.), a cholecystokinin-1 (CCK(1)) receptor antagonist, completely abolished the transient response but did not influence the subsequent one. OT (10(-9)-10(-6) mol L(-1)) dose-dependently increased the contraction of the muscle strips of gastric body, antrum, and pyloric sphincter, and decreased the average cell length of isolated smooth muscle cells. Tetrodotoxin and atropine did not influence the effect of OT on muscle strips. Pretreatment with atosiban, an OTR antagonist, inhibited the spontaneous contraction of muscle strips and abolished the excitatory effect of OT on the muscle strips and the isolated cells. These results suggest that the OTR is expressed on the smooth muscle of the stomach and mediates excitatory effect of OT on gastric motility.",

The inhibitory effect was not altered by preventing action potentials or by opening K(v)7 channels, but was reduced by PTX and omega-conotoxin GVIA. The inhibition remaining after PTX treatment was abolished by blockage of M(1) receptors or inhibition of phospholipase C. When [(3)H]-noradrenaline release was triggered independently of voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels (VACCs), OxoM failed to cause any inhibition. The inhibition of Ca(2+) currents by OxoM was also reduced by omega-conotoxin and PTX and was abolished by M(1) antagonism in PTX-treated neurons.",

The method successfully quantitated the CYP enzyme activities without serious side effects in patients. The ratios of metabolite to parent area under the concentration-time curve values were calculated over the 6-hour postdosage to reflect CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9 activities. The ratios of metabolite to parent plasma concentrations were calculated at 4-hour postdosage for CYP1A2 and at 4- or 6-hour postdose for CYP2C19, respectively. The plasma concentration of midazolam at 4 hours was also estimated as another phenotyping index for CYP3A4 activity. The simultaneous assay of all these analytes in a single matrix (plasma) will increase the feasibility of CYP phenotyping in patients.",

The purpose of the current study was to further understand the mechanisms underlying this desensitization response of serotonin 2A receptor signaling in vivo. We report that desensitization of serotonin 2A receptor stimulated-phospholipase C activity in rat frontal cortex induced by olanzapine is dependent on the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway. Olanzapine treatment for 7 days significantly increased the levels of the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS7) protein, RGS7 mRNA levels, and activation of JAK2 in rat frontal cortex. Pre-treatment with a JAK2 inhibitor AG490, significantly attenuated the olanzapine-induced reductions in serotonin 2A receptor-stimulated phospholipase C activity and prevented the olanzapine-induced increases in RGS7 mRNA and protein levels. In contrast, inhibition of the JAK-STAT pathway with AG490 did not reverse the olanzapine-induced desensitization of the serotonin 2A receptor pathway in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus mediating increases in plasma hormone levels. AG490 dose-dependently inhibited serotonin 2A receptor-stimulated oxytocin and corticosterone release. These results suggest that the olanzapine-induced increase in RGS7 expression is mediated by the activation of JAK-STAT and is necessary for olanzapine-induced desensitization of serotonin 2A receptor-stimulated phospholipase C activity in the frontal cortex but not serotonin 2A receptor-stimulated hormone release.",

However, to our knowledge, there are no reports relating to the population of patients with progressive disease, whose management is palliative. We would advise consideration be given to the possibility of OSAHS in a patient presenting with an oropharyngeal tumour and sleep disturbance and would also suggest caution in the prescription of benzodiazepines and other sedative medication to this group of patients.",

A single treatment of AV extract markedly increased the percentage time spent on the open arms of the EPM in two distinct concentration ranges of 22.5-30 and 100-125 mg/kg p.o., respectively, indicating a putative anxiolytic-like activity. Fractions showing anxiolytic effects in concentrations equal to 30 or 125 mg/kg of whole extract were antagonized using the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (3 mg/kg i.p.) or the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY-100635 (0.5 mg/kg i.p.). All active fractions in a concentration equal to 125 mg/kg were effectively blocked by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil, while the anxiolytic activities of fractions in the lower dose equivalent to 30 mg/kg of whole extract were inhibited by the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY-100635. Through further separation of AV fractions it was possible to isolate and characterize the flavonol kaempferol which showed an anxiolytic-like activity in concentrations from 0.02 to 1.0 mg/kg p.o. The anxiolytic activity of kaempferol was partially antagonized by concomitant administration of flumazenil, but not by WAY-100635. In conclusion, our study clearly demonstrates that AV extract possesses anxiolytic-like activity and that at least one of its flavonoids, kaempferol, can elicit the same kind of neuropharmacological activity.",

Our data here challenge this standard interpretation of the AMPH-CDP model. We show that the potentiating effects of AMPH-CDP are not explained by a pharmacokinetic interaction as both drugs have similar brain and plasma exposures whether administered alone or in combination. Of concern, however, we find that combining CDP (1-12 mg/kg) with AMPH (3 mg/kg) results in an inverted-U dose response in outbred CD-1 as well as inbred C57Bl/6N and 129S6 mice (peak hyperactivity at 3 mg/kg CDP+3 mg/kg AMPH). Such an inverted-U dose response complicates interpreting whether a reduction in hyperactivity produced by a mood stabilizer reflects a \"blockade\" or a \"potentiation\" of the mixture. In fact, we show that the prototypical mood stabilizer valproic acid augments the effects of CDP on hypolocomotion and anxiolytic-like behavior (increases punished crossings by Swiss-Webster mice in the four-plate test).

    "163": "The benzodiazepine, midazolam, is commonly used for sedation and anesthesia in the operating room and the intensive care unit where there is a risk of cerebral ischemia. We therefore examined its ability to reduce damage subsequent to cerebral ischemia. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to a high-dose midazolam group or a matched vehicle group and a lower dose of midazolam group or a matched vehicle group. The rats underwent 90 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion. In the midazolam groups, the first dose of midazolam (10 or 25 mg/kg) was given by a 10-minute intravenous infusion before ischemia; a second dose of (1/2) the initial dose (5 or 12.5 mg/kg) was given 1 hour after the onset of ischemia. In the vehicle groups, a similar volume of vehicle was given at the same time intervals. Infarct size, NeuN immunopositive cells in the ischemic penumbral and core regions, and neurologic outcome were determined 7 days after ischemia. Compared with vehicle-treated rats, the higher-dose midazolam (25 mg/kg)-treated rats had a smaller infarct size (93.9+/-63.5 mm vs. 152.0+/-53.7 mm, P<0.05), more NeuN immunopositive cells in the ischemic core region (206.7+/-211.3/mm vs. 40.0+/-66.3/mm, P<0.01), and better neurologic outcome (P<0.05). Midazolam at a lower dose (10 mg/kg) had no significant effects. Although midazolam generated dose-dependent hemolysis, this hemolysis was transient. Midazolam (25 mg/kg) caused a loss of the righting reflex in rats that lasted until 19.9+/-1.3 min after the injection, the anesthetic dose of midazolam in rats is approximately 100x greater than the anesthetic dose for humans. An anesthetic dose of midazolam in rats reduced neuronal damage and improved neurologic outcome 7 days after focal cerebral ischemia, however, it also caused transient hemolysis.", 
    "164": "Acetylcholine interacts with endothelial muscarinic receptors releasing nitric oxide and causing vasodilatation. To identify the receptor subtype responsible for acetylcholine-induced relaxation in canine uterine artery, the usual organ bath method for in vitro investigation on isolated blood vessels was applied. Using a range of muscarinic receptor antagonists such as atropine (nonselective), pirenzepine (M(1)-selective), methoctramine (M(2)-selective) and p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol (p-FHHSiD) (M(1)/M(3)) and determining pA2 value of those antagonists through Shild analysis, we aimed at establishing a precise receptor mechanism underlying acetylcholine-induced relaxation in isolated canine uterine artery. The relaxation of uterine arterial rings in response to acetylcholine in the presence or absence of selective muscarinic receptors antagonists was calculated using concentration response curves. Acetylcholine induced concentration-dependent and endothelium-dependent relaxation of arterial rings precontracted with phenylephrine (pEC(50) = 6.90 +/- 0.02). Muscarinic receptors antagonists atropine, pirenzepine, methoctramine and p-FHHSiD competitively antagonized the response to acetylcholine and obtained pA(2) values were 9.91 +/- 0.06, 6.60 +/- 0.04, 6.21 +/- 0.08 and 8.05 +/- 0.1, respectively. This study showed that acetylcholine induced endothelium-dependent relaxation of canine uterine artery by stimulation of muscarinic receptors localized on the endothelial cells. On the basis of differential antagonist affinity, we suggest that the muscarinic receptors involved in the acetylcholine-induced relaxation of canine uterine artery are predominantly of M(3) subtype.",

Mutations in the gene encoding choline acetyltransferase cause presynaptic defects. The missense mutation I336T has been identified in Turkish population, and most of the cases carrying this mutation present with exercise-induced fatigability and ptosis. Although apneic attacks occur in these cases during febrile illness in childhood, the number of reported respiratory distress episodes during infancy is scarce. Another important feature of these cases is that response to esterase inhibitors is satisfactory. We present a case of congenital myasthenic syndrome with I336T choline acetyltransferase mutation who presented with numerous attacks of respiratory distress in the infancy period. Interestingly, the patient had myopathic findings on electromyography and diazepam decreased severity of apneic attacks. There was also no improvement with esterase inhibitors.", 
    "166": "We have employed whole-cell and single-channel electrophysiology to examine the kinetic and pharmacological properties of GABA-A receptors consisting of gamma2L-beta2-alpha1 and beta2-alpha1 subunit concatemeric constructs expressed in human embryonic kidney cells. Concatemeric receptors activated by GABA exhibited the same single-channel conductance, channel opening rate constant, and basic open- and closed-time properties as receptors containing free subunits. However, the whole-cell GABA dose-response and the single-channel effective opening rate curves were shifted to higher GABA concentrations, suggesting that the concatemeric receptors have a lower affinity to GABA. Pharmacological tests demonstrated that the concatemeric receptors were potentiated by pentobarbital, diazepam, and the neurosteroid (3alpha,5alpha)-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one (3alpha5alphaP), and were insensitive to Zn(2+). Selective introduction of the alpha1Q241L mutation, previously shown to abolish alpha1beta2gamma2L channel potentiation by neurosteroids, into one of the two concatemeric constructs had a relatively small effect on receptor activation by GABA or macroscopic potentiation by the neurosteroid 3alpha5alphaP. Single-channel measurements showed that the kinetic mechanism of action of the steroid is unchanged when the mutation is introduced to the gamma2L-beta2-alpha1 concatemer. We infer that a single wild-type alpha subunit is capable of mediating the full set of kinetic effects in the presence of steroids. Introduction of the alpha1Q241W mutation, previously shown to mimic the effect of the steroid on alpha1beta2gamma2L channels, selectively into either concatemeric construct altered the mode of activity elicited by P4S, but the presence of mutations in both alpha subunits was required to affect open-time distributions. The data indicate that the alpha1Q241W mutation acts as a partial steroid modulator.",

    "184": "The transfer of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane is the rate-limiting step in hormone-induced steroid formation. To ensure that this step is achieved efficiently, free cholesterol must accumulate in excess at the outer mitochondrial membrane and then be transferred to the inner membrane. This is accomplished through a series of steps that involve various intracellular organelles, including lysosomes and lipid droplets, and proteins such as the translocator protein (18 kDa, TSPO) and steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) proteins. TSPO, previously known as the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, is a high-affinity drug- and cholesterol-binding mitochondrial protein. StAR is a hormone-induced mitochondria-targeted protein that has been shown to initiate cholesterol transfer into mitochondria. Through the assistance of proteins such as the cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit Ialpha (PKA-RIalpha) and the PKA-RIalpha- and TSPO-associated acyl-coenzyme A binding domain containing 3 (ACBD3) protein, PAP7, cholesterol is transferred to and docked at the outer mitochondrial membrane. The TSPO-dependent import of StAR into mitochondria, and the association of TSPO with the outer/inner mitochondrial membrane contact sites, drives the intramitochondrial cholesterol transfer and subsequent steroid formation. The focus of this review is on (i) the intracellular pathways and protein-protein interactions involved in cholesterol transport and steroid biosynthesis and (ii) the roles and interactions of these proteins in endocrine pathologies and neurological diseases where steroid synthesis plays a critical role.", 
    "185": "Weight gain is an established side effect of atypical antipsychotics in patients with severe mental illness (SMI). Previous studies have shown positive effects of nutritional interventions in weight loss. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a nutritional intervention on the body weight and body composition of patients with SMI taking olanzapine in Greece.", 
    "186": "Eighty-two patients with SMI treated with olanzapine (22 men, 60 women) and 58 healthy controls (12 men, 46 women) were followed for 3 mo. All patients with SMI were obese, with an average body mass index of 33.12 +/- 0.74 kg/m(2) and body weight of 94.61 +/- 2.50 kg. A nutritional program was designed for each participant based on anthropometric characteristics, health profile, and dietary needs. Pre- and postintervention anthropometric and body composition measurements were performed.", 
    "187": "Significant weight loss and fat loss were found in the healthy controls and patients with SMI from baseline to 3 mo (P < 0.05). However, the patients with SMI had a less significant decrease in waist circumference (P < 0.05) compared with healthy controls. The healthy male controls and male patients with SMI demonstrated greater decreases in body weight and waist circumference compared with female participants (P < 0.05).", 
    "188": "Patients with SMI appear to respond effectively to a nutritional program demonstrating significant decreases in body weight and body composition despite the use of olanzapine. Because gender differences may exist in weight loss, it is possible that gender should be taken into account for a more appropriate treatment of obesity in this population.", 
    "189": "The prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is becoming a serious public health problem. The use of atypical antipsychotics has been associated with disruption of the glucose metabolism and therefore with causing DM. The underlying mechanisms are unknown, but knowledge of the differences between the pharmacological features of various antipsychotics combined with their diabetogenic profile might help us to understand those mechanisms. This article describes how the binding of various essential receptors or transporters in essential body tissues, adipose tissue, pancreatic tissue and liver and skeletal muscle tissue can cause disruption of the glucose metabolism. With such knowledge in mind one can try to explain the differences between the diabetogenic propensities of various antipsychotics. It is well known that clozapine and olanzapine cause weight gain and DM, whereas aripiprazole and ziprasidone have much less disruptive clinical profiles. The most significant risk factor for adiposity seems to be strong blocking of histaminergic receptors. An agonistic activity on serotonergic-1a receptors, with a very low affinity for muscarinergic-3 receptors, might protect against the development of DM. More data will become available which may help to solve the puzzle.",

    "191": "EEGs of 700 patients aged over 70 years, recorded between January 2006 and March 2007, were reviewed for anomalies consistent with IGE. We then examined the clinical history of patients with these anomalies.", 
    "192": "A persistent IGE was identified in four female patients (mean age: 79 years); in two cases it was a juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) and in two an epilepsy with grand mal seizures. Seizures in three patients had begun in childhood or adolescence and in one at 40 years. Before hospitalization, few or no seizures were reported and IGE had not been diagnosed. IGE was revealed in each patient by a relatively severe event: an absence status (AS), subcontinuous myoclonic seizures or repeated convulsive generalised seizures (CGS). These events were not situation-related but in one patient the relapse of simple convulsive seizures, may have been related to the withdrawal of anti-epileptic drugs (AED) several months previously. EEG records showed generalised spikes or polyspikes and waves organised in a status epilepticus or in interictal rhythmic discharges. In one case they were evident only from a 24 hours recording. Clonazepam injection was used to suppress the AS episode and the subintrant myoclonia. After the AS, interictal generalised epileptic discharges persisted. Two of the four patients had familial history of epilepsy or febrile seizures but in no case was an epileptogenic lesion evident in brain CT scan or MRI. Clinical exams and biologic parameters were normal. All of the patients had worked and were married with children. Appropriate therapies were followed after the diagnosis of IGE. One patient with JME had been treated by Valproate which was discontinued by the general practitioner because of lethargy and replaced by Carbamazepine; seizures were aggravated under both Carbamazepine and then Lamotrigine and until the patient became seizure-free on Levetiracetam. The antiepiletic treatment was also modified in a second patient, while the two others responded well to Valproate.", 
    "193": "IGE can exacerbate in the elderly, as different types of seizures including AS, subintrant myoclonia or repeated CGS. Our data suggest persistent IGE are quite frequent in an aged population and may be underestimated due to difficulties in diagnosis. Correctly diagnosed, adjustment of AED may offer substantial clinical improvements in IGE of the elderly.", 
    "194": "The alpha4 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor (GABAR) is capable of rapid plasticity, increased by chronic exposure to positive GABA modulators, such as the neurosteroid 3alpha-OH-5alpha[beta]-pregnan-20-one (THP). Here, we show that 48 h exposure of differentiated neuroblastoma cells (IMR-32) to 100 nM THP increases alpha4 expression, without changing the current density or the concentration-response curve. Increased expression of alpha4-containing GABAR was verified by a relative insensitivity of GABA (EC(20))-gated current to modulation by the benzodiazepine (BZ) lorazepam (0.01-100 microM), and potentiation of current by flumazenil and RO15-4513, characteristic of alpha4betagamma2 pharmacology. In contrast to THP, compounds which decrease GABA-gated current, such as the BZ inverse agonist DMCM, the GABAR antagonist gabazine and the open channel blocker penicillin, decreased alpha4 expression after a 48 h exposure, without changing BZ responsiveness. However, pentobarbital, another positive GABA modulator, increased alpha4 expression, while the BZ antagonist flumazenil had no effect. In order to test whether changes in current were responsible for increased alpha4 expression, decreases in the Cl(-) driving force were produced by chronic exposure to the NKCC1 blocker bumetanide (10 microM). When applied under these conditions of reduced GABA-gated current, THP failed to increase alpha4 expression. The results of this study suggest that alpha4 expression is correlated with changes in GABA-gated current, rather than simply through ligand-receptor interactions. These findings have relevance for GABAR subunit plasticity produced by fluctuations in endogenous steroids across the menstrual cycle, when altered BZ sensitivity is reported.",

    "199": "The aim of our work is to determine the total number, age, gender of the patients with the symptomatic epileptic seizures associated with brain tumours, tumour location, clinical signs and characteristics of epileptic seizures. We have analyzed medical documentation of the patients with brain tumours hospitalized at the Department of Neurology, University of Sarajevo Clinics Centre. This study is retrospective and includes time period from 1st January 2000 until 31st December 2005. During the observed period at the Department of Neurology in Sarajevo there were in total 9753 hospitalized patients, from which 101 (1,1%) patients with the brain tumour diagnosis. Average patient's age was 62,60 +/- 1,28 years. In one third of the patients (32%) were recorded epileptic seizures, without significant difference between genders. In case of symptomatic epilepsy, significantly more frequent locations of tumours were: in several lobes (28%), parietal lobe (25%), as well as frontal and temporal lobe (18,8% each), while there were no changes in cerebellum and brain stem (chi2 =7,174, p<0,05). The most prominent signs of illness in our sample were hemiparesis with the cranial nerves lesion (56,3%), speech problems (25%). Normal neurologic findings were significantly more frequent among patients with the symptomatic epilepsy (chi2 =6,349, p<0,05). The most often was a single seizure (59%), in 38% of cases there were recorded series of seizures, and only 3% of patients had status epilepticus. In relation to the type of seizures, the most often are simple partial seizures with or without secondary generalization (66%), than generalized convulsive (31%), and the rarest one are complex partial seizures (3%). Symptomatic epilepsy in case of brain tumours occurs in one third of patients, at older age, and in both genders. The lesion usually affects several lobes and cause simple partial seizures with or without secondary generalization. The most often clinical signs in case of all brain tumours are cranial nerves lesion and hemiparesis, while the normal neurologic findings are significantly dominant in the group of patients with the epileptic seizures.",

The drugs studied were the prescription drugs with potential for abuse; diazepam, carisoprodol and codeine combinations.

Among the few patients who used many physicians for prescription of drugs, the phenomenon was much more frequent for users of addictive drugs than for users of the non-addictive drugs. The study suggests that prescription drug shopping may be an indicator of a drug abuse potential.", 
    "212": "There is evidence that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Indirect biochemical alterations of ROS formation have been shown for patients treated with antipsychotics as well as for untreated patients. Only one study measured directly the ROS formation after treatment with antipsychotics by using electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The aim of the present examination was to demonstrate the effects of haloperidol, clozapine and olanzapine in concentrations of 18, 90 and 180 \u03bcg/mL on the formation of ROS in the whole blood of rats by using electron spin resonance spectroscopy after incubation for 30 min. To test the protective capacity of vitamin C we incubated the highest concentration of each drug with vitamin C (1 mM). Under all treatment conditions, olanzapine led to a significantly higher formation of ROS compared with control conditions, whereas in the cases of haloperidol and clozapine the two higher concentrations induced a significantly enhanced formation of ROS. Vitamin C reduced the ROS production of all drugs tested and for haloperidol and clozapine the level of significance was reached. Our study demonstrated that antipsychotics induce the formation of ROS in the whole blood of rats, which can be reduced by the application of vitamin C.",

Secondary outcomes included psychiatric symptoms including hallucinations, neuropsychological status, quality of life, falls, and cost of treatment. Outcome measures were assessed before and directly after 4 months of intervention, and at 4 months of follow-up. Hierarchical linear models were used to test treatment and time effects.

During the years 2003-2007 alcohol, pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs were analyzed in 1167 blood samples from cases of suspected and drugged drivers. In accordance with the findings of the EU-project Rosita, a wide variety of illicit drugs and medications could be found in blood samples of the drivers where cannabis (50%), opiates (20%), amphetamines (18%), cocaine (15%) and benzodiazepines (20%) were those with the highest prevalence. To enable police and medical officers to identify drivers under the influence of cannabis, a newly developed urinary road-site-test system, Check 24 (Protzek GmbH, Germany), with two different cut-off values for THCCOOH-glucuronide was used. So far, it was not possible to draw any conclusions from a cannabinoid positive urine sample to the actual influence of a driver due to the previous consumption of cannabis. Using this test a better differentiation between recent and temporal earlier consumption was possible. In addition to using the Check 24 system the technology of pupillography (AMTech GmbH, Germany) was applied in cases of drugged driving. For the first time the authors were able to predict the presence of at least one central nervous active substance in the blood of a drugged driver.", 
    "218": "Oral fluid field tests are designed to provide preliminary results with a high grade of reliability in order to meet analytical and forensic standards. Some test systems additionally offer the possibility of an independent confirmatory analysis of a test sample. The pre-analytical stability of 11 frequently abused benzodiazepines on an oral fluid collecting device (Dr\u00e4ger DCD 5000) has been investigated. The collection device was designed to complement a special mobile testing system (Dr\u00e4ger DrugTest 5000) to be sent to a laboratory for further confirmatory analysis. Blank oral fluid pool was spiked with a mixture of eleven frequently abused benzodiazepines and given onto a collection device. To simulate possible sample shipping, the collection devices were stored in the dark up to 14 days at ambient temperature in a plastic tube. The collection device was simultaneously stored without further treatment after oral fluid collection ('native') and with addition of 950muL of methanol, respectively. At different storage intervals repeat determination was carried out for every sample using a modified version of our standard LC-MS/MS method for the detection of benzodiazepines in serum. Different recoveries of benzodiazepines due to degradation and/or adsorption to the collection device during the 14 days of 'native' storage were found. Major loss of analytes was found for benzodiazepines containing a nitro-group such as flunitrazepam and clonazepam. This could be prevented almost completely by methanolic storage of the collection device after sampling. Therefore, we recommend the centrifugation of the collection device and separation from the polymer unit prior to sample shipping. If this should not be possible, addition of methanol immediately after sample collection can be used to avoid degradation of benzodiazepines during shipment.", 
    "219": "The majority of symptoms and signs of acute diazepam poisoning are the consequence of its sedative effect on the CNS affecting selectively poli-synaptic routes by stimulating inhibitory action of GABA. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of combined application of theophylline and flumazenil on sedation and impaired motor function activity in acute diazepam poisoning in rats.", 
    "220": "Male Wistar rats were divided in four main groups and treated as follows: group I--with increasing doses of diazepam in order to produce the highest level of sedation and motor activity impairment; group II--diazepam + different doses of flumazenil; group III--diazepam + different doses of theophylline; group IV--diazepam + combined application of theophylline and flumazenil. Concentrations of diazepam and its metabolites were measured with LC-MS. The experiment was performed on a commercial apparatus for spontaneous motor-activity registration (LKB-Farad, Sweden). Assessment of diazepam-induced neurotoxic effects and effects after theophylline and flumazenil application was performed with rotarod test on a commercial apparatus (Automatic treadmill for rats, Ugo Basile, Italy).", 
    "221": "Diazepam in doses of 10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg produced long-time and reproducible pharmacodynamic effects. Single application of flumazenil or theophylline antagonized effects of diazepam, but not completely. Combined application of flumazenile and theophylline resulted in best effects on diazepam-induced impairment of motoric activity and sedation. As a result of theopylline application there was better elimination of diazepam and its metabolites.", 
    "222": "Combined application of flumazenil and theophylline resulted in the best antidotal effects in the treatment of diazepam poisoned rats. These effects are a result of different mechanisms of their action, longer half-life of theophylline in relation to that of flumezenil and presumably the diuretic effect of theophylline.", 
    "223": "Flunitrazepam has been reported to trigger cases of extreme violence in man and recently it was shown to heighten aggression in experimental rats. The underlying mechanisms may involve disinhibited/impulsive behavior. Here, tolerance developed to the behavioral disinhibiting effect of flunitrazepam in Vogel's drinking conflict model, both in rats treated with flunitrazepam (0.32 mg/kg/day) for three weeks, as well as in rats treated for six weeks (0.32 mg/kg/day three weeks + 0.56 mg/kg/day three weeks). The results suggest that behavioral disinhibition is of limited importance in the mechanisms underlying the pro-aggressive effect of chronic flunitrazepam administration.", 
    "224": "The main olfactory bulb (MOB) receives a rich noradrenergic innervation from the pontine nucleus locus coeruleus (LC). Previous studies indicate that norepinephrine (NE) modulates the strength of GABAergic inhibition in MOB. However, the nature of this modulation and the NE receptors involved remain controversial. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of NE receptor subtypes in modulating the GABAergic inhibition of mitral cells using patch-clamp electrophysiology in rat MOB slices. NE concentration dependently and bi-directionally modulated GABA(A) receptor-mediated spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs/mIPSCs) recorded in mitral cells. Low doses of NE suppressed sIPSCs and mIPSCs because of activation of alpha2 receptors. Intermediate concentrations of NE increased sIPSCs and mIPSCs primarily because of activation of alpha1 receptors. In contrast, activation of beta receptors increased sIPSCs but not mIPSCs. These results indicate that NE release regulates the strength of GABAergic inhibition of mitral cells depending on the NE receptor subtype activated. Functionally, the differing affinity of noradrenergic receptor subtypes seems to allow for dynamic modulation of GABAergic inhibition in MOB as function of the extracellular NE concentration, which in turn, is regulated by behavioral state.",

    "227": "Toxicological testing identified 52 cases of drug-facilitated crimes, primarily for theft and sexual abuse (including rape). The psychoactive products were most often incorporated in drinks, half of them alcoholic beverages. Benzodiazepines accounted for 77% of the cases. Other substances, found more rarely, included antihistamines, neuroleptics, and GHB.", 
    "228": "Appropriate samples must be taken from victims rapidly to enable toxicological analysis. Chromatographic analysis must supplement immunological analysis, which is not sufficiently specific or sensitive. The collection of this information must continue in order to quantify the phenomenon and monitor the emergence of new products.", 
    "229": "Increasing duration of generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus increases the risk of neuronal damage and systemic complications. It is also a recognized contributing factor to drug resistance. The most indispensable quality an anticonvulsive medication is expected to have in this situation is therefore a rapid therapeutic effect, achieved without severe depressive, neurological, cardiovascular or respiratory side effects. The anticonvulsive strategy proposed here takes into account these prerequisites, as well as previously published research findings which remain limited on a number of aspects. The duration of the convulsions before medication must be taken into account when deciding on the initial treatment. If this is less than 30 min, a single drug regimen with benzodiazepine would be appropriate and sufficient initially. If lorazepam, which is unavailable in France, cannot be used, the pharmacokinetically similar clonazepam should be preferred. Beyond 30 min, a combination of benzodiazepine and an anticonvulsive with long-lasting effects -phenobarbital or fosphenytoin- is indicated. The choice between these two latter drugs depends on their respective contraindications and the circumstances surrounding the occurrence of the status epilepticus. The persistence of seizures beyond 20 min after beginning the phenobarbital infusion or 30 min after starting fosphenytoin signals a failure of the initial treatment and requires the immediate introduction of a second line of therapy. This may be an anticonvulsive with long-lasting effects providing the convulsions have been present for less than an hour, there is no suspicion of an acute cerebral lesion and there is no associated systemic factor of cerebral aggression. If not, the employment of anesthetic medication is immediately required.", 
    "230": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of the inclusion of a water-insoluble drug (diazepam, DZ) into solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), which offer combined advantages of rapid onset and prolonged release of the drug. This work also describes a new approach to prepare suppositories containing DZ-loaded SLN dispersions, as potential drug carrier for the rectal route. Modified high-shear homogenization and ultrasound techniques were employed to prepare SLNs. The effect of incorporation of different concentrations of Compritol ATO 888 or Imwitor 900K and Poloxamer 188 or Tween 80 was investigated. Results showed that varying the type or concentration of lipid matrix or surfactant had a noticeable influence on the entrapment efficiencies, particle size, and release profiles of prepared SLNs. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction measurements showed that the majority of SLNs possessed less ordered arrangements of crystals than the corresponding bulk lipids, which was favorable for increasing the drug loading capacity. Transmission electron microscopy and laser diffractometry studies revealed that the prepared nanoparticles were round and homogeneous and 60% of the formulations were less than 500 nm. Additionally, SLN formulations showed significant (P < 0.05) prolonged release than DZ solution. The subsequent step encompassed the preparation and evaluation of SLN-based suppositories utilizing SLN formulations that illustrated optimal release profiles. The in vitro release of DZ from the suppositories prepared using DZ-loaded SLN dispersions (equivalent to 2 mg DZ) was significantly (P < 0.05) extended compared to suppositories containing 2 mg DZ free drug.",

These BDZs have selective efficacy for alpha2beta3gamma2 and alpha3beta3gamma2 GABA(A)-receptors. Significant anticonvulsant activity with little or no motor impairment and therapeutic indexes (TI) of 2.8-44 (mice, ip) were observed for compounds 2-4 in the subcutaneous metrazole seizure (scMET) test. In rats, orally (po) the TI was >5 to 105. These compounds represent novel leads in the search for anticonvulsants devoid of sedative, ataxic, and amnestic side effects.", 
    "236": "Shoaling can be considered a simple form of affective behavior displayed by social fish in which a single fish exhibits an tendency to approach others. In the present study, we adopted a dual approach to investigate shoaling behavior in the medaka fish (Oryzias latipes): a behavioral pharmacological approach to assess mirror approaching behavior and an immunohistochemical approach to examine the neurotransmitter distribution in the medaka telencephalon. In order to gain an insight into shoaling activity, we examined the pharmacological effects of the positive allosteric modulator of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) anti-anxiety drug, diazepam, and chlorpromazine, a predominantly dopaminergic antagonist on mirror approaching behavior and, in particular, mirror approaching time (MAT; a tendency to shoal) and swimming distance (SWD). Diazepam dose-dependently suppressed MAT, but had no effect on SWD. Conversely, chlorpromazine suppressed SWD without having effects on MAT. The present study demonstrates for the first time that an anti-anxiety drug selectively modifies shoaling behavior in fish. Although the mechanism of this modification remains to be fully identified, immunohistochemical analysis suggests that a positive allosteric modulator of GABA acts on two distinct telencephalic regions. Mirror approaching behavior therefore revealed a close relationship with the action of the GABA-nergic system and not the dopaminergic system in the medaka telencephalon.", 
    "237": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in serious and disabling neuropsychiatric disorders.", 
    "238": "The authors report a case of a 51-year old male, admitted to the psychiatric ward for acute psychosis and suicidal ideation, probably associated with TBI. After a temporal head trauma he initiated auditory/verbal hallucinations and subsequently developed paranoid delusions. The electroencephalography showed slow bilateral temporal activity and the neuropsychological testing showed several impairments. The patient improved with olanzapine at a dosage of 20 mg daily.", 
    "239": "This case shows the difficulty of differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and psychotic disorder due to traumatic brain injury.", 
    "240": "The authors conducted a revision of literature about the diagnosis, epidemiology, clinical aspects, laboratory and structural investigations and the treatment of this condition. Based on this revision work, the authors sketch some recommendations about the work-up that should be done when faced with this diagnostic hypothesis.", 
    "241": "Tolerance and dependence can develop during chronic benzodiazepine treatment; however, cross tolerance and cross dependence to positive modulators acting at other sites on GABA(A) receptors might not occur.", 
    "242": "The current study evaluated changes in sensitivity to positive GABA(A) modulators during chronic treatment with the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam to determine whether cross tolerance and cross dependence varied as a function of site of action.", 
    "243": "Eight rats responded under a fixed ratio 20 schedule of food presentation. Dose-effect curves were determined before, during and after chronic treatment with one or two daily injections of 1 mg/kg of flunitrazepam.", 
    "244": "Prior to chronic treatment, benzodiazepines (flunitrazepam, midazolam), a barbiturate (pentobarbital), a neuroactive steroid (pregnanolone), and drugs with primary mechanisms of action at receptors other than GABA(A) receptors (morphine, ketamine) dose-dependently decreased responding. Twice daily treatment with flunitrazepam produced 9.5- and 23-fold shifts to the right in the flunitrazepam and midazolam dose-effect curves, respectively. In contrast, dose-effect curves for other drugs either were not changed or were shifted less than or equal to fourfold to the right.", 
    "245": "Decreased sensitivity to benzodiazepines and not to a barbiturate or a neuroactive steroid during chronic flunitrazepam treatment indicates that tolerance and cross tolerance developed only to benzodiazepines. Despite similar acute behavioral effects among positive GABA(A) modulators, the differential development of cross tolerance suggests that adaptations at GABA(A) receptors produced by chronic benzodiazepine treatment differentially affect positive modulators depending on their site of action; such differences might be exploited to benefit patients treated daily with positive GABA(A) modulators.", 
    "246": "Continuous sedation, contrary to euthanasia, has been increasingly accepted among medical professionals worldwide. In the Netherlands, a national guideline for continuous palliative sedation has been developed to contribute to the quality of palliative sedation practice. The present follow-up study investigated whether the practice of continuous sedation has changed after the introduction of this guideline.", 
    "247": "This study compared the practice of continuous sedation before and after the introduction of the guideline on December 7, 2005. A baseline measurement was performed between February 1, 2003, and May 1, 2005, with an enrollment of 492 physicians (medical specialists, general practitioners, and nursing home physicians). From January 1 to June 30, 2007, after the introduction of a national guideline for palliative sedation, a follow-up study was performed with the respondents of the baseline study. Physicians were asked to report on their last case of deep and continuous sedation in the past 12 months.", 
    "248": "This study reports the results of the follow-up study and compares them to the results of the baseline study. The response rate was 69.3% (n = 341). Of these physicians, 160 reported a last case of continuous sedation in both the baseline and the follow-up studies. Physicians reported a significant increase in patient involvement in decision making, from 72.3% to 82.2%. Pain remained the most often reported reason to start sedation, whereas exhaustion as a reason for sedation increased. The use of benzodiazepines increased from 69.9% to 90.4%. In the first and second measurements, symptom-directed treatment during sedation was applied in 56% to 58% of the cases. In the second period, there was more often an explicit decision to not give artificial hydration during sedation (78.8% vs 56.3%). Of the physicians, 34.2% were convinced that sedation shortened the life of the patient because of dehydration.", 
    "249": "After the introduction of the guideline, physicians reported that changes in palliative sedation practice conform to the recommendations of this guideline. For example, benzodiazepines were used for sedation more frequently than before and patient involvement in the decision-making process improved. Possible effects of dehydration and the large variation in symptom-directed treatment during sedation deserve careful attention.", 
    "250": "Exposure therapy is known to be an effective treatment for anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, exposure is not used as much as it should be, and instead patients are often given supportive medications such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines, which may even interfere with the extinction learning that is the aim of treatment. Given that randomized controlled trials are now investigating a few doses of +/-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') in combination with psychotherapy for treatment-resistant anxiety disorders, we would like to suggest the following three mechanisms for this potentially important new approach: 1) MDMA increases oxytocin levels, which may strengthen the therapeutic alliance; 2) MDMA increases ventromedial prefrontal activity and decreases amygdala activity, which may improve emotional regulation and decrease avoidance and 3) MDMA increases norepinephrine release and circulating cortisol levels, which may facilitate emotional engagement and enhance extinction of learned fear associations. Thus, MDMA has a combination of pharmacological effects that, in a therapeutic setting, could provide a balance of activating emotions while feeling safe and in control, as described in case reports of MDMA-augmented psychotherapy. Further clinical and preclinical studies of the therapeutic value of MDMA are indicated.", 
    "251": "Electrographic seizures are a feature of organophosphate anticholinesterase intoxication. Clinical studies of pesticide poisonings suggest that seizures are more common in children than in adults. Since flaccid paralysis, a characteristic sign of organophosphate poisoning, can mask convulsions, the most reliable indicator of seizures is the electroencephalogram, but this has not been widely used in clinical studies. Seizures can rapidly progress to status epilepticus, contributing to mortality and, in survivors, to neuronal damage and neurological impairment. Anticonvulsant drugs can significantly reduce the lethal and toxic effects of these compounds. A benzodiazepine, usually diazepam, is the treatment currently indicated for control of seizures. Animal studies have indicated that the early phase of seizure activity (0-5 min after seizure onset) is purely cholinergic, predominantly involving muscarinic mechanisms. Seizure activity subsequently progresses through mixed cholinergic and noncholinergic modulation (5-40 min) into a final noncholinergic phase. Neuropathology caused by seizures is most likely associated with glutamatergic excitotoxicity. Future prospects for improved treatments include new benzodiazepines, glutamate receptor antagonists, antimuscarinics with additional antiglutamatergic activity and adenosine receptor antagonists.", 
    "252": "Certain women experience negative mood symptoms as a result of progesterone during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, progestagens in hormonal contraceptives, or the addition of progesterone or progestagens in sequential hormone therapy (HT). This phenomenon is believed to be mediated via the action of the progesterone metabolites on the GABA(A) system, which is the major inhibitory system in the mammalian CNS. The positive modulators of the GABA(A) receptor include allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, both neuroactive metabolites of progesterone, as well as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol. Studies on the effect of GABA(A) receptor modulators have shown contradictory results; although human and animal studies have revealed beneficial properties such as anaesthesia, sedation, anticonvulsant effects, and anxiolytic effects, recent reports have also indicated adverse effects such as anxiety, irritability, and aggression. It has actually been suggested that several GABA(A) receptor modulators, including allopregnanolone, have biphasic effects, in that low concentrations increase an adverse, anxiogenic effect whereas higher concentrations decrease this effect and show beneficial, calming properties. The allopregnanolone increase during the luteal phase in fertile women, as well as during the addition of progesterone in HT, has been shown to induce adverse mood in women. The severity of these mood symptoms is related to the allopregnanolone serum concentrations in a manner similar to an inverted U-shaped curve. Negative mood symptoms occur when the serum concentration of allopregnanolone is similar to endogenous luteal phase levels, while low and high concentrations have less effect on mood. It has also been shown that progesterone/allopregnanolone treatment in women increases the activity in the amygdala (as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging) in a similar way to the changes seen during anxiety reactions. However, it is evident that only certain women experience adverse mood during progesterone or GABA(A) receptor modulator treatments. Women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) have severe luteal phase related symptoms; in this phase, they show changes in GABA(A) receptor sensitivity and GABA concentrations that are related to the severity of the condition. These findings suggest that negative mood symptoms in women with PMDD are caused by the paradoxical effect of allopregnanolone mediated via the GABA(A) receptor.", 
    "253": "Progesterone and progestagens induce negative mood, most probably via their GABA(A) receptor active metabolites. In postmenopausal women treated with progesterone and animals treated with allopregnanolone, there is a bimodal association between serum allopregnanolone concentration and adverse mood, resembling an inverted U-shaped curve. In humans, the maximal effective concentration of allopregnanolone for producing negative mood is within the range of physiological luteal phase serum concentrations.", 
    "254": "Although use of sedation protocols and daily sedation interruption (DSI) improve outcome, their current use and barriers affecting their use are unclear.", 
    "255": "We designed a multidisciplinary, Web-based survey to determine current use of sedation protocols and DSI and the perceived barriers to each, and administered it to members of the Society of Critical Care Medicine.", 
    "256": "The 904 responders were physicians (60%), nurses (14%), or pharmacists (12%); 45% worked in a university hospital. Of 64% having a sedation protocol, 78% used it for >or=50% of ventilated patients. Reasons for lack of protocol use included no physician order (35%), lack of nursing support (11%), and a fear of oversedation (7%). Daily sedation interruption was used by only 40%. Barriers to DSI included lack of nursing acceptance (22%), concern about risk of patient-initiated device removal (19%), and inducement of either respiratory compromise (26%) or patient discomfort (13%). Clinicians who prefer propofol were more likely to use DSI than those who prefer benzodiazepines (55% vs 40, P < .0001).", 
    "257": "Current intensive care unit sedation practices are heterogeneous, and the barriers preventing the use of both sedation protocols and DSI are numerous. These barriers should be addressed on an institutional basis to boost the use of these evidence-based practices."
