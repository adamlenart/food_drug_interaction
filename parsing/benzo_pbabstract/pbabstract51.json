Here we investigate the mechanism of inhibition of the GluA1 channel opening and the site of inhibition by GYKI 52466 and its N-3 methyl-carbamoyl derivative, which we term as BDZ-f. GluA1 is a key AMPA receptor subunit involved in the brain function. Excessive activity and elevated expression of GluA1, however, has been implicated in a number of neurological disorders. Using a laser-pulse photolysis technique, which provides \u223c60 \u03bcs resolution, we measured the effect of these inhibitors on the rate of GluA1 channel opening and the amplitude of the glutamate-induced whole-cell current. We found that both compounds inhibit GluA1 channel noncompetitively. Addition of an N-3 methyl-carbamoyl group to the diazepine ring with the azomethine feature (i.e., GYKI 52466) improves the potency of the resulting compound or BDZ-f without changing the site of binding. This site, which we previously termed as the \"M\" site on the GluA2 AMPA receptor subunit, therefore favorably accommodates an N-3 acylating group. On the basis of the magnitude of the inhibition constants for the same inhibitors but different receptors, the \"M\" sites on GluA1 and GuA2 are different. Overall, the \"M\" site or the binding environment on GluA2 accommodates the same compounds better, or the same inhibitors show stronger potency on GluA2, as we have reported previously [ Wang et al. Biochemistry ( 2011 ) 50 , 7284 - 7293 ]. However, acylating the N-3 position to occupy the N-3 side pocket of the \"M\" site can significantly narrow the difference and improve the potency of a resulting compound on GluA1.",

    "6": "The hippocampal formation receives strong cholinergic input from the septal/diagonal band complex. Although the functional effects of cholinergic activation have been extensively studied in pyramidal neurons within the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, less is known about the role of cholinergic receptors on dentate gyrus neurons. Using intracellular recordings from rat dentate hilar neurons, we find that activation of m1-type muscarinic receptors selectively increases the excitability of glutamatergic mossy cells but not of hilar interneurons. Following brief stimuli, cholinergic modulation reveals a latent afterdepolarization response in mossy cells that can extend the duration of stimulus-evoked depolarization by >100 msec. Depolarizing stimuli also could trigger persistent firing in mossy cells exposed to carbachol or an m1 receptor agonist. Evoked IPSPs attenuated the ADP response in mossy cells. The functional effect of IPSPs was amplified during ADP responses triggered in the presence of cholinergic receptor agonists but not during slowly decaying simulated ADPs, suggesting that modulation of ADP responses by IPSPs arises from destabilization of the intrinsic currents underlying the ADP. Evoked IPSPs also could halt persistent firing triggered by depolarizing stimuli. These results show that through intrinsic properties modulated by muscarinic receptors, mossy cells can prolong depolarizing responses to excitatory input and extend the time window where multiple synaptic inputs can summate. By actively regulating the intrinsic response to synaptic input, inhibitory synaptic input can dynamically control the integration window that enables detection of coincident inputs and shape the spatial pattern of hilar cell activity.",

Mouse and human studies suggest that the protein kinase cAMP-dependent regulatory type II beta (PRKAR2B) gene may be involved in energy metabolism, and there is evidence that it is associated with clozapine's effects on triglyceride levels. We aimed at assessing PRKAR2B's role in antipsychotic-induced weight gain in schizophrenia patients.",

This randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled phase II/III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of bitopertin monotherapy over 4 weeks in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Of 301 patients randomised, 299 received placebo (n=80), bitopertin 10mg (n=80) or 30mg (n=77), or olanzapine 15mg (n=62). The primary endpoint, change from baseline in mean Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score, showed non-statistically significant improvements with bitopertin 30mg and olanzapine vs. placebo: bitopertin 10mg (-11.7; standard error [SE], 1.89; p=0.945), bitopertin 30mg (-15.3; SE, 1.87; p=0.211), olanzapine (-14.9; SE, 2.13; p=0.295) and placebo (-11.9; SE, 1.90). The PANSS positive subscale score, a secondary endpoint, also showed improvement with bitopertin 30mg (p=0.030) whereas a trend was observed with olanzapine (p=0.072) vs. placebo. Although not statistically significant, bitopertin 30mg and olanzapine reduced overall illness severity (Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale; p=0.098 and p=0.126, respectively). More patients receiving bitopertin 30mg (51.3%) or olanzapine (52.5%) than placebo (32.9%) were ready for hospital discharge at Week 4 (bitopertin, p=0.014; olanzapine, p=0.024). In summary, this study failed due to lack of statistical separation of either bitopertin or olanzapine (active control) from placebo on the primary endpoint. Of interest, improved positive symptoms and readiness for hospital discharge were associated with both bitopertin and olanzapine treatment. Bitopertin was safe and well tolerated in this study.", 
    "16": "Iranian crack is a new form of narcotic substance that has found widespread prevalence in Iran in the past years. Crack only nominally resembles crack cocaine as it is widely different in its clinical signs. Thus the present study aims to quantify the chemical combination of this drug. The samples included 18 specimen of Crack collected from different zones of Tehran, Iran. All specimens were in the form of inodorous cream solid powdery substance. TLC and HPLC methods were used to perform semi-quantitative and quantitative analysis of the components, respectively. The TLC analysis showed no cocaine compound in the specimens while they all revealed to contain heroin, codeine, morphine and caffeine. All but two specimens contained thebaine. None of the specimens contained amphetamine, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, tramadol and buprenorphine. Acetaminophen was found in four specimens. HPLC revealed heroin to be the foundation substance in all specimens and most of them contained a significant amount of acetylcodeine. The present analysis of the chemical combination of Crack showed that this substance is a heroin-based narcotic which is basically different from the cocaine-based crack used in Western countries. Studies like the present one at different time points, especially when abnormal clinical signs are detected, can reveal the chemical combination of the target substance and contribute to the clinical management of its acute or chronic poisoning.",

In the present study, we assess short- and long-term effects of early exposure to clonazepam (CZP) on cognitive tasks. CZP (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg/day) was administered from postnatal day (P)7 until P11, and animals were exposed to the following behavioral tests at different developmental stages: (1) a homing response (HR) test, which exploits the motivation of a rat pup to reach its home nest, was administered on P12, P15, P18 and P23 rats; (2) passive avoidance was tested in three trials (at 0, 2 and 24 h intervals) on P12, P15, P18, P25 and P32 rats; (3) within- and between-session habituation was tested in an open field (OF) at P70; and (4) a long-term memory (LTM) version of the Morris water maze (MWM) was tested at P80. A 1.0 mg/kg dose of CZP extended latency in the HR and decreased the number of correct responses when tested at P12 and P23. In the first trial of the passive avoidance test, latency to enter a dark compartment was shorter in the CZP-exposed rats. Both treated and control animals older than P15 learned the passive-avoidance response at the same rate. Irrespective of the treatments, all adult animals showed within-session habituation. Between-session habituation, however, was found only in the controls. With respect to the MWM test, all animals learned to reach the platform, but animals exposed to higher doses of CZP spent more time swimming in the first acquisition test. No difference between groups was found in a repeated acquisition test (10 and 40 days after the first acquisition test). The results of the present study show that even short-term exposure to CZP alters behavioral responsiveness in pre-weaning, juvenile and adult animals. Not only were changes observed on conventional cognitive tests in our study, but the changes also seem to be related to emotional/motivational responsiveness.",

    "30": "Body weights were increased by olanzapine in parallel with increased levels of Thr(172) phosphorylation of hypothalamic AMPK. Initially increased rate of weight gain was diminished as Thr(172) phosphorylation levels were decreased to control levels after 10\u00a0days of olanzapine treatment. ALA successfully not only prevented olanzapine-induced weight gain but also induced additional weight loss even relative to control levels throughout the treatment period. During the initial stage, ALA's action was indicated by both suppression of olanzapine-induced Thr(172) phosphorylation and an increase in Ser(485/491) phosphorylation levels. However, in the later stage when no more increases in Thr(172) phosphorylation and weight gain by olanzapine were observed, ALA's action was only indicated by increased levels of Ser(485/491) phosphorylation.", 
    "31": "Our data suggest that anti-obesity effects of ALA may be related to modulation of both Ser(485/491) phosphorylation and Thr(172) phosphorylation of hypothalamic AMPK, while olanzapine-induced weight gain may be only associated with increase in Thr(172) phosphorylation. This might be an important mechanistic clue for the\u00a0future development of anti-obesity drugs beyond control of AAPD-induced weight gain.", 
    "32": "Possible interactions of melatonin with concurrently administered drugs were investigated in in vitro studies utilising human hepatic post-mitochondrial preparations; similar studies were conducted with rat preparations to ascertain whether rat is a suitable surrogate for human. Drugs were selected based not only on the knowledge that the 6-hydroxylation of exogenous melatonin, its principal pathway of metabolism, is mainly mediated by hepatic CYP1A2, but also on the likelihood of the drug being concurrently administered with melatonin. Hepatic preparations were incubated with either melatonin or 6-hydroxymelatonin in the presence and absence of a range of concentrations of interacting drug, and the production of 6-sulphatoxymelatonin monitored using a radioimmunoassay procedure. Of the drugs screened, only the potent CYP1A2 inhibitor 5-methoxypsoralen impaired the 6-melatonin hydroxylation at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, and is likely to lead to clinical interactions; diazepam, tamoxifen and acetaminophen (paracetamol) did not impair the metabolic conversion of melatonin to 6-sulphatoxymelatonin at concentrations attained following therapeutic administration. 17-Ethinhyloestradiol appeared not to suppress the 6-hydroxylation of melatonin but inhibited the sulphation of 6-hydroxymelatonin, but this is unlikely to result in an interaction following therapeutic intake of the steroid. Species differences in the inhibition of melatonin metabolism in human and rat hepatic post-mitochondrial preparations were evident implying that the rat may not be an appropriate surrogate of human in such studies.", 
    "33": "Anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis, formally recognized in 2007, has been increasingly identified as a significant cause of autoimmune and paraneoplastic encephalitis. Approximately 80% of the patients are females. The characteristic syndrome evolves in several stages, with approximately 70% of the patients presenting with a prodromal phase of fever, malaise, headache, upper respiratory tract symptoms, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Next, typically within two weeks, patients develop psychiatric symptoms including insomnia, delusions, hyperreligiosity, paranoia, hallucinations, apathy and depression. Catatonic symptoms, seizures, abnormal movements, autonomic instability, memory deficits may also develop during the course of the disease. Presence of antibodies against the GluN1 subunit of the NMDAR in the CSF and serum confirm the diagnosis of NMDAR encephalitis, which also should prompt a thorough search for an underlying tumor. Age, gender, and ethnicity may all play a role, as black females older than 18 years of age have an increased likelihood of an underlying tumor. Treatment is focused on tumor resection and first-line immunotherapy [corticosteroids, plasma exchange, and intravenous immunoglobulin]. In non-responders, second- line immunotherapy [rituximab or cyclophosphamide or combined] is required. More than 75% of the patients recover completely or have mild sequelae, while the remaining patients end up demonstrating persistent severe disability or death. There is a paucity of literature on the management of psychiatric symptoms in this population. Given the neuropsychiatric symptoms in the relatively early phase of the illness, approximately 77 % of the patients are first evaluated by a psychiatrist. Earlier recognition of this illness is of paramount importance as prompt diagnosis and treatment can potentially improve prognosis. We describe two patients diagnosed with NMDAR encephalitis presenting with two different psychiatric manifestations. The first patient presented with psychotic mania and catatonic symptoms, while the second suffered from depression with psychotic and catatonic features refractory to psychotropic medications. We review of the use of psychotropic medications and ECT to address insomnia, agitation, psychosis, mood dysregulation and catatonia in NMDAR encephalitis.",

The objectives of this study were to develop a novel HPLC-MS/selected reaction monitoring (SRM) method capable of quantifying ketamine and norketamine using an isotopic dilution strategy in biological matrices and study the formation of norketamine, the principal metabolite of ketamine with and without the presence of midazolam, a well-known CYP3A substrate. The chromatographic separation was achieved using a Thermo Betasil Phenyl 100\u2009\u00d7\u20092 mm column combined with an isocratic mobile phase composed of acetonitrile, methanol, water and formic acid (60:20:20:0.4) at a flow rate of 300 \u03bcL/min. The mass spectrometer was operating in selected reaction monitoring mode and the analytical range was set at 0.05-50 \u03bcm. The precision (CV) and accuracy (NOM) observed were 3.9-7.8 and 95.9-111.1% respectively. The initial rate of formation of norketamine was determined using various ketamine concentrations and Km values of 18.4, 13.8 and 30.8 \u03bcm for rat, dog and human liver S9 fractions were observed, respectively. The metabolic stability of ketamine on liver S9 fractions was significantly higher in human (T1/2 \u2009=\u2009159.4 min) compared with rat (T1/2 \u2009=\u200912.6 min) and dog (T1/2 \u2009=\u20097.3 min) liver S9 fractions. Moreover significantly lower IC50 and Ki values observed in human compared with rat and dog liver S9 fractions. Experiments with cDNA expressed CYP3A enzymes showed that the formation of norketamine is mediated by CYP3A but results suggest an important contribution from other isoenzymes, most likely CYP2C particularly in rat.",

This study evaluated health-care utilization over a 2-year period in patients with DS at an outpatient clinic of a German epilepsy center. Data on the course of epilepsy, anticonvulsant treatment, and direct costs were recorded using the electronic seizure diary Epivista and patients' files. We enrolled 13 patients with DS (6 females, mean age: 12.3\u00b17.5 years) between 2007 and 2010 and evaluated them during a 1-year baseline. All patients had drug-resistant epilepsy and their seizures failed to improve with a mean number of 6.7\u00b13.4 anticonvulsants. They had an overall mean seizure frequency of 102.1 seizures per year (median: 31, range: 3-538) with 43.2 GTCSs per year (median: 14, range: 0-228). We estimated the annual total direct costs at \u20ac6506\u00b13974 (range: \u20ac1174-11,783) per patient with hospitalization (68.9% of total direct costs) as the major cost factor ahead of costs for anticonvulsants (24.0%). For the 1-year follow-up period, less severely affected patients were continued on conventional anticonvulsants (n=4) or switched to adjunctive treatment with stiripentol and clobazam (n=9). In the latter group, six patients (67%) were long-term responders, with between 25% and 100% seizure reduction with respect to either GTCSs or the overall seizure frequency. This reduction in seizure frequency was associated with a shift in the distribution of cost components towards higher medication costs and decreased hospitalization costs. The total direct costs increased by 42.7%, mainly due to the newly introduced stiripentol, with an annual cost of \u20ac6610. This study showed that direct costs of patients with DS were above the average European costs of drug-resistant epilepsy in children. Treatment with new anticonvulsants resulted in reduction of seizures and inpatient admissions.",

These symptoms are a burden for caregivers. Circadian rhythm disturbance of dementia relates ADL and cognitive impairment, and diurnal rhythm disorder of blood pressure and body temperature. Some study shows that circadian rhythm disorders in dementia are a disturbance of neural network between suprachiasmatic nucleus and cerebral white matter, and involvement of both frontal lobes, left parietal and occipital cortex, left temporoparietal region. The first-line treatment of circadian rhythm disturbance should be non-drug therapy (e.g. exercise, bright light exposure, reduce caffeine intake, etc.). If physician prescribe drugs, keep the rule of low-dose and short-term and avoid benzodiazepines. Atypical antipsychotic drugs like risperidone and some antidepressants are useful for treatment of insomnia in dementia. But this usage is off-label. So we must well inform to patient and caregiver, and get consent about treatment. Second, some study shows circadian rhythm disorder is a risk factor of dementia. However, we should discuss that circadian rhythm disturbance is \"risk factor of dementia\" or \"prodromal symptom of dementia\". If a clinician finds circadian rhythm disorder in elderly people, should be examined cognitive and ADL function, and careful about that patients have dementia or will develop dementia.",

In this study, we determined the specificity and cross-reactivity of IV M-1 for the detection of benzodiazepine-related drugs and their metabolites in urine. The IV M-1 could detect triazolobenzodiazepines such as triazolam in urine at concentrations > or = 300 ng/mL. However, thienodiazepines such as etizolam could not be detected because of lack of cross reactivity. A correlation was observed between the structure of the metabolites and the reactivity of the kit; 4-hydroxy metabolites of alprazolam and triazolam were detectable, whereas a-hydroxy metabolites were not. Furthermore, 7-amino metabolites such as nitrazepam could not be detected at any concentration, including high concentrations.

Their main task in the amygdala circuitry appears to be the control of information flow, as they act as an inhibitory interface between input and output nuclei. Modulation of their activity is thus thought to affect amygdala output and the generation of fear and anxiety. Recent evidence indicates that pcs express benzodiazepine (BZ)-sensitive GABAA receptor (GABAAR) variants containing the \u03b12- and \u03b13-subunit for transmission of post-synaptic currents, yet little is known about the expression of extrasynaptic GABAARs, mediating tonic inhibition and regulating neuronal excitability. Here, we show that pcs from the lateral and medial intercalated cell cluster (l- and mITC, respectively) express a tonic GABAergic conductance that could be significantly increased in a concentration-dependent manner by the \u03b4-preferring GABAAR agonist THIP (0.5-10 \u03bcM), but not by the BZ diazepam (1 \u03bcM). The neurosteroid THDOC (300 nM) also increased tonic currents in pcs significantly, but only in the presence of additional GABA (5 \u03bcM). Immunohistochemical stainings revealed that both the \u03b4-GABAAR and the \u03b14-GABAAR subunit are expressed throughout all ITCs, while no staining for the \u03b15-GABAAR subunit could be detected. Moreover, 1 \u03bcM THIP dampened excitability in pcs most likely by increasing shunting inhibition. In line with this, THIP significantly decreased lITC-generated inhibition in target cells residing in the BLA nucleus by 30%. Taken together these results demonstrate for the first time that pcs express a tonic inhibitory conductance mediated most likely by \u03b14/\u03b4-containing GABAARs. This data also suggest that \u03b4-GABAAR targeting compounds might possibly interfere with pcs-related neuronal processes such as fear extinction.", 
    "48": "The use-dependent regulation of the GABAA receptor occurs under physiological, pathological, and pharmacological conditions. Tolerance induced by prolonged administration of benzodiazepines is associated with changes in GABAA receptor function. Chronic exposure of neurons to GABA for 48 hr induces a downregulation of the GABAA receptor number and an uncoupling of the GABA/benzodiazepine site interactions. A single brief exposure ((t1/2) =\u20093 min) of rat neocortical neurons to the neurotransmitter initiates a process that results in uncoupling hours later (t(1/2)\u2009=\u200912 hr) without alterations in the number of GABAA receptors and provides a paradigm to study the uncoupling mechanism selectively. Here we report that uncoupling induced by a brief GABAA receptor activation is blocked by the coincubation with inhibitors of protein kinases A and C, indicating that the uncoupling is mediated by the activation of a phosphorylation cascade. GABA-induced uncoupling is accompanied by subunit-selective changes in the GABAA receptor mRNA levels. However, the GABA-induced downregulation of the \u03b13 subunit mRNA level is not altered by the kinase inhibitors, suggesting that the uncoupling is the result of a posttranscriptional regulatory process. GABA exposure also produces an increase in the serine phosphorylation on the GABAA receptor \u03b32 subunit. Taken together, our results suggest that the GABA-induced uncoupling is mediated by a posttranscriptional mechanism involving an increase in the phosphorylation of GABAA receptors. The uncoupling of the GABAA receptor may represent a compensatory mechanism to control GABAergic neurotransmission under conditions in which receptors are persistently activated.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of diphenhydramine (DPH) on sleep in pediatric intensive care unit burn patients using Myra Levine's Conservation Model as the organizing framework. For this study, secondary analysis of polysomnography data and retrospective chart review were used. Twelve DPH patients were pair matched in terms of morphine, midazolam, and methadone with 12 non-DPH patients.

    "63": "Inhibition of the mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCLX) by CGP37157 is protective in models of neuronal injury that involve disruption of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis. However, the Ca(2+) signaling pathways and stores underlying neuroprotection by that inhibitor are not well defined. In the present study, we analyzed how intracellular Ca(2+) levels are modulated by CGP37157 (10\u2009\u03bcM) during NMDA insults in primary cultures of rat cortical neurons. We initially assessed the presence of NCLX in mitochondria of cultured neurons by immunolabeling, and subsequently, we analyzed the effects of CGP37157 on neuronal Ca(2+) homeostasis using cameleon-based mitochondrial Ca(2+) and cytosolic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i) live imaging. We observed that NCLX-driven mitochondrial Ca(2+) exchange occurs in cortical neurons under basal conditions as CGP37157 induced a decrease in [Ca(2)]i concomitant with a Ca(2+) accumulation inside the mitochondria. In turn, CGP37157 also inhibited mitochondrial Ca(2+) efflux after the stimulation of acetylcholine receptors. In contrast, CGP37157 strongly prevented depolarization-induced [Ca(2+)]i increase by blocking voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels (VGCCs), whereas it did not induce depletion of ER Ca(2+) stores. Moreover, mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload was reduced as a consequence of diminished Ca(2+) entry through VGCCs. The decrease in cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload by CGP37157 resulted in a reduction of excitotoxic mitochondrial damage, characterized here by a reduction in mitochondrial membrane depolarization, oxidative stress and calpain activation. In summary, our results provide evidence that during excitotoxicity CGP37157 modulates cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca(2+) dynamics that leads to attenuation of NMDA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal cell death by blocking VGCCs.",

The higher acquisition cost of asenapine was roughly offset by the healthcare savings conferred through its greater efficacy in treating these patients.

Western blot analysis revealed that hepatic CYP3A1 expression increases, while CYP3A2 expression decreases in API rats. In female rats, in which CYP3A2 is barely expressed in the liver, MDZ metabolism is little affected by API.

However, the demonstration of a true physiological role of DBI and its fragments has only recently been reported. Based on DBI gain- and loss-of-function experiments in vivo, DBI and its fragment ODN were found to promote neurogenesis in the subventricular zone in vivo. Acting as NAM on GABAA receptors of precursor cells, DBI counteracted the inhibitory effect of GABA and thereby enhanced the proliferation of these cells (Alfonso et al. in Cell Stem Cell 10:76-87, 2012). Conversely and most remarkably, in similar gain- and loss-of-function experiments in the thalamus, the DBI gene products acted as positive allosteric modulators (PAM) of GABAA receptors in prolonging the duration of IPSCs, an effect which was specific for GABA transmission within the reticular nucleus (nRT) (Christian et al. in Neuron 78:1063-1074, 2013). Since intra-nRT potentiation of GABA transmission by benzodiazepine drugs exerts powerful anti-oscillatory effects, DBI might be endogenously effective by modulating seizure susceptibility. It remains to be seen by which mechanism both NAM and PAM activity can arise from the Dbi gene. Nevertheless, the results open new perspectives on the regionally distinct endogenous modulation of GABA transmission via the benzodiazepine site.", 
    "96": "Evidence of aberrant hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) activity in many psychiatric disorders, although not universal, has sparked long-standing interest in HPA hormones as biomarkers of disease or treatment response. HPA activity may be chronically elevated in melancholic depression, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia. The HPA axis may be more reactive to stress in social anxiety disorder and autism spectrum disorders. In contrast, HPA activity is more likely to be low in PTSD and atypical depression. Antidepressants are widely considered to inhibit HPA activity, although inhibition is not unanimously reported in the literature. There is evidence, also uneven, that the mood stabilizers lithium and carbamazepine have the potential to augment HPA measures, while benzodiazepines, atypical antipsychotics, and to some extent, typical antipsychotics have the potential to inhibit HPA activity. Currently, the most reliable use of HPA measures in most disorders is to predict the likelihood of relapse, although changes in HPA activity have also been proposed to play a role in the clinical benefits of psychiatric treatments. Greater attention to patient heterogeneity and more consistent approaches to assessing treatment effects on HPA function may solidify the value of HPA measures in predicting treatment response or developing novel strategies to manage psychiatric disease.",

Here, we examined whether (1) co-administration of midazolam with morphine would exacerbate morphine tolerance and morphine-induced hyperactive behaviors, and (2) protein kinase C (PKC) would contribute to these behavioral changes. Male rats of 3-4 weeks old were exposed to a hindpaw burn injury. In Experiment 1, burn-injured young rats received once daily saline or morphine (10mg/kg, subcutaneous, s.c.), followed 30min later by either saline or midazolam (2mg/kg, intraperitoneal, i.p.), for 14 days beginning 3 days after burn injury. In Experiment 2, young rats with burn injury were administered with morphine (10mg/kg, s.c.), midazolam (2mg/kg, i.p.), and chelerythrine chloride (a non-specific PKC inhibitor, 10nmol, intrathecal) for 14 days. For both experiments, cumulative morphine anti-nociceptive dose-response (ED50) was tested and hyperactive behaviors such as jumping and scratching were recorded. Following 2 weeks of each treatment, ED50 dose was significantly increased in rats receiving morphine alone as compared with rats receiving saline or midazolam alone. The ED50 dose was further increased in rats receiving both morphine and midazolam. Co-administration of morphine and midazolam also exacerbated morphine-induced hyperactive behaviors. Expression of the NR1 subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and PKC\u03b3 in the spinal cord dorsal horn (immunohistochemistry; Western blot) was upregulated in burn-injured young rats receiving morphine alone or in combination with midazolam, and chelerythrine prevented the development of morphine tolerance. These results indicate that midazolam exacerbated morphine tolerance through a spinal NMDA/PKC-mediated mechanism.", 
    "99": "Sedation or anesthesia of hatchling leatherback sea turtles was employed to acquire auditory evoked potential (AEP) measurements in air and in water to assess their hearing sensitivity in relation to potential consequences from anthropogenic noise. To reduce artifacts in AEP collection caused by muscle movement, hatchlings were sedated with midazolam 2 or 3 mg/kg i.v. for in-air (n = 7) or in-water (n = 11) AEP measurements; hatchlings (n = 5) were anesthetized with ketamine 6 mg/kg and dexmedetomidine 30 microg/kg i.v. reversed with atipamezole 300 microg/kg, half i.m. and half i.v. for in-air AEP measurements. Midazolam-sedated turtles were also physically restrained with a light elastic wrap. For in-water AEP measurements, sedated turtles were brought to the surface every 45-60 sec, or whenever they showed intention signs for breathing, and not submerged again until they took a breath. Postprocedure temperature-corrected venous blood pH, pCO2, pO2, and HCO3- did not differ among groups, although for the midazolam-sedated in-water group, pCO2 trended lower, and in the ketamine-dexmedetomidine anesthetized group there was one turtle considered clinically acidotic (temperature-corrected pH = 7.117). Venous blood lactate was greater for hatchlings recently emerged from the nest than for turtles sedated with midazolam in air, with the other two groups falling intermediate between, but not differing significantly from the high and low lactate groups. Disruptive movements were less frequent with anesthesia than with sedation in the in-air group. Both sedation with midazolam and anesthesia with ketamine-dexmedetomidine were successful for allowing AEP measurements in hatchling leatherback sea turtles. Sedation allowed the turtle to protect its airway voluntarily while limiting flipper movement. Midazolam or ketamine-dexmedetomidine (and reversal with atipamezole) would be useful for other procedures requiring minor or major restraint in leatherback sea turtle hatchlings and other sea turtles, although variable susceptibilities may require dose adjustments.", 
    "100": "To obtain drugs which are more selective at benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors, design and synthesis of functionally selective ligands for BZD receptors is the current strategy of our pharmaceutical chemistry department. The affinity of newly synthesized ligands is assessed by radioligand receptor binding assays. Based on our previous studies, 2-phenyl-5-oxo-7-methyl-1,3, 4-oxadiazolo[a,2,3]-pyrimidine (compound A) was chosen for design and synthesis of new triazole derivatives as GABAA BZD receptor agonist. The cortical membrane of male Sprague-Dawley rats was prepared as the source of the BZD receptors. Different concentrations of membrane protein and [3H]-flumazenil were incubated at room temperature at different time periods to reach the steady-state. To saturate the receptors, increased amounts of radioligand were incubated with membrane protein. The bound and un-bound ligands were separated by centrifugation. The affinity of compound A was measured in competition studies at optimum conditions by displacement of [3H]-Flumazenil from rat cortical membrane. Based on results, the optimum conditions of radioligand receptor binding assay of benzodiazepines were 35 min incubation of ligands with 100 \u03bcg cortical membrane protein and 8.6 \u00d7 10-5 nmole 3H-flumazenil in a final volume of 0.5 mL Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) at 30 \u00b0C. The binding parameters of [3H]-flumazenil, Bmax and Kd were determined through saturation studies as 0.638 \u00b1 0.099 pmol/mg and 1.35 \u00b1 0.316 nM respectively. The affinity of compound A was 1.9 nM comparable with diazepam (1.53nM). This finding makes the compound an interesting lead for further optimization. Starting from this compound, new ligands were synthesized and screened in-vitro by competitive binding assays.",

    "112": "Priapism is a persistent, and often painful, penile erection, lasting more than 3 hours, not usually associated with sexual stimuli. It is a urological emergency that can cause serious complications. Drugs are responsible of the onset of 25 to 40% of cases of priapism. Several classes of medication are involved: antidepressants, antihypertensives, anticoagulants, alpha-blockers and some psychoactive substances (alcohol, cocaine, cannabis...). However, about 50% of drug related priapism is due to antipsychotics (AP). Clinicians should be aware of this rare side effect because of the severity of its complications and the difficulty of its management, especially in non-stabilized psychotic patients.", 
    "113": "We report a case of a 22-year-old male Moroccan patient, diagnosed with schizophrenia, who had been admitted for the first time to a psychiatric hospital for management of a psychotic episode. First, he received 15 mg per day of haloperidol, and seven days later he developed priapism. The patient was immediately referred for urological care. Aspiration and irrigation of the corpora cavernosa was proposed, but could not be performed because of patient refusal, and the erection resolved spontaneously after 10 hours. Haloperidol was stopped, and four days later the patient was switched to 10mg per day of olanzapine. After 10 days of treatment, he developed a second episode of priapism, and olanzapine was also stopped. A cavernosal aspiration-irrigation was performed in emergency; which resulted in the partial detumescence of the penis. Two days later, and despite therapeutic abstention, the patient presented another episode of priapism. The indication of a revascularization of the corpora cavernosa was proposed, but again the patient refused the surgery. Finally, the patient was administered 400mg/day of amisulpride, with a favorable outcome. Priapism disappeared after a month with the installation of fibrosis and partial loss of erectile function.", 
    "114": "The precise mechanisms of the role of AP in the occurrence of priapism are not all known and a multifactor etiology seems the most likely. Neuromuscular hypothesis is the most mentioned, involving the blocking action of alpha1-adrenergic receptors of the corpora cavernosa for which most of AP have an affinity. The occurrence of priapism in a psychotic patient, especially during periods of decompensation, raises a number of challenges for the medical staff. First, the non-recognition by the patient of this side effect, and its potentially severe consequences. Second, the absence of link between dose and duration of AP treatment on one side, and the onset of priapism on the other, which makes it hard to predict. The third challenge is the choice and initiation of another AP. The literature reveals many cases of priapism in both conventional and atypical AP, the presence of a predisposition to this type of incident has been reported. However, few authors have focused on alternatives to provide for these patients. Amisulpride is currently the only molecule that does not have alpha-adrenergic affinity and is therefore preferred in these cases.",

In this study, we investigate the short- and long-term neuroprotective effects of Diazepam on neonatal rats with HIBD and the potential mechanisms underlying its protective effects. Seven-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to left carotid artery ligation followed by a 2-h exposure to 8% oxygen and 92% nitrogen. Diazepam was administered immediately via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection after inducing HIBD at a dose of 10 mg kg(-1)8h(-1) for three consecutive days. Three days after HIBD, rats were decapitated, and the extent of brain injury was evaluated using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Additionally, the expression of Potassium-chloride cotransporter-2 (KCC2) was analysed using real-time PCR, Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Three weeks after HIBD, rats were subjected to the Morris water maze (MWM) test and the locomotor activity test to determine the long-term therapeutic effects of Diazepam. We observed that the volume of infarction in the Diazepam group was significantly less (P<0.01) compared with the HIBD group. We also observed that the learning and memory abilities of the Diazepam rats improved significantly compared with the untreated rats (P<0.05) and that the decrease in KCC2 expression was prevented (P<0.01). Early treatment with Diazepam appears to attenuate HIBD and can efficiently improve the long-term learning and memory capabilities of the animal. A potential mechanism underlying these effects may involve preventing the decrease in KCC2 expression.",

HI-6 treatment reactivated soman inhibited plasma and RBC cholinesterase up to 40%. Fluoro-Jade B (FJ-B) staining of neurodegenerative neurons showed that soman induced significant necrotic neuronal cell death, which was reduced by this antidotal treatment. Soman increased the expression of neuronal proteins including c-Fos, Bax and Calpain levels in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex and cerebellum regions of the brain.

In the case of the SSRIs, they are to a large extent due to 5-HT2B-mediated upregulation and editing of genes. These alterations induce alteration in effects of cPLA2, GluK2, and the 5-HT2B receptor, probably including increases in both glucose metabolism and glycogen turnover, which in combination have therapeutic effect on major depression. The ability of increased levels of extracellular K(+) to increase [Ca(2+)] i is increased as a sign of increased K(+)-induced excitability in astrocytes. Acute anxiolytic drug treatment with benzodiazepines or GABAA receptor stimulation has similar glycogenolysis-enhancing effects. The antibipolar drugs induce intracellular alkalinization in astrocytes with lithium acting on one acid extruder and carbamazepine and valproic acid on a different acid extruder. They inhibit K(+)-induced and transmitter-induced increase of astrocytic [Ca(2+)] i and thereby probably excitability. In several cases, they exert different changes in gene expression than SSRIs, determined both in cultured astrocytes and in freshly isolated astrocytes from drug-treated animals.",

In the current study, we investigated whether CCK-8 exerts a direct effect on T cells through influencing differentiation and cytokine production of distinct CD4(+) T cell subsets in vitro. Our results showed that CCK-8 differentially affects the development and function of CD4(+) T cell populations, with a negative influence on Th1 and Th17 cells and positive regulatory effect on inducible T regulatory cells (iTreg). Notably, CCK-8 suppressed Th1 while slightly enhancing Th2 development and cytokine production. Similarly, CCK-8 inhibited the differentiation of Th17 cells and promoted Foxp3 expression. L-364,718 and LY-288,513, selective antagonists of CCK1R and CCK2R, respectively, suppressed the effects of CCK-8 on CD4(+) T cell subset-specific transcription factors. Our findings strongly indicate that CCK-8 exerts a direct effect on T cells, which is dependent on CCKRs, particularly CCK2R.

The effects of 6Bio-R, 14Bio-R, NESS 0327, GP1a and GP2a (0.3-30 \u03bcM) were evaluated using a two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. 6Bio-R and 14Bio-R potentiated GABA-evoked Cl(-) currents. NESS 0327, GP1a and GP2a did not affect the GABAA receptor function, but they acted as antagonists of 6Bio-R. Moreover, NESS 0327 inhibited the potentiation of the GABAA receptor function induced by rimonabant. The benzodiazepine site seems to participate in the action of these compounds. In fact, flumazenil antagonized the potentiation of the GABAA receptor induced by 6Bio-R, and NESS 0327 reduced the action of lorazepam and zolpidem. On the contrary, NESS 0327 did not antagonize the action of \"classic\" GABAergic modulators (propanol, anesthetics, barbiturates or steroids).

While intranasal delivery of these drugs is desirable, the small volume of the nasal cavity and low drug solubility pose significant difficulties. Here, we prepared supersaturated diazepam solutions under physiological conditions and without precipitation, using a prodrug/enzyme system. Avizafone, a peptide prodrug of diazepam, was delivered with--Aspergillus oryzae (A.O.) protease, an enzyme identified from a pool of hydrolytic enzymes in assay buffer, pH 7.4 at 32\u00b0C. This enzyme converted avizafone to diazepam at supersaturated concentrations. In vitro permeability studies were performed at various prodrug/enzyme ratios using Madin-Darby canine kidney II-wild type (MDCKII-wt) monolayers, a representative model of the nasal epithelium. Monolayer integrity was examined using TEER measurement and the lucifer yellow permeability assay. Prodrug/drug concentrations were measured using HPLC.

THC specificity was especially low (29% [DrugWipe(\u00ae)] and 47% [DrugTest(\u00ae) 5000]) due to low cut-off concentrations. These data were similar to those obtained from the literature (e.g., DRUID project).

Although oral fluid may be a useful matrix for on-site testing of drugged drivers, it is evident that oral fluid devices still show a lack of sensitivity (methamphetamine, benzodiazepines) and specificity (THC). Poor results for benzodiazepines may be explained by the small positive test number. Although the sensitivity for THC came out higher than compared to the literature, specificity is not yet satisfactory (only <90%).

Acute toxicity was determined in a two-stage experiment: (1) a reduced number of Balb-c male mice received 5000 mg/kg of EB719 to allow evaluation of general activity and other 27 parameters, plus death, up to the establishment of non-lethal dose (NLD), as well as lethal dose 50% (LD50); (2) NLD was administered and diazepam introduced as reference drug. EB719 showed LD50=178.0 mg/kg, and NLD 156.3 mg/kg. In stage one EB719 did not influence general activity, but provoked impairment in grasp reflexes, tail squeeze and breathing; piloerection and cyanosis were increased. In stage two, alterations occurred in auricular reflex, piloerection and breathing after diazepam administration, but not in response to EB719. Intestinal hemorrhage caused by local bleeding was observed after necropsy, and may be the main cause of animals' death other than a systemic effect of the extract. Although the isolated compounds are biologically and pharmacologically active in both men and animal systems, it is premature to relate their occurrence in EB719 to the observed intestine hemorrhage in mice.",

Intraoperatively, one group received a continuous intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine alone, whereas the other received a continuous dexmedetomidine infusion plus a small dose of midazolam. Early measurements of patient anxiety and psychomotor performance were lower in patients who had received midazolam. This difference was not seen later in the appointment. An amnesic effect was observed in those patients who received midazolam. This effect, however, did not translate into increased patient satisfaction in the group receiving midazolam. Our findings suggest a prolonged discharge time for patients who had been given midazolam that may be clinically significant. Overall, dexmedetomidine showed an unpredictable sedative response and may be less practical than more common alternatives for oral surgery procedures.",

IVS is employed in diagnostic and ablation procedures for transcutaneous treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, electrical cardioversion of arrhythmias, and the insertion of implantable electronic devices including pacemakers, defibrillators, and loop recorders. Sedation is frequently performed by nursing staff under the supervision of the proceduralist and in the absence of specialist anesthesiologists. The sedation requirements vary depending on the nature of the procedure. A wide range of sedation techniques have been reported with sedation from the near fully conscious to levels approaching that of general anesthesia. This review examines the methods employed and outcomes associated with reported sedation techniques. There is a large experience with the combination of benzodiazepines and narcotics. These drugs have a broad therapeutic range and the advantage of readily available reversal agents. More recently, the use of propofol without serious adverse events has been reported. The results provide a guide regarding the expected outcomes of these approaches. The complication rate and need for emergency assistance is low in reported series where sedation is administered by nonspecialist anesthesiology staff.",

The purpose of this study is to compare differences in reduction and sedation outcomes, including recovery times, of these 3 sedation agents.",

The patients were grouped according to the type of sedation agent. We calculated percentages of reduction and sedation complications along with recovery times. Reduction complications included fracture, skin or neurovascular injury, and failure of reduction requiring general anesthesia. Sedation complications included use of bag-valve mask and artificial airway, intubation, prolonged recovery, use of a reversal agent, and inability to achieve sedation. We then compared the data for each sedation agent.",

    "172": "Midazolam is a benzodiazepine with rapid onset of action and short duration of effect. In healthy neonates the half-life (t 1/2) and the clearance (Cl) are 3.3-fold longer and 3.7-fold smaller, respectively, than in adults. The volume of distribution (Vd) is 1.1\u2009L/kg both in neonates and adults. Midazolam is hydroxylated by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5; the activities of these enzymes surge in the liver in the first weeks of life and thus the metabolic rate of midazolam is lower in neonates than in adults. Midazolam acts as a sedative, as an antiepileptic, for those infants who are refractory to standard antiepileptic therapy, and as an anaesthetic. Information of midazolam as an anaesthetic in infants are very little. Midazolam is usually administered intravenously; when minimal sedation is required, intranasal administration of midazolam is employed. Disease affects the pharmacokinetics of midazolam in neonates; multiple organ failure reduces the Cl of midazolam and mechanical ventilation prolongs the t 1/2 of this drug. ECMO therapy increases t 1/2, Cl, and Vd of midazolam several times. The adverse effects of midazolam in neonates are scarce: pain, tenderness, and thrombophlebitis may occur. Respiratory depression and hypotension appear in a limited percentage of infants following intravenous infusion of midazolam. In conclusion, midazolam is a safe and effective drug which is employed as a sedative, as antiepileptic agent, for infants who are refractory to standard antiepileptic therapy, and as an anaesthetic.",

Sequential metabolic reactions by Phase I and then Phase II enzymes were found in diclofenac [CYP2C9 and UDP-glucuronyltransferases (UGTs)], midazolam (CYP3A4 and UGTs) and propranolol (CYP1A2/2D6 and UGTs). Moreover, lamotrigine and salbutamol were metabolized to lamotrigine-N-glucuronide and salbutamol 4-O-sulfate, respectively. These metabolites, which are human specific, could be observed in clinical studies, but not in conventional hepatic culture systems as in previous reports. Acetaminophen was metabolized to glucuronide and sulfate conjugates, and N-acetyl-p-benzo-quinoneimine (NAPQI) and its metabolites were not observed. In addition, mRNA of drug-metabolism enzymes [CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, UGT1A1, UGT2B7, sulfotransferase 1A1 (SULT1A1) and glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1)], which were measured by qRT-PCR, were expressed in the human hepatocyte spheroids.

    "183": "Long-term use of benzodiazepine-type drugs may lead to physical dependence, manifested by withdrawal syndrome after abrupt cessation of treatment. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of duration of treatment, as well as the role of \u03b11-containing GABAA receptors, in development of physical dependence to diazepam, assessed through the level of anxiety and susceptibility to pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures, 24h after withdrawal from protracted treatment in rats. Withdrawal of 2mg/kg diazepam after 28, but not after 14 or 21 days of administration led to an anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze. Antagonism of the diazepam effects at \u03b11-containing GABAA receptors, achieved by daily administration of the neutral modulator \u03b2CCt (5mg/kg), did not affect the anxiety level during withdrawal. An increased susceptibility to PTZ-induced seizures was observed during diazepam withdrawal after 21 and 28 days of treatment. Daily co-administration of \u03b2CCt further decreased the PTZ-seizure threshold after 21 days of treatment, whilst it prevented the diazepam withdrawal-elicited decrease of the PTZ threshold after 28 days of treatment. In conclusion, the current study suggests that the role of \u03b11-containing GABAA receptors in mediating the development of physical dependence may vary based on the effect being studied and duration of protracted treatment. Moreover, the present data supports previous findings that the lack of activity at \u03b11-containing GABAA receptors is not sufficient to eliminate physical dependence liability of ligands of the benzodiazepine type.",

However, it was first characterized as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor because it appears to be responsible for high affinity binding of a number of benzodiazepines to non-neuronal tissues. Ensuing studies have employed natural and synthetic ligands to assess the role of TSPO function in a number of natural and pathological circumstances. Largely through the use of these compounds and biochemical associations, TSPO has been proposed to play a role in the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP), which has been associated with cell death in many human pathological conditions. Here, we critically assess the role of TSPO in the function of the PTP through the generation of mice in which the Tspo gene has been conditionally eliminated. Our results show that 1) TSPO plays no role in the regulation or structure of the PTP, 2) endogenous and synthetic ligands of TSPO do not regulate PTP activity through TSPO, 3) outer mitochondrial membrane regulation of PTP activity occurs though a mechanism that does not require TSPO, and 4) hearts lacking TSPO are as sensitive to ischemia-reperfusion injury as hearts from control mice. These results call into question a wide variety of studies implicating TSPO in a number of pathological processes through its actions on the PTP.",

    "197": "The human ether-\u00e0-go-go-related gene (hERG) encodes the pore-forming subunit of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel, which is important for cardiac repolarization. Reduction of hERG current due to genetic mutations or drug interferences causes long QT syndrome, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. To date, there is no effective therapeutic method to restore or enhance hERG channel function. Using cell biology and electrophysiological methods, we found that the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol increased the expression and function of hERG, but not ether-\u00e0-go-go or Kv1.5 channels stably expressed in human embryonic kidney cells. The carbachol-mediated increase in hERG expression was abolished by the selective M3 antagonist 4-DAMP (1,1-dimethyl-4-diphenylacetoxypiperidinium iodide) but not by the M2 antagonist AF-DX 116 (11[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]-acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b] [1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one). Treatment of cells with carbachol reduced the hERG-ubiquitin interaction and slowed the rate of hERG degradation. We previously showed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 mediates degradation of hERG channels. Here, we found that disrupting the Nedd4-2 binding domain in hERG completely eliminated the effect of carbachol on hERG channels. Carbachol treatment enhanced the phosphorylation level, but not the total level, of Nedd4-2. Blockade of the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway abolished the carbachol-induced enhancement of hERG channels. Our data suggest that muscarinic activation increases hERG channel expression by phosphorylating Nedd4-2 via the PKC pathway.",

During the 20th century it was rather regarded as a rare motoric manifestation of schizophrenia and that classification has almost resulted in the disappearance of catatonia among patients outside of the schizophrenia spectrum. With the introduction of neuroleptics, the incidence of catatonic schizophrenia also declined which was attributed to effective treatment. Simultaneously, neuroleptic malignant syndrome was described, which shows many similarities with catatonia. Recently, several researchers suggested a common origin of the two disorders. In this paper we review case reports of the last five years, in which both neuroleptic malignant syndrome and catatonia had emerged as a diagnosis. Additionally, based on the relevant literature, we propose a common hypothetical pathomechanism with therapeutic implications for the two syndromes. Besides underlining the difficulties of differential diagnosis, the reviewed cases demonstrate a transition between the two illnesses. The similarities and the possible shifts may suggest a neuropathological and pathophysiological overlap in the background of the two syndromes. Electroconvulsive therapy and benzodiazepines seem to be an effective treatment in both syndromes. These two treatment approaches can be highly valuable in clinical practice, especially if one considers the difficulties of differential diagnosis.",

This study examined the influence of acute pretreatment with different extracts of Hypericum perforatum from Serbia on pentobarbital-induced sleeping time, impairment of motor coordination caused by diazepam and paracetamol pharmacokinetics in mice. Ethanolic extract, aqueous extract, infusion, tablet and capsule of Hypericum perforatum were used in this experiment. The profile of Hypericum perforatum extracts as well as paracetamol plasma concentration was determined using RP-HPLC analysis. By quantitative HPLC analysis of active principles, it has been proven that Hypericum perforatum ethanolic extract has the largest content of naphtodianthrones: hypericin (57.77 \u00b5g/mL) and pseudohypericin (155.38 \u00b5g/mL). Pretreatment with ethanolic extract of Hypericum perforatum potentiated the hypnotic effect of pentobarbital and impairment of motor coordination caused by diazepam to the greatest extent and also increased paracetamol plasma concentration in comparison to the control group. These results were in correlation with naphtodianthrone concentrations. The obtained results have shown a considerable influence of Hypericum perforatum on pentobarbital and diazepam pharmacodynamics and paracetamol pharmacokinetics.",

To study the pharmacokinetics of drugs in a rat heart failure (HF) model, we developed and validated a method for the simultaneous determination of bisoprolol, ramiprilat, propranolol and midazolam in DBS samples. Bisoprolol and ramipril are widely used in the treatment of HF, and midazolam and propranolol are markers of hepatic metabolism, which can be altered in HF. A 20\u03bcL sample of rat blood was pipetted onto Whatman 903 Protein Saver Card and allowed to dry. The whole spot was excised and 300\u03bcL of solvent (methanol with 10% ultrapure water and 0.1% formic acid) was added. After mixing and incubating the sample in an ultrasonic bath, a mixture of isotopically labeled internal standards was added. After centrifugation, the extracts were cleaned on an Ostro\u2122 plate and analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy. The method was successfully validated. No significant interference was observed in the retention times of analytes or internal standards. The intraday and interday accuracy and precision were within a \u00b115% interval. The method was linear in the range 5-250\u03bcg/L and the lower limit of quantification was 5\u03bcg/L for all four analytes. The absolute matrix effect ranged from 98.7% for midazolam to 121% for ramiprilat. The recovery was lowest for ramiprilat and highest for propranolol. Samples were stable at all tested temperatures. The method has been used successfully in a real-time pharmacokinetic study in rats.", 
    "209": "A Hybrid drug which comprises the incorporation of two drug pharmacophores in one single molecule are basically designed to interact with multiple targets or to amplify its effect through action on another bio target as one single molecule or to counterbalance the known side effects associated with the other hybrid part(.) The present review article offers a detailed account of the design strategies employed for the synthesis of anticancer agents via molecular hybridization techniques. Over the years, the researchers have employed this technique to discover some promising chemical architectures displaying significant anticancer profiles. Molecular hybridization as a tool has been particularly utilized for targeting tubulin protein as exemplified through the number of research papers. The microtubule inhibitors such as taxol, colchicine, chalcones, combretasatin, phenstatins and vinca alkaloids have been utilized as one of the functionality of the hybrids and promising results have been obtained in most of the cases with some of the tubulin based hybrids exhibiting anticancer activity at nanomolar level. Linkage with steroids as biological carrier vector for anticancer drugs and the inclusion of pyrrolo [2,1-c] [1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs), a family of DNA interactive antitumor antibiotics derived from Streptomyces species in hybrid structure based drug design has also emerged as a potential strategy. Various heteroaryl based hybrids in particular isatin and coumarins have also been designed and reported to posses' remarkable inhibitory potential. Apart from presenting the design strategies, the article also highlights the structure activity relationship along with mechanistic insights revealed during the biological evaluation of the hybrids.", 
    "210": "The number of deaths associated with methadone use increased dramatically in parallel with marked increases in its use, particularly for treatment of chronic pain. To develop a clinical guideline on methadone prescribing to reduce potential harms, the American Pain Society commissioned a review of various aspects related to methadone safety. This article summarizes evidence related to unintentional overdose due to methadone and harms related to cardiac arrhythmia potential. We searched Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO databases through January 2014 for studies assessing harms associated with methadone use; we judged 70 studies to be relevant and to meet inclusion criteria. The majority of studies on overdose and cardiac arrhythmia risk are observational and provide weak evidence on which to base clinical guidelines. In patients prescribed methadone for treatment of opioid dependence, data suggest that mortality benefits related to reduction in illicit drug use outweigh harms. Despite epidemiologic data showing marked increases in the numbers of methadone-related deaths that have been primarily attributed to increased use of methadone for chronic pain, evidence on methadone and mortality risk in this population has been somewhat contradictory. There is some evidence that recent initiation of methadone, psychiatric admissions, and concomitant use of benzodiazepines are associated with a higher risk for overdose. Evidence on cardiac risks is primarily limited to case reports of torsades de pointes, primarily in patients on high doses of methadone, and to studies showing an association between methadone use and prolongation of QTc intervals. Research is needed to understand the effectiveness of dosing methods, electrocardiogram monitoring, and other risk mitigation strategies in patients prescribed methadone.", 
    "211": "This systematic review synthesizes the evidence related to methadone use and risk for overdose and cardiac arrhythmia. Findings regarding the association between methadone use and QTc interval prolongation and risk factors for methadone-associated overdose suggest potential targets for risk mitigation strategies, though research is needed to determine the effectiveness of such strategies at reducing adverse outcomes.",

    "218": "Patient characteristics and AED efficacy (decrease in drop-seizure frequency) were modeled with clinical data. Medical costs were derived from administrative claims data from a large U.S. managed health plan, with the assumption that 2.3% of drop seizures required medical care. Two-year budget impact was measured. Results were expressed as the overall difference in costs (medical and pharmacy) to a health plan and cost per member per month (PMPM) after addition of clobazam. Analyses of alternative scenarios were performed.", 
    "219": "With the assumption that 0.04% of the plan population had LGS, adding clobazam to the formulary resulted in cost savings of $98,059 in year 1 and $131,690 in year 2 (savings of $0.08 and $0.11 PMPM, respectively). Analyses of alternative scenarios with lower seizure rates upon discontinuation or greater long-term efficacy for lamotrigine and topiramate did not substantially alter conclusions. The assumption that fewer drop seizures required medical care resulted in a savings of approximately $5,000 per year with clobazam, which suggested that medically attended drop seizures drive costs.",

    "221": "Epilepsy and the medications used in its treatment are known to affect the menstrual cycle, aspects of contraception, and bone health in women. Adolescence is an important time to review the diagnosis of both epilepsy and the epilepsy syndrome because of the implications and decisions, which should be made regarding antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. In girls, once they are on AED therapy, seizure free, and driving, it becomes difficult to change therapy because of the risk of breakthrough seizures and the fact that the new AED may not be as effective as the first. So a treatment choice made in adolescence is often life-long. Therefore, women need to be started on an AED that currently appears to be the most suitable for their seizure type, has a low teratogenic risk, and hopefully does not interact with contraception. There are no contraindications to the use of non-hormonal methods of contraception in women with epilepsy. Nonenzyme-inducing AEDs (valproate, benzodiazepines, ethosuximide, levetiracetam, tiagabine, and zonisamide) do not show any interactions with the combined oral contraceptive. There are interactions between the combined oral contraceptive and hepatic microsomal-inducing AEDs (phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, topiramate [dosages >200\u00a0mg/day], oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine and perampanel [dosages >12\u00a0mg/day]) and lamotrigine. Women taking enzyme inducing AEDs should be encouraged to use a method of contraception that is unaffected by their epilepsy medication. Interactions between AEDs and other hormonal therapies are less well studied. Studies have suggested that women with epilepsy are at increased risk of fractures, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia. No studies have been undertaken looking at preventative therapies for these comorbidities. This article will concentrate on current contraceptive treatment options in patients taking AEDs.", 
    "222": "A multi-analyte method for the detection and quantification of 87 psychoactive drugs (antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and z-drugs) in human hair has been developed and fully validated using the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry system. Due to the remarkable increase in requests of hair sample tests (such as for driver's license renewals, child custody, DFA cases, and postmortem toxicology), we focused on the development of a rapid sample preparation. About 20\u00a0mg of hair samples, previously washed and cut into snippets, was ultrasonicated with 700\u00a0\u03bcl of methanol. Samples were then directly analyzed using a 4000 QTRAP (AB SCIEX, Foster City, CA, USA) with an electrospray ionization (ESI) Turbo V(TM) Ion Source. The validation criteria parameters were satisfactory and in accordance with the international guidelines. All the compounds tested were successfully detected. One important aspect is the LODs in the low picogram per milligram concentration which may suggest a potential use of this method in cases of detection of single drug exposure. However, the LC-MS/MS method has been successfully applied for the analysis of postmortem cases (n\u2009=\u20099).", 
    "223": "Postmortem redistribution (PMR) constitutes a multifaceted process, which complicates the interpretation of drug concentrations by forensic toxicologists. The present study aimed to apply quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis for modeling PMR data of structurally related drugs, 10 benzodiazepines and 10 tricyclic antidepressants. For benzodiazepines, an adequate QSAR model was obtained (R(2) = 0.98, Q(2) = 0.88, RMSEE = 0.12), in which energy, ionization and molecular size exerted significant impact. For tricyclic antidepressants, an adequate QSAR model with slightly inferior statistics (R(2) = 0.95, Q(2) = 0.87, RMSEE = 0.29) was established after exclusion of maprotiline, in which energy parameters, basicity character and lipophilicity exerted significant contribution. Thus, QSAR analysis could be used as a complementary tool to provide an informative illustration of the contributing molecular, physicochemical and structural properties in PMR process. However, the complexity, non-static and time-dependent nature of PMR endpoints raises serious concerns whether QSAR methodology could predict the degree of redistribution, highlighting the need for animal-derived PMR data.", 
    "224": "This article is part of a Special Issue \"Energy Balance\". Effects of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on food hoarding are unknown in rodents, and the effects of energy balance and GABA have not been evaluated in females. To evaluate the role of food deprivation and GABA on food hoarding, female Mongolian gerbils were given i.p. injection of diazepam (1mg/kg and 3mg/kg, respectively), a GABAA receptor agonist. Among food-deprived females, there was a bimodal pattern in the frequency of gerbils with different levels of food hoarding. High food hoarding (HFH) and low food hoarding (LFH) gerbils were analyzed. Diazepam blocked food deprivation-induced food hoarding in HFH gerbils, but not in LFH gerbils. This blockade was associated with increased cellular activation in selected brain areas, such as the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), caudate putamen (CP) and ventral tegmental area (VTA), which suggested that direct activation of GABA in the brain reward circuitry decreased food hoarding in HFH females. Moreover, diazepam increased Fos expression in field CA2 and CA3 of the hippocampus, but had no significant effect on Fos expression in field CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, indicating that the hippocampus has area-specific effects on food hoarding in HFH gerbils. Diazepam did not alter food intake in both HFH and LFH gerbils. In addition, serum corticosterone concentrations were higher in the HFH than in the LFH ones. Together, these data indicated that food deprivation increased food hoarding in female gerbils, diazepam reduced food deprivation-induced food hoarding in HFH gerbils, and that GABA might influence food hoarding via classical reward circuitry via the mesolimbic dopamine system and specific hippocampal areas.",
