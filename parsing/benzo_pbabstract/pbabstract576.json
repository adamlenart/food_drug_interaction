Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is marked by a change in state of consciousness, ranging from withdrawal through stupor to coma. In addition, it is characterized by autonomic dysfunction, hyperthermia, mutism, and rigidity. It is included in the differential diagnosis of the catatonic syndrome. Evidence is reviewed to suggest that agents responsible for improving NMS act on the dopamine (DA) gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) connections in the mesostriatal and mesolimbic systems and also in the hypothalamus. In addition, based on symptomatology, pathophysiology, and therapeutic mechanisms, the relationship between nonpsychogenic neuroleptic-induced catatonia and psychogenic catatonia is examined.", 
    "1": "Zopiclone and CGS 9896 are two nonbenzodiazepine compounds which have been shown to displace benzodiazepines from their binding sites. The present study compared the behavioral effects of these two compounds in rats with those of chlordiazepoxide. The three drugs produced dose-related increases in punished drinking as did pentobarbital and meprobamate but not PK 9084, which also acts at benzodiazepine binding sites, or buspirone. Rates of lever pressing suppressed by punishment were also increased by chlordiazepoxide and zopiclone. CGS 9896 exerted a similar although less marked effect. Lever pressing maintained by a differential reinforcement of low rate 18-sec schedule of milk presentation was increased by low doses of chlordiazepoxide and zopiclone and decreased by higher doses leading to dose-related reductions in numbers of reinforcers obtained. CGS 9896 also reduced number of reinforcers but without affecting rate of responding. In rats trained to discriminate a dose of chlordiazepoxide from saline, chlordiazepoxide, zopiclone, pentobarbital and meprobamate produced chlordiazepoxide-appropriate responding. CGS 9896 also produced chlordiazepoxide-appropriate responding at a wide range of doses although the stimulus properties of this compound appeared to be weaker than those of the other active drugs. Chlordiazepoxide and zopiclone produced dose-related increases in food intake in food-deprived rats. CGS 9896 had similar effects at low doses but its effects were less consistent at higher doses. Thus, zopiclone has a behavioral profile very similar to that of chlordiazepoxide. Although many of the effects of CGS 9896 were similar to those of chlordiazepoxide, a number of differences were also observed.", 
    "2": "Glioma C6 cells were incubated with [14C]arachidonate to label membrane phospholipids. Muscimol, a selective gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor agonist, but not (-)-baclofen, a selective gamma-aminobutyric acid B receptor agonist, stimulates [14C]arachidonate release from C6 cells as a result of hydrolysis of a small pool of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine by phospholipase A2. This release is facilitated by diazepam and a number of other benzodiazepines such as flunitrazepam, medazepam and midazolam (but very little by clonazepam), although these benzodiazepines per se are inactive in causing the release. In addition to increasing the release of [14C]arachidonate, diazepam in the presence of muscimol promotes the release of [14C] prostaglandin D2. Bicuculline inhibits the action of muscimol and facilitation by diazepam. \"Peripheral\" benzodiazepine ligand, RO 5-4864 (4'-chlordiazepam) antagonizes the action of diazepam, whereas \"central\" ligand, RO 15-1788, is inactive. The release of arachidonate metabolites stimulated by muscimol and diazepam is unaffected by Cl- channel blockers, picrotoxin and pentylenetetrazol. Based on these results we propose that in glioma C6 cells (and presumably in normal glia) peripheral benzodiazepine receptor interacts functionally with gamma-aminobutyric acid A type of receptor, which appears not to be linked to picrotoxin sensitive Cl- channel, and may be linked to phospholipase A2.", 
    "3": "Muscimol is one of the most potent agonist ligands at the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor. Analysis of its chemical structure showed it to be a candidate for photoaffinity labeling. In practice, UV irradiation at 254 nm both changed the UV spectrum of muscimol and induced an irreversible binding of [3H]-muscimol to rat cerebellar synaptosomal membrane. After 10 min of irradiation, using 10 nM [3H]muscimol, the specific portion of this binding was 270 fmol/mg protein. (Nonspecific binding was defined as that arising in the presence of 1 mM GABA.) Specific binding increased asymptotically up to 100 nM [3H]muscimol. Irradiation of the membranes themselves did not significantly alter the KD or Bmax of reversible [3H]muscimol binding. However, irradiation of [3H]muscimol reduced its capacity subsequently to photolabel the membranes by 86 +/- 3%. Dose-dependent inhibition of binding was observed with muscimol, GABA, and bicuculline methiodide; with 10 nM [3H]muscimol maximum inhibition was 70% of total labeling and the order of potencies of these three compounds was characteristic of labeling to the GABAA receptor. Baclofen, l-glutamate, and diazepam exerted no effect at high concentrations. SDS-PAGE of the photolabeled membranes indicated specific incorporation of radioactivity into two molecular-weight species. One failed to enter the separating gel, implying a molecular weight greater than 250,000 daltons (250 kD). The molecular weight of the other was identified by fluorography to be about 52,000 daltons (52 kD).", 
    "4": "Clorazepate frequently can control symptoms in complex partial seizure disorders with psychic symptomatology at dosages less than those recommended for its use as an adjunctive anticonvulsant. Four case examples illustrate this use. These beneficial effects may reflect a heightened response by limbic seizure foci to the anticonvulsant effects of nordiazepam, or a potentiation of its anticonvulsant effects through attenuating patient anxiety.", 
    "5": "Two patients treated with alprazolam had histories suggestive of a bipolar disorder and developed lithium-responsive manic episodes. The authors caution that treatment with alprazolam may be complicated by the induction of mania.", 
    "6": "The authors present preliminary data showing that pretreatment levels of urinary 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) were significantly higher in six depressed patients who responded to the antidepressant effects of alprazolam than in six depressed patients who showed no antidepressant response.", 
    "7": "To investigate the effects of zopiclone on the central nervous system, we examined the effects of zopiclone on brain monoamines such as dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA) and serotonin (5-HT) and their metabolites such as homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), as well as locomotor activity in comparison with those of nitrazepam and flurazepam. Zopiclone in a dose of 10 mg/kg (p.o.) significantly reduced it (p less than 0.01) in 30 min and the reduced locomotor activity persisted until 180 min. The reducing effect on locomotor activity by zopiclone was similar to that of nitrazepam and more potent than flurazepam. The effects of zopiclone on brain monoamines (MA) were examined. No significant changes in DA, NA and 5-HT were observed, but HVA and 5-HIAA were reduced. A fluorescent-histochemical study conducted simultaneously revealed almost the same results as the biochemical test results. From the facts that zopiclone inhibited locomotor activity in rats, and inhibited brain DA and 5-HT turnover, the mechanism of action of zopiclone in brain MA neurons seems to be similar to that of benzodiazepine derivatives.", 
    "8": "Subtypes of muscarinic cholinergic receptors have been proposed to exist, but the biochemical responses mediated by the putative subtypes are unknown. In the present study, muscarinic receptor-mediated phosphoinositide breakdown and inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity were characterized in rat brain as well as rat parotid and heart. To study whether these responses are mediated by separate subtypes of muscarinic receptors, the potencies of agonists and antagonists were determined in both assays. Antagonist potencies were calculated by Schild analysis. In the brain, the putatively selective muscarinic receptor antagonist, pirenzepine, exhibited Ki values of 21 nM in the assay of phosphoinositide breakdown and 310 nM in the assay of adenylate cyclase activity. Similarly, using radioligand binding techniques, it distinguished two binding sites with Kd values of 12 and 168 nM. The antagonist, atropine, on the other hand, was equipotent in the two biochemical assays and the radioligand binding assay with Ki values of approximately 1 to 2 nM. In peripheral tissues with robust muscarinic receptor-mediated phosphoinositide (parotid) and adenylate cyclase (heart) responses, pirenzepine exhibited a similar selectivity (19-fold) for the phosphoinositide assay that was seen in the brain, but it was 6- to 7-fold less potent in both peripheral tissues than in the central nervous system. In addition, the potencies of pirenzepine in binding and functional studies in each tissue were not as well correlated as in the brain. Atropine and other antagonists were 4- to 9-fold selective for inhibiting oxotremorine-stimulated phosphoinositide breakdown in the peripheral tissues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "Addition of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) to [3H]-inositol pre-labelled GH3 pituitary tumour cells suspended in medium containing 10mM lithium chloride led to a rapid diminution in cellular [3H]-inositol and increase in [3H]-inositol 1-phosphate (InslP), [3H]-inositol bisphosphate (InsP2) and [3H]-inositol trisphosphate (InsP3). In the presence of the benzodiazepine tranquillizer, chlordiazepoxide, the TRH concentration-response curves for these effects were shifted to the right in a parallel fashion. The Ki for chlordiazepoxide in inhibiting all four responses was 1.5 X 10(-5)M. Chlordiazepoxide did not inhibit the small bombesin-induced rise in [3H]-InslP. Another benzodiazepine, diazepam, was less active. The TRH-induced rise in cytosolic free calcium monitored in Quin-2-loaded GH3 cells was also blocked by chlordiazepoxide in a competitive manner, while that induced by high K+-induced depolarisation was unaffected. It is suggested that chlordiazepoxide acts as a competitive antagonist at the level of the TRH receptor.", 
    "10": "The cerebellar cGMP level in mice was decreased in a dose-dependent manner 30 min after diazepam (ED50 = 2 mg/kg p.o.). This effect was reversed by the specific benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788. Methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) and harmaline increased cGMP. Ro 15-1788 dose dependently counteracted the beta-CCM- but not the harmaline-induced increase in cGMP. In the horizontal wire test Ro 15-1788 antagonized the impairment of motor performance induced by beta-CCM, but not that induced by harmaline. These findings further support the view that harmaline in contrast to beta-carboline-3-carboxylates does not act through benzodiazepine receptors, and that Ro 15-1788 antagonizes only those convulsants and stimulants that act through specific benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "11": "Novel, synthetic cannabimimetics and delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol were found to enhance the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to mouse brain in vivo. This property, suggestive of facilitation of binding to benzodiazepine receptors, is consistent with the potentiation of the anticonvulsant activity of diazepam against pentylenetetrazol by these compounds. The relative potencies of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol and the new cannabimimetics for enhancing [3H]flunitrazepam binding in vivo could also be correlated with their relative analgesic efficacies. Similar pharmacological stereospecificity was displayed for both binding enhancement and analgesic effects. The following order of decreasing potency was observed: N-methyllevonantradol and (-)-CP-55,244 greater than levonantradol, canbisol, CP-42,096 and (-)-CP-55,940 greater than 9-beta-normethyl-9-beta-hydroxyhexahydrocannabinol, nabilone and CP-47,497 greater than delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol. Dextronantradol, (+)-CP-55,940 and (+)-CP-55,244 were considerably less active than the respective (-)-enantiomers; cannabidiol was inactive. Extensive investigation of structure versus activity led to N-methyllevonantradol and the 3-(2-hydroxyphenyl)cyclohexanols derivative, (-)-CP-55,244, which are approximately 1000-fold more potent than delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol.", 
    "12": "The effects of Ro15-1788, a benzodiazepine antagonist, on heart rate and blood pressure were studied in chloralose anesthetized cats. In previously untreated controls, Ro15-1788 lowered both systolic and diastolic arterial pressure about 15 mm Hg, and slightly decreased heart rate. In cats that had been given a single acute dose of diazepam or flurazepam, Ro15-1788 increased blood pressure about 40 mm Hg. A similar increase was measured in cats that were tolerant and physically dependent after 5 weeks of chronic flurazepam treatment. High spinal (C-1) section abolished all Ro15-1788 effects. It is suggested that the observed drug actions occur within the CNS rather than in the periphery, and that it might be useful to study further the cardiovascular actions of benzodiazepine agonists and antagonists.", 
    "13": "Progabide (50 mg/kg, i.p.), a GABA receptor agonist, significantly decreases the median minimal neurotoxic dose (TD50) of clobazam, chlordiazepoxide, and diazepam; the receptor binding of these substances is highly enhanced by muscimol. Progabide has no significant effect on the TD50 of clonazepam and triazolam; the receptor bindings of these substances is either only slightly enhanced or not altered by muscimol. Progabide also significantly decreases the median antimaximal electroshock dose (MES ED50) of all the benzodiazepines tested. However, progabide has no effect on the median antipentylenetetrazol dose (PTZ ED50) of the benzodiazepines. Likewise, THIP (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly decreases the TD50 of chlordiazepoxide but not that of triazolam. THIP significantly decreases the MES ED50 of chlordiazepoxide and triazolam but has no effect on the PTZ ED50 of these two substances. The above data suggest that benzodiazepine receptors linked to GABA receptors contribute to the minimal neurotoxicity and anti-MES activity but not to the anti-PTZ activity of benzodiazepines.", 
    "14": "The effect of suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) ablation on rhythms in brain neurotransmitter receptors was studied. In control animals, the rhythms in the number of alpha-adrenergic and benzodiazepine receptors were circadian, whereas the rhythms in beta-adrenergic and acetylcholine receptors were ultradian. SCN ablation resulted in loss of circadian, but not ultradian, rhythms, without change in the 24-h mean numbers. SCN ablation appears to cause a selective loss of circadian function in the regulation of brain receptors.", 
    "15": "Five cases are reported in which confusional states and total anterograde amnesia occurred after oral intake of recommended doses of midazolam, a new ultra-short acting benzodiazepine. Particular risk factors were not present, and in three out of five patients the complications occurred with the first administration. Analysis of these cases and experimental data reported in the literature suggest that the extreme response curve of midazolam may be responsible for these complications. The potential danger of the patients' actions in these states is pointed out.", 
    "16": "Following a discussion of the diagnostic preconditions that are essential to any treatment of depression, this paper deals with the biologically-based therapies that recommend themselves in psychotherapy. Of chief interest here are the pharmacotherapeutic possibilities and above all the indications of the various antidepressants - many of them new - which are listed together with their German, Austrian and Swiss brand names in Table 8. Some new drugs that are not first and foremost antidepressants are also discussed here, as well as adjunctive medication and treatment of therapy-resistant depression. The main types of chronobiological therapy discussed are sleep deprivation and the use of light in the treatment of depression. Finally, there is a brief outline of shock therapy; for non-medical reasons, this no longer plays an important role today, but is nevertheless an extremely effective method of treating depression.", 
    "17": "1,4-Diazepines with two annelated heterocycles ('hetrazepines') such as brotizolam (WE 941), WE 973 and WE 1008 bind with high affinities to benzodiazepine receptors in the central nervous system. Brotizolam has a pharmacologic spectrum of action similar to clinically useful benzodiazepines, while the closely related derivatives WE 973 and WE 1008 appear to lack hypnotic action. Unlike other benzodiazepine receptor ligands which share common pharmacologic properties with the benzodiazepines, the apparent affinities of WE 973 and WE 1008 are not increased significantly in the presence of GABA, even at an elevated incubation temperature. Furthermore, the apparent affinities of these compounds do not appear to be reduced as a result of increasing the incubation temperature. Brotizolam, like the benzodiazepines, facilitates GABAergic transmission in zona recitulata neurons of the substantia nigra. In contrast, at a dose which inhibits cell firing, WE 973 does not appear to significantly augment the inhibitory action of GABA in these cells. These observations suggest that the so-called 'GABA shift' may not be a valid means of distinguishing benzodiazepine-like compounds in vitro. Furthermore, these data suggest that facilitation of GABAergic transmission may be necessary for the hypnotic action of benzodiazepine receptor ligands, but not for the anticonflict or the anticonvulsant actions of such compounds.", 
    "18": "The administration of diazepam 1.0 mg/kg decreased the level of plasma corticosterone in female but not in male Wistar rats. Picrotoxin, another drug affecting GABAergic transmission, also brought about an increase of plasma corticosterone in both sexes. However, in order to achieve a plasma corticosterone increase of similar magnitude (more than 500%) a threefold higher dose of picrotoxin had to be given to males. When the convulsive properties of picrotoxin were tested, it became evident that the dose of picrotoxin (2.5 mg/kg) which was subconvulsive in male was almost 100% convulsive in female rats. The existing sex differences in the response of rats to drugs affecting GABAergic transmission might have possible implications in the treatment of GABA system dysfunction.", 
    "19": "In decorticate unanaesthetized cats, displaying sequences of stereotyped locomotor movements in response to electrical stimulation of their footpad, local injections were made into the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR). Diazepam (at 10 micrograms) and GABA (at 500 micrograms) induced complete suppression for 5-10 min, followed by partial amplitude recovery. It is suggested that: (i) MLR contains both diazepam and GABA receptors, and (ii) diazepam (and GABA) blockade is only short lasting because of a substitution (vicariancy) process through other structures also involved in locomotion.", 
    "20": "The benzodiazepine midazolam produced an anticonflict effect in rats measured in a water lick paradigm following local injection into the basolateral and lateral complex of the amygdala. This effect of midazolam seems to involve specific benzodiazepine receptors, since the systemic injection of benzodiazepine antagonists Ro 15-1788, ZK 93426, FG 7142 and CGS 8216 produced strong antagonism of the effect of midazolam in doses not affecting the non-punished drinking behaviour.", 
    "21": "GABA, THIP and muscimol enhance spontaneous and inhibit electrically induced release of tritium labelled compounds from rat striatal slices which have been pre-labelled with 3H-choline. Baclofen is inactive in this model. Muscimol can inhibit electrically induced release of tritiated material by approximately 75% with half maximal effects at 2 microM. The response to muscimol can be blocked by the GABA antagonists bicuculline methobromide, picrotoxin, anisatin, R 5135 and CPTBO (cyclopentylbicyclophosphate). Drugs which act on the benzodiazepine receptor (BR) require the presence of muscimol to be effective and they modulate the effects of muscimol in a bidirectional manner. Thus BR agonists enhance and inverse BR agonists attenuate the inhibitory effects of muscimol on electrically induced release. Ro15-1788, a BR antagonist, does not modulate the inhibitory effects of muscimol but antagonizes the actions of clonazepam, a BR agonist, and of DMCM, an inverse BR agonist. These results demonstrate that a GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex can modulate acetylcholine release from rat striatal slices in vitro.", 
    "22": "Isonicotinic hydrazide, a drug that decreases the level of GABA, when injected subcutaneously in control and scrapie-infected hamsters induced tonic-clonic seizures in scrapie hamsters significantly earlier (P less than 0.0001) than in control animals. This suggests depression of the GABAergic system in scrapie-infected hamsters. To determine whether this lesion is pre or postsynaptic we measured the level of GABA, glutamate, cGMP and cAMP and the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "23": "The binding of [3H]Ro 5-4864 to membranes prepared from spinal cord of the adult rat has been studied in vitro. At 4 degrees C, the binding of [3H]Ro 5-4864 reached equilibrium by 120 min, and was rapidly reversible (dissociation t0.5 = 21 min). The [3H]Ro 5-4864 bound with a high affinity (Kd approximately equal to 3 nM) to a single, saturable population of binding sites (Bmax = 27 pmol/g tissue wet weight). Activation of receptors for gamma-aminobutyric acid with 10 microM muscimol did not alter these binding parameters. The drugs Ro 5-4864, diazepam and flunitrazepam were potent inhibitors of this binding (Kis of 10(-9)-10(-8) M) whereas clonazepam, CL 218,872 and Ro 15-1788 were weak inhibitors (Kis greater than 10(-5) M). A comparison of the binding of [3H]Ro 5-4864 in spinal cord with that in other areas of the CNS revealed that whereas the binding affinity was similar in all regions, membranes from spinal cord contained a slightly greater number of binding sites than cerebral cortex and cerebellum, and approximately one-third of the number present in the olfactory bulb. The characteristics of the binding of [3H]Ro 5-4864 obtained in this study are consistent with this ligand binding to peripheral-type benzodiazepine recognition sites in membranes from spinal cord.", 
    "24": "Systematic examination of model-dependent predictions of changes in the hepatic extraction ratio (E), following alteration in the unbound fraction of drug in plasma (fub), should allow sensitive discrimination between the venous equilibrium model (model I) and the sinusoidal perfusion model (model II) of hepatic sinusoidal function if drugs which show high clearance of free drug are used. Analysis of experimental data from the literature confirmed the utility of this approach. Specifically, data related to diazepam (E = 0.95 at fub = 1) clearly conformed to the predictions of the sinusoidal perfusion model and differed markedly from those of the venous equilibrium model. Conversely, data for phenytoin (E = 0.69 at fub = 1) failed to discriminate between models, as predicted by our analysis. We identify a sensitive, convenient method for discrimination between current models of hepatic sinusoidal function and establish for the first time that a drug substrate (diazepam) conforms closely to the predictions of the sinusoidal perfusion model.", 
    "25": "In 63 healthy ambulant subjects 18 to 88 years of age, the plasma protein binding of diazepam (principally bound to albumin) decreased with age. Diazepam binding in plasma correlated positively with plasma albumin concentration which also decreased with age. In contrast, the plasma protein binding of the basic drug, lignocaine (predominantly bound to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein [AAG]), tended to increase slightly with age. Lignocaine binding in plasma correlated positively with plasma AAG concentration which also increased slightly with age. Smoking did not affect the plasma protein binding of diazepam or lignocaine or the plasma concentrations of albumin, AAG or nonesterified fatty acids. These results suggest that age-related changes in plasma protein binding of lignocaine and diazepam are determined in part by age-related changes in the concentrations of the binding proteins in plasma. The ageing process alone causes only small changes in the plasma protein binding of these drugs compared with the effect of disease states, however.", 
    "26": "20 male and 10 female adult, normal, healthy subjects, whose mean age was 26.34 yr., participated in a double-blind study of the effect of a single dose (0.2 mg./kg. of body weight) of diazepam on visuomotor reaction time. Reaction time was measured before drug administration, and 60 min., and 120 min. after administration. Separate reaction times for the dominant and nondominant hand were recorded. There were no significant differences between the diazepam and placebo group at each of the three time intervals. Diazepam in the single dose employed does not appear to affect adversely visuomotor reaction time of relatively young, normal, healthy adults. For both groups the difference in visuomotor reaction time between the dominant hand and the nondominant hand was statistically significant as expected.", 
    "27": "Diazepam, a commonly prescribed tranquilizer, was found to inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis in rat liver minces; inhibition appeared to occur at multiple post-mevalonate sites. Diazepam also inhibited cholesterol esterification by acylCoA:cholesterol acyltransferase in isolated liver microsomes and minces. Liver minces incubated with [14C]oleate demonstrated increased uptake of the fatty acid and a greater incorporation of the substrate into triglycerides, diglycerides and phospholipids when diazepam was present. The results suggest possible mechanisms for the hypocholesterolemic effect of diazepam in experimental animals and for the elevation of triglycerides and very low-density lipoproteins in man and the rat.", 
    "28": "Selected serum enzymes, cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, uric acid, protein, albumin, bilirubin, BUN, hematology, and electrocardiograms (EKG) were obtained from adult male cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis) and adult male stumptailed (Macaca arctoides) macaques. Serum alkaline phosphatase, uric acid, albumin, bilirubin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and monocytes were significantly lower in the cynomogus monkeys. This relationship was reversed for serum levels of triglycerides, phosphorus, red blood cell counts and lymphocytes. EKG analysis revealed significantly increased PR interval and QRS wave duration in the cynomolgus species. However, there were no differences in heart rate. Right axis deviation was common in both species.", 
    "29": "Binding of warfarin, digitoxin, diazepam, salicylate and Phenol Red, individually or in different pair combinations, to defatted human serum albumin at ligand/protein molar ratios less than 1:1 was studied at pH 7.0. The binding was determined by ultrafiltration. Some of the experiments were repeated with the use of equilibrium dialysis in order to strengthen the results. Irrespective of the method used, all ligands bind to one high-affinity binding site with an association constant in the range 10(4)-10(6) M-1. High-affinity binding of the following pair of ligands took place independently: warfarin-Phenol Red, warfarin-diazepam, warfarin-digitoxin and digitoxin-diazepam. Simultaneous binding of warfarin and salicylate led to a mutual decrease in binding of one another, as did simultaneous binding of digitoxin and Phenol Red. Both effects could be accounted for by a coupling constant. The coupling constant is the factor by which the primary association constants are affected; in these examples of anti-co-operativity the factor has a value between 0 and 1. In the first example it was calculated to be 0.8 and in the latter 0.5. Finally, digitoxin and salicylate were found to compete for a common high-affinity binding site. The present findings support the proposal of four separate primary binding sites for warfarin, digitoxin (and salicylate), diazepam and Phenol Red. An attempt to correlate this partial binding model for serum albumin with other models in the literature is made.", 
    "30": "This paper reviews epidemiological factors, drugs taken, management and outcome of 478 children admitted to the Royal Children's Hospital with drug poisoning during the 5 years 1978-82. Accidental ingestion in young children is still common whilst self poisoning is increasing in the age group 8-17 years. Suicide attempts and self destructive ingestion accounted for 11.5% of all cases with two deaths. A significant number in this group were less than 10 years of age. Iatrogenic poisoning accounted for 11% of all cases with metoclopramide or prochlorperazine frequently involved. Benzodiazepines, major tranquillizers and antihistamines were the most commonly taken groups of drugs whilst the greatest number of admissions to Intensive Care Unit were due to tricyclic poisoning. Principles of management are discussed.", 
    "31": "Delivery of diazepam through a polyethylene-lined i.v. administration set and through a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) set was compared. Diazepam was prepared in concentrations of 50 mg/500 mL and 100 mg/500 mL in 0.9% sodium chloride injection and 5% dextrose injection in glass containers. Diazepam concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography at 0 through 5 hours in samples collected simultaneously from the glass solution containers and from the distal ends of a PVC administration set and a polyethylene-lined (non-PVC) set. Flow rates of 50 and 100 mL/hr were tested. For the non-PVC sets, diazepam concentration in the infusate was not significantly different from concentration in the glass container at any sampling time. The overall percentage of diazepam recovered was 100.7 +/- 6.8%. For the PVC sets, diazepam concentration in the infusate was less than in the container at all sampling times, and the overall percentage of diazepam recovered was 65.4 +/- 13.3% (significantly different from delivery for the non-PVC sets). Delivery through the non-PVC sets was not affected by flow rate, type of solution, or concentration of diazepam. For infusion periods of up to five hours, delivery of diazepam through polyethylene-lined i.v. administration sets was superior to delivery through polyvinyl chloride sets.", 
    "32": "The clinical effects of a standard 2 mg flunitrazepam tablet given sublingually for premedication were evaluated in a group of 50 patients undergoing otorhinolaryngologic surgery. A comparable group of 49 patients received 10 mg of diazepam orally. The degree of sedation and anxiety was assessed objectively and subjectively before induction of anaesthesia. Flunitrazepam produced better sedation judged by the observer as well as by the patients. There was less anxiety in the flunitrazepam group but this was not statistically significant. Side effects were few and patient acceptability high. Sublingual premedication using flunitrazepam could be a useful alternative to other forms of premedication.", 
    "33": "Most concern over the untoward effects of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) has concentrated on the hypertensive crises and recently on orthostatic hypotension, hypomania, and sexual dysfunction. However, little has been written about withdrawal effects when MAOIs are discontinued. This article reports an acute organic psychosis marked by visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations after abrupt discontinuation of phenelzine in two young women without previous history of psychotic symptoms.", 
    "34": "Four patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (DSM-III and RDC) were treated in an open trial with alprazolam. Moderate to marked improvement was noted in the degree of obsessionality, anxiety with motor tension, and secondary affective changes. The mixed anxiolytic-antidepressant properties of alprazolam are theorized as the basis for the clinical remissions.", 
    "35": "In order to label D2 dopamine receptors selectively and covalently by means of a photosensitive compound, azidoclebopride was synthesized directly from clebopride. The dissociation constant (KD) of clebopride for the D2 dopamine receptor (canine brain striatum) was 1.5 nM, while that for azidoclebopride was 21 nM. The affinities of both clebopride and azidoclebopride were markedly reduced in the absence of sodium chloride. In the presence of ultraviolet light, azidoclebopride inactivated D2 dopamine receptors irreversibly, as indicated by the inability of the receptors to bind [3H]spiperone. Maximal photoinactivation of about 60% of the D2 dopamine receptors occurred at 1 microM azidoclebopride; 30% of the receptors were inactivated at 80 nM azidoclebopride (pseudo-IC50). Dopamine agonists selectively protected the D2 receptors from being inactivated by azidoclebopride, the order of potency being (-)-N-n-propylnorapomorphine greater than apomorphine greater than (+/-)-6,7-dihydroxy-2-aminotetralin greater than (+)-N-n-propylnorapomorphine greater than dopamine greater than noradrenaline greater than serotonin. Similarly, dopaminergic antagonists prevented the photoinactivation of D2 receptors by azidoclebopride with the following order of potency: spiperone greater than (+)-butaclamol greater than haloperidol greater than clebopride greater than (-)-sulpiride greater than (-)-butaclamol. The degree of D2 dopamine receptor photoinduced inactivation by azidoclebopride was not significantly affected by scavengers such as p-aminobenzoic acid and dithiothreitol. Furthermore, irradiation of striatal membranes with a concentration of azidoclebopride sufficient to inactivate dopamine D2 receptors by 60% did not significantly reduce dopamine D1, serotonin (S2), benzodiazepine, alpha 1- or beta-noradrenergic receptors. This study describes the use of a novel and selective photoaffinity ligand for brain dopamine D2 receptors. The molecule, in radiolabeled form, may aid in the molecular characterization of these receptors.", 
    "36": "A male patient was admitted to the hospital in coma and acute respiratory failure following the oral intake of benzodiazepines and alcohol. On the fourth day after admission, the patient was conscious, results of clinical examination of the respiratory system were normal, and pulmonary ventilation tests and blood gas measurements were within normal limits. However, mouth occlusion pressure and ventilatory response to CO2 were found to be markedly reduced. In the period of weaning the discrepancy between the normal clinical picture and blood gases and the laboratory findings of respiratory depression implies that there is a slowing in recovery of the respiratory center in this type of intoxication.", 
    "37": "The impact of endoscope diameter and the presence of systemic sedation on the cardiopulmonary risk of esophagogastroduodenoscopy was investigated. One hundred and forty-six patients undergoing elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy were randomly assigned to one of three groups which differed in either endoscope diameter or use of sedation: group 1 (8.5-mm endoscope with no sedation), group 2 (8.5-mm endoscope with diazepam), and group 3 (11.5-mm endoscope with diazepam). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was tolerated best by group 2, and this group had the fewest electrocardiographic changes observed on a Holter recording during esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The incidence of electrocardiographic changes during esophagogastroduodenoscopy correlated with patient tolerance (p less than 0.001) and the use of the smaller endoscope (p less than 0.05). The most common arrhythmia was sinus tachycardia (49 patients), but more serious electrocardiographic changes were observed in 21 patients. Serious arrhythmias were more common in patients with a prior history of cardiovascular disease compared with patients with no such history (30% vs. 6%, p less than 0.001). Arterial oxygen desaturation (measured by ear oximetry) during intubation and esophagogastroduodenoscopy was usually modest (2%-5%). However, 16 patients receiving diazepam experienced high levels of desaturation exceeding 7%; this small group of patients also experienced more electrocardiographic changes than other patients. The use of diazepam sedation and an 8.5-mm endoscope may offer the safest and most comfortable combination for most patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Diazepam sedation, however, may represent a potential danger to a small number of patients with marginal baseline arterial saturation.", 
    "38": "This retrospective study includes 15 patients with grand-mal status and 17 patients with a series of grand-mal seizures. 8 patients with a grand-mal status never had seizures before. Encephalitis was the most common cause of a grand-mal status in our patients. As a rule, duration of a grand-mal status was less than 10 hours and comprised 8 seizures on average with seizure intervals less than one hour. The initial treatment of the grand-mal status consisted above all of phenytoin, diazepam or phenobarbital, or a combination of these drugs. 3 patients died within 2 months after the beginning of the status. Series of grand-mal seizures were observed mainly in patients with a preexistent seizure disorder; brain damage of early childhood was the most common cause which could be detected. The duration of a series of grand-mal seizures was 13 hours on the average, comprising 4 seizures with an interval of more than 1 hour. Phenytoin and/or diazepam proved to be an efficient initial medication. One of 17 patients died. The most common provoking factor in case of status and series were medication mistakes. The preferential drugs in the initial treatment of status and series of tonic-clonic seizures are the benzodiazepines (above all, clonazepam and diazepam) and phenytoin. The referral to an intensive-care unit is highly recommended. If seizures persist, treatment is continued with barbiturates (phenobarbital, thiopental).", 
    "39": "In patients with chronic abacterial prostatitis, a double-blind trial of 3 months of treatment with minocycline 100 mg twice daily compared with diazepam 5 mg twice daily was undertaken. The percentage fall in polymorphonuclear leucocyte counts in the expressed prostatic secretions was much more marked after treatment with minocycline than with diazepam. Over a follow-up period of at least 12 months, further treatment was necessary in more patients originally treated with diazepam than with minocycline.", 
    "40": "The colonic motor response to eating requires cholinergic transmission. Recent studies have identified two subclasses of muscarinic receptor, the M1 and the M2 subtype. The aim of this study was to evaluate the muscarinic receptor subtype responsible for mediating the gastrocolonic response. Spike potential (SP) activity and intraluminal pressure were recorded, during fasting and after eating a 1000-kcal mixed meal, from the distal colon of 10 healthy volunteers. In each subject three paired studies were carried out: either atropine (a nonselective antimuscarinic, 1 mg), pirenzepine (a selective M1 antimuscarinic, 10 mg), or saline were infused intravenously before eating, using a double-blind crossover design. The meal significantly increased colonic spike potential activity (17.6 +/- 3.9, SP/30 min) above fasting values (2.7 +/- 0.6, P less than 0.01) in the control study. There was no postprandial increase in spike potential activity (3.3 +/- 0.9, SP/30 min) after atropine. The meal also significantly increased spike potential activity (15.4 +/- 3.3 SP/30 min, P less than 0.01) above fasting levels and equal to that of the controls, in the pirenzepine study. These data suggest that the colonic motor response to eating is mediated through the M2 but not the M1 subtype of muscarinic receptors.", 
    "41": "Two interactive computer programs, INTRAV and ORAL, were written to permit pharmacokinetic modeling of experimental data and to obtain pertinent values based on derived estimates. Both programs utilize BASIC language and were developed on a microcomputer with graphics capability. Drug concentration in blood, plasma, or serum with time following either nonabsorptive (intravenous) or absorptive (oral or intramuscular) administration is input, and a semilogarithmic display of data appears on a cathode-ray tube (CRT). The user selects limits for various linear segments using a movable cursor. On command, coefficients and exponents for the differential equation which describes those limits is computed and a nonlinear curve is fitted through the data set. Results from statistical tests are available in output formats permitting the user to determine the goodness of the selected limits. Commonly used pharmacokinetic parameters are also computed and appear on the output. Numerous graphic output options are also available to permit comparisons between data sets and/or estimates derived from other computer programs. INTRAV and ORAL were compared with the widely used programs CSTRIP, ESTRIP, and NONLIN. Both INTRAV and ORAL gave estimates which were almost identical with CSTRIP and ESTRIP, whereas those obtained with NONLIN were very similar, although not identical.", 
    "42": "Ten otherwise healthy cigarette smokers (mean, 31 cigarettes per day), and ten nonsmoking control volunteers matched for age, weight, and sex received single intravenous doses of diazepam (5 to 10 mg), midazolam (5 mg), and lorazepam (2 mg) on three separate occasions. Kinetics of each benzodiazepine were determined from multiple serum concentrations measured after each dose. In non-smoking vs smoking subjects, there was no significant difference in mean clearance of diazepam (0.44 vs 0.47 ml/min/kg), midazolam (9.6 vs 7.1 ml/min/kg), or lorazepam (0.96 vs 1.08 ml/min/kg). Thus, differences in pharmacokinetics are unlikely to account for altered sensitivity to benzodiazepines that may occur in cigarette smokers.", 
    "43": "A number of investigators have shown compelling evidence for multiplicity of benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors. The present study addresses the query of BDZ receptor heterogeneity, in vitro, with respect to temperature. In competition studies involving rat cerebellar tissue, CL 218,872 produced Hill slopes near unity at both 0 degree C and 37 degrees C. In contrast, similar experiments utilizing cortical tissue from rats and mice produced Hill slopes of 0.69 and 0.66 at 0 degree C and 37 degrees C respectively. 3H-Flunitrazepam-photoaffinity labeling of cortical and cerebellar membranes was conducted at 0 degree C and 37 degrees C. SDS-PAGE fluorographic analyses of photolysed 3H-flunitrazepam (3H-Flu) revealed one intensely labeled 51K band in the cerebellum at both temperatures, which was specifically chased by diazepam. Similar experiments conducted in cortical tissue revealed photoaffinity labeling of at least three distinct macromolecules, one intense 51K and two less intense 55K and 59K bands. Labeling of each of these bands was chased specifically by diazepam. These data, taken together, indicate the existence of regional BDZ receptor heterogeneity under physiological conditions.", 
    "44": "The effects of the acute administration of 2-phenylpyrazolo[4,3-c]quinolin-3(5H)-one on diazepam-induced behaviour and electrophysiological activity were studied in rat. The compound, in doses of 5-10 mg/kg (i.p.), which per se did not induce alterations in spontaneous locomotor activity, antagonised the sedative effect induced by 5-10 mg/kg (i.p.) of diazepam. The injection of diazepam in rats, induced a profound reduction in the first negative wave of the recording of the visual evoked potential used as a sensitive electrophysiological test, in vivo. 2-Phenylpyrazolo[4,3-c]quinolin-3(5H)-one (10 mg/kg, i.p.) caused a recovery of the amplitude of the first negative wave within a few minutes. This result was confirmed by the finding that 2-phenylpyrazolo[4,3-c]quinolin-3(5H)-one, injected acutely in rats, pretreated with diazepam exhibited the capacity to antagonise the binding of [3H]diazepam determined in vitro on synaptic membrane preparations from cortex. The comparison of the pattern of the visual-evoked potential, recorded after the injection of 2-phenylpyrazolo[4,3-c]quinolin-3(5H)-one (50 mg/kg) with the patterns recorded after the injection of ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazolo(1,5a) (1,4)benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (50 mg/kg) and ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate and 1-methyl-beta-carboline demonstrated that 2-phenylpyrazolo[4,3-c]quinolin-3(5H)-one is devoid of intrinsic activity.", 
    "45": "A study was performed to investigate the GABA-mimetic activity of ethylenediamine (EDA) and piperazine at mammalian gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors using radioligand binding assays and in vitro isolated tissues. The potency of ethylenediamine and piperazine as inhibitors of the binding of GABA receptors to synaptic membranes from rat brain was measured in Tris-buffers and Krebs-Henseleit solution (KHS). The potency of ethylenediamine and piperazine at GABAA and ethylenediamine at GABAB receptors was raised if Krebs-Henseleit solution was used for the assay. Piperazine was inactive at GABAB receptors. The potency of the antagonist of GABAA receptors bicuculline methobromide, was also increased in Krebs-Henseleit when compared with Tris-citrate buffer. Of the ions present in Krebs-Henseleit, bicarbonate ions were responsible for the increase in the GABA-mimetic potency of ethylenediamine and piperazine. Addition of either NaHCO3 or KHCO3 (25 mM) to Tris-HCl buffer (for GABAA binding) or Tris-HCl plus 2.5 mM CaCl2 (for GABAB binding) yielded IC50 values similar to those measured in Krebs-Henseleit solution. Bicarbonate ions also enhanced the ability of ethylenediamine to potentiate the binding of [3H]diazepam to membranes from rat brain (raising both the potency of ethylenediamine and its maximum effect) in this system. In the absence of HCO-3 ions, ethylenediamine potentiated the binding of [3H]diazepam by raising the maximum binding capacity (Bmax) without changing the affinity (Kd) of the receptors. Potassium bicarbonate (25 mM) caused ethylenediamine to further potentiate the binding of [3H]diazepam by changing both Bmax and Kd.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "46": "The localization of peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites has been accomplished using quantitative receptor autoradiography after labeling slide-mounted tissue sections with [3H]-RO 5-4864. Specific [3H]-RO 5-4864 binding sites were observed in the choroid plexus and ependyma cells within the brain. Lower levels of specific binding were seen in areas corresponding to the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb. Stereotaxic administration of the excitotoxin, ibotenic acid, into the piriform cortex produced a dramatic increase in binding to the peripheral-type site in this brain region. Binding in the kidney was associated with the ascending limb of the loop of Henle and the distal convoluted tubule, while in the heart a more diffuse binding was found throughout the ventricle wall. The localization of peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites to areas involved in ion transport gives additional support to previously suggested physiological roles for these sites.",

[3H]Flunitrazepam binding to whole brain homogenates from 2-day-old chicks and [3H]diazepam binding to synaptosomal membranes and homogenates from adult chickens were determined. Scatchard analysis revealed no differences in either the number of receptors or their affinity for the ligands when the epileptics were sacrificed in the interictal state. Evoked seizures in adult epileptics had no effect on the number or affinity of binding sites using [3H]diazepam as the ligand. Moreover, the ability of gamma-aminobutyric acid to facilitate benzodiazepine binding was not different in epileptic fowl when compared with carriers.", 
    "49": "The effects in mice of administration of the anticonvulsants, progabide, sodium valproate, diazepam, carbamazepine and phenytoin on 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)-induced head-twitch, apomorphine-induced locomotion, clonidine-induced sedation, and beta-adrenoceptor and 5-HT2 receptor number have been examined. Repeated progabide administration (400 mg kg-1, i.p. twice daily for 14 days) enhanced the head-twitch response the effect lasting for over 8 days after the last dose, and also increased 5-HT2 receptor number in frontal cortex. Progabide (400 mg kg-1, i.p.) enhanced the head-twitch response when given once daily for 10 days and when given intermittently (5 times over 10 days) but not after 1 day of administration. Repeated Na valproate (400 mg kg-1, i.p.) also increased the 5-HTP-induced head-twitch response and 5-HT2 receptor number in the frontal cortex when given twice daily for 14 days, but no behavioural enhancement was seen after 10 days' treatment. Diazepam (1.25 mg kg-1, i.p.) twice daily for 14 days increased the head-twitch response and 5-HT2 receptor number. Repeated progabide and valproate (but not diazepam) administration attenuated the sedation response to the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine (0.15 mg kg-1) but neither drug altered beta-adrenoceptor number in the cerebral cortex. No changes in apomorphine-induced locomotor behaviour were seen after progabide, valproate or diazepam. Repeated carbamazepine (20 mg kg-1) or phenytoin (40 mg kg-1) administration failed to alter any of the biochemical or behavioural parameters listed above. Like repeated electroconvulsive shock (ECS), progabide altered the head-twitch response, clonidine-induced sedation response and 5-HT2 receptor number. Unlike repeated ECS, it did not alter beta-adrenoceptor number or the apomorphine-induced locomotor response. These data suggest that ECS may produce some changes in monoamine function by altering GABA metabolism as has previously been postulated.", 
    "50": "A behavioral and physiological syndrome of stress-related responses was reported in primates following treatment with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (beta-CCE). The behavioral and physiological effects of beta-CCE are similar to those observed during stressful or \"anxiety\"-related conditions characterized in rhesus monkeys under natural conditions. Pharmacological agents which are known to antagonize anxiety responses in other paradigms were tested for their ability to antagonize the actions of beta-CCE. Diazepam (1 mg/kg) completely blocked the effects of beta-CCE (200 micrograms/kg) on anxiety-related behaviors, heart rate and blood pressure, plasma catecholamines, cortisol, and adrenocorticotrophic hormone. A presynaptically active dose of the alpha-adrenoreceptor agonist, clonidine (10 micrograms/kg), significantly attenuated the effects of beta-CCE on all parameters, whereas the beta-adrenoreceptor agonist, propranolol (3 mg/kg), failed to alter the increases in plasma catecholamines, cortisol, or ACTH. In addition to these adrenergic agents, the serotonin antagonist, cyproheptadine (1 mg/kg), and the GABA-mimetic, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo(5,4-C)pyrindin-3-ol (1 mg/kg), partially blocked the behavioral, physiological, and biochemical changes after beta-CCE. Manifestation of the complete \"anxiety\" syndrome evoked by beta-CCE in primates may require the functional activity of several neurotransmitter systems.", 
    "51": "Murine neuroblastoma cells (clone N1E-115) possess muscarinic receptors that mediate multiple responses, including the elevation of cyclic GMP levels and the inhibition of receptor-mediated increases in cyclic AMP. Evidence is presented showing that two muscarinic agonist-receptor conformations in N1E-115 cells each separately mediate a cyclic nucleotide response. Pirenzepine inhibited the [3H]cyclic GMP response to carbachol with a KD value of approximately 6 nM, whereas it inhibited the ability of carbachol to reduce prostaglandin E1-mediated elevations in [3H]cyclic AMP levels with a KD value of 93 nM, thus differentiating between two classes of receptors involved in these responses. Ten muscarinic agonists were studied for their ability to mediate the two cyclic nucleotide responses. Six were as effective as acetylcholine in the reduction of [3H]cyclic AMP levels, but only two were as effective as acetylcholine in elevating [3H]cyclic GMP levels. Four agonists (arecoline, pilocarpine, oxotremorine, and McN-A343) were ineffective in increasing [3H]cyclic GMP levels. These four agonists and bethanecol, which could increase [3H]cyclic GMP levels only 18% as well as acetylcholine, behaved as competitive antagonists in this response to carbachol. These partial agonists, in contrast to carbachol, bound to only one class of muscarinic sites in N1E-115 cells with equilibrium dissociation constants determined by competition binding assays which agreed well with their respective EC50 values for their effect on [3H]cyclic AMP levels. The equilibrium dissociation constants for the partial agonists determined by their inhibition of carbachol in the [3H] cyclic GMP response also agreed well with their respective EC50 values for mediating the [3H]cyclic AMP response. Thus, the partial agonists bound to the same receptors at which carbachol mediated [3H]cyclic GMP formation, but with KD values about the same as their respective EC50 values for inhibition of prostaglandin E1-mediated [3H]cyclic AMP increases. The full agonists acetylcholine and methacholine, like carbachol, bound to two sites in N1E-115 cells. For the six agonists able to stimulate both responses at least to some degree, the ratio of their potencies at each response correlated with their respective efficacies at each response but with much more dependence in the [3H]cyclic GMP response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "52": "We have used [3H]Ro5-4864, a ligand selective for peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors, to identify and localize peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors in endocrine organs. Autoradiographic studies reveal an uniform distribution of [3H]Ro5-4864 binding sites within the anterior, intermediate, and posterior lobes of the pituitary gland, with highest concentrations present in the posterior pituitary. In rat adrenal gland, specific binding sites for [3H]Ro5-4864 are found only in the adrenal cortex, with highest density in the zona glomerulosa and significantly lower concentrations in the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis. [3H]Ro5-4864-associated silver grains in the testis are intensely localized over the interstitial tissue; low concentrations of silver grains are present over the epithelium of the seminiferous tubules but are absent from the tubular lumen. These studies demonstrate a differential and discrete localization of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors in rat pituitary, adrenal, and testis.",

Temazepam induced a dose-dependent and reversible increase of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzymes in the rat, dose-correlated increase of dimethadione/trimethadione ratios in plasma of the rat, and dose-related shortening of hexobarbital-induced sleeping time in the mouse. In this study trimethadione is considered a good indicator for estimating the state of hepatic enzyme induction.", 
    "54": "Interaction studies between different injectable benzodiazepines and vecuronium, a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug, were performed in the rat in vivo sciatic nerve-tibialis anterior muscle preparation. The investigated doses were aimed to be \"sedative\" in the rat. A significant antagonism of a steady state depression of the twitch height induced by vecuronium was observed during approximately 10 min after i.v. injection of those benzodiazepines containing organic solvents in their formulations (diazepam, desmethyldiazepam, oxazepam, temazepam, lorazepam and lormetazepam). This antagonism is mainly due to propylene glycol, the main organic solvent for the poorly water-soluble benzodiazepines. After the initial antagonism, a potentiation of the vecuronium-induced depression occurred with some of these benzodiazepines (diazepam, desmethyldiazepam, temazepam and lormetazepam). Two water-soluble benzodiazepines, midazolam and flurazepam, caused a significant potentiation of the vecuronium-induced block. Important side-effects (blood pressure drop, convulsions, hematuria) were observed with the amount of propylene glycol present in the investigated formulation of lormetazepam.", 
    "55": "The (+) and (-) isomers of tifluadom were assessed in rats for their opioid activities. In vitro (+)-tifluadom was almost equipotent at mu- and kappa- sites and about 10 times less potent at delta-sites: (-)-tifluadom had the same binding spectrum but was 10-20 times less potent. In vivo (+)-tifluadom delayed the hot-plate reaction time; this effect was antagonized by naloxone, but not by Ro 15-1788. (-)-Tifluadom up to 20 mg/kg had no antinociceptive effect. In the intestinal transit test analgesic doses of (+)-tifluadom did not delay the intestinal transit of a charcoal meal in rats and had weak antagonist activity against morphine-induced inhibition of intestinal transit, whereas (-)-tifluadom had neither agonist nor antagonist effect. It thus appears that (+)-and (-)-tifluadom are not selective in vitro and in vivo for one type of opioid binding site/receptor.", 
    "56": "A perturbation of excitable membranes mediated by non-receptor (non-specific) mechanisms might be predicted from the hydrophobic nature of 1,4-benzodiazepines. Since correlations between membrane properties and neuronal effects have not been described for benzodiazepines, the effects of flurazepam, oxazepam and the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazepil (Ro 15-1788) were examined on both passive and active electrical properties of the membrane and neuronal discharge frequency. In this study, the isolated sensory neuron of the crayfish has been utilized as a neuronal model system. Flurazepam and flumazepil both enhanced the discharge frequency, in contrast to the depression produced by oxazepam. Discharge frequency was directly correlated with the maximum rate of rise of membrane potential during the threshold phase and was inversely correlated with spike threshold. In addition, the discharge frequency appeared to exhibit little dependence on peak amplitude, duration and the maximum rate of depolarization of the action potential. These findings are discussed in relation to non-specific mechanism(s) of action for benzodiazepines. It is suggested that, in the absence of a specific drug-receptor interaction, benzodiazepines in larger concentrations (greater than or equal to 50 mumol/l) exhibit selective membrane perturbations.", 
    "57": "One hundred and thirty-nine patients with endoscopically confirmed peptic ulcers (gastric and duodenal) entered a double blind comparative evaluation of alprazolam (1.2 mg/day), gefarnate (300 mg/day) and their combination in treatment of peptic ulcer. Healing of ulcers was confirmed by endoscopic examinations. For evaluation of the treatment effect, the \"life table\" method was applied to the analysis of the data. The results revealed that ulcer healing with the combination was faster by two weeks than that with alprazolam or gefarnate alone. The difference did not reach the statistical significance in all the subjects who fulfilled the entry criteria. There was, however, a statistical difference between treatments in the patients having manifest psychic symptoms such as anxiety, insomnia and depressive mood (p less than 0.05 by generalized Kruskal-Wallis test and p less than 0.1 by Logrank test). The rate of patients who had psychic symptoms before entry and had not been cured of ulcers at the 4th week of treatment was 61% on the combination treatment as compared to 96% on the gefarnate treatment and 93% on the alprazolam treatment.",

Subjects were 53 healthy university students, screened for history of neurological or psychiatric illness. In comparison to placebo-treated controls, there was no difference in the effects on neuropsychological performance, although subjects who received flurazepam reported more side effects. It was concluded that although these drugs may produce side effects, single doses do not appear to impair various aspects of neuropsychological ability the morning after ingestion.", 
    "59": "We examined the relative clinical efficacy of three commonly used antianxiety medications and a placebo as adjuncts to analgesic treatment of chronic cancer and arthritic pain. Nine patients with chronic pain, including six with malignancy and three with rheumatic diseases, were each exposed to three treatment phases with antianxiety drugs (hydroxyzine, prochlorperazine, and chlordiazepoxide) and one placebo phase in a double-blind, counter-balanced design. Each phase lasted 2 weeks, with analgesic medication given throughout. Pre- and post-phase measures of anxiety, depression, and hostility were taken, together with daily reports by the patients on pain, mood, and medication intake. None of the antianxiety drugs were significantly more effective than the placebo in reducing pain levels, daily medication usage or hostility. Chlordiazepoxide significantly reduced anxiety and depression compared with the placebo, but also produced the most side effects (e.g., drowsiness). The preliminary findings failed to support the efficacy of the three antianxiety medications as analgesic adjuncts.",

The study was conducted in three treatment centers during a six-week period. All three active medications produced significantly more clinical improvement than did placebo, irrespective of the patient's initial anxiety, depression, and psychomotor retardation and irrespective of the patient's assignment to various subtypes of depression, including the DSM-III melancholia subtype. Compared with placebo, sedation was reported more frequently with all three medications, whereas anticholinergic effects were reported more frequently only for the two tricyclic antidepressants, but not for alprazolam.", 
    "61": "Several different drugs are now used, or are potentially useful, to treat patients with spasticity. Although these compounds vary in their actions on spinal neurons and reflex arcs, it is possible to formulate reasonable hypotheses regarding their modes of action. The benzodiazepines bind to specific benzodiazepine receptors linked to classic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors located on the terminals of primary afferent fibers. This binding results in an increased affinity of the GABA receptor for the amino acid, an augmented flux of chloride ions across the terminal membrane, and an increase in the amount of presynaptic inhibition. Baclofen activates GABAB receptors putatively located on the same terminals. Activation of these receptors retards the influx of calcium ions into the terminals, thereby reducing the evoked release of excitatory amino acids and possibly other transmitters. Progabide and its metabolites act on both classic and GABAB receptors. Glycine works on specific inhibitory receptors located on spinal interneurons and motoneurons. The phenothiazines act on the brainstem to alter the function of fusimotor fibers. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce the afferent output of muscle spindles. Dantrolene diminishes the activation of the contractile process in muscle fibers by reducing the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This review summarizes the data supporting these concepts.", 
    "62": "The purpose of these experiments was to analyze the cerebrovascular and cerebral metabolic effects of midazolam, a short-acting water-soluble benzodiazepine, and to investigate its interaction with alcohol in rats. A benzodiazepine antagonist, 3-carbo-t-butoxy-beta-carboline (beta-CCT), was used to test the role of the benzodiazepine receptor in midazolam-alcohol effects. Experiments were carried out under 70% N2O, 30% O2 anesthesia. Rats were tested with intraperitoneal injections of 0.75-5 mg/g ethanol, intravenous infusions of 0.57, 5.75 mg/kg midazolam, and 1.15 mg/kg beta-CCT separately and in combination. Cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured with radioactive microspheres, and cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2) was determined from cortical CBF and arterial-sagittal sinus blood samples 20 min after ethanol treatment and/or after a 15-min drug infusion. Alcohol alone produced dose-related increases in plasma ethanol concentrations but no depression in CMRO2 except at the highest dose (5 mg/g). Midazolam infusions alone decreased cortical CBF and CMRO2 35-40%, while 2.5 mg/g alcohol (which did not depress CMRO2 alone) combined with midazolam produced a 70% depression of cortical CBF and metabolism. An infusion of beta-CCT given alone increased CMRO2 alone and reversed the depression in both cortical CBF and CMRO2 produced by midazolam plus alcohol. These results indicate that the ability of alcohol to potentiate benzodiazepine-induced sedation is not simply an additive effect but may be related to the facilitation by alcohol of benzodiazepine receptor binding. The fact that beta-CCT reversed midazolam-ethanol-induced depression suggests that the effect may be mediated through the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "63": "Pirenzepine, a newly described antagonist of selective muscarinic receptors (M1), has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of acid secretion. To determine whether this property of pirenzepine can be explained in part by its actions on hormones regulating acid secretion, we examined pirenzepine's effects on gastrin and somatostatinlike immunoreactivity (SLI) secretion from the isolated, perfused rat stomach. Carbachol at a dose of 10(-6) M inhibited SLI and stimulated gastrin secretion. Both atropine and pirenzepine reversed these effects in a dose-dependent fashion with D50 values of 1 X 10(-9) and 1 X 10(-7) M, respectively, against gastrin stimulation and 1 X 10(-8) and 1 X 10(-7) M, respectively, against SLI inhibition. Pirenzepine caused a progressive parallel rightward shift in the dose-response curves for SLI inhibition and gastrin stimulation by carbachol, suggesting competitive inhibition. The apparent inhibitory constant (ki) was calculated to be approximately 2 X 10(-9) M. These results indicate that gastrin and SLI release from the stomach is governed by high-affinity muscarinic receptors that are sensitive to pirenzepine. Pirenzepine's action as an acid secretory inhibitor, and possibly as an ulcer therapy drug, may be explained in part by these effects on gastric hormone regulation.", 
    "64": "The effect of several muscarine receptor antagonists on responses to carbachol (CCh) and McN-A-343 (McN) were compared in the perfused rabbit ear artery preparation stimulated via noradrenergic nerves at 3 Hz in the presence of cocaine (10 microM) and yohimbine (1 microM). The slope of the dose-response curve to McN was significantly less (P less than 0.05) than that for CCh although both agonists produced up to 100% inhibition of responses to nervous stimulation. All the antagonists investigated produced parallel shifts of the dose-response curve to the agonists and atropine, fenipramide or stercuronium gave a similar pA2 value with either agonist. Pirenzepine was a competitive antagonist when CCh was used, as judged by a slope of 0.96 +/- 0.10 for the Arunlakshana-Schild (A-S) plot (pKB 6.2). Displacement of 3H-(-)QNB binding by pirenzepine gave a pKI value of 6.0 which was not significantly different to the pKB value. When McN was used as the agonist, the dose-ratios obtained with pirenzepine (0.5 microM) were significantly different (P less than 0.01) to those with CCh as agonist and the slope of the A-S plot over the concentration range of 0.1 to 3 microM was significantly less than 1.0 (P less than 0.01), indicating that the inhibition was not a simple competitive interaction. It is suggested that the interaction of McN and pirenzepine may involve an allosteric mechanism.", 
    "65": "Histopathological analyses of brains of rats receiving a single 0.9 LD50 injection of soman, a potent anticholinesterase neurotoxin, revealed massive widespread lesions in the cerebral cortex and thalamus 4 weeks post-injection. Such lesions were not evidenced in rats receiving diazepam (2.2 mg/kg, i.m.) 10 min prior to soman treatment. Thus, anticonvulsant antidotes may aid in preventing extensive or permanent brain damage in rats surviving near-lethal soman dosages.", 
    "66": "Heterogeneity of muscarinic cholinergic receptors was investigated in chick embryo retina throughout development and in chicks immediately after hatching. The presence of a homogeneous receptor population was evidenced by antagonist binding. The affinity of antagonists increased up to day 14 of incubation, when synaptogenesis occurs. After this stage, it remained substantially unchanged. The number of receptors increased in embryos until hatching. On the contrary, agonists, such as acetylcholine and carbachol, bound to two (high- and low-affinity) binding sites. Through development, the affinity of both significantly increased until day 14, further substantiating the hypothesis of a maturation of the receptor pattern which precedes synapse formation. Muscarinic cholinergic binding seems to identify 3 critical steps in retinal neuronal development. The first is between 7 and 9 days of incubation, the second when synaptogenesis occurs and the third after initiation of function.", 
    "67": "(+)-cis-[3H]Methyldioxolane ((+)-[3H]CD), a potent muscarinic agonist, was used to label high-affinity agonist states of muscarinic receptors in thin tissue sections of the rat central nervous system. Light microscopic autoradiography of atropine-sensitive (+)-[3H]CD binding sites revealed regions of dense labeling (superior colliculus, inferior colliculus, lateral geniculate body, hypoglossal (XII) nucleus, facial (VII) nucleus, tractus diagonalis) and regions of sparse labeling (hippocampus, dentate gyrus). The inverse regional correlation between high-affinity (+)-[3H]CD states and binding sites for the muscarinic antagonists [3H]pirenzepine (r = -0.79) and (-)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (r = -0.30) underscores potentially important differences between agonist and antagonist binding to CNS tissue slices.", 
    "68": "3H-GABA binding was studied in cortical membranes from cerebral cortex of handling-habituated and naive rats after the in vitro addition of Ro15-1788. At low concentrations (10(-8), 10(-9) M) Ro15-1788 increased the total number of low affinity 3H-GABA binding sites in brain tissue from naive rats but failed to modify 3H-GABA binding in tissue from handling-habituated ones. On the contrary, Ro15-1788 at higher concentrations (10(-5), 10(-6)M) decreased the total number of low affinity 3H-GABA binding sites in tissue from handling-habituated rats but failed to modify 3H-GABA binding in tissue from naive animals. Ro15-1788 (10(-7)M) failed to modify significantly low affinity 3H-GABA binding in membranes from both naive and handling-habituated rats. However, this concentration abolished the effect of beta-carbolines and diazepam on 3H-GABA binding in membranes from naive and handling-habituated rats, respectively. The changes in the affinity of 3H-GABA binding were inversely related to the changes in the number. The results suggest that: a) the action \"in vitro\" of Ro15-1788 on low affinity 3H-GABA binding depends from its concentration at the benzodiazepine recognition sites; b) the benzodiazepine recognition site has a modulatory role in the control of the function of GABA-ergic receptor. Our data might explain the conflicting results obtained with this compound \"in vivo\".", 
    "69": "Spontaneous epileptiform activity (SEA) develops in area CA1 of hippocampal slices, when the Ca2+ concentration in the perfusate is lowered to 0.2 mM, at which level evoked chemical synaptic transmission is blocked. We investigated the effects of different anticonvulsants on this autonomous activity, in order to determine whether the antiepileptic effect can be ascribed to an influence on neuronal excitability. Carbamazepine was the most effective to block SEA at concentrations of 1-15 microM. Phenobarbital and phenytoin depressed SEA at concentrations of 25 microM. Valproate was effective at concentrations of 2-5 mM. Midazolam, a water-soluble benzo-diazepine agonist and the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists, DL-alpha-aminoadipic acid and 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid were ineffective in blocking SEA suggesting that they exert their antiepileptic action by interference with synaptic mechanisms.", 
    "70": "PK 11195, an antagonist of the peripheral type benzodiazepine receptor, does not affect either the duration of the action potential or the tension of the guinea pig papillary muscle. However, it antagonized the effects of the calcium channel blockers, nitrendipine, verapamil, diltiazem, and of BAY K8644, a calcium channel agonist in this heart preparation. On the other hand, PK 11195 does not change the increase in the action potential duration provoked by the potassium channel blocker tetraethylammonium. RO5-4864, an agonist of the peripheral type benzodiazepine receptor, decreased the tension of the guinea pig papillary muscle. The effect was reversed by increasing extracellular Ca2+ concentrations up to 4 mM. These results suggest that in the heart the peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors are coupled to calcium channels.", 
    "71": "Both barbiturates and ethanol have been reported to interact with the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor-chloride ionophore 'supramolecular complex'. These observations raise the possibility that some of the pharmacologic actions of barbiturates and ethanol may be mediated through this complex. In this study we have administered a series of drugs which bind to various components of the complex in an attempt to antagonize the lethality of sodium pentobarbital, and ethanol-induced loss of righting reflex in mice. It was found that isopropylbicyclophosphate (IPPO), a cage convulsant which binds at or near the chloride ionophore, greatly reduces the overall mortality (and increases latency to death) of animals pretreated with a lethal dose of pentobarbital. Picrotoxin also decreases pentobarbital lethality, but only at doses which were usually lethal when given alone. Picrotoxin shortened, rather than increased, latency to death. Strychnine did not prevent pentobarbital lethality, suggesting that the IPPO effect is not shared by convulsants in general. IPPO did not prevent ketamine-induced deaths, which supports the notion that the protective actions of IPPO are specific for depressant drugs which act at the chloride ionophore. IPPO also significantly reduced the duration of loss of righting reflex induced by ethanol. These observations suggest that the use of compounds which have a high affinity for the chloride ionophore in vitro might be fruitful in developing a clinical treatment for barbiturate or ethanol toxicity.", 
    "72": "\"Peripheral type\" benzodiazepine binding sites have been solubilized with digitonin. Binding site density for the solubilized material is increased 1.7 times compared to membranes. A decrease in the affinity for [3H]-PK 11195 (a new ligand for the peripheral type benzodiazepine binding sites) was also observed. Pharmacological specificity of displacing agents was conserved during solubilization. The apparent molecular weight determined by gel filtration was 215,000 +/- 20,000. The high Bmax value of the solubilized preparation (greater than 50 pmole/mg protein) makes it advantageous as the starting point for a purification procedure.", 
    "73": "Benzodiazepine receptor binding was examined in rats at 3 stages of amygdaloid kindling (i.e., initial afterdischarge, Stage 3 and Stage 5) immediately or 24 hr after seizure. 3H-diazepam binding site density (Bmax) was significantly increased 24 hr after Stage 3 and Stage 5 kindled seizures in the hippocampus but not in the amygdala. There were no significant differences in the dissociation constants (KD) between kindled and control rats at any time point examined for either brain region. These results demonstrate that changes in benzodiazepine binding are observed with partial kindled seizures (i.e., Stage 3), indicating that generalized seizures are not prerequisite to increased benzodiazepine receptor site density.", 
    "74": "Experiments were carried out to study the relationship between binding affinity to the benzodiazepine receptor and pharmacological activity, especially anti-anxiety activity, of clinically useful benzodiazepines. In the in vitro experiments, fludiazepam showed the highest affinity to the benzodiazepine receptor with 4 times more potency than that of diazepam, which paralleled the in vivo activity. Diazepam and nimetazepam also bound with high affinities as expected from their in vivo activities. On the contrary, medazepam and cloxazolam showed extremely low affinities and oxazolam showed no affinity, although they showed moderate in vivo activity. However, their metabolites were found to have both high affinity and in vivo activities. These results strongly suggest that in the case of medazepam, cloxazolam and oxazolam, their metabolites may bind to receptor sites in the brain and then elicit pharmacological action. This conclusion was supported by the fact that a good correlation between the binding affinity and the anti-anxiety activity of the tested compounds was observed.", 
    "75": "A case is reported of profound accidental hypothermia with spontaneous cardiac activity in a patient presenting several risk factors. The rewarming from 23.5 degrees C to 36.5 degrees C by partial cardio-pulmonary bypass was carried out without complications and in particular without cardiac arrythmia. As far as we are aware this is the twelfth case of profound accidental hypothermia reported in the literature in which rewarming was carried out by this method and the fourth case not involving cardiac arrest. Rapid rewarming by partial cardio-pulmonary bypass could be useful in patients with profound accidental hypothermia without cardiac arrest, the most serious complication being, precisely, cardiac arrest during rewarming."
