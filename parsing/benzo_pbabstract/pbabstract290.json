Changes from baseline to minimum and maximum QTc were tested for significance, and baseline to acute-phase endpoint change in mean QTc was tested for significance within treatments and for differences between olanzapine and comparators.

The patients were divided into 3 groups by diagnosis: GAD alone (N = 18 at intake, N =11 at follow-up), GAD comorbid with another anxiety disorder (N = 84 at intake, N = 52 at follow-up), and GAD comorbid with Research Diagnostic Criteria-defined major depressive disorder, with or without another anxiety disorder (N = 65 at intake, N = 40 at follow-up). The groups were evaluated at intake and follow-up on whether they received medication and the types of medication they received.",

There was a decrease in benzodiazepine treatment and an increase in antidepressant treatment in 1996 for GAD patients who did not have comorbid depression or another anxiety disorder.", 
    "11": "The finding of one quarter to one third of patients with GAD receiving no medication is consistent with previous observations of undertreatment of depression.

    "12": "The catalytic rates of hydrolysis of lorazepam-glucuronide, oxazepam-glucuronide, and temazepam-glucuronide when catalyzed by E. Coli. beta-glucuronidase both in phosphate buffer and buffered drug-free urine were compared as well as the pH dependence of enzyme activity. In 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.4, lorazepam-glucuronide has the highest turnover rate of 3.7 s(-1) with an associated Km of about 100 microM, followed by oxazepam-glucuronide, which has a turnover rate of 2.4 s(-1) with an associated Km of 60 microM. Temazepam-glucuronide has the lowest rate of 0.94 s(-1) with an associated Km of 34 microM. In buffered drug-free urine, a similar trend was observed. In addition, an optimal pH for beta-glucuronidase was determined to be between 6 and 7 when the enzyme hydrolyzes the benzodiazepine conjugates in buffered drug-free urine. Effects of temperature and incubation time were also examined. It can be concluded that the electron donating or withdrawing of the individual benzodiazepine structure may play an important role in the reactivity of the lorazepam-glucuronide, oxazepam-glucuronide and temazepam-glucuronide catalyzed by beta-glucuronidase. This is consistent with other observations made for monosubstituted phenyl-beta-glucuronides by Wang et al. (1).", 
    "13": "Repeated administration of nicotine causes a tremor only in the tail (tail-tremor) of rats. The tremor is accompanied with locomotor hyperactivity without rigidity and immobility of the whole body, suggesting the involvement of the mechanism associated with the movement. The tail-tremor induced by nicotine was suppressed by nicotinic acethylcholine (nACh) receptor antagonists, but not by muscarinic acethylcholine (mACh) receptor antagonists. Moreover, the tail-tremor was suppressed by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and benzodizepines. The tremor at rest is observed only in Parkinson's disease, which is improved by the use of mACh receptor antagonists. An essential tremor is one of the typical tremor connected with the movement (postural tremor) and improved with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. These findings and results suggest that the nicotine-induced tail-tremor is useful for the study of the essential tremor as an animal model. On the other hand, daily administration of nicotine resulted in an augmentation of the tail-tremor. The development of the tail-tremor was suppressed by nACh receptor antagonists, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists and nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitors. These results suggest that central nACh receptors are essential for the onset and further development of the tail-tremor induced by repeated administration of nicotine, and that NO formation mediated by NMDA receptors is involved in the developmental mechanisms.",

Alprazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine commonly prescribed for the treatment of anxiety disorders and a potential comedication in patients with IBS. Alprazolam is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4. This clinical study was conducted to assess the potential for a metabolic drug interaction between these two CYP3A4 substrates. This was an open-label, randomized, two-period, crossover study in 12 healthy female and male volunteers to determine the effect of concomitant administration of alosetron at the recommended dose of 1 mg p.o. bid on the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam following a single oral 1 mg dose. The results showed no effect of alosetron on the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam. Mean alprazolam AUC was 210 and 202 ng.h/mL in the absence and the presence of alosetron, respectively. Therefore, alprazolam may be safely coadministered with alosetron without the need for dosage adjustment.",

However, no statistically significant associations with either bipolar disorders or depressive disorders were observed in the allele frequencies, genotype counts, or haplotype distributions for the two variations, although the present sample size had a moderate power (0.46-0.86).

    "18": "The repeated testing of a null univariate hypothesis in each of many sites (either regions of interest or voxels) is a common approach to the statistical analysis of brain functional images. Procedures, such as the Bonferroni, are available to maintain the Type I error of the set of tests at a specified level. An initial assumption of these methods is a \"global null hypothesis,\" i.e., the statistics computed on each site are assumed to be generated by null distributions. This framework may be too conservative when a significant proportion of the sites is affected by the experimental manipulation. This report presents the development of a rigorous statistical procedure for use with a previously reported graphical method, the P plot, for estimation of the number of \"true\" null hypotheses in the set. This estimate can then be used to sharpen existing multiple comparison procedures. Performance of the P plot method in the multiple comparison problem is investigated in simulation studies and in the analysis of autoradiographic data.",

Compound A inhibited [(3)H]NMS binding to cloned human muscarinic m1, m2, m3, m4, and m5 receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells with K(i) values (nM) of 1.5, 540, 2.8, 15, and 7.7, respectively. In isolated rat tissues, compound A inhibited carbachol-induced responses with 540-fold selectivity for trachea (K(B) = 1.2 nM) over atria (K(B) = 650 nM). In in vivo rat assays, compound A inhibited acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction and bradycardia with intravenous ED(50) values of 0.022 mg/kg and >/=10 mg/kg, respectively. Furthermore, in dogs, compound A (0.1-1 mg/kg p.o.) dose dependently shifted the methacholine concentration-respiratory resistance curves. In mice, compound A (10 mg/kg i.v.) did not inhibit oxotremorine-induced tremor. The brain/plasma ratio (K(p)) of compound A (3 mg/kg i.v.) was 0.13 in rats; this K(p) was less than that of scopolamine (1.7) and darifenacin (0.24). The inhibition of compound A (3 mg/kg i.v.) on ex vivo binding in rat cerebral cortex was almost similar to that of NMS. These findings demonstrate that compound A has high selectivity for M(3) receptors over M(2) receptors, displays a potent, oral M(3) antagonistic activity without inhibition of central muscarinic receptors because of low brain penetration. It is well known that central muscarinic antagonists may have diverse CNS effects, and M(2) receptors regulate cardiac pacing and act as autoreceptors in the lung and bladder. Thus, compound A may have fewer cardiac or CNS side effects than nonselective compounds.",

Olanzapine and risperidone, but not quetiapine, significantly increased D(2) binding in medial prefrontal cortex (MPC; 67% and 34%), caudate-putamen (CPu; average 42%, 25%), nucleus accumbens (NAc; 37%, 28%), and hippocampus (HIP; 53%, 30%). Olanzapine and risperidone, but not quetiapine, produced even greater up-regulation of D(4) receptors in CPu (61%, 37%), NAc (65%, 32%), and HIP (61%, 37%). D(1)-like and D(3) receptors in all regions were unaltered by any treatment, suggesting their minimal role in mediating actions of these antipsychotics. The findings support the hypothesis that antipsychotic effects of olanzapine and risperidone are partly mediated by D(2) receptors in MPC, NAc, or HIP, and perhaps D(4) receptors in CPu, NAc, or HIP, but not in cerebral cortex. Selective up-regulation of D(2) receptors by olanzapine and risperidone in CPu may reflect their ability to induce some extrapyramidal effects. Inability of quetiapine to alter DA receptors suggests that nondopaminergic mechanisms contribute to its antipsychotic effects.",

This review represents an effort to document the doses of background medication required to achieve this goal in a group of children managed under a pain and anxiety protocol that adjusts background infusions to comfort. The course of children with wounds involving at least 10% of the body surface and coincident respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 7 days managed 1 Jan 97 to 31 Dec 98 was reviewed. A pain and anxiety protocol was used, including background infusions of morphine and midazolam adjusted to comfort. These 28 children had a mean (+/- standard deviation) age of 5.3 +/- 4.6 years, wound size of 48.3 +/- 28.4%, and were intubated for 25.0 +/- 23.9 days. Neuromuscular blocking drugs were administered for 65 of 447 (14.5%) ventilator days. To maintain comfort, drugs were required at doses substantially above standard dosing schemes. The highest daily background infusion of morphine sulfate averaged 0.40 mg/kg/hr +/- 0.24 mg/kg/hr (usual starting dose was 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg/hr) and was reached 14.1 +/- 12.8 days after admission. The highest daily background infusion of midazolam averaged 0.15 +/- 0.07 mg/kg/hr (usual starting dose was 0.04 mg/kg/hr) and was reached 14.0 +/- 3.8 days after admission. Morphine infusions at extubation averaged 0.22 +/- 0.17 mg/kg/hr and midazolam infusions 0.10 +/- 0.12 mg/kg/hr. All children survived to discharge and there was no perceived morbidity related to these high doses of medication. Children with serious burns and respiratory failure will require high doses of background opiates and benzodiazepines to remain comfortable, because they develop drug tolerance during protracted critical illness. Infusions can be continued at a reduced dose through extubation, do not result in addiction or other apparent morbidity if adjusted to desired level of comfort, and may contribute to a reduced incidence of treatment-related stress disorders.",

Parameters of enantioselectivity measured in HPLC are correlated to structural and solvation states for adsorbed HSA, evaluated by FTIR spectroscopy. HSA immobilized on [PVI]-anion-exchangers is highly selective. HSA molecules are not self-associated, only unfolded for a small hydrophobic helix. The HSA-coated reversed-phases have a lower selectivity. Unfolding is larger but the indole-benzodiazepine chiral site is preserved and remains accessible.",

There is, however, little documented information regarding clinical practice. A survey performed in 1992 reported that at least 28 drugs were used in combination with others in a single syringe driver. The aim of the present study was to reassess practice in this field and to enquire more specifically about newer drugs. Postal questionnaires were sent to all adult specialist palliative care in-patient units in the UK and Eire (n = 208). One hundred and sixty-five units (79%) responded. The most common syringe driver in use was the Graseby 26 (61% of responding units). Most units delivered the contents of the syringe over 24 h, and water was usually used as the diluent in 90% of cases. The maximum number of drugs that respondents were prepared to mix in a single syringe was usually three (51%) or four (35%). In the UK, all units used diamorphine in doses from 2.5 mg/24 h upwards. All respondents also used haloperidol, in doses from 0.5 to 60 mg/24 h. A total of 28 different drugs were used in syringe drivers. The most common combinations were diamorphine and midazolam (37%), diamorphine and levomepromazine (35%), diamorphine and haloperidol (33%), and diamorphine and cyclizine (31%). In conclusion, there is much in common with regard to the way in which drugs are delivered in syringe drivers. However, a wide variety of drugs and drug combinations are still in use.",

This double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was conducted to compare the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of nitrazepam (5 mg) in age- and sex-matched Japanese (n = 8) and white (n = 8) healthy volunteers. The study was performed in centers in Japan and the Netherlands using the same methods and study design. Subjects were individually matched for gender, age, and body stature. Drug effects were measured by means of saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements and visual analog lines obtained from the scales of Bond and Lader. There were no pharmacokinetic differences between the Japanese and white subjects. Clearance of nitrazepam was 0.91 +/- 0.165 mL/min/kg and 1.17 +/- 0.492 mL/min/kg, and half-life (t1/2) was 22.1 +/- 4.96 hours and 21.5 +/- 7.51 hours for the Japanese and European groups, respectively. Pharmacokinetic parameters showed no significant correlation with age, height, or weight. The average time-effect curves for the different parameters were comparable between groups. Compared with placebo, both groups showed similar significant reductions in average peak velocity and increases in saccadic inaccuracy and reaction time. Visual analog scores showed clear sedation in the white subjects, but insignificant effects in the Japanese subjects. Smooth pursuit did not change significantly in either group. Slope and intercept of the concentration-effect relationships for saccadic peak velocity showed considerable intersubject variability, but no clear differences between groups. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nitrazepam were similar in matched healthy Japanese and white subjects. Interethnic comparative studies are feasible, and provide meaningful information about potential racial differences in disposition and action of drugs.

A 41-year-old Caucasian male, with a history of depression and suicide attempts, was found deceased at home. Multiple containers of medication, the MAO-inhibitor moclobemide (Aurorix), the SSRI citalopram (Cipramil), and the benzodiazepine lormetazepam (Noctamid) as active substance, as well as a bottle of whiskey were present at the scene. The autopsy findings were unremarkable, but systematic toxicological analysis (EMIT, radioimmunoassay, high-performance liquid chromatography-diode-array detection [HPLC-DAD], gas chromatography-nitrogen-phosphorus detection, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) revealed the following: ethanol (0.23 g/L blood, 0.67 g/L urine), lormetazepam (1.65 microg/mL urine), cotinine (0.63 microg/mL blood, 5.08 microg/mL urine), caffeine (1.20 microg/mL urine), moclobemide (and metabolites), and citalopram (and metabolite). There upon, we developed a new liquid chromatographic separation with optimized DAD, preceded by an automated solid-phase extraction, for the quantitation of the previously mentioned antidepressive drugs. The results obtained for blood and urine, respectively, were as follows: Ro 12-5637 (moclobemide N'-oxide) not detected and 424 microg/mL; Ro 12-8095 (3-keto-moclobemide) 2.26 microg/mL and 49.7 microg/mL; moclobemide 5.62 microg/mL and 204 microg/mL; desmethylcitalopram 0.42 microg/mL and 1.22 microg/mL; and citalopram 4.47 microg/mL and 19.7 microg/mL. The cause of death was attributed to the synergistic toxicity of moclobemide and citalopram, both antidepressants, which, by intentional or accidental combined ingestion, can produce a potentially lethal hyperserotoninergic state. Based on the history of the case and pharmacology of the drugs involved, the forensic pathologists ruled that the cause of death was multiple drug intoxication, resulting in a fatal \"serotonin syndrome,\" and that the manner of death was suicide.",

This procedure involves solid-phase extraction with Bond-Elut Certify columns followed by analysis by gas chromatography-nitrogen-phosphorus detection (GC-NPD) and confirmation by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), after derivatization, when necessary. Pretreatment was performed on all samples: sonication for 15 min plus enzymatic hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase in urine. With respect to the internal standards, nalorphine and trihexylamine were used for basic substances, allobarbital for acidic drugs, and prazepam for benzodiazepines. Acidic and basic compounds were extracted from different aliquots of samples at different pH levels: 6-6.5 for the acidic and neutral and 8-8.5 for the basic and the benzodiazepines. Several areas of experimental design were considered in the process of method optimization. These included internal standards, pH, sonication, flow rate and washing solvents.

Molecular biology approaches have been used to determine which residues in the alpha5 subunit are responsible for this selectivity. Two amino acids have been identified, alpha5Thr208 and alpha5Ile215, each of which individually confer approximately 10-fold binding selectivity for the ligand and which together account for the 100-fold higher affinity of this ligand at alpha5-containing receptors. L-655,708 is a partial inverse agonist at the GABA(A) receptor which exhibited no functional selectivity between alpha1- and alpha5-containing receptors and showed no change in efficacy at receptors containing alpha1 subunits where amino acids at both of the sites had been altered to their alpha5 counterparts (alpha1Ser205-Thr,Val212-Ile). In addition to determining the binding selectivity of L-655,708, these amino acid residues also influence the binding affinities of a number of other benzodiazepine (BZ) site ligands. They are thus important elements of the BZ site of the GABA(A) receptor, and further delineate a region just N-terminal to the first transmembrane domain of the receptor alpha subunit that contributes to this binding site.", 
    "45": "In this review, we present evidence for the role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission in cerebral ischemia-induced neuronal death. While glutamate neurotransmission has received widespread attention in this area of study, relatively few investigators have focused on the ischemia-induced alterations in inhibitory neurotransmission. We present a review of the effects of cerebral ischemia on pre and postsynaptic targets within the GABAergic synapse. Both in vitro and in vivo models of ischemia have been used to measure changes in GABA synthesis, release, reuptake, GABA(A) receptor expression and activity. Cellular events generated by ischemia that have been shown to alter GABA neurotransmission include changes in the Cl(-) gradient, reduction in ATP, increase in intracellular Ca(2+), generation of reactive oxygen species, and accumulation of arachidonic acid and eicosanoids. Neuroprotective strategies to increase GABA neurotransmission target both sides of the synapse as well, by preventing GABA reuptake and metabolism and increasing GABA(A) receptor activity with agonists and allosteric modulators. Some of these strategies are quite efficacious in animal models of cerebral ischemia, with sedation as the only unwanted side-effect. Based on promising animal data, clinical trials with GABAergic drugs are in progress for specific types of stroke. This review attempts to provide an understanding of the mechanisms by which GABA neurotransmission is sensitive to cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, we discuss how dysfunction of GABA neurotransmission may contribute to neuronal death and how neuronal death can be prevented by GABAergic drugs.",

This has cost implications and may produce unwanted cardiorespiratory depression.",

The study involved 905 residents in 13 intervention nursing homes and 2325 residents in 39 control nursing homes in south-east Queensland and north-east New South Wales, Australia. The outcome measures were: continuous drug use data from government prescription subsidy claims, cross-sectional drug use data on prescribed and administered medications, deaths and morbidity indices (hospitalization rates, adverse events and disability indices).", 
    "52": "This intervention resulted in a reduction in drug use with no change in morbidity indices or survival. Differences in nursing home characteristics, as defined by cluster analysis with SUDAAN, negated intervention-related apparent significant improvements in survival. The use of benzodiazepines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, laxatives, histamine H2-receptor antagonists and antacids was significantly reduced in the intervention group, whereas the use of digoxin and diuretics remained similar to controls. Overall, drug use in the intervention group was reduced by 14.8% relative to the controls, equivalent to an annual prescription saving of A64 dollars per resident (approximately 25 pound sterling).",

One group of monkeys (n=3) responded to receive injections of methohexital or saline (i.v.) while other groups (n=2-4/group) discriminated vehicle from either pentobarbital or triazolam. Other monkeys (n=2) received diazepam daily and discriminated flumazenil from vehicle. Finally, the ability of flunitrazepam to prevent the emergence of withdrawal signs in pentobarbital-treated rats was evaluated. Flunitrazepam maintained i.v. self-administration that was, on average, less than that maintained by methohexital and greater than that maintained by saline. In drug discrimination studies, flunitrazepam substituted for pentobarbital and for triazolam and failed to substitute for flumazenil. In rats (n=3-6/group), signs of withdrawal were not evident when flunitrazepam treatment replaced pentobarbital treatment; withdrawal signs emerged when either pentobarbital or flunitrazepam treatment was terminated. Taken together with data from previous studies, these data suggest that the abuse liability of flunitrazepam is comparable to that of other benzodiazepines.",

MRI showed an abnormal high intensity area on a T2weighted and proton density images located at the right tegmentum mesencephali. She was diagnosed as clinically probable multiple sclerosis according to the Poser's criteria. The nystagmus was suppressed by clonazepam and diazepam. To our knowledge, it is a first report of acquired pendular nystagmus associated with the lesion of tegmentum mesencephali. We speculate that the involvement of the tract of paramedian pontine reticular formation causes the nystagmus and the dysfunction of GABAnergic neurons might play an important role of the nystagmus.",

However, differences in the binding characteristics of BDZ drugs with HSA have been reported. The photolabeling profiles of HSA with [(3)H]flunitrazepam (FNZP) in the presence and absence of diazepam (DZP) were shown to be identical, suggesting that each drug primarily binds to different regions. The results of fluorescent probe displacement experiments showed that FNZP failed to decrease the fluorescence of dansylsarcosine to an extent similar to that of DZP. In the photoinhibition experiment, site I and site II ligands failed to inhibit the photoincorporation of [(3)H]FNZP to HSA. In order to evaluate the photolabeling specificity of FNZP, an attempt was made to photolabel alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein (AGP) which also binds BDZ with similar affinity as HSA. The effect of myristate (MYR) and DZP on the FNZP photolabeling of these two major drug binding plasma proteins was examined. Photoincorporation was inhibited when HSA was photolabeled with [(3)H]FNZP in the presence of MYR but not in the presence of DZP. Conversely, DZP inhibited the photolabeling of [(3)H]FNZP to AGP. These results suggest that FNZP interacts with HSA at regions which are not located in the preformed binding pocket of subdomain III A.",

    "80": "The subfornical organ (SFO) is sensitive to both ANG II and ACh, and local application of these agents produces dipsogenic responses and vasopressin release. The present study examined the effects of cholinergic drugs, ANG II, and increased extracellular osmolarity on dissociated, cultured cells of the SFO that were retrogradely labeled from the supraoptic nucleus. The effects were measured as changes in cytosolic calcium in fura 2-loaded cells by using a calcium imaging system. Both ACh and carbachol increased intracellular ionic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). However, in contrast to the effects of muscarinic receptor agonists on SFO neurons, manipulation of the extracellular osmolality produced no effects, and application of ANG II produced only moderate effects on [Ca2+]i in a few retrogradely labeled cells. The cholinergic effects on [Ca2+]i could be blocked with the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine and with the more selective muscarinic receptor antagonists pirenzepine and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperdine methiodide (4-DAMP). In addition, the calcium in the extracellular fluid was required for the cholinergic-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. These findings indicate that ACh acts to induce a functional cellular response in SFO neurons through action on a muscarinic receptor, probably of the M1 subtype and that the increase of [Ca2+]i, at least initially, requires the entry of extracellular Ca2+. Also, consistent with a functional role of M1 receptors in the SFO are the results of immunohistochemical preparations demonstrating M1 muscarinic receptor-like protein present within this forebrain circumventricular organ.", 
    "81": "Feeding induces increased sleep in several species, including rats. The aim of the study was to determine if CCK plays a role in sleep responses to feeding. We induced excess eating in rats by 4 days of starvation and studied the sleep responses to refeeding in control and CCK-A receptor antagonist-treated animals. Sleep was recorded on 2 baseline days when food was provided ad libitum. After the starvation period, sleep was recorded on 2 refeeding days when the control rats (n = 8) were injected with vehicle and the experimental animals (n = 8) received intraperitoneal injections of L-364,718 (500 microg/kg, on both refeeding days). In the control group, refeeding caused increases in rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) and non-REMS (NREMS) and decreases in NREMS intensity as indicated by the slow-wave activity (SWA) of the electroencephalogram. CCK-A receptor antagonist treatment completely prevented the SWA responses and delayed the NREMS responses to refeeding; REMS responses were not simply abolished, but the amount of REMS was below baseline after the antagonist treatment. These results suggest that endogenous CCK, acting on CCK-A receptors, may play a key role in eliciting postprandial sleep.", 
    "82": "The commercial introduction of atypical antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia constitutes a considerable step forward. However, despite the improved efficacy on all aspects of schizophrenia as well as improved tolerability, prescribers still appear to be reticent about substituting these agents for typical neuroleptics. With the appearance of these new drugs, the patient now occupies a central place in the management of schizophrenia. The patient is now considered as a true partner in the formulation and follow-up of the treatment programme, resulting in the need to determine the optimum therapeutic alliance. We present the results of a European survey concerning the effects of these new antipsychotic drugs comparatively with typical neuroleptics as perceived by schizophrenic patients themselves. For all patients participating in the survey, a new antipsychotic had been given in place of a typical neuroleptic for at least six months. Three-quarters of patients questioned considered that their new antipsychotic treatment would allow them to return to a normal life. Compared with the standard neuroleptics, patients felt that the new drugs had superior effects upon all dimensions of schizophrenia as well as a better safety profile, particularly as regards neurological side-effects. Because of the superior efficacy and safety profile, patients stated that they would be more inclined to follow their doctor's prescription implicitly, despite the fact that over 50% of these patients admitted to poor compliance with previously prescribed typical neuroleptics. This study focusing on the subjective experience of patients provides further arguments in support of the superiority of atypical antipsychotic drugs over typical neuroleptics, thus confirming available clinical trial data. The results of this study also pointed to the benefits of collaboration between doctor and patient, and questioning patients about their personal experience, which can then be taken into account when deciding upon and following up the therapeutic programme.",

Transient cognitive involvement is common in epileptics and may cause underachievement at school or psychological problems. Memory disorders, particularly subjective, are common in epileptics, although neuropsychological tests other than those generally used may be necessary to evaluate this. It is possible that such memory disorders, if occurring as seizures, may be due to amnesic partial crises, which should always be differentiated from the diagnosis of transient global amnesia. Almost all antiepileptic drugs can cause negative neuropsychological effects, especially the benzodiazepines and barbiturates.",

While the BZ agonists midazolam, diazepam, and lorazepam substituted fully for triazolam, chlordiazepoxide, oxazepam and nordiazepam produced only partial substitution, suggesting these latter compounds may have reduced intrinsic efficacy. The BZ/alpha1-preferring agonist zolpidem substituted fully for triazolam, and potencies for triazolam-like effects of BZ agonists were significantly correlated with potencies for their zolpidem-like effects (Rowlett et al. 1999). Flumazenil antagonized the DS effects of triazolam, but the slope of the Schild plot was significantly different from unity, suggesting multiple receptors may be involved in the DS effects of triazolam.", 
    "94": "BZ agonists can be distinguished on the basis of substitution for triazolam and, thus, the triazolam discrimination may be a useful tool for identifying compounds of different efficacy at BZ receptors. BZ/alpha1 receptors appear to play a prominent role in the DS effects of triazolam, but the contribution of other subtypes of BZ receptors cannot be ruled out.",

Otenzepad, in combination with C(7)/3'-phth or gallamine, gave concentration-ratios close to additive and in agreement with theoretical model predictions for combination of two allosteric modulators acting at a common site. However, when otenzepad was combined with alcuronium, dexetimide or N-methylscopolamine, supra-additive effects were observed. For either competitive antagonist in combination with otenzepad, the degree of supra-additivity was more evident after 2-h equilibration than after 40 min. When otenzepad was combined with atropine, no supra-additivity was observed with carbachol as the agonist, but was evident with acetylcholine. Otenzepad was also unable to fully inhibit [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding when the radioligand was employed at a concentration of approximately 100 x K(D). It is concluded that the action of otenzepad involves an allosteric site and a number of possibilities are discussed for its location.", 
    "96": "Mechanisms for formation of drug dependence and emergence of withdrawal syndrome are not yet fully understood despite of a huge accumulation of experimental and clinical data. Several clinical features of withdrawal syndrome are considered to be common (i.e., anxiety) among patients with drug dependence induced by different drugs of abuse. In this review, we have discussed the possibility of the functional involvement of diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), an endogenous neuropeptide for benzodiazepine receptors with endogenously anxiogenic potential, in the development of drug dependence and emergence of its withdrawal symptom. The levels of DBI protein and its mRNA significantly increased in the brain derived from mice dependent on alcohol (ethanol), nicotine and morphine, and abrupt cessation of these drugs facilitated further increase in DBI expression. In the cases of nicotine- and morphine-dependent mice, concomitant administration of antagonists for nicotinic acetylcholine and opioid receptors, respectively, abolished the increase in DBI expression. Therefore, these alterations in DBI expression have a close relationship with formation of drug dependence and/or emergence of withdrawal syndrome and are considered to be a common biochemical process in drug dependence induced by different drugs of abuse.",

The present study was undertaken to examine the possible participation of the serotonergic system in the mechanism of head twitches induced by benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZ-RAs). The HTR induced by BZ-RAs was suppressed by pretreatment with ketanserine (1 mg/kg, i.p.), a selective 5-HT(2) receptor antagonist. Pretreatment with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), a 5-HT reuptake inhibitor, and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, a 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, also suppressed the HTR induced by BZ-RAs. These results suggest that the HTR induced by BZ-RAs may be the result of an activation of postsynaptic 5-HT(2) receptors, probably due to direct action.",

The percentage of time spent in the open arms of the plus-maze apparatus decreased in mice subjected to SART stress without change in the total number of arm entries. No change was noted in mice subjected to other stresses, such as 1-h, 2-day and 5-day cold stress and 1-h, 15-h and 5 x 15-h restraint stress. The reduction in the percentage of time spent in the open arms caused by SART stress was inhibited by single and repeated administrations of diazepam and alprazolam and by a single administration of buspirone, which have no influence on the percentage of time spent in the open arms in nonstressed mice, but not by flumazenil, WAY-100635 and chronic treatment with buspirone. The effects of diazepam and buspirone were antagonized by flumazenil and WAY-100635, respectively. The behavior of SART-stressed mice in the plus-maze would thus appear to arise from anxiety, to which benzodiazepine and serotonin receptors are related, but the diazepam binding inhibitor, an endogenous anxiogenic protein, is not. Thus SART-stressed animals may be useful for investigating the psychopharmacological and neuropharmacological basis of anxiety.", 
    "101": "Propranolol and primidone are widely used, effective agents in essential tremor although they are not tolerated by all patients. In the present study, the effectiveness of alprazolam, a triazole analog of benzodiazapine class, and acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, were investigated as symptomatic treatments for essential tremor. We studied 22 patients with essential tremor in a double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled design. The patients received in random order alprazolam, acetazolamide, primidone and placebo for four weeks, each separated by a two-week washout period. The study demonstrated that alprazolam was superior to placebo and equipotent to primidone, whereas there was no statistically significant difference between acetazolamide and placebo. The mean effective daily dose of alprazolam was 0.75 mg and there was not any troublesome side effect reported by the patients on alprazolam. Alprazolam can be used as an alternative agent in elderly essential tremor patients who can not tolerate primidone or propranolol.", 
    "102": "A COMMON DISORDER: Sleep is one of the most often altered functions in elderly people. Obviously, insomnia is one of the main complain, inducing benzodiazepine (BSD) abuse, but we must keep in mind that sleep apnoea syndrome (SAS) and restless legs syndrome (RLS) are also frequent in this group of age. After exclusion of the various age-related conditions that could induce sleep disorders, we must focalise on primary and secondary sleep disorders. As an introduction, methods of sleep analysis are described and qualitative and quantitative sleep variables are given. PHYSIOLOGICAL SLEEP: Comparing the sleep of elderly people to the one of young adult give us the opportunity to define the limits of the physiological sleep aging. It seems that the main age-induced sleep disturbances are problems to maintain sleep and chronobiological disorganisation of the sleep-wake rhythm, both responsible for insomnia complains. It is important to note that SAS and RLS prevalence are correlated with age. Also crucial is the complex association between sleep, depression and dementia. These interactions are addressed from a diagnostic and a therapeutic point of view.", 
    "103": "Lastly, concerning insomnia we emphasise the importance of therapeutic alternative to BZD, responsible for addictions and cognitive impairment, mainly behavioural and chronotherapeutic methods (phototherapy, melatonin). For clinicians, it is recommended to respect the individual rhythms of each elderly patient and to prefer nonpharmacological methods.",

When serum positivity was defined as an OD level greater than 2 SD above the mean control group value (0.541), antiputamen antibodies were detected in the blood of 6 AN patients (27%) whereas they were detected in the blood of 1 patient (5%) in the control group (p <.05; Fisher's exact test).",

    "108": "Experimental drugs and/or plant extracts are often dissolved in solvents, including propylene glycol. Nevertheless, there is evidence for psychoactive properties of this alcohol. In this study we found that in the hole-board test 10% propylene glycol did not modify the head-dipping behavior. However, 30% propylene glycol induced an increase in the number of head-dips (46.92 +/- 2.37 compared to 33.83 +/- 4.39, P<0.05, ANOVA/Student-Newman-Keuls), an effect comparable to that obtained with 0.5 mg/kg diazepam (from 33.83 +/- 4.39 to 54 +/- 3.8, P<0.01, ANOVA/Student-Newman-Keuls). These results demonstrate that 30% propylene glycol has significant anxiolytic effects in this model and therefore cannot be used as an innocuous solvent.", 
    "109": "Pregnancy presents a special problem to the clinician treating bipolar disorders in women. Since the first episode of mania typically occurs before the age of 30, many women in their prime childbearing years may be exposed to potentially teratogenic mood-stabilizing agents. This exposure may also continue for the nursing infant during lactation. Pregnancy itself can exacerbate bipolar symptoms and also alter the pharmacokinetics of mood-stabilizing drugs. Risks to mother and fetus can be reduced with a number of simple strategies, including monotherapy with the lowest effective dose of a drug for the shortest period necessary, periconceptional use of multivitamins with folate, prescription of drugs with established safety records, and avoidance of exposure to antimanic agents during the first trimester of pregnancy. In this article, we review existing evidence on the risks to fetuses and nursing infants of mothers taking specific mood-stabilizing agents, and we present appropriate management guidelines designed to minimize these risks.",

    "115": "The enhancement of GABA-mediated synaptic transmission underlies the pharmacotherapy of various neurological and psychiatric disorders. GABA(A) receptors are pluripotent drug targets that display an extraordinary structural heterogeneity: they are assembled from a repertoire of at least 18 subunits (alpha1-6, beta1-3, gamma1-3, delta, epsilon, theta, rho1-3). However, differentiating defined GABA(A) receptor subtypes on the basis of function has had to await recent progress in the genetic dissection of receptor subtypes in vivo. Evidence that the various actions of allosteric modulators of GABA(A) receptors, in particular the benzodiazepines, can be attributed to specific GABA(A) receptor subtypes will be discussed. Such discoveries could open up new avenues for drug development.", 
    "116": "Neonatal seizures are frequently manifested by subtle movements that are referable to brain stem structure, ie, nystagmus, conjugate eye movements, posturing, sucking movements, and so forth. Electroencephalogram (EEG) confirmation of abnormal movements is essential in diagnosing seizures in the neonate. Clinical seizure signs are often a clue to etiology. Metabolic abnormalities must always be considered, and blood gases, calcium, magnesium, glucose, and ammonia obtained. Neonatal seizures are an indication for cerebrospinal fluid examination. Specific metabolic abnormalities are treated with metabolic approaches, not conventional anticonvulsant drugs. Hypertensive encephalopathy is treated by controlling blood pressure, and not through anticonvulsant drugs. Critically ill infants bind anticonvulsants in an unpredictable fashion, and unbound or free anticonvulsant drug concentrations should be used to guide therapy. Phenobarbital is the most commonly used drug in treating nonmetabolic seizures. Doses to achieve free concentrations of at least 35 mg/L should be used. Use in vitro binding determinations with this formula to calculate loading doses. Dose is 25 mg/kg multiplied by volume and distribution (1 L/kg) divided by % free. Phenytoin is the second most commonly used agent, and doses should be calculated to achieve, but not exceed, 3 mg/L. Dose is 3 mg/kg multiplied by volume and distribution (1 L/kg) divided by % free. Benzodiazepines, notably lorazepam and diazepam are used at doses of 0.15 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg, respectively.", 
    "117": "Recent work on a number of different classes of anticancer agents that alkylate DNA in the minor groove is reviewed.

Carrier molecules discussed for mustards are intercalators, polypyrroles, polyimidazoles, bis(benzimidazoles), polybenzamides and anilinoquinolinium salts. In contrast, similar targeting of pyrrolizidine alkylators by a variety of carriers has little effect of their patterns of alkylation (at the 2-amino group of guanine).

Four per cent were identified as opiate users, although the actual percentage is likely to be much higher. Compared to the general population of detainees there were significantly more women among known opiate users and this group also contained a higher percentage of white detainees and people born in the British Isles. People born in continental European countries were also over-represented. A little more than half of known users did not reveal their use on arrival at the police station. At least 60% of known opiate users remained well throughout their detention, 30% were intoxicated through drugs at the time of their arrest, but only 13% displayed signs or symptoms of withdrawal during their detention. Overall, 65% of the known opiate users were seen by a police surgeon and of these 52% were given medication. All of those withdrawing were given drug treatment, but most of those who were intoxicated by opiates, or who remained well throughout their detention, received no medication. Of those given medication 86% received an opiate, dihydrocodeine being the commonest preparation, usually in association with a benzodiazepine. Despite the adoption of differing management paradigms among police surgeons, the actual medical treatment of opiate-using detainees was pragmatic and determined by individual need.",

    "134": "The role of the cholecystokinin (CCK) system in mediating the infant's natural preferences toward maternal-related stimuli was examined by peripheral administration of selective CCK(A) and CCK(B) receptor antagonists (Devazepide and L-365,260, respectively) to 11-12-day-old rats and presenting them with a 3-minute preference test. In Experiment 1, the choice was between two floor textures, rug and plywood; the time spent on the relatively preferred side (rug) was measured. In Experiment 2, the odor of maternal faces emanated from one end of the test arena; time spent near that end was measured. These sensory stimuli were chosen as they represent olfactory and tactile aspects of the dam and nest. Compared to controls, both CCK receptor antagonists selectively increased the time spent on the preferred side, in both experiments, without affecting axillary temperature or locomotor activity. The results suggest that CCK may mediate and attenuate the infant's attraction toward naturally preferred stimuli.",

No such intermediates could be identified in extracts from adult rat brain or from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells transfected with alpha(1), beta(3), and gamma(2) subunits and cultured at 37 degrees C. However, subunit dimers, trimers, tetramers, and pentamers were found in extracts from the brain of 8-10-day-old rats and from alpha(1)beta(3)gamma(2) transfected HEK cells cultured at 25 degrees C. In both systems, alpha(1), beta(3), and gamma(2) subunits could be identified in subunit dimers, indicating that different subunit dimers are formed during GABA(A) receptor assembly. Co-transfection of HEK cells with various combinations of full-length and C-terminally truncated alpha(1) and beta(3) or alpha(1) and gamma(2) subunits and co-immunoprecipitation with subunit-specific antibodies indicated that even subunits containing no transmembrane domain can assemble with each other. Whereas alpha(1)gamma(2), alpha(1)Ngamma(2), alpha(1)gamma(2)N, and alpha(1)Ngamma(2)N, combinations exhibited specific [(3)H]Ro 15-1788 binding, specific [(3)H]muscimol binding could only be found in alpha(1)beta(3) and alpha(1)beta(3)N, but not in alpha(1)Nbeta(3) or alpha(1)Nbeta(3)N combinations. This seems to indicate that a full-length alpha(1) subunit is necessary for the formation of the muscimol-binding site and for the transduction of agonist binding into channel gating.", 
    "136": "This study aimed to determine the effect of olanzapine and other antipsychotic drugs on cognitive functions after 6months of treatment. Baseline, 3month and 6month psychopathological and cognitive evaluations were made. Thirty-eight partially responsive outpatients with DSM-IV chronic schizophrenia diagnosis were included in the study. On the indication of their attending psychiatrists, 21 patients initiated treatment with olanzapine, and 17 remained on their previous treatment with other antipsychotic drugs. Cognitive assessments were blind to medication and psychopathological status. The olanzapine group presented a significantly greater improvement in negative symptomatology and verbal memory than the comparison group in repeated-measures of MANOVAs between baseline, 3month and 6month assessments. These differences remained statistically significant after covarying out gender, treatment with other atypical antipsychotics, biperidene doses and changes in positive and negative symptoms. In order to match previous differences between groups, cognitive baseline scores for each test were introduced as covariates, resulting in a significant improvement for the olanzapine group in negative symptomatology and the interference task of the Stroop test.We then re-analyzed the data, dividing the comparison group into two groups: risperidone-treated patients (n=9) and patients receiving conventional antipsychotic drugs (n=8). Post-hoc analyses between groups were carried out with baseline cognitive assessment as covariate. The olanzapine group improved significantly more than the risperidone group in negative symptomatology and in the interference task of Stroop test. The improvement in the number of categories of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test was higher in risperidone patients than in those receiving olanzapine or conventional antipsychotic treatment. Conventional antipsychotic drugs did not present a significant improvement over atypical antipsychotic drugs in any cognitive function. In summary, in patients suffering from chronic schizophrenia, atypical antipsychotic agents were associated with slight differential improvements over time in attentional, verbal memory and executive functions compared with conventional neuroleptic drugs. No differential improvements were found in social functioning, verbal fluency, non-verbal domains of memory or visuo-motor abilities.",

The statistics for the prediction of anti-HIV activity in the test set of 24 TIBO derivatives were r2 = 0.80 and s = 0.64, respectively.

    "139": "This study was designed to examine whether the widely prescribed benzodiazepine hypnotic triazolam has reinforcing effects in moderate social alcohol drinkers, without histories of drug abuse or insomnia, in the context of its use as a hypnotic. Eleven healthy adult volunteers who met criteria for 'good sleepers' participated in a 60-session double-blind choice study which was conducted on an outpatient basis with participants sleeping at home. Twenty three-session sampling/choice tests were conducted sequentially to provide 20 evaluations of the reinforcing effects of 0.25 mg/70 kg triazolam versus placebo, ingested orally 30 min before bedtime. Each three-session test consisted of two sampling sessions, in which participants received exposure to each of the two drug conditions in different colored capsules, followed by one choice session, in which participants were asked to choose one of the two colour-coded capsules for self-administration. Four participants exhibited a significant choice of triazolam, three, a significant choice of placebo (i.e. triazolam avoidance), and four, a random (i.e. non-significant) choice between triazolam and placebo. The reasons provided by participants were consistent with their choices and with the expected effects of triazolam versus placebo. Analyses of post-sleep questionnaires indicated that triazolam did not produce a clinically meaningful improvement in sleep. The finding that triazolam functioned as a reinforcer in participants without insomnia suggests that triazolam has reinforcing effects in some individuals for which hypnotic treatment is not clinically indicated, and that health care professionals must continue to assess the risk/benefit ratio of benzodiazepine hypnotic prescription.", 
    "140": "The aim of this study was to analyse the frequency of poisoning with psychoactive drugs (benzodiazepines, antidepressants and neuroleptics) over the last 15 years in Croatia. The analysis was based on poisoning incidents reported over the phone (hot line) to the Zagreb Poison Control Center and included two periods: 1985-1991 (period I) and 1992-1999 (period II). The data were analysed separately for children and adults. Each phone call was counted as one poisoning incident. Child poisoning with neuroleptics was significantly higher in period II than in period I and so was the adult poisoning with antidepressants, amytriptyline, and combined psychoactive drugs. The frequency of total psychoactive drug poisoning was significantly higher in adults than in children in both periods. From 1992, the frequency of adult poisoning with antidepressants considerably increased as one of the many consequences of war-related stress. The results indicate a need for careful psychiatric evaluation and more critical use of antidepressants in affected individuals.",

Hydrogel matrix consisting of polyvinyl alcohol and 1,2-propylene glycol was used for application. Transdermal application of 0.1-0.4 mg phenazepam in a dose of 14 mg/kg provided a stable level of this drug during application interval (1-48 h), while its bioavailability for blood plasma and brain was 0.63 and 0.2, respectively (determined for 0.4 mg phenazepam). The rate of drug penetration into the blood and brain was 46 and 60 ng/ml/h, respectively.", 
    "142": "Absence status epilepsy (ASE) is an uncommon seizure disorder in children. The primary presentation of new-onset ASE in a pediatric patient is an unusual cause of altered mental status in the emergency department. We describe a previously healthy 8-year-old child who presented with an acutely altered mental state. The patient was awake but confused, with a fluctuating level of alertness and an inability to perform simple routine tasks. The results of general physical and neurologic examination, with the exception of mental status, were normal. Head computed tomography and laboratory test results were normal. Electroencephalographic testing revealed seizure activity consistent with ASE. Administration of intravenous diazepam caused cessation of seizure activity and a return to the patient's baseline mental function. Although rare, ASE should be considered in the differential diagnosis of altered mental status in children.", 
    "143": "Second derivative spectrophotometry allowed the establishment of a simple and accurate method for the determination of partition coefficients of benzodiazepine drugs in a liposome/water system. The absorption spectra of diazepam (DZ) and flurazepam (FZ) in phosphatidylcholine (egg yolk) bilayer vesicle suspensions showed small spectral changes depending on the concentration of phosphatidylcholine vesicles. However, the intense background signals caused by the light scattering of the phosphatidylcholine vesicles made it difficult to yield a correct base line, thus the quantitative spectral data could not be obtained. In the second derivative spectra, the spectral changes were enhanced and three derivative isosbestic points were observed for each drug indicating the entire elimination of the residual background signal effects. The derivative intensity change of each drug (DeltaD) induced by its interaction with phosphatidylcholine bilayers was measured at a specific wavelength. From the relationship between the DeltaD value and the lipid concentration, the molar partition coefficients (K(p)s) of DZ and FZ were calculated and obtained with a good precision of R.S.D below 10%. The fractions of the partitioned DZ and FZ calculated by using the obtained K(p) values agreed well with the experimental values. The results prove that the derivative method can be usefully and easily applied to the determination of partition coefficients of benzodiazepines in the liposomes/water system without any separation procedures.", 
    "144": "We evaluated racemic zopiclone, its (S)- and (R)-enantiomers and a metabolite, (S)-desmethylzopiclone, for their actions on locomotor activity, rotarod performance, the elevated plus maze and the Vogel conflict test of anxiety, and electroconvulsive shock-induced seizures duration. Zopiclone and its (R)- and (S)-enantiomers reduced locomotor activity, and zopiclone and its (S)-enantiomer disrupted rotarod performance at 10 mg/kg. (S)-desmethylzopiclone did not alter these measures at doses of less than 200 mg/kg. (S)-desmethylzopiclone altered plus maze performance at the lowest dose of all the zopiclone derivatives tested, caused a dose-related effect on the Vogel conflict test and caused a dose-related reduction of electroconvulsive shock-induced seizure durations. The data indicate that (S)-desmethylzopiclone can bring about an anxiolytic effect without a substantial degree of central nervous system depression, and suggest that the agent may be particularly useful clinically in the treatment of anxiety.", 
    "145": "A lyophilized ethanolic aqueous extract of Papaver rhoeas petals was evaluated for its behavioral and pharmaco-toxicological effects in mice and its chemical composition was studied using thin layer chromatography (TLC). In this study, chemical analysis by TLC showed that the petals contain some anthocyanins, whereas no alkaloids were detected. The toxicological effect of alcoholic and aqueous plant extract administered intraperitoneally was determined in mice. The toxicological results obtained indicated that 2000 mg/kg is LD10 and 4000 mg/kg is LD50. Behavioral and pharmacological studies of ethanolic and aqueous extract showed that the plant extract reduced locomotory, exploratory and postural behavior of mice. This was evaluated through two specific behavioral tests; a non-familiar environment test (the Staircase test) and a familiar environment test (Free exploratory test). These behavioral and pharmacological effects are more pronounced when the solvent used for extraction is 10% ethanol and is not antagonized by benzodiazepines, opioids, dopaminergic and cholinergic compounds (flumazenil, naloxone, sulpuride and atropine). The plant extract did not induce sleep in mice after treatment with an infrahypnotic dose of pentobarbital. This finding shows that the plant extract has a sedative effect at a 400 mg/kg dosage.",

First, we focus on the galenic and technological conditions established by ultrasound techniques. A 2(5) factorial design was used to optimize the carrier emulsion. The study then deals with the development of a parenteral emulsion formulation for lorazepam (1 mg/ml), which is compared with the highest concentration (0.05 mg/ml) achieved in the optimal aqueous diluent for lorazepam (dextrose 5% in water).

    "147": "The present study determined whether anxiolytics such as diazepam (DZP), the benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor-selective agonist abecarnil (ABC), or the 5-HT1(A) agent buspirone (BUS) would increase the response latency of rats to switch-off electrical brain stimulation (EBS) of the periaqueductal gray (PAG). We also investigated the effects of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), a purported anxiogenic. Given acutely, DZP (2.5 and 5 mg/kg, ip) and ABC (0.5 and 1 mg/kg, ip) increased response latency. The BZD receptor antagonist flumazenil (10.0 mg/kg, ip) blocked these effects. Increasing the frequency of EBS reversed the effects of DZP and ABC, suggesting that motor disruption did not account for the increase in latency seen with these drugs. Given acutely, BUS (10.0 mg/kg, ip) also increased response latency, which was likely due to motor disruption because it was not reversed by increasing the frequency of EBS. When BUS (2.5 mg/kg, ip) was given every 8 h for 3 days, an increase in latency was also obtained, which was reversible by increasing the frequency of EBS. Finally, PTZ (10 and 20 mg/kg, ip) shortened the latency to respond. These results (1) suggest that DZP, ABC, and chronic BUS attenuate, whereas PTZ potentiates, the negative reinforcing stimulus (NRS) induced by PAG stimulation, and (2) support the hypothesis that the switch-off procedure accurately detects anxiolytic and anxiogenic drugs.", 
    "148": "Although it is widely believed that the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines are mediated through facilitation of GABA(A) receptor function, behavioural studies have to date provided rather weak support for this hypothesis. In particular, considerable inconsistency has been noted both for the effects of GABAergic manipulations in animal models of anxiety and the ability of GABA(A) receptor antagonists to block the anxiolytic effects of diazepam (DZ) and chlordiazepoxide. In view of the sensitivity of the murine plus-maze to the anxiety-modulating effects of GABAergic agents as well as classical benzodiazepines, the current study examined the extent to which the anxiolytic actions of valproic acid (VPA) and DZ in this test involve picrotoxin (PX)-sensitive receptor mechanisms. Subjects were male DBA/2 mice, test duration was 5 min, and ethological scoring methods were employed. Our results show that, while devoid of intrinsic behavioural effects under present test conditions, PX (0.25-0.5 mg/kg) selectively antagonised the anxiolytic-like (but not other) effects of VPA (400 mg/kg). In contrast, the same doses of PX failed to block any of the behavioural changes induced by DZ (1.5 mg/kg), including disinhibition of open arm exploration. These data suggest that the plus-maze anxiolytic effects of DZ in DBA/2 mice are not mediated through PX-sensitive GABA(A) receptors. Further studies will be required to assess the generality of present findings to other mouse strains, species and behavioural paradigms.",

It also sought to determine whether simultaneous access to case management and psychosocial rehabilitation and olanzapine leads to enhanced functional improvement.", 
    "150": "Six-month outcomes for a consecutive series of 104 patients who switched from a conventional antipsychotic medication to olanzapine were evaluated. Forty-nine patients in the same treatment program who continued to take conventional antipsychotics were also monitored as a reference group. Outcomes of the group receiving olanzapine were compared with their own baseline status and with outcomes of the reference group.", 
    "151": "At six months, patients in the olanzapine group demonstrated significant improvement over baseline across multiple measures of symptoms and psychosocial function. Compared with the reference group, the olanzapine group was more symptomatic at baseline and demonstrated significantly greater improvement at follow-up on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and all subscales; Mini Psychiatric Rating Scale negative symptom, disorganization, anxiety, depression, and medication side effects items; and Clinical Global Improvement scale and Case Manager's Rating Scale-Plus illness factors. There was a trend toward superior improvement in psychosocial functioning among patients in the olanzapine group that achieved significance when patients in acute relapse at baseline were excluded.",

    "153": "Propofol and midazolam are often used for sedation in the intensive care unit. The aim of this systematic review was to estimate the efficacy and harm of propofol versus midazolam in mechanically ventilated patients. A systematic search (Medline, Cochrane Library, Embase, bibliographies), any language, up to June 1999 was performed for reports of randomized comparisons of propofol with midazolam. Data from 27 trials (1624 adults) were analyzed. The average duration of sedation varied between 4 and 339 h. In 10 trials, the duration of adequate sedation was longer with propofol (weighted mean difference 2.9 h; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2-5.6 h). In 13 trials (mostly postoperative), sedation lasted 4 to 35 h; in 9 of those, average weaning time from mechanical ventilation with propofol was 0.8-4.3 h; with midazolam it was 1.5-7.2 h (weighted mean difference 2.2 h [95% CI, 0.8 to 3.7 h]). In 8 trials, sedation lasted 54 to 339 h; there was a lack of evidence for difference in weaning times. Arterial hypotension (relative risk 2.5 [95% CI, 1.3 to 4.5]; number-needed-to-treat, 12), and hypertriglyceridemia (relative risk 12.1 [95%CI, 2.9 to 49.7]; number-needed-to-treat, 6) occurred more often with propofol. The duration of adequate sedation time is longer with propofol compared with midazolam. In postoperative patients with sedation <36 h, weaning is faster with propofol.",

    "155": "There have been significant changes in the management of neonates and infants undergoing cardiac surgery in the past decade. We have evaluated in this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study the effect of large-dose fentanyl anesthesia, with or without midazolam, on stress responses and outcome. Forty-five patients < 6 mo of age received bolus fentanyl (Group 1), fentanyl by continuous infusion (Group 2), or fentanyl-midazolam infusion (Group 3). Epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, adrenocortical hormone, glucose, and lactate were measured after the induction (T1), after sternotomy (T2), 15 min after initiating cardiopulmonary bypass (T3), at the end of surgery (T4), and after 24 h in the intensive care unit (T5). Plasma fentanyl concentrations were obtained at all time points except at T5. Within each group epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, glucose and lactate levels were significantly larger at T4 (P values < 0.01), but there were no differences among groups. Within groups, fentanyl levels were significantly larger in Groups 2 and 3 (P < 0.001) at T4, and among groups, the fentanyl level was larger only at T2 in Group 1 compared with Groups 2 and 3 (P < 0.006). There were no deaths or postoperative complications, and no significant differences in duration of mechanical ventilation or intensive care unit or hospital stay. Fentanyl dosing strategies, with or without midazolam, do not prevent a hormonal or metabolic stress response in infants undergoing cardiac surgery.", 
    "156": "We demonstrated a significant endocrine stress response in infants with well compensated congenital cardiac disease undergoing cardiac surgery, but without adverse postoperative outcome. The use of large-dose fentanyl, with or without midazolam, with the intention of providing \"stress free\" anesthesia, does not appear to be an important determinant of early postoperative outcome.", 
    "157": "The effect of trihydroxy (sodium cholate and sodium glycocholate) and dihydroxy (sodium deoxycholate and sodium glycodeoxycholate) bile salt micelles on the spectrophotometric properties and on the solubility of nitrazepam in aqueous solution, at 25.0 degrees C and at ionic strength 0.1 M in sodium chloride, has been assessed. From the results obtained it was possible to calculate the partition coefficients (Kp) of nitrazepam between aqueous and micellar phases. The partition coefficients of nitrazepam have also been determined in mixed micelles of cholate or deoxycholate with lecithin (egg yolk phosphatidylcholine), which were used as a model of the gastrointestinal tract. Drug partition was found to depend on the bile acid (number of hydroxyl groups and conjugation with glycine), and our data indicate further that addition of lecithin to bile salt micelles decreases the values of the partition coefficients in the mixed micelles at physiological pH.", 
    "158": "The endoscopic literature published during the past year has once again confirmed that there is significant variation from country to country regarding whether or not patients wish to receive conscious sedation during endoscopy (and particularly colonoscopy) - and there may even be variation from one endoscopic unit to another within the same country. Particular attention has been given to attempts to identify \"ideal\" candidates for conscious sedation, and to the importance of providing patients with information before the procedure. It has been shown that patients who receive detailed information about a medical procedure beforehand are able to benefit from this. The role of benzodiazepines, particularly midazolam, was investigated in studies emphasizing that the dosage should be kept to the minimum that is compatible with patient comfort and successful performance of the procedure. There have been few publications comparing propofol with midazolam. As expected, in view of the known pharmacological properties of the two drugs, the quality of sedation was better and the recovery time was shorter in patients who were treated with propofol. However, important questions are still open regarding the narrow therapeutic range of propofol and the methods by which it is administered (by endoscopists or by anesthesiologists). An important aspect of sedation procedures is the prevention of hypoxia and cardiopulmonary complications. Recent endoscopic reports have added little further information concerning the well-known risk of oxygen desaturation during conscious sedation. Performing endoscopy in unsedated patients reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of hypoxia. Among the various risk factors, it has been found that chronic respiratory failure and coronary heart disease are factors predictive of severe desaturation and relevant electrocardiographic changes. The use of electronic monitoring techniques with pulse oximetry is recommended as a standard procedure during digestive endoscopy; however, it has been observed that when supplemental oxygen is administered, pulse oximetry no longer reflects normal ventilatory function and does not detect episodes of severe CO2 retention. Transcutaneous measurement of PCO2 therefore seems more reliable as a means of assessing hypoventilation. Several papers have proposed \"ideal formulas\" for bowel preparation for endoscopic procedures. Various regimens have been proposed as alternatives to polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution (PEG-ELS) and sodium phosphate compounds, with different results. On the whole, there is still little information regarding the best and most cost-effective method of bowel cleansing for colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy.", 
    "159": "Studies to date on the effects of benzodiazepines on neuropsychologic function have yielded conflicting data with respect to the type, severity, and duration of deficits that may be induced by these agents. As part of a placebo-controlled trial of alprazolam-XR (extended release) administered in combination with cognitive-behavioral therapy in patients with panic disorder, a battery of tests was used to measure neuropsychologic function. Thirty-eight outpatients were randomly assigned to receive either alprazolam-XR or placebo. Dosages were titrated up so that the alprazolam group (N = 18) received a mean dose of 4 mg/day (reduced in two patients because of sedative side effects). Neuropsychologic function after 6 weeks of therapy at the target dosage was compared with baseline assessments in each group. Both groups showed a statistically significant improvement from baseline to repeated assessments on measures of attention, executive functioning, psychomotor speed, and visual memory (p < 0.001); these gains were attributed to a practice effect. No significant changes were noted in measures of learning, verbal memory, or reaction time, and neither group showed any deterioration from baseline to retesting in any aspect of neuropsychologic function. These findings call into question the assumption that long-term benzodiazepine therapy produces significant neuropsychologic deficit in patients with diagnosed anxiety disorders.", 
    "160": "The purpose of this experiment was to compare, in three tasks of attention, the impairment caused by lorazepam (1 and 2.5 mg) administered to young volunteers with the impairment that results from aging. Performance on digit cancellation (DC), digit-symbol substitution (DSS), and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT) was significantly impaired by lorazepam (2.5 mg) and was significantly worse in the middle-aged group (mean +/- SEM, aged 58.9+/-0.8 years) compared with the younger, IQ-matched group (20.7+/-0.2 years). However, there were interesting differences in the extent of impairments among the three tests. In the DC test, lorazepam (2.5 mg) produced a significantly greater impairment than was seen in either the middle-aged men or middle-aged women. However, in the DSS test, the middle-aged women were significantly more impaired than either the middle-aged men or the young volunteers tested after lorazepam (2.5 mg). In the PASAT, both the lorazepam (2.5 mg) group and the middle-aged women were more impaired than the middle-aged men. These results raise the important possibility of gender differences in age-related decline of attentional processes."
