Psychopharmacological evaluations of linalool (i.p. and i.c.v.) revealed marked sedative and anticonvulsant central effects in various mouse models. Considering this profile and alleged effects of inhaled lavender essential oil, the purpose of this study was to examine the sedative effects of inhaled linalool in mice. Mice were placed in an inhalation chamber during 60 min, in an atmosphere saturated with 1% or 3% linalool. Immediately after inhalation, animals were evaluated regarding locomotion, barbiturate-induced sleeping time, body temperature and motor coordination (rota-rod test). The 1% and 3% linalool increased (p<0.01) pentobarbital sleeping time and reduced (p<0.01) body temperature. The 3% linalool decreased (p<0.01) locomotion. Motor coordination was not affected. Hence, linalool inhaled for 1h seems to induce sedation without significant impairment in motor abilities, a side effect shared by most psycholeptic drugs.",

We report the crystal structure of the recombinant unglycosylated human AGP at 1.8 A resolution, which was solved using the new method of UV-radiation-damage-induced phasing (UV RIP). AGP reveals a typical lipocalin fold comprising an eight-stranded beta-barrel. Of the four loops that form the entrance to the ligand-binding site, loop 1, which connects beta-strands A and B, is among the longest observed so far and exhibits two full turns of an alpha-helix. Furthermore, it carries one of the five N-linked glycosylation sites, while a second one occurs underneath the tip of loop 2. The branched, partly hydrophobic, and partly acidic cavity, together with the presumably flexible loop 1 and the two sugar side chains at its entrance, explains the diverse ligand spectrum of AGP, which is known to vary with changes in glycosylation pattern.",

ND700C inhibited the fMLP-induced superoxide anion production and cathepsin G release in a concentration-dependent manner with respective IC50 values of 5.0+/-0.5 and 8.7+/-0.8muM. In addition, ND700C was found to suppress fMLP-induced intracellular calcium mobilization and the phosphorylation of ERK and Akt. In another study, ND700C was observed to cause a rapid increase in intracellular cAMP level by up to threefold. Furthermore, when H89 was used to inhibit cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), we discovered that ND700C's suppressive effects on calcium mobilization, phosphorylation, and superoxide anion production were abrogated. ND700C demonstrated additive effect on the PGE1-induced increase in cAMP. However, this additive effect was not demonstrated with the IBMX-induced rise in cAMP. Our results indicated that ND700C did not directly inhibit the activity of phosphodiesterase 4. In another set of experiments, calyculin A and okadaic acid (both protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors) were found to reverse ND700C's positive effect on cAMP level. This observation suggested the involvement of protein phosphatase 2A in ND700C's cAMP-elevating mechanism. We found that the activity of protein phosphatase 2A was activated by ND700C.

    "20": "Drug-induced tardive motor syndromes (TMS) is a group of disorders, characterized by involuntary movements of the tongue, face, lips, trunk and extremities, occurring after long-term exposure to a variety of pharmacological agents, mostly neuroleptics. The diagnosis of TMS requires exposure to dopamine receptor blocking agents for a period at least of 3 months, although for people over 60 years old the necessary exposure period is limited to 1 month. The exact pathophysiology still remains obscure. The aim of this article is to review the phenomenology, epidemiology and treatment options of the TMS, as clinically distinct movement disorders. TMS include tardive dyskinesia, which is the most common movement disorder, tardive dystonia, tardive akathisia, tardive Tourettism, tardive tremor and tardive myoclonus as well as some specific syndromes less often presented such as Pisa, Meige and Rabbit syndromes. Prevention remains the cornerstone in good clinical practice. Preventive approach requires thorough diagnostic process with frequent reviews in order to determine the necessity of use and dosing of neuroleptic treatment. Clinical vigilance for early detection of signs of TMS as well as recording of early extrapyramidal side-effects in the patient's history is needed, as these may predict the occurrence of TMS. In case of occurrence of TMS, gradual discontinuation of the offending agent is required. Therapeutic interventions include the administration of the following agents: atypical antipsychotics (mainly clozapine), benzodiazepines, vitamin E, reserpine, tetrabenazine, anticholinergics, botulinum toxin A. The early management of TMS is crucial for the patients' better clinical outcome and improved quality of life.",

In particular, 17beta-estradiol was shown to affect GABAergic synaptic transmission in hippocampus of adult animals in vivo but much less is known on the impact of this hormone on the GABAergic system in the developing brains. We have recently shown that phasic and tonic GABAergic transmissions are strongly modulated upon long-term treatment with exogenous 17beta-estradiol in hippocampal neurons developing in vitro. To check for the long-term estrogen effect in a more physiological developmental model, we have investigated the GABAergic transmission in developing brains of P7-P40 animals, injected daily with 17beta-estradiol. We have found that such a treatment clearly increased GABAergic mIPSC frequency and amplitude while the onset and decay of mIPSCs were shortened. These effects were statistically significant in the youngest considered age group (P7-P13) with a tendency to disappear in older animals. Long-term treatment with estradiol did not change the susceptibility of mIPSC amplitude to upregulation by flurazepam while mIPSC decay was prolonged by this drug to a larger extent in 17beta-estradiol-treated animals. 17beta-estradiol strongly upregulated GABAergic tonic current but again this effect was restricted to the youngest group of animals. We conclude that 17beta-estradiol strongly modulates the GABAergic synaptic transmission but this effect critically depends on the animal age being the most prominent in youngest animals.",

Results showed that pretreatment with Dextromethorphan or midazolam decreased the degree of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms significantly. Additionally co-administration ofDextromethorphan and midazolam couldn't decreased the tolerance and dependence significantly. From these results it may concluded that Dextromethorphan and midazolam alone or in combination could prevent the development of morphine induced tolerance and dependence.

Thirty-two (3.8%) of these 835 pregnant women used medazepam with or without other drugs for self-poisoning; 10 of these women delivered live-born babies. The dose of medazepam used for the suicide attempt ranged between 60 and 500 mg, with a mean of 276 mg. Eight of the 32 suicide attempts involving medazepam occurred between the 4th and 12th postconceptional weeks. Of the 10 live-born exposed children, one was affected with congenital inguinal hernia; one of the 13 sib controls had a lethal hydronephrosis. No adverse effects were observed on intrauterine growth, cognitive status, or behavioral deviations in the 10 children born to mothers who attempted suicide with medazepam during pregnancy. Very large doses of medazepam were used for self-poisoning during pregnancy. These doses did not increase the rate of CAs even though eight mothers attempted suicide during the most critical period for production of CAs.

Rates of congenital abnormalities, intrauterine fetal development, and cognitive-behavioral status were compared between children born to mothers who attempted suicide during pregnancy using alprazolam alone or in combination with other drugs and in their sib controls. Between 1984 and 1993, 559 pregnant women attempted suicide during pregnancy with drugs: 30 of these women self-poisoned with alprazolam, 10 delivered live-born infants who were examined. Doses of alprazolam used were between 7.5 and 100 mg, with a mean of 30 mg. Six of the 10 exposed children were born to mothers who attempted suicide between the 6th and 12th postconceptional weeks. Of the 10 exposed children, two had congenital abnormalities. One had a multiple congenital abnormality that included atypical gastroschisis and minor anomalies; an association of this defect and the 30 mg alprazolam used for self-poisoning in the 14th postconceptional week cannot be excluded. Another exposed child had mild pectus excavatum, but the times of the suicide attempt and the critical period for producing this defect did not overlap. Of 12 sibs, one had a multiple congenital abnormality. Thus, the rate of congenital abnormalities did not significantly differ between exposed children and their sibs. Mean birth weight was higher for babies born to mothers who attempted suicide by alprazolam during pregnancy than in their sib controls. Cognitive status and behavioral scale of the exposed children did not indicate fetotoxic effects, including neurotoxic effects, of large doses of alprazolam. The large doses of alprazolam used for self-poisoning during pregnancy did not result in a significantly higher rate of congenital abnormalities; however, there were only 10 self-poisoned pregnant women, and an association of one multiple congenital abnormality with a large dose of alprazolam cannot be excluded.

Of 1044 women with self-poisoning during pregnancy between 1960 and 1993, 88 (8.4%) used chlordiazepoxide with or without other drugs for suicide attempt; 35 of these women delivered live-born infants. Doses of chlordiazepoxide taken ranged between 20 and 300 mg, with a mean of 117 +/- 86 mg. Of 35 exposed children, six (17.1 %) were affected with congenital abnormalities compared with three (13.6%) of their 22 sibs (OR with 95% CI: 1.3 (0.3-4.4). Of 18 pregnant women who attempted suicide between the 4th and 12th postconceptional week, the period most sensitive to congenital malformation, four delivered live-born children affected with a congenital abnormality (atrial septal defect type II, complex defect of respiratory system, mild pyelectasis because of the stenosis of ureteropelvic junction, congenital inguinal hernia). Two other children had fetal alcohol syndrome and unrecognized multiple congenital abnormality including talipes equinovarus, deformation type, and four minor anomalies. The pregnancy age-specific mean birth weight indicated intrauterine fetal growth retardation, which was confirmed by a dose-response relationship and by the higher rate of low birth-weight newborns. Cognitive status and behavioral scale of exposed children did not indicate neurotoxic effects. Very large doses of chlordiazepoxide used for suicide attempts during pregnancy did not induce a higher rate of congenital abnormalities but were associated with dose-dependent intrauterine growth retardation.", 
    "56": "The teratogenic potential of diazepam is debated. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of extremely high doses of diazepam used for attempted suicide during pregnancy on embryo-fetal development. Pregnant women were identified from the female patients of the Department of Toxicology Internal Medicine, Kor\u00e1nyi Hospital, Budapest, who had been admitted as self-poisoned subjects from the three million people of Budapest and the surrounding region. This evaluation compares the incidences and types of congenital abnormalities observed in exposed children born to mothers who attempted suicide with diazepam alone or in combination with other drugs during pregnancy with their sib controls. The database consists of a total of 1044 women with self-poisoning during pregnancy between 1960 and 1993. Of these 1044 self-poisoned pregnant women, 229 (21.9%) used diazepam with or without other drugs for a suicide attempt; 112 of these women delivered live-born infants. Doses of diazepam taken ranged between 25 and 800 mg. Of 112 exposed children, 15 (13.4%) had congenital abnormalities, whereas of their 112 matched sibs, eight (7.1%) had congenital abnormalities (odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals: 2.0, 0.8-5.0). Of 37 pregnant women who attempted suicide between the 4th and 12th postconceptional weeks, five (13.5%) delivered live-born babies with a congenital abnormality (undescended testis in two exposed children; congenital dysplasia of the hip, talipes equinovarus deformation type, congenital inguinal hernia-each in one exposed child). The suicide attempts of the mothers of these children did not occur during the critical periods for induction of these defects, indicating that the observations were unrelated to diazepam. The very large doses of diazepam used for self-poisoning during pregnancy did not increase the rate of congenital abnormalities in the offspring.", 
    "57": "Studies comparing chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and major depressive disorder (MDD) reported similarities as well as differences between the two disorders. However, whereas psychomotor symptoms have been studied extensively in MDD, such research in CFS is more limited. Moreover, the few studies that compared cognitive and motor performance in MDD and CFS yielded inconsistent results. This study hence directly compares fine psychomotor functioning in both syndromes.", 
    "58": "Thirty-eight patients diagnosed with CFS without a current major depressive episode (MDE), 32 MDD patients with a current MDE and 38 healthy controls performed two computerized copying tasks differing in complexity: a line-copying task that mainly requires motor effort and a figure-copying task requiring additional cognitive efforts. All participants were female. A multivariate general linear model was used to compute group differences.", 
    "59": "Overall, both patient groups performed more slowly than the controls. Compared to CFS patients, patients with MDD needed significantly more time to copy the single lines but no such between-group performance difference was observed for the figure reproductions. In this latter copying task, the increasing complexity of the figures resulted in prolonged reaction times for all three participant groups with the effect being larger and the magnitude similar for the two patient groups.", 
    "60": "All patients were female and most were on psychotropic medication.", 
    "61": "Both the MDD and CFS patients tested demonstrated an overall fine motor slowing, with the motor component being more affected in the MDD patients than in the CFS patients while both patient groups showed similar cognitive impairments.", 
    "62": "The effects of the benzodiazepine agonist midazolam on the acquisition and expression of flavour preferences were investigated. Rats (Experiment 1) were given one-bottle training with one flavoured solution (CS+) mixed with either fructose or maltodextrin and another solution (CS-) presented alone. Animals receiving 1 mg/kg midazolam during training consumed more CS- than did animals receiving vehicle injections although there was no drug effect on CS+ consumption. In two-bottle tests the CS+ was preferred to the CS- with the preference being larger in fructose trained animals. Midazolam (0.3-3 mg/kg) increased total intake but not CS+ preference. Training under midazolam reduced the CS+ preference when fructose, but not maltodextrin, was the reinforcer. In Experiment 2 training consumption was restricted to 10 ml/session. This removed the difference in CS+ preference between reinforcer types but otherwise the results were as in Experiment 1. The midazolam induced attenuation of fructose-based preferences might reflect an increase in CS- palatability during training which would reduce the difference between the reinforced and non-reinforced solutions. As maltodextrin supports preferences due to post-ingestive effects manipulation of palatability should be ineffective. Midazolam does not influence the expression of conditioned flavour preferences despite prior evidence that benzodiazepine agonists enhance palatability.",

    "69": "Vesicular glutamate release from astrocytes depends on mobilization of free Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and extracellular space to elevate cytosolic Ca(2+) (Ca(2+)(cyt)). Although mitochondria in neurons, and other secretory cells, have been shown to sequester free Ca(2+) and have been implicated in the modulation of Ca(2+)-dependent transmitter release, the role of mitochondria in Ca(2+)-dependent glutamate release from astrocytes is not known. A pharmacological approach was taken to manipulate Ca(2+) accumulation in mitochondria and thereby affect Ca(2+)(cyt) of solitary astrocytes in response to mechanical stimuli. Ca(2+)(cyt) responses and levels of glutamate release were measured optically in parallel experiments using a fluorescent Ca(2+) indicator and an enzyme-linked assay, respectively. It was observed that inhibiting mitochondrial Ca(2+) accumulation is correlated to increased Ca(2+)(cyt) and glutamate release, whereas enhancing mitochondrial Ca(2+) accumulation is correlated to decreased Ca(2+)(cyt) and glutamate release. These observations suggest that, in addition to the activity of ER and plasma membrane ion channels, mitochondria modulate Ca(2+)(cyt) dynamics in astrocytes and play a role in Ca(2+)-dependent glutamate release from astrocytes.",

    "74": "The increase in opiate addicts in treatment with methadone, coupled with improved survival of HIV patients, has meant an increase in the demand for detoxification from this substance in our environment. It is common practice in hospital detoxification units to request a maximum dose of methadone (around 40 mg) on beginning detoxification treatment. However this is not always possible, due to the time needed for a gradual decrease for outpatients making daily visits to the methadone dispensing centres, due to the appearance of withdrawal symptoms, or because the patient starts out from very high doses of methadone. Reported here is an experience with 22 inpatients who over the last two years underwent detoxification from methadone without requesting from their treatment centres a maximum-limit dose at the start of their treatment. During the detoxification they are given treatment with clonidine and benzodiazepines (dosage being adjusted according to concomitant use of alcohol, benzodiazepines and cocaine) and non-opiate-based painkillers. On the seventh day they are given 50 mg of naltrexone. Of these addicts, 21 completed the detoxification adequately.", 
    "75": "Signs of physical dependence as a consequence of long-term drug use and a moderate abuse liability limit benzodiazepine clinical usefulness. Growing evidence suggests a role for voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) regulation in mediating a range of chronic drug effects from drug withdrawal phenomena to dependence on a variety of drugs of abuse. High voltage-activated (HVA) calcium currents were measured in whole-cell recordings from acutely isolated hippocampal CA1 neurons after a 1-week flurazepam (FZP) treatment that results in withdrawal-anxiety. An approximately 1.8-fold increase in Ca(2+) current density was detected immediately after and up to 2 days but not 3 or 4 days after drug withdrawal. Current density was unchanged after acute desalkyl-FZP treatment. A significant negative shift of the half-maximal potential of activation of HVA currents was also observed but steady-state inactivation remained unchanged. FZP and diazepam showed use- and concentration-dependent inhibition of Ca(2+) currents in hippocampal cultured cells following depolarizing trains (FZP, IC(50) = 1.8 microM; diazepam, IC(50) = 36 microM), pointing to an additional mechanism by which benzodiazepines modulate HVA Ca(2+) channels. Systemic preinjection of nimodipine (10 mg/kg), an L-type (L)-VGCC antagonist, prevented the benzodiazepine-induced increase in alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxasole-4-propionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic current in CA1 neurons 2 days after FZP withdrawal, suggesting that AMPAR potentiation, previously linked to withdrawal-anxiety may require enhanced L-VGCC-mediated Ca(2+) influx. Taken together with prior work, these findings suggest that enhanced Ca(2+) entry through HVA Ca(2+) channels may contribute to hippocampal AMPAR plasticity and serve as a potential mechanism underlying benzodiazepine physical dependence.", 
    "76": "The roles of the unstirred water layer (UWL) and receptor sink on the in-vitro transmembrane permeability of an increasingly lipophilic series of compounds (mannitol (MAN), diazepam (DIA) and cinnarizine (CIN)) have been assessed. Altered carbogen bubbling rates were used as a means to change the UWL thickness and polysorbate-80 (PS-80), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) were employed to alter sink conditions. After correction for solubilisation, Papp data for MAN, DIA and CIN were consistent across varying donor PS-80 concentrations suggesting that for the drugs examined here, the donor UWL did not limit in-vitro permeability. Similarly, altered bubbling rates and receptor sink conditions had no impact on the permeability of MAN. In contrast, decreasing the size of the receptor UWL or adding solubilising agents to the receptor sink resulted in modest enhancements to the permeability of the more lipophilic probe DIA. For the most lipophilic compound, CIN, very significant changes to measured permeability (>30 fold) were possible, but were most evident only after concomitant changes to both the UWL and sink conditions, suggesting that the effectiveness of enhanced sink conditions were dependent on a decrease in the width of the UWL.", 
    "77": "Inhaled sedation is efficient and easily controllable; in low concentrations it causes minimal changes in the patient and very little interference with hemodynamics. Awakening after inhaled sedation is quick and predictable. The major reason inhaled sedation has not become widely used in intensive care is that no commercially available administration device has been available.", 
    "78": "In our intensive care unit we conducted a prospective observational study to assess the feasibility, benefits, and costs of routine isoflurane sedation via the AnaConDa anesthetic-administration device. We included 15 adult patients who required > 24 hours of deep sedation. Conventional intravenous sedation (benzodiazepine and opioid) had been administered according to a sedation protocol that included a predetermined target Ramsay-scale sedation score. We then switched to inhaled isoflurane via the AnaConDa, and measured sedation efficacy, cumulative dose, and daily cost of sedation. Adverse events were prospectively defined and monitored.", 
    "79": "The sedation goal was reached with isoflurane in all 15 patients (P < .01, compared to the conventional sedation protocol). Hemodynamic changes were nonsignificant, and no renal or hepatic dysfunctions were observed. The frequency of meeting the sedation goal was significantly better with isoflurane than with our usual sedation protocol. With isoflurane, awakening from sedation was always <or= 4 hours, despite some long-duration sedations (up to 14.5 d). The overall daily cost of the 2 sedation protocols was not different in the whole group of 15 patients, but in the subgroup of 7 patients who required a mean midazolam infusion larger than the average dose, the cost difference was very significant (euro218 +/- 111 vs euro110 +/- 19, P < .01).",

    "81": "This study aimed to determine the consumption of benzodiazepines without prescription among first-year students from a nursing school of a public University in Ecuador. This is a descriptive, transversal and explanatory study with a quantitative approach. A questionnaire was used for data collection. The population studied was of 181 students. The results showed that 10.5% of the students had consumed benzodiazepine without prescription once in their lives. Of these, 6.1% consumed benzodiazepine in the last year, and 3.9% are currently consuming it. The diazepam was the most consumed BZD without prescription and pharmacies, were the place of higher access. The main reasons for the benzodiazepine consumption were: insomnia, anxiety, stress, depression, family and economical problems. The use of benzodiazepines with non-medicinal purposes is related to problems such as memory loss, retirement syndrome and sedation. When benzodiazepines are consumed jointly with alcohol or other drugs they can lead to coma or death. This study shows the serious consequences benzodiazepines cause when used by nursing students in Ecuador.",

Other significant predictors were antipsychotic or opioid drug use and the prescriber being a psychiatrist.", 
    "87": "Z-hypnotics were commonly prescribed. Norwegian drug therapy recommendations also suggest a preference for z-hypnotics. The clear predominance of the shorter acting z-hypnotics may be due to the fact that only longer acting benzodiazepines are available in Norway. Reasons for prescribing benzodiazepines may be co-morbid psychiatric illness, such as anxiety, or a belief that benzodiazepine hypnotics are more effective than z-hypnotics.", 
    "88": "It has been reported that infection interferes with drug metabolism, resulting in changes in pharmacokinetics. In this study, we investigated the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on hepatic total cytochrome P450 (CYP), CYP3A2, and CYP2C11 contents in a transient, LPS-induced, endotoxemia model of rats. In addition, to assess the effects on CYP3A2 activities, the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (CYP3A2 substrate) and 1-OH-midazolam (metabolite of midazolam) were investigated. Hepatic total CYP contents were significantly low until day 3 (P < 0.05) but returned to the control level on day 5. Hepatic CYP3A2 contents were significantly decreased on day 1 until day 5 (P < 0.05) but returned to the control level on day 7. Hepatic CYP2C11 contents were continuously low until day 7, and lowest on day 3. The AUC of 1-OH-midazolam was significantly decreased on day 1 after LPS administration (P < 0.01). In conclusion, LPS (5 mg/kg) challenge decreased hepatic total CYP, CYP3A2, and CYP2C11 contents and also decreased the activities of hepatic CYP3A2. It took at least 7 days for hepatic total CYP and CYP3A2 to recover to control levels, and it was suggested that the changes of hepatic total CYP contents might correlate with those of hepatic CYP3A2 contents and activities. Additionally, it is shown that their changes might reflect the recovery process from inflammation.",

Rabeprazole and lorazepam were extracted with ethyl ether and quantitated using a reverse-phase C(18) column. The method was specific as there were no interfering peaks in the human plasma eluting at the retention times of rabeprazole and lorazepam. The method was fully validated in human plasma for the concentration range of 20.0-1000.0 ng/ml. The correlation coefficients were greater than 0.999. Extraction recoveries were 72.3% for the drug and 79.1% for the internal standard. The method was simple, reliable, and accurate for the quantitation of rabeprazole in human plasma. The same plasma samples, which were collected in healthy male volunteers administered a 20 mg tablet of Pariet, were analyzed by HPLC and LC/MS/MS. As a result of that, there was no significant difference between pharmacokinetic parameters. The suitability of HPLC method for pharmacokinetic studies was verified by determining the relevant pharmacokinetic parameters.",

We examined the M1 muscarinic receptor density and mRNA expression in brains of a rat amphetamine model of schizophrenia. We also assessed the effect of the model and chronic treatment with haloperidol and clozapine on brain M1 receptor density and gene expression. A significant decrease of about 20% in the density of M1 receptor was detected in the cortex and in the striatum of amphetamine model rats. A significant increase of 33% in the density of the M1 receptor was found in the cortex and striatum of rats treated chronically with clozapine (0.5 mg/kg), but not with haloperidol (25 mg/kg). Chronic clozapine, but not haloperidol, normalized the decrease in M1 receptors observed in amphetamine model rats, in both cortex and striatum.

In this study, a qualitative drug screening method by liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry, earlier developed and evaluated for forensic toxicological urine analysis, was adapted for screening of basic drugs in hair. The method included alkaline hydrolysis, purification with mixed-mode solid phase extraction, and analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry with automated data analysis and reporting. Identification was based on accurate mass, isotopic pattern fit, and retention time, if available. Analysis of 32 hair samples from deceased drug addicts revealed 35 different drugs. The drug classes identified included antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, amphetamines, opioids, beta-blockers, a benzodiazepine, a hypnotic, a local anesthetic, an antiemetic, and an antipyretic analgesic. The findings were in good agreement with the findings in blood and urine by other methods. Moreover, information about previous drug use not evident in the analysis of other matrices was obtained in the majority (72%) of the cases. Tramadol was an especially predominant finding, suggesting tramadol abuse as an opioid substitute. One apparent false-positive finding was identified. The mean and median mass accuracies of positive findings were 2.3 and 1.8 ppm, corresponding to 0.5 and 0.4 mDa, respectively. Cutoff values for tramadol and methamphetamine in hair were 100 and 200 pg/mg, respectively.

I then used a propensity-score method to match individuals taking each drug on observed variables that are known to affect medication choices. The central challenge for estimation is that drug treatments are not randomly assigned among patients with bipolar disorder. To identify a causal link between choice of drugs and non-drug medical spending, I employed three different advanced econometrics techniques to assess the robustness of findings; namely interrupted time series, differencing strategies, and an instrumental variables approach.", 
    "109": "I found that compared to similar lithium users, olanzapine users spent approximately $330 more on monthly average non-drug medical services during the first year after initiation of drug treatment. The higher spending for olanzapine users was accounted for by both higher rates of re-hospitalization and more outpatient visits. In addition, olanzapine cost $153 per month while lithium cost $16 per month. Including the direct cost of the drugs, compared to similar patients taking lithium, patients with bipolar disorder taking olanzapine spent $5,600 more annually on health care services.", 
    "110": "These findings do not support the hypothesis that new drugs \"pay for themselves\" by reducing the need for other health care services in the case of olanzpine for bipolar disorder. This does not mean that the new drug is not \"cost-effective\" because increased \"benefits\" associated with the drug in terms of the improved quality of life may be worth the increased costs. However the findings do indicate that \"cost-offsets\" must be measured and not taken for granted. Incorporating such drug-offset evidence into policy and business decisions can facilitate appropriate clinical practices and improve efficiency of resource allocation. The methods used in this study to test for cost-offsets can be applied to other clinical areas and drug classes.",

    "119": "Depressive disorder is associated with problems of coping with life's difficulties, including episodes of frustration and disappointment, operationally defined as an unexpected reinforcer omission or a reduction of reinforcer magnitude. In a novel model aimed at detecting potential antidepressants, rats were trained in the operant task under progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement with the break point (BP, the value of the last completed response ratio) as a behavioral endpoint. In the main experiment, a 32% sucrose solution was initially used as the reinforcer. Once the stable responding was achieved, for the following 5 days animals were treated once daily with the experimental drugs, and were offered a 4% sucrose solution instead. In vehicle-treated controls, the reduction of sucrose concentration resulted in a decrease in responding from a BP of about 40 (totaling 166 responses) to a BP of about 9 (totaling 22 responses). Chlordiazepoxide (4 and 8 mg/kg), fluoxetine (3 mg/kg), citalopram (6 mg/kg) and cocaine (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) markedly inhibited this response decrement, while fluoxetine (6 mg/kg) augmented it. Neither desipramine (1-6 mg/kg) nor morphine (1-5 mg/kg) affected responding under the reduced sucrose concentration condition. In the control experiment, the rats have never been offered 32% sucrose solution but their responding was always maintained by 4% sucrose. Under these unchanged conditions, only cocaine (5 mg/kg) affected (increased) responding. The present results suggest that the antidepressants selectively inhibiting serotonin reuptake and a benzodiazepine anxiolytic but not psychostimulant cocaine may specifically protect animals from the effects of a reinforcer downshift.", 
    "120": "One week oral flurazepam (FZP) administration in rats results in reduced GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in CA1 pyramidal neurons associated with benzodiazepine tolerance in vivo and in vitro. Since voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) current density is enhanced twofold during chronic FZP treatment, the role of L-type VGCCs in regulating benzodiazepine-induced changes in CA1 neuron GABA(A) receptor-mediated function was evaluated. Nimodipine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle (0.5% Tween 80, 2 ml/kg) was injected 1 day after ending FZP treatment and 24 h prior to hippocampal slice preparation for measurement of mIPSC characteristics and in vitro tolerance to zolpidem. The reduction in GABA(A) receptor-mediated mIPSC amplitude and estimated unitary channel conductance measured 2 days after drug removal was no longer observed following prior nimodipine injection. However, the single nimodipine injection failed to prevent in vitro tolerance to zolpidem's ability to prolong mIPSC decay in FZP-treated neurons, suggesting multiple mechanisms may be involved in regulating GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic transmission following chronic FZP administration. As reported previously in recombinant receptors, nimodipine inhibited synaptic GABA(A) receptor currents only at high concentrations (>30 muM), significantly greater than attained in vivo (1 muM) 45 min after a single antagonist injection. Thus, the effects of nimodipine were unlikely to be related to direct effects on GABA(A) receptors. As with nimodipine injection, buffering intracellular free [Ca(2+)] with BAPTA similarly prevented the effects on GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic transmission, suggesting intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis is important to maintain GABA(A) receptor function. The findings further support a role for activation of L-type VGCCs, and perhaps other Ca(2+)-mediated signaling pathways, in the modulation of GABA(A) receptor synaptic function following chronic benzodiazepine administration, independent of modulation of the allosteric interactions between benzodiazepine and GABA binding sites.", 
    "121": "Fatal familial insomnia, a human prion disease, Morvan's chorea, an autoimmune limbic encephalopathy, and delirium tremens, the well-known alcohol (or benzodiazepine [BDZ]) withdrawal syndrome, share a clinical phenotype largely consisting in an inability to sleep associated with motor and autonomic activation. Agrypnia excitata is the term which aptly defines this clinical condition, whose pathogenetic mechanism consists in an intralimbic disconnection releasing the hypothalamus and brainstem reticular formation from corticolimbic inhibitory control. Severance of cortical-subcortical limbic structures is due to visceral thalamus degeneration in fatal familial insomnia, and may depend on autoantibodies blocking voltage-gated potassium channels within the limbic system in Morvan's chorea, and the sudden changes in gabaergic synapses down-regulated by chronic alcohol abuse within the limbic system in delirium tremens. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that a neuronal network, extending from the medulla to the limbic cortex, controls the sleep-wake cycle, operating in an integrated fashion following a caudorostral organization.",

Sample pretreatment consisted of protein precipitation from 100microl of plasma using acetonitrile containing the internal standard (diazepam D5). Chromatographic separation was performed on a X-Terra MS C8 column (100mmx2.1mm, i.d. 3.5microm), with a quick stepwise gradient using a formate buffer (pH 3, 2mM) and acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.2ml/min. The triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode and multiple reaction monitoring was used for drug quantification. The method was validated over the concentration ranges of 1-500ng/ml for diazepam, 0.25-50ng/ml for atropine and 5-1000ng/ml for pralidoxime. The coefficients of variation were always <15% for both intra-day and inter-day precision for each analyte. Mean accuracies were also within +/-15%.

The case suggests strong anticonvulsant properties of ketamine even after failure of GABAergic anesthetics, likely due to increased NMDA receptor expression with ongoing seizure activity. Thus, ketamine should be incorporated into therapeutic regimens for difficult-to-treat SE.",

In the current analysis, we retrospectively applied Bayesian adaptive allocation methods to a case study in agitated patients with schizophrenia and related diseases. The original study used a randomized, double-blind, parallel design. The objective of this analysis was to demonstrate the potential benefits of Bayesian adaptive designs by shortening the study duration and therefore limiting patient exposure to ineffective placebo or an active comparator with a known side effect. Bayesian methods allowed us to fully leverage historical data along with data observed as the study was ongoing to calculate predictive probabilities of patient response to treatment without experiencing a specified side effect. Using the Bayesian adaptive approach would have required less than half the number of patients as the original study to draw the same conclusion. Sample size was reduced from 311 to 156 patients, thereby decreasing the number of patients exposed to placebo from 54 to 30 and the number exposed to the active control with a known side effect from 126 to 60.",

The elderly also receive other psychiatric medications to induce sleep, although these are off-label uses not well supported by research literature. There is also no literature support for the use of over-the-counter sleep preparations, although both melatonin and a melatonin receptor agonist appear to be moderately effective and safe.

    "137": "We have used metadynamics to investigate the mechanism of noncovalent dissociation from DNA by two representatives of alkylating and noncovalent minor groove (MG) binders. The compounds are anthramycin in its anhydrous form (IMI) and distamycin A (DST), which differ in mode of binding, size, flexibility and net charge. This choice enables to evaluate the influence of such factors on the mechanism of dissociation. Dissociation of IMI requires an activation free energy of approximately 12 kcal/mol and occurs via local widening of the MG and loss of contacts between the drug and one DNA strand, along with the insertion of waters in between. The detachment of DST occurs at a larger free energy cost, approximately 16.5 or approximately 18 kcal/mol depending on the binding mode. These values compare well with that of 16.6 kcal/mol extracted from stopped-flow experiments. In contrast to IMI, an intermediate is found in which the ligand is anchored to the DNA through its amidinium tail. From this conformation, binding and unbinding occur almost at the same rate. Comparison between DST and with kinetic models for the dissociation of Hoechst 33258 from DNA uncovers common characteristics across different classes of noncovalent MG ligands.",

Consecutively olanzapine concentrations in the milk and plasma of the mother and in the infant were measured with tandem mass spectroscopy over a period of five month. The results show a relatively high plasma level in the infant aged four month, probably referring to an immature hepatic transformation system, especially CYP1A2. In the following four months plasma levels of olanzapine decreased to very low, even undetectable concentrations in the infant.

We conducted an 8-week, rater-blinded, flexible dose study. Seventy patients with schizophrenia, who met the DSM-IV research criteria of having neuroleptic-induced acute dystonia or parkinsonism, were randomly assigned to risperidone or olanzapine group. The primary outcome was a comparison of the incidence of concomitant anticholinergic drugs usage between the groups to manage their acute dystonia and parkinsonism. The average doses of risperidone and olanzapine from baseline to study end point were 1.8-3.5 mg/day and 7.7-11.7 mg/day, respectively. There were no significant differences in demographic data, severity of EPS or psychotic symptoms between the groups at baseline assessment. Patients taking risperidone had significantly higher incidence of using anticholinergic drugs to manage acute dystonia or parkinsonism overall during the study (OR = 5.17, 95%CI = 1.49-17.88, P = 0.013). There was no significant between-group difference in the changing of rating scales of EPS and psychotic symptoms.

Both patients met DSM IV criteria for bipolar I disorder experiencing a manic episode without comorbid conditions. This was an inpatient study, and the efficacy, tolerability and side effects were assessed. Both patients received placebo for the initial 5 days and CBD from the 6th to 30th day (initial oral dose of 600 mg reaching 1200 mg/ day). From the 6th to the 20th day, the first patient (a 34-year-old woman) received adjunctive olanzapine (oral dose of 10-15 mg). On day 31, CBD treatment was discontinued and replaced by placebo for 5 days. The first patient showed symptoms improvement while on olanzapine plus CBD, but showed no additional improvement during CBD monotherapy. The second patient (a 36-year-old woman) had no symptoms improvement with any dose of CBD during the trial. Both patients tolerated CBD very well and no side-effects were reported. These preliminary data suggest that CBD may not be effective for the manic episode of BAD.",

    "147": "Learning potential and memory capacity are factors that strongly predict the level of rehabilitation and the long-term functional outcome in patients with schizophrenia. Unfortunately, however, the effects of antipsychotic drugs (i.e. the primary treatments for schizophrenia) on these components of cognition are unclear, particularly when they are administered chronically (i.e. a standard clinical practice). In this rodent study we evaluated the effects of different time periods (ranging from 2 weeks to 6 months) of oral treatment with the first generation antipsychotic chlorpromazine (10.0 mg/kg/day), or the second generation antipsychotic olanzapine (10.0 mg/kg/day) on the repeated acquisition of a water maze task (i.e. a method of assessing spatial learning potential in a repeated testing format). We assessed locomotor function (in an open field) and employed a radial arm maze (RAM) task to assess antipsychotic effects (5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg/day doses) on spatial working memory during the treatment period between 15 days and 2 months. Finally, we conducted experiments using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to evaluate the therapeutic relevance of our method of drug delivery (oral administration in drinking water). In the water maze experiments, both antipsychotics were associated with impairments in acquisition in the earlier test sessions that could eventually be overcome with repeated testing while olanzapine also impaired retention in probe trials. Both antipsychotics were also associated with impairments in delayed non-match-to-position trials in the RAM and some impairments of motor function (especially in the case of olanzapine) as indicated by slightly reduced swim speeds in the water maze and decreased activity in some components of the open field assessment. Finally, LC-MS/MS studies indicated that the method of antipsychotic administration generated clinically relevant plasma levels in the rat. These animal data indicate that chronic oral treatment with chlorpromazine or olanzapine can impair the performance of tasks designed to assess specific components of cognition that are affected in schizophrenia.", 
    "148": "Evidences from studies using electrical or chemical stimulation of the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) suggest that whereas the dorsal PAG is critical for the regulation of panic-related defensive behaviors, the ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG) modulates generalized anxiety-related responses. In the present study we evaluated whether the activation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/2C receptors in the ventrolateral column of the periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) causes differential effects on an anxiety- and a panic-related defensive behavior, respectively, inhibitory avoidance and escape, in male Wistar rats submitted to the elevated T-maze. Our results showed that intra-vlPAG injection of the endogenous agonist serotonin, the 5-HT1A/7 agonist 8-OH-DPAT or 5-HT2A/2C agonist DOI impaired the acquisition of inhibitory avoidance, without interfering with escape performance. The same selective anxiolytic effect was also observed after local administration of the benzodiazepine receptor agonist midazolam. Moreover, as shown by the results of antagonism studies, 5-HT2A receptors are recruited for the anxiolysis caused by serotonin and DOI, while 5-HT1A receptors account for the effect of 8-OH-DPAT. In conclusion, our data show that the activation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors in the vlPAG affects defensive responses related to generalized anxiety, but not panic disorder.",

Medical literature, published on orally disintegrating formulation of olanzapine identified using Pubmed and EMBASE, was used. Additional references were identified from the reference lists of published articles. Bibliographical information, including contributory unpublished data, was also requested from the company developing the drug.

The hypermetabolism was in the left frontotemporal region in patients with ictal aphasia and in the bilateral hippocampal region in the patient with amnesia. Three patients who received intravenous benzodiazepines during their episodes had transient clinical improvement. With antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment, symptoms gradually resolved in all patients. Concomitant resolution of PET hypermetabolism was documented in three patients who had follow up scans. One patient with ictal aphasia later developed recurrent episodes, each with recurrent PET hypermetabolism. This patient and one other patient required immune-modulating therapy in addition to AEDs.",

    "162": "Given the well-established problems with sleep at high altitude, it is not uncommon for people planning trips to the mountains to seek advice from clinicians regarding pharmacologic options for improving sleep during their trip. This review article considers the various medications that have been studied for this purpose at high altitude with an emphasis on both their efficacy and safety. The available data support the use of either acetazolamide, temazepam, zolpidem or zaleplon in this environment. Other agents commonly used at sea-level such as eszopiclone and diphenhydramine have not been studied at high altitude but are likely safe to use given their mechanism of action and known side effects. Limited evidence suggests diazepam may cause hypoventilation at high altitude and its use in this environment should be discouraged. Insufficient data exist to determine which agent is most effective at altitude nor do we know whether combination therapy with acetazolamide and a hypnotic agent offers any benefits over monotherapy.", 
    "163": "Chronic microglial activation is an important component of many neurological disorders, and imaging activated microglia in vivo will enable the detection and improved treatment of neuroinflammation. 1-(2-chlorphenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline-carbox-amide (PK11195), a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand, has been used to image neuroinflammation, but the extent to which PK11195 binding distinguishes activated microglia and reactive astrocytes is unclear. Moreover, PK11195 may lack sufficient sensitivity for detecting mild neuroinflammation. We hypothesized that N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-N-(4-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl) acetamide (DAA1106), a new ligand that binds specifically to peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, binds to activated microglia in human neurological diseases with higher affinity than does PK11195. We therefore compared the pharmacological binding properties of [3H](R)-PK11195 and [3H]DAA1106 in postmortem tissues from patients with cerebral infarcts, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal dementia, and multiple sclerosis (n=10 each). In all diseases, [3H]DAA1106 showed a higher binding affinity as reflected by lower dissociation constant (KD) values than that of [3H](R)-PK11195. Moreover, specific binding of both ligands correlated with the presence of activated microglia identified by immunohistochemistry in situ. We conclude that 1) ligands that bind peripheral benzodiazepine receptor mainly label activated microglia in human neurological disorders and that 2) DAA1106 may possess binding characteristics superior to those of PK11195, which may be beneficial for in vivo positron emission tomography imaging.", 
    "164": "We report a case of transient cortical blindness that occurred after coronary angiography and angioplasty performed through the right radial artery. This is a very rare entity, the physiopathology of which remains largely speculative. The most likely mechanism appears to be the local disruption of the blood-brain barrier by the contrast agent, possibly favoured by predisposing factors, which may cause a direct neurotoxic effect. All contrast agents can be associated with this complication, which does not seem to be volume dependent. The outcome is generally favourable, with spontaneous return of sight within 24-48 h and no requirement for specific therapy. Recurrence has never been reported.", 
    "165": "Behavioral studies have suggested an involvement of the glutamate pathway in the mechanism of action of anxiolytic drugs, including the NMDA receptor complex. It was shown that magnesium, an NMDA receptor inhibitor, exhibited anxiolytic-like activity in the elevated plus-maze test in mice. The purpose of the present study was to examine interaction between magnesium and benzodiazepine/GABA(A) receptors in producing anxiolytic-like activity. We examined behavior of mice treated with magnesium and benzodiazepine/GABA(A) receptor ligands, in the elevated plus maze. The anxiolytic-like effect of magnesium (20 mg/kg) was antagonized by flumazenil (10 mg/kg) (benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) while combined treatment with the non-effective doses of magnesium (10 mg/kg) and benzodiazepines (diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) or chlordiazepoxide (2 mg/kg)) produced synergistic interaction (increased time in open arms and number of open arm entries) in this test. The obtained data indicate that benzodiazepine receptors are involved in the anxiolytic-like effects of magnesium.", 
    "166": "Chronic treatment with the benzodiazepines is well known to produce tolerance, which has been extensively documented to be attributed to modifications in the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurotransmission. However, literature data have also suggested the participation of different neurotransmitter systems, including glutamatergic, in benzodiazepine tolerance. The purpose of the present study was to determine the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the development of tolerance to the motor dysfunction induced by chronic administration of diazepam. The motor performance was assessed on the 1st and 10th day of experiment, using the rotarod and chimney tests in mice. Treatment of animals with both non-selective NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors: N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG) and selective NOS inhibitor: 7-nitroindazole was able to prevent the development of tolerance to the motor impairing effect of diazepam. Moreover, administration of L-arginine, a NO precursor, facilitated the development of diazepam-induced tolerance in rotarod test. These findings suggest that NO may be involved, at least in part, in the tolerance to the motor dysfunction, developed during the chronic administration of diazepam in mice.",

Nevertheless, estimated differences narrowed when analyses included only patients with schizophrenia. Risperidone performed better than olanzapine when diagnosis was not limited to schizophrenia, and quetiapine outperformed olanzapine and risperidone when the analysis did not control for treatment history. This latter result reflects the disproportionate use of quetiapine in long-duration augmentation episodes. There were no statistical differences across alternative atypical antipsychotics once the analysis excluded patients without a diagnosis of schizophrenia and included patient treatment history in the analysis.",

During training, cocaine delivery was paired with the presentation of a tone and the illumination of a houselight. Once a stable baseline of cocaine self-administration was observed, lever pressing was extinguished to less than 20% of baseline rates. During reinstatement testing, responding resulted in the presentation of the conditioned reinforcer (i.e., the houselight and tone previously paired with self-administered cocaine).", 
    "178": "The response-contingent presentation of the conditioned reinforcer reliably reinstated cocaine seeking. Pretreatment with alprazolam (2 or 4 mg/kg, ip) or oxazepam (20 or 40 mg/kg, ip) reversed the conditioned reinforcer-induced reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-seeking behavior at doses that did not reliably affect the conditioned reinforcer-induced reinstatement of extinguished food seeking, suggesting that benzodiazepines may not have reduced reinstatement responding due to non-specific reductions in behavior.",

    "185": "Tobacco consumption has been recognized as a factor mediating the interindividual variations in olanzapine's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The primary objective of this study was to describe the dose effect of smoking on the dose-plasma concentration relationship and the pharmacokinetics of oral olanzapine in male schizophrenic patients using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detector. Twenty-seven male schizophrenic inpatients were recruited and were stratified into the following groups according to smoking behaviors: non-smokers (n=9), light-smokers (1-4 cigarettes per day; n=9), and heavy-smokers (>or=5 cigarettes per day; n=9). Plasma olanzapine concentrations were determined up to 120 h following a single oral dose of 10 mg olanzapine. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by the non-compartment method using WinNonlin software. Results show that there was a significant correlation among non-smokers (n=9; 0.79; p=0.01) or combined with light-smokers (n=18; 0.62; p<0.01) between peak plasma olanzapine concentrations (Cmax) and their individual dose-corrected by body weight, but this correlation did not appear in heavy-smokers. There were no significant differences between non-smokers and light-smokers except for significant decreased AUC0-->120 by 45.1% in light-smokers. The mean C(max) and the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 120 h (AUC0-->120) of the heavy-smoking patients was 9.3+/-4.3 ng/ml (65.2% reduction compared to the non-smokers) and 302.4+/-167.8 h ng/ml (67.6% reduction compared to the non-smokers), respectively. In summary, a daily consumption of 5 cigarettes is probably sufficient for induction of olanzapine metabolism. Smoking cessation is recommended for olanzapine therapy to have better prediction for therapeutic dosages particularly in heavy-smokers. Compared to non-smokers, heavy-smokers therefore require a 50-100% increase in olanzapine doses. Therapeutic drug monitoring will need to be considered when schizophrenic patients change their smoking behaviors.",

Current evidence suggests that early noninvasive continuous positive airway pressure and early aggressive preload reduction with intravenous nitroglycerin are first-line interventions. Afterload reduction with sublingual captopril, with or without nitroglycerin, improves outcomes and is a second-line intervention. Furosemide is associated with adverse outcomes when used alone and should be given only after vasodilator therapy as a third-line intervention. Inotropes should be used only with demonstrably poor perfusion as they do not improve outcomes and may indeed be associated with increased mortality. Concurrent vasodilator therapy should be considered as soon as possible. Morphine should not be used as it is associated with adverse outcomes.

All available data on the efficacy of antipsychotics (APs) and the outcome in DP date back to the era of first-generation antipsychotics, whereas such data are lacking for second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs). To study outcome and efficacy of SGAs in all forms of DP by means of a case-based analysis, we extracted 63 cases from 434 available publications and assessed them by 2 independent raters using standardized criteria for efficacy and outcome. The time course of response and the SGA doses used in DP were also first studied. The sample was comparable to classic samples and comprised mainly secondary DP cases (56%). The median onset of effect occurred after 1.5 weeks, and the maximum effect occurred after 6 weeks (later in primary than secondary DP, 10 vs 3 weeks; P < 0.004). If a treatment of more than 8 weeks could be established, all cases responded at least partially. In the outcome analysis, partial or full remission was performed by 75% of cases (final outcome, therapy switches allowed). In the efficacy analysis, partial or full remission was reached in 69% of the situations when an SGA was introduced (without therapy switches). Secondary DP was more likely to respond to SGAs than primary DP (78% vs 59% trend). Risperidone and olanzapine were most widely used and resulted in full or partial remission in 69% and 72%, respectively. Doses were lower than those used in schizophrenia. This first retrospective case-based study provides low-level evidence that SGAs are effective in DP and that outcome is favorable, although a publication bias is likely.

    "198": "The newer atypical antipsychotics, as a class, have been associated with an increased risk of weight gain and metabolic abnormalities. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are currently unclear, but there are data to suggest the possibility of an immediate (as opposed to chronic) effect of these drugs. The aim of the present study was to assess the acute effects of olanzapine on specific measures of insulin sensitivity and secretion. Healthy animals were tested in either the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic or the hyperglycemic clamp. After reaching steady state in the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, rats were injected with olanzapine (3 mg/kg sc) and monitored for an additional 130 minutes. In the hyperglycemic clamp, olanzapine was injected approximately 90 minutes before receiving a glucose bolus, and hyperglycemia was maintained via exogenous glucose infusion for an additional 90 minutes. Insulin and C-peptide levels were monitored throughout this clamp.Acute administration of olanzapine significantly lowered the glucose infusion rate due to an increase in hepatic glucose production and a decrease in glucose utilization. Olanzapine pretreatment induced hyperglycemia and markedly decreased plasma insulin and C-peptide in response to the glucose challenge. These findings indicate that olanzapine can directly induce metabolic changes that occur rapidly and well in advance of the changes that might be anticipated as a result of its weight-gain liability. We present novel findings highlighting an olanzapine-induced deficit in beta-cell functioning.", 
    "199": "The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of olanzapine, clozapine, and haloperidol on neurocognitive function in schizophrenic patients who present with documented episodes of physical aggression and to determine whether change in cognitive function is related to aggression. One hundred physically aggressive schizophrenic inpatients were assigned to a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 12-week treatment, and received cognitive evaluations at baseline. There were 33, 34, and 33 subjects in the clozapine, olanzapine, and haloperidol groups, respectively. They were administered a battery of tests assessing psychomotor function, general executive function, visual and verbal memory, and visuospatial ability. A general cognitive index was derived from the above battery. The overall score on the Modified Overt Aggression Scale was used to measure the number and severity of the aggressive events. Psychiatric symptoms and side effects were also assessed. The improvement in the general cognitive index differed significantly among the 3 treatment groups, with olanzapine being superior to both haloperidol and clozapine. Further analyses revealed significantly greater improvement with olanzapine in several cognitive domains. Furthermore, improvement in the general cognitive index was significantly associated with a decrease in aggression in the olanzapine group but not in the other 2 medication groups. In violent schizophrenic patients, olanzapine treatment is associated with better cognitive functioning relative to haloperidol and clozapine. This improvement in neurocognitive function is associated with a decrease in aggressive behavior. As clozapine markedly reduced aggression, there may be different pathways for the antiaggressive effect of olanzapine and that of clozapine.",

Fifty-eight emergency patients diagnosed with irreversible pulpitis of a mandibular posterior tooth randomly received, in a double-blind manner, an identical sublingual tablet of either 0.25 mg of triazolam or a placebo 30 minutes before administration of a conventional IAN block. Access was begun 15 minutes after completion of the IAN block, and all patients had profound lip numbness. Success was defined as no or mild pain (visual analog scale recordings) on access or initial instrumentation. The success rate for the IAN block was 43% with triazolam and 57% with the placebo, with no significant difference (P = .43) between the 2 groups. For mandibular posterior teeth, triazolam in a sublingual dose of 0.25 mg did not result in an increase in success of the IAN block in patients with irreversible pulpitis. Therefore, when using conscious sedation, profound local anesthesia is still required to eliminate the sensation of pain during endodontic treatment for patients with irreversible pulpitis.", 
    "207": "Vinpocetine (ethyl apovincaminate), a synthetic derivative of the Vinca minor alkaloid vincamine, is widely used for the treatment of cerebrovascular-related diseases. One of the proposed mechanisms underlying its action is to protect against the cytotoxic effects of glutamate overexposure. Glutamate excitotoxicity leads to the disregulation of mitochondrial function and neuronal metabolism. As Vinpocetine has a binding affinity to the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) involved in the mitochondrial transition pore complex, we investigated whether neuroprotection can be at least partially due to Vinpocetine's effects on PBRs. Neuroprotective effects of PK11195 and Ro5-4864, two drugs with selective and high affinity to PBR, were compared to Vinpocetine in glutamate excitotoxicity assays on primary cortical neuronal cultures. Vinpocetine exerted a neuroprotective action in a 1-50microM concentration range while PK11195 and Ro5-4864 were only slightly neuroprotective, especially in high (>25microM) concentrations. Combined pretreatment of neuronal cultures with Vinpocetine and PK11195 or Ro5-4864 showed increased neuroprotection in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the different drugs may have different targets. To test this hypothesis, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) of cultured neurons was measured by flow cytometry. 25microM Vinpocetine reduced the decrease of mitochondrial inner membrane potential induced by glutamate exposure, but Ro5-4864 in itself was found to be more potent to block glutamate-evoked changes in MMP. Combination of Ro5-4864 and Vinpocetine treatment was found to be even more effective. In summary, the present results indicate that the neuroprotective action of vinpocetine in culture can not be explained by its effect on neuronal PBRs alone and that additional drug targets are involved.", 
    "208": "Neuropeptide S (NPS) has been recently identified as the endogenous ligand of a previously orphan G-protein-coupled receptor now named NPSR. Both NPS and its receptor are expressed in the brain, where they modulate different functions. In particular, it has been demonstrated that intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of NPS in rodents increases wakefulness and promotes anxiolytic-like effects. In the present study we used the defensive burying (DB) test in rats to further investigate the action of human NPS (0.1-10 nmol, i.c.v.) on anxiety-related behaviors. Diazepam (1.5mg/kg, i.p.) and caffeine (20mg/kg, i.p.) were used in parallel experiments as standard anxiolytic and anxiogenic drugs, respectively. None of the tested drugs produced statistical differences in the latency to contact the probe, burying behavior latency, number of shocks received or immobility/freezing duration. Caffeine increased cumulative burying behavior and the buried bedding height in a statistically significant manner thus promoting anxiogenic like effects. Opposite results were obtained with diazepam that significantly reduced these behavioral parameters. The anxiolytic-like action of diazepam was mimicked by NPS that reduced cumulative burying behavior in a dose dependent manner. Collectively, robust anxiolytic-like effects were recorded in response to NPS in the DB test. These results are of particular interest since the outcome of this assay is marginally influenced by drug effects on locomotor activity. In conclusion, we provide further evidence that NPS evokes genuine anxiolytic-like effects in the rat; therefore NPSR selective agonists are worthy of development as innovative drugs for the treatment of anxiety disorders."
