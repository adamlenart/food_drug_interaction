After induction of anesthesia the heart rate diminished by 21.4%, the mean pressure by 12.2% in the same time decreased the cardiac output by 19.3%, the calculated total peripheral resistance increased by 13%. The oxygen uptake decreased by 16%. The advantages and contraindications of this technique in neuroanesthesia are discussed.", 
    "1": "1 Salivary and plasma diazepam and nordiazepam concentrations were measured in 51 paired samples from four experimental situations. In seven of the patients CSF samples were estimated. 2 Correlation of 0.89 (P less than 0.001) was observed between salivary and plasma diazepam and 0.81 (P less than 0.001) between salivary and plasma nordiazepam. 3 Mean salivary diazepam was 1.6% (+/- 0.3%) of the plasma diazepam. It was found to vary markedly in an acute dosage study. Mean salivary nordiazepam was 2.9% (+/- 1%) of the plasma measure and was dependent on salivary flow rate. 4 CSF diazepam was in equilibrium with unbound plasma diazepam and salivary diazepam. 5 Mean protein binding of diazepam in vitro was 99.3% with no variations as a function of concentration. 6 The results suggest salivary diazepam and nordiazepam measures to be of value in epidemiological studies. However, they do not predict accurately the plasma total or unbound drug concentration from a salivary sample in an individual.", 
    "2": "The effects of heparin, 1,000 U intravenously, on the blood, plasma, and free concentrations of diazepam and its metabolite, N-desmethyldiazepam, have been investigated 3 hr after oral administration of 10 mg diazepam to 5 normal subjects. The percent free diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam increased 15 min after heparin from 1.66 +/- 0.35 to 3.99 +/- 1.88 (mean +/- SD; p less than 0.05) in the case of diazepam anolite. The actual free concentration of diazepam rose from 3.6 +/- 1.04 to 6.9 +/- 1.33 ng/ml (p less than 0.05) 15 min after heparin while total blood concentration was unchanged (144 +/- 54 vs 130 +/- 57 ng/ml). Free concentrations of N-desmethyldiazepam rose from 0.62 +/- 0.17 to 1.01 +/- 0.34 but the effect, though consistent, was not statistically significant. Blood concentrations did not change (15 +/- 3.2 vs 14 +/- 3.9 ng/ml). That free drug level rose without a change in blood or total plasma levels suggests that factors other than simple plasma binding displacement are involved in this drug interaction.", 
    "3": "Benzodiazepines probably exert their anxiolytic, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant effects by interacting with brain-specific high-affinity benzodiazepine receptors. In searching for possible endogenous ligands for these receptors we have purified a compound 10(7)-fold from human urine by extractions, treatment with hot ethanol, and column chromatography. The compound was identified as beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (IIc) by mass spectrometry, NMR spectrometry, and synthesis; IIc was also isolated from brain tissues (20 ng/g) by similar procedures. Very small concentrations of IIc displaced [3H]diazepam completely from specific cerebral receptors, but not from liver and kidney binding sites; the concentration causing 50% inhibition of specific [3H]diazepam binding (IC50) was 4-7 nM compared to ca. 5 nM for the potent benzodiazepine lorazepam. Specific binding sites for quinuclidinyl benzilate, naloxone, spiroperidol, serotonin, muscimol, and WB 4101 were not affected by IIc. In contrast to benzodiazepines, IIc exhibits \"mixed type\" competitive inhibition of forebrain benzodiazepine receptors (negative cooperativity). We surmise that an endogenous ligand for benzodiazepine receptors may be a derivative of beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid.", 
    "4": "The literature was reviewed to obtain data from 11 mammalian species on liver weight, hepatic blood flow, and antipyrine intrinsic clearance. It was demonstrated that liver weight and hepatic blood flow in all species could be readily related to body weight by a simple equation. Additionally, hepatic blood flow in all species was directly proportional to liver weight. With the exception of man, antipyrine intrinsic clearance was also directly proportional to liver weight. Man's intrinsic clearance was approximately one-seventh of that which would be predicted from other species. Data on benzodiazepines and phenytoin showed a similar pattern.", 
    "5": "Four 11-(1-piperazinyl)-5H-pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines were prepared and evaluated as central nervous system agents. All were active psychotropic agents as determined by animal screening tests. The most interesting compound, 11-(1-piperazinyl)-5H-pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine, showed dual activity as an antidepressant against tetrabenazine depression and as a neuroleptic as measured by protection vs. amphetamine lethality in grouped mice.", 
    "6": "A series of 2,4-dihydro-6-phenyl-1H-s-triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepin-1-ones was prepared and evaluated for central nervous system activity. It was found that the 2-methyl-substituted analogues had interesting activity in tests useful for detecting anxiolytic agents, while N-2 substitution with omega-(dialkylamino)alkyl substituents give compounds with antidepressant potential as well as antianxiety activity.", 
    "7": "A series of 1-(aminoalkyl)-6-aryl-4H-s-triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepines has been prepared and evaluated for central nervous system activity. We have found that members of this series have activity in pharmacological test systems designed to detect both anxiolytic and antidepressant activity. Each type of activity could be varied independently by appropriate substituent selections.", 
    "8": "The use of flunitrazepam 1 and 1.5 mg was compared as a premedicant with diazepam 10 mg and lorazepam 2.5 mg. Plasma flunitrazepam concentration were measured after oral and i.m. administration. Flunitrazepam and diazepam had a similar onset time and duration of action, both being more rapid in onset and shorter in duration than lorazepam I.m. flunitrazepam had a slightly greater sedative effect than oral flunitrazepam and plasma concentrations correlated well with the onset of the sedative effect by either route of administration. The i.m. injection of flunitrazepam was not as painful as that of diazepam, but slightly more painful than lorzepam. A second peak occurred at about 5 h and flunitrazepam was still detectable at 48 h. The plasma half-life was 3-4 h.", 
    "9": "Flunitrazepam 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg was given by the oral or i.m. routes to groups of volunteers and its effects compared. Plasma concentrations of the drug were estimated by gas-liquid chromatography, in a smaller number of the subjects. The most striking effect was sedation which increased with the dose, 2 mg producing deep sleep although the subjects could still be aroused. The effects of i.m. administration were apparent earlier and sometimes lasted longer than those following oral administration. Dizziness was less marked than sedation, but increased with the dose. There was pain on i.m. injection of flunitrazepam significantly more often than with isotonic saline. Plasma concentrations varied with dose and route and corresponded qualitatively with the subjective effects. The drug was still present in measurable quantities after 24 h even with the smallest dose.", 
    "10": "Diazepam 10 and 20 mg, lorazepam 2.5 and 5.0 mg, flunitrazepam 1 and 2 mg, and a placebo, were compared in a randomized double-blind controlled trial as oral premedication for 210 patients undergoing minor gynaecological surgery. Flunitrazepam 1 mg and lorazepam 2.5 mg were superior to placebo (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.05 respectively) in relieving patient anxiety when assessed by a trained observer 60 min after premedication. Flunitrazepam 1 mg also produced more drowsiness (P less than 0.01) than the placebo. Comparisons of other low-dose benzodiazepine groups with the placebo, and of the large dose with the small dose of each drug revealed no significant changes in anxiolysis or drowsiness. Dizziness and prolonged drowsiness were not apparent with low-dose flunitrazepam. The data suggests that flunitrazepam 1 mg offers advantages over placebo, diazepam 10 mg and lorazepam 2.5 mg for routine oral premedication in minor gynaecological surgery.", 
    "11": "The advent of the widespread use of selective detectors (electron capture detector, phosphorus/nitrogen dectector) for gas--liquid chromatography used in toxicological analyses has revealed the presence of hitherto unseen interfering materials. These substances may be conveniently grouped into (1), anti-oxidants; (2), putrefactive and endogenous compounds; (3), pesticides; (4), food additives, flavours and fragrances; (5) plasticisers, plastic additives and vulcanising agents and (6), scintillation reagents. To facilitate the identification of these materials, retention indices on the dimethyl silicone phases SE-30 or OV-1 have been compiled by the two laboratories to include 296 such compounds. Most gave single peaks, but some gave complex patterns indicating that they were mixtures of compounds. Of the 296 compounds, 14 did not give observable peaks, 8 gave 2 or 3 peaks and 44 gave more than 3 peaks. To determine the interlaboratory difference between retention index measurements, 17 compounds were chromatographed by both laboratories: the mean difference was +/- 13 retention index units with only one greater than +/- 50 retention index units. Examples of how these materials may be encountered during toxicological analyses are given. Data are also presented on compounds which have been used as internal standards.", 
    "12": "SQ 20009, a new anxiolytic drug structurally unrelated to GABA or benzodiazepines, has two modulatory effects on the binding of 3H-flunitrazepam to membranes from rat cerebellum. Thus, SQ 20009 has a direct and chloride ion dependent stimulatory effect on benzodiazepine receptor binding which in turn appears to be modulated by the associated GABA receptor. In addition SQ 20009 has indirect effects on benzodiazepine receptor binding since it enhances the potency of GABA and muscimol to stimulate 3H-flunitrazepam binding.", 
    "13": "SQ 20009 and SQ 65396, two new pyrazolopyridines with anxiolytic properties in animals, reversibly increased Na+-independent 3H-GABA binding to rat cerabral cortex membranes in vitro. This modulation was partially chloride dependent and sensitive to Triton-X 100. Kinetic analysis of 3H-muscimol binding revealed an increase of the apparent number of binding sites. The results are compatible with a functional association between Na+-independent GABA binding sites and the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "14": "Valium anaesthesia significantly reduces the effect of large single doses of X-rays on the mouse foot skin as compared with Nembutal anaesthesia. The radioprotective action of Valium may be attributed to a direct effect on the cells of the skin.", 
    "15": "Behavioural effects following bilateral intranigral administration of GABA antagonists have been investigated. Bicuculline methiodide (BMI), picrotoxin and isopropylbicyclophosphate all induced biting behaviour, teeth-chattering and chewing. Sub-threshold doses for biting induced locomotor activity and sniffing. The strongest response was observed after injection into the caudal pars reticulata, whereas weaker effects were seen after injection into the rostral pars reticulata or the pars compacta. The biting induced by intranigral BMI was not antagonized by prior catecholamine depletion with reserpine plus alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine or by dopamine receptor blockade with haloperido. Concomitant intranigral injection of the GABA agonists muscimol and THIP, however, completely antagonized biting. Systemic GABAergic drugs also antagonized the BMI-induced biting: the benzodiazepine, diazepam and the GABA transaminase inhibitor, gamma-acetylenic GABE, were most effective, whereas muscimol was only partially effective and THIP was without effect. It is suggested that this animal model may be used for the evaluation of antidyskinetic drugs.", 
    "16": "Two groups of medically comparable patients at the Pelgrim Centre were used to study the use of tiapridal in alcoholic detoxication. The first group of nearly 450 patients were treated with traditional medication between 1973 and mid-1976, and second group of some 540 subjects displaying somato-dependency were treated with tiapridal between mid-1976 and mid-1979. 40 % of the latter group required IM injections, but 4 tablets per day were sufficient for the remainder, with Nootropil and benzodiazepine soporifics where necessary ; medication was discontinued when symptoms disappeared (after 1 week in 40 % of the cases). Tiapridal was found to be especially useful for the 9.9 % who had a history of delirium tremens, and for sub-acute alcoholic delirium, the average stay due to this being reduced from 4 to 3 days and the incidence decrease from 7,8 to 1,4 %. There was also a great reduction in gastro-intestinal disorders and general physical craving. However, it was found that tiapridal increased the incidence of all forms of epilepsy by alcohol deprivation from 3.18 to 4.19, and detoxication epilepsy increased from 0.58 to 1.47, therefore anti-epileptic medication is indicated in many cases. On the whole, general recovery was smoother and quicker and tiapridal was highly satisfactory.", 
    "17": "Chlordiazepoxide, 5 mg/kg, given at various stages of training invariably facilitated the shuttle box avoidance of CD-1 mice for a short period of time (100 trials); no after-effects were observed on the following daily session. Amphetamine, 1 mg/kg, usually did not facilitate significantly the responding, but its combination with chlordiazepoxide produced a stronger and more pronounced effect than that of chlordiazepoxide alone. In prolonged (600-trial) sessions the performance of mice declined in the second half of the session; this decline was temporarily reversed by chlordiazepoxide given alone or with amphetamine after the first 300 trials. The results indicate that the facilitation of shuttle-box avoidance behavior by chlordiazepoxide or chlordiazepoxide-amphetamine combination is due to the improvement of performance.", 
    "18": "In a double-blind trial in depressed outpatients, 80 subjects received either mianserin 30--80 mg daily or diazepam 15--40 mg daily, for 4 weeks. Most patients received 50--60 mg mianserin, or 25--30 mg diazepam, daily after the first week. Mianserin was significantly superior to diazepam in antidepressant efficacy from day 14 to the end of the trial, as measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Beck Self-Rating Scale, and at day 28 as measured by the Clinical Global Impression. All three measures showed that the mianserin group started the trial with a significantly more severe degree of illness than the diazepam group, but this difference was already reversed by day 14. Side-effects were more frequent with mianserin treatment.", 
    "19": "Dose-responses to diazepam were studied in guinea pigs at the recompression pressures used for the treatment of gas embolism and decompression sickness. The conditions and the doses were randomly assigned. Sufficient exposure to 6 ATA air, 3 ATA oxygen, or 1 ATA air was allowed in the hyperbaric chamber before diazepam was administered intravenously. Loss of righting reflex and its return were the end points for sleep and awakening, respectively. The data were analyzed with a mathematical model for dose-response and duration of effect. Results were: (1) in 1 ATA air, widely varying doses induced sleep of long duration; (2) in 6 ATA air, sleep was induced with small doses; and (3) in 3 ATA oxygen, sleep was induced with large doses. The duration of sleep under hyperbaric conditions was shorter than at sea level pressure. The null hypothesis, which assumed similar dose-responses and durations of sleep under these three conditions, was rejected. The dose and duration of diazepam's effect during recompression apparently depend on the pressure and the gas composition used.", 
    "20": "Use of physiological data displayed on Intensive Care Unit (ICU) monitors can be a valuable adjunct for the consulting psychiatrist interviewing a resistant post ingestion patient. Directing the patient's awareness to his own physiological responses at moments of repressed affect can aid in penetrating dense denial of depression and lead to better empathic contact between interviewer and patient. The equipment is unintrusive because it is part of the ICU environment, attached as standard procedure for management of such patients.", 
    "21": "In ten health volunteers general anaesthesia was induced with etomidate (0.3 mg per kg body weight) and continued with NWO/O2 inhalation. Together with etomidate, suxamethonium (1.5 mg per kg body weight) was given simultaneously and the same dose reinjected as soon as the original muscle tone had returned completely. At equal intervals after the first and second injection the pseudocholinesterase was spectrophotometrically measured. No significant alteration of the enzyme activity was detectable at any time. Etomidate therefore does not inhibit the pseudocholinesterase. The two phases of relaxation were registered with the \"finger-twitch\" method and their duration compared. Etomidate did not prolong the time of relaxation after suxamethonium.", 
    "22": "Using light and electron microscopy and a fluorescent tracer technique, the authors have studied various aspects of injection injuries to nerves in an attempt to elucidate the pathophysiology of this condition and to help establish a rational basis for treatment. In 72 animals 144 nerve injections were carried out, using five drugs in current use and commonly administered by intramuscular injection. The nerves were examined at varying times (10 minutes to 10 weeks) following injection. Pathological alterations in the nerve were evident as early as 30 minutes after injection. The mechanism of injury appears to be a direct neurotoxic effect on the nerve fibre-both axon and Schwann cell-with a breakdown in the blood-nerve barrier.", 
    "23": "Results are presented describing serum caffeine half-lives for three healthy subjects and two patients having alcoholic hepatic disease. The mean serum caffeine half-life for the healthy subjects was 5.7 hours. One patient, a 35-year-old man who had alcoholic hepatic disease, had a serum half-life of 60 hours. The other patient, a 49-year-old woman having alcoholic hepatic disease had a serum half-life of 168 hours. The prolonged serum half-lives for the two patients are explained on the basis of compromised liver function. The serum half-life of caffeine was determined for the three healthy subjects when 25 mg diazepam was given one hour prior to the caffeine load. A significant difference was not found between the serum half-lives measured after diazepam was given and the serum half-life measured when diazepam was not given.", 
    "24": "The subjects were 24 healthy males, 19 to 21 yr old. Twelve subjects had high neuroticism (HN) levels determined by Maudsley Personality Inventory, and 12 had low neuroticism (LN) levels. Subjects took a single 5-mg dose of diazepam (DZP) after a standardized breakfast. The mean plasma concentration for DZP was significantly higher in HN subjects at 1.5 hr after drug than in LN subjects. No difference was found in the DZP plasma levels of these 2 groups after administering the drug directly into the duodenum through a tube. No clear relationship between plasma DZP concentrations and DZP-induced sedative effects determined by Choice Reaction Time Test (CRTT) was demonstrated in the study. The results suggest that the absorption rate of DZP from the gastrointestinal tract is faster in HN subjects than in LN subjects due to the faster gastric emptying time in HN subjects in our experimental situation, which might have induced mild stress.", 
    "25": "Factors influencing diazepam kinetics were assessed in 4 equal groups (n = 11) of young male and female (aged 21 to 37 yr) and elderly male and female (aged 61 to 84 yr) subjects, all of whom were healthy. In all 44, plasma diazepam concentrations were determined by electron-capture gas-liquid chromatography in multiple samples drawn for as long as 9 days after a single 5- to 10-mg intravenous dose. Based upon total (bound + free) diazepam concentrations, volume of distribution (Vd) ranged from 0.7 to 4.7 l/kg, and became larger both with increasing age and with female sex. Clearances of total (bound + free) diazepam in young and elderly females were nearly identical (0.51 and 0.48 ml/min/kg), but clearance was higher in young than elderly males (0.39 and 0.24 ml/min/kg, p less than 0.01). The unbound fraction of diazepam in plasma (range, 0.9% to 2.7%) did not depend on sex, but was greater in the elderly than in the young. In part this related to lower plasma albumin concentrations in the elderly. After correction of kinetic data for individual differences in free fraction, Vd was larger in the females than in the males, but the effect of age was small. Clearance of unbound diazepam (intrinsic clearance) tended to be higher in the females than in the males of both age groups, and was higher in the young than in the elderly of both sexes (male: 29.9 and 14.9 ml/min/kg, p less than 0.005; female: 43.6 and 28.0 ml/min/kg, p less than 0.05). Smoking was associated with higher clearance values, particularly among young subjects.", 
    "26": "We report a case of stiff-man syndrome with abnormal spinal fluid. Serum protein values were normal, but the spinal fluid levels of immunogammaglobulin G and acute-phase proteins were elevated. We discuss the possibility of an inflammatory process of the nervous system as a cause for these findings. Another interesting observation in our patient was that of local atrophies seen on computerized tomography, indicating hemispheral and especially brainstem lesions. Furthermore, as a new therapeutic possibility, we demonstrated the improvement of spasms and rigidity under the influence of heat.", 
    "27": "Children with problem \"wetting\" often are suspected of manifesting developmental or behavioral disorders. Thirty-one children who had previously been evaluated and found to have a normal urinalysis, IVP and VCU were reexamined because of persistent voiding dysfunctions. The subjects revealed a physiologic rather than a psychological basis for their urologic disorder. Various aspects of bladder training are discussed.", 
    "28": "Maternal diazepam medication during labor reduces beat-to-beat variability of the fetal heart rate. In this study, the prolongation of the effect was examined in the newborn. The mother received diazepam: (A) during labor as a tranquilizer, (B) daily in low doses at the end of pregnancy, or (C) in high doses i.v. for (pre-)eclampsia. A control group had no analgesic or sedative during pregnancy or labor. The electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded daily from each newborn during the first 6 days after birth. After preprocessing of the ECG, the median R-R interval, the long-term irregularity index (LTI index) and the interval difference index (ID index) were calculated. A cubic spline interpolation method was applied to compare the various groups with respect to these heart rate parameters. The median R-R interval showed no particular differences in trend for all groups. The LTI index was decreased in the first days after birth in the chronic diazepam (B), and in the diazepam infusion groups (C), but statistical significance was not reached. The ID index was significantly decreased in the first 1-2 days in the newborns of the acute and chronic diazepam group. In the diazepam infusion group, an even longer lasting effect was observed. Maternal diazepam medication affects the beat-to-beat variability in the newborn. The duration of the effect is dependent on dosage and route of administration.", 
    "29": "The actions of diazepam and droperidol were studied on the spontaneously active and oxytocin-treated oestrus rat uterus. Both drugs significantly depressed the frequency of uterine contraction. Droperidol reduced the amplitude of contractions and the basal tone of the tissue. The sensitivity of the tissue to both drugs was enhanced in the presence of the smallest concentration of oxytocin (0.2 mu. ml-1). Prior exposure of the tissue to droperidol sensitized the muscle to oxytocin.", 
    "30": "We have studied the influence of intravenously administered diazepam on the activity of single secondary vestibular neurons in unanesthetized, paralyzed rabbits evoked by sinusoidal angular accelerations about the vertical and longitudinal axes. Intravenous injections of diazepam (20-100 micrograms/kg) caused a decreased sensitivity of all secondary vestibular neurons which were tested. The reduction in sensitivity was sometimes preceded by a transient increase in excitability which lasted 10-40 sec. The duration of the decreased sensitivity to vestibular stimulation following intravenous injections of diazepam was dose-dependent, lasting 15-60 min. These data suggest that the diazepam-induced reduction of vestibuloocular reflexes is caused, at least in part, by the depressant action of diazepam upon secondary vestibular neurons.", 
    "31": "Acute intravenous injection of diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) in rats resulted in a moderate (2-fold) increase in pain threshold, as measured by the 'vocalization test'. This effect was not antagonized by naloxone (10 mg/kg, i.p.). However, pretreatment of the animals with the enzyme-inhibitor, bacitracin (50 micrograms, i.c.v.), dramatically enhanced the diazepam-induced antinociception. This increased effect was partially antagonized by naloxone, indicating an opioid-mediated mechanism as involved and further supports the hypothesis that benzodiazepine application may release opioid peptides in restricted areas of the CNS.", 
    "32": "The hemodynamics during induction of anesthesia were studied in ten patients with ischemic heart disease about to have coronary artery bypass grafting. Intravenous diazepam, 0.5 mg/kg (with 50% N2O in oxygen inspired and pancuronium IV), was used to induce anesthesia. Compared to awake baseline, induction caused statistically significant decreases in the mean arterial pressure, rate pressure product, stroke index, and left and right ventricular stroke work indexed. Although statistically significant, the hemodynamic changes were small and transient and required no modifying treatment. This anesthetic induction technic is safe, efficient, and well tolerated by patients having myocardial revascularization surgery.", 
    "33": "Effec of an i.p. injection of diazepam on the jaw opening reflex evoked by electrical stimuli applied to the tooth pulp innervated by mainly high threshold afferents and the lower lip innervated by low threshold afferents was investigated using Wistar albino rats. Small doses of diazepam, less than 2.5 mg/kg, suppressed to the same degree the jaw opening reflexes evoked by stimulation of tooth pulp or lower lip. However, when larger doses thab 5.0 mg/kg were administered, the suppression of tooth pulp-evoked jaw opening reflex was greater than that of lower lip-evoked one. In this case, the period of suppression of tooth pulp-evoked jaw opening reflex was longer than that of lower lip-evoked one. It is concluded that (1) the pain relieving effect of diazepam appears only when larger doses tha 5.0 mg/kg are administered and that (2) the pain-relieving effect lasts longer than muscle-relaxative effect of diazepam.", 
    "34": "The clinical effects of pentobarbital, 100 mg, and diazepam, 10 mg, given orally as preoperative medications before dental surgery were tested in a double-blind study in 50 adult patients. The concnetrations of pentobarbital and diazepam (plus its three active metabolites) in plasma, measured by gas chromatography, were correlated with their clinical effects as assessed both subjectively and objectively (sedation, apprehension, excitement, dizziness, pre- and post-operative emetic effect, increase or decrease in systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and ease of venipuncture). No significant difference in the effects of these two agents was observed, nor was there any obvious relationship between the concentration in plasma and clinical effect.", 
    "35": "1 The characteristics and mechanism of fluctuations in diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam concentrations and diazepam free fraction were studied in six volunteers, who received diazepam (10 mg, i.v. over 20 min) and in five chronic diazepam users. 2 Within a day total diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam concentrations varied significantly (P less than 0.001) and were lower than predicted between 23.00 and 08.00 h and higher by 09.00 h. In contrast, diazepam free fraction also varied significantly (P less than 0.001) and was highest between 23.00 and 08.00 h and lower by 09.00 h. Coincident increases in total diazepam concentrations (P less than 0.005) and decreases in diazepam free fraction were associated with food intake (P less than 0.05). 3 The coincident diurnal variations in diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam concentrations and the negative correlation between total diazepam concentration and diazepam free fraction (r = 0.73, P less than 0.001) suggest that the mechanism of the fluctuations is intravascular and tissue redistribution rather than effect on drug biotransformation. 4 These variations may introduce large between and within investigator experimental differences in the determination of kinetic parameters. Free drug concentration varies over the day, and within day variations in clinical effect may be observed.", 
    "36": "Nonketotic hyperglycinemia was diagnosed in identical twins with lethargy and respiratory failure in the neonatal period. Therapy with strychnine (0.32 mg/kg/day) resulted in great reductions in CSF and plasma glycine levels and improvement in muscle tone, respiration, and ability to suck. Myoclonic seizures were partially controlled by therapy with clonazepam. Higher dosages of strychnine (up to 2.0 mg/kg/day) were needed to counteract the increased lethargy following administration of clonazepam. At 5 months of age, the twins' developmental performance remained below the 1-month level despite adequate somatic growth. The twins died suddenly of status epilepticus at 6 1/2 months of age.", 
    "37": "A study was made of the effect of haloperidol on convulsions induced in mice by bicuculline and thiosemicarbazide and on the recovery cycles of the primary response in the rat sensorimotor cortex. In doses of 0.3--0.5 mg/kg producing a tranquilizing effect, haloperidol exerts a protective action in convulsions induced by bicuculline blocking of the GABA receptors and enhances the depression of the testing response during recovery cycle of the rat sensorimotor cortex primary response. It means that over this dosage range haloperidol potentiates GABA-induced effects. An increase in the neuroleptic dose up to 1--2 mg/kg entails disappearance of the efficacy shown by both the tests. The authors' own and reported data suggest an important role played by the postsynaptic GABA-positive effect in realization of the tranquilizing action of haloperidol and other neurotropic agents.", 
    "38": "A method to prepare isolated hepatocytes from the small amounts of liver or liver fragments obtained from the human fetus following therapeutic abortion in early pregnancy is described. The hepatocytes have been characterized by electron microscopy and by their ability to dealkylate the benzodiazepine drug prazepam. The preparation of hepatocytes from a liver sample obtained from a kidney transplant donor is described and discussed.", 
    "39": "The distribution pattern of 14C-phenazepam and some of its metabolites in the liver, brain and blood plasma at a prolonged (45 days) administration to rats does not differ from that after a single administration. The liver and brain demonstrated an increase in the content of 3-hydroxyderivative. Glycuronide was found only in the liver.", 
    "40": "A potentially acceptable and uncomplicated technique of total intravenous anaesthesia is described using flunitrazepam for induction, and maintenance by ketamine infusion with neuromuscular blockade and controlled ventilation using oxygen-enriched room air. A significant complication was the 23% incidence of nausea and/or vomiting encountered in the fifty-six patients studied. Definite factual recall of the surgical experience was reported by one patient. This was attributable to an accidental error in technique. Postoperative drowsiness was also a feature of the technique. The usual cardiovascular and psychomimetic effects associated with ketamine administration appeared markedly attenuated by flunitrazepam induction. Fifty-three (96.3%) patients expressed their willingness to receive the same anaesthetic again. Further experience of total intravenous anaesthesia with the introduction of cerebral function monitoring, allowing correlation of depth of anaesthesia with drug dosage, should allow further refinement of the technique to ensure successful and acceptable anaesthesia.", 
    "41": "In albino rats, after cessation of the 24-hr REM sleep deprivation, the SH-group content usually increased by that moment in brain-stem homogenates, dropped to its wakefulness level within 36 hr. Intraperitoneal injection of Phenazepam immediately after cessation of the REM sleep deprivation accelerated normalization of the SH-group content reducing the period to 12 hr. Phenazepam injection (0.5 mg/kg) before and in 12 hr after the REM sleep deprivation completely prevented the increase in the brain-stem SH-group content. Lower doses or a single injection before the REM sleep deprivation only decreased somewhat the SH-group accumulation.", 
    "42": "Flunitrazepam, a potent benzodiazepine, reversibly binds to the benzodiazepine receptor with high affinity. When irradiated with UV light, flunitrazepam was irreversibly linked to brain tissue. Incorporation of [3H]flunitrazepam was inhibited by other benzodiazepines with a potency corresponding to their affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor. Photolabeling with flunitrazepam reduced the number of benzodiazepine receptors determined by reversible binding of benzodiazepines, whereas the apparent affinity of the remaining receptors was unchanged. Half-maximal incorporation of flunitrazepam occurred at a concentration similar to the apparent dissociation constant of flunitrazepam. Thus, flunitrazepam appears to be a photoaffinity label for the benzodiazepine receptor. The receptor component photolabeled with flunitrazepam was a protein of molecular weight 50,000. Its location in cerebral and cerebellar cortex slices could be visualized by electron microscopic autoradiography. A predominant localization of benzodiazepine receptors in regions of synaptic constants, including those formed by GABAergic neurons (GABA is gamma-aminobutyric acid), was observed.", 
    "43": "The effects of a single 384 mg oral dose of chlormethiazole were compared with those of 20 mg of temazepam and placebo in healthy old and young women (mean ages 72.9 and 24.7 years respectively). Both drugs were effective hypnotics and had no detectable pharmacological action the next morning. Even four hours after administration performance of a simple psychomotor test was not impaired and sway (measured by an ataxiameter) was not increased in either age group. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that chlormethiazole was rapidly absorbed, distributed, and eliminated by both groups, so that minimal plasma concentrations existed 11 hours after administration. Temazepam, however, was less quickly absorbed and distributed, especially in the young group, and substantial amounts remained in the plasma 11 hours after administration. No unwanted effects occurred after temazepam, but 17 of the 20 subjects suffered from nasal irritation after taking chlormethiazole. Thus hangover effects may be avoided in elderly subjects after they have taken hypnotic drugs, and temazepam and chlormethiazole allow sleep to be interrupted safely.", 
    "44": "Triclofos 70 mg kg-1, diazepam 0.25 mg kg-1 and flunitrazepam 0.02 mg kg-1 all in combination with atropine 0.03 mg kg-1 were compared as oral premedicants in 128 children undergoing otolaryngological surgery in a double-blind study. All drugs provided good anxiolysis in children 5 yr and older. In children less than 5 yr, the effects of triclofos were superior to those of diazepam and flunitrazepam. There was a positive correlation between anxiolysis and the ease of induction of anaesthesia. In both age groups, flunitrazepam prevented the fasciculations caused by suxamethonium more effectively than did diazepam or triclofos. The preinduction heart rate after triclofos was greater than after the other drugs and its antisialagogue effect was superior. The mean volume of gastric contents was 0.4 ml kg-1 for all the patients with no statistically significant difference between the groups. The mean pH of gastric contents was 4.5 after triclofos and 2.2 after other drugs. The serum concentration of both benzodiazepines in the older age group was greater than in the younger age group.", 
    "45": "Lorazepam is a new member of a constantly growing benzodiazepine family. It has been demonstrated to be an effective anxiolytic agent, but as with use of other drugs of this nature, tolerance and dependence may occur. These unwanted effects can constitute a serious clinical problem. We report on two patients with grand mal seizures, which were thought to be secondary to abrupt withdrawal of lorazepam. Because these types of agents are the most widely used drugs in medical practice, their potential risks must be emphasized.", 
    "46": "The present review of psychomotor response to psychotropic substances is restricted to normal subjects and describes responses to the initial standard dose of psychotropic substances in common use. Only placebo-controlled studies which permitted statistical analysis of treatment group differences were considered for the summary. It was revealed that virtually all psychotropic substances have immediate detracting effects. The nature of the effects varied somewhat according to the class of drug. It is suggested that this kind of information has safety implications which could influence the choice of medication."
