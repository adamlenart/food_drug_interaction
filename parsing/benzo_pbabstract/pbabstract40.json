    "1": "indicate that WIN administered intraperitoneally, at doses of 2.5 and 5 mg/kg significantly enhanced the anticonvulsant action of CLB in the MES test by reducing its median effective dose (ED50) from 20.80 mg/kg to 12.05 mg/kg (P<0.05), and 8.22 mg/kg (P<0.001), respectively. In contrast, WIN (1.25 mg/kg) did not significantly potentiate the anticonvulsant activity of CLB against MES-induced seizures. Similarly, WIN at doses of 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg had no significant impact on the anticonvulsant action of LCM in the MES test. On the other hand, WIN (5 mg/kg) had no impact on the acute neurotoxic effects of CLB and LCM in the chimney test and the median toxic doses (TD50) for CLB and LCM were almost unchanged. Thus, WIN (5 mg/kg) elevated the protective index values for CLB (from 1.41 to 3.07) and LCM (from 3.60 to 4.91). In conclusion, WIN potentiates suppression of tonic-clonic seizures produced by CLB in the mouse MES model, without affecting acute neurotoxic adverse effects of CLB in the chimney test in mice, which is favorable from a preclinical point of view.", 
    "2": "Ethanol is commonly used as a solvent in injectable formulations of poorly water-soluble drugs. The concentrations of ethanol in such formulations are generally considered reasonably safe. It is long known that ethanol can potentiate central effects of sedatives and tranquillizers, particularly the benzodiazepines, most likely as a result of a synergistic interaction at the GABAA receptor. However, whether this occurs at the low systemic doses of ethanol resulting from its use as solvent in parenteral formulations of benzodiazepines is not known. In the present study we evaluated whether a commercial ethanol-containing aqueous solution of diazepam exerts more potent anti-seizure effects than an aqueous solution of diazepam hydrochloride or an aqueous emulsion of this drug in the intrahippocampal kainate model of temporal lobe epilepsy in mice. Spontaneous epileptic seizures in this model are known to be resistant to major antiepileptic drugs. Administration of the ethanol-containing formulation of diazepam caused an almost complete suppression of seizures. This was not seen when the same dose (5 mg/kg) of diazepam was administered as aqueous solution or emulsion, although all three diazepam formulations resulted in similar drug and metabolite concentrations in plasma. Our data demonstrate that ethanol-containing solutions of diazepam are superior to block difficult-to-treat seizures to other formulations of diazepam. To our knowledge, this has not been demonstrated before and, if this finding can be translated to humans, may have important consequences for emergency treatment of acute seizures, series of seizures, and initial treatment of status epilepticus in patients.",

In particular, GABAergic interneurons play a crucial role for synchronizing neural populations. Do these mechanistic principles apply to human oscillations associated with function? To address this, we recorded ongoing brain activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in healthy human subjects participating in a double-blind pharmacological study receiving placebo, 0.5 mg and 1.5 mg of lorazepam (LZP; a benzodiazepine upregulating GABAergic conductance). Participants performed a demanding visuospatial working memory (WM) task.",

Importantly, the frequency of the gamma activity decreased with dosage, as predicted by models derived from the rat hippocampus. A regionally specific gamma increase correlated with the drug-related performance decrease. Despite the system-wide pharmacological intervention, gamma power drug modulations were specific to visual cortex: sensorimotor gamma power and frequency during button presses remained unaffected. In contrast, occipital alpha power modulations during the delay interval decreased parametrically with drug dosage, predicting performance impairment. Consistent with alpha oscillations reflecting functional inhibition, LZP affected alpha power strongly in early visual regions not required for the task demonstrating a regional specific occipital impairment.",

Objective of our study was to investigate prevalence of psychotropic drug use one year after diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease (AD), to compare prevalence to persons without AD and to assess changes in prevalence over time. Data from the MEDALZ (Medication use and Alzheimer's disease) cohort was utilized in the study including all 69,080 community-dwelling persons with new diagnosis of AD during years 2005-2011 in Finland. Four age-, gender- and region of residence-matched persons without AD were identified for each case. Register-based data included prescription drug purchases and comorbidities from Special Reimbursement Register. Annual prevalence of psychotropic drug use one year after diagnosis was determined for each person. Psychotropic drugs were used by 53% of persons with AD compared with 33% of persons without AD during one year after diagnoses. Persons with AD were six times more likely to use antipsychotics and three times more likely to use antidepressants whereas benzodiazepine and related drug (BZDR) use was comparable between persons with and without AD. According to year of AD diagnoses during 2005-2011, antipsychotic use increased from 18% to 20% (p<0.0001) and BZDR use declined from 31% to 26% (p<0.0001) among persons with AD.

We conducted parallel studies in human subjects and nonhuman primates to investigate the differential effects of tobacco smoking and nicotine on changes in GABAA receptor availability during acute and prolonged alcohol withdrawal. We report that alcohol withdrawal with or without concurrent tobacco smoking/nicotine consumption resulted in significant and robust elevations in GABAA receptor levels over the first week of withdrawal. Over prolonged withdrawal, GABAA receptors returned to control levels in alcohol-dependent nonsmokers, but alcohol-dependent smokers had significant and sustained elevations in GABAA receptors that were associated with craving for alcohol and cigarettes. In nonhuman primates, GABAA receptor levels normalized by 1 mo of abstinence in both groups--that is, those that consumed alcohol alone or the combination of alcohol and nicotine. These data suggest that constituents in tobacco smoke other than nicotine block the recovery of GABAA receptor systems during sustained alcohol abstinence, contributing to alcohol relapse and the perpetuation of smoking.",

Compared to the wealth of data on the impairment of the dopamine system, relatively limited evidence is available concerning the role of major non-dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems in PD. Therefore, we comprehensively investigated the density and distribution of neurotransmitter receptors for glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine, adrenaline, serotonin, dopamine and adenosine in brains of homozygous aphakia mice being characterized by mutations affecting the Pitx3 gene. This genetic model exhibits crucial hallmarks of PD on the neuropathological, symptomatic and pharmacological level. Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to characterize 19 different receptor binding sites in eleven brain regions in order to understand receptor changes on a systemic level. We demonstrated striking differential changes of neurotransmitter receptor densities for numerous receptor types and brain regions, respectively. Most prominent, a strong up-regulation of GABA receptors and associated benzodiazepine binding sites in different brain regions and concomitant down-regulations of striatal nicotinic acetylcholine and serotonergic receptor densities were found. Furthermore, the densities of glutamatergic kainate, muscarinic acetylcholine, adrenergic \u03b11 and dopaminergic D2/D3 receptors were differentially altered. These results present novel insights into the expression of neurotransmitter receptors in Pitx3(ak) mice supporting findings on PD pathology in patients and indicating on the possible underlying mechanisms. The data suggest Pitx3(ak) mice as an appropriate new model to investigate the role of neurotransmitter receptors in PD. Our study highlights the relevance of non-dopaminergic systems in PD and for the understanding of its molecular pathology.", 
    "47": "Flanking lateral masks enhance or weaken the detection of a low-contrast visual target. This effect depends on the target-to-mask distance. An improvement of stimulus detection can also be observed when participants imagine (i.e., retrieve from memory) the previously presented masks. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we show that the gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptor agonist alprazolam disrupts perceptual but not imagery enhancement of contrast detection in individuals with generalized anxiety and adjustment disorder. The weakened target detection at short target-to-mask distances became more pronounced after the administration of the GABA-agonist in both perception and imagery conditions. Healthy control participants did not differ from individuals with generalized anxiety and adjustment disorder receiving placebo. These results indicate that perception and imagery can be dissociated by boosting GABA-ergic neurotransmission. Further studies are warranted to investigate this effect in healthy individuals.", 
    "48": "JM-1232(-) (JM) is a novel isoindoline derivative with sedative and hypnotic activities that are mediated by binding to the benzodiazepine site of the Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor. Although the neuroprotective effects of other GABAA receptor agonists are well known, there is no published report regarding JM. Thus, we examined the effects of JM on neurons exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) using rat hippocampal slice cultures. Hippocampal slices were assigned to either control or JM-administered groups. To assess the neuroprotective effects of JM from necrotic changes, we measured the fluorescence of propidium iodide and compared the cell mortality 24h following OGD between the control and JM-administered groups. We also verified that the effects of JM were mediated by GABAA receptors by adding flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, in the same experimental settings. JM, at concentrations of 250 and 500 \u00b5M, significantly reduced cell mortality in pyramidal neurons after OGD; however, flumazenil did not inhibit this effect. To analyze more immediate effects of JM, we next measured the fluorescence of Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1 during the OGD and re-oxygenation periods, and evaluated changes in intracellular Ca(2+) in single CA1 pyramidal neurons. JM reduced the elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration during OGD, and this effect was antagonized by flumazenil. These findings indicate that JM suppressed the elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration during OGD through GABAA receptors, but its neuroprotective effects from necrotic changes also involve other unknown mechanisms.", 
    "49": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections in young children and other high-risk populations. RSV nucleoprotein (N) is essential for virus assembly and replication as part of the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. RSV604 was a putative N inhibitor in phase 2 clinical trials whose molecular mechanism of action (MoA) was not well understood. This study investigated the cell line-dependent potency of RSV604 and demonstrated its direct binding to the N protein in vitro, providing the first evidence of direct target engagement for this class of inhibitors reported to date. The affinity of RSV604 N binding was not affected by RSV604 resistance mutations in the N protein. RSV604 engaged in two different MoAs in HeLa cells, inhibiting both RSV RNA synthesis and the infectivity of released virus. The lack of inhibition of viral RNA synthesis in some cell lines explained the cell-type-dependent potency of the inhibitor. RSV604 did not inhibit viral RNA synthesis in the RSV subgenomic replicon cells or in the cell-free RNP assay, suggesting that it might act prior to viral replication complex formation. RSV604 did not alter N protein localization in the infected cells. Taken together, these results provide new insights leading to an understanding of the MoAs of RSV604 and other similar N inhibitors.", 
    "50": "The hepatic cytochrome P450 reductase null (HRN) mouse, which has no functional hepatic Cyp P450s, may represent a useful model for examining extra-hepatic P450-related oxidative metabolism. Here the pharmacokinetics and metabolic fate of midazolam, a drug known to undergo such extra-hepatic metabolism, have been investigated in the HRN mouse and compared with a phenotypically normal strain (C57BL/6J). In addition, the effects of co-administration of the pan-P450 inhibitor 1'-aminobenzotriazole (ABT) on the metabolic profile have been compared in both strains. Significant pharmacokinetic differences for midazolam were observed between the two strains of mice with the HRN mice showing lower circulating concentrations of 1'-hydroxymidazolam but higher concentrations of 1'-hydroxymidazolam-O-glucuronide. A significant increase in midazolam exposure was seen upon ABT exposure for both strains of mice, but no differences in the area under the concentration time curves (AUC) for the monitored metabolites were observed. Although oxidative metabolism of midazolam was not abolished, significant decreases in 1'-hydroxymidazolam formation ratios were observed for both strains of mice exposed to ABT. Metabolite profiling of blood and bile showed a number of qualitative and quantitative differences between HRN and normal mice. These differences in midazolam metabolism between the two strains of mice clearly demonstrate the role that liver P450 enzymes play in the murine metabolism of midazolam. The fate of the compound in the HRN mice shows the importance of extrahepatic metabolism and also showed that these mice appear to be more capable of forming circulating phase II glucuronides than the normal strain.", 
    "51": "Hair specimen is necessary to complement blood and/or urine analyses as it permits differentiation of a single exposure from chronic use of a drug by segmentation of the hair for a stated growth period. Moreover, due to a frequent long delay between event and police declaration, hair can be the only solution for lack of corroborative evidence of a committed crime. With the exception of lower amount of biological material in children versus adults, there is no specific analytical problem when processing samples from children. The issue is the interpretation of the findings, with respect to the different pharmacological parameters. In some very young children, the interpretation can be complicated by potential in utero exposure. Twenty-four cases from daily practice have been reviewed. Children were less than 1 year old, hair was always longer than 4 cm and the corresponding mothers admitted having used drugs during pregnancy. Drugs involved include methadone, tramadol, diphenhydramine, diazepam, cannabis, heroin, amitriptyline and bromazepam. Analyses were achieved by hyphenated chromatographic validated procedures after hair decontamination and segmentation. The concentrations measured in the hair of children were lower than those observed in subjects using therapeutically (or illegally) these drugs. In that sense, the frequency of exposures appears as un-frequent (low level of exposure), with marked decrease in the more recent period. However, the parents denied any administration in all cases and there was no reason to suspect re-exposure after delivery and no clinical problem during the period between delivery and hair collection during regular visits to the physician was noticed. The pattern of drug distribution was similar in all these cases, low concentrations in the proximal segments and highest concentration in the distal segment (last segment). When considering the concentration in the distal segment as the 100% of the response (highest concentration), after analysis of 4 segments (irrespective of the length of the segment but longer than 1cm), it was observed the following pattern: proximal segment, 5-35% of the response; segment 2, 15-50% of the response; segment 3, 25-60% of the response; and distal segment, 100% of the response. It is proposed to consider 100% in utero contribution to the final interpretation when the ratio concentration of the proximal segment to the concentration of the distal segment is lower than 0.5. This can be applied only when the child is under 1 year old and the hair shaft length is at least 4 cm (to achieve suitable segmentation). It is important, when using this cut-off to have at least 3 or 4 segments to be able to observe the variation in drug concentrations, whatever the length of each segment (>1cm).", 
    "52": "Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R) signaling has been shown to have antipsychotic properties in animal models and to impact glucose-dependent insulin release, satiety, memory, and learning in man. Previous work has shown that two coding mutations (rs6923761 and rs1042044) are associated with altered insulin release and cortisol levels. We identified four frequently occurring haplotypes in Caucasians, haplotype 1 through haplotype 4, spanning exons 4-7 and containing the two coding variants. We analyzed response to antipsychotics, defined as predicted change in PANSS-Total (dPANSS) at 18 months, in Caucasian subjects from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trial of Intervention Effectiveness treated with olanzapine (n=139), perphenazine (n=78), quetiapine (n=14), risperidone (n=143), and ziprasidone (n=90). Haplotype trend regression analysis revealed significant associations with dPANSS for olanzapine (best p=0.002), perphenazine (best p=0.01), quetiapine (best p=0.008), risperidone (best p=0.02), and ziprasidone (best p=0.007). We also evaluated genetic models for the two most common haplotypes. Haplotype 1 (uniquely including the rs1042044 [Leu(260)] allele) was associated with better response to olanzapine (p=0.002), and risperidone (p=0.006), and worse response to perphenazine (p=.03), and ziprasidone (p=0.003), with a recessive genetic model providing the best fit. Haplotype 2 (uniquely including the rs6923761 [Ser(168)] allele) was associated with better response to perphenazine (p=0.001) and worse response to olanzapine (p=.02), with a dominant genetic model providing the best fit. However, GLP1R haplotypes were not associated with antipsychotic-induced weight gain. These results link functional genetic variants in GLP1R to antipsychotic response.",

    "59": "The vagal nerve and gut hormones CCK and GLP-1 play important roles in the control of food intake. However, it is not clear to what extent CCK and GLP-1 increase satiation by stimulating receptors located on abdominal vagal nerve endings or via receptors located elsewhere. This study aimed to further explore the relative contribution of the abdominal vagal nerve in mediating the satiating effects of endogenous CCK and GLP-1. Total subdiaphragmatic vagotomy or sham operation was combined with administration of CCK1 and GLP-1 receptor antagonists devazepide and exendin (9-39) in 12 pigs, applying an unbalanced Latin Square within-subject design. Furthermore, effects of vagotomy on preprandial and postprandial acetaminophen absorption, glucose, insulin, GLP-1 and CCK plasma concentrations were investigated. Ad libitum liquid meal intake (mean\u00b1SEM) was similar in sham and vagotomized pigs (4180\u00b1435 and 3760\u00b1810 g/meal). Intake increased by about 20% after blockade of CCK1 receptors, independently of the abdominal vagal nerve. Food intake did not increase after blockade of GLP-1 receptors. Blockade of CCK1 and GLP-1 receptors increased circulating CCK and GLP-1 concentrations in sham pigs only, suggesting the existence of a vagal reflex mechanism in the regulation of plasma CCK1 and GLP-1 concentrations. Vagotomy decreased acetaminophen absorption and changed glucose, insulin, CCK and GLP-1 concentrations indicating a delay in gastric emptying. Our data show that at liquid feeding, satiation is decreased effectively by pharmacological blockade of CCK1 receptors. We conclude that regulation of liquid meal intake appears to be primarily regulated by CCK1 receptors not located on abdominal vagal nerve endings.", 
    "60": "The present study investigated the anxiolytic-like effects of spinosin, one of the major flavonoids in Ziziphi Spinosae Semen (ZSS), in experimental models of anxiety compared with a known anxiolytic, diazepam. Repeated treatment with spinosin (2.5 and 5mg/kg/day, p.o.) significantly increased the percentage of entries into and time spent on the open arms of the elevated plus maze compared with the control group. In the light/dark box test, spinosin exerted an anxiolytic-like effect at 5mg/kg. In the open-field test, 5mg/kg spinosin increased the number of central entries. Spinosin did not affect spontaneous activity. The anxiolytic-like effects of spinosin in the elevated plus maze, light/dark box test, and open field test were blocked by the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptor antagonist flumazenil (3mg/kg, i.p.) and 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A (5-HT1A) receptor antagonist WAY-100635 (1mg/kg, i.p.). These results suggest that spinosin exerts anxiolytic-like effects, and its mechanism of action appears to be modulated by GABAA and 5-HT1A receptors.", 
    "61": "The potential inhibition of the major human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes by faldaprevir was evaluated both in vitro and in clinical studies (healthy volunteers and hepatitis C virus [HCV] genotype 1-infected patients). In vitro studies indicated that faldaprevir inhibited CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A, and was a weak-to-moderate inactivator of CYP3A4. Faldaprevir 240\u2009mg twice daily in healthy volunteers demonstrated moderate inhibition of hepatic and intestinal CYP3A (oral midazolam: 2.96-fold increase in AUC(0-24\u2009h)), weak inhibition of hepatic CYP3A (intravenous midazolam: 1.56-fold increase in AUC(0-24\u2009h)), weak inhibition of CYP2C9 ([S]-warfarin: 1.29-fold increase in AUC(0-120\u2009h)), and had no relevant effects on CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP2D6. Faldaprevir 120\u2009mg once daily in HCV-infected patients demonstrated weak inhibition of hepatic and intestinal CYP3A (oral midazolam: 1.52-fold increase in AUC(0-\u221e)), and had no relevant effects on CYP2C9 or CYP1A2. In vitro drug-drug interaction predictions based on inhibitor concentration ([I])/inhibition constant (Ki) ratios tended to overestimate clinical effects and a net-effect model provided a more accurate approach. These studies suggest that faldaprevir shows a dose-dependent inhibition of CYP3A and CYP2C9, and does not induce CYP isoforms.", 
    "62": "Tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (TETS) is a potent convulsant poison for which there is currently no approved antidote. The convulsant action of TETS is thought to be mediated by inhibition of type A gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAAR) function. We, therefore, investigated the effects of post-exposure administration of diazepam, a GABAAR positive allosteric modulator, on seizure activity, death and neuroinflammation in adult male Swiss mice injected with a lethal dose of TETS (0.15mg/kg, ip). Administration of a high dose of diazepam (5mg/kg, ip) immediately following the second clonic seizure (approximately 20min post-TETS injection) effectively prevented progression to tonic seizures and death. However, this treatment did not prevent persistent reactive astrogliosis and microglial activation, as determined by GFAP and Iba-1 immunoreactivity and microglial cell morphology. Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) has been shown to exert potent anti-inflammatory effects and to increase survival in mice intoxicated with other GABAAR antagonists. The sEH inhibitor TUPS (1mg/kg, ip) administered immediately after the second clonic seizure did not protect TETS-intoxicated animals from tonic seizures or death. Combined administration of diazepam (5mg/kg, ip) and TUPS (1mg/kg, ip, starting 1h after diazepam and repeated every 24h) prevented TETS-induced lethality and influenced signs of neuroinflammation in some brain regions. Significantly decreased microglial activation and enhanced reactive astrogliosis were observed in the hippocampus, with no changes in the cortex. Combining an agent that targets specific anti-inflammatory mechanisms with a traditional antiseizure drug may enhance treatment outcome in TETS intoxication.",

Different combinations of film forming agents and other excipients and different casting heights were tested for their suitability for production of ODFs. The best suitable casting solution contained hypromellose, carbomer, glycerol, disodium EDTA and trometamol. This casting solution was used to prepare ODFs containing water-soluble APIs (enalapril maleate and prednisolone disodium phosphate) and a poorly water-soluble API (diazepam) for which ethanol 96% was used as co-solvent.The water-soluble APIs as well as ethanol influenced the viscosity of the casting solution, mechanical properties and disintegration time of the ODFs. All ODFs containing API met the requirements on uniformity of mass and uniformity of content set by the European Pharmacopoeia (2014) (Ph. Eur.) 8th edition. In conclusion, ODFs of good pharmaceutical quality can be prepared on small scale. Hereby opening the perspective of using ODFs for individualized pharmacotherapy.", 
    "64": "Approximately 4% of adults who have symptoms of insomnia resort to various hypnotic or sedating medications for acute symptom relief. Although typically a common practice for nonpregnant adults, this is not the case for the thousands of pregnant women who also report substantial sleep issues. Unfortunately, a paucity of randomized controlled trials in this population, scant empiric evidence regarding the appropriateness of prescribing options, and the concern of subsequent teratogenicity restricts the ability of clinicians to make informed decisions. We synthesized the current research regarding hypnotics and sedating medications used (both on- and off-label) during pregnancy and their association with adverse outcomes. Medications that we investigated included benzodiazepines, hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists, antidepressants, and antihistamines. Overall, the examined studies showed no correlation of increased risk of congenital malformations. However, benzodiazepines and hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists may increase rates of preterm birth, low birthweight, and/or small-for-gestational-age infants. The small number of studies and the small number of subjects prohibit any definitive interpretation regarding the consequences of the use of hypnotic or sedating medications in pregnancy. Additional case reports, randomized clinical trials, and epidemiologic studies are needed urgently.",

Recently, vitexin was shown to protect the heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury in an in vitro model by inhibiting apoptosis. The purpose of this study was to find out whether vitexin influences the effect on rat cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C11, and CYP3A1) by using cocktail probe drugs in vivo; the influence on the levels of CYP mRNA was also studied. A cocktail solution at a dose of 5\u2009mL/kg, which contained phenacetin (10\u2009mg/kg), tolbutamide (1\u2009mg/kg), and midazolam (5\u2009mg/kg), was given as oral administration to rats treated with short or long period of intravenous vitexin via the caudal vein. Blood samples were collected at a series of time points, and the concentrations of probe drugs in plasma were determined by HPLC-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS. The corresponding pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by the software of DAS 2.0. In addition, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine the effects of vitexin on the mRNA expression of CYP1A2, CYP2C11, and CYP3A1 in rat liver. Treatment with short or long period of vitexin had no effects on rat CYP1A2. However, CYP3A1 enzyme activity was inhibited by vitexin in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, CYP2C11 enzyme activity was induced after short period treatment but inhibited after long period of vitexin treatment. The mRNA expression results were in accordance with the pharmacokinetic results. In conclusion, vitexin can either inhibit or induce activities of CYP2C11 and CYP3A1. Therefore, caution is needed when vitexin is co-administered with some CYP2C11 or CYP3A1 substrates in clinic, which may result in treatment failure and herb-drug interactions.",

    "70": "We have previously reported that AC-3933, a newly developed benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist, facilitates acetylcholine release in the hippocampus and ameliorates scopolamine-induced memory deficits in rats. To further confirm the procognitive effect of AC-3933, we assessed in this study the beneficial effects of this compound in aged mice using the Y-maze and object recognition tests. In addition, we investigated the synergistic effect of AC-3933 and donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, on scopolamine-induced memory impairment in mice. In aged mice, oral administration of AC-3933 at doses of 0.05-0.1 mg/kg and 0.05 mg/kg significantly improved spatial working memory and episodic memory, respectively. In scopolamine-treated mice, both AC-3933 and donepezil significantly ameliorated memory deficits in the Y-maze test at doses of 0.3-3 mg/kg and 10-15 mg/kg, respectively. The beneficial effect of AC-3933, but not that of donepezil, on scopolamine-induced memory impairment was antagonized by flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, indicating that the procognitive action of AC-3933 arises via a mechanism different from that of donepezil. Co-administration of donepezil at the suboptimal dose of 3 mg/kg with AC-3933 at doses of 0.1-1 mg/kg significantly ameliorated scopolamine-induced memory impairment, suggesting that AC-3933 potentiates the effect of donepezil on memory impairment induced by cholinergic hypofunction. These findings indicate that AC-3933 not only has good potential as a cognitive enhancer by itself, but also is useful as a concomitant drug for the treatment of Alzheimer\u05f3s disease.",

However, the mechanism of sedative and hypnotic effects of this kind of herb is still unclear. In the present study, schizandrin, which is the main component of Schisandra chinensis, was selected as a target compound to investigate possible mechanisms through behavioral pharmacology methods. The results showed that schizandrin possessed dose-dependent (5-45 mg/kg, i.p.) sedative effects on locomotion activity in normal mice, and produced a dose-dependent decrease in sleep latency and an increase in sleep duration in pentobarbital-treated mice; thus, itself did not induce sleep at higher dose which was used in this experiment (45 mg/kg, i.p.). It also can reverse the rodent models of insomnia induced by p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) and caffeine, which could exhibit a syne with 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) as well; therefore, the hypnotic effects of schizandrin were not inhibited by flumazenil (a specific gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A-BZD receptor antagonist).

    "76": "Tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (TETS) is a potent convulsant poison that is thought to trigger seizures by inhibiting the function of the type A gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAAR). Acute intoxication with TETS can cause vomiting, convulsions, status epilepticus (SE) and even death. Clinical case reports indicate that individuals who survive poisoning may exhibit long-term neuropsychological issues and cognitive deficits. Therefore, the objective of this research was to determine whether a recently described mouse model of acute TETS intoxication exhibits persistent behavioral deficits. Young adult male NIH Swiss mice received a seizure-inducing dose of TETS (0.15mg/kg, ip) and then were rescued from lethality by administration of diazepam (5mg/kg, ip) approximately 20min post-TETS-exposure. TETS-intoxicated mice typically exhibited 2 clonic seizures prior to administration of diazepam with no subsequent seizures post-diazepam injection as assessed using behavioral criteria. Seizures lasted an average of 72s. Locomotor activity, anxiety-like and depression-relevant behaviors and cognition were assessed at 1week, 1month and 2months post-TETS exposure using open field, elevated-plus maze, light\u2194dark transitions, tail suspension, forced swim and novel object recognition tasks. Interestingly, preliminary validation tests indicated that NIH Swiss mice do not respond to the shock in fear conditioning tasks. Subsequent evaluation of hot plate and tail flick nociception tasks revealed that this strain exhibits significantly decreased pain sensitivity relative to age- and sex-matched C57BL/6J mice, which displayed normal contextual fear conditioning. NIH Swiss mice acutely intoxicated with TETS exhibited no significant anxiety-related, depression-relevant, learning or memory deficits relative to vehicle controls at any of the time points assessed with the exception of significantly increased locomotor activity at 2months post-TETS intoxication. The general absence of long-term behavioral deficits in TETS-intoxicated mice on these six assays suggests that the neurobehavioral consequences of TETS exposure described in human survivors of acute TETS intoxication are likely due to sustained seizure activity, rather than a direct effect of the chemical itself. Future research efforts are directed toward developing an animal model that better recapitulates the SE and seizure duration reported in humans acutely intoxicated with TETS.", 
    "77": "In about 20-40% of patients, status epilepticus (SE) is refractory to standard treatment with benzodiazepines, necessitating second- and third-line treatments that are not always successful, resulting in increased mortality. Rat models of refractory SE are instrumental in studying the changes underlying refractoriness and to develop more effective treatments for this severe medical emergency. Failure of GABAergic inhibition is a likely cause of the development of benzodiazepine resistance during SE. In addition to changes in GABAA receptor expression, trafficking, and function, alterations in Cl(-) homeostasis with increased intraneuronal Cl(-) levels may be involved. Bumetanide, which reduces intraneuronal Cl(-) by inhibiting the Cl(-) intruding Na(+), K(+), Cl(-) cotransporter NKCC1, has been reported to interrupt SE induced by kainate in urethane-anesthetized rats, indicating that this diuretic drug may be an interesting candidate for treatment of refractory SE. In this study, we evaluated the effects of bumetanide in the kainate and lithium-pilocarpine models of SE as well as a model in which SE is induced by sustained electrical stimulation of the basolateral amygdala. Unexpectedly, bumetanide alone was ineffective to terminate SE in both conscious and anesthetized adult rats. However, it potentiated the anticonvulsant effect of low doses of phenobarbital, although this was only seen in part of the animals; higher doses of phenobarbital, particularly in combination with diazepam, were more effective to terminate SE than bumetanide/phenobarbital combinations. These data do not suggest that bumetanide, alone or in combination with phenobarbital, is a valuable option in the treatment of refractory SE in adult patients.",

In human neuroblastoma cells, either blockade of ARG1 or benzodiazepine-mediated activation of GABA-A receptors induced apoptosis and inhibited mitogenic signaling through AKT and MAPK.

There are two types of glycine receptor: the strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor (GlyA) and the strychnine-insensitive glycine receptor (GlyB); however, which receptor is the main contributor to the anxiolytic actions of GlyT1 inhibitors is yet to be determined. Here, we clarified which glycine receptor is the main contributor to the anxiolytic effects of GlyT1 inhibitors by using maternal separation-induced ultrasonic vocalization (USV) by rat pups as an index of anxiety. We confirmed that administration of the benzodiazepine diazepam or the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor escitaloplam, which are both clinically proven anxiolytics, or the GlyT1 inhibitor SSR504734 (2-chloro-N-[(S)-phenyl[(2S)-piperidin-2-yl] methyl]-3-trifluoromethyl benzamide), decreases USV in rat pups. In addition, we showed that another GlyT1 inhibitor, ALX5407 ((R)-N-[3-(4'-fluorophenyl)-3(4'-phenylphenoxy)propyl]sarcosine) also decreases USV in rat pups. SSR504734- or ALX5407-induced decreases in USV were dose-dependently reversed by administration of the GlyA antagonist strychnine, whereas the diazepam- or escitalopram-induced decreases in USV were not. Furthermore, GlyT1-induced decreases in USV were not reversed by administration of the GlyB antagonist L-687,414. Together, these results suggest that GlyA activation is the main contributor to the anxiolytic actions of GlyT1 inhibitors and that the anxiolytic actions of diazepam and escitalopram cannot be attributed to GlyA activation. Our findings provide new insights into the importance of the activation of GlyA in the anxiolytic effects of GlyT1 inhibitors.",

The dual HCRT receptor antagonist almorexant (ALM) decreases waking and increases sleep. We hypothesized that HCRT antagonists induce sleep, in part, through disfacilitation of BF neurons; consequently, ALM should have reduced efficacy in BF-lesioned (BFx) animals. To test this hypothesis, rats were given bilateral IgG-192-saporin injections, which predominantly targets cholinergic BF neurons. BFx and intact rats were then given oral ALM, the benzodiazepine agonist zolpidem (ZOL) or vehicle (VEH) at lights-out. ALM was less effective than ZOL at inducing sleep in BFx rats compared to controls. BF adenosine (ADO), \u03b3-amino-butyric acid (GABA), and glutamate levels were then determined via microdialysis from intact, freely behaving rats following oral ALM, ZOL or VEH. ALM increased BF ADO and GABA levels during waking and mixed vigilance states, and preserved sleep-associated increases in GABA under low and high sleep pressure conditions. ALM infusion into the BF also enhanced cortical ADO release, demonstrating that HCRT input is critical for ADO signaling in the BF. In contrast, oral ZOL and BF-infused ZOL had no effect on ADO levels in either BF or cortex. ALM increased BF ADO (an endogenous sleep-promoting substance) and GABA (which is increased during normal sleep), and required an intact BF for maximal efficacy, whereas ZOL blocked sleep-associated BF GABA release, and required no functional contribution from the BF to induce sleep. ALM thus induces sleep by facilitating the neural mechanisms underlying the normal transition to sleep.",

Considering that diabetic rats and mice present higher depressive-like behaviour when submitted to the forced swimming test and that treatment with insulin and/or clonazepam is able to reverse the behavioural changes of the diabetic rats, the present work investigated the antioxidant status, specifically total antioxidant reactivity and antioxidant potential of insulin and clonazepam, as well as the effect of this drugs upon protein oxidative damage and reactive species formation in cortex, hippocampus and striatum from diabetic rats submitted to forced swimming test. It was verified that longer immobility time in diabetic rats and insulin plus clonazepam treatment reversed this depressive-like behaviour. Moreover, data obtained in this study allowed to demonstrate through different parameters such as protein carbonyl content, 2'7'-dichlorofluorescein oxidation, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase assay, total radical-trapping antioxidant potential and total antioxidant reactivity that there is oxidative stress in cortex, hippocampus and striatum from diabetic rats under depressive-like behaviour and highlight the insulin and/or clonazepam effect in these different brain areas, restoring antioxidant status and protein damage.",

This study tested the hypothesis that the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF1) antagonist GSK561679 differentially reduces anxiety but increases fear in humans. A total of 31 healthy females received each of four treatments: placebo, 50 mg GSK561679 (low-GSK), 400 mg GSK561679 (high-GSK), and 1 mg alprazolam in a crossover design. Participants were exposed to three conditions during each of the four treatments. The three conditions included one in which predictable aversive shocks were signaled by a cue, a second during which shocks were administered unpredictably, and a third condition without shock. Fear and anxiety were assessed using the acoustic startle reflex. High-GSK had no effect on startle potentiation during unpredictable threat (anxiety) but increased startle potentiation during the predictable condition (fear). Low-GSK did not affect startle potentiation across conditions. Consistent with previous findings, alprazolam reduced startle potentiation during unpredictable threat but not during predictable threat. The increased fear by high-GSK replicates animal findings and suggests a lift of the inhibitory effect of the BNST on the amygdala by the CRF1 antagonist.", 
    "126": "Menthol is used widely as a constituent of functional foods and chemical drugs. The present study investigated changes in the pharmacokinetic behavior of intravenously administered midazolam (MDZ), a probe for CYP3A, when rats were treated with menthol. The study also examined which isoforms of CYP3A1 and 3A2 were menthol-inducible and contributed to the altered disposition of midazolam. Menthol was administered intraperitoneally to rats once daily for 3\u2009days at a dose of 10\u2009mg/kg, while the control rats received vehicle alone. The pharmacokinetic examination of i.v. administered midazolam revealed that serum midazolam concentrations at each sampling point were lower in the menthol-treated rats than in the control rats. Regarding the pharmacokinetic parameters of the menthol-treated group, the area under the curve (AUC) was decreased significantly and, correspondingly, the elimination rate constant at terminal phase (ke) was increased significantly without significant changes in the volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss). The metabolic production of the 1'-hydroxylated and 4'-hydroxylated forms of MDZ by hepatic microsomes was significantly greater in the menthol-treated rats than in the control rats. The expression levels of mRNA and protein for hepatic CYP3A2 were more than 2.5-fold higher than the control levels when the rats were treated with menthol, whereas no changes were observed in the expression levels of CYP3A1. These results indicate that menthol enhanced the elimination clearance of midazolam by inducing hepatic CYP3A2 and that careful attention should be paid when menthol is ingested in combination with drugs that act as substrates for CYP3A.", 
    "127": "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive, incurable disease, characterized by a deregulated cell cycle. Chk1 and Wee1 are main regulators of cell cycle progression and recent data on solid tumors suggest that simultaneous inhibition of these proteins has a strong synergistic cytotoxic effect. The effects of a Chk1 inhibitor (PF-00477736) and a Wee1 inhibitor (MK-1775) have been herein investigated in a large panel of mature B-cell lymphoma cell lines. We found that MCL cells were the most sensitive to the Chk1 inhibitor PF-00477736 and Wee1 inhibitor MK-1775 as single agents. Possible involvement of the translocation t(11;14) in Chk1 inhibitor sensitivity was hypothesized. The combined inhibition of Chk1 and Wee1 was strongly synergistic in MCL cells, leading to deregulation of the cell cycle, with increased activity of CDK2 and CDK1, and activation of apoptosis. In vivo treatment with the drug combination of mice bearing JeKo-1 xenografts (MCL) had a marked antitumor effect with tumor regressions observed at non-toxic doses (best T/C%=0.54%). Gene expression profiling suggested effect on genes involved in apoptosis. The strong synergism observed by combining Chk1 and Wee1 inhibitors in preclinical models of MCL provides the rationale for testing this combination in the clinical setting.",

Preventive diazepam treatment had a weak protective anxiolytic and pro-depressive effect. The therapeutic diazepam treatment didn't influence on the anxiety and depression-like state. Chronic diazepam was ineffective for the treatment of the mixed anxiety/depression state in male mice.

    "131": "Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are a mainstay in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. However, continuity in intake of the prescribed medication has been one of the greatest challenges in these patients. One option to improve medication adherence is to prescribe depot or long-acting injectable formulations (LAIs) of antipsychotics. Following risperidone, several other SGAs have been introduced as LAIs. Olanzapine pamoate, paliperidone palmitate, and aripiprazole are the new-generation LAIs, which are available for 2- to 4-week intervals of application in many countries. The literature shows a clear advantage of these drugs over placebo regarding symptom reduction and relapse prevention. LAIs show a similar safety profile to oral formulations of the relevant drug, with the exception of olanzapine pamoate, which can lead to rare cases of post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome (PDSS). PDSS is characterized by heavy sedation (possibly including coma) and/or delirium after injection. During PDSS events, patients show higher plasma concentrations of olanzapine, leading to the assumption that unintended partial intravascular injection or blood vessel injury during the injection is causative of PDSS. Therefore, a risk-management plan proposing an observation period of 3\u00a0h was introduced.

Despite its widespread clinical use, detailed information about cardiac side effects of midazolam is largely lacking. Using the double-electrode voltage clamp technique, we studied pharmacological effects of midazolam on heterologously expressed Kv1.5 channels underlying atrial repolarizing current I(Kur). Midazolam dose-dependently inhibited Kv1.5 current, yielding an IC50 of 17 \u03bcM in an HEK cell line and an IC50 of 104 \u03bcM in Xenopus oocytes. We further showed that midazolam did not affect the half-maximal activation voltage of Kv1.5 channels. However, a small negative shift of the inactivation curve could be observed. Midazolam acted as a typical open-channel inhibitor with rapid onset of block and without frequency dependence of block. Taken together, midazolam is an open channel inhibitor of cardiac Kv1.5 channels. These data add to the current understanding of the pharmacological profile of midazolam.",

The cross-reactivities were in the range of 24-100% and the limits of detection were in the range of 0.2-1.5 ng mL(-1) depending on the drug. Then a competitive indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed to determine the residues of five benzodiazepines in swine tissues (muscle, liver and kidney). The recoveries of five analytes from the fortified blank samples were in the range of 74.5-96.5% with coefficients of variation lower than 16.7%.

On admission, MRI examination showed high signals in the left occipital cortex and subcortex on T2-weighted images, without reduction of apparent diffusion coefficient suggestive of cerebral infarction. Her EEG demonstrated periodic sharp waves in the left posterior region, and laboratory tests revealed she had increased levels of lactic and pyruvic acid both in blood plasma and CSF. Gene analysis confirmed mitochondrial DNA A3243G mutation. Based on this data, we diagnosed her as having mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and a stroke-like episode (MELAS). L-arginine infusion was unsuccessful for her severe headaches, which remained prolonged. She received a low dose (0.05 mg/kg/h) midazolam infusion, resulting in immediate improvement and the disappearance of headaches and abnormal EEG findings. By the age of 18, she had been readmitted eight times for stroke-like episodes accompanied by headaches. While L-arginine infusions alleviated her headaches when administered on day 1 of her episodes, they were not effective when started on or after day 2. Her L-arginine-resistant headaches were relieved by midazolam. Although the pathogenesis of headaches in MELAS is still unknown, neuronal hyperexcitability and trigeminovascular activation are considered important. Midazolam may play a role in suppressing neuronal hyperexcitability and trigeminovascular activation.

However, it is not known if non-pharmacological modulation of mGluR5 by inflammation impaired the unconditional level of anxiety. In this study, we investigated this relation in LPS prenatal immune challenge (120\u03bcg/kg, 3x i.p. injection in late gestation), a developmental model of neuroinflammation in which some studies have reported hypo-anxious phenotype. Using positron emission tomographic imaging (PET) approaches, we have demonstrated a decrease in the binding potential of [(18)F]fluoro-5-(2-pyridinylethynyl)benzonitrile ([(18)F]FPEB, a radioligand for mGluR5) in hippocampus of adolescent offspring prenatally exposed to LPS, without significant change in the binding of [(11)C]peripheral benzodiazepine receptor 28 ([(11)C]PBR28), an inflammatory marker. In addition, dark-light box emergence test revealed a lower level of anxiety in LPS-exposed offspring and this behavioural phenotype was associated with the binding potential of [(18)F]FPEB in hippocampus. These results confirm that neuroinflammation during developmental phase modulates the physiology of mGluR5 and this alteration can be associated with behavioural phenotype related to anxiety. In addition, this study supports a hypotheses that mGluR5 could be used as a diagnostic target in anxiety.",

In the single-dose nilotinib study, 18 healthy subjects were randomized to 6 treatment sequences to receive single dose of nilotinib 600\u2009mg, midazolam 4\u2009mg, and coadministration of both in a crossover manner. In the repeated-dose nilotinib study, 19 chronic myeloid leukemia patients took a single dose of midazolam 2\u2009mg on days 1 and 13, and nilotinib 400\u2009mg twice daily from days 2-13. In the single-dose study, the geometric mean ratio of the area under the plasma concentration time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC(inf)) of midazolam plus nilotinib vs. midazolam was 1.3 (90%CI, 1.2-1.5) and the maximum observed serum concentration (C(max)) was 1.2 (90%CI, 1.0-1.4). In the repeated-dose study, the values for AUC(inf) and C(max) were 2.6 (90%CI, 2.1-3.3) and 2.0 (90%CI, 1.7-2.4), respectively. These results indicate that single-dose and repeated-dose administration of nilotinib results in weak and moderate inhibition of CYP3A, respectively. Therefore, appropriate monitoring and dose adjustment may be needed for drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A, and have narrow therapeutic index, when coadministered with nilotinib.",

Handgrip strength was assessed using a handheld dynamometer, and balance using the Short Berg's Balance Scale during the period of benzodiazepine use (baseline), and at 1, 2, 3 weeks, and 1, 2 and 6 months after initiating withdrawal. Withdrawal outcome and persistence were determined by plasma benzodiazepine-determinations at baseline and at four weeks (\"short-term withdrawers\", n = 69; \"short-term non-withdrawers\", n = 20), and by interviews at six months (\"long-term withdrawers\", n = 34; \"long-term non-withdrawers\", n = 55).

Mutations slowing aging retard age related pathologies. To assess whether delayed aging retards the effects of a mutant allele causing a Huntington's disease (HD)-like syndrome, we generated compound mutant mice, placing a dominant HD knock-in polyglutamine allele onto the slow-aging Snell dwarf genotype. The Snell genotype did not affect mutant huntingtin protein expression. Bigenic and control mice were evaluated prospectively from 10 to 100 weeks of age. Adult HD knock-in allele mice lost weight progressively with weight loss blunted significantly in male bigenic HD knock-in/Snell dwarf mice. Impaired balance beam performance developed significantly more slowly in bigenic HD knock-in/Snell dwarf mice. Striatal dopamine receptor expression was diminished significantly and similarly in all HD-like mice, regardless of the Snell genotype. Striatal neuronal intranuclear inclusion burden was similar between HD knock-in mice with and without the Snell genotype, whereas nigral neuropil aggregates were diminished in bigenic HD knock-in/Snell dwarf mice. Compared with control mice, Snell dwarf mice exhibited differences in regional benzodiazepine and cannabinoid receptor binding site expression. These results indicate that delaying aging delayed behavioral decline with little effect on the development of striatal pathology in this model of HD but may have altered synaptic pathology. These results indicate that mutations prolonging lifespan in mice delay onset of significant phenotypic features of this model and also demonstrate dissociation between striatal pathology and a commonly used behavioral measure of disease burden in HD models.",

Therefore, strategies to manage dyslipidemia in an effort to prevent or treat CHD have primarily attempted at decreasing LDL-C and raising HDL-C levels. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mediates the exchange of cholesteryl ester for triglycerides between HDL and VLDL and LDL. We have published the first report indicating that a group of Japanese patients who were lacking CETP had extremely high HDL-C levels, low LDL-C levels and a low incidence of CHD. Animal studies, as well as clinical and epidemiologic evidences, have suggested that inhibition of CETP provides an effective strategy to raise HDL-C and reduce LDL-C levels. Four CETP inhibitors have substantially increased HDL-C levels in dyslipidemic patients. This review will discuss the current status and future prospects of CETP inhibitors in the treatment of CHD. At present anacetrapib by Merck and evacetrapib by Eli Lilly are under development. By 100mg of anacetrapib HDL-C increased by 138%, and LDL-C decreased by 40%. Evacetrapib 500 mg also showed dramatic 132% increase of HDL-C, while LDL-C decreased by 40%. If larger, long-term, randomized, clinical end point trials could corroborate other findings in reducing atherosclerosis, CETP inhibitors could have a significant impact in the management of dyslipidemic CHD patients. Inhibition of CETP synthesis by antisense oligonucleotide or small molecules will produce more similar conditions to human CETP deficiency and may be effective in reducing atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events. We are expecting the final data of prospective clinical trials by CETP inhibitors in 2015.",

Fish receiving the low diazepam treatment had significantly larger clutches than fish receiving the highest concentration but neither were different from controls. Diazepam exposure was not associated with a significant change in fertilization rate, hatchability or time to hatch, but a trend toward a higher number of eggs/day was observed in fish exposed to the low diazepam concentration relative to those exposed to the medium concentration. There were no significant differences in any of the behaviors analyzed when responses were averaged over time. The results showed that exposure to diazepam at concentrations as high as 13 \u00b5g L(-1) did not significantly impact the reproductive behavior of fathead minnow.",

Consecutive patients (n = 140) with chronic insomnia were enrolled in this study (68 men and 72 women; mean age, 53.8 \u00b1 10.8 years). All patients filled out a self-assessment questionnaire asking clinical descriptive variables at the baseline of the treatment period; patients received the usual dose of a single type of BZD or BzRA. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale were self-assessed at the baseline, and the former was re-evaluated at the time of cessation of medication or at the end of the 6-month treatment period. The PSQI included the following sub-items: evaluating sleep quality (C1), sleep latency (C2), sleep duration (C3), habitual sleep efficiency (C4), frequency of sleep disturbance (C5), use of sleeping medication (C6), and daytime dysfunction (C7). Among the patients, 54.6% needed to continue hypnotics for a 6-month treatment period. Logistic regression analysis revealed that, among descriptive variables, only the PSQI score appeared as a significant factor associated with long-term use {odds ratio (OR)\u200a= 2.8, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u200a= 2.0-4.0}. The receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis identified that the cut-off PSQI total score at the baseline for predicting long-term use was estimated at 13.5 points (area under the curve = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.8-0.92). Among the sub-items of PSQI, the increases in C1: (OR = 8.4, 95% CI = 2.4-30.0), C3: (OR = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.1-11.5), C4: (OR = 11.1, 95% CI = 3.6-33.9), and C6: (OR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.9-6.2) scores were associated with long-term use. This study revealed that a high PSQI score at the baseline, particularly in the sub-items relating to sleep maintenance disturbance, is predictive of long-term hypnotic treatment. Our results imply the limitation of the effectiveness of hypnotic treatment alone for chronic insomnia.", 
    "191": "Polysomnography (PSG) is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) parasomnias, however its diagnostic yield has been rarely reported. We aimed to assess the diagnostic value of polysomnography in different categories of patients with suspected NREM parasomnia and define variables that can affect the outcome. 124 adults referred for polysomnography for suspected NREM parasomnia were retrospectively identified and divided into clinical categories based on their history. Each polysomnography was analysed for features of NREM parasomnia or different sleep disorders and for presence of potential precipitants. The impact on the outcome of number of recording nights and concomitant consumption of benzodiazepines and antidepressants was assessed. Overall, PSG confirmed NREM parasomnias in 60.5 % patients and showed a different sleep disorder in another 16 %. Precipitants were found in 21 % of the 124 patients. However, PSG showed limited value when the NREM parasomnia was clinically uncomplicated, since it rarely revealed a different diagnosis or unsuspected precipitants (5 % respectively), but became essential for people with unusual features in the history where different or overlapping diagnoses (18 %) or unsuspected precipitants (24 %) were commonly identified. Taking benzodiazepines or antidepressants during the PSG reduced the diagnostic yield. PSG has a high diagnostic yield in patients with suspected NREM parasomnia, and can reveal a different diagnosis or precipitants in over 40 % of people with complicated or atypical presentation or those with a history of epilepsy. We suggest that PSG should be performed for one night in the first instance, with leg electrodes and respiratory measurements and after benzodiazepine and antidepressant withdrawal.",

Mistaking the former for the latter will lead to incorrect treatment and poor outcomes. None of the classic antidepressants, serotonin specific reuptake inhibitors, or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors have ever received regulatory approval as monotherapies for the treatment of bipolar depression. At present, there are only 3 approved medication treatments for bipolar depression: olanzapine/fluoxetine combination, quetiapine (immediate or extended release), and lurasidone (monotherapy or adjunctive to lithium or valproate). All 3 have similar efficacy profiles, but they differ in terms of tolerability. Number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH) can be used to quantify these similarities and differences. The NNTs for response and remission for each of these interventions vs placebo range from 4 to 7, and 5 to 7, respectively, with overlap in terms of their 95% confidence intervals. NNH values less than 10 (vs placebo) were observed for the spontaneously reported adverse events of weight gain and diarrhea for olanzapine/fluoxetine combination (7 and 9, respectively) and somnolence and dry mouth for quetiapine (3 and 4, respectively). There were no NNH values less than 10 (vs placebo) observed with lurasidone treatment. NNH values vs placebo for weight gain of at least 7% from baseline were 6, 16, 58, and 36, for olanzapine/fluoxetine combination, quetiapine, lurasidone monotherapy, and lurasidone combined with lithium or valproate, respectively. Individualizing treatment decisions will require consideration of the different potential adverse events that are more likely to occur with each medication. The metric of the likelihood to be helped or harmed (LHH) is the ratio of NNH to NNT and can illustrate the tradeoffs inherent in selecting medications. A more favorable LHH was noted for treatment with lurasidone. However, OFC and quetiapine monotherapy may still have utility in high urgency situations, particularly in persons who have demonstrated good outcomes with these interventions in the past, and where a pressing clinical need for efficacy mitigates their potential tolerability shortcomings. In terms of maintenance therapy, adjunctive quetiapine is the only agent where the NNT vs lithium or valproate alone is less than 10 for both the prevention of mania and the prevention of depression.",

The mothers were followed-up yearly for purchases of benzodiazepines, starting 4\u2009years before the child's birth and continuing up to the child's 7th birthday. BZD purchases in different mother groups were compared using negative binomial hurdle models.", 
    "202": "The five mother types identified by LCA were mothers with substance abuse (1%), mothers with psychiatric disorders (1%), mothers with a risk of social marginalization (11%), mothers with minor social problems (18%) and mothers with no identified problems (69%; the comparison group). Mothers with substance abuse problems had the highest odds of purchasing BZDs [odds ratio OR\u2009=\u200927.5, 95%CI\u2009=\u200922.9-33.0; RR\u2009=\u200920.2, 95%CI\u2009=\u200914.9-27.3.

    "204": "The number of UK hospital patients receiving procedural sedation remains unknown. Our trainee research network recorded all procedural sedation given over a 48-h period at six acute hospitals in the South West of England. Three hundred and sixty patients aged between 1 and 96\u00a0years old were sedated. Most sedation occurred in endoscopy units (56.4%), operating theatres (30.3%) and cardiology departments (7.2%). Sedation was administered in 82.8% of cases by consultants, and in only 5.6% of cases by nurses. The most frequent sedative combination was midazolam and fentanyl, with median (IQR [range]) doses of 2\u00a0(2-3 [1-10]) mg and 50\u00a0(50-100 [10-300]) \u03bcg used, respectively. We tested a methodology that could be used in a UK-wide denominator survey to describe sedation practice across the NHS. A national audit collecting serious adverse outcomes of sedation (severe harm or death) could then identify hotspots of sedation risk (clinical areas, patient groups, procedures and sedation techniques) where consistent application of current and improved standards might reduce harm.",

    "210": "The evolutionarily conserved peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), or 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), is thought to be essential for cholesterol transport and steroidogenesis, and thus life. TSPO has been proposed as a biomarker of neuroinflammation and a new drug target in neurological diseases ranging from Alzheimer's disease to anxiety. Here we show that global C57BL/6-Tspo(tm1GuWu(GuwiyangWurra))-knockout mice are viable with normal growth, lifespan, cholesterol transport, blood pregnenolone concentration, protoporphyrin IX metabolism, fertility and behaviour. However, while the activation of microglia after neuronal injury appears to be unimpaired, microglia from (GuwiyangWurra)TSPO knockouts produce significantly less ATP, suggesting reduced metabolic activity. Using the isoquinoline PK11195, the ligand originally used for the pharmacological and structural characterization of the PBR/TSPO, and the imidazopyridines CLINDE and PBR111, we demonstrate the utility of (GuwiyangWurra)TSPO knockouts to provide robust data on drug specificity and selectivity, both in vitro and in vivo, as well as the mechanism of action of putative TSPO-targeting drugs.", 
    "211": "The study of animal behaviour is important for both ecology and ecotoxicology, yet research in these two fields is currently developing independently. Here, we synthesize the available knowledge on drug-induced behavioural alterations in fish, discuss potential ecological consequences and report results from an experiment in which we quantify both uptake and behavioural impact of a psychiatric drug on a predatory fish (Perca fluviatilis) and its invertebrate prey (Coenagrion hastulatum). We show that perch became more active while damselfly behaviour was unaffected, illustrating that behavioural effects of pharmaceuticals can differ between species. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prey consumption can be an important exposure route as on average 46% of the pharmaceutical in ingested prey accumulated in the predator. This suggests that investigations of exposure through bioconcentration, where trophic interactions and subsequent bioaccumulation of exposed individuals are ignored, underestimate exposure. Wildlife may therefore be exposed to higher levels of behaviourally altering pharmaceuticals than predictions based on commonly used exposure assays and pharmaceutical concentrations found in environmental monitoring programmes.", 
    "212": "This study evaluated the efficacy of olanzapine in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and improving the quality of life (QoL) of patients with cancer during chemotherapy. Two hundred twenty-nine patients with cancer who received chemotherapy from January 2008 to August 2008 were enrolled, and they were randomised to receive olanzapine or a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. The patients completed a CINV questionnaire once daily on days 1-5 and a QoL questionnaire on days 0 and 6. The complete response (CR) rates for nausea (76.85% versus 46.2%) and vomiting (84.3% versus 67.6%) were significantly higher in the olanzapine group than in the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist group for delayed CINV but not for acute CINV. The CR rates for nausea (76.85% versus 44.44%) and vomiting (85.95% versus 67.59%) were also significantly higher in the olanzapine group for the 5 days post-chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, global health status, emotional functioning, and insomnia were improved in the olanzapine group but worsened in the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist group, whereas cognitive functioning and appetite loss were unchanged. Moreover, olanzapine significantly improved global health status, emotional functioning, social functioning, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, insomnia, and appetite loss. Olanzapine improved the QoL of patients with cancer during chemotherapy, in part by reducing the incidence of delayed CINV.",

We hypothesized that, in children, sevoflurane provides superior cardioprotection after cardiac surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) compared with totally intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA).", 
    "214": "In this randomized controlled, single-centre study, 60 children with cyanotic and acyanotic heart defects undergoing elective cardiac surgery under CPB (RACHS-1 1-3) were randomized to sevoflurane or TIVA (midazolam <6 months of age, propofol >6 months of age). The primary end-point was the postoperative peak cardiac troponin I/T (cTnI/T). Perioperative cardiac function (as determined by brain-type natriuretic peptide, echocardiography and postoperative vasopressor/inotrope requirements), short-term clinical outcomes (duration of intubation, intensive care unit and hospital length of stay), postoperative inflammatory profile, and pulmonary, renal and liver function were defined as secondary end-points. Analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis.", 
    "215": "There was no statistically significant difference in postoperative peak troponin values or any of the secondary end-points. In the subgroup of acyanotic patients under 6 months, sevoflurane led to significantly lower postoperative troponin levels compared with midazolam [reduction of 54% (95% confidence interval 29-71%, P = 0.002)], without any differences in secondary outcome parameters.", 
    "216": "Sevoflurane did not provide superior myocardial protection in our general paediatric cardiac surgical population. In children under 6 months, however, sevoflurane might be beneficial in comparison with midazolam. The conditioning effects of sevoflurane in specific paediatric subgroups need to be further investigated.", 
    "217": "Antipsychotic drugs (APs) are of great benefit in several psychiatric disorders, but they can be associated with various adverse effects, including seizures. To investigate the effects of chronic antipsychotic treatment on seizure susceptibility in genetically epilepsy-prone rats, some APs were administered for 7 weeks, and seizure susceptibility (audiogenic seizures) was evaluated once a week during treatment and for 5 weeks after drug withdrawal. Furthermore, acute and subchronic (5-day treatment) effects were also measured. Rats received haloperidol (0.2-1.0 mg/kg), clozapine (1-5 mg/kg), risperidone (0.03-0.50 mg/kg), quetiapine (2-10 mg/kg), aripriprazole (0.2-1.0 mg/kg), and olanzapine (0.13-0.66 mg/kg), and tested according to treatment duration. Acute administration of APs had no effect on seizures, whereas, after regular treatment, aripiprazole reduced seizure severity; haloperidol had no effects and all other APs increased seizure severity. In chronically treated rats, clozapine showed the most marked proconvulsant effects, followed by risperidone and olanzapine. Quetiapine and haloperidol had only modest effects, and aripiprazole was anticonvulsant. Finally, the proconvulsant effects lasted at least 2-3 weeks after treatment suspension; for aripiprazole, a proconvulsant rebound effect was observed. Taken together, these results indicate and confirm that APs might have the potential to increase the severity of audiogenic seizures but that aripiprazole may exert anticonvulsant effects. The use of APs in patients, particularly in patients with epilepsy, should be monitored for seizure occurrence, including during the time after cessation of therapy. Further studies will determine whether aripiprazole really has a potential as an anticonvulsant drug and might also be clinically relevant for epileptic patients with psychiatric comorbidities."
