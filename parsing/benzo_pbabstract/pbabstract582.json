    "0": "The anxiolytic effects of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) in the Geller-Seifter rat conflict test have been compared with those of muscimol and sodium valproate in order to evaluate the possible role of GABA in the anxiolytic action of the benzodiazepines. The anticonflict activity of CDP was inhibited by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro15-1788, as well as by bicuculline and picrotoxin. The weaker anticonflict effect of muscimol was overcome by both bicuculline and picrotoxin. Sodium valproate had a marked anticonflict effect which was only inhibited by picrotoxin. Thus, while the anxiolytic action of CDP depends on GABA function in some way, it can be distinguished from the effects of muscimol and sodium valproate which appear to act at the GABA receptor and the chloride ion channel, respectively.", 
    "1": "The effectiveness of Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, in modifying the effects of the benzodiazepine derivative clorazepate on schedule-controlled behaviour and pituitary-adrenal activity of rats was investigated. At low doses (5 mg/kg) clorazepate increased punished responding and slightly decreased basal plasma corticosterone levels. At high doses (40 mg/kg), clorazepate suppressed fixed ratio responding, raised basal plasma levels of corticosterone and reduced the stress response produced by exposure to a novel environment. Pretreatment with Ro 15-1788 blocked the behavioural and neuroendocrine effects of the high dose of clorazepate. These results suggest that both types of effects of clorazepate share a common mechanism which involves brain benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "2": "The task of the psychopharmacologist in the ICU does not stop with a recommendation of the best drug and dosage. The clinical course of patients in ICUs is often stormy. With each change, the appropriateness of the chosen psychopharmacologic treatment may be questioned. Is the patient experiencing a side effect? Should the drug be discontinued or the dosage altered? Nonpsychiatrists are often unfamiliar and uncomfortable with psychotropic medications and are not as likely to accurately assess side effects or therapeutic progress. Try to anticipate the more likely complications in the progress notes without being too lengthy, and attempt to verbally communicate impressions and recommendations. Finally, stay abreast of the patient's progress, and make it clear that you are available for consultation and advice. In this way you may assure that the patient will be best able to tolerate and benefit from ICU treatment.", 
    "3": "No one drug is specific for the management of violent behavior. Rather, the pharmacologic treatment of aggression is best approached by identifying and treating the underlying psychopathology, with the expectation that the violent behavior will resolve secondarily. Pharmacologic management is probably most successful when other treatment modalities such as family, group, and individual psychotherapies are used concurrently.", 
    "4": "Generally, there are few absolute contraindications to the use of somatic psychiatric therapies in the medically or surgically ill. A knowledge of psychotropic drugs, of their predictable effects on organs, of their interactions with other medications, and of the idiosyncratic reactions that they often produce allows the consultation psychiatrist to treat the seriously ill patient safely. Close collaboration with other consultants is essential to maximize therapeutic benefits.", 
    "5": "Although anxiety is a familiar part of all our lives, pathologic anxiety states that lead to occupational and social dysfunction require medical treatment. Currently, the anxiety disorders are divided into nonphobic and phobic disorders. However, recent studies suggest that the disorders should be divided into three symptom groups: (1) generalized anxiety, (2) episodes with severe panic anxiety (panic attacks) plus generalized anxiety or even phobic avoidance, and (3) phobic anxiety and avoidance (alone, without panic attacks). This grouping is highly predictive of response to antianxiety medications. The generalized anxiety group responds well to psychosocial/psychotherapy treatments and to the antianxiety BZs. Many people with nonpanic, nonphobic (situational or generalized) anxiety only require simple psychotherapy or other nonpharmacologic methods to manage their anxiety. However, if the anxious patient is becoming dysfunctional or symptomatology is severe or persistent enough to warrant the use of medication, BZs are certainly the drugs of choice. Despite persistent public or media opinion that they are over-utilized or over-prescribed, most objective data suggest this is not the case. Most individuals for whom they are prescribed need them, use them in proper doses, and discontinue them when the indication passes. Most of the reported abuse occurs in the approximately 8 to 12 per cent who abuse other drugs, most notably alcohol. As anxiety is usually transient, BZs should be prescribed for limited periods (1 to 4 weeks) and then discontinued. This practice allows the physician to properly monitor the amount utilized and to evaluate need for continued BZs. The principal differences among the available BZs are their elimination half-lives, with some greater than 24 hours and others in the 8 to 12 hour range. Side effects are mostly mild (sedation, clumsiness) and drug-drug interactions are uncommon. Until recently, most patients suffering from disorders with panic attacks with or without phobias were either untreated or treated with long, but largely unsuccessful, treatments. Blockade of panic attacks with TCAs, MAOIs and alprazolam has dramatically improved our ability to treat these disorders, with 60 to 95 per cent of patients reporting marked alleviation of symptoms. Adequate amounts of medication and length of treatment period are the keys to successful treatment. This is a period of much productive interest and research in the anxiety disorders. Continued rapid progress in the understanding of the biologic substrates of these conditions and the development of new treatments promise much in this area of medicine in the near future.", 
    "6": "Of the many drug therapies mentioned in this review, only the alcohol-sensitizing drugs have current therapeutic applications in primary alcoholics. When alcohol abuse occurs in association with anxiety, depression, or schizophrenia, treatment with the anxiolytic, antidepressant, and neuroleptic drugs, respectively, may facilitate the alcoholic's ability to participate in other programs. Patients should receive drugs that are appropriate to treatment goals as well as to their psychosocial status. Even if a drug therapy is shown to be efficacious under controlled experimental conditions, its effectiveness may be compromised by a large number of factors that include poor compliance by the patient, a lack of a treatment strategy, or failure to optimize the treatment conditions. New pharmacotherapies with actions directed at central neurochemical pathways mediating alcohol consumption are urgently needed. However, even if such agents become available, they too will only be adjuncts to behavioral and social therapies directed at stabilizing all aspects of the alcoholic's life.", 
    "7": "This study was undertaken to evaluate fetal toxicity of benzodiazepine derivatives, nitrazepam, oxazepam, nimetazepam, clonazepam, diazepam and chlordiazepoxide. In fetotoxicities induced by the oral administration of these six drugs (100 mg/kg), nitrazepam (NTZ) and nimetazepam caused a great damage to the fetus compared with other analogues. The fetotoxicity of NTZ was dose-dependent at a dose of 50 to 100 mg/kg p.o. and its peak toxicity was observed in the group treated from the 8th to 10th day of gestation. Maternal serum and whole fetus concentration of NTZ were higher than that of diazepam which showed weak toxicity. It was suggested that the intensity of fetotoxicity induced by benzodiazepines was related to the amount of drug in blood of dam.", 
    "8": "Eight schizophrenic patients received alprazolam in an open-label protocol. A partial reversal of negative symptoms was noted in six of the eight patients. Also, all eight experienced a decrease in anxiety. Alprazolam in doses of 5 to 7 mg/day yielded steady state plasma levels of 6 to 64 ng/ml. As the drug was well tolerated at these doses and as negative symptoms of schizophrenia are difficult to treat, a double-blind, controlled trial of alprazolam is underway to test more rigorously these preliminary results.", 
    "9": "An 82-year-old white female developed a 36-hour episode of unresponsiveness/drowsiness after a single dose of triazolam 0.5 mg in combination with cimetidine. This case illustrates the need for careful dose-titration of drug therapy in the elderly, particularly when a drug with the potential to impair drug metabolism is coadministered. Cimetidine, when coadministered with triazolam, may increase the intensity and duration of action of single doses of triazolam.", 
    "10": "The authors tested in dogs the hypothesis that beta-adrenoceptor blockade might alter the time course or magnitude of serum potassium (K+) changes following the administration of succinylcholine (SCh). The results indicate that the normal increase in K+ induced by SCh (1 mg/kg intravenously) is exaggerated in the presence of propranolol-induced (0.25 mg/kg), beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Specifically, a peak increase of 1.7 mEq/1 (43%) over control K+ was noted in the beta-blocked dogs versus a 0.5 mEq/1 (13%) increase in control dogs. The peak increase in K+ occurred later in the beta-blocked dogs (60-90 min post-SCh) versus control dogs (30 min post-SCh). The authors postulate that these results reflect impairment of intracellular uptake of the SCh-induced acute K+ load secondary to beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Additionally, in a third group of dogs, diazepam in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg attenuated the K+ increases (1 mEq/1-24%) following SCh in beta-blocked dogs. Whether these data can be extrapolated to beta-adrenoceptor blocked patients remains a matter for further investigation. In the interim, periodic monitoring of K+ is warranted in any patient receiving medications known to alter the state of activity of the beta-adrenoceptor. In particular, careful consideration must be given to the potential impact of various interventions (SCh administration, K+ infusion) on K+ levels in beta-adrenoceptor blocked patients.", 
    "11": "An elderly woman developed a high serum digoxin concentration resulting in toxicity when alprazolam was added to her digoxin therapy. The reduced renal clearance of digoxin is postulated as the mechanism for this interaction.", 
    "12": "Two patients had grand mal seizures following abrupt discontinuation of short-term treatment with alprazolam. Alprazolam's pharmacokinetic and clinical properties are discussed in relation to withdrawal reactions.", 
    "13": "Alcohol can increase blood levels of diazepam, and probably of other benzodiazepines. Alcohol also potentiates the CNS-depressant effects of these drugs. Before adding a psychotropic drug in older patients, discontinue as many drugs as possible. Prescribe smaller doses and follow cardiovascular status. Determine serum levels when in doubt, especially with tricyclic antidepressants.", 
    "14": "Receptors for benzodiazepines (BZ) and beta-carboline-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (beta-CCE) has been solubilized with decanoly-N-methylglucamide (DMG), a new kind of nonionic detergent. The apparent dissociation constants of diazepam and beta-CCE for solubilized receptor were similar to those for synaptic membranes. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of the solubilized receptor protein revealed that the binding profile of [3H]beta-CCE essentially parallels that of [3H]diazepam and that both sedimentation coefficients were 10.5S. Co2+ and Ni2+, which increase [3H]diazepam binding and decrease [3H]beta-CCE binding to synaptic membranes, remarkably increased the binding of both to the solubilized receptor. Mg2+ and Ca2+, which had no effect on membrane receptor binding, also enhanced [3H]diazepam and [3H]beta-CCE binding to the solubilized receptor. The increase in binding in the presence of these divalent cations was due to a change in the apparent number of binding sites, with no change in binding affinities. The relative lack of specificity in divalent cation effects on solubilized BZ receptor may be caused by separation or destruction of the cation recognition site or channel of the BZ receptor complex by solubilization of the synaptic membrane with DMG.", 
    "15": "The gamma-aminobutyrate-benzodiazepine receptor complex was solubilized from the rat brain and bovine cortex and partially purified by means of gel chromatography. Analysis of binding parameters of [3H]muscimol indicates that the complex includes only one class of binding sites which presumably represent an apparently low affinity class of two classes of gamma-aminobutyrate A receptors described on the brain membranes. Analysis of the [3H] flunitrazepam specific binding also shows the presence of one class of binding sites sensitive to gamma-aminobutyrate stimulation. The concentration of muscimol binding sites in the gamma-aminobutyrate-benzodiazepine receptor complex was observed to be twice as high as the concentration of benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "16": "Electrophysiological recordings from mouse neurones in tissue culture have been used to investigate how agents which interact with the benzodiazepine receptor modulate neuronal responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and its mimetics, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol (THIP) and piperidine-4-sulphonic acid (P4S). Experiments were performed in a physiological medium, pH 7.35 at 34-36 degrees C. gamma-Aminobutyric acid, THIP and P4S were applied by iontophoresis to neuronal somata. Responses were assessed by current-clamp or voltage-clamp recordings. Midazolam (an agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor) and the beta-carboline, methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM; an inverse agonist at the BZ receptor), were applied by pressure ejection from blunt pipettes. The potency order of the agonists was GABA greater than P4S greater than THIP. Midazolam (10(-7)-10(-5) M) potentiated responses to all three agonists to a similar extent with a shift to the left of the dose-response curve. The drug DMCM (10(-6)-10(-5) M) decreased the responses to all three agonists to a similar extent. The DMCM-induced depression was of a non-competitive nature. It has previously been proposed that THIP is a partial agonist and P4S an antagonist at the GABA receptor coupled to the benzodiazepine receptor, or that the benzodiazepine-receptor-coupled and electrophysiological GABA receptors are distinct. In the present study, responses to the three agonists were modulated to a comparable extent following manipulation of the benzodiazepine receptor. It is therefore unnecessary to invoke the above explanations to account for these results.", 
    "17": "On the basis of information known about the pathogenesis of Reye's Syndrome and Hepatic Encephalopathy, and the effect of specific pharmacologic agents at the benzodiazepine receptor it is hypothesized that benzodiazepine receptor antagonists and contragonists will be of therapeutic value in those disorders.", 
    "18": "The density of \"peripheral-type\" binding sites for benzodiazepines (PBS) in the rat pineal gland was reduced by approximately 50% three weeks after superior cervical ganglionectomy or exposure to constant light; the apparent affinity of [3H]Ro 5-4864 (the prototype ligand for these sites) remained unchanged. In contrast, neither the density of PBS nor the apparent affinity of [3H]Ro 5-4864 for these sites was altered in cerebral cortex by these procedures. The demonstration that PBS density is under neural control in the pineal gland suggests that these sites may have a physiologic role. The high density of PBS in pineal (approximately 24 pmol/mg protein) suggests that this tissue may be a useful model to study both the physiologic and pharmacologic function of these sites.", 
    "19": "The effects of the acute and chronic administration of the beta-carboline benzodiazepine receptor ligand, FG 7142 were studied in mice. On acute administration FG 7142 (at doses between 10 and 40 mg kg-1) lowered seizure thresholds to infused pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) but showed an unusual dose-response curve in that higher doses had less effect. The duration of action was considerably longer than that of other beta-carbolines, such as ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta CCE). During repeated administration, doses of FG 7142 which were initially proconvulsant subsequently produced generalized seizures on average in 60% of animals after 12 once daily treatments. This seemed to be a form of chemical kindling. The effects of different drug administration regimes were studied. Once daily dosage was shown to be the optimum for kindling production, and was therefore used for subsequent experiments. Kindling lasted for at least one month after 12 single once daily doses of 40 mg kg-1 (FG 7142). The administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 concurrent with FG 7142 prevented kindling. When Ro 15-1788 was given to kindled animals along with a challenge dose of FG 7142, it prevented the expression of kindled seizures. These data show that kindling is mediated via the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "20": "The intrathecal (i.t.) administration of morphine inhibits nociceptive motor responses and activity in ascending axons evoked by stimulation of nociceptive afferent nerve fibers (nociceptive sensory response) in the rat. The i.t. administration of cholecystokinin octapeptide and ceruletide inhibits nociceptive motor responses, but does not affect ascending nociceptive activity. This shows that drug-induced depression of nociceptive motor responses is not always associated with depression of the nociceptive sensory response of the spinal cord. The microiontophoretic application of substance P excites single dorsal horn neurons that respond to noxious stimulation, whereas the i.t. administration of substance P inhibits both nociceptive motor and sensory responses. Thus, the results obtained from the i.t. administration of a drug may differ from those obtained from its application to single spinal neurons. Diazepam inhibits spinal reflexes and may reduce pain sensation in humans. To assess whether a spinal action is involved in the pain-relieving effect of diazepam, experiments were carried out on spinalized rats in which activity evoked by the stimulation of nociceptive and nonnociceptive afferent nerve fibers of the sural nerve was recorded from single ascending axons below the site of spinal cord transection. Diazepam, 20 micrograms i.t., reduced activity evoked by afferent A delta and C fiber stimulation and by stimulation of afferent A beta fibers. The depressant effect caused by diazepam, 2 mg/kg i.v., on C fiber-evoked ascending activity was reduced by the i.t. injection of the benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788 (40 micrograms), an imidazodiazepine. It is concluded that the depression by diazepam of C fiber-evoked ascending activity contributes to pain relief caused by the drug.", 
    "21": "Using an extensively washed membrane preparation and standardized incubation conditions, the actions of benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor ligands were evaluated on [3H]flunitrazepam [+/- 10 microM gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)], [3H]muscimol (+/- 2.5 microM etazolate) and [35S]butyl bicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding. Classical BZ receptor agonists stimulated [35S]TBPS binding and [3H]muscimol binding in the presence of etazolate. These agents also possessed ratios for [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the absence and presence of GABA (GABA ratio) of 2 to 5. BZ antagonists and inverse agonists had GABA ratios less than 1 and did not alter, or reduced, both [35S]TBPS and [3H]muscimol (+etazolate) binding. The nonsedating BZ agonist/antagonist agents CGS 9896, CL 218872, PK 8165 and PK 9084 all possessed GABA ratios between 1.1 and 1.4 and only stimulated [35S]TBPS and [3H]muscimol (+etazolate) binding to approximately 50% of the level of classical BZ agonists. The BZ partial agonists CGS 9895 and RU 39419 both were unique in that they possessed GABA ratios of 1 or less, stimulated [35S]TBPS binding and had no effect on [3H]muscimol binding (+etazolate). Therefore, by monitoring the major components of the BZ receptor complex (BZ receptor, GABA receptor and chloride channel), we were able to distinguish between different BZ drugs and to support suggestions that these drugs act via unique BZ receptor populations which possess differential couplings to the GABA receptor and chloride channel.", 
    "22": "Irreversible labeling of benzodiazepine receptors in membranes from cerebellum or hippocampus was compared at 0 degrees C using [3H]flunitrazepam as a photoaffinity ligand. [3H]Flunitrazepam reproducibly and irreversibly labeled mainly one protein (P51) in cerebellum and at least two proteins (P51 and P55) in hippocampus at both temperatures. Differential inhibition at 37 degrees C of irreversible [3H]flunitrazepam binding to the individual proteins by several selective benzodiazepine receptor ligands supports the hypothesis that P51 and P55 are associated with different benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "23": "The binding of [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]RO5-4864 was measured in unwashed brain homogenates and in extensively washed brain membranes from amygdala-kindled and \"yoked\" control rats sacrificed 2 weeks following the sixth stage 5 convulsion. In unwashed homogenates, [3H]flunitrazepam binding was reduced in both the hypothalamus and ipsilateral right cortex of kindled rats (unchanged in other areas). In washed brain membranes, [3H]flunitrazepam binding was unaltered in these regions; it was bilaterally elevated, however, in both the amygdala and hippocampus (unchanged in other areas). In washed membranes, the in vitro addition of gamma-aminobutyric acid enhanced [3H]flunitrazepam binding to a similar extent in kindled and control membranes. These data indicate that the type of benzodiazepine binding abnormality observed after kindling depends on the type of tissue preparation employed in the assay procedure.", 
    "24": "Kynuramine, an endogenously occurring metabolite of L-tryptophan, was found to displace [3H]tryptamine from its high affinity binding sites in rat brain cortex with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 28 nM. Kynuramine exhibited structural specificity and considerable selectivity, compared with its affinity for serotonergic, adrenergic and benzodiazepine recognition sites. This novel finding opens-up the possibility that kynuramine may exert physiological actions via the putative tryptamine receptor.", 
    "25": "There is a need in clinical practice for an antagonist which can reverse the sedative action of benzodiazepines. Recently, 3-hydroxymethyl-beta-carboline (3-HMC) has been reported to inhibit the sleep inducing effects of flurazepam. The effects of flurazepam (0.5, 5 and 50 mg/kg) on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral O2 consumption (CMRO2) were evaluated in rats and the ability of 3-HMC to reverse these changes was determined. Regional CBF was measured with radioactive microspheres and cortical CMRO2 was calculated from sagittal sinus-arterial O2 content differences and cortical CBF. Flurazepam produced dose dependent decreases in CBF and CMRO2 which were significant at 5 and 50 mg/kg. 3-HMC (5 mg/kg) inhibited flurazepam induced changes at the 5 mg/kg dose but had little effect on the CBF and CMRO2 depression produced by 50 mg/kg flurazepam. At a dose of 25 mg/kg, 3-HMC inhibited the effects of both 5 and 50 mg/kg flurazepam. Blood pressure and heart rate were also decreased by flurazepam but these variables were not reversed as effectively by 3-HMC treatment. The results indicate that 3-HMC is an active antagonist of the cerebrovascular and cerebral metabolic depression produced by flurazepam and can stimulate CBF and CMRO2 at high doses when given alone.", 
    "26": "Mouse peritoneal inflammatory macrophages have a saturable binding site for [3H]flunitrazepam with a KD of 43 +/- 7 nM and Bmax of 391 +/- 58 fmol per 10(6) cells, which corresponds to 250 000 sites per cell. The IC50 values for PK 11195, Ro 5-4864, diazepam, flunitrazepam, clonazepam, ethyl-beta carboline 3-carboxylate and Ro 15-1788 were 5.6, 6.5, 21, 40, 3 000, 12 000 and 80 000 nM respectively; gamma-aminobutyric acid did not displace [3H]flunitrazepam. These results indicate that the benzodiazepine binding site on the macrophage is of the peripheral type. In vivo experiments show that, at 1 mg/kg, peripheral and mixed type molecules stimulate the humoral response to sheep red blood cells while central type benzodiazepines are inactive. The hypothesis that this effect is mediated through the binding on the macrophage may be considered.", 
    "27": "Circadian variations of lorazepam-induced neurologic deficits were tested in mice. The duration of the impairment after administration of 3 mg/kg lorazepam was considerably shorter at 2100 h compared to other times of the day. No significant variations could be found for brain concentrations of drug at recovery and 15 or 30 min after drug administration. Food intake did not seem to account for the circadian pattern observed. It was therefore concluded that chronergy of lorazepam is a result of altered sensitivity of the animal over time rather than to altered pharmacokinetics.", 
    "28": "Specific binding of the BZ-receptor ligand 3H-DMCM to rat cortical membranes was dramatically enhanced by preincubation of the homogenate with 0.1 mM silver (Ag+) nitrate. The binding was completely inhibited by midazolam. Nevertheless, the pharmacological specificity of the Ag+-enhanced 3H-DMCM binding was different from that of BZ-receptors. Furthermore, the Bmax value, the regional distribution and the molecular target size determined by radiation inactivation analysis of the Ag+-enhanced binding site were different from those of BZ-receptors. The results indicate that Ag+-enhanced 3H-DMCM binding represent a high affinity metal complex formation between 3H-DMCM and an unknown brain specific protein of approximately 100,000 daltons molecular weight.", 
    "29": "The effectiveness of beta-carboline-3-carboxylate-t-butyl ester (beta CCtB) in antagonizing the anticonvulsant, ataxic and antipunishment effects of diazepam were evaluated. In mice, beta CCtB at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg produced a dose-related antagonism of the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam against pentylenetetrazole (80 mg/kg). A dose of 30 mg/kg of beta CCtB did not produce a further shift in the diazepam dose-effect curve, apparently because beta CCtB failed to block the muscle-relaxant effects of diazepam. Further, beta CCtB (30 mg/kg) failed to antagonize the ataxic effects of diazepam in an inverted screen test. Rats responded under a multiple schedule where in one component every twentieth response (FR20) resulted in water presentation (unpunished component) and in another component every twentieth response (FR20) resulted in both shock and water presentation (punished component). Diazepam p.o. (0.1 to 10 mg/kg) first increased and then decreased rates in the punished component but only decreased rates in the unpunished component. beta CCtB had no effect on response rates when administered alone, but antagonized the rate-increasing effects of diazepam in the punished component. beta CCtB did not alter the rate-decreasing effects of diazepam in either component. Thus, beta CCtB selectively antagonized the effects of diazepam on punished behavior as well as the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam, but beta CCtB failed to antagonize the rate-decreasing and ataxic effects of diazepam. These results are consistent with the interpretation that beta CCtB is a selective BZ1 benzodiazepine receptor antagonist.", 
    "30": "The antagonism of some benzodiazepine (Bz) actions by physostigmine was investigated in 4 Papio papio baboons. As a model of these actions, the myoclonus induced in this species by clonazepam i.m. administration was used. The baboon develops, 20-30 min after Bz i.m. injection, a non-epileptic myoclonus characterized by clinical symptomatology (jerks involving mainly the neck and the trunk bilaterally), by the absence of any correlative EEG discharge, and by its facilitation during movement. This Bz-induced myoclonus resembles the intention myoclonus of human patients, as seen for example after anoxia. In the present series, the effect of physostigmine i.v. injection on the frequency of clonazepam-induced myoclonus was tested. Physostigmine produces a rapid and total abolition of the myoclonus, and this effect lasts for a period which corresponds to the pharmacological activity of physostigmine. On the contrary, atropine i.v. injection considerably increases the amount of Bz-induced myoclonus. These results allow the existence of an anticholinergic action of benzodiazepines, reversed by physostigmine, and the theory that the myoclonus would be the consequence of a cholinergic system depression to be hypothesized.", 
    "31": "A boiled extract of porcine cerebral cortex was fractionated on Sephadex G-75 and LH-20 followed by paper chromatography of the active fraction having inhibitory activity towards [3H]GABA binding to rat brain synaptic membranes. A ninhydrin-negative substance migrating more quickly than authentic GABA was identified as a copper-GABA complex. The complex inhibited specific [3H]GABA binding (IC50 approximately equal to 1 microM) and antagonized the anticonvulsant effect exerted by intraamygdaloid injection of diazepam. The effect of a synthetic copper-GABA complex was compared and found to be similar to the endogenous complex. Cu2+ alone has no affinity for the GABA recognition site but antagonizes the anticonvulsant effect of diazepam. Therefore, Cu2+ is suggested to be the pharmacologically active principle of the endogenous substance. Cu2+ does not seem to function via the recognition site of the GABA receptor.", 
    "32": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a neuropeptide present in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). In all species studied so far, the highest concentrations of this neuropeptide have been found in the cerebral cortex, the amygdala and the hippocampus. Five molecular forms of CCK having 39, 33, 13, 8 and 4 amino acid residues have been identified in the CNS, the sulphated octapeptide (CCK8) being the most abundant form detected. Specific CCK binding sites have been demonstrated in the rat, guinea pig and human brain. CCK8, applied by microiontophoresis to deep cortical neurones and hippocampal pyramidal neurones, has a powerful excitatory effect, whereas the non-sulphated CCK octapeptide has no such effect on these neurones. Low doses of benzodiazepines depress the spontaneous activity of hippocampal pyramidal neurones. We report here that benzodiazepines at very low doses antagonize selectively the CCK8-induced activation of rat hippocampal pyramidal neurones. This antagonistic action might be involved in the anxiolytic effect of these drugs.", 
    "33": "Using [3H] diazepam as ligand, it is possible to distinguish neuronal binding sites from those present on glial elements and in peripheral tissues (non-neuronal). The function of the \"non-neuronal\" binding sites is still obscure. Preliminary data showed a distribution of [3H] diazepam binding sites in kidney that could suggest a localization along the renal tubules. This is the site at which a renal peptide, arginine-vasopressin (AVP) is supposed to act. In an attempt to examine the function of these \"non-neuronal\" sites, we studied the [3H] diazepam binding in kidney of Brattleboro rats which lack AVP and present the symptoms of diabetes insipidus. The homozygous Brattleboro rats showed an increase in the apparent number of benzodiazepine binding sites (Bmax) compared to Long-Evans control rats. Replacement of AVP in these animals results in a reversal of the electrolyte alterations of diabetes insipidus and in an increase of the affinity of the [3H] diazepam binding. These findings may indicate a possible relationship between benzodiazepine binding sites and vasopressin action in kidney and may support receptor function of these \"non-neuronal\" binding sites.", 
    "34": "Clonidine, an alpha-2-adrenergic agonist, significantly reduces opiate withdrawal. Fifteen heavy smokers abstained from cigarettes on three separate occasions and received instead clonidine, placebo, or the benzodiazepine alprazolam. Clonidine and alprazolam diminished withdrawal symptoms. The two drugs suppressed anxiety, tension, irritability, and restlessness equally but clonidine had a greater effect than alprazolam on cigarette craving. These observations suggest that noradrenergic activity is a common feature in the pathophysiology of withdrawal and that a special relationship exists between central noradrenergic activity and craving.", 
    "35": "The benzodiazepine-gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor complex was used to study functional receptor synthesis and degradation in primary cultures of neurons. Fifty percent of the receptors turned over with an unusually rapid half-life (4 hours); this was followed by a second, slower phase (32 hours). These results provide the basis for elucidating the mechanism by which neurons derived from the central nervous system control neurotransmitter receptor number, an important problem in cellular neurobiology. The findings may be of significance in the study of neurological and psychiatric disorders.", 
    "36": "Five milligrams of intravenous diazepam given prior to contrast media injection statistically significantly reduced the incidence of contrast media-associated seizures from 16% to 2% in a prospective, randomized series of glioma patients. Factors related to increased risk of contrast media-associated seizures are (1) prior seizure history due to glioma and/or prior contrast media and (2) prior or concurrent brain antineoplastic therapy. Factors not related to an increased risk of contrast media-associated seizures are (1) contrast media dosage, (2) type or grade of glioma, and (3) computerized tomographic appearance of the glioma. Theories regarding the etiology of contrast media-associated seizures are discussed.", 
    "37": "The cage convulsant [35S]tert-butylbicyclophosphorothionate [( 35S]TBPS) labels a presumed sedative-convulsant receptor complex. The relative potencies of barbiturates in competing for [35S]TBPS binding parallels their potencies in enhancing benzodiazepine receptor binding. Barbiturates inhibit [35S]TBPS binding in a complex, mixed competitive fashion, leading to a decrease in both the apparent affinity of TBPS for its sites and the apparent number of TBPS sites. All of the barbiturates examined markedly accelerate the dissociation of [35S]TBPS from its recognition sites, while picrotoxinin does not affect the dissociation. These results suggest that the barbiturate and picrotoxinin/TBPS recognition sites are distinct but allosterically linked.", 
    "38": "The high affinity binding of [3H]flunitrazepam (FNZP) to crude membrane preparations was examined in human pineal glands. Scatchard analysis of the data at equilibrium revealed a single population of binding sites with dissociation constant = 2.36-2.53 nM and binding site concentration = 59-108 fmol/mg protein. When various benzodiazepine (BZP) analogues were tested for their ability to inhibit [3H]FNZP binding the following Ki (nM) were found: clonazepam (0.13), RO 15-1788 (0.60), FNZP (2.14), diazepam (13.5), Ro 5-4864 (greater than 10 000). In both human pineal gland and cerebral cortex 10-100 microM gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) increased BZP binding by about 30%, an effect inhibited by the GABA receptor blocker bicuculline. The stimulatory effect of GABA on [3H]FNZP binding in rat cerebral cortex (about 60%) decreased as a function of time elapsed postmortem at room temperature to reach values similar to those observed in human brains. These results suggest the existence of central type BZP receptors in the human pineal glands.", 
    "39": "Raubasine produced a dose-related inhibition of specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding to rat brain membranes. Scatchard analyses revealed a significant increase in the affinity constant but no change in the number of binding sites, suggesting that raubasine acts as a competitive inhibitor. Raubasine also inhibited the in vivo binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to mouse brain sites. Behavioral studies showed raubasine to possess anticonvulsant properties against pentylenetetrazol- and bicuculline-induced convulsions in mice. These effects were inhibited by the benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788. The results suggest that raubasine interacts directly at benzodiazepine sites with a benzodiazepine agonist-type activity.", 
    "40": "Tolerance to alprazolam-induced neurologic deficits was assessed in mice by a rotarod test. Tolerance was found following a second administration of 2 mg/kg alprazolam 24 h after the first dose and it decayed gradually over a period of several weeks. Brain and plasma concentrations of alprazolam indicated that this tolerance was functional.", 
    "41": "Binding studies conducted on membrane preparation from human platelets using (3H) Ro5-4864 and (3H) diazepam showed specific and saturable binding. Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of binding sites with KD = 10.8 +/- 0.9 nM and Bmax = 775 +/- 105 fmol/mg protein for (3H) Ro5-4864 and KD = 10.5 +/- 1.1 nM and Bmax = 133 +/- 19 fmol/mg for (3H) diazepam. We were unable to detect any GABA binding site on crude membrane preparation, nor did GABA enhance the binding of (3H) Ro5-4864 or (3H) diazepam. This suggests that benzodiazepine receptors are uncoupled to GABA system on human platelets. Ro15-1788, a specific antagonist for \"central type\" benzodiazepine (BDZ) binding sites was inactive in displacing (3H) Ro5-4864 from membrane receptors, while PK 11195 (a specific ligand for the \"peripheral type\" receptor) was the most potent of the drugs tested in inhibiting (3H) Ro5-4864 binding. These results indicate that human blood platelets bear \"peripheral-type\" BDZ receptor. Moreover, we could not detect any (3H) propyl beta carboline specific binding on platelet membranes. Results on benzodiazepine receptors on human circulating lymphocytes are also reported and similarity in pharmacological properties with platelet benzodiazepine receptors is suggested.", 
    "42": "Current literature on suicide attempts by children and adolescents is reviewed. The records of children and adolescents in the 10-15-year age group who were referred to a child psychiatric unit over the 6-year period 1 January 1977-31 December 1982 were analysed. The results are presented and discussed. Suicide attempts or threats together constituted an average of 10% of the psychiatric referrals in this age group, the figure for 1982 being substantially increased. The peak incidence was among 13-year-olds for both boys and girls. The female: male referral ratio was 2:1. Drug overdosage was the most common method, the commonly employed drugs being analgesics and benzodiazepines. In about 30% of both the boys and girls referred because of taking an overdose, a multiple-drug overdose had been used. Methods other than this were used three times more frequently by boys than by girls. Major predisposing and antecedent factors were family stress (especially divorce), psychiatric illness in the patient or a family member, and school problems. Some 30% had previously made suicide attempts or threats, and at least 7% made further serious suicide attempts after initial treatment. These results suggest a need for further investigations into factors relating to suicide attempts or threats in children and adolescents and their subsequent management.", 
    "43": "Twenty subjects, 13 female and 7 male, aged 16 to 37 years, were studied to determine the effects on memory of intravenous sedation with diazepam (Valium). Three tests were performed: 1) the Weschler Logical Memory Scale; 2) memory of three geometric shapes; and 3) memory of three objects presented in a drawing. Logical memory items were presented before and after sedation; other tests were presented after sedation. Anterograde amnesia was produced by diazepam sedation. No retrograde amnesia was observed. A significant drug effect was found between the pre-drug and post-drug retention intervals (T+ = 2; P less than 0.005). Post-drug recognition scores were found to be approximately 42% of pre-drug recognition scores. The anterograde amnesia produced with diazepam was probably due to decreased arousal of the subject, and decreased attention to rehearsal of short-term memory stimuli, resulting in a lack of storage of the stimuli.", 
    "44": "Two cholinergic antagonists, gallamine and pirenzepine, agents that have been shown to bind selectively to different subpopulations of the muscarinic receptor, were found to antagonize selectively and differentially the amplitudes of the slow-inhibitory and slow-excitatory postsynaptic potentials in the superior cervical ganglion of the rabbit. Incubation of ganglia with gallamine resulted in a concentration-dependent suppression of the slow-inhibitory postsynaptic potential. The pharmacological action of gallamine was highly specific. At concentrations which reduced the amplitude of the slow-inhibitory postsynaptic potential by as much as 70-90%, there was no reduction of the amplitudes of the muscarinic slow-excitatory postsynaptic potential, the nicotinic fast-excitatory postsynaptic potential, noncholinergic slow-slow-excitatory postsynaptic potential, or post-stimulus hyperpolarizing afterpotentials. The amplitude of the slow-excitatory postsynaptic potential was actually facilitated in the presence of gallamine, presumably as a result of suppression of the overlapping slow-inhibitory postsynaptic potential. In contrast to the action of gallamine, pirenzepine produced a selective suppression of the amplitude of the slow-excitatory postsynaptic potential. Pirenzepine had very little influence on the amplitude of the slow-inhibitory postsynaptic potential at concentrations sufficient to reduce the amplitude of the slow-excitatory postsynaptic potential by as much as 50%, and had no effect on the amplitudes of the nicotinic fast-excitatory postsynaptic potential or noncholinergic slow-slow-excitatory postsynaptic potential. The evidence presented suggests that multiple muscarinic recognition sites, previously identified by studies of the affinities of pharmacological agents for the muscarinic receptor, may actually be involved in synaptic transmission and functionally coupled to cellular effector mechanisms.", 
    "45": "It was hypothesized that diazepam (DZP) would attenuate the analgesia produced by cold swim stress because of its anxiolytic and biochemical anti-stress properties. In fact, it had the opposite effect. Administered alone, neither DZP nor its vehicle affected the nociceptive thresholds of rats, as assessed by a flinch-jump test. In combination with cold swim stress, DZP elevated nociceptive thresholds significantly more than did the stressor alone. This was true whether DZP was injected before or after exposure to the stressor, or whether or not DZP administration was acute or chronic.", 
    "46": "Administration of a benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide (CDP), prior to exposure to inescapable shock prevented both the long-term analgesia and the shuttle-escape deficit typically observed following inescapable shock. If given only prior to testing, CDP had little effect. The protective effects of CDP were determined not to be a result of state dependency or a general facilitatory effect of the drug on escape performance. It is suggested that the induction of anxiety or fear by inescapable shock is critical in mobilizing endogenous changes such as transmitter depletion which are thought to be responsible for the deficits observed.", 
    "47": "Three 6-week-old male purebred yellow Labrador Retrievers were presented with intermittent stimulus-sensitive contractions of the appendicular and axial muscles. Five littermates were normal, although the grandsire of the affected litter had sired 2 previous litters containing similarly affected pup. Although alert and responsive, the affected dogs appeared decerebrate with extensor rigidity and opisthotonus during handling. During severe episodes, respiratory distress was observed. Generalized contractions were initiated by voluntary movements, but at rest the muscles relaxed. Neurologic deficits were not detected, although efforts to elicit segmental reflexes, assess muscle tone, or assist walking resulted in generalized stiffness. Electromyograms from the semitendinous muscles (musculi semitendinosus) had increased motor unit amplitude (up to 5,000 microV) with polyphasic action potentials. There were no myotonic discharges. A reduced interference pattern was seen. A single tactile stimuli of the distal limb resulted in 3 responses, each lasting less than or equal to 10 ms at latencies of 0 to 12 ms, 20 to 30 ms, and 35 to 40 ms, characteristic for reflex myoclonus. The motor nerve conduction velocities were normal for age (32 to 35 ms). Age-matched control dogs had motor unit action potentials of 100 to 200 microV and single compound motor unit discharges to single tactile stimuli. Therapeutic trials with diazepam and clonazepam produced minimal effects on the muscle contractions. Values of urinalyses, complete blood cell counts, and serum chemistries were within normal limits. Frozen muscle section biopsy findings, including enzyme histochemical assessment of muscle fiber types, were normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "48": "24 deep toxic comas with respiratory assistance were studied by brain-stem reflex and BAEP. Laboratory analysis showed several simultaneous toxics (phenobarbital, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants...). Three groups of patients were defined: Twelve patients with normal BAEP and with relatively preserved brain-stem reflex (oculocephalic and oculovestibular are often disturbed but photomotor is present). Eleven patients with delayed BAEP and with more disturbed brain-stem reflex (photomotor is missing 3 times). In 2 cases (one of which is mentioned above in group B) brain-stem reflex and BAEP disappear and these patients die. Cerebral anoxia is associated here with toxics. Causes of delayed latencies (group B) are discussed (hypothermia, toxics). BAEP seems important in diagnosis and prognosis of toxic coma.", 
    "49": "Administered intravenously in decerebrate cats nitrazepam or diazepam (0.0625 to 0.5 mg/kg) produced dose-related inhibition of the ipsilateral extensor reflex. Nitrazepam (0.25 mg/kg i.v.) produced a significantly greater (P less than 0.001) inhibition than that produced by diazepam (0.25 mg/kg i.v.). Nitrazepam or diazepam (0.0625-4 mg/kg i.v.) had no effect on the contractions of directly stimulated (120 V, 5 msec, 0.1 Hz) quadriceps femoris muscle and on the contractions of tibialis anterior muscle produced by stimulating the cut peripheral end of the lateral popliteal nerve (8 V, 1.5 msec, 0.1 Hz). Nitrazepam or diazepam (0.125-0.5 mg/kg i.v.) produced dose-related depressor responses in cats anaesthetized with chloralose or pentobarbitone. Nitrazepam produced a depressor response at 0.0625 mg/kg dose while diazepam did not. The drugs did not appear to have any deleterious effect on the veins removed 6 hr after the first exposure to the drugs as evidenced by lack of histological changes. It is concluded that nitrazepam and diazepam produce central muscle relaxation by inhibiting polysynaptic pathways in the spinal cord. The potency of nitrazepam appears to be greater than that of diazepam. Definitive evidence has been provided that the peripheral neuromuscular or direct muscular actions are not involved in the muscular relaxation produced by the two drugs.", 
    "50": "We have found earlier that a number of antidepressant drugs, administered repeatedly, prevent the salbutamol-induced hypoactivity in rats. Our further experiments show that a similar effect is produced by repeated, but not acute, treatment with other antidepressants: clomipramine, mianserin and nialamide. Two non-antidepressant psychotropic drugs, haloperidol and diazepam, were inactive after repeated administration. These results seem to support our earlier hypothesis that prevention of the salbutamol-induced hypoactivity may be regarded as functional evidence at the behavioral level for the subsitivity of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "51": "The metabolism of clonazepam was studied in vitro and in vivo using germ-free and ex-germ-free rats. Incubation of clonazepam with rat-intestinal lumen contents gave nearly complete reduction of clonazepam to 7-aminoclonazepam. Rat-hepatic microsomes also reduced clonazepam but only under anaerobic conditions. Aerobic microsomal incubations gave 3-hydroxyclonazepam as the predominant metabolite. Both aerobic and anaerobic microsomal metabolism were induced by phenobarbital. Carbamazepine pretreatment significantly induced only 3-hydroxylation slightly; whereas beta-naphthoflavone had no significant effect. Extensive biliary disposition of hydroxylated clonazepam metabolites into the gut occurred. Only very low levels of clonazepam were found in bile. Using a linked-rat procedure enterohepatic recirculation of biliary metabolites was demonstrated and suppression (antibiotic treatment) or absence (germ-free) of the gut microflora nearly eliminated recycling. Following oral administration of [14C]clonazepam to germ-free rats, reduced metabolites accounted for 15% of the radioactivity in the urine, with over 70% of the 14C attributed to a phenolic clonazepam metabolite. In contrast 77% of the recovered metabolites were derived from nitroreduction in the same animals following acquisition of an intestinal microflora; 7-acetamidoclonazepam was the major metabolite in these ex-germ-free animals. These studies show that clonazepam metabolism is primarily reductive in the presence of gut flora and oxidative in its absence.", 
    "52": "Young epileptic women frequently question their physicians concerning appropriate contraception for them, the effects of pregnancy on epilepsy, and the effects of the disease on the fetus. In 1/2 of cases the frequency of epileptic crises is unaffected by pregnancy, in 1/4 it is augmented and in 1/4 it is decreased. An increase in crises may be caused by psychological factors or by changing the treatment to avoid injuring the fetus. Recent studies show that the plasma level of the medications tends to decline during pregnancy and to increase postpartum. During the past decade several cases of pregnancy in young women taking oral contraceptives (OCs) and antiepileptic drugs have been observed. The inactivation of OCs, which occurs with all antiepileptics except sodium valproate and the benzodiazepines, appears to be due to a mechanism of enzymatic induction. Most cases of pregnancy were in women using sequential pills with 50 mcg or less of ethinyl estradiol. (EE) Sodium valproate can be prescribed for women with primary epilepsy, but in cases of incompletely controlled epilepsy or those requiring various drugs, it is better not to modify a successful regimen. Another method of contraception such as the IUD can be prescribed, or possibly a higher dose formulation of OC can be selected. The vascular risk of a stronger dose of contraceptive steroids should be weighed, but it may be that the process of enzymatic induction maintains a level of EE comparable to that of the minipill. If combined OCs are used, the appearance of metrorrhagia should be noted and the temperature shift should be recorded for the 1st months of treatment to guard against possible failure to inhibit ovulation. The teratogenic risk of antiepileptic medications has not been entirely evaluated, but diphenylhydantoines have been shown experimentally to cause malformations in monkeys. Statistics indicate a doubled risk of malformation in the children of epileptic mothers treated during pregnancy. All antiepileptic drugs were found to be involved. In a personal series of 170 babies of treated epileptic mothers, there were 4 malformations and 1 fatal neonatal hemorrhage. It would be reasonable to assume that malformations result from the interaction of genetic factors related to the severity of the disease, maternal age at pregnancy, and medication used. The role of the anticonvulsants may possibly be explained by their effect on nucleic acid metabolism or by deficiencies of folic acid and vitamin K, which in turn may play a role in neonatal hemorrhage. In case of pregnancy, the patient should be reassured about the small risk of malformation. The smallest possible doses and, if possible, single drugs should be used. Injections of vitamin K for the mother before delivery and for the infant may prevent coagulation problems. The infant may have withdrawal symptoms for which replacement medication may be prescribed for a few weeks. Breastfeeding does not appear to be contraindicated.", 
    "53": "The present study determined whether oral flunitrazepam was effective reducing CNS toxicity of lidocaine and bupivacaine. Pretreatment of mice with flunitrazepam, 0.065-0.25 mg X kg-1, significantly reduced or prevented convulsions and mortality induced by lidocaine 106 and 209 mg X kg-1 or bupivacaine 58 and 90 mg X kg-1 injected intraperitoneally. The doses of flunitrazepam used did not cause measurable sedation in mice. The efficacy of oral flunitrazepam in preventing local anaesthetic-induced convulsions is similar to that previously reported by intraperitoneal or intramuscular injections in mice. Flunitrazepam could be useful for oral premedication of patients before regional anaesthesia.", 
    "54": "The effect of morphine, diazepam, N2O/O2 anesthesia on baroreflex control of heart rate in humans was investigated in this study. Group 1 subjects (n = 11) received morphine 0.5 mg/kg, diazepam 0.25 mg/kg, and 70% N2O with O2. Group 2 subjects (n = 10) received morphine 0.75 mg/kg, diazepam 0.25 mg/kg, and 70% N2O with O2. Phenylephrine (the pressor test), sodium nitroprusside (the depressor test), and graded neck suction were employed to alter the stimulation of baroreceptor sites. The pressor, the depressor, and neck suction baroreflex slopes declined significantly in both groups from awake to anesthetized. There was no significant difference in the degree of depression between the two groups for all three tests. Neck suction derived slopes compared favorably to the pressor test slopes (r = 0.70, P less than 0.01). This study indicates that the depression of arterial baroreflex-heart rate responses under morphine, diazepam, N2O/O2 anesthesia is similar to that seen with potent inhalational anesthetics such as isoflurane. Furthermore, there was no difference between the two morphine doses that were studied.", 
    "55": "Since both bupivacaine and diazepam are highly protein bound, it is possible that a drug displacement interaction could occur, resulting in an increase in free bupivacaine concentration that could exacerbate systemic toxicity. This study was undertaken to characterize the serum binding of diazepam and to evaluate any drug displacement interaction between diazepam and bupivacaine. Human serum obtained from venous blood of normal male and female volunteers was used for measurements of protein binding using an Amicon Micropartition System. Bupivacaine protein binding in the presence of 0, 0.5 and 1.5 microgram/ml diazepam was best described by the model for two classes of binding sites. Neither concentration of diazepam significantly altered the capacity or affinity for either class of bupivacaine binding sites when compared to control. Free concentrations of bupivacaine were statistically identical in the presence of both diazepam concentrations. The complete diazepam binding profile in both serum and isolated human serum albumin was best described by a model describing two classes of binding sites. The effect of an acidic pH on bupivacaine was also independent of diazepam concentration. Diazepam protein binding was not affected by a reduction in pH from 7.4 to 7.0. The data reported here suggest no binding displacement interaction exists between bupivacaine and concomitantly administered diazepam. Thus, administration of diazepam during a toxic reaction associated with bupivacaine should not alter free bupivacaine concentration.", 
    "56": "Ten nonobese, healthy elderly adults (M = 73.3 years) were monitored polygraphically during sleep for sleep state changes, breathing, and the development of cardiac arrhythmias. All participated in 2 baseline nights and 1 night of flurazepam 30 mg ingestion; six underwent 1 night of sleep deprivation; four received ethyl alcohol (.6 mg/kg); and four whose apnea worsened significantly with flurazepam 30 mg were pretreated for 3 days with acetazolamide, taking acetazolamide and flurazepam 30 mg on the fourth night. Elderly adults with an Apnea Index (the number of apneas per sleep hour) between 5 and 7 at baseline experienced a worsening of their apnea with each manipulation. Acetazolamide did not protect individuals whose Apnea Index increased after flurazepam ingestion. One person developed premature ventricular contractions in conjunction with an increased Apnea Index after each manipulation.", 
    "57": "Nonenzymatic glycosylation of proteins is common in diabetes mellitus and glycosylation of serum albumin in this condition has been described. To evaluate whether glycosylation of albumin affects acidic drug binding, sulfisoxazole and diazepam binding was examined in samples of normal serum incubated with glucose and in samples of serum from 42 patients with diabetes mellitus. Incubation of normal serum with 20mM glucose for several days resulted in progressive glycosylation of proteins, with decreased binding of sulfisoxazole (100 micrograms/ml) but not of diazepam (3 micrograms/ml). Free fractions of sulfisoxazole and diazepam were higher in serum from patients with diabetes. The percentage of free sulfisoxazole in serum from 10 normal subjects was 5.1% +/- 0.2%, whereas it was 16.0% +/- 1.3% in serum from 42 patients with diabetes with varying degrees of carbohydrate control. The percentage of free diazepam in plasma was 2.6% +/- 0.1% in the normal group and 3.6% +/- 0.4% in patients with diabetes. Decreased serum albumin levels, increased levels of free fatty acids, and glycosylation of plasma proteins seem to play a role in the defective acidic drug binding in diabetes. Elevated free fatty acid levels explain the abnormal binding of diazepam and the increased free fraction of sulfisoxazole is directly related to glycosylation of plasma proteins.", 
    "58": "Plasma ketamine concentrations after diazepam and placebo pretreatment were examined in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study. Eight healthy male subjects received either diazepam or a 0.9% NaCl placebo before ketamine and received the alternate combination 5 to 24 days later. Ten minutes before ketamine dosing, diazepam, 0.3 mg/kg, or placebo in equal volume was injected intravenously at a rate not exceeding 5 mg/min. Ketamine, 2.2 mg/kg iv, was injected over 1 min. For the clinically relevant period for anesthesia (1 to 30 min), diazepam-ketamine treatment resulted in higher plasma levels at most time points, but diazepam pretreatment did not alter plasma levels of metabolite KI and pseudometabolite KII nor the 24-hr urinary excretion of ketamine, KI, and KII. Ketamine kinetics followed a three-term exponential decline under both treatment conditions. After placebo-ketamine dosing, plasma t 1/2s were as follows: distribution (pi t 1/2) = 24.1 sec, redistribution (alpha t 1/2) = 4.68 min, and elimination (beta t 1/2) = 2.17 hr. After diazepam-ketamine dosing, t 1/2s were: pi t 1/2 = 25.0 sec, alpha t 1/2 6.37 min, and beta t 1/2 = 2.32 hr.", 
    "59": "Premedication with nalbuphine and morphine delayed gastric emptying in the period after operation, but oral diazepam did not. All three drugs delayed co-ordinated intestinal motility, although nalbuphine did so for less than half as long as morphine. This property of nalbuphine, if confirmed, could make it a valuable analgesic drug in the period after operation.", 
    "60": "The outcome of long-term benzodiazepine hypnotic therapy has been investigated in a group of elderly patients in the community; 220 receiving nitrazepam and 33 flurazepam. The estimated duration of therapy was as long as 15 years in some cases. More than half were taking doses greater than 5 mg and 15 mg, respectively, the majority on a regular nightly basis in accordance with the instructions on containers. The plasma concentrations of nitrazepam and the active desalkyl metabolite of flurazepam correlated positively with weight-related dose. In the case of desalkyl-flurazepam, but not nitrazepam, the levels were substantially higher than those previously reported in young individuals. There was sustained patient satisfaction with the effectiveness of the hypnotics and, despite the high plasma levels, little subjective or objective evidence of unwanted sedation, confusion or unsteadiness. The findings of the survey suggest the development of both pharmacodynamic tolerance to the unwanted sedative effects of these drugs and a degree of dependence in long-term recipients.", 
    "61": "The authors conducted a double-blind crossover study to determine the effects of physostigmine salicylate on hyperoxic ventilatory response to carbon dioxide (VE RCO2) and on awareness in healthy subjects previously sedated with diazepam. Diazepam 0.4 mg/kg iv decreased the slope of VE RCO2 from 2.41 +/- 0.19 to 1.30 +/- 0.15 1 . min-1 . mmHg-1 (mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.001). Subsequent injection of physostigmine 2.0 mg iv was associated with a 0.20 +/- 0.28 1 . min-1 . mmHg-1 decrease in slope; this was significantly different from the 0.56 +/- 0.22 1 . min-1 . mmHg-1 increase in slope associated with saline placebo (P less than 0.05). Level of consciousness, on the other hand, increased more after physostigmine than after saline (P less than 0.01). The authors conclude that despite an apparent increase in awareness resulting from physostigmine administration, the accompanying decrease in ventilatory drive may contraindicate its use in patients who previously have received diazepam.", 
    "62": "Each of six healthy volunteers was studied on three different occasions to determine the interactions of placebo-physostigmine, diazepam-physostigmine, and morphine-physostigmine with respect to respiration and psychomotor function. Respiratory measurements were made using the steady state and isohypercapnic techniques. Psychomotor function was assessed by the Trieger Dot Test (TDT) and compared with the Continuous Performance Test (CPT). Administration of physostigmine alone (3 mg, iv) did not affect ventilation. Diazepam (0.29 mg/kg, iv) did not cause a significant depression of ventilation in all subjects, although psychomotor function was impaired as measured by the CPT. The latter was unaffected by physostigmine. Administration of morphine (0.21 mg/kg, iv) caused a significant decrease in ventilation that was not antagonized by physostigmine. Morphine did not impair psychomotor function. The authors conclude that physostigmine is an ineffective antagonist of narcotic-induced respiratory depression and that the CPT correlates well with the TDT.", 
    "63": "The authors present the results of a controlled observation of withdrawal reactions accompanying cessation of desmethyldiazepam (clorazepate) therapy. The two subjects studied had had generalized anxiety disorder for several years; both were free from manifestations of other forms of psychopathology or addictive behavior patterns. Both patients maintained stable patterns of clorazepate use at modest doses for extended periods of time. The findings suggest that the long plasma half-life of clorazepate does not offer unique protection from withdrawal reactions associated with long-term therapy. Manifestations of these withdrawal reactions are indistinguishable from reactions associated with other benzodiazepine compounds.", 
    "64": "Suriclone (SC) is a new anxiolytic compound with a chemical structure different from that of benzodiazepines (BZD) but SC possesses a high affinity for the so-called BZD receptors. SC was tested in the naturally or the allylglycine-treated photosensitive baboon Papio papio. As active BZD administered by the intramuscular or oral route, this new compound possesses a marked protective effect against the excessive photosensitivity of the baboons, it blocks myoclonus following EEG spike and waves discharges induced by intermittent light stimulation; as BZD again, SC can induce spontaneous myoclonus not accompanied by EEG spike and wave discharges.", 
    "65": "In five healthy young men, pretreatment with the cholinergic muscarinic antagonist pirenzepine (0.6 mg/kg iv) almost completely abolished the rise in plasma growth hormone (GH) elicited by an iv bolus injection of 1 microgram/kg human pancreatic GH-releasing factor 1-40 (hp-GRF-40). These data demonstrate that cholinergic receptor sites involved in GH-releasing mechanisms do not interact with GRF-secreting structures in the central nervous system. A mechanism mediated via hypothalamic release of somatostatin or, alternatively, a direct pituitary site of action, can be postulated for the blocking effect of pirenzepine.", 
    "66": "One hundred alcoholics treated for ethanol withdrawal were assigned randomly according to a double-blind protocol to receive four intramuscular injections of 2 g of magnesium sulfate at 6-hr intervals or an equivalent amount of normal saline. All patients were treated for signs of withdrawal according to a standardized protocol using orally-administered chlordiazepoxide for sedation. Three observers rated each patient for signs of withdrawal. There was no statistically significant difference between magnesium sulfate and placebo groups on any of the variables measured. The groups required equivalent amounts of chlordiazepoxide for control of withdrawal. The authors concluded that the routine administration of magnesium sulfate is not indicated for the management of alcohol withdrawal unless accompanied by cardiac arrhythmias.", 
    "67": "The treatment of mixed anxiety/depression in general practice remains a problem. Non-psychiatrists find diagnosis difficult to make in these patients. A double-blind study was set up to explore this area and to investigate the efficacy of a tetracyclic antidepressant (mianserin) in the treatment of anxiety with or without mild and moderate depressive symptoms. The comparative drug used was diazepam. Benzodiazepines are used to treat patients with this presentation, often inappropriately. Forty-seven patients were treated for up to 8 weeks, 24 received diazepam 5-10 mg daily and 23 mianserin 30-60 mg daily. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured using computer-delivered rating scales. Mianserin was shown to be more effective than diazepam in treating symptoms of both depression and anxiety, with significantly more patients in the mianserin group reaching resolution of symptoms in the time period studied. Resolution occurred sooner with the antidepressant than with diazepam.", 
    "68": "A prospective study with mild general analgesia and sedation together with local anesthesia during bone marrow harvest was performed. Thirty-one patients underwent 33 bone marrow collections. Pretreatment consisted of 100 mg meperidine i.m. and 20 mg diazepam i.m. 1 h before start of procedure. Eight patients got additional meperidine and diazepam during the procedure, all patients got lidocaine 1% locally. A mean volume of 1.321 was obtained with 42.5 punctures. Twenty-two patients had no complications, 4 vomited, 4 had easily correctable hypotension of short duration, one got oxygen for cyanosis of short duration. Acceptance was good in 23 patients, in 6 reasonably well, in two bad. Only one patient experienced pain problems, due to suction. Anxiety was no major problem due to good information before the procedure and mild sedation. This form of anesthesia for bone marrow collection is a safe procedure, it is generally well accepted by the patient and it can be performed on an out-patient basis.",
