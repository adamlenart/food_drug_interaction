    "0": "The interaction of gallamine with muscarinic receptor subtypes was examined using radioligand binding studies. In competition studies using [3H]N-methylscopolamine [( 3H]NMS), gallamine displayed high affinity for the rat cardiac and guinea-pig uterine M2 muscarinic receptors and for the atypical muscarinic receptor present in chicken heart. Gallamine displayed low affinity for rat glandular and human 1321 N1 astrocytoma cell M3 receptors and also for the M4 receptors of NG108-15 and PC12 cells. The compound displayed intermediate affinity for M1 receptors of rat cortex labeled using [3H]pirenzepine. The interaction of gallamine with the M1 and M2 receptors appeared to be competitive at the low concentrations required to determine affinity estimates. Thus, gallamine inhibited the binding of [3H]pirenzepine to M1 receptors and [3H]NMS to M2 receptors at concentrations that were 263- and 23-fold lower, respectively, than those required to decrease radioligand dissociation kinetics. Furthermore, gallamine, at a concentration that inhibited between 63 and 71% of specific radioligand binding, had no effect on the observed rate of association of the radioligand with either the M1 or the M2 receptor. At the M3 glandular receptor, there was little separation between the concentrations of gallamine that produced inhibition of binding and those that decreased the association and dissociation rates of [3H]NMS. It is therefore difficult to determine if the inhibition of binding seen in competition studies on the M3 receptor was produced through a competitive or an allosteric mechanism. Despite its possible allosteric properties at the M3 receptor, gallamine can be used to detect heterogeneity of muscarinic receptor subtypes in several tissues and therefore represents a useful tool for defining muscarinic receptor subtypes.", 
    "1": "We used standard techniques of receptor autoradiography to study the distribution of inhibitory and excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter receptors in human normal cerebellar cortex. Benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor density was relatively high in both granule cell and molecular layers. GABAA receptor density was highest in granule cell layer with lower receptor density in molecular layer. There was a lower density of GABAB receptors than GABAA receptors in both molecular and granule cell layers with a relatively higher density of GABAB receptors in molecular layer than in granule cell layer. In granule cell layer, the density of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of excitatory amino acid receptors was greatest whereas in molecular layer the quisqualate (QA) receptor subtype density was greatest. With [3H]N-(1-[2-thienyl]cyclohexyl)3-4-piperidine as a ligand, there was no specific binding to the phencyclidine receptor. Molecular layer was also characterized by relatively high density of a non-NMDA/non-QA displaceable glutamate binding site. We studied also the cerebellar cortex of 4 cases of olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA), a syndrome in which Purkinje and granule cells degenerate. In these specimens, there was significant decrement of BDZ and GABAA receptors in both molecular and granule cell layers, with loss of GABAB receptors in molecular layer. NMDA receptors were depleted in granule cell layer while QA receptors and the non-NMDA/non-QA glutamate binding site were significantly depleted in molecular layer. Our normal human and OPCA data are largely consistent with animal data about the cellular localization of cerebellar cortical amino acid neurotransmitter receptors.", 
    "2": "Mammalian brain contains two types of benzodiazepine receptors namely the \"central-type\" receptor which forme part of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, and the so-called \"peripheral-type\" receptor found predominantly on mitocondrial membranes of astrocytes. Brain GABA-related benzodiazepine receptors are unchanged in hepatic encephalopathy. On the other hand, human and experimental hepatic encephalopathy are associated with increased densities of \"peripheral type\" benzodiazepine receptor. Results of several studies using agonists and antagonists of both types of benzodiazepine receptors are discussed in this review.", 
    "3": "The understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms of several neurological and psychiatric diseases has been derived from measurement of neurochemical parameters in autopsied brain tissue. In this report, the author reviews some neuropathological studies from autopsied patients died in hepatic coma. He mentions and analyze the findings in astrocytes, brain amino acid content, amines and their metabolites, brain enzymes activities, and affinity and density of GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex as well as muscarinic cholinergic receptor function.", 
    "4": "The effects of anesthetic induction by diazepam, flunitrazepam and midazolam on cardiac performance were evaluated in 33 ASA class I surgical patients (average age was 36 years). The patients were divided according to the 3 drug groups, and the effects of each drug assessed utilizing measurements of systolic time intervals. An increase in heart rate and decrease in blood pressure was observed following flunitrazepam and midazolam induction. There was no changes in PEPI (pre-ejection period index) and LVETI (left ventricular ejection time index) by benzodiazepines induction. The PEP/LVET ratio was increased by diazepam while the DPTI (diastolic pressure time index)/TTI (tension time index) was reduced by flunitrazepam and midazolam. However, these changes in PEP/LVET and DPTI/TTI were within normal limits. These data indicate that in healthy humans the induction dose of either diazepam, flunitrazepam or midazolam does not extremely influence either PEP/LVET for cardiac performance or DPTI/TTI for cardiac oxygen balance. The results also suggest that the simultaneous use of PEP/LVET and DPTI/TTI is more informative than any single variable for the evaluation of cardiac effects of anesthetics.", 
    "5": "1. The antinociceptive properties of the aqueous extract of the intoxicating beverage kava, and of the lipid soluble extract (kava resin) were tested in mice, by the tail immersion and abdominal constriction methods. Both extracts showed analgesic effects in both tests. 2. Eight purified pyrones from the lipid soluble extract were also tested for activity in the tail immersion test, and kawain, dihydrokawain, methysticin and dihydromethysticin were found to be very effective in producing analgesia. Using the tail immersion test the time course of action of the extracts of the four effective pyrones of kava were studied. 3. Naloxone, in doses which inhibited morphine-induced analgesia in both tests, was completely ineffective in reversing the antinociceptive activities of the kava extracts, showing that analgesia produced by kava occurs via non-opiate pathways.", 
    "6": "According to the literature, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the most effective treatment for lethal catatonia. This article describes a patient with lethal catatonia: treatment by ECT alone was ineffective, whereas continued treatment with ECT in combination with dantrolene sodium led to improvement.", 
    "7": "The present study was performed within the project 'Genomic Mutations' (sponsored by the Commission of the European Communities) in order to gather all possible experimental information on 10 chemicals selected on the basis of their possible capacity to induce aneuploidy. An analysis of chromosomal aberrations was carried out in bone marrow cells of mice with the first five chemicals: colchicine (COL), econazole (EZ), chloralhydrate (CH), hydroquinone (HQ) and diazepam (DIAZ). The experiments were performed in parallel to micronucleus tests with the objective to distinguish a positive micronucleus response due to chromosomal breakage from that obtained by lagging chromosomes. The results of the micronucleus tests will be reported elsewhere. COL, CH, EZ and DIAZ showed no clastogenic effects in mouse bone marrow cells after single intraperitoneal injection. Polyploid cells were significantly more frequent after COL treatment. HQ showed a dose-dependent induction of chromosomal aberrations at 6 and 24 h after treatment. After 24 h, cells with multiple aberrations up to complete chromosome fragmentation were frequently observed. They indicate that a small fraction of the cell population, probably related to a specific stage of the cell cycle, was particularly sensitive to HQ. A sex difference in clastogenic response to HQ was not observed. It is concluded that of the five chemicals tested only HQ was clastogenic in mouse bone marrow cells under the present experimental conditions.", 
    "8": "Thirteen newborn infants (five premature, eight full term) with severe seizures and not responding to phenobarbital and diazepam received a lidocaine (LD) infusion. The schedule was 4 mg/kg/h on the 1st day, 3 mg/kg/h on the 2nd day, 2 mg/kg/h on the 3rd day, and 1 mg/kg/h on the 4th day. The LD plasma levels were measured every 24 h just before decreasing the dose. The control of seizures was achieved in 11 of 13 patients, with plasma LD concentration ranging from 2.8 to 10.5 mg/L. The LD concentration was linearly correlated with the dose in each group. In the premature group, LD clearance was always smaller than in the full-term group. Although no side effects were observed on heart rate and blood pressure, it is suggested that the dose of LD be adjusted to maintain the LD concentrations between 3-6 mg/L.", 
    "9": "The pharmacological effects of a novel, selective muscarinic (M1) receptor agonist, AF102B (cis-2-methyl-spiro-(1,3-oxathiolane-5,3')-quinuclidine hydrochloride hemihydrate), on sympathetic nerve activity are described. Intravenous administration of AF102B (1 and 10 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent increase in cardiac sympathetic nerve activity accompanied by tachycardia in spinal-intact rats. In addition, AF102B (10 mg/kg) caused a marked increase in cardiac sympathetic nerve activity and heart rate in pithed rats. Pirenzepine (50 micrograms/kg) inhibited these sympathoexcitatory effects of AF102B (10 mg/kg) in pithed rats. These findings suggest that AF102B possesses a sympathoexcitatory action which is mediated by M1-receptors.", 
    "10": "Eighteen healthy volunteers of both sexes, aged 20-35 years, were tested in the morning after three nights of medication with brotizolam 0.25 mg, nitrazepam 5 mg or placebo on a monotonous simulated driving task. The effect measures were subsidiary auditory reaction time and time outside road. Measurements of self-rated alertness were carried out as well. No effects were demonstrated from treatments on either measure. Nitrazepam however tended to score worst on all measures, except time outside road which could not be analysed with respect to statistical significance because of an insufficient number of subjects leaving the road. Twelve of the subjects were also tested immediately after drug intake on the first night of each medication period. Reaction time decrement was observed in both active drugs conditions with no difference between the two. The other measures, however non-significant, pointed in the same direction with the greatest decrement for nitrazepam.", 
    "11": "The cardiovascular effects of two organophosphorus, paraoxon and soman, as well as of antidotes advocated in the treatment of these intoxications have been investigated using a computerized analysis of arterial blood pressure in conscious unrestrained rats. Intravenous administration of paraoxon as well as of soman produced a marked, sustained and dose-related increase in blood pressure associated with a bradycardia. Pyridostigmine, a quaternary carbamate, neither altered blood pressure nor heart rate. Benzodiaxepines, such as diazepam or loprazolam, and atropine induced a dose-dependent tachycardia while pralidoxime decreased heart rate. A complete therapeutic scheme including the intravenous administration of pyridostigmine 10 min. before a postpoisoning therapy made of pralidoxime, diazepam and atropine induced a transient tachycardia, which was followed, after a return to control values, by a second and more stable tachycardia concurrently to a slight hypertension. Postpoisoning therapy alone suppressed the pressor effect of soman within a few minutes after its administration. Afterwards, this therapy reduced the importance of the cardiovascular effects produced by soman. Pyridostigmine pretreatment decreased the protection afforded by postpoisoning therapy in soman-intoxicated rats. These results show that postpoisoning therapy with pralidoxime, diazepam and atropine has a noteworthy efficacy against cardiovascular manifestations of soman intoxications in the rat.", 
    "12": "1. The potential for a drug interaction between cyclosporin A and midazolam was investigated since both compounds appear to be metabolized by the same cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme. 2. In vitro evaluation of the binding of cyclosporin A to rat microsomal cytochrome P-450 indicated a Ks-value of 0.4 microM. In further studies with rat liver microsomes IC50-values of 6, 8 and 70 microM cyclosporin A were determined for the inhibition of the metabolism of midazolam to its alpha-OH-,4-OH- and di-OH-metabolites, respectively. 3. Comparative studies with human liver microsomes indicated IC50-values of approximately 300 microM for the formation of alpha-OH-midazolam and of 65 microM for the formation of 4-OH-midazolam. 4. The pharmacokinetics of a single intravenous dose of midazolam (0.075 mg kg-1) was studied in nine patients receiving cyclosporin A to prevent rejection of their transplanted kidneys. The average steady state blood concentrations of cyclosporin A, measured by r.i.a. using a specific monoclonal antibody, varied during a dosing interval between 175 and 600 ng ml-1. 5. In these patients the hepatic elimination of midazolam was characterized by a mean t1/2 (+/- s.d.) of 2.3 +/- 1.2 h and a plasma clearance (CL) of 414 +/- 95 ml min-1. These values were not different from those of normal human subjects (t1/2 = 1.5 to 4 h, CL = 350 to 700 ml min-1). 6. From the results of the in vitro experiments it is concluded that cyclosporin A may potentially inhibit drug metabolism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "We have previously shown with i.v. bolus studies that the elimination of propofol is much slower than previously reported. Now we have studied the implications of this for prolonged i.v. infusion of propofol in seven patients who received continuous infusions of propofol for up to 9 h. Values of elimination half-life ranged from 13.1 to 44.7 h, systemic clearance from 1.02 to 1.63 l h-1 and volume of distribution from 1390 to 3940 l and these were similar to those obtained with bolus administration. The large volume of distribution is consistent with the high octanol/blood partition coefficient, which was found to be 72.0. Despite the very long elimination half-life, blood propofol concentrations appeared to approach steady state within 20 min rather than the 4-5 half-lives normally expected. This is because for this drug, which displays multicompartment pharmacokinetics, the rate of initial rise of blood concentrations is governed primarily by the very short distribution half-life of the drug. Therefore, the long elimination half-life of propofol is probably of little significance in designing infusions regimens, but the lower systemic clearance should be taken into account to avoid unwanted accumulation.", 
    "14": "Rats were exposed for one week to increasing concentrations of ethanol in a liquid diet, and were then maintained for a further 4 weeks on a 10% ethanol diet. Ten weeks after return to normal diet they were trained in a learning task in which three out of nine holes were consistently rewarded. The ex-ethanol-treated rats were slower to complete the task during the first week, compared with their control group and the differences were most marked on days 3 and 4, which were the days of most rapid improvement. On day 4 the ex-ethanol-treated rats made significantly more errors at rewarded holes. In contrast, rats that had been treated for 4 weeks with chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg/day) and then trained 10 weeks later on days 2 and 3 made significantly fewer errors of reference memory, and on day 2 made significantly fewer errors of working memory, compared with their control group.", 
    "15": "Midazolam HCl (1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg of body weight) was administered IM to 6 Canada geese to determine a sedative dose that would allow positioning for radiologic examination. The effects of both test doses on cardiopulmonary function were evaluated at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 minutes after drug administration and were compared with 2 end-tidal isoflurane concentrations (1.5 and 2.5%). The 2.0 mg/kg dosage induced moderate sedation at 15 and 20 minutes; sedation was adequate for positioning the geese. Sedation induced by the 1.0 mg/kg dosage was inadequate. The effects of both test doses on blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature were not significantly different from each other and from baseline data. Respiratory rate increased significantly (P less than 0.05) at 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes with the 2.0 mg/kg dosage, and at 15 and 20 minutes with the 1.0 mg/kg dosage. Blood pressure and respiratory rate were significantly (P less than 0.05) decreased with isoflurane when compared with baseline data and the midazolam test doses. The results of this study indicate that midazolam at a dosage of 2.0 mg/kg induces adequate sedation with minimal cardiopulmonary changes, and, as an alternative to general anesthesia with isoflurane, provides a satisfactory level of restraint for radiography.", 
    "16": "Forty unpremedicated patients undergoing minor gynecological surgery were anesthetized with 1 mg ketamine and 0.1 mg midazolam per kg bodyweight, if necessary supplemented later with half the initial dose. All patients continued to breathe room air spontaneously with no ventilatory support. There were no incidents of airway obstruction and only 1 case of troublesome airway secretions. The arterial blood gas sample did not show any sign of respiratory depression, but in 11 cases paO2 was lower than normal, though acceptable. The median emergence time was 6 min. The side effects of ketamine were well controlled by midazolam, and patient acceptance of the technique was high. We consider that the technique may be suitable for short procedures under primitive conditions, for example after mass casualties, and that it can, if necessary, be applied by specially trained paramedics.", 
    "17": "Small decreases in serum potassium in a study of 200 pre-operative patients were demonstrated in those who had an increase in anxiety, as measured on a linear analogue anxiety scale, in the 24 hours before anaesthesia. The possible aetiology and implications of this change are discussed. The combination of temazepam and a pre-operative visit by the anaesthetist effectively reduced pre-anaesthetic anxiety in 60% of patients.", 
    "18": "Subacute (daily) administration of diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) to male swine (Yorkshire white) resulted in a 97% inhibition of cholinesterase and a decrease of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate [( 3H]QNB) binding sites in homogenates of striata by approximately 50% after 14 days. The maximal density of receptors (Bmax) decreased from 2.1 +/- 0.3 to 1.0 +/- 0.2 pmole/mg protein. There was no significant change in the dissociation constant (Kd) for [3H]QNB binding (control: 52.6 +/- 10.7 pM; 7-day: 57 +/- 2.8 pM). Carbachol displacement of [3H]QNB binding yielded data best fit by a two-binding site model. The dissociation constants were KiL = 115 +/- 62 microM (55 +/- 3%) and KiH = 1.8 +/- 0.7 microM (45 +/- 3%), respectively, for the low- and high-affinity states. Seven-Day treatment with DFP reduced the percentage of high-affinity receptors to 22 +/- 8.6%, but affected neither the low- nor the high-affinity Kd (100 +/- 20 and 2 +/- 0.6 microM). With the addition of Mg2+, striatal homogenates had low- and high-affinity receptors in the proportion of approximately 1 to 1. In the presence of Gpp(NH)p + Mg2+ the ratio of high- to low-affinity receptors was 3:1 in homogenates of control tissue (to 26 +/- 5%). This treatment had no effect on this ratio in homogenates of tissue from 7-day DFP-treated swine (3:1) since it was already 3:1. Pirenzepine displacement of [3H]QNB binding was best described by a two-binding site model, with Ki values of 38 +/- 14 and 201 +/- 78 nM, which represent 74 and 26% of the binding sites, respectively. The high affinity Kd value was unchanged following 7 days of DFP treatment (24 +/- 5 nM). There appears to be little change in the displacement curves for pirenzepine inhibition of [3H]QNB binding. This suggests that about 75% of the receptors are of the M1 subtype. Thus, subacute administration of DFP causes not only a decrease in the number of receptors, but also a change in the proportion of agonist affinity states which is related to the interaction of the guanine nucleotide binding protein and the muscarinic receptor.", 
    "19": "Several experiments examined the effects of cholinergic receptor antagonists on formation of memory in the chick. Scopolamine produced amnesia in chicks trained on a one-trial peck avoidance task in a dose-dependent manner. Pretraining injection of scopolamine produced amnesia that developed between 15 and 30 min after training, suggesting that scopolamine interferes with intermediate-term memory (ITM), previously described to be active during this time (Patterson, Alvarado, Warner, Bennett, & Rosenzweig, 1986). Pretraining injection of scopolamine or ouabain, an inhibitor of ATPase activity shown previously to inhibit formation of ITM, produced identical time courses of amnesia development, supporting the hypothesis that scopolamine interferes with ITM. Pirenzepine, an inhibitor of M1 muscarinic receptors, was effective in producing amnesia, whereas gallamine, an M2 receptor inhibitor, did not produce amnesia. These results suggest that M1, but not M2, receptors are involved in memory formation in the chick.", 
    "20": "The present experiment examined the disruptive capacity of a shock CS when Pavlovian training was completed prior to repeated daily treatment with diazepam (DZ). Two groups of rats were given 20 Pavlovian fear conditioning trials (two per day) to establish a light CS as a shock signal. Both groups were then trained for 15 daily sessions to bar press for food reinforcement. Before each session, one group was injected IP with 5 mg/kg DZ and the other with saline. All injections were discontinued after the last training session. Nine days later, the capacity of the CS to disrupt bar pressing was tested. The CS produced greater disruption of bar pressing for rats that had previously received chronic diazepam treatment. The results suggest that DZ discontinuation increases sensitivity to cues established as fear elicitors prior to initial administration of DZ.", 
    "21": "To determine the effect of fever on cell-mediated immunity, the preoptic area of male rats was cooled after either a sensitizing or a challenge injection of keyhole-limpet hemocyanin, and the delayed-type hypersensitivity inflammatory response was measured. Cooling the preoptic area for 5 days, starting shortly after the sensitizing injection of antigen, did not speed up the development of the capacity to respond to a challenge injection of antigen nor did it influence the magnitude of the resulting inflammatory response. In sensitized animals, however, cooling the preoptic area for 24 h, starting shortly after the challenge injection of antigen, raised core temperature to an average of 40 degrees C and decreased the magnitude of the inflammatory response by 25%, whereas heating the preoptic area caused a fall in core temperature to an average of 35 degrees C and increased the response by about 25%. There was, in fact, a moderate negative correlation (r = 0.85) between core temperature and the size of the inflammation. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of cooling the preoptic area could be blocked neither by adrenalectomy nor by diazepam (0.5 mg/kg body wt), a drug that suppresses most endocrine responses to stress. It is therefore suggested that the expression of delayed-type hypersensitivity is inhibited at elevated body temperatures and that fever may thus weaken the defenses of the host against infection.", 
    "22": "Midazolam hydrochloride is commonly used for dental or endoscopic procedures. Although generally consisted safe when given intramuscularly, intravenous administration is known to cause respiratory and cardiovascular depression. This report describes the first published case of cardiorespiratory arrest and death associated with intramuscular administration of midazolam. Information regarding midazolam use is reviewed to provide recommendation for safe administration.", 
    "23": "Diazepam 10 mg/2 mL iv was administered undiluted over five minutes to nine healthy men on two separate occasions. The infusion site was evaluated before and after each infusion by subject assessment of pain on a severity scale of zero (none) to ten (most). Blood samples were collected at 0, 5, 20, 30, 45, and 60 minutes, and periodically for 72 hours postinfusion. Diazepam plasma concentrations were determined by HPLC. Concentrations at five minutes (end of infusion) ranged from 0 to 889 ng/mL. Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was observed at 5 minutes for 10 treatments, at 20 minutes for 7 treatments, and at 30 minutes for 1 treatment. The observed Cmax ranged from 221 to 889 ng/mL. When time to reach peak plasma concentration (tmax) was 5 minutes, the Cmax was significantly greater than when tmax was 20 minutes (670 +/- 87 vs. 267 +/- 40 ng/mL, p less than 0.005). The area under the curve did not differ significantly between these two groups. The pain score at the end of infusion ranged from zero to five and was inversely related to the concentration at five minutes (r2 = 0.45, p = 0.002). The association between venous irritation, a low plasma concentration at the end of the infusion, and a delayed Cmax suggests that diazepam precipitated in the vein.", 
    "24": "The pharmacokinetic parameters of muscarinic cholinergic drugs after intravenous (IV) and oral administration to mice was determined with ex vivo (3H)-oxotremorine-M (3H-Oxt) binding to the brain. Oxotremorine had a long duration of action, and arecoline had a short one. There was a significant correlation between the ex vivo ED50 and the in vitro inhibition constants (Ki). Tremorine, a prodrug, inhibited ex vivo binding, but was relatively inactive in in vitro binding. The quaternary amines, methylscopolamine and oxotremorine-M, and the hydrophilic compound, pirenzepine, were relatively weak in inhibiting ex vivo binding because of their poor penetration of the blood-brain barrier. Oxotremorine and BM-5 were similarly bioavailable to the brain by the IV and the oral route. These results indicate that the pharmacokinetic profile of muscarinic cholinergic drugs can be determined with ex vivo (3H)-Oxt binding.", 
    "25": "Interracial differences in drug responsiveness can be accounted for, at least in part, by differences in drug disposition. To investigate whether reversible interactions with plasma constituents may be a contributing factor in such differences, the binding of a number of model drugs was studied in plasma obtained from healthy Caucasian and Chinese subjects (n = 8 in each group). The unbound fractions of drugs binding to sites I and II on albumin (warfarin, diazepam, and salicylic acid) were similar in the two groups, and there was no difference in the plasma albumin concentration. By contrast, the percentages of unbound diphenhydramine (26.40% +/- 6.46% versus 18.30% +/- 4.31, mean +/- SD) and propranolol (13.81% +/- 1.33% versus 11.68% +/- 2.37) were significantly (p less than 0.05) higher in Chinese subjects compared to Caucasians. A 30% difference was also observed in the nonlinear binding of disopyramide. These basic drugs interact with both alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin, and the lower binding was associated with a lower plasma concentration of the acute-phase reactant in Chinese subjects. Kinetic analysis of the disopyramide binding isotherm was also suggestive of reduced binding capacity with no change in binding affinity. The reason for the racial difference in the alpha 1-acid glycoprotein level is unknown; however, for drugs extensively bound to this glycoprotein the resulting difference in unbound fraction would be expected to have predictable pharmacokinetic consequences that may result in differences in responsiveness. Determination of plasma binding, especially of drugs interacting with alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, should therefore be an essential component of comparative studies in subjects of different races.", 
    "26": "In this prospective study, five patients who had repeatedly shown troublesome restless emergence agitation after each of 20 sessions of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) with a succinylcholine dose about .7 mg/kg showed no agitation after 15 ECT sessions in which the succinylcholine dose was increased to about 1.0 mg/kg. The probability that the pattern of response to higher succinylcholine dose resulted from random processes is less than .005. This provides evidence that patients predisposed to emergence agitation are sensitive to seizure-induced metabolic changes in skeletal muscle tissue and that the likelihood of emergence agitation rises with the ratio of skeletal muscle mass to succinylcholine dose. Because ECT-inducted serum lactate elevations are blocked by succinylcholine, emergence agitation might be essentially the same phenomenon as lactate-induced panic.", 
    "27": "The effects of CCK-receptor antagonists such as dibutyryl cyclic GMP (dbcGMP), L-364,718, and CR1409 on COOH-terminal octapeptide of CCK (CCK-8)-stimulated chief cell responses were examined using isolated guinea pig gastric chief cells. L-364,718 and CR1409 inhibited CCK-8-stimulated pepsinogen secretion over the same concentration range as they inhibited CCK-8-stimulated increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), respectively. Schild analysis of the CCK dose-response curve indicates that L-364,718 and CR1409 exert their inhibitory effects on CCK-8-stimulated chief cell responses in a competitive manner. By contrast, dbcGMP inhibited not only CCK-8- but also carbachol-stimulated pepsinogen secretion. Furthermore, dbcGMP inhibited CCK-8-stimulated pepsinogen secretion more potently than the increases in [Ca2+]i. These results suggest that L-364,718 and CR1409 act as CCK-receptor antagonists, but dbcGMP has another inhibitory effect on pepsinogen secretion in addition to the effect as a CCK-receptor antagonist in guinea pig gastric chief cells.", 
    "28": "The effects of alfentanil on the midazolam dose-response curve for hypnosis was studied with response to the verbal command as an end point in 95 patients. The analgesic effect of alfentanil was studied by measuring the threshold for pain caused by pressure on the trapezius muscle with the use of a dolorimeter in 21 patients. The study was randomized, double-blind, and performed on the unpremedicated patients with ASA physical status I or II. Alfentanil was found to reduce the midazolam ED50 value for the induction of anesthesia in a dose-dependent fashion. The smallest dose of alfentanil (3 micrograms/kg) that caused a marked shift of the midazolam dose-response curve to the left along the dose axis (from the ED50 of 270 micrograms/kg to the ED50 of 142 micrograms/kg, P less than 0.0005) represents approximately 2% of the alfentanil ED50 for induction of unconsciousness (130 micrograms/kg). Alfentanil (10 micrograms/kg) caused only a tendency for increase in the pain threshold, whereas a dose of 15 micrograms/kg significantly increased the pain threshold by 37% (P less than 0.05). The results demonstrate that alfentanil potentiates the hypnotic effect of midazolam in very small doses. The high potency of alfentanil in this respect, as compared to its analgesic potency, suggests a very specific mechanism of alfentanil-midazolam hypnotic interaction, one that most likely is based on a functional relationship between the GABA receptor-benzodiazepine receptor system and the opioid receptor system in mediation of hypnosis.", 
    "29": "The authors report a series of illustrative cases in which patients presented with sudden \"spells\" of anger with physical features that resembled panic attacks but lacked the affects of fear and anxiety. These spells or \"attacks\" of anger were experienced as uncharacteristic and were inappropriate to the situations in which they occurred. Since treatment of these attacks with antidepressants produced in each case marked improvements in behavior, the authors also formulate some hypotheses as to the nature of these episodes.", 
    "30": "The effect of anaesthesia on the rate of bone blood flow in the rabbit was studied. Two estimates of bone blood flow were performed, using 15 microns radioactively labelled microspheres, in three groups of rabbits. The first group was anaesthetised and the interval between the two estimates was 5 min. The second group was also anaesthetised but the interval between estimates was 60 min. The third group of rabbits was conscious and the interval between the two estimates was 4 h. In the first group, small uniform falls in whole bone blood flow were observed (mean change = -5%). In the second group, larger and less predictable reductions were observed (mean change = -24%). In the third group (conscious), little change was observed in whole bone blood flow during the 4-h experiment (mean change = +7%). It is concluded that substantial falls can occur in bone blood flow in the rabbit during a 1-h anaesthetic. If bone blood flow is to be monitored under anaesthesia, then the effect of the anaesthetic on bone blood flow must be accurately defined. In conscious rabbits, estimates of whole bone blood flow performed at an interval of 4 h under control conditions will give reproducible results.", 
    "31": "Saturation experiments with the muscarinic antagonist [3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS) indicated that cerebellar granule cells in primary culture possess a high density of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs): Bmax = 1.85 +/- 0.01 pmol/mg of protein at 10 days in culture; KD = 0.128 +/- 0.01 nM. The selective M1 antagonist pirenzepine displaced [3H]NMS binding with a low affinity (Ki = 273 +/- 13 nM), whereas the M2/M3 muscarinic antagonist 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide competed with [3H]NMS with Ki values in the nanomolar range, a result suggesting that some of the mAChRs on cerebellar granule cells belong to the M3 subtype. Methoctramine, which discriminates between M2 and M3 subtypes with high and low affinity, respectively, displayed a high and low affinity for [3H]NMS binding sites (Ki(H) = 31 +/- 5 nM; Ki(L) = 2,620 +/- 320 nM). These results provide the first demonstration that both M2 and M3 mAChR subtypes may be present on cultured cerebellar cells. In addition, complete death of neurons induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate (100 microM for 1 h) reduced by 85% the specific binding of [3H]NMS, a result indicating that most mAChRs were associated with neuronal components. Finally, the evolution of the density of mAChRs, labeled by [3H]NMS, correlated with the neuronal maturation during the in vitro development of these cells.", 
    "32": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites are not normally present in most cerebral tissues, but following neuronal damage, the cells involved in the ensuing gliosis show a marked expression of these sites. In a unilateral excitotoxic striatal lesion in the rat, we sought to determine whether the isoquinoline derivatives PK11195 and PK14105 bind to these sites in vivo and whether demonstration of these sites offers the potential of indirectly localising areas of neuronal damage. Binding was studied at several intervals after coinjection of [3H]PK11195 and [18F]PK14105 to determine the time courses of specific binding. Both compounds were rapidly extracted into all cerebral tissues, but in the absence of binding sites in nonlesioned tissues, this was followed by a rapid clearance of radioactivity. In lesioned areas, both [3H]PK11195 and [18F]PK14105 accumulated over the first 5 min followed by a much slower clearance of radioactivity, resulting in a \"specific signal.\" [3H]PK11195 binding peaked at 20-30 min postinjection, with radioactivity in the lesioned striatum being three times greater than in its contralateral homologue. The specific signal was present for at least 60 min. The maximal [18 F]PK14105-specific signal was of similar magnitude but peaked earlier and was retained for only 45 min. Specific signals with both ligands were also detected in regions remote from the primary lesion site, e.g., in the hippocampus and substantia nigra. Predosing animals with a large dose of PK11195 (3 mg/kg), sufficient to saturate peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites, abolished in vivo binding of both [3H]PK11195 and [18F]PK14105 to both primary- and remote-lesioned tissues. The specific signal with both ligands could be of sufficient magnitude and duration to make tomographic studies in humans feasible.",

In BRP (pH 2-9) 10 electrons are consumed in this process. The first step is suitable for the determination of 1 in Loprazolam tablets containing 1 or 2 mg. These tablets are on the pharmaceutical market in several European countries. The mechanism of the electrode process will be reported in the communication XXXIV.", 
    "34": "In an open, prospective, randomized, and hospital-based study, comprising 219 consecutive children, 169 were given intermittent prophylaxis for one year, receiving either diazepam or valproic acid after their first febrile convulsion. Children admitted on odd dates (n = 89) were given rectal diazepam in solution every 12 h, whenever the temperature was 38.5 degrees C or more. Children admitted on even dates (n = 80) were given valproic acid as suppositories at times of fever. Twenty-three children in the diazepam group had a recurrence within 1 year versus 14 in the valproic acid group. On an intention-to-treat basis the 12-month recurrence rates in the 2 groups were similar, 27% vs 20%. The latter is well below figures for untreated controls from Denmark (32%), suggesting that intermittent valproic acid at times of fever may be effective, but further studies are needed. The number of complex recurrences, however, were significantly higher in the valproic acid group than in the diazepam group. Parental non-compliance was a major problem, and in the 2 study groups only 5 and 12 children, respectively, with recurrences were treated adequately. Sixty-nine children receiving diazepam had side-effects vs 37 receiving valproic acid. None were serious.", 
    "35": "The intracellular free calcium concentration [Ca2+]i of rat medullary collecting tubules was calculated from microscope fluorescence measurements in single pieces of fura-2-loaded tubules superfused at 37 degrees C. When carbachol (10(-4)-10(-3) M) was added in the superfusate, a biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i was generally obtained, which included an early peak phase and a sustained plateau thereafter; sometimes, the peak phase was not apparent; the plateau was maintained as long as the agonist was applied. Several responses could be induced successively without a fall in responsiveness. From dose/response curves, K1/2 values of about 10(-5) M for carbachol and 10(-6) M for acetylcholine were obtained. The effects of the agonists were suppressed with 10(-4) M of atropine or pirenzepine, indicating the presence of muscarinic receptors of the M1 type. In the absence of external calcium, the peak phase of the response was preserved while the plateau phase was suppressed; thus, the peak involves the release of calcium stored in organelles, whereas the plateau involves the entry of external calcium through calcium channels which were voltage independent and insensitive to the usual calcium blockers.", 
    "36": "Thirty outpatients between the ages of 60 and 85 with DSM-III Major Depression entered an 8 week randomized, double-blind comparison of desipramine and adinazolam mesylate, a triazolobenzodiazepine derivative. Outcome was assessed on several measures including the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Montgomery-Asberg Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), the 35-item Self-Rating Symptom Scale, and Carroll Depression Scale. Patients in both groups demonstrated a highly significant decrease in average HDRS scores (p less than 0.001) over the course of the study. Adinazolam was associated with significantly greater reduction in average HDRS scores by the third day. Repeated measures analysis of variance showed a significantly greater reduction in HDRS scores for adinazolam over the course of the study. The study medications were associated with distinct patterns of adverse reactions. Desipramine more often produced dry mouth, constipation and nervousness, while adinazolam was more likely to cause drowsiness and lightheadedness. Three of these elderly patients, all of whom were taking desipramine reported at least one fall during the study. Adinazolam may be a promising agent in the treatment of depression in the elderly.", 
    "37": "In a double-blind placebo-controlled study, following a 1 week washout, 75 outpatients suffering from generalized anxiety disorder with severe insomnia as the target symptom were randomly assigned to 4 weeks of treatment with zopiclone 7.5 mg, triazolam 0.5 mg or placebo at bedtime. Zopiclone was significantly better than placebo on most sleep parameters. Triazolam tended to be superior to placebo, but its superiority was significant only on the sleep induction factor. Triazolam-treated patients presented significantly more day-time-interdose anxiety than zopiclone as assessed by the weekly HARS and Clinical Global Assessment of Anxiety. Although daytime-interdose anxiety was observed with both drugs, this treatment emergent symptom was more frequent and severe with triazolam. Side-effects were of a mild to moderate intensity for both zopiclone and triazolam; however, taste perversion frequently appeared with zopiclone. Although both drugs share similar pharmacological properties and bind to benzodiazepine receptors, they differ significantly with respect to side-effects and daytime anxiety.", 
    "38": "Zopiclone, a cyclopyrrolone with hypnotic properties was compared with temazepam and placebo in the treatment of insomnia. After a week's washout period, suitable subjects were allocated at random to zopiclone 7.5 mg or temazepam 20 mg or placebo for 2 weeks. Measurements of psychomotor function using the Leed's psychomotor tester and letter cancellation were carried out on day 0, 7 and 14. Sleep latency, duration of sleep and number of times waking during the night were recorded on a sleep diary filled by the subjects nightly. Forty-four subjects completed the trial, 15 taking zopiclone, 16 taking temazepam and 10 taking placebo. Both zopiclone and temazepam had significant hypnotic properties when compared to placebo. Zopiclone increased total sleep time in both weeks of the trial while temazepam increased sleep time in the first week only. There was no significant deterioration in psychomotor performance at the end of both weeks for zopiclone. Critical flicker fusion was significantly increased in subjects on temazepam. There were no abnormalities for both zopiclone and temazepam subjects in the blood picture, renal profile, liver function, urine and ECG before and after the study. Zopiclone is an effective hypnotic comparable to temazepam.", 
    "39": "The synthesis of pharmacologically active diazepam metabolites (oxazepam, 4-hydroxydiazepam, N-demethyldiazepam) in liver microsomes of intact and phenobarbital-, 3-methylcholanthrene- and dexamethasone-induced male and female Wistar rats as well as in a reconstituted system with isolated forms of cytochrome P-450 (P-450a, P-450b, P-450c, P-450d and P-450k according to the Ryan nomenclature) was studied. Marked sex-dependent differences in the rates of diazepam metabolism in liver microsomes of intact and induced animals were revealed. The changes in the spectrum of diazepam metabolites in liver microsomes of induced rats (as compared to control animals) were revealed. In a reconstituted system only phenobarbital-induced cytochromes P-450b and P-450k were found to be active participants of diazepam N-demethylation; none of the isoenzymes tested were shown to be involved in diazepam hydroxylation.", 
    "40": "The teratogenicity of nitrazepam, a benzodiazepine-type drug, was investigated in Sprague-Dawley rats. Nitrazepam was administered to pregnant females at levels of 100, 200 or 300 mg/kg in a single dose on one of gestation days 10-14. Fetuses were examined for external and skeletal malformations on day 20 of gestation. Nitrazepam was found to produce various types of malformations, i.e., exencephaly, cleft palate, micrognathia, short or kinky tail and limb reduction defects. The predominant malformation was limb reduction defects, which were produced at high frequency by treatment on day 12 or 13 of gestation. Microscopic examination of limb buds revealed hemorrhage and mesenchymal cell necrosis at 24 hours after nitrazepam treatment.", 
    "41": "We describe a method of treating the mild to moderate alcohol withdrawal state which has been used successfully for 10 years in over 7,000 cases. It is now the standard therapy at the largest dedicated alcoholic rehabilitation centre in Southern Africa. The technique uses analgesic (subanaesthetic) concentrations of nitrous oxide, which in most cases is administered on a single occasion for 20 minutes only. This results in the most rapid detoxification presently available, such that within an hour of the commencement of therapy the patient is so improved that they can eat the next ward meal. Provided the correct equipment and simple training is used this non-anaesthetic treatment is completely free of any serious side effects and the patient is at all times conscious and cooperative. Apart from this the amounts of sedative medication, such as benzodiazepines, are drastically reduced during detoxification. Because of the rapidity of the therapeutic response this technique is useful also as a screening test for assessing those patients requiring intensive therapy for the alcohol withdrawal state. There is evidence of the usefulness of analgesic nitrous oxide therapy for treating other addictive withdrawal states including opioid and nicotine.", 
    "42": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is emerging very clearly as a serotonin specific illness. The evidence for this comes from a variety of clinical sources. Firstly the efficacy of 5-HT uptake inhibitors, especially clomipramine, is consistent and strong. Secondly clomipramine has not merely been found to be effective against placebo in 9 placebo controlled studies, it is also found to be more effective in some studies than reference tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. In other studies tricyclic antidepressants do not appear to be better than placebo. The lack of efficacy of general antidepressants, neuroleptics and benzodiazepines supports the specificity of the serotonin effect. Thirdly the evidence of the efficacy of clomipramine in OCD without concomitant depression reported by Montgomery 1980 and supported by other studies suggests that 5-HT uptake inhibitors have a specifically anti-obsessional effect. The lack of response of depressive symptoms in OCD to other antidepressants suggests that these depressive symptoms are integral to OCD and will only respond when the OCD is treated. Many of the studies found efficacy for 5-HT uptake inhibitors compared with placebo despite both groups being treated with concomitant behaviour therapy. This argues either for behaviour therapy being relatively ineffective or for there being a synergistic effect with the 5-HT uptake inhibitor which is more likely. Results from studies with selective serotonergic probes with a worsening of OCD symptoms in response to the 5-HT1A agonist, m-chlorophenyl piperazine, add support to the serotonergic hypothesis of OCD but further investigation is needed.", 
    "43": "The effect of some drugs on electric potentials of the retina has been described in the literature. Data on the effect of drugs of the group of benzodiazepines on electric potentials of the retina in man have not come to our attention. In the present study diazepam was found to affect substantially the studied parameters of the electroretinogram. An inhibitory effect of diazepam on the electric response of the retina was established. The period of latency and that of culmination of the electroretinogram were found to be most intensively affect.", 
    "44": "A method for the determination of lorazepam in rat brain is described using liquid/liquid and solid-phase extraction, followed by high performance liquid chromatography. After addition of chlordiazepoxide as the internal standard, 100 mg brain tissue was homogenized and incubated with alkaline protease. Lorazepam and chlordiazepoxide were extracted three times with toluene. After treatment through a C18-Bond Elut column, lorazepam and chlordiazepoxide were analyzed isocratically on a reversed-phase column with a mobile phase consisting of methanol +0.025 M sodium phosphate buffer (66:34, v/v). The eluted drugs were monitored by their absorption at 240 nm. The sensitivity limit of this method was 10 ng of lorazepam per 100 mg of brain tissue sample. The standard curve was linear over the range of 20 to 200 ng lorazepam. The coefficient of variation for day-to-day precision established by 21 replicate analyses was 4.5 to 13.6%.", 
    "45": "A 40-year-old man had an acute ischemic event affecting the pons. He had no cardiac illness or vasculities and was not diabetic or hypertensive. The contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan disclosed nothing abnormal, and a vertebral angiogram showed an avascular mass markedly displacing the basilar artery and pons posteriorly and toward the right. A magnetic resonance image clearly delineated a homogeneous arachnoid cyst containing cerebrospinal fluid. To avoid manipulating posterior fossa arteries, after the recent pontine stroke, this arachnoid cyst with unusually favorable anatomical landmarks was approached stereotactically through the vertex. Fenestration and drainage of the cyst was accomplished under local anesthesia and benzodiazepine sedation with low morbidity. The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient returned to gainful employment shortly afterward. He remains asymptomatic at 3 years' follow-up. The successful outcome of this case suggests that in carefully selected symptomatic arachnoid cysts, stereotactic interventions could become a useful surgical alternative. Stereotaxis may also be helpful in other cumbersome surgical cases in which a second port for contrast injection or simple manipulation would be advantageous.", 
    "46": "Two entities of special interest in sleep disorders medicine are restless legs syndrome and periodic movements of sleep. Most patients with restless legs syndrome have periodic movements of sleep, but most patients with the nocturnal disorder do not have restless legs when awake. In both conditions, the underlying cause is obscure, and the frequency of occurrence increases with advancing age. In most patients with restless legs syndrome, the results of complete blood cell counts and iron, ferritin, folate, and vitamin B12 levels are normal. No hematologic or chemical abnormalities have been reported in patients with periodic movements of sleep who do not also have restless legs syndrome. Various pharmacologic agents, including benzodiazepines, opiates, and levodopa, have been proposed for the treatment of both disorders. Although some patients respond to a single drug for long periods, in many patients tolerance develops and the efficacy diminishes. In such circumstances, a reasonable approach is to alternate chemically unrelated agents on a weekly or biweekly schedule. Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation may be beneficial.", 
    "47": "The purpose of this study was to compare the psychomotor recovery of patients sedated with either midazolam or Diazemuls using the digit symbol substitution test and the Trieger test. Sixty patients were allocated in random double-blind fashion to receive either midazolam or diazepam in oil emulsion (Diazemuls) as intravenous sedation for cataract surgery. Both groups received fentanyl 0.5 micrograms.kg-1 IV. Tests of cognition were performed by the patients prior to sedation and at half-hourly intervals for three hours after cataract surgery. In a dose ratio of 1:4, midazolam was found to produce better sedation but more prolonged recovery than Diazemuls. Anterograde amnesia was comparable in the two groups, while more patients in the Diazemuls group developed episodes of apnoea and venous irritation.", 
    "48": "A method is described for identifying and quantitating departures from additivity (i.e., synergism and antagonism) when drugs having like effects are given in combination. It is applicable for both graded and quantal (e.g., after probit or logit transformation) responses. Log(dose)-response curves of both drugs should be linear but need not be parallel. The following model is fitted to dose-response data for both the individual drugs and combinations of drugs: Y = beta 0 + beta 1 log(A + P.B + beta 4(A.P.B)1/2) where Y is the response, A is the amount of drug A, B is the amount of drug B, and P is a relative potency of the drugs given by log(P) = beta 2 + beta 3 log(B'), in which B' is the solution to B' - B - A/P = 0. If log(dose)-response curves of the two drugs are parallel, beta 3 = 0, and P becomes a constant parameter to be estimated. A positive value of beta 4 corresponds to synergism and a negative value to antagonism. Hypothesis tests may be carried out to determine whether beta 4 is significantly different from zero.", 
    "49": "Many studies have shown a relationship between fragmented nocturnal sleep and daytime sleepiness. In the current study, 11 patients, aged 55-75, were identified with fragmented nocturnal sleep secondary to periodic leg movements and objective daytime sleepiness as verified by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). In a double-blind, repeated measures, cross-over design, patients had three nights of treatment with placebo, 0.125 mg of triazolam, or 0.25 mg of triazolam following an adaptation night. Although total leg movements were not changed, the medication increased total sleep time and sleep efficiency while decreasing the number of stage changes. Generally, daytime performance and objective alertness were significantly improved following the use of triazolam. It was concluded that acute use of triazolam, particularly the 0.125 mg dose, could improve sleep and daytime function in older patients with periodic leg movements, fragmented sleep, and daytime sleepiness.", 
    "50": "It has been demonstrated that a gradual spontaneous recovery of a previously unreproducible memory trace and the prevention of the antiamnesic effect of the blockade of the GABAA receptor, but not of the blockade of the benzodiazepine receptor or the chloride channel, take place with the development of amnesia against the background of the activation of the GABAB receptor by baclofen. The \"neurochemical set\" created by the activation of the GABAA receptor by muscimol in a dose of 1 mg/kg prevents the antiamnesic effect of the blockade of any component of the benzodiazepine-GABA-ionophore complex, while at a dose of muscimol of 0.5 mg/kg, the retrieval of the amnestic trace takes place only by blockade of the benzodiazepine receptor. Thus, the development of amnesia is determined by the functional state of inhibitory GABAergic systems of the brain, which governs the subsequent correction of the amnestic memory trace.", 
    "51": "The data on the neuro- and psychotropic effects of exo- and endogenous derivatives of pyrimidine are systematized. Uridine is characterized as an endogenous anxiolytic and antidepressant and thimidine as uridine antagonist. The given properties are probably determined by the binding of pyrimidine nucleosides to GABA, benzodiazepine and imipramine receptors as well as by their influence on the neuromediator systems. The involvement of the system of endogenous pyrimidines in the development of psychoneurological disturbances in man is shown.", 
    "52": "In an experimental model of bleeding-induced hemorrhagic shock causing the death of all saline-treated rats within 30 min, the intravenous injection of ACTH-(1-24) at the dose of 160 micrograms/kg induced a sustained reversal of the shock condition, with almost complete recovery of blood pressure, pulse amplitude, respiratory rate, heart rate, and 100% survival, at least for the 2 h of observation. This effect of ACTH-(1-24) was prevented by the intracerebroventricular injection of 4-DAMP (a highly selective antagonist for M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors), but unaffected by the intracerebroventricular injection of pirenzepine (a highly selective antagonist for M1 muscarinic receptors). These data indicate that an essential step in the complex mechanism of the ACTH-induced shock reversal may be the activation of brain M3 muscarinic receptors.", 
    "53": "[3H]Flunitrazepam binding sites were analysed in the cerebellar cortex, deep cerebellar and vestibular nuclei of Purkinje cell deficit (pcd) mutant mice which have an almost complete postnatal loss of Purkinje cells, and weaver mutant mice, in which there is a postnatal degeneration of granule cells. Increases in [3H]flunitrazepam binding site densities were found in the molecular and granule cell layer of weaver mutant mice, whereas decreases were observed in pcd mutant mice when compared to wildtype 'control' mice. Apparently unaltered benzodiazepine receptor densities were found in the flocculus of pcd mutant mice, whereas increases were seen in the flocculus of weaver mutant mice. The densities of benzodiazepine binding sites in the medial and lateral deep cerebellar nuclei of both mutants significantly exceeded those in control mice. Significant increases in flunitrazepam binding sites were also found in the superior and spinal nucleus of the vestibular complex of pcd mice as compared to wildtype. In the weaver mutants the benzodiazepine receptor density is enhanced in the superior and medial vestibular nucleus. Apparently unaltered numbers of such receptors compared to the wildtype control group were found in the remaining vestibular nuclei of both mutants.", 
    "54": "Toluene, an aromatic solvent, prolongs the duration of nystagmus induced by a rotatory acceleration or by an optokinetic stimulation in the pigmented rat. Baclofen, an agonist of GABAB receptors, and 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]-pyridin-3-ol (THIP), an agonist of GABAA receptors are able to block this toluene effect on the vestibular system. On the contrary diazepam, which by itself causes an evident reduction of the duration of acceleratory nystagmus, is not able to block the toluene effect. The results indicate that the toluene effect is related to GABA transmission and that the solvent interacts by a rather receptor specific mechanism of action.", 
    "55": "1. The possible involvement of the benzodiazepine (BZD)-GABAA-receptor complex in mediating CNS stimulatory effects of fluoroquinolones was tested in vitro, in a binding inhibition assay and in vivo, in a clinical drug interaction study using electro-encephalogram (EEG) monitoring. 2. The specific binding of [3H]-flunitrazepam to rat synaptic brain membranes was inhibited by various fluoroquinolones in a concentration-dependent manner. 3. Ofloxacin had CNS-stimulating effects as revealed by the EEG which were slightly augmented by flumazenil but reversed by coadministration of midazolam. 4. In conclusion, our findings suggest that clinically observed CNS adverse effects of fluoroquinolones could be mediated at least in part through interaction with the BZD-GABAA-receptor complex and may be controlled by BZD agonist administration.", 
    "56": "1. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter affecting dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. This study compares properties of current activated by the GABAA receptor in two populations of DRG neurons. DRG neurons were isolated from adult rat with the use of enzymatic and mechanical means. Within hours of being isolated, neurons were recorded from with the use of the whole-cell variant of the patch-clamp technique. 2. One population of neurons exhibited an afterdepolarizing potential (ADP), a low threshold for action-potential generation (-45 to -50 mV), a short-duration action potential (less than 2 ms) that was abolished in the presence of 1-2 microM tetrodotoxin (TTX), and an insensitivity to 50 nM capsaicin. The second population of neurons exhibited a high threshold for action-potential generation (less than -40 mV), a shoulder on the falling phase of the action potential, insensitivity of action-potential generation to TTX (1-2 microM), and a depolarizing response to application of 50 nM capsaicin. 3. Sensitivity to GABA (over the range of 1-1,000 microM) was comparable for the two populations of neurons. 4. GABA-activated current was greater in ADP neurons than in non-ADP-type neurons of a comparable diameter (30-50 microns). The mean +/- SE amplitude of current activated by 10 microM GABA in ADP neurons was 0.310 +/- 0.050 nA (range = 0.110-0.460 nA, n = 8), and 0.037 +/- 0.016 nA (range = 0.010-0.130 pA, n = 7) in non-ADP neurons. Ten microM GABA elicited cell firing in ADP neurons but not in non-ADP neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "57": "This study characterized the role of GABA in the central medial intralaminar nucleus on seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol given systemically. Injections of the direct selective GABAA agonist, piperidine-4-sulfonic acid or the indirect GABAA agonists, flurazepam and pentobarbital, in this region depressed arousal and facilitated myoclonic and clonic seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol but only caused slight inhibition of tonic seizures. In contrast the GABAB agonist (-)baclofen facilitated all three types of seizures. Recording after injection of piperidine-4-sulfonic acid and (-)baclofen revealed marked suppression and slowing of thalamic and cortical electrical activity. Thalamic injections of the GABAA antagonist, bicuculline methiodide, had opposite behavioral effects, causing hyperactivity and episodes of violent running, not accompanied by EEG discharges. When pentylenetetrazol was infused concommitantly there was marked facilitation of the tonic seizures, which occurred without preceding myoclonic of clonic seizures, or EEG spikes. These results demonstrate that GABA-mediated neurotransmission in the central medial intralaminar nucleus can control the threshold of seizures and that GABA agonists and antagonists have opposite effects. It is suggested that the central medial intralaminar nucleus is not a site of origination or spread of seizures, but controls seizures indirectly by regulating the excitability of other structures and that different synaptic mechanisms and anatomical connections mediate effects on different types of seizures.", 
    "58": "Binding sites for t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) were detected in well-washed membranes from the brain of trout; gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) acted as an uncompetitive inhibitor of the binding of [35S]TBPS, decreasing both the number of binding sites and the affinity of TBPS. Inhibition of the binding of [35S]TBPS by deltamethrin, a Type II pyrethroid, was modulated by GABA; both the affinity and the efficacy of this insecticide increased with incremental concentrations of GABA. Deltamethrin also enhanced the potency of GABA as an inhibitor of the binding of [35S]TBPS. The interaction of 4'-chlorodiazepam (Ro5-4864) with [35S]TBPS was dependent on GABA: in the absence of GABA, Ro5-4864 inhibited up to 40% of the binding; in the presence of 10 microM GABA, Ro5-4864 enhanced binding to a maximum value of 170% of control. However, the same absolute amount of binding was observed with both of these effects at micromolar concentrations of Ro5-4864. Also, Ro5-4864 caused a rightward shift in GABA dose-response curves, increasing the IC50 value for GABA more than 6 fold. These results indicate the reciprocal allosteric interactions between a binding site for pyrethroids, a binding site for Ro5-4864, the GABA recognition moiety and the binding site for TBPS in the brain of trout. The similarity of these findings to previous results in preparations of rodent brain highlight the conservation of the modulation of GABAA receptor function during the evolution of vertebrates.", 
    "59": "The intracerebroventricular injection of ACTH1-24 (0.1-10 micrograms) produced a dose-dependent decrease of punished licking periods in the conflict test in rats. The same treatment failed to modify unpunished behavior. A similar effect was produced by alpha-MSH (0.25-5 micrograms), whereas ACTH4-10 and ACTH11-24 were ineffective in doses up to 10 micrograms. The proconflict effect of ACTH1-24 was completely antagonized by diazepam (1.5 mg/kg IP) and partially by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 (5 mg/kg IP). The results are in line with a possible \"anxiogenic\" action of ACTH1-24.", 
    "60": "The electrophysiological effects of Ro 15-4513 and FG 7142 alone and in combination with ethanol were investigated. Intraperitoneal administration of Ro 15-4513 (3, 6 mg/kg) was found to significantly increase power in the 6-16 Hz frequency range, an effect which was antagonized by ethanol (1 g/kg). FG 7142 administration (2, 5 mg/kg IP) was found to enhance spectral power in the 6-8 Hz range, an effect which was also blocked by coadministration of ethanol. Both drugs also produced dose-related abnormal EEG activity in the form of episodic bursts of EEG spiking. These ictal episodes, which lasted 5-40 seconds, were associated with an arrest of behavior but no overt behavioral convulsions. Coadministration of ethanol caused an elimination or significant reduction in these episodes. These studies suggest that Ro 15-4513 and FG 7142 have potent electrophysiological actions of their own which are partially antagonized by ethanol.", 
    "61": "In a light/dark choice procedure, the imidazothienodiazepinone RO 19-4603, given alone, induced a dose-dependent decrease in the time spent by mice in the lit box as well in the number of transitions between the two boxes. These data confirm the anxiogenic intrinsic properties of inverse agonists of the benzodiazepine receptor. Since RO 19-4603 also reversed the anxiolytic effects of ethanol and exhibited proconvulsant properties, it is suggested that the antagonistic action of this drug against ethanol could be due to an additive rather than an interactive process.",

Intravenous injection of [3H]flunitrazepam resulted in a tumor/cortex ratio of radioactive densities between 2.7 and 1.5 within the first 60 minutes after injection. [3H]PK 11195 demonstrated a higher tumor/cortex ratio (5.3) than [3H]flunitrazepam. For three-dimensional studies, images were generated from thionin-stained histological sections and autoradiograms. The mixed type benzodiazepine ligand [3H]flunitrazepam was superior in showing some of the normal anatomical structures surrounding the tumor, whereas [3H]PK 11195, a specific peripheral ligand, demonstrated higher tumor/brain contrast and superior topographical correlation between histological and autoradiographic images. Implications of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands for positron emission tomography are discussed.", 
    "63": "Immunocytochemical methods were used to reveal new details of the distribution and plasticity of GABAA receptors in the visual cortex of adult monkeys; the findings were compared with those of autoradiographic experiments involving the binding of 3H-muscimol and 3H-flunitrazepam. In both areas 17 and 18, a monoclonal antibody to the purified GABAA complex (deBlas et al., 1988) produced staining of punctate profiles in the neuropil and around cell bodies and large processes in layers I-VI. The receptor immunostaining was relatively intense in layers II-III, IVA, IVC beta, and VI; these alternated with lightly stained layers I, IVB, IVC alpha, and V. In area 18, the laminar pattern was similar except that layer IV was split into a superficial, lightly stained half and a deep, intensely stained half. In sections cut parallel to the pial surface, receptor distribution in most layers was found to be uniform. There were 3 exceptions in area 17: (1) patches of intense receptor staining were present in layers II and III; (2) a widely spaced, irregular lattice of intense staining was found in layer IVA; and (3) a much finer, regular lattice was present in layer IVC. The patches in layers II-III and the lattice in layer IVA coincided precisely with regions of intense cytochrome oxidase (CO) staining. The binding of 3H-muscimol and 3H-flunitrazepam revealed a laminar pattern that was similar in most respects, including greater ligand binding in layer IVA of area 17, but showed no evidence of the sublaminar organization in layers IVA and IVC beta. Inhomogeneities in receptor immunostaining but not ligand binding were also seen in layer III of area 18. Following a 5 or 10 d period in which intravitreal injections of TTX had silenced ganglion cell activity in one retina, GABAA receptor immunostaining in layer IVC beta was distributed in intensely stained stripes, 450-550 microns wide, that alternated with narrower, lightly stained stripes. Stripes were also seen with receptor immunostaining and with the binding of the 2 radioligands in layer IVC beta of monocularly enucleated monkeys. Comparison with CO staining revealed that the stripes of reduced immunostaining or ligand binding corresponded to columns dominated by the TTX-injected or enucleated eye. Quantitatively, the binding in the deprived eye columns was reduced by 25%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "64": "GABAA receptors, the major synaptic targets for the neurotransmitter GABA, constitute gated chloride channels. By their allosteric, drug-induced modulation, they serve as control elements for the regulation of anxiety, vigilance, and epileptiform activity. The structural requirements of fully functional GABAA receptors in the mammalian brain have remained elusive so far. We report here on the cloning of the gamma 2-subunit cDNA of rat brain and its functional analysis by coexpression with the alpha 1- and beta 1-subunits in Xenopus oocytes, and on the sites of gene expression of the 3 subunits in the rat brain. The recombinant receptor displayed GABA-inducible currents (Imax = 6 microA; Ka = 75 microM) which were allosterically modulated by benzodiazepine receptor ligands (enhancement and inhibition by diazepam and methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, respectively). In the absence of GABA, pentobarbital elicited a maximal current amplitude similar to that of GABA. A minor population of channels is expressed which is open in the absence of GABA or pentobarbital. Mapping subunit gene expression by in situ hybridization histochemistry suggests that the alpha 1-, beta 1-, and gamma 2-subunits are likely receptor constituents in some neuronal populations, e.g., mitral cells of the olfactory bulb, pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, and granule cells of the dentate gyrus and cerebellum.", 
    "65": "Myoclonus is a clinical term meaning a quick involuntary jerk, seen in normal subjects under certain circumstances, including sleep, and in certain disease states. It is important as a symptom that may impair function and as an indicator of neurological dysfunction. Not until patients with myoclonus and major functional disability were reported in the 1960s was attention given to understanding its basis and pharmacotherapy. Reports of myoclonus developing after anoxic brain injury, and its response to treatment with the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), drew special attention. Further experience showed that only a few patients with myoclonus benefit from 5-HTP therapy. Benzodiazepines (BDZs) are often helpful in the treatment of myoclonus. Their beneficial effects decline with chronic administration because of drug tolerance, and the theoretical basis for BDZ responses remains unclear. The relationships between myoclonus, clonus, and epilepsy are discussed, as is the possible contribution of slow signaling transmembrane receptors to synchronization of motoneuron firing, which is suggested as a hallmark of myoclonus. Myoclonus may originate in many CNS sites, but the brain-stem reticular formation is especially relevant to myoclonus. Brain-stem serotonin neurons have special influence on spinal motoneurons, on startle responses, and on myoclonus. Among 5-HT receptors, 5-HT1A receptors are related to some forms of myoclonus, although 5-HT2 receptors are also implicated. GABAA receptors are related to some forms of myoclonus. Blockade of GABAA receptors or GABA synthesis regularly evokes convulsive seizures, but administration of many GABA agonists and some GABA uptake blockers paradoxically may evoke myoclonus. Injection of GABA receptor blockers into some brain areas has anticonvulsant effects. Stimulation of GABAA receptors may therefore promote or antagonize myoclonus depending on which GABA receptors are involved, the state of the system, etc. The role of glycine receptors is well established in some animal models, but has yet to be clearly established for human myoclonus. Opiates may produce myoclonus when given intrathecally or in high dosage. The concept of excitant anesthetics and special function of certain GABA receptors is discussed.", 
    "66": "Neurotransmitter receptor binding was analyzed in adult tottering (tg/tg) and control wild-type mice. Saturation studies were performed to analyze the density of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in whole brain, cortical, and hippocampal homogenates of 8-9-week-old animals. Scatchard plot analysis was also performed to determine the density and affinity of alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic receptors. No significant difference in Bmax or Kd values was identified between adult tottering and control mice in any of the tissue preparations. The amount of radioligand binding to 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A), non-5-HT1A, 5-HT2, dopamine D2, and benzodiazepine receptors was also identical in tottering and control mice. These findings suggest that the epilepsy expressed by adult tottering mice does not result from alterations in the density or affinity of the neurotransmitter receptors studied.", 
    "67": "To evaluate the efficacy of a combined therapy of prednisolone and alprazolam for controlling cisplatin-induced delayed emesis, a study involving 14 non-small cell lung cancer patients receiving cisplatin (80 mg/m2) was conducted. Seven of these patients were given oral prednisolone at a dose of 30 mg/day for 5 days, then, 15 mg/day for 2 days, and with alprazolam at a dose 1.2 mg/day for 7 days. The other 7 patients were given an oral metoclopramide at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day for 5 days, and at 0.5 mg/kg/day for 2 days. All patients received 2 courses of chemotherapy and the same assigned regimen. Five of the 7 patients who had received prednisolone and alprazolam experienced no emesis, in contrast to only 1 patient who experienced no emesis from taking oral metoclopramide (p less than 0.05). Further, the duration of anorexia was shorter in those who received oral prednisolone with alprazolam. Thus, a combined therapy of oral prednisolone and alprazolam appears to be effective for controlling cisplatin-induced delayed emesis. Further evaluation and study, however, are necessary.", 
    "68": "Chronic benzodiazepine administration has been reported to lead to behavioral tolerance and, in some cases, downregulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA)-receptor binding and function. So-called \"partial agonist\" benzodiazepines appear to cause limited benzodiazepine effects and little or no behavioral tolerance. To evaluate behavioral and neurochemical effects of a partial agonist during chronic administration, we treated mice with Ro16-6028, 0.25, 1 and 4 mg/kg/day by implanted osmotic pumps, evaluating open-field activity and binding and function at the GABAA receptor. All three doses of Ro16-6028 caused dose-dependent decreases in vertical movements (rearing), and no tolerance was observed up to 14 days at any dose. In contrast, tolerance occurred to the effects of clonazepam at 7 days. Benzodiazepine receptor occupancy was essentially complete in all brain regions evaluated at doses of 1 and 4 mg/kg/day. Benzodiazepine binding in vivo at 0.25 mg/kg/day was transiently decreased in cortex at 7 days but was unchanged in any other brain region. Benzodiazepine binding in cortex in vitro was unchanged over time at any of the three doses, as were t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding and binding at the low- and high-affinity GABA sites measured by [3H]SR-95531. GABAA receptor function as determined by muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake was unchanged over 14 days of administration at Ro16-6028 doses of 0.25 and 4 mg/kg/day. Concentrations of Ro16-6028 were constant during administration at 1 and 4 mg/kg/day. These data indicate that chronic Ro16-6028 causes dose-dependent behavioral effects without the development of tolerance and that, despite substantial or complete benzodiazepine receptor occupancy, few effects occur at the GABAA receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "In the present electrophysiological studies the effects of the activation of putative presynaptic benzodiazepine receptors (BZR) in modulating serotonergic (5-HT) transmission in dorsal hippocampus were investigated in chloral hydrate-anesthetized rats. The effectiveness of the electrical stimulation of the ascending 5-HT pathway on the firing activity of CA3 hippocampus pyramidal neurons was modulated by the intravenous administration of BZR ligands. The BZR agonists, diazepam, lorazepam and CL 218,872, dose-dependently enhanced the effectiveness of the stimulation. In contrast, the BZR inverse agonist, FG 7142, dose-dependently decreased it. The effects of agonist and inverse agonist BZR ligands were blocked by the specific BZR antagonist flumazenil. Diazepam and FG 7142 did not modify the efficacy of microiontophoretic applications of gamma-aminobutyric acid and 5-HT onto hippocampal CA3 neurons. BMY 7378, a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist which blocks the effect of the endogenous 5-HT released by the electrical stimulation of 5-HT fibers in this paradigm, also blocked the enhancing action of diazepam on the effectiveness of the stimulation. These results indicate that the activation of BZR of type I modulates 5-HT neurotransmission, presumably through a presynaptic regulatory mechanism.", 
    "70": "The novel H+/K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase inhibitor (gastric proton pump inhibitor), BY 1023/SK&F 96022, was found to be more potent than omeprazole in some rat models and slightly less potent in a dog model. Overall, both compounds are of a similar potency and efficacy. BY 1023/SK&F 96022 exhibited a somewhat longer duration of the antisecretory action than omeprazole in the Ghosh-Schild rat. In the modified Shay rat, on the basis of equieffective doses in terms of the initial effect, both compounds had a comparable duration of action. However, the p.o./i.v. dose ratio upon acute administration was larger for omeprazole, possibly reflecting its lower stability in the acidic environment of the secreting stomach, compared to BY 1023/SK&F 96022. As in vivo, both compounds were equipotent to inhibit acid production in rabbit isolated fundic glands. However, omeprazole interacted with the 7-ethoxycoumarin dealkylase in vitro with high affinity (Ki = 38.5 mumol/l), in contrast to BY 1023/SK&F 96022 (Ki = 135 mumol/l). Compared to omeprazole, BY 1023/SK&F 96022 also showed less interaction with the cytochrome P450 enzyme hydroxylating ionazolac. Moreover, this difference between the two compounds was also found in the rat in vivo with respect to their interaction with diazepam. Thus, both compounds displayed a comparable antisecretory potency in vivo and in vitro but showed a different interference with cytochrome P450 in favor of less interaction by BY 1023/SK&F 96022.", 
    "71": "This study was aimed at determining whether the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBZDR), which is abundantly expressed on mononuclear phagocytes, is involved in host defense mechanisms depending on phagocyte membrane-associated NADPH-oxidase complex. Analysis by reversible and covalent binding of PBZDR expression on human neutrophils shows that it is modulated during NADPH-oxidase activation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Based on a series of 17 patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), results show that PBZDR expression is dramatically impaired in X-linked CGD, an inherited disorder due to a mutation on the gene coding for cytochrome b558 NADPH-oxidase component, whereas it is unaffected in autosomal recessive CGD where cytochrome b558 is normally expressed, suggesting a link between PBZDR and cytochrome b558 expressions. PBZDR can be assigned by covalent binding to an 18-Kd membrane protein. These results suggest that the neutrophil PBZDR, which can accommodate the widely prescribed anxiolytic drug Valium (diazepam), is involved in host defense against pathogens, a function that could be affected by neuroimmune interactions.", 
    "72": "Several alpha-methyl analogues of the 9-benzylpurines that bind to the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) were synthesized and tested for BZR-binding activity. Although introduction of a m-amino group and an 8-bromo substituent gave an additive increase in BZR affinity with 9-(3-aminobenzyl)-8-bromo-6-(dimethylamino)-9H-purine (4), addition of an alpha-methyl group to 4 resulted in a loss in BZR affinity. This loss in affinity is apparently due to repulsive, steric interactions between the 8-bromo and 9-(1-phenylethyl) substituents, which results in a conformation that is not optimal for interaction with the BZR. Several compounds were tested on a modified Geller-Seifter conflict schedule, but none exhibited significant anxiolytic activity.", 
    "73": "Peripheral benzodiazepine binding constants for transplanted RG-2 gliomas and HD and LK Walker 256 tumors (metastatic breast carcinoma) were determined in Wistar rats using autoradiography. In addition, Kd and Bmax parameters for peripheral benzodiazepine receptors on RG-2 tumors were directly visualized using digital image analysis of autoradiograms. High specific binding of [3H]PK11195, a selective peripheral benzodiazepine ligand, had excellent topographical correlation to areas of histologically verified tumor. Scatchard analysis suggested a single class of peripheral binding sites with similar binding affinities in RG-2 and LK Walker 256 tumors and normal cortex. Bmax was 20-fold greater in glial tumors and 11.6- and 10.6-fold greater in LK and HK Walker 256 tumors, respectively, compared to normal cortex. The location of metastatic tumors, either intracerebrally or subcutaneously, did not effect their Kd or Bmax values. Kd and Bmax values for RG-2 tumors were similar whether determined densitometrically or by direct visualization with image analysis. Binding parameters within normal brain were difficult to visualize by image analysis due to the low level of specific binding. The ability to label specifically intracerebral tumor cells and to characterize the binding parameters shown in this study suggest that peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands could be utilized by PET to analyze directly a variety of tumors in humans.", 
    "74": "Differences in effects on central haemodynamics, organ blood flow, and serum corticosterone were studied in 11 rats anaesthetized with midazolam/fentanyl/fluanisone (MFF) and 11 other rats anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. Compared with pentobarbital, MFF reduced aortic blood pressure by 25%, increased heart rate by 20%, and increased cardiac output by 80%. Unlike most tissues, MFF produced a fivefold increase in blood flow to skeletal muscle, and decreased adrenal blood flow compared to pentobarbital anaesthesia. Initial serum corticosterone levels were lower in rats given MFF anaesthesia, indicating better stress protection. This study also indicates that MFF anaesthesia is preferable to pentobarbital because tissue perfusion generally was better preserved.", 
    "75": "We were interested in determining the infusion rate of mivacurium required to maintain approximately 95% neuromuscular blockade during nitrous oxide-halothane (0.8% end-tidal) or nitrous oxide-narcotic anesthesia. Neuromuscular blockade was monitored by recording the electromyographic activity (Datex NMT) of the adductor pollicis muscle resulting from supramaximal stimulation of the ulnar nerve at 2 Hz for 2 s at 10-s intervals. Mivacurium steady-state infusion requirements averaged 315 +/- 26 micrograms.m-2.min-1 during nitrous oxide-halothane anesthesia and 375 +/- 19 micrograms.m-2.min-1 (mean +/- SEM) during nitrous oxide-narcotic anesthesia. Higher levels of pseudocholinesterase activity were generally associated with a higher mivacurium infusion requirement. During both anesthetics, younger age was associated with a higher infusion requirement when the infusion requirement was calculated in terms of micrograms.kg-1.min-1. This difference was not present when the infusion rate was calculated in terms of micrograms.m-2.m-1. There was no evidence of cumulation during prolonged mivacurium infusion. There was no difference in the rates of spontaneous or reversal-mediated recovery between anesthetic groups. After the termination of the infusion, spontaneous recovery to T4/T1 greater than or equal to 0.75 occurred in 9.8 +/- 0.4 min, with a recovery index, T25-75, of 4.0 +/- 0.2 min (mean +/- SEM). In summary, pseudocholinesterase activity is the major factor influencing mivacurium infusion rate in children during nitrous oxide-narcotic or nitrous oxide-halothane (0.8% end-tidal) anesthesia.", 
    "76": "Acute voluntary medicinal intoxications (AVMI) constitute a serious social-medical problem, frequently related to other problems, such as drug addiction and psychopathies. By means of a prospective study of AVMI cases seen in 1989 by the Emergency Room of Internal Medicine in our Hospital, and for persons over the age of 13 in the Health Area Navarra I, we can conclude that there is an incidence of 70.4/100,000 inhabitants, with a relative and absolute majority of females and of residents in urban areas. One third of cases had psychopathological case histories, while another third have a prior history of drug and/or alcohol abuse. The majority of patients are under 30. The peristaltic data seem to have only a tenuous relationship to the onset of AVMI, which mainly occurs at night. In 85% of cases, we are able to determine the causing factor. Psychopharmaceuticals are present in more than 60% of autolytic cases, the highest frequency belonging to benzodiazepines. In our environment, there is a high percentage of admittances despite the fact that a positive outcome is reached in virtually all cases: only 1 exitus out of 103 cases.", 
    "77": "In an open, randomized, parallel group study of 84 adult patients undergoing elective day-case urological surgery the specific benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil was shown to reverse effectively subjective postoperative sedation due to midazolam and enabled 83% of patients to recover and be ready for potential discharge within 15 min of surgery (control group 24% p less than 0.001). The significantly shorter recovery time has benefits in terms of increased patient cooperation and reduced demands on postoperative nursing care. The implications of these findings for day-case surgery are discussed.",

Unilateral 10-nl injections of PZ, DAMP, or the M2-antagonist AFDX-116 resulted in the following. AFDX-116 greater than PZ greater than DAMP decreased blood pressure. DAMP greater than PZ greater than AFDX-116 decreased base-line phrenic activity and the CO2 response slope. Many injections had no effect, and some affected only one variable. The injection sites were within 700 microns of the VLM surface extending from the caudal aspect of the superior olive through a region ventromedial to the facial nucleus to the rostral aspect of the inferior olive. In a small number of experiments the response to carotid sinus nerve stimulation was affected by some injections of each antagonist. In the rostral VLM cardiovascular regulation involves M2-receptors, whereas respiratory regulation involves predominantly the M3-subtype. Neurons with these receptors appear to be closely intermingled.", 
    "79": "Bilateral intra-amygdalar (i/am) microinjections of TRH (1 and 10 micrograms) and physostigmine (10 micrograms) into the central nucleus (CEA) aggravated cold restraint stress (3 hr at 4 degrees C) induced gastric ulcer formation in rats, whereas atropine (1, 5 and 10 micrograms) attenuated this phenomenon. Similar stress ulcer reducing effects were seen with chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 10 mg/kg, IP) and midazolam (1, 3 and 10 micrograms, i/am). Pretreatment of rats with atropine or CDP antagonized the ulcerogenic effects of both TRH and physostigmine. Further, when administered intra-CEA, midazolam neutralized the effects of TRH in a dose-related manner. These results are discussed in light of TRH-acetylcholine-benzodiazepine/GABA interactions within the amygdaloid complex during stress ulcer formation.",

During the course of the MR study, panic attacks occurred in 46 subjects, which prevented continuation of the examination. An IV bolus injection of diazepam was administered, which enabled completion of the examination in all 46 cases. The expected effects of a high blood level of diazepam, such as somnolence, slow reactions, overrelaxation, and inhibition of breathing, were not observed. The panic attacks disappeared rapidly after the injection. The patients agreed to a repeat MR examination under similar conditions, if necessary.", 
    "81": "The present study was performed to establish whether the mechanism by which the cholinergic system influences growth hormone (GH) release was altered in type I diabetic patients. Therefore, we investigated in a dose-response fashion the inhibitory effect of the muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist pirenzepine on the GH responses to arginine infusion (30 g infused intravenously (IV) in 30 minutes), exercise (bicycle ergometer test at an intensity of 75 W for 30 minutes), or 1-44 GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) (1 microgram/kg in an IV bolus). In a preliminary study, IV injection of 17.5 mg pirenzepine failed to produce modification in the GH response to arginine infusion in both diabetic (N = 4) and normal subjects (N = 4), and to exercise (diabetics, N = 4; normals, N = 4). Therefore, other subjects were tested without and with 20, 25, and 30 mg pirenzepine during arginine (diabetics, N = 7; normals, N = 7) or exercise (diabetics, N = 7; normals, N = 7) tests. Each subject was tested four times. Diabetic patients presented higher GH responses to stimulation with arginine or exercise than normal controls. In both groups, pirenzepine administered at doses ranging from 20 to 30 mg produced a dose-related inhibition of the GH response to arginine and exercise, which was almost complete when 30 mg pirenzepine was administered. However, the percent inhibition produced by 20 or 25 mg pirenzepine in the arginine test and by 20 mg in the exercise test was significantly lower in the diabetic patients than in the normal controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "82": "Acetylcholine (ACh) hyperpolarizes adult canine Purkinje fibers and induces a decrease in their automaticity. In Purkinje fibers from young dogs, there is a biphasic effect on automaticity, which increases at low and decreases at high ACh concentrations. We used standard microelectrode techniques to study these actions of ACh. In fibers from young dogs, 10(-10) to 10(-9) M ACh increased automaticity and 10(-5) M ACh decreased automaticity. The decrease was blocked by the M2 muscarinic blocker AFDX-116, whereas the increase was blocked by the predominant M1 blocker pirenzepine. The M2 agonist oxotremorine never increased automaticity. Rather, it decreased automaticity and hyperpolarized adult and young fibers, the former more than the latter. The hyperpolarization and biphasic effect on automaticity of ACh in fibers from young dogs failed to occur after treatment with pertussis toxin, suggesting that these effects are dependent on a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. These electrophysiologic studies suggest that postsynaptic M1 and M2 muscarinic processes modulate the automatic response of Purkinje fibers from young dogs and that the postsynaptic M1 pathway is no longer seen in the adult.", 
    "83": "The binding of the cage convulsant t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) and 36Cl- uptake by synaptoneurosomes were used to test the ability of progesterone metabolites to modulate allosterically the Ro 5-4864 (4'-chlorodiazepam) binding site that is functionally coupled to the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/benzodiazepine receptor complex (GBRC) in rat brain. Dose-dependent enhancement of [35S]TBPS binding by Ro 5-4864 occurs in rat cerebral cortex in the presence of the progesterone metabolites 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one (3 alpha-OH-DHP) and 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha, 20 alpha-diol (pregnanediol). The pregnanediol effect is completely GABA dependent, whereas that of 3 alpha-OH-DHP is not. Conversely, Ro 5-4864 opposed the action of 3 alpha-OH-DHP by increasing the IC50 for 3 alpha-OH-DHP inhibition of [35S]TBPS binding. In cortical synaptoneurosomes, Ro 5-4864 antagonized both 3 alpha-OH-DHP and pregnanediol enhancement of GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake. In both binding and functional studies, pregnanediol showed limited efficacy relative to 3 alpha-OH-DHP, as previously reported. These findings provide the initial evidence that the GBRC-linked Ro 5-4864 binding site is allosterically coupled to the putative progesterone metabolite recognition site and confirm the GABA-mimetic properties of 3 alpha-OH-DHP and pregnanediol.",

The animals received i.p. doses of 5, 10, 20 mg/kg midazolam, or physiological saline. Relative amplitudes of the large negative potentials, which were considered to be an excitation of ventrobasal cells, were not suppressed after midazolam injection. No significant differences were found in latencies of the potentials before and after administration of the drug. It is suggested that the effective sites of midazolam may not be located at a diencephalon level.",

Clinical symptoms may present in acute, chronic or recurrent forms and are characterized by disturbances of consciousness, intellectual, personality and behavioral alterations as well as neuromuscular signs. The pathogenesis of HE is still not completely clear. An important role continues to be attributed to ammonia, although the dysmetabolic aminoacid and neurotransmission systems are at present under particular scrutiny. Diagnosis of HE is generally easy, yet the true diagnostic \"problem\" lies in identifying the at-risk cirrhotic patient for correct orientation of his or her psychosocial and therapeutic management. The first step consists in identification and removal of the precipitating causes. Catharctic agents and branched chain aminoacids may subsequently be utilized. Present studies on the use of anti-benzodiazepine drugs seem to be bringing forth new prospects.",

All groups received a similar amount of contact with the psychologist and general practitioner. The greatest improvement in ratings of severity of symptoms and overall change in symptoms occurred with cognitive-behaviour therapy combined with diazepam; cognitive-behaviour therapy alone also performed well and cognitive-behaviour therapy plus placebo performed slightly less well. Diazepam alone showed improvement relative to placebo alone. There was a high level of agreement between ratings by the general practitioners, psychologist, and the patients of the response to treatment. At six months follow-up there was no difference between treatment groups in the proportion of patients receiving psychotropic medication after the end of the study. However, cognitive-behaviour therapy, either alone or in combination with drug or placebo, showed the lowest incidence of referral for psychological or psychiatric treatment at six months follow-up.",

    "90": "Chronic experiments were conducted on rats subjected to 10-minute circulatory arrest to study the effect of intraperitoneal phenazepam (2 mg/kg) injection in various periods after resuscitation on some behavior indices. It was found that the changes in the quantitative (the degree of the effect) and qualitative (the extent of the effect) manifestations of the tranquilizing effect of phenazepam were determined by the different stages of restoration (from 1 to 21 days) after resuscitation. The results provide evidence of a definite stage character in the reactivity of the central nervous system in relation to pharmacological effects after resuscitation and, possibly, may reflect the functional reorganization of the work of the receptor complex and ion conductivity in the postresuscitation period."
