    "0": "The neurosteroid, 3alpha-OH-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (allopregnanolone) is a potent positive modulator of the GABA(A) receptor complex. Its pharmacological spectrum of action is shared by the benzodiazepines and alcohol, and includes anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, ataxic, and hypnotic effects. Discontinuation from chronic exposure to allopregnanolone or other neuroactive steroids has been shown to elicit behavioral effects that are typically seen in benzodiazepine or alcohol withdrawal. In this series of experiments, the effects of an endogenous elevation of ovarian steroids on brain GABA(A) receptor function was examined by inducing pseudopregnancy. In female rats, pseudopregnancy did not affect behavior in the elevated plus-maze, despite a persistent increase in circulating levels of allopregnanolone. Pseudopregnancy was associated with a decrease in the maximal binding density of 3H-flunitrazepam in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum; however, GABA-stimulated chloride influx in cerebral cortical, hippocampal, and cerebellar synaptoneurosomes remained unaffected during pseudopregnancy. Termination of pseudopregnancy by ovariectomy precipitated an anxiogenic-like effect in the elevated plus-maze. The withdrawal from elevated ovarian steroid levels also increased the number of benzodiazepine receptors and decreased GABA-stimulated chloride influx in the hippocampus.", 
    "1": "The aim of this work was to present the advantages of two polymeric cartridges (Oasis HLB from Waters and Abselut Nexus from Varian) for the solid-phase extraction of methadone enantiomers and its major metabolite, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP) and of some benzodiazepines (diazepam, flunitrazepam, nitrazepam, oxazepam) in serum and urine in comparison with classical C18-bonded-silica cartridges or liquid extraction. After addition of serum or urine samples, these two cartridges were washed with a water-methanol mixture (95:5, v/v) and eluted with diethylether. After rapid evaporation, the residue was regenerated with mobile phase and injected either in a chiral column (Cyclobond I-2000 RSP) for methadone enantiomers and its metabolite or in a reversed-phase column (Symmetry Shield RP8) for benzodiazepines. The results showed that the chromatograms of blank serum and urine were cleaner than those obtained from classical solid-phase extraction or liquid extraction. The recoveries from these two polymeric cartridges were higher (95-102%) than those obtained by the two previous classical methods and the total time for extraction and solvent evaporation was also shorter (about 6-7 min). For methadone and benzodiazepine extraction, the use of acidic or alkaline buffer was not necessary.", 
    "2": "Effects of autoshaping procedures (Paired versus Random) and sipper fluid [chlordiazepoxide (CDP) versus water] on sipper-directed drinking were evaluated in 32 male Long-Evans rats maintained with free access to food and water. For the Paired/CDP group (n = 16), autoshaping procedures consisted of the presentation of the CDP sipper conditioned stimulus (CS) followed by the response-independent presentation of the food unconditioned stimulus (US). The concentration of CDP in the sipper CS (0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, and 0.25 mg/ml CDP) was increased across sessions. The Paired/Water group (n = 8) received only water in the sipper CS. The Random/CDP group (n = 8) received the CDP sipper CS and food US randomly with respect to one another. The Paired/CDP group drank significantly more of the 0.20 mg/ml and 0.25 mg/ml CDP solutions than the Random/CDP control, and more fluid than the Paired/Water control group when the sipper CS for the Paired/CDP group contained the three highest concentrations of CDP. CS-Only extinction procedures reliably reduced sipper CS-directed drinking in the Paired/CDP and the Paired/Water groups, but not in the Random/CDP group. Data are consistent with the hypothesis that Pavlovian autoshaping procedures induce sipper CS-directed drinking of CDP in rats deprived of neither food nor fluid. Implications for the autoshaping model of drug abuse are discussed.", 
    "3": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), one of the main inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain, interacts with three types of receptors for GABA--GABA(A), GABA(B) and GABA(C). GABA(A) receptors, associated with binding sites for benzodiazepines and barbiturates in the form of a receptor complex, control opening of the chloride channel. When GABA binds to the receptor complex, the channel is opened and chloride anions enter the neuron, which is finally hyperpolarized. GABA(B) receptors are metabotropic, linked to a cascade of second messengers whilst the physiological meaning of ionotropic GABA(C) receptors, mainly located in the retina, is generally unknown. Novel antiepileptic drugs acting selectively through the GABA-ergic system are tiagabine and vigabatrin. The former inhibits neuronal and glial uptake of GABA whilst the latter increases the synaptic concentration of GABA by inhibition of GABA-aminotransferase. Gabapentin, designed as a precursor of GABA easily entering the brain, was shown to increase brain synaptic GABA. This antiepileptic drug also decreases influx of calcium ions into neurons via a specific subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels. Conventional antiepileptics generally inhibit sodium currents (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, valproate) or enhance GABA-ergic inhibition (benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, valproate). Ethosuximide, mainly controlling absences, reduces calcium currents via T-type calcium channels. Novel antiepileptic drugs, mainly associated with an inhibition of voltage-dependent sodium channels are lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine. Since glutamate-mediated excitation is involved in the generation of seizure activity, some antiepileptics are targeting glutamatergic receptors--for instance, felbamate, phenobarbital, and topiramate. Besides, they also inhibit sodium currents. Zonisamide, apparently sharing this common mechanism, also reduces the concentration of free radicals. Novel antiepileptic drugs are better tolerated by epileptic patients and practically are devoid of important pharmacokinetic drug interactions.", 
    "4": "The original treatment indicated for those suffering from neurotic anxiety was to employ psychotherapy to facilitate changes in behavior and coping with stressful events. A spectrum of somatic treatments \"from cathartics and emetics to opium and \"strengthening tonics\", from atropine and digitalis to potassium bromide and chloral hydrate, from barbiturates to benzodiazepines\", to serotonergics, came to be used as well [1]. The Food and Drug Administration originally approved many gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) facilitating drugs since the 1960s for anxiety treatment. The 1980s evidenced the approval of a few serotonergic treatments that cornered the prescribing market and the front line of most treatment protocols. More recently, GABAergic drugs are making a return in the treatment of anxiety disorders. The following paper details the pharmacodynamic history of treating anxiety and also updates the reader as to the newer GABA-based approaches mentioned above.", 
    "5": "Topical anesthesia is increasingly being used for cataract surgery. However, it is believed that topical anesthesia causes an increased risk of intraoperative complications from unrestricted eye movement and insufficient pain control and more need for sedation. It is difficult to compare pain and anxiety experienced by individual patients; therefore, the authors used the method of patient-controlled sedation to determine whether there is a difference in sedation requirements under topical or retrobulbar anesthesia.", 
    "6": "In this prospective study, patients received either topical anesthesia (n=87) or retrobulbar block (n=104) and self-administered a mixture of midazolam (0.5 mg) and fentanyl (25 microg) in increments using a patient controlled analgesia infuser to achieve sedation. At the end of surgery, patients rated their pain on a 10-point numerical rating scale and their comfort on a 5-point scale. The number of demands and deliveries were noted from the patient controlled analgesia infuser display.",

    "9": "West syndrome (WS) is an age dependent epileptic syndrome caused by various brain disorders. WS has been frequently classified in two groups, cryptogenic and symptomatic. As symptomatic WS consists of patients with numerous types of brain lesions, the prognosis and evolutional changes may be different among the types of brain lesions. WS is resistant to treatment to most conventional antiepileptic drugs, and only valproic acid, benzodiazepines, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), corticosteroids and vigabatrin have been found efficacious. Benzodiazepine, notably nitrazepam, and less clonazepam had been effective in bringing spasms under control but emerging tolerance and significant side effects (hypotonia and drowsiness) precluded its wider use. ACTH has been the treatment of choice for infantile spasms ever since Sorel and Dusaucy-Bouloye described its effectiveness in 1958. Despite the empirical approach steroids were capable of controlling the spasms and normalizing EEG in about 60% of cases. Corticotropin (ACTH) was used in doses from 5 to 180 I.U. daily, prednizolone 2-10 mg/kg daily, hydrocortisone 5-10 mg/kg daily and dexamethason 0.3-0.5 mg/kg. However, poor consensus was defined regarding the best steroid molecule to use, the dosage, and the duration of treatment. Also frequent and sometimes serious side effects have occurred during ACTH therapy, notably serious infections and hypertension that promoted continuous search for alternative and safer drugs tolerated outpatient treatment, good tolerance and minor side effects. Recently a specific visual field loss has been reported in treated adults that raised concern about safety of vigabatrin. New reports in children claim that vigabatrin treatment of children and adolescents has a lower risk for visual field defect than in adults, because of reported reversibility. Vigabatrin paediatric advisory group recommend the trial of vigabatrin for 12-14 days as first treatment for WS and in the case of good clinical response continuation of therapy for six months. Other new antiepileptic drugs (lamotrigine, topiramate, felbamate and zonisamide) have shown significant efficacy in the treatment of resistant WS to previous medication. The current task is to determine risk/benefit ratios of these two drugs (vigabatine, ACTH) and to delineate the group of patients with WS where their use would be optimal.",

The ability of tadalafil to influence CYP3A activity was also examined in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. The effect of tadalafil on the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A probe substrates was evaluated in human volunteers before and after coadministration with either a single dose or multiple doses of tadalafil (10 or 20 mg).", 
    "12": "Negligible competitive inhibition of CYP3A was observed in vitro. Mechanism-based inhibition of CYP3A was detected, albeit with a low potency. In human hepatocytes, exposure to 1 micromol/L or greater of tadalafil resulted in increased CYP3A protein expression; however, as with a combined effect of induction and inhibition, a corresponding increase in CYP3A activity did not occur. The clinical pharmacokinetics of midazolam and lovastatin, probe substrates of CYP3A, were unaffected by up to 14 days of tadalafil administration (90% confidence intervals for the ratio of least squares means for the pharmacokinetic parameters of tadalafil were contained within the no-effect boundaries of 0.7 to 1.43).", 
    "13": "In vitro results suggested that tadalafil would have little effect on the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by CYP3A. Clinical studies demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of 2 different CYP3A substrates, midazolam and lovastatin, were virtually unchanged after tadalafil coadministration. Thus therapeutic concentrations of tadalafil do not produce clinically significant changes in the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP3A.",

    "15": "This single-site prospective study describes a technique of oral conscious sedation (OCS) that uses triazolam with either local anesthesia or the combination of local anesthesia and nitrous oxide sedation. Over a 15-year period, 188 patients at a private dental practice were followed. Patients received one weight-based dose of triazolam 60 minutes prior to treatment to allow for 60-90 minutes of working time and an additional 60 minutes of recovery time. A supplemental dosage equal to half the initial dose was necessary for 10% of patients and was administered 30 minutes after the initial dose if there was no evidence of sedation. Another 20% required sedation augmented with nitrous oxide/oxygen mixtures of 30-50%. Effective OCS was achieved for 98.4% of all participants. These findings indicate that triazolam may be an extremely effective medication when used for OCS in the dental realm and bears further investigation to confirm these positive results.",

Furthermore, bimetallic complexes having silicon-tin and silicon-zirconium bonds were investigated. On the other hand, utilization of gases in synthetic organic chemistry has been also developed. 1 atm pressure of gases such as CO, CO(2), N(2), ethylene and acetylene, could be used and the reaction procedure is very simple, that a balloon filled with a gas is connected on the top of the flask. Using our novel synthetic methods, we have synthesized many natural products and biologically active substances, such as cephalotaxin, mesembrine, tubifoline, strychnine, stemoamide, lycopodine, pumiliotoxin C, beta-lactam, carbapenam and benzodiazepinone derivatives.",

    "22": "The pharmacological properties and functional role of native GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) were investigated in rat hypothalamic neurons expressing the epsilon-subunit with the help of whole-cell patch-clamp recording and single-cell reverse transcription-PCR. Two cell groups were identified: histaminergic tuberomamillary and orexinergic/hypocretinergic neurons. Approximately 25% of histaminergic and 70% of orexinergic neurons contained mRNA encoding for the epsilon-subunit. Double-immunofluorescence staining revealed a somatic localization of this protein in these two neuronal groups. Constitutive activity, diazepam modulation, fast desensitization of maximal currents, and activation by propofol (6-98 microm) of GABA(A)Rs did not correlate with epsilon-subunit expression. Propofol at 3-12 microm potentiated GABA-mediated currents similarly in all neurons. However, noise variance analysis of GABA-mediated currents enhanced by propofol revealed a significant difference between epsilon-positive and epsilon-negative neurons. The former displayed no difference between control and potentiated responses, and, in the latter, noise was decreased in the presence of propofol. Spontaneous IPSCs recorded in cultured hypothalamic neurons were prolonged in the presence of propofol in all epsilon-negative neurons, whereas propofol-resistant IPSCs were recorded in epsilon-positive cells. The infrequent expression of the epsilon-subunit may be a key factor in the recently discovered central role of the tuberomamillary nucleus in anesthesia.", 
    "23": "A series of 36 imidazopyridineacetamides (2-37) were designed and synthesized to evaluate the effects of structural changes on the amide nitrogen at both central (CBRs) and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs). These changes include variations in the length and number of the alkyl groups as well as introduction of different aromatic, heteroaromatic, and conformationally constrained groups. The affinities of these compounds for CBRs and PBRs were determined, and the results indicate that bulkiness of the substituents, their branching, and length beyond an optimal value may cause hindrance to the ligand in its interaction with the receptor. The presence of aromatic or conformationally constrained substituents on the carboxamide nitrogen can be conducive to high affinity and selectivity. Furthermore, the ability of a subset of the most active ligands to stimulate synthesis of neuroactive steroids in plasma and brain was evaluated in vivo and in vitro. Compound 3 exhibited very marked effects on the peripheral and central synthesis of neuroactive steroids, while 36 (potent at subnanomolar level) showed a slight ability to affect neuroactive steroid content in the cerebral cortex.",

As for all G-protein-coupled receptors, docking of ligands into modeled CCK1R binding site should greatly help to understand intrinsic mechanisms of activation. Here, we describe the procedure we used to progressively build a structural model for the CCK1R, to integrated, and on the basis of site-directed mutagenesis data on its binding site. Reliability of the CCK1R model was confirmed by interaction networks that involved conserved and functionally crucial motifs in G-protein-coupled receptors, such as Glu/Asp-Arg-Tyr and Asn-Pro-Xaa-Xaa-Tyr motifs. In addition, the 3-D structure of CCK1R-bound CCK resembled that determined by NMR in a lipid environment. The derived computational model was also used for revealing binding modes of several nonpeptide ligands and for rationalizing ligand structure-activity relationships known from experiments. Our findings indeed support that our \"validated CCK1R model\" could be used to study the intrinsic mechanism of CCK1R activation and design new ligands.",

    "56": "Placebo has a very important role in the study of bipolar disorders. From a methodological point of view, and given the limitations of non-inferiority designs, the use of placebo is necessary to evaluate the sensitivity of the study and ensure that the drug under investigation is really effective. For this reason, several procedures may be used to satisfactorily solve the ethical objections. Placebo response in bipolar disorder trials is more likely to occur in patients who are mildly ill, bipolar II, mixed-episode, first-episode, rapid cycling, atypical, non-psychotic, substance abusers and medically ill. The use of concomitant medication such as benzodiazepines, a high frequency of visits, a high number of treatment groups and sites, fixed-dose designs, and the concomitant use of psychotherapy are likely to increase placebo response.", 
    "57": "The subject of the use of placebo in psychiatric clinical trials leads to very relevant ethical, methodological and clinical dilemmas. Many reasons support the use of placebo in acute bipolar studies, whereas in maintenance the length of the treatment with placebo makes the decision more difficult. Ethical concerns can be addressed through operational definitions of outcome measures, add-on and discontinuation designs, early escape strategies, and processes designed to make sure that fully informed consent was fairly obtained. There are a number of clinical and methodological variables that are associated with placebo response.", 
    "58": "This article is a review of the various treatments that are currently available, in particular in France, for the treatment of bipolar disorders. This article specifically addresses the use of novel antipsychotic agents as alternative therapy to a lithium therapy and/or the use of conventional antipsychotics. The prevalence of bipolar disorder over a lifetime is around 1% of the general population. Bipolar disorder consists of alternating depressive and manic episodes. It mainly affects younger subjects, and is often associated with alcohol and drug addictions. There are two main subtypes of bipolar disorder. According to the DSM IV-R, type 1 of bipolar disorder is characterised when at least one manic episode (or a mixed episode) has been diagnosed. Type 2 of bipolar disorder is related to patients enduring recurrent depressive episodes but no manic episode. Type 2 affects women more frequently as opposed to type 1 affecting individuals of both sexes. Manic-depressive disorder (or cyclo-thymic disorder) appears in relation to patients who has never suffered manic episode, mixed episode or severe depressive episode but have undergone numerous periods with some symptoms of depression and hypomanic symptoms over a two-year period during which any asymptomatic periods last no longer than two months. The average age of the person going through a first episode (often a depressive one) is 20 years-old. Untreated bipolar patients may endure more than ten manic or depressive episodes. Finally, in relation to 10 to 20% of patients, the bipolar disorder will turn into a fast cycle form, either spontaneously or as a result of certain medical treatments. Psychiatrists are now able to initiate various treating strategies which are most likely to be effective as a result of the identification of clinical subtypes of the bipolar disorder. Lithium therapy has been effectively and acutely used for patients with pure or elated mania and its prophylaxis. However, lithium medication may worsen depressive symptoms when used for a long term maintenance therapy. Additionally, mixed mania, rapid cycling type patients and bipolar disorder associated with substance abuse do not respond well to lithium therapy. In addition to the lithium therapy or in place of a lithium therapy, one can report the frequent use of antipsychotic agents in respect of patients with bipolar disorder during both the acute and maintenance phases of treatment. Antipsychotic agents have been used for almost forty years and may be used in combination with a lithium therapy. Conventional antipsychotics are effective but they may induce late dyskinesia, weight gain, sedation, sexual dysfunction and depression. These adverse side effects often lead to non compliance in particular in circumstances where antipsychotic agents are combined with a lithium therapy. A number of alternative somatic treatment approaches have been reported for patients who do not respond well or who are intolerant to lithium therapy. As such, valproate has received regulatory approval for the acute treatment of mania and carbamazepine has been indicated for this condition in a number of countries. Divalproex (Depakote) has recently obtained the authorization to market in France and may be prescribed for manic states or hypomanic states that do not tolerate lithium therapy or for which lithium therapy is contraindicated. A number of other anticonvulsants (lamotrigine, gabapentin and topiramate) are currently being tested. Because of the side effects of the conventional antipsychotic agents, atypical antipsychotic agents are currently on trial and appear to be of interest in the treatment of bipolar disorders. Currently, a number of prospective studies are available with clozapine, risperidone and olanzapine in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Most are short-term studies. Recent randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown clozapine, risperidone and olanzapine to be effective with antimanic and antidepressive effects, both as monotherapy and as add-on maintenance therapy with lithium or valproate. They also have a favorable side effect profile and a positive effect on overall functioning. Similarly, valproate combined with antipsychotics provides greater improvement in mania than antipsychotic medication alone and results in lower dosage of the antipsychotic medication. There is currently no double-blind study regarding the use of clozapine for bipolar disorders. However, based on the results of a number of open-label studies, clozapine appears to be effective in relation to schizo-affective and bipolar patients including those with rapid cycling or those who respond inadequately to mood stabilizers, carbamazepine, valproate or conventional antipsychotics. Clozapine seems to be more appropriate for bipolar and schizo-affective patients than schizophrenics. In particular, studies show that patients with manic and mixed-psychotic state of illness are better responders than patients with major depressive syndromes. Four open studies suggest the efficacy of clozapine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder and three prospective, open-label studies show the efficacy of clozapine in the manic state of the illness. However, the number of patients in the studies was not important and these studies are not controlled. Clozapine has also adverse side affects, one of which consisting of a major risk of agranulocytosis and, potentially, death. In addition, clozapine has been shown to produce significant weight gain and sialorrhea as well as significant anticholinergic effects. As a result, clozapine should not be prescribed in the first place. As opposed to clozapine, there are open-label reports and controlled studies in respect of risperidone and olanzapine. Two recent double-blind studies of acute mania found olanzapine to be more effective than placebo. Based on these two studies, olanzapine has recently been approved for the indication of mania. The effects of olanzapine and divalproex in the treatment of mania have also been compared in a large randomized clinical trial. The olanzapine treatment group had significantly greater mean improvement of mania ratings and a significantly greater proportion of patients achieving protocol-defined remission. Significantly more weight gain and cases of dry mouth, increased appetite and somnolence were reported with olanzapine while more cases of nausea were reported with divalproex. The comparison of olanzapine with lithium for the treatment of mania has also been the subject of a double-blind randomized controlled trial. That study shows no differences between the two drugs. While these studies support the idea that olanzapine has direct acute anti-manic effects, a number of authors are of the opinion that olanzapine may have specific prophylactic mood-stabilizing properties. Olanzapine would appear to be effective in the maintenance treatment, as it exhibited both antimanic and antidepressant effects. Systematic trials have shown that risperidone may be effective and safe in the treatment of acute mania, as an add-on therapy with lithium or valproate (open studies and two controlled double-blind studies) and as monotherapy (open studies). In an open, multi-center, 6-month study, risperidone seems to be effective and safe as long-term adjunctive therapy in treatment-resistant bipolar and schizo-affective disorders, with no exacerbation of manic symptoms. Risperidone had few adverse side effects (and where there were any, they were mostly mild), mostly consisting of APS and weight gain. A naturalistic comparison of clozapine, risperidone and olanzapine in the treatment of bipolar disorder suggests that the efficacy and tolerability of the three treatments are similar. One major differentiation factor of these drugs appears to be weight gain, particularly between olanzapine and risperidone. However, this may partially be caused by the use of mood-stabilizing agents. Bipolar and schizo-affective patients now require combination therapy approach because of the cyclic nature of these disorders. Many studies report the combination of mood-stabilizing agents with conventional antipsychotics and atypical antipsychotics. Combination therapies produce a number of adverse side effects. Atypical antipsychotics (other than clozapine) are now rated as first-line agents for adjunctive treatment of mania because they produce less adverse side effects. Atypical antipsychotics are also rated as first-line agents for combined treatment of psychotic depression and they are strongly preferred when an antipsychotic is required for long-term maintenance.",

For P1 and P2 respectively, 804 and 830 episodes of acute self drug-poisonings were compared. For the two studied periods, psycholeptic drugs predominated (78 and 77%); however, benzodiazepines declined (67 to 55%; P <0.01) and antidepressants increased (9.5 to 15%; P <0.01). Moreover, the type of antidepressant changed markedly with a decrease of the imipraminic antidepressants (48.4 to 10.7%) and an increase of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (31.2 to 74%). The proportion of benzodiazepine-related drugs increased with time (7.9 to 14.1%). The proportion of analgesics was 5.4% for P1 and 7.3% for P2; paracetamol, alone or associated to other compounds, remained the most incriminated. Nevertheless, opioids were more often mentioned during the later period (11.6 to 24.5%).

    "67": "Objective. As polypharmacy is routinely used for the treatment of bipolar disorder, the relation between the daily number of psychotropic medications and self-reported mood was investigated. Method. Eighty patients (35 men and 45 women) with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder I or II, recruited from academic centres, entered their mood, sleep, and psychotropic medications for 3 months into ChronoRecord software. A total of 8662 days of data was received (mean 114.7 days/per patient). Results. Seventy-nine patients took a mean of 3.8 medications daily (SD 1.7; range 1-9); one took none. Of these patients, 73 (92.4%) took mood stabilizers, 47 (58.8%) took antidepressants, 31 (38.8%) took antipsychotics, 34 (42.5%) took benzodiazepines and 17 (21.1%) took thyroid hormones. Patients reporting normal mood more frequently took fewer medications; the Pearson correlation coefficient between the number of medications and the percent of days normal was -0.481 (P\u200a<\u200a0.001). Grouping by number of medications, ANOVA analysis showed those taking fewer medications reported normal mood more frequently (P<0.001). Conclusion. Combination treatment regimens are routinely prescribed for bipolar disorder. Patients reporting normal mood more frequently took a fewer number of daily medications. Studies are needed to better identify those patients who would benefit from polypharmacy and to optimise the combinations of medications for patients with refractory disorder.", 
    "68": "Drugs can cause behavioural impairment of the driver's ability to operate safely That impairment of driving ability can be documented, and biological fluids can be tested for drugs. Most countries have legislation that covers driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. Some countries have introduced zero-tolerance laws (per se laws), which prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while an illicit drug or its metabolite is present in the body, whether or not impairment is manifested. There is growing interest in using saliva (oral fluid) in preliminary roadside testing. Legislation in the state of Victoria, Australia, already allows the use of oral fluid for evidentiary testing in the case of cannabis and methamphetamine. Nevertheless, blood testing will probably remain the most common form of evidentiary testing. It has been estimated that the prevalence of illicit drug use among the general driving population in Europe is in the range of 1-5 per cent, while the prevalence of licit drugs, such as benzodiazepines, affecting driving performance is higher: 5-10 per cent. Epidemiological research is often carried out on offenders and drivers involved in collisions. Among drivers suspected of driving under the influence of drugs, there is a high percentage of licit and/or illicit drug use, as the statistics for Finland in the present article show.

    "69": "Benzodiazepine binding sites were studied in mitochondria of unicellular eukaryotes, the amoeba Acathamoeba castellanii and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and also in rat liver mitochondria as a control. For that purpose we applied Ro5-4864, a well-known ligand of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (MBR) present in mammalian mitochondria. The levels of specific [(3)H]Ro5-4864 binding, the dissociation constant (K(D)) and the number of [(3)H]Ro5-4864 binding sites (B(max)) determined for fractions of the studied mitochondria indicate the presence of specific [(3)H]Ro5-4864 binding sites in the outer membrane of yeast and amoeba mitochondria as well as in yeast mitoplasts. Thus, A. castellanii and S. cerevisiae mitochondria, like rat liver mitochondria, contain proteins able to bind specifically [(3)H]Ro5-4864. Labeling of amoeba, yeast and rat liver mitochondria with [(3)H]Ro5-4864 revealed proteins identified as the voltage dependent anion selective channel (VDAC) in the outer membrane and adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) in the inner membrane. Therefore, the specific MBR ligand binding is not confined only to mammalian mitochondria and is more widespread within the eukaryotic world. However, it can not be excluded that MBR ligand binding sites are exploited efficiently only by higher multicellular eukaryotes. Nevertheless, the MBR ligand binding sites in mitochondria of lower eukaryotes can be applied as useful models in studies on mammalian MBR.",

    "87": "In summary, the advances of the last half of the 20th century in general anesthesia delivery by oral and maxillofacial surgeons are the following: 1. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons in training are exposed to significantly more hospital general anesthesia training and in addition spent much of their residency training performing general anesthesia on outpatient dental patients undergoing dentoalveolar surgery. Training programs increased from one year to three years, then to four years and finally, many six-year programs were developed that award the MD degree during or following completion of the residency program. 2. Self-evaluation programs were initiated in the late 1960s and evolved into mandatory in-office evaluation by peer practitioners and later into state-regulated evaluation. These programs began in Southern California and spread to encompass the entire United States. 3. Intravenous ultra-fast acting barbiturate office anesthesia became very refined and several combination drug \"balanced\" techniques developed. 4. Benzodiazepines, first diazepam then midazolam were introduced and gained wide acceptance by the dental profession. 5. New synthetic narcotic agents were introduced, which give the oral surgeon another pain control and anesthesia supplement. The new agents were short acting but very effective for the period necessary to complete most office surgical procedures. Fentanyl is the prototype for these agents. 6. Monitoring devices were incorporated into practice, and currently all oral surgeons use the pulse oximeter, the electrocardiograph, and blood pressure monitoring devices. All of these monitors are required by the California general anesthesia regulations. 7. Propofol, an entirely new type of intravenous agent, was introduced and is used by more than half of oral surgeons reporting in a survey of drugs used in 2003. Propofol may be used by incremental injection or by continuous infusion incorporating an automatic infusion pump. 8. Sevoflurane, a potent inhalation anesthetic that has many properties of an ideal agent - rapid onset, potent, easily delivered by calibrated vaporizers, rapid emergence, infrequent postoperative nausea, and favorable acceptance by almost all patients about to undergo general anesthesia - is gaining acceptance and use by oral and maxillofacial surgeons.",

Data were combined using a fixed effect model. Fifty-three trials (2839 patients) from 25 countries reported on a large variety of different ketamine regimens and surgical settings. Sixteen studies tested prophylactic intravenous ketamine (median dose 0.4 mg/kg, range (0.1-1.6)) in 850 adults. Weighted mean difference (WMD) for postoperative pain intensity (0-10 cm visual analogue scale) was -0.89 cm at 6 h, -0.42 at 12 h, -0.35 at 24 h and -0.27 at 48 h.

On day 14, quetiapine reduced tacrine-induced tremulous jaw movements, and in a parallel experiment quetiapine significantly suppressed lever pressing on days 1-14. Repeated injections of quetiapine reduced tacrine-induced jaw movements over a dose range lower than that required for suppression of lever pressing.", 
    "101": "On tests of jaw movement activity and lever pressing after both acute and repeated drug administration, quetiapine showed a profile somewhat similar to clozapine and olanzapine. A theoretical model is offered suggesting that atypical antipsychotics that act on 5-HT or muscarinic receptors have intrinsic antiparkinsonian actions that work in opposition to the motor effects produced by dopamine antagonism.", 
    "102": "Anxiety disorders are common and often disabling. They fall into five main categories: panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, each of which have characteristic symptoms and cognitions. All anxiety disorders respond to drugs and psychological treatments. This review will focus on drug treatments. Recent research has emphasized the value of antidepressants especially the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, and related sedative-like compounds. The common co-existence of depression with all of the anxiety disorders means that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are now generally considered to be the first-line treatments but the benzodiazepines have some utility especially in promoting sleep and working acutely to reduce extreme distress.", 
    "103": "Benzodiazepines (BZs) are clinically used as anxiolytic, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, and antispasmodic drugs. Research using transgenic mouse models has suggested that the effects of BZs involve multiple subtypes of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor, identified by specific a subunits (alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, alpha5). This review discusses the experimental uses of b-carboline-3-carboxylate-t-butyl ester (betaCCT), a drug that binds preferentially to the GABAA alpha1 subtype but exerts no action (ie, is a pharmacologic antagonist at the GABAA alpha1 subtype receptor). betaCCT blocks the anxiolytic-like effects of BZs, although studies in primates suggests this antagonism may reflect multiple receptor populations. betaCCT antagonized the ataxic but not muscle relaxant effects of BZs, a finding that implicates the GABAA alpha1 subtype receptor in ataxia but not muscle relaxation. The potential clinical utility of betaCCT is discussed, both in terms of treatment (ie, hepatic encephalopathy) and as a diagnostic imaging agent. Altogether, these results indicate that subtype-selective antagonists represent a useful approach to studying receptor mechanisms underlying the behavioral effects of BZ-type drugs.", 
    "104": "When benzodiazepines (BZs) supplanted barbiturates as a favored, safer treatment for anxiety and sleep disorders in the 1960s, the abuse liability and dependence potential of these drugs were little understood. Widespread recognition of the difficulty of stopping use of chronically taken BZs emerged through the popular press in the late 1970s, which resulted in reluctance to prescribe these otherwise clinically useful compounds. Evolution of the understanding of the biochemical basis for BZ effects in the 1980s and 1990s, coupled with regulatory emphasis on collection of data used in legal scheduling decisions, made possible a targeted search for drugs that would provide effective treatment for anxiety disorders in the absence of abuse liability or dependence potential. Compounds that have selective efficacy at subtypes of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor, are active in preclinical anxiolytic screens, but negative in preclinical studies of behavior relevant to evaluation of abuse liability appear to be one promising means for achieving this end.", 
    "105": "Drugs modulating gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission via the benzodiazepine (BZ) site on the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor have been in widespread use for more than 40 years to treat anxiety, epilepsy, and sleep disorders. These drugs have been shown to be safe, well tolerated, and effective although the mechanism by they produce a myriad of pharmacologic effects remains elusive. In recent years it has been discovered that, although the GABAA receptor is widely distributed in the brain, the substructure and composition of the receptor differs from between brain regions. Termed \"GABAA receptor subtypes\" their discovery leads to speculation that different subtypes may mediate specific effects of BZs such as anxiety or sedation. The phenotypic analysis of transgenic knock-in and knock-out mice in which particular GABAA receptors were rendered insensitive to the effects of BZ while others were unaffected confirmed this speculation. Subsequently, subtype-specific GABAA ligands were developed that, for example, retained the anxiolytic effects of BZs but were devoid of their sedative effects. Therefore, it may be possible to develop effective anxiolytic compounds that have a much reduced side-effect profile compared with existing drugs.", 
    "106": "Previously we demonstrated that the mouse liver tumor response to the non-genotoxic carcinogens oxazepam and Wyeth-14,643 involved more differences than similarities in changes in early gene expression. In this study we used quantitative real-time PCR and oligonucleotide microarray analysis to identify genes that were up- or down-regulated in mouse liver early after treatment with different known carcinogens, including oxazepam (125 and 2500 p.p.m.), o-nitrotoluene (1250 and 5000 p.p.m.) and methyleugenol (75 mg/kg/day), or the non-carcinogens p-nitrotoluene (5000 p.p.m.), eugenol (75 mg/kg/day) and acetaminophen (6000 p.p.m.). Starting at 6 weeks of age, mice were treated with the different compounds for 2 weeks in the diet, at which time the livers were collected. First, expression of 12 genes found previously to be altered in liver after 2 weeks treatment with oxazepam and/or Wyeth-14,643 was examined in livers from the various chemical treatment groups. These gene expression changes were confirmed for the livers from the oxazepam-treated mice in the present study, but were not good early markers for all the carcinogens in this study. In addition, expression of 20 842 genes was assessed by oligonucleotide microarray [n = 4 livers/group, 2 hybridizations/liver (with fluor reversals)] and the results were analyzed using the Rosetta Resolver System and GeneSpring software. The analyses revealed that several cancer-related genes, including Fhit, Wwox, Tsc-22 and Gadd45b, were induced or repressed in unique patterns for specific carcinogens and not altered by the non-carcinogens. The data indicate that even if the tumor response, including molecular alterations, is similar, such as for oxazepam and methyleugenol, early gene expression changes appear to be carcinogen specific and seem to involve apoptosis and cell cycle-related genes.", 
    "107": "Delirium is thought to be a temporary psychiatric disorder resulting from a reduced central cholinergic transmission, combined with an increased dopaminergic transmission. The cholinergic and the dopaminergic systems interact not only with each other but with glutamatergic and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) pathways. Besides the cerebral cortex, critical anatomical substrates of psychosis pathophysiology would comprise the striatum, the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area, and the thalamus. The thalamus acts as a filter, allowing only the relevant information to travel to the cortex. Drugs of abuse (e.g. PCP, Ecstasy), as well as psychoactive medications frequently prescribed to hospitalized patients (e.g. benzodiazepines, opioids) could compromise the thalamic gating function, leading to sensory overload and hyperarousal. We propose that drug-induced delirium would result from the transient thalamic dysfunction caused by exposure to medications that interfere with central glutamatergic, GABAergic, dopaminergic and cholinergic pathways at critical sites of action. This model provides directions for future studies in neurophysiology, in vivo brain imaging, and psychopharmacology investigating delirium neuropathophysiology.", 
    "108": "Refractory convulsive status epilepticus (RCSE) is life-threatening condition, with seizures lasting over one hour and not responding to first and second-line anticonvulsant drug therapy. Any mistreatment or delayed proper treatment significantly increase mortality and neurologic sequelae. First line drugs for convulsion ceasing are benzodiazepines, phenobarbital and phenytoin. In case of refractory status, infusion of midazolam and general anesthesia should be administered. The most important measures of the intensive care are control of vital functions, homeostasis, prevention and therapy for possible brain and systemic complications. Discovery of etiology of status epilepticus is highly important because symptomatic therapy should be administered. Overall mortality rate during RCSE is 13.5%, and is much higher in acute symptomatic group--28.6%. Early sequelae rate is 40.6%, 27.3% and 70% in idiopathic and acute symptomatic groups, respectively.", 
    "109": "Three patients with Parkinson's disease developed psychosis. None of the three showed any other somatic cause for the psychosis except the Parkinson's disease. The first patient, a 73-year-old male, was initially treated with olanzapine and rivastigmine, without any effect. While treating the second patient, a 75-year-old male who had been suffering from Parkinson's disease for years, the Parkinson medication was first reduced and later on olanzapine and rivastigmine were prescribed, without a lasting effect on the psychotic symptoms. In the third patient, an 85-year-old male, medication reduction was unsuccessful. Finally, all three were treated effectively with clozapine. Psychosis in Parkinson's disease is a serious disorder that is often difficult to treat. In most cases, antipsychotic medication is needed. The atypical antipsychotic clozapine is effective without aggravation of the motor symptoms. Despite the side effects, such as the risk of agranulocytosis, drowsiness and weight gain, clozapine should be considered as a possible treatment.",

    "113": "We combined a study of the subcellular distribution of the alpha1, alpha2, alpha4, beta1, beta2/3, gamma2, and delta subunits of the GABAA receptor with an electrophysiological analysis of GABAA receptor currents determine the to types of receptors expressed on cultured hippocampal pyramidal neurons. The immunocytochemistry study demonstrated that alpha1, alpha2, beta2/3, and gamma2 subunits formed distinct clusters of various sizes, which were colocalized with clusters of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) immunoreactivity at rates ranging from 22 to 58%. In contrast, alpha4, beta1, and delta subunits were distributed diffusely over the cell soma and neuronal processes of cultured neurons and did not colocalize with the synaptic marker GAD. Whole-cell GABA receptor currents were moderately sensitive to GABAA and were modulated by diazepam. The whole-cell currents were also enhanced by the neurosteroid allopregnanolone (10 nM). Tonic currents, measured as changes in baseline current and noise, were sensitive to Zn2+, furosemide, and loreclezole; they were insensitive to diazepam. These studies suggest that two kinds of GABAA receptors are expressed on cultured hippocampal neurons. One kind of receptor formed clusters, which were present at GABAergic synapses and in the extrasynaptic membrane. The alpha1, alpha2, beta2/3, and gamma2 subunits were contained in clustered receptors. The second kind was distributed diffusely in the extrasynaptic membrane. The alpha4, beta1, and delta subunits were contained in these diffusely distributed receptors. The properties of tonic currents recorded from these neurons were similar to those from recombinant receptors containing alpha4, beta1, and delta subunits.",

They were clinically evaluated using the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS), and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia. Sleep recordings were as follows: one acclimatization nigh, one night of baseline recordings, and two nights in which the patients receives olanzapine 10 mg, one hour before bedtime. For sleep-comparison purposes, a group of normal volunteers were also studied with acclimatization and baseline nights. After the sleep recordings ended patients continued with the administration of 10 mg/d of olanzapine, that was titrated as needed up to 20 mg/d or down to 5 mg/d. Evaluations were conducted weekly.", 
    "116": "Awakening and sleep latency variables were significantly higher in schizophrenic patients compared to normal volunteers. Delta sleep was lower in patients than in normal subjects, with no detectable values in some of the schizophrenics. There was not correlation at baseline, between psychopathological scores and delta sleep or other sleep variables. The acute administration of olanzapine 10 mg produced an improvement in continuity sleep variables as well as increase in deltas sleep percentage. Having less than 10% of delta sleep at baseline predicted a good clinical outcome. Eleven of 18 patients showed good clinical improvement after eight weeks of treatment with olanzapine, those were the subjects that had an augmentation of delta sleep above 10% with the first two doses of olanzapine, with minimal side effects.",

    "118": "Fibromyalgia is a common and disabling chronic pain syndrome. Although a wide array of symptomatic pharmacological treatments has been used to treat this condition, only modest results have been obtained. Olanzapine has been proven effective in some chronic pain conditions. The authors present a case series of patients suffering from fibromyalgia who received olanzapine as add-on therapy during a 3-month period. Olanzapine (2.5-20.0 mg/day) was administered to 25 consecutive patients (24 females, 1 male) meeting the American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia, and who were receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; 68%), benzodiazepines/zolpidem (48%), antidepressants (32%), and cyclobenzaprine (4%), either alone or in combination. Overall, 6 of the 14 patients (43%) who completed the 12-week trial reported to be much or very much improved ('responders'), according to the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale and 7 of them (50%) reported a good or very good sense of well-being. Olanzapine's modal dose among responders was 10.0 mg/day. It was discontinued in 11 patients (44%) due to adverse reactions, most commonly weight gain (n=5, 20%). Our preliminary findings suggest a possible role for olanzapine in treating fibromyalgia. Unfortunately, the beneficial outcome of olanzapine was largely obscured by its poor tolerability, which could be explained by the greater propensity of patients with fibromyalgia to adverse drug reactions, and the greater risk of antipsychotic-induced weight gain among women. Whether other atypical antipsychotics will provide similar symptomatic relief, while showing a better tolerability profile than olanzapine in patients with fibromyalgia, should be further investigated.", 
    "119": "In an open-label study, 13 patients taking depot antipsychotic medication for greater than 3 years were switched to oral olanzapine. The first 3-month experience has been previously reported. We now describe a second 3-month experience and integrate our observations into a cumulative 6-month report. Monthly, we assessed patients using clinical ratings [Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), and Clinical Global Improvement Scale (CGI)] and side effect parameters [Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry psychotropic side effect rating scale (AMDP-5), and weights]. Olanzapine patients showed statistically significant improvement (baseline to endpoint sixth month) in GAF (p=0.015), MMSE (p=0.022), CGI improvement, and AIMS (p=0.038). There was no statistically significant change in PANSS, CGI severity, or AMDP-5 overall side effects. Weight gain over 6 months averaged 8.9 lb. All patients completed the study. Compliance was estimated at 90%, and 81% of patients chose to continue on the oral olanzapine. One patient was hospitalized at the conclusion of the study. Our findings suggest that clinicians may consider oral olanzapine as a viable alternative to depot antipsychotic medications, balancing clinical improvement in some clinical measures with lack of improvement in other clinical measures; and balancing improvement in abnormal involuntary movements with weight gain and its sequelae.", 
    "120": "Repeated administration of phencyclidine (PCP) induces behavioral sensitization to dopaminergic neural transmission. This phenomenon has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Recently, GABAergic agonists have been shown to reduce behavioral activity induced by enhanced dopaminergic neural transmission, which is mediated by the GABA(A)/benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor complex. Thus, to investigate the role of BZD receptors during induction and expression of behavioral sensitization in PCP-sensitized animals, the effects of both single and repeated PCP administration on BZD receptors in rat brain were examined using in vitro quantitative autoradiography. Repeated PCP administration failed to significantly alter levels of [3H]flunitrazepam (FNZ) binding in any of the regions examined. However, significant increases in levels of [3H]FNZ binding were found in the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum 1 h after single administration of PCP. These results suggest that BZD binding sites may not play important roles in the development of PCP-induced sensitization at several sites of GABA(A)/BZD receptor complex, while changes in GABA function in the nucleus accumbens differ from other areas following single administration of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist.", 
    "121": "The effects of clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol on ethanol-induced striatal ascorbic acid (AA) release in mice were compared by using microdialysis coupled to high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Ethanol (4.0 g/kg i.p.) significantly stimulated striatal AA release by about 200% of baseline in mice. Clozapine and olanzapine, two atypical neuroleptic drugs, at the dose of 1.0 mg/kg s.c., had no effect on basal AA or ethanol-induced AA release. However, both drugs, at the dose of 10 mg/kg s.c., significantly inhibited ethanol-induced AA release. In contrast, haloperidol, a typical neuroleptic drug, at the doses of 0.1-2.0 mg/kg, had no effect on both basal and ethanol-induced AA release. The present study demonstrated that similar actions were exhibited by clozapine and olanzapine, but not by haloperidol, for the regulation of ethanol-induced AA release in the mouse striatum.", 
    "122": "The relationship between anterograde amnesia, sedation and plasma levels of benzodiazepines was studied prospectively in a group of 24 patients who took an overdose of benzodiazepines. Patients were tested on two sequential days after having taken an overdose. Anterograde amnesia was tested by using a verbal recall test and a photo recognition test. Sedation was scored on a visual analogue scale (VAS) by the patient and the interviewer. The concentration of benzodiazepines in plasma was measured by using a radioreceptor assay that adds benzodiazepines and their active metabolites. The cumulative amount of benzodiazepines was expressed as diazepam equivalents (DZE). Diazepam equivalents determined by this radioreceptor assay were significantly higher on the first day than on the second day. Ratings on the verbal recall test were significantly lower on the first day than on the second day. There was a significant relation between decrease of diazepam equivalents and increase of verbal recall: more than 30% of increase of verbal recall was explained by decrease of diazepam equivalents. There was not a strong relation between decrease of diazepam equivalents and reduction of level of sedation as scored by the patients. There was almost no relation between decrease of diazepam equivalents and reduction of level of sedation as scored by the interviewer. No relation was found between verbal recall, sedation and diazepam equivalents. There was no relation between diazepam equivalents and photo recognition. It was concluded that anterograde amnesia was strongly associated with benzodiazepines in patients who take benzodiazepines in an overdose. Sedation does not predict the degree of anterograde amnesia.",

A cross-sectional assessment of a randomly selected cohort of patients (n=225; mean age=42+/-7 years; mean length of illness=20.4+/-7.5 years) with DSM-IV schizophrenia was employed using standard rating instruments for catatonia, drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), and psychotic, depressive, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Using a rather narrow definition of catatonia [the presence of four or more signs/symptoms with at least one having a score '2' or above on the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS)], 72 subjects (32%) met the criteria for the catatonia group (mean number of catatonic signs/symptoms=5.9+/-2.0; mean sum score of 8.7+/-3.4 on the BFCRS). The frequency distribution of catatonic signs/symptoms in the catatonic group and in the whole sample was very similar, with mannerisms, grimacing, stereotypes, posturing, and mutism being the most frequent. In the logistic regression analysis, catatonic subjects had a significantly earlier age of onset, more negative symptoms, and were more likely to receive benzodiazepines than their noncatatonic counterparts. In multiple regression analysis, the severity of catatonia as indicated by the sum score of BFCRS was predicted only by earlier age of onset and negative symptoms. Using relatively narrow criteria, this study confirmed that, if methodically assessed, catatonic signs and symptoms are prevalent in patients with chronic schizophrenia. Catatonia can be differentiated from EPS. Catatonic features indicate a generally poor prognosis in the chronic phase of schizophrenia.",

    "148": "A sensitive and specific method was developed for quantification of alprazolam and its two metabolites 4-hydroxyalprazolam and alpha-hydroxyalprazolam in plasma. The work up procedure was solid phase extraction. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used for separation, detection and quantification of the analytes. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 0.05 ng/mL for alprazolam and the two metabolites. The extraction recovery was more than 82% for alprazolam and its metabolites. The within- and between-assay coefficients of variation were in the range of 1.9-17.9%. The method was used for determination of the pharmacokinetics parameters of alprazolam and its two metabolites in healthy Caucasian subjects who ingested 1mg of alprazolam.", 
    "149": "A 4-year-old female patient with epilepsy with continuous spike-and-waves during slow-wave sleep not classified as Landau-Klefner syndrome, refractory to antiepileptic drugs including valproate, benzodiazepines, and lamotrigine, was treated successfully with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone therapy. Valproate, clobazam, and lamotrigine were continued at the same dose during and after high-dose intravenous corticosteroid therapy. During corticosteroid therapy, awake and sleep electroencephalogram was recorded every day. On day 7, a dramatic clinical and electroencephalographic response was observed. After high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, prednisolone was administered orally (2 mg/kg daily) for 2 months, then gradually withdrawn. After the withdrawal of corticosteroid therapy, the patient maintained the clinical improvement in behavior, and no continuous spike-and-wave electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep occurred on routine monthly sleep electroencephalogram performed for the last 6 months. In the present case, an add-on high-dose intravenous corticosteroid seems to be effective in the treatment of patients with electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep syndrome, especially when antiepileptic drugs fail.", 
    "150": "Abused drugs are of grave concern throughout the world for a variety of reasons. Although impressive advances have been made, there are many unknown mechanistic aspects. This report presents a novel hypothesis based on a unifying theme for action of the major classes of abused drugs, in addition to commonly abused therapeutic drugs. The approach is based on electron transfer (ET), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and oxidative stress (OS). It is significant that physiologically active substances generally incorporate ET functionalities, either per se, or more usually in their metabolites. In order to achieve ET in vivo, the reduction potential must be more positive than -0.5 V, which is the case for metabolites of abused drugs, except for special cases. Since the ET process is catalytic, only small quantities of agent are needed for generation of large amounts of ROS during redox cycyling. Bioaction with cellular materials could entail ET alone or participation of ROS. In the abused category, among the main classes of ET functionalities are quinones and iminiums, with alpha-dicarbonyl and nitroxyl radical being rarer. Nicotine yields nicotine iminium, myosmine iminium, and DNA base iminium via alkylation by a metabolic nitrosamine. In the case of alcohol, diacetyl (an alpha-dicarbonyl) is formed, which can lead to conjugated imine (or iminium) by condensation with pri-amine of protein. Phencyclidine is unusual since the iminium product is non-conjugated. However, data indicate that the conformation present at the binding site can accommodate delocalization of the derived radical. For cocaine, various metabolites may play a role: iminium, nitroxyl radical, nitrosonium and formaldehyde. Dealkylation of the ether moiety of ecstasy provides a catechol function capable of redox cycling with the o-quinone partner. Amphetamine and methamphetamine also appear to function by way of the catechol route, as well as morphine and heroin. Tetrahydrocannabinol produces an epoxide, a functionality capable of DNA base alkylation accompanied by ROS. LSD undergoes oxidation to a phenol which may be a quinone precursor. Therapeutic drugs display the indicated metabolic relationships: benzodiazepines, iminium; phenytoin, quinone; phenobarbital, catechol; aspirin, catechol and hydroquinone; acetaminophen, iminoquinone. Extensive evidence exists for formation of ROS, organ injury by OS, depletion of AOs, and protection by AOs for the various drugs. There is also discussion of computational approaches, addiction mechanism and prevention, and health promotion.", 
    "151": "Hepatic encephalopathy is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome, which derives from liver failure associated with severe liver damage such as fulminant hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, and vascular abnormalities associated with liver cirrhosis. Although the cause is explained by a multifactorial theory, the accumulation of ammonia has traditionally been considered to have an important role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. In addition, a number of other possible mechanisms have recently proposed, including production of false neurotransmitter, activation of central gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine receptors by ligands of endogenous origin, altered cerebral metabolism. These pathogenetic mechanisms are not necessarily exclusive. The principle of treatment is to remove or correct aggravating factors and inhibit the transfer of toxic substances such as ammonia into the bloodstream by minimizing the interaction of intestinal bacteria and nitrogen substances. Most treatments of proved value are based on the ammonia hypothesis. Ammonia metabolism is regulated by numerous factors, among which zinc has long been indicated to be involved, and its clinical application has drawn attention recently.",

    "156": "Genomic instability has been implicated as an important component in tumor progression. Evaluation of mutant frequencies (MFs) in tumors of transgenic mice containing nontranscribed marker genes should be useful for quantitating mutation rates in tumors as the physiologically inactive transgene provides neither a positive nor a negative selective pressure on the tumor. We have conducted long-term carcinogenicity studies in lambda/cII transgenic B6C3F1 mice using a variety of genotoxic and nongenotoxic test agents and have evaluated the mutant frequencies in both tumors and normal tissues from these animals. Mice were administered diethylnitrosamine (DEN) as three intraperitoneal injections of 15 mg/kg; phenobarbital (PB) or oxazepam (OXP) provided ad libitum at 0.1% or 0.25% in the diet, respectively; DEN initiation plus PB in the diet; or urethane (UTH) provided ad libitum at 0.2% in the drinking water. Normal tissues and tumors were isolated at various times over a 2-year period and half of each tissue/tumor was evaluated histopathologically and the other half was evaluated for MF in the cII transgene. Approximately 20 mutants from each of 166 individual tissues (tumor and nontumor) were sequenced to determine whether increases in MF represented unique mutations or were due to clonal expansion. UTH produced significant increases in MF in normal liver and lung. DEN either with or without PB promotion produced significant increases in MF in liver and correction of MF for clonality produced little change in the overall MF in these groups. PB produced a twofold increase in liver MF over controls after 27 weeks of treatment, but a similar increase was not observed with longer dosing times; at later time points, the MF in the PB groups was lower than that of the control group, suggesting that PB is not producing direct DNA damage in the liver. OXP failed to produce an increase in MF over controls, even after 78 weeks of treatment. Selected cases of genomic instability were observed in tumors from all treatments except OXP, with individual liver tumors showing very high MF values even after clonal correction. One rare and interesting finding was noted in a single mouse treated with UTH, where a mammary metastasis had an MF approximately 10-fold greater than the parent tumor, with 75% of the mutations independent, providing strong evidence of genomic instability. There was no clear correlation between tumor phenotype and MF except that pulmonary adenomas generally had higher MFs than normal lung in both genotoxic and nongenotoxic treatment groups. Likewise, there was no correlation between tumor size and MF after correction for clonality. The results presented here demonstrate that individual tumors can show significant genomic instability, with very significant increases in MF that are not attributed to clonal expansion of a single mutant cell.",

These first-time treated patients comprise a subgroup of 570 schizophrenia patients who were part of a cohort of 7,655 patients enrolled in the Intercontinental Schizophrenia Outpatient-Health Outcomes observational study (IC-SOHO). As part of a brief clinical assessment conducted at entry to the study, and after 3 and 6 months of antipsychotic medication, patients were asked to rate their sexual functioning, and the investigator was asked to rate the extent to which the patient had neuroleptic-related loss of libido and sexual dysfunction. After being treated, patients treated with olanzapine showed the lowest prevalence of neuroleptic-induced sexual difficulties. At 3 months, there were significant differences between the treatment groups on neuroleptic-related loss of libido, neuroleptic-related sexual dysfunction and change in patient-rated sexual dysfunction. At 6 months, the difference between the groups on neuroleptic-related loss of libido was statistically significant. There were no significant differences between males and females. Many recent onset patients appear to suffer from problems of sexual functioning. Olanzapine may offer an advantage in this area.", 
    "165": "The pattern of brain metabolic changes produced by olanzapine has yet to be described, despite the theoretical and clinical interest of this new antipsychotic. We studied a group of 17 schizophrenic patients who underwent two fluoro-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) studies under two different conditions: a baseline scan during treatment with either conventional antipsychotics (n=15) or risperidone (n=2) and a second scan performed 17-24 weeks after switching to olanzapine. PET scans were obtained while performing a standard cognitive paradigm (Continuous Performance Test) and analysed by means of Statistical Parametric Mapping. No significant metabolic changes were found in the comparison between pre- and post-olanzapine conditions. A brain map of the statistical power of our design showed that changes up to 3% in the frontal and up to 8% in the occipital region were not likely to exist (1-beta=0.8). The degree of improvement in positive symptoms was related to the amount of activity decrease in the right orbital region and to the amount of activity increase in the primary visual area. Improvement in negative symptoms was associated with an activity increase in the dorsal prefrontal cortex, and a higher baseline activity in both temporal poles. These correlation patterns suggest that the functional mechanism of action of olanzapine may share traits from both typical and atypical neuroleptics.",

By week 26, 37% of olanzapine-treated patients had experienced significant weight gain compared with 14% of aripiprazole-treated patients (p < .001). Statistically significant differences in mean weight change were observed between treatments beginning at week 1 and sustained throughout the study.

Imbalances in individual lipid components, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and serum triglycerides, have each been shown to contribute to this increased risk. Certain psychiatric patient populations, such as those afflicted with schizophrenia, are of particular concern. Psychiatric patients with schizophrenia are naturally at increased risk for dyslipidemia and obesity, in part due to poor diet and sedentary lifestyle, but these conditions can be exacerbated by some antipsychotic medications. Clozapine and olanzapine, for example, appear to be associated with hyperlipidemia, which may be associated with changes in body weight. Other, newer antipsychotic agents may exhibit less liability for weight gain and the development of dyslipidemia. This review is intended to briefly highlight the association between dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease, the changes in serum lipids associated with some antipsychotic agents, and how these changes in serum lipids affect the monitoring of schizophrenia patients.", 
    "172": "Anxiety disorders pose a problem for a significant number of individuals, with a 1-year prevalence rate estimated at 13.1% to 17.1%. Many pharmacologic agents have been used to treat anxiety disorders, and among those in current use are newer benzodiazepines (alprazolam), azapirones (buspirone), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (paroxetine and sertraline), and venlafaxine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). The likely role of abnormal serotonergic neurotransmission in anxiety is widely supported, while the role of norepinephrine is less clear. Still, many lines of evidence support the hypothesis that a perturbation in norepinephrine neurotransmission contributes to the symptoms of anxiety. Therefore, it is conceivable that modulation of both serotonin and norepinephrine systems by dual-reuptake inhibitors may be an advantage in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Given this, the current review examines evidence on the possible role of venlafaxine in the treatment of anxiety disorders. From this review it is clear that venlafaxine is as efficacious as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in treating anxiety, with comparable tolerability. Future research will be valuable in determining if antidepressants that combine pharmacologic actions on serotonergic and noradrenergic systems have advantages over more selective agents in treating anxiety disorders.",

Participants with chronic insomnia (N = 53), completed 2 baseline weeks of sleep diaries, and were randomly assigned to a treatment group for 2 more weeks. In the second phase, PMR/CD participants were assigned to 2 weeks of PMR/CD + SR/SC + SHE while SHE participants continued SHE. Results indicated that PMR/CD had greater effect upon sleep onset than SR/SC and SHE, SR/SC had greater effect on sleep maintenance than PMR/CD, and MED was better than the other treatments.

    "191": "The notion of multiple memory systems based on conscious accessibility has been supported largely by neuropsychological patient studies. Specifically, it was widely held that amnesic patients have impaired explicit memory performance but spared implicit memory performance. However, recent patient studies have called the implicit/explicit memory distinction into question. In this study, normal participants were tested on a visual search task, once after an injection of midazolam, an anesthetic that induces temporary amnesia, and once after an injection of saline. Under the influence of midazolam, participants did not show facilitation in search times for repeated configurations (contextual cuing), although there was a general speed-up in performance across blocks in both the midazolam and saline conditions. Neither the contextual-cuing effect nor the procedural-learning effect was available to subjective experience, yet only one of these was affected by midazolam-induced amnesia. These data call into question the notion that memory systems divide on the basis of subjective experience of consciousness or reportability. Rather, the findings support the contention that anterograde amnesia affects learning that depends on building novel associations in memory and that this deficit does not hinge upon accessibility to consciousness."
