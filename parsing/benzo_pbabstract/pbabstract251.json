    "0": "Dyspnea is a very common symptom in cancer patients. It is an important symptom because it interferes with patient's quality of life and because its treatment is often difficult. Dyspnea may be defined as an uncomfortable awareness of breathing. Diagnosis relies on physical examination, which intends also to assess severity of dyspnea and etiology. In cancer patients many mechanisms may be involved: tumor progression, side effects of treatments, associated disease especially from cardiac or infectious origin. A specific treatment (whenever it is possible) is associated with symptomatic measures. Oxygen therapy is often used. Morphine can decrease the sensation of dyspnea by its central effects and is useful especially in palliative setting. Benzodiazepines reduce anxiety induced by dyspnea. Physiotherapy, support of patient and family must not be neglected.", 
    "1": "The clinical importance of benzodiazepines, barbiturates and general anesthetics, all of which act through the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A neurotransmitter receptor, is testament to its significance as a CNS drug target. These drugs were all developed before there was any understanding of the diversity of this receptor gene family. Recent studies using genetically modified mice and GABA-A receptor-subtype-selective compounds have helped to delineate the function of some of these subtypes, and have revealed that it might be possible to develop a new generation of selective drugs with improved profiles or novel applications.", 
    "2": "Increasingly, atypical antipsychotic drugs are prescribed for elderly patients with symptoms of psychosis and behavioral disturbances. These symptoms often occur in patients with Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, or Parkinson's disease. As the average age of Americans increases, the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease will rise accordingly. Although nonpharmacologic treatments for behavioral disturbances should be tried first, medications often are needed to enable the patient to be adequately cared for. Current guidelines recommend using risperidone and olanzapine to treat psychosis in patients with Alzheimer's dementia. Quetiapine and clozapine are recommended for treatment of psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease. Additional research is needed for a recently approved agent, ziprasidone. To minimize side effects, these medications should be started at low dosages that are increased incrementally. Drug interactions, especially those involving the cytochrome P450 system, must be considered. Clozapine's potentially lethal side effects limit its use in the primary care setting. Informed use of atypical antipsychotic drugs allows family physicians to greatly improve quality of life in elderly patients with dementia and behavior disturbances.", 
    "3": "Evolving pacemaker and device technology now allows the onset pattern of arrhythmias to be identified. It is recognised that some cardiac arrhythmias have a circadian pattern of onset and that ventricular arrhythmias can occur in clusters of electrical storms. The long-term follow-up of patients with an atrial defibrillator suggests that in some patients persistent atrial fibrillation recurrences are not random, but can occur in clusters of 'atrial fibrillation storms'. A case report is used to demonstrate this newly recognised phenomenon.", 
    "4": "The underlying pathophysiological basis of tardive dyskinesia (TD) remains speculative. Haloperidol (HP) inhibits neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) activity in vitro, but has not to date been studied in an intact animal model. Recent animal studies have found that extrapyramidal dysfunction evoked by chronic HP is associated with suppression of striatal cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), as well as plasma nitrogen oxides. Striatal dopamine (DA) is central to motor control, while NO plays an important neuroregulatory role in striatal DA function. Recent case reports suggest that atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine (OLZ), may be effective in reversing TD. Here, rats treated with HP (1.5 mg/kg per day p.o.) for 28 days developed significant vacuous chewing movements (VCMs) together with significant suppression of striatal NOS activity. Acute challenge with OLZ (1 and 2 mg/kg i.p.) significantly reversed both HP-induced VCMs and suppression of striatal NOS activity. Therefore TD may involve attenuation of NO-mediated neuromodulation in the striatum. Reversal of VCMs and NOS suppression with OLZ suggests that disinhibition of striatal NOS activity may underlie the clinical benefit of OLZ in TD.", 
    "5": "Current animal models of antipsychotic activity that have the capacity to dissociate between typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) have two drawbacks: they require previous administration of a psychotomimetic drug, and they achieve the dissociation by demonstrating effectiveness of atypical but not typical APDs, thus losing specificity and selectivity for APDs. The present experiments were designed to solve these problems by using two non-pharmacological tests: latent inhibition (LI), in which potentiation of the deleterious effects of non-reinforced stimulus pre-exposure on its subsequent conditioning served as a behavioral index for a common action of typical and atypical APDs (antipsychotic), and the forced swim test (FST), in which reduction of immobility served as a behavioral index for a dissimilar action of these drugs (antidepressant). The typical APD haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg), the atypical APDs clozapine (2.5 mg/kg) and olanzapine (0.6 mg/kg), and the antidepressants imipramine (10 mg/kg) and paroxetine (7.0 mg/kg), produced distinct patterns of action in the two tests: haloperidol potentiated LI and increased immobility in the FST, clozapine and olanzapine potentiated LI and decreased immobility in the FST, and imipramine and paroxetine decreased immobility in the FST and did not potentiate LI. Thus, the comparison of drug effects in LI and FST enabled a discrimination between typical and atypical APDs without losing selectivity for APDs.", 
    "6": "Muscarinic cholinergic activation is a critical component of basolateral amygdala (BLA)-mediated modulation of memory consolidation. The receptor(s) mediating this activation during consolidation have not been elucidated. This study investigated the roles of muscarinic subtype 1 (m1) and subtype 2 (m2) receptors in memory enhancement, by post-training intra-BLA infusions of the non-selective muscarinic agonist oxotremorine. Rats received intra-BLA infusions of either oxotremorine alone (10 microg in 0.2 microl per side), oxotremorine together with the selective m1 antagonist telenzipine (1.7, 5.0, 17 or 50 nmol/side), oxotremorine with the selective m2 antagonist methoctramine (1.7, 5.0, 17 or 50 nmol/side), oxotremorine with a combination of the above doses of telenzipine and methoctramine, or only vehicle, immediately after inhibitory avoidance training. Performance on a 48-hour retention test was significantly enhanced in oxotremorine-treated rats relative to vehicle-infused controls. Intra-BLA co-infusion of oxotremorine with either telenzipine (5, 17 or 50 nmol/side) or methoctramine (17 or 50 nmol/side) blocked the oxotremorine-induced enhancement. Combinations of these antagonists did not act additively to block memory enhancement by oxotremorine. These findings indicate that modulation of memory consolidation induced by cholinergic influences within the BLA requires activation of both m1 and m2 receptor synapses. Plausible mechanisms for m1- and m2-mediated influences on BLA circuitry are discussed.", 
    "7": "In experimental conditions, golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) avidly consume ethanol solutions. However, they are relatively resistant to the deleterious effects of ethanol even after months of continuous consumption, apparently because they metabolize ethanol rapidly and efficiently. Male hamsters with ad libitum access to food and water were presented with isocaloric solutions [weight/weight (wt./wt.)] of 10% ethanol and 17.75% glucose for 40-min periods on alternate days. When hamsters were injected with 0.9% saline before solution presentation the mean intake of ethanol solution (0.55 g) was about half that of glucose solution (1.08 g). Hamsters derived a mean of 0.36 g/kg/40 min of absolute ethanol from the ethanol solution, an amount that does not seem to exceed their metabolic capacity for ethanol. An intraperitoneal injection of a 2.0-microg/kg dose of the C-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin (CCK-8) reduced intakes of both solutions by >50% if administered 5 min before solution presentation, but it was ineffectual if administered 45 min before presentation. When citric acid (2.5 g/l) was added to the glucose solution the baseline intakes of the two solutions were virtually equivalent, and when CCK-8 was administered over a range of doses (0.5-2.0 microg/kg) the intakes of the solutions did not differ significantly at any dose, supporting the suggestion that the pharmacological properties of ethanol play little or no role in mediating the consumption-inhibiting effect of exogenously administered cholecystokinin (CCK). Prior administration of lorglumide, a selective CCK type A receptor antagonist, completely attenuated the inhibitory effect of CCK-8. Findings are consistent with the notion that endogenous CCK plays a key role in the short-term control of ethanol intake in hamsters.", 
    "8": "This study assessed the effect of the central benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, 8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (flumazenil), on morphine-induced analgesia, locomotor effects, and development of tolerance in rats. The thermally evoked pain (tail flick) response was determined after acute and chronic intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of morphine and flumazenil, alone and in combination. In acute studies, flumazenil induced weak analgesia unrelated to dose and sex, whereas morphine-induced analgesia was dependent on both dose and sex (male>female). Flumazenil dose-dependently enhanced the analgesic effect of morphine in female but not in male rats. Isobolographic analysis suggested synergism between flumazenil and morphine in female rats, but antagonism in male rats. Flumazenil-induced locomotor changes (alone and with morphine) were related to sex but not dose. Chronic coadministration of flumazenil with morphine enhanced analgesia and attenuated tolerance development in female rats. The findings suggest a possible role for flumazenil as an adjunct with opioids in acute and chronic pain therapy.", 
    "9": "Presynaptic H3 receptors exert negative control on brain histamine synthesis and release and may thereby play a key role in the control of the sleep/wake cycle. This suggests that pharmacological stimulation by H3 receptor agonists may potentially decrease wakefulness and induce sleep. This study reports the effect of a potent and selective H3 agonist, immepip, on EEG assessed sleep/wake phases in Sprague-Dawley rats at doses that significantly modulate brain histamine release. Immepip injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 5 or 10 mg kg(-1) induced a sustained decrease in cortical histamine efflux as measured by in vivo microdialysis. In a separate experiment, rats were prepared for EEG/EMG recording and evaluated during the dark phase of their light/dark cycle. The results showed that the same i.p. doses of 5 and 10 mg kg(-1) of immepip was devoid of any significant impact on the sleep/wake phases (active awake, drowsiness and slow wave sleep), except for a slight, albeit significant, decrease in sleep onset latency. These results reveal that a marked H3 receptor agonist-mediated reduction in cortical histamine release is not corroborated by a significant sleep promoting effect and therefore question the hypnotic potential of H3 agonists.", 
    "10": "It has been proposed that the ascending dorsal raphe (DR)-serotonergic (5-HT) pathway facilitates conditioned avoidance responses to potential or distal threat, while the DR-periventricular 5-HT pathway inhibits unconditioned flight reactions to proximal danger. Dysfunction on these pathways would be, respectively, related to generalized anxiety (GAD) and panic disorder (PD). To investigate this hypothesis, we microinjected into the rat DR the benzodiazepine inverse receptor agonist FG 7142, the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT or the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol. Animals were evaluated in the elevated T-maze (ETM) and light/dark transition test. These models generate defensive responses that have been related to GAD and PD. Experiments were also conducted in the ETM 14 days after the selective lesion of DR serotonergic neurons by 5,7-dihydroxytriptamine (DHT). In all cases, rats were pre-exposed to one of the open arms of the ETM 1 day before testing. The results showed that FG 7142 facilitated inhibitory avoidance, an anxiogenic effect, while impairing one-way escape, an anxiolytic effect. 8-OH-DPAT, muscimol, and 5,7-DHT-induced lesions acted in the opposite direction, impairing inhibitory avoidance while facilitating one-way escape from the open arm. In the light/dark transition, 8-OH-DPAT and muscimol increased the time spent in the lighted compartment, an anxiolytic effect. The data supports the view that distinct DR-5-HT pathways regulate neural mechanisms underlying GAD and PD.", 
    "11": "Data from several studies suggest that unrestrained secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone in the CNS produces several signs and symptoms of depression. Recent evidence indicates that blockade of the CRH receptor 1 reduced depression scores in depressed patients. One of the symptoms that occur is depression is impairment in attentional processes. Whether these impairments are due to alterations in the CRH system are so far unknown. In order to investigate whether overproduction of CRH alters attentional process, transgenic mice overproducing CRH were tested on an operant five choice serial reaction time task, a task which taxes sustained and divided attention. Mutants showed impaired autoshaping. During initial discrimination learning, transgenics performed below wildtype level, but with extended training with long stimulus durations, transgenic animals reached similar accuracy levels as wildtype mice. When animals were tested at shortest stimulus duration (0.5s), a mild but significant impairment in accurate responding emerged in transgenics. This was accompanied by longer correct response latencies, while incorrect latencies did not differ between groups, suggesting attentional impairment in CRH transgenics. Because these animals have been reported to also show increased anxiety-related behaviour, animals were treated with the anxiolytic benzodiazepine diazepam. Diazepam failed to affect accuracy, but transgenic mice showed a stronger behavioural disinhibition. This suggests that the attentional impairment seen in CRH overexpressors is independent of alterations in anxiety-like behaviour. These findings may have implications for understanding the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders such as depression, where it has been suggested that an overactivity of the CRH system accounts for a variety of symptoms, including hyper-arousal and attentional impairment.", 
    "12": "Benzodiazepine (diazepam), triazolobenzodiazepines (brotizolam, triazolam) and platelet activating factor (PAF) antagonist (BN 52021) are administered to mice before acquisition and retrieval trials conducted using Morris water maze. Benzodiazepine has produced only anterograde amnesia and it has not produced retrograde amnesia. Triazolobenzodiazepines have produced both anterograde and retrograde amnesia. PAF antagonist (BN 52021) has only produced retrograde amnesia and it has not produced anterograde amnesia. The anterograde amnesia produced by benzodiazepine and triazolobenzodiazepines, has been prevented by benzodiazepine receptor antagonist (flumazenil). It suggests that benzodiazepine- and triazolobenzodiazepines-induced anterograde amnesia may be mediated through benzodiazepine receptors. On the other hand, retrograde amnesia produced by PAF antagonist (BN 52021) and triazolobenzodiazepines has been attenuated by PAF and PAF acetyl hydrolase inhibitors such as cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and phenylmethanesulfonylflouride. It suggests that triazolobenzodiazepine-induced retrograde amnesia may be mediated through blockade of PAF receptors.", 
    "13": "A sensitive and reliable high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay is a prerequisite for pharmacokinetic analysis of continuous infusion of levomepromazine adjuvant to midazolam. We developed such a method to determine the levels of levomepromazine, midazolam and their major metabolites (levomepromazinesulfoxide, desmethyl-, didesmethyllevomepromazine, O-desmethyllevomepromazine and alpha-hydroxy-midazolam) simultaneously. Desmethylclomipramine was used as an internal standard (I.S.). The lower limit of quantification of this assay was set for levomepromazine 4.1 microg/l, levomepromazinesulfoxide 4.9 microg/l, O-desmethyllevomepromazine 18.4 microg/l, alpha-hydroxymidazolam 26.6 microg/l, midazolam 23.4 microg/l, didesmethyllevomepromazine 15.8 microg/l, and desmethyllevomepromazine 6.6 microg/l. The between- and within day assay variations were commonly below 5%. The recovery in human plasma for the different analytes varied between 85 and 11%. The accuracy of this assay varied between 95 and 105% for the different concentrations. The linearity of this assay was set between 25 and 800 microg/l (r(2)>0.999 of the regression line). The first results of pharmacokinetic analysis of midazolam indicated that half-life varied between 1.1 and 1.9 h. Pharmacokinetic analysis using a one-compartment model of levomepromazine revealed that the apparent volume of distribution was 4.1+/-2.4 l per kg lean body mass and the metabolic clearance was 309+/-225 l per hour per 70 kg. This assay proved to be robust and reproducible. It can reliably be used for further study of the pharmacokinetics of continuous infusion of levomepromazine.", 
    "14": "We have previously shown that cryopreservation leads to increased apoptotic death of porcine hepatocytes intended for use in a bioartificial liver (BAL). This study was designed to determine if a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, IDN-1965, reduced apoptosis and increased function of cryopreserved porcine hepatocytes in static culture or in a BAL. Porcine hepatocytes were studied immediately after isolation and after 2 weeks of cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen using medium supplemented with 25 micromol/L IDN-1965 or vehicle. Both apoptotic and necrotic cells were observed in cultures of fresh and cryopreserved hepatocytes, but the percentage of apoptotic cells increased after cryopreservation. Cryopreservation in IDN-1965 improved hepatocyte viability and reduced apoptotic cell death determined by TUNEL assay. Cryopreservation of hepatocytes in IDN-1965 was also associated with reduced caspase 3-like activity, decreased release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and a slower decline in mitochondrial membrane potential after thawing. These markers of apoptosis were lowest after cryopreservation when IDN-1965 was added to both the culture and cryopreservation medium. Functional markers of hepatocyte activity (albumin production, diazepam metabolism, urea production) were also increased after cryopreservation and culture of hepatocytes in medium supplemented with 25 micromol/L IDN-1965. Cryopreservation of porcine hepatocytes in the presence of caspase inhibitor IDN-1965 was associated with reduced apoptosis and improved function of porcine hepatocytes in both static culture and a perfused BAL. These data demonstrate that inhibition of apoptosis also preserves cell function.", 
    "15": "To assess the cost and effectiveness of risperidone, olanzapine, and conventional antipsychotic medications under \"usual practice\" conditions in a large, public mental health system, 108 persons diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomly assigned to one of these three medication groups and followed prospectively over a 12-month period using standard instruments and procedures. Psychiatric medication costs increased more over time in both the olanzapine and risperidone groups than in the conventional medication group. Compliance with the prescribed medication was higher in the olanzapine group than in the conventional group. No differential effects by medication group were evident in this sample on the symptoms of schizophrenia, side effects, psychosocial functioning, time to discharge for index hospitalization, survival to initial rehospitalization, or client satisfaction with services. These results extend findings from previous efficacy and naturalistic studies in several ways but are limited chiefly by the small number of subjects who completed 6 to 12 months of the clinical trial, and the resulting power to detect differences in the statistical analyses.", 
    "16": "In today's medical community, there is growing concern about substance use among physicians, not only because of their own health, but also because of the potential adverse effects on their clinical practices. Physicians affect public health both by treatment and preventive studies and as role models. Prevalence data concerning substance abuse are generally lacking. There is no consensus on the rates of substance abuse being higher among physicians than among the general public. Physicians are less likely to smoke cigarettes and use illicit substances (like marijuana, cocaine and heroin) and more likely to use alcohol and two types of prescription medications--benzodiazepines and minor opioids--compared with their age groups. Doctors are at special risk of developing addiction problems owing to the strain of medical practice, erosion of the taboo against injecting and using opiates, and particularly access to supplies. The most common precipitating factors mentioned are physical pain and illness, usually chronic, with family tragedy such as death of a wife or child next. The third most common factor is an addicted wife. Stress, overwork and marital problems are also mentioned. No data were found about physicians' substance use in Turkey. This article generally aims to review the knowledge on the prevalence of substance use among physicians, the drug of choice, the development of dependence, the treatment and prognosis and to discuss the importance of this issue by evaluating three cases treated at the Alcohol and Drug Addiction Treatment and Research Center (AMATEM), Bakirk\u00f6y State Hospital for Mental and Neurological Diseases.", 
    "17": "Trifluoromethoxy-substituted anilines undergo hydrogen/lithium permutation (\"metalation\") with optional site selectivity depending on the N-protective group employed. N-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-2- and -4-(trifluoromethoxy)aniline react with tert-butyllithium at the nitrogen-adjacent 6- and 2-position affording, after electrophilic trapping, products 1-6. In contrast, deprotonation of the para isomer occurs at the oxygen-neighboring 3-position, giving rise to the acid 12, when the amino group is carrying two trimethylsilyl groups. sec-Butyllithium attacks 3-trifluoromethoxy-N-mono(trimethylsilyl)aniline at the 2-position, but 3-trifluoromethoxy-N,N-bis(trimethylsilyl)aniline at the 4-position to provide respectively the acids 10 and 11 after carboxylation. The synthesis of two new benzodiazepines illustrates (19 and 22) the preparative potential of the aniline functionalization mediated by organometallic reagents.", 
    "18": "Between 1987 and 1997, we chemically immobilized 597 wild sea otters (Enhydra lutris) in Alaska for the collection of biological samples or for surgical instrumentation. One drug-related sea otter fatality occurred during this time. Fentanyl in combination with diazepam produced consistent, smooth inductions with minimal need for supplemental anesthetics during procedures lasting 30-40 min. Antagonism with naltrexone or naloxone was rapid and complete, although we observed narcotic recycling in sea otters treated with naloxone. For surgical procedures, we recommend a fentanyl target dose of 0.33 mg/kg of body mass and diazepam at 0.11 mg/kg. For nonsurgical biological sample collection procedures, we recommend fentanyl at 0.22 mg/kg and diazepam at 0.07 mg/kg. We advise the use of the opioid antagonist naltrexone at a ratio of 2:1 to the total fentanyl administered during processing.", 
    "19": "This study investigated preserved memory in 26 pediatric cancer patients (65% boys, 77% Caucasian, mean age = 12.5 years) undergoing midazolam-induced conscious sedation during painful medical procedures to treat hematological or oncological diseases. The sedative midazolam had a significant anterograde amnesic effect on participants' performance on a visual recognition (explicit) memory task but not on a visual perceptual facilitation (implicit) memory task. That implicit memory scores were relatively unaffected while explicit memory scores deteriorated significantly indicates that leaning occurred while participants were sedated, even when participants did not recollect the learning event. These findings, which replicate those of M. R. Polster, R. A. McCarthy, G. O'Sullivan, P. A. Gray, and G. R. Park (1993) in a study of adults, have implications for the development and treatment of conditioned anxiety reactions associated with aversive medical procedures.", 
    "20": "The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), often used to study cardiovascular disease processes, may also be utilized to model certain central nervous system changes associated with memory disorders. Previous work in our laboratory indicated that central nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are markedly diminished and that memory-related task performance is impaired in this rodent phenotype. Due to the well-documented importance of the central cholinergic system to memory processes and its vulnerability to the effects of aging, it was of interest to measure other cholinergic markers and to further evaluate memory function in older SHRs.",

Immunoblotting experiments were also used to determine the expression of the presynaptic cholinergic markers, choline acetyltransferase and the vesicular acetylcholine transporter.", 
    "22": "Radial arm maze performance was impaired in hypertensive (compared with normotensive Wistar and Wistar-Kyoto) rats, regardless of age. M1 binding was increased in frontal and prefrontal cortical areas in SHR (p < 0.05), whereas M2 densities were higher in the hypertensive phenotype in the caudate putamen. A lower expression of alpha3-containing nicotinic receptors was observed in the superior colliculus in SHRs. Age-related differences in the expression of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter were noted in the hippocampus.",

Sociodemographics and severity of illness at admission were similar in groups taking olanzapine (N = 66), quetiapine (N = 41), and risperidone (N = 147). The mean LOS for risperidone was significantly shorter than that for quetiapine (12.3 vs. 16.4 days, respectively; P < .02), but the difference between risperidone and olanzapine did not reach statistical significance (12.3 vs. 14.9 days, respectively; P < .08).

    "30": "Previous work had indicated that animals that were sleep-deprived and then trained on a passive avoidance task show poor retention of the task 24 h later after being allowed to sleep freely again. Cholinergic involvement is suggested by the fact that this effect is prevented by treatment with the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine during sleep deprivation. The observation that similar deficits are observed in non-deprived rats after treatment with M1-selective antagonist compounds such as dicyclomine or pirenzepine cause similar impairments, and gave rise to the hypothesis that sleep deprivation might induce significant reductions in M1 binding in brain areas involved in learning and memory processes. Rats were deprived of sleep for 96 h and then either immediately killed, or allowed to recover sleep for 24 h before being killed. [3H]pirenzepine binding to M1 sites was examined by quantitative autoradiography in 39 different brain areas in cage controls, sleep-deprived and sleep-recovered animals (N=8 per group). No significant differences among groups were found in any brain region. A separate group of animals was subjected to the sleep deprivation procedure and then trained in a simple avoidance task. Animals were then allowed to sleep and retested 24 h later. This group showed a significant impairment in the avoidance task compared to cage controls, in agreement with previous observations. These data suggest that proactive learning/memory deficits induced by sleep deprivation cannot be attributed to altered M1 binding either immediately after deprivation (when avoidance training occurs) or after sleep has recovered (when acquisition/retention are tested). The possibility remains that alterations in M1 function occur at post-membrane second messenger systems.",

Twenty-one patients unresponsive to treatment with paroxetine, administered for at least 12 weeks at the dose of 60 mg/day, participated to a 12-week open-label, add-on trial with olanzapine (10 mg/day). The psychopathological state was evaluated by the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and by Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Three patients did not complete the 12-week adjunctive treatment with olanzapine. In the 18 completers, the mean Y-BOCS score decreased significantly from 27.1+/-4.0 at baseline to 20.1+/-3.9 at final evaluation (P<.001). Seven patients (38.9%) were rated as responders at final evaluation. Steady-state plasma concentrations of paroxetine were not modified during olanzapine coadministration. The drug combination was generally well tolerated and initial sedation and weight gain were the most frequent unwanted effects.

Different drug concentrations, maximum manufacturing temperatures, and cooling rates were investigated. It was found to be possible to increase the dissolution rate of diazepam by melt agglomeration. A higher dissolution rate was obtained with a lower drug concentration. Admixing the binders by the melt-in procedure resulted in similar dissolution rates as the pump-on procedure. The different maximum manufacturing temperatures and cooling rates were found to have complex effects on the dissolution rate for formulations containing PEG 3000, whereas only minor effects of the cooling procedure were found with Gelucire 50/13. Gelucire 50/13 resulted in faster dissolution rates compared to PEG 3000.", 
    "37": "Hamsters are highly dependent upon the central actions of progesterone (P4) for facilitation of sexual behaviour. In the ventral tegmental area (VTA), P4 has actions through its neurosteroid metabolite 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP). The effects of enhancing or inhibiting neurosteroidogenesis (and thereby 3alpha,5alpha-THP concentrations), through manipulations of mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors, in the VTA on socio-sexual behaviour of female hamsters were examined. Intact, naturally receptive hamsters and ovariectomized (OVX), hormone-primed hamsters were unilaterally infused via chronic guide cannula to the VTA with the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor antagonist 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboximide (PK-11195) or the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor agonist, N,N-dihexyl-2-(4-fluorophenyl)indole-30-acetamide (FGIN 1-27) and tested for sexual responsiveness and lordosis. PK-11195 (5.6, 11.2 or 22.4 nm) to the VTA attenuated sexual responsiveness of naturally receptive or oestradiol benzoate (EB) + P4-primed hamsters compared to vehicle. In addition, FGIN 1-27 (11.4 nm) infusions to the VTA increased sexual responsiveness and lordosis of cycling or OVX, EB + P4-primed hamsters, compared to vehicle infusions. In OVX, EB + P4-primed hamsters, decrements in sexual responsiveness produced by VTA infusions of PK-11195 (5.6 nm) were attenuated by VTA infusions of 3alpha,5alpha-THP. VTA infusions of PK-11195 (5.6 nm) or FGIN 1-27 (11.4 nm), respectively, decreased and increased midbrain levels of 3alpha,5alpha-THP compared to each other. Together, these findings indicate that manipulating actions of mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors in the VTA can augment and inhibit neurosteroidogenesis and sexual responsiveness of hormone-primed and naturally receptive hamsters.", 
    "38": "Benzodiazepines reduce EEG slow-wave activity in non-REM sleep by potentiating GABAergic neurotransmission at GABAA receptors via a modulatory binding site. However, the mechanisms of action underlying the effects of benzodiazepines on sleep and the sleep EEG are still unknown. Slow waves during sleep are generated by the corticothalamic system and synchronized by the inhibitory GABAergic neurons of the reticular thalamic nucleus. This region contains exclusively alpha3-containing GABAA receptors. We investigated the role of these receptors in the mediation of diazepam effects on the sleep EEG by studying point-mutated mice in which the alpha3-GABAA receptor is diazepam-insensitive [alpha3(H126R)]. Sleep was recorded for 12 h after i.p. injection of 3 mg/kg diazepam or vehicle at light onset in alpha3(H126R) and wild-type controls (n = 13-17 per genotype). The main effect was a marked reduction of slow-wave activity (EEG power density in 0.75-4.00 Hz) in non-REM sleep and a concomitant increase in frequencies above 15.00 Hz in non-REM sleep and waking in both genotypes. Neither effect of diazepam differed significantly between the genotypes. Despite the exclusive expression of alpha3-containing GABAA receptors in the reticular thalamic nucleus, these receptors do not seem to be critical for the mediation of the effects of diazepam on the sleep EEG.", 
    "39": "Status Epilepticus (SE) is a medical emergency and requires prompt and aggressive treatment. Stabilization of airway, breathing and circulation and expeditious termination of seizures are immediate goals. Intravenous benzodiazepines-diazepam, midazolam or lorazepam and phenytoin are the first line drugs recommended for termination of seizures. Diazepam (or midazolam), thiopental and propofol infusion are useful for control of Refractory SE (RSE). Newer drugs are being investigated for use in SE. We prefer diazepam infusion. In children the mortality from SE ranges from 3-10% and the morbidity is twice. Mortality and morbidity are highest with SE associated with CNS infections, which is the most important cause of SE in our country. The outcome depends on the underlying etiology, age, rapidity of SE and adequacy of care. Adherence to a time-framed protocol in the emergency department helps in improving the final outcome.", 
    "40": "Diazepam effects on intracardiac hemodynamics were studied in 45 patients with ischemic heart disease. The patients were divided into 3 groups: a control group (n = 13), a group with a systolic dysfunction (EF < 45%, n = 16) and a group with a diastolic dysfunction (E/A < 1.0, n = 16). Echocardiography was made before and after intravenous injection of 10 mg diazepam (relanium, \"Polfa). The above diazepam injection improved heart rate and diastolic blood pressure in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, cardiac pump function improved in patients with initial diastolic or systolic dysfunction. In the controls these parameters worsened. Diastolic function was not influenced much in all the three groups. Thus, combination of a sedative effect, a moderate positive action on cardiac pump function and no negative impact on diastolic filling characterizes diazepam as a stress-limiting medicine in patients with chronic cardiac failure.", 
    "41": "The Dutch College of General Practitioners' practice guideline 'Delirium in elderly people' contains a number of key messages. These are: Consider the diagnosis of delirium in the case of changes in consciousness and attention, incoherent thinking or disorientation, if this picture developed over a short period of time (hours to days) and if the symptoms vary over the 24-hour period. Delirium is provoked by one or more somatic disorders; investigation and treatment of these disorders is an essential part of managing delirium. It is often difficult to distinguish delirium from dementia and depression. Although delirium is generally reversible, the prognosis in the elderly is relatively poor. If delirium is accompanied by fear or agitation, haloperidol is the drug of first choice, but in delirium induced by alcohol withdrawal or benzodiazepine withdrawal, a short-acting benzodiazepine such as lorazepam or oxazepam is indicated. Part of the treatment, but also prevention of delirium is focused on inducing factors that can provoke a delirium, such as medication with an anticholinergic effect, polypharmacy, inadequate nutrition, dehydration, sleep deprivation, immobility and sensory handicaps.", 
    "42": "Aim of this study was to investigate behavioural and emotional problems in preschool children in relation with behaviour problems during a highly stress provoking dental treatment. Eighty one healthy children between 2 and 4 years referred to the clinic of Special Dental Care (SBT) in Amsterdam were selected, based on dental need (extraction of one or more primary incisors). Each child was sedated with oral midazolam. Their behaviour was rated by registering the degree of acceptance during four consecutive time periods of the dental treatment. Prior to the treatment parents were asked to fill in a questionnaire. No significant correlations between temperament and behaviour were found with the total CBCL profile or its subscales. This confirms the results of earlier studies that the relationship of temperament, dental anxiety and behaviour problems is a complex matter and not yet fully understood. It is also indicated that within the entire treatment a child's behaviour is closely related to its behaviour in the preceded treatment step.", 
    "43": "Manipulation of gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) system has been little studied in Parkinson's disease, despite the fact that GABA subserves a large part of the basal ganglia, including the outflow tracts. To test whether antagonism of GABA could improve features of PD, we administered open label intravenous flumazenil to eight practically defined off patients and assessed UPDRS scores, bilateral 1-minute hand-tapping speed, and timed gait tests. Patients demonstrated significantly greater tapping speed, which peaked 40 minutes after injection (P < 0.05). Total motor Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores modestly improved (P < 0.05). There were no adverse events. Mechanisms by which flumazenil could improve PD are discussed.", 
    "44": "Flunitrazepam (FZ) is a sedative/hypnotic nitro-benzodiazepine. This drug has been accepted by both patients and physicians and in the last 20 years flunitrazepam has been included and studied in many clinical trials so, in many countries, flunitrazepam is one of the most prescribed hypnotic. Since 1980 it has been found that FZ began to be a popular drug among drug abusers all over the word. However, little is known about the difference between Fz and other Benzodiazepines in capacity to produce physiologic dependence or in ability to produce drug taking or drug seeking behaviour. Flunitrazepam has little risk of abuse by the vast majority of patients; however when the drug is taken i. v. or intranasally, its effect is much faster and risk of abuse is much greater. In this report we examine the reasons why some populations of drug abusers prefer flunitrazepam over the other benzodiazepines.",

    "46": "Ideally, animal models of anxiety are validated for the detection of both anxiogenic and anxiolytic effects, but most animal models can effectively only measure anxiolytic-like effects. As control animals typically spend small amounts of time in the aversive portion of an apparatus, decreases in time spent in this portion are difficult to detect.", 
    "47": "We have modified an existing test of murine anxiety, the mirrored chamber, and have validated this test using several anxiolytic and anxiogenic drugs. In addition, nine mouse strains were compared on the elevated plus maze and modified mirrored chamber.", 
    "48": "Increasing doses of ethanol, diazepam, and pentobarbital produced an anxiolytic-like profile while pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), D-amphetamine, and methyl-6, 7-dimethoxyl-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) appeared anxiogenic. This modified test also dissociated drug effects on anxiety from those on activity for d-amphetamine and diazepam. The inbred mouse strains tested produced a similar range of scores for time spent on the open arms of the elevated plus maze and voluntary reentry time in the mirrored chamber, with an overall genetic correlation of 0.68.", 
    "49": "Since control animals reliably reentered the more aversive portion of the apparatus for 25% of the total time available, the modified mirrored chamber may be able to detect anxiogenic states produced by various stressors and drug withdrawal. Further, the strain differences detected suggest that the modified mirrored chamber will be a valuable tool in the discovery of the genetic bases of anxiety states and disorders.",

    "52": "Of 3,407 intubations over 33 months in 22 institutions, 2,380 involved RSI. After correcting for the specialty and experience of the intubator and for the presence of airway aberrancy, the sedative agent was significantly associated with the number of attempts at intubation (p = 0.002). Specifically, the use of etomidate (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.35 [95% CI = 0.17 to 0.72]), ketamine (OR 0.27 [95% CI = 0.11 to 0.65]), a benzodiazepine (OR 0.47 [95% CI = 0.23 to 0.95]), or no sedative agent (OR 0.51 [95% CI = 0.23 to 1.13]) prior to neuromuscular blockade was associated with a lower likelihood of successful intubation on the first attempt, as compared with thiopental, methohexital, or propofol. The adjusted odds ratios for the likelihood of overall success had similar point estimates, but did not reach statistical significance due to lack of power (p = 0.2, with 36 unsuccessful intubations). Among patients receiving etomidate, intubation was more likely to be successful on the first attempt with increasing doses of either etomidate or succinylcholine.", 
    "53": "Thiopental, methohexital, and propofol appear to facilitate RSI in emergency department patients, independent of patient characteristics or intubator training.

Several classes of antiemetics are available, including phenothiazines, butyrophenones, substituted benzamides and selective serotonin antagonists, as well as corticosteroids. Most patients will respond to either single agents or combinations that frequently include corticosteroids. A minority of patients will have nausea that fails to respond. The atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine, relieves nausea in some patients failing to respond to the usual antiemetics. Two case reports are presented and the rationale for olanzapine's benefit is discussed.", 
    "55": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptors mediate most of the fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the CNS. They represent a major site of action for clinically relevant drugs, such as benzodiazepines and ethanol, and endogenous modulators, including neuroactive steroids. Alterations in GABA(A) receptor expression and function are thought to contribute to prevalent neurological and psychiatric diseases. Molecular cloning and immunochemical characterization of GABA(A) receptor subunits revealed a multiplicity of receptor subtypes with specific functional and pharmacological properties. A major tenet of these studies is that GABA(A) receptor heterogeneity represents a key factor for fine-tuning of inhibitory transmission under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. The aim of this review is to highlight recent findings on the regulation of GABA(A) receptor expression and function, focusing on the mechanisms of sorting, targeting, and synaptic clustering of GABA(A) receptor subtypes and their associated proteins, on trafficking of cell-surface receptors as a means of regulating synaptic (and extrasynaptic) transmission on a short-time basis, on the role of endogenous neurosteroids for GABA(A) receptor plasticity, and on alterations of GABA(A) receptor expression and localization in major neurological disorders. Altogether, the findings presented in this review underscore the necessity of considering GABA(A) receptor-mediated neurotransmission as a dynamic and highly flexible process controlled by multiple mechanisms operating at the molecular, cellular, and systemic level. Furthermore, the selected topics highlight the relevance of concepts derived from experimental studies for understanding GABA(A) receptor alterations in disease states and for designing improved therapeutic strategies based on subtype-selective drugs.", 
    "56": "The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril (EPL) (2 and 4 mg/kg), angiotensin (AT) II receptor antagonist losartan (LRN) (5 and 10 mg/kg), and anxiolytic drug diazepam (DZP) (0.5 mg/kg) on anxiety parameters were evaluated in experimentally induced renal hypertensive rats (RHR). Renal hypertension was induced in Wistar strain male albino rats weighing 200-250 g by following the method of Goldblatt. The animals having systolic blood pressure more than 180-210 mm Hg were subjected to open-field exploratory behaviour, elevated plus maze behaviour, and social interaction tests of anxiety. The RHR showed hyperactivity in open-field behaviour and anxiogenicity in elevated plus maze and social interaction tests. Losartan (5 and 10 mg/kg) and DZP (0.5 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the hyperactivity and anxiogenic behaviour in experimentally induced hypertensive rats and induced anxiolysis in normotensive rats (NTR). Enalapril reversed the hypertension-induced alteration only at higher dose (4 mg/kg) and failed to show any effect in NTR. It can be concluded that renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) has a significant role on behaviour, and LRN has shown better effect in reversing the hyperactivity and anxiogenicity in the experimentally induced hypertensive rats, indicating a possible role of AT receptor in the mediation of anxiolysis.", 
    "57": "Prenatal treatment with small doses of diazepam may counteract the effect of physical stress in rats, normalizing the time course of neonatal reflexes and the behavioral responses in adulthood. However, prenatal administration of diazepam in greater doses may induce desensitization of gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) receptors and induce hypersensitivity to convulsants. This study was designed to examine in rats the influence of prenatal or neonatal diazepam treatment on development of neonatal reflexes, as index of brain maturation, and susceptibility to pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions in adulthood. Pregnant Wistar rats were injected with diazepam 2.5 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally (i.p.) on days 14-21 of pregnancy. Offspring showed a delay in the appearing of neonatal reflexes (cliff aversion, forelimb placing, forelimb grasping and bar holding) except for righting and startle reflexes. At 50 days of age, male rats showed a greater sensitivity to pentylenetetrazol compared to controls. In contrast, females showed a decreased susceptibility to convulsions. The appearance of reflexes in pups exposed to diazepam during neonatal life appeared to be similar to that of controls. Only the appearance of cliff aversion and startle reflexes appeared to be delayed in animals exposed neonatally to diazepam as compared to controls. In adulthood, female rats exposed in early neonatal life to diazepam again showed a resistance to pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions as compared to male animals. These data suggest that prenatal exposure to diazepam induces long-lasting behavioral changes, which may be influenced by sex-dependent factors.", 
    "58": "The novel antiepileptic drug levetiracetam has been shown to reverse anxiogenic effects of benzodiazepine withdrawal in mice tested in an elevated plus-maze without altering the behaviour of normal mice in this model. This could suggest that the effect of levetiracetam is dependent upon the level of stress/anxiety of the animals. Levetiracetam was therefore further examined in another widely used animal model of anxiety, the Vogel conflict test. In the first experiment, water-deprived rats were submitted to a free drinking period (habituation) in a chamber equipped with a bottle of water. Twenty-four hours later, animals were returned to the same chamber but the licks to the water bottle were then punished with a foot shock (0.5 mA, 90 ms). In the second experiment, the procedure was modified by administering a foot shock at the end of the habituation period in order to induce a state of stress/anxiety (conditioned fear/ anticipatory anxiety) for subsequent testing. Levetiracetam (17 and 54 mg/kg) and chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) were administered via the intraperitoneal route. The results indicated that in the first experiment only chlordiazepoxide showed a statistically significant anxiolytic effect. In contrast, in the second experiment, where the shock was given at the end of the habituation period, levetiracetam (54 mg/kg) revealed significant anxiolytic activity similar to chlordiazepoxide. This suggests that levetiracetam may have potential anxiolytic effects and may provide therapeutic benefits to individual with anxiety spectrum disorders.", 
    "59": "Past work found that exposure to 12 times normal atmospheric pressure (ATA) of helium-oxygen gas (heliox) selectively antagonizes (uncouples) and differentiates allosteric coupling in GABA(A) receptors initiated by benzodiazepines versus neurosteroids. The present study tested the hypothesis that pressure can differentiate coupling initiated by a spectrum of benzodiazepine receptor ligands by measuring the effects of pressure on benzodiazepine ligand modulation of GABA-activated 36Cl(-) uptake in mouse brain membranes. 12 ATA completely antagonized allosteric modulation by: benzodiazepine receptor agonists diazepam and flunitrazepam; Type-1 selective benzodiazepine receptor agonist zolpidem and the benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-alpha][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (Ro15-4513). The similar, non-competitive-like characteristics of pressure antagonism of these ligands suggest common structural/functional elements underlying their coupling. Pressure also antagonized allosteric modulation by the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), but the antagonism was not complete and appeared to be surmountable (competitive-like) suggesting unexpected differences in coupling for DMCM versus Ro15-4513. These studies represent the first attempt to use pressure as a tool to dissect benzodiazepine receptor coupling. The results suggest that there is a common, pressure antagonism sensitive structural/functional element underlying coupling for benzodiazepine receptor ligands and that coupling for the full inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonist DMCM differs from coupling for benzodiazepine receptor agonists and benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonists.", 
    "60": "Before the completion of visual development, visual deprivation impairs synaptic elimination in the visual cortex. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the distribution of central benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) is also altered in the visual cortex in subjects with early-onset blindness. Positron emission tomography was carried out with [(15)O]water and [(11)C]flumazenil on six blind subjects and seven sighted controls at rest. We found that the CBF was significantly higher in the visual cortex for the early-onset blind subjects than for the sighted control subjects. However, there was no significant difference in the BZR distribution in the visual cortex for the subject with early-onset blindness than for the sighted control subjects. These results demonstrated that early visual deprivation does not affect the distribution of GABA(A) receptors in the visual cortex with the sensitivity of our measurements. Synaptic elimination may be independent of visual experience in the GABAergic system of the human visual cortex during visual development.", 
    "61": "OBJECTIVES: To describe the sedative and neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) that are currently used in pediatric intensive care units across the country and to assess the use of written protocols for their use, criteria used for selecting these agents, monitoring practices, and clinicians responsible for making therapeutic decisions in the pediatric intensive care units. DESIGN: A questionnaire was mailed to pediatric attending physician members of the Society of Critical Care Medicine practicing in the United States in January 1997. A cover letter was also enclosed that explained the purpose of the survey and asked the respondent to forward the questionnaire to a colleague if unable to complete. RESULTS: A total of 176 questionnaires were returned, which represented 145 pediatric institutions across the country, for a response rate of 51%. The agents reported to be used most often for sedation were the opioids and benzodiazepines, which were used for >72 hrs. The NMBA used were vecuronium and pancuronium, which were used for >48 hrs. Newer agents such as propofol and cisatracurium were being used by some clinicians as well. Respondents primarily use the intravenous route of administration as either intermittent bolus or continuous infusion. Frequently cited indications for sedatives were anxiety, fear, and amnesia and facilitation of intubation and maintenance of mechanical ventilation for NMBA. Only 13.4% indicated using written protocols for sedatives and 26.1% for NMBA. Decisions regarding the choice of agent were usually based on clinician preference and experience and the duration of action of the agent. Respondents most often reported using clinical assessment (57%) or the Glasgow Coma Scale (47.3%) to monitor the depth or adequacy of sedation. Over 80% of those surveyed use a peripheral nerve stimulator to monitor NMBA activity. CONCLUSION: Clinicians continue to use the opioids and benzodiazepines most often for sedation in the pediatric intensive care units, but newer agents are being used more often and warrant further investigation. The use of written protocols is very low, possibly because of the lack of guidelines in the literature on pediatric intensive care unit sedation and neuromuscular blockade. Development and implementation of protocols for the selection, use, and monitoring of sedatives and NMBA through a multidisciplinary team approach may be a beneficial way to provide safe and cost-effective therapy to critically ill pediatric patients.",

Unfortunately, many patients fail to respond adequately to this agent or are unable to tolerate its adverse effects. Divalproex has become a commonly used alternative to lithium, but it also is ineffective or poorly tolerated in many patients.

The mechanism of benzodiazepine action is through the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors. Properties of benzodiazepine include sedation, anxiolysis, amnesia, anticonvulsion, and muscle relaxation. Unfortunately, adverse paradoxical reactions can be stimulated by benzodiazepines and are difficult to predict and diagnose. Two cases of paradoxical reactions associated with the use of intravenous midazolam are presented, and the management of this complication and its different etiologies are reviewed. The relationship of the paradoxical reaction to alteration of the cholinergic homeostasis, serotonin levels, the role of genetics, and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor configuration is discussed.", 
    "67": "For dental outpatients undergoing conscious sedation, recovery from sedation must be sufficient to allow safe discharge home, and many researchers have defined \"recovery time\" as the time until the patient was permitted to return home after the end of dental treatment. But it is frequently observed that patients remain in the clinic after receiving permission to go home. The present study investigated \"clinical recovery time,\" which is defined as the time until discharge from the clinic after a dental procedure. We analyzed data from 61 outpatients who had received dental treatment under conscious sedation at the Hiroshima University Dental Hospital between January 1998 and December 2000 (nitrous oxide-oxygen inhalation sedation [n = 35], intravenous sedation with midazolam [n = 10], intravenous sedation with propofol [n = 16]). We found that the median clinical recovery time was 40 minutes after nitrous oxide-oxygen sedation, 80 minutes after midazolam sedation, and 52 minutes after propofol sedation. The clinical recovery time was about twice as long as the recovery time described in previous studies. In a comparison of the sedation methods, clinical recovery time differed (P = .0008), being longer in the midazolam sedation group than in the nitrous oxide-oxygen sedation group (P = .018). These results suggest the need for changes in treatment planning for dental outpatients undergoing conscious sedation.",

    "86": "The currently recommended treatment for metronidazole toxicosis is drug discontinuation and supportive therapy. Reported recovery times are 1-2 weeks. The records of 21 dogs with metronidazole toxicosis were retrospectively analyzed to determine whether diazepam improved recovery. The dosage and duration of metronidazole therapy and the response and recovery times of 13 dogs treated with diazepam were compared to those of 8 dogs receiving only supportive care. Response time was defined as the time to resolution of the debilitating clinical signs. Recovery time was the time to resolution of all residual clinical signs. The average dosage and duration of metronidazole administration for the diazepam-treated and untreated groups were 60.3 mg/kg/d for 44.9 days and 65.1 mg/kg/d for 37.25 days. The protocol for diazepam administration consisted of an initial i.v. bolus and then diazepam PO q8h for 3 days. The average dosage of both the i.v. and PO diazepam was 0.43 mg/kg. The average response time for the diazepam-treated dogs was 13.4 hours compared to 4.25 days for the untreated group. Recovery time also was markedly shorter for the diazepam-treated dogs (38.8 hours) compared to the untreated group (11 days). Results of this study showed that dogs with metronidazole toxicosis recover faster when treated with diazepam. Although the mechanism of metronidazole toxicosis or how diazepam exerts its favorable effect is not known, it is likely related to modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor within the cerebellar and vestibular systems.", 
    "87": "In Finnish data from 1995-2000, 1006 fatal poisonings due to alcohol (ethanol), a single drug or both were statistically analysed in retrospect to evaluate the interaction between alcohol and drugs. In 53% of these cases, low concentrations of some common benzodiazepines were present. The median postmortem blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was 3.3 percent per thousand (w/w) in the 615 alcohol poisonings, but significantly lower, ranging from 1.3 to 1.7 percent per thousand, when promazine, doxepin, amitriptyline or propoxyphene were found together with alcohol. When levomepromazine, temazepam or zopiclone were present, the median BAC was also significantly lower, 2.5-2.7 percent per thousand. Citalopram and diltiazem did not exhibit a significant effect. The median BAC was significantly lower in cases with high concentrations than in those with low concentrations of a drug (excluding citalopram), suggesting a positive concentration-effect relationship. Fatal toxicity indices (FTIs) were calculated by relating the number of deaths caused by a drug to the corresponding sales figures. Promazine had an extremely high FTI, followed by levomepromazine, propoxyphene, doxepin and amitriptyline. The other drugs had relatively low FTIs. The results reflect not only the acute toxicity of a given drug-alcohol combination but also the manners of use and abuse of these drugs.",

Tofisopam (Grandaxin) is a derivative of benzodiazepines. It is reported that heart rate variability (HRV) reveals the function of the autonomic nervous system and is used as an index of the effects of the autonomic nervous system on the heart rhythm. In previous studies, it was reported that tofisopam improved HRV. In this case report, the frequency of PSVT was significantly decreased and subjective symptoms of arrhythmia were eliminated after the administration of tofisopam. R-R interval variability and high-frequency power (HF; 0.15-0.40 Hz) were increased, and [low-frequency power (LF; 0.04-0.15 Hz)]/HF was decreased after administration of tofisopam. These results suggest that tofisopam overcame the existing imbalance of the sympathetic and vagus nervous system. In this case report, it is suggested that tofisopam is effective for the treatment of PSVT.", 
    "90": "1 The mechanism and receptor subtypes involved in carbachol-stimulated amylase release and its changes after castration were studied in parotid slices from male rats. 2 Carbachol induced both amylase release and inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation in parotid slices from control and castrated rats, but castration induced a decrease of carbachol maximal effect. The effect of castration was reverted by testosterone replacement. 3 The selective M(1) and M(3) muscarinic receptor antagonists, pirenzepine and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide, respectively, inhibited carbachol-stimulated amylase release and IP accumulation in a dose-dependent manner in parotid slices from control and castrated rats. 4 A diminution of binding sites of muscarinic receptor in parotid membrane from castrated rats was observed. Competition binding assays showed that both, M(1) and M(3) muscarinic receptor subtypes are expressed in membranes of parotid glands from control and castrated rats, M(3) being the greater population. 5 These results suggest that amylase release induced by carbachol in parotid slices is mediated by phosphoinositide accumulation. This mechanism appears to be triggered by the activation of M(1) and M(3) muscarinic receptor subtypes. Castration induced a decrease of the maximal effect of carbachol evoked amylase release and IP accumulation followed by a diminution in the number of parotid gland muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.", 
    "91": "1 In guinea-pig ileal longitudinal muscle, muscarinic partial agonists, 4-(N-[3-chlorophenyl]-carbomoyloxy)-2-butynyl-trimethylammonium (McN-A343) and pilocarpine, each produced parallel increases in tension and cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]c) with a higher EC(50) than that of the full agonist carbachol. The maximum response of [Ca(2+)]c or tension was not much different among the three agonists. The Ca(2+) channel blocker nicardipine markedly inhibited the effects of all three agonists 2 The contractile response to any agonist was antagonized in a competitive manner by M(2) receptor selective antagonists (N,N'-bis[6-[[(2-methoyphenyl)methyl]amino]hexyl]-1,8-octanediamine tetrahydrochloride and 11-[[2-[(diethlamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4] benzodiazepine-6-one), and the apparent order of M(2) antagonist sensitivity was McN-A343>pilocarpine>carbachol. M(3) receptor selective antagonists, 1,1-dimethyl-4-diphenylacetoxypiperidinium iodide and darifenacin, both severely depressed the maximum response for McN-A343, while darifenacin had a similar action in the case of pilocarpine. Both M(3) antagonists behaved in a competitive manner in the case of the carbachol response. 3 McN-A343 failed to release Ca(2+) from the intracellular stores, and the Ca(2+)-releasing action of pilocarpine was very weak compared with that of carbachol. All three agonists were capable of increasing Ca(2+) sensitivity of the contractile proteins. 4 McN-A343 rarely produced membrane depolarization, but always accelerated electrical spike discharge. Pilocarpine effect was more often accompanied by membrane depolarization, as was usually seen using carbachol. 5 The results suggest that muscarinic agonist-evoked contractions result primarily from the integration of Ca(2+) entry associated with the increased spike discharge and myofilaments Ca(2+) sensitization, and that Ca(2+) store release may contribute to the contraction indirectly via potentiation of the electrical membrane responses. They may also support the idea that an interaction of M(2) and M(3) receptors plays a crucial role in mediating the contraction response.",

    "100": "The complexity of the stress response would appear to provide multiple opportunities for intervention, but treatment strategies are often centered on the improvement of symptoms rather than attempting to \"treat\" the stress response. However, recent efforts have begun to focus on the development of pharmacological agents that can attenuate the stress response itself, rather than the symptoms associated with stress. Although CRF, which is the main regulator of the stress system, is the focus of current interest, there is an accumulating body of evidence suggesting that the vasopressinergic system may play an equal role in the regulation of the stress response, and that V(1b) receptor antagonists may be of potential therapeutic benefit. The availability of SSR149415, the first selective antagonist for the V(1b) receptor has allowed us to evaluate this hypothesis. SSR149415 is able to attenuate some but not all stress-related behaviors in rodents. While the antidepressant-like activity of the compound was comparable to that of reference antidepressants, the overall profile displayed in anxiety tests was different from that of classical anxiolytics, such as benzodiazepines. The latter were active in a wide range of anxiety models, whereas the V(1b) receptor antagonist showed clear-cut effects only in particularly stressful situations. It is important to note that SSR149415 is devoid of central depressant effects, even at high doses, and does not affect cognitive processes, suggesting a large therapeutic window. Altogether, these findings suggest that V(1b) receptor antagonists might be useful as a treatment for major depression and stress disorders that result from traumatic events.", 
    "101": "In patients with acute coronary syndromes, inhibition of platelet aggregation with parenteral alpha(IIb)/beta(III) antagonists has proven effective at preventing nonfatal myocardial infarction and repeat percutaneous coronary interventions. Paradoxically, the efficacy observed for acute indications and parenteral agents has not extended to oral agents and chronic prevention of secondary thrombotic events, despite robust antithrombotic properties in preclinical thrombosis models. This report documents the preclinical data of Lotrafiban, an oral alpha(IIb)/beta(III) antagonist that recently failed in a phase III clinical trial (BRAVO) for the prevention of secondary thrombosis. Lotrafiban was characterized in a dog circumflex artery electrical injury model, and a cyclic flow reduction model (\"Folts\"). The data demonstrate that both oral (1.0-50.0 mg/kg) and intravenous (0.1-0.8ug/kg/min) administration of lotrafiban produced dose-related inhibition (45%-95%) of ex vivo platelet aggregation. In the electrical injury model, the dose-related inhibition correlated with a significant reduction in the frequency of coronary occlusion, size of the developing thrombus, and the extent of left ventricular ischemic damage. Effects on blood flow and bleeding time were also dose related. The combination of low dose lotrafiban (0.1ug/kg/min) and aspirin (5.0 mg/kg) generated additive antithrombotic effects, approximating the antithrombotic efficacy of a 2-4 fold higher dose of lotrafiban while only modestly prolonging the bleeding time. For purposes of comparison, the ADP receptor antagonist clopidogrel was also assessed in the electrical injury model. Clopidogrel (5.0-10.0 mg/kg, iv.) significantly reduced the resulting left ventricular infarct areas, but lacked the overall efficacy of lotrafiban. In the \"Folts\" model, lotrafiban inhibited cyclic blood flow reductions (CFR's) by 100% in animals insensitive to the antithrombotic effects of aspirin. Overall, the preclinical data demonstrated that alpha(IIb)/beta(III) antagonism with lotrafiban was a well tolerated and effective strategy for attenuating acute arterial thrombosis. The lack of a correlation between these preclinical data and the outcome of the clinical trial BRAVO are unexplained. However, the combined evidence suggests that these acute canine thrombosis studies may not completely capture the pathology reflected in chronic human atherothrombotic disease.", 
    "102": "The metabotropic glutamate receptors are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) involved in the regulation of many synapses, including most glutamatergic fast excitatory synapses. Eight subtypes have been identified that can be classified into three groups. The molecular characterization of these receptors revealed proteins much more complex than any other GPCRs. They are composed of a Venus Flytrap (VFT) module where glutamate binds, connected to a heptahelical domain responsible for G-protein coupling. Recent data including the structure of the VFT module determined with and without glutamate, indicate that these receptors function as dimers. Moreover a number of intracellular proteins can regulate their targeting and transduction mechanism. Such structural features of mGlu receptors offer multiple possibilities for synthetic compounds to modulate their activity. In addition to agonists and competitive antagonists acting at the glutamate binding site, a number of non-competitive antagonists with inverse agonist activity, and positive allosteric modulators have been discovered. These later compounds share specific properties that make them good candidates for therapeutic applications. First, their non-amino acid structure makes them pass more easily the blood brain barrier. Second, they are much more selective than any other compound identified so far, being the first subtype selective molecules. Third, for the negative modulators, their non competitive mechanism of action makes them relatively unaffected by high concentrations of glutamate that may be present in disease states (e.g. stroke, epilepsy, neuropathic pain, etc.). Fourth, like the benzodiazepines acting at the GABA(A) receptors, the positive modulators offer a new way to increase the activity of these receptors in vivo, with a low risk of inducing their desensitization. The present review article focuses on the specific structural features of these receptors and highlights the various possibilities these offer for drug development.",

    "107": "Mitochondria plays a central role in apoptotic cell death. The intermembrane space of mitochondria contains a number of soluble molecules whose release from the organelle to the cytosol or the nucleus induces cell death. Thus, molecules that directly trigger mitochondria membrane permeabilisation are efficient cytotoxic drugs. Mitochondria is one of the cellular targets for commonly used epipodophyllotoxins, adenine deoxynucleoside analogs and taxanes as well as recently developped agents such as the pentacyclic triterpene betulinic acid and the lymphotoxic agent FTY720. Most informations on anthracyclines point to the mitochondrial membrane as the main target of cardiotoxicity. Mitochondria is also a target for arsenite trioxide, an old cytotoxic agent recently used for treating acute promyelocytic leukemia, lonidamine, a dichlorinated derivative of indazole-3-carboxylic acid developped as a chemosensitizer, the retinoic acid receptor gamma activator CD437 and nitric oxide (NO). Recently, cytotoxic drugs have been specifically designed to directly affect the mitochondrial function. These include the positively charged alpha-helical peptides, which are attracted to and disrupt the negatively charged mitochondrial membrane, thus inducing mammalian cell apoptosis when targeted intracellularly. Various strategies have been proposed also to directly inhibit Bcl-2 and related anti-apoptotic proteins, including antisense oligonucleotides (e.g. Genasense, currently tested in phase III trials), small molecules that mimic the BH3 dimerization domain of these proteins and kinase inhibitors. Ligands of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor such as the isoquinolone carboxamide derivative PK11195 also overcome the membrane-stabilizing effect of Bcl-2, whereas the adenosine nucleotide translocator (ANT) and the mitochondrial DNA are two other potential cellular targets for cytotoxic agents. Potentially, new compounds directly targeting the mitochondria may be useful in treating hematological malignancies. The challenge is now to selectively target these mitochondria permeabilizing agents to malignant cells. This review briefly summarizes the role of the mitochondria in cell death and describes these various strategies for targeting the mitochondria to induce apoptosis.",

Guinea pigs, pretreated with pyridostigmine 0.1 mg/kg, were intoxicated with 4LD(50) of sarin (s.c. route) and 1 min after intoxication treated by intramuscular injection of atropine (3 or 33.8 mg/kg), pralidoxime (32 mg/kg) and either diazepam (2 mg/kg) or avizafone (3.5 mg/kg). EEG and pneumo-physiological parameters were simultaneously recorded. When atropine was administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg, seizures were observed in 87.5% of the cases; if an anticonvulsant was added (diazepam (2 mg/kg) or avizafone (3.5 mg/kg)), seizure was prevented but respiratory disorders were observed. At 33.8 mg/kg, atropine markedly increased the seizure threshold and prevented early respiratory distress induced by sarin. When diazepam was administered together with atropine, seizures were not observed but 62.5% of the animals displayed respiratory difficulties. These symptoms were not observed when using avizafone. The pharmacokinetic data showed marked variation of the plasma levels of atropine and diazepam in different antidote combination groups, where groups receiving diazepam exhibited the lowest concentration of atropine in plasma. Taken together, the results indicate that avizafone is suitable in therapy against sarin when an anticonvulsant is judged necessary.",

The present study was designated to examine the efficacy of buccal midazolam in children at different ages with seizures of more than 5 min duration. Nineteen previously unreported children, aged from 1 month to 15 years, were treated with a 0.3 mg/kg dose of buccal midazolam; 13 had prolonged seizures, and six had status epilepticus, with a duration of 5-45 min (mean 22 min). Sixteen of 19 seizures (84.2%) stopped within 10 min of buccal midazolam being given. The drug efficacy in patients with status epilepticus was 50%. However, all patients with convulsions shorter than 30 min showed a perfect response (100%). Convulsion episodes stopped within 3.89+/-2.22 min (median time 3 min). Seizure duration was correlated with cessation of seizure (r=0.76, P<0.001). No clinically important side effects were seen in any patient. On the basis of this experience, we concluded that a 0.3 mg/kg dose of buccal administration of midazolam might offer an effective treatment in all ages of children.",

A 40% decrease in digoxin (P-glycoprotein substrate) area under the curve was observed with 750 mg of avasimibe daily for 10 days. In vitro studies were conducted to define the mechanisms of these interactions. Induction was observed in CYP3A4 activity and immunoreactive protein (EC50 of 200-400 nM) in primary human hepatocytes treated with avasimibe. Rifampin treatment yielded similar results. Microarray analysis revealed avasimibe (1 microM) increased CYP3A4 mRNA 20-fold, compared with a 23-fold increase with 50 microM rifampin. Avasimibe induced P-glycoprotein mRNA by about 2-fold and immunoreactive protein in a dose-dependent manner.

The aim of the present study was to determine (1) the pathway mediating reflex inhibition of gastric motility and (2) activation of duodenal vagal afferents in response to chylomicrons. Mesenteric lymph was obtained from awake rats fitted with lymph fistulas during intestinal perfusion of lipid (Intralipid, 170 micromol h(-1), chylous lymph) or a dextrose and/or electrolyte solution (control lymph).

Chylous lymph was significantly more potent than control lymph in inhibiting gastric motility. Functional vagal deafferentation by perineural capsaicin or CCK A receptor antagonist (devazepide, 1 mg kg(-1), i.v.) significantly reduced chylous lymph-induced inhibition of gastric motility. The discharge of duodenal vagal afferent fibres was recorded from the dorsal abdominal vagus nerve in an in vitro preparation of the duodenum. Duodenal vagal afferent nerve fibre discharge was significantly increased by close-arterial injection of CCK (1-100 pmol) in 43 of 83 units tested. The discharge of 88% of CCK-responsive fibres was increased by close-arterial injection of chylous lymph; devazepide (100 microg, i.a.) abolished the afferent response to chylous lymph in 83% of these units. These data suggest that in the intestinal mucosa, chylomicrons or their products release endogenous CCK which activates CCK A receptors on vagal afferent nerve fibre terminals, which in turn initiate a vago-vagal reflex inhibition of gastric motor function.", 
    "124": "To study the role of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) in apoptosis of axotomized retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in vitro.", 
    "125": "Primary rat retinal cultures containing DiI-labeled RGCs were treated with pharmacological agents that modulate the PTP. Ratiometric imaging of the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) were conducted on similarly treated cultures, with the dual-emission probe JC-1, and the correlation with the results of the viability experiments were determined.", 
    "126": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor agonist PK11195 induced RGC death, but this was not inhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA), which normally maintains the PTP in the closed configuration. Paradoxically, the combination of CsA and PK11195 caused massive RGC death and decreased DeltaPsi(m), suggesting aberrant regulation of the PTP in these cells. Imaging of DeltaPsi(m) revealed morphologic changes in the mitochondria after depolarization, characterized by formation of ringlike bodies, and similar to that with the potassium ionophore valinomycin. There were no such findings with other retinal neurons or neuronally differentiated PC-12 cells. The anomalous RGC death was independent of caspase activation or reactive oxygen species production.", 
    "127": "These results suggest an aberrant opening of the RGC PTP and could be the result of structural differences in its components or its interaction with intracellular ligands. Unique RGC PTP behavior could underlie the pathophysiology of those mitochondrial diseases in which RGCs are specifically affected (e.g., Leber hereditary optic neuropathy).", 
    "128": "The aim of this cross-sectional study, the EIRE study, was to assess the frequency of several side effects with antipsychotics in the clinical setting. This paper addresses the adverse effect of weight gain.", 
    "129": "Outpatients diagnosed of schizophrenia according to DSM-IV criteria and receiving a single antipsychotic (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine or haloperidol) for at least 4 weeks were consecutively recruited. Data were collected in a single visit, including data on demographic, clinical and treatment characteristics. Mean weight change was evaluated retrospectively by means of clinical charts and the weight at the time of the visit; in addition, the corresponding item of a modified version of the UKU, a Scandinavian side-effect rating scale, was used. Chi-squared test and logistic regression methods were used to analyze frequency of weight gain between treatments.", 
    "130": "Out of 669 recruited, 636 evaluable patients were assessed. The treatment with the highest number of patients with weight gain as an adverse reaction on the UKU scale was olanzapine (74.5%), followed by risperidone (53.4%) and haloperidol (40.0%). The proportion of patients with clinically relevant weight gain (>or=7% increase versus initial weight) was also higher with olanzapine (45.7%) than with risperidone (30.6%) and haloperidol (22.4%). Five patients (13.5%) treated with quetiapine had some degree of weight gain according to the UKU scale, although no patient showed a clinically relevant weight gain (>or=7%). Treatment with olanzapine and risperidone were identified as risk factors of weight gain versus haloperidol. The risk of weight gain was higher in women (OR: 4.4), overweight patients (OR: 3.0) and in patients with <or=1 year of treatment (OR: 6.3) in the olanzapine group. A higher risk of weight gain in women (OR: 2.6) was also seen with risperidone.", 
    "131": "Clinically relevant weight gain is clearly associated with olanzapine, and to lesser extent, with haloperidol and risperidone. Data for quetiapine were not conclusive because of the short duration of treatment.", 
    "132": "Many psychiatric professionals are unfamiliar with gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), an increasingly popular drug of abuse. GHB withdrawal can lead to psychosis and agitation, and patients may present to psychiatric facilities for treatment. Withdrawal may progress to delirium, with the potential for severe or even fatal medical complications. Therefore, it is imperative for psychiatric professionals to understand how to treat these patients. In this article, we describe two cases of severe GHB withdrawal syndrome that were treated in our inpatient psychiatric unit. These are among the most severe cases reported. Pertinent literature is reviewed and suggestions for treatment are discussed.", 
    "133": "Zolpidem, a commonly prescribed hypnotic, is an imidazopyridine that purportedly has a unique benzodiazepine-receptor binding profile. Despite its unique binding profile, human laboratory experiments have generally failed to demonstrate meaningful behavioral pharmacological differences between zolpidem and classic benzodiazepine-receptor agonists like triazolam. In this article, two groups of nondrug-abusing volunteers received 15 mg zolpidem (N = 11) or 0.375 mg zolpidem (N = 15) on four separate occasions and placebo on two other occasions. In both groups, the order of drug administration was quasi-random. Drug effects were assessed with a battery of laboratory performance tasks and subject-rated drug-effect questionnaires. Zolpidem and triazolam produced prototypical sedative-like effects (e.g., impaired performance, increased subject-ratings of sedation). The performance-impairing effects of triazolam, but not zolpidem, were significantly less after the final administration relative to the initial administration. The subject-rated effects of both zolpidem and triazolam were significantly less after the final administration relative to the initial administration. The results of this experiment suggest that zolpidem and triazolam differ in terms of tolerance-producing effects. Future studies should assess the tolerance-producing effects of zolpidem across a range of doses, as well as other novel sedatives such as zaleplon.", 
    "134": "Burning mouth syndrome is a condition characterized by burning sensations of the oral cavity in the absence of physical abnormalities of the mucosa or a detectable underlying medical disorder. It is a multifactorial disorder with unclear etiology, affecting predominatly middle-aged women. Multiple approaches to treatment have been described in the literature, with few controlled clinical trials regarding their efficacy. The objectives of this retrospective study were to: 1. determine the epidemiologic characteristics of BMS patients referred to an oral medicine practice; 2. determine if BMS classification correlates with response to treatment; 3. determine the efficacy of a variety of known therapies for BMS. A database was constructed from the charts of 150 consecutive patients diagnosed with BMS; and these charts were reviewed. Patients were classified according to previously published criteria for BMS. Presumed etiologies were grouped into depression/anxiety-associated; hematinic deficiencies, including iron, folate and vitamin B complex; oral habits: and idiopathic BMS. Treatment approaches were divided into seven categories: soft desensitizing appliance; tricyclic antidepressants (TCA); benzodiazepines (BZD); topical analgesics; hematinic supplements; habit awareness counseling; and multi-modal therapy (combining two or more of the above). Improvement was recorded using a zero to 100% VAS scale and classified as no relief (0%); mild (0-40%); meaningful/moderate (41-80%); and profound relief (81-100%). Burning mouth syndrome without any identifiable cause (idiopathic) was diagnosed in 33 patients (46.6%). Patients were followed up at one month (4 weeks) after the initial visit. Nine patients (12.7%) reported profound relief; 17 patients (23.9%) reported meaningful relief; 39 patients (54.9%) reported mild relief. This retrospective review showed no significant correlation between classification of BMS and response to therapy. The most effective treatment modalities were habit awareness, followed by TCAs.", 
    "135": "The Benzodiazepine Dependence Self-Report Questionnaire (Bendep-SRQ) measures the severity of benzodiazepine (BZ) dependence on four domains: awareness of problematic use, preoccupation with the availability of BZ, lack of compliance with the therapeutic regimen, and withdrawal. Although promising results of the Bendep-SRQ have been obtained in cross-sectional studies, no attention has been paid to its clinical relevance during BZ withdrawal, i.e., predictive validity and time course. We performed cross-validation and evaluated the predictive validity and time course on 180 long-term BZ users who were taking part in a general practice BZ discontinuation trial. Three of the four domains had good scalability. Some concerns arose about the preoccupation scale, which emphasizes the need for cross-validation in clinically relevant populations. All scales showed excellent reliability (subject discriminability, item discriminability), while construct and discriminant validity were adequate. All four scales contributed significantly to the prediction of whether complete abstinence would be achieved directly after taking part in the discontinuation program. This prediction was independent of the other prognostic variables, except for those in the domain problematic use. The scales problematic use and preoccupation showed good sensitivity to changes during follow-up. The insensitivity of the scale, lack of compliance can be explained by low baseline scores in our population, while the insensitivity of the withdrawal scale was probably the result of the study design. In conclusion, our study indicated the clinical relevance of the Bendep-SRQ before and during a BZ discontinuation trial. We recommend the use of the Bendep-SRQ in discontinuation therapy and research into the field of BZ addiction.", 
    "136": "In 20-30% of potential surgical candidates with refractory focal epilepsy, standard MRI does not identify the cause. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. [(11)C]Flumazenil (FMZ) PET images most subtypes of GABA(A) receptors, present on most neurons. We investigated [(11)C]FMZ binding in grey and white matter in 16 normal controls and in 44 patients with refractory neocortical focal epilepsy and normal optimal MRI. Fourteen patients had unilateral frontal lobe epilepsy, five occipital lobe epilepsy (OLE), six parietal lobe epilepsy (PLE) and 19 neocortical epilepsy that was not clearly lobar. Parametric images of FMZ volume of distribution (FMZ-V(d)) were computed. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM99) with explicit masking, including the white matter, was used to analyse individual patients and groups. Thirty-three of the 44 patients showed focal abnormal FMZ-V(d); increases in 16, decreases in eight, and both increases and decreases in nine. In seven patients, the increases in FMZ binding were periventricular, in locations normally seen in periventricular nodular heterotopia on MRI. There were frontal and parietal increases in FMZ binding in grey and white matter in the PLE group and decreases in the cingulate gyrus in the OLE group. FMZ binding increases, particularly periventricular increases, were a prominent feature of MRI-negative focal epilepsies and may represent neuronal migration disturbances.", 
    "137": "This report describes the molecular cloning and pharmacological characterization of a transiently expressed chicken brain cholecystokinin receptor (CCK-CHR) in COS-7 cells. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based cloning strategy was applied using: (1) an initial PCR with deoxyinosine-containing primers designed to target conserved regions in CCK receptors, followed by (2) rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), and (3) full-length PCR of the CCK-CHR cDNA. The full-length cloned bicistronic CCK-CHR cDNA contained a short upstream open reading frame (uORF) coding for a putative six-amino-acid-long peptide of unknown function, followed by a long open reading frame (lORF) encoding the 436-amino-acid-long CCK-CHR receptor protein. At the amino acid level, the CCK-CHR shared approximately 50% homology with mammalian and Xenopus laevis CCK receptors. The pharmacological profile of CCK-CHR resembled that of CCK-B receptors using agonists (CCK-8, CCK-4, gastrin-17), whereas CCK-CHR showed higher affinity for the CCK-A receptor antagonist, devazepide, than for the CCK-B receptor antagonist, L-365,260. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description and functional expression study of a cloned chicken CCK receptor cDNA.", 
    "138": "Evaluation of the efficacy and side effects profile of Clobazam in a 24-week open-labelled trial involving 26 cases of drug na\u00efve adult patients with epilepsy.", 
    "139": "The study was an open labelled unicentre trial in which only drug na\u00efve cases with epilepsy were included. A total of 26 cases were recruited. One case was dropped because he did not complete the desired follow up. Seizure type and frequency were recorded and follow up was done at 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 weeks after initiation of therapy. The change in seizure severity, the dose of Clobazam required and development of side effects were recorded.", 
    "140": "The seizure types included GTCS (n=16), complex partial seizures (n=4), focal motor seizures with secondary generalisation (n=3) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (n=2). Out of 25 patients, 16 (64%) became seizure free, while five (20%) had >50% reduction in their seizure frequency. Thus, these 21 patients (84%) were considered to be well controlled. The commonest side effect seen was sedation, which was noted in 4 of the 25 patients (16%). However, in none of these four patients sedation was significant enough to warrant stoppage of therapy. Weight gain, gait ataxia, loss of short-term memory and breakthrough seizures were noted in one patient each.", 
    "141": "The efficacy of Clobazam coupled with the lack of significant side effects noted in our study makes it merit consideration as monotherapy in adult patients with epilepsy.", 
    "142": "An efficient and stereocontrolled synthesis of phenylalanine- and tryptophan-derived 5-phenyl-1,4-benzodiazepines is described. This new methodology involves, as a key step, the synthesis of 5-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-1,4-benzodiazepines by a one-pot cyano reduction and reductive cyclization of the appropriate amino nitrile, which were obtained via a modified Strecker reaction of N-protected alpha-amino aldehydes with 2-aminobenzophenone and trimethylsilyl cyanide. The subsequent reduction of these 2,3-dihydro-1H-1,4-benzodiazepines, followed by regioselective alkylation or acylation at position 4, led to 2,4-disubstituted-5-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine.", 
    "143": "In experiments on rats using an \"illuminated area\" avoidance test and a \"threatening situation\" avoidance test, preliminary i.p. administration and subsequent microinjection into the ventromedial hypothalamus of various combinations of monoamines, transmitter amino acids, and their agonists and antagonists demonstrated differences in the functional importance of the neurochemical profile of this limbic formation in mediating anxiety states of different origins. The neurochemical analysis with local intrahypothalamic administration of anxiosedative and anxioselective substances showed that the antiaversive actions of Campirone are obtained only in conditions in which the dominant motivation is fear, while chlordiazepoxide, Phenibut, and Indoter are also active in anxiety induced by negatively stressful zoosocial influences; these actions are mediated respectively by serotoninergic and GABAergic types of synaptic switching in the ventromedial hypothalamus.", 
    "144": "A case is presented of a fatal drug interaction caused by ingestion of oxycodone (Oxycontin) and clonazepam (Klonapin). Oxycodone is an opium alkaloid used in long-term pain management therapy. Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine used for the treatment of seizures and panic disorders. The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) has reported an increase of 108% in the last two years of emergency department episodes related to Oxycontin. Six billion prescriptions were written for Oxycontin in the year 2000, an 18-fold increase from four years previous (1). Oxycontin has recently gained enormous notoriety at the local and national levels; however, there are very few previously documented cases of lethal drug interactions between oxycodone and clonazepam. Synergistic effects between these two drugs are postulated to arise from different agonistic mechanisms producing similar physiological changes. It is also theorized that clonazepam may inhibit the metabolism of oxycodone. A 38-year-old white female was found dead in Jefferson County, Tennessee in March of 2001. The deceased had physical evidence of previous drug abuse and positive serological findings of hepatitis B and C. Prescription pill bottles filled under the name of the deceased, as well as another name, were found with the body. Serum, urine and gastric contents from the deceased were screened for numerous drugs and metabolites using a combination of thin layer chromatography and immunoassay techniques (EMIT and FPIA). Analysis of biological specimens from the deceased revealed the presence of: benzodiazepines, opiates (oxycodone), and trazodone metabolites in the serum; cannabinoids, benzodiazepines, opiates (oxycodone), trazodone, trazodone metabolites, nicotine, and nicotine metabolite in the urine; and benzodiazepines, opiates (oxycodone), nicotine, and nicotine metabolite in the gastric contents. Quantitative analyses for clonazepam was performed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and revealed a plasma concentration of 1.41 microg/mL. Plasma oxycodone and urine 11-nor-carboxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol concentrations were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and revealed concentrations of 0.60 microg/mL and 27.9 ng/mL, respectively. The deceased had pathologies consistent with severe central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory depression produced by high concentrations of clonazepam and oxycodone including collapsed lungs, aspirated mucus, and heart failure. The pathologies were sufficient to cause death, which was officially attributed to a drug overdose; however, the manner of death was unknown.", 
    "145": "This study used midazolam-induced amnesia to explore the plausibility of the estimates provided by the process dissociation procedure (PDP), which is designed to estimate the contributions of recollection (R) and automatic (A) processes to implicit memory performance. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject design with 24 participants, single midazolam doses were administered intravenously, and word stem completion performance was used to calculate PDP estimates. A dissociation was observed such that midazolam decreased R but increased A estimates relative to placebo. Given that a manipulation that induces amnesia would not be expected to facilitate a memory process, these results add to the accumulating body of evidence suggesting that PDP estimates are not always theoretically plausible. Such evidence raises important questions about the use of the PDP.", 
    "146": "The thermodynamic activity of solubilized drug is an important determinant of the extent of absorption of lipophilic drugs from the gastrointestinal tract. In this study, the polymer partitioning method was evaluated for its use in the determination of the thermodynamic activity of lipophilic drugs when solubilized in colloidal digestion products, using drug in dilute solution as a reference ideal solution. The lipophilic drugs griseofulvin, diazepam, and danazol partitioned into a polymeric receiver phase from non-micellar solution as a function of drug lipophilicity. The concentration of drug that partitioned into the polymer was linearly proportional to the concentration of free drug in solution, and this allowed the measured partition coefficient to be utilized as an indicator of the drug activity coefficient. The addition of a solubilizing species such as bile salt micelles caused a reduction in drug activity of a similar magnitude to that predicted from micelle equilibrium solubility data in the identical micellar solutions. The addition of micelle swelling lipids such as lecithin and fatty acids resulted in further reductions in activity coefficient. The ability to measure drug activity in model digestive systems has potential for application in the rational development of improved lipid-based formulations of poorly water-soluble drugs for oral administration.", 
    "147": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric syndrome in patients with liver failure and/or a portal-systemic bypass. Since 2002 a new nomenclature of HE exists, that classifies HE in encephalopathy type A (associated with acute liver failure), type B (associated with portal-systemic bypass), and type C (associated with liver cirrhosis). HE type A is characterized by a rapid development to coma, cerebral edema, and a poor short-term prognosis. Therefore, these patients should be referred to a liver transplantation center. Standard treatment of HE consists of non absorbable disaccharides, non absorbable antibiotics, and a diet with an appropriate amount of proteins. In addition, the possibility of performing a liver transplantation should be evaluated. In patients with intractable HE other alternative treatments adjunct to standard treatment, like zinc, sodium benzoate, ornithine aspartate, branched chain amino acids, flumazenil, and bromocriptine should be considered.", 
    "148": "There are now five new-generation atypical psychiatric medications currently available. As these new treatments have become more common, they have grown to account for a significant percentage of all psychiatric medications prescribed. This is because of their efficacy in the treatment of several psychiatric disorders, ease of administration, and absence of the well-known extrapyramidal adverse effects long-attributed to the standard dopamine blocking anti-psychotic medications. As these medications have become treatments of choice, we have discovered additional information about their respective side effects. Issues such as bone marrow suppression, endocrine abnormalities, and most recently cardiac arrhythmia have produced concern. This paper will address all in an attempt to inform the primary care physician of the most prominent and clinically relevant adverse effects of these agents. A particular focus will address the increasing concern that these new medications can produce hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus."
