    "0": "The effects of buspirone on benzodiazepine receptors labelled in vivo with [3H]Ro 15-1788 were investigated. While buspirone did not affect the binding of benzodiazepine receptors in vitro, significant dose-related increases were observed in the in vivo labelling of benzodiazepine receptors in mice. However, similar results were also obtained with various neuroleptic agents and apomorphine. Potential mechanisms that may account for these results are discussed, but the data suggest caution in the use of [11C]Ro 15-1788 in positron emission tomography scanning in humans, since labelling by Ro 15-1788 may be affected by factors unrelated to direct changes at the benzodiazepine receptor site.", 
    "1": "The effects of chronic cortical seizures on the autoradiographic distributions of two markers of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/benzodiazepine receptor--chloride ionophore complex within local and long circuits connected to the focus were examined. Rats were subjected to electrically triggered seizures of the forelimb--sensorimotor overlap zone either daily or once every other day. At the time of sacrifice the rats had received a mean of 39 +/- 3 stimulations and their seizure responses had grown in intensity and duration. [3H]Muscimol binding and [3H]flunitrazepam binding, at near saturating ligand concentrations were unchanged in the focus, mirror focus, dorsolateral caudate, globus pallidus, ventrolateral and ventrobasal thalamic nuclei, and the substantia nigra pars reticularis. These results indicate that the progressive increases in strength and duration of recurrent focal cortical seizures are not accompanied by changes in the density of either GABA receptors or benzodiazepine receptors within the focus or projection pathways.", 
    "2": "The development of anticonvulsant tolerance with RO 16-6028, a benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist, was assessed in mice using an i.v. infusion of pentylenetetrazol as the convulsive stimulus. In contrast to other benzodiazepines tested previously in this seizure model the anticonvulsant protection afforded by RO 16-6028 did not change significantly during 10 days treatment (2 mg/kg b.i.d.). This result supports the hypothesis that partial agonists at the benzodiazepine receptor may induce less tolerance and/or dependence than full agonists.", 
    "3": "An anatomical atlas has been constructed of the brain of the baboon (Papio papio) in the orbito-meatal plane (OM-plane) which is frequently used in experimental positron emission tomography (PET) investigations. The atlas comprises 12 photographic reproductions of histological brain sections separated by 2.5 mm intervals, and covers telencephalic to pontine brain stem levels. The anatomical atlas was used in analysis of some PET scan images obtained after administration of either a benzodiazepine (BZ) antagonist, (11C)-Ro 15-1788, or a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, (76Br)-bromospiperone. Since PET camera detects radiation emitted from a slice of tissue of 15 mm thickness, each PET image corresponds to the tissue represented on six levels of the anatomical atlas. In optimal conditions, the PET image shows a pattern of receptor labelling reminiscent of anatomical structures in the atlas. Sometimes, however, the superimposition of different labelled structures yields a PET image which lacks any apparent resemblance with individual anatomical structures. In these cases, the analysis of the PET scan must rely on the anatomical atlas, as well as available data on the distribution of specific binding sites.", 
    "4": "The incidence of awareness was compared in three groups of patients undergoing elective or emergency Caesarean section, using pethidine alone or pethidine plus flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), as adjuvants to nitrous oxide: oxygen, muscle relaxant technique of general anaesthesia. The use of 0.03 mg/kg body weight of flunitrazepam was associated with a low incidence (4%) of awareness, cardiovascular stability, postoperative sedation and anterograde amnesia. The reduced incidence of awareness is probably due to increased depth of anaesthesia and anterograde amnesic effect produced by the drug.", 
    "5": "The LS and SS lines of mice were initially selected based on sedative responses to ethanol, but have been found to differ in response to a variety of hypnotics and anesthetics. These differences do not appear to be due to pharmacokinetic factors and several lines of evidence suggest involvement of the GABAergic system. To examine an important component of this system, the benzodiazepine receptor, we analyzed benzodiazepine receptor binding in vivo in LS and SS mice, and modulation of receptor binding by three interventions known to increase binding in other strains: pentobarbital, defeat stress, and ethanol. Receptor binding was determined by specific uptake of [3H]-Ro15-1788. Receptor binding was increased in cortex and hippocampus of LS mice compared to SS mice, with the increase in cortex most likely due to increased receptor number rather than a change in apparent affinity. Pentobarbital (30 mg/kg IP) induced similar increases in binding in both lines in several brain regions. Defeat stress caused increased binding in several brain regions of both SS and LS mice, with greater binding in cortex of LS mice. In contrast, ethanol at 3 doses (0.5, 1, and 2 g/kg) led to greater increases in binding in SS mice compared to LS mice in most brain regions. None of the interventions altered nonspecific binding. Ethanol concentrations were slightly greater in plasma and brain of LS mice. These results indicate differences in benzodiazepine receptor binding in LS and SS mice, with differential modulation of binding by ethanol but not by pentobarbital or stress. These differences may contribute to differential pharmacodynamic responses in the two lines of mice.", 
    "6": "Exposure to a mild stressor (15 min of vibration) produced analgesia in some rats and hyperalgesia in other rats from the same batch treated in the same way. Rats which responded with decreased tail-flick latencies (TFL) showed signs of hyperemotionality during the stress procedure. Stress-induced hyperalgesia was abolished by the administration of diazepam (2.5 mg/kg i.p.) and clonidine (25 micrograms/kg i.p.). It is suggested that the reversal of hyperalgesia was due to the anxiolytic properties of the drugs. Yohimbine, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist (5 mg/kg i.p.), antagonized the effect of clonidine. The influence of clonidine on stress-induced hyperalgesia may be mediated by alpha 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "7": "Dicarboxylic porphyrins were reported to be potent inhibitors of the binding of benzodiazepines to peripheral drug receptors in mitochondria, but the reverse does not appear to be true. Moreover, the photosensitization of mitochondria by the tumor-localizing porphyrin dimer/oligomer fraction of 'HPD' was not inhibited by benzodiazepines in cell culture.", 
    "8": "The binding of oleic acid to human serum albumin causes progressive changes in (a) the pK of some amino acid residues, as detected by pH-stat titration and (b) the induced molar ellipticities of albumin-bound drugs (diazepam and oxyphenbutazone), as measured by c.d. It is concluded that albumin undergoes several conformational transitions as the amount of oleic acid bound increases from 0 to about 9 molecules/molecule of protein. At least three different conformations of the protein seem to be involved. These conformations can be linked with the three classes of oleic acid-binding sites on albumin.", 
    "9": "Benzodiazepines are neuromodulatory drugs that potentiate GABA-mediated conductance increases. We report the findings of an investigation into the effect of a full benzodiazepine-positive modulator (agonist), chlordiazepoxide (CDPX), on desensitization of the GABA response in chick spinal cord neurons maintained in primary monolayer cell culture. GABA application initially increases cell conductance, which then desensitizes. CDPX increases the apparent rate constant and extent of desensitization for the GABA response. The observed values for rate constant and extent of desensitization in the presence of CDPX are significantly greater than the values predicted for an equivalent peak response to GABA alone. Flunitrazepam, another full positive modulator, also stimulates the rate constant for GABA-induced desensitization. Furthermore, a weak partial benzodiazepine-positive modulator, Ro 15-1788 (an imidazodiazepine) (1) exhibits little or no potentiation of GABA-induced desensitization, and (2) antagonizes the ability of CDPX to stimulate GABA desensitization. The results demonstrate a novel form of neuromodulator action: the stimulation of receptor desensitization that cannot be explained by channel blockade. Thus, benzodiazepine modulators have the capacity to increase GABA receptor desensitization while increasing the peak response to GABA.", 
    "10": "2-Oxoquazepam (2oxoquaz) is a novel benzodiazepine which shows preferential affinity for type I benzodiazepine recognition sites. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), pentobarbital, and chloride ions on [3H]2oxoquaz and [3H]flunitrazepam ( [3H]FNT) binding to membrane preparations from rat and human brain. GABA stimulated [3H]-2oxoquaz and [3H]FNT binding in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximal enhancement produced by GABA on [3H]2oxoquaz binding was higher than that produced on [3H]FNT binding in both rat and human tissues. In the rat brain, the effect of GABA on [3H]2oxoquaz was similar throughout different brain areas, whereas the effect on [3H]FNT binding was lower in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus than in the cerebellum. Moreover, both [3H]2oxoquaz and [3H]FNT binding were stimulated by chloride ions and pentobarbital. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that type I benzodiazepine recognition sites are linked functionally to the GABA recognition site and the chloride ionophore.", 
    "11": "Administration of estradiol benzoate to ovariectomized rats results in an increased binding of [3H]muscimol, [3H]diazepam and 35S-t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate in various areas of the central nervous system of rats. The effect is dose-dependent and its onset can be observed as early as 12 hr after s.c. administration of the hormone. The various binding activities are differentially affected by the hormonal treatment: the maximal effect observed for [3H]diazepam binding is in the cerebellum (+42%), for [3H]muscimol binding in the frontal cortex (+84%) and for 35S-t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding in the striatum (+46%) indicating that the activities of the sites are not under the same cellular regulatory control. The estrogen-induced increase in [3H]diazepam binding sites does not result in an increased protection against chemoconvulsants such as pentylenetetrazole.", 
    "12": "The variations of plasma histamine levels were studied in two groups of ten patients arriving in the operating room; the first group received midazolam, and the second a saline isotonic solution. The plasma histamine levels were compared, for each patient, to the histamine level measured the day before the operation. An histamine release was found as soon as the patient arrived in the operating room. No variation of the histamine level was found after the injection of midazolam.", 
    "13": "The purpose of this work was to develop a method to objectively evaluate differences in topographical patterns between 2 groups of isopotential maps. Previous evaluations by other investigators had been based on subjective judgment which created problems in describing differences in patterns, particularly when the differences were subtle. In the method presented in this report, the differences are evaluated by the Mahalanobis distance calculated from polynomial coefficient vectors obtained from unbiased polynomial interpolation in order to calculate values of picture elements in the 2-dimensional maps. One polynomial coefficient vector corresponds to one pattern of the map, containing both EEG and locational information. Examples of the evaluation are shown in the maps of fast activities induced by the injection of thiopental, diazepam or both drugs to an adult volunteer. In 5 experimental situations (A, control; B, thiopental; C, thiopental and diazepam; D, diazepam; and E, diazepam and thiopental administration), the polynomial coefficient vectors were obtained. When Mahalanobis distances (Q value) between the 2 maps for the 5 situations, arranged in 8 different combinations, were calculated, the values corresponded significantly to the pattern differences found between the maps. The greater the Q value, the more dominant the pattern difference. The objective evaluation method presented in this report has significant advantages over the subjective method previously reported and should be of interest to investigators attempting to quantify topographical pattern differences.", 
    "14": "The ulcer healing effect of the combination of pirenzepine and cimetidine was compared to the cimetidine monotherapy in 60 duodenal ulcer patients, in whom previous cimetidine monotherapy (at the dose of 1000 mg/day for 4 weeks) had not produced any healing effect. The study was conducted in a prospective, double blind, random fashion. In 30 patients the cimetidine monotherapy was continued at the dose of 1000 mg/day. The other 30 patients received the combination of pirenzepine (75 mg/day) and cimetidine (400 mg at bedtime). Endoscopy was carried out before and after 4 weeks therapy. In the cimetidine group the ulcers have been cured in 12 cases. The cure rate was higher with the combination therapy: control endoscopy showed healed ulcers in 24 patients in this group. The difference between the two groups is statistically significant (chi 2-Test: 10.0, p less than 0.001). These results indicated a higher effectiveness of the pirenzepine-cimetidine combination in duodenal ulcer patients who had not previously responded to cimetidine alone.", 
    "15": "Previous studies have suggested that beta blockers might be useful in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was therefore conducted to compare results with atenolol versus those with placebo in patients hospitalized with alcohol withdrawal syndrome. In addition to receiving customary therapy, patients were randomly assigned to receive atenolol (61 patients) or placebo (59 patients). Outcome was assessed daily by the measurement of nine features in three categories: vital signs, clinical signs (eg, tremor), and behavioral signs (eg, agitation). Among patients who had withdrawal symptoms at baseline, vital signs became normal more rapidly in the patients receiving atenolol; abnormal behavior and clinical characteristics also resolved more rapidly. On each treatment day, significantly fewer patients receiving atenolol required concomitant oxazepam therapy for agitation. Patients receiving placebo, however, required a significantly higher mean daily dose of oxazepam. The results indicate that atenolol is helpful in the treatment of patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "16": "Details of consumption of hypnotic drugs derived from a nationally representative sample of elderly people were analysed in terms of the prevalence, duration, and likely frequency of use. Of 1020 randomly selected subjects aged 65 and over 16% (166) reported using (mainly benzodiazepine) hypnotic drugs, and of these 89% reported having taken such a drug the night before the interview. Most of these users (73%) had been taking hypnotic drugs for more than one year, with 25% reporting drug use for more than 10 years. These results suggest that for most elderly users of hypnotic drugs, patterns of consumption encourage the development of cumulative effects and benzodiazepine dependence.", 
    "17": "The physical and psychological health of long term (over one year) users of benzodiazepines in one general practice was assessed by patients' self reporting of illness and by general practitioners' records. Of 3741 patients registered with the practice, 82 had been prescribed a benzodiazepine, and 64 of these agreed to enter the study. All but five of these patients were over 40 years of age, nearly a third (19) were given a diagnosis related to depression by interviewers, and between a third and a half reported a current physical illness. Long term treatment with benzodiazepines is not necessarily optimum management but may reflect the realities of general practice.", 
    "18": "High affinity recognition sites for benzodiazepines are part of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) supramolecular complex on the plasma membrane of neurons in the mammalian brain. Synthetic agonist benzodiazepines promote GABA-ergic neurotransmission, and hence the hypnotic and anxiolytic effects of this class of drugs, by binding to these sites. A normal physiological role for these binding sites is unknown, and an endogenous ligand for benzodiazepine receptors has not been definitely identified in normal animals. In animals and human beings with hepatic encephalopathy, however, benzodiazepine receptor antagonists have induced amelioration of the encephalopathy, and an endogenous substance that competitively binds to benzodiazepine receptors has been found in cerebrospinal fluid. These findings suggest that an endogenous ligand for the benzodiazepine receptor with agonist properties contributes to hepatic encephalopathy by promoting GABA-ergic neurotransmission.", 
    "19": "Studies were performed to evaluate the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to cell membranes from the brain cortex of rats that were made tolerant, by the i.p. administration of nitrazepam once daily, to the anxiolytic and sedative effects (after 14 days) and the anticonvulsant action (electroshock, after 28 days) of nitrazepam. A significant decrease in the number of specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites was found only in the group that was tolerant to the anticonvulsant effect. The same experiments were also carried out with oxazepam. Since there were no signs of tolerance, the administration of the drug, 10 mg/kg once daily i.p., was continued for 6 weeks. No tolerance occurred and there were no changes in [3H]flunitrazepam binding site density. We conclude that tolerance to the anticonvulsant effect of nitrazepam could be related to the down-regulation of the benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "20": "The effect of chronic ethanol exposure, withdrawal from chronic exposure and short-term ethanol exposure on mouse brain peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) and on PBR from selected peripheral tissues was studied. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed an ethanol-containing liquid diet for 7.75 or 9 days under conditions which produced physical dependence. Control mice received the diet with isocaloric carbohydrates substituted for ethanol. The binding of [3H]Ro5-4864 to PBR was increased in brain membranes, but not heart or kidney membranes, of mice exposed to ethanol for 7.75 days. Scatchard plot analysis indicated that the increase was due to an increase in the apparent number of binding sites and not to a change in receptor affinity. The same results were obtained in ethanol-dependent mice that were withdrawn from the ethanol for 12 h prior to binding determinations. The binding of [3H]PK-11195 to brain PBR was likewise increased in mice made physically dependent on ethanol after 9 days exposure. In contrast to the effects of chronic exposure using the liquid diet, repeated short-term exposure to ethanol following a procedure known to cause functional tolerance (3.6 g/kg i.p. once daily for 4 days) did not significantly affect the binding of [3H]Ro5-4864 to brain when compared to saline-injected and naive control mice. The results are consistent with previous findings and suggest that ethanol exposure causes time-dependent changes in brain PBR that may be linked to the development of physical dependence. However, further studies are necessary to determine whether the increase in brain PBR sites of alcohol-dependent mice is causally related to the development of alcohol dependence.", 
    "21": "The adipocyte P2 (aP2) gene contains a regulatory element, FSE2, that functions during adipocyte differentiation and binds a protein complex containing the product of the fos proto-oncogene (Fos). We show here that the quantitative and qualitative nature of the FSE2 binding complex closely reflects the status of Fos expression within a given cell type. There is a dramatic increase in the FSE2 binding complex when Fos levels are induced with serum, benzodiazepine, and nerve growth factor or are expressed from a v-fos gene. Immunoblotting analysis of DNA retardation gels indicates a comigration of FSE2 complex with the predominant Fos species. Using a combination of mutational analyses of FSE2 and competition for binding with related sequences, we show that the Fos complex recognizes DNA containing the sequence TGACTCA, previously identified as the consensus binding site for the transcription factors AP-1 in mammalian cells and GCN4 in yeast. The simultaneous presence in cell extracts of proteins related to both AP-1 and Fos with similar sequence recognition properties was demonstrated by photo-cross-linking to FSE2 DNA and immunoprecipitating with antibodies directed toward c-fos or v-jun. These results suggest a functional relationship between Fos and AP-1.", 
    "22": "The action of an antagonist of peripheral CCK receptors, L-364,718 on CCK8 and bombesin-induced pancreatic exocrine secretion was studied in anaesthetized rats. Both CCK8 and bombesin increased the rate of flow and rate of enzyme secretion from the pancreas. Intravenous L-364,718 inhibited the actions of CCK8, but not those of bombesin. It is concluded that bombesin acts on the exocrine pancreas directly rather than through the release of CCK.", 
    "23": "Substances were found in purified fractions from pig brain that enhanced the specific binding of [3H]diazepam to membranes from rat brain in vitro. These substances were identified as oleic acid, arachidonic acid and docosahexenoic acid. Oleic acid (10(-5) - 10(-4)M) increased the affinity for agonists binding to the benzodiazepine receptor, whereas the binding of antagonists to this receptor was only slightly enhanced. The number of [3H]muscimol binding sites was increased, whereas binding of [3H]SR 95331, a GABA receptor antagonist, was unchanged. The effect of oleic acid was additional to the GABA-induced enhancement of [3H]diazepam binding.", 
    "24": "Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to investigate, in the living baboon, the in vivo modulation of [11C]Ro 15-1788 binding to benzodiazepine receptors in brain and the changes with ligands acting at the supramolecular complex during status epilepticus induced by pentylenetetrazole. The central type benzodiazepine receptors were labelled in vivo by intravenous injection of [11C]Ro 15-1788. Simultaneous positron emission tomography and electroencephalographic activity recording evidenced a modulation of the brain binding of [11C]Ro 15-1788 during pentylenetetrazole-induced status epilepticus. We investigated the changes in the modulation of radioligand kinetics and in seizure activity after intravenous administration of a benzodiazepine agonist (diazepam, 1.5 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine antagonist (Ro 15-1788, 2 mg/kg), a GABA agonist (progabide, 50 mg/kg) and a ligand of the picrotoxin/barbiturate binding sites (LY81067, 3.5 mg/kg). The results showed that there is an in vivo competitive interaction of pentylenetetrazole with the benzodiazepine receptors, as reflected by the low displacement of [11C]Ro 15-1788 in the first 10 min of the status epilepticus. However, in contrast to diazepam, progabide and LY81067, a dose (2 mg/kg) of Ro 15-1788 that saturates the benzodiazepine receptors was unable to block the seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole. This indicates that the benzodiazepine receptors play only a minor role in the status epilepticus induced by pentylenetetrazole. The contribution of other binding sites within the supramolecular complex is assessed.", 
    "25": "The effects of single oral doses of the anxiolytics buspirone (Bespar, 5 mg) and diazepam (5 mg) on psychomotor and cognitive parameters were compared to placebo in 6 healthy male volunteers in a randomised double-blind 3-way crossover design with a 7-day wash-out period in between. Psychomotor and cognitive measurements were taken using the Oculodynamic Test (ODT) for oculomotor, performance and additional cardiorespiratory parameters. Surface electromyogram (EMG, relative activity) and dynamometric measures (force) were registered by an EMG-Force-Chair (EFC), with the measurement of maximal force and EMG-force-slopes. Visual analogue scales with regard to sedation, excitation and anxiety were performed. Intradiurnal assessments were done at -1, +1, +3, +5 h post-dose. The results indicate that 5 mg buspirone behaves more or less like placebo with respect to its objective psychomotor and cognitive side-effect pattern and is significantly less detrimental than diazepam, which displays a clear pattern of psychomotor and cognitive impairment, an alteration of the EMG-force slope, which demonstrates an inefficient-increase in the recruitment of muscle fibers under isometric dynamic conditions for maintaining an experimentally pre-fixed force, and display an increase of subjective sedation and a decrease of subjective excitation in the visual analogue scales. ODT effects of diazepam were maximal at 1 h, EMG-force effects at 3 h.", 
    "26": "In order to characterize the muscarinic binding site on coronary smooth muscle, we investigated the binding properties of (3H)quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) in membrane preparations of pig coronary arteries and atria. Scatchard analysis and Hill plot showed that (3H)QNB binds to a single population of sites in both tissues. The binding profiles of the muscarine receptor antagonists atropine, 11-[2-[dimethylamino)methyl)-1-piperidinyl)acetyl)-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrid o(2,3- b) (1,4)benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116), pirenzepine, and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiobromide (4-DAMP) in both tissues were compared with binding data from other tissues, representative for different muscarinic binding site subtypes. It is concluded that the pig coronary smooth muscle muscarinic binding site is different from M1 and M2 binding sites investigated so far.", 
    "27": "GABA mimetics such as baclofen, aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) and diazepam decreased naloxone-precipitated abstinence wet dog shakes in morphine dependent rats. The GABA antagonists bicuculline and picrotoxin were not effective in small doses. The inhibition of wet dog shakes by baclofen, AOAA and diazepam was not reversed by bicuculline. This suggests that baclofen, AOAA and diazepam may inhibit morphine wet dog shakes not by direct GABA receptor stimulation. Inhibition by baclofen of wet dog shakes was reversed by 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) suggesting that the inhibiting effects of GABA mimetics are mediated by serotoninergic neurons.", 
    "28": "Recent studies of the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) suggest lack of specificity for the diagnosis of melancholia. An earlier study showed that high doses of benzodiazepines lead to DST normalisation in depressed patients. This present study examines the effect of benzodiazepine withdrawal on the DST in a middle aged, non-depressed group. Forty-eight volunteers from a double blind placebo-controlled trial of triazolam 0.5 mg and lormetazepam 2 mg all suppressed normally when given the DST on the sixth day of withdrawal following 25 days of drug.", 
    "29": "Adjunctive drinking was generated in three free-feeding rhesus monkeys by the contingent and intermittent delivery of flavored pellets. The amount of drinking generated was greater when pellet availability was restricted under fixed-interval schedules compared to a massed-reinforcer control condition. The volume of water consumed depended upon the fixed-interval of pellet delivery (FI 180 sec to FI 1800 sec). Peak amounts of water consumed ranged from 532 ml to 650 ml during the 2 hr sessions and the schedule which generated the most drinking was either FI 420 or FI 600 sec, across monkeys. Variables which did not appear to influence the amount of drinking generated within the session were the amount of water consumed outside the session, the rates of responding maintained by pellet delivery and the pattern of responding for pellet delivery. However, when either cocaine or diazepam was the scheduled reinforcer, these same free-feeding monkeys did not engage in adjunctive drinking. The ability of cocaine and diazepam to generate adjunctive drinking was determined first by gradually decreasing the frequency of pellet delivery while keeping drug delivery constant using a second-order schedule of pellet delivery [FR n(FI 300 sec: drug delivery) with n ranging from 1 to 6]. Second, a range of drug doses was tested under a FI 300 sec schedule (cocaine: 0.01-0.3 mg/kg/injection; diazepam: 0.01-0.56 mg/kg/injection). These results suggest that there may be some restriction on the generation of adjunctive drinking depending upon the nature of the scheduled reinforcer.", 
    "30": "1. Electrically driven chicken and guinea-pig atria were used to investigate the negative inotropic effects of the muscarinic agonists methacholine and acetylcholine (ACh). The release of ACh from isolated hearts into the perfusate in response to (preganglionic) vagal or (pre- and postganglionic) field stimulation was bioassayed on the guinea-pig ileum or determined by labelling with [3H]-choline. 2. Concentration-response curves for the negative inotropic effect of methacholine were shifted to the right by pirenzepine in various concentrations (0.03 to 10 mumol l-1). The pA2 values were 7.76 in chicken atria and 6.53 in guinea-pig atria. Pirenzepine and atropine antagonized the negative inotropic response to 0.3 mumol l-1 ACh. The half-maximally effective concentrations (IC50) of pirenzepine (Pz) and atropine were 40 and 5.4 nmol l-1 in chicken atria and 330 and 3.5 nmol l-1, respectively, in guinea-pig atria. Thus, the respective potency ratios (IC50Pz/IC50atropine) were 7.4 and 94.3 in the two species. 3. Pirenzepine in low concentrations increased the release of unlabelled and 3H-labelled ACh from isolated hearts evoked by vagal and field stimulation only in chicken, but not in guinea-pigs. The half-maximally-effective concentration of pirenzepine was about 30 nmol l-1 in the chicken heart, whereas, in the guinea-pig heart, an increased release was observed at 300 nmol l-1. 4. (+)-Tubocurarine [(+)-Tc; 100 mumol l-1] reduced the release of ACh evoked by (preganglionic) vagal stimulation to a (+)-Tc-resistant release of about 30%. The time-course of the neuronal release of [3H]-ACh was markedly altered: the onset was delayed and the termination was extended beyond the period of stimulation (1 min or 5s) by several seconds. The (+)-Tc-resistant release was nearly abolished by 30 nmol l-1 pirenzepine. 5. In conclusion, the pre- and post-synaptic muscarinic receptors of the parasympathetic neuroeffector junction of the heart both belong to the M1-subtype in the chicken and to an M2-subtype in the guinea-pig. Block of the nicotinic ganglionic transmission in the chicken heart by (+)-Tc unmasked a muscarinic transmission, which presumably was mediated through M1-receptors stimulating a low and prolonged postganglionic release of ACh.", 
    "31": "1. The possible interaction (as indicated by rat experiments) between calcium channel blocking agents and benzodiazepines has been evaluated in nine healthy subjects. 2. Subsequently to an intravenous loading dose (0.07 mg kg-1) midazolam was infused for 6 h (0.035 mg kg-1 h-1) and steady state plasma levels between 54 to 114 micrograms l-1 were achieved. Two hours after the bolus of midazolam a solution of 20 mg nitrendipine or placebo was administered in a randomized, double-blind crossover fashion. 3. The marked sedative-hypnotic effects of midazolam as assessed by visual analogue scales (about four fold increase in the sedation index) and choice reaction time (100% prolongation) indicated some form of adaptation or tolerance towards the end of the infusion. However, the midazolam-induced impairments were not affected by nitrendipine. 4. EEG-data indicated stabile benzodiazepine-like effects during the complete infusion period of midazolam (e.g. decrease in alpha activity, increase in sigma, delta 2 and beta 1 activity). Again, these alterations were not modified by nitrendipine. 5. There was also no pharmacokinetic interaction between both agents, since elimination of midazolam (t 1/2 = 2.5 +/- 0.8 h; CL = 548 +/- 143 ml min-1) was in close agreement with control values (t 1/2 = 2.4 +/- 0.6 h; CL = 512 +/- 102 ml min-1). Likewise, plasma levels of nitrendipine were comparable to literature data. 6. Thus, it could be concluded that nitrendipine does not affect the action of midazolam and therefore a direct involvement of calcium at the benzodiazepine receptor site is unlikely under our clinical conditions.", 
    "32": "Two experiments were conducted to test the antiepileptic properties of CL 218-872, a triazolopyridizine reported to have anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects without accompanying sedative and ataxic effects. In Experiment 1 pretreatment with CL 218-872, a recently synthesized and potent triazolopyridizine, reduced kainic acid-induced convulsions and subsequent neuropathology in rats given ip doses of 25 mg/kg or greater. CL 218-872 at doses of 50 mg/kg or greater was more effective than a high dose of diazepam (20 mg/kg) in blocking status epilepticus-like convulsions and the associated widespread neuropathological sequelae. Moreover, diazepam pretreatment was associated with a higher mortality rate than CL 218-872. In Experiment 2 the efficacy of intervention with 20 mg/kg diazepam was compared with that of 50 mg/kg CL 218-872 in suppressing ongoing convulsions and reducing subsequent brain damage following a convulsant dose of kainic acid. Although CL 218-872 and diazepam were equally effective behaviorally (i.e., in suppressing kainic acid-induced convulsions), CL 218-872 was superior in its ability to reduce subsequent neuropathology, especially in the hippocampus and neocortex. Because kainic acid has been suggested as a model for human status epilepticus, CL 218-872 may be a potentially therapeutic treatment for this disorder.", 
    "33": "Cardiorespirographic parameters undergo a series of evolutionary modifications during first hours of life, becoming stable between the sixth and twelfth. The authors analyse how these parameters are influenced by the administration to the mother of thiopental and diazepam plus thiopental during birth. They observed a significant reduction, during the first hour after birth, in the range and frequency of accelerations in the newborn babies whose mothers had been administered one of the drugs. Also, they observed a greater number of cases of decelerations in the newborns who were given drugs. No significant differences were observed in other parameters, and after the twelfth hour no differences were observed at all.", 
    "34": "We performed a retrospective chart analysis of 33 patients with an Emergency Department discharge diagnosis of phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication. All 33 cases presented to the Emergency Department between November 1986 and April 1987. Thirty of the 33 patients (91%) were classified as mildly intoxicated (per clinical syndrome as described by Aronow and Done) while the remaining 3 patients (9%) were moderately intoxicated. Two of the patients (6%) required benzodiazepine therapy for agitation while an additional 3 patients (9%) required haloperidol for psychotic symptoms. Twenty-three patients (70%) did not require any medication. Of particular interest was our finding that 11 of the 27 males (41%) required leather restraints for agitation or violent behavior while none of the 6 female patients required leather restraints (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.00078). While nursing perception of physical strength may be a confounder, level of agitation and violent behavior is our primary indication for use of restraints. We believe that there is a sexual disparity in level of agitation and violent behavior induced by PCP. We hypothesize that this may be due to pharmacokinetic factors (such as difference in body fat distribution between the sexes) or biological differences in the central nervous system.", 
    "35": "The anticholinergic antiparkinsonian drugs biperiden, benztropine, trihexyphenidyl, methixene, and procyclidine were compared with atropine and pirenzepine, as well as with orphenadrine, amantadine and some standard antidepressives and neuroleptics in their ability to inhibit the binding of tritiated quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) to the muscarinic receptors in rat brain cortical tissue. Most of the antiparkinsonian drugs studied were potent inhibitors of (-)3H-QNB binding, when compared to atropine (IC50-value = 0.22 microM), the IC50-values ranging from 0.0084 microM (biperiden) to 0.07 microM (procyclidine). Orphenadrine had a low and amantadine no evident affinity for muscarinic receptors. With the exception of pirenzepine and biperiden the inhibition curves were steep and parallel, giving linear Hill plots with coefficients close to unity. The binding profile of atropine, pirenzepine, and biperiden was further studied in heart and lung tissues, atropine showing only small divergences in its binding to the different tissues, but biperiden and pirenzepine having five to ten times lower affinity in the peripheral tissues than in the brain. The results confirm the high affinity of most of the antiparkinsonian drugs for brain muscarinic receptors. The dissociation constants agree with the average clinical doses of the drugs. It must be remembered, however, that the binding data may represent multiple events at receptor sites because most of the drugs used are mixtures of stereoisomers. Thus further studies using individual enantiomers are needed to compare more directly binding data between the compounds.", 
    "36": "Adult female ponies (130-225 kg) with chronically implanted external biliary fistulas (T-tubes) participated in three-way cross-over studies using either i.v. lorazepam (10 mg) or acetaminophen (2 g), two model drugs biotransformed mainly by hepatic conjugative reactions. The objectives were to determine the systemic pharmacokinetics, urinary and biliary excretion and degree of enterohepatic circulation (EHC) of these compounds. Trial conditions were: A: EHC intact, with blood and urine, but not bile, collected after i.v. drug administration; B: EHC interrupted, with blood, urine and bile collected after i.v. drug administration; and C: bile infused, EHC open, without i.v. drug administration, with bile collected from trial B (containing biliary excreted drug) infused into the duodenum via the T-tube, followed by collection of blood, urine and bile. At least 2 weeks elapsed between trials. Interruption of the EHC caused lorazepam plasma half-life to shorten (3.4 vs. 2.3 hr with the EHC intact, P less than .1), clearance to increase (9.2 vs. 12.3 ml/min/kg, P less than .1) and total area under the plasma concentration curve for lorazepam glucuronide to decrease (210 vs. 310 ng/ml X hr, P less than .06). Recovery of lorazepam as its glucuronide in bile was 24.5% of the i.v. injected dose. Urinary elimination of lorazepam glucuronide was reduced from 41 to 36% of the dose due to bile collection. Subsequent duodenal infusion of collected bile, containing an average of 2.45 mg of lorazepam as glucuronide, was followed by urinary excretion of 0.48 mg of lorazepam as glucuronide in urine and 0.36 mg re-excreted into bile.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "37": "The authors have characterized the muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtypes in human peripheral lung membranes using the selective muscarinic antagonist [3H]pirenzepine [( 3H]PZ) and the classical muscarinic antagonist [3H](-)-quinuclidinyl benzilate. High-affinity binding with pharmacologic specificity was demonstrated for both radioligands. The high affinity Kd for [3H]PZ binding determined from saturation isotherms was 5.6 nM, and the Kd for [3H](-)-quinuclidinyl benzilate binding was 14.3 pM. Approximately 62% of the total muscarinic binding sites in human peripheral lung bind [3H]PZ with high affinity. There was no significant effect of the guanine nucleotide, guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, on the inhibition of [3H](-)-quinyclidinyl benzilate binding by the muscarinic agonist carbachol in peripheral lung membranes. If the muscarinic receptor with high affinity for PZ has an important role in bronchoconstriction, its characterization could result in the development of more selective bronchodilators.", 
    "38": "Gastric pH was monitored, by means of a computerized system, in healthy controls (C) and in patients with active duodenal ulcer (ADU) and inactive duodenal ulcer (IDU). The test was performed before treatment and during administration of a single dose of ranitidine 150 mg, cimetidine 400 mg, and pirenzepine 50 mg, in random sequence at 12-h intervals, (10 am, 10 pm). Under basal conditions, progressively lower median pH values were detected in ADU and IDU patients, compared with controls. A significant difference was found between C and ADU during daytime (1.38 vs. 0.85), nighttime (1.29 vs. 0.81), and 24 h (1.35 vs. 0.81) and between C and IDU during 24 h (1.35 vs. 1.11). However, no statistical difference was observed between patients with active and inactive ulcer disease. Administration of ranitidine and cimetidine significantly increased gastric pH during nighttime but not during daytime. Ranitidine, at the doses studied, proved to be more potent than cimetidine in suppressing gastric acidity. Gastric pH was unaffected by pirenzepine in most cases.", 
    "39": "The effect of alprazolam on essential tremor was examined by a double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel study of 24 patients. Results indicated that patients treated with alprazolam had significant improvement in tremor. Transient mild fatigue or sedation in 50% of patients was the primary side effect. Alprazolam may provide therapeutic benefit, especially in patients who require only intermittent therapy.", 
    "40": "A technique was developed to evaluate the potency of ligand binding at M2 ACh receptors and to experimentally localize the M1 and M2 subtypes to specific neuronal processes. Normal and experimental material was prepared with tritiated ligand binding to cryostat-sectioned area 29c of posterior cingulate cortex in rat, coverslip autoradiography, and single-grain-counting techniques. Three fundamental issues were addressed. 1. A morphological criterion termed an index of heterogeneity was developed by which the specificity of M2 binding by different ligands could be assessed. The index was calculated by first determining the laminar distribution of pirenzepine (PZ) binding sites and then summing absolute laminar variations from this distribution for each ligand. According to this measure the most efficient protocol for assaying M2 sites was tritiated oxotremorine-M (OXO) coincubated in unlabeled PZ (5 x 10(-8) M). The classical muscarinic antagonist propylbenzilylcholine mustard (Pr-BCM), however, when coincubated in PZ, was almost as efficient as PZ-blocked OXO binding. 2. Terminal axons of neurons in the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) have M2 receptors based on the following observations. First, specific binding of the M1 ligand PZ was unaffected by ATN lesions. Second, tritiated OXO and PrBCM binding blocked with unlabeled PZ, conditions favoring M2 receptor binding, showed significant reductions in binding in layers la, lb, and IV following ATN ablations. Third, IC50 values as determined by competition of PZ for PrBCM binding sites were shifted to lower concentrations in superficial layers by ATN lesions but not in deep layers where the thalamus does not terminate. Finally, in contrast to PZ-blocked OXO and PrBCM binding, binding of PZ-blocked 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) was reduced to homogeneity following ATN lesions. 3. Cortical pyramidal neurons have dendritic receptors that are primarily of the M1 subtype but may also include M2 sites. Thus, full depth ibotenic acid lesions reduced PZ binding by almost 70%. Neurotoxin lesions of neurons in layers II-IV or Vb-VI were followed by degeneration of the apical dendrites of pyramids in layer I and 78 and 15% reductions, respectively, in PZ binding. Also, full-depth neurotoxin lesions combined with ATN ablations completely abolished heterogeneities in PrBCM and PZ-blocked OXO binding. These data demonstrate that experimental techniques can be used in conjunction with normal material to make morphological assessments of the efficiency of binding of putative M2 ligands.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "41": "Stimulatory cholinergic pathways participate in the regulation of GH release, and cholinergic receptor antagonists inhibit GH secretion in normal man. Whether similar mechanisms are active in subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes is not known, yet this is of potential importance since GH hypersecretion has been implicated in both the acute and chronic complications of diabetes mellitus. To address this question we studied the effects of cholinergic receptor blockade on stimulated GH release in 18 type I diabetic men. Paired tests were performed using 1 of 2 different stimuli (30 g arginine, iv, or physical exercise for 30 min) with or without prior administration of the selective cholinergic muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine (30 mg, iv). Arginine elicited a mean peak serum GH level of 9.0 +/- 1.9 (+/- SEM) micrograms/L, which was completely suppressed by pirenzepine (1.5 +/- 0.4 micrograms/L; n = 8; P less than 0.01). Blood glucose rose after arginine infusion and was not affected by pirenzepine. Serum GH levels rose during physical exercise to a mean peak of 7.3 +/- 1.6 micrograms/L, which was abolished by pirenzepine (1.2 +/- 0.3 micrograms/L; n = 10; P less than 0.01). Blood glucose was not influenced by pirenzepine. Two subjects had no serum GH response to exercise. We conclude that GH secretion in subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes, as in normal subjects, is modulated by cholinergic pathways and is responsive to pharmacological suppression by muscarinic receptor blockade. This may have implications for therapeutic trials designed to lower elevated GH levels in subjects with diabetes mellitus.", 
    "42": "Sixteen patients with panic attacks were treated with alprazolam at an anxiety clinic between March 1982 and April 1983. For all patients charts were reviewed for baseline data and treatment results at 1 and 6 months. Quantitated self-rating scales and the Clinical Global Impressions scale were used to assess progress. Alprazolam appeared effective for panic, agoraphobia, and depressive symptoms in 7 of 11 patients with either panic disorder or agoraphobia with panic attacks (DSM-III-defined diagnoses); side effects occurred in 4 of the 11 patients, were limited to oversedation, and resulted in no discontinuations of drug. However, alprazolam was ineffective in controlling panic, agoraphobia, and depression in 5 patients with panic attacks and secondary major depressive episode; for this group of patients, side effects were apparently paradoxical and required drug discontinuation in 3 of these 5 patients.", 
    "43": "Three daily injections of the short-acting benzodiazepine, triazolam, induced pronounced phase shifts in the onset of both the circadian surge in pituitary LH release and the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity in ovariectomized hamsters treated with estrogen. Both the magnitude and the direction of the phase shifts in these two rhythms were similar. These results indicate that a master circadian clock underlying diverse behavioral and endocrine rhythms can be reset by treatment with triazolam.", 
    "44": "Benzodiazepine-affinity chromatography, on a column of 1012S-Sepharose, resulted in the detection and purification of a binding protein (P36) from the cytosolic fraction of pig cerebral cortex. Purified P36 was enriched over 3,500-fold in a single step and was recovered with an efficiency of 50-60%. Analysis of the purified preparation by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated a single polypeptide of Mr 36,000. The Stokes radius (3.44 nm) and sedimentation coefficient (4.43S) indicated that purified P36 is a dimeric protein. Analysis of the amino acid composition of P36 revealed a relatively high content of the hydrophobic amino acids, valine and leucine. Immunoblotting of several pig tissue preparations with an antiserum raised against purified P36 demonstrated approximately equal enrichment of P36 in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and adrenal glands. Lesser enrichment was observed in kidney and liver, whereas a number of other tissues displayed no immunoreactivity. The gamma-aminobutyrate/benzodiazepine receptor complex and P36 showed no immunological cross-reactivity. High-affinity binding activity for [3H]Ro 15-4513, [3H]flunitrazepam, or [3H]PK11195 was not detected in preparations of purified P36. However, the ability of the gamma-aminobutyrate/benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists, methyl- and ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, to inhibit the binding of P36 to 1012S-Sepharose at relatively low concentrations indicates that P36 exhibits a degree of binding specificity.", 
    "45": "Perioperative effects of buprenorphine during and after combined anesthesia for gynecological laparotomies were compared to those of morphine. In a controlled, randomized study two similar groups of patients received flunitrazepam (0.016 mg/kg) and either buprenorphine (0.008 mg/kg) or morphine (0.333 mg/kg); all patients were ventilated with a N2O/O2-mixture. To maintain adequate anesthesia, additional injections of buprenorphine or morphine and a volatile anesthetic agent (enflurane, less than 1.0 vol.%) were administered as needed. In some patients in both groups the injection of thiopental (1-2 mg/kg) became necessary for induction of anesthesia. Hemodynamic parameters showed a slight but not significant increase during intubation and remained stable intraoperatively (Figs. 1 and 2). The frequencies of additional intraoperative injections of buprenorphine or morphine and modalities of enflurane administration were similar in both groups. Based on an awakeness score, recovery from anesthesia was similar in both groups (Fig. 3). All patients were pain-free for a long period postoperatively (pain score 1-2, duration 6-10 h) (Fig. 4). In both groups respiratory depression could be demonstrated by means of ventilatory CO2 response (Figs. 6 and 7). The respiratory depression was of no clinical importance and seems to have been due to the combination of a long-acting benzodiazepine with an opiate. There were no differences in the occurrence of nausea and vomiting in both groups. Buprenorphine seems to be an alternative to morphine in combined anesthesia.", 
    "46": "Adinazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine, was compared with amitriptyline and placebo in a double-blind protocol involving melancholic depressives. Forty-eight patients entered the study, and 35 completed 6 weeks of evaluation. Patients were well matched in each of the groups. Initially, the adinazolam group showed more improvement than the placebo group, but this trend did not persist beyond day 7. The amitriptyline group tended to show more improvement than either the placebo or adinazolam groups, and final scores were significantly better for amitriptyline. Depressive symptoms in the amitriptyline dropout group appeared improved, whereas in the adinazolam and placebo dropout groups they were unchanged or worse. Both amitriptyline and adinazolam were more frequently associated with complaints of side effects than placebo. Thus, amitriptyline was observed to be superior to adinazolam and placebo in improvement in depressive symptoms while adinazolam had only a brief early advantage over placebo.", 
    "47": "Brotizolam is a new thienotriazolodiazepine derivative with a pharmacological profile similar to that of benzodiazepines. It is indicated for use as an hypnotic in the management of insomnia, although it also has anticonvulsant, antianxiety and muscle relaxant properties in animals. In clinical trials brotizolam 0.125 to 0.5mg improved sleep in insomniacs similarly to nitrazepam 2.5 and 5mg, flunitrazepam 2mg and triazolam 0.25mg, whilst brotizolam 0.5mg was shown to be superior to flurazepam 30mg in some studies. Brotizolam is an effective hypnotic for hospital patients awaiting surgery, in whom it also reduces anxiety. Brotizolam has an elimination half-life of about 5 hours, which is 'intermediate' compared with the shorter-acting hypnotic, triazolam, and longer-acting benzodiazepines. Consequently, it is able to induce sleep without producing early morning rebound insomnia, and can also maintain sleep throughout the night. Brotizolam at dosages below 0.5mg at night usually produced minimal morning drowsiness; no residual impairment of psychomotor performance occurs following dosages within the recommended range of 0.125 to 0.25 mg/kg. No serious side effects have been reported to date and the most frequently observed adverse experiences are drowsiness, headache and dizziness. Mild rebound insomnia may occur in some patients when treatment is stopped. Thus, brotizolam is a useful hypnotic which can be used in patients who have difficulty in falling asleep and also in patients who are troubled by night-time awakenings. Used in the recommended dosage it may be particularly useful for patients in whom daytime impairment of performance is unacceptable.", 
    "48": "Objective quantification of the symptoms of Meige's syndrome is difficult and has not been performed in the majority of pharmacological studies of Meige's syndrome published so far. The aim of the present study was to reexamine the therapeutic potential of biperiden, clonazepam, haloperidol, and lisuride using an objective method of quantification of the symptoms. Eleven patients received daily i.v. injections of biperiden, 5.0 mg; clonazepam, 1.0 mg; haloperidol, 2.5 mg; lisuride, 0.05 mg; and placebo in randomized order. The symptoms of the patients [idiopathic blepharospasm (IB), in 11 patients, oromandibular dystonia (OMD) in four patients] were quantified by a blind observer counting the frequencies and recording the cumulative duration of sustained spasms of IB and OMD over periods of 4 min before, and 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after the i.v. challenges. Baseline quantification of IB and OMD was performed at identical intervals on randomized days of the trial. Significant improvement of the IB scores was found in response to biperiden and clonazepam and a trend toward improvement in response to lisuride (Wilcoxon test). Evaluation of the individual IB scores of each patient following the various drug challenges failed to predict the therapeutic potential of these drugs for subsequent oral treatment.", 
    "49": "Using a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled experimental protocol, the authors compared two premedication regimens in 42 patients undergoing elective myocardial revascularization. Group L patients (n = 23) received lorazepam 0.06 mg/kg po 90 min preoperatively, while group M patients (n = 19) received morphine 0.1 mg/kg im, plus scopolamine 0.006 mg/kg im 60 min preoperatively. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 100 micrograms/kg and atracurium 0.50 mg/kg administered over 10 min. The treatment groups did not differ significantly with respect to the degree of sedation or anxiolysis achieved, or the rapidity of induction with fentanyl. Premedication significantly influenced the hemodynamic response to anesthetic induction. Hemodynamics were stable post-induction in group M, but cardiovascular depression was noted in group L. Control heart rate (HR) was lower in group L. The HR, arterial pressure, and cardiac index were significantly lower, following both induction and intubation, in group L. Following sternotomy hemodynamics were identical in both groups. Serum fentanyl concentration was significantly higher during intubation in group L, probably secondary to the pharmacokinetic consequences of a decreased CI. New electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia did not occur in either group. Based on their findings with fentanyl-at-racurium, and their review of the literature, the authors speculate that premedication exerts a significant hemodynamic effect during induction with other narcotic-relaxant combinations.", 
    "50": "We studied the effect of clonazepam in a double-blind trial on 12 parkinsonian patients with hypokinetic dysarthria. Speech samples were judged on 14 of the dimensions used in the Mayo Clinic dysarthria study. Of the 11 patients who completed the study, 10 showed improvement. The effective dosage of clonazepam was 0.25 to 0.5 mg/d with higher dosage than that less effective. Clonazepam has a definite role in the management of parkinsonian dysarthria.", 
    "51": "In a randomized, nonblinded clinical trial, 36 consecutive patients with generalized convulsive status epilepticus were treated with either combination diazepam and phenytoin (DZ/DPH) or phenobarbital (PB). Phenytoin was added to the PB regimen if seizures persisted for 10 minutes after beginning therapy. The cumulative convulsion time (total time spent in active convulsive movements) was shorter for the PB group than for the DZ/DPH group (median, 5 versus 9 minutes, p less than 0.06); the response latency (elapsed time from initiation of therapy to the end of the last convulsion) was also shorter for the PB group (median, 5.5 versus 15 minutes, p less than 0.10). The median cumulative convulsion time is between 0 and 14 minutes shorter for the PB regimen than for the DZ/DPH regimen (95% confidence interval). Similarly, the median response latency for the PB regimen is between 1 minute longer and 20 minutes shorter than that for the DZ/DPH regimen (95% confidence interval). The frequencies of intubation, hypotension, and arrhythmias were similar in the two groups. Eleven of 18 patients in the PB group responded to phenobarbital monotherapy. We conclude that the PB regimen is rapidly effective, comparable in safety, and enjoys certain practical advantages in comparison with the DZ/DPH regimen.", 
    "52": "Sixteen female outpatients with borderline personality disorder and prominent behavioral dyscontrol, but without a current episode of major depression, were studied in a double-blind, crossover trial of placebo and the following four active medications: alprazolam (average dose, 4.7 mg/d); carbamazepine (average dose, 820 mg/d); trifluoperazine hydrochloride (average dose, 7.8 mg/d); and tranylcypromine sulfate (average dose, 40 mg/d). Each trial was designed to last six weeks. Tranylcypromine and carbamazepine trials had the highest completion rates. Physicians rated patients as significantly improved relative to placebo while receiving tranylcypromine and carbamazepine. Patients rated themselves as significantly improved relative to placebo only while receiving tranylcypromine. Patients who tolerated a full trial of trifluoperazine showed improvement, those receiving carbamazepine demonstrated a marked decrease in the severity of behavioral dyscontrol, and those receiving alprazolam had an increase in the severity of the episodes of serious dyscontrol. As an adjunct to psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy can produce modest but clinically important improvement in the mood and behavior of patients with borderline personality disorder. As a research tool, patterns of pharmacological response may provide clues to biological mechanisms underlying dysphoria and behavioral dyscontrol.", 
    "53": "A case of postpartum eclampsia is reported, controlled by intravenous clonazepam, a benzodiazepine anticonvulsant. Clonazepam was effective in controlling the myoclonic jerks, which were a feature in this patient, without producing excessive sedation. The literature reveals several reports on the use of clonazepam in severe preeclampsia, but its use in Australia has not been widely employed.", 
    "54": "Trends in the reported rates of suicide by self-poisoning in the elderly from 1974 to 1984 are presented. When all drugs were considered together there was evidence of a slow but progressive decline in age specific rates of suicide in both sexes over the period studied. When individual drugs were considered, however, the overall fall was attributable almost exclusively to a fall in suicides using barbiturates, which reflected the decrease in barbiturate prescribing over this time. Suicides using other drugs, particularly benzodiazepines and analgesics for mild to moderate pain, increased, particularly among elderly women, with coproxamol showing the biggest increase over the period studied. In many cases deaths were the result of multiple drug ingestion. Implications for the management of the elderly at risk are discussed in the context of the difficulties in identifying depressive illness in the elderly and the general rise in the elderly population.", 
    "55": "The benzodiazepine antagonist ethyl 8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4] benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (flumazenil, Ro 15-1788, Anexate) was investigated in a series of toxicological studies. In a single intravenous injection study in male and female mice and rats, the highest non-lethal (maximum tolerated) doses were found to be between 62.5 and 125 mg/kg (the amounts of flumazenil present in the aqueous ampoules available for intravenous injection in man are 0.5 and 1.0 mg). In intravenous studies of 4 weeks duration, 10 mg/kg/d were systemically well tolerated in dogs and rats. In 13-week oral studies, 80 mg/kg/d were very well tolerated in dogs (capsule administration) and, after 125 mg/kg/d (by feed-admix) in rats, no untoward compound-related findings apart from a 10-15% increase of the liver weights in females were made. In reproductive toxicity studies, flumazenil revealed no drug-related embryotoxic or teratogenic effect and no adverse effects upon fertility of dosed animals themselves or on the peri- and postnatal development of their offspring. There was no indication for mutagenic potential of flumazenil in vitro concerning induction of gene mutations or clastogenic effects. An in vivo DNA repair test using germ cells of male mice did not yield DNA-damaging activities. From all these toxicological investigations it can be concluded that the risk in man given therapeutic doses or even intentional or accidental overdoses of flumazenil is extremely small.", 
    "56": "The effects of a continuous high-dose infusion of midazolam on cerebral function, metabolism, and hemodynamics were studied in nine dogs receiving a spinal anesthetic and breathing 65% nitrogen/35% oxygen. In five dogs, the effects of 65% nitrous oxide (N2O) inspired and the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 were also examined. Midazolam was infused at a rate of 0.66 mg.kg-1.min-1 for 60 min for a total dose of 40 mg.kg-1. Cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) (measured by venous outflow technique) both decreased until a plateau level was reached at approximately 75% of control values (4.0 +/- 0.2 ml.min-1.100 g-1 and 49 +/- 3 ml.min-1.100 g-1, respectively, mean +/- SEM). This occurred after 6-10 mg.kg-1 of midazolam, corresponding to serum midazolam levels between 18.4 +/- 3.8 and 31.2 +/- 3.3 micrograms.ml-1. Serum midazolam levels increased throughout the midazolam infusion, reaching a mean value of 53 +/- 5.5 micrograms.ml-1 by the end of the midazolam infusion. A similar plateau was seen for changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG), which never developed burst suppression. Five dogs inspired 65% nitrous oxide/35% oxygen during minutes 30-45 of the midazolam infusion, rather than 65% nitrogen/35% oxygen. Nitrous oxide had no effect upon CMRO2, but significantly increased CBF when compared to dogs receiving nitrogen. Ro 15-1788, 1.0 mg.kg-1 caused a return of CMRO2 and EEG activity to control levels. CBF and intracranial pressure (ICP) increased markedly, to greater than control levels immediately following Ro 15-1788.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "57": "Overnight gastric secretion was studied in 32 patients with acute duodenal ulcers before treatment and whilst taking cimetidine 400 mg b.d. After 6 weeks of treatment with cimetidine 400 mg b.d. 13 patients had healed ulcers, seven patients had healed ulcers but a persistent erosive duodenitis, and 12 patients had persisting ulceration. Inhibition of nocturnal gastric secretion by cimetidine 400 mg b.d. was most profound in patients who healed their ulcers completely; a less profound inhibition of nocturnal gastric secretion was seen in the non-healing and duodenitis groups. In patients with persisting ulcers and poor inhibition of nocturnal gastric secretion by cimetidine, gastric secretion could be suppressed by either cimetidine 400 mg b.d. in combination with pirenzepine 50 mg b.d., or by cimetidine 1600 mg nocte, but suppression of nocturnal gastric secretion was more effective with cimetidine 1600 mg than cimetidine with pirenzepine.", 
    "58": "The psychotropic medications reviewed in this paper have widespread clinical applicability in psychiatry and other branches of medicine. These drugs clearly can alter peripheral regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hormones. In general, psychotropic medications when administered acutely have a tendency to increase the output of both adrenal and pituitary hormones associated with the axis; the benzodiazepines appear to be the exception and indeed may decrease axis activity. Psychotropic agents may also alter the results of the dexamethasone suppression test as currently used in psychiatry, since they alter the neurotransmitters that regulate corticotropin-releasing hormone secretion and also because they may change the severity of the underlying pathophysiology. Withdrawal of these drugs after long-term administration may cause an elevation of these hormones, potentially increasing the false-positive rate of the dexamethasone suppression test and other neuroendocrine tests.", 
    "59": "The displacement of midazolam, a new water-soluble, short acting benzodiazepine, from its plasma binding sites by sodium valproate, has been studied in man. An increase of its free fraction (ranging from 2.71 to 5.35%) in plasma from epileptic patients receiving sodium valproate was observed. A similar situation was created in rabbits by pretreatment with sodium valproate (600 mg kg-1 day-1) and posterior hypnosis with midazolam. Due to the interaction, sodium valproate-pretreated rabbits showed an increase in midazolam brain levels (130.91 micrograms g-1 in cortex vs 84.55 micrograms g-1 in control animals). Therefore, it seems likely that displacement of midazolam by sodium valproate in epileptic patients could lead to an increase of the midazolam response.", 
    "60": "In 2021 accident victims (household, work and road accidents) the qualitative test for benzodiazepines in the serum by the EMIT method was positive in 9.6% of cases, including 3.2% of subjects who also had a blood alcohol level greater than 0.10 milligram. Benzodiazepines were detected with a particularly high frequency in household accidents and road accidents and rarely in work accidents. These results raise the problem of the role of benzodiazepines as a possible risk factor for accidents, particularly road accidents.", 
    "61": "Phenazepam (2.5 mg/kg) and aceclidine (4 mg/kg), when introduced in a single injection at the inductive phase of immune response, enhance the production of antibodies after immunization with chemical typhoid vaccine. The combined use of these preparations has been to produce a potentiating effect.", 
    "62": "One hundred patients who underwent day case surgery took part in a randomized double-blind comparison between midazolam 15 mg and temazepam 20 mg orally as premedicants. Postoperative recovery was studied using tests of psychomotor function. Midazolam produced a similar degree of anxiolysis to temazepam and a greater incidence of drowsiness. Recovery was similar after either premedicant and psychomotor function was still depressed 4 hours postoperatively (p less than 0.001). Nearly 90% of patients felt that they had benefitted from either premedicant. We conclude that midazolam is a suitable drug for premedication in day case surgery.", 
    "63": "One tends to think of the nervous system in terms of chains of excitatory signals that tell neurons to fire. The signals that say \"Don't fire\" also have a major role. Inhibitory signals damp overall neural activity and also fine-tune the responses of particular circuits. The primary carrier of these signals is the inhibitory transmitter known as GABA.", 
    "64": "A series of 3-aryl-6-alkoxy- and some 3-aryl-6-thioalkyl-, 3-aryl-6-alkylsulphinyl-, and 3-aryl-6-alkylsulphonyl-1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-a]phthalazines were synthesised and tested for inhibition of the in vitro binding of 3H-Diazepam to benzodiazepine receptors in membranes isolated from rat brain synaptosomes. 6-Alkoxy-3-(4'-methoxy)phenyl-1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-a]phthalazines were more active than or as active as diazepam in the binding assay (Ki nM) but unlike diazepam their binding to the benzodiazepine receptors was not enhanced by 4-aminobutyric acid. These compounds did not antagonize pentylenetetrazole induced convulsions and were inactive in modifying the conditioned behaviour of rats. Compound (II a) counteracted the muscle relaxant effects of diazepam (traction test). These results suggest that (II a) may be a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist.", 
    "65": "Three behavioral tests, namely, runway activity, horizontal dowel test and hypothermia, were used to compare the effects of Ro15-1788, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, on the common neuropharmacological actions of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) and ethanol in C57BL/6J mice. Ro15-1788 completely reversed the CDP-induced inhibition of runway activity and incoordination on a horizontal dowel, but only partially antagonized the hypothermic effects of CDP. The latter phenomenon was likely to be due to the rapid elimination of Ro15-1788, but could also be due to the fact that hypothermia might not be a specific action of CDP. The sedative actions of ethanol were not antagonized at all by Ro15-1788. In fact, Ro15-1788 potentiated the incoordinating effect of ethanol as determined by the horizontal dowel test such that mice injected with Ro15-1788/ethanol had lower brain ethanol levels than mice injected with vehicle/ethanol when they fell off the dowel. In contrast, mice injected with Ro15-1788/CDP took longer to fall off and had significantly higher CDP levels at fall-off than mice injected with vehicle/CDP. The stimulatory effect of a low dose of ethanol on runway activity was reversed by Ro15-1788. These data are discussed in terms of the possible mechanisms of actions for CDP and ethanol.", 
    "66": "The pharmacological characteristics and anatomical distribution of benzodiazepine receptors in the striatum (dorsal striatum, comprising the caudate nucleus and putamen, and ventral striatum) and globus pallidus (dorsal pallidum, comprising the external and internal segments, and ventral pallidum) of the human basal ganglia were examined in twelve cases aged 4-71 years. The pharmacology of the receptors was studied using computerized, non-linear least-squares regression analysis of [3H]flunitrazepam displacement by flunitrazepam, CL218,872 and ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate binding to membranes. The results showed that the dorsal striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) contained higher concentrations of receptors than the dorsal pallidum (external and internal segments). The dorsal striatum contained equal numbers of sites with high affinity (Type I) and low affinity (Type II) for CL218,872 and ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate whereas the globus pallidus contained sites with only high affinity (Type I) for these ligands. The anatomical localization of the benzodiazepine receptor subtypes (Type I and II) was studied using quantitative autoradiography following in vitro labelling of cryostat sections with [3H]flunitrazepam in the absence or presence of the discriminating ligand CL218,872. The autoradiograms showed that benzodiazepine receptors were distributed throughout all regions of the human striatum in a heterogeneous fashion, i.e. high-density patches of receptors were set against a background matrix of lower receptor densities. The highest densities of receptors were seen in the ventral striatum where the patches were particularly extensive and showed densities 56% higher than the receptor densities in the dorsal striatal patches. Quantitative analysis showed that the patches in all striatal regions contained mainly Type II receptors (83%-86%) whereas the matrix regions in the ventral and dorsal striatum contained different proportions of the receptor subtypes; Type I receptors predominated (60%) in the matrix of the ventral striatum and Type II receptors predominated (67%-71%) in the matrix of the dorsal striatum. By contrast, the autoradiograms showed that the globus pallidus contained considerably lower concentrations of receptors than the striatum. The highest density of receptors in the globus pallidus was present in the ventral pallidum with successively lower concentrations in the external (26% less) and internal (66% less) segments of the dorsal pallidum. In agreement with the membrane binding studies the receptors in the globus pallidus were mainly of the Type I variety.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "67": "Neuronal cortical cell cultures obtained from fetal mice were subjected to an hypoxic insult produced by sodium cyanide (1 mM) for 24 h. Neurochemical assays were performed 13-14 days after plating on intact cells in situ to determine if there was a specific pattern of cellular dysfunction in addition to morphologic change. Ro5-4864-displaceable benzodiazepine (BDZ) binding and high-affinity [3H] beta-alanine uptake were not reduced when compared to control values. However, specific and clonazepam-displaceable BDZ binding (81 +/- 4% and 50 +/- 9% of control values, respectively), high-affinity [3H]GABA uptake (75 +/- 2%), and choline acetyltransferase activity (82 +/- 2%) were significantly lower. When the data were expressed in terms of protein content, high-affinity [3H] beta-alanine uptake was significantly increased in cyanide-exposed and magnesium-treated cultures (123 +/- 5% and 117 +/- 3%, respectively) as was R05-4864-displaceable BDZ binding (152 +/- 14%), consistent with stimulation of nonneuronal BDZ binding and increased glial neurotransmitter uptake. Moreover, pretreatment of the cultures with magnesium effectively prevented both the morphologic and neurochemical evidence of hypoxic injury. These data lend further support to the notion that the release of excitatory neurotransmitters may mediate neurotoxicity in developing brain.", 
    "68": "Phylogenetic research can help to elucidate the structure of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. In this study the evolution of the beta-carboline binding site was traced to see whether it paralleled that of the benzodiazepine binding site. The ratio of [3H]ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) to [3H]flunitrazepam (FNZ) binding sites was determined in several nonmammalian species. The results further substantiate the tight link between these two binding sites. Photoaffinity labelling of the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) has revealed phylogenetic variation of the molecular weight of the benzodiazepine binding proteins. The IC50 values for inhibition of [3H]FNZ by various compounds which are active at the central benzodiazepine receptors were determined in three phylogenetically distant species that each showed distinct subunit patterns. In these species, the respective affinities of the compounds were remarkably similar, suggesting that the binding sites for benzodiazepines are conserved in higher bony fishes and tetrapods. The conserved binding sites, in addition to recent immunological results obtained in other research groups, provide further evidence for the existence of the GABA/BZR as an isoreceptor complex.", 
    "69": "The benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor is coupled with a GABA-receptor chloride-ionophore complex. The BZs augment the GABA-induced increase in chloride conductance, which leads to postsynaptic inhibition. This effect is believed to be responsible for antianxiety, sedative, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant effects, but the mechanisms underlying these behavioral effects are poorly understood. Various other sedative-hypnotics, including ethanol and barbiturates, interact with this system, probably contributing to their behavioral effects. We have recently conducted a selective breeding program to develop lines of mice which are diazepam-resistant (DR) and sensitive (DS) (Gallaher EJ, Hollister LE, Gionet SE, Crabbe JC. Psychopharmacology, 93:25-30, 1987); when tested for the duration of rotarod impairment after 20 mg/kg diazepam the DR line was impaired for 71 +/- 13 min compared with 200 +/- 18 min in the DS line. In the current study we tested mice from the DR and DS lines to determine if BZ sensitivity generalized to ethanol. DS mice became ataxic with lower brain ethanol concentrations, and recovered at later times and with lower blood ethanol concentrations, than did DR mice, indicating that sensitivity differences did extend to ethanol. Following a series of sequential doses over 5 to 6 hr DS mice developed minimal rapid tolerance, whereas DR mice developed considerable tolerance. By the end of the day DS mice were therefore much more sensitive to ethanol than were DR mice; this difference was greater in males than in females. High dose ethanol toxicity was studied by assaying brain ethanol concentrations at the cessation of respiration; no differences were found between lines or sexes.", 
    "70": "Caerulein, gastrin, and C-terminal fragments of cholecystokinin (CCK) varying in length from eight (CCK-8) to four (CCK-4) amino acids stimulate pepsinogen secretion from dispersed chief cells prepared from guinea pig stomach. C-terminal fragments of CCK containing fewer than four amino acids, even when tested at concentrations as high as 3 mM, do not stimulate pepsinogen secretion. The efficacies of gastrin and the various CCK-related peptides, coupled with the pattern of action of CCK receptor antagonists, indicate that chief cells from guinea pig stomach possess two functionally distinct classes of receptors, C-receptors and G-receptors. The C-receptors can be occupied by caerulein, CCK-8, CCK-7, des(SO3)CCK-8, or des(SO3)CCK-7, and occupation of C-receptors causes full stimulation of pepsinogen secretion. G-receptors can be occupied by gastrin I, gastrin II, CCK-6, CCK-5, or CCK-4, and occupation of G-receptors causes stimulation of pepsinogen secretion that is 60% of maximal."
