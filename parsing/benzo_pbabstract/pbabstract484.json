    "0": "In a survey of the pertinent literature the pharmacological and toxicodynamic, effects, metabolism and mechanism of action of diazepam in experimental animals and humans are discussed. Particular attention is paid to the effects of diazepam given during the developmental age on the development and function of the central nervous system in mammals.", 
    "1": "The coupling of muscarinic receptors to G-proteins in various regions of the rat brain was assessed by measuring carbachol-stimulated, low-Km GTPase. The inhibition of carbachol-stimulated GTPase by the M1-selective antagonist pirenzepine was compared to the affinity of pirenzepine for various nuclei within the regions as measured autoradiographically. The rank order of potency of carbachol for stimulating GTPase in various brain regions was similar to that for binding to receptors in those areas. The maximal specific activity (efficacy) of carbachol-stimulated GTPase varied independently of the distribution of total receptors or receptor subtypes. The overall potency of pirenzepine for inhibiting carbachol-stimulated GTPase was not correlated with the overall affinity of pirenzepine for muscarinic receptors in the regions. Comparing results in various brain regions, the data suggest that there are differences in the efficiency of coupling between muscarinic receptors and G-proteins. For example, the pons-medulla appeared to have a small population of pirenzepine-sensitive (M1 or M4) receptors that were coupled very efficiently to G-proteins, whereas in the hippocampus all muscarinic receptors, most of which are pirenzepine-sensitive, appeared to be weakly coupled to G-proteins. It is suggested that variable interactions between receptors and G-proteins may be an important factor in the overall coupling between receptor occupancy and cellular responses to acetylcholine as well as other hormones and transmitters.", 
    "2": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome associated with acute or chronic liver disease. It is generally considered a metabolic and potentially reversible syndrome. An important component of HE is increased neuro-inhibition caused by reduced hepatic metabolism of gut-derived nitrogenous substances and by activation of the postsynaptic GABAA-receptor complex in the central nervous system. Effective conventional therapy of HE includes prevention of precipitating factors, restriction of dietary protein an administration of lactulose (or lactitol) and possibly also of antibiotics. In addition, animal studies and uncontrolled clinical studies indicate that the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil effectively diminishes the increased neuroinhibition in certain patients with HE. However, these favourable flumazenil effects must be confirmed in larger randomized and placebo-controlled multicenter studies before flumazenil can be regarded as a useful new addition to current management of patients with acute or chronic hepatic encephalopathy.", 
    "3": "Pretreatment with Ro 5-4864 enhanced the bronchoconstrictor responses to histamine or carbachol in the anaesthetized artificially ventilated guinea pig. This suggests the involvement of a peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor as also indicated by the lack of effect of clonazepam. PK 11195 did not antagonize the Ro 5-4864-induced enhancement, but itself enhanced the bronchoconstrictor responses to histamine or carbachol. The data indicate that Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195 behave as metactoid sensitizers of histamine or carbachol.", 
    "4": "Selective muscarinic antagonists were used in an attempt to characterize the muscarinic autoreceptor modulating the release of acetylcholine in the striatum of the rat. In vivo microdialysis was applied to infuse atropine, 4-DAMP (4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine), pirenzepine or AF-DX 116 (11-[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one), leading to a dose-dependent increase in the overflow of acetylcholine, the order of potency being: atropine greater than 4-DAMP greater than pirenzepine greater than AF-DX 116. We conclude from these data that the muscarinic receptor modulating release in the striatum is of the M3 type.", 
    "5": "The present study served to investigate the ability of seven selective muscarinic antagonists to inhibit carbachol-induced drinking in the rat. The muscarinic antagonists were given by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection 1 min before the i.c.v. injection of carbachol (1 microgram/rat). The M2 antagonist, methoctramine, was inactive up to 80.3 nmol/rat. The M3 antagonist, p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol, elicited a modest (42%) but statistically significant inhibition of drinking only at 80 nmol/rat. On the other hand, the selective M1 antagonists, (R)-trihexphenidyl, o-methoxy-sila-hexocyclium and pirenzepine, produced a marked and dose-dependent inhibition of carbachol-induced drinking, their ID50 values being 0.51, 7.36 and 9.31 nmol/rat. Also the M1/M3 antagonists, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide and hexahydro-sila-difenidol, were potent inhibitors of carbachol-induced drinking, their ID50 values (0.28 and 11.09 nmol/rat) being related to their pA2 values for M1 receptors in rabbit vas deferens. These data suggest that carbachol-induced drinking may be mediated by activation of muscarinic M1 receptors.", 
    "6": "The guinea-pig oesophageal muscularis mucosae was used to determine the affinity for muscarinic receptors of two new tricyclic compounds, DF 545 and DF 594, which are structurally related to pirenzepine. Both acetylcholine and bethanechol induced a concentration-dependent contraction of the muscularis mucosae. This contraction was competitively antagonized by DF 545 and DF 594 over the dose range 10(-7)-10(-5) M, while at higher concentrations both antagonists caused a depression of the maximal response to the cholinomimetics. The potency of DF 545 and DF 594 appeared to be comparable to that of pirenzepine and approximately 50 times lower than that of atropine. By comparing the affinities of DF 545 and DF 594 with those of selective antagonists (methoctramine and 4-DAMP) which discriminate between M2/M3 muscarinic receptor subtypes, it emerged that pirenzepine as well as DF 545 and DF 594 might act on M3 receptors, which seem to be predominant in the guinea-pig oesophageal muscularis mucosae. McN-A-343 exhibited no agonist activity while it acted as a competitive antagonist against acetylcholine and bethanechol. None of the compounds exhibited calcium antagonist properties. DF 545 inhibited the contractile responses to histamine, but DF 594 and pirenzepine did not.", 
    "7": "While various aspects of suicide have been studied, there are few studies of particular modes of treatment. A unique opportunity to investigate electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) arose in two rural areas in Ireland. In one town, ECT is not used and there were no reports of suicide. In contrast, in an neighboring area where ECT is used, 30 cases of suicide were recorded from 1980 to 1989. These 30 cases of suicide and the influence of ECT and benzodiazepines are the subject of this study. We concluded that the rationale behind maintenance benzodiazepines in suicidal patients is questionable and that the efficacy of ECT in the prevention of suicide is doubtful.", 
    "8": "The effect of beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and other functionally related amino acids on [3H]flunitrazepam binding to rat spinal cord homogenates was studied. beta-Alanine potentiated [3H]flunitrazepam binding by 40% and GABA by 88%. Taurine increased the binding by 19%. Hypotaurine produced an 11% increase. No significant effect was seen in glycine, alanine, serine, valine or the dipeptide carnosine. The beta-alanine increase in [3H]flunitrazepam binding was completely inhibited by 10 microM strychnine, whereas the GABA increase required 0.1 mM strychnine to be fully suppressed. Results suggest that beta-alanine specifically potentiates binding of [3H]flunitrazepam in rat spinal cord homogenates.", 
    "9": "Binding of [3H]flunitrazepam was studied in brain tissues of isolated Wistar rats and compared to group-reared animals. Modifications were observed in hippocampus and cortex (Kd increased) and in cerebellum (Bmax decreased) and when brain sections of control rats were incubated in the bath fluid that had served to incubate sections from isolated rats, a flattening of the saturation curve was observed. Results are discussed in terms of possible modulators of benzodiazepine binding sites, mainly tissue GABA concentrations.", 
    "10": "Acute chloroquine poisoning is life threatening with risk of death from apnoea and cardiac arrhythmia within a few hours of ingestion. Mechanical ventilation, infusion of pressor agents and large doses of diazepam seem to provide effective treatment. This treatment was introduced by Riou et alii (N Engl J Med 1988; 318; 1-6), and we used it successfully in a case of severe chloroquine poisoning. Intensive treatment was given during the first two days of intoxication, when the whole blood chloroquine phosphate concentration was high (more than 10 mumol/kg), corresponding to absorption from the gut and distribution to the organs. Hereafter the whole blood chloroquine phosphate concentration decreased increasingly slowly, probably due to equilibrium with tissue stores.", 
    "11": "Abstract An association of octadecaneuropeptide, an endogenous ligand at the benzodiazepine receptor, with the peripheral type benzodiazepine receptor has been reported in brain as well as a few peripheral tissues. In order to verify whether or not such an association occurs in the rat pituitary gland, we have proceeded to the immunocytochemical localization of octadecaneuropeptide as well as the autoradiographic localization of peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors in rat pituitary, octadecaneuropeptide immunoreactive material was found in high concentrations in the posterior lobe, whereas only a very few cells were labelled in the intermediate lobe. The anterior lobe did not show any specific staining. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that in the posterior lobe labelling was restricted to pituicytes. Autoradiographic studies demonstrated a strong and uniform labelling in the posterior lobe after incubation with [(3)H] PK11195, a ligand selective for peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors. In the intermediate lobe, the autoradiographic reaction was restricted to a narrow band adjacent to the hypophysial cleft. No labelling was detected in the anterior lobe. These results demonstrate a close association between octadecaneuropeptide and peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors in the intermediate and posterior lobes of the rat pituitary gland.", 
    "12": "As an alternative to naturally occurring pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines (e.g., antramycin) which possess properties of DNA alkylation, we have designed several antileukemic chromeno[4,3-b][1,5]benzodiazepine derivatives with potential activity toward leukemia cell membranes and the cyclic nucleotide system. The cis and trans diastereoisomers were characterized by NMR. The absolute configurations of the enantiomers were established by X-ray diffraction and circular dichroism (CD) measurements. By means of absorption spectroscopy and determinations of fluorescence and fluorescence decay, it was found that the cancerostatically active compound (+)(6aR, 13aS)-3,4-dimethoxy-10,11-dimethyl-6,6a,7,8,13, 13a-hexahydrochromeno[4,3-b][1,5]benzodiazepine (ZIMET 54/79) and its biologically inactive (-) enantiomer (ZIMET 55/79) interact with liposomal membranes. At pH values of 6.0 and 7.3 the long-wave absorption bands of these agents showed weak bathochromic and hypochromic effects upon addition of neutral, and positively and negatively charged phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol liposomes. Such spectral changes are interpreted as resulting from the binding of both agents to phospholipid bilayers. Steady-state determinations using the membrane probe 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid (1,8-ANS) led to the observation of a small decrease in fluorescence intensity in the presence of either agent. Time-resolved measurements demonstrate that the mechanism of action of the agents occurs mainly through the partial displacement of probe molecules from regions of hydrophobic binding to areas of greater solvent accessibility. No significant differences in binding between the cancerostatically active and inactive enantiomers with liposomes (archiral systems) were detectable on the basis of spectrophotometric and fluorescence determinations. Cell membrane bound adenylate cyclase is stimulated by ZIMET 54/79, resulting in an increase of 103% in the level of cAMP in mouse L1210 leukemia cells. On examination of structure-activity relationships, it was found that the biological activity (leukemia L1210, P388, Lewis lung carcinoma, melanoma B16, increase in cAMP) is correlated with the particular configuration (6aR,13aS) and type of substituent at positions 3 and 4 of the benzo ring in the case of alkoxy groups and positions 10 and 11 for methyl groups. No activity was detected toward DNA/RNA using microbial test systems.", 
    "13": "Zopiclone is a new hypnotic cyclopyrrolone with a short elimination half-life (5.3 h). The pharmacokinetic profile of this drug was studied in 7 chronic renal failure (CRF) patients given 7.5 mg nocte for 7 consecutive nights. The pharmacokinetic values obtained were compared with the corresponding values found in healthy young volunteers given the same repeated dosage regimen. C max and T max were not significantly different between the two groups but the C min of unchanged zopiclone (at 24 h) post-dosing was significantly (p less than 0.001) higher in CRF patients (8.16 +/- 5.34 ng/ml) than in healthy volunteers (1.90 +/- 0.82 ng/ml). The AUC values in CRF patients were also significantly increased during the seventh day (742 +/- 212 h ng/ml) compared to healthy subjects (408 +/- 66.5 h ng/ml) and the elimination half-life of zopiclone was also longer in CRF patients (about 8 h) than in the reference group (about 5 h). Nevertheless, the accumulation ratios remained similar in the two groups (1.09 +/- 0.18 in CRF patients and 1.02 +/- 0.2 in healthy subjects). Thus no evident accumulation of zopiclone appeared in the CRF patients. As in the healthy subjects, no metabolites were detected in the plasma of the CRF patients although at steady state the urinary excretion of zopiclone and its N-oxide and N-desmethyl derivatives (2.03% +/- 1.52% and 1.99 +/- 0.65% of the dose, respectively) was significantly decreased compared to healthy subjects (3.7% +/- 2.1% and 32.6% +/- 4.5%, respectively). Zopiclone thus represents a safe alternative to benzodiazepine hypnotic therapy in patients with renal impairment.", 
    "14": "All records from the Danish Medicolegal Council concerning drivers suspected for drug influences were examined for the 5 year period 1981-1985. 461 records were included, 62 women and 399 men. In 250 cases drugs from more than one of ten groups had been taken thus making 786 combinations of drug/driving. The major drug group was benzodiazepines, accounting for 65% of all drug intake. Opioids also contributed substantially, found in 38% of the cases. A traffic accident had occurred in 180 (39%) of the records. Drivers who had been taking antidepressives were involved in an accident in 67%, significantly above the mean. For benzodiazepines, the corresponding percentage was 43%, while for opioids it was only 23%, significantly below the mean. This striking difference has been demonstrated in most of the studies concerning drugs in traffic. It may support the hypothesis that opioids do not necessarily make driving dangerous, as do antidepressives, barbiturates and especially benzodiazepines.", 
    "15": "Detailed human case data is presented to illustrate the dramatic extent of the phenomenon of post-mortem drug redistribution. The data suggests that there is a post-mortem diffusion of drugs along a concentration gradient, from sites of high concentration in solid organs, into the blood with resultant artefactual elevation of drug levels in blood. Highest drug levels were found in central vessels such as pulmonary artery and vein, and lowest levels were found in peripheral vessels such as subclavian and femoral veins. In individual cases, in multiple blood samples obtained from ligated vessels, concentrations of doxepin and desmethyldoxepin ranged from 3.6 to 12.5 mg/l and 1.2 to 7.5 mg/l, respectively; amobartital, secobarbital and pentobarbital from 4.3 to 25.8 mg/l, 3.9 to 25.3 mg/l and 5.1 to 31.5 mg/l respectively; clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine from 4.0 to 21.5 mg/l and 1.7 to 8.1 mg/l, respectively and flurazepam 0.15 to 0.99 mg/l; imipramine and desipramine from 4.1 to 18.1 mg/l and 1.0 to 3.6 mg/l, respectively. We conclude that this poorly studied phenomenon creates major difficulties in interpretation and undermines the reference value of data bases where the site of origin of post-mortem blood samples is unknown.", 
    "16": "A case is presented of a 35-year-old black African male anesthesiology resident, found dead in his apartment. At the scene a syringe, butterfly intravenous line and a bottle of Versed (Midazolam) were recovered. A comprehensive screen for common drugs of abuse and therapeutic agents failed to detect any drugs in blood and urine. The blood ethanol concentration was 0.06 g/dl. A GC/MS SIM assay for midazolam was developed. A sub-therapeutic midazolam blood concentration of 7.5 ng/ml was detected and concentrations (ng/ml or ng/g) in bile, urine, and liver were 3.3, 7.5, and 96, respectively. The syringe fluid was then analyzed and found to contain only fentanyl, midazolam was absent. The blood fentanyl concentration was 4.9 ng/ml which is consistent with those reported in fentanyl fatalities. Fentanyl concentrations (ng/ml or ng/g) in bile, urine, and liver were 8.8, 5.0, and 5.9, respectively. The cause of death was ruled to be fentanyl intoxication and the manner of death undetermined.", 
    "17": "1. The effect of cholecystokinin sulphated octapeptide (CCK8S) on endogenous dopamine release was examined in rat striatal and nucleus accumbens slices, by high performance liquid chromatography (h.p.l.c.) with electrochemical detection. 2. CCK8S was shown to increase dopamine release from slices of nucleus accumbens but not striatum in a dose-dependent manner between 0.1 and 10 microM. 3. Pentagastrin was without effect on dopamine release at doses up to 10 microM. 4. The dopamine release produced in the presence of CCK8S was abolished by preincubation of the slice with 1.0 or 10.0 nM L-364,718 (the CCKA-selective antagonist) while 1 microM L-365,260 (the CCKB-selective antagonist) had no action. 5. These results suggest that the CCK8S-evoked release of dopamine from the nucleus accumbens is mediated by a CCKA-receptor.", 
    "18": "Fifty-one patients who met DSM-III criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, and who were recruited to participate in a drug outcome study, filled out a variety of rating scales and had blood samples drawn for plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine, and free 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) after a 20-min rest period. This group was compared to 15 normal controls who also had their blood drawn after a 20-min rest period. While the two groups were initially found to have significantly different levels of plasma free MHPG through the use of t tests, this finding was not confirmed by subsequent discriminant analysis.", 
    "19": "Localizing the ear responsible for vertigo attacks may be exceedingly difficult in patients with delayed endolymphatic hydrops, vestibular M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease or bilateral M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. This has important clinical implications when planning operative treatment. We present a case of delayed endolymphatic hydrops to exemplify these difficulties and demonstrate the localizing value of recovery nystagmus. We stress the importance when possible of monitoring patients with endolymphatic hydrops for recovery nystagmus during acute vertigo attacks. Monitoring should include direct eye observation as pure rotatory nystagmus escapes detection on electronystagmography.", 
    "20": "This investigation compares the time course changes in the central nervous system (CNS) impairment effects on psychomotor and cognitive skills and relates these changes to the plasma lorazepam concentrations in a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model. Six male subjects received a single oral dose of lorazepam or placebo. The CNS effects were measured by using computerized continuous tracking (TRKN), body sway with eyes open (SWAY OPEN), and digit symbol substitution (DSS) tests. Plasma lorazepam concentrations were best characterized by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption. Plotting the plasma lorazepam concentration and measured effect across time revealed a counterclockwise hysteresis loop. Fitting the time course of the effects in an integrated PK-PD model required an effect compartment with the equilibrium rate constant between it and the plasma compartment. The magnitude of the temporal lag was quantified by the half-time of equilibration between concentration in the hypothetical effect compartment and the plasma lorazepam level (t1/2keo). The CNS effect measured by TRKN was characterized by a mean estimate of maximum predicted effect (Emax) of 418 with a t1/2keo of 0.43 hr, an estimate of effect site drug level to produce 50% of Emax (EC50) of 35.8 ng/ml and a power parameter (gamma) of 6.29. Corresponding parameter mean estimates for SWAY OPEN and DSS as measures of drug CNS effect were quite similar.", 
    "21": "Factors that determine the impact of diazepam on the hypoalgesia produced by electric shocks were investigated. Tailshocks (1, 5, & 20) were followed by an initial hypoalgesia, lasting 2-4 min, that was unaffected by prior administration of diazepam. This hypoalgesic reaction was followed by a second hypoalgesia if subjects were allowed to remain in the shock environment during testing, and this reaction was reduced or eliminated by prior diazepam. If subjects were removed from the shock situation, this second reaction did not occur. In contrast, 80 shocks were followed by a single hypoalgesia that was sensitive to blockade by diazepam throughout its entire course and was not affected by removing subjects from the shock environment. These results have implications for the perceptual-defensive-recuperative, working memory, and unconditioned response-learned helplessness interpretations of shock-produced analgesia.", 
    "22": "The effects of lithium chloride and other antimanic drugs on locomotor hyperactivity induced by a mixture of methamphetamine (MAMP) and chlordiazepoxide (CDZP) were examined in mice, using an Animex activity meter. CDZP (12.5 mg/kg) given SC in combination with MAMP (1 mg/kg) caused a marked increase in locomotor activity, as compared with that in mice treated with MAMP alone. However, when CDZP (12.5 mg/kg) was administered together with 0.5 or 2.0 mg/kg of MAMP, no significant enhancement was observed. Lithium (2 and 3 mEq/kg, IP) and carbamazepine (4 and 8 mg/kg, IP) inhibited the hyperactivity induced by the MAMP (1 mg/kg)-CDZP (12.5 mg/kg) mixture to the level of activity in animals treated with MAMP (1 mg/kg) alone. Lithium and carbamazepine alone at these doses caused no significant inhibition of locomotor activity in saline- or MAMP-treated mice. Haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg, IP) and chlorpromazine (0.5 mg/kg, IP) decreased the MAMP-CDZP mixture-induced hyperactivity without significantly inhibiting locomotor activity in the saline- or MAMP-treated group. However, haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg) and chlorpromazine (1 mg/kg) alone significantly inhibited locomotor activity in all of the saline-, MAMP- and MAMP-CDZP mixture-treated groups. These results indicate that antimanic drugs selectively inhibit the hyperactivity induced by the MAMP-CDZP mixture, but that neuroleptics are less selective in inhibiting the hyperactivity.", 
    "23": "Ro 15-4513 is an imidazobenzodiazepine that has been reported to block a range of behavioral effects of ethanol. In the present experiments, the effects of Ro 15-4513 were assessed on the acquisition of an ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion. Specifically, rats were given a novel saccharin solution to drink followed by an injection of one of a range of doses of Ro 15-4513 (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg, Experiment 1A, and 2.0 and 3.0 mg/kg, Experiment 1B) and an injection of ethanol (1.75 g/kg). Ro 15-4513 failed to block the acquisition of the ethanol-induced taste aversion. Possible reasons for this failure were discussed.", 
    "24": "In a straight alley containing a cat odor stimulus rats show high rates of risk assessment, including flat back approach and stretch attend behaviors oriented toward the threat stimulus and contact with the stimulus. In this situation, diazepam (2.0 and 4.0 mg/kg) significantly reduced risk assessment measures (flat back approach + stretch attend), while not reliably altering control locomotion (curved back). In combination with earlier findings that the same doses of diazepam reliably increased risk assessment from a movement arrest baseline, these results strongly support a behavioral model of anxiety involving predictable nonmonotonic changes in risk assessment as a function of anxiety reduction. In comparison to diazepam, ethanol had less pronounced effects on the Cat Odor Test, as in earlier tasks of reactivity to potential threat. However, reliable dose x time interactions for risk assessment measures suggest ethanol effects similar to those of diazepam but most pronounced in initial stages in the test session.", 
    "25": "The aim of the study was to monitor discontinuation of benzodiazepine prescribing among patients who were either first-time or long-term users. The study was carried out as a one-year follow-up study in general practice in the County of Arhus, Denmark. In all, 201 patients with first-time prescriptions and 607 patients with long-term prescriptions participated, and in the one-year follow-up period 55% and 12%, respectively, stopped having further prescriptions of benzodiazepines or other psychotropic drugs. Older first-time users continued significantly more often than younger. In an age and sex-stratified analysis, users of benzodiazepine hypnotics/sedatives continued significantly more often than users of benzodizepine tranquillizers among first-time users (odds ratio (OR) 2.15) as well as long-term users (OR: 2.16). Continuation of long-term use was significantly correlated with the female sex (OR: 1.71), living alone (OR: 1.97), daily use (OR: 4.17), high amounts of defined daily doses (DDD) per prescription, and a high ratio between prescribed daily dose and DDD.", 
    "26": "This study evaluated the potentiation by glycine of anticonvulsant drugs in maximal electroshock seizures in rats. Administered alone, glycine (40 mmol/kg, p.o.) induced no anticonvulsant effect or neurotoxicity. Administered together with the anticonvulsants, glycine significantly enhanced the anticonvulsant potency of phenobarbital and carbamazepine. Glycine also potentiated the anticonvulsant actions of MK-801 and diazepam but did not improve the selectivity of the drugs, as effective doses were still associated with neurotoxicity. Glycine did not potentiate phenytoin or sodium divalproate. Administration together with glycine had no significant effect on the concentrations of phenobarbital or carbamazepine in the brain. Administration together with phenobarbital had no relevant effect on the concentration of glycine in the brain but administration of glycine and carbamazepine together resulted in an increased concentration of glycine in the hippocampus and brainstem. These findings indicate a possible glycine-sensitive component in the mechanism of action of phenobarbital, carbamazepine and diazepam in maximal electroshock seizures. Although the mechanism may not be mediated by a glycine-GABA interaction, the evidence does implicate a possible interaction between glycine and anticonvulsant drugs at NMDA receptors.", 
    "27": "Twenty-five patients with a primary DSM-III-R diagnosis of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia were treated openly with the serotonin uptake inhibitor fluoxetine for up to 12 months. For most patients, treatment was initiated at 5 mg/day to minimize adverse effects previously reported with initiation at higher doses. Nineteen (76%) experienced moderate to marked improvement in panic attacks. Four (16%) were unable to tolerate fluoxetine due to adverse effects. Initiating treatment of panic disorder with low doses of fluoxetine may increase its acceptability and permit more patients to benefit from fluoxetine.", 
    "28": "Cholecystokinin is a peptide produced by neuroendocrine cells in gut and neurons in brain and gut. Proliferating human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (H-PBMC) also make small amounts of cholecystokinin. Cholecystokinin increases intracellular calcium (Ca2+) in H-PBMC. This can be blocked with L 364, 718, a non-toxic specific cholecystokinin antagonist. Cholecystokinin is a comitogen for H-PBMC and activates H-PBMC in a cyclosporine-resistant fashion. If cholecystokinin is a critical lymphokine, then L 364, 718 should block H-PBMC mitogenesis. H-PBMC from healthy donors were stimulated in vitro with either phytohemagglutinin or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody. L 364, 718 was not toxic for H-PBMC, yet inhibited mitogenesis at 10(-7), 10(-6), and 10(-5) M. The small amount of cholecystokinin made by H-PBMC may play a critical role in H-PBMC mitogenesis.", 
    "29": "The relation between the shuttlebox escape deficit produced by prior inescapable shock (IS) and fear during shuttlebox testing as assessed by freezing was investigated in rats. IS rats learned to escape poorly and were more fearful than either escapably shocked subjects or controls, both before and after receiving shock in the shuttlebox. However, fear and poor escape performance did not covary with the manipulation of variables designed to modulate the amount of fear and the occurrence of the escape deficit. A 72-hr interval between IS and testing eliminated the escape deficit but did not reduce preshock freezing. Diazepam before testing reduced both preshock and postshock fear in the shuttlebox but had no effect on the escape deficit. Naltrexone had no effect on fear but eliminated the escape deficit. This independence of outcomes suggests that the shuttlebox escape deficit is not caused by high levels of fear in IS subjects.", 
    "30": "Metoclopramide was given i.m. or i.v. to patients who had been given an opioid premedication, and the effects on gastric emptying assessed. Forty patients were allocated randomly to one of four treatment groups: group 1, oral diazepam 10 mg; group 2, i.m. morphine 10 mg; group 3, i.m. morphine 10 mg and i.v. metoclopramide 10 mg; group 4, i.m. morphine 10 mg and i.m. metoclopramide 10 mg. Gastric emptying was estimated from the absorption of oral paracetamol. I.v. metoclopramide antagonized the reduction in paracetamol absorption caused by morphine, whereas i.m. metoclopramide did not. This finding may be of importance in anaesthesia for emergencies.", 
    "31": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF-acether) has been shown to be produced by the kidney and to sharply reduce glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF). Thus, PAF-acether could be a possible mediator of the reduction of GFR and RPF in ischemic-induced acute renal failure (ARF). We have assayed the effect of inhibiting the interaction of PAF-acether with its receptor using two specific PAF-acether antagonists, BN-52021 and alprazolam, on the evolution of the GFR and RPF, in the experimental model of ARF induced in rats by clamping the left artery for 60 min. In addition, we have measured arteriovenous differences in PAF-acether concentration, as well as PAF-acether content in glomeruli from rats with ARF pretreated or not with BN-52021. In metabolic cage studies, plasma creatinine increased more in the untreated than in the BN-52021-treated group, whereas creatinine clearance was higher in treated than in untreated rats. In acute clearance experiments, after renal artery clamping, untreated rats showed a marked oliguria and reduction of the inulin clearance (greater than 99%), which showed no recovery 90 min after clamp release, whereas GFR reached values above 0.1 ml/min in the rats treated with BN-52021 or alprazolam, with clearly significant statistical differences. Results of p-aminohippurate clearance were similar to those of GFR. Glomeruli from rats with ARF had greater amounts of PAF-acether than glomeruli from normal rats, whereas glomeruli from BN-52021-treated rats with ARF produced intermediate amounts. These results provide evidence for a role for PAF-acether in the genesis of this model of experimental ARF.", 
    "32": "The interaction of amitriptyline, doxepin, imipramine and their N-methyl quaternary derivatives with muscarinic receptors was investigated in the brain and heart. The potency of the tricyclic derivatives for inhibiting the binding of 11[[2-[(diethylamino) methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b] [1,4] benzodiazepine-6-one to M2 muscarinic receptors in cerebral cortex was similar to that measured in competitive binding experiments with the nonselective muscarinic antagonist [3H]N-methylscopolamine in the corpus striatum and heart. Moreover, the tricyclic derivatives antagonized muscarinic receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity with similar potency in the corpus striatum and heart, and there was good agreement between the affinities of the tricyclic derivatives when measured by radioligand binding and by antagonism of the adenylate cyclase response. Our results show that amitriptyline, doxepin and imipramine lack selectivity for subtypes of the muscarinic receptor.", 
    "33": "In vitro autoradiography was performed in order to visualize cholecystokinin-A (CCK-A) receptors in sections of Cynomolgus monkey brain. CCK-A receptors were defined as those which displayed high affinity for the selective non-peptide antagonist MK-329 (L-364,718) and were detected in several regions by selective inhibition of 125I-Bolton Hunter CCK using MK-329 or direct labeling with 3H-MK-329. In the caudal medulla, high densities of CCK-A sites were present in the nucleus tractus solitarius, especially the caudal and medial aspects, and also the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. CCK-A sites were localized to a number of hypothalamic nuclei such as the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, the dorsomedial and infundibular nuclei as well as the neurohypophysis. The mammillary bodies and supramammillary nuclei also contained CCK-A receptor sites. High concentrations of CCK-A receptors were present in the substantia nigra zona compacta and also the ventral tegmental area and may be associated with dopamine cell bodies. Binding of 3H-MK-329 was also detected in parts of the caudate nucleus and ventral putamen. The detection, by autoradiographical means, of CCK-A receptors throughout the Cynomolgus monkey brain contrasts with similar studies performed using rodents and suggests differences in the density and, perhaps, the importance of CCK-A receptors in the primate as opposed to the rodent. The data suggest the possibility that CCK-A receptors may be involved in a number of important brain functions as diverse as the processing of sensory information from the gut, the regulation of hormone secretion, and the activity of dopamine cell activity.", 
    "34": "The pharmacokinetics of the bispyridinium oxime HI-6 (CAS reg. no. 34433-31-3; 1-(((4-aminocarbonyl)pyridinio)methoxy)methyl)-2-[hydroxy i mino)methyl)- pyridinium dichloride) was investigated in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). The effects of methoxyflurane anesthesia, administration of atropine with and without diazepam were determined on the serum half-life (t1/2), clearance rate (CL), and the volume of distribution (Vd) following intramuscular (IM) administration of HI-6 (30 mg kg-1). The control t1/2, CL and Vd of HI-offere 27 min, 8.6 ml min-1 kg-1 and 0.34 l kg-1, respectively. These parameters were unaffected by the co-administration of either atropine (0.5 mg kg-1, IM) or atropine and diazepam (0.5 mg kg-1, IM + 0.2 mg kg-1 IV, respectively). Methoxyflurane anesthesia resulted in a significant increase in the HI-6 t1/2 to 61 min concomitant with a decrease in the CL to 4.1 ml min-1 kg-1 with no change in the Vd. The increase in the t1/2 of HI-6 in methoxyflurane anesthetized monkeys is probably the result of a decrease in the clearance rate and, thus, excretion of HI-6 by the kidneys.", 
    "35": "Fluoxetine (PROZAC) is a recently marketed straight chain antidepressant unrelated to the cyclic anti-depressants. There is only limited information on fluoxetine and a single case report on overdose (benign outcome) in the literature. In response to this we performed a 1y retrospective chart review at 2 AAPCC certified poison centers. Forty-four exposures to fluoxetine were reviewed from 1988; 31 cases were treated in a HCF, 2 cases were followed at home by phone and 11 cases were lost to follow up. Thirteen cases with follow up (FU) reported no coingestants; 3 cases reported increased anxiety without cardiovascular (CV) changes, 2 cases presented confused with out CV changes, and 8 cases were asymptomatic. Eight cases with FU had ETOH and/or benzodiazepines as a coingestant and experienced only a decreased level of consciousness that could be explained by the coingestant. Five cases remained asymptomatic with reported coingestants of APAP #3, lorazepam, haloperidol, molindone, alprazolam, propranolol, phenobarbital (level 18.2). Four cases were excluded from the evaluation due to the coingestants involved. No seizures were recorded in this series. Three possible drug reactions occurred; 2 cases had reactions with tranylcypromine (PARNATE), and 1 case with a diagnosis of septicemia had a severe hyperthermic reaction with therapeutic coingestants of mephytoin, verapamil, digoxin and indocin. We believe overdose with fluoxetine present minimal risk of serious cardiovascular or neurological complications.", 
    "36": "This study compares the quality of anesthesia achieved with low-dose ketamine with that of methohexital sodium. In a double-blind study of 40 healthy adult patients undergoing a variety of minor oral surgical procedures, the anesthetic techniques were assessed with respect to the following parameters: patients' subjective evaluation of the anesthesia, the level of response to injection of local anesthetic, psychomotor ability after surgery, recovery times, and the frequency of adverse effects. From these observations, it was deduced that when low-dose ketamine was used with diazepam, meperidine, and nitrous oxide, it proved to be a safe and effective supplement for minimizing pain, discomfort, and anxiety before injection of local anesthetic. Patients' appreciation of the level of anesthetic achieved, psychomotor ability, adverse reactions, and recovery time was not significantly different from the methohexital sodium group.", 
    "37": "Little has been published about outpatient sedation for pediatric patients. We designed a study to evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of diazepam and meperidine in combination for sedation in ambulatory pediatric patients undergoing endoscopy, colonoscopy, or liver biopsy. Thirty patients (7 months-20 years) were observed. Each patient received a single combined dose of intravenous diazepam and meperidine. The standard dose was 0.1 mg/kg for diazepam and 2.0 mg/kg for meperidine. In patients weighing greater than 100 lb, set doses of meperidine (100 mg) and diazepam (5 mg) were used. The time to achieve sedation and the vital signs were measured; cooperation, emotional state, and drowsiness were rated before, during, and after procedures. The amnesic effect was noted, as were any adverse effects. Diazepam and meperidine were effective in 26 of 30 patients, with sedation generally produced within 2-3 min. Cooperation and emotional state improved significantly following drug administration (p less than 0.05). When a prospective 24-h telephone follow-up study was instituted in 40 consecutive patients receiving diazepam and meperidine no significant adverse effects were noted. Only 20% of patients old enough to be questioned remembered the procedure. Diazepam and meperidine in combination appear to be effective and safe in pediatric patients undergoing gastrointestinal procedures. Prolonged monitoring of patients does not appear necessary in this patient population.", 
    "38": "Diazepam and midazolam are considered safe and effective sedative agents for diagnostic procedures. However, there have been recent reports of deaths in older patients receiving midazolam for sedation. We examined the relative potency of diazepam compared with midazolam as a function of age in two large groups of patients receiving intravenous benzodiazepines for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. While midazolam and diazepam are approximately equivalent before age 60, after age 60 the relative potency of midazolam compared with diazepam increases markedly. The rapid decline in dose necessary to sedate older patients with midazolam may explain deaths occurring in older patients who have received this drug. Until this problem receives definitive study, we advise that diazepam be preferred over midazolam for intravenous sedation in patients over 60.", 
    "39": "Asthmatic patients from western Canada and the United States have reported that after visits to an asthma clinic in Mexicali, Mexico, they return home substantially improved or cured having received \"a bronchodilator medication unavailable in the United States or Canada because of the big drug companies.\" Analysis of these medications reveals that the most commonly prescribed combination is the glucocorticoid triamcinolone (unscored white tablets) and the antihistamine chlorpheniramine (coated biconvex orange or red tablets). Occasionally benzodiazepines are added to these medications. The patients are assured that the medications which they have been given are free of side effects and specifically, that corticosteroids are not used. Such therapy is dangerous to the patient who not only is unaware of the medications that he or she is taking, but is unlikely to mention this therapy to his or her physician. These patients risk drug interactions, medication side effects, and the possibility of adrenal failure either with a stress to their system or on withdrawal of drug treatment. Patients are also at risk of abandoning safer forms of asthma therapy for the miracle cure. We, too, are partially responsible for these unethical practices by avoiding the use of steroids and undertreating our patients at times, leaving them unnecessarily restricted and eager for any form of relief.", 
    "40": "Anecdotal and uncontrolled studies have suggested that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs produce false-positive results in immunoassay urine tests for some drugs of abuse. This study was performed in 60 volunteers who took ibuprofen as either a single 400-mg dose, or 200 mg three times a day, or 400 mg three times a day, and in 42 patients taking ibuprofen, naproxyn, or fenoprofen in therapeutic regimens for more than 30 days. Of the 510 urines collected from 102 individuals during these dosage regimens, two gave false-positive tests for cannabinoid by enzyme-mediated immunoassay (EMIA), one after 1200 mg of ibuprofen in three divided doses for one day and one in a patient taking naproxyn on a chronic basis; none was falsely positive for benzodiazepines. Two urines were false-positive for barbiturates by fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA), one in a patient taking ibuprofen and one in a patient taking naproxyn. These data, collected prospectively, demonstrate the small likelihood of a false-positive immunoassay test result for cannabinoids, benzodiazepines, or barbiturates after the acute or chronic ingestion of ibuprofen, or after the chronic ingestion of naproxyn or fenoprofen.", 
    "41": "Nocturnal plasma melatonin concentrations were measured in seven patients with panic disorder and eight healthy control subjects. The five patients who had never received psychotropic medication had significantly greater melatonin concentrations from 4:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. than the control subjects. In addition it is possible that a phase delay occurred in these unmedicated patients. The findings are discussed in terms of previous studies showing increased melatonin in manic patients and the effect of intense stress on melatonin synthesis. The two patients who had been medication free for only 1 week showed a decreased melatonin rhythm, which is consistent with previous findings in medicated patients.", 
    "42": "Buspirone is a new drug with ansiolitic properties which chemical structure and mechanism of action is different from the classical drugs traditionally used for this symptom. Its farmacokinetic characteristics make it a convenient drug to be used for oral administration. Buspirone's double-blind controlled clinical studies contrasted with benzodiazepines have shown that buspirone has an ansiolitic effect close to them but without sedation or relaxation. Other secondary effects appear with a smaller incidence with buspirone. These properties make buspirone very efficient in anxiety treatment.", 
    "43": "A double-blind randomized parallel group design was used to compare the tolerance and efficacy of zopiclone 7.5 mg, flurazepam 30 mg and placebo taken each night for 3 weeks in a group of 24 out-patients complaining of sleep disturbance. Analogue rating scales were used to assess the efficacy of the treatments while tolerance and residual effects were measured weekly using a battery of performance tests (Critical Flicker Fusion Threshold, Choice Reaction Time, Letter Cancellation and Digit Span). Physical and clinical examinations, including ECG and EEG, were conducted before and after the experimental period and spontaneously reported side-effects were recorded. Analysis of variance on 24 completed cases (8 patients in each treatment group) showed both active treatments to be significantly better than placebo in shortening sleep onset latency. Flurazepam increased the duration of sleep and produced a \"hangover\" of impaired psychomotor function. Zopiclone had no observable effect on early morning performance and was free from residual sedative activity. The lack of residual effects with zopiclone 7.5 mg, at a dose shown to be clinically effective, suggests its use in ambulant or out-patient populations where daytime sedation could interfere with every day activities.", 
    "44": "This double-blind study was performed on 10 aged insomniac patients who received, during 15 days, either triazolam (0.25 mg) or zopiclone (7.5 mg) at bed time. This in-patient period was bounded by two ambulatory periods of 5 days each, and two in-patient periods of 3 days each, during which the patients received a placebo tablet at bed time. Thirteen sleep recordings per patient were performed before (3 nights), upon initiation of active treatment (3 nights), at the end of the active treatment period (3 nights) and during the following 3 \"withdrawal\" nights. A clear improvement of sleep patterns was observed with both drugs, although opposite effects on delta sleep were observed, namely a decrease with triazolam and an increase with zopiclone. A carry-over effect of the enhancement of delta sleep by zopiclone took place during the first 3 withdrawal nights. As is well known, sleep problems become increasingly common with age. Epidemiological studies show that although they only represent 11% of the population. Americans over 60 years old are prescribed about 40% of sleeping pills (Mendelson, 1980). Disturbed sleep in this population is often associated with medical disorders or induced by drugs like beta-adrenergic blockers. It must be admitted, however, that, possibly due to the association with medical or situational problems there have been only few attempts to assess the efficiency of hypnotic drugs in elderly insomniac patients. These are the reasons why in this study the effectiveness of zopiclone was compared to that of triazolam in insomniac patients aged over 60 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "45": "Most studies with zopiclone, a cyclopyrrolone derivative with a short elimination half life (5 h) have compared its hypnotic activity with that of long elimination half life molecules. In this double-blind study in geriatric patients, drugs were administered during 3 weeks and the therapeutic effects of zopiclone at optimal dosage (5 or 7.5 mg) were compared to those of triazolam (0.125 or 0.25 mg). After a 3 day single-blind washout period, placebo responders were excluded and 48 patients were thereafter treated with either placebo (T\u00e9treault et al., 1965), zopiclone or triazolam (Pegram et al., 1980). The initial dosage was increased when indicated at the end of the first week and kept constant thereafter. At the end of the third week of double-blind treatment, a 4 day single-blind placebo washout was performed to assess drug withdrawal effects. Results confirmed the safety and efficacy of both drugs over placebo during active administration. Hypnotic activity was maximal at 7.5 mg of zopiclone and 0.25 mg of triazolam. Drug efficacy was found constant over the 3 week administration both for triazolam and zopiclone. During withdrawal, no true rebound effect was demonstrated but the active drugs were significantly worse than placebo during the first day for sleep onset duration, sleep soundness and quality of sleep. With triazolam some effects persisted up to the third day of withdrawal.", 
    "46": "A double-blind study comparing zopiclone and triazolam, in 48 healthy, chronic insomniacs, was undertaken in two centers to compare the hypnotic and withdrawal effects of both compounds. Comparable doses of 7.5 mg zopiclone and 0.25 mg triazolam were given at bedtime for 21 nights after a 3 day wash-out period, followed by 4 placebo nights of withdrawal monitoring. During the investigation, a 17 item post-sleep questionnaire was completed daily, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale weekly, and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) at baseline and at the end of the study. Withdrawal effects were evaluated with a withdrawal symptom checklist and the CGI (withdrawal). Results indicated that both compounds improved sleep and were equally effective. However, a larger number of triazolam subjects withdrew from the study because of ineffectiveness or adverse side-effects. A greater number of zopiclone subjects experienced a transient modification of taste which disappeared with discontinuation of therapy. Significant deterioration in nearly all sleep parameters were noted after the first withdrawal night of triazolam; much fewer modifications of sleep parameters were observed following the discontinuation of zopiclone.", 
    "47": "Zopiclone, a cyclopyrrolone derivative, was compared with triazolam in a double-blind, randomized, parallel group study in general practice patients suffering from insomnia. Both drugs were found to be effective compared to baseline assessment in that they increased the number of hours of sleep, reduced the number of nocturnal wakenings and reduced the latency of falling asleep. In addition, both drugs improved patients' condition following awakening, with zopiclone showing slight superiority. In both treatment groups, there was a transient period of poor sleep after withdrawal of the drug, and one patient in each group withdrew from the study for this reason. There were no serious adverse reactions during the trial.", 
    "48": "Effective and safe hypnotics exist especially since the introduction of benzodiazepines (BZD) which appeared to bring major advantages over barbiturates. Ideally a new hypnotic should induce and maintain sleep without producing residual effect during the day and should be devoid of abuse and dependence potential. Zopiclone is a new hypnotic belonging to the cyclopyrrolone chemical class. Its elimination half-life is 5 to 6 h, no accumulation exists upon repeated administration, and its pharmacokinetic profile is not substantially modified in elderly and renal failure patients. Placebo-controlled studies have shown that zopiclone 7.5 mg is an effective hypnotic, and that it can improve all sleep variables in insomniacs. Its effects on sleep stages differ from those observed with BZD hypnotics: REM sleep is substantially unaffected by zopiclone and slow wave sleep is either unaffected or increased. Objective and subjective measurements during the day after bedtime administration of zopiclone, showed lack of residual effects and no residual impairment of cognitive functions. Zopiclone discontinuation is not accompanied by rebound effect and relevant withdrawal symptoms. Specific \"craving effect\" studies in alcoholics did not show an abuse potential for zopiclone. Side-effects are represented mainly by bitter taste and dry mouth with a minimal incidence of CNS depressant effects. Studies on the effects of zopiclone on respiratory functions failed to show detrimental effects. Efficacy and safety data on zopiclone suggest that this new drug can represent a useful alternative to existing hypnotics.", 
    "49": "Actions and interactions with ethanol (0.8 g/kg) of triazolam (TRZ, 0.25 mg) and zopiclone (ZOP, 7.5 mg) on performance and memory were studied with 12 healthy young subjects. The randomized double-blind and crossover test sessions were carried out at 1-week intervals. Each time a set of performance tests and self-assessments on visual analogue scales were done before the treatment and 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6 and 8 h after it. The clinical test for drunkenness (CTD) was done 2 and 5 h after drug intake. Venous blood was sampled after each set of tests. Both TRZ and ZOP impaired coordinative and reactive skills, but not peripheral attention or body balance. They also impaired cognitive test performance (digit substitution, symbol copying), and lowered flicker fusion threshold. The psychomotor effects of the two hypnotics and measures of subjective sedation peaked at 1.5 and 3 h. Spatial memory was impaired by TRZ at 4.5 h. Cognitive tests and tracking were most sensitive to alcohol. Furthermore alcohol impaired both motor and vestibular aspects of the CTD while both ZOP and TRZ alone had only minor effects. Alcohol enhanced and prolonged the effects of both hypnotics without modifying their plasma concentrations. Drug-alcohol interactions were mainly additive though more obvious with TRZ. Interactions were evident also on the CTD. The hypnotics were free from residual psychomotor and cognitive effects at 8 h even after the coadministration of alcohol. It is concluded that ZOP and TRZ have a mainly additive interaction with alcohol but pharmacokinetic mechanisms do not seem to contribute essentially to this.", 
    "50": "This was an open study of the efficacy and acceptability of zopiclone 7.5 mg nocte as a somnifacient. The study population comprised 108 insomniac patients (70 female, 38 male) aged 22-74 years who received zopiclone 7.5 mg for 7 consecutive nights. Based on subjective sleep assessments, zopiclone reduced the patients' difficulty in falling asleep, increased the number of hours slept and decreased the number of nocturnal awakenings (p less than 0.001). The majority of patients reported sleeping well or very well. The quality of sleep improved (p less than 0.0001), and the incidence of waking earlier than desired decreased (p less than 0.001), with respect to baseline, after receiving zopiclone. Physicians rated efficacy as good or very good in the majority of patients. Zopiclone was efficacious both in patients who had not previously received hypnotic therapy (n = 37) and in patients who transferred directly to zopiclone from a benzodiazepine hypnotic (n = 26). Whilst receiving zopiclone, patients reported feeling better in the morning than they did prior to treatment (p less than 0.004); 78% expressing satisfaction with zopiclone as an hypnotic. Physicians reported zopiclone treatment to be without side-effects in the majority of patients. In conclusion, zopiclone appears to be an effective and well-tolerated hypnotic that may play a role in the treatment of insomnia in the general population.", 
    "51": "The effects of ethanol (0.2-0.4 g/kg) taken in conjunction with a single nocturnal dose of zopiclone 7.5 mg or nitrazepam 5 mg, on the early morning performance were investigated by means of psychomotor tests in 9 female volunteers. While there was no noticeable difference in the Choice Reaction Time (CRT) for any of the drug-ethanol combinations and ethanol alone, the zopiclone combination appeared to be initially more sedative in the Critical Flicker Fusion test (CFF). Both drug combinations impaired short-term memory and induced retrograde amnesia to the same extent, although only the nitrazepam-ethanol treatment caused further anterograde amnesia as compared to ethanol alone. Finally, both drug-ethanol combinations exhibited equivalent hypnotic properties as assessed by the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ) without any more residual effects than with ethanol alone. These results suggest neither zopiclone, nor nitrazepam potentiate the effects of ethanol at the doses used.", 
    "52": "Sixty insomniac patients participated in a controlled double-blind parallel group study designed to investigate the dose-response relationship of zopiclone. Following 1 day of treatment with placebo, patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 groups and received treatment for 7 days with either placebo, or flurazepam 30 mg, or zopiclone, 3.75 mg, 7.5 mg, 11.25 mg or 15 mg. Four patients were dropped from the study; two from the placebo group due to ineffectiveness and one each in zopiclone 11.25 mg and 15 mg groups due to side-effects. Flurazepam 30 mg significantly improved sleep induction and maintenance by comparison to placebo and was indistinguishable from zopiclone 7.5 mg or higher. Results of a self-administered sleep questionnaire found a predominantly linear relationship between the dose of zopiclone administered and the degree of sleep improvement. The greatest increment in improvement was generally obtained with 3.5 mg and 7.5 mg of zopiclone, with some additional benefit occurring with zopiclone 11.25 mg. Clinicians' global impressions showed that the severity of illness clearly decreased in a dose related manner up to zopiclone 11.25 mg. Although zopiclone was well tolerated at 3.75 mg and 7.5 mg, an increase in side-effects occurred at 11.25 mg and 15 mg, which favours the use of 7.5 mg zopiclone as the optimum dose for most patients, although certain patients may benefit from a higher dose of the drug when well tolerated.", 
    "53": "Six healthy volunteers participated in a study of the pharmacokinetic and psychomotor effects of a single dose of 2 mg of alprazolam compared to placebo when given at night. Alprazolam reached a maximum concentration in the plasma between 0.5 and 2.5 h after the dose. It was extensively distributed to the tissues as shown by the large apparent volume of distribution (1.42 l/kg) and slowly eliminated (t1/2 = 13.7 h). Significant impairment of choice reaction time occurred 1 and 11 h after the dose of alprazolam compared to placebo. Critical flicker fusion was also impaired after alprazolam but the difference from the placebo administration did not reach significance.", 
    "54": "In a prospective, randomised trial bronchoscopy was performed either in local anaesthesia (LA) or general anaesthesia, each on 15 ventilated patients. LA was carried out with oxybuprocain-hydrochloride 1% in repeated doses injected into the trachea and main bronchi, general anaesthesia with midazolam, piritramide and vecuronium bromide. Measurements were performed before, 3 minutes after induction of anaesthesia, immediately after bronchoscopy and 15 and 60 minutes after bronchoscopy. There was no effect on cardiocirculatory function during bronchoscopy in both groups, but we found a decrease in paO2 from 97 to 80 mmHg (median) after application of LA. Subsequent bronchoscopy did not significantly influence paO2. The present study shows that in ventilation patients undergoing fibreoptic bronchoscopy, the application of LA will usually result in a decline of arterial oxygen tension. This procedure should therefore only be performed if general anaesthesia is undesirable, as e.g. in patients being weaned from ventilation.", 
    "55": "In the last 15 years the central effects of adenosine and its importance for neurology and psychiatry have increasingly become an object of investigation. Physiology and metabolism of adenosine have been examined by different research groups. The effects of adenosine in the central nervous system and the various mechanisms of these effects have been described by electrophysiologic methods. The inhibition of the release of several neurotransmitters through adenosine has already been described 10 years ago. In this review studies on binding sites for adenosine receptor ligands are discussed thoroughly. The properties and the highly specific distribution of the distinct receptor subtypes are described. For the functioning of the adenosinergic system the different interactions with other centrally active substances such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, neuroleptics, anti-depressants, opiates, alcohol and carbamazepine have turned out to be of interest. The results of neuropsychiatric investigations on methylxanthines, which are antagonists at the adenosine receptor, are widely considered. Finally the discussion on the importance of the adenosinergic system in different neurological and psychiatric diseases is summed up. The particular significance of adenosine in the modulation of dopaminergic functions is emphasised.", 
    "56": "In a randomized open crossover study, the antiemetic efficacy of a five-drug antiemetic regimen consisting of metoclopramide, dexamethasone, diazepam, diphenhydramine, and thiethylperazine was compared to that of high-dose metoclopramide. Thirteen patients treated with cisplatin combination chemotherapy regimens were evaluated. The study was terminated prior to accrual of the planned number of patients because of the statistically significant difference in efficacy between treatments found at interim analysis. The duration of nausea and number of vomiting episodes on the day of chemotherapy were significantly less (p less than 0.01) after receiving the five-drug combination. After receiving the five-drug regimen, 77% of the patients did not experience any episodes of vomiting on day 1, and 8% of patients had only one episode. In contrast, only 31% of patients treated with high-dose metoclopramide did not have any episodes of vomiting on day 1, and 61% of the patients had five or more episodes. None of the patients treated with the five-drug regimen required additional antiemetic administration. Although both regimens were, in general, well tolerated, when given the choice of continuing antiemetic therapies, 92% of the patients preferred the five-drug antiemetic combination.", 
    "57": "Data from the cross-national study of panic disorder are used for an analysis of response patterns. The main purpose of the study is a search for specific placebo patterns and a discussion of possible differences in patterns from patients treated with alprazolam, imipramine, and placebo. Four outcome measures were registered at baseline and weekly during the treatment period: the number of panic attacks, Physician's Global Evaluation of treatment effect, the Overall Phobia Score and the level on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety. Response patterns from the 3 treatment groups are described and compared, and subsequently categorized with regard to completeness and persistency. No specific placebo pattern is recognized. Some differences are found, however, as many placebo patients demonstrate an early and temporary remission. The variations in response patterns do not compromise the blindness of the study, and their predictive validity is low.", 
    "58": "Effects of 4-aminomethyl-1-benzylpyrrolidin-2-one-hemifumarate (WEB 1881 FU), a novel pyrrolidinone nootropic, on acetylcholine (ACh) receptors and adrenoceptors were investigated using crude membranes of the rat brain. The affinity order of WEB 1881 FU was: M1-muscarinic (m) ACh receptor greater than M2-mACh receptor greater than alpha 2-adrenoceptor greater than beta-adrenoceptor greater than alpha 1-adrenoceptor greater than nicotinic ACh receptor. The WEB 1881 FU-competition curve for [3H]pirenzepine binding in hippocampal membranes was rightward-shifted by GTP gamma S; such behavior was also observed in the case of oxotremorine but not with scopolamine. The effects of long-term administration of WEB 1881 FU (30 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for 21 days resulted in a significant decrease in the Bmax of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum. In addition, the Bmax of [3H]pirenzepine binding to hippocampal and striatal membranes and that of [3H]AF-DX 116 binding to cerebellar membranes were significantly decreased as well. From these results, WEB 1881 FU seems to act on M1-mACh receptors, and its long-term administration probably induces the down-regulation of mACh receptors, mainly M1-mACh receptors in the hippocampus and striatum and M2-mACh receptors in the cerebellum.", 
    "59": "Seventy-nine patients with panic disorder were randomized to an 8-week double-blind treatment with alprazolam, imipramine, or placebo. Patients kept daily records of panic attacks, activity, anxiety, sleep, and medication use. Weekly measures of anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms, fears, avoidance, disability, and improvement were obtained. All patients underwent a symptom-limited exercise treadmill and other cardiovascular measures. By physician and patient global assessment, patients receiving alprazolam or imipramine were significantly better than patients on placebo. The alprazolam effects were apparent by week 1; the imipramine effects by week 4. All groups showed significant reductions in anxiety, depression, somatic measures, and panic attack frequency. At 8 weeks, patients in the alprazolam group reported significantly less fear than patients in the other two groups. Subjects in the imipramine group showed a significant increase in heart rate and blood pressure.", 
    "60": "Three categories of treatments for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) have been proposed: those designed to correct the cause of the disorder; those designed for symptom relief; and those aimed at eliminating the menstrual cycle. Many of these recommendations are based on poor research with loose definitions of the disorder and uncontrolled open trials. This paper reviews the literature on treatment methods with emphasis on recent random, placebo controlled, double-blind studies. The most effective current management of PMS is a conservative one including accurate diagnosis, stress control, sensible levels of diet and exercise and perhaps the use of alprazolam in the premenstrual period. Other approaches such as the use of mefenamic acid and evening oil of primrose remain unproven. Progesterone has been proven uneffective. Further research is required into the value of antidepressant medication.", 
    "61": "Antidepressants inhibit the re-uptake of norepinephrine at the monoaminergic synapse from the synaptic fissure, leading in this way to an increased sensitivity to catecholamines. In addition, antidepressants have alpha1-, H1- and H2-receptor blocking effects and also anticholinergic effects; the tricyclic antidepressants in particular are known for these properties. A few animal experiments and some case reports indicate that a long-term treatment with these substances can lead to intra-operative blood pressure fluctuations, tachycardia and arrhythmias. Therefore a number of authors recommend that antidepressants be withdrawn 3 days before a planned operation. In view of the pharmacokinetics of these substances and the long-term adapting processes at the monoaminergic synapse this period is certainly too short to achieve complete loss of effectiveness. Other authors think preoperative withdrawal is not indicated if there is careful intraoperative monitoring. We agree with the latter opinion. Inhalation anesthesia with isoflurane or enflurane should be preferred. The muscle relaxant pancuronium should not be used, and exogenous intake of catecholamines should be avoided. Opiates seem to have a positive effect on cardiac stability. Benzodiazepines show the least interactions with antidepressants and are therefore recommended for premedication. In the postoperative period the possibility of an anticholinergic syndrome has to be considered.", 
    "62": "According to the hypothesis that the development of physical dependence on and tolerance to opiates depends on the inhibition by opiates of L-asparaginase and L-glutaminase activities in the brain, and the blockade by opiates of the aspartatergic/glutamatergic receptors especially NMDA, four female and fourty-four male heroin addicts were included in a double-blind clinical trial. Four mg chlorpromazine (CPZ) was administered every hour and 10 mg diazepam (DIA) every 6 hours to a group consisting of two female and nineteen male inpatients. The remaining subjects received 15 mg non-opioid antitussive dextromethorphan (DM) instead of CPZ. The withdrawn addicts were controlled twice a day and yawning, lacrimation, rhinorrhoea, perspiration, goose flesh, muscle tremor, dilated pupils, anorexia, joint and muscle aches, restlessness, insomnia, emesis, diarrhea, craving and rejection of smoking as abstinence syndrome signs were observed and rated on a scale of 1, 2 and 3 points according to their intensity. All signs, except perspiration and emesis, were significantly less intense in the group given DM + DIA than CPZ + DIA. The other plus points included the immediate stop of craving and the early onset of smoking in DM + DIA group. The results are considered to be supporting evidence for the hypothesis emphasizing the blockade of NMDA receptors by opiates in opiate addiction. Furthermore, the decrease caused by non-opioid NMDA antagonists in the responsiveness of NMDA receptors appears very promising for the treatment of opiate addicts.", 
    "63": "One hundred adult patients who required mechanical ventilation after open heart surgery for coronary revascularisation were studied. All received a standard premedication and a high dose opioid anaesthetic. On arrival in the intensive care unit they were allocated randomly to receive either propofol or midazolam to maintain sedation within a predetermined range. Patients who received propofol underwent extubation of the trachea, using standard criteria, after a mean time (log-transformed) of 7.6 minutes after sedation for approximately 17 hours. The corresponding time was 125 minutes in those given midazolam. There were significantly higher morphine requirements during sedation, and higher arterial carbon dioxide tensions 30 minutes after extubation of the trachea, in patients who received midazolam. Pharmacokinetic analysis in 20 patients showed that the elimination half-life of propofol was prolonged (470 minutes) and clearance was reduced (1.14 litres/minute) compared with subjects who had not undergone cardiopulmonary bypass. The rapid clinical recovery was reflected in a rapid redistribution half-life (13.4 minutes), but this was also longer than the redistribution time of 2-4 minutes in other patients.", 
    "64": "A randomised double-blind trial was conducted to study the use of two commonly used premedication regimens and the subsequent incidence of sore throat. Fifty adult patients who underwent routine surgery were anaesthetised in a standard fashion after premedication with papaveretum and scopolamine or temazepam, and interviewed after operation to assess the presence of sore throat. A significantly higher incidence of sore throat was associated with the use of papaveretum and scopolamine.", 
    "65": "The drug classes used to treat the major psychiatric disorders--antidepressants, antimanic agents, antipanic drugs, and neuroleptics--all produce side effects that may affect work performance. An understanding of the pharmacology of psychotropic drugs will enable the clinician to recognize the most common adverse effects of these drugs on performance. For example, tertiary amine tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines may decrease alertness. The slowed visual accommodation produced by amine tricyclics or low-potency neuroleptics may adversely affect fine-motor control. Likewise, various psychotropic drugs, including neuroleptics and lithium (at toxic levels), may cause motor incoordination. However, the clinician should bear in mind that failure to provide treatment for psychiatric disorders is far more disruptive than are any side effects of such treatment.", 
    "66": "The present study was part of a larger 3-day, 2-night double-blind parallel group design in which 80 young adult men were divided into eight treatment groups to examine the effects of benzodiazepines and caffeine on nocturnal sleep and daytime sleepiness, performance, and mood. The present study was done to examine further the relationship among daytime sleepiness, performance, mood, and nocturnal sleep and to determine if and how these relationships were affected by the nighttime use of benzodiazepine and the ingestion of caffeine in the morning. Subjects received 15 or 30 mg of flurazepam, 0.25 or 0.50 mg of triazolam, or placebo at bedtime and 250 mg of caffeine or placebo in the morning for two treatment days. Two objective (Multiple Sleep Latency Test and lapses) and two subjective (Stanford Sleepiness Scale and Visual Analog Scale) measures of sleepiness, five performance tests, and two mood measures (Profile of Mood Scale and Visual Analog Scale) were administered repeatedly on both days. Electroencephalogram sleep was recorded on both nights. Objective sleep measures of daytime sleepiness were not significantly related to either performance or mood, but subjects with greater daytime sleepiness had significantly longer and more efficient nocturnal sleep. Neither benzodiazepine or caffeine influenced these relationships. In contrast, higher estimates of subjective sleepiness were significantly associated with poorer mood and tended to be related to poorer performance. Caffeine significantly reduced these relationships. Nocturnal sleep measures were not related to subjective estimates of daytime sleepiness.", 
    "67": "Growth hormone (GH) response to placebo and two different doses of diazepam (0.12 mg/kg and 0.20 mg/kg) were evaluated in 82 healthy young men. Both diazepam doses had a significant effect on the growth hormone secretion, with peak values occurring between 30 and 60 min postinfusion, after which levels returned to baseline. There was also a small but significant change in this hormone over time after placebo, but this was reflected by a slow rise following the saline infusion. Individual GH responses to diazepam were variable and, when a cut-off point of 7.5 ng/ml GH increase before 90 min postdrug administration was used, 1% of the men demonstrated a response after placebo, 17% after low-dose diazepam, and 37% following high-dose diazepam. The clinical implications and limitations of these findings are discussed.", 
    "68": "For the second time in the past ten years adverse reports in the lay press have questioned the safety of triazolam. Anecdotal reports of central nervous system adverse reactions can be separated into four general categories: (1) delirium in psychiatric patients; (2) delirium in geriatric patients; (3) withdrawal reactions; and (4) anterograde amnesia. Of the four, the amnesia reactions are regarded as serious enough by the Food and Drug Administration that it is requiring hypnotic drug manufacturers to revise the labeling of temazepam and flurazepam along with triazolam to emphasize the potential for this class of drugs to cause traveler's amnesia.", 
    "69": "Obsessive compulsive disorder has recently been successfully treated with antidepressants that selectively inhibit serotonin reuptake, and a serotonergic hypothesis related to the etiology and treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder has been proposed. Clonazepam, a novel benzodiazepine, uniquely affects serotonergic neurotransmission. It has been employed in the treatment of other neuropsychiatric syndromes that respond to serotonergic medications. Three patients with obsessive compulsive disorder who were treated with clonazepam for periods of up to 1 year experienced substantial improvement in their symptoms. Clonazepam had a rapid onset of antiobsessive action with accompanying decreases in both depression and anxiety. One patient showed reductions in obsessions and compulsions that were equivalent to or greater than those seen during previous treatment with clomipramine: Clonazepam may be a useful alternative to serotonergic antidepressants in patients who cannot tolerate the toxic effects of these medications.", 
    "70": "The displacement curves of the effect of GABA on the S35-tert-butyl bicyclophosphorothionate binding to the brain membranes of inbred mice were analysed. It was revealed the lack of marked interstrain differences in dependent on the ionic force of incubation medium modification of IC50. After incomplete stimulation of Cl(-)-ionophore subunit (50 mM NaCl) reliable interstrain differences in the value of nHill were shown. Bicuculline in the same conditions prevented the inhibitory effect of GABA (10(-5) M). But submaximal concentrations of bicuculline (5 X 10(-6) M, 10(-6) M) stimulated the radioligand binding in the presence of GABA (10(-6) M). It was marked more expressed bicuculline stimulation effect on the membranes of C57Bl/6 mice, as compared to BALB/c mice.", 
    "71": "To evaluate the effects of ethanol in the human brain, we tested six normal subjects and six alcoholics using positron emission tomography and 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) under baseline conditions and 24 hours later after ethanol administration (1 g/kg). Ethanol inhibited cortical and cerebellar glucose metabolism with relative sparing of the basal ganglia and corpus callosum. This inhibition was more pronounced in the alcoholics than in the controls. Measurement of the constants for glucose transport and utilization showed that decreased glucose metabolism was due to a reduction in glucose phosphorylation and not to a change of glucose transport into the tissue. The pattern of regional metabolic inhibition by alcohol paralleled the distribution of benzodiazepine receptors in the human brain.", 
    "72": "1. (+)-Hydrastine is a phthalide isoquinoline alkaloid, isolated from Corydalis stricta. It has the same 1S,9R configuration as the competitive GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline and is the enantiomer of the commercially available (-)-hydrastine. 2. (+)-Hydrastine (CD50 0.16 mg kg-1, i.v.) was twice as potent as bicuculline (CD50 0.32 mg kg-1, i.v.) as a convulsant in mice. This action was stereoselective in that (+)-hydrastine was 180 times as potent as (-)-hydrastine. 3. (+)-Hydrastine was a selective antagonist at bicuculline-sensitive GABAA receptors in the guinea-pig isolated ileum. It did not influence phaclofen-sensitive GABAB receptors or acetylcholine receptors in this tissue. (+)-Hydrastine was a competitive antagonist of GABAA responses (pA2 6.5) more potent than bicuculline (pA2 6.1). 4. When tested against the binding of [3H]-muscimol to high affinity GABAA binding sites in rat brain membranes, (+)-hydrastine (IC50 2.37 microM) was 8 times more potent than bicuculline (IC50 19.7 microM). 5. As an antagonist of the activation of low affinity GABAA receptors as measured by the stimulation by GABA of [3H]-diazepam binding to rat brain membranes, (+)-hydrastine (IC50 0.4 microM) was more potent than bicuculline (IC50 2.3 microM). 6. (+)-Hydrastine, 10 nM to 1 mM, did not inhibit the binding of [3H]-(-)-baclofen to GABAB binding sites in rat brain membranes.", 
    "73": "In order to clarify melatonin's pharmacological interaction with central gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, its effects on the binding of t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS), which specifically labels GABA-gated chloride channels, was examined in the rat brain. Saturation binding studies indicated that the effect of melatonin (500 microM) was due to a significant decrease in binding site density (Bmax) while the dissociation constant (Kd) was unchanged. The central-type benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor site antagonist Ro15-1788 (flumazenil) did not reverse the effect of melatonin but blocked the effect of diazepam, indicating that central-type BZ sites do not mediate the effects of melatonin. Since the ability to allosterically inhibit TBPS binding is characteristic of GABA-positive ligands, these findings provide further evidence that the pharmacological effects of melatonin involve enhancement of central GABAergic activity.", 
    "74": "The possible involvement of gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine (GABA-BZ) receptor modulation in scopolamine-induced short-term memory deficit was investigated in mice. Passive avoidance step-down task behavior was observed. Latency of mice to reach shock-free zone (SFZ) and number of mistakes the animal made in 15 min were used as separate parameters for acquisition and memory retention, respectively. Scopolamine (0.3 mg/kg) caused a delay in reaching SFZ and an increased number of mistakes. Physostigmine reversed the scopolamine-induced increase in number of mistakes; however, it caused a delay in the time to reach SFZ. Subeffective dose of GABA, when combined with physostigmine, further delayed the latency to reach SFZ, but reduced the number of mistakes very significantly. GABA (50, 75 and 100 mg/kg, i.p.) and GABA agonists sodium valproate (30 and 60 mg/kg, i.p.), fengabine (5 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.), (+/-)baclofen (0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) and (-)baclofen (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg i.p.) reversed the scopolamine-induced effect; however, sodium valproate at higher dose delayed time to reach SFZ. Combined administration of lower dose (+/-)baclofen and subeffective dose of GABA showed significant decrease in latency and number of mistakes in scopolamine-treated animals. The specific benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (Ro-15-1788) (5 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) and inverse agonist FG-7142 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) very significantly reversed scopolamine-induced increase in number of mistakes, but Ro-15-1788 failed to show any effect on latency per se and in scopolamine-treated experiments, as well.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "75": "Rapid tolerance to the sedative effect of large doses of diazepam (10 mg/kg IV), but not of large doses of clonazepam (2 mg/kg IV) occurs in rats after 5 days of treatment on a once-a-day regimen. Electroencephalographic (EEG) studies show that such behavioral tolerance is associated with a decreased induction of spindle bursts and with an increased induction of 20-30 Hz waves (beta-like activity). Administration of clonazepam plus the agonist of the \"peripheral\" benzodiazepine receptor type (omega 3) Ro 5-4864 (4 mg/kg IV) for 5 days induces signs of behavioral and EEG tolerance to sedative effects of the benzodiazepine agonist. In animals treated for 5 days with diazepam plus the omega 3 antagonist PK 11195 (5 mg/kg IV), no signs of EEG and behavioral tolerance are observed. These results suggest that omega 3 type activation influences the development of rapid tolerance to the sedative effect of diazepam in rats.", 
    "76": "A rapid kindling procedure was used to distinguish between the anticonvulsant activity of drugs and their ability to retard the kindling process. MK-801 is a specific ligand at the phencyclidine (PCP) recognition site, and acts as a noncompetitive antagonist of NMDA-type glutamate/aspartate receptors. Intraperitoneal injections of MK-801 (0.5-4.0 mg/kg IP) significantly reduced the cumulated effect of 12 2-hr kindling stimulations, as determined from behavioral measures of seizure activity in immediately ensuing 24-hr drug-free kindling sessions; however, the corresponding electrographic effects did not reach significance. MK-801 also showed significant anticonvulsant activity when injected in fully kindled rats. Higher doses tested were accompanied by locomotor and postural effects. The anticonvulsant benzodiazepine, clonazepam, formulated with a proprietary diluent (as Rivotril, Roche), injected in anticonvulsant doses during the first 12 kindling sessions (0.64 mg/kg IP, repeated after 9 hr) did not significantly affect the course of subsequent sessions of drug-free kindling. Systemic injections of kynurenic acid (300-600 mg/kg IP 4 hours), a nonspecific antagonist of glutamate receptors in vitro, were without significant anticonvulsant or antikindling activity. Activity of NMDA-sensitive glutamate/aspartate receptors associated with the PCP recognition site may induce lasting facilitation of neural transmission; this facilitation may be responsible for the remote propagation and progressive enhancement of seizure activity kindled in the amygdala. The facilitatory process appears to be antagonised by MK-801.", 
    "77": "In the present study, peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors in human circulating mononuclear cells were characterized, using [3H]PK 11195 as specific ligand. The specific binding was saturable, with a Bmax of 14 pmol/mg protein and a Kd of 7 nM. The pharmacological characterization, using different displacing drugs, indicated a mitochondrial type of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor since it was not coupled to the GABA receptor and was displaced by protoporphyrin IX. These data indicate that human circulating mononuclear cells possess benzodiazepine recognition sites, similar to non-neuronal receptors. The role of these receptors and possible modifications in different diseases need to be investigated.", 
    "78": "The antinociceptive properties, as measured by the tail-flick and hot-plate tests, and the motor effects of an intrathecally-administered benzodiazepine agonist midazolam, alone, and in combination with morphine, was examined in rats. Midazolam alone produced a weak but dose-dependent (20-60 micrograms) antinociceptive effect in addition to a clear motor dysfunction at larger doses (60-100 micrograms). An inactive dose of intrathecally-administered midazolam (20 micrograms) produced a leftward shift in the dose-response curve for intrathecally administered morphine, in the thermal antinociceptive tests. This supra-additive effect was antagonized by naloxone (1 mg/kg). The data suggest a synergistic interaction between mu- and GABAA-receptors in the spinal processing of thermally-evoked pain.", 
    "79": "Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to measure muscarinic cholinergic, benzodiazepine, kainate, phencyclidine (PCP), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) (measured in Tris acetate), quisqualate-sensitive, non-quisqualate-sensitive and total glutamate (measured in Tris chloride buffer) binding sites in adjacent sections of the hippocampal region of 10 Alzheimer's disease, nine control, and six demented, non-Alzheimer's disease postmortem human brains. The measurements were compared to the number of neurofibrillary tangles as revealed by Congo red staining of adjacent sections. All assays and measurements were done by observers blinded to the clinical diagnoses. Binding was decreased significantly for all ligands except quisqualate in stratum pyramidale of CA1 of the Alzheimer's disease brains. The binding loss was significantly greater for the non-quisqualate and NMDA sites than for the muscarinic, benzodiazepine and kainate sites with the total glutamate and PCP site losses being intermediate. Only the loss of benzodiazepine binding was significantly correlated with the number of neurofibrillary tangles. Lesser binding losses were seen in adjacent areas. This difference in the degree of binding decrease is consistent with the hypothesis that NMDA receptors are located on more distal dendrites of hippocampal neurons. There they may be relatively more vulnerable than the other receptors to the pathological process.", 
    "80": "It is now thought that ethanol exerts many of its behavioral effects in the CNS by interaction with the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor, and it has been shown that the benzodiazepine reverse agonist Ro15-4513 reverses some of the CNS effects produced by ethanol. The hypothesis was tested that ethanol exerts its teratogenic effects through interaction with a putative embryonic GABA receptor by determining whether Ro15-4513 reverses ethanol-induced forelimb ectrodactyly in C57BL/6 mice. First, pregnant C57BL/6 dams were injected twice i.p. with ethanol (2.9 g/kg body weight, 4 hr apart) on day 10 of gestation: 49% of the fetuses were resorbed or dead and 46% of the survivors showed forelimb ectrodactyly. In contrast, when SWV mice were treated with ethanol, embryolethality was only 11.9% and no forelimb ectrodactyly was observed. In a second experiment, when ethanol (2.6 g/kg x 2) was administered to C57BL/6 mice, 34% resorptions and 31% forelimb ectrodactyly were observed. Ectrodactyly induced by ethanol was primarily of the forelimb and exclusively postaxial. Ethanol produced an unusual forelimb defect in a small number of instances where there was a postaxial autopod reduction defect coupled with a preaxial zeugopod reduction defect. Ro15-4513 administered alone (50 mg/kg x 2) was neither embryolethal nor teratogenic in C57BL/6 mice. To attempt to reverse the teratogenic effect of ethanol, dams that were injected 5 min before each ethanol administration with Ro15-4513 (0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg twice) showed no significant change in frequency of forelimb ectrodactyly compared to embryos treated with ethanol alone. However, resorptions increased significantly to 77% and 62% with the 5 and 10 mg/kg doses of Ro15-4513. Thus there appears to be an embryolethal interaction of Ro15-4513 with ethanol. Nevertheless, since Ro15-4513 did not reverse the teratogenic effect induced by ethanol, these results do not support the hypothesis that the teratogenic mechanism of ethanol is mediated through a putative embryonic GABA receptor.", 
    "81": "The purified gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptor protein from mammalian brain contains at least four discrete polypeptides (Mr 51,000, 53,000, 55,000 and 58,000) by a variety of visualization techniques and in three species (rat, cow, and human). These polypeptide bands vary in their affinity for gamma-aminobutyric acid analogs as shown by inhibition of [3H]muscimol binding, demonstrated by photoaffinity labeling and gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. One-dimensional peptide maps of proteolytic digests revealed that distinct fragments were produced, indicating that the four polypeptides represent discrete sequences. The four bands were identified by Western blotting with subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies as two species each of previously identified alpha and beta subunits. [3H]Muscimol photolabeled all four bands (beta and alpha) to varying degrees not proportional to the extent of protein staining. The Mr 58,000 beta subunit subtype showed a higher affinity for 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-isoxazolo-[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol than the Mr 56,000 beta subtype, whereas the Mr 56,000 beta and Mr 51,000 alpha bands were more enhanced by pentobarbital than the Mr 58,000 band. Furthermore, the alpha subunit pattern revealed by photoaffinity labeling with [3H]flunitrazepam was significantly different for three regions of bovine brain, showing only one major band in cerebellum at Mr 51,000, two major bands in cortex at Mr 53,000 and 51,000, and three bands in hippocampus at Mr 55,000 as well as Mr 53,000 and 51,000. Because the ratio of the amounts of the various polypeptides varies with brain region and the pharmacological properties of the peptides vary, it is likely that a family of oligomeric gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptors exists in the brain. This is consistent with the reported variable expression of different subunit subtype mRNAs and with brain region-dependent variation in pharmacology and binding behavior.", 
    "82": "A mutant murine cell line has previously been reported to be resistant to the AT-specific DNA minor groove ligand 2',5'-bi-1H-benzimidazole, 2',(4-ethoxyphenyl)-5-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl), trichloride (Ho33342), due to an enhanced capacity to remove ligand molecules from cellular DNA via a pathway which can be blocked by DNA topoisomerase poisons. We have studied the relationship between ligand resistance and DNA topoisomerase II activity. The cross-sensitivity patterns of the mutant were examined for covalently (anthramycin) and non-covalently (distamycin A) binding minor groove ligands, and DNA intercalating [adriamycin, mitoxantrone and 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulphon-m-anisidide (mAMSA)] and non-intercalating (VP16-213) topoisomerase II poisons. The mutant was cross-resistant to distamycin A alone. The mutant showed no abnormality in: (i) the in vitro decatenation activity of topoisomerase II, (ii) VP16-213 or mAMSA induced protein-DNA cross-linking activities in nuclear extracts, (iii) 'cleavable complex' generation (or DNA strand scisson) in intact cells exposed to topoisomerase poisons. Ho33342 and the topoisomerase II inhibitor novobiocin were found to disrupt both the in vitro binding of nuclear extracted proteins, from mutant and parental cells, to plasmid DNA and the formation of drug-induced cleavable complexes in vitro. Unexpectedly, Ho33342 induced significant levels of DNA-protein crosslinking in both parental and mutant cells. We conclude that: (i) resistance of the mutant is limited to non-covalently binding minor groove ligands, (ii) Ho33342 can block the trapping of DNA topoisomerase II by enzyme poisons in vitro, (iii) Ho33342 can induce a novel form of DNA-protein cross-link in intact cells, and (iv) the resistance of the mutant is not dependent upon some abnormality in topoisomerase II function.", 
    "83": "A prospective study of 324 adult patients undergoing operations requiring cardiopulmonary bypass for heart valve replacement was undertaken to determine the effect of anesthetic technique on outcome. Patients received one of three primary techniques: fentanyl (40-100 micrograms/kg), sufentanil (4-8 micrograms/kg), or diazepam (0.4-1 mg/kg) with ketamine (3-6 mg/kg). Supplemental inhalation anesthesia with enflurane, halothane, or isoflurane was used in 43.8% of cases. Patients in these anesthetic groupings had similar perioperative demographic and risk classifications. Although there were differences in the requirements for vasopressors postoperatively among the intravenous anesthetic agents, neither mortality rates, length of ICU stay, nor incidence of postoperative heart failure showed the advantage of any intravenous or inhalational agent. There were also no significant differences in the incidences of serious pulmonary, renal, or neurologic morbidity among primary anesthetic techniques nor among supplemental inhalation agents. Multivariate discriminant analysis of these data suggests that many factors are significantly more important than anesthetic technique as determinants of outcome after heart valve replacement.", 
    "84": "The selective dopamine D-1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (30 micrograms/kg, SC) significantly reduced palatable food consumption by nondeprived rats in a 30-min test period. Prior administration of the selective CCK-A receptor antagonist devazepide (MK 329; L-364,718) blocked the hypophagic effect of SCH 23390. In contrast, prior administration of the selective CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonist L-365,260 had no effect. Devazepide did not antagonize a matched hypophagic effect produced by the dopamine D-2 receptor antagonist raclopride (0.1 mg/kg, SC). These data direct attention to possible dopamine-cholecystokinin interactions in relation to the control of ingestional responses, and, more specifically, indicate possible functional relationships between D-1 and CCK-A receptor mechanisms.", 
    "85": "The purpose of this double-blind randomized study was to assess recovery of mental function following reversal of midazolam-induced sedation with the specific antagonist flumazenil (R015-1788) or placebo following conservative dental procedures. Recovery was assessed using choice reaction time and critical flicker fusion threshold, both objective tests of psychomotor function; linear analogue sedation scores and simple memory tests. Assessments were repeated up to 3 h after administration of flumazenil or placebo to discover whether recovery was sustained or whether resedation occurred due to the short duration of action of flumazenil. Flumazenil in doses from 0.5 to 1.0 mg rapidly reversed the sedative and amnesic effects of a mean dose of 8.2 mg of midazolam without apparent evidence of subsequent resedation. Since recovery of mental function in the control group had ordinarily occurred 45 min after administration of placebo, routine reversal of midazolam sedation with flumazenil cannot be justified. Nevertheless, in cases of undue sedation persisting after dental treatment, flumazenil may be used with minimal risk of resedation occurring.", 
    "86": "A new class of drugs, the benzodiazepine inverse agonists, have recently been shown to antagonize some of the behavioral and sedative effects of benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol. Preliminary studies suggested that at least one of these drugs, RO 15-4513, may also be able to reverse the general anesthetic properties of volatile halogenated agents. Another inverse agonist, FG 7142, exhibits a similar ability to antagonize alcohol or benzodiazepines. However, FG 7142 is less potent than RO 15-4513 and has less affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR). The present studies were therefore undertaken to compare the analeptic effects and relative potencies of RO 15-4513 and FG 7142 on the anesthetic properties of pentobarbital compared with the general anesthetic agent halothane as measured by the time for recovery of the righting reflex in the rat. Three basic experimental paradigms were employed. Drug (FG or RO) or carrier was administered 5 minutes prior to the induction of pentobarbital anesthesia. Drug or carrier was administered to anesthetized animals 60 minutes after pentobarbital injection. Lastly, drug or carrier was administered 5 minutes prior to 15 minutes of halothane anesthesia. In addition, the selective benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil (RO 15-1788), was used to determine if the effects of the benzodiazepine inverse agonists on recovery from barbiturate or halothane anesthesia were due to activity at the BZR. The results revealed that RO was both more potent and more effective than FG at speeding recovery from barbiturate anesthesia in the rat. RO's effects appeared to be primarily due to BZR inverse agonist activity since it could be reversed by the BZR antagonist, flumazenil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "87": "Behavioral and biochemical experiments on male albino mice have revealed similar effects after the cessation of repeated (15 days) haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg daily IP) and caerulein (0.1 mg/kg daily SC) treatment. Tolerance developed to the action of muscimol (a GABA-A agonist, 1 mg/kg IP), caerulein (a CCK-8 agonist, 15 micrograms/kg SC) and flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist, 10 mg/kg IP). Muscimol and caerulein were not able to suppress the motor activity of mice after 15 days treatment with haloperidol and caerulein. Flumazenil, which increased motor activity in saline-treated animals, also failed to affect activity after extended haloperidol or caerulein treatment. In contrast, the motor excitation induced by amphetamine (an indirect dopamine agonist, 3 mg/kg IP) was increased after haloperidol or caerulein administration. In radioligand binding studies the density of dopamine-2-receptors in striatum, opioid receptors in mesolimbic structures, and benzodiazepine and GABA-A receptors in brainstem was significantly elevated after long-term haloperidol or caerulein treatment. Simultaneously, the number of CCK-8, benzodiazepine and GABA-A receptors in cerebral cortex was decreased. It is probable that CCK-8-ergic mechanisms are involved closely in the action of repeated haloperidol treatment. CCK-8 seems to modulate the action of haloperidol through altering the sensitivity of dopamine, opioid, GABA-A and benzodiazepine receptors."
