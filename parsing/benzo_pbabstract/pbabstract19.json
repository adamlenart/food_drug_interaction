Following a pilot trial assessing interim buprenorphine-naloxone treatment in order to facilitate transfer into OMT, we here aimed to study retention, and potential correlates of retention, in full-scale treatment. Thirty-six patients successfully referred from a waiting list through an interim treatment phase were followed for nine months in OMT. Baseline characteristics, as well as urine analyses during the interim phase and during full-scale OMT, were studied as potential correlates of retention. The nine-month retention in OMT was 83 percent (n = 30). While interim-phase urine samples positive for benzodiazepines did not significantly predict dropout from full-scale OMT (p = 0.09), urine samples positive for benzodiazepines within full-scale OMT were significantly associated with dropout (p < 0.01), in contrast to other substances and baseline characteristics.

A part of these anesthetics have been reported to influence a blood biochemical level. It is important for us to understand the effect of the anesthetic on blood biochemistry when we choose the anesthetic agent to be used in experiments. In this study, we examined the blood biochemical changes in mice after administration of a new mixture of three anesthetic agents -medetomidine / midazolam / butorphanol (MMB). We subcutaneously administered two dose combinations of MMB (0.45 / 6 / 7.5 and 0.9 / 12 / 15 mg/kg) in mice, followed by administration of atipamezole, for reversal of anesthetic effects, after 1 hr. Thereafter, blood biochemistry was assessed at 1, 4 and 24 hr after MMB administration. We observed that MMB administration caused a transient increase in blood sugar, inorganic phosphorus, potassium and creatine kinase levels. These, however, returned to the reference range 24 hr after MMB administration. In conclusion, MMB changes the levels of some blood biochemical parameters, but not to an extent that would threaten health. However, when using laboratory animals, this effect of MMB may influence the experimental results, depending on the experimental content. Hence, the choice of anesthetic agents used in laboratory animals should be based on detailed knowledge of their pharmacological effects.",

    "21": "Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (OCRDs) have been introduced in a revision to DSM-5 as a novel category that is distinct from other anxiety disorders in DSM-IV. OCRDs consist of 5 primary disorders: obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), hoarding disorder (HD), skin picking disorder (SPD), and hair pulling disorder (HPD), which share core clinical features such as preoccupation or recurrent thoughts and/or repetitive behaviors. Repetitive behaviors in BDD and HD can be differentially characterized by the presence of cognitive components associated with preceding anxiety from those in SPD or HPD, which are only observed as motoric components that regulate emotions or alleviate tension. Thus, the validity of the OCRD category and specific interrelationships between each OCRD remain uncertain. In the present study, therefore, we presented a case of multiple comorbidities of OCRDs in order to discuss the nature of the OCRD category. Our patient was a 20-year-old female university student. At the age of 11 years old, she started picking at acne on her face. The psychopathological, and treatment features observed in this case indicated possible interrelationships among OCRDs, especially between cognitive and motoric OCRDs, which supported the clinical utility and continuous nature of this category.", 
    "22": "While previous studies find mixed evidence of an association between opioid use and intimate partner violence perpetration among community samples, initial evidence has detected increased rates of partner violence among individuals receiving pharmacological intervention for opioid dependence. The current study evaluated the role of current comorbid substance use diagnoses, a robust risk factor for violent behavior, on the likelihood of perpetrating partner violence among a high risk sample of offenders receiving pharmacological intervention for opioid dependence. The authors analyzed self-report data provided by 81 (55 male) opioid dependent offenders during a court-ordered substance use interview. Approximately one-third of the sample evidenced the recent use of intimate partner violence. Findings indicated that cocaine and benzodiazepine use were independently associated with an increased likelihood of reporting physical partner violence. Alcohol and cannabis use were not associated with partner violence. The current results offer further support for the ongoing need to conduct routine partner violence screenings among substance involved offenders and highlight the importance of developing individualized treatment plans that address comorbid substance use and partner-violent behaviors among individuals in treatment for opioid dependence.", 
    "23": "Pharmaco-electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method used to assess the effects of pharmacological compounds on the central nervous system by processing the EEG signals which directly reveal the spontaneous synchronised postsynaptic neuronal activity of the cortex with high temporal resolution. The International Pharmaco-Encephalography Society (IPEG) has recently published guidelines, which were produced by a global panel of EEG experts, with the goal to increase the standardisation of pharmaco-EEG studies in human subjects and facilitate the comparability of data across laboratories, thus enabling data-pooling and meta-analyses. The recommended standard experimental procedure is to measure EEG activity under vigilance-controlled and resting conditions. The IPEG guidelines thoroughly present the technical details and therefore constitute a robust reference. The complementary aim of the present paper is to focus on practical aspects, pitfalls and precautions to be considered when processing pharmaco-EEG data by covering the following topics: (1) investigate the stability and reliability of 5-min EEG recordings under both vigilance-controlled and resting conditions; (2) assess the spontaneous time-dependent changes in spectral activity over time, and (3) apply the data-processing strategies suggested in the pharmaco-EEG guidelines and designed to optimally capture drug effects. For this purpose, the EEG data from a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial aimed at comparing the effect of diazepam (10 mg) and placebo in 16 healthy male volunteers is used to illustrate the discussion of the processing techniques and difficulties commonly faced when analysing pharmaco-EEG data.",

    "53": "The authors evaluated all available evidence on the use of propofol as an adjuvant for the treatment of resistant alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) in comparison to other therapies. A comprehensive PubMed search (1966-December 2015) was conducted using the search terms propofol, alcohol withdrawal, and drug therapy. Articles were cross-referenced for other citations. Clinical studies, case series, and case reports published in the English language assessing the use of propofol in adult patients for treatment of AWS were reviewed for inclusion. Propofol is a sedative-hypnotic that exerts its actions through agonism of GABAA receptors at a different binding site than benzodiazepines and reduces glutamatergic activity through N-methyl-d-aspartase (NMDA) receptor blockade. Dosages from 5 to 100\u00a0\u03bcg/kg/minute reduced AWS symptoms with frequent development of hypotension and requirement for mechanical ventilation. Patients on propofol often experienced longer durations of mechanical ventilation and length of stay, which may be attributed to more-resistant cases of AWS. When propofol was compared with dexmedetomidine as adjuncts in AWS, both agents showed similar benzodiazepine- and haloperidol-sparing effects. Dexmedetomidine was associated with more numerical rates of bradycardia, while propofol was associated with more numerical instances of hypotension. Dexmedetomidine was used more frequently in nonintubated patients. The available data assessing the utility of propofol for AWS exhibited significant heterogeneity. Propofol may be useful in a specific population of patients with AWS, limited to those who are not clinically responding to first-line therapy with benzodiazepines. Specifically, propofol should be considered in patients who are refractory to or not candidates for other adjuvant therapies, patients already requiring mechanical ventilation, or those with seizure activity or refractory delirium tremens. In severe, refractory AWS, adjuvant therapy with propofol may be considered but requires further research to recommend its use either preferentially or as monotherapy.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of midazolam sedation on salivary cortisol and its correlation with children's behaviour during restorative dental treatment. Eighteen healthy children, aged two to five years, were randomly assigned to two dental treatment appointments, both with physical restraint: oral midazolam 1 mg/kg (MS) and placebo (PS). An observer assessed the children's behaviour (videos) using the Ohio State University Behavioral Rating Scale (OSUBRS). The children's saliva was collected just after waking up, on arrival at the dental school, 25 minutes after local anaesthesia, and 25 minutes after the end of the procedure. Salivary cortisol levels were determined using the enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. The data were analysed by bivariate tests and multivariate analysis of variance (5% level). Salivary cortisol levels were lower in the MS group than in the PS group at the time of anaesthesia (p = 0.004), but did not vary during the appointment within sedation (p = 0.319) or placebo (p = 0.080) groups. Children's behaviour was negative most of the time and did not differ between MS and PS; however, the behaviour (OSUBRS) did not correlate with salivary cortisol levels. Oral midazolam is able to control salivary cortisol levels during dental treatment of pre-schoolers, which might not lead to better clinical behaviour.", 
    "55": "Second generation antipsychotic drugs (SGAs) cause substantial body weight gain/obesity and other metabolic side-effects such as dyslipidaemia. Their antagonistic affinity to the histaminergic H1 receptor (H1R) has been identified as one of the main contributors to weight gain/obesity side-effects. The effects and mechanisms of betahistine (a histaminergic H1R agonist and H3 receptor antagonist) have been investigated for ameliorating SGA-induced weight gain/obesity in both animal models and clinical trials. It has been demonstrated that co-treatment with betahistine is effective in reducing weight gain, associated with olanzapine in drug-na\u00efve patients with schizophrenia, as well as in the animal models of both drug-na\u00efve rats and rats with chronic, repeated exposure to olanzapine. Betahistine co-treatment can reduce food intake and increase the effect of thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue by modulating hypothalamic H1R-NPY-AMPK\u03b1 (NPY: neuropeptide Y; AMPK\u03b1: AMP-activated protein kinase \u03b1) pathways, and ameliorate olanzapine-induced dyslipidaemia through modulation of AMPK\u03b1-SREBP-1-PPAR\u03b1-dependent pathways (SREBP-1: Sterol regulatory element binding protein 1; PPAR\u03b1: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1) in the liver. Although reduced locomotor activity was observed from antipsychotic treatment in rats, betahistine did not affect locomotor activity. Importantly, betahistine co-treatment did not influence the effects of antipsychotics on serotonergic receptors in the key brain regions for antipsychotic therapeutic efficacy. However, betahistine co-treatment reverses the upregulated dopamine D2 binding caused by chronic olanzapine administration, which may be beneficial in reducing D2 supersensitivity often observed in chronic antipsychotic treatment. Therefore, these results provide solid evidence supporting further clinical trials in treating antipsychotics-induced weight gain using betahistine in patients with schizophrenia and other mental disorders.",

Delayed and breakthrough CINV, however, continue to be difficult to manage despite available treatment agents. Randomized clinical trial data suggest that olanzapine, a second-generation thienobenzodiazepine, traditionally used in the treatment of manifestations of psychotic disorders, is an effective agent in these clinical settings. The short-term use of olanzapine has a favorable adverse event profile and was not associated with grade 3 or 4 toxicity in a phase III study.

Most commonly reported sexual problems caused by AAPs are decreases in libido or arousal, erectile dysfunctions, reduced/abnormal ejaculations, and problems in achieving or maintaining orgasm. Olanzapine is less commonly implicated for those adverse effects, which may reflect its more selective affinity to dopaminergic receptors or more transient effects on prolactin levels. Sexual dysfunction with AAPs, including OLZ, is reported predominantly in adult patients and adverse sexual effects in prepubertal/peripubertal patients with psychosis received scant attention. Studies and reports of sexual adverse effects of AAPs in this special population may benefit clinicians. Therefore, in this study, we report an adolescent male patient with psychosis who developed spontaneous ejaculations with OLZ and whose complaints remitted with change in treatment.",

To estimate the prevalence of delirium among inpatients admitted at an oncological cancer ward 2. To investigate whether simple clinical factors predict delirium 3. To examine the value of cognitive testing in the assessment of delirium. Methods On five different days, we interviewed and assessed patients admitted to a Danish cancer ward. The World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases Version 10, WHO ICD-10 Diagnostic System and the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) were used for diagnostic categorization. Clinical information was gathered from medical records and all patients were tested with Mini Cognitive Test, The Clock Drawing Test, and the Digit Span Test. Results 81 cancer patients were assessed and 33% were diagnosed with delirium. All delirious participants were CAM positive. Poor performance on the cognitive tests was associated with delirium. Medical records describing CNS metastases, benzodiazepine or morphine treatment were associated with delirium. Conclusions Delirium is prevalent among cancer inpatients. The Mini Cognitive Test, The Clock Drawing Test, and the Digit Span Test can be used as screening tools for delirium among inpatients with cancer, but even in synergy, they lack specificity. Combining cognitive testing and attention to nurses' records might improve detection, yet further studies are needed to create a more detailed patient profile for the detection of delirium.",

    "84": "Blood pressure (BP) monitoring devices are very commonly used by the general public for self-measurement. Approximately 19% of people using these devises check their BP every day or almost every day and only one third use them because their doctor recommended it. Measurement often causes anxiety and anxiety increases blood pressure in the short term. Elderly patients often visit the emergency room (ER) due to these BP elevations. Almost 10% of patients presenting to ERs complained of high BP, and between 50-75% of them receive antihypertensive drugs (sometimes with serious adverse effects) despite the fact that only 7.5% are classified as hypertensive emergencies, and only 2.8% are at risk of serious outcome. Two studies suggested the use of anxiolitics in the treatment of excessive hypertension. When compared to captopril, treatment with diazepam or alprazolam showed to be effective in lowering BP, with no significant difference between the two groups. We therefore suggest that patients with acute elevations of BP (measured at home) try an anxiolytic before deciding to go to the ER. Patients in which BP lowers with the use of tranquilizers do not need to go to the ER. We also suggest using this strategy in patients visiting community clinics and ER for the same reason. Our hypothesis is that by using our suggestions there will be a significant reduction in the number of unnecessary visits to the ER, the use of medication that may produce serious adverse effects, and an important health cost reduction, without increasing the risk for patients (a 10% reduction of ER visits may save up to 300 million dollars/year in the US alone and prevent unnecessary use of medical facilities and manpower).",

Using the \u03b11/\u03b15 benzodiazepine receptor PET radioligand [(11)C]Ro15 4513, we previously showed reduced binding in the nucleus accumbens and hippocampus in abstinent alcohol dependence. We proposed that reduced [(11)C]Ro15 4513 binding in the nucleus accumbens was a marker of addiction whilst the reduction in hippocampus and positive relationship with memory was a consequence of chronic alcohol abuse. To examine this further we assessed [(11)C]Ro15 4513 binding in another addiction, opiate dependence, and used spectral analysis to estimate contributions of \u03b11 and \u03b15 subtypes to [(11)C]Ro15 4513 binding in opiate and previously acquired alcohol-dependent groups. Opiate substitute maintained opiate-dependent men (n=12) underwent an [(11)C]Ro15 4513 PET scan and compared with matched healthy controls (n=13). We found a significant reduction in [(11)C]Ro15 4513 binding in the nucleus accumbens in the opiate-dependent compared with the healthy control group. There was no relationship between [(11)C]Ro15 4513 binding in the hippocampus with memory. We found that reduced [(11)C]Ro15 4513 binding was associated with reduced \u03b15 but not \u03b11 subtypes in the opiate-dependent group. This was also seen in an alcohol-dependent group where an association between memory performance and [(11)C]Ro15 4513 binding was primarily driven by \u03b15 and not \u03b11 subtype. We suggest that reduced \u03b15 levels in the nucleus accumbens are associated with addiction since we have now shown this in dependence to two pharmacologically different substances, alcohol and opiates.", 
    "96": "Recently, the detection of pharmaceuticals in surface waters has increased worldwide. Pharmaceuticals are typically found in the environment at concentrations well below therapeutic levels in humans; however, their mechanisms of action may be largely unknown in non-target organisms, such as teleost species. Thus, chronic exposure to these types of compounds warrants further investigation. The goal of this study was to examine the potential for diazepam, a model benzodiazepine drug, to bioconcentrate in tissues of channel catfish and to examine its ability to interact with the endocrine system through modulation of steroid hormones and/or steroidogenic genes. To investigate the bioconcentration potential of diazepam, channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) were exposed to 1 ng/mL diazepam for seven days, followed by clean water for another seven days, using an abbreviated OECD 305 Fish Bioconcentration Test study design. This concentration of diazepam is well below environmentally relevant concentrations of diazepam (ng/L). To evaluate steroidogenic effects, fish were exposed to 1 ng/mL diazepam for seven days only. Steroid hormone concentrations were analyzed for various tissues, as well as expression of selected steroidogenic genes. Calculated bioconcentration factors for diazepam were well below regulatory threshold values in all tissues analyzed. No changes in steroid hormone concentration were detected in any tissue analyzed; however, the steroidogenic gene cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage (P450scc) was significantly down-regulated at day 5 and 3\u03b2-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase (3\u03b2-HSD) was significantly down-regulated at day 7 in the gonad. These results indicate that although diazepam does not significantly bioconcentrate, low-level chronic exposure to diazepam may have the potential to interact with endocrine function by altering gene expression.",

    "101": "Diazepam binds with the same high affinity to the central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, which has been renamed translocator protein (TSPO). Both receptors could promote neurosteroid synthesis. In the present study, we investigated whether a single dose of diazepam could inhibit neuropathic pain induced by L5 spinal nerve ligation (L5 SNL), and whether CBR and TSPO mediated this effect. We found that a single intraperitoneal injection of diazepam 9 d after L5 SNL significantly depressed the established mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia, which persisted until the end of the experiments. Furthermore, the effects were mimicked by a single intraperitoneal injection of Ro5-4864, a specific TSPO agonist and pregnenolone, a neurosteroid precursor. In addition, we found that the inhibitory effect of diazepam was also completely blocked by pretreatment with a specific CBR antagonist, flumazenil. The effects of diazepam or Ro5-4864 on neuropathic pain were completely blocked by pretreatment with a neurosteroid synthesis inhibitor, aminoglutethimide (AMG). Finally, any one of the three drugs, diazepam, Ro5-4864 and pregnenolone, could reduce the activation of astrocytes and the production of interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2) in the L5 spinal dorsal horn 14 d after L5 SNL. These results suggest that in addition to exerting effects on CBR, diazepam may inhibit neuropathic pain via TSPO, which promotes neurosteroid formation, subsequently reducing the activation of astrocytes and production of cytokines.", 
    "102": "Restless Legs Syndrome/Willis-Ekbom Disease (RLS/WED) is a common condition characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs, concomitant with an unpleasant sensation in the lower limbs, which is typically relieved by movement. Symptoms occur predominantly at rest and prevail in the afternoon or evening. Treatment of patients with RLS/WED is indicated for those patients who suffer from clinically relevant symptoms. The management of mild forms of RLS/WED is mainly based on dopamine agonists (DA) therapy (including pramipexole and ropinirole) and \u03b1-2-\u03b4 calcium-channel ligand. Nevertheless, with passing of time, symptoms tend to become more severe and the patient can eventually develop pharmacoresistance. Furthermore, long-term treatment with dopaminergic agents may be complicated by the development of augmentation, which is defined by an increase in the severity and frequency of RLS/WED symptoms despite adequate treatment. Here, we discuss which are the best therapeutic options when RLS/WED becomes intractable, with a focus on advantages and side effects of the available medications. Prevention strategies include managing lifestyle changes and a good sleep hygiene. Different drug options are available. Switching to longer-acting dopaminergic agents may be a possibility if the patient is well-tolerating DA treatment. An association with \u03b1-2-\u03b4 calcium-channel ligand is another first-line approach. In refractory RLS/WED, opioids such as oxycodone-naloxone have demonstrated good efficacy. Other pharmacological approaches include IV iron, benzodiazepines such as clonazepam, and antiepileptic drugs, with different level of evidence of efficacy. Therefore, the final decision regarding the agent to use in treating severe RLS/WED symptoms should be tailored to the patient, taking into account the symptomatology, comorbidities, the availability of treatment and the history of the disease.",

Thus, it is essential that the identification of NPS keeps up with this rapidly evolving market. In this case study, the Belgian Customs authorities apprehended a parcel, originating from China, containing two samples, declared as being \"white pigments\". For routine identification, the Belgian Customs Laboratory first analysed both samples by gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry and Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy. The information obtained by these techniques is essential and can give an indication of the chemical structure of an unknown substance but not the complete identification of its structure. To bridge this gap, scientific and technical support is ensured by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) to the European Commission Directorate General for Taxation and Customs Unions (DG TAXUD) and the Customs Laboratory European Network (CLEN) through an Administrative Arrangement for fast recognition of NPS and identification of unknown chemicals. The samples were sent to the JRC for a complete characterization using advanced techniques and chemoinformatic tools. The aim of this study was also to encourage the development of a science-based policy driven approach on NPS. These samples were fully characterized and identified as 5F-AMB and PX-3 using (1)H and (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high-resolution tandem mass-spectrometry (HR-MS/MS) and Raman spectroscopy.

The group treated with clonazepam had less favorable results for VAS (P\u2009=\u20090.33), McGill Pain Questionnaire (P\u2009=\u20090.005), PPI (P\u2009=\u20090.013), and OHIP-49 (P\u2009=\u20090.25). Levels of anxiety and depression did not change statistically in any groups (P\u2009>\u20090.05). Comparing the two groups, LLLT appeared to be superior in improving pain perception, but statistically only at 8 weeks after the end of the protocol proposed (P\u2009=\u20090.026). Based on this preliminary trial, LLLT is capable of reducing the symptoms of patients with BMS with a constant and long-lasting effect, experienced since the end of the first applications.",

As separation column, an acrylate-based porous polymer monolith is implemented into the glass chip by photopolymerization. For the establishment and development of this method, we used a test mixture detectable with both fluorescence and ESI-MS. After successful evaluation of the approach with the test solutes, it was applied exemplarily for drug analysis such as high-speed separations of benzodiazepines in pharmaceuticals.", 
    "107": "The aim of this study was to assess the influence of evodiamine on the activities of the drug-metabolizing enzymes cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in rats. The activities of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 were measured using specific probe drugs. After pretreatment for 1 week with evodiamine or physiological saline (control group) by oral administration, probe drugs phenacetin (5.0 mg/kg; CYP1A2 activity), tolbutamide (1.0 mg/kg; CYP2C9 activity), omeprazole (10 mg/kg; CYP2C19 activity), metoprolol (20 mg/kg; CYP2D6 activity) and midazolam (10 mg/kg; CYP3A4 activity) were administered to rats by oral administration. The blood was then collected at different times for ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. The data showed that evodiamine exhibits an inhibitory effect on CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 by increasing t(1/2), Cmax and AUC(0-\u221e), and decreasing CL/F compared with those of the control group. However, no significant changes in CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 activities were observed. In conclusion, the results indicated that evodiamine could inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6, which may affect the disposition of medicines primarily dependent on these pathways. Our work may be the basis of related herb-drug interactions in the clinic.",

    "109": "In a double-blind study, 25 patients were randomly assigned to receive 24 weeks of either olanzapine plus metformin or olanzapine plus placebo. Metformin extended release was titrated to 2000 mg daily as tolerated. No other antipsychotics were allowed, whereas psychotropic medications including antidepressants and mood stabilizers were permitted. The primary outcome measures were change in body weight and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance from baseline to week 24.", 
    "110": "The intent-to-treat population comprised patients who had 1 or more post-baseline visit. Mean change in body weight for the olanzapine plus metformin (O/M) group was 5.5 lb, which was less than the 12.8 lb gain for the olanzapine plus placebo (O/P) group (P < 0.05). Compared with O/P group who gained 7% of their body weight, patients in the O/M group gained 3% (P < 0.037). Body mass index change in the O/M group was 0.85 versus 2.02 in the O/P group (P < 0.045). There was a trend for a greater increase in baseline to end point homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance and waist circumference in the O/P group versus the O/M group.", 
    "111": "In this naturalistic sample of typical US community-dwelling patients, metformin was effective and well tolerated for the prevention of olanzapine-associated weight gain. Adjunctive metformin should be studied in a similar but larger population to determine its role in the prevention of olanzapine-associated weight gain.", 
    "112": "Occupational allergy in healthcare workers is common and can lead to significant costs from both loss of productivity within the workforce as well as those associated with diagnosis and treatment. This review aims to provide an update on drugs implicated in causing occupational allergy.", 
    "113": "Drugs traditionally reported as causing occupational allergy, such as penicillin, remain problematic. However, as their use reduces and newer drugs, such as cephalosporins, are used more frequently there is a changing pattern to occupational sensitization. In some studies up to 17% of healthcare workers now appear sensitized to cephalosporins. Other drug classes also reported include proton pump inhibitors and benzodiazepines. Interestingly, drugs such as omeprazole and tetrazepam rarely cause allergy in patients but can be very sensitizing if applied topically or inhaled. Recent studies involving pharmaceutical company employees show that this problem can no longer be considered primarily related to healthcare workers.", 
    "114": "The diagnosis of occupational allergy to drugs can be complicated and has been shown to take up to 5 years from the onset of symptoms. Ultimately, workplace avoidance remains key; however, an up to date awareness of culprit drugs and the patterns of allergy seen are key to a prompt resolution of symptoms.", 
    "115": "Clobazam, a 1,5-benzodiazepine FDA-approved in 2011, is commonly used to treat anxiety and epilepsy. It has not associated with hypothermia until very recently, in a case report involving two pediatric patients. Here, we report the first case of hypothermia development in an adult patient with epilepsy associated with clobazam use. A couple months after starting clobazam, the patient started developing episodes of hypothermia every several weeks, with temperatures ranging from 90\u00a0\u00b0F-95\u00a0\u00b0F. Normothermia was achieved with Bair Hugger therapy. Thyroid-stimulating hormone and cortisol levels were normal, and there was no evidence of infection in most instances. After 11 total episodes of hypothermia over a year of clobazam use, the drug was discontinued. It has now been 7\u00a0months after discontinuation, and the patient has not experienced any more episodes of hypothermia. Early recognition of the link between clobazam and hypothermia may prevent avoidable Emergency Department visits and hospitalizations.", 
    "116": "Rewarding memories induced by addictive drugs may contribute to persistent drug-seeking behaviors, which is an important contributing factor to drug addiction. However, the biological mechanisms underlying drug-associated rewarding memories have not yet been fully understood, especially the new synthetic drugs, such as amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS). In this study, using the rat-conditioned place preference (CPP) model, a classic animal model for the reward-associated effects of addictive drugs, we found that the expression level of GABAA \u03b11 subunits was significantly decreased in the dorsal striatum (Dstr) after conditioned methamphetamine (METH) pairing, and no significant differences were observed in the other four rewarding memory-associated areas (medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), amygdala (Amy), and dorsal hippocampus (DH)). Intra-Dstr injection of either the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol or the specific \u03b11GABAA receptor-preferring benzodiazepine (BDZ) agonist zolpidem significantly abolished METH CPP formation. Thus, this study extends previous findings by showing that GABAA receptors, particularly the \u03b11-containing GABAA receptors, may be strongly implicated in METH-associated rewarding memories. This work provides us with a new perspective on the goal of treating ATS addiction.", 
    "117": "Takayasu arteritis is a rare chronic progressive panendarteritis involving the aorta and its main branches. Anesthesia in patients with this disease can be complicated by severe uncontrolled hypertension, end-organ dysfunction, and stenosis of major blood vessels. In this case, general anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane and remifentanil without complications. To prevent intraoperative complications, we conducted intubation with a rigid video laryngoscope with careful consideration of the concentrations of analgesics and sedatives used. This case demonstrates the importance of anesthetic techniques for maintaining adequate tissue perfusion without hemodynamic changes in the anesthetic management of patients with Takayasu arteritis.", 
    "118": "Hyperventilation can be a manifestation of anxiety that involves abnormally fast breathing (tachypnea) and an elevated minute ventilation that exceeds metabolic demand. This report describes a case of hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia resulting in tetany in a 16-year-old girl undergoing orthodontic extractions under intravenous conscious sedation. Pulse oximetry is the gold standard respiratory-related index in conscious sedation. Although the parameter has great utility in determining oxygen desaturation, it provides no additional information on respiratory function, including, for example, respiratory rate. In this case, we found capnography to be a very useful aid to monitor respiration in this patient and also to treat the hypocapnia.", 
    "119": "In zebrafish developmentally exposed to ambient ethanol (20mM-50mM) 1-9 days post fertilization (dpf), the cortisol response to stress has been shown to be significantly attenuated in larvae, juveniles and 6 month old adults. These data are somewhat at variance with similar studies in mammals, which often show heightened stress responses. To test whether these cortisol data correlate with behavioural changes in treated animals, anxiety-like behaviour of zebrafish larvae (9dpf and 10dpf) and juveniles (23dpf) was tested in locomotor assays designed to this end. In open field tests treated animals were more exploratory, spending significantly less time at the periphery of the arena. Behavioural effects of developmental exposure to ethanol were sustained in 6-month-old adults, as judged by assessment of thigmotaxis, novel tank diving and scototaxis. Like larvae and juveniles, developmentally treated adults were generally more exploratory, and spent less time at the periphery of the arena in thigmotaxis tests, less time at the bottom of the tank in the novel tank diving tests, and less time in the dark area in scototaxis tests. The conclusion that ethanol-exposed animals showed less anxiety-like behaviour was validated by comparison with the effects of diazepam treatment, which in thigmotaxis and novel tank diving tests had similar effects to ethanol pretreatment. There is thus a possible link between the hypophyseal-pituitary-interrenal axis and the behavioural actions of developmental ethanol exposure. The mechanisms require further elucidation.",

There is no literature reported in the past concerning its acute toxicity in human beings. A case report is useful for workers in medical and veterinary field. Hence, we are reporting a case in which young male intoxicated with fipronil compound was presented to the emergency department for having generalized tonic-clonic seizures and subsequently with the features of delirium for few days. This patient was treated with benzodiazepines which controlled the seizures and antipsychotics were given for few days for treating the psychosis.",

The number of randomized controlled trials was limited, so many of these are retrospective analyses and case reports. Benzodiazepines remain the treatment of choice, with diazepam having the most favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Protocolized escalation of benzodiazepines as an alternative to a symptom-triggered approach may decrease the need for mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. Propofol is appropriate for patients refractory to benzodiazepines; however, the roles of phenobarbital, dexmedetomidine, and ketamine remain unclear.", 
    "125": "Severe alcohol withdrawal is not clearly defined, and limited data regarding management are available. Protocolized administration of benzodiazepines, in combination with phenobarbital, may reduce the need for mechanical ventilation and lead to shorter ICU stays. Propofol is a viable alternative for patients refractory to benzodiazepines; however, the role of other agents remains unclear. Randomized, prospective studies are needed to clearly define effective treatment strategies.",

Higher CNCP prevalence was related to female gender, no cohabitation partner, short education, non-Western origin, and overweight/obesity. In addition, women with CNCP, especially >65 years, became more frequent users of opioids and used higher doses than men. Concurrent use of BZD/BZD-related drugs decreased (13%) from 2010 to 2013, still one-third of long-term opioid user were co-medicated with these drugs.",

This report refers to patients treated for poisonings at the Toxicology Unit, Lodz, Poland, during the period 2008-2012. The data to be analyzed were obtained from medical records of elderly people. A group of 1167 patients aged 60+ was selected. The number of intentional poisonings in the group of patients was 417, which accounted for 35.7% of all poisonings among the elderly people. Patients attempting intentional poisonings included 301 (72.2%) women and 116 (27.8%) men. The most common cause of intentional poisonings were drugs-96.6% (n = 403). Benzodiazepines (46.9%) dominated among the intentional poisoning by drugs. During the analyzed 5 years, 80.3% (n = 335) were suicidal poisonings and 19.7% (n = 82) were demonstrative poisonings. Cardiovascular disease, which was diagnosed among 53.5% of the patients, was the most common physical illness. In conclusion, drugs are the most frequent type of the toxic agent responsible for poisoning cases among the elderly people. In this situation, the role of family doctors is very important: they should prescribe medicines in amounts not greater than absolutely necessary and maybe more often recommend psychiatric care for the elderly patients.",

Here, we investigated the potential for shortening the recovery phase after injection anaesthesia with fentanyl-midazolam-medetomidine by antagonization with naloxone-flumazenil-atipamezole. In order to monitor side-effects, the depth of anaesthesia, heart rate (HR), core body temperature (BT) and concentration of blood gases, as well as reflex responses, were assessed during a 50\u2009min anaesthesia. Mice were allowed to recover from the anaesthesia in their home cages either with or without antagonization, while HR, core BT and spontaneous home cage behaviours were recorded for 24\u2009h. Mice lost righting reflex at 330\u2009\u00b1\u200947\u2009s after intraperitoneal injection of fentanyl-midazolam-medetomidine. During anaesthesia, HR averaged 225\u2009\u00b1\u200923 beats/min, respiratory rate and core BT reached steady state at 131\u2009\u00b1\u200915 breaths/min and 34.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.25\u2103, respectively. Positive pedal withdrawal reflex, movement triggered by tail pinch and by toe pinch, still occurred in 25%, 31.2% and 100% of animals, respectively. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed acidosis, hypoxia, hypercapnia and a marked increase in glucose concentration. After anaesthesia reversal by injection with naloxone-flumazenil-atipamezole, animals regained consciousness after 110\u2009\u00b1\u200918\u2009s and swiftly returned to physiological baseline values, yet they displayed diminished levels of locomotion and disrupted circadian rhythm. Without antagonization, mice showed marked hypothermia (22\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9\u2103) and bradycardia (119\u2009\u00b1\u200969 beats/min) for several hours.

Furthermore, the provision of clinically important information may assume that perioperative memories are retained. Studies assessing the extent of perioperative amnesia and factors associated with perioperative amnesia are sparse. Therefore, we assessed patient amnesia of the OR and of the preoperative holding area in hospitals where midazolam is typically administered in the preoperative holding area and evaluated whether midazolam dose administered in the preoperative holding area and patient age were associated with amnesia of the OR before induction of anesthesia.",

The last location the patient remembered before induction of anesthesia and the first location they remembered after induction of anesthesia were determined through a modified Brice questionnaire administered over the phone 30 days postoperatively. Regarding the preoperative period, patients were excluded if their last memory was unclear with respect to location before induction of anesthesia or if they were recruited at Winnipeg, where midazolam was typically first administered in the OR. Midazolam dose (mg/kg) administered in the preoperative holding area was divided into quartiles. Poisson regression models were used to calculate age- and multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for the association between midazolam dose and amnesia of the OR before induction of anesthesia.",

If additional studies produce results indicating that a substantial proportion of patients has amnesia of the anesthesiologist, these findings would argue against the validity of assessing patient satisfaction with individual anesthesiologists providing exclusively OR care in such hospitals. Furthermore, if additional studies yield findings suggesting patient amnesia of the preoperative holding area, these results would suggest reconsideration of providing clinically important information only in the preoperative holding area.

    "154": "Synaptic GABAA receptors are primary mediators of rapid inhibition in the brain and play a key role in the pathophysiology of epilepsy and other neurologic disorders. The \u03b4-subunit GABAA receptors are expressed extrasynaptically in the dentate gyrus and contribute to tonic inhibition, promoting network shunting as well as reducing seizure susceptibility. However, the neurosteroid structure-function relationship at \u03b4GABA(A) receptors within the native hippocampus neurons remains unclear. Here we report a structure-activity relationship for neurosteroid modulation of extrasynaptic GABAA receptor-mediated tonic inhibition in the murine dentate gyrus granule cells. We recorded neurosteroid allosteric potentiation of GABA as well as direct activation of tonic currents using a wide array of natural and synthetic neurosteroids. Our results shows that, for all neurosteroids, the C3\u03b1-OH group remains obligatory for extrasynaptic receptor functional activity, as C3\u03b2-OH epimers were inactive in activating tonic currents. Allopregnanolone and related pregnane analogs exhibited the highest potency and maximal efficacy in promoting tonic currents. Alterations at the C17 or C20 region of the neurosteroid molecule drastically altered the transduction kinetics of tonic current activation. The androstane analogs had the weakest modulatory response among the analogs tested. Neurosteroid potentiation of tonic currents was completely (approximately 95%) diminished in granule cells from \u03b4-knockout mice, suggesting that \u03b4-subunit receptors are essential for neurosteroid activity. The neurosteroid sensitivity of \u03b4GABA(A) receptors was confirmed at the systems level using a 6-Hz seizure test. A consensus neurosteroid pharmacophore model at extrasynaptic \u03b4GABA(A) receptors is proposed based on a structure-activity relationship for activation of tonic current and seizure protection.",

Emerging evidence suggests that specific treatment of PTSD-related sleep disturbance improves other symptoms of the disorder, which in turn suggests that such disturbance may be fundamental to development and maintenance of the disorder. This mini-review focuses on pharmacological treatment of sleep disturbance in adult PTSD (specifically, studies testing the efficacy of antidepressants, adrenergic inhibiting agents, antipsychotics and benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics). We conclude that only prazosin, an adrenergic inhibiting agent, has had its efficacy established by multiple randomised controlled trials. There is also high-level evidence supporting use of eszopiclone, as well as risperidone and olanzapine as adjunct therapy. Antidepressants such as sertraline, venlafaxine and mirtazapine, benzodiazepines such as alprazolam and clonazepam and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics such as zolpidem appear ineffective in treating PTSD-related sleep disturbance. Most studies that report reduced frequency of nightmares and insomnia also report decreases in overall symptom severity. Such findings suggest that (i) sleep disruption is central to PTSD; (ii) treating sleep disruption may be an effective way to address other symptoms of the disorder and (iii) PTSD symptoms tend to cluster together in predictable ways.",

A number of the first-line drugs (benzodiazepine, azapirone, antidepressant tricyclics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors, noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, etc.) for the treatment of these psychiatric disorders are products of serendipitous discoveries. Inspite of the numerous classes of drugs that are available for the treatment of anxiety and depression, full remission has remained elusive. The emerging clinical cases have shown increasing interests among health practitioners and patients in phytomedicine. The development of anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs of plant origin takes advantage of multidisciplinary approach including but not limited to ethnopharmacological survey (careful investigation of folkloric application of medicinal plant), phytochemical and pharmacological studies. The selection of a suitable plant for a pharmacological study is a basic and very important step. Relevant clues to achieving this step include traditional use, chemical composition, toxicity, randomized selection or a combination of several criteria.

For physical capture (drop net or helicopter-net gunning) with local release, combinations of midazolam and azaperone administered immediately upon capture provide transient tranquilization and muscle relaxation during manual restraint and handling to prevent hyperthermia and capture myopathy. For extended tranquilization (during transport and overnight holding), adding a sustained-release haloperidol formulation provides calming effects for at least 24-48 h. In our assessment, appropriate and adaptive use of these tranquilizer combinations benefits captured animals without impeding management or research goals.", 
    "214": "Follow the case of Mrs J, an 86-year-old patient who presents to a psychiatrist requesting a benzodiazepine for her insomnia. Like many patients who are being treated for depression, Mrs J does not recognize the residual symptoms she is experiencing, but her psychiatrist uses several approaches including metrics and collateral information to identify her continuing symptoms. Once identified, pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment strategies are considered based on her symptoms and age.", 
    "215": "Epilepsy emergencies include acute repetitive seizures and status epilepticus. Their prognosis depends on the etiology of the seizures and the time spent in status epilepticus. This review discusses the current perspective on the diagnosis and treatment of status epilepticus and acute repetitive seizures in the intensive care unit.", 
    "216": "Current data on the treatment of status epilepticus emphasize early treatment over the choice of antiepileptic drug. The Rapid Anticonvulsant Medication Prior to Arrival Trial (RAMPART) data support the efficacy of prehospital treatment using faster routes of benzodiazepine administration. As additional antiepileptic drugs have become available in an IV formulation, their use in status epilepticus has increased, with little data to guide their administration. Recent publications have also stressed the changing epidemiology of status epilepticus in the United States, with a rise in incidence without much change in overall mortality. This rise is likely related to improved diagnostic capabilities with better availability and usage of continuous EEG in the intensive care unit and to the aging of the patient population.", 
    "217": "Acute repetitive seizures and status epilepticus are neurologic emergencies that are being increasingly diagnosed and treated in the modern era. Rapid treatment may influence patient prognosis, future cognitive outcomes, and the long-term potential for developing epilepsy. However, little is known about the mechanisms that perpetuate seizure activity, and our ability to intervene and prevent this condition remains limited. Preventing complications during the treatment of status epilepticus plays a large role in prognosis and the chance of treatment success.", 
    "218": "Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses affecting human beings. They range from panic to generalized anxiety disorders upsetting the well-being and psychosocial performance of patients. Several conventional anxiolytic drugs are being used which in turn results in several adverse effects. Therefore, studies to find suitable safe medicines from natural sources are being conducted by researchers. The aim of the present study is to comprehensively review phytochemical compounds with well-established anxiolytic activities and their structure-activity relationships as well as neuropsychopharmacological aspects. Results showed that phytochemicals like; alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolic acids, lignans, cinnamates, terpenes and saponins possess anxiolytic effects in a wide range of animal models of anxiety. The involved mechanisms include interaction with \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors at benzodiazepine (BZD) and non-BZD sites with various affinity to different subunits, serotonergic 5-hydrodytryptamine (5-HT)1A and 5-HT2A/C receptors, noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems, glycine and glutamate receptors, and \u03ba-opioid receptor as well as cannabinoid (CB)1 and CB2 receptors. Phytochemicals also modulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and improve brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V (TRPV)3, nitric oxide cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NOcGMP) pathway and monoamine oxidase enzymes are other targets of phytochemicals with anxiolytic activity. Taking together, these phytochemicals may be considered as supplements to conventional anxiolytic therapies in order to improve efficacy and reduce adverse effects. Further preclinical and clinical studies are still needed in order to recognize the structure-activity relationships, metabolism, absorption, and neuropsychopharmacological mechanisms of plantderived natural agents.", 
    "219": "To assess the efficacy, comparative effectiveness, and harms of treatments for insomnia disorder in the general adult population and older adults.", 
    "220": "Ovid MEDLINE(\u00ae), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase(\u00ae), and PsycINFO(\u00ae) bibliographic databases; hand searches of references of relevant studies.", 
    "221": "Two investigators screened abstracts and full-text articles of identified references for eligibility. Eligible studies included systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and long-term observational pharmacologic studies enrolling participants with insomnia disorder. We analyzed data for global outcomes (measures that assess both sleep and daytime functioning associated with sleep), sleep parameters, and harms. We assessed risk of bias for RCTs, extracted data, assessed quality of relevant systematic reviews, and evaluated strength of evidence for comparisons and outcomes. Pooled estimates were analyzed to assess the efficacy and comparative effectiveness of treatments.", 
    "222": "We searched bibliographic databases through January 2015 for studies evaluating psychological, pharmacologic, and complementary and alternative medicine interventions for insomnia disorder. We synthesized evidence from 181 unique studies (data from 128 unique RCTs and 3 systematic reviews that synthesize data from 42 unique RCTs) and 12 observational studies. Sample sizes and enrollment criteria varied; most trials were short in duration. Outcome reporting and intervention effect sizes varied, and a large placebo response was often observed. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) improved global outcomes and nearly all sleep parameters in the general adult population, older adults, and adults with pain. We found insufficient evidence on adverse effects of these interventions. Evidence was less robust for psychological interventions other than CBT-I, but low-strength evidence shows that some interventions improve some sleep outcomes. Low- to moderate-strength evidence indicated that the nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics eszopiclone and zolpidem, and the orexin receptor antagonist suvorexant, improved short-term global and sleep outcomes in general adult populations. Doxepin improved sleep outcomes. The absolute mean effect was small. Evidence for benzodiazepine hypnotics, melatonin agonists, and antidepressants in general populations and for most pharmacologic interventions in older adults was generally insufficient. Evidence on adverse effects from RCT data was generally insufficient or low strength. Observational studies suggest that hypnotics may be associated with dementia, fractures, and major injury. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labels warn about cognitive and behavioral changes, including driving impairment, and other harms, and advise lower doses for females and older/debilitated adults. Evidence on complementary and alternative medicine was insufficient. Evidence was insufficient to compare hypnotic medications within or across classes or versus CBT-I.", 
    "223": "CBT-I or medical therapy with eszopiclone, zolpidem, and suvorexant improve global and sleep outcomes for insomnia disorder. Clinical significance, applicability, comparative effectiveness, and long-term efficacy, especially among older adults, are less well known. Effect sizes vary, and a large placebo response is sometimes observed. Observational studies suggest an association of hypnotics with infrequent but serious harms. FDA labels provide specific warnings and precautions for drugs approved for insomnia.", 
    "224": "This study aimed to describe the pharmacokinetics of midazolam and its cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) mediated metabolite 1-OH-midazolam in morbidly obese patients receiving oral and i.v. midazolam before (n\u2009=\u200920) and one year after weight loss surgery (n\u2009=\u200918), thereby providing insight into the influence of weight loss surgery on CYP3A activity in the gut wall and liver. In a semiphysiologically based pharmacokinetic (semi-PBPK) model in which different blood flow scenarios were evaluated, intrinsic hepatic clearance of midazolam (CLint,H) was 2 (95% CI 1.40-1.64) times higher compared to morbidly obese patients before surgery (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Midazolam gut wall clearance (CLint,G) was slightly lower in patients after surgery (P\u2009>\u20090.05), with low values for both groups. The results of the semi-PBPK model suggest that, in patients after weight loss surgery, CYP3A hepatic metabolizing capacity seems to recover compared to morbidly obese patients, whereas CYP3A mediated CLint,G was low for both populations and showed large interindividual variability.", 
    "225": "In treatment-resistant schizophrenia, clozapine is considered the standard treatment. However, clozapine use has restrictions owing to its many adverse effects. Moreover, an increasing number of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of other antipsychotics have been published.", 
    "226": "To integrate all the randomized evidence from the available antipsychotics used for treatment-resistant schizophrenia by performing a network meta-analysis.", 
    "227": "MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, PsycINFO, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, World Health Organization International Trial Registry, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched up to June 30, 2014.", 
    "228": "At least 2 independent reviewers selected published and unpublished single- and double-blind RCTs in treatment-resistant schizophrenia (any study-defined criterion) that compared any antipsychotic (at any dose and in any form of administration) with another antipsychotic or placebo.", 
    "229": "At least 2 independent reviewers extracted all data into standard forms and assessed the quality of all included trials with the Cochrane Collaboration's risk-of-bias tool. Data were pooled using a random-effects model in a Bayesian setting.", 
    "230": "The primary outcome was efficacy as measured by overall change in symptoms of schizophrenia. Secondary outcomes included change in positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, categorical response to treatment, dropouts for any reason and for inefficacy of treatment, and important adverse events.", 
    "231": "Forty blinded RCTs with 5172 unique participants (71.5% men; mean [SD] age, 38.8 [3.7] years) were included in the analysis. Few significant differences were found in all outcomes. In the primary outcome (reported as standardized mean difference; 95% credible interval), olanzapine was more effective than quetiapine (-0.29; -0.56 to -0.02), haloperidol (-0. 29; -0.44 to -0.13), and sertindole (-0.46; -0.80 to -0.06); clozapine was more effective than haloperidol (-0.22; -0.38 to -0.07) and sertindole (-0.40; -0.74 to -0.04); and risperidone was more effective than sertindole (-0.32; -0.63 to -0.01). A pattern of superiority for olanzapine, clozapine, and risperidone was seen in other efficacy outcomes, but results were not consistent and effect sizes were usually small. In addition, relatively few RCTs were available for antipsychotics other than clozapine, haloperidol, olanzapine, and risperidone. The most surprising finding was that clozapine was not significantly better than most other drugs.", 
    "232": "Insufficient evidence exists on which antipsychotic is more efficacious for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and blinded RCTs-in contrast to unblinded, randomized effectiveness studies-provide little evidence of the superiority of clozapine compared with other second-generation antipsychotics. Future clozapine studies with high doses and patients with extremely treatment-refractory schizophrenia might be most promising to change the current evidence.", 
    "233": "We report a retrospective case study of the use of clomethiazole for treatment of non-convulsive status epilepticus in a patient not responding to benzodiazepines, illustrated by EEG and video. Clomethiazole can be considered as a safe oral option for management of non-convulsive status epilepticus when conventional treatment has failed. [Published with video sequences online].", 
    "234": "Catamenial epilepsy (CE) is a commonly observed phenomenon among women with epilepsy, the management of which is both hormonal and non-hormonal. Progesterone therapy has been tried in these patients, as the possible mechanism of CE is withdrawal of progesterone and a higher oestrogen/progesterone ratio in the perimenstrual and periovulatory periods. Here, we describe a 24-year-old lady with multiple seizure types since childhood, which were refractory to adequate antiepileptic drug therapy after menarche with catamenial clustering of seizures. She went on to have several episodes of non-convulsive status epilepticus also with similar periodicity, which would abate only with midazolam infusion, without the need for ventilatory support. She was tried on acetazolamide, progesterone vaginal pessaries, and maximum tolerated doses of antiepileptic medications, but finally responded to intramuscular and oral progesterone, and has been seizure-free for more than a year.", 
    "235": "Status epilepticus and seizure clusters are common neurological emergencies. The purpose of this monocentric, retrospective cohort study was to comparatively assess different antiepileptic approaches in the treatment of status epilepticus and seizure clusters, which were nonresponsive to benzodiazepines.", 
    "236": "We reviewed medical records of 66 patients, who were treated for status epilepticus or seizure clusters in the Department of Neurology at the University of the Saarland between January 2007 and July 2012, and failed to respond to benzodiazepines with the equivalent dosage of at least 20 mg of diazepam. As endpoints, we analyzed both the effectiveness of lacosamide, levetiracetam, valproic acid, and phenytoin used as second- and third-line therapy, and the Glasgow Outcome Scale at day 7.", 
    "237": "Sixty-one (92.4%) of the patients had status epilepticus, and 5 (7.6%) had seizure clusters. The compared drugs were equally effective in terminating seizures. There was also no significant difference in the Glasgow Outcome Scale (P = 0.60) after 7 days.", 
    "238": "Our data support the use of the modern antiepileptic treatment strategies, such as levetiracetam, valproic acid, and lacosamide in the treatment of status epilepticus and seizure clusters."
