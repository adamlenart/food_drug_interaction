The induction was also studied at the molecular level by quantitation of mRNA and protein levels, by Northern blotting and Western blotting, respectively. Pretreatment with rifampin (50 microM) resulted in a 5.5- to 9-fold higher rate of midazolam metabolism when compared with control cultures. No induction was observed when the cultures were pretreated with 50 microM dexamethasone. A 12-fold increase in the CYP3A mRNA signal (approximately 2.4 kB) was observed in induced cultures over control cultures. Microsomal proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody raised against human CYP3A4. The immunoblots showed the presence of four bands in microsomes prepared from pig livers, with two bands (51.5 and 52 kD) that showed intense staining. Microsomes prepared from a pig pretreated with rifampin showed marked induction of these two bands. Immunoblotting of microsomes from rifampin-induced cultures also showed significantly greater intensity than in control cultures. Our results indicate that rifampin, but not dexamethasone, is an inducer of midazolam hydroxylase in pig hepatocytes. This induction may be regulated at the transcriptional level as detected by an increase in mRNA with a CYP3A oligonucleotide probe. Finally, there appears to be a multiplicity of the CYP3A isoforms in pig hepatocytes, similar to that observed in humans and rats.", 
    "1": "GABA(A) receptor function was studied in cerebral cortical vesicles prepared from rats after intracerebroventricular microinjections of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (aODNs) for alpha1, gamma2, beta1, beta2 subunits. GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit aODNs decreased alpha1 subunit mRNA by 59+/-10%. Specific [3H]GABA binding was decreased by alpha1 or beta2 subunit aODNs (to 63+/-3% and 64+/-9%, respectively) but not changed by gamma2 subunit aODNs (94+/-5%). Specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding was increased by alpha1 or beta2 subunit aODNs (122+/-8% and 126+/-11%, respectively) and decreased by gamma2 subunit aODNs (50+/-13%). The \"knockdown\" of specific subunits of the GABA(A )receptor significantly influenced GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx. Injection of alpha1 subunit aODNs decreased basal 36Cl- influx and the GABA Emax; enhanced GABA modulation by diazepam; and decreased antagonism of GABA activity by bicuculline. Injection of gamma2 subunit aODNs increased the GABA Emax; reversed the modulatory efficacy of diazepam from enhancement to inhibition of GABA-stimulation; and reduced the antagonist effect of bicuculline. Injection of beta2 subunit aODNs reduced the effect of diazepam whereas treatment with beta1 subunit aODNs had no effect on the drugs studied. Conclusions from our studies are: (1) alpha1 subunits promote, beta2 subunits maintain, and gamma2 subunits suppress GABA stimulation of 36Cl- influx; (2) alpha1 subunits suppress, whereas beta2, and gamma2 subunits promote allosteric modulation by benzodiazepines; (3) diazepam can act as an agonist or inverse agonist depending on the relative composition of the receptor subunits: and (4) the mixed competitive/non-competitive effects of bicuculline result from activity at alpha1 and gamma2 subunits and the lack of activity at beta1 and beta2 subunits.", 
    "2": "These are the first clinical guidelines published for the treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and Periodic Limb Movement Disorder (PLMD) providing evidence-based practice parameters. They were developed by the Standards of Practice Committee and reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The guidelines provide recommendations for the practice of sleep medicine in North America regarding the treatment of RLS and PLMD. Recommendations are based on the accompanying comprehensive review of the medical literature regarding treatment of RLS and PLMD which was developed by a task force commissioned by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Recommendations are identified as standards, guidelines, or options, based on the strength of evidence from published studies that meet criteria for inclusion. Dopaminergic agents are the best studied and most successful agents for treatment of RLS and PLMD. Specific recommendations are also given for the use of opioid, benzodiazepine, anticonvulsant, and adrenergic medications, and for iron supplementation. In general, pharmacological treatment should be limited to individuals who meet diagnostic criteria and especially who experience insomnia and/or excessive sleepiness that is thought to occur secondary to RLS or PLMD. Individuals treated with medication should be followed by a physician and monitored for clinical response and adverse effects. It would be desirable for future investigations to employ multicenter clinical trials, with expanded numbers of subjects using double-blind, placebo-controlled designs, and an assessment of long-term response, side effects, and impact of treatment on quality of life. Evaluation of special groups such as children, pregnant women, and the elderly is warranted.",

    "6": "Little is known about the changes in pancreatic enzyme storage in acute pancreatitis. We have performed flow cytometric studies of zymogen granules from rats with acute pancreatitis induced by hyperstimulation with caerulein. A comparison was made with rats treated with hydrocortisone (10 mg/kg/day) over 7 days before inducing pancreatitis in order to find out whether the amount of enzymes stored in the pancreas plays a key role in the development of pancreatitis. The potentially therapeutic effect of L-364,718 (0.1 mg/kg/day, for 7 days), a CCK receptor antagonist, was assayed in the rats with caerulein-induced pancreatitis which had previously received the hydrocortisone treatment. A significant increase in the intragranular enzyme content was observed 5 h after hyperstimulation with caerulein. The highest values were reached in the rats previously treated with hydrocortisone. The greatest pancreatic enzyme load was parallel to the highest values in plasma amylase, edema and haematocrit observed. Acute pancreatitis was reversed seven days later. At this stage smaller granules appeared in the pancreas whose enzyme content was similar to that of controls when no treatment was applied after pancreatitis. In contrast, L-364,718 administration prevented the favourable evolution of pancreatitis since the antagonism exerted on CCK receptors induced a blockade of secretion of the large amounts of enzymes stored in the pancreas. Moreover, the enzyme content in zymogen granules was below normal values since the stimulatory CCK action on enzyme synthesis can be inhibited by L-364,718. Our results suggest that the efficiency of CCK antagonists, as potential therapy, would also depend on the load of enzymes in the pancreas when acute pancreatitis is produced.", 
    "7": "Long distance flights with rapid time zone shifts of more than 3 hours lead to a dissociation of the inner circadian clock to the outer pacer. Additionally, the different endogenous circadian rhythms will not longer be synchronized by the endogenous pacer melatonin. This leads to complaints like sleepiness, sleep-disturbances and others. These symptoms are called jet-lag. The subject's performance is disturbed, as well. Different studies showed smaller problems with jet lag when travelling to the west. Since the inner circadian rhythm tends to be 24 up to 26 hours, travelling to the west with a prolongation of the daylight will be tolerated better than flights to the east with a shortening of the day length. Rapid time zone shifts with more than 8 hours to the east lead to individual different ways of resynchronization. Subject either try to adapt to the new time zone by shortening the day (backward adaptation) or they resynchronize forward with a longer duration of adaptation time. Elder subjects with already diminished circadian hormonal rhythm often get more problems concerning symptoms of the jet-lag and in time to recover from the disturbance of the inner clock. No differences can be found between business travelers, tourists and high-performance sportsmen. After flights to the west within 3 to 7 days, most of our inner circadian rhythm will be re-synchronized. After flights to the east, resynchronization can take 5 to 14 days. A symptomatic therapy of jet lag symptoms with a short-acting benzodiazepine like triazolam in a dosage of 12.5 mg or less is well tolerated. A therapy with oral melatonin in a dosage of 0.5 to 5 mg/day given in the evening 1 to 2 hours prior to the desired sleeping-time may be helpful for a group of subjects. Another group of subjects will not have any benefit of a therapy with melatonin, but cannot be defined in advance. A recommendation for a therapy with melatonin to treat jet lag symptoms cannot be given at the moment, since scientific data are still missing. Additionally, the same contaminants, which caused some deaths, as in the related substance tryptophan has been found in some tablets of melatonin.", 
    "8": "The mass spectrometric behaviour of four 1a,3-disubstituted 4-benzoyl-1a,2,3,4-tetrahydrooxazirino[2,3-a][1,5]benzodiazepines has been studied with the aid of mass-analyzed ion kinetic energy spectrometry and accurate mass measurements under electron impact ionization. All compounds show a tendency to eliminate a neutral oxygen atom, or oxygen atom plus benzoyl or aryl radicals, or oxygen atom plus CO molecule to yield 2,3-dihydro-1H-1,5-benzodiazepine derivative ions, or 1-benzoyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-1,5-benzodiazepine ions, which could further lose benzoyl to give 2,3-dihydro-1H-1,5-benzodiazepine ions. All compounds also show a tendency to eliminate a benzoyl radical to produce 1a,2,3,4-tetrahydrooxazirino[2,3-a][1,5]benzodiazepine ions. Both oxazirino[2,3-a][1,5]benzodiazepine ions and 2,3-dihydro-1H-1,5-benzodiazepine ions can undergo diazepine ring contraction rearrangement to yield benzimidazole ions by loss of propene or styrenes and other small fragments. The oxazirino[2,3-a][1,5]benzodiazepine ions [M(+)-PhCO] also undergo rearrangement reactions to form benzoxazole ions and benzimidazole ions. Copyright 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "10": "The aim of this study was to investigate the activity of the parasympathetic limb of the baroreflex arch in a canine model of obesity-related hypertension. Twelve male beagle dogs were randomized into 2 groups. Six dogs were fed with normal canine food and 6 were submitted to a 10-week high-fat diet (HFD). We have evaluated the consequences of HFD on heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) circadian cycles and methylscopolamine dose-response curves. Binding of [(3)H]-AF-DX 384 and adenylyl cyclase activity were investigated to determine the density and functionality of M(2)-cholinoceptors on right atrial membranes from control and HFD dogs. HFD induced a significant increase in body weight (15+/-1 vs 12+/-1 kg), systolic BP (161+/-5 vs 145+/-4 mm Hg), diastolic BP (92+/-3 vs 79+/-2 mm Hg), and HR (96+/-4 vs 81+/-3 bpm). Circadian rhythms of HR and BP observed in the baseline period were abolished after 9 weeks of HFD. After propranolol (1 mg/kg) pretreatment, the dose of methylscopolamine able to induce 50% maximum tachycardia was significantly increased after 9 weeks of HFD (7.4+/-0.3 vs 4.7+/-0.1 microg/kg). In the control group, the experimental period failed to modify these parameters. The numbers of M(2)-cholinoceptors measured in right atrial membranes were significantly lower in HFD than in control groups (54+/-6 vs 27+/-6 fmol/mg protein). The ability of carbachol to inhibit isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was significantly lower in HFD than in control groups (IC(50)=47+/-12 vs 6.4+/-1.4 micromol/L). However, the basal activity of adenylyl cyclase was unchanged by HFD. HFD decreases M(2)-cholinoceptor number and function in cardiomyocytes. This could explain the abolition of circadian rhythm of HR and the changes in chronotropic effect brought about by methylscopolamine.", 
    "11": "The neuroprotective activity of the non-competitive alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) antagonist GYKI-52466 (1-[4-aminophenyl]-4-methyl-7,8-methylene-dioxy-5H-2,3-benzodia zep ine HCI; EGIS-8159) was studied in the gerbil bilateral carotid occlusion (BCO) model of global ischemia. Drug effect on hippocampal CA1 neuronal loss, hypermotility, and cognitive deficit (decrease in spontaneous alternation (SA) behaviour in the Y-maze) induced by 5-min or 3-min BCO were measured. GYKI-52466 was administered at 4 x 15 mg/kg intraperitoneal (i.p.) doses 30, 45, 60, and 75 min following surgery. The competitive AMPA antagonist NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(F)-quinoxaline) applied at 3 x 30 mg/kg i.p. doses 60, 70, and 85 min after reperfusion was also tested for comparison. Both compounds showed weak and non-significant effects on 5-min BCO-induced changes in all the three variables. However, following 3-min ischemia GYKI-52466 and NBQX produced significant inhibition (49% and 48%, respectively) on CA1 cell loss. Moreover, GYKI-52466, but not NBQX, significantly inhibited the 3-min ischemia induced hypermotility and decrease in SA. At their neuroprotective doses, both compounds caused long-lasting (min. 8 h) hypothermia in gerbils. GYKI-52466 induced much higher decrease in body temperature (6 degrees C at peak level) than NBQX did (2 degrees C at peak level). Administration of 4 x 10 mg/kg i.p. chlorpromazine to gerbils 15 min before and 0, 15, and 30 min after 3-min BCO resulted in considerable hypothermia (5.5 degrees C peak effect, 8 h duration), but no protective action of the compound on CA1 cell loss and hypermotility was observed. However, chlorpromazine inhibited the ischemia-induced cognitive impairment. The results suggest that drug-induced hypothermia may differentially influence the histological and the behavioural outcomes of ischemic intervention.",

    "16": "Drug interactions are a major cause of drug-related problems. This study assessed the comparative frequency of potential drug-drug interactions in patients receiving either omeprazole or lansoprazole. We reviewed prescription data from 144 community pharmacies in 25 states for the period of October 12, 1996, through October 20, 1997, from which the rates at which patients received either proton-pump inhibitor concurrently with > or =1 potentially interacting drugs were determined. A total of 7306 patients received only omeprazole, and 2486 received only lansoprazole. In this sample, 722 patients (9.9%) who received omeprazole also received a potentially interacting medication at the same time, compared with 8 patients (0.3%) who received lansoprazole (P<0.001). These data suggest that clinicians should be conscientious when selecting or dispensing drugs for patients taking omeprazole, given the relatively high prevalence of potential drug interactions in clinical practice.", 
    "17": "POORLY DEFINED USE: The first of three leading problems in the use of psychotropic drugs in elderly subjects is related to the overall situation of their use, often tainted by an \u00ecideological\u00ee point of view. Prescribers are \u00ecfor\u00ee or \u00ecagainst\u00ee psychotropic and justify their prescription by the need to take into account the general situation rather than strictly clinical arguments. Some prescriptions are written for the family or institutions. Even the definition of the elderly subject is extremely vague and is generally taken to include subjects over 65, a very heterogeneous group. Too few studies have been devoted to subjects over 80. NEED FOR GOOD CLINICAL ANALYSIS: The second type of problem is raised by the clinical expression of psychotic disorders in the elderly, too often considered to be limited to the classical signs of depression, dementia, and confusion. A careful clinical analysis is essential before prescription, with an adapted therapeutic response to each pathological situation. In addition, good clinical analysis would allow better diagnosis of depression, a condition largely underestimated and undertreated. BY THERAPEUTIC CLASS: It is now classical to denounce inappropriate use of neuroleptics and question their efficacy in controlling behavioral disorders in dementia. This attitude results from the impact of the adverse effects. Several authors have emphasized the contribution of new antipsychotic drugs but very few controlled studies have been reported. For antidepressors, the current consensus would suggest that prescription doses are generally insufficient and treatment durations too short. Finally, though it is widely accepted that use of benzodiazepines should be limited in dose and duration, data on drug use however show the contrary, emphasizing the difficulty in changing habits. New compounds including thymoregulators are increasingly used for elderly subjects but here again, like for antipsychotic drugs, too few studies have been published and many points remain to be elucidated.", 
    "18": "Novel neuroactive steroids were evaluated for their effects on operant responding, rotorod motor performance, and electroencephalogram recording in rats. Co 134444, Co 177843, and Co 127501 were compared with the prototypical gamma-aminobutyric acid(A)-positive allosteric modulators triazolam, zolpidem, pentobarbital, pregnanolone, and CCD 3693. Each of the compounds produced a dose-related decrease in response rates under a variable-interval 2-min schedule of positive reinforcement in an operant paradigm. In addition, all compounds produced a dose-related increase in ataxia and significant increases in nonrapid eye movement sleep in this experiment or have been previously reported to do so. Co 134444, Co 177843, and Co 127501 increased nonrapid eye movement sleep at doses that had no effect on rapid eye movement sleep. All of the compounds were more potent at decreasing operant responding than they were at increasing ataxia. Furthermore, the potency of compounds to produce response-rate suppression in an operant paradigm appeared to be a better predictor of soporific potency than did potency in the rotorod assay. The screening for sedative-hypnotic activity resulted in the identification of the novel orally active neuroactive steroids Co 134444, Co 177843, and Co 127501.", 
    "19": "In this study we assessed the discriminative stimulus, self-reported, and performance effects of flumazenil in humans. The first group (n = 6) was trained to discriminate flumazenil (0.56 mg/70 kg i.v.) from saline and tested with flumazenil (0.10, 0.32, 0.56, and 1.0 mg/70 kg) under a two-response drug discrimination procedure. The second group (n = 8) was trained to discriminate flumazenil (0.56 mg/70 kg i.v.) from saline and tested with flumazenil (0.32, 0.56, and 1.0 mg/70 kg), midazolam (0.10, 0.56, and 1.0 mg/70 kg), and caffeine (75 mg/70 kg) under a novel-response drug discrimination procedure. In both groups, flumazenil was acquired and maintained as a discriminative stimulus. Flumazenil dose-dependently increased flumazenil-appropriate responding and ratings of strength of drug effect and sedation, and decreased ratings of stimulant effects and psychomotor performance. Under the novel-response procedure, midazolam produced dose-dependent increases in flumazenil-appropriate responding. However, midazolam produced 43 and 25% novel responding at the intermediate and highest test doses, respectively. Midazolam dose-dependently increased ratings of strength of drug effect and sedation, and decreased ratings of stimulant effects and psychomotor performance. The magnitude of effects on ratings of strength of drug effect and sedation were comparable after flumazenil and midazolam, but psychomotor performance effects were greater after midazolam than after flumazenil. Caffeine produced mostly saline-appropriate responding. The results indicate that flumazenil has agonist effects similar to those of midazolam; however, novel responding after midazolam, and the greater performance decrement after midazolam, suggest that flumazenil does not act as a traditional benzodiazepine agonist.", 
    "20": "The present study examined whether zolpidem, an imidazopyridine with selectivity for benzodiazepine (BZ)/gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors containing the alpha1-subunit, had discriminative stimulus effects similar to typical BZs and other sedative/hypnotic drugs in primates. Squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) were trained to discriminate zolpidem (1.0 mg/kg i.v.) from vehicle under a 10-response fixed-ratio schedule of food delivery. Under test conditions, zolpidem (0.1-3.0 mg/kg) increased responding on the drug lever to an average maximum of 90% of total responding. When pretreatment times were varied from 5 to 50 min, the discriminative stimulus effects of zolpidem were maximal at 5 min and near control levels 35 min after administration. Flumazenil antagonized both the discriminative stimulus and rate-decreasing effects of zolpidem in a dose-dependent and surmountable fashion (in vivo apparent pA(2) values of 7.3 and 6.6 for the discriminative stimulus and rate-suppressing effects, respectively). The BZs triazolam, midazolam, diazepam, and N-desmethyldiazepam engendered dose-related increases in drug-lever responding that reached zolpidem-like levels (90%) in the majority of monkeys tested. In contrast, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and oxazepam engendered average maximums of 70% or less and substituted fully for zolpidem in one or two monkeys only. Representative barbiturates as well as drugs that bind to non-BZ sites (muscimol, baclofen, buspirone, cyproheptadine, diphenhydramine) engendered 0 to 45% of responses on the drug lever up to doses that markedly reduced response rate. These results support the view that zolpidem's selectivity for the alpha1-subunit of the BZ/gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptor complex confers a distinctive profile of interoceptive effects that overlaps partially with those of typical BZs but not with those of barbiturates.", 
    "21": "Benzodiazepines, a class of drugs commonly used to induce anesthesia and sedation, can attenuate intracellular calcium oscillations evoked by alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor (alpha(1)-AR) stimulation in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. We postulated a direct action of benzodiazepines in modulating alpha(1)-AR function at the receptor level. Benzodiazepines bound to each of the cloned alpha(1)-AR subtypes (alpha(1a)-, alpha(1b)-, or alpha(1d)-AR) on COS-1 cell membranes transiently transfected to express a single population of alpha(1)-AR subtype. The ability of benzodiazepines to alter alpha(1)-AR signal transduction was investigated by measuring total inositol phosphate generation in rat-1 fibroblast cells, stably transfected to express a single alpha(1)-AR subtype. By themselves, benzodiazepines displayed partial agonism. At alpha(1b)-ARs and alpha(1d)-ARs, the maximal inositol phosphate response to phenylephrine was potentiated almost 2-fold by either midazolam or lorazepam (100 microM). At alpha(1a)-ARs, diazepam, lorazepam, and midazolam all increased the maximal response of the partial agonist clonidine at these receptors, whereas the response to the full agonist phenylephrine was unaltered or inhibited. The potentiating actions of midazolam and its partial agonism at alpha(1)-ARs was blocked by the addition of 1 microM prazosin, an alpha(1)-AR antagonist, and not by a gamma-aminobutyric acid(A)-receptor antagonist. These studies show that benzodiazepines modulate the function of alpha(1)-ARs in vitro, and this is the first report of a potential allosteric site on alpha(1)-ARs that may be therapeutically useful for drug design.", 
    "22": "Patients with any of the acute porphyrias may suffer from acute attacks. If these patients are treated with certain drugs, such as barbiturates, the likelihood of developing an attack is increased. Patients treated with antidepressants or benzodiazepine-type anxiolytics also could be placed at increased risk of developing porphyric attacks because little is known about the potential for some of these drugs to induce attacks. Primary cultures of chick embryo liver cells were used to study the effects of selected antidepressants and anxiolytics on porphyrin accumulation. Cells were treated with desferrioxamine (to partially block heme synthesis, simulating conditions encountered in porphyric patients) and increasing concentrations (3.16-1000 microM) of the evaluated drugs. Twenty hours later, porphyrin accumulation was measured. The drugs included four antidepressants and five benzodiazepine-type anxiolytics. The antidepressants bupropion and nefazodone significantly increased porphyrin accumulation when given with desferrioxamine, whereas neither fluoxetine nor paroxetine increased porphyrin accumulation. The benzodiazepine-type anxiolytic agents oxazepam, lorazepam, diazepam, triazolam, and midazolam all significantly increased porphyrin accumulation when given with desferrioxamine. Dose-response studies showed that diazepam, midazolam, and triazolam produced significant increases even at the lowest concentration tested (3.16 microM), whereas lorazepam and oxazepam required higher concentrations (>/=10 microM). These studies suggest that patients with acute porphyrias may be at greater risk for developing porphyric attacks when treated with bupropion or nefazodone compared with fluoxetine or paroxetine, and that the evaluated benzodiazepine derivatives should be administered with caution. Among the latter, low doses of lorazepam and oxazepam may be safer than those of diazepam, midazolam, and triazolam.", 
    "23": "It is not clear whether dopamine D(3) receptor contributes to the regional difference in dopamine antagonist-induced increase in the evoked dopamine release from the nucleus accumbens and striatum. We investigated the regional differences in augmentation of electrically evoked dopamine release induced by preferential dopamine D(2) or D(3) receptor antagonists from slices of the rat striatum and nucleus accumbens. Haloperidol, a preferential dopamine D(2) receptor antagonist, enhanced the evoked dopamine release from both the striatum and nucleus accumbens. Preferential dopamine D(3) antagonists, cis-(+)-(1S, 2R)-5-methoxy-1-methyl-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin HCl [(+)-UH232] and 5,6-dimethoxy-2-(di-n-propylamine)indan (U-99194A) resulted in a greater increase in the evoked dopamine released from the nucleus accumbens compared with that from the striatum. Moreover, U-99194A attenuated the quinpirole-induced reduction of evoked dopamine release from the nucleus accumbens but not from the striatum. When slices were superfused with pirenzepine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, the increase in the evoked dopamine release by (+)-UH232 or U-99194A was reduced in the nucleus accumbens to the same level as that in the striatum. Our results indicate that the preferential D(3) receptor antagonists-induced increase in evoked dopamine release is probably mediated by the cholinergic system in the nucleus accumbens, which contains more postsynaptic dopamine D(3) receptors than the striatum.", 
    "24": "One week oral flurazepam (FZP) administration in rats results in anticonvulsant tolerance in vivo, tolerance measured in vitro in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, and regulation of hippocampal gamma-aminobutyric acid(A)-receptor subunit protein expression. A single injection (4 or 20 mg/kg i.p) of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (FLM) was given 1 day after FZP treatment, and tolerance and subunit protein expression were evaluated 1 day later. In vivo tolerance was measured by a reduced ability of the alpha(1)-subunit-selective agonist zolpidem to suppress pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures. This tolerance was reversed by 20 but not 4 mg/kg FLM. In in vitro hippocampal slices, there was tolerance to the effect of zolpidem to prolong the decay of pyramidal cell miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents, which was reversed by FLM (4 mg/kg) pretreatment. A reduction in miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current amplitude ( approximately 50%) was also restored by FLM injection. [(3)H]Zolpidem binding measured 0, 2, and 7 days after FZP treatment was significantly decreased in the hippocampus and cortex at 0 days but not thereafter. Changes in alpha(1)- and beta(3)-subunit protein expression were examined via quantitative immunohistochemical techniques. alpha(1)-Subunit protein levels were down-regulated in the CA1 stratum oriens and beta subunit levels were up-regulated in the stratum oriens and stratum radiatum of the CA3 region. Chronic FZP effects on alpha(1)- and beta(3)-subunit protein levels were also reversed by prior FLM injection. FLM's effect on both functional and structural correlates of benzodiazepine tolerance suggests that each of these measures plays an interdependent role in mediating benzodiazepine tolerance.",

The SSRIs are particularly attractive due to their favourable tolerance and safety profile. An open label trial of fluvoxamine was conducted to evaluate its efficacy and safety in the treatment of social phobia (DSM-III-R) and to assess physiological changes that may accompany treatment. Fifteen non-depressed patients, aged 22-44 years (mean 31.6 years), entered the study. A 5-min performance task (public speaking simulation) preceded and concluded the active treatment period. Cardiovascular monitoring was performed during this time and blood sampled for plasma cortisol and steady-state plasma fluvoxamine concentration (at week 7). Ten patients (5 men and 5 women) completed an active 6 week treatment period of flexible dosing (50-150 mg/day). Five patients failed to complete the study due to drowsiness (n = 2), nausea (n = 1), or were lost to follow-up (n = 2). Analysis of clinical ratings indicated a statistically significant decrease in all scales from baseline to week 7 at the conclusion of the active treatment period. Clinical benefits were still evident at follow-up 1 week after drug discontinuation. Neither physiological effects nor plasma drug concentration correlated with clinical change. Fluvoxamine appeared to be effective and well tolerated in completers. Randomized clinical trials are needed to further demonstrate the efficacy of fluvoxamine in the treatment of social phobia.",

In this study, 30 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for mania were randomly allocated to receive either olanzapine or lithium in a 4 week double-blind randomized controlled design. There were no significant outcome differences between the two groups on any of the primary outcome measures, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (lithium 28.2; olanzapine 28.0; P = 0.44); Clinical Global Impression (CGI) improvement scale (lithium 2.75, olanzapine 2.36; P = 0.163) or the Mania Scale (lithium 13.2, olanzapine 10.2; P = 0.315). Olanzapine was however, significantly superior to lithium on the CGI-severity scale at week 4 (lithium 2.83, olanzapine 2.29; P = 0.025). Olanzapine did not differ from lithium in terms of treatment emergent extrapyramidal side-effects as measured by the Simpson-Angus Scale.

    "36": "Sufficient analgesia, sedation, and paralysis, if necessary, are cornerstones of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment protocols. However, increased distribution volumes, drug absorption by circuit materials, and impaired drug elimination, as well as alternations of cerebral perfusion and blood brain barrier function, result in the markedly altered pharmacodynamics of applied drugs. Today, narcotics combined with benzodiazepines, sometimes enforced by barbiturates, are commonly used in clinical practice. Paralysis is usually achieved by pancuronium or vecuronium. Although these drugs are used widely, actual efficacy remains uncertain because of the lack of reliable tools to measure pain relief and degree of sedation during ECMO, especially during paralysis. Taking into account the detrimental effects of insufficient pain relief and inadequate sedation in such unstable patients as children during pediatric cardiac ECMO, further studies on this topic seem urgently necessary.",

    "38": "The inhibitory effects of five calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, isradipine, mibefradil, nifedipine and verapamil) and three azole antifungal agents (itraconazole, hydroxyitraconazole and ketoconazole) on the alpha-hydroxylation of midazolam, a probe drug for CYP3A4-mediated interactions in humans, were studied in vitro using human liver microsomes. IC50 and Ki values were determined for each inhibitor. The kinetics of the formation of alpha-hydroxymidazolam were best described by simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The estimated values of Vmax and Km were 696 pmol min.-(1) mg(-1) and 7.46 micromol l(-1), respectively. All the compounds studied inhibited midazolam alpha-hydroxylation activity in a concentration-dependent manner, but there were marked differences in their relative inhibitory potency. Ketoconazole was the most potent inhibitor of midazolam alpha-hydroxylation (IC50 0.12 micromol l (-1)), being 10 times more potent than itraconazole (IC50 1.2 micromol l(-1)). The inhibitory effect of hydroxyitraconazole (IC50 2.3 micromol l (-1) was almost as large as that of itraconazole. Among the calcium channel blockers, mibefradil was the most potent inhibitor of the alpha-hydroxylation of midazolam, with an IC50 value (1.6 micromol l (-1)) similar to that of itraconazole. The other calcium channel blockers were much weaker inhibitors than mibefradil: verapamil exhibited a modest inhibitory effect with an IC50 of 23 micromol l(-1), while isradipine, nifedipine and diltiazem, with IC50 values ranging from 57 to >100 micromol l (-1), were weak inhibitors. This rank order of potency against the alpha-hydroxylation Qf midazolam was verified by the Ki values. With the exception of diltiazem, these in vitro results conform with the observed interaction potential of these agents with midazolam and many other CYP3A4 substrates in vivo in man.", 
    "39": "Previous studies have shown that the benzodiazepine agonist, diazepam, suppresses adenylyl cyclase activity in rat brain, via a G protein-coupled benzodiazepine receptor. Since diazepam binding sites are also present in diverse non-neuronal tissues including tumour cells, its effects on adenylyl cyclase activity were examined in membranes from human MCF-7 (breast cancer) and M-6 (melanoma) cells. Diazepam caused a biphasic and concentration-dependent inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in MCF-7 membranes. The first phase of inhibition, at picomolar to nanomolar drug concentrations (EC50=5.7 x 10(-12)M), is similar to the receptor mediated phase observed in the rat brain. At micromolar concentrations of diazepam (EC50= 1.8 x 10(-4)M), the steep decrease in adenylyl cyclase activity may involve a direct action on the enzyme itself, as detected previously in rat brain membranes. Diazepam-induced suppression of adenylyl cyclase activity was also detected in M-6 membranes. However, in contrast to MCF-7 findings, only micromolar concentrations of diazepam (EC50=5.2 x 10(-4)M) inhibited enzyme activity in M-6 membranes. These findings suggest that G protein-coupled benzodiazepine receptors, which mediate inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase-cAMP pathway in the brain, are also expressed in MCF-7 cells.", 
    "40": "Health care givers suffer problems of abuse of and addiction to substances at a rate similar to or perhaps higher than that of the general population according to available studies, most of which were done in the United States. Anesthesiologists tend to have the highest incidence of addiction. Among the risk factors identified are self-medication, stress at work and easy access to drugs. After alcohol, opiates and benzodiazepines are the drugs most favored. No data are available for Spain on this problem. One recently opened treatment program exists, implemented by the Department of Health of the autonomous government of Catalonia (Spain) in collaboration with the Official College of Physicians of Barcelona. Although the problem is probably not great in Spain, prevention programs should be put in place to identify and act on known risk factors, by controlling and limiting access to drugs, raising awareness among health-care givers of the risks of self-medication, and improving working conditions. The main obstacle to treating such patients is denial, which makes identification of abusers and their adherence to a program difficult. The therapeutic phases are identification, intervention, treatment, return to work and follow-up. Addicts are chronic patients who require follow-up for many years, given that the risk of relapse is always present.", 
    "41": "Fentanyl decreases clearance of midazolam administered i.v., but the mechanism remains unclear. To elucidate this mechanism, we have investigated the effect of fentanyl on metabolism of midazolam using human hepatic microsomes and recombinant cytochrome P450 isoforms (n = 6). Midazolam was metabolized to l'-hydroxymidazolam (l'-OH MDZ) by human hepatic microsomes, with a Michaelis-Menten constant (K(m)) of 5.0 (SD 2.7) mumol litre-1. Fentanyl competitively inhibited metabolism of midazolam in human hepatic microsomes, with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 26.8 (12.4) mumol litre-1. Of the seven representative human hepatic P450 isoforms, CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4, only CYP3A4 catalysed hydroxylation of midazolam, with a K(m) of 3.6 (0.8) mumol liter-1. Fentanyl competitively inhibited metabolism of midazolam to l'-OH MDZ by CYP3A4, with a Ki of 24.2 (6.8) mumol litre-1, comparable with the Ki obtained in human hepatic microsomes. These findings indicate that fentanyl competitively inhibits metabolism of midazolam by CYP3A4.",

Patients were given sublingual midazolam 15 mg, melatonin 5 mg or placebo, approximately 100 min before a standard anaesthetic. Sedation, anxiety and orientation were quantified before, and 10, 30, 60 and 90 min after premedication, and 15, 30, 60 and 90 min after admission to the recovery room. Psychomotor performance was evaluated at these times also, using the digit-symbol substitution test (DSST) and the Trieger dot test (TDT). Patients who received premedication with either midazolam or melatonin had a significant decrease in anxiety levels and increase in levels of sedation before operation compared with controls. Midazolam produced the highest scores for sedation at 30 and 60 min after administration and significant psychomotor impairment in the preoperative period compared with melatonin or placebo. After operation, patients who received midazolam or melatonin premedication had increased levels of sedation at 30 min and impairment in performance on the DSST at 15, 30 and 90 min compared with controls. There were no significant differences between the three groups for anxiety levels or TDT performance after operation. Amnesia was notable only in the midazolam group for one preoperative event (entry into the operating room). Patient satisfaction was noted in the midazolam and melatonin groups only. We have demonstrated that melatonin can be used effectively for premedication of adult patients.", 
    "43": "We have studied the effect of nitrous oxide on bispectral index (BIS), calculated from a bipolar encephalogram. Inhalation of 70% nitrous oxide resulted in loss of consciousness in all healthy volunteers (n = 10) but no change in BIS. Brief inhalation up to 1.2% sevoflurane also resulted in loss of consciousness in volunteers (n = 5), but with sevoflurane, BIS decreased. BIS and the haemodynamic effects of adding nitrous oxide were also measured during coronary artery bypass surgery in patients (n = 10) receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions. Measurements were made after 0%, 33%, 66% and 0% nitrous oxide, just before skin incision and after sternotomy. Nitrous oxide caused no change in BIS. BIS may indicate a sufficient hypnotic depth to prevent awareness during surgery, but our study demonstrated that pharmacological unconsciousness-hypnosis can also be reached by mechanisms to which BIS is not sensitive. Thus BIS is a sufficient but not a necessary criterion for adequate depth of anaesthesia or prevention of awareness.", 
    "44": "1. In the mammalian central nervous system, GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter. GABA is a highly flexible molecule and, thus, can exist in many low-energy conformations. Conformationally restricted analogues of GABA have been used to help identify three major GABA receptors, termed GABAA, GABAB and GABAC receptors. 2. GABAA and GABAC receptors are members of a super-family of transmitter-gated ion channels that include nicotinic acetylcholine, strychnine-sensitive glycine and 5HT3 receptors. GABAA receptors are hetero-oligomeric Cl- channels that are selectively blocked by the alkaloid bicuculline and modulated by steroids, barbiturates and benzodiazepines. To date, 16 human GABAA receptor cDNA have been cloned. 3. GABAB receptors are seven transmembrane receptors that are coupled to G-proteins and activate second messenger systems and Ca2+ and K+ ion channels. To date, three GABAB receptor proteins have been cloned and these resemble metabotropic glutamate receptors. GABAB receptors are hetero-oligomeric receptors made up of a mixture of a combination of the subunits. These receptors are selectively activated by (-)-baclofen and CCGP27492 and are blocked by phaclofen, the phosphonic acid analogue of baclofen. 4. In contrast, GABAC receptors represent a relatively simple form of transmitter-gated Cl- channel made up of a single type of protein subunit. Two human GABAC receptor cDNA have been cloned. These receptors are not blocked by bicuculline nor are they modulated by steroids, barbiturates or benzodiazepines. Instead, GABAC receptors are selectively activated by the conformationally restricted analogues of GABA in the folded conformation cis-4-aminocrotonic acid and (1s,2R)-2-(aminomethyl)-1-carboxycyclopropane. (1,2,5,6-Tetrahydropyridine-4-yl)methylphosphinic acid, a methylphosphinic acid analogue of GABA in a partially folded conformation, is a selective antagonist at GABAC receptors.",

For induction anesthesia, intravenous drugs should be preferred; the liver-free stage of the operation is carried out under anesthesia with a closed isoflurane contour, and the initial metabolic disorders of patients are corrected. When the bloodflow is let in the transplanted organ, intravenous drugs (ketamine, phentanyl, and benzodiazepines) should be administered in order to reduce the vasodilating effect of isoflurane and vasopressors for preventing relative hypovolemia. At the final stage of anesthesia, isoflurane is used. Before transporting the patient into intensive care ward, phentanyl in a dose of 1.5-3 micrograms/kg was injected, because of rapid elimination of isoflurane and awakening of the patient. This protocol maintained the hemodynamics and the major metabolic parameters at the optimal level.",

Much of the data on acute administration, by injections of 3 to 5 minutes, for the treatment of seizures, are from series of cases and summaries from congresses and require confirmation. However, they suggest that i.v. VPA may be useful for the treatment of: a) convulsions due to insufficient blood drug levels or failure to take the drug, in order to rapidly raise the drug levels; b) a generalized convulsive status which is partially resistant to diazepam and phenytoin, as a non-depressant alternative to phenobarbital and other CNS depressants, and c) a non-convulsive status as an alternative to benzodiazepines when it is desired to avoid their side effects or when the treatment is going to be continued with oral VPA. The initial dose should be based on the concentration to be reached and the patient's previous VPA levels; the maintenance dose should be based on the stable level to be maintained, the age of the patient and the presence of enzyme inducers.",

    "51": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) has been implicated in several mitochondrial functions but the exact physiological role of this receptor is still under debate. Since the mitochondria have been attributed a central role in cell death, we have determined the effects of various PBR agonists and antagonists on the apoptosis of the human lymphoblastoid cell line U937. On this cell type, the PBR agonist Ro5-4864 was found to strongly protect the cells against apoptosis induced by TNFalpha. The antiapoptotic effect of PBR agonists was due to a selective interaction with the PBR as demonstrated by: (1) a close correlation between the antiapoptotic activity of various PBR agonists and their respective affinity for the PBR determined on the same cells, (2) a lack of effect of central benzodiazepine receptors agonists such as clonazepam on cell survival, (3) the lack of an antiapoptotic activity of Ro5-4864 on wild-type Jurkat cells (lacking the PBR receptor) and the reappearance of this effect on PBR-transfected Jurkat cells, and (4) the blockade of the antiapoptotic effect of PBR agonists by a selective PBR antagonist. The present results therefore indicate that PBR agonists are potent antiapoptotic compounds and show that this effect might represent a major function for this enigmatic receptor.", 
    "52": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric disorder that occurs in both acute and chronic liver failure. Although the precise pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for HE are not completely understood, a deficit in neurotransmission rather than a primary deficit in cerebral energy metabolism appears to be involved. The neural cell most vulnerable to liver failure is the astrocyte. In acute liver failure, the astrocyte undergoes swelling resulting in increased intracranial pressure; in chronic liver failure, the astrocyte undergoes characteristic changes known as Alzheimer type II astrocytosis. In portal-systemic encephalopathy resulting from chronic liver failure, astrocytes manifest altered expression of several key proteins and enzymes including monoamine oxidase B, glutamine synthetase, and the so-called peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors. In addition, expression of some neuronal proteins such as monoamine oxidase A and neuronal nitric oxide synthase are modified. In acute liver failure, expression of the astrocytic glutamate transporter GLT-1 is reduced, leading to increased extracellular concentrations of glutamate. Many of these changes have been attributed to a toxic effect of ammonia and/or manganese, two substances that are normally removed by the hepatobiliary route and that in liver failure accumulate in the brain. Manganese deposition in the globus pallidus in chronic liver failure results in signal hyperintensity on T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging and may be responsible for the extrapyramidal symptoms characteristic of portal-systemic encephalopathy. Other neurotransmitter systems implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy include the serotonin system, where a synaptic deficit has been suggested, as well as the catecholaminergic and opioid systems. Further elucidation of the precise nature of these alterations could result in the design of novel pharmacotherapies for the prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy.", 
    "53": "In the present positron emission tomography (PET) study, we examine the effect of a scopolamine-induced challenge to encoding upon the pattern of regional cerebral blood flow during recognition of a list of abstract visual shapes 3 days after encoding of these shapes. This study was conducted to test hypotheses concerning the fusiform and thalamic contributions to object recognition arising from a previous imaging study of impaired recognition. In that study, we demonstrated that activity in the fusiform cortex and the thalamus during shape recognition was modulated by memory challenges. These memory challenges included, on one hand, impaired storage as a consequence of diazepam administration during encoding, and, on the other hand, impaired retrieval caused by a perceptual challenge. Activation in the fusiform cortex decreased during impaired recognition, irrespective of the type of challenge. In contrast, thalamic activation increased only when the recognition deficit resulted from impaired memory storage. Based on these results, we hypothesized that fusiform activation during recognition reflects the matching of an incoming stimulus with a stored one, whereas thalamic activation reflects retrieval attempts. These hypotheses would receive considerable support if scopolamine, which also impairs memory storage, induced similar modulations of fusiform and thalamic activation. In the present study, we observed that a scopolamine challenge to encoding does indeed modulate the activity in the very same regions that were previously modulated by a diazepam challenge. Hence, a similar memory deficit, although primarily effected through different neurochemical pathways, was paralleled by a similar modulation of activity in the same set of nodes in the shape recognition network. In the fusiform cortex, scopolamine decreased recognition-related activity, as did the sensory challenge of retrieval. Furthermore, covariate analysis demonstrated that the level of fusiform activity linearly correlates with behavioural performance. In the thalamus, activation increased following impaired encoding. This is in accordance with the idea that enhanced thalamic activity reflects increased effort expended in retrieval. In addition, in the intraparietal sulcus, differential activation also increased following impaired memory storage, possibly reflecting enhanced visuospatial attention in an effort to compensate for impaired performance.", 
    "54": "Simultaneous intracellular recordings from presynaptic Stratum pyramidale interneurons and postsynaptic pyramidal cells in adult rat hippocampal slices were performed to investigate the strength of the modulation of single-axon inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) by the GABAA receptor modulators pentobarbitone, diazepam and zinc. The processing of biocytin-filled interneurons for light microscopy revealed that these single-axon IPSPs were generated by basket cells (n = 33), bistratified cells (n = 18) and axo-axonic cells (n = 2). The IPSPs generated by these three groups of interneurons had amplitudes and widths at half amplitude with similar ranges, but when bistratified cell IPSPs were compared with basket cell IPSPs with similar half widths their rise times were slower. Pentobarbitone sodium (250 microM) powerfully enhanced 13 tested IPSPs generated by all three cell types. Amplitudes were enhanced by 82 +/- 56%, 10-90% rise times by 150 +/- 101% and the widths at half amplitude by 71 +/- 29%. Diazepam (1-2 microM) also increased all IPSPs tested, although the changes were more moderate in basket cell IPSPs (amplitudes increased by 19 +/- 11%, n = 8) than in bistratified cell IPSPs (amplitudes increased by 66 +/- 48%, n = 5). Basket cell IPSP 10-90% rise times and widths at half amplitude were not significantly increased. Bistratified cell IPSP 10-90% rise times were increased by 44 +/- 24% and the widths at half amplitude by 32 +/- 35%. The one tested IPSP generated by an axo-axonic cell was also diazepam-sensitive. Zinc, 250 microM, decreased four out of 10 IPSPs generated by basket cells and four out of five IPSPs generated by bistratified cells. The one tested axo-axonic cell IPSP was zinc-insensitive. These data suggest that IPSPs generated in CA1 pyramidal cells by basket and bistratified cells display different pharmacologies and may be mediated by different receptors or receptor combinations.", 
    "55": "In vivo studies suggest that ontogenesis of limbic seizures is determined by the development of the limbic circuit. We have now used the newly-developed in vitro intact interconnected neonatal rat limbic structures preparation to determine the developmental profile of kainate-induced epileptiform activity in the hippocampus and its propagation to other limbic structures. We report gradual alterations in the effects of kainate during the first postnatal week on an almost daily basis; from no epileptiform activity at birth, through interictal seizures around postnatal day (P) 2 and ictal seizures by the end of the first week. The developmental profile of kainate-induced hippocampal seizures is paralleled by the expression of postsynaptic kainate receptor-mediated currents in CA3 pyramidal cells. Intralimbic propagation of the hippocampal seizures is also age-dependent: whereas seizures readily propagate to the septum and to the contralateral hippocampus via the commissures on P2, propagation to the entorhinal cortex only takes place from P4 onwards. Finally, repeated brief applications of kainate to the hippocampus induce recurrent spontaneous glutamatergic ictal and interictal discharges which persist for several hours after the kainate is washed away and which replace the physiological pattern of network activity. Paroxysmal activities are thus generated by kainate in the hippocampus at an early developmental stage and are initially restricted to this structure. Before the end of the first week of postnatal life, kainate generates the epileptiform activities that may perturb activity-dependent mechanisms that modulate neuronal development. Although at this stage neurons are relatively resistant to the pathological effects of kainate, the epileptiform activities that it generates will perturb activity-dependent mechanisms that modulate neuronal development.", 
    "56": "The amygdala is intimately involved in emotional behavior, and its role in the generation of anxiety and conditioned fear is well known. Benzodiazepines, which are commonly used for the relief of anxiety, are thought to act by enhancing the action of the inhibitory transmitter GABA. We have examined the properties of GABA-mediated inhibition in the amygdala. Whole-cell recordings were made from neurons in the lateral division of the central amygdala. Application of GABA evoked a current that reversed at the chloride equilibrium potential. Application of the GABA antagonists bicuculline or SR95531 inhibited the GABA-evoked current in a manner consistent with two binding sites. Stimulation of afferents to neurons in the central amygdala evoked an IPSC that was mediated by the release of GABA. The GABA(A) receptor antagonists bicuculline and picrotoxin failed to completely block the IPSC. The bicuculline-resistant IPSC was chloride-selective and was unaffected by GABA(B)-receptor antagonists. Furthermore, this current was insensitive to modulation by general anesthetics or barbiturates. In contrast to their actions at GABA(A) receptors, diazepam and flurazepam inhibited the bicuculline-resistant IPSC in a concentration-dependent manner. These effects were fully antagonized by the benzodiazepine site antagonist Ro15-1788. We conclude that a new type of ionotropic GABA receptor mediates fast inhibitory transmission in the central amygdala. This receptor may be a potential target for the development of new therapeutic strategies for anxiety disorders.",

    "65": "Muscarinic M(2) (AF-DX 384, BIBN-161) and M(4) (PD102807) receptor antagonists were used to investigate the respective roles of these two receptor sub-types in the regulation of acetylcholine release in the rat hippocampus. In vivo dialysis studies revealed that only the muscarinic M(2) receptor antagonists significantly and concentration-dependently facilitate acetylcholine release. The newly developed muscarinic M(4) receptor antagonist was unable to regulate acetylcholine release except at the highest concentration tested. It would thus appear that the muscarinic receptor acting as negative autoreceptor in the rat hippocampus is of the muscarinic M(2) sub-type, the role of the muscarinic M(4) receptor being minimal in this regard.", 
    "66": "The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists, atropine and pirenzepine, produced an apparent insurmountable antagonism of muscarinic M(1) receptor-mediated intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells when tested against the agonists carbachol or xanomeline. Each antagonist caused a dextral shift of the agonist concentration-response curves with depression of the maximum response that was incomplete (i.e., saturated) and which varied with the pairs of agonist and antagonist. Equilibrium competition binding assays found no deviation from simple, reversible competitive behavior for either antagonist. The relative rates of dissociation of unlabeled atropine and pirenzepine were also assessed in radioligand kinetic studies and it was found that atropine dissociated from the receptor approximately 8-fold slower than pirenzepine. Numerical dynamic simulations suggested that the insurmountability of antagonism observed in the present study was probably a kinetic artifact related to the measurement of transient responses to a non-equilibrated agonist in the presence of a slowly dissociating antagonist. Importantly, the patterns of antagonism observed included a saturable depression of agonist maximal response, a mode of antagonism that is incompatible with the previously described phenomenon of hemi-equilibrium states. Monte Carlo simulations indicated that reasonable, semi-quantitative estimates of antagonist potency could be determined by a minor modification of standard methods, where equieffective agonist concentrations, rather than EC(50) values, are compared in the absence and presence of antagonist. Application of the latter approach to the functional data yielded estimates of antagonist potency that were in excellent agreement with those derived from the equilibrium binding assays, thus indicating that the present method can be useful for quantifying antagonist potency under non-equilibrium conditions.",

Aniline hydroxylase, aminopyrine N-demethylase and p-nitroanisole O-demethylase activities were increased 1.48-, 1.15- and 1.47-fold, respectively, in chlordiazepoxide-treated rats, 1.65-, 1.20- and 1.38-fold in griseofulvin-treated rats, 1.74-, 1.36- and 1.44-fold in rifampicin-treated rats, 1.56-, 1.29- and 1.62-fold in phenytoin-treated rats and 2.26-, 1.72- and 1.93-fold in phenobarbitone-treated rats. Chlordiazepoxide, griseofulvin, rifampicin, phenytoin and phenobarbitone increased the activity of cytosolic phosphatidate phosphohydrolase by 52, 58, 67, 73 and 82%, respectively, while the drugs elicited 50, 60, 60, 73 and 87% increases in the activity of the microsomal phosphatidate phosphohydrolase. Similarly, chlordiazepoxide, griseofulvin, rifampicin, phenytoin and phenobarbitone elicited 2.4-, 2.39-, 2.34-, 1.69- and 3.75-fold increases in serum triacylglycerol concentrations. The correlations between serum triacylglycerol concentrations and the activities of aniline hydroxylase, aminopyrine N-demethylase and p-nitroanisole O-demethylase were significant in all treatment groups (r=0.83, r=0.92 and r=0.87, respectively, n=30, P<0.001). Our results suggest that induction of hepatic enzymes by the administered drugs may lead to hypertriglyceridaemia as an adverse effect, possibly by inducing the activity of regulatory enzymes in the biosynthesis of triglyceride.",

At low concentrations, valerian extracts enhance [3H]flunitrazepam binding (EC50 4.13 x 10(-10) mg/ml). However, this increased [3H]flunitrazepam binding is replaced by an inhibition at higher concentrations (IC50 of 4.82 x 10(-1) mg/ml). These results are consistent with the presence of at least two different biological activities interacting with [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites. Valerian extracts also potentiate K+ or veratridine-stimulated release of radioactivity from hippocampal slices preloaded with [3H]GABA. Finally, inhibition of synaptosomal [3H]GABA uptake by valerian extracts also displays a biphasic interaction with guvacine. The results confirm that valerian extracts have effects on GABA(A) receptors, but can also interact at other presynaptic components of GABAergic neurons.",

    "81": "The effect of environmental ionic strength on the rate of drug release from a cation exchange membrane was evaluated. Cationic propranolol-HCl, timolol, sotalol-HCl, atenolol and dexmedetomidine-HCl and neutral diazepam were adsorbed onto a porous poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane that was grafted with bioadhesive poly(acrylic acid) chains (PAA-PVDF). Despite its porosity, the PAA-PVDF membrane acted as a cation exchange membrane. The release of adsorbed drug from the PAA-PVDF membrane was investigated by using a USP rotating basket apparatus. Adsorption of cationic drugs onto the PAA-PVDF membrane tended to increase with increasing lipophilicity of the drug. A decrease in the ionic strength of the adsorption medium increased the amount of the cationic drugs adsorbed onto the membrane, but had no effect on diazepam adsorption. The release of cationic drugs from the PAA-PVDF membrane was greatly affected by the ionic strength of both the adsorption medium and the dissolution medium, while ionic strengths did not affect diazepam release. Our results suggest that the ionic strength of both the adsorption and dissolution media substantially affects the release rate of a drug that has been adsorbed onto the ion exchange membrane, primarily via electrostatic interactions, while ionic strength has no effect on the release of a drug which has been adsorbed onto the membrane via non-electrostatic forces.", 
    "82": "We sought to determine: 1) whether a simple hypnotic induction with an alprazolam experience derived suggestion could recreate the subjective effects of alprazolam (Xanax), 2) whether the effects of alprazolam are greater than the effects of hypnosis plus this suggestion, and 3) whether the effects of hypnosis plus this suggestion were greater than the relaxation effects produced by hypnosis alone. High and low hypnotizable student volunteer subjects (Ss) ingested 1 mg of alprazolam. A hypnotic suggestion was developed on the basis of their reported reactions to alprazolam. Four days later the same Ss were exposed to hypnosis only and hypnosis plus the alprazolam experience based suggestion conditions in counterbalanced order. Ss exposed to the hypnosis plus suggestion condition demonstrated greater levels of relaxation as measured by the tension-anxiety scale of the Profile of Mood States (POMS) (Eichman & Umstead, 1971) than in the alprazolam condition or the hypnosis only condition. High hypnotizables showed significantly greater levels of relaxation than the low hypnotizables in each of the three conditions (hypnosis plus suggestion, hypnosis only, alprazolam only). EEG data showed frontal and occipital sites were specifically involved in both the alprazolam and the hypnotic suggestion conditions. The findings indicate a basis for the use of hypnosis as a substitute for sedative drug use. Limitations and implications for clinicians are discussed.",

Positron emission tomography (PET) studies showed dysfunction of medial and orbital prefrontal cortex during PTSD symptom provocation and in response to traumatic reminders. Decreased benzodiazepine receptor binding was found in the medial prefrontal cortex as measured with neuroimaging in PTSD. The hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex play important roles in memory and emotional regulation, and dysfunction in these areas may underlie memory deficits and pathological emotions in PTSD.",

Generalized tonic-clonic seizures appeared resistant to the administration of multiple antiepileptics. They ceased after a supplementary dose of intravenous diazepam, endotracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation. An episode of ventricular tachycardia responded well to i. v. lidocaine.

    "88": "Although many studies of RCBD have been reported over the last 2 decades, knowledge remains limited. Higher incidence in women is the sole clearly replicated finding in most studies. This finding might be mediated by cyclothymia, a temperament that is of higher prevalence in women and that might be considered as a normal variant of RC. Many questions remain unanswered. Review of putative risk factors, such as hypothyroidism and treatment with antidepressants, provides no conclusive answers. There is clinical evidence to implicate both factors. In principle, the thyroid connection can be approached rationally, yet there seems to be no relationship between thyroid status and response to thyroid augmentation. For this reason and given the potential risks of long-term thyroid use, this strategy should not be the first one to be tried in RC. Cumulatively, naturalistic studies over the past 30 years have strongly implicated antidepressants in switching and cycle acceleration, yet the double-blind, controlled, prospective studies that are needed to provide definitive answers are unlikely to be conducted for ethical reasons discussed in this article. Bipolar family history of RC probands appears indistinguishable from non-RC probands, indicating that most likely RCBD does not breed true. Although RC seems to be more lithium resistant with less likelihood of being symptom-free after 2 to 5 years of follow-up, many of these patients nonetheless have resolution of the RC course. There is no marked difference in suicide rates. An association of RC with bipolar type II, D-M-I pattern and those who switch into mania or hypomania on antidepressants is a provocative possibility: Antidepressants might introduce RC by first inducing a switch during a depressive episode, creating a D-M-I pattern, a pattern that is poorly responsive to lithium, which eventually degenerates into RC. Again, this sequence might be mediated by the high prevalence of cyclothymia in bipolar II patients. Thus, data from phenomenology, family history, and long-term outcome do not support RC as a separate entity. RC appears to be a temporary complicated phase in the illness, not a stable feature. This was noted by Kraepelin: I think I am convinced that that kind of classification must of necessity wreck on the irregularity of the disease. The kind and duration of the attacks and the intervals by no means remain the same in the individual case but may frequently change, so that the case must be reckoned always to new forms. Data by Gottschalk et al testify to the chaotic mood swings of contemporary bipolar disorder. Moreover RC is seen in other medical diseases, such as epilepsy, in which patients have phases of increase in frequency of episodes (seizures) that become refractory to treatment. Further longitudinal prospective studies are required to understand the complexity of this intriguing phenomenon and to provide better treatments. Algorithms deriving from tertiary research or university-based clinical experience may not generalize to RC or otherwise treatment-resistant bipolar patients seen in more routine practice. Illness severity in RCBD generally precludes double-blind controlled investigations. Meanwhile, clinicians may rely on discontinuing antidepressants, maintaining patients on combined mood stabilizers--of which valproate is probably the most useful--and making judicious use of atypical neuroleptics. Benzodiazepines and alcohol (which produce withdrawal), caffeine, stimulants, exposure to bright light, and sleep deprivation during excited phases should be avoided. Thyroid and nimodipine augmentation can be considered in those with the most malignant course. These are patients who need the maximal support that their psychiatrist can provide them. Office visits must be arranged as the last appointment of the day.",

When a 15-s waiting period was imposed in the arm leading to the large reward, rats selected this arm on 65-70% of the trials. This frequency was reduced to less than 40% when the large reward was delayed by 25 s.", 
    "92": "In rats whose ascending 5-HT pathways had been lesioned by infusion of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) into the dorsal raphe, the introduction of the 15-s delay contingency resulted in a transient larger reduction of the frequency of choice of the now-delayed reward, compared to sham operated controls. In contrast, choice behaviour of rats given 5,7-DHT into the substantia nigra did not differ from controls. para-Chlorophenylalanine (pCPA, 150 mg/kg IP, daily for 3 days), a 5-HT synthesis inhibitor, bretazenil (0.5-8 mg/kg IP), a benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor partial agonist, and muscimol (0.25-1 mg/kg IP), a GABA(A) receptor agonist, induced a shift toward immediate reward. In contrast to the other BZDs, alprazolam (1-2 mg/kg IP) enhanced the frequency of choice of the large-but-25 s-delayed reward. Similar increased preference for the large-but-delayed reward was induced by the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors, fluoxetine (4-8 mg/kg IP) and fluvoxamine (4 mg/kg IP). The full 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT (0.015-0.5 mg/kg IP) enhanced the frequency of choice of the large reward delayed by 25 s, whereas the partial agonists, buspirone (1-4 mg/kg IP), ipsapirone (0.5-1 mg/kg IP) and MDL 73005EF (1-2 mg/kg SC), and the antagonist, WAY 100635 (4 mg/kg SC), reduced the number of choices of the large reward delayed by 15 s. Unexpectedly, WAY 100635 (2 mg/kg), which had no effect on choice whatever the delay, did not counteract the increased tolerance to delay induced by 8-OH-DPAT (0.06 mg/kg) and further reduced the frequency of choice of the large-but- 15 s-delayed reward induced by ipsapirone (0.5 mg/kg).", 
    "93": "These effects on tolerance to delay may be accounted for by a subtle balance between the opposing functional consequences of pre- versus post-synaptic 5-HT(1A) receptor activation or blockade. Overall, the present results provide further support to the idea that 5-HT processes participate in the control of impulsive-related behaviour, as assessed from tolerance to delay of reward in this particular T-maze procedure.", 
    "94": "GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid(A)) receptors are molecular substrates for the regulation of vigilance, anxiety, muscle tension, epileptogenic activity and memory functions, which is evident from the spectrum of actions elicited by clinically effective drugs acting at their modulatory benzodiazepine-binding site. Here we show, by introducing a histidine-to-arginine point mutation at position 101 of the murine alpha1-subunit gene, that alpha1-type GABA(A) receptors, which are mainly expressed in cortical areas and thalamus, are rendered insensitive to allosteric modulation by benzodiazepine-site ligands, whilst regulation by the physiological neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid is preserved. alpha1(H101R) mice failed to show the sedative, amnesic and partly the anticonvulsant action of diazepam. In contrast, the anxiolytic-like, myorelaxant, motor-impairing and ethanol-potentiating effects were fully retained, and are attributed to the nonmutated GABA(A) receptors found in the limbic system (alpha2, alpha5), in monoaminergic neurons (alpha3) and in motoneurons (alpha2, alpha5). Thus, benzodiazepine-induced behavioural responses are mediated by specific GABA(A) receptor subtypes in distinct neuronal circuits, which is of interest for drug design.",

It has been suggested that type II pyrethroids may act on GABA receptors as benzodiazepine antagonists. Because benzodiazepines are used in anxiety, the present study was undertaken to investigate the possible anxiogenic effects of fenvalerate, a type II pyrethroid, in rats. Behavior in the open-field, social interaction, plus-maze behavior, and one-way passive avoidance were studied in rats orally treated with 1, 10, or 30 mg/kg fenvalerate. This pyrethroid reduced locomotion and rearing frequencies and increased immobility duration. Ten and 30 mg/kg of fenvalerate reduced social interaction, whereas the 1 mg/kg dose had no effect on this behavior. Fenvalerate administration did not change the plus-maze behavior of rats. Pretraining administration (1, 10, and 30 mg/kg) did not modify the behavior of rats during the training session of a passive avoidance task, while in the test session 10 mg/kg fenvalerate caused an increase in the crossing latency, and the 30 mg/kg dose reduced this parameter and increased the percent of animals crossing to the shock compartment. The behavioral alterations observed in this study suggest that fenvalerate has an anxiolytic effect on rats.",

The measures for parkinsonism were no different across treatment groups, even after taking into account the higher rate of anticholinergic use in the risperidone group. Following 6 months of treatment with these 2 atypical neuroleptics, there was a significantly greater reduction in psychotic symptoms among risperidone-treated subjects. Otherwise, risperidone and olanzapine appear to be equally effective in reducing disorganized and negative symptoms and in improving the quality of life.",

Risperidone was more effective for treatment of psychotic symptoms at 6 months, but otherwise the 2 medications were equally effective in the routine clinical care of patients with schizophrenia.

    "107": "The bispectral index, a value derived from the electroencephalogram, has been proposed as a measure of anaesthetic effect. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the bispectral index during midazolam-fentanyl anaesthesia for cardiac surgery for its possible role as a predictor of increases in systolic blood pressure during endotracheal intubation and sternotomy. After institutional approval 15 consenting patients, scheduled for elective cardiac surgery, were selected for the study. Anaesthesia was induced in all patients with a loading dose of fentanyl 7.5-10 micrograms kg-1, midazolam 0.15 mg kg-1 and pancuronium 0.1 mg kg-1. After a further bolus dose of fentanyl 10-12.5 micrograms kg-1 prior to the start of incision and sternotomy, maintenance infusion rates of fentanyl 4-6 micrograms kg-1 h-1 and midazolam 0.1 mg kg-1 h-1 were started and continued through surgery at the discretion of the anaesthetist and guided by the presenting clinical and haemodynamic responses. The control of anaesthesia was never based on the value of the bispectral index. The mean bispectral index value decreased from 95.7 (3.1) at base-line to 59.5 (12.0) after induction of anaesthesia and then remained below 70 throughout surgery. However, there was an important interindividual variability in bispectral index values despite standardized dosages of fentanyl and midazolam. There was no significant correlation between the bispectral index values in the pre-intubation and pre-incision period and the changes in systolic blood pressure during endotracheal intubation and sternotomy, respectively. In conclusion, the large intersubject variability in the bispectral index values should be investigated further in the light of the great variability in the clinical effects of midazolam and fentanyl. The lack of significant correlation between the bispectral index values and the haemodynamic responses suggest that the bispectral index, which is a helpful monitor of anaesthetic depth, is not a very reliable monitor of global anaesthetic adequacy during total intravenous anaesthesia with a combination of midazolam and fentanyl in cardiac surgical patients.",

This situation requires methods, which in the early stages of the drug development process of an interesting compound allow the establishment of a reliable and valid data set, in order to make decisions on the continuation or discontinuation of a project. Given a compound out of the group of benzodiazepines as an example this paper represents todays methods of integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling as well as the special computer aided strategies of drug dosing as powerful tools in the anaesthetic drug development process. It is shown that one can generate data concerning differences in drug requirement and drug duration in the therapeutic dose range between different groups of possible patients, e.g. young and elderly, as early as the early phase II. It is concluded that these clinical pharmacological tools and the high resolution data generated by them facilitate the Go/No-Go decision to proceed to phase III and enhance the likelihood of passing phase III successfully.",

    "110": "1. To aid in the prediction of drug interactions with alprazolam, the human CYP involved in the 1'- and 4-hydroxylation of alprazolam were characterized using human liver microsomes, expressed enzymes and selective chemical inhibitors. 2. The formation of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and 1'-hydroxyalprazolam at an alprazolam concentration of 62.5 microM were reduced by the prototypic CYP3A inhibitor, troleandomycin (50 microM), by 97 and 9900 respectively. Only microsomes from B-lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP3A4 were capable of catalysing the 1'- and 4-hydroxylation of alprazolam. 3. The formation rates of 1'-hydroxyalprazolam and 4-hydroxyalprazolam at an alprazolam concentration of 1 mM were significantly correlated (n = 19, r = 0.95, p<0.01) indicating that the same enzyme(s) mediated these biotransformations. A significant (p<0.01) correlation was observed between alprazolam 4- and 1'-hydroxylase activity and CYP3A-mediated midazolam 4-hydroxylase, midazolam 1'-hydroxylase, dextromethorphan N-demethylase and erythromycin N-demethylase activities. 4. In conclusion, in adult human liver the CYP3A subfamily members are the principal enzymes involved in the 1'- and 4-hydroxylation of alprazolam. Thus, clinically significant drug drug interactions between alprazolam and other CYP3A substrates are to be expected.", 
    "111": "7-Methoxy-6-[3-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]propoxy]-3,4-dim ethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-2-one hydro-chloride (KA-672), structurally related to naturally occurring coumarins, has been described as a potential drug for enhancing cognitive functions. However, a detailed characterization of the pharmacological profile of KA-672 in vivo is still lacking. Quantitative neurotransmitter receptor autoradiography was used as a tool to screen for KA-672-induced changes in a number of transmitter receptors including cholinergic, noradrenergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic, and serotonergic subtypes throughout the brain. Two hours following treatment of mice with 1 mg/kg KA-672 per os, slight increases of nicotinic and M1-muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding, of alpha2-and beta-adrenoceptor as well as 5-HT1A receptors in various cerebral cortical regions were observed, whereas 5-HT2A binding sites were strikingly increased throughout the brain following KA-672 treatment. In contrast, (+/-)-alphaamino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor binding was significantly decreased in some cortical regions after drug treatment. No effects of KA-672 treatment on N-methyl-D-aspartate, kainate, GABA(A) and benzodiazepine receptor as well as M2-muscarinic cholinergic and high-affinity choline uptake binding were observed. As interactions between the cholinergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission have been stressed to play important roles in realizing learning and memory events, the cognition-enhancing effects of KA-672 may be due to this complex in vivo pharmacological profile of KA-672.", 
    "112": "Male rats chronically exposed to diazepam (DZ) slowly released from subcutaneously implanted silastic capsules along with empty capsule control rats were focally injected (1 microl) into the substantia nigra (SNR) with the central (CBR) and peripheral (PBR) benzodiazepine receptor antagonists, flumazenil [(FLU) 6.25, 12.5, 25 microg] and PK 11195 [(PK) 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 microg], respectively (weekly intervals; Latin square design). Rats were observed for signs of withdrawal and the EEG was recorded simultaneously from the site of injection (SNR), caudate putamen, thalamus, hippocampus, and frontal cortex. In DZ-dependent rats the Precipitated Abstinence Score (PAS) was significantly related to dose of FLU. The PAS increased with increasing doses of PK (3.125-12.5 microg); however, the highest dose of PK (25 microg) showed less effect. The rapid onset of the PAS was accompanied by a rise in the total power (1-32 Hz) of the EEG (TP(EEG)) in the SNR and other brain areas. The PAS and TP(EEG) had similar time courses. Intranigrally injected FLU and PK did not evoke clonic and tonic-clonic convulsions; however, both antagonists induced dose-related twitches and jerks. Additionally, FLU precipitated a dose-related tachypnea and increases in turning and backing. Chronic DZ treatment altered the spectral content of the EEG, as indicated by a decrease and an increase of the slow and fast frequency bands, respectively. FLU and PK rapidly but transiently reversed the EEG. Data suggest that in the SNR the CBR mediate autonomic and motor signs of DZ withdrawal, while both the CBR and PBR are responsible for twitches and jerks and alteration of the EEG. It is possible that PK also acts on the site linked to a GABA(A)/CBR/ionophore.", 
    "113": "Interaction of cannabinoids with GABAergic systems has been noted in a number of previous studies. In the present study, this interaction was examined in a drug-discrimination paradigm. Rats were trained to discriminate either delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta9-THC; 3 mg/kg) or diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) from vehicle in two-lever drug discrimination procedures for food reinforcement. As in previous studies, diazepam partially substituted for delta9-THC, but only at high doses that also decreased response rates. In contrast, delta9-THC did not substitute for diazepam in any of the rats. Hence, cross-generalization of these two drugs was asymmetrical. When tested in combination with diazepam, the brain cannabinoid (CB1) receptor antagonist SR141716A did not block the partial substitution of diazepam for delta9-THC, nor did it antagonize the discriminative stimulus effects of diazepam in diazepam-trained rats. These results suggest that the partial overlap in the discriminative stimulus effects of delta9-THC and diazepam is not mediated by diazepam action at CB1 receptors. However, the fact that diazepam produced partial substitution for delta9-THC is consistent with a GABAergic component to cannabinoid drug discrimination.", 
    "114": "The development of tolerance to benzodiazepine (BDZ) and other psychoactive agents such as morphine, alcohol, and barbiturates is thought to be a contingent or learning phenomenon. In a previous report, we demonstrated a positive correlation between the development of tolerance to the sedative effects of diazepam (DZ) and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. The results of the present work show that the development of tolerance to the hypolocomotor action of DZ (5 mg/kg) for 4 days and the associated increase in synaptic plasticity are context specific. Because animal preexposure to the drug administration context blocks both the tolerance sedative effects of DZ and the increased hippocampal synaptic plasticity, observed after 4 days of DZ administration, we propose the increased synaptic plasticity on hippocampal development as one of the biological substrates to the tolerance to DZ. Besides, the continuous administration of DZ did not induce a conditioning opponent response in these animals.", 
    "115": "The present study examined effects of acute and repeated administration of 1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid (ACPC), a partial agonist of glycineB receptors, in the conflict drinking test and the forced swim test in rats. Diazepam and imipramine were used, respectively, as reference drugs in those tests. In the conflict drinking test, acute administration of ACPC (200 mg/kg) increased fivefold the number of punished licks. A three- and fivefold increase in the number of punished licks was observed in rats treated repeatedly with ACPC (200 mg/kg daily; 14 days) and challenged with the same dose of the drug 24 h or 4 days later, respectively. A single injection of ACPC (400 mg/kg) reduced by 40% the immobility time in the forced swim test. In rats treated repeatedly with ACPC (400 mg/kg daily; 14 days) and challenged with the same dose 24 h or 4 days later, the drug either produced no significant effect or reduced the immobility time by 50%, respectively. On the other hand, no changes in anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects of chronically administered diazepam (10 mg/kg daily; 14 days) and imipramine (30 mg/kg daily; 14 days), respectively, were observed. The above results indicate that tolerance develops to the anxiolytic- and, particularly, to the antidepressant-like activity of ACPC.", 
    "116": "The effect of acute and chronic treatment of rats with a lyophilized extract of the leaves of the medicinal plant Rhazya stricta on total and ambulatory activity was studied. Given acutely at single oral doses of 1, 2, 4, and 8 g/kg, the extract produced dose-dependent decreases in total activity and ambulatory activity. Diazepam (20 mg/kg, orally) produced a decrease in rat activity comparable to that produced by a dose of 1 g/kg of the extract. When given daily at an oral dose of 2 g/kg for 21 consecutive days, the extract produced, on the last day of treatment, significant decrease in activity amounting to about 30% of control activity levels. Subcutaneous (SC) treatment of rats with caffeine (7.5, 15, and 30 mg/kg), dose-dependently and significantly increased total activity and ambulatory activity. These effects were dose-dependently attenuated when the extract was given concomitantly with caffeine at oral doses of 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg. Treatment of rats with zoxazolamine alone (10, 20, or 40 mg/kg, SC) or R. Stricta (1 and 4 g/kg orally) alone significantly decreased total and ambulatory activities. Concomitant treatment with zoxazolamine and R. Stricta decreased the rats activity to a greater degree than with either treatment given alone.",

Weight gain occurs no matter what the patient's age, sex, or race and is seen with both oral and depot drug formulations. Numerous studies have found that patients gain weight when treated with a conventional antipsychotic, such as chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, and haloperidol. The newer, novel antipsychotics offer advantages over conventional antipsychotics, especially a relative lack of extrapyramidal symptoms, but some still have the disadvantage of causing weight gain. Clozapine and olanzapine in particular appear to cause substantial weight gain, much more so than do most conventional neuroleptics and novel agents such as risperidone. Given the risks to health and treatment compliance associated with weight gain and obesity, clinicians should monitor weight during the course of antipsychotic therapy and consider switching agents if excessive weight gain occurs.",

    "146": "Anxious behaviour constitutes one of the markers that best differentiated the 'non-emotional' C57BL/6 (C57) strain from the 'emotional' BALB/c (BALB) strain. Interestingly, C3H/He (C3H) mice, which possess a common genetic background to BALB, have also been found to be 'emotional' mice. The present study first illustrates that BALB and C3H mice exhibit a higher emotional level both in non-constraining situation (free-exploratory paradigm) and in a stressful one (light/dark choice test). Second, the present results confirmed the hypothesis that trait anxiety, modelled neophobic reactions in the free-exploratory paradigm, is related to GABA-benzodiazepine system rather than to the serotoninergic one, in contrast to state anxiety, modelled by the light/dark choice test. Like in BALB mice, chlordiazepoxide was able to counteract the neophobic responses in C3H mice confronted with the free-exploratory paradigm, in contrast to 8-OH-DPAT which did not modify C3H behaviour in this test. Conversely, both chlordiazepoxide and 8-OH-DPAT reduced anxious reactions of BALB and C3H mice in the light/dark choice test, showing that BALB and C3H mice are sensitive to serotonin-interacting drugs only when confronted with a stressful situation. Furthermore, chlordiazepoxide and 8-OH-DPAT were found to be devoid of anxiolytic-like effect in C57 mice. The lack of anxiolytic-like activity of these compounds in C57 mice can be related to the low basal level of emotional reactions of this strain. Finally, the present results showed that chronic stress was able to blunt general emotional level of mice in both experimental situations and that both BALB and C3H mice were more sensitive to chronic stress than C57 ones. In conclusion, BALB and C3H may be two strains of choice for testing potential anti-anxiety treatments which might be of great long-term benefit in the chronically anxious patients. Furthermore, these strains constitute interesting material for determining hereditary factors which presumably underlie the development of some chronic anxiety disorders. Finally, since C3H and BALB mice appeared particularly susceptible to chronic stress, it can be proposed that these strains may be a useful tool to examine the possible common origins of anxiety disorders and chronic stress-related disorders, such as certain forms of depression.", 
    "147": "The hydroalcoholic extract of Hypericum perforatum L. is an effective antidepressant, although its mechanism of action is still unknown. It inhibits the synaptosomal uptake of serotonin (5-HT), dopamine and noradrenaline, suggesting a biochemical mechanism similar to the synthetic standard antidepressants. In the present study, further investigating this hypothesis, we confirmed that a hydromethanolic extract of H. perforatum inhibited [3H]5-HT accumulation in rat brain cortical synaptosomes with an IC50 value of 7.9 microg/ml. The IC50 of pure hyperforin was 1.8 microg/ml, so the activity of the total extract is not related only to its hyperforin content (<5%). This inhibitory effect, however, is not due to a direct interaction with, and blockade of, the 5-HT transporters since the extract, like hyperforin, did not inhibit [3H]citalopram binding (IC50 > 100 microg/ml and 10 microg/ml, respectively). We also found that 3-10 microg/ml of the extract, or 0.3-1 microg/ml hyperforin, induced marked tritium release from superfused synaptosomes previously loaded with [3H]5-HT. The releasing effect of the extract resembles the releasing effect of a reserpine-like compound (Ro 04-1284), i.e. it was slightly delayed and was 5-HT carrier- and calcium-independent. These data suggest that the hydromethanolic extract of H. peforatum, similarly to Ro 04-1284, rapidly depletes storage vesicles, raising the cytoplasmic concentration of 5-HT, and this increase is presumably responsible for the apparent inhibition of [3H]5-HT uptake. Therefore, our in vitro data do not confirm that the hydromethanolic extract of H. perforatum acts as a classical 5-HT uptake inhibitor but indicate reserpine-like properties. However, the concentrations of the active component(s) effective in vitro as reserpine-like agent(s) (i.e. corresponding to > or =3 microg/ml of the hydromethanolic extract) do not seem to be achieved in the brain after pharmacologically effective doses of the extract, as indicated by the finding that there were no significant changes of rat brain 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels after a schedule of treatment (3 x 300 mg/kgday, orally) active in an animal model predictive of antidepressant-like activity. These data also suggest that the antidepressant effect of H. perforatum extracts is unlikely to be associated with interaction with GABA, benzodiazepine and 5-HT1 receptors since, in receptor binding studies, we found IC50 values higher than 5 microg/ml. Therefore other, still unknown, mechanisms are possibly involved in H. perforatum antidepressant effects.",

    "152": "The term \"neurosteroids\" applies to those steroids that are both formed in the nervous system from sterol precursors, and accumulate in the nervous system, at least in part, independently of peripheral steroidogenic glands secretion. Neurosteroids that are active on the central nervous system include, mainly, pregnenolone (PREG), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and their sulfate esters (PREG-S and DHEA-S), as well as the reduced metabolite of progesterone, 3 alpha,5 alpha-TH PROG also called allopregnanolone. These neuroactive neurosteroids alter neuronal excitability by modulating the activity of several neurotransmitter receptors and thus can influence behavior. PREG-S decreases the sleeping time in rats anesthetized with a barbiturate, which is consistent with its antagonist action on the GABAA receptor (GABAA-R). Allopregnanolone is anxiolytic in rats tested in a conflict paradigm, through an interaction at a site specific for the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor inverse agonist RO15-4513 and/or at the picrotoxinin site on GABAA-R. The contribution of the amygdala, a key region involved in the control of anxiety, is also demonstrated for the anxiolytic action of allopregnanolone. An anti-agressive effect of DHEA can be observed in castrated male mice who become agressive in the presence of lactating females. This inhibition of agressiveness by DHEA is associated to a selective decrease in the brain of PREG-S, which may, in turn, trigger an increase of endogenous GABAergic tone. Finally, cognitive performances of aged rats tested in the Morris water maze and the Y-maze can be correlated with individual concentrations of PREG-S in the hippocampus, i.e. poor performance in both tasks with low levels of PREG-S. Remarkably, the memory deficits are significantly improved, albeit transiently, by an intra-hippocampal injection of PREG-S in impaired aged rats. Promnesiant PREG-S may then reinforce some neurotransmitter systems that can decline with age. This brief review provides evidence of the pharmacology and physiological correlates of neurosteroids involved in behavioral phenomena. However, neurobiological mechanisms of behavioral effects of neurosteroids await further investigation."
