    "4": "Animal and in vitro data suggest that Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) may modulate CYP3A4 activity. As such, GBE may alter the exposure of HIV protease inhibitors metabolized by CYP3A4. It is also possible that GBE could alter protease inhibitor pharmacokinetics (PK) secondary to modulation of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of GBE on the exposure of lopinavir in healthy volunteers administered lopinavir/ritonavir. Secondary objectives were to compare ritonavir exposure pre- and post-GBE, and assess the effect of GBE on single doses of probe drugs midazolam and fexofenadine.",

However, there was no change in the exposure of lopinavir, likely due to ritonavir's potent inhibition of CYP3A4. Thus, GBE appears unlikely to reduce the exposure of ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors, while concentrations of unboosted protease inhibitors may be affected. Limitations to our study include the single sequence design and the evaluation of a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor exclusively.", 
    "8": "Ginsenosides are regarded as the main active, non-volatile components of Panax ginseng (C. A. Meyer). However, throughout the long history of ginseng research, there has been virtually no report describing its volatile flavor compounds. A solvent-free procedure for the determination of volatile flavor compounds generated from fresh, white and red Panax ginseng (C. A. Meyer) using solvent-free solid injection (SFSI) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) detection is described here. At no point in the SFSI technique were the extraction conditions optimized. Rather, the experimental variables including various sample preparations (fresh, oven-dried and freeze-dried), injector temperatures (100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 degrees C), and preheating times (3, 5, 7, 10 and 15 min), were predicated on the experience of the authors. A total of 47 compounds were identified in various forms of ginseng. Among the compounds identified in the sample, fresh ginseng was characterized by a high proportion of 3-acetyl-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-ethyl-4,5-dihydro-7,8-dimethoxy-4-methylene-3H-2,3-benzodiazepine (64.24%) and 23,24-dinor-3-oxolean-4,12-dien-28-oic acid (21.42%); 2-furanmethanol (20.26%) and 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyran-4-one (17.95%) were detected as the major components in white ginseng while the main components of the red ginseng were found to be 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid dibutyl ester (16.27%) and 2-furanmethanol (13.82%). SFSI is a solvent-free, rapid and simple sample preparation technique based on direct vaporization. There is no dilution or contamination with solvent or its impurities and no loss of quickly eluted components was observed in the solvent peak.",

Median time to discontinuation was 120 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 105-135), longer for olanzapine (150 days; 95% CI, 120-180) than risperidone (90 days; 95% CI, 71-109) (P = 0.04).

    "18": "To thoroughly investigate the phenomenon of atypical antipsychotic-associated weight gain, a feeding laboratory paradigm was developed that included obtaining plasma levels of the orexigenic peptide ghrelin that is associated with appetite and eating. This study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial comparing the effects of a 2-week exposure to olanzapine, risperidone, or placebo on plasma ghrelin area under the plasma-time curve (AUC) in 28 healthy human subjects. Subjects were randomized to receive olanzapine, risperidone, or placebo and titrated over 4 days to 10 mg/d or 4 mg/d, respectively. The mean dose at end point was 8.6 + 1.8 mg/d for the olanzapine group and 2.8 + 0.8 mg/d for the risperidone group. Weight changes were significantly different between groups at end point (F2,44 = 10.193; P = 0.0001). The olanzapine group demonstrated a significant increase in weight at end point (2.25 + 1.84 kg) compared with placebo (0.13 + 1.05 kg; P = 0.007). Because of the small subject number, the comparisons between olanzapine and risperidone and risperidone and placebo did not reach statistical significance, although olanzapine's mean weight gain was numerically greater than that of risperidone (2.25 + 1.84 kg vs 1.10 + 0.99 kg) and risperidone's mean weight gain was numerically larger than placebo (1.10 + 0.99 kg vs 0.13 + 1.05 kg). The baseline adjusted Bonferroni corrected contrast of end point ghrelin AUC demonstrated a significant difference between groups (F2,24 = 4.40; P = 0.024), and the post hoc analysis revealed a significant decrease in ghrelin AUC for the olanzapine group in comparison with the risperidone group (P = 0.021) but not between risperidone and placebo or olanzapine and placebo. Ghrelin AUC values did not change significantly from baseline to end point in either of the other 2 groups. The difference between groups approached but did not reach significance (F2,23 = 3.299; P = 0.055) when body mass index change was included as a covariate, suggesting that the difference in ghrelin AUC change followed the change in body weight. Sedation associated with both active drugs (P = 0.006) and \"stuffy nose\" associated with risperidone (P = 0.020) were the only statistically different adverse reactions when compared with placebo. Thus, a human feeding laboratory paradigm using a brief exposure to atypical antipsychotics functions as a method to investigate pharmacologically induced weight gain and its association with changes in the orexigenic peptide ghrelin. This rejects the hypothesis that ghrelin levels are elevated by the antipsychotic and that this is a potential cause of the weight gain phenomenon.", 
    "19": "For some malignant cancers even combined surgical, radiotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic approaches are not curative, indeed, in certain tumour types even a modest survival benefit is difficult to achieve. There are various biological reasons which underlie this profound resistance but the propensity of cancer cells to repair breaks caused by DNA-damaging radiation and cytotoxic drugs is of major significance in this context. Such highly resistant tumours include the malignant gliomas which are intrinsic to and directly affect the brain and spinal cord. In evaluating approaches which do not elicit tumour cell death directly by DNA damage, it is intriguing to consider mitochondrially mediated apoptosis as a potentially effective alternative. Since the mitochondrial membrane potentials in cancer cells are frequently reduced in comparison with those of non-neoplastic cells this allows a window of opportunity for small molecule agents to enter the tumour cell mitochondria and reduce oxygen consumption with subsequent release of cytochrome c and activation of a caspase pathway to apoptosis which is cancer cell specific. In the quest for agents which can selectively destroy neoplastic cells in this manner, whilst leaving normal adjacent cells intact, various tricyclic drugs have come under scrutiny. In a range of laboratory assays we, and others, have established that certain cancers and, in particular, malignant glioma, are intrinsically sensitive to this approach. We have also established the cellular, molecular and biochemical mechanisms underlying this process. While such archival tricyclics as the antidepressants, clomipramine and amitriptyline, have been used in these experiments their commercial development in cancer therapy has not been forthcoming and their clinical use in glioma has been confined to anecdotal cases. In addition, the dose-dependant role of agents such as anticonvulsants and steroids commonly used in glioma patients in modulating efficacy of the tricyclics is a matter for continued investigation. Other ways of targeting the mitochondrion for cancer therapy include exploitation of the 18kDa translocator protein (peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor) within the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and enzymatic or molecular modification of a species of ganglioside (GD3/GD3(A)) expressed on the surface of neoplastic cells which are determinants of mitochondrially mediated apoptosis. It is hoped that such approaches may lead to clinical programmes which will improve the prognosis for patients suffering from highly resistant neoplasms.",

Among the respondents, physicians with adequate knowledge about clinical use of and restrictive prescription attitudes towards z-hypnotics and benzodiazepines prescribed these drugs with a lower frequency. Prescription rates did not vary as a function of sex, geographical localization, work experience or knowledge about drug pharmacodynamics. A total of 56% of the respondents preferred zopiclone to zolpidem, whereas 8% preferred zolpidem. Many of the factors, which were used to justify the preferences, were irrelevant or erroneous.",

    "28": "Inflammatory diseases and neuropathic insults are frequently accompanied by severe and debilitating pain, which can become chronic and often unresponsive to conventional analgesic treatment. A loss of synaptic inhibition in the spinal dorsal horn is considered to contribute significantly to this pain pathology. Facilitation of spinal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurotransmission through modulation of GABA(A) receptors should be able to compensate for this loss. With the use of GABA(A)-receptor point-mutated knock-in mice in which specific GABA(A) receptor subtypes have been selectively rendered insensitive to benzodiazepine-site ligands, we show here that pronounced analgesia can be achieved by specifically targeting spinal GABA(A) receptors containing the alpha2 and/or alpha3 subunits. We show that their selective activation by the non-sedative ('alpha1-sparing') benzodiazepine-site ligand L-838,417 (ref. 13) is highly effective against inflammatory and neuropathic pain yet devoid of unwanted sedation, motor impairment and tolerance development. L-838,417 not only diminished the nociceptive input to the brain but also reduced the activity of brain areas related to the associative-emotional components of pain, as shown by functional magnetic resonance imaging in rats. These results provide a rational basis for the development of subtype-selective GABAergic drugs for the treatment of chronic pain, which is often refractory to classical analgesics.", 
    "29": "AC-5216, a ligand for the translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO), previously called the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), produces anxiolytic-like effects mediated by TSPO in animal models of anxiety. Since stimulation of TSPO is considered to promote the synthesis of neurosteroids, we investigated the possible role of endogenous neurosteroids that positively act on the GABA(A) receptor in the anxiolytic-like effects of AC-5216. In our experiments, the effects of trilostane and finasteride, two inhibitors of steroidogenic enzymes, and picrotoxin, a GABA(A) receptor-gated Cl(-) channel blocker, on the anxiolytic-like effects of AC-5216 were examined in the social interaction test in mice. Also, the anxiolytic-like effects of allopregnanolone and progesterone were examined. The anxiolytic-like effects of AC-5216 (0.1 mg/kg, p.o.) were inhibited by trilostane (10-30 mg/kg, s.c.), finasteride (10-30 mg/kg, s.c.), and picrotoxin (0.03-0.3 mg/kg, s.c.), while those of diazepam (0.1 mg/kg, p.o.) were inhibited by picrotoxin only. The anxiolytic-like effects of progesterone (1-3 mg/kg, s.c.) were inhibited by finasteride (3-30 mg/kg) and picrotoxin (0.1-0.3 mg/kg), although those of allopregnanolone (10 mg/kg, s.c.) were inhibited by picrotoxin only. These results demonstrate that the anxiolytic-like effects of AC-5216 are due to newly synthesized neurosteroids that enhance GABA(A) receptor function.", 
    "30": "Response to antipsychotics is highly variable, which may be due in part to differences in drug exposure. The goal of this study was to evaluate the magnitude and variability of concentration exposure of olanzapine. Patients with Alzheimer's disease (n = 117) and schizophrenia (n = 406) were treated with olanzapine as part of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE). Combined, these patients (n = 523) provided 1527 plasma samples for determination of olanzapine concentrations. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was used to determine the population pharmacokinetics of olanzapine, and patient-specific covariates were evaluated as potential contributors to variability in drug exposure. The population mean olanzapine clearance and volume of distribution were 16.1 L/h and 2150 L, respectively. Elimination of olanzapine varied nearly 10-fold (range, 6.66-67.96 L/h). Smoking status, sex, and race accounted for 26%, 12%, and 7% of the variability, respectively (P < .0001). Smokers cleared olanzapine 55% faster than non/past smokers (P < .0001). Men cleared olanzapine 38% faster than women (P < .0001). Patients who identified themselves as black or African American cleared olanzapine 26% faster than other races (P < .0001). Differences in olanzapine exposure due to sex, race, and smoking may account for some of the variability in response to olanzapine.",

He was hospitalized to clarify the nature and aetiology of these attacks. Multiple stereotyped events were observed by different medical personnel, lasting up to two hours in duration. An attack was terminated by the administration of intravenous diazepam. Subsequent initiation of anti-epileptic drugs led to the complete abolition of these episodes. He has remained event-free since then ie two years. Because of multiple co-morbidities, the elderly present a greater diagnostic challenge in the evaluation of paroxysmal alterations in sensorium.

    "53": "This study was conducted to show that catatonia is a predisposing factor for neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and to review the nosological relationship between catatonia and NMS. Seventeen consecutive cases of NMS were analyzed prospectively with reference to clinical and investigative findings before and after exposure to a neuroleptic. The series comprised eight males and nine females, ranging in age from 18 years to 65 years. Prior to neuroleptic exposure, all patients exhibited features compatible with criteria for catatonia (mutism/excitement) according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition-Revised, (DSM-III-R). Following neuroleptic administration (single dose in nine cases), patients deteriorated into a febrile, rigid, and obtunded state accompanied by autonomic dysfunction and raised creatine phosphokinase levels. These features were consistent with a diagnosis of NMS. Neuroleptics were discontinued and supportive medical treatment instituted. Benzodiazepines were beneficial in eight cases in relieving stupor, but bromocriptine and dantrolene were generally ineffective. In all patients diagnosed with NMS in the authors' series, catatonia was an invariable prodromal state. It appears that the administration of a neuroleptic intensified the preexisting catatonic state and precipitated a malignant variant of the disorder, which is currently recognized as NMS. The authors, therefore, challenge the separate nosological status of NMS and catatonia and suggest that these syndromes are part of a unitary pathophysiological disorder.",

All received lorazepam or related benzodiazepines within 24 hours of NMS onset or hospital admission. The records were reviewed for resolution of clinical signs of NMS. Rigidity and fever abated within 24-48 hours, while secondary features of NMS were relieved within 64 hours. These results compared favorably with prior reports of 5-day to 10-day recovery periods.

Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the strength of the association, which was expressed as reporting odds ratios (RORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).", 
    "57": "Overall, the use of antidepressants was associated with hyperglycaemia [ROR 1.52 (95% CI: 1.20-1.93)] and of hypoglycaemia [ROR 1.84 (95% CI: 1.40-2.42)]. The association with hyperglycaemia was most pronounced for antidepressants with affinity for the 5-HT(2c) receptor, histamine-(1) receptor and norepinephrinic (NE) reuptake transporter. The association with hypoglycaemia was most pronounced for antidepressants with affinity for the serotonin reuptake transporter.",

The LC separation was achieved on a Lichrospher 100 RP-180, C18 column (250 mm, 4.0 mm id, 5 microm) using 0.05 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (pH 5.6 adjusted with o-phosphoric acid)-acetonitrile (50 + 50, v/v) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and ambient temperature. The TLC separation was achieved on aluminum sheets coated with silica gel 60F254 using methanol-toluene (40 + 20, v/v) as the mobile phase. Quantitation was achieved by measuring ultraviolet absorption at 233 nm over the concentration range of 10-70 and 40-280 microg/mL with mean recovery of 99.54 +/- 0.89 and 99.73 +/- 0.58% for olanzapine and fluoxetine, respectively, by the LC method. Quantitation was achieved by measuring ultraviolet absorption at 233 nm over the concentration range of 100-800 and 400-3200 ng/spot with mean recovery of 101.53 +/- 0.06 and 101.45 +/- 0.35% for olanzapine and fluoxetine, respectively, by the TLC method with densitometry.

Our study was designed to address the following questions: (1) Is it possible to achieve steady-state receptor occupancy levels administering neuroleptics in drinking water? (2) Is there an appropriate dose to obtain clinically comparable receptor occupancies? (3) Is there a correlation between plasma drug levels and receptor occupancy? Thus, we tested three neuroleptic drugs administered in drinking water for 7 days. Plasma drug levels were measured, and in vivo receptor occupancy assays were performed in order to determine peak and trough dopamine D(2) receptor occupancies in striatal brain samples. Overall, our study indicates that in rodents the administration of appropriate doses of haloperidol and olanzapine in drinking water achieves receptor occupancies comparable to the clinical occupancy levels, but this appears not to be the case for clozapine.",

In the adjusted logistic model, variables related to suicide included: lower socioeconomic status, depression/psychosis, neurosis, stroke, cancer, liver disease, parasuicide, benzodiazepine use, narcotic pain killer use and diuretic use. There was an elevated risk for those prescribed inappropriate benzodiazepines and for those using strong narcotic pain killers.",

    "77": "There were no significant differences between treatment groups in time to all-cause treatment discontinuation among patients who use illicit drugs (median 3.3 to 6.8 months). Among non-users time to treatment discontinuation was significantly longer for patients treated with olanzapine (median 13.0 months) than perphenazine ( 5.9 months), risperidone (5.6 months), or quetiapine (5.0 months); time to discontinuation for ziprasidone (4.3 months) was even shorter, although the latter difference was not significant. The difference between risperidone and quetiapine, although small, was significant. All remaining differences were non-significant. Similar results were found for discontinuation due to inefficacy. There were no differences between illicit users and non-users in symptom reduction and global improvement, after adjustment for differential duration of treatment. Differences in discontinuation results were attenuated by non-compliance, but the trends persisted after controlling for treatment compliance.",

Sudden onset of symptoms, incontinence/inappropriate toiletting, and denudativeness are distinctive features of the syndrome. Consistent and significant benefit was seen with ECT. In many cases, high dose benzodiazepines were helpful. In a small number of cases, clozapine was also beneficial but this effect took an average of four weeks to be seen, while atypical antipsychotics, lithium and valproate produced variable results and took an average of three and a half weeks to work, if at all. Typical antipsychotics and anticholinergic drugs led to clinical worsening.", 
    "82": "Most patients were on more than one medication and hence treatment responses cannot be definitively ascribed to a specific intervention. Studies of larger groups of such patients in different clinical settings need to be done to confirm our observations.", 
    "83": "Delirious mania is a severe psychiatric syndrome which can be accurately recognized and effectively treated. The definitive treatment for this condition is ECT. In cases where ECT is not available, high dose benzodiazepines should be used. Clozapine, quetiapine, lithium and valproate cannot be considered first-line treatments and these medications take an unacceptably long time to work even when helpful; typical antipsychotics and anticholinergic drugs should be avoided.", 
    "84": "Problems with the voluntary control of behavior, such as those leading to increased antisaccade errors, are accepted as evidence of prefrontal dysfunction in schizophrenia. We previously reported that speeded prosaccade responses, i.e., shorter response latencies for automatic shifts of attention to visual targets, were associated with higher antisaccade error rates in schizophrenia. This suggests that dysregulation of automatic attentional processes may contribute to disturbances in prefrontally mediated control of voluntary behavior.", 
    "85": "Twenty-four antipsychotic-na\u00efve schizophrenia patients and 30 healthy individuals completed three tasks: a no-gap prosaccade task in which subjects shifted gaze toward a peripheral target that appeared coincident with the disappearance of a central fixation target and separate prosaccade and antisaccade tasks in which a temporal gap or overlap of the central target offset and peripheral target onset occurred. Sixteen patients were retested after 6 weeks of antipsychotic treatment.", 
    "86": "Patients' prosaccade latencies in the no-gap task were speeded compared with healthy individuals. While patients were not atypical in the degree to which response latencies were speeded or slowed by the gap and overlap manipulations, those patients with diminished attentional engagement on the prosaccade task (i.e., reduced overlap effect) had significantly elevated antisaccade error rates. This effect persisted in patients evaluated after antipsychotic treatment.", 
    "87": "This study provides evidence that a reduced ability to engage attention may render patients more distracted by sensory inputs, thereby further compromising impaired executive control during antisaccade tasks. Thus, alterations in attentional and executive control functions can synergistically disrupt voluntary behavioral responses in schizophrenia.", 
    "88": "We evaluated the effects of increasing concentrations of the flavonoids salvigenin, diosmetin and luteolin on the in vitro metabolism of midazolam (MDZ), a probe substrate for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A enzymes, which is converted into 1'-hydroxy-midazolam (1'-OH-MDZ) and 4-hydroxy-midazolam (4-OH-MDZ) by human liver microsomes. Salvigenin had only a modest effect on MDZ metabolism, whereas diosmetin and luteolin inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the formation of both 1'-OH-MDZ and 4-OH-MDZ, with apparent K(i) values in the 30-50mumol range. Both diosmetin and luteolin decreased 1'-OH-MDZ formation by human recombinant CYP3A4, but not CYP3A5, whereas they decreased 4-OH-MDZ formation by both recombinant enzymes. To assess whether any relationship exists between the physico-chemical characteristics of flavones and their effects on MDZ metabolism, we tested the effects of three other flavones (flavone, tangeretin, chrysin) on MDZ metabolism by human liver microsomes. Whereas flavones possessing more than two hydroxyl groups (luteolin, diosmetin) inhibited MDZ biotransformation, flavones lacking hydroxyl groups in their A and B rings (flavone, tangeretin) stimulated MDZ metabolism. We also found close relationships between the maximum stimulatory or inhibitory effects of flavones on 1'-OH-MDZ and 4-OH-MDZ formation rates and their log of octanol/water partition coefficients (logP) or their total number of hydroxyl groups. The results of the study may be of clinical relevance since they suggest that luteolin and diosmetin may cause pharmacokinetic interactions with co-administered drugs metabolized via CYP3A.", 
    "89": "The anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines are reduced after a single exposure of rats to elevated plus-maze test (EPM). Midazolam showed an anxioselective profile in animals submitted to one session (T1) but did not change the usual exploratory behavior of rats exposed twice (T2) to the EPM. In this study we examined further the one-trial tolerance by performing a factor analysis of the exploratory behavior of rats injected with saline before both trials as well as an immunohistochemistry study for quantification of Fos expression in encephalic structures after these sessions. Factor analysis of all behavioral categories revealed that factor 1 consisted of anxiety-related categories in T1 whereas these same behavioral categories loaded on factor 2 in T2. Risk assessment was also dissociated as it loaded stronger on T2 (factor 3) than on T1 (factor 4). Locomotor activity in T1 loaded on factor 5. Immunohistochemistry analyses showed that Fos expression predominated in limbic structures in T1 group. The medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala were the main areas activated in T2 group. These data suggest that anxiety and risk assessment behaviors change their valence across the EPM sessions. T2 is characterized by the emergence of a fear factor, more powerful risk assessment and medial prefrontal cortex activation. The amygdala functions as a switch between the anxiety-like patterns of T1 to the cognitive control of fear prevalent in T2. The EPM retest session is proposed as a tool for assessing the cognitive activity of rodents in the control of fear.", 
    "90": "P-glycoprotein mediated drug transport may lead to a multidrug resistance phenotype often associated with a poor response to the successful treatment of a variety of human disorders. Several agents have been found to modulate P-glycoprotein drug resistance, most probably by blocking its transport function. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of some benzodiazepines (bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and flurazepam) able to bind to P-glycoprotein in proteoliposomes on its transport function and ATPase activity in the human cancer cell line, KB-V1. The toxicity of the benzodiazepines drugs towards KB-V1 cells was first evaluated and the non toxic drugs concentrations were used to assess the drug efflux and the ATPase activity. Using the flow cytometry approach, the accumulation and efflux of daunorubicin were followed by measuring the daunorubicin associated geometric mean fluorescence intensity. Vanadate was employed as a comparative inhibitory compound. Flurazepam was able to inhibit the daunorubicin efflux in 80%. ATPase activity determined by a colorimetric assay revealed that flurazepam inhibits the P-glycoprotein enzymatic activity, indicating coupling between drug transport and ATP hydrolysis. Bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam behaved as activators of the P-glycoprotein ATPase activity, suggesting a role as transported substrates and did not interfere in the daunorubicin transport.", 
    "91": "Maternal separation (MS) during the neonatal period enhances stress responsivity in adulthood. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) are involved in coordinating various stress responses. Evidence indicates that MS reduces benzodiazepine and GABA(A) receptor expression in these regions, although their effects on neuronal function in the mPFC and the BLA remain unknown. The present study was conducted to assess the effects of MS on neuronal activity in the mPFC and BLA in response to the benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG-7142). Rat pups were subjected to MS (360 min), brief handling (H; 15 min) or standard animal facility rearing (AFR) on postnatal days 2-14. In adult males, in vivo electrophysiology under isoflurane anesthesia was used to conduct acute recordings of extracellular unit activity in response to systemic FG-7142 administration. Animals subjected to H showed significantly increased basal mPFC activity compared to MS and AFR animals. There were no differences in basal BLA activity between the early rearing groups. In response to FG-7142, MS animals showed significantly attenuated mPFC activity compared to H animals and a nonsignificant trend towards attenuated mPFC activity compared to AFR animals. In contrast to mPFC, MS animals showed significantly potentiated FG-7142-induced activity in the BLA, compared to both H and AFR animals. These findings indicate that MS induces functionally relevant alterations in corticolimbic GABA(A) receptor signaling. Given that FG-7142 mimics several behavioral and physiological effects of stress, these results may also model stress-induced corticolimbic dysfunction caused by early life stress.", 
    "92": "Gliomas are one of the most malignant cancers. The molecular bases regulating the onset of such tumors are still poorly understood. The translocator protein (TSPO), formerly known as the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, is a mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT)-pore protein robustly expressed in gliomas and involved in the regulation of apoptosis and cell proliferation. TSPO expression levels have been correlated with tumor malignancy. Here we describe the production of C6 rat glioma cells engineered to over-express the TSPO protein with the aim of providing the first direct evidence of a correlation between TSPO expression level and glioma cell aggressiveness. We observed that TSPO potentiates proliferation, motility and transmigration capabilities as well as the ability to overcome contact-induced cell growth inhibition of glioma cells. On the whole, these data demonstrate that TSPO density influences metastatic potential of glioma cells. Since several data suggest that TSPO ligands may act as chemotherapeutic agents, in this paper we also demonstrate that TSPO ligand-induced cell death is dependent on TSPO density. These findings suggest that the use of TSPO ligands as chemotherapeutic agents could be effective on aggressive tumor cells with a high TSPO expression level.",

    "97": "Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy can be a painful procedure. Sedation techniques may make this investigation more acceptable to patients, but have the potential to cause life-threatening complications, as well as requiring additional staff and equipment for safe administration. We assessed the use of Entonox, a 50 : 50 mix of nitrous oxide and oxygen, as a sedation and analgesic agent, and compared it to previous experience with the intravenous (i.v.) benzodiazepine midazolam. Patients' perception of pain, and both the operator and patient's views on the ease of the procedure and safety factors were recorded. Twenty-two patients who had previously required i.v. midazolam sedation (16), or who requested sedation (6) were studied. Fifteen of 16 (94%) found Entonox better or equal to midazolam, and only one patient (6%) found it worse. There were no serious adverse events due to Entonox. We have shown, in this small group of patients, that Entonox is an effective, safe alternative to intravenous midazolam for sedation during bone marrow biopsy, and is considered acceptable by both patients and staff. It has the major advantage that no additional staff or facilities are required for safe administration or monitoring the patient during or after the procedure.",

    "103": "Although benzodiazepines are the recommended first-line therapy for the prevention of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), the administration of intravenous ethanol as an alternative prophylactic agent persists in many surgical ICUs. Advocates of this therapy argue that ethanol provides effective prophylaxis against AWS without the excessive sedation observed with benzodiazepine therapy. No study to date, however, has compared the two therapies with regard to their sedative effects. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of intravenous ethanol compared with benzodiazepines for the prevention of AWS with particular emphasis on the sedative effects of each therapy.",

Patients were evaluated with the Riker sedation-agitation scale, a 7-point instrument for the subjective assessment of both sedation (1 = unarousable) and agitation (7 = dangerous agitation). According to protocol, regimens were titrated to achieve and maintain a Riker score of 4 (calm and cooperative). Deviation from a score of 4 during the course of treatment was compared between groups.",

Overall, the EtOH group had a significantly greater proportion of patients who deviated from a score of 4 during the course of treatment (p = 0.020). In both groups, the majority of deviation from a score of 4 reflected periods of under-sedation rather than over-sedation. One patient in the EtOH group failed treatment, requiring diazepam and haloperidol for control of AWS symptoms as per protocol, whereas no patient in the BENZO group failed treatment (p = NS).",

    "107": "Research suggests that methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)/;ecstasy' can cause serotonin depletion as well as serotonergic neurodegradation that may result in depression. This longitudinal study used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) to assess depressive symptomatology every six months over a two-year period among a community sample of young adult MDMA/;ecstasy' users (n = 402). Multilevel growth modeling was used to analyze changes in BDI scores. Between baseline and 24 months, the mean BDI score declined from 9.8 to 7.7. Scores varied significantly across individuals at baseline and declined at a rate of 0.36 points every six months. Persons with higher baseline scores were more likely to have their scores decrease over time. Several factors were significantly associated with score levels, independent of time: gender - men's scores were lower than women's; ethnicity - whites' scores were lower than those of non-whites; education - persons with at least some university education had scores that were lower than those without any college experience; benzodiazepines - current users' scores were higher than non-users'; opioids - current users' scores were higher than non-users'; and cumulative ecstasy use - people who had used MDMA more than 50 times had scores that were higher than persons who had used the drug less often. The results reported here show low levels of depressive symptoms among a sample that, after 24 months, consisted of both current and former MDMA users. The low and declining mean scores suggest that for most people MDMA/;ecstasy' use does not result in long-term depressive symptomatology.", 
    "108": "The use of non-selective gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) enhancers, such as benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety disorders is still widespread but hampered by unfavourable side effects. some of these may be associated with binding properties to certain subtypes of the GABA(A) receptor that are unnecessary for therapeutic effects. MK-0343 was designed to be a less sedating anxiolytic, based on reduced efficacy at the alpha1 subtype and significant efficacy at alpha2 and alpha3 subtypes of the GABA(A) receptor. This paper is a double-blind, four-way cross-over (n = 12) study to investigate the effects of MK-0343 (0.25 and 0.75 mg) in comparison to placebo and an anxiolytic dose (2 mg) of the non-selective agonist lorazepam. Effects were measured by eye movements, body sway, Visual Analogue scales (VAS) and memory tests. Lorazepam impaired saccadic peak velocity (SPV), VAs alertness scores, postural stability and memory and increased saccadic latency and inaccuracy. MK-0343 0.75 mg was equipotent with lorazepam as indicated by SPV (-42.4 deg/s), saccadic latency (0.02 s) and VAS alertness scores (1.50 ln mm), while effects on memory and postural stability were smaller. MK-0343 0.25 mg only affected postural stability to a similar extent as MK-0343 0.75 mg. The effect profile of MK-0343 0.75 mg is different from the full agonist lorazepam, which could reflect the selective actions of this compound. Although less effect on VAS alertness was expected, diminished effects on memory and postural stability were present. Clinical studies in anxiety patients should show whether this dose of MK-0343 is therapeutically effective with a different side-effect profile.", 
    "109": "In order to determine whether functional neuroimaging studies can predict the prognosis of hemianopia due to organic cerebral disorders, we studied 8 patients (6 men and 2 women; age, 56.0+/-8.6 years) with homonymous hemianopia and compared them with 15 normal subjects (6 men and 9 women; age, 54.3+/-4.4 years). The cerebral glucose metabolism and 11C-flumazenil (FMZ) binding were measured by positron emission tomography, more than 1 month after the onset of the condition. Bilateral regions of interest (ROIs) were selected in the striate cortex, extrastriate cortex, cuneus and thalamus. Further, semi-quantitative data on the cerebral glucose metabolism and FMZ binding were obtained for the ROIs and compared with the data obtained for homologous regions in the contralateral hemisphere by calculating the ipsilateral/contralateral (I/C) ratio. The I/C ratios for the cerebral glucose metabolism and FMZ binding in the striate cortex were significantly low in the patients (glucose metabolism, P<0.0005; FMZ binding, P<0.005), while the ratio for the FMZ binding in the cuneus increased (P<0.0005). We observed that 5 patients, whose I/C ratio for the FMZ binding in the striate cortex was >0.850, experienced an improvement in their visual field, while that 3 patients with lower I/C ratios did not. The FMZ-PET may be useful to predict the prognosis of hemianopia in the chronic phase.", 
    "110": "Delirium occurs frequently in hospitalized patients and is reported to occur at a rate of 10% to 40% in hospitalized elderly patients. The gold standard of treatment is to treat the underlying cause of delirium and use high-potency antipsychotics such as haloperidol to target the behavioral disturbances. Since the development of atypical antipsychotics, many psychiatric conditions that were previously only treatable using high-potency antipsychotics may now be managed with the atypical agents. This review will examine the current literature on atypical antipsychotics and summarize the results from published trials in order to evaluate the efficacy and potential benefits of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of delirium in the elderly population.",

Studies of olanzapine indicated that it was approximately 70% to 76% effective in treating delirium at doses of 2.5 to 11.6 mg daily. Very few studies have been conducted using quetiapine; it also appears to be a safe and effective alternative to high-potency antipsychotics. In comparison to haloperidol, the frequency of adverse reactions and side effects was found to be much lower with the use of atypical antipsychotic medications. In the limited number of trials comparing atypical antipsychotics to haloperidol, haloperidol consistently produced a higher rate (an additional 10% to 13%) of extrapyramidal side effects.",

The trial was a prospective study. This study shows that long-term treatment with rivastigmine, at dosages approved for therapeutic use in Alzheimer's disease, produces significant improvement in all behavioral symptoms in 2 forms of VaD, MID and sVaD, except delusions. It also suggests that rivastigmine may enable a reduction in concomitant neuroleptics and benzodiazepines in VaD, especially in MID. The results are discussed with an overview of the literature.", 
    "115": "Use of placebo-controlled trials in medical and psychiatric research has been controversial, although a consensus is emerging about conditions under which placebo-controlled trials are ethical. In schizophrenia research, the paradigm of slow onset of antipsychotic effects has led to a model in which placebo-controlled trials of 6-8 weeks duration have been used to demonstrate efficacy. Recent evidence that the largest symptom reductions are typically seen in the first weeks of treatment suggests that shorter placebo-controlled studies to demonstrate antipsychotic efficacy are possible. In a pilot study of the feasibility of shortening placebo-controlled studies, we reanalyzed data from placebo-controlled registry trials of olanzapine and risperidone and found that trials as short as 4 weeks could have similar power to longer term 6-8 week studies, given the estimated time course of treatment effects. Although fuller evaluation is required, the results suggest future antipsychotic trials could be shortened from 6-8 weeks to 3-4 weeks with a relatively low increase in sample size requirements. Shortening placebo-controlled trials would reduce patient burden and ethical objections to prolonged administration of placebo and reduce potential bias due to high dropout rates in longer clinical trials.",

The specificity of self-reported medication use compared with claims data was consistently high across all drug classes, suggesting that people usually did not mention drugs that were not included in the claims data. Sensitivity values varied according to drug class and retrieval period, and were lower for NSAIDs than for benzodiazepines and thiazide diuretics.

These attenuation correction methods differ in reconstruction and processing (segmentation) algorithms used for generating a micro-image from measured 2D transmission scans, an intermediate step in the generation of 3D attenuation correction factors. Available methods are maximum-a-posteriori reconstruction (MAP-TR), unweighted OSEM (UW-OSEM) and NEC-TR, which transforms sinogram values back to their noise equivalent counts (NEC) to restore Poisson distribution. All methods can be applied with or without micro-image segmentation. However, for MAP-TR a micro-histogram is a prior during reconstruction. All possible strategies were evaluated using phantoms of various sizes, simulating preclinical and clinical situations. Furthermore, effects of emission contamination of the transmission scan on the accuracy of various attenuation correction strategies were studied. Finally, the accuracy of various attenuation corrections strategies and its relative impact on the reconstructed activity concentration (AC) were evaluated using small animal and human brain studies. For small structures, MAP-TR with human brain priors showed smaller differences in micro-values for transmission scans with and without emission contamination (<8%) than the other methods (<26%). In addition, it showed best agreement with true AC (deviation <4.5%). A specific prior designed to take into account the presence of small animal fixation devices only very slightly improved AC precision to 4.3%. All methods scaled micro-values of a large homogeneous phantom to within 4% of the water peak, but MAP-TR provided most accurate AC after reconstruction. However, for clinical data MAP-TR using the default prior settings overestimated the thickness of the skull, resulting in overestimations of micro-values in regions near the skull and thus in incorrect AC for cortical regions. Using NEC-TR with segmentation or MAP-TR with an adjusted human brain prior showed less overestimation in both skull thickness and AC for these structures and are therefore the recommended methods for human brain studies.",

Her epileptic seizures and psychosis disappeared after administration of carbamazepine. She developed dysgraphia for Kanji words (Japanese morphograms). The EEG showed sporadic spikes predominantly in the left occipital region, and [123I]iomazenil single-photon-emission computed tomography (IMZ-SPECT) imaging revealed an area of hypoperfusion in the left occipital lobe. Interestingly, the left posterior inferior temporal area is known to play an important role in writing Kanji words.

OL-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) were prepared using lipids like glyceryl monostearate (GMS), Precirol ATO 5 (PRE), glyceryl tristearate (GTS), and Witepsol E85 (WE 85)--and poloxamer 407 and hydrogenated soya phosphatidylcholine as stabilizers--using a hot melt emulsification high-pressure homogenization technique, and then characterized by particle size analysis, zeta potential, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD). Homogenization at 10,000 psi for 3 cycles resulted in the formation of SLNs with a mean particle size of approximately 190 nm for the 4 lipids investigated. The highest partition coefficient for OL between the melted lipid and pH 7.4 phosphate buffer (pH 7.4 PB) was obtained with GTS. The entrapment efficiency was in the following order: GTS SLNs > PRE SLNs > WE 85 SLNs > GMS SLNs. DSC and pXRD showed that much of the incorporated fraction of OL existed in the amorphous state after incorporation into SLNs. A sharp increase in the flocculation of the SLN dispersions was observed upon addition of 0.6 M aqueous sodium sulfate solution. Nanoparticle surface hydrophobicity was in the following order: GTS SLNs > PRE SLNs > WE 85 SLNs > GMS SLNs. A significant increase in size and zeta potential was observed for GTS SLN and WE 85 SLN dispersions stored at 40 degrees C.

Thus, the aim of the present double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple-ascending-dose study was to investigate the effect of the new compound on event-related potentials (ERPs). In a randomized ascending-dose design for phase-1 studies, 16 young healthy male subjects aged 30.2 +/- 5.7 years received three ascending drug doses (10, 20, and 40 mg) and placebo for 7 days, with a washout period of 8 days in between. Auditory ERPs were recorded pre-dose and 2 h post-dose on days 1 (acute effect) and 5 (subacute and absolute superimposed effect). Descriptive statistics with one confirmatory statement on P300 latency demonstrated a significant shortening after acute, subacute, and superimposed administration of 40 mg ABIO-08/01. While ERP amplitudes showed only minor effects, low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) demonstrated that ABIO-08/01 promotes more efficient information processing by reallocating perceptual and cognitive ERP resources. Thus, our ERP studies confirm early pharmacological findings in animals of a cognition-enhancing effect of ABIO-08/01, which is interesting in the context of the anxiolytic mode of action of the compound as its CNS effects are quite different from those of anxiolytic sedatives, such as benzodiazepines.",

    "147": "Activin, a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, affords neuroprotection in acute brain injury, but its physiological functions in normal adult brain are largely unknown. Using transgenic (tg) mice expressing a dominant-negative activin receptor mutant under the control of the CaMKIIalpha promoter in forebrain neurons, we identified activin as a key regulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic synapses and anxiety-like behavior. In the open field, wild-type (wt) and tg mice did not differ in spontaneous locomotion and exploration behavior. However, tg mice visited inner fields significantly more often than wt mice. In the light-dark exploration test, tg mice made more exits, spent significantly more time on a well-lit elevated bar and went farther away from the dark box as compared to wt mice. In addition, the anxiolytic effect of diazepam was abrogated in tg mice. Thus the disruption of activin receptor signaling produced a low-anxiety phenotype that failed to respond to benzodiazepines. In whole-cell recordings from hippocampal pyramidal cells, enhanced spontaneous GABA release, increased GABA tonus, reduced benzodiazepine sensitivity and augmented GABA(B) receptor function emerged as likely substrates of the low-anxiety phenotype. These data provide strong evidence that activin influences pre- and postsynaptic components of GABAergic synapses in a highly synergistic fashion. Given the crucial role of GABAergic neurotransmission in emotional states, anxiety and depression, dysfunctions of activin receptor signaling could be involved in affective disorders: and drugs affecting this pathway might show promise for psychopharmacological treatment.",

Practically all effects of the benzodiazepines result from their actions on the ionotropic GABA(A) receptors in the central nervous system. Benzodiazepines do not activate GABA(A) receptors directly but they require GABA. The main effects of benzodiazepines are sedation, hypnosis, decreased anxiety, anterograde amnesia, centrally mediated muscle relaxation and anti-convulsant activity. In addition to their action on the central nervous system, benzodiazepines have a dose-dependent ventilatory depressant effect and they also cause a modest reduction in arterial blood pressure and an increase in heart rate as a result of a decrease of systemic vascular resistance. The four benzodiazepines, widely used in clinical anaesthesia, are the agonists midazolam, diazepam and lorazepam and the antagonist flumazenil. Midazolam, diazepam and flumazenil are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and by glucuronide conjugation whereas lorazepam directly undergoes glucuronide conjugation. CYP3A4 is important in the biotransformation of both midazolam and diazepam. CYP2C19 is important in the biotransformation of diazepam. Liver and renal dysfunction have only a minor effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam but they slow down the elimination of the other benzodiazepines used in clinical anaesthesia. The duration of action of all benzodiazepines is strongly dependent on the duration of their administration. Based on clinical studies and computer simulations, midazolam has the shortest recovery profile followed by lorazepam and diazepam. Being metabolized by CYP enzymes, midazolam and diazepam have many clinically significant interactions with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and 2C19. In addition to pharmacokinetic interactions, benzodiazepines have synergistic interactions with other hypnotics and opioids. Midazolam, diazepam and lorazepam are widely used for sedation and to some extent also for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia. Flumazenil is very useful in reversing benzodiazepine-induced sedation as well as to diagnose or treat benzodiazepine overdose.",

    "176": "Drug testing, commonly used in health care, workplace, and criminal settings, has become widespread during the past decade. Urine drug screens have been the most common method for analysis because of ease of sampling. The simplicity of use and access to rapid results have increased demand for and use of immunoassays; however, these assays are not perfect. False-positive results of immunoassays can lead to serious medical or social consequences if results are not confirmed by secondary analysis, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The Department of Health and Human Services' guidelines for the workplace require testing for the following 5 substances: amphetamines, cannabinoids, cocaine, opiates, and phencyclidine. This article discusses potential false-positive results and false-negative results that occur with immunoassays of these substances and with alcohol, benzodiazepines, and tricyclic antidepressants. Other pitfalls, such as adulteration, substitution, and dilution of urine samples, are discussed. Pragmatic concepts summarized in this article should minimize the potential risks of misinterpreting urine drug screens.",

    "179": "There are no prospective, randomized works comparing the effects of anesthetics in the treatment of RSE. Recently, the use of propofol has increased in the treatment of RSE. Propofol terminates both clinical and electric seizures quickly, but the maintenance of burst-suppression EEG pattern requires repetitive titration of doses. Relapses of seizures have occurred in 19-33% of patients, especially when tapering of dose. The advantages of barbiturates are lower frequency of short-term treatment failures, breakthrough seizures and changes to a different anesthetic agent. On the other hand, prolonged recovery leads to prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care and hospital stay.", 
    "180": "The use of propofol, barbiturates or midazolam in the anesthesia of RSE can be justified. When using propofol, the duration of high doses should be limited to 48 hours and the risk of propofol infusion syndrome should be kept in mind. High doses of barbiturates terminate effectively seizures but recovery from anesthesia prolongs ventilator treatment and intensive care.", 
    "181": "Using an 8-week, open label study design, we report the effect of augmentation strategy with olanzapine in hospitalized depressive patients with melancholic features who had insufficient response to a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), amitriptyline. Subjects were hospitalized patients meeting the criteria of DSM-IV major depressive disorder with melancholic features who had been suffering from residual symptoms after treatment of amitriptyline. After study entry, olanzapine was added to amitriptyline and the dose was adjusted according to patients' clinical condition. Data were analyzed using an intent-to-treat methodology, with last observation carried forward. Paired t-test was adopted to assess the data from baseline to endpoint. Of 26 patients who enrolled in this study, 23 patients completed the trial and 3 patients dropped out. The mean dose of olanzapine was 6.5 (SD = 2.4) mg/day. The mean score of Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was significantly decreased from 33.6 (SD = 3.5) to 20.8 (SD = 9.1) during this study (37.9% from baseline) (p < 0.001). Ten patients (38.5%) were considered as responders (50% or greater reduction in MADRS scores from baseline). These results suggest that augmentation with olanzapine in TCAs-resistant melancholia may be effective and well tolerated. We cannot draw any conclusion with certainty from the open-label, uncontrolled clinical trial. Double blind, controlled trial is needed to confirm this preliminary finding.", 
    "182": "Drug binding to albumins from different mammalian species was investigated to disclose evidence of species-dependent stereoselectivity in drug-binding processes and affinities. This aspect is important for evaluating the reliability of extrapolating distribution data among species. The circular dichroism (CD) signal induced by drug binding to the albumins [human serum albumin (HSA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), rat serum albumin (RSA), and dog serum albumin (DSA)] were measured and analyzed. The binding of selected drugs and metabolites to HSA significantly differed from the binding to the other albumins in terms of affinity and conformation of the bound ligands. In particular, phenylbutazone, a marker of site one on HSA, showed a higher affinity for binding to BSA with respect to RSA, HSA, and DSA, respectively. In the case of diazepam, a marker of site two on HSA, the affinity decreased in order from HSA to DSA, RSA, and BSA. The induced CD spectra were similar in terms of energy and band signs, suggesting almost the same conformation for the bound drug to the different albumins. Stereoselectivity was high for the binding of ketoprofen to HSA and RSA. A different sign was observed for the CD spectra induced by the drug to the two albumins because of the prevalence of a different conformation of the bound drug. Interestingly, the same induced CD spectra were obtained using either the racemic form or the (S)-enantiomer. Finally, significant differences were observed in the affinity of bilirubin, being highest for BSA, then decreasing for RSA, HSA, and DSA. A more complex conformational equilibrium was observed for bound bilirubin.", 
    "183": "The cellular basis underlying the complex clinical symptomatology of bipolar disorder and the mechanisms underlying the actions of its effective treatments have not yet been fully elucidated. This study investigated the role of hippocampal synaptic AMPA receptors. We found that chronic administration of the antimanic agents lithium and valproate (VPA) reduced synaptic AMPA receptor GluR1/2 in hippocampal neurons in vitro and in vivo. Electrophysiological studies confirmed that the AMPA/NMDA ratio was reduced in CA1 regions of hippocampal slices from lithium-treated animals. Reduction in GluR1 phosphorylation at its cAMP-dependent protein kinase A site by the synthetic peptide TAT-S845, which mimics the effects of lithium or VPA, was sufficient to attenuate surface and synaptic GluR1/2 levels in hippocampal neurons in vitro and in vivo. Intrahippocampal infusion studies with the AMPA-specific inhibitor GYKI 52466 [4-(8-methyl-9H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepin-5-yl)-benzenamine hydrochloride], a GluR1-specific TAT-S845 peptide, showed that GluR1/2 was essential for the development of manic/hedonic-like behaviors such as amphetamine-induced hyperactivity. These studies provide novel insights into the role of hippocampal GluR1/2 receptors in mediating facets of the manic syndrome and offer avenues for the development of novel therapeutics for these disorders.", 
    "184": "The term \"mood stabilizer\" has been widely used since the early 1990's but it still does not have a uniform and generally accepted definition. Usually, agents that are effective in ameliorating acute manic or depressive episodes and have some prophylactic efficacy against the recurrence of new phases are considered as mood stabilizers. Lithium is unquestionably the prototype drug of this class; others, like some anticonvulsants, have been subsequently added to the list. Recent clinical research indicates that some of the newer second-generation antipsychotics may have very similar properties. In controlled clinical studies of acute manic and mixed episodes, olanzapine has proved to be at least as effective as lithium, divalproex, or haloperidol - often with additional benefits, such as faster onset of action, or wider spectrum of target symptoms. Added to mood stabilizers, olanzapine significantly enhances their antimanic efficacy. It also has intrinsic antidepressant properties; and in combination with fluoxetine, this has resulted in convincing efficacy in bipolar depressive episodes. Long-term maintenance treatment with olanzapine has extended the periods of remission and shown prophylactic efficacy against the recurrence of both manic and depressive episodes that is comparable or, in the case of preventing manic relapses, even superior to lithium. While none of the current agents meet the most stringent criteria for an \"ideal\" mood stabilizer, there is strong evidence that olanzapine, just like lithium, is effective across all phases of bipolar disorder without provoking either manic or depressive symptomatology. Regardless of formal definition criteria, this is exactly what clinicians expect of a dependable mood stabilizer.",

Some of the surviving rats developed delayed, intermittent convulsions. All rats were evaluated for long-term functional deficits in comparison to air-exposed control rats. Histological analysis revealed typical cell loss at 1 week post inhalation exposure.

An additional, delayed increase in PGE(2) was detected at 1 month and continued to increase for up to 6 months post exposure. Glial activation following neural damage was demonstrated by an elevated level of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) seen in the brain 4 and 6 months after exposure. At the same time muscarinic receptors were unaffected. Six weeks, four and six months post exposure behavioral evaluations were performed. In the open field, sarin-exposed rats showed a significant increase in overall activity with no habituation over days. In a working memory paradigm in the water maze, these same rats showed impaired working and reference memory processes with no recovery.

Three weeks after single injection of KA (10 mg kg(-1), sc), the effects of TPM were tested at two doses (10 and 30 mg kg(-1), sc) once a day for 1 week in KA/TPM low dose group or KA/TPM high dose group, respectively. Rats in KA group received comparable injections of saline. Four weeks after initial KA injection, a subconvulsant dose KA (5 mg kg(-1), sc) was administered in rats in these three groups. Rats in saline control group received equal volume of saline. All animals were decapitated and hippocampus synaptosomes were purified 180 min after behavioral observation. PBRs specific binding sites were assessed by an in vitro binding technique utilizing the highly selective ligand [(3)H]PK11195. Seizure threshold was elevated and specific PBRs binding in hippocampus was decreased by TPM in dose-dependent manner. Specific PBRs binding in hippocampus was significantly related to seizure latency and seizure intensity. These results suggest that TPM can reduce the susceptibility to seizures in KA-kindled rats and its anticonvulsant effect seems resulting from, at least in part, the reduced PBRs binding after treatment. These results also support the hypothesis that PBRs represent a novel target for antiepileptic drug development.",

The benzodiazepines represent a deviation from this pattern: they are widely believed to cause depression, but there is a lack of evidence to substantiate this claim. In DSM-IV, there is a category of mood disorder for drug-induced depression (substance-induced mood disorder), and the text of the manual specifically refers to benzodiazepines as a potential cause.

Recent meta-analyses have argued that there are no clinically significant differences between various selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or between SSRIs and other antidepressants. Analysis of large-scale national prescription databases may offer a unique opportunity to see whether this premise holds true in actual practice. National databases however, should be viewed with caution as they reveal only limited information about efficacy and tolerability. Methods. The number of antidepressants prescribed annually (October 2004 to September 2005), as well as the class of drug and the use of any additional psychotropics were obtained from the Israeli subsidiary of Intercontinental Marketing Services (IMS) Health. Results. During the 12-month study period there were 2,107,763 prescriptions of antidepressants reported by IMS in Israel. Compared to other drug classes, the SSRIs were used significantly more often as a sole therapy (chi-square=1343, df=3, P<0.0001). Of the SSRIs, escitalopram was the most frequently prescribed (79%) as monotherapy, followed by fluoxetine with 72% and <70% for the other SSRIs. The most frequently prescribed additional psychotropic was a benzodiazepine, in the range of 38 to nearly 50%. Conclusion. Antidepressants vary significantly in their use as a single (\"monotherapy\") drug. The use of additional psychotropics could reflect either the presence of symptoms not well covered by a particular antidepressant or for addressing side effects particular to a certain class of antidepressants.The premise that all SSRIs are equal is not reflected in this current examination.",

Troponin, CK-MB, CK:MB ratio, full blood count (FBC), urea and electrolytes (U&E), C reactive protein (CRP) and glucose were all normal. Liver enzymes were marginally raised: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 91 iu/l, \u03b3-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 46 iu/l, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 137 iu/l. The ECG was normal and the chest pain later resolved and was thought likely to be due to costochondritis. A repeat blood test on 7 May revealed further elevation of CK at 1391 iu/l and olanzapine was stopped. CK continued to rise: 19 May 2857 iu/l, 20 May 3285 iu/l, and 22 May 3646 iu/l. On 30 May CK dropped to 708 iu/l, on 20 June it was 593 iu/l, and on 30 June CK was 343 iu/l. The patient was started on amisulpiride on 15 July and CK began to rise again: on 18 July it was 445 iu/l and on 31 July CK was 480 iu/l, at which time the medication was stopped. The patient did not have any signs or symptoms of physical disorder on this occasion.We have never seen a patient develop such high CK values in the absence of any clinical or other significant laboratory abnormalities. We can rule out exercise as the cause as he attends an inpatient unit and we are aware that his exercise has been light to moderate at most; also, he stopped exercising at our request on 7 May 2008, yet CK continued to rise. There is no clinical indication of other causes of elevated CK such as myositis, and CK-MB and CK-MB:CK ratio were normal throughout, so it was not cardiac in origin. We believe olanzapine caused the elevated CK value. When the patient was rechallenged with amisulpiride on 15 May his CK again rose and the medication therefore had to be stopped. There are three similar cases that have been reported in the past when patients on second generation antipsychotics developed CK elevation in the absence of other clinical or laboratory abnormalities. We therefore believe this is an important finding to report.",

The sixth group was treated with a single dose of an antagonist alone (atenolol, a \u03b21-selective adrenoceptor antagonist; propranolol, a non selective \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist; and prazocin, an \u03b11-adrenoceptor antagonist). Results confirmed the antidepressant action of alprazolam and imipramine. Prazocin treatment alone produced depression, but it significantly potentiated the antidepressant actions of imipramine and alprazolam. Atenolol alone produced an antidepressant effect and potentiated the antidepressant action of alprazolam. Propranolol treatment alone produced depression, and antagonized the effects of alprazolam and imipramine, even producing depression in combined treatments.In conclusion, our results reveal that alprazolam may produce antidepressant effects through the release of noradrenaline, which stimulates \u03b22 receptors to produce an antidepressant action. Imipramine may act by activating \u03b22 receptors by blocking or down-regulating \u03b21 receptors.",

The neural pathways associated with anxiety are established within the network sustained by diencephalon, cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus. Diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), a peptide consisting of 87 amino acids, serves as an inverse agonist for the type A receptor of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA receptor) with endogenous anxiogenic potential. We examined the effect of chronic administration of MAP on the mRNA expression of DBI and DBI-related proteins, such as alpha 2 subunit of GABAA receptor (GABA-\u03b12), peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) in seven regions (diencephalon, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, striatum, hippocampus, midbrain, and pons-medulla) of the rat brain. The mRNA expression of DBI increased significantly in all areas of the brain, especially diencephalon, after chronic administration of MAP. The mRNA expression of PBR, GABA-\u03b12 and PACAP increased significantly in all areas of the brain, especially cerebral cortex, after chronic administration of MAP. These results suggest that anxiety is associated with the mRNA expression of DBI as well as DBI-related genes.",

The seven-membered ring has a chair conformation with the C=O group turned away from the benzene ring. N-H\u22efO and O-H\u22efO hydrogen bonds are present in the crystal structure.", 
    "219": "The title compound, C(18)H(15)ClN(2)O(2), is a potential human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. The pyrrolidine ring adopts an envelope and the diazepine ring a boat conformation. In the crystal structure, two isomers (R and S) form centrosymmetric dimers via N-H\u22efO hydrogen bonds.", 
    "220": "ABSTRACT Flurazepam is a long acting drug with sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, relaxant, and anti-epileptic properties. The drug is a benzodiazepine and is commonly used by adults, including pregnant women, intentionally or sometimes unintentionally during their pregnancy. It is increasingly used these days, and therefore, it seems a special problem to the clinician treating anxiety disorders in women. It should be noticed that flurazepam exposure during pregnancy may have teratogenic effects on the fetus. Until now, many studies have been conducted on drug side-effects in poisonings, behavioral disorder, and anxiety reactions, but there is no accurate report about the teratogenic effect of flurazepam. In this study, teratogenicity flurazepam intake during pregnancy and its effects on fetus development was investigated. About 30 virgin rats of known age and weight were used. After being pregnant, they were divided into three groups: Negative and positive control group, case groups exposed for 1 to 6 mg/kg/day. The fetuses were first studied macroscopically regarding anomalies, and then histological and histochemically to inspect the defects of tissue organogenesis. Our results show that there was significant difference in the weight and length of the cases compared to the control group. The statistical results indicate that flurazepam intake during the second half of pregnancy can lead to irreversible anomalies. It seems that benzodiazepine therapy among pregnant woman would be better to avoid during the first trimester and multidrug regimens.", 
    "221": "The objective of this cross-sectional evaluation study was to compare data generated through prescriber assessments, and data generated from independent direct contact with opiate-dependent patients in office-based practice to evaluate buprenorphine treatment for modality of buprenorphine absorption, benzodiazepine use, and depressive symptoms. A group of buprenorphine office-based practice prescribers was selected to participate in this study. They were asked to screen for inclusion all their patients coming for a visit from February to August 2002. Once included by their prescribing physician, patients were given a series of self-administered questionnaires to be returned directly to the research staff, independently of their prescriber. Each prescriber was given a questionnaire to complete based on their knowledge and interview of the patient. Items assessed were history of current treatment, current substance use, buprenorphine treatment related behavior (daily frequency of intake, route of administration), benzodiazepine use and existence of a major depressive episode. Prescribers and patients' questionnaires were compared. Concordance of both assessments was assessed by kappa statistics. The sensitivity and specificity as well as the positive and negative predictive values of prescriber collected information were compared to that of their patients'. There was an overall good correlation between both data sources on the procedures for buprenorphine use especially for intravenous use of buprenorphine. There were important variations: obtaining buprenorphine without a prescription or with a prescription made by another doctor, intravenous administration of buprenorphine, use of benzodiazepines, and depression were underestimated by prescribers."
