Pharmacological agents may be used as a complement to behavioural techniques to assist in the management of anxiety in some paediatric dental patients. Their use may also be especially indicated in children with disabilities. These agents are usually sedative in action and do not, in themselves, eliminate anxiety but merely enhance patient acceptance by reducing arousal and modifying anticipation of danger. The agents used are varied and diverse and include nitrous oxide, benzodiazepines and narcotics. Nitrous oxide has proved to be of particular value but carries a degree of risk for the operating staff. Amongst the benzodiazepines, Midazolam has been used more frequently in recent years. It may be given by a variety of routes, including intra-nasally. Dentists who employ sedative agents and techniques should be familiar with the pharmacology of the agents selected, be cognisant of the risks and benefits of the technique employed and be able to manage any adverse events that may arise through their use.",

    "2": "Surgically resected specimens were obtained from 66 temporal lobe epilepsy patients [51 with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and 15 with non-MTLE] receiving no BZDs and seven MTLE patients receiving BZDs. BZDR densities in brain sections were measured by using [(125)I]iomazenil autoradiography. Cell densities were measured from cresyl violet-stained sections.", 
    "3": "Compared with non-MTLE patients, non-BZD-treated MTLE patients showed remarkable reduction of BZDR density in the pyramidal cell region of cornu ammonis (CA) 1, CA3, and CA4, and a smaller but significant reduction in CA2 and the molecular and granule cell layers of dentate gyrus (mDG). In the MTLE group, the BZDR density in the mDG correlated with that in lateral cortex. Significant correlations between BZDR density and cell density were found in all hippocampal regions. A significant difference in BZDR density/cell-density ratio was observed in CA1 region between MTLE and non-MTLE. BZD-treated patients tended to have lower BZDR densities than did non-BZD-treated patients, although the differences did not reach significance. In all MTLE cases, [(123)I]iomazenil singlephoton emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed decreased BZDR binding in MTL.", 
    "4": "In MTLE, BZDR densities decreased parallel to reduction in cell density in most hippocampal subfields, but BZDR density appeared to decrease in excess of neuron loss in CA1. [(125)I]iomazenil SPECT might be useful for detecting in vivo changes of BZDR density.", 
    "5": "Interpretation of the concentration of a drug is more difficult when a combination of drugs is present in a decedent's blood. An increase in deaths resulting from co-intoxication with methadone and a benzodiazepine led the authors to perform a retrospective study of cases examined at the Jefferson County Coroner/Medical Examiner Office. They found 101 deaths wherein methadone was detected in the blood. Based on the drugs detected in the blood, these 101 cases were grouped into four categories: (1) pure methadone intoxication, (2) intoxication with methadone and benzodiazepine, (3) intoxication with methadone and other drugs excluding benzodiazepine, and (4) intoxication with methadone, benzodiazepines, and other drugs. Methadone was the sole intoxicant in 15 cases, with a mean concentration of 0.27 mg/L. Benzodiazepines were the most frequently detected co-intoxicant (60 of 101 cases). Benzodiazepine was the only co-intoxicant in 30 cases, and the mean methadone concentration in those 30 cases was 0.599 mg/L. Higher levels of methadone may occur in acute intoxication with methadone and benzodiazepine because benzodiazepines compete with methadone for methadone receptors. Higher levels of methadone may occur with chronic abuse of methadone and benzodiazepines because over time, benzodiazepines inhibit the hepatic enzymes that metabolize methadone.",

Parecoxib, an inactive prodrug, is hydrolyzed in vivo to valdecoxib, a substrate for hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Thus, potential exists for interactions with other CYP3A4 substrates. In this investigation, we determined the influence of parecoxib on the pharmacokinetics and clinical effects of midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate, in volunteers. This was a randomized, balanced crossover, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical investigation. Twelve healthy subjects aged 23-41 yr were studied after providing IRB-approved informed consent. Midazolam 0.07 mg/kg IV infusion was administered 1 h after placebo (control) or parecoxib 40 mg IV. Venous midazolam concentrations were determined by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry assay. Pharmacokinetic variables were determined by noncompartmental analysis. Pharmacodynamic measurements included clinical end-points, cognitive function (memory; digit symbol substitution tests), subjective self-assessment of recovery (visual analog scales), and bispectral index. Midazolam plasma concentrations were similar between placebo and parecoxib-treated subjects. No differences were found in midazolam pharmacokinetics (maximal observed plasma concentration, clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution) or pharmacodynamics (clinical end-points, digit symbol substitution tests, memory, visual analog scales, bispectral index). Single-bolus parecoxib does not alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of midazolam infusion. Parecoxib did not affect CYP3A4 activity as assessed using midazolam clearance as the in vivo probe.",

    "10": "Cytochrome P450 (P450) is a superfamily of enzymes which mediates metabolism of xenobiotics including drugs. Alprazolam, an anti-anxiety agent, is metabolized in rat and human liver by P4503A1 and P4503A4 respectively, to 4-hydroxy alprazolam (4-OHALP, pharmacologically less active) and alpha-hydroxy alprazolam (alpha-OHALP, pharmacologically more active). We examined P450 mediated metabolism of alprazolam by rat and human brain microsomes and observed that the relative amount of alpha-OHALP formed in brain was higher than liver. This biotransformation was mediated by a P450 isoform belonging to P4503A subfamily, which is constitutively expressed in neuronal cells in rat and human brain. The formation of larger amounts of alpha-OHALP in neurons points to local modulation of pharmacological activity in brain, at the site of action of the anti-anxiety drug. Since hydroxy metabolites of alprazolam are hydrophilic and not easily cleared through blood-CSF barrier, alpha-OHALP would potentially have a longer half-life in brain.",

If the patient regained a systolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg and had not awakened, paramedics injected IV two syringes stored in a sealed kit. The first always contained either 2 g magnesium sulfate (M) or placebo (P); the second contained either 10 mg diazepam (D) or P. Awakening at any time by 3 months was determined by record review, and independence at 3 months was determined by telephone calls.

    "15": "Postsynaptic kainate receptors (KARs) have been found in the CNS along with AMPA receptors (AMPARs), but because KAR-mediated EPSCs are much smaller and slower than AMPAR-mediated EPSCs, it remains unclear whether these postsynaptic KARs are functionally significant. In this study we measured KAR- and AMPAR-mediated EPSPs in hippocampal interneurons, and then we used these EPSPs in a model to examine the effects of afferent firing on each receptor. In this model the KARs generated a large tonic depolarization when activated by a small population of afferent fibers firing asynchronously at physiologically relevant firing rates (1-5 Hz). At 3-5 Hz this tonic depolarization exceeded the peak depolarization mediated by AMPARs in response to the same afferent activity. We also found that, unlike AMPARs, KARs did not generate large oscillations in membrane potential during theta rhythms. When simulated EPSCs were injected into interneurons to mimic afferents firing at 5 Hz, we found that currents simulating KARs elicited more spiking than currents simulating AMPARs. We also found that simulated AMPARs, but not KARs, could transmit presynaptic theta rhythms into postsynaptic spiking at the theta rhythm. Our results suggest that synaptically activated KARs have a strong influence on membrane potential and that AMPARs and KARs differ in their ability to encode temporal information.", 
    "16": "The GABA(A) receptor is a target of many general anesthetics, such as propofol. General anesthetic binding sites are distinct from the GABA binding sites. At low concentrations, the anesthetics potentiate the currents induced by submaximal GABA concentrations. At higher concentrations the anesthetics directly activate GABA(A) receptors. In contrast, benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, only potentiate currents induced by submaximal GABA concentrations. Channel kinetic studies suggest that these drugs stabilize different receptor states. We previously showed that the accessibility of the anionic sulfhydryl reagent p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (pCMBS(-)) applied extracellularly to cysteines substituted for residues in the GABA(A) alpha1 subunit M3 membrane-spanning segment was state-dependent. The subset of pCMBS(-)-accessible, M3 segment cysteine mutants acts as a reporter for receptor conformation. Here we show that pCMBS(-), applied in the presence of a potentiating concentration of propofol, reacts with a subset of alpha1 subunit, M3 segment, cysteine-substitution mutants (Y294C, V297C, I302C, F304C). In the presence of a directly activating concentration of propofol pCMBS(-) reacts with a different subset of the M3 cysteine-substitution mutants (Y294C, S299C, I302C, E303C, A305C). These subsets are distinct from the subsets of M3 cysteine-substitution mutants that are reactive with pCMBS(-) in the absence and presence of GABA and in the presence of diazepam. We hypothesize that distinct subsets of reactive residues represent distinct conformations or ensembles of conformations of the receptor. These results provide structural evidence for at least five distinct receptor states, three nonconducting states, resting, diazepam-bound and potentiating propofol-bound, and two conducting-desensitized states, the activating propofol-bound and GABA-bound states.",

After brief exposure to haloperidol and olanzapine, she developed fever, rigidity, waxy flexibility, autonomic instability, and elevated creatinine phosphokinase enzyme. Approximately 6 weeks after the onset of the illness, multiple laboratory tests, and evaluation at three different hospitals, the condition was effectively treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This case is a lesson in delayed recognition and the delayed use of ECT for the malignant catatonia/neuroleptic malignant syndrome.", 
    "18": "This study examined the short-term efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) combined with antipsychotic medication in treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). Fifteen patients with TRS from an in-patient psychiatric rehabilitation unit participated. Patients completed a course of ECT consisting of 8 to 20 sessions, while their antipsychotic medications were continued throughout the study. Patients were assessed at baseline, 1 week, 1 month, and 2 months after their last ECT session. Assessment instruments included the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), Global Assessment Scale (GAS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), Nurses' Observation Scale for In-Patient Evaluation, and occupational therapists' rating of the patients' functioning with respect to work, social, and leisure activities. Compared with the baseline assessment, at each posttreatment evaluation, patients showed statistically significant improvement in the GAS and CGI. In addition, they were significantly better in terms of BPRS and SANS scores, as well as work performance and social functioning at the 2-month post-ECT evaluation.",

The authors investigated sleep habits, prevalence of sleep disorders, sleepiness on the job, and hypnotic drug intake (Benzodiazepines, Zaleplon, Zolpidem, or Zoplicone) in a population of Italian state police officers. This study was conducted with self-administered questionnaires. The investigation focused on the difference between 540 non-shiftworkers (413 males, 127 females) and 575 shiftworkers (483 males, 92 females). All individuals were between 20 yr and 39 yr of age. In shiftworkers, there was a higher prevalence of difficulty in initiating sleep; in addition, these individuals had a sleep latency that exceeded 20 min, and they experienced early awakenings. No significant differences in daytime sleepiness and drug intake existed between the 2 groups. Self-evaluation of the number of hours that individuals slept each night and during a 24-hr period revealed that shiftworkers required more sleep. The results indicated that shiftworkers experienced a lower quality of sleep than non-shiftworkers, but the former did not report increased daytime sleepiness or increased hypnotic drug intake (i.e., Benzodiazepines, Zaleplon, Zolpidem, or Zoplicone). Shiftworkers seemed to compensate for the poor quality of their sleep by sleeping for a greater number of hours during 24-hr periods than the non-shiftworkers. Perhaps the aforementioned compensation resulted from a prolonged recovery from shiftwork effects.", 
    "25": "The incidence of respiratory depression following treatment of prolonged seizures with benzodiazepines is variable in the literature. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of children treated for prolonged seizure over a one year period. Of the 56 seizures treated, 30 received lorazepam, 19 diazepam, and seven both drugs. Twenty two episodes (39%) of prolonged seizure were treated with multiple doses of benzodiazepines. In eight events (14%), there was documented respiratory depression following the administration of one or more doses of benzodiazepine; in six of these, multiple doses were given. The doses used were often at the low end or less than the recommended dose for treatment of status epilepticus. These data support suggestions that multiple doses of benzodiazepines increase the risk of respiratory depression.",

    "27": "The present work analyzed the changes in evoked field potentials of freely moving rats after kindling induced by a convulsant inverse agonist of the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex, methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM). Two doses of beta-CCM (2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg) were used. In kindled and control animals, a stimulating electrode was implanted in the perforant pathway and a recording electrode in the dentate gyrus. Results showed that, after an acutely injected dose of 20 mg/kg pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), all kindled animals showed a decrease in population spike amplitude after 20 min. After 60 min, only fully kindled rats showed a long-lasting potentiation, also visible up to 24 h later, as compared to controls or nonkindled animals. Changes in glutamate and GABA receptor binding measured in previous experiments may explain this potentiation effect observed in fully kindled rats.", 
    "28": "Previous studies have suggested that the brain regions along the taste pathway and its anatomical interfacing with the brain reward system are concerned with palatability-induced consumption. To clarify whether the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is involved in the behavioral expression induced by taste pleasantness, we examined the effects of lesions to the VTA on the consumption of taste stimuli in rats. (1) Bilateral extensive electrolytic lesions to the VTA selectively reduced the consumption of a normally preferred taste fluid (0.1 M sucrose) compared to that of sham-operated animals during a 24-h two-bottle choice test. The consumption of other fluids, including non-preferred taste fluids (HCl and quinine hydrochloride) was not different between the lesioned and sham animals. (2) The injection of midazolam (3 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine agonist, or morphine (2 mg/kg) significantly increased the consumption of 0.1 M sucrose fluids in the sham animals. The same injections, however, failed to increase intake of the 0.1 M sucrose in rats with 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the VTA. Neither midazolam nor morphine modified the intake of non-preferred quinine (0.0003 M) solution in both the lesioned and sham animals. These results suggest that dopaminergic mediation in the VTA is required to enhance the consumption of normally preferred fluids exclusively.", 
    "29": "This study investigated the changes of the neuropsychological functions over a 4-month period of treatment in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Thirty-nine OCD patients and 31 healthy controls were evaluated with neuropsychological and clinical tests. The same tests were readministered 4-months after pharmacological treatment for the OCD patients. At the first series of tests, compared to the controls, the OCD patients were significantly impaired on the immediate and delayed recall of Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (RCFT), and on the letter and category of Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWA). They also showed a prolonged response time on Trail Making Test (TMT), part A. The severity of OCD measured by Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) correlated well with the performance on the immediate and delayed recall of RCFT and the response time on TMT, part A. After 4-months' follow-up, the OCD patients still showed impairment on the immediate and delayed recall of RCFT and COWA category. This is despite the fact that they had improved significantly on these functions in comparison with the controls over the period of treatment. In addition, an association between OCD symptoms and the performance on the neuropsychological tests was not observed. The neuropsychological profile of the OCD patients found in the present study is consistent with current theories proposing that the frontal-striatal system is the possible pathophysiological mechanism underlying the development of OCD.", 
    "30": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate the majority of fast synaptic inhibition in the brain and that are also important drug targets for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and neurosteriods. These receptors are pentameric hetero-oligomers that can be assembled from 7 subunit classes with multiple members: alpha(1-6), beta(1-3), gamma(1-3), delta, epsilon, theta, and pi. Most receptor subtypes in the brain, however, are believed to be composed of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subunits. Modifications of GABA(A) receptor function are continually implicated in a range of pathologies, including epilepsy, anxiety, insomnia, and substance abuse. Moreover, changes in the efficacy of synaptic inhibition mediated by GABA(A) receptors are believed to be play central roles in certain forms of synaptic plasticity, including rebound potentiation in the cerebellum, and hippocampal long-term potentiation. Given the critical role that GABA(A) receptors play as mediators of synaptic transmission, it is of fundamental importance to understand the endogenous mechanisms used by neurones to control the function of these receptors. This review will focus on the dynamic regulation of GABA(A) receptor phosphorylation state and channel function as mechanisms involved in determining the efficacy of synaptic inhibition. In addition, the possible role of GABA(A) receptor phosphorylation in controlling receptor internalization and recycling will also be explored.", 
    "31": "Flumazenil is traditionally administered intravenously to reverse the adverse effects of over sedation with benzodiazepines. The aim of this study was to test postoperative cognitive and psychomotor recovery from midazolam conscious sedation, following reversal with orally administered flumazenil. It was hypothesised that when administered by the oral route, flumazenil may enhance recovery over a prolonged period, thus increasing safety. Eighteen patients requiring intravenous midazolam sedation for dental treatment completed a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial. Following treatment the patients' sedation was reversed using either flumazenil or saline (as placebo), administered orally, on alternate appointments. Assessment of mood and cognitive function were undertaken using ClinPhone.cdr(R), a highly sensitive and specific computerised battery of cognitive tests administered by telephone prior to sedation and every hour for seven hours post reversal. Results indicate that within 20 min of administration, oral flumazenil is capable of partially reversing some cognitive and psychomotor impairments but the attentional and stimulus discrimination effects of midazolam sedation still remain.",

Forty-six ASA physical status I children aged 10-16 years were recruited. Each child required two treatment sessions. Sedation with either oral midazolam 0.5 mg.kg-1 or nitrous oxide in oxygen was used at the first visit, the alternative being used at the second visit. Blood pressure, heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation, and sedation and behavioural scores were recorded every 5 min. Anxiety levels and postoperative satisfaction were also recorded. Blood pressure, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation in both groups were similar and within acceptable clinical limits. The median [range] lowest arterial oxygen saturation levels for subjects in the midazolam and nitrous oxide groups were 95 [90-100]% and 98 [93-100]%, respectively. The median [range] time to the maximum level of sedation in the midazolam group was 20 [5-65] min compared with 5 [5-10] min in the nitrous oxide group (p < 0.001). The median [range] duration of treatment was similar in both groups (midazolam group: 10 [5-30] min, nitrous oxide group: 10 [5-25] min). Seventy-four per cent of subjects were prepared to have oral midazolam sedation again, 54% preferring it.

The proportion of IDU reporting recent methadone injecting declined significantly over the study period, from a peak of 31% in 1997 to 13% in 2000. Unlike the injection of methadone, there was no significant difference between the proportions of IDU reporting recent benzodiazepine injecting over the study period, which ranged between 10% and 16%. A consistent minority (range 5-7%) of IDU reported having injected both methadone and benzodiazepines in all years of the study. There were no differences in the proportions of males and females reporting recent methadone or benzodiazepine injecting in any individual year.

The drugs most commonly used were diazepam, alcohol, and cannabis. The most commonly reported reasons for attempting self-detoxification were \"fed-up with the lifestyle\" (61%) and \"for their family\" (12%). The reasons given for why patients had decided to detoxify themselves rather than access treatment services included 23% who reported that \"they could cope on their own and that they didn't need any help.\" The short-term success rate (abstinent for at least 24 hours) was moderate, at 41% (97/237). Patients who had been unsuccessful were asked why their last self-detoxification attempt had not resulted in abstinence, with 27% reporting that they were \"tempted to use again\" and 23% reported that they \"didn't know why they started using again.\" The prevalence of both attempts and success suggests that, for some opiate users, self-detoxification may be a pathway to abstinence.",

The distances represent steric features, while the molecular electrostatic potentials at the intersection points with the surface represent the electrostatic contributions. The approach is called IDA (internal distances analysis). Matrices obtained by varying the spherical coordinate angles by fixed increments are correlated with the biological activity by partial least squares (PLS). The descriptors, tested with the benchmark steroids and an also well characterized benzodiazepine data set, turn out to be highly predictive. Additionally, they share the advantage of grid-based methods that the obtained models can be visualized, and thus be directly used in a rational drug design approach.", 
    "43": "A restricted access material (RAM), alkyl-diol-silica (ADS), was used to prepare a highly bio-compatible solid-phase microextraction (SPME) capillary for the automated and direct in-tube extraction of several benzodiazepines from human serum. The bifunctionality of the ADS extraction phase prevented fouling of the capillary by protein adsorption while simultaneously trapping the analytes in the hydrophobic porous interior. This the first report of a restricted access material utilized as an extraction phase for in-tube SPME. The approach simplified the required apparatus in comparison to existing RAM column switching procedures, and more importantly eliminated the excessive use of extraction solvents. The biocompatibility of the ADS material also overcame the existing problems with in-tube SPME that requires an ultrafiltration or other deproteinization step prior to handling biological samples, therefore further minimizing the sample preparation requirements. The calculated oxazepam, temazepam, nordazepam and diazepam detection limits were 26, 29, 22 and 24 ng/ml in serum, respectively. The method was linear over the range of 50-50 000 ng/ml with an average linear coefficient (R2) value of 0.9998. The injection repeatability and intra-assay precision of the method were evaluated with five injections of a 10-microg/ml serum sample (spiked with all compounds), resulting in an average RSD<7%. The ADS extraction column was robust, providing many direct injections of biological fluids for the extraction and subsequent determination of benzodiazepines.",

H2RAs are relatively safe drugs and recently in Japan they can be purchased by over the counter without a doctor's prescription. However, in elderly, drug metabolism is different from younger people, so that there are several important points in treating elderly. First of all, elder people tend to have poor renal function. Dosage of H2RAs should be lowered accordingly. In particular, cimetidine is known to interfere with other drugs through hepatic metabolism, the concentration of co-committant drugs such as warfarin, benzodiazepine tend to be elevated. Cimetidine should be replaced by the other H2RAs which have no such effects.",

However, it is the well-known fact that complications occur during EGD, particularly in elderly patients. We reviewed EGD performed for elderly patients. Arrhythmia, elevated blood pressure over 50 mmHg, increased the pulse rates and decreased of oxygen saturation during EGD were more common in elderly patients. Changes in these parameters occurred more frequently when EGD passed through the pharynx at the time of insertion. In conclusion, EGD for elderly patients should be performed more gently and carefully, particularly at the time of insertion.",

To examine the effects of prior cocaine treatment, intact or gonadectomized male and female rats were pretreated with daily saline or cocaine (15 mg/kg, IPx5 days), and their approach/avoidance response to Form was tested 4-7 days later. In intact males, cocaine decreased the avoidance of Form, and previous gonadectomy completely abolished this response. Decreased avoidance behavior did not appear to be linked to behavioral sensitization to cocaine, since gonadectomized males demonstrated locomotor sensitization when given subsequent cocaine challenge. In females, avoidance of Form was not altered by either cocaine or gonadectomy. Three experiments further characterized the approach/avoidance response to Form in males. In the first experiment, daily footshock stress did not significantly alter the avoidance of Form. In a second study, rats that displayed high and low locomotor responses to a novel cage showed no differences between groups in their avoidance of Form. In the third experiment, intra-nucleus accumbens microinjection of fluphenazine (5 micro g/side) attenuated the daily cocaine-induced decrease in avoidance of Form.",

    "66": "The aim of this study was to examine the effect of the most potent CCK receptor antagonist, L364,718, on two major factors involved in pancreatitis development: enzyme load and cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) levels in acinar cells. L364,718 (0.1 mg/kg/12 hr) was administered from 30 min before inducing acute pancreatitis (AP) by pancreatic duct obstruction (PDO) for 48 hr. The results obtained at different AP stages in PDO rats treated and not treated with the CCK antagonist were compared. Similar increases in the intracellular enzyme content were found at earlier stages of pancreatitis in all PDO rats treated or not treated with L364,718. The CCK antagonist increased cytosolic Ca2+ levels up to 6 hr after administration, inducing a higher cytosolic Ca2+ overload at the earliest stages of pancreatitis in L364,718-treated PDO rats than in those not treated. This event might justify the higher increases in ascites volume and haematocrit found in PDO rats treated with L364,718 and the exacerbation in pancreatic morphological alterations induced by PDO. The CCK receptor antagonist L364,718 produces alterations in the acinar calcium homeostasis that prevent to reduction in the severity of pancreatitis induced by obstruction.", 
    "67": "Ivermectin, a mixture of 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1a (> or = 80%) and B1b (< or =20%), is produced by Streptomyces avermectilis, an actinomycete. It is a macrocyclic lactone disaccharide, a member of the avermectin family, and is used as an antiparasitic drug. Previous studies performed in our laboratory showed that doramectin, another avermectin drug, interferes with GABAergic-related behaviours, leading to anxiety and seizures. The objective of the present study was to examine the effects of ivermectin (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) on the central nervous system of rats, using behavioural models related to GABAergic neurotransmission. A known anxiolytic drug, diazepam, was used as a positive control. Open field and elevated plus-maze behaviours, as well as conflict behaviour to a conditioned response, were assessed. The effects of ivermectin and diazepam in reversing the anxiety induced by picrotoxin was studied. The protective effects of ivermectin on pentylenetetrazole- and picrotoxin-induced seizures were also investigated. In the open field, 1.0 mg/kg ivermectin decreased locomotion frequency at 15 and 60 min of observation, rearing behaviour showed a biphasic effect at 15 and 30 min and duration of immobility was increased in all sessions after 1.0 mg/kg ivermectin. These data suggest anxiolytic or sedative effects. Ivermectin and diazepam both had a tendency to cause an increase both in the number of entries into the open arms and on the time spent in the open arms of an elevated plus-maze. Picrotoxin on its own reduced the number of entries as well as the time spent in the open arms. Both diazepam and ivermectin reversed these effects of picrotoxin. In conflict behaviour analysis, ivermectin and diazepam gave the classic effect of an anxiolytic drug, reversing the conditioned response to shock. Ivermectin protected rats from the convulsant effects of pentylenetetrazole but not from those of picrotoxin. Thus, ivermectin had the pharmacological profile of an anxiolytic drug with GABAergic properties. The lack of effect on seizures induced by picrotoxin suggests that the action of ivermectin is different from that of the benzodiazepine drugs.",

    "69": "Interactions of midazolam and ketoconazole were studied in vivo and in vitro in rats. Ketoconazole (total dose of 15 mg/kg intraperitoneally) reduced clearance of intravenous midazolam (5 mg/kg) from 79 to 55 ml/min/kg (p < 0.05) and clearance of intragastric midazolam (15 mg/kg) from 1051 to 237 ml/min/kg (p < 0.05), increasing absolute bioavailability from 0.11 to 0.36 (p < 0.05). Presystemic extraction occurred mainly across the liver as opposed to the gastrointestinal tract mucosa. Midazolam increased electroencephalographic (EEG) amplitude in the beta-frequency range. Ketoconazole shifted the concentration-EEG effect relationship rightward (increase in EC(50)), probably because ketoconazole is a neutral benzodiazepine receptor ligand. Ketoconazole competitively inhibited midazolam hydroxylation by rat liver and intestinal microsomes in vitro, with nanomolar K(i) values. At a total serum ketoconazole of 2 microg/ml (3.76 microM) in vivo, the predicted reduction in clearance of intragastric midazolam by ketoconazole (to 6% of control) was slightly greater than the observed reduction in vivo (to 15% of control). However, unbound serum ketoconazole greatly underpredicted the observed clearance reduction. Although the in vitro and in vivo characteristics of midazolam in rats incompletely parallel those in humans, the experimental model can be used to assess aspects of drug interactions having potential clinical importance.", 
    "70": "GABA(A) receptors mediate fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system (CNS), and approximately half of these receptors contain alpha1 subunits. GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunits are important for receptor assembly and specific pharmacological responses to benzodiazepines. Plasticity in GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit expression is associated with changes in CNS excitability observed during normal brain development, in animal models of epilepsy, and upon withdrawal from alcohol and benzodiazepines. To examine the role of alpha1 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors in vivo, we characterized receptor subunit expression and pharmacological properties in cerebral cortex of knockout mice with a targeted deletion of the alpha1 subunit. The mice are viable but exhibit an intention tremor. Western blot analysis confirms the complete loss of alpha1 subunit peptide expression. Stable adaptations in the expression of several GABA(A) receptor subunits are observed in the fifth to seventh generations, including decreased expression of beta2/3 and gamma2 subunits and increased expression of alpha2 and alpha3 subunits. There was no change in alpha4, alpha5, or delta subunit peptide levels in cerebral cortex. Knockout mice exhibit loss of over half of GABA(A) receptors measured by [(3)H]muscimol, [(3)H]2-(3-carboxyl)-3-amino-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-pyridazinium bromide ([(3)H]SR-95531), and t-butylbicyclophosphoro[(35)S]thionate ([(35)S]TBPS) binding.

GABA(A) receptor alpha1(-/-) mice lose all high-affinity [(3)H]zolpidem binding and about half of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding in the cerebral cortex. The potency and maximal efficacy of muscimol-stimulated (36)Cl(-) uptake in cerebral cortical synaptoneurosomes are reduced in alpha1(-/-) mice. Furthermore, knockout mice exhibit increased bicuculline-induced seizure susceptibility compared with wild-type mice. These data emphasize the significance of alpha1 subunit expression and its involvement in the regulation of CNS excitability.", 
    "71": "Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) after transplantation is a major cause of delayed graft function, which has a negative impact on early and late graft function and improve acute rejection. We have previously shown that polyethylene glycol (PEG) and particularly PEG 20M has a protective effect against cold ischemia and reperfusion injury in an isolated perfused pig and rat kidney model. We extended those observations to investigate the role of PEG using different doses (30g or 50g/l) added (ICPEG30 or ICPEG50) or not (IC) to a simplified preservation solution to reduce IRI after prolonged cold storage (48-h) of pig kidneys when compared with Euro-Collins and University of Wisconsin solutions. The study of renal function and medulla injury was performed with biochemical methods and proton NMR spectroscopy. Histological and inflammatory cell studies were performed after reperfusion (30-40 min) and on days 7 and 14 and weeks 4, 8, and 12. Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), a mitochondrial protein involved in cholesterol homeostasis, was also studied. The results demonstrated that ICPEG30 improved renal function and reduced medulla injury. ICPEG30 also improved tubular function and strongly protect mitochondrial integrity. Post-IRI inflammation was strongly reduced in this group, particularly lymphocytes TCD4(+), PBR expression was influenced by IRI in the early period and during the development of chronic dysfunction. This study clearly shows that PEG has a beneficial effect in renal preservation and suggests a role of PBR as a marker IRI and repair processes.", 
    "72": "Benzodiazepine-steroid interactions and sex differences in brain and circulating levels of gonadal steroids, lead to hypothesized differential effects of DZ on EEG in women and men. Coherent activity has been shown to be relevant for binding information into global percepts therefore diazepam effects on EEG correlation and sex differences were assessed in a double-blind crossover study. Healthy males (9) and females (9) received a single-dose (5 mg) of diazepam or placebo. EEG was recorded with eyes open (FP1, FP2, F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, O1, O2) before and 2 h after drug administration in two counterbalanced sessions. DZ selectively increased delta and theta EEG correlation among frontal regions and decreased it between right parieto-occipital (theta) and fronto-central regions (alpha2) in addition to an increase in beta2 interhemispheric correlation in men and women. Men showed increased beta1 interhemispheric correlation, decreased alpha1 and increased beta power; women showed in addition, decreased theta and alpha2 power. theta rhythm was more sensitive to DZ in women, whereas interhemispheric correlation was more affected in men. DZ had a sexually dimorphic effect on waking EEG and a disrupting effect on coherent activity, increasing balance among frontal regions and decreasing temporal coupling between anterior-posterior regions. These sex differences might be related to differences in brain organization and activational effects of female gonadal steroids which are higher in women than in men.",

The present study was designed to determine the role of Ro15-4513 in preventing anticonvulsant, toxic, and lethal effects of carbamazepine (CBZ) in amygdala-kindled rats. Acute treatment with CBZ (25 mg/kg, i.p.) produced anticonvulsant effects in fully kindled rats characterized by a significant decrease in afterdischarge and seizure duration and stage. Repeated administration of this high dose of CBZ induced sedation and high (56%) lethality. The anticonvulsant and sedative effects of CBZ were strikingly suppressed by pretreatment with Ro15-4513 (2.5 and 5 mg/kg, i.p.), and there was no mortality in animals co-administrated with Ro15-4513 during the entire experimental period. These results indicate that Ro15-4513 protects against CBZ-induced sedation and lethality, while suppressing the anticonvulsant effects of CBZ, suggesting a role for the GABA(A) receptor in CBZ efficacy and side effects. The potential clinical implications for CBZ-induced toxicity and overdose remain to be explored.",

    "79": "Sleep disturbances are common and prevalence rates increase with age. Especially in the elderly, somatic diseases and medications with adverse effects relating to sleep are frequent reasons for disturbed and nonrefreshing sleep. It should be emphasised that these reasons must be excluded before symptomatic therapy is started. In some cases the use of hypnosedatives may be included as part of the treatment of a somatic disease and may cause sleep disturbances. Pharmacotherapy is one of the main approaches in the management of primary insomnia and should be part of a broader treatment strategy including nonpharmacological methods. This article focuses on the tolerability of frequently prescribed hypnosedatives in the elderly with primary insomnia and addresses the primary care physician. In general, recommendations for the pharmacotherapy of insomnia in elderly patients include using a reduced dosage. For some substances (e.g. zolpidem, zopiclone, zaleplon, temazepam and triazolam) the recommended dosage is half that recommended for younger patients. The properties of the selected hypnosedative should be taken into consideration and matched with the type of sleep disturbance experienced by the patient. Ultrashort-acting drugs may be useful when initiating sleep is the main problem, whereas short- and intermediate-acting substances are recommended for maintaining sleep. Possible interactions with pre-existing medication must also be taken into consideration. Some agents such as antipsychotics, antidepressants, melatonin and herbal agents may be used in specific indications. However, only a few of these substances have proven tolerability in the elderly and further investigations are recommended.", 
    "80": "Proliferation and matrix synthesis by activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) participate in the development of chronic pancreatitis. Apoptosis of PSC may terminate this process but has not yet been studied in this particular cell type and was the aim of the present study. PSC were isolated from rat pancreas and characterized for expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein, alpha-smooth muscle actin, CD95, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors. Apoptosis was determined by TdT-UTP nick end-labeling reaction, annexin V binding, and caspase-8 activation. Both CD95L and TRAIL induced apoptosis in PSC. The apoptotic response was minor in PSC cultured for 7 days but increased markedly thereafter. Sensitization of PSC with culture duration was accompanied by increased expression of CD95 and TRAIL receptor 2 and no alterations of Flip expression or protein kinase B phosphorylation but was paralleled by the appearance of a COOH-terminal cleavage product of receptor-interacting protein. PSC apoptosis was also induced by PK-11195, a ligand of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor. PSC apoptosis may be important in terminating the wound-healing response after pancreas injury and exhibits features distinct from apoptosis induction in hepatic stellate cells.",

This double-blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing flexible dosing of olanzapine (5-20 mg/day, n = 234) to haloperidol (3-15 mg/day, n = 219), consisted of a 6-week acute phase, followed by a 6-week continuation phase. Symptomatic remission rates were similar for olanzapine- and haloperidol-treated patients at weeks 6 and 12. At week 6, significant changes in five dimensions of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) [general health (P = 0.010), physical functioning (P < 0.001), role limitations due to physical problems (P < 0.001), social functioning (P < 0.05) and vitality (P < 0.01)] and the SF-36 physical components summary score were found in favour of olanzapine compared to haloperidol. At week 12, olanzapine treatment maintained the significantly favourable HRQOL changes. At the end of week 12, patients on olanzapine showed significantly greater improvement than haloperidol in work activities impairment and household activities impairment scores on the Streamlined Longitudinal Interview Clinical Evaluation from the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (SLICE/LIFE) activities impairment scores. Subgroup analyses revealed that olanzapine treatment significantly increased a proportion of employed patients and their weekly paid working hours. In conclusion, compared to haloperidol, olanzapine treatment was comparably effective in the remission of bipolar mania and significantly improved HRQOL and work status in patients with bipolar I disorder.",

It is uncertain whether the pineal hormone melatonin, which may alter sleep/wake physiology in mammals, acts at this site. A previous report has indicated that a more widespread injection of melatonin into the hypothalamus of the cat induces sleep. In the present study we have examined the possibility that the MPA may mediate this effect. Nine adult rats were microinjected with melatonin 1 and 50 ug and vehicle into the MPA during the daytime in a repeated measures design study. It was found that melatonin increased total sleep time in a dose-dependent manner, primarily by increasing NREM sleep, and that wake time after sleep onset was significantly reduced. These data add melatonin to the growing list of compounds that increase total sleep after administration into the MPA, and suggest that the MPA may be a common site of action for such agents from a variety of pharmacologic classes. Based on previous studies, the possibility is raised that this sleep enhancement results from an alteration in function of the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "87": "Protein farnesylation catalysed by the enzyme farnesyl protein transferase involves the addition of a 15-carbon farnesyl group to conserved amino acid residues at the carboxyl terminus of certain proteins. Protein substrates of farnesyl transferase include several G-proteins, which are critical intermediates of cell signalling and cytoskeletal organisation such as Ras, Rho, PxF and lamins A and B. Activated Ras proteins trigger a cascade of phosphorylation events through sequential activation of the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway, which is critical for cell survival, and the Raf/Mek/Erk kinase pathway that has been implicated in cell proliferation. Ras mutations which encode for constitutively activated proteins are found in 30% of human cancers. Because farnesylation of Ras is required for its transforming and proliferative activity, the farnesyl protein transferase inhibitors were designed as anticancer agents to abrogate Ras function. However, current evidence suggests that the anticancer activity of the farnesyl transferase inhibitors may not be simply due to Ras inhibition. This review will discuss available clinical data on three of these agents that are currently undergoing clinical trials.", 
    "88": "There is evidence that actions of both progesterone (P) and its metabolite, 5alpha-pregnane-3alpha-ol-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP), are important for sexual behavior of estradiol (E(2))-primed rodents. Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, dose-dependently increases 3alpha,5alpha-THP in the cortex of male rats. These experiments investigated the effects of olanzapine administration on female sexual behavior and progestin concentrations. In Experiment 1, ovariectomized (ovx) rats (N=128) were primed with estradiol benzoate (EB) at Hour 0 and were administered P (0, 50, 100, or 200 microg sc) at Hour 44 and olanzapine (0.0, 2.5, 5.0, or 10.0 mg/kg ip) at Hour 47. At Hour 48, rats were tested for sexual receptivity with a stimulus male. Administration of 10.0 mg/kg of olanzapine, irrespective of P, significantly increased the occurrence (lordosis quotients, LQs) and the intensity (lordosis ratings, LRs) of lordosis compared to all other dosages. Administration of 2.5 or 5.0 mg/kg of olanzapine, irrespective of P, increased LQs and LRs compared to vehicle administration. Olanzapine without P dose-dependently increased LQs and LRs. As expected, administration of P without olanzapine also dose-dependently increased LQs and LRs. In Experiment 2, ovx rats (N=44, n=4 per group) received EB (0 or 10 microg sc), P (0 or 200 microg sc), and/or olanzapine (0.0, 2.5, 5.0, or 10.0 mg/kg ip). The same pattern of effects seen for lordosis was observed on progestin concentrations. Whole brain and plasma P and 3alpha,5alpha-THP concentrations were increased with olanzapine or P dosing and were greatest with coadministration. Together, these data demonstrate that olanzapine and P have independent effects to increase lordosis, P, and 3alpha,5alpha-THP concentrations of adult rats and additive effects in combination, suggesting complimentary mechanisms of action.", 
    "89": "The typical antipsychotic haloperidol and atypical antipsychotics olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone were administered to pregnant Sprague-Dawley dams in the drinking water from Days 8 to 18 of gestation. When the offspring reached adulthood (2 months), spatial learning and short-term retention were examined using the radial arm maze. Results showed that prenatal administration of haloperidol, risperidone and quetiapine impaired learning but only haloperidol and risperidone disrupted short-term retention.", 
    "90": "The effect of different doses of progesterone (1.0, 3.0, 10.0, 30.0, and 100.0 mg/kg) and pregnanolone (1.0, 3.0, 10.0, and 30.0 mg/kg) upon burying defensive and elevated plus-maze (EPM) tests was investigated in adult male rats and compared with the effects of diazepam (0.25. 0.50, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg). All drugs were suspended in a 0.2% methylcellulose solution and administered intraperitoneally 30 min prior to testing. Progesterone and pregnanolone were found to produce anxiolytic-like effects similar to those of diazepam. Thus, at certain doses, both drugs significantly increased the latency for burying and decreased the cumulative burying behavior, without modifying the number of shocks, and increased the time spent in the open arms of the maze, without affecting the spontaneous locomotor activity. These data clearly demonstrate that the defensive burying paradigm is useful to detect the anxiolytic-like properties of pregnanolone. An important finding was that progesterone produces significant behavioral effects 30 min after its administration. This finding suggests a rapid bioconversion of progesterone to its active ring-A reduced metabolites; however, the possibility remains that rapid behavioral effects of progesterone are due to a direct interaction with specific steroid receptors located on the plasma membrane, independently from the gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptor complex modulation.", 
    "91": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) have been identified to bind selectively benzodiazepine ligands and an isoquinoline carboxamide derivative PK 11195 with high affinity. PBRs are present in the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral tissues, and most organs in the human body. PBRs are different from the central benzodiazepine receptors (CBRs) related to the nerve cell membrane GABA(A) receptor and are thought to play several physiological and pathophysiological functions in the CNS and immune system due to their meanly localization in glial cells, the mitochondrial outer membrane of peripheral cells and blood leucocytes and to their important roles in steroidogenesis, cell proliferation and differentiation. Recent research has shown that the density of PBRs is significantly increased in CNS several disorders, such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, cerebral ischemia, astrocytoma, brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent progress in the pharmacology of PBRs is reviewed here with respect to the functions in the brain and peripheral tissues including apoptosis, immune system modulation, seizure promotion, reactions of anticonvulsants on peripheral blood cells, and adverse drug reactions (ADR) of anticonvulsants.", 
    "92": "O-Isobutyl S-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl]methylphosphonothioate (VR) is a structural isomer of a more widely known chemical warfare agent O-ethyl S-[2(diisopropylamino)ethyl]methylphosphonothioate (VX). VR has the potential of being used as military threat/sabotage/terrorist agent. The development of a sound medical countermeasure will undoubtedly enhance not only our medical readiness and ability in VR casualty management, but also our defense posture against the deployment of VR in both combat and politically volatile environments. Acute exposure to a lethal dose of VR has been shown to cause cholinergic hyperfunction, incapacitation, seizures, convulsions, cardiorespiratory depression and death. In this study, pharmacological antagonism of VR-induced cardiorespiratory failure and lethality was investigated in guinea pigs chronically instrumented for concurrent recordings of electrocorticogram, diaphragmatic EMG, Lead II ECG, heart rate and neck skeletal muscle EMG. Thirty (30) min prior to intoxication with a 2 x LD50 dose of VR (22.6 micrograms/kg, s.c.), animals were pretreated with pyridostigmine (0.026 mg/kg, i.m.). Immediately after VR intoxication, animals were given pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM; 25 mg/kg, i.m.) and atropine sulfate (2, 8 or 16 mg/kg, i.m.). In animals that displayed seizures and convulsions, diazepam (5 mg/kg, i.m.) was administered 10 min following the onset of epileptiform activities. Responses to pretreatment/therapy modality were evaluated at 24 h post-VR. All animals survived the 2 x LD50 VR challenge. With the exception of an increased heart rate in response to atropine, the myocardial and diaphragmatic (respiratory) activity profiles appeared normal throughout the course of intoxication and recovery. Animals receiving 2 mg/kg atropine all developed fasciculations, seizures, signs of excessive mucoid/salivary secretion, and needed diazepam adjunct therapy. One-half (50%) of the animals receiving 8 mg/kg atropine developed seizure activities and were given diazepam, whereas the other half only showed a brief period of increase in CNS excitability. No fasciculations, seizures or convulsions were noted in animals receiving 16 mg/kg atropine. In summary, although lethality can be prevented with the pretreatment/therapy modality containing 2 mg/kg atropine and diazepam adjunct, a complete CNS and cardiorespiratory recovery from 2 x LD50 of VR requires a minimum of 8 mg/kg atropine.", 
    "93": "Partial volume effects in positron emission tomography (PET) lead to quantitative under- and over-estimations of the regional concentrations of radioactivity in reconstructed images and corresponding errors in derived functional or parametric images. The limited resolution of PET leads to \"tissue-fraction\" effects, reflecting underlying tissue heterogeneity, and \"spillover\" effects between regions. Addressing the former problem in general requires supplementary data, for example, coregistered high-resolution magnetic resonance images, whereas the latter effect can be corrected for with PET data alone if the point-spread function of the tomograph has been characterized. Analysis of otherwise homogeneous region-of-interest data ideally requires a combination of tissue classification and correction for the point-spread function. The formulation of appropriate algorithms for partial volume correction (PVC) is dependent on both the distribution of the signal and the distribution of the underlying noise. A mathematical framework has therefore been developed to accommodate both of these factors and to facilitate the development of new PVC algorithms based on the description of the problem. Several methodologies and algorithms have been proposed and implemented in the literature in order to address these problems. These methods do not, however, explicitly consider the noise model while differing in their underlying assumptions. The general theory for estimation of regional concentrations, associated error estimation, and inhomogeneity tests are presented in a weighted least squares framework. The analysis has been validated using both simulated and real PET data sets. The relations between the current algorithms and those published previously are formulated and compared. The incorporation of tensors into the formulation of the problem has led to the construction of computationally rapid algorithms taking into account both tissue-fraction and spillover effects. The suitability of their application to dynamic and static images is discussed.", 
    "94": "The use of intranasal (IN) midazolam in adults for sedation in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy has been evaluated in a controlled clinical study. Eighty-one patients with a mean age of 37.02 +/- 12.50 years who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for various reasons were included in the study. Three groups were formed according to the sedation regimen. In the first group (n = 30), patients received IN midazolam. In the second group (n = 28) intravenous (IV) midazolam was given for sedation, and the third group of patients (n = 23) received placebo before the procedures. Patients were monitored (using a pulse oximeter with an interval of 5 minutes until the 45th minute after the procedure) for arterial oxygen saturation, heart rate, systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure, and respiratory rate. Efficacy of sedation, amnesia, side effects, and patients' preferences were evaluated. Superior results regarding the efficacy of sedation has been documented with the use of IV midazolam (p < 0.001), and this was the preferred route for drug application according to the patients' answers (p < 0.01). However, regarding amnesia, IN midazolam was found to be almost equally effective as IV midazolam (p < 0.05); moreover, IN route of drug application caused significantly fewer side effects than did the IV form (p < 0.001 ). Intranasal application of midazolam for gastrointestinal endoscopy appeared to be an interesting alternative to the IV route, the usage of which might be limited because of its potentially serious side effects. In contrast to the IV application of midazolam, the IN route may not even necessitate the monitoring of the patient during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.", 
    "95": "HIV infection and psychotic illnesses frequently coexist. The atypical antipsychotic olanzapine is metabolized primarily by CYP1A2 and glucuronosyl transferases, both of which are induced by the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of olanzapine. Fourteen healthy volunteers (13 men; age range, 20-28 years) participated in this open-label study. Subjects received olanzapine 10 mg and blood samples were collected over a 120-hour post-dose period. Two weeks later, subjects took ritonavir 300 mg twice daily for 3 days, 400 mg twice daily for 4 days, and 500 mg twice daily for 4 days. The next morning, after 11 days of ritonavir, olanzapine 10 mg was administered and blood sampling was repeated. Plasma samples were analyzed for olanzapine with HPLC. We compared olanzapine noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameter values before and after ritonavir with a paired Student t test. Ritonavir reduced the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of olanzapine from 501 ng. hr/mL (443-582) to 235 ng. hr/mL (197-294) (p < 0.001), the half-life from 32 hours (28-36) to 16 hours (14-18) (p = 0.00001), and the peak concentration from 15 ng/mL (13-19) to 9 ng/mL (8-12) (p = 0.002). Olanzapine oral clearance increased from 20 L/hr (18-23) to 43 L/hr (38-51) (p < 0.001) after ritonavir. Ritonavir significantly reduced the systemic exposure of olanzapine in volunteers. Patients receiving this combination may ultimately require higher olanzapine doses to achieve desired therapeutic effects.", 
    "96": "Patients with schizophrenia show a loss of sensory (motor) gating, which is reflected in a reduced prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex. Furthermore, patients with schizophrenia habituate less than healthy subjects. From previous studies, it is clear that typical antipsychotics have little or no effect on either sensorimotor gating or habituation, while only limited data is available on the effects of atypical antipsychotics on these processes.Forty-four schizophrenic patients (27 stable on typical and 17 stable on atypical antipsychotics) and 35 healthy control subjects were tested in a PPI paradigm. The prepulse and startle stimuli were pure tones of 1500 Hz (duration 40 ms, intensity 80 dB and 110 dB respectively), with a fixed interstimulus interval of 120 milliseconds. Block effects in PPI and startle amplitude to the pulse alone trials (habituation) were analyzed over the three groups, using comedication (i.e., benzodiazepines) as a covariate. Main effect for block was found for startle amplitude (habituation), while main effects for group and block were found for percentage PPI. Further analysis displayed significant differences in PPI between the patients treated with typical antipsychotics and the healthy control group, while patients treated with atypical antipsychotics did not differ from either the healthy control group, or the patients treated with typical antipsychotics. Furthermore, post-hoc division of the patients treated with atypical antipsychotics in patients treated with clozapine and risperidone revealed that this superiority from atypical antipsychotics over typical antipsychotics appeared to be mainly based on the effects of clozapine. Patients with schizophrenia who are treated with atypical antipsychotics appear to have levels of sensorimotor gating that are more consistent with healthy controls than patients who are treated with typical antipsychotics. Furthermore, within the class of atypical antipsychotics, clozapine appears most potent in restoring this process.", 
    "97": "After the reported successful use of dexmedetomidine to sedate patients in the intensive care unit without respiratory depression, we began to use dexmedetomidine for interventional neuroradiologic procedures. We report on five patients who had dexmedetomidine administered for sedation during embolization of cerebral arteriovenous malformations. All patients were comfortably sedated and breathing spontaneously. However, although patients were awake and following simple commands 10 minutes after the discontinuation of the infusion of dexmedetomidine, they were nevertheless unable to undergo cognitive testing. They were still unable to undergo cognitive testing 45 minutes after the infusion was stopped. In contrast, 10 minutes after the discontinuation of the infusion of propofol, all patients were awake, alert, cooperative, and able to undergo cognitive testing without difficulty. In conclusion, on examination of five non-randomly selected case records, we found that dexmedetomidine significantly prevented neurologic and cognitive testing.", 
    "98": "Despite the fact that ethanol is one of the most widely used psychoactive agents, the mechanisms and sites of action by which it modifies brain functions are only now being elucidated. Studies over the last decade have shown that ethanol can specifically alter the function of several ligand-activated ion channels including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), serotonin (5-HT(3)), glycine and GABA(A) receptors. After several years of extensive research in this field, the resolution of what, where and how ethanol modifies GABA(A) receptors continues to be controversial. For example, after demonstrating that ethanol was able to alter Cl(-) flux in synaptoneurosomes and cultured neurons, several electrophysiological studies were unable to show enhancement of the GABA(A) receptor current in single neurons. The lack of positive results with low ethanol concentrations was interpreted as being due to receptor heterogeneity and differences in intracellular modulation by protein kinases and calcium. The existence of high receptor heterogeneity with respect to ethanol sensitivity has been supported by studies done in a variety of cell types which showed that ethanol potentiated some, but not other neurons. Adding to this complexity, it was shown that while some hippocampal GABA(A) receptors can be affected by ethanol concentrations between 1 and 100 mM, others are only sensitive to concentrations above 200 mM. The curve of the relationship between low ethanol concentrations and current enhancement suggests a high degree of complexity in the molecular interaction because of its steepness and \"inverted\" U shape. Similarly, the effects of ethanol on GABA(A) receptors seems much more complex than those of benzodiazepines, barbiturates and neurosteroids. The major problem encountered in advancing understanding of the mechanism of ethanol action in native neuronal receptors has been the large variability detected in ethanol sensitivity. For example, several studies have shown that only some groups of neurons are sensitive to pharmacologically relevant concentrations of ethanol (1-100 mM). This receptor sensitivity variability has not been resolved using recombinant expression systems. For example, studies performed in recombinant receptors, although important for elucidating molecular requirements, have shown that they are less sensitive to ethanol suggesting that neuronal substrates are important for ethanol actions. In this review, we discuss the possibility that ethanol's action on the GABA(A) receptor may not be due solely to a direct interaction with the receptor protein, but that its effects could also be modulated by intracellular regulation, and that this latter effect is the more physiologically relevant one. Data in cortical and hippocampal neurons suggest that ethanol action on the receptor is labile, and that it also depends on repetitive stimulation and neuron integrity. In addition, the action of ethanol can be modified by activation of protein kinases and neuronal development. Finally, we discuss that the best approach for studying the interaction between the receptor and ethanol is through the combined use of recombinant receptors and overexpression in neurons.",

Natural compounds, structurally related to flavonoids and with similar CNS-activities, are also included. A medicinal chemistry approach to improve the biochemical and pharmacological properties of the flavone nucleus is described alongside with the enumeration of the principal achievements obtained to date.

    "100": "Considerable evidence has been provided these last years for the involvement of the GABAA receptor complex in memory processes. Compounds that enhance the action of GABA, such as benzodiazepines, impair memory processing. On the contrary, compounds that reduce the action of GABA, such as -CCM, pentylenetetrazol or picrotoxin, have the opposite action, that is : enhance memory processing. All these actions seem to focus mainly on the acquisition (learning) processes. Depending on the dose, the same compounds also have effects on anxiety and on seizuring. Benzodiaze-pines are well-known anxiolytic and anticonvulsant agents whereas compounds that reduce the action of GABA have been found to produce anxiogenic and convulsant actions. The GABAA receptor complex might thus be the location of a possible link between a pathological state (epilepsy) and two normal functions (anxiety and learning). This link is likely to involve common genetic pathways. In the normal subject, these data also emphasize the idea that normal memory processing involves a moderate level of anxiety.", 
    "101": "Ligands of the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABAA receptor come in three flavors: positive allosteric modulators, negative allosteric modulators and antagonists, all of which can bind with high affinity. The GABA(A) receptor is a pentameric protein which forms a chloride selective ion channel and ligands of the benzodiazepine binding site stabilize three different conformations of this receptor channel. Classical benzodiazepines exert a positive allosteric effect by increasing the affinity of channel opening by the agonist gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). We concentrate here on the major adult isoform, the alpha1beta2gamma2 GABA(A) receptor. The binding pocket for benzodiazepines is located in a subunit cleft between gamma2 and alpha1 subunits in a position homologous to the agonist binding site for GABA that is located between alpha1 and beta2 subunits. It is reviewed here how we arrived at this picture. In particular, point mutations were performed in combination with subsequent analysis of the expressed mutant proteins using either electrophysiological techniques or radioactive ligand binding assays. The predictive power of these methods is assessed by comparing the results with the predictions that can be made on the basis of the recently published crystal structure of the acetylcholine binding protein that shows homology to the N-terminal, extracellular domain of the GABA(A) receptor.", 
    "102": "GABA(A) receptors are the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain and are the site of action of many clinically important drugs. These receptors are composed of five subunits that can belong to eight different subunit classes. Depending on their subunit composition, these receptors exhibit distinct pharmacological and electrophysiological properties. Recent studies on recombinant and native GABA(A) receptors suggest the existence of far more receptor subtypes than previously assumed. Thus, receptors composed of one, two, three, four, or five different subunits might exist in the brain. Studies on the regional, cellular and subcellular distribution of GABA(A) receptor subunits, and on the co-localization of these subunits at the light and electron microscopic level for the first time provide information on the distribution of GABA(A) receptor subtypes in the brain. These studies will have to be complemented by electrophysiological and pharmacological studies on the respective recombinant and native receptors to finally identify the receptor subtypes present in the brain. The distinct cellular and subcellular location of individual receptor subtypes suggests that they exhibit specific functions in the brain that can be selectively modulated by subtype specific drugs. This conclusion is supported by the recent demonstration that different GABA(A) receptor subtypes mediate different effects of benzodiazepines. Together, these results should cause a revival of GABA(A) receptor research and strongly stimulate the development of drugs with a higher selectivity for alpha2-, alpha3-, or alpha5-subunit-containing receptor subtypes. Such drugs might exhibit quite selective clinical effects.",

    "112": "Total gastrectomy is followed by early satiety, low calorie intake, and weight loss in the majority of patients. The etiology of these effects is unknown. Sixty percent to 70% of patients remain underweight after total gastrectomy, the weight loss averaging 25% of preoperative body weight. About two thirds of gastrectomized patients report early satiety, and about 60% do not reach the recommended daily calorie intake. The NTS is a brain stem center involved in the regulation of food intake; thus, the extent and pattern of neuronal activation provide information on the process involved in the initiation of satiation and the regulation of food intake.",

Neuronal activation in the NTS in response to feeding was markedly increased up to fivefold in gastrectomized rats. This increase was early in onset and sustained, and occurred despite significantly reduced food intake. Administration of MK329, a CCK-A receptor antagonist, significantly reduced the number of postprandially activated neurons in both gastrectomized and control rats.",

    "116": "A single episode of status epilepticus (SE) induces neuropathological changes in the brain that may lead to the development of a permanent epileptic condition. Most studies of this plasticity have focused on the hippocampus, where both synaptic function and intrinsic neuronal excitability have been shown to be persistently modified by SE. However, many other brain structures are activated during SE and may also be involved in the subsequent epileptogenic process. Here we have investigated whether SE, induced in rats with pilocarpine and terminated after 40 min with diazepam, persistently modifies the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons in the subiculum. Subicular slices were prepared from control and SE-experienced rats (2-5 weeks after SE). In the control group, only 4% of the neurons fired bursts in response to intrasomatic, threshold-straddling depolarizing current pulses (low-threshold bursters). The remaining neurons either fired bursts in response to strong (3x threshold) depolarizations (35%; high-threshold bursters) or fired in a completely regular mode (61%; nonbursters). In the SE-experienced group, the fractions of low- and high-threshold bursters markedly increased to 29% and 53%, respectively. This change in firing behaviour was associated with a marked increase in the size of the spike after depolarization, particularly in low-threshold bursters. Experimental suppression of Ca2+ currents selectively blocked low-threshold bursting but did not affect high-threshold bursting, suggesting that a dual Ca2+- dependent and Ca2+- independent mechanism controls bursting in these neurons. The persistent up-regulation of intrinsic bursting in the subiculum, in concert with similar changes in the hippocampus, undoubtedly contributes to epileptogenesis following pilocarpine-induced SE.",

Either at 4 or 20 degrees, midazolam was oxidised by PCLS at similar rates to that observed in freshly cut slices. Moreover, PCLS kept a regioselectivity since 4-hydroxylation was more important than 1'-hydroxylation. Conversely, PCLS totally lost their capacity to oxidise midazolam after 20hr at 37 degrees, and both CYP3A2 protein and mRNA were not detected. CYP3A1 protein was unaffected by a temperature of 37 degrees but its mRNA was totally lost. By blocking transcription with actinomycin D, the decay of both CYP3A mRNAs followed the same profile at either 20 or 37 degrees, indicating that temperature affected the CYP3A2 protein stability. Cell functionality was not involved in such an impairment since the low values of ATP, GSH and protein synthesis rates observed at 4 and 20 degrees were rapidly restored, when PCLS were further incubated at 37 degrees. The use of rat supersomes expressing either CYP3A1 or CYP3A2, strongly supported the hypothesis that 4-hydroxymidazolam was mainly formed by CYP3A2. These results suggest that: (1) CYP3A1 protein is constitutive and largely expressed in rat liver slices; (2) regioselective midazolam oxidation appears to be mainly CYP3A2 dependent; and (3) since CYP3A isoforms have similar half-lives (about 10-14hr), the loss of CYP3A2 protein at 37 degrees might be due to a selective targeting (phosphorylation ?) leading to proteolytic disposal by the proteasome.",

We thus decided to assess the value of olanzapine in the treatment of chronic refractory headache.", 
    "124": "We reviewed the records of 50 patients with refractory headache who were treated with olanzapine for at least 3 months. All previously had failed treatment with at least four preventative medications. The daily dose of olanzapine varied from 2.5 to 35 mg; most patients (n = 19) received 5 mg or 10 mg (n = 17) a day.", 
    "125": "Treatment resulted in a statistically significant decrease in headache days relative to baseline, from 27.5 +/- 4.9 before treatment to 21.1+/-10.7 after treatment (P <.001, Student t test). The difference in headache severity (0 to 10 scale) before treatment (8.7+/-1.6) and after treatment (2.2 +/- 2.1) was also statistically significant (P <.001).", 
    "126": "Olanzapine may be effective for patients with refractory headache, including those who have failed a number of other prophylactic agents. Olanzapine should receive particular consideration for patients with refractory headache who have mania, bipolar disorder, or psychotic depression or whose headaches previously responded to other neuroleptic medications.", 
    "127": "We investigated the effect of midazolam pre-medication on rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade during sevoflurane anaesthesia. Twenty-two patients scheduled for elective surgery were randomly divided to receive either no pre-medication (control group) or pre-medication with 0.1 mg/kg midazolam intramuscularly (midazolam group). Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl and propofol, and maintained with sevoflurane and nitrous oxide in oxygen. Neuromuscular responses were monitored using acceleromyography. The onset and clinical duration of action, time to recovery of first twitch of train-of-four (TOF) response to 75% of control, recovery index and time for TOF recovery to 25% and 50% were recorded. Patient-related data were similar in both groups. The parameters recorded were not significantly different between the groups. Midazolam pre-medication does not influence the time-course of action of rocuronium during sevoflurane anaesthesia.", 
    "128": "The effect of the additional administration of midazolam or flumazenil on bispectral index (BIS) during propofol anesthesia was investigated in 22 scheduled surgical patients. Midazolam 10 or 30 micrograms.kg-1, or flumazenil 6 or 12 micrograms.kg-1 was injected to the patients to evaluate their effect on BIS after achieving steady state of hypnosis more than 1 hr of propofol anesthesia with 5 mg.kg-1.hr-1. The only midazolam 30 micrograms.kg-1 significantly reduced BIS value from 47.8 +/- 8.6 to 36.8 +/- 6.5. The synergistic interaction between midazolam and propofol assessed by BIS might be less clear than that assessed by hypnotic dose of propofol using psychopharmacological investigation.", 
    "129": "Clonazepam, which presently is recommended for the treatment of seizure disorders, has been reported to be useful as an adjunctive treatment for depression. The purpose of this paper was to examine the suitable adjunctive dose and the characteristics of clonazepam for the treatment of protracted depression. A hundred protracted depressive patients treated with clonazepam were studies by the retrospective method. A daily dose of 3.0 mg clonazepam as augmentation expressed high effectiveness (78.4%) on protracted depression. Most of the improved patients showed a rapid onset of action within two weeks. Gender, age, phase number, family history of psychosis, and clinical symptoms did not change the effectiveness of clonazepam treatment. A daily dose of at least 3.0 mg clonazepam as augmentation of ongoing antidepressant treatment should be considered for protracted depressive patients with suboptimal improvement. Unipolar depression was significantly more effective than bipolar depression on clonazepam treatment. The clear-cut difference in response to unipolar and bipolar depression suggests that the underlying abnormality in unipolar depression is not the same as that in bipolar depression. A continuance of clonazepam after improvement disturbed the recurrence of depression, and it seems that clonazepam augmentation has a preventive effect.", 
    "130": "Rhabdomyolysis is known as one of the possible causes of acute renal failure and can be triggered by different situations. In recent years, Parkinson's disease emerged as a condition that can be complicated by the development of rhabdomyolysis and consequently, in some cases, of acute renal failure. We report two cases of rhabdomyolysis, one of which complicated by an oligo-anuric renal failure, which occurred in patients affected by Parkinson's disease and admitted to our Division.", 
    "131": "The first case occurred in a 90-year-old Parkinsonian woman, under treatment with Levodopa-Benserazide and Bornaprine. She developed rhabdomyolysis (CPK 1746 U/L with MB isoenzyme 3.5 ng/ml, LDH 610 U/L, GOT 78 U/L) after she had been found lying on the floor, in a state of mental confusion, after 24 hours in which her relatives had not heard from her. During the first two days of hospitalization, the patient also had a fever (axillary temperature between 37 degrees C and 38 degrees C), accompanied by mild leukocytosis (WBC 13000/mm3) on entrance. The second case occurred in a 78-year-old Parkinsonian woman, under treatment with Levodopa-Carbidopa, Levodopa-Benserazide and Pramipexol. She developed a severe rhabdomyolysis (CPK 34800 U/L with MB isoenzyme 771 ng/ml, LDH 2133 U/L, GOT 785 U/L) complicated by acute renal failure with anuria, after two days characterized by several episodes of vomit and diarrhea. In the following days we learned that in the last 20 days before admission to hospital the patient had increased the dose of her anti-Parkinson therapy and was almost always disturbed by severe choreiform and dystonic movements.", 
    "132": "Regarding the first case, the clinical conditions in which the patient was found, the simultaneous presence of fever and leukocytosis and the absence of any reasonable explanation for a hypothetical fall to the floor induced us to think that this was a case of rhabdomyolysis in the context of an akinetic hyperthermic crisis. This is a syndrome that can develop in Parkinsonian patients after discontinuance or simply reduction of therapy with dopaminergic agents and is characterized also by rhabdomyolysis. The fact that the patient was living alone would confirm this hypothesis. On the other hand, the second case of rhabdomyolysis must probably be related to the severe choreiform and dystonic movements that the patient developed in the days just prior to admission. These movements were surely caused by the increase of the substitutive therapy with Levodopa by the patient herself. In conclusion, these two clinical cases, together with others previously reported by other Authors, show how the circumstances leading to the development of acute episodes of rhabdomyolysis in Parkinson's disease can be different and, at the same time, how these circumstances are always somehow related to the treatment of the basic disease with dopaminergic drugs.", 
    "133": "By preventing and optimizing emesis control in patients receiving chemotherapy, clinicians may significantly improve patients' functional status and quality of life. Improved tolerability may lead to greater patient acceptance of chemotherapy and prevent premature withdrawal or cessation of treatment. Controlling chemotherapy-induced emesis also helps to decrease the direct and indirect costs of managing cancer. This article reviews improvements made in antiemetic therapy and considers how the addition of lorazepam may further optimize the prevention and management of emesis at various stages of manifestation.", 
    "134": "The presence of molecules with high affinity for central and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors was determined in the pod and leaves of Ceratonia siliqua (carob). The amount of the substances able to selectively bind the central benzodiazepine receptor recovered from carob pods and leaves was respectively 12.17 and 18.7 ng diazepam equivalent/g. The amount of compounds active on peripheral benzodiazepine receptor in both pods and leaves was higher in comparison with the central one, being 49.83 and 40.00 PK 11195 equivalent/g, respectively. In particular the compounds acting on peripheral benzodiazepine receptors were found to be extremely concentrated in the young leaves (2572.57 ng PK 11195 equivalent/g). The presence of substances with central benzodiazepine activity in carob extracts seems of great importance in view of the possibility to use carob extract as potential natural products with anxiolytic-sedative effects. Moreover, the prevalence in leaves of substances acting on peripheral benzodiazepine receptor suggests the possible utilisation of leave extracts as chemopreventive agents.", 
    "135": "Patient preferences play an important role when choosing between different treatment options and may have an influence on outcome. We performed a study to investigate (1) to what extent patients make use of the offer to receive acupuncture as a pretreatment for gastroscopy, (2) whether this is perceived as being as effective as sedation, and (3) whether characteristics and outcomes differ between patients giving consent to random allocation and patients choosing their pretreatment.",

Oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and heart rate were significantly lower in patients receiving midazolam. Characteristics and outcomes of randomized and nonrandomized patients did not differ significantly.",

The partially randomized patient preference design is recommended for use in future trials of acupuncture for gastroscopy. Such trials should be performed in an outpatient setting.", 
    "142": "Exposure to soman, a toxic organophosphate nerve agent, causes severe adverse effects and long term changes in the peripheral and central nervous systems. The goal of this study was to evaluate the ability of prophylactic treatments to block the deleterious effects associated with soman poisoning. scopolamine, a classical anticholinergic agent, or caramiphen, an anticonvulsant anticholinergic drug with anti-glutamatergic properties, in conjunction with pyridostigmine, a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor, were administered prior to sbman (1 LD50). Both caramiphen and scopolamine dramatically attenuated the process of cell death as assessed by the binding of [3H]RoS-4864 to peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (omega3 sites) on microglia and astrocytes. In addition, caramiphen but not scopolamine, blocked the soman-evoked down-regulation of [3H]AMPA binding to forebrain membrane preparations. Moreover, cognitive tests utilizing the Morris water maze, examining learning and memory processes as well as reversal learning, demonstrated that caramiphen abolished the effects of soman intoxication on learning as early as the first trial day, while scopolamine exerted its effect commencing at the second day of training. Whereas the former drug completely prevented memory deficits, the latter exhibited partial protection. Both agents equally blocked the impairment of reversal learning. In addition, there is a significant correlation between behavioral parameters and [3H]RoS-4864 binding to forebrain membrane preparations of rats, which participated in these tests (r(21) = 0.66, P < 0.001; r(21) = 0.66, P < 0.001, -0.62, P < 0.002). These results demonstrate the beneficial use of drugs exhibiting both anti-cholinergic and anti-glutamatergic properties for the protection against changes in cognitive parameters caused by nerve agent poisoning. Moreover, agents such as caramiphen may eliminate the need for multiple drug therapy in organophosphate intoxications.", 
    "143": "The high affinity binding sites for serotonin and benzodiazepine in the frontal cortex, for dopamine in the striatum and muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the hippocampus were investigated in the brains of Charles Foster rats treated for 3 days. Transfer latency on elevated plus maze (TL), passive and active avoidance behaviour (PA and AA) and electroconvulsive shock (ECS) induced amnesia were also studied. Pilot studies indicated that single dose administration of Indian Hypericum perforatum (IHp) had little or no acute behavioural effects and hence the extract of IHp was administered orally at two dose levels (100 and 200 mg/kg, p.o.) once daily for 3 consecutive days, while piracetam (500 mg/kg, i.p.), a clinically used nootropic agent, was administered acutely to rats as the standard nootropic agent. Control rats were treated with an equal volume of vehicle (0.3% carboxymethyl cellulose). The results indicate that IHp treatment caused a significant decrease in the binding of [3H] spiroperone (DA-D2 receptor) to the striatum and an increase in the binding of [3H] ketanserin (5-HT2A receptor) and [3H] flunitrazepam (BDZ receptor) to the frontal cortex in rats. Preliminary pharmacological studies with IHp extract indicate the presence of two major behavioural actions, namely, antidepressant and anxiolytic. The present findings tend to elucidate the mechanism of earlier observations, the downregulation of the dopamine D2 receptor being consonant with anxiolytic and the upregulation of 5-HT2A and BDZ receptors being consonant with antidepressant activity. Piracetam when given alone, shortened the TL on days 1, 2 and 9 day and also antagonized the amnesic effects of ECS on the TL significantly, whereas IHp antagonized the amnesia produced by ECS. IHp had no significant effect per se on the retention of the PA in rats but produced a significant reversal of ECS induced PA retention deficit. Piracetam showed a significant facilitatory effect per se on PA retention and also reversed the ECS induced impaired PA retention. In the AA test, piracetam facilitated the acquisition and retention of AA in rats but IHp had no effect per se. Both the doses of IHp and piracetam significantly attenuated the ECS induced impaired retention of AA. These results indicate a possible nootropic action of IHp in amnesic animals, which was comparable qualitatively to piracetam.", 
    "144": "Flumazenil antagonizes the effects of benzodiazepines at gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors in the central nervous system. Flumazenil has been reported to provoke panic attacks in patients with panic disorder (PD) but not in healthy controls. A rapid high-pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method was developed for determination of flumazenil in plasma samples from PD patients receiving flumazenil and the results obtained with that assay are reported here.", 
    "145": "Samples from 37 PD subjects receiving 2 mg of flumazenil intravenously were analyzed. Extraction under basic conditions was followed by an HPLC assay with UV detection (250 nm). Lamotrigine was used as intermal standard and a standard curve was constructed for each assay run. Flumazenil concentrations were measured in all the subjects in samples collected at 2 and 4 min after the drug administration and in some subjects, measurements were also done in samples collected at 7.5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min.", 
    "146": "The procedure was reproducible and linear (from 2.5 to 1000 ng/ml). At 2 and 4 min after flumazenil administration, the concentrations did not differ significantly between panicking and nonpanicking subjects, indicating that the pharmacokinetics of the drug is not the major determinant of the responses. There was a steep decline in the plasma concentration-time profile during the first 4 min, reflecting an extensive and rapid distribution after which the decline was slower.",

    "148": "The solubility of four benzodiazepines (BZPs) including diazepam (DIZ), lorazepam (LRZ) clonazepam (CLZ), and chlordiazepoxide (CHZ) in water-cosolvent (ethanol propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol 200) binary systems were studied. In general, increasing the volume fraction of cosolvents resulted in an increase in the solubility of benzodiazepines. The mole fraction solubilities were fitted to the various cosolvency models, namely extended Hildebrand approach (EHA), excess free energy (EFE), combined nearly ideal binary solvent/Redlich-Kister (CNIBS/R-K), general single model (GSM), mixture response surface (MR-S). double log-log (DL-L), and linear double log-log (LDL-L). The results showed that DL-L model was the best model in predicting the solubility of all drugs in all the water-cosolvent mixtures (OAE% = 4.71). The minimum and maximum errors were observed for benzodiazepine's solubility in water-propylene glycol and water-ethanol mixtures which were 2.67 and 11.78%, respectively. Three models (EFE, CNIBS/R-K and LDL-L) were chosen as general models for solubility descriptions of these structurally similar drugs in each of the solvent systems. Among these models, the EFE model was the best in predicting the solubility of benzodiazepines in binary solvent mixtures (OAE% = 11.19).", 
    "149": "alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor currents, evoked with the agonist kainate, were studied with the gramicidin perforated-patch-clamp technique in cultured rat spinal cord motoneurons. Kainate-induced currents could be blocked by the AMPA receptor antagonist LY 300164 and displayed an apparent strong inward rectification. This inward rectification was not a genuine property of AMPA receptor currents but was a result of a concomitant decrease in outward current at potentials positive to -40.5 +/- 1.3 mV. The AMPA receptor current itself was nearly linear (rectification index 0.91). The kainate-inhibited outward current had a reversal potential close to the estimated K(+) equilibrium potential and was blocked by 30 mM tetraethylammonium. When voltage steps were applied, it was found that kainate inhibited both the delayed rectifier K(+) current K(V) and the transient outward K(+) current, K(A). The kainate-induced inhibition of K(+) currents was dependent on ion flux through the AMPA receptor, because no change in the membrane conductance was noticed in the presence of LY 300164. Removing extracellular Ca(2+) had no effect, whereas replacing extracellular Na(+) or clamping the membrane close to the estimated Na(+) equilibrium potential during kainate application attenuated the inhibition of the K(+) current. Sustained Na(+) influx induced by application of the Na(+) ionophore monensin could mimic the effect of kainate on K(+) conductance. These findings demonstrate that Na(+) influx through AMPA receptors results in blockade of voltage-gated K(+) channels.", 
    "150": "The effects of the central-type benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil on renal vascular tone and its ability to reverse the benzodiazepine-induced vasodilation were investigated. The isolated and perfused rat kidney model was used. Flumazenil was unable to modify renal vascular resistance under basal conditions and in noradrenaline-pretreated kidneys. Relaxation induced by diazepam or clonazepam of noradrenaline-preconstricted renal vasculature was blunted by 10 microM flumazenil. These results suggest that central-type benzodiazepine receptors could be involved in benzodiazepine-induced renal vasodilation."
