    "47": "Comorbidity is the rule rather than the exception for substance use disorders, especially when they involve drugs other than alcohol. A common reaction of physicians to comorbidity is to attribute the substance use of addicted people to \"self-medicating\" with drugs of abuse. When an individual uses an abused drug nonmedically, he or she is seeking brain reward, not treatment. To confuse this drug-using behavior with treatment is to misunderstand addictive behavior and to encourage a false sense that the primary clinical task is to lower the dysphoria associated with the comorbid condition in order to stop the nonmedical drug use. Even the most effective treatment of comorbid disorders is unlikely to halt the addictive drug use. The best way to handle comorbidity (e.g., depression and alcoholism) is to consider each of the comorbid conditions to be a separate and serious illness deserving of effective and specific treatment and not to consider one to be a \"symptom\" of the other. While it is desirable to treat all comorbid conditions using the best practices for the treatment of that condition it is not reasonable to assume that one of the comorbid disorders is secondary to the other and therefore that treatment of the \"secondary\" disorder is irrelevant or unnecessary.", 
    "48": "Serotonin-1A (5-HT(1A)) receptors have been implicated in the symptoms of schizophrenia. However, there is limited in vivo evidence for an interaction of antipsychotic drugs with 5-HT(1A) receptor-mediated behavioral effects. We therefore investigated in rats the action of several antipsychotic drugs on prepulse inhibition (PPI), a measure of sensorimotor gating that is deficient in schizophrenia. Disruption of PPI at the 100-ms interstimulus interval (ISI), but not the 30-ms ISI, was induced by treatment with 0.5 mg/kg 8-hydroxy-di-propylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT), the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist. In rats pretreated with 0.25 mg/kg haloperidol (4-[-4-(p-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidino]-4'-fluoro butyrophenone) or raclopride [3,5-dichloro-N-(1-ethylpyrrolidin-2-ylmethyl)-2-hydroxy-6-methoxybenzamide tartrate], the disruption of PPI was no longer significant. Of the atypical antipsychotic drugs clozapine (8-chloro-11-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-5H-dibenzo[b,e][1,4]-diazepine), olanzapine (2-methyl-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-10H-thieno[2,3-b][1,5]benzodiazepine), risperidone [3-[2-[-4-(6-fluoro-1,2-benzisoxazol-3-yl) piperidino] ethyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one)], amisulpride (4-amino-N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-5-(ethylsulfonyl)-o-anisamide), and aripiprazole (7-[4-[-4[-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]butoxy]-3,4-dihydrocarbostyrilor 7-[4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl) piperazin-1-yl]butoxy]-1,2,3,4,-tetrahydroquinolin-2-one), only aripiprazole significantly reduced the effect of 8-OH-DPAT on PPI. This effect was mimicked by pretreatment with the 5-HT(1A) receptor partial agonist, buspirone [N-[4-[4-(2-pyrimidinyl)-1-piperazinyl]butyl]-8-azaspiro[4.5]decane-7,9-dione hydrochloride]. On the other hand, some of the antipsychotic drugs and other pretreatments showed complex, prepulse-dependent effects on their own. These data show little in vivo interaction of several atypical antipsychotic drugs with the disruption of PPI mediated by 5-HT(1A) receptor stimulation. The action of haloperidol and raclopride suggests a major involvement of dopamine D(2) receptors in this effect, possibly downstream from the initial serotonergic stimulation. The action of aripiprazole could be mediated by its partial agonist properties at 5-HT(1A) receptors or its dopamine D(2)-blocking properties.", 
    "49": "An anti-diazepam, molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) has been synthesized and used to extract diazepam and other benzodiazepines from hair samples via a molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE) protocol. Optimum retention of diazepam on the MIP columns was achieved using an apolar solvent, and the binding capacity of the polymer toward diazepam was found to be 110 ng of diazepam/mg of polymer. The recovery of a 50 ng diazepam standard spiked into blank hair was 93%, with good precision (RSD = 1.5%). The LOD and LOQ of diazepam in spiked hair samples were 0.09 and 0.14 ng/mg, respectively. The MISPE method was demonstrated to be applicable to the analysis of diazepam metabolites and other benzodiazepine drugs, in addition to diazepam itself. The application of the extraction method to postmortem hair samples yielded results that were in good agreement with the corresponding ELISA data (from blood samples) and data arising from the analysis of the same blood samples using a validated in-house SPE-LC-MS-MS method.", 
    "50": "This study investigated the individual differences in the baseline anxiety and anxiolytic effect of nitrazepam in Balb/c mice. Initially mice were sorted according into low, intermediate and high anxiety groups (LA, IA and HA) based on the number of entries to and time spent in open arms in elevated plus maze. Later, anxiolytic effect of nitrazepam (2 mg/kg, p.o) in LA, IA and HA mice was evaluated using hole board and light/dark tests. In Hole board test, LA mice made more number of head dippings and spent more time during head dippings, while HA mice made less number of head dippings and spent less time during head dipping when compared to that of IA mice. In light/dark test LA mice made more reentries to and spent more time in bright compartment, while HA mice made few reentries to and spent less time in bright compartment. Results suggest that mice of a single strain differ in their baseline anxiety and anxiolytic effect of nitrazepam.", 
    "51": "Increasing evidence from experimental studies and human observations suggests that drugs with anticholinergic properties can cause physical and mental impairment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the use of drugs with anticholinergic activity and measures of physical performance, muscle strength, and functional status in persons aged 80 years or older. Data are from baseline evaluation of 364 subjects enrolled in the ilSIRENTE study. The ilSIRENTE study is a prospective cohort study performed in the mountain community living in the Sirente geographic area (L'Aquila, Abruzzo) in Central Italy. Physical performance was assessed using the physical performance battery score (Short Physical Performance Battery), which is based on three timed tests: 4-meter walking speed, balance, and chair stand tests. Muscle strength was measured by hand grip strength. We defined as anticholinergic drugs all medications for which serum anticholinergic activity was previously demonstrated. Analyses of covariance were performed to evaluate the relationship of anticholinergic drugs with physical function. In the unadjusted model, all the physical performance, muscle strength, and functional measures showed significant associations with the anticholinergic drug use. After adjustment for potential confounders (age, gender, smoking, physical activity level, cognitive performance score, living alone, body mass index, congestive heart failure, lung diseases, diabetes), these associations were weaker but still statistically significant (physical performance battery score: non-users anticholinergic drugs 6.9, SE 0.1, users anticholinergic drugs 6.1, SE 0.2, P=0.05; hand grip strength: non-users anticholinergic drugs 31.3 kg, SE 0.8, users anticholinergic drugs 28.8 kg, SE 1.0, P=0.05; Activities of Daily Living scale score: non-users anticholinergic drugs 1.2, SE 0.1, users anticholinergic drugs 1.6, SE 0.1, P=0.03; Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale score: non-users anticholinergic drugs 2.7, SE 0.1, users anticholinergic drugs 3.4, SE 0.1, P<0.001). The use of medication with anticholinergic properties is common among community older subjects in Italy. Our results suggest that among old-old subjects the use of anticholinergic drugs is associated with impaired physical performance and functional status.",

In this article, we review these intervention studies, and discuss DCS augmentation of CBT relative to more traditional combination-treatment strategies in the treatment of anxiety disorders. We offer an accounting, based on evidence for internal context effects, of current limitations in the combination of antidepressant or benzodiazepine medications with CBT and discuss the advantages of isolated-dosing strategies with DCS relative to these limitations. This strategy is contrasted with the chronic-dosing applications of DCS for schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, and future directions for isolated-dosing strategies are discussed.",

    "58": "Allosteric modulators of ligand-receptor interactions are found for a variety of receptors (Christopoulos, 2002). Allosteric agents attach to a binding site being topographically distinct from the site for conventional (orthosteric) agonists or antagonists. In the case of the muscarinic receptor, a huge selection of structurally divergent modulators has been described for different receptor subtypes (Mohr et al., 2003). Alkane-bisammonio-type compounds carrying lateral phthalimido substituents are known to have a high affinity for the common allosteric binding site of the muscarinic acetylcholine M2 receptor (mAChR M2), which is already occupied by the orthosteric antagonist N-methylscopolamine (NMS). The resulting allosteric inhibition of the dissociation of [3H]NMS from the M2 receptors in porcine cardiac homogenates served to indicate binding of the test compounds to the allosteric site. Additionally, allosteric modulators can strongly influence equilibrium binding of the orthosteric ligand: Its binding can be reduced, left unaltered or elevated, and encoded as negative, neutral, and positive cooperativity, respectively (Christopoulos and Kenakin, 2002). The cooperativity is strongly dependent on the pair of allosteric/orthosteric ligands and on the receptor subtype.",

Many options are available to treat insomnia, to assist with either falling asleep (sleep onset) or maintaining sleep. We searched MEDLINE for articles published between January 1996 and January 2006, evaluated abstracts from recent professional meetings, and contacted the manufacturer of the most recent addition to the pharmacologic armamentarium for insomnia treatment (ramelteon) to gather information. Nonpharmacologic options include stimulus control, sleep hygiene education, sleep restriction, paradoxical intention, relaxation therapy, biofeedback, and cognitive behavioral therapy. Prescription and over-the-counter drug therapies include benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic agents; ramelteon, a melatonin receptor agonist; trazodone; and sedating antihistamines. Herbal and alternative preparations include melatonin and valerian. Before recommending any treatment, clinicians should consider patient-specific criteria such as age, medical history, and other drug use, as well as the underlying cause of the sleep disturbance. All pharmacotherapy should be used with appropriate caution, at minimum effective doses, and for minimum duration of time.",

    "73": "Patients with epilepsy may suffer from renal or hepatic diseases that interfere with their antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. Furthermore, such diseases may themselves cause seizures. Reduced renal function and hypoalbuminemia lead to accumulation of renally excreted AEDs, such as gabapentin, vigabatrin, topiramate, levetiracetam, and phenytoin. Valproate, lamotrigine, and benzodiazepines are less affected. Low protein-bound AEDs are extensively removed by hemodialysis and supplemental doses are required for dialysis patients. Uremia and related conditions, including intracranial hemorrhage, glucose and electrolyte imbalances, and concomitant drug use, can cause seizures, as can dialysis encephalopathy, primary cerebral lymphoma, fungal infections, and immunosuppressant toxicity in renal transplant recipients. Hepatic dysfunction reduces enzymatic metabolism of AEDs and causes hypoalbuminemia. Gabapentin, topiramate, and levetiracetam are preferred in these conditions, whereas conversely valproate and felbamate are potentially hepatotoxic and should be avoided. Seizures related to hepatic encephalopathy are controlled by oral lactulose or neomycin. Porphyria sufferers may benefit from gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, or levetiracetam. Seizures in Wilson's disease may derive from d-penicillamine-induced pyridoxine deficiency. Effective treatment of seizures in renal and hepatic diseases requires attention to changes in AED pharmacokinetics and adequate care of the underlying illnesses. Monitoring of free drug concentrations is a valuable aid to therapy.",

Many agents have been evaluated in the search of the optimal regimen for sedation and analgesia in the ICU, including opioids, benzodiazepines, propofol, and antipsychotic agents. Dexmedetomidine has demonstrated efficacy as a sedative analgesic on the basis of its ability to lower opioid, benzodiazepine, and propofol requirements in clinical trials. The role of dexmedetomidine in ICU clinical practice is limited because of a lack of mortality and other morbidity endpoints, such as ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay, time to extubation, long-term complications after discharge from the ICU, and delirium. The most commonly reported adverse effects of dexmedetomidine are secondary to its effects as an alpha(2)-receptor agonist and are cardiac in nature.

    "101": "A gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for detection of diazepam, nordazepam and oxazepam is presented. The method associates electron capture ionization and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). No derivatization is performed; oxazepam undergoes thermal degradation during chromatographic injection and is thus quantified via its decomposition product. The negative molecular ions are so stable that they do not dissociate when collision is performed under \"classical\" conditions (i.e. with argon as collision gas). With xenon as collision gas, the energy transfer is sufficient to provide two product ions for diazepam and nordazepam and one product ion for the decomposition product of oxazepam. The sample preparation part involves liquid/liquid extraction with TOXI-TUBES A extraction tubes; it provides recovery yields between 68 and 95%, depending of the benzodiazepine considered, with coefficients of variation below 6% for 10 samples. The applicability of the method was demonstrated on urine extracts. From 1 mL of urine, the method provides quantitation limits of 0.15 ng/mL for diazepam, 1.0 ng/mL for nordazepam and 1.5 ng/mL for oxazepam.

All patients experienced severe pain and agitation, not well controlled by continuous infusion opioids and benzodiazepines. Upon starting propofol, most patients had a temporary stabilization in the dose of opioids with subjective improvement in pain control, increased alertness, and improved ability to interact. Propofol infusions were continued until death in most patients. Two patients received propofol infusions at home. Subsequent increases in opioids in 6 patients and propofol in all patients were required for optimal pain control. Adverse effects included agitation in 5 patients and hallucinations in 2, which were controllable with benzodiazepines. One patient developed severe tetany, requiring propofol interruption; propofol was successfully restarted at a lower dose with an adjuvant benzodiazepine. The authors conclude that propofol is a useful and tolerable adjuvant agent for pain management in pediatric oncology patients at the end of life. It is a useful adjuvant if pain is unresponsive to continuous infusion opioids or if rapidly escalating doses of opioids are required.",

The purpose of the study was to develop and assess the procedure of sevoflurane anesthesia during cardiosurgical and endovascular operations in children with congenital heart diseases. Twenty-five children aged 2-9 years (of them 15 children with congenital heart disease) operated on under extracorporeal circulation (EC) were examined. Ten children underwent X-ray surgical endovascular interventions: closure of the patent arterial duct with an \"Amplatzer ductus occluder\" system. The duration of operations under EC was 116 to 289 min; that of EC was 60-20 (49 +/- 8) min. Endovascular operations lasted 60-80 min. Premedication was made with ketamine, midazolam, and methacin during cardiosurgical operations. The children were referred without premedication, escorted by their parents for endovascular surgical interventions where in the parents' presence the children were given inhalational sevoflurane at a concentration of 5-6% through the mask of an anesthetic apparatus until they fell asleep. This made it possible to avoid the child's weeping and resistance and to puncture the peripheral vein without pain. Steady-state hemodynamics and metabolism suggest that combined anesthesia using sevoflurane at a concentration of 1.3-22% of the minimal alveolar one is adequate in correcting congenital heart disease in children. The application of this anesthetic procedure permitted extubation of 73% of children within 1-2 hours when their condition met the criteria for early activation and extubation.", 
    "123": "We have previously described a system that displays real-time estimates of effect-site sevoflurane concentrations. Estimates of effect-site levels should be similar to minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) values, which are determined after allowing time for equilibrium. This study aimed to determine estimated effect-site sevoflurane concentrations at awakening from routine anaesthesia and to compare this with published estimates of MAC-awake. If these values were similar; this would validate our approach to the calculation of effect-site concentration. Sixty-five patients undergoing a variety of surgical procedures were observed. Prior to disconnection from the breathing circuit, forward estimates of effect-site sevoflurane were recorded. Patients were observed in the post-anaesthesia care unit and the time at which they responded to command was recorded.Age-adjusted effect-site sevoflurane at the time of awakening was determined. Correlation with patient, surgical and anaesthetic factors including age, gender; ASA status and intraoperative opioid usage were explored. Mean age-adjusted calculated effect-site concentration at awakening was 0.59 (SD 0.27) vol%. This value is within the range of values determined for MAC-awake of sevoflurane. There was no correlation with any of the demographic or anaesthetic factors, but patients undergoing major surgery woke at a significantly lower mean sevoflurane level. These results support the use of effect-site sevoflurane concentration to guide administration of anaesthesia.", 
    "124": "Finding the predictors of outcome in outpatient cocaine dependence treatment trials may be useful for the development of both psychosocial as well as pharmacological treatments for cocaine dependence. Among the most powerful predictors of response to psychosocial treatment are cocaine withdrawal symptom severity and the results of a urine drug screen (UDS) collected at study entry. The present trial seeks to extend these findings by examining outcome predictors in a large number of subjects participating in a series of outpatient cocaine pharmacotherapy trials while selecting three separate criteria to define successful outcome. The ability of several baseline variables were tested to predict treatment outcome in a series of cocaine medication trials that included 402 cocaine-dependent subjects. Predictor variables included results from the baseline Addiction Severity Index (ASI), initial UDS results, and cocaine withdrawal symptom severity at treatment entry, as measured by scores on the Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment (CSSA). Outcome measures included UDS results obtained during the trials and results from the ASI gathered at the end of the trials. Baseline variables that most consistently predicted treatment outcome were the initial UDS results and initial CSSA scores. These findings indicate that baseline UDS results and CSSA scores are powerful predictors of outcome and should be used as stratifying variables in outpatient cocaine medication trials.", 
    "125": "Preoperative anxiety (anxiety regarding impending surgical experience) in children is a common phenomenon that has been associated with a number of negative behaviors during the surgery experience (e.g., agitation, crying, spontaneous urination, and the need for physical restraint during anesthetic induction). Preoperative anxiety has also been associated with the display of a number of maladaptive behaviors postsurgery, including postoperative pain, sleeping disturbances, parent-child conflict, and separation anxiety. For these reasons, researchers have sought out interventions to treat or prevent childhood preoperative anxiety and possibly decrease the development of negative behaviors postsurgery. Such interventions include sedative premedication, parental presence during anesthetic induction, behavioral preparation programs, music therapy, and acupuncture. The present article reviews the existing research on the various modes of intervention for preoperative anxiety in children. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed.", 
    "126": "Epilepsy in children is mostly diagnosed and treated in an ambulatory office setting. This article reviews the literature and offers opinions about the best practice from the time of diagnosis through to remission and beyond. The diagnosis and assignment of an epilepsy syndrome may be difficult, and even experts disagree in many cases. Regular review of the basic diagnosis and semiology of seizures is suggested throughout treatment. Workup should always include an electroencephalogram and usually magnetic resonance imaging. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) suppress seizures but appear to have little effect on long-term remission, and the choice of AED is for the most part arbitrary with most AEDs having a similar success rate when used as the first drug. Families have a great need for accurate information, and their ability to cope with the unpredictable nature of seizures may be assisted by \"rescue\" home benzodiazepines. Surveillance for drug toxicity and side effects is a critical clinical skill that is not assisted by routine blood tests or AED serum levels. Most children with epilepsy do not have many seizures and need not have significant restrictions on their activities. In the long run, comorbidities (especially learning and behavior problems) have a greater impact on social function than the epilepsy. Management of these problems may extend well beyond remission of the epilepsy. The child neurologist needs to prepare children with persistent epilepsy for transfer to adult epilepsy services.",

    "128": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disease of unclear, complex pathophysiology characterised by abdominal pain and discomfort and altered bowel activity. It affects an estimated 10-15% of individuals worldwide and has a large impact on quality of life (QOL) and both direct and indirect healthcare costs. Symptoms of IBS are usually triggered by disruption of gastrointestinal (GI) function secondary to infection, dietary factors, lifestyle changes or psychological stress. While most currently available pharmacological treatments of IBS focus on symptomatic treatment of the syndrome, agents that attempt to address the pathophysiology of the disease, in particular the role of serotonin, have received much attention in recent years. However, there is growing concern that serotonergic agents as a class may be associated with rare, but serious, episodes of ischaemic colitis, with several cases of this complication having been reported in association with use of serotonergic agents that have reached the market. Thus, there remains an important need for safe and effective agents that treat the symptoms of IBS. Otilonium bromide, a spasmolytic agent, has been widely used worldwide and has been found to be effective and safe for managing abdominal pain. Clinical trials indicate that it improves baseline abdominal pain and distension, and is particularly effective in reducing diarrhoea. Combining otilonium bromide with benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, may improve the efficacy of the agent with respect to GI symptoms, while also treating underlying anxiety disorders. More research is required to confirm the efficacy and mechanisms of action associated with this combination therapy in IBS. Safety data from clinical trials and postmarketing sources indicate that otilonium bromide is well tolerated, with a safety profile comparable to placebo in clinical trials and only two reported cases of adverse reactions (urticaria) among 10-year postmarketing data. This article reviews the pathophysiology and treatment of IBS with a particular focus on the role of otilonium bromide in the management of this condition.",

    "131": "Thirty years ago, psychiatrists had only a few choices of old neuroleptics available to them, currently defined as conventional or typical antipsychotics, as a result schizophrenics had to suffer the severe extra pyramidal side effects. Nowadays, new treatments are more ambitious, aiming not only to improve psychotic symptoms, but also quality of life and social reinsertion. Our objective is to briefly but critically review the advances in the treatment of schizophrenia with antipsychotics in the past 30 years. We conclude that conventional antipsychotics still have a place when just the cost of treatment, a key factor in poor regions, is considered. The atypical antipsychotic drugs are a class of agents that have become the most widely used to treat a variety of psychoses because of their superiority with regard to extra pyramidal symptoms. We can envisage different therapeutic strategies in the future, each uniquely targeting a different dimension of schizophrenia, be it positive, negative, cognitive or affective symptoms.",

Furthermore, although many tests are excellent tool for detecting benzodiazepines/GABA compounds, inconsistent results have been reported for 5-HT ligands. Here, two animal models have been chosen, the elevated plus maze (EPM) based on the natural aversion of rodents for open spaces and the four-plates test (FPT) a models involving the animal's conditioned response to stressful events. In a recent study, we have demonstrated that the 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist DOI and the 5-HT(2B) agonist BW 723C86 were shown to produce an anxiolytic-like effect in both tests. This study aimed to evaluate a putative interaction between benzodiazepine and 5-HT(2) ligands in the FPT and the EPM. Indeed, close distribution of GABA(A) and 5-HT(2) receptors was found in brain structures leading to functional interrelation. In the FPT, sub-active doses of alprazolam and diazepam were strongly potentiated by DOI. BW 723C86, also potentiated the anxiolytic-like effect of the two benzodiazepines with a weaker effect. In the same way, DOI and benzodiazepines administration induced an increase in the anxiolytic-like parameters in the EPM with a strongest effect observed with alprazolam. Regardless of anxiety models used in this study, 5-HT(2A) ligands exerted facilitatory influence upon GABAergic system. Therefore, the FPT and the EPM might implicate the same kind of anxiety.",

Here, we studied whether PBR is involved in Ca2+-induced permeability transition pore (PTP) opening in isolated rat brain mitochondria (RBM). PTP opening is important in mitochondrial events leading to programmed cell death. Immunoblots revealed a single 18 kDa anti-PBR antibody-immunoreactive band in purified RBM. Adenine nucleotide transporter, a key PTP component, was found in the PBR-immunoprecipitate. In isolated intact RBM, addition of a specific anti-PBR antibody [H. Li, Z. Yao, B. Degenhardt, G. Teper, V. Papadopoulos, Cholesterol binding at the cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC) of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor and inhibition of steroidogenesis by an HIV TAT-CRAC peptide, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 98 (2001) 1267-1272] delayed Ca2+-induced dissipation of membrane potential (psi(m)) and diminished cyclosporine A-sensitive Ca2+ efflux, which are both indicative for the suppression of PTP opening. Moreover, anti-PBR antibody caused partial retention of Ca2+ in the mitochondrial matrix in spite of psi(m) dissipation, and reduced activation of respiratory rate at Ca2+-induced PTP opening. A release of pro-apoptotic factors, AIF and cytochrome c, from RBM was shown at threshold Ca2+ load. Anti-PBR antibody blocked the release of AIF but did not affect the cytochrome c release. Addition of ATP was able to initiate PTP closing, associated with psi(m) restoration and Ca2+ re-accumulation. At the same time mitochondrial protein phosphorylation (incorporation of 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP) occurred and anti-PBR antibody was able to inhibit phosphorylation of these proteins. The endogenous PBR ligand, protoporphyrin IX, facilitated PTP opening and phosphorylation of the mitochondrial proteins, thus, inducing effects opposite to anti-PBR antibody. This study provides evidence for PBR involvement in PTP opening, controlling the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ efflux, and AIF release from mitochondria, important stages of initiation of programmed cell death.",

The acute effects of betaA (25-35 and 1-40) on action potential generation and glutamatergic synaptic transmission in slices of the medial septal area of the rat brain were studied using current and patch-clamp techniques. The betaA mechanism of action through M1 muscarinic receptors and voltage-dependent calcium channels was also addressed. Excitatory evoked responses decreased (30-60%) in amplitude after betaA (2 microM) perfusion in 70% of recorded cells. However, the firing properties were unaltered at the same concentration. This depression was irreversible in most cases, and was not prevented or reversed by nicotine (5 microM). In addition, the results obtained using a paired-pulse protocol support pre- and postsynaptic actions of the peptide. The betaA effect was blocked by calcicludine (50 nM), a selective antagonist of L-type calcium channels, and also by blocking muscarinic receptors with atropine (5 muM) or pirenzepine (1 microM), a more specific M1-receptor blocker. We show that in the medial septal area this oligomeric peptide acts through calcium channels and muscarinic receptors. As blocking any of these pathways blocks the betaA effects, we propose a joint action through both mechanisms. These results may contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology at the onset of AD. This understanding will be required for the development of new therapeutic agents.",

    "198": "The occupancy by lorazepam of the benzodiazepine binding site of rat brain GABA(A) receptors was compared when measured using either in vivo binding of [(3)H]flumazenil (8-fluoro 5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester) in terminal studies or [(11)C]flumazenil binding in anesthetized animals assessed using a small animal positron emission tomography (PET) scanner (micro-PET). In addition, as a bridging study, lorazepam occupancy was measured using [(3)H]flumazenil in vivo binding in rats anesthetized and dosed under micro-PET conditions. Plasma lorazepam concentrations were also determined, and for each occupancy method, the concentration required to produce 50% occupancy (EC(50)) was calculated because this parameter is independent of the route of lorazepam administration. For the in vivo binding assay, lorazepam was dosed orally (0.1-10 mg/kg), whereas for the micro-PET study, lorazepam was given via the i.v. route as a low dose (0.75 mg/kg bolus) and then a high dose (0.5 mg/kg bolus then 0.2 mg/ml infusion). The lorazepam plasma EC(50) in the [(11)C]flumazenil micro-PET study was 96 ng/ml [95% confidence intervals (CIs) = 74-124 ng/ml], which was very similar to the [(3)H]flumazenil micro-PET simulation study (94 ng/ml; 95% CI = 63-139 ng/ml), which in turn was comparable with the [(3)H]flumazenil in vivo binding study (134 ng/ml; 95% CI = 119-151 ng/ml). These data clearly show that despite the differences in dosing (i.v. in anesthetized versus orally in conscious rats) and detection (in vivo dynamic PET images versus ex vivo measurements in filtered and washed brain homogenates), [(11)C]flumazenil micro-PET produces results similar to [(3)H]flumazenil in vivo binding.",

It was found, however, not to be effective in all cases and for the provision of all types of paediatric dentistry. The results indicate that, when using oral midazolam in children, the treatment should be restricted to simple restorations and extractions over a maximum of two visits.", 
    "204": "Opioids are frequently used in chronic cancer and non-cancer pain conditions. Addiction may develop during long-term opioid treatment and illegally as intravenous \"street\" addiction. Benzodiazepines are frequently used for legal indications. However, due to widespread misuse efforts are being made to limit consumption. Finally, an increasing number of illegal drugs--sedatives as well as psychoactive drugs--have recently been introduced to the illegal market. This review gives guidelines for the perioperative management of patients using and misusing these drugs.", 
    "205": "Altered cellular bioenergetics are implicated in many disease processes, and modulating the F 1 F o -ATPase, the enzyme responsible for producing the majority of ATP in eukaryotic cells, has been proposed to have therapeutic utility. Bz-423 is a 1,4-benzodiazepine that binds to the oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein subunit of the mitochondrial F 1 F o -ATPase and inhibits the enzyme. In response to Bz-423, cells moderately decrease ATP synthesis and significantly increase superoxide, resulting in redox-regulated apoptosis. Administering Bz-423 to autoimmune mice leads to apoptosis of pathogenic cells and potent attenuation of disease progression. To determine if a mechanism of action distinguishes Bz-423 from toxic F 1 F o -ATPase inhibitors like oligomycin, we studied how both compounds inhibit the enzyme. Oligomycin is a high-affinity mixed inhibitor, displaying time-dependent inhibition, resulting in severe depletion of ATP. In contrast, Bz-423 is an allosteric inhibitor with lower affinity that rapidly dissociates from the enzyme. Our data support a model in which the interplay of these features underlies the favorable properties of Bz-423. They also represent key criteria for the development of therapeutic F 1 F o -ATPase inhibitors, which should have utility across a range of areas.",

Before random assignment, participants completed a pretest and attended a 3-hour didactic session on prescribing opioids and benzodiazepines. The intervention group participated in 10 weeks of e-mail case discussions, with designated participants responding to questions on cases. An addictions physician facilitated the discussion. Several months after the e-mail discussion, participants took part in a mock telephone consultation; a blinded researcher posing as a medical colleague asked for advice about 2 cases involving opioid and benzodiazepine prescribing. Using a checklist, the researcher recorded the questions asked and advice given by the physician.",

Valproic acid and phenobarbital monotherapy controlled seizures but exacerbated porphyric symptomatology, while clobazam, clonazepam and lamotrigine monotherapy were well tolerated as regards porphyric disturbances but did not completely control seizures. Tonic- clonic seizures were eventually controlled by a combination of clonazepam (9 mg/day) and lamotrigine (150 mg/day), but absences persisted and this treatment caused significant adverse effects consisting of sedation and memory disturbances. Levetiracetam monotherapy (3 g/day) was accompanied by complete control of seizures; memory disturbances and sedation also resolved, and no porphyrinogenetic activity of levetiracetam was observed. This is the first report of the safe use of levetiracetam in porphyria cutanea tarda.",

In the dexamethasone-plus-ginger-treated group, 12 patients experienced nausea, one patient retched, four patients vomited once, no patients vomited repeatedly, and 13 patients required a rescue antiemetic. Dexamethasone plus ginger did not significantly reduce nausea and vomiting compared with dexamethasone alone during the observation period.",

Any insomnia was reported by 37% of the sample, moderate insomnia by 12%, insomnia with fatigue by 13%, and symptoms fulfilling diagnostic criteria for primary/secondary insomnia by 5%. All categories of insomnia were associated with mental disorders, worse physical health, and fatigue to a similar degree in all decade age groups. The associations between insomnia categories and separated, divorced, or widowed marital status were strongest in younger participants. Insomnia categories were of longer reported duration and more strongly associated with worse physical health-related quality of life (SF-12) in older age groups. For participants with any definition of insomnia, benzodiazepine hypnotics were more commonly reported in older age groups.",

Subjects with greater lifetime impairment due to BDD were more likely to have received pharmacotherapy, and subjects with lifetime OCD or greater lifetime impairment due to BDD were more likely to have received an SRI specifically. Subjects revealed their BDD symptoms to only 41.0% of pharmacotherapists. Only 12.9% of SRI trials were considered optimal for BDD, and an additional 21.5% were considered minimally adequate. SRI trials that were considered optimal or at least minimally adequate for BDD were associated with greater improvement in BDD and less severe current BDD symptoms than non-optimal or inadequate SRI trials.",

Treatment with olanzapine for 8 weeks improved both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It also increased the plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol levels, which were associated with the changes in the total scores of negative symptoms measured on the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale, and decreased the plasma homovanillic acid levels. In addition, treatment with olanzapine for 8 weeks reduced the plasma interleukin-2 levels. In contrast, olanzapine did not alter the plasma levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, interleukin-6, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. These results suggest that olanzapine influences the dynamics of catecholamine and interleukin-2, which might be associated with its clinical efficacy.", 
    "226": "Concern is mounting that atypical antipsychotics cause disturbance in glucose regulation ranging from reversible hyperglycemia to diabetic ketoacidosis and death. It is difficult, however, to know what the level of risk of hyperglycemia might be for an individual patient on a particular medication of this class. We conducted a retrospective nonrandomized cohort analysis of glucose measurements in 18,764 patients receiving outpatient prescriptions for olanzapine, risperidone, or typical antipsychotics from 1 October 1998 to 30 June 2003 at six Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in the southeast United States. In patients without a random plasma glucose measurement > or =160 mg/dl before medication exposure (n=1394), treatment with index medications was associated with an incidence of new diabetes-level hyperglycemia of 78.7 cases per 1,000 individuals exposed per year. Olanzapine exposure was associated with a greater rate of developing at least one glucose measurement > or =200 mg/dl than risperidone (odds ratio=2.14, P=0.003). Olanzapine exposure was also associated with a greater rate of development of at least one fasting glucose measurement > or =126 mg/dl than risperidone. Typical antipsychotics were associated with risk intermediate between the two atypicals. These data indicate that patients with no previously observed glucose elevations develop diabetes-level hyperglycemia during antipsychotic treatment, particularly in patients receiving olanzapine.", 
    "227": "Organophosphates induce bronchoobstruction in guinea pigs, and salbutamol only transiently reverses this effect, suggesting that it triggers additional obstructive mechanisms. To further explore this phenomenon, in vivo (barometric plethysmography) and in vitro (organ baths, including ACh and substance P concentration measurement by HPLC and immunoassay, respectively; intracellular Ca2+) measurement in single myocytes) experiments were performed. In in vivo experiments, parathion caused a progressive bronchoobstruction until a plateau was reached. Administration of salbutamol during this plateau decreased bronchoobstruction up to 22% in the first 5 min, but thereafter airway obstruction rose again as to reach the same intensity as before salbutamol. Aminophylline caused a sustained decrement (71%) of the parathion-induced bronchoobstruction. In in vitro studies, paraoxon produced a sustained contraction of tracheal rings, which was fully blocked by atropine but not by TTX, omega-conotoxin (CTX), or epithelium removal. During the paraoxon-induced contraction, salbutamol caused a temporary relaxation of approximately 50%, followed by a partial recontraction. This paradoxical recontraction was avoided by the M2- or neurokinin-1 (NK1)-receptor antagonists (methoctramine or AF-DX 116, and L-732138, respectively), accompanied by a long-lasting relaxation. Forskolin caused full relaxation of the paraoxon response. Substance P and, to a lesser extent, ACh released from tracheal rings during 60-min incubation with paraoxon or physostigmine, respectively, were significantly increased when salbutamol was administered in the second half of this period. In myocytes, paraoxon did not produce any change in the intracellular Ca2+ basal levels. Our results suggested that: 1) organophosphates caused smooth muscle contraction by accumulation of ACh released through a TTX- and CTX-resistant mechanism; 2) during such contraction, salbutamol relaxation is functionally antagonized by the stimulation of M2 receptors; and 3) after this transient salbutamol-induced relaxation, a paradoxical contraction ensues due to the subsequent release of substance P.",

Hypnotic-based sedation (HBS), where midazolam and/or propofol are used, with morphine or another analgesic added as needed has been common. The advent of remifentanil has allowed greater use of analgesia-based sedation (ABS) where relief of discomfort from the tracheal tube or pain are the important objectives, and hypnosis is given as necessary. Method. We compared HBS and ABS (remifentanil-based sedation) within a general intensive care unit (ICU). During the first study period of 12 weeks, 111 patients received HBS. After the development of new guidelines for the use of remifentanil in the ICU, a second 12 week study period used an analgesia-based regimen, with hypnotics added only if needed.",

    "235": "Microglia constitute the primary resident immune surveillance cell in the brain and are thought to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and HIV-associated dementia. Measuring microglial activation in vivo in patients suffering from these diseases may help chart progression of neuroinflammation as well as assess efficacy of therapies designed to modulate neuroinflammation. Recent studies suggest that activated microglia in the CNS may be detected in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) utilizing pharmacological ligands of the mitochondrial peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR (recently renamed as Translocator protein (18kDa)). Beginning with the molecular characterization of PBR and regulation in activated microglia, we examine the rationale behind using PBR ligands to image microglia with PET. Current evidence suggests these findings might be applied to the development of clinical assessments of microglial activation in neurological disorders."
