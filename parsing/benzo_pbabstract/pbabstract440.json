Little is known, however, about its link with phosphatidylinositol breakdown in the brain. The brains (minus cerebella) from 1-2-day-old neonatal rats were enzymically dissociated into single cells. The intact cells were prelabelled by incubation with myo-[3H]inositol for 3 h, and were then stimulated with agonists in the presence of 10 mM-LiCl. Carbachol at 1 mM induced an increase in InsP3 labelling in brain cells (peak at 30 min, and then a gradual decrease), and a static accumulation of InsP with time, whereas the labelling of InsP2 remained essentially unchanged. A very similar time-response curve was obtained for 10 nM-CCK-8 in stimulating phosphoinositide turnover. The dose-response curve for incubated brain cells revealed that the formation of InsP3 increased when the concentration of CCK-8 was increased from 0.1 to 10 nM. A further increase in CCK-8 concentration to 100-1000 nM resulted in a gradual decrease in InsP3 formation. InsP and InsP2 levels stayed relatively stable. The production of InsP3 stimulated by 10 nM-CCK-8 was dose-dependently suppressed by the CCK-A antagonist Devazepide in the concentration range 1-10 nM; the effect declined when the concentration was further increased to 100-1000 nM. In contrast, the CCK-B antagonist L365,260 showed a sustained suppression of InsP3 production at concentrations above 0.1 nM, i.e. in the range 1-1000 nM. The results provide evidence that CCK-8 stimulates the turnover of phosphoinositide and increases InsP3 labelling in dissociated neonatal-rat brain cells, in which both CCK-A and CCK-B receptors seem to be involved.", 
    "1": "Ro 15-4513 (ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H- imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate), a partial inverse agonist of central benzodiazepine receptors, binds to two distinct sites in the cerebellum. The binding to diazepam-sensitive (DZ-S) sites is displaced by different benzodiazepine receptor ligands, whereas the other site is insensitive to benzodiazepine agonists [diazepam-insensitive (DZ-IS)]. The binding of [3H]Ro 15-4513 was studied in pig cerebellar membranes and in receptors solubilized and purified from these. Micromolar concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) decreased DZ-S binding at both 0 and 37 degrees C, whereas it had no effect on DZ-IS binding at 0 degrees C and was stimulatory at 37 degrees C. The pH profiles of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding were quite similar in both binding sites in the pH range of 5.5-10.5 but differed at acidic pH values from those reported for flunitrazepam and Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil; ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H- imidazol[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) binding in DZ-S sites, suggesting that [3H]Ro 15-4513 does not interact with a histidine residue apparently present in the binding site. Zn2+, Cu2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ enhanced the binding to DZ-S sites, and the first three mentioned also enhanced the binding to DZ-IS sites. [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding activity was solubilized by various detergents. All detergents tested were more efficient in solubilizing DZ-S binding activity. High ionic strength improved especially the solubility of DZ-IS binding activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "The effects of treatment of brain membranes with diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEP), a histidine-modifying reagent, on the binding of 3H-labeled Ro 15-4513 (ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-a]- [1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) and [3H]diazepam were compared. DEP pretreatment produced a dose-dependent decrease in [3H]diazepam binding, whereas low DEP concentrations enhanced the binding of [3H]Ro 15-4513. These effects were reversed by incubation with hydroxylamine after the treatment. The enhancement of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding was due to an increase in the affinity of the binding sites (KD), without any effect on binding capacity (Bmax). The enhancement was perceived in cerebral cortical, cerebellar, and hippocampal membranes. DEP treatment decreased the displacement of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding by diazepam and FG 7142 (N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide) but not by Ro 15-4513 and Ro 19-4603 (tert-butyl-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazol[1,5- a]thieno[2,3-f][1,4]diazepine-3-carboxylate). Although the stimulating effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on [3H]-diazepam binding was not affected by DEP treatment, such treatment reduced the inhibitory effect of GABA on [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding. The enhancement of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding was observed in membranes pretreated with DEP in the presence of flunitrazepam, whereas such pretreatment reduced significantly the inhibitory effect of DEP on [3H]-diazepam binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "The effects of oral clonidine on the duration of isobaric tetracaine spinal anesthesia were studied in 30 patients undergoing urologic procedures. All patients received 15 mg of tetracaine intrathecally in isobaric saline solution. Group 1 (n = 10) received 0.25 mg of oral triazolam; group 2 (n = 10) received 0.15 mg of oral clonidine; and group 3 (n = 10) received 0.25 mg of oral triazolam and 0.75 mg of intrathecal phenylephrine. In group 1, the times for two- and four-segment regression of the level of analgesia to pin-prick were 80 +/- 17 and 123 +/- 22 min, respectively (mean +/- SD). The corresponding values of those measurements were 170 +/- 27 and 273 +/- 48 min in group 2 and 175 +/- 34 and 273 +/- 68 min in group 3. All the regression times in groups 2 and 3 were significantly longer than those in group 1. Regression times were not different between groups 2 and 3. The authors conclude that prolongation of tetracaine sensory analgesia may be produced by premedication with 0.15 mg of oral clonidine. The prolongation is similar to that produced by intrathecal phenylephrine.", 
    "4": "The subtype of muscarinic receptor which mediates cAMP attenuation is not established. Therefore, several selective muscarinic antagonists were used to characterize the subtype of muscarinic receptor coupled to the inhibition of hormone-stimulated cAMP accumulation using NG108-15 neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid cells. These cells were prelabeled with [2-3H]-adenine, washed, and resuspended in a culture medium containing the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.5 mM). The labeled cells were preincubated with the different antagonists 12-15 min. before they were challenged with agonists. The formation of [3H]-cAMP was activated by PGE1 (1 microM) or forskolin (1 microM). In all cases, [3H]-cAMP formed was separated and measured. Carbachol (100 microM) and McN-A343 (10 mM) were used as standard muscarinic agonists. These studies gave the following results: a) McN-A343 (10 mM), an M1 receptor agonist, was only a partial agonist causing 40% inhibition of cAMP accumulation indicating that this effect was not mediated by an M1 receptor; b) The M1-selective antagonist, pirenzepine, exhibited low affinity (pA2 6.2) further suggesting that an M1 receptor was not coupled to the attenuation of cAMP accumulation; c) Two selective M2 antagonists (AF-DX 116 and methoctramine) and M3 antagonist (HHSiD) were used to further characterize these muscarinic receptors. The order of all antagonists based on their affinities (pA2 values) could be arranged in the following order: atropine (9.0) > methoctramine (7.6) > HHSiD (6.9) > AF-DX 116 (6.6) > pirenzepine (6.2). HHSiD exhibits the same degree of affinity to M2 receptors of other tissues as it does to those of NG cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "The purpose of the present experiment was to determine how a rat's prior history (of repeated gentle handling and/or of the elevated plus-maze apparatus) modified the behavioural and neurochemical response to chlordiazepoxide. In handled animals one previous exposure to the plus-maze rendered the rats insensitive to the anxiolytic effects of chlordiazepoxide in this test. This phenomenon of 'one-trial tolerance' was not seen in unhandled rats and thus both prior handling and prior maze experience were necessary to abolish the behavioural response to chlordiazepoxide. The effects of chlordiazepoxide on K(+)-evoked [14C]GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) release were also modified by the rat's past history. The drug-induced reduction of GABA release in the cortex was abolished by prior plus-maze experience; whereas handling modified chlordiazepoxide's effects on GABA release in the hippocampus (the drug decreased release in unhandled rats and increased release in those given repeated gentle handling). Thus an anxiolytic response to chlordiazepoxide in the plus-maze was accompanied by reduced GABA release in both cortex and hippocampus. The 5-HT system (5-hydroxytryptamine) also proved sensitive to the rats' past history. The effects of chlordiazepoxide on K(+)-evoked [3H]5-HT release from the hippocampus depended on both prior handling and plus-maze experience and could be predicted from the undrugged level of evoked release; when this was low, chlordiazepoxide increased it, when it was high, chlordiazepoxide reduced it. These results raise the possibility that the beneficial effects of a benzodiazepine may depend on the baseline condition of the animals.", 
    "6": "The case is described of a neonate who suffered from withdrawal symptoms within 24 hours after birth as a result of the use of clomipramine by the mother during pregnancy. The symptoms consisted of increased irritability, alternating hyper- en hypotonia, hyperreflexia, cyanosis and hypothermia. He was treated with clonazepam with good result. Prescription of clomipramine during pregnancy should be restricted to specific cases and the doses should be kept as low as possible. Because the symptoms are withdrawal symptoms, phenobarbital should not be used as treatment, as it increases drug metabolism by the liver causing an even faster decrease of plasma concentrations of clomipramine. Clonazepam is the drug of choice.", 
    "7": "A reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method is described for the quantitative determination of alprazolam in the plasma of geriatric patients in the presence of 4-hydroxyalprazolam, alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, bromazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, clobazam, desmethylclobazam, diazepam and desmethyldiazepam. The procedure is based on the enrichment of alprazolam on a PRP-1 pre-column, followed by the transfer of the compound in a forflush mode to the analytical column. Alprazolam can be quantified reliably down to a minimum concentration of 1 ng/ml of plasma.", 
    "8": "A series of amide, urea, and carbamate analogues of the muscarinic (M1) ganglionic stimulant [4-[[N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamoyl]oxy]-2-butynyl]trimethylammonium chloride (McN-A-343; 1) was prepared. The C1-methyl-substituted carbamates 8-11 were resolved into the enantiomers. In order to investigate the ganglionic stimulant activity and affinity of the new compounds we studied their ability to increase mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) in the pithed rat and their ability to displace the M1 receptor selective antagonist [3H]pirenzepine from rabbit sympathetic ganglia. The quaternary ammonium derivatives of 1, but not their corresponding tertiary amines, displayed ganglionic stimulant properties. The urea derivative 14 and the acetamide derivative 18 were almost equipotent to 1 as ganglionic agonists. In addition, 14 and 18 showed only 2- to 3-fold less affinity to ganglionic muscarinic receptors than 1. Introduction of a methyl group in the 1 position of the butynyl chain of 1 and its 4-chlorophenyl analogue increased ganglionic stimulant potency. The resulting (+/-)-9 and (+/-)-11 were the most potent analogues in this study. They were found to be partial agonists and showed 5- and 16-fold higher potency than 1, respectively, in increasing the MAP. They also displayed 6- and 18-fold higher affinity than 1 for ganglionic M1 receptors. The (S)-enantiomers of 9 and 11 were 1.5- and 4.9-fold more potent, respectively, than their antipodes as ganglionic muscarinic stimulants. The C1-methyl-substituted urea and acetamide derivatives (15 and 19) were 1.5- and 3-fold less potent than 1 and displayed several-fold lower affinity for ganglionic M1 receptors. The new quaternary analogues retained the selectivity for ganglionic muscarinic receptors since they produced weak partial agonist effects on the guinea pig ileum and showed several-fold lower nicotinic activity than 1 in the frog rectus abdominis assay.", 
    "9": "A clearance pathway common to many aryl alkanoic acids is the generation of renally eliminated ester glucuronides. These metabolites are susceptible to systemic hydrolysis which generates the parent aglycone. We have conducted in vitro studies with biosynthetic R- and S-ketoprofen glucuronides to elucidate the mechanism of this phenomenon. These conjugates were incubated in human plasma, various concentrations of human serum albumin (HSA) and protein-free buffer. It was apparent that albumin, rather than plasma esterases, catalysed the hydrolysis of the glucuronides. The albumin-catalysed hydrolysis of ketoprofen glucuronides was highly stereoselective. The mean (+/- SD) hydrolysis half-life of R-ketoprofen glucuronide in plasma (N = 4) at physiological pH and temperature was 1.37 (+/- 0.30) hr. The corresponding value for S-ketoprofen glucuronide, 3.46 (+/- 0.84) hr, was significantly different (P less than 0.005). In contrast, synthetic ethyl esters of R- and S-ketoprofen were hydrolysed by plasma esterases, but not by HSA, and with little stereoselectivity. The reversible protein binding of ketoprofen glucuronides was determined at physiological pH and temperature by a rapid ultra-filtration method. The binding of R- and S-ketoprofen glucuronide to human plasma protein was independent of concentration (P greater than 0.05) over the range of 1-20 micrograms/mL. The mean (+/- SD) percentage unbound in plasma (N = 4) of R-ketoprofen glucuronide was 12.6 (+/- 1.4)%. The corresponding value for S-ketoprofen glucuronide, 9.12 (+/- 0.54)%, was significantly different (P less than 0.005). S-Ketoprofen glucuronide was also more avidly protein bound in physiological concentrations of HSA. However, this stereoselectivity decreased in more dilute HSA solutions. Based on the hydrolysis and protein binding data for ketoprofen glucuronides, we propose the existence of separate binding and catalytic sites on the albumin molecule for these metabolites.",

    "11": "A prevalence study in an Auckland general practice was undertaken to describe the benzodiazepines prescribed, patterns of use and compliance. An associated case control study compared benzodiazepine users and nonusers.", 
    "12": "The age standardised prevalence rate of benzodiazepine use in this Auckland general practice was 3.4% for patients over 20 years of age. The benzodiazepine users described were predominantly elderly (70% over 60 years of age) and female (62.5%). They had significantly more medical and psychiatric complaints than matched controls. Triazolam and diazepam accounted for 60.9% of the benzodiazepines prescribed. Over one-third of the patients using benzodiazepines were concurrently prescribed other psychotropic medications, primarily tricyclic antidepressants.", 
    "13": "This rate suggests an overall decline in benzodiazepine use since previous studies. Benzodiazepines continue to be prescribed predominantly in the elderly, a group at considerable risk from side effects. Doctors should continue to inform their patients about the side effects of benzodiazepines, the risks of dependence and difficulties of withdrawal.", 
    "14": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites (PBRs) are ubiquitous in mammalian tissues. However, the physiological role of PBRs has not yet been clarified. In this study we characterized a saturable and high affinity binding site for [3H]Pk 11195 (isoquinoline carboxamide derivative) on human lymphocytes and different lymphoma cell lines. Binding parameters of the human T-lymphoma cell line CCRF-CEM came closest to values for lymphocyte binding. Thus, the CCRF-CEM cell line appears to be a suitable lymphocyte cell model for further study of PBRs. To evaluate the pharmacological specificity of binding to human lymphocytes and CCRF-CEM cells we investigated the potency of different ligands to displace [3H]Pk 11195 from its binding site. Pk 11195 was found to be the most potent inhibitor followed by 4'-chlorodiazepan (Ro5-4864) and diazepam (range of inhibition constants from 6.7 x 10(-9) M to 3.6 x 10(-7) M), whereas ligands specific for the central-type receptor like clonazepam and flumazenil had no displacing potency in the tested concentration range (10(-10)-10(-4) M). Since it was assumed that PBRs might be involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, we studied the influence of PBR ligands on cell growth and survival using a quantitative colorimetric assay (MTT). Ligands which bind selectively to PBRs inhibited cell multiplication in vitro. However, half-effective concentrations (EC50) were in the micromolar range and above therapeutic in vivo concentrations (range of EC50 values from 2.4 x 10(-5) M to 1.5 x 10(-4) M). Clonazepam and flumazenil had no inhibiting potency in the tested concentration range (10(-10)-10(-4) M). Although the difference between values for displacing potency and ability to inhibit cell multiplication cannot be explained as yet, it is interesting that all PBR-ligands followed the same sequence in displacing [3H]Pk 11195 and inhibiting cell multiplication and that central type ligands were ineffective in both assays. This association suggest a mediating role of PBR binding in cell growth.", 
    "15": "The mouse black and white test box was used to measure changes in behaviour in an aversive situation where the administration of R(+)-zacopride (but not S(-)-zacopride) alone decreased aversive responding to the white area. A similar anxiolytic profile of action was observed using parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA), whose effects were antagonised by a co-treatment with R(+)-zacopride and reversed by S(-)-zacopride to an exacerbation of the aversive response. An anxiolytic profile of action was also observed using ondansetron, granisetron, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, ritanserin, 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin), E4424 (2-[4-[4-(4-chloro-l-pyrazoyl)butyl]-l-piperazinyl]-pyrimidine), umepsirone, DuP753 (2-n-butyl-4-chloro-5-hydroxy-methyl-1-[2(1H-tetrazol-5-yl) biphenyl-4-yl)methyl)]-imidazole), SQ29,852 ((S)-1-[6-amino-2[hydroxy)(4-phenyl-butyl)phosphinyl]-oxy)-1- nexy]-2-proline), devazepide and guanfacine, and this was retained following co-treatment with PCPA. The anxiolytic profile of action of PCPA was also retained following co-treatment with renzapride which when administered alone failed to modify behaviour. However, the ability of chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, ondansetron and E4424 (but not devazepide, DuP753 or SQ29,852) to reduce aversive responding was inhibited by co-treatment with R(+) and/or S(-)-zacopride. It is concluded that the reduction in aversive responding caused by pharmacological manipulation at the benzodiazepine, 5-HT receptor subtypes 5-HT1A, 5-HT1C/5-HT2 and 5-HT3 (but not at the cholecystokin CCKA or angiotensin receptors or inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme) can be inhibited by R(+) and S(-)-zacopride. The data is discussed in terms of zacopride having an agonist or partial agonist effect at the 5-HT3 receptor.", 
    "16": "5-(2'-[18F]Fluoroethyl)flumazenil ([18F]FEF), a fluorine-18-labeled analogue of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil, was evaluated for use with positron emission tomography (PET). PET imaging of a baboon after i.v. injection of [18F]FEF showed that the radiofluorinated ligand rapidly localized in vivo within benzodiazepine receptor-rich cerebral tissues, and that selective disposition was retained for over 2 h. Coinjection of unlabeled flumazenil (0.55 mg/kg i.v.) abolished the heterogeneous cerebral distribution of the tracer; receptor-specific uptake was reduced by approximately 95%. The fluorinated benzodiazepine antagonist was degraded in vivo only to polar radiometabolites that do not cross the blood-brain barrier. [18F]FEF has advantages over existing PET radiopharmaceuticals, and is a promising radioligand for non-invasive evaluation of central benzodiazepine receptor binding in vivo.", 
    "17": "The role of the vagal and spinal afferent innervation in the inhibition of gastric emptying induced by duodenal perfusion with a disaccharide (maltose 300 mM) was investigated in awake rats fitted with gastric and duodenal cannulas. Perfusion of the duodenum with maltose inhibited gastric emptying by 44%. Maltose-induced inhibition of gastric emptying was reversed by 46% and 100% by functional ablation of the vagal or spinal capsaicin-sensitive afferent innervation, respectively. Pretreatment with the specific CCK 'A' receptor antagonist, MK329, completely abolished the effects of maltose on gastric emptying. These results suggest that disaccharides inhibit gastric emptying via activation of capsaicin-sensitive afferents in the duodenal mucosa via a mechanism involving an action of CCK at type 'A' receptors, possibly located on afferent fibers.",

At base line we determined the type and quantity of drugs received by all residents (n = 823), and a blinded observer performed standardized clinical assessments of the residents who were taking psychoactive medications. After the five-month program, drug use and patient status were reassessed.", 
    "20": "Scores on an index of psychoactive-drug use, measuring both the magnitude and the probable inappropriateness of medication use, declined significantly more in the nursing homes in which the program was carried out (experimental nursing homes) than in the control nursing homes (decrease, 27 percent vs. 8 percent; P = 0.02). The use of antipsychotic drugs was discontinued in more residents in the experimental nursing homes than in the control nursing homes (32 percent vs. 14 percent); the comparable figures for the discontinuation of long-acting benzodiazepines were 20 percent vs. 9 percent, and for antihistamine hypnotics, 45 percent vs. 21 percent. In the experimental nursing homes residents who were initially taking antipsychotic drugs showed less deterioration on several measures of cognitive function than similar residents in the control facilities, but they were more likely to report depression. Those who were initially taking benzodiazepines or antihistamine hypnotic agents reported less anxiety than controls but had more loss of memory. Most other measures of clinical status remained unchanged in both groups.",

    "22": "The effects of some GABAergic agents on seizures induced by quinine were studied in mice. Muscimol, AOAA, DABA and baclofen significantly protected mice against quinine-induced convulsions. Bicuculline effectively enhanced quinine-induced convulsions, and significantly attenuated the protective effects of muscimol, AOAA and DABA against convulsions induced by quinine. Diazepam and phenobarbitone significantly protected mice against convulsions induced by quinine. However, phenytoin did not affect quinine-induced seizures to any significant degree. These results indicate that the convulsant effect of quinine may be due to a disturbance in the status of the GABAergic system.", 
    "23": "The differential sensitivity of type A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors to benzodiazepine ligands seen in the mammalian nervous system is thought to be generated by the existence of a number of different receptor subtypes, assembled from a range of closely related subunits (alpha 1-6, beta 1-3, gamma 1-3, and delta) encoded by discrete genes. The characteristics of a given subtype can be determined by the coexpression of cloned cDNAs encoding the subunits of interest. Two transient expression systems have so far been employed in the study of the ligand-binding characteristics and chloride channel properties of such GABAA receptors--Xenopus oocytes and transfected mammalian cells. Here we report on the use of a steroid-inducible promoter expression system for the production of a permanently transfected clonal cell line expressing the alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2L GABAA receptor subtype. Using both immunoprecipitation by subunit-specific antisera and gel-exclusion chromatography, we have shown that the alpha 1, beta 1, and gamma 2L subunits coassemble to form receptor macromolecules that are of the same size as native GABAA receptors. Additionally, the recombinant receptors have the same benzodiazepine pharmacology as native alpha 1-containing GABAA receptors and function as GABA-gated chloride channels. Such cell lines expressing individual GABAA receptor subtypes will prove important tools in the study of the structure, function, and pharmacology of GABAA receptors and in the development of subtype-specific drugs.", 
    "24": "A combination of 0.5 mg/kg of methotrimeprazine, 0.1 mg/kg of midazolam and 100 mg/kg of a 10 per cent guaiphenesin solution was investigated for the induction of recumbency in 15 horses; the addition of 1.6 mg/kg of ketamine was also evaluated in 15 horses and anaesthesia was maintained with halothane in oxygen. The horses became recumbent quickly and smoothly and they recovered quietly, with little ataxia. Tachycardia occurred after induction, but no other changes from pre-operative values were observed until halothane in oxygen had been given, when hypothermia, hypotension, bradypnoea, hyperoxaemia, respiratory acidosis and decreased respiratory minute volume developed. Horses given ketamine in addition to methotrimeprazine, midazolam and guaiphenesin were easier to intubate and recovered more quickly than horses receiving only methotrimeprazine, midazolam and guaiphenesin.", 
    "25": "The pathophysiology of startle disease (hyperekplexia) is unknown. Hyperactivity of the brainstem reticular formation has been suggested as a cause. We report a newborn infant with classic features of startle disease in whom cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were substantially lower than normal during the first weeks of life. She improved greatly on clonazepam treatment. We suggest that the signs of this disorder may be due to a genetic defect or to delayed maturation resulting in low CSF GABA.", 
    "26": "Using quantitative receptor radioautography, binding sites for the 'peripheral-type' benzodiazepine receptor ligand [3H]PK 11195 were studied in rats 4 week after end-to-side portacaval anastomosis and in sham-operated controls. Portacaval anastomosis resulted in region-selective increases in density of [3H]PK 11195 binding sites in cerebellum, pons greater than thalamus, cerebral cortex greater than hippocampus greater than striatum. Possible mechanisms implicated in these changes include (i) the action of endogenous ligands for the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor such as octadecaneuropeptide and (ii) neurotoxic actions of ammonia. In view of the proposed role of these receptors as modulators of intermediary metabolism and neurosteroid biosynthesis, such changes could contribute to the neurochemical mechanisms responsible for portal-systemic encephalopathy.", 
    "27": "The novel radioligand [3H]AF-DX 384 binds specifically and saturably to putative muscarinic M2 receptor sites in homogenates of rat cerebral cortex. In saturation studies, [3H]AF-DX 384 appears to bind to two subpopulations of sites/states, one of high affinity (Kd1 = 0.28 +/- 0.08 nM) and another of low affinity (Kd2 = 28.0 +/- 5.0 nM). The maximal binding capacity (Bmax) of [3H]AF-DX 384 binding sites represented 9.7 +/- 2.3 fmol/mg protein (Bmax1) and 1993 +/- 551 fmol/mg protein (Bmax2) for the high and low affinity sites/states, respectively. The ligand selectivity profile of [3H]AF-DX 384 (at 2 nM) revealed that (-)-quinuclidinyl benzylate = atropine greater than 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide greater than AQ-RA 741 greater than AF-DX 384 greater than UH-AH 371 much greater than methoctramine greater than oxotremorine-M greater than hexahydro-sila-defenidol much greater than pirenzepine greater than carbamylcholine much much greater than nicotine. This suggests that under our assay conditions [3H]AF-DX 384 binds mostly to M2-like muscarinic receptors in the rat central nervous system. This is further supported by the clear M2-like pattern of distribution observed using quantitative receptor autoradiography. High densities of specific labelling were seen in areas such as the hypoglossal nucleus, the pontine nucleus, the superior colliculus, the motor trigeminal nucleus, various thalamic nuclei and certain cortical laminae. Compared to [3H]AF-DX 116, the percentage of specific binding detected with [3H]AF-DX 384 was much higher. This is likely to be related to the greater chemical stability and affinity of [3H]AF-EX 384. In addition, autoradiograms obtained with [3H]AF-DX 384 (2 nM) are of better quality with film exposure periods five shorter than those needed for [3H]AF-DX 116 (10 nM). Therefore, [3H]AF-DX 384 displays a good selectivity for muscarinic M2 sites and offers major advantages, including higher affinity and greater stability, over previously used ligands.", 
    "28": "Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) treatment of synaptosomal membranes, which causes the release of fatty acids, particularly unsaturated fatty acids, inhibits the flux of chloride ions through the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) benzodiazepine receptor ion channel in response to activation by agonists. PLA2 treatment has also been shown to affect ligand binding to the receptor. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of unsaturated free fatty acids, arachidonic acid and oleic acid and saturated free fatty acids, arachidic acid and stearic acid on various characteristics of GABAA receptor ligand binding. Only the unsaturated fatty acids showed any effect: arachidonic acid and oleic acid enhanced flunitrazepam binding and muscimol binding but inhibited tert-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding in a dose-dependent manner. The effects on muscimol and TBPS binding were shown to be due to changes in receptor density by saturation analysis. Oleic acid and arachidonic acid also decreased the enhancement of flunitrazepam and muscimol binding by cartazolate and pentobarbital but did not affect GABA enhancement of flunitrazepam binding. These data indicate that unsaturated free fatty acids can mimic the effects of PLA2 treatment and underline the importance of the lipid microenvironment on ligand binding to the GABAA receptor.",

Prescriptions for the psychoactive drugs accounted for 13.2% of all prescriptions dispensed. In terms of DDDs, the estimated prescribing rates for the total Tasmanian population for the benzodiazepines, antidepressants and antipsychotics were 47.8, 12.5 and 2.1 DDDs per 1000 persons per day, respectively. The rate of benzodiazepine prescribing appeared to be high in comparison with the limited Australian data available.

    "34": "An exploratory, descriptive, retrospective study was carried out concerning the use of means for euthanasia or assisted suicide, primarily regarding the period 1986-1989. Data were collected via an anonymous written inquiry among a random sample of family physicians in North Holland (n = 521) and family physicians in the rest of the Netherlands (n = 521). The inquiry contained among others questions about the last case they had encountered. In addition, police reports of euthanasia or assisted suicide administered by family physicians in North Holland (n = 263) were analysed. The response to the inquiry was 67%; (non-respondents did not differ from respondents): 388 cases could be analysed. The use of euthanatics by family physicians in North Holland and those in the rest of the Netherlands was identical. More than 40 different euthanatics were used, most of them incidentally. The most frequently used (combination of) means were a benzodiazepine with a neuromuscular relaxant (23%), a barbiturate with a neuromuscular relaxant (20%), barbiturates (15%) and opioids (12%). Most euthanatics were given intravenously (61%, of which 5% by infusion), orally 21%, intramuscularly 12%, rectally 3% and subcutaneously 2%. The quantities applied varied greatly. The average length of time from the start of the procedure till decrease was 3.8 hours (less than or equal to 1 minute-72 hours). In 12% of the cases complications or unintended effects were reported. Comparison of inquiry and police reports showed some differences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "35": "Conditional \"if-then\" relations between drug (interoceptive) stimuli and visual (exteroceptive) stimuli were taught to 4 normal humans. Interoceptive stimuli were the effects produced by 0.32 mg/70 kg triazolam (a prototypical benzodiazepine) and placebo (lactose-filled capsules); exteroceptive stimuli were black symbols on white flash cards. Following the training of the prerequisite conditional relations, tests of emergent relations were conducted between exteroceptive stimuli and between interoceptive and exteroceptive stimuli. Equivalence relations emerged immediately without explicit training for all 4 subjects. Accuracy of responding during the interoceptive-exteroceptive equivalence tests and subjects' self-reports showed consistent discrimination between the drug effects of triazolam and placebo. Finally, a generalization test assessed whether a novel visual stimulus presented in the context of the placebo (i.e., no drug) would generalize to visual stimuli belonging to the placebo stimulus class. All 3 subjects who completed this test reliably chose the visual stimuli belonging to the placebo class and not the visual stimuli belonging to the triazolam stimulus class. The development of equivalence relations between interoceptive and exteroceptive stimuli demonstrates that private and public stimulus events can emerge as members of the same equivalence class. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.", 
    "36": "Elderly patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) have an increased risk of sedation related complications during the procedure. To determine whether nasal oxygen supplementation (2 l/min) reduces these risks, half of 66 patients aged over 60 undergoing ERCP using minimal midazolam sedation alone were randomised to receive nasal oxygen. The arterial oxygen saturation and pulse rate of all patients were monitored by pulse oximetry before and during the procedure. Only three patients in the oxygen supplemented group (n = 33) required any form of intervention for hypoxia compared with six in the control group (n = 33). Comparison of mean arterial oxygen saturation between the groups showed significantly higher levels in the nasal oxygen group throughout the procedure. Pulse rate comparisons showed no significant difference from control group values, both groups had short periods of significant tachycardia. We conclude that minimal sedation with midazolam alone still produces hypoxia during ERCP in a substantial number of elderly patients. Nasal oxygen supplementation increases the level of patient oxygenation and reduces the need for intervention, but does not reduce tachycardia in the elderly patient. Because hyoscine may be a significant factor contributing to the tachycardia, sparing rather than routine use of this agent is advisable.", 
    "37": "In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the safety, efficacy and feasibility of oral midazolam premedication in children were evaluated in an ambulatory surgery unit. Eighty unmedicated children (ASA PS I or II, ages 1-6 yr) were randomly assigned to one of four groups receiving midazolam 0.5, 0.75, or 1.0 mg.kg-1 or a placebo 30 min before separation from parents. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, sedation and anxiolysis scores were recorded before premedication, every five minutes for 30 min and then during induction of anaesthesia and recovery. We found that heart rate, systolic blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation and respiratory rate were unchanged during the study. Sedation and anxiolysis scores in the midazolam-treated groups were greater than those in the placebo group and that anxiolysis at the time of separation from the parents was judged excellent in 80-90% of the children who received midazolam. However, sedation and anxiolysis did not differ among the three midazolam groups. Mean times to discharge from hospital were similar for all four groups. The side effects, loss of balance and head control, blurred vision and dysphoric reactions were observed only in the 0.75 and 1.0 mg.kg-1 midazolam groups. We conclude that oral midazolam 0.5 mg.kg-1 is a safe and effective premedication and that 0.75 and 1 mg.kg-1 while offering no additional benefit, may cause more side effects.", 
    "38": "A method for the extraction and quantification by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of non-labelled benzodiazepines partitioned into biological membranes has been developed. The benzodiazepine (BZD) was partitioned in a synaptosomal membrane-buffer system. The membranous pellet was separated by centrifugation and from this pellet, previously submitted or not to a proteolytic treatment and resuspended in the same buffer, the BZD was extracted by the addition of the proper volume of ethyl acetate, i.e. that capable of extracting at least 99.5% of the total drug in the aqueous phase. Optimal conditions for maximum proteolysis were: incubation of membranes at a final concentration of 1 mg protein/mL in the presence of 0.08 mg of Protease type I per mL for 90 min. at 45 degrees C. Although the efficiency of the proteolysis was demonstrated not only by kinetic but also by electrophoretic evidence, recovery of BZD in the organic solvent was not increased by the enzymatic treatment at a mass BZD/protein ratio in the range 4-4.6 10(-5) micrograms BZD/mg protein. For the HPLC quantification a reversed phase ODS column was used with methanol:water (1:1) plus 3.5% acetic acid as the mobile phase at a constant pressure and 1 mL/min flow rate. The UV detector was calibrated at 265 nm. Calibration curves were constructed by plotting peak height or peak area vs. nmoles BZD and adjusted to straight lines by a regression analysis by the least squares method. The peak height was selected as the detection method. Intra- and inter-assay precision did not exceed 10% and the total recovery was 100%.",

Patients with disorders of entrainment to external time cues such as delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS) and non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome (HNS) were treated with non-pharmacological interventions and/or pharmacological agents. 2. Resetting the circadian clock with chronotherapy was easy in all DSPS patients, but it was not as easy to maintain the reset rhythm without additional therapy. Triazolam was effective in treating the phase delay that reappeared after chronotherapy. 3. Vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) was strikingly effective in some patients with DSPS or HNS. 4. All the adolescent patients who complained of inability to attend school finally returned to their classes after treatment. Maintaining the reset rhythm in adolescent patients was easier than in adults.", 
    "40": "1. The neuroleptic malignant syndrome was initially described as a disorder specifically related to neuroleptic usage with frequent fatal outcome. The observations of variant or mild cases of this syndrome as well as case reports on neuroleptic-malignant-like syndromes in the absence of neuroleptics raises the issue of the usefulness of this terminology and highlights the potential for inappropriate management of this \"malignant\" syndrome. It has been suggested that hypothalamic thermoregulatory responses may involve an interplay among noradrenergic, cholinergic and serotonergic pathways. Out treatment strategy is based on the pharmacology of neuroleptics and empirical data, verified in our own clinical practice and considers that it is often difficult to determine whether certain physiologic states are a consequence to or specific triggering factors. 2. If a patient's temperature is less than 101, we emphasize vigorous treatment with anticholinergic agents, while simultaneously assessing the psychiatric need for neuroleptics versus medical risks. Given that the severe rigidity of NMS represents severe extrapyramidal effects of dopamine blockade, there is no reason to withhold anticholinergics in the absence of higher temperatures. Neuroleptics can be stopped at the discretion of the clinician even during circumstances when there is fever below 101. 3. In cases of severe EPS with fever greater than or equal to 101, we recommend stopping neuroleptics, treating with anticholinergics and starting with dopamine agonists. In the event of a poor response to dopamine agonists, a brief trial of dantrolene and/or benzodiazepines is recommended. Dantrolene should not be introduced for prolonged periods, since abnormal liver function studies have been observed in approximately 1.8% of patients. 4. In cases of extreme hyperpyrexia (fever greater than 103), clinicians should consider transfer to an ICU or another medical support. Extreme temperatures have been associated with potentially irreversible cerebellar or other brain damage, if not aggressively treated. If neuroleptics are later indicated, a 2 week interval after resolution of symptoms should be maintained before reinstituting neuroleptics. 5. In patients with severe EPS without fever, we emphasize aggressive use of anticholinergic therapy, while simultaneously considering the psychiatric need for neuroleptics versus medical risks. In all cases where a patient's swallowing, respirations or physical mobility is severely compromised, we suggest stopping neuroleptics. Anticholinergic agents should be continued for 7 days after neuroleptics are stopped. If anticholinergic agents are unsuccessful after 2-3 dosages, dopamine agonists may be added, while simultaneously monitoring vital signs. It should be emphasized that severe EPS sometimes takes days to improve even after neuroleptic cessation and the addition of anticholinergics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "41": "Insomnia, a common complaint among the elderly, is generally treated with benzodiazepines. Long-acting benzodiazepines (e.g., flurazepam) often produce daytime somnolence and performance deficits, whereas short-acting drugs (e.g., triazolam) have been associated with marked rebound insomnia and anterograde memory loss. The authors designed a pilot study to evaluate the efficacy of an intermediate-acting benzodiazepine, estazolam (e.g., ProSom), as well as its side effects. The parameters studied were sleep, daytime performance, and memory. Ten geriatric patients (greater than 60 years of age) with insomnia participated in the study. They received placebo nightly for 2 weeks (baseline), estazolam 1 mg nightly for the next 4 weeks (treatment phase), and placebo again for 2 weeks (withdrawal period). Sleep was monitored by polysomnography the first two nights of each week in a sleep laboratory. Estazolam significantly decreased sleep latency, nocturnal awakenings, and wake time after sleep onset. Total sleep time increased an average of 63 minutes the first night of treatment. Significant improvements in wake time after sleep onset and total sleep time also were observed in the fourth week of estazolam treatment. Rebound insomnia occurred on the first withdrawal night only for wake time and total sleep time. By the next night, these sleep parameters returned to baseline. Neither day-time performance nor anterograde memory was adversely affected by estazolam treatment or its withdrawal. A 1-mg dose of estazolam appears to be a safe and effective hypnotic for elderly patients with insomnia.", 
    "42": "The control of cell proliferation by gastrin has been investigated in a rat pancreatic tumour cell line, AR4-2J. Exogenous gastrin, 10(-12) to 10(-8) M, stimulated cell growth of thymidine-synchronised AR4-2J cells cultured over 48 h in serum-free medium. Cell lysates of AR4-2J cells contained an average of 4.5 and 3.5 pg gastrin per 10(6) cells, when grown in serum-supplemented or serum-free media, respectively, as revealed by radioimmunoassay. In serum-free medium, AR4-2J secrete 34 ng 1(-1) 10(-6) cells of gastrin over 48 h. Addition of an anti-gastrin immunoglobulin preparation, but not control immunoglobulins, caused a maximum 52% reduction in cell growth. These data are consistent with an autocrine role for gastrin in the control of AR4-2J cell growth. These results were supported by studies with gastrin/CCK receptor antagonists. Six non-peptide gastrin/CCK receptor antagonists inhibited AR4-2J cell growth in a concentration-related manner. The concentration required for 50% inhibition (IC50) of cell growth by the amino acid-derived antagonists proglumide (3.5 x 10(-3) M), benzotript (1.8 x 10(-3) M), loxiglumide (1.1 x 10(-4) M) and lorglumide (6.7 x 10(-5) M) were of the same order and significantly correlated with their IC50 for inhibition of 125I-gastrin binding to AR4-2J cells. Inhibition of cell growth by these antagonists was partially reversed by the addition of exogenous gastrin. In contrast, the IC50 for inhibition of cell growth with two benzodiazepine-derived antagonists, the CCK-B receptor antagonist L-365,260 (4.6 x 10(-5) M) and the CCK-A receptor antagonist devazepide (1.7 x 10(-5) M) were two-three orders of magnitude greater than those required to inhibit gastrin binding (10(-8)-10(-7) M). The growth inhibitory effects of L-365,260 and devazepide were not reversed by exogenous gastrin suggesting these benzodiazepine-derived antagonists do not inhibit cell growth by interaction with gastrin receptors. The results are consistent with gastrin being an autocrine growth factor in AR4-2J cells, and that stimulation of cell growth is due to stimulation of the gastrin, rather than CCK-B, receptor sub-type. This study highlights that gastrin receptor antagonists warrant further investigation as agents to control growth of tumours, such as those from the gastrointestinal tract, which express gastrin receptors.", 
    "43": "We have compared the EEG and auditory evoked wave P300 with psychometric tests in assessing vigilance after flumazenil antagonism of midazolam sedation in 12 healthy volunteers. Measurements were made before and after midazolam 0.1 and 0.2 mg kg-1 i.v., and immediately and 30, 60, 120 and 240 min after administration of flumazenil 1 mg. The sedative effects of midazolam and antagonism by flumazenil resulted in alterations in EEG, P300 and psychometric tests (syndrome short test, letter cancellation, choice reaction and recognition). However, 60 and 120 min after flumazenil a decrease in test performance indicating rebound sedation was seen only in P300 mapping. Thus P300 mapping was a sensitive method of detecting subtle differences in vigilance. Rebound sedation occurred even when midazolam 0.2 mg kg-1 was antagonized with an adequate dose of flumazenil. We suggest that it is advisable to supervise patients for at least 240 min after flumazenil antagonism of midazolam 0.2 mg kg-1.", 
    "44": "Anaesthetic agents inhibit some aspects of immune function and this may be clinically important when prolonged infusions are used in an intensive care unit. We have studied the effects of propofol, thiopentone and midazolam on neutrophil polarization in vitro. At concentrations seen in plasma during anaesthesia, propofol and thiopentone produced significant (approximately 50%) and comparable degrees of inhibition. Inhibition was complete with greater concentrations of these drugs. When compared with equivalent concentrations of midazolam, propofol produced more inhibition (P less than 0.01) at all concentrations investigated, except the smallest. Midazolam produced no effect at clinically relevant concentrations. The effect of propofol was not attributable to its lipid carrier vehicle, as 10% Intralipid alone augmented neutrophil polarization. Human serum albumin conferred some degree of protection against the inhibition produced by clinically relevant concentrations of propofol and thiopentone, but not that produced by greater concentrations of these drugs.", 
    "45": "The mechanisms by which benzodiazepines produce muscle relaxation and respiratory depression are not known, but they may include actions on peripheral benzodiazepine receptors or central GABA receptors, or a direct action on airway smooth muscle may also be involved. We have compared, therefore, the effects of diazepam, flunitrazepam and midazolam on airway tone by measuring isometric tension of guineapig trachealis muscle. Cumulative concentrations of diazepam, flunitrazepam and midazolam caused concentration-dependent relaxation of resting tone in the tracheal smooth muscle with no significant differences in pD2 values (-log EC50--an index of potency) or intrinsic activities (% of maximum response) for relaxations for the three compounds. Pretreatment with propranolol 10(-6) mol litre-1, flumazenil 10(-7) and 10(-6) mol litre-1 or PK11195 10(-6) mol litre-1 had no effect on diazepam- or midazolam-induced relaxation. Diazepam 3 x 10(-6) mol litre-1 pretreatment shifted the concentration-response curves for acetylcholine, histamine and serotonin (5-HT) to the right by a factor of approximately 2. Flunitrazepam 3 x 10(-6) mol litre-1 pretreatment also shifted the curves for histamine and 5-HT similarly to the right, whereas midazolam pretreatment did not inhibit any agonist-induced contractions. These results suggest that benzodiazepines relax airway smooth muscle, not via neural pathways or central and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, but by a direct action on airway smooth muscle.", 
    "46": "We have studied the effects of flumazenil on sleep time and EEG in rats anaesthetized with 1.5% halothane, propofol 20 mg kg-1, thiamylal 30 mg kg-1, or combinations of diazepam 5 mg kg-1 and anaesthetic agents. We also studied the effects of flumazenil 0.3, 3 and 30 mg kg-1 on behaviour and EEG. Flumazenil 0.3 and 3 mg kg-1 alone had no effect on behaviour or EEG, but flumazenil 30 mg kg-1 had depressive effects similar to those of diazepam on behaviour and EEG. Flumazenil 0.3, 3 and 30 mg kg-1 i.v., antagonized the effects of diazepam 10 mg kg-1 i.v. on behaviour and EEG. Flumazenil had no antagonistic effect on sleep time induced by anaesthetic agents, but flumazenil 30 mg kg-1 potentiated propofol-induced anaesthesia. Flumazenil did not affect anaesthesia-induced EEG changes. Diazepam 5 mg kg-1 potentiated anaesthesia. Flumazenil antagonism of diazepam potentiation varied with anaesthetic agent: flumazenil 0.3 mg kg-1 antagonized diazepam action in halothane anaesthesia, but 30 mg kg-1 was required in propofol anaesthesia; this large dose was insufficient in thiamylal anaesthesia.", 
    "47": "The therapeutic efficacy of the oxime HI-6 against intoxication with the irreversible cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitor soman was tested in marmoset monkeys. Five out of six marmosets, intoxicated with 5 x LD50 soman and treated immediately with diazepam (0.2 mg.kg-1 iv) and 15 sec later with atropine (0.5 mg.kg-1 im) and HI-6 (50 mg.kg-1 im), survived for more than 24 hr. One of these animals died after 4 days. In the HI-6-treated marmosets blood ChE activity was inhibited at a rate slower than that in three animals treated similarly but with saline instead of HI-6. The latter marmosets died within 8 min after soman. HI-6 achieved its plasma peak 5 min after injection and was eliminated with a t1/2 of about 40 min. In a second experiment similarly treated marmosets were euthanized at 5 min (three saline-treated animals) or at 10 min (three HI-6-treated animals) after the soman intoxication to enable the determination of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities in diaphragm and brain tissue. In addition, in these animals blood AChE and butyrylcholine esterase (BuChE) activities were determined. Low AChE activities were encountered in diaphragms and brains. These levels were not significantly different between saline- and HI-6-treated marmosets. In vitro treatment with HI-6 at 40 min after soman still led to an increase of the AChE activity, which was significant in diaphragm, suggesting that postmortem AChE inhibition had occurred. The ratio of AChE to BuChE in blood was significantly enhanced in HI-6-treated animals, indicating that HI-6 preferentially reactivated AChE. It is concluded that (i) HI-6 is an effective treatment against soman poisoning in marmosets and (ii) AChE reactivation or protection by HI-6 contributed to the survival of the animals.",

We describe two patients with SMS and review the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment.", 
    "49": "Sixty patients premedicated with temazepam were allocated randomly to receive an infusion of propofol designed to achieve and maintain a target blood concentration of 3, 4 or 5 micrograms.ml-1. Induction time was measured from the start of infusion to loss of verbal contact. The success rate of inducing anaesthesia within 3 min of achieving the target concentration was 40% when the predicted target concentration was 3 micrograms.ml-1, 75% when the predicted target was 4 micrograms.ml-1 and 90% when the target was 5 micrograms.ml-1. There were no significant differences between the three groups for time to loss of verbal contact in patients who were induced successfully within 3 min. There were significant reductions in arterial pressure 3 min after achieving the target concentrations within the groups but not between them. The frequency of apnoea and pain on injection was small in all groups. Selecting a target concentration of 5 microgram.ml-1 would successfully induce anaesthesia in the majority of patients premedicated with temazepam without major haemodynamic or respiratory side effects.", 
    "50": "Insomnia is commonly encountered in general medical practice, but little is known about how primary care physicians manage this problem. We reviewed medical records describing 536 patient encounters in which either triazolam (Halcion) or flurazepam (Dalmane) was prescribed for outpatient use. Only 12% of the progress notes written by internists or surgeons contained even a remote reference to sleep, whereas 74% of psychiatrist's notes contained at least some sleep symptom documentation. In a multivariate analysis including the number of medical and psychiatric diagnoses, patient age, and physician gender, only the prescriber department was independently associated with the presence of symptom documentation. We also found that 30% of the prescriptions written by internists or surgeons were for inappropriately large quantities of these drugs (180 or more doses) compared with 6% of the prescriptions written by psychiatrists. We conclude that the evaluation of insomnia by nonpsychiatrists is often incomplete and that hypnotic drugs may be inappropriately prescribed by these physicians. Further efforts are needed to improve the management of insomnia by primary care physicians in the outpatient setting.", 
    "51": "The effects of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a benzodiazepine inverse agonist (methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate; DMCM) and electric foot-shock on rat conflict behavior were characterized and compared. Rats were trained to lever press under a multiple fixed-ratio schedule (FR 20) of food reinforcement in which responses during the first component were not punished, and the first response of each FR during the second component produced electric shock of an intensity sufficient to suppress responding by 10% to 15%. Intracerebroventricular injection of CRF (0.1-5.6 micrograms) caused a dose-dependent decrease in the rate of responding in both components of the schedule. However, CRF was more potent in decreasing rates of punished responding (proconflict effect). DMCM (10-100 micrograms; i.c.v.) also decreased rates of punished and nonpunished responding and was more potent during the punishment component. The suppression of punished and nonpunished responding by CRF and DMCM was mimicked by increasing the shock intensity (delta = 0.1 to 0.6 mA) during the punishment component. To determine whether CRF, DMCM and electric shock shared common mechanisms for these effects, rats were pretreated with i.c.v. injections of either a CRF antagonist (alpha helical CRF9-41, 50 micrograms), a benzodiazepine agonist (chlordiazepoxide, 10 micrograms) or a benzodiazepine antagonist (flumazenil, 10 micrograms) before the administration of equieffective doses of CRF or DMCM or an increase in shock intensity. Chlordiazepoxide attenuated the effects of all three stimuli. Flumazenil antagonized DMCM and CRF, but not shock, implicating a pharmacologic interaction between CRF and benzodiazepine systems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "Chimeric M1/M2 receptors were expressed in murine fibroblasts (B82) transfected with recombinant m1/m2 receptor genes. The binding affinities of a number of muscarinic antagonists and the agonist carbachol for these chimeric receptors were compared with the ligands' affinities for the M1 and M2 receptors expressed in the B82 cells. The tricyclic compounds, namely pirenzepine (PZ), 11-([2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl)-5,11- dihydro-6H-pyrido-[2,3-6][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116) and himbacine, shared a binding site between transmembrane domains VI and VII. However, the selective interaction of pirenzepine with M1 and AF-DX 116 and himbacine with M2 involved different structural regions. The high-affinity binding for 4-diphenylacetoxy-N- methylpiperidine and hexahydrosiladifenidol was confined to within loop o2 and transmembrane domains V and VI, which were clearly distinguishable from those of the tricyclic compounds. These results support the hypothesis that the ligands' stereochemical features are critical in their optimal alignment within the ligand binding pocket. The cytoplasmic i3 loop modulated the binding of carbachol such that receptors which contained the i3 domain from the M2 receptor exhibited a single high-affinity state, whereas those with the i3 domain from the M1 receptor had an additional low-affinity state for the agonist. The i3 regions are essential for the differential functional coupling of the M1 and M2 receptors to second messenger systems; however, additional upstream regions seem to be essential for a potent and efficacious activation of phospholipase C by the M1 receptor. This study provides new insight into the molecular basis of ligand selectivity.", 
    "53": "Classification of muscarinic receptors in the central airways has revealed the coexistence of M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors in this tissue, with the M2 subtype being predominant. Although M3 muscarinic receptors have been linked to airway smooth muscle contraction, a functional role for the M2 subtype in this tissue has been unclear. In nonairway smooth muscle, stimulation of the M2 muscarinic receptor has been shown to be associated with inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. In the present study, characterization of muscarinic receptors in canine tracheal smooth muscle confirmed that the majority of these muscarinic receptors were of the M2 subtype (89 +/- 3%), with a minor population of M3 receptors (11 +/- 3%). In functional studies, both isoproterenol and forskolin cause a dose-dependent relaxation of precontracted airway smooth muscle. In tissues precontracted with methacholine, 11-([[2-(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl)5,11- dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-6][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116), a selective M2 antagonist, shifted dose-response curves to both isoproterenol and forskolin significantly to the left. In contrast, AF-DX 116 did not alter relaxation induced by the K+ channel opener BRL 38227. Furthermore, the ability of AF-DX 116 to enhance isoproterenol-induced relaxation appears to be limited to smooth muscle precontracted with muscarinic agonists because AF-DX 116 had no effect on isoproterenol dose-response curves in muscle strips precontracted with histamine. Hexahydrosiladifenidol (HHSiD), a selective antagonist for M3 receptors, did not shift the isoproterenol dose-response curve in muscle precontracted with methacholine. This study demonstrates that stimulation of M2 muscarinic receptors in canine airway smooth muscle plays an important role in functional antagonism by reducing the relaxation caused by agents such as isoproterenol and forskolin.", 
    "54": "We studied the mechanism of cholinergic stimulation of mucin synthesis in canine antral explants, including the role of PGE2 as an intermediate messenger. Isolated antral mucosa was incubated with 10(-5) M carbachol (Cb), 10(-5) M indomethacin (IND), 10(-5) M pirenzepine (PZ), 10(-5) M Cb + 10(-5) M PZ, 10(-5) M Cb + 10(-5) M IND, and 10(-5) M IND + PGE2 (10(-8), 10(-7) and 10(-6) M) in the presence or absence of [3H]glucosamine. After 24 hr, total glycoprotein synthesis was quantitated by Sepharose-4B chromatography and by 10% TCA/1% PTA precipitation with lipid extraction. PGE2 released into the media was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Cb significantly increased total glycoprotein synthesis and produced a significant increase in PGE2 release. The increase in glycoprotein synthesis and the release of PGE2 was blocked by the addition of muscarinic antagonist PZ. The addition of IND significantly inhibited glycoprotein synthesis and almost entirely suppressed PGE2 secretion. IND also inhibited the effect of Cb on glycoprotein synthesis and PGE2 release. Moreover, PGE2 (10(-6) and 10(-7) M) significantly increased the glycoprotein synthesis in the canine stomach. This suggests the coordinate participation of PGE2-releasing cell population in modulation of glycoprotein synthesis in gastric mucosa.",

In 154 healthy children, 1-8 yr old, we studied six oral preanesthetic medication regimens according to a randomized, double-blind protocol. Group A (placebo) received 5 mL of apple juice. The other five groups received medication with apple juice to a total volume of 5 mL, 20-60 min before induction of anesthesia. Group B received atropine (0.02 mg/kg); group C received midazolam (0.5 mg/kg); group D received midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) and atropine (0.02 mg/kg); group E received meperidine (1.5 mg/kg) and atropine (0.02 mg/kg); and group F received meperidine (1.5 mg/kg), atropine (0.02 mg/kg), and midazolam (0.5 mg/kg). The sedative effect of midazolam was maximal 30 min after oral administration. Ninety-five percent of the children who were separated from their parents within 45 min after oral midazolam administration (with or without atropine) had satisfactory separation scores (vs 66% of those separated after 45 min; P less than 0.02). Midazolam-treated patients were more cooperative with a mask induction of anesthesia compared with non-midazolam-treated children (83% vs 56%). Neither atropine nor meperidine appeared to significantly improve the effectiveness of oral midazolam. No preoperative changes in heart rate, respiratory rate, or hemoglobin oxygen saturation were noted in any of the treatment groups. Finally, oral midazolam did not prolong recovery even after outpatient procedures lasting less than 30 min. In conclusion, midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) given orally 30-45 min before induction of anesthesia is safe and effective without delaying recovery after ambulatory surgery.", 
    "56": "GTPase activity has been measured in synaptic membranes from bovine retina, with and without muscarinic receptor stimulation. Maximal stimulation above basal levels was achieved with 5 microM oxotremorine and 100 microM carbachol. (4-Hydroxy-2-butynyl)-1-trimethylammonium m-chlorocarbanilate chloride, which is selective for the M1 muscarinic receptor, failed to stimulate GTPase activity. 4-Diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) inhibition of oxotremorine stimulation demonstrated the presence of two populations of receptors, a low-affinity site (IC50 +/- SEM, 0.63 +/- 0.18 microM) which accounted for 63% of the inhibition and a high-affinity site (IC50 less than 1 nM) which accounted for the remaining 37%. When carbachol-stimulated GTPase activity was assayed, a single 4-DAMP inhibitory site was apparent (IC50 +/- SEM, 2.0 +/- 0.9 microM). Pirenzepine inhibited GTPase activity at a single site (IC50 values +/- SEM, 46.9 +/- 11 and 25.4 +/- 6.5 microM against oxotremorine and carbachol, respectively). Methoctramine was equipotent against carbachol and oxotremorine stimulation (IC50 values, 4.2 +/- 1.8 and 6.2 +/- 1.5 microM). Inhibition of maximal carbachol and oxotremorine stimulation by muscarinic antagonists at the major site had a rank order of potency of 4-DAMP = methoctramine greater than pirenzepine. Thus, the major site for muscarinic stimulation of GTPase activity in bovine retinal membranes is pharmacologically similar to M2 receptors.", 
    "57": "Various hormones and growth factors act at least in part by raising the cytosolic pH of the target cell. In the present studies we examined the influence of the muscarinic cholinergic agonist carbachol on intracellular pH (pHi) in chicken granulosa cells. The pHi in granulosa cells from the two largest preovulatory follicles of hens was determined spectrofluorometrically using the pH-sensitive dye 2',7'-bis-(carboxyethyl)- 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). Carbachol (0.1-2 mM) induced a concentration-dependent increase in pHi, which reached a maximum of 0.23 +/- 0.02 pH units at a concentration of 1 mM. Cytosolic alkalinization was observed within 10 min of the addition of carbachol and lasted over the 60-min observation period. The effect of carbachol was mimicked by acetylcholine (1 mM) and muscarine (1 mM), but not by nicotine (0.1 mM). The carbachol-induced alkalinization was blocked by pretreating the cells with the muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonists atropine (1 and 10 microM) and pirenzepine (0.01 and 0.1 mM). The increase in pHi did not appear to be mediated by a conventional mechanism involving the Na+/H+ antiporter, because it was unaffected by replacement of extracellular Na+ with the nonpermeant choline chloride or the presence of antiporter inhibitors, such as amiloride, dimethylamiloride, or ethylisopropylamiloride. However, the mechanism required external Ca2+, but did not involve Ca2+ channels, because it was unaffected by the general Ca2+ channel blocker methoxyverapamil (50 microM). Thus, Ca(2+)-dependent and Na(+)-independent intracellular alkalinization may be a part of the signalling mechanism by which muscarinic receptor activation regulates chicken granulosa cell function.",

Although relevant, these data often do not describe what actually caused the problems. Descriptive data are needed to understand etiologic factors and to accurately set malpractice insurance rates, establish legislative regulations, and determine means of prevention. The purpose of this study was to characterize the factors involved in causing M&M in a national data base of dental patients who received either pharmacosedation or general anesthesia. Letters were sent to all state dental boards requesting detailed information on cases associated with M&M during the last 15 years. Follow-up letters and telephone contacts were made with noncompliant boards. Forty-three cases were reported from nine states, with mortality comprising 81.4% of the cases. The mean patient age was 18 years, with a range from 2 to 42 years. Seventy-five percent of the cases were classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I, 21% as ASA II, and 4% as ASA III. The mean number of pharmacological agents used was three, with a range from one to seven. In 32% of the cases heart rate was monitored, in 23% respiration was monitored, in 23% blood pressure was monitored, in 8% tissue oxygen saturation was monitored, and in 4% heart rhythm was monitored. Fifty-nine percent of the practitioners performed basic life support as a part of resuscitative efforts, 21% performed some measure of advanced cardiac life support, and in 45% of the cases narcotic reversal was attempted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "61": "Preoperative anxiety may increase gastric fluid acidity and volume. To pursue this possibility we evaluated the relationship between peroral premedication, preoperative anxiety, and gastric content in 246 consecutive patients presenting for elective gynecologic surgery. All patients fasted overnight and received either flunitrazepam 1 mg, oxazepam 25 mg, or placebo with 20 mL of water on the morning of surgery in a randomized, double-blind fashion. The patients assessed relief of anxiety using a four-graded scale (excellent, good, fair, poor). Both flunitrazepam and oxazepam decreased anxiety (P less than 0.01) compared with placebo. However, no correlations between type of premedication or level of anxiety and gastric contents were found. The proportion of patients with gastric fluid volume greater than 25 mL and pH less than 2.5 was not significantly different in any of the groups studied. These results suggest that neither peroral benzodiazepine premedication nor preoperative anxiety have a clinically important impact on gastric content in patients presenting for elective gynecologic surgery.", 
    "62": "40 not selected elderly patients (average age 79.3 years were investigated with a oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD). For premedication the patients got 5 mg Diazemuls R and 20 mg Buscopan R i.v. With 30 patients there was taken a blood-gas-analysis before premedication and before fiberendoscopy. ECG-registration was performed before OGD und during OGD with all patients. The premedication led to a reduction of the p02 on an average of 8.9%. The average pO2 did not decrease below the age-related value. In some cases there was a great difference. With a 86-year old woman the pO2 decreased about 25% after premedication and led to a severe hypoxaemiae. Only patients (12.5%) showed a few ventricular extrasystoles, there was no serious arrhythmia. After premedication the heart-rate rose over 100 heart-beats per minute up to maximal 137 beats/minute in 9 patients. If a low dose of Diazemuls R is used, there is no need to do the OGD in elderly patients without premedication. However, there should be the possibility to give a patient oxygen via nasal insufflation to prevent severe hypoxaemia which can occur in some cases. In general, monitoring is only necessary for patients with a higher risk.", 
    "63": "The present research investigated the effects of a minor tranquillizer (temazepam) on P300 in a paradigm that may be relevant for traffic behaviour. Because accident scenes have not been used previously in P300 research, Experiment 1 (n = 8) examined whether the P300 elicited by safe traffic scenes and scenes of imminent road accidents were sensitive to the probability of occurrence. Event-related potentials were recorded from C3, Cz, C4, P3, Pz and P4 within an oddball paradigm. The type of stimulus to which subjects responded (pictures of imminent accidents or safe road scenes) was crossed with the probability (0.1 or 0.5) of the relevant (to which a response was required) event. The results indicated that P300 amplitude increased with decreasing probability of the relevant stimulus and that P300 was most pronounced at Pz. Experiment 2 (n = 12) employed a drug treatment (10 mg temazepam) and a placebo treatment (100 mg Vitamin E). An oddball paradigm with a probability of the relevant stimulus of 0.1 was used and P300 was recorded from Cz, C3, C4, Pz, P3 and P4. Generally, the ingestion of temazepam decreased P300 amplitude and increased P300 latency at all sites. Reaction time, on the other hand, was not influenced by drug administration. The data demonstrate the clear effect of minor tranquillizers on the psychological processes associated with P300.", 
    "64": "A single-case-study approach was used to identify the best medication for treating resistiveness to care in patients with moderately advanced dementia. The double-blind research design incorporated three medications, placebo washout periods, multiple baselines, frequent ratings by nurses of patients' resistiveness, and visual and statistical analysis of results to find the optimal drug, one that provided a stable response at a low dose. Six patients completed the trials. Thiothixene was more effective than oxazepam and diphenhydramine. Important features of the design were its avoidance of polypharmacy and high doses and its use of frequent ratings (each nursing shift) of patients' resistiveness. Although the single-case-study method is labor intensive, it can be beneficial when adapted for clinical use.", 
    "65": "Cases of fatal poisoning among drug addicts (n = 246) and abusers of medical drugs (n = 138) are discussed on the basis of the availability of illicit and medical drugs during the eighties. Propoxyphene was frequently the cause of death among both drug addicts and abusers of medical drugs. Deaths caused by analgesics and psychoactive drugs, mainly barbiturates and antidepressants, predominated among abusers of medical drugs. During the late eighties the number of deaths caused by barbiturates and propoxyphene declined as a result of changes in the distribution regulations for both drugs. Heroin/morphine accounted for only one-third of the poisonings in drug addicts. No trends concerning the prevalence of deaths caused by these drugs were observed throughout the decade. The number of deaths caused by the synthetic opiates methadone and ketobemidone, however, increased during the late eighties, probably due to an increased availability of these drugs in the illicit drug market. Alcohol was detected in half of all the poisoning cases and benzodiazepines in one-third.",

Cannabis was the most prevalent illegal drug throughout the decade. Seizures of heroin predominated among the 'hard' illegal drugs until 1987 but during the late eighties a significant increase in amphetamine seizures was observed. Most of the cocaine was seized in transit, apparently not meant for the Danish market. Medical drugs, particularly benzodiazepines and the synthetic opiates methadone and ketobemidone, comprised an increasing part of the illegal drug market during the period. No seizures of designer drugs were seen. The street level purities of both heroin and amphetamine were, on average, 30-40%.",

Twenty patients have been examined and divided in two groups: group A received droperidol (0.2 mg.kg-1) and group B diazepam (0.1 mg.kg-1) five minutes after fentanyl anesthesia induction (500 micrograms.min-1) to reach the \"sleep dose\". The diazepam pretreatment, as regards droperidol, reduces a dose of fentanyl necessary to obtain the conscience loss (21.5 +/- 2.5 micrograms.kg-1 vs 28 +/- 2.9 micrograms.kg-1). Hemodynamically the droperidol group is very stable, whereas the diazepam group shows certain myocardial depression and less protection at the OTI time.", 
    "70": "1. In a previous publication, we showed that 10 microM carbachol induced contraction by activating three independent transduction mechanisms in circular smooth muscle of guinea-pig gastric fundus (Parekh & Brading, 1991). These were: inositol trisphosphate-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release, Ca2+ influx through a nifedipine-sensitive route and Ca2+ influx through a receptor operated nifedipine-insensitive pathway. The former two processes contribute to the phasic contraction and the latter two to the tonic contraction. In this paper, we have studied the effects of muscarinic receptor antagonists with known selectivity for different muscarinic receptor subtypes, on the contraction evoked by 10 microM carbachol. 2. Low concentrations of pirenzepine (M1 selective) had little effect on the contraction initiated by carbachol. Higher concentrations (greater than 1 microM) reduced only the phasic component. This concentration of pirenzepine greatly reduced the contraction evoked by 10 microM carbachol in Ca(2+)-free solution, indicating inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ release. 3. In the presence of 10 microM nifedipine, the tonic contraction evoked by 10 microM carbachol (reflecting the receptor-operated nifedipine-insensitive route) was abolished by 10 microM pirenzepine. In the absence of nifedipine pretreatment, however, 10 microM pirenzepine did not abolish the contraction to 10 microM carbachol. This contraction was subsequently abolished by nifedipine. 4. Only high concentrations (greater than 10 microM) of the M2-selective antagonist, gallamine, inhibited the contraction to 10 microM carbachol. Like pirenzepine, gallamine preferentially inhibited the phasic component of the contraction, indicating an effect on intracellular Ca2+ release. 5. The non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine, abolished all components of the contraction. At low concentrations, atropine also reduced the phasic component without affecting the tonic one, indicating preferential inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ release.6. It is concluded that (i) the different transduction mechanisms have different sensitivities to the antagonists used and (ii) an M3 receptor activates the three transduction mechanisms with different efficacies.",

Standard curves for pure reference compounds were linear, with the minimum detectable concentration of diazepam and its metabolites as low as 0.13 ng/injection.", 
    "72": "Whereas the efficacy of flumazenil (Fl) for improving vigilance in the presence of other benzodiazepine agonists (BZA) is undoubted, its effect on BZA- and/or opioid agonists (OA)-induced respiratory depression is the subject of controversies. Some authors describe an improvement of a midazolam (Mi)-induced increase in paCO2, whereas others cannot find any influence on diazepam-induced respiratory depression. In two studies in which Fl was used to antagonize Mi/Fentanyl (Fe) anaesthesia we found even worse oxygen saturation values than with placebo (Pl). All our previous studies indicate a slight intrinsic activity of Fl on respiration in the presence of opioids. We therefore investigated the influence of Fl and Pl on expiratory pCO2 and oxygen saturation (SAT). METHODS. A group of 15 male, healthy volunteers aged 20-30 years gave written informed consent to participate in this double blind study, which was approved by our Institutional Review Board. Each subject received 3 micrograms/kg body wt. Fe + 0.5 mg Fl and 1 week later 3 micrograms/kg body wt. Fe + 5 ml NaCl 0.9% (Pl) i.v., in random order. They were undisturbed and breathed spontaneously. The following parameters were measured: SAT, pCO2 and heart rate (HR) continuously, using a pulse oximeter (SAT, H) and CO2 infrared absorption monitor (Oscar, Messrs., Datex). The blood pressure was recorded before and after a 5-min preinjection period (baseline) and at the end of the procedure (25 min). The data were stored in a microcomputer (Multitalent, Messrs. ZAK) and transmitted to a PC after each trial. STATISTICS. The groups were compared with the Wilcoxon rank sum test. P less than 0.05 is significant. RESULTS. In trials 1 and 2 there was an increase of pCO2 and a drop in SAT. The changes in pCO2 and SAT were more pronounced after Fe+Fl in 12 subjects (80%), as against 1 subject with the opposite result. There were 2 subjects who showed no difference between trials 1 and 2. The combination of Fe and Fl caused significantly higher increases in pCO2 (P = 0.007) and more pronounced decreases in SAT (P = 0.04) than Fe and Pl. DISCUSSION. These results indicate a slight enhancement of Fe-induced respiratory depression by Fl. In a previous study it could be shown that Fl antagonized the respiratory depressive effect of Mi, but baseline paCO2 was not completely recovered. In previous studies respiratory function impaired by Mi+Fe was initially improved by Fl, but rebound effects on SAT were observed, which were more pronounced than those after Pl. Therefore, respiratory function must be closely monitored in Fl-antagonized patients after Mi/Fe anaesthesia.", 
    "73": "Optimal dose of epidural midazolam with bupivacaine for postoperative pain relief was investigated. Forty seven patients for upper abdominal surgery were divided into 5 groups. Each group had either 0.25% bupivacaine 6 ml (control group), 0.25% bupivacaine 6 ml + midazolam 0.025 mg.kg-1 (0.025 group), 0.05 mg.kg-1 (0.05 group), 0.075 mg.kg-1 (0.075 group), or 0.1 mg.kg-1 (0.1 group) administered epidurally for complaint of first postoperative pain. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and sedation score (SS) were monitored for 120 minutes, and the time interval for next analgesics (TNA) was checked. In each group, BP fell down 10 minutes after injection, HR was unchanged, and RR (except for 0.1 group) decreased, compared with the preinjection level. There was no difference between control group and others in BP, HR and RR. But 3 cases in 0.075 group and 4 cases in 0.1 group needed chin lift with a pillow under the shoulder for slight airway obstruction. The most optimal SS was obtained in 0.05 group. TNA was significantly longer in 0.025 and 0.05 groups than in the control group. It was concluded that the optimal dose of epidural midazolam with 0.25% bupivacaine 6 ml was 0.05 mg.kg-1 for postoperative pain relief after an upper abdominal surgery.", 
    "74": "We evaluated the sedative and amnesic effects of oral midazolam as premedication in children. Sixteen children, aged 4-12 yr, undergoing elective minor surgery were divided into 2 groups. One group received midazolam 0.5 mg.kg-1 with atropine 0.03 mg.kg-1 orally. The other control group received only atropine 0.03 mg.kg-1. There was no significant difference in the sedative scale at induction between the 2 groups. Doll-recall was used to assess the amnesic effects. In the midazolam group, 75% of the children forgot dolls they had seen on entering the operating room. Midazolam produced significant anterograde amnesia but no retrograde amnesia. This result suggests that children who received midazolam as premedication forget unpleasant memories at induction and their postoperative emotional responses are least influenced by their memories. We conclude that oral midazolam 0.5 mg.kg-1 is an effective preanesthetic medication in children.", 
    "75": "The influence of propranolol on the circadian variations of duration of the anaesthetic effect of diazepam and hexobarbital sodium were studied at 2-hour intervals in two separate round-the-clock observations on mice. Propranolol significantly changed the daily course of the anaesthetic effect of diazepam, caused its inversion and reduced the mean duration of hexobarbital anaesthesia. The observed antagonism between propranolol and hypnotics with varying anaesthetic properties could be attributed to its ability to interfere with both the cerebral neuromediator sleep regulating and beta-adrenoblocking systems but not to its specific blocking effects on pineal functions.", 
    "76": "In the dying patient, coma is preceded by either progressive sedation or the development of the organic brain syndrome of delirium. More than one-third of dying patients experience some difficulties during the last 48 hours of life with noisy and moist breathing, pain, and agitation and restlessness the most common. The great majority of these terminal symptoms can be managed by reassurance or drug intervention. Sublingual lorazepam and continuous subcutaneous infusion of midazolam can be effective in controlling terminal restlessness.", 
    "77": "Radioreceptor binding assays using [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate and [3H]pirenzepine were performed on the pons and medulla oblongata (MeOb) of rat brain. The M1 cholinergic receptor (M1-R) was found to account for approximately 30-40% of the total muscarinic receptors (M-R) in the pons and MeOb, and the M2 accounted for about 60-70%. The receptor binding capacities of scopolamine and atropine were compared with those of pirenzepine (Pir) and AF-DX 116 on the 2 parts of the brain. The affinity values (pKi) suggest that the selectivity of scopolamine for M1-R is greater than for M2-R, and that of atropine for M2 is greater than for M1. In conscious rabbits, the respiratory frequency (FR), tidal volume (TV), and minute ventilation volume (MVV) were determined. Arterial blood samples were taken intermittently and analyzed for pO2, pCO2, and pH. When pilocarpine (a M1-R subtype selective agonist) was given, excitatory effects on respiration were seen through FR, TV, MVV, and the pO2, pCO2, and pH. When 6 beta-acetoxy nortropane (6 beta-AN, a novel M2-R subtype selective agonist) was given, the effects were inhibitory. These results were reversed after administration of Pir, scopolamine, AF-DX 116, and atropine. Thus, it shows that Pir and scopolamine inhibit respiration by blocking the M1-R subtype of the respiratory center, while the excitatory effects of AF-DX 116 and atropine are brought about by blocking the M2-R subtype of the respiratory center.", 
    "78": "Intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of pirenzepine (Pir) 2 mg.kg-1 caused EEG spike discharges, which first appeared in amygdala or hippocampus and then in midbrain reticular formation and cortex.

Injection (300 micrograms) into amygdala or hippocampus also produced EEG spike discharges Hemicholinium 3 (HC-3) 50-150 micrograms.kg-1 icv inhibited the EEG spike and seizure discharges in varying degrees produced by Pir. It is suggested that Pir has a central stimulatory action which is related to cholinergic mechanism.", 
    "79": "The effect of pirenzepine, a peripheric cholinergic antagonist, on GHRH-induced GH secretion was studied in 10 type I diabetic subjects and 8 healthy controls. GH response was significantly greater in diabetics than in the healthy controls (p < 0.02) with peak values of 59.6 and 15.9 ng/ml, respectively. Pirenzepine 20 mg in given 15 min before GHRH inhibited GH response in both groups. In diabetics GH response calculated as area under curve (AUC) was inhibited from 3666 to 260 ng/ml. min (p < 0.001) and in the controls from 831 to 255 ng/ml. min (p < 0.05). The great efficacy of pirenzepine in inhibiting GH hypersecretion in type I diabetes may find a clinical application in future.", 
    "80": "A relationship of urinary catecholamines and of urinary free cortisol with violent suicide attempts has been reported. We have reexamined this issue in patients within 24 hours of hospital admission. Suicide attempters had significantly higher norepinephrine (NE: mean +/- SD = 58.3 +/- 27.0 micrograms/24 hours; n = 27) than did control patients with suicidal ideation (mean +/- SD = 37.1 +/- 21.3; n = 10). Among suicide attempters, those who used physical means had the highest NE levels (mean +/- SD = 69.7 +/- 21.3) and those who took overdoses of antidepressants (mean +/- SD = 51.9 +/- 17.3; n = 6), benzodiazepines (mean +/- SD = 65.1 +/- 29.7; n = 5), or miscellaneous drugs (mean +/- SD = 59.1 +/- 36.5; n = 11) had lower NE values. In contrast to NE, urinary dopamine (mean +/- SD = 402.6 +/- 392 micrograms/24 hours, epinephrine (EPI: mean +/- SD = 14.3 +/- 4.0 micrograms/24 hours), the NE/EPI ratio (mean +/- SD = 8.3 +/- 0.9), urinary free cortisol (mean +/- SD = 157.9 +/- 11.5 micrograms/24 hours) and serum cortisol (mean +/- SD = 35.0 +/- 13.1 nM/l) did not differ between groups. There were no group differences in age (mean +/- SD = 36.3 +/- 16.5 years), Beck Depression Inventory score (mean +/- SD = 26.3 +/- 12.9), Beck Hopelessness Scale score (mean +/- SD = 10.0 +/- 5.6), Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation score (mean +/- SD = 13.6 +/- 9.3), or Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score (mean +/- SD = 19.5 +/- 9.8). In the four parasuicide groups, there was no difference in suicide intent (mean +/- SD = 13.3 +/- 7.9). These findings indicate that there is increased NE output shortly after suicide attempts. Previous reports of a low NE/EPI ratio in suicidal patients may reflect adaptive changes rather than the acute state of the patient at the time of the attempt.", 
    "81": "Ethanol disrupted the discrete lever-press and shuttle avoidances in mice at doses over 1.6 and 2.4 g/kg, p.o., respectively, eliciting a dose-dependent decrease in the % of avoidance with no significant change or slight increase in the response rate. Caffeine increased the response rate of both the avoidances at the doses of 1-30 mg/kg, p.o., but disrupted the avoidance at 100 mg/kg. Caffeine (10 mg/kg) reduced the decreased % of avoidance by ethanol (1.6 and 2.4 g/kg) with a significant increase in the response rate. In contrast, the % of avoidance was significantly lower after the combined administration of ethanol (3.2 g/kg) with caffeine than after ethanol (3.2 g/kg) alone. Unlike ethanol, diazepam (2 mg/kg, s.c.) and pentobarbital (10 mg/kg, s.c.) significantly decreased both the response rate and the % of avoidance. Caffeine (10 mg/kg) ameliorated the decreased response rate and the % of avoidance produced by diazepam and pentobarbital. The present results suggest that caffeine does not effectively ameliorate, but rather may worsen the ethanol intoxication.",

The surface was compared with the theoretical surface to be expected if the interactions between the two drugs were merely additive. The difference between the theoretical and the obtained surfaces was plotted and a functional representation of statistical variability was 'draped' over the difference model. The computer methods can be applied to small amounts of irregularly distributed data, and results are apparent from simple inspection, e.g. the highest peak of backward walking is also the most reliable statistically. The technique is useful for both laboratory and clinical studies.",

Thirty-three fibrobronchioscopies were performed during a period of one year on a group of children under 14 years of age. The most common indications for the procedure were atelectasis (27.3%), recurrent pneumonia (15.1%) and a possible foreign body (15.1%). The most usual sedation (82%) was the combination of Diazepan with Ketamine. Sixteen patients did not require oxygen and only one suffered a serious complication. The benefit of this technique was shown since the treatment of 22 children (67%) was changed following this procedure.", 
    "85": "Buprenorphine was introduced as a potent analgesic with low abuse potential. Reports of buprenorphine abuse by opiate abusers have accumulated over the years, highlighting its use as a cheap alternative to heroin. The lower potency compared with heroin is being compensated by using a cocktail of buprenorphine with benzodiazepines or cyclizine. This study of 18 cases seen over 3 years broadly confirms these findings. Four cases reported haematemesis during acute withdrawal, a symptom not reported in earlier studies.", 
    "86": "Cold water swim stress has been shown to decrease the ability of flurazepam, a prototypic GABA-positive benzodiazepine, to antagonize the electrical precipitation of seizures in mice. This stress-induced reduction in the antiseizure efficacy of flurazepam is not due to a reduction in the threshold voltage for seizure production. In this study, we examined the effect of treating mice with flurazepam 20 min prior to cold water swim stress on its ability to antagonize electrically precipitated seizures 24 h later. Contrary to our expectation, pretreatment with flurazepam potentiated the stress-induced reduction of its antiseizure efficacy.", 
    "87": "Results of the present investigation demonstrated that Ro 15-4513 when given ICV selectively antagonized ethanol-induced motor disturbances at doses that did not produce motor incoordination and lacked proconvulsant activity. Ro 15-4513 in 10-, 15-, and 22-ng doses antagonized, roughly in a dose-dependent manner, ethanol-induced motor incoordination. The 10-ng dose produced an optimal effect with nearly complete antagonism within 30 min postethanol. The higher, 15 and 22 ng, doses of Ro 15-4513 antagonized, as well as probably reversed, ethanol-induced motor incoordination. The stimulation and inhibition of spontaneous motor activity by 1 and 2 g/kg IP ethanol, respectively, were also selectively antagonized by Ro 15-4513. Neither an alteration in the latency and/or duration of pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions nor an antagonism to sodium pentobarbital-induced motor incoordination and inhibition of spontaneous motor activity by Ro 15-4513 at dose levels that showed antiethanol effects were observed. Only the 150-ng dose of Ro 15-4513, which exhibited intrinsic activity as proconvulsant, attenuated sodium pentobarbital-induced motor incoordination. When given alone at doses higher than those used in motor coordination experiments, Ro 15-4513 markedly increased spontaneous motor activity dose dependently.", 
    "88": "The profile of the anxiolytic beta-carboline isopropyl 6-benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (abecarnil; ZK 112 119), a partial agonist at benzodiazepine receptors, was determined in two experiments. In the first, abecarnil was given to WAG/Rij rats; these rats generate spontaneously occurring spike-wave discharges and are regarded as a model for absence epilepsy. Effects were measured on epileptic activity, together with those on the spectral content of the background electroencephalograph (EEG), as well as on ongoing behavior. In a second experiment, effects on sleep and behavior were investigated in Wistar rats. It was found that, similarly to classical benzodiazepines, abecarnil possessed a strong antiepileptic character and also changed the background EEG to more high-frequency waves and less spindle activity. It also produced more immobile behavior. Abecarnil induced only small, marginally significant increases in slow-wave sleep while reducing REM sleep as a proportion of total sleep. It also reduced the number of REM periods. These observations are consistent with the proposed partial agonist activity of abecarnil, a drug with interesting therapeutic implications.", 
    "89": "The effects of two benzodiazepines, diazepam and triazolam, on long-term potentiation were tested in slices of hippocampus and piriform cortex. The drugs had little influence on baseline synaptic responses but both were very effective in blocking LTP elicited by theta pattern stimulation. The effects were fully reversible upon washout. Diazepam reduced the increase in burst responses that occurs during theta stimulation and thus appears to interfere with the initial triggering events for long-term potentiation. This may reflect the enhancing action of the drug on GABA-mediated inhibitory potentials. Triazolam did not detectably change the burst responses elicited by theta pattern stimulation. Experiments with slices of piriform cortex indicated that triazolam also failed to disrupt the development of long-term potentiation but instead caused the potentiation to decay back to baseline in 15-30 min. Triazolam thus seems to act on the mechanisms that stabilize long-term potentiation. These results provide a possible explanation for the amnestic effects of benzodiazepines in humans and animals and support the hypothesis that long-term potentiation contributes to memory encoding.", 
    "90": "A new test, called the 'playground maze', is described. Rat exploratory responses to a single novel object are measured in the context of responses to 7 familiar objects in a familiar environment. Responses are measured as time spent in areas around the objects on a circular open field. These times are expressed as percentages of the total time spent exploring all the objects and a value which is significantly greater than the expected chance level (12.5%) indicates a novelty response. The paths traversed by the animals on the maze are also recorded and the lengths of these give a measure of locomotion. Preliminary experiments on the effects of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) (1-5 mg/kg) and amphetamine (1.5-4 mg/kg) are reported. CDP significantly increased the novelty response but had no effect on locomotion. Amphetamine treatment at 4 mg/kg abolished the response to novel objects while lower doses (1.5 and 2 mg/kg) did not affect it. All 3 doses of amphetamine significantly increased locomotion. This test provides a new way of measuring the exploratory response to novelty under low stress conditions and allows the separation of drug effects on directed exploration and locomotion.", 
    "91": "Midazolam 0.5 mg/kg was given intravenously as a sedative to 19 infants and children undergoing esophageal manometry after oral choral hydrate treatment. The lower esophageal sphincter pressure and motility were measured by manometry before and after midazolam injection. Midazolam did not change the lower esophageal sphincter pressure, blood pressure and respiratory rate of the subjects (p greater than 0.18), and the motility patterns. However, the mean heart rate increased by 5 beats/min after midazolam injection (p less than 0.05). One infant developed transient apnea, reversed promptly by intravenous flumazenil. Sedation occurred within 1 min after intravenous injection of the drug. No other side effects were noted. Midazolam is a relatively safe and effective sedative for accurate lower esophageal sphincter pressure measurement and esophageal manometry when a mild sedative such as choral hydrate does not work."
