The drug is now available as a transdermal therapeutic system (TTS-Scopolamine) which provides constant low plasma concentrations for three days, high enough to act as an antiemetic but low enough to be free from severe side effects. In a double blind study against TTS-Placebo TTS-Scopolamine was investigated in 40 patients, undergoing minor gynecological surgery. The anaesthetic procedure was standardized with alfentanil, etomidate, N2O and, if needed, Ethrane, drugs which have a moderate to strong emetic action. The premedication consisted of Flurazepam (evening) and diazepam (morning). The dosages were standardized. TTS-scopolamine was statistically significantly superior to TTS-placebo with respect to the antiemetic action and the judgment by the anaesthetist. Intraoperative complications such as thoracic rigidity and bradycardia were more frequent in the placebo group. There were no severe side effects. TTS-scopolamine can be recommended as an antiemetic for premedication, especially when benzodiazepines are used for the relief of anxiety. It should be administered on the evening before and can be removed one or two days after surgery.", 
    "1": "The antagonism of various components of maximal metrazol-seizures and the induction of ataxia have been studied in mice and rats by comparing Denzimol to 10 standard antiepileptic drugs. The data were analyzed by Cluster and Principal Components Analysis. Denzimol, phenytoin, carbamazepine and AD-810 showed an antagonistic effect on tonic but not on clonic seizures regardless of the animal species. Barbiturates, benzodiazepines and valproic acid, on the other hand, antagonized the whole pattern of metrazol-seizures. The selective activity of Denzimol and phenytoin against tonic seizures was also confirmed from literature data, which reported the activity of these compounds against bicuculline, thiosemicarbazide or picrotoxin induced convulsions.", 
    "2": "The efficacies of a number of drug treatment combinations in protecting guinea pigs against the lethal and incapacitating effects of soman (and sarin) have been determined. Incapacitation was studied using a swimming test which is a measure of gross motor performance. The drug combinations employed had no effect on the swimming performance of unpoisoned animals. Pyridostigmine pretreatment supported by postpoisoning therapy with atropine, pralidoxime mesylate (P2S), and diazepam protected guinea pigs against the lethal actions of soman and sarin, but the treatment was less effective in protecting against the agent-induced decrements in swimming performance. Replacing pyridostigmine (a quaternary carbamate) by physostigmine (which readily enters the CNS) and introducing aprophen (an anti-cholinergic drug with a range of pharmacological actions) improved the protection achieved against both lethality and incapacitation. When the postpoisoning therapy was omitted, pretreatment with physostigmine and aprophen (or some other anti-cholinergic drug) gave significant levels of protection against both soman- and sarin-induced lethality and incapacitation. It is concluded that a number of different pharmacological actions are required to antagonize nerve agent-induced incapacitation and that they, and their relative importance, remain to be identified.", 
    "3": "Twelve healthy male volunteers received phenytoin 0.5 and 1 g, lamotrigine (a new anticonvulsant) 120 and 240 mg, diazepam 10 mg and placebo orally in a double-blind, cross-over, randomized trial. Maximum drug concentrations at 4 h, measured in plasma were 11.5 +/- 2.2 micrograms ml-1 for phenytoin and 2.7 +/- 0.4 micrograms ml-1 for lamotrigine. These levels were in the therapeutic range for phenytoin and the putative therapeutic range for lamotrigine. Side effects after diazepam (mainly sedation) and phenytoin (mainly unsteadiness) differed markedly from lamotrigine which produced no important side effects. Subjective effects as measured by visual analogue scales were caused by phenytoin and diazepam but not by lamotrigine. Diazepam impaired eye movements, adaptive tracking and body sway. Phenytoin impaired adaptive tracking, increased body sway and impaired smooth pursuit eye movement. Lamotrigine produced only a possible slight increase in body sway. There were significant correlations between performance and saliva levels of phenytoin and diazepam. It was concluded that the tests used were suitable for monitoring CNS effects of anticonvulsants and that lamotrigine possibly could have a more favourable CNS side effect profile than phenytoin.", 
    "4": "Diazepam was administered I.V. in 10mg doses to 26 normal women in labor, and its blood concentration in the mother and newborn, Apgar score and acid-base status in umbilical cord blood were determined immediately after delivery. The effect of diazepam on the neurobehavioral response of the newborn was evaluated by using the early neonatal neurobehavioral scale (ENNS) by Scanlon et al. Diazepam was swiftly transported into fetal blood through the placenta, to attain a higher blood concentration in the umbilical vein (UV) than in the maternal vein (MV) at 1-2 min after administration. The UV blood concentration of diazepam was always higher than the MV blood concentration, irrespective of the time between administration and delivery. A comparison of the blood concentration in the umbilical vein and the umbilical artery (UA), showed that the UV blood concentration was higher until 30 min after administration, but roughly eqalled the UA blood concentration thereafter. In terms of mean values in all the patients, the blood concentration in the UV (506 +/- 245 ng/ml) was significantly higher than that in the MV (350 +/- 204 ng/ml) or the UA (394 +/- 142 ng/ml). No significant difference was detected between the diazepam-treated group and the control in respect to the Apgar score, acid-base status in cord blood, neonatal serum bilirubin or time required for restration of the newborn to body weight at birth. The ENNS test showed suppression of nearly all the response immediately after birth, with suppression of response to pinprick, rooting response and sucking response persisting until 8 hr after birth.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "Prescription forms were obtained for 34 doctors who had been involved in a self-audit of psychotropic prescribing using the practice activity analysis method during the last week of February and the first of March, 1980. The forms were provided by the UK Prescription Pricing Authority after the consent of the participating doctors had been obtained. For 11 of the recorders (group 1) prescription forms were available for February and for the remaining 23 (group 2) for March. For group 1 recorders the two control weeks in the study preceded the observation week and for group 2 recorders they followed it. The total number of prescription forms issued, the number including a psychotropic drug and the number including an antibiotic were compared in the respective observation and control weeks. In group 1 there were uniform reductions of all prescribing during the observation period as compared with the controls. The reduction was attributed to a shortfall in prescription forms identified in the last week of the month. In group 2 there were no differences. The pattern of prescribing indicated by the proportions of drugs in the various categories was consistent throughout. Thus the task of undertaking self-audit did not appear to influence the underlying activity audited.", 
    "6": "Fifty-four patients (34 outpatients, 20 inpatients) fulfilling Research Diagnostic Criteria for Definite Major Depressive Disorder were enrolled in a double-blind study comparing the antidepressant effects of alprazolam versus desipramine. The mean daily dose of alprazolam and desipramine at study termination was 3.78 mg and 208 mg respectively. As there were no significant demographic or clinical differences between outpatients and inpatients, both groups were combined in data analysis. Using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) both drug groups showed highly significant improvement beginning with the first week of active drug treatment. HAM-D scores continued to decrease through study termination (six weeks of active drug). There were no significant differences when comparing alprazolam and desipramine (outpatients, inpatients, or both groups combined) on any of the subjective or objective psychometrics used in this study. Clinically, only twelve of thirty-four outpatients (35.3%) were felt to be \"markedly or moderately\" improved, suggesting that neither the outpatient alprazolam nor desipramine patients did particularly well with drug treatment. In terms of drug safety there was no difference between the alprazolam and desipramine in the number of excessive or serious drug side effects. However, five of twenty-nine alprazolam patients had to discontinue therapy because of excessive drowsiness, and two of the alprazolam outpatients had motor vehicle accidents directly related to this adverse event. Alprazolam appeared as effective as desipramine in the pharmacotherapy of this group of depressed outpatient and inpatients. Alprazolam appeared well-tolerated by most subjects although drowsiness was a common--and at times serious--medication side effect.", 
    "7": "Administration of the long latency convulsant, L-methionine-d,1-sulfoximine (MSO) results in an increase in brain methylation flux. We determined the effects of the anticonvulsant, diazepam (DZ) on MSO seizures and on brain levels of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy) to indicate possible alterations in the brain methylation pathway. We report a dose related inhibition of MSO seizures by DZ. In addition, DZ significantly increased brain levels of AdoMet and AdoHcy and reversed the MSO-induced decreases in AdoMet and AdoHcy. DZ also blocked the MSO induced increase in the methylation index (AdoMet/AdoHcy). The data indicates an inhibition of MSO induced increases in brain methylation by DZ. Possible mechanisms for the effect of DZ on the cerebral methylation pathway are discussed.", 
    "8": "One group of rats (n = 9) was trained to discriminate between the effects induced by 600 mg/kg ethanol and saline, whereas another group (n = 5) had to discriminate between 5.0 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide (CDZ) and saline, administered intraperitoneally (IP) 15 min prior to the training sessions. Once trained, decreasing doses of ethanol in ethanol-trained rats produced decreased discriminative performance; the ED50 was 239.4 mg/kg. Likewise, decreasing doses of CDZ in CDZ-trained rats produced decreased discrimination, with an ED50 = 1.5 mg/kg. Substitution of 1.25-10.0 mg/kg CDZ in ethanol-trained rats produced a transfer of the ethanol-induced interoceptive cue in a dose-responsive manner, whereas ethanol did not substitute for CDZ in CDZ-trained rats. Analysis of dose-response curves suggested that CDZ is acting by a similar mechanism/site in both groups of rats but by a site different than ethanol. Co-administration of the ED50's for ethanol and CDZ in ethanol-trained rats did not produce additive effects. The observed one-way asymmetrical generalization of drug effects, as well as the lack of additive effects of co-administration, are discussed.", 
    "9": "The effects of intravenous as well as dorsal midbrain injections of morphine and chlordiazepoxide on the blood pressure rise induced by electrical stimulation of the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (DPAG) were studied in unanesthetized rats. Chlordiazepoxide applied systemically or locally into the DPAG, as well as locally applied but not systemically injected morphine were found to attenuate the centrally-induced hypertension. These data together with others suggest that benzodiazepines as well as local injections of morphine into the DPAG decrease the aversive effect induced by DPAG stimulation.", 
    "10": "Status epilepticus is a serious emergency that rarely complicates the management of the pregnant patient with seizure disorders.

    "11": "This study examined the 92 suicides investigated by the Medical Examiner's Office in Rhode Island between 1975 and 1982, in which either tranquilizers or antidepressant drugs were present in the body fluids or tissues of the deceased. We found that traumatic suicides were more prevalent among the tranquilizer victims and that tranquilizers were combined more often with alcohol and other drugs. While the antidepressants were obtained by prescription more often than the tranquilizers, the latter were prescribed by a wider variety of doctors. More antidepressant than tranquilizer suicide victims had a history of psychiatric hospitalization and had previously attempted suicide or spoken of it prior to their death. Our findings also seem to indicate that the antidepressant victims took more time and effort in both contemplating and planning their suicides.", 
    "12": "Drug usage patterns were determined from a chart review of two groups of the elderly upon admission to and discharge from the hospital. A comparison was made between a United States group (N = 60) and a Scotland group (N = 60). The most common drugs noted in both groups were cardiovascular drugs (primarily diuretics) and vitamins and minerals. The mean number of drugs per patient in both groups was approximately four, with minimal change in number between admission and discharge. The number of drugs decreased with male sex and increasing age in the United States group and increased with male sex and increasing age in the Scotland group. The Scotland group was on more short-acting benzodiazepines, more bowel medications, more antidepressants, more antiparkinson agents, and fewer respiratory drugs than the United States group. Although both groups tended to have certain drugs deleted, Scotland patients were more likely to have narcotics discontinued and bowel medications added before discharge. These drug usage patterns demonstrate substantial polypharmacy in the elderly and the importance of selecting appropriate drugs in the elderly.", 
    "13": "Forty healthy men and women 19 to 80 years old received a single 10 mg oral dose of the 7-nitro benzodiazepine nitrazepam. Nitrazepam plasma concentrations were measured during the next 72 hours. Among men, the elderly had a larger volume of distribution (Varea) than did younger subjects (1.96 vs. 1.63 L/kg; P less than 0.05); because clearance did not change with age (0.84 vs. 0.95 ml/min/kg), the prolonged t1/2 in elderly men (28 vs. 20 hours; P less than 0.01) was a result of the larger Varea. Elderly and young women did not differ in nitrazepam Varea (2.58 vs. 2.55 L/kg), t1/2 (26 vs. 27 hours), or total clearance (1.19 vs. 1.09 ml/min/kg). The nitrazepam free fraction in plasma (18% to 19% unbound) was not related to age or sex. Among 18 subjects who also received antipyrine, the clearance of nitrazepam and antipyrine were not correlated (r = 0.23). Thus age minimally influences nitrazepam clearance (accomplished mainly by nitroreduction), which in turn is not significantly related to antipyrine oxidizing capacity.", 
    "14": "Contingent negative variation (CNV) behavior was studied in 16 volunteers who were suffering from spontaneous recurrent pain syndromes (idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia, classic migraine). The subjects were divided into two groups, \"more anxious\" and \"less anxious,\" based on psychometric tests (MMPI and STAI X2). The CNV recordings were carried out, respectively, in basal resting state, during an episode of pain, while under anxiolytic treatment, and lastly, during an episode of pain while under anxiolytic therapy. CNV voltage decrease and frequent appearance of postimperative negative variation (PINV) were observed when pain was present during the recording session. These phenomena were more marked when the pain was accompanied by a greater degree of anxiety. Finally, our results suggest that this slow evoked potential is sensitive to various degrees of anxiety and to pain perception in man, making it useful in the investigation of pain as a complex sensation.", 
    "15": "We reviewed the charts of all patients (160) ages 15 and older discharged in 1981 from the four hospitals in Lansing, Michigan with a diagnosis of overdose. Females predominated (65 per cent) and the median age was 27 years. The most common reason for intentional self-poisoning was \"significant-other\" conflict (54.5 per cent), followed by family conflict and financial problems. Benzodiazepines were most commonly used followed by acetylsalicylic acid and ethanol.", 
    "16": "According to present state of literature complete seizure control can be obtained in about 50% of patients with simple partial seizures. In several studies on previously untreated patients with simple partial seizures most patients became seizure-free with carbamazepine or phenobarbital or phenytoin or primidone or valproic acid used as monotherapy. Previous experience has shown that in patients whose seizures are not completely controlled by monotherapy drug combinations like carbamazepine with phenobarbital or primidone or valproic acid and phenytoin with phenobarbital or primidone or valproic acid should be initiated. Several animal experiments are suggestive for a synergistic effect of different antiepileptic drugs. In a previously published study on carbamazepine monotherapy, 6 out of 9 patients with simple partial seizures became seizure-free or improved markedly by this treatment.", 
    "17": "The action of anxiogenetic derivative of beta-carboline FG7142 on evoked activity of neurons in hippocampal sections was investigated using extra- and intracellular recordings. The activity in CAI area was registered upon stimulation of Schaffer's collaterals (SC). Excitatory effect of FG7142 (5 microM) on population spike (PS) was blocked by simultaneous diazepam (5 microM) or RO15-1788 (5 microM) application. This suggests that FG7142 action is mediated by benzodiazepine receptors. To evaluate the action of FG7142 on hippocampal inhibitory processes paired-pulse stimulation of SC was used. It was shown that FG7142 (5 microM) increased 4-5 times the amplitude of the second PS, the amplitude of the first one being much less augmented (10-20%). Such an effect may probably be associated with specific action of GABA inhibition. The following application of diazepam (5 microM) partially reversed disinhibitory effect of FG7142. The main intracellular change observed was the appearance of the local depolarization following the single action potential (AP). With the application continued, this depolarization gave rise to the second AP. The data suggest that suppression of hippocampal inhibitory circuits may contribute to the development of the anxiety feeling.", 
    "18": "The effect of treatment with omeprazole, a substituted benzimidazole, on the elimination of diazepam and phenytoin was studied in two groups of 8 subjects. Omeprazole given orally in a daily dose of 40 mg over 7 days decreased diazepam plasma clearance from 22.4 +/- 2.8 to 10.1 +/- 1.5 ml/kg X h and prolonged the half-life of diazepam from 36.9 +/- 4.1 to 85.0 +/- 14.7 h. Plasma concentrations of desmethyldiazepam, a diazepam metabolite, were reduced after omeprazole treatment. Omeprazole also reduced the plasma clearance of phenytoin from 25.1 +/- 2.0 to 21.4 +/- 1.8 ml/kg X h and prolonged its half-life from 20.7 +/- 1.9 to 26.3 +/- 2.7 h. Renal excretion of the major metabolite of phenytoin (p-hydroxyphenyl-phenyl-hydantoin) was not changed. Omeprazole did not affect the volume of distribution and the plasma protein binding of either diazepam or phenytoin. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that omeprazole in equimolar concentrations (0.5 mM) was a stronger inhibitor than cimetidine of 7-ethoxycoumarin deethylase activity. These data confirm that omeprazole interferes with the elimination of other drugs by an inhibition of the drug-metabolizing monooxygenase system of the human liver.", 
    "19": "The authors present a review of existing literature along with new data regarding the phenomenology, differential diagnosis, course and treatment of panic disorder and agoraphobia. Panic attacks are viewed as central to the development of these disorders, and individual cognitive frameworks contribute to the manner in which a patient's symptoms evolve. An apparent though unclear relation to depressive states is described. Substance abuse may also be a consequence of recurrent panic attacks. A scheme towards differential diagnosis of panic disorder from other psychiatric and medical disorders is proposed. Personality characteristics of these patients vary considerably, but certain factors, such as dependency, are common. Family relations are often strained and assume importance in treatment. Data on the longitudinal course of illness is presented implying a relationship of panic disorder to both depression and stressful life events in many patients. Treatments that thus far seem most effective are pharmacological and behavioural approaches. Imipramine, MAO inhibitors, and alprazolam currently appear to be the most useful medications employed, although other agents may at times be useful alternatives. Dietary interventions, family therapy, and group and individual psychotherapy are also reviewed and discussed as adjunctive therapies in the treatment of panic disorder.", 
    "20": "The purpose of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of pirenzepine and carbenoxolone in accelerating the healing of chronic gastric ulcer. Sixty-six out-patients with endoscopically proven gastric ulcer, without major systemic diseases, were admitted to the study. Patients were randomly allocated to either pirenzepine, 50 mg three times a day for 6 weeks, or carbenoxolone, 100 mg three times a day for one week followed by 50 mg three times a day for the remaining five weeks. At 6 weeks, the ulcers had healed in 20 out of 34 patients (59%) treated with pirenzepine, and in 15 out of 29 patients (52%) treated with carbenoxolone. Symptomatic improvement was similar with both drugs. Some major side effects (oedema, hypokalaemia and hypertension) occurred in approximately 30% of patients treated with carbenoxolone; of those receiving pirenzepine 25% complained of minor symptoms (e.g. dry mouth, headache, tachycardia). It is concluded that pirenzepine and carbenoxolone are of similar, but rather limited, efficacy in speeding the healing of chronic gastric ulcer, but show important differences with respect to tolerability.", 
    "21": "Drug interactions between ethanol and pentobarbital and ethanol and chlordiazepoxide were investigated utilizing mice. At the peak of oral ethanol (0-4 g/kg), either sodium pentobarbital (1-120 mg/kg) or chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride (2-400 mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally. Blood concentrations of ethanol, pentobarbital, chlordiazepoxide, and its pharmacologically active major metabolites were monitored utilizing either gas chromatography or high performance liquid chromatography. Lethality and loss-of-righting reflex were measured as indexes of behavioral drug interactions. It was evident from the isobolographic plot that the interactions between ethanol and pentobarbital and ethanol and chlordiazepoxide were more than additive. Interaction between ethanol and pentobarbital was greater than that between ethanol and chlordiazepoxide. Furthermore, with increasing ethanol pretreatment the shift in dose-response curves for the loss-of-righting reflex was affected more than the shift in dose-response curves for lethality. Blood concentration monitoring of each drug indicated that the rate of biotransformation of pentobarbital was significantly decreased; sequential biotransformation of chlordiazepoxide was also altered, resulting in a large accumulation of demethylchlordiazepoxide in the blood.", 
    "22": "The effect of standard anaesthesia (G-I) and epidural analgesia (G-II) on urinary synthesis of PGE2 was compared in two groups of 12 patients each undergoing orthopaedic surgery. This study demonstrates a significant elevation of renal PGE2 in patients undergoing standard anaesthesia during surgery. In marked contrast, with epidural analgesia, the inhibition of renal secretion of PGE2 is apparent. These findings strongly suggest the important role of the sympathetic nervous system in the synthesis of PGE2.", 
    "23": "Because substance abuse experts are not available in many institutions, the consulting psychiatrist is required to diagnose and manage conditions such as the neonatal narcotic abstinence syndrome, which is readily recognized and treated. The authors discuss morbidity due to this syndrome in neonates born to narcotic addicted mothers. The clinical usefulness of neonatal narcotic abstinence scales is reviewed, with special reference to their application in treatment. The dosing of various drugs currently in use is also discussed.", 
    "24": "Two hundred and two moderately chronic psychiatric outpatients, all suffering from anxiety of at least moderate severity and all diagnosable as cases of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, participated in a single-blind 6-week trial of diazepam (15-40 mg/day). The trial was preceded by a 1 week placebo washout, and provided for evaluation visits after 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks of diazepam treatment. Patients were divided into High, Medium and Low Initial Improvers using 1 week change in Hamilton Anxiety Scale total score to assign patients to three subgroups of equal size. These groups did not differ significantly on those demographic factors and attributes of illness history which were documented, nor on assessments of symptom and illness severity, and mode of intake. Examination of a number of patient and physician assessments of illness severity revealed that the High group had the greatest 6-week improvement, the Low group the least. During the first week, the High group attained 86%, the Medium group, 65%, and the Low group, 29% of its full 6-week drug response. Diazepam dose levels were lowest for the High group and highest for the Low group. Placebo response was least for the High group and greatest for the Low group. An attempt to find distinctive attributes of the three initial improvement groups was unsuccessful.", 
    "25": "This study was designed to compare the antidepressant effects of alprazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine, with amitriptyline hydrochloride in a group of patients with nonpsychotic, major depressions diagnosed by Research Diagnostic Criteria. A mean rapid eye movement latency of less than 65 minutes was required to enter this study. Dexamethasone suppression tests were conducted before treatment. By strictly applied Research Diagnostic Criteria, 83.6% of the subjects were endogenous, and 34.7% were inpatients. A significantly greater percentage of alprazolam-treated patients responded within the first seven days of treatment. By the end of this six-week trial, alprazolam was associated with significant reductions in Hamilton, Beck, Covi, Raskin, and Carroll Rating scores (pretreatment to posttreatment). However, by the end of treatment the effects of amitriptyline exceeded those of alprazolam on both the Hamilton and Beck scales. These data indicate that alprazolam is not as effective as amitriptyline in major depressions with a shortened rapid eye movement latency.", 
    "26": "Propofol in a 1% emulsion was used to induce anaesthesia in 20 female patients premedicated with diazepam (10 mg). A dose of 2.5 mg kg-1 produced a rapid loss of consciousness and only minor excitatory effects. Discomfort during the injection was not severe. Cardiovascular changes included a fall in blood pressure similar to that which occurs with other induction agents, and a decrease in pulse rate. Apnoea occurred after each induction and in some patients (13) was prolonged (greater than 60 s). There were no venous sequelae, and patient acceptance was high. Propofol given in an emulsion to induce anaesthesia merits further study.", 
    "27": "The Quality Assurance Project is developing explicit and detailed treatment outlines for each of the major psychiatric disorders. Three sources of information are used: the treatment outcome literature, the opinions of a sample of practising psychiatrists and the views of a panel of nominated experts. The recommendations for the treatment of somatoform disorders were as follows: brief dynamic psychotherapy, family therapy and excellent medical consultation are the basis for the treatment of hypochondriasis. Limited long-term supportive psychotherapy and good medical consultation are important in somatization disorder. Symptom relief, psychotherapeutic support and meticulous collaboration with physicians are the keys to managing psychogenic pain disorder. Physiotherapy to improve physical functioning and patient education to facilitate the distinction between normal symptoms and abnormal illness behaviours are important in all three conditions. Neither the benzodiazepines nor behaviour therapy appear to be of use in these conditions.",

    "29": "The effects of intrathecal morphine in 60 patients undergoing open-heart surgery were studied in an observer-blind control trial. The patients were randomly allocated into three groups of 20 each: (A) Control, (B) 2 mg and (C) 4 mg of intrathecal morphine. This study confirms that intrathecal morphine provides useful post-operative analgesia. Patients given intrathecal morphine required less postoperative analgesia and sedation and their respiratory function tests were less depressed than the control group. Since the completion of this study, reports have suggested that 1 mg of morphine intrathecally avoids the serious complications of respiratory depression. In the study described, the patients were electively ventilated post-operatively and respiratory depression was therefore not a problem. Of the other associated side-effects of intrathecal morphine, vomiting (20%) and pruritus (20%) proved the most troublesome.", 
    "30": "Studies with [3H]pirenzepine [( 3H]PZ) suggest that this nonclassical muscarinic antagonist selectively identifies putative M1 muscarinic receptors. We now compare the ontogeny of these putative M1 sites, identified by high-affinity [3H]PZ binding, with sites identified by the classical antagonist (-)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ((-)-[3H]QNB) in murine cerebral cortical and cardiac homogenates. Dissociation constants (Kd) for [3H]PZ (2.1-6 nM in the cortex and 2.0-21 nM in the heart) and for (-)-[3H]QNB (10-28 pM in the cortex and 10-39 pM in the heart) are similar in adult and neonatal tissues, whereas receptor density (maximum binding, femtomoles per milligram of protein) varies significantly. Cerebral cortical [3H]PZ binding rises from 14% at birth, to 88% of adult levels by day 14, peaks at 128% at day 28 and falls to the mean adult level of 606 fmol/mg of protein. Cerebral cortical (-)-[3H]QNB binding parallels [3H]PZ binding. Conversely, parallel studies show cardiac (-)-[3H]QNB density is 3- to 17-fold greater than the comparable density of high-affinity [3H]PZ binding sites throughout ontogeny. We conclude that: 1) the high ratio of [3H]PZ binding to (-)-[3H]QNB binding identifies the murine cerebral cortex as a tissue which contains predominantly putative M1 muscarinic binding sites; 2) the relatively low ratio of [3H]PZ binding to (-)-[3H]QNB binding throughout ontogeny identifies the murine heart as a tissue which contains primarily the putative M2 muscarinic binding site; and 3) M1 and M2 receptor binding sites show distinct developmental curves in the cerebral cortex and heart.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "Effects of diazepam (0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg, sc) and pentobarbital (5, 10, 20 and 30 mg/kg, sc) on discrete lever-press avoidance response in the dd strain mice were investigated in consideration of the baseline avoidance levels. The dose-effect relations were obtained with 4 groups of mice showing the baseline avoidance rates of 0-24% (Group 1), 25-49% (Group 2), 50-74% (Group 3) and 75-100% (Group 4). In Group 1, both diazepam (0.5-2 mg/kg) and pentobarbital (5-20 mg/kg) increased the avoidance rate without a marked change in the response rate (frequency of lever-pressings). A significant increase in the avoidance rate was observed when 1 mg/kg of diazepam and 10 mg/kg of pentobarbital were administered. In contrast, both diazepam and pentobarbital decreased the response and avoidance rates in Groups 2-4. These results suggest that the effects of diazepam and pentobarbital on the avoidance response in mice vary depending on the baseline avoidance levels.", 
    "32": "The development of benzodiazepine receptor subtypes in the rat cerebral cortex and cerebellum was studied. The proportions of Type I (CL218872 sensitive binding sites) and Type II (CL218872 insensitive binding sites) in both regions of the neonatal brain were quite different from those of adult. In one day old rat cortex and cerebellum, about 95% of the benzodiazepine receptor were Type II receptor, while these receptors comprised about 50% and 15% of the total in the adult cortex and cerebellum, respectively. From 21 days onward, these ratios in both brain regions did not significantly change through adult age (over 55 days old). The proportion of receptor subtypes in the 21 day cortex (50% type I, 50% type II) was approximately equivalent to that seen in the cerebellum at the 9th day of age. The 3H-flunitrazepam specific binding sites in both brain regions increased markedly after birth, although Type II receptor binding sites did not show any notable gain. Type II receptor specific binding sites in the cortex were not significantly different between neonatal and adult, while these sites in the cerebellum to decrease after birth. These results suggest that Type I and Type II receptors seemed to develop independently during their embryogenesis.",

In particular, there is some controversy about anticonvulsant treatments and on the question of improvements in mental status. An unusual case of 2 monozygotic twins with by this syndrome, both with clinical manifestations appearing within a few hours on the same day, at 6 months has been followed up for 7 years, giving us the opportunity to understand some aspects of the clinical course of the disease and long term treatment.",

The yield, radiochemical yield, radiochemical purity and specific activity of the product ready for an i.v. injection were 276 +/- 76 mCi, 50.8 +/- 7.8%, 99.3 +/- 0.3% and 2.9 +/- 0.5 Ci/mumol, respectively, taking an average of the latest 3 runs. The time required was about 25 min. Each product was sufficient to carry out three successive clinical studies by positron emission tomography (PET). All the procedures other than evaporation and filtration at the final stage were carried out with specially designed equipment connected to a central control system for radioisotope production.", 
    "36": "The effect of two premedications on the sympatho-adrenal and endocrine stress-response to minor surgery under halothane anaesthesia was investigated in 16 children. One group (n = 9) was premedicated with midazolam, 0.1 mg kg-1, and atropine 0.2-0.4 mg i.m. The other group (n = 7) received papaveretum 0.4 mg kg-1 and hyoscine 0.008 mg kg-1 i.m. Plasma concentrations of catecholamines, ACTH and cortisol were measured during undisturbed anaesthesia, during surgery and 15 min post-operatively. There were no differences in catecholamine concentrations between the groups. Prior to surgery, plasma ACTH was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in the papaveretum group. During surgery, plasma cortisol and plasma ACTH were significantly lower after papaveretum premedication. Post-operatively there were no differences. End-tidal CO2 concentrations were similar in the two groups. It was concluded that the endocrine stress-response immediately after induction of anaesthesia and during surgery was lower after papaveretum than after midazolam premedication.", 
    "37": "The effects of treatment with saline, 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg of tifluadom were assessed 30 min after injection on the behaviors shown by isolated Alderly Park strain mice in their home cages in the presence of an anosmic 'standard opponent' mouse. Tests involved videotaping encounters and examining the incidences of 45 behavioral elements and their sequences (by producing 'dendrograms'). The kappa agonist appeared to stimulate olfactory exploration of the substrate at the expense of other forms of non-social exploration; it suppressed olfactory investigation of the 'standard opponent'; reduced some aggressive elements and increased immobility (at reportedly non-sedative doses) and fearful activity. The 'dendrograms' revealed that tifluadom greatly altered the relationships between some elements. The higher dose of the kappa agonist resulted in self-grooming and digging (displacement?) being associated with the agonistic items suggesting that these animals evidenced increased timidity in social encounters.", 
    "38": "It has recently been reported that the concentration of beta-phenylethylamine (PEA) was elevated in the plasma of an individual experiencing convulsions because of an overdose of tranylcypromine. Also, high concentrations of PEA, injected into mice, were reported to induce convulsions. This convulsive effect was prevented by pretreatment with the benzodiazepines diazepam and chlordiazepoxide. In this study, PEA in concentrations from 0.5 to 100 microM failed to alter the binding of [3H]-flunitrazepam ([3H]-FLU) in membrane preparations from mouse rostral forebrain. The metabolites of PEA: phenylacetic acid, phenylethanolamine, octopamine and tyramine, also failed to affect [3H]-FLU binding. This suggests that although there are substances that act as convulsants by interacting with the benzodiazepine receptor sites, the convulsant effect of PEA and its metabolites is mediated elsewhere.", 
    "39": "CGS 9895, a pyrazoloquinolone benzodiazepine receptor ligand, was administered alone and concomitantly with diazepam in order to assess its agonist and diazepam-antagonist properties on various behaviors in rodents. In mice, CGS 9895 neither potentiated nor blocked the convulsant effects of pentylenetetrazole. However, doses of 3.0 and 10 mg/kg of CGS 9895 i.p. produced dose-related antagonism of the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam against pentylenetetrazole (80 mg/kg i.p.). In rats, diazepam produced dose-related increases in ataxia as measured on the rotarod. CGS 9895 (0.3-10 mg/kg i.p.) was without effect on performance on the rotarod, but produced dose-related parallel shifts to the right in the diazepam dose-effect curve. Also in rats, behavior was maintained under a multiple schedule where in one component every 20th response resulted in water presentation (unpunished behavior) and in a second component every 20th response resulted in both shock and water presentation (punished behavior). CGS 9895 (0.3-30 mg/kg i.p.) was without significant effect on either punished or unpunished responding. Increasing doses of diazepam (0.1-10 mg/kg p.o.) first increased and then decreased rates of punished responding but only decreased rates of unpunished responding. CGS 9895 (3.0 mg/kg i.p.) neither potentiated nor antagonized diazepam. In another group of rats, behavior was maintained under a multiple fixed-interval 5 min fixed-ratio 20 response schedule of water presentation. CGS 9895 (0.3-30 mg/kg i.p.) did not affect performance under this schedule. Diazepam (0.3-30 mg/kg p.o.) primarily decreased rates under the fixed-ratio schedule, but increasing doses first increased and then decreased rates under the fixed-interval schedule.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "Subcutaneous administration of caerulein (100-500 micrograms/kg) significantly reduced the development of picrotoxin (8 mg/kg) seizures in male mice. The same doses of caerulein inhibited 3H-flunitrazepam binding in in vivo experiments. Proglumide, an antagonist of cholecystokinin receptors, in low dose (5 mg/kg) potentiated the effects of caerulein (100 micrograms/kg), whereas the administration of proglumide in high dose (25 mg/kg) reduced the action of caerulein on 3H-flunitrazepam binding and picrotoxin seizures. Caerulein (5-1000 nM) decreased 3H-flunitrazepam binding in in vitro experiments only after supplementation of the binding medium with 120 mM NaCl and 5mM KCl. The results suggest the possible interaction of caerulein with chloride ionophor. It seems probable that the direct interaction of caerulein with chloride ionophor in involved in the inhibitory effect of caerulein on picrotoxin seizures and 3H-flunitrazepam binding.",

It is assumed that the changes of benzodiazepine receptor properties are due to alteration in physico-chemical characteristics of synaptic membrane lipids resulting from the activation of lipid peroxidation.",

    "43": "The binding of [3H]diazepam to cell homogenates of embryonic rat brain neurons grown in culture was examined. Under the conditions used to prepare and maintain these neurons, only a single, saturable, high-affinity binding site was observed. The binding of [3H]diazepam was potently inhibited by the CNS-specific benzodiazepine clonazepam (Ki = 0.56 +/- 0.08 nM) but was not affected by the peripheral-type receptor ligand Ro5-4864. The KD for [3H]diazepam bound specifically to cell homogenates was 2.64 +/- 0.24 nM, and the Bmax was 952 +/- 43 fmol/mg of protein. [3H]Diazepam binding to cell membranes washed three times was stimulated dose-dependently by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), reaching 112 +/- 7.5% above control values at 10(-4) M. The rank order for potency of drug binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site in cultured neurons was clonazepam greater than diazepam greater than beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ethyl ester greater than Ro15-1788 greater than CL218,872 much greater than Ro5-4864. The binding characteristics of this site are very similar to those of the Type II benzodiazepine receptors present in rat brain. These data demonstrate that part, if not all, of the benzodiazepine-GABA-chloride ionophore receptor complex is being expressed by cultured embryonic rat brain neurons in the absence of accompanying glial cells and suggest that these cultures may serve as a model system for the study of Type II benzodiazepine receptor function.", 
    "44": "Four hybridoma lines secreting monoclonal antibodies to benzodiazepines were produced after BALB/c mice were immunized with a benzodiazepine-bovine serum albumin conjugate. The monoclonal antibodies were purified from ascites fluids, and their binding affinities for benzodiazepines and other benzodiazepine receptor ligands were determined. These antibodies have very high binding affinities for diazepam, flunitrazepam, Ro5-4864, Ro5-3453, Ro11-6896, and Ro5-3438 (the KD values are in the 10(-9) M range). However, these antibodies have low affinities for the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists (beta-carbolines) and antagonists (Ro15-1788 and CGS-8216).", 
    "45": "The present study was undertaken to compare the effectiveness of a new water-soluble benzodiazepine, midazolam, to diazepam, both administered im for protection against diethyl-p-nitrophenyl phosphate (paraoxon) toxicity. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with midazolam or diazepam (0.32-32.0 mg/kg) alone or in combination with atropine (10.0 mg/kg). Twenty minutes later 2 X LD50 of paraoxon was injected sc and the incidence of seizures and death were recorded for 24 hr. In another series of experiments, the LD50 of paraoxon was evaluated in the rats pretreated im with atropine (10.0 mg/kg) and midazolam or diazepam (10.0 mg/kg). Pretreatment with atropine alone did not prevent paraoxon-induced seizures but did reduce mortality. Both benzodiazepines were very effective alone or when combined with atropine in reducing the incidence of paraoxon-induced seizures. When given alone, neither benzodiazepine protected against paraoxon-induced mortality. However, when combined with atropine both benzodiazepines dramatically decreased the lethality of 2 X LD50 of paraoxon. In equal doses given im, midazolam proved to be more potent than diazepam.",

After thoracic herpes zoster, our patient complained of severe shortness of breath as a result of myoclonus of the abdominal muscles as documented by electromyography. The myoclonus resulted in repetitive interruption of expiratory air flow, resulting in shortness of breath and a staccato speech. This case demonstrates the need to evaluate the function of all the respiratory muscles in a patient complaining of dyspnea.", 
    "47": "H2-Receptor antagonists may interfere with the pharmacokinetics of concomitantly administered drugs. Our study was designed to investigate whether cimetidine or ranitidine influence the disposition and sedative effect of midazolam. The effect of single oral doses of 800 mg cimetidine, 300 mg ranitidine, or placebo on the steady-state concentrations of midazolam was examined in a randomized crossover study in eight healthy subjects. A midazolam steady-state concentration was achieved by an intravenous bolus (0.05 mg/kg)-infusion (0.025 mg/kg/hr) technique. Plasma concentrations of midazolam, cimetidine, and ranitidine and the pharmacodynamic response to midazolam (choice reaction time, sedation index) were monitored throughout the 10-hour infusion. Cimetidine significantly increased the mean (+/- SD) steady-state plasma concentration of midazolam from 56.7 +/- 7.8 to 71.3 +/- 19.6 ng/ml (P = 0.004). In contrast, the steady-state midazolam concentration after ranitidine dosing (61.8 +/- 6.8 ng/ml) did not differ significantly from that after placebo. No change in choice reaction time or sedation index was detected after cimetidine or ranitidine dosing. Nevertheless, in contrast to ranitidine, the recently advocated once-daily dosing of cimetidine has a potential for hepatic drug interaction that should be considered before its coadministration with drugs that have a narrow therapeutic index.",

Their performance on a psychological test battery was assessed 45 min. later. Clorazepate dipotassium produced statistically significant impairment in attention and simple reaction time compared with placebo. Performance on more complex tests of cognitive functioning showed no drug effects.", 
    "49": "In free-moving male rats, when the hippocampal theta rhythm is artificially driven by stimulation in the septum at frequencies between 5 and 10 Hz, the function relating frequency to the threshold current required to drive the theta rhythm has a minimum at 7.7 Hz. This minimum is eliminated by anxiolytic drugs. Dose-response curves for this effect are reported for chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and meprobamate. The effect of meprobamate was reversed by two gamma-aminobutyrateA antagonists, picrotoxin and bicuculline, which have previously been shown to be without effects of their own. The gamma-aminobutyrateB agonist, baclofen, also without effect on its own, blocked the elimination of the 7.7-Hz minimum caused by the gamma-aminobutyrateA agonist, muscimol. The beta-carboline, ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, had mixed agonist/antagonist properties, blocking the effects of chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and muscimol (though not sodium amylobarbitone) but itself acting like a benzodiazepine. Coupled with earlier data, these findings support a role for gamma-aminobutyrate receptors in mediating the effects of anxiolytic drugs.", 
    "50": "In the mouse, injection (subcutaneously) of the putative 5-HT1 agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), produced a dose-related hypothermia (ED50:0.36 mg/kg). A maximum response was elicited by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of 8-OH-DPAT (3 micrograms) and almost abolished by lesion of 5-HT-containing terminals in the brain with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT; i.c.v.) or long-term treatment with p-chlorophenylalanine. The response was unaltered by a range of neurotransmitter antagonists: prazosin (alpha1-adrenoceptor), idazoxan (alpha2-adrenoceptor), metoprolol (beta1-adrenoceptor), erythro-DL-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylamino-but an-2-ol (beta2-adrenoceptor), (-)propranolol or (+/-)pindolol (beta-adrenoceptor), flupenthixol (dopamine) or Ro 15-1788 (benzodiazepine binding site). Classical 5-HT antagonists (methysergide, metergoline, cinanserin and methiothepin) were either without effect or facilitated the response and the 5-HT2 antagonist, ritanserin was also without effect. In contrast, quipazine and haloperidol produced a dose-related antagonism of the response. Since the response was almost abolished by a lesion induced by 5,7-DHT and was antagonised by quipazine, which is known to antagonise presynaptic 5-HT function in vitro, it is suggested that the hypothermic response is due to 8-OH-DPAT acting as an agonist at a presynaptic 5-HT receptor, which also appears to be sensitive to butyrophenones (the antagonism elicited by haloperidol but not by flupenthixol). The hypothermic response of mice to 8-OH-DPAT, therefore, may provide a simple and convenient in vivo model in which to measure the function of the presynaptic 5-HT receptor.", 
    "51": "The effect of 450191-S, one of the 1H-1,2,4-triazolyl benzophenone derivatives and possessing benzodiazepine-like anti-anxiety actions, on the content of various amino acids in the mouse brain was examined in comparison with that of nitrazepam. Among the various amino acids examined, only glycine, aspartic acid and alanine showed a statistically significant decrease following the oral administration of 450191-S. The oral administration of nitrazepam also induced a similar decline in the cerebral contents of glycine and alanine. Furthermore, it was found that the administration of Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine antagonist, eliminated the 450191-S-induced decline in the cerebral contents of glycine and aspartic acid. These results indicate that the administration of 450191-S induces the decrease of glycine and aspartic acid, neuroactive amino acids, in the brain, possibly via the activation of benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "52": "The effect of nizatidine, a new H2-receptor antagonist, on the hepatic metabolism of three probe drugs was studied in normal volunteers. The drugs studied were chlordiazepoxide and theophylline which are metabolized in part by N-demethylation by the hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 system and lorazepam which is conjugated to lorazepam glucuronide. A 7 day course of nizatidine did not interfere with the disposition of any of these therapeutic agents in man.", 
    "53": "Narcosis applied in emergency care is a possibility of offering pain relief to the emergency patient. Over and above this, however, it has become increasingly important to prevent pathophysiological changes resulting from the state of shock of the patient. Nevertheless, this measure should be restricted to skilled personnel only, provided of course that the emergency service in question is adequately equipped both technically and with suitable drugs. A decisive role is played by the drugs selected for this purpose. The article describes the pros and cons of various drugs administered via the intravenous route to induce narcosis. So far, there is no ideal drug for this purpose. It will always be necessary to arrive at a compromise and to adapt the drug to the individual situation and to the extent of basic damage suffered by the emergency patient.", 
    "54": "After i.v. injection of camazepam, plasma camazepan concn. declined biexponentially. The half-life of the elimination phase (t1/2, beta) increased in the order: mice (0.73 h), rats (1.3 h), dogs (5.3 h). After oral dosing of camazepam, absorption was almost complete whereas systemic availability varied eight-fold, i.e., rats and mice (10-15%) less than dogs and monkeys (about 60%) less than humans (greater than 90%), indicating species difference in the first-pass effect. Camazepam was metabolized extensively in all species investigated to more than 10 metabolites, which were desmethyl, descarbamoyl and/or hydroxy products. In comparison with camazepam, plasma concn. of pharmacologically active metabolites, temazepam, oxazepan and hydroxy camazepam, were much higher in rats and mice than in dogs and monkeys.", 
    "55": "Tofisopam, a 2,3-benzodiazepine, has been shown to have anxiolytic activity. However, in contrast to the widely used 1,4-benzodiazepines, it has no anticonvulsant, sedative or muscle relaxant effects. Tofisopam enhanced the behavioural actions of various dopaminergic drugs, both direct agonists, such as apomorphine (climbing behaviour in mice), and indirect agonists, such as (+)-amphetamine and amineptine (jumping behaviour in mice). Chronic treatment with lithium abolished the tofisopam-induced increase in the activity of these dopaminergic drugs. Thus tofisopam appears to induce acutely an increase in the sensitivity of central dopaminergic receptors which can be prevented by pretreatment with lithium.", 
    "56": "Receptor autoradiographic techniques have been used to demonstrate the selectivity of two trifluoroethyl-containing benzodiazepines for one of the subtypes of benzodiazepine receptor. Indirect localization of the binding sites for quazepam and halazepam was accomplished by using the ability of these compounds to displace [3H]-flunitrazepam binding. The appropriate binding parameters were selected on the basis of initial studies aimed at identifying the binding characteristics of several benzodiazepine compounds in comparison with the triazolopyridine CL218,872. Autoradiographic analysis of the benzodiazepine sites displaceable with quazepam and halazepam revealed the two benzodiazepine compounds preferentially labeled receptor sites in regions of the brain dominated by the type 1 benzodiazepine receptor subtype. Thus, quazepam and halazepam preferentially bind to benzodiazepine type-1 receptors in lamina IV of the cerebral cortex, the zona incerta, substantia nigra and the cerebellum.",

Clearly efficacious and relatively safe, benzodiazepines should be considered the first-line drugs of choice to treat anxiety associated with Alzheimer's disease. \"Second-generation\" antidepressants, although considerably more expensive than the tricyclics, are of significant benefit in the elderly, primarily because of extremely low anticholinergic side effects.", 
    "60": "The effects of chlordiazepoxide (CDAP) on suppressed behavior of squirrel monkeys were determined alone and in combination with selected methylxanthines (caffeine, theophylline, 8-phenyltheophylline, theobromine, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) and analogs of adenosine (L-PIA, N6-cyclohexyladenosine, NECA). Monkeys responded under a fixed-interval schedule of food presentation in which responding was suppressed by a concurrent fixed-ratio schedule of response-produced electric shock. Dose-effect curves were determined by administering cumulative doses i.v. during timeout periods that preceded sequential components of the schedule. When administered alone, CDAP produced dose-related increases in the rate of suppressed responding at doses up to 17.8 mg/kg and decreased responding at a higher dose of 32.0 mg/kg. Under the same conditions, the methylxanthines usually had only small effects on responding over the range of doses studied, whereas L-PIA and NECA usually decreased responding in a dose-related manner. After presession treatment with intermediate doses of caffeine, 8-phenyltheophylline or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, the increases is suppressed responding produced by CDAP often were larger than those produced by CDAP alone. In contrast, after presession treatment with low doses of L-PIA, NECA or N6-cyclohexyladenosine the increases in suppressed responding normally produced by CDAP were either reduced or eliminated. Although L-PIA, NECA and N6-cyclohexyladenosine attenuated the rate-increasing effects of CDAP, there was no indication that they produced an overall rightward shift in the CDAP dose-effect curve, suggesting that the adenosine analogs did not act simply as competitive antagonists of CDAP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "The effectiveness of a variety of clinical anticonvulsant drugs was evaluated in the quaking mutant mouse model of epilepsy. In this model, tonic-clonic seizures are easily elicited by handling and the effects of administration of carbamazepine (CBZ), phenytoin (DPH), phenobarbital (PB), diazepam, valproic acid (VPA) and ethosuximide were quantitatively evaluated. Chronic oral administration of CBZ, DPH and PB reduced the frequency of seizures and this was positively correlated with plasma levels of the drugs. The plasma levels of the 10,11-epoxide metabolite of CBZ were found to be approximately 3-5 times that of the parent compound with chronic oral administration. Acute intraperitoneal administration of the other drugs revealed VPA to be an effective anticonvulsant agent, whereas ethosuximide and diazepam were ineffective at dosage levels that are normally effective in mice as determined by classical testing methods such as electroshock and chemoshock. The results of the present study suggest that the quaking mouse may be a simple, reliable and inexpensive animal model for the evaluation of agents effective against focal motor seizures in humans.", 
    "62": "Pitrazepin (3-(piperazinyl-1)-9H-dibenz(c,f)triazolo(4,5-a)azepin) is a new GABAA receptor antagonist reported to antagonize electrophysiological effects of GABA. We have investigated in some detail the interaction of pitrazepin with the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor chloride channel complex. Pitrazepin was found to be a competitive inhibitor of the GABAA receptor which is coupled to [3H]diazepam and [35S]TBPS binding sites; the KI value obtained by Schild analyses was 80 nM. Although pitrazepin interacted weakly with BZ receptors the compound did not affect the chloride gating mechanism (labelled with [35S]TBPS or [3H]avermectin B1a). Further, pitrazepin was a non-selective GABA antagonist since glycine receptors, labelled with [3H]strychnine, were affected at low concentrations (the KI values in rat brain-stem were 71-110 nM).", 
    "63": "Parasuicides continue to be an important public health responsibility. The consensus of opinion of most research workers is that the previously observed high rates are increasing on an international scale. Generally tabulated figures are minimal, representing an underestimation of actual rates, and exclude an unknown proportion of events classed incorrectly, although such studies nevertheless give some comprehension of the nature and severity of the problem. A 1978 study of parasuicides in young patients seen in the Department of Psychiatry, Addington Hospital, Durban, is updated for the period 1 January - 31 December 1983. The overall patient attendance figure for this period was 10 984, while a total of 3 200 requests for consultations were received. Of these 567 were for patients referred because of parasuicides--17,7% of all consultations referred. Nearly one-third (29%) of the parasuicides were in young patients, i.e. of 19 years old and younger, which represents a notable increase for the next 5 years when compared with the 1978 study in which 25% of parasuicides were in patients in this age range. There were more girls than boys. Peak months were October and November. A number of patients had a history of earlier parasuicides, suicidal thoughts and psychological treatment or came from a family with a history of mental disorder or previous parasuicides. Ten per cent of patients had a history of alcohol or drug abuse. Self-poisoning with analgesics, benzodiazepines and antidepressants was the most common method used. Results are discussed within the context of a service in medical psychology in a general hospital.", 
    "64": "Benzodiazepine-binding sites were studied on frozen sections of 5 human hippocampi, using autoradiographic and biochemical techniques. The affinity, density, distribution and heterogeneity (two types) of sites were investigated using [3H]flunitrazepam as a ligand, clonazepam or C1 218872 as displacing agents. The autoradiographic images evidence a differential distribution of the binding sites in the histologic layers of the hippocampus. Subtypes I and II coexist in the same proportion in the three layers exhibiting the highest densities of binding sites (stratum granulosum and pyramidale, deep layer of stratum radiatum). The Kd, Bmax and Ki values found here are analogous to those described in animal studies, but the anatomical distribution of the sites in human hippocampus seems to differ slightly from that previously described in that of the rat.", 
    "65": "The convulsant influence of high doses of diazepam, in the presence of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788, was studied in rats. Animals were implanted with permanent cortical screw electrodes for EEG recording. EEG spiking and accompanying clonic activity was observed in rats receiving greater than or equal to 200 mg/kg diazepam, followed 10 minutes later by Ro 15-1788 (20 mg/kg). Pentylenetetrazole and picrotoxin seizure thresholds, measured during constant rate iv infusion, were significantly lowered by pretreatment with diazepam (250 mg/kg) and Ro 15-1788 (20 mg/kg) administered 30 and 20 minutes, respectively, before seizure threshold measurement. It is proposed that this convulsive activity of diazepam is mediated through the picrotoxinin receptor.",

Specific binding of beta-[3H]carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester in the cerebellum and frontal cortex was influenced by dithiothreitol in a similar manner. However, in the hippocampus the binding of this inverse agonist was modified by dithiothreitol in another way: a significant (25%) decrease of binding capacity, or (and) appearance of heterogeneity of binding sites was detected. Sensitivity of benzodiazepine receptors to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) stimulation was not changed by dithiothreitol.", 
    "68": "Most drugs that affect the central nervous system have the potential to impair driving ability. For many years, alcohol (ethanol) has been the drug of greatest concern, since it is, by far, the most frequently recognized cause of drug-impaired driving. Yet as more therapeutic agents, such as benzodiazepines, are introduced and widely used, and as social use of unsanctioned drugs such as cannabis (marijuana) increases, attention must be directed toward other drugs. The National Institute on Drug Abuse sponsored a conference on drugs and driving in Durham, NC, in October 1983. The objective was to reach a consensus on several key issues associated with the current state of knowledge about the relationship between body fluid concentrations of drugs and their pharmacologically active metabolites and degree of driving impairment. It was also of interest to ascertain whether a sufficient body of knowledge exists for an expert to form an opinion, which will meet the applicable standards of proof for legal proceedings, that a person's driving ability was impaired based on body fluid concentrations of a drug. The consensus panel, representing the disciplines of clinical pharmacology, analytical and forensic toxicology, law, and forensic medicine agreed on answers to the following questions: Is ethanol a good model for other drugs? What drugs might have a potential for impairing a driver? How is driving impairment measured? What is known about correlations between driving impairment and drug concentrations? Could \"per se\" concentrations be established for drugs other than alcohol? Can impairment be established from body fluid concentrations?", 
    "69": "A rapid, sensitive and selective high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay was developed for the determination of midazolam, 8-chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]- benzodiazepine (I), and its four metabolites in plasma. The assay involves extraction into diethyl ether--methylene chloride (7:3) from plasma buffered to pH 9 and subsequent analysis by reversed-phase HPLC with ultraviolet detection at 254 nm. The overall recovery of I from dog plasma was 94.5 +/- 7.1% and greater than 89.0% for its metabolites. The sensitivity limit of the assay was 50 ng/ml of plasma for all compounds. The HPLC assay was used to determine plasma concentrations of I and its metabolites from selected samples taken from an oral toxicity study in the dog.", 
    "70": "The effect of flunitrazepam and DMCM was examined on the kinetics of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding. The enhancing effect of flunitrazepam and the decreasing effect of DMCM on TBPS binding was due to non-equilibrium conditions. The anticonvulsant benzodiazepine increased both the association and dissociation rate constants. The convulsant beta-carboline had the opposite effect. Benzodiazepine receptor ligands might affect the convulsant TBPS sites parallel with opening/closing of the chloride ionophores.", 
    "71": "The relationship of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and high affinity binding of the potent and selective sodium-dependent choline uptake inhibitor [3H]hemicholinium-3 ([3H]HC-3) to high-affinity binding of the muscarinic agonist [3H](+)-cis-methyldioxolane ([3H](+)CD), the putative M1 selective antagonist [3H]pirenzepine ([3H]PZ) and the classical antagonist [3H](-)-quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H](-)QNB) in homogenates of the rat neocortex was studied. ChAT activity was 42% lower in rats with ibotenate-induced lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nbm) when compared to controls, and [3H]HC-3 binding was similarly reduced by 44%. However, equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd values) for [3H]HC-3 (0.8-1.0 nM), [3H](-)QNB (11-24 pM), [3H]PZ (4.0-4.3 nM) and [3H](+)CD (2.1-2.9 nM) were each unchanged. Mean Bmax values (total binding site densities) for [3H](+)CD were significantly altered in both hemispheres of the anterior cerebral cortex, showing a 25% reduction in the number of sites which display the highest affinity conformation for this potent muscarinic agonist. The decreased ChAT activity and [3H]HC-3 binding after nbm lesions were associated with only slight reductions in putative M1 muscarinic site density (14%) and [3H](-)QNB binding site density (13%). Thus, it appears that while [3H]PZ and [3H](-)QNB label predominantly postsynaptic muscarinic binding sites, a significant number of sites labeled by [3H](+)CD may be associated with presynaptic cholinergic nerve terminals. These data suggest that cholinergic input differentially regulates the drug binding sites of anterior cerebral cortical muscarinic receptors, exerting a substantial effect upon the highest affinity conformational state for agonists.", 
    "72": "Cold-restrained stress increased rat pineal melatonin and N-acetylserotonin content. This effect was partially prevented by lorazepam. Serotonergic turnover (ratio of 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid to serotonin) was significantly decreased in stressed but not in stressed rats pretreated with lorazepam, suggesting stress-induced inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO). Literature data indicate that the same type of stress increases the production of the endogenous MAO inhibitor. The implication of stress-induced MAO inhibition on melatonin synthesis in anxiety and drug withdrawal is discussed."
