    "1": "This 47-week, randomized, double-blind study compared flexibly dosed olanzapine (5-20 mg/day) to divalproex (500-2500 mg/day) for manic or mixed episodes of bipolar disorder (N=251). The only other psychoactive medication allowed was lorazepam for agitation. The primary efficacy instrument was the Young Mania Rating Scale; a priori protocol-defined threshold scores were > or =20 for inclusion, < or =12 for remission, and > or = 15 for relapse. Analytical techniques included mixed model repeated-measures analysis of variance for change from baseline, Fisher's exact test (two-tailed) for categorical comparisons, and Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to events of interest.", 
    "2": "Over 47 weeks, mean improvement in Young Mania Rating Scale score was significantly greater for the olanzapine group. Median time to symptomatic mania remission was significantly shorter for olanzapine, 14 days, than for divalproex, 62 days. There were no significant differences between treatments in the rates of symptomatic mania remission over the 47 weeks (56.8% and 45.5%, respectively) and subsequent relapse into mania or depression (42.3% and 56.5%). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurring significantly more frequently during olanzapine treatment were somnolence, dry mouth, increased appetite, weight gain, akathisia, and high alanine aminotransferase levels; those for divalproex were nausea and nervousness.",

    "5": "Following the logical steps to establish diagnostic validity when the etiology of a syndrome is unknown, the authors review the literature on the features that delineate catatonia as a syndrome, the prevalence and response to treatment of catatonia, and the conditions that are associated with catatonia.", 
    "6": "Catatonia is a well-defined syndrome that can be reliably ascertained. Although more than 40 motor signs of catatonia are known, the presence of two prominent features for 24 hours or longer is sufficient to identify the syndrome. Catatonia is found in about 10% of acutely ill psychiatric inpatients and is more commonly observed in persons with mood disorder than in those with schizophrenia. It is found in many conditions and presents mainly as retarded-stuporous or excited-delirious forms. Catatonia responds to specific treatments, including sedative anticonvulsants (barbiturates and benzodiazepines) and ECT.", 
    "7": "Catatonia can be distinguished from other behavioral syndromes by a recognizable cluster of clinical features. Catatonia is sufficiently common to warrant classification as an independent syndrome. It can be reliably identified, has a typical course when appropriately treated, responds to specific treatments, and is worsened by other treatments. It is associated with many pathophysiologic processes and most often with mood disorder. These findings, which are consistent with established methods of defining distinct diagnostic groupings, support consideration of catatonia as an individual category in psychiatric diagnostic systems.",

For one-pot one-step labeling, the precursors, 2'-tosyloxyflumazenil (TFMZ) and 2'-mesyloxyflumazenil (MFMZ), were synthesized in three steps. The precursors were successfully labeled with no-carrier-added (18)F-fluoride which was activated by repeated azeotropic distillation with Kryptofix 2.2.2./potassium carbonate in MeCN. An automated system for labeling and purification of [(18)F]FFMZ was developed. Labeling efficiency and radiochemical purity of [(18)F]FFMZ after synthesis by the automated system were 68% and 98%, respectively. Specific binding of [(18)F]FFMZ to central benzodiazepine receptor of rats was demonstrated by phosphoimaging.", 
    "9": "DAA1106 (N-(2,5-Dimethoxybenzyl)-N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide), is a potent and selective ligand for peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) in mitochondrial fractions of rat (K(i)=0.043 nM) and monkey (K(i)=0.188 nM) brains. This compound was labeled by [(11)C]methylation of a corresponding desmethyl precursor (DAA1123) with [(11)C]CH(3)I in the presence of NaH, with a 72+/-16% (corrected for decay) incorporation yield of radioactivity. After HPLC purification, [(11)C]DAA1106 was obtained with > or =98% radiochemical purity and specific activity of 90-156 GBq/micromol at the end of synthesis. After iv injection of [(11)C]DAA1106 into mice, high accumulations of radioactivity were found in the olfactory bulb and cerebellum, the high PBR density regions in the brain. Coinjection of [(11)C]DAA1106 with unlabeled DAA1106 and PBR-selective PK11195 displayed a significant reduction of radioactivity, suggesting a high specific binding of [(11)C]DAA1106 to PBR. Although this tracer was rapidly metabolized in the plasma, only [(11)C]DAA1106 was detected in the brain tissues, suggesting the specific binding in the brain due to the tracer itself. These findings revealed that [(11)C]DAA1106 is a potential and selective positron emitting radioligand for PBR.", 
    "10": "GABA(A) receptors are chloride ion channels that mediate fast synaptic transmission and belong to a superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. The recently published crystal structure of the acetylcholine binding protein can be used as a template for comparative modeling of the extracellular domain of GABA(A) receptors. In this commentary, difficulties with comparative modeling at low sequence identity are discussed, the degree of structural conservation to be expected within the superfamily is analyzed and numerical estimates of model uncertainties in functional regions are provided. Topography of the binding sites at subunit-interfaces is examined and possible targets for rational mutagenesis studies are suggested. Allosteric motions are considered and a mechanism for mediation of positive cooperativity at the benzodiazepine site is proposed.", 
    "11": "Depression can occur either with or without alternation with periods of mania. Depression that alternates with mania (bipolar depression) is a particularly difficult problem in clinical practice. The evidence base of the treatment for this condition is not strong and the choices at best are limited. Furthermore, although there are a number of effective antidepressants for the non-cycling variety ('unipolar' major depression), > 50% of patients experience incomplete response to any given drug. Given the proportion of the population involved, these represent fairly sizeable markets. Studies over the last several years indicate that the combination of the novel antipsychotic olanzapine and the serotonin-selective re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine, may be effective for both conditions. One trial in 28 patients showed that this combination was an effective treatment, compared to the individual components with unipolar depressed patients who had not responded to two antidepressants of different chemical classes. Two subsequent large-scale attempts at replication have resulted in failed trials. Patients randomly assigned to antidepressant monotherapies showed a good response, indicating that the populations being studied were not actually treatment-resistant; therefore, more research is needed. Alternatively, a recent study showed that monotherapy with olanzapine produced a greater effect than placebo in bipolar depression and the combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine yielded an even more robust response. However, important questions remain, e.g., the issue of comparative effectiveness, that is to say, whether the same result could occur with combinations of other novel antipsychotics and SSRIs. In addition, there remain significant concerns regarding the safety and tolerability of olanzapine in these populations. Essential questions about the potential for substantial weight gain, Type II diabetes and for the development of tardive dyskinesia (a syndrome of permanent, disfiguring abnormal involuntary movements) remain. These problems will have to be vigorously addressed in order to achieve a substantial market penetration for these conditions.", 
    "12": "Medication-related problems are most commonly reported in elderly patients. It is for this reason that the development of services supporting appropriate medication management in the elderly is paramount; particularly for those living in residential care facilities. In 1991, Australia had very limited services supporting the quality use of medicines for residents of aged-care facilities. Over 11 years, from 1991-2002, the range of services has expanded considerably. Federally funded medication review services are now available, with over 80% of residents provided with the service. Medication advisory committees, in accordance with national practice guidelines, have been established in many facilities to address issues concerning medication management. Fifty percent of Australian's pharmacies are registered to provide services, with over 10% of the country's pharmacists accredited to provide the service. National practice guidelines for medication management in aged-care facilities have been incorporated into accreditation standards for aged-care facilities, further integrating activity into the wider health system. The environment was created for these activities through the formation of the Pharmaceutical Health and Rational Use of Medicines (PHARM) Committee, an expert advisory committee, and the Australian Pharmaceutical Advisory Council (APAC), a representative council. Both groups had responsibility for advising the Federal Minister of Health. They both identified medication misadventure in residential aged care as a priority issue and through their recommendations the Government devoted funds to the development of best practice guidelines and research activity. Clinical pharmacy services in nursing-home and hostel settings were found to reduce the use of benzodiazepines, laxatives, NSAIDs and antacids leading to cost savings to the health system. Dose-administration aids were found to reduce error rates during medication administration, and the alteration of medications for administration to residents was found to be common practice and potentially problematic. Research in the Australian setting demonstrating effectiveness, as measured by changes in medication use or health outcomes, as well as actual or potential cost savings has been a critical success factor. In addition, prioritisation by government advisory committees, inquiries and policy documents, have assisted in the development of services from ideas in 1991 to nationally funded realities in 2002.", 
    "13": "This review summarizes current key research strategies and the most prominently pursued new potential treatments for schizophrenia. First, new routes of administration for second generation antipsychotics are presented. These include rapidly dissolving tablets, drops and sirups as well as new intramuscular formulations. Newly available short acting and long acting (depot) antipsychotics complement oral antipsychotics so that the full spectrum of routes of administration is now available for second generation antipsychotics. Next to antipsychotic polypharmacy, in which two or more antipsychotics are combined, pharmacological add-on treatments, mainly with benzodiazepines, antidepressants and mood stabilizers enjoy increasing popularity. Most of this practice is driven by personal preferences, clinical experience and marketing rather than evidence based medicine. New pharmacological mechanisms currently utilized in advanced states of development include partial dopamine D2-receptor agonism, supplementation with glutamatergic agents, estrogen and omega-3-fatty acids. While the concept of partial D1-agonism has already led to the successful launch of a new antipsychotic, aripiprazole, the other attempts to improve therapeutic response in schizophrenia patients have so far provided equivocal results. It is argued that they may be helpful for certain subgroups or specific symptoms of schizophrenia patients. In conclusion, many exciting new pharmacological leads are currently pursued and this will very likely augment the options for treating patients with schizophrenia.",

    "16": "OTC and prescription medicine misuse places a burden on health and social services in South Africa. This is evidenced through the constant demand for treatment for OTC/prescription medicine misuse. Benzodiazepines are the class of medicines for which users most often receive treatment, followed by analgesics. Analgesic misuse is most often accounted for by the use of codeine-containing medicines, many of which are available over the counter. Patients using OTC/prescription medicines as their primary drug of abuse are significantly more likely to be female, and aged over 40 years. In contrast, patients using OTC/prescription medicine as an additional drug of abuse tend to be male and over 40 years of age.", 
    "17": "This study points to the need to develop primary health care protocols for detection, management and referral of patients misusing OTC/prescription drugs and the need to debate the re-scheduling of codeine as a prescription-only substance.

    "18": "Driving under the influence of drugs is a growing problem as the number of apprehended drivers in Norway has increased 2.5 times since 1990. At least two drugs are usually detected. The majority of offenders have been arrested earlier. This paper gives an overview of studies of impaired drivers.", 
    "19": "The re-arrest rate among 1102 drivers under the influence of drugs was followed for 7.5 years and compared with a group of 850 drivers under the influence of alcohol. Another study included 874 drivers with benzodiazepine detections followed retrospectively for 11 years. Earlier arrests and drugs detected first time were recorded. The third study recorded deaths among drugged (n = 918) and drunken (n = 2531) drivers for 7.5 years, compared with same age group in the general population.", 
    "20": "57% of drugged and 28% of drunken drivers were re-arrested. More the 60% of drivers with benzodiazepine detections had been arrested earlier. Alcohol was most the commonly detected substance at first arrest. The standardised mortality ratio for male drugged drivers was 18.1 (14.9-21.8), for drunken drivers 3.7 (2.9-4.7).", 
    "21": "Our results show that drugged drivers represent risk groups with multi-drug use, frequent re-arrests and early death. Other efforts combined with fines, prison and withdrawal of driving licence should be considered. Some countries have follow-up programmes that include control of drug use by urine testing before a re-issue of the driving licence is considered.", 
    "22": "Levels of ionotropic glutamate (Glu) N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), and kainic acid (KA) receptors in rat forebrain regions were compared by quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography after continuous treatment for 28 days with the atypical antipsychotics olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine, or vehicle controls. All three treatments significantly decreased NMDA binding in caudate-putamen (CPu; by 30, 34, and 26%, respectively) but increased AMPA receptor levels in same region (by 22, 30, and 28%). Olanzapine and risperidone, but not quetiapine, also reduced NMDA receptor labeling in hippocampal CA1 (21 and 19%) and CA3 (23 and 22%) regions. KA receptors were unaltered by any treatment in the brain regions examined. These findings suggest that the antipsychotic effects of olanzapine and risperidone may be mediated in part by NMDA receptors in hippocampus, and perhaps AMPA receptors in CPu. The findings also support the hypothesis that down-regulation of NMDA receptors by atypical antipsychotic agents in CPu contributes to their low risk of extra-pyramidal side effects. Inability of olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine to alter KA receptors suggests their minimal role in mediating the central nervous system actions of these drugs.", 
    "23": "The brain damaging effects of ethanol, as the most disabling component of the fetal alcohol syndrome FAS), have been recognized for 3 decades, but the mechanism underlying these effects has remained elusive. Recently, we discovered that ethanol triggers widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration throughout the developing brain when administered to infant rodents during the period of synaptogenesis, also known as the brain growth spurt period. These findings provide a more likely explanation than has heretofore been available for the reduced brain mass and lifelong neurobehavioral disturbances associated with the human FAS. We propose that a dual mechanism - blockade of NMDA glutamate receptors and hyperactivation of GABA(A) receptors - mediates ethanol's apoptogenic action, based on established evidence that ethanol has both NMDA antagonist and GABAmimetic properties, and our recent finding that other drugs with either NMDA antagonist or GABAmimetic properties robustly trigger apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing brain. The brain growth spurt occurs in different species at different times relative to birth. In rats and mice it is a postnatal event, but in humans it extends from the sixth month of gestation to several years after birth. Thus, there is a period in pre and postnatal human development, lasting for several years, during which immature CNS neurons are prone to commit suicide if exposed to intoxicating concentrations of drugs with NMDA antagonist or GABAmimetic properties. These findings are important, not only because of their relevance to the FAS, but because there are many agents in the human environment, other than ethanol, that have NMDA antagonist or GABAmimetic properties. Such agents include drugs that may be abused by pregnant mothers [ethanol, phencyclidine (angel dust), ketamine (Special K), nitrous oxide (laughing gas), barbiturates, benzodiazepines], and many medicinals used in obstetric and pediatric neurology (anticonvulsants), and anesthesiology (all general anesthetics are either NMDA antagonists or GABAmimetics).",

    "26": "Three of the 26 subjects (all in PIR group) did not complete one year of the study: one child at day 8 who inadvertently received 2.0% PIR as the first concentration, due to accommodative insufficiency, one child for follicular conjunctivitis at 9 months, and one child for administrative reasons at month 1. Other than the child discontinued at day 8, all patients were titrated up to the highest concentration of PIR evaluated. When measured 1 hour after instillation of PIR 0.5%, there was a mean mydriatic effect of less than 1 mm compared to vehicle in either bright or dim light. With increasing concentrations of PIR, this effect became numerically larger, although still remained less than 1 mm in either bright or dim light. Measured approximately 12 hours after instillation, there was little mydriasis within each group (relative to baseline) or between treatments. Similar mild PIR effects were seen on accommodative amplitude. In general, the adverse events reported were mild or moderate in severity, resolved rapidly, and were of the nature and incidence to be expected in a study of a topical anti-muscarinic gel in children of this age.",

    "28": "Diazepam inhibits different isoforms of the enzyme cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and also potentiates the inotropic effect of endogenous catecholamines in rat heart. In the present study we have examined whether this late effect is the consequence of inhibition of a phosphodiesterase subtype or whether inhibition of several phosphodiesterase subtypes is involved. We compared the effect of diazepam with that of the selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterase1 (MIMX), phosphodiesterase2 (EHNA), phosphodiesterase3 (milrinone) and phosphodiesterase4 (rolipram) on the inotropic effect of noradrenaline in rat ventricle. Both rolipram or diazepam were equipotent and more effective than milrinone in potentiating the inotropic effect of noradrenaline whereas EHNA and MIMX had no effect. The results suggest that the diazepam induced potentiation of the contractile effect of noradrenaline is due principally to inhibition of phosphodiesterase4 isoenzyme activity.",

Each patient was followed for 1 year before and 1 year after initiation of therapy. Multivariate analysis was used to control for a wide range of factors (drug choice, patient demographics, pre-utilisation costs, region, health conditions, and treatment patterns) that may influence schizophrenia-related costs and total healthcare costs.

    "34": "First generation antipsychotics induce extrapyramidal motor symptoms (EPS), presumably through dopamine D(2) receptor blockade at the dorsal striatum. This may also produce impairment of cognitive processes, such as procedural learning, that are dependent on this region. Haloperidol and, to a lesser extent, risperidone, are active in the dorsal striatum and may induce EPS and impairment of procedural learning. In contrast, the prototypical second-generation antipsychotic, clozapine, is less active in the dorsal striatum and does not induce EPS or impair procedural learning.

    "39": "Previous cardiac electrophysiologic studies of blockers of the slowly activating delayed rectifier (IKs) current have focused primarily on ventricular repolarization. This report summarizes an extensive in vivo cardiac electrophysiologic profile of four 1,4-benzodiazepine IKs blocker analogues (L-761334, L-763540, L-761710, and L-768673) in dogs. At 3.0 mg/kg intravenously, all four analogues elicited 14.5%-21.4% increases in ventricular refractoriness and 19.2%-22.6% increases in QTc interval. Concomitant 11.1%-13.5% increases in atrial refractoriness were noted with all four analogues. Decreases in sinus heart rate of 8.4%-17.3% were noted with all four compounds. No effects on atrial, His Purkinje, ventricular conduction or atrial and ventricular excitation were observed. One analogue, L-761710, significantly delayed atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction (40.7+/-17.4% increase in atrial-to-His interval) and increased the AV conduction system functional refractory period 19.9+/-6.2%. The lack of effect of the other three 1,4-benzodiazepine IKs blockers on AV nodal function at dosages producing comparable effects on atrial and ventricular refractoriness suggest that the AV nodal effects of L-761710 were unrelated to IKs blockade. These findings indicate IKs plays important roles in both atrial and ventricular refractoriness as well as pacemaker function in the dog heart, suggesting potential utility for IKs blockers in the treatment of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "40": "Implementation of regulations to control the prescribing of benzodiazepines in New York State in 1989 resulted in a 55% decrease in benzodiazepine prescribing, with a concomitant increase in the rates of prescribing older sedative-hypnotic compounds such as butabarbital (30% increase) and meprobamate (125% increase). In a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study, we compared the behavioral and pharmacological effects of triazolam, meprobamate, and butabarbital in 14 recreational drug users. Placebo and three doses each of triazolam, meprobamate, and butabarbital were administered to each subject in a random order. Objective tests (motor performance, concentration) and subjective response questionnaires measured drug effects. Triazolam, meprobamate, and butabarbital showed comparable negative dose-response slopes on the objective measures. On the basis of these objective data, equivalent doses for the three compounds were determined to be as follows: 0.5 mg triazolam = 2,400 mg meprobamate = 400 mg butabarbital. Subjective effects data on equivalent doses show that butabarbital produced the highest peak score on Cole/ARCI Abuse Potential, ARCI Pentobarbital Chlorpromazine Alcohol Group (PCAG), and \"drug strength\" scales. Triazolam and butabarbital produced equivalent results on ARCI Morphine Benzedrine Group (MBG), Cole/ARCI Euphoria, and \"drug liking\" scales. Meprobamate was indistinguishable from placebo on euphoria and abuse potential scales. Behavioral economics analysis indicated a price crossover point two times higher for butabarbital (400 mg) than for any other drug condition. These data indicate a comparative abuse liability of butabarbital > triazolam > or = meprobamate, suggesting that the prescribing restrictions on benzodiazepines had little net benefit on abuse risk in the population and may have increased the risk of overdose morbidity and mortality.",

A double-blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study was performed to assess the comparative pharmacodynamics of single doses of temazepam (15 and 30 mg), diphenhydramine (50 and 75 mg), and valerian (400 and 800 mg) in 14 healthy elderly volunteers (mean age, 71.6 years; range, 65-89). Assessments were made at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours postdosing with use of validated measures of subjective sedation and mood (visual analogue scales, Tufts University Benzodiazepine scale) and psychomotor performance (manual tracking and digit symbol substitution tests). Temazepam had dose-dependent effects on sedation and psychomotor ability with a distinct time course. Temazepam 30 mg had the most detrimental effect on psychomotor ability (p < 0.001 compared with all other treatments). Temazepam 30 mg and both doses of diphenhydramine elicited significantly greater sedation than placebo (p < 0.05, all), and temazepam had the greatest effect. There was no difference in sedation scores between 50 and 75 mg diphenhydramine. Sedative effects were slightly lesser with 15 mg temazepam and were not significant in comparison with placebo. Psychomotor impairment was evident after administration of 75 mg diphenhydramine in comparison with placebo on the manual tracking test (p < 0.05); this was less than the impairment with 30 mg temazepam (p < 0.001) but similar to that with 15 mg temazepam (NS). No psychomotor impairment was detected with 50 mg diphenhydramine. Valerian was not different from placebo on any measure of psychomotor performance or sedation.", 
    "42": "This pooled analysis evaluated potential predictive abilities of baseline demographic factors, psychiatric history, and DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for short- and long-term outcome after treatment with venlafaxine extended release (XR) or placebo in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Pooled data from 1,839 patients in five placebo-controlled studies of venlafaxine XR for GAD were analyzed by logistic regression. Odds ratios (ORs) were used to quantify pretreatment factors' abilities to predict response (50% reduction, baseline Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety [HAM-A] severity) and remission (total HAM-A score </=7) following venlafaxine XR or placebo treatment. All analyzed factors showed statistically significant outcome associations after 8 or 24 weeks of treatment, or both, in placebo- or venlafaxine-XR-treated patients or both. Substance abuse history, DSM-IV diagnostic criteria of sleep disturbances, difficulty concentrating, and restlessness had the strongest associations with outcome. Sleep disturbances predicted significant positive response in both groups, but more so in the placebo group. Restlessness consistently predicted poor response and lack of remission with either treatment; difficulty concentrating predicted short-term remission with placebo only. Substance abuse history predicted positive outcomes with placebo only. Sex, age, depression history, panic disorder history, prior benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine use, being easily fatigued, muscle tension, and irritability were modestly outcome-predictive or showed treatment condition interactions. In the largest pooled analysis to date, pretreatment factors were associated with treatment outcome in patients with GAD receiving venlafaxine XR or placebo. The strongest trends emerged for history of substance abuse or dependence and symptoms of restlessness, sleep disturbance, and difficulty concentrating.",

Multiple regression analysis showed that the decrease of BIS following administration of myorelaxant was significantly correlated to BIS and electromyographic baseline values. Using standard BIS range guidelines, the number of patients under light or deep sedation versus general anesthesia or deep hypnotic state was markedly overestimated before administration of myorelaxant (53 vs. 2%, P < 0.001).",

    "66": "The selective manipulation of the expression and replication of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) within mammalian cells has proven difficult. In progressing towards this goal we synthesized a novel mitochondria-targeted DNA-alkylating reagent. The active alkylating moiety [(11aS)-8-hydroxy-7-methoxy-1,2,3,11a-tetrahydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepin-5-one (DC-81)], irreversibly alkylates guanine bases in DNA (with a preference for AGA triplets), preventing its expression and replication. To target this compound to mitochondria it was covalently coupled to the lipophilic triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation to form a derivative referred to as mitoDC-81. Incorporation of this lipophilic cation led to the rapid uptake of mitoDC-81 by mitochondria, driven by the large membrane potential across the inner membrane. This compound efficiently alkylated isolated supercoiled, relaxed-circular or linear plasmid DNA and isolated mtDNA. However mitoDC-81 did not alkylate mtDNA within isolated mitochondria or cells, even though it accessed the mitochondrial matrix at concentrations up to 100-fold higher than those required to alkylate isolated DNA. This surprising finding suggests that mtDNA within intact mitochondria may not be accessible to this class of alkylating reagent. This inability to alkylate mtDNA in situ has significant implications for the design of therapies for mtDNA diseases and for studies on the packaging, expression and turnover of mtDNA in general.",

    "68": "1. Benzodiazepines (BZ) have been reported to protect against ethanol-induced gastric damage in rats in both in vivo and in vitro models. However, the effects of some drugs in the new in vitro model do not agree with results reported previously in in vivo studies. 2. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to modify the new in vitro model to a model that more closely resembles the in vivo model and, using the new in vitro model, to reassess the gastroprotective effects of some BZ and to assess the effects of some new compounds. 3. The rat stomach was isolated from the whole animal and kept in aerated Krebs' solution at 37 degrees C in an organ bath. Gastric mucosal damage was induced by instillation of 1 mL of 100% ethanol into the stomach. Drugs or their vehicle were administered inside the bath 15 min before ethanol instillation into the stomach. One hour after the instillation of ethanol, the stomach was removed from the organ bath, opened along the greater curvature and then examined for gastric mucosal damage. 4. The results indicate that, compared with vehicle pretreatment, ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner by pretreatment with clonazepam, a drug that acts as an agonist at central BZ sites of the GABAA receptor, and Ro 15-4513, a partial inverse agonist at BZ sites of the GABAA receptor. Flumazenil (an antagonist of central BZ sites of the GABAA receptor) did not affect gastric mucosal lesions provoked by ethanol. However, flumazenil significantly reversed the mucosal protective effects of clonazepam and Ro 15-4513. 5. CGS 9896 (a partial agonist at BZ sites of the GABAA receptor, with anxiolytic and anticonvulsant but no sedative effects) did not offer any protection against ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage. Ro 5-3663, an atypical BZ that binds to the picrotoxin site of the GABAA receptor and reported to be a potent convulsant and only a weak antagonist of GABA, did not show any protection against the development of lesions. 6. The results suggest local gastric mediation of the effects of ethanol, as well as the gastric protective effects of BZ, through an action at local central-type BZ sites of the GABAA receptor located in the rat stomach.",

The traditional course of treatment for many patients with schizophrenia is the drug haloperidol. However, research has shown that some ethnic groups (African Americans and Mexican Americans) may respond better to atypical drugs, such as olanzapine, but may be less likely to receive these drugs.

However, alcohol can also trigger seizures unrelated to withdrawal, impair seizure control in epilepsy, and has the potential to induce epilepsy. Approximately one third of patients being hospitalized for acute seizures have overused alcohol prior to the seizure. The clinical diagnosis is based on a thorough medical history. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) provides a reliable measure of drinking habits. Carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) is the best biomarker for alcohol abuse available and a good supplement to the clinical investigation. The diagnostic value of EEG is limited.",

After a withdrawal seizure, prophylactic medication should be restricted to the first few days: In co-existing epilepsy and alcohol abuse, anti-epileptic drugs should be used with caution. There is little evidence to support the general advice that well-controlled epilepsy patients need to abstain completely from alcohol.", 
    "86": "The review defines status epilepticus and discusses treatment options for convulsive and nonconvulsive status epilepticus. The drug of choice in Norway is diazepam intravenously (0.25 mg/kg), followed by phosphenytoin or sodium valproate intravenously and barbiturate narcosis. Other treatment options are discussed. Underlying causes must be addressed for therapeutic intervention. Given early treatment, the prognosis is generally good.",

Uncertainty exists regarding which AEDs are the most teratogenic. Valproate and carbamazepine have been associated with neural tube defects and phenytoin with cleft lip/palate and heart and urogenital defects. All women taking valproate and carbamazepine are advised to take 4 mg/day of folic acid at least one month before pregnancy and during the first trimester. Other women with epilepsy in fertile age are recommended to take 0.4 mg/day. Vitamin K 10 mg/day should be given the last 4 weeks to women on liver enzyme-inducing AEDs. During pregnancy, ultrasound should be performed around weeks 12 and 17. Amniocentesis for a-fetoprotein should be offered at week 15 to women using valproate and carbamazepine. Most women with epilepsy do not experience any change in seizure frequency during pregnancy and have normal vaginal deliveries. Use of monotherapy, lowest effective dose and retard formulations of AEDs, are advised during pregnancy. A seizure during labour is very rare, seen in 1-2 % of cases. Breast-feeding is encouraged for most AEDs, although barbiturates and benzodiazepines may have sedative effects on the infant. Pregnancy is generally safe in women with epilepsy, but preconception counselling and close collaboration during the pregnancy between the gynaecologist and the neurologist is warranted.", 
    "88": "Drug testing is widely used and employed in diverse contexts, including drug treatment clinics. Building on previous research, this paper aims to (i) compare self-report data and oral fluid (OMT) testing in detecting drug use amongst individuals beginning a new episode of drug treatment and (ii) identify factors that may predict drug users who have discordant self-report and OMT test results. Two hundred and seventy-one new drug treatment clients completed a structured questionnaire that included questions relating to drug use during the preceding 3 days and provided an oral fluid sample that was independently tested for opiates, benzodiazepines, methadone and cannabis. Data were analysed using kappa statistics (Cohen, 1960) and univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Findings indicated a high level of consistency between self-reported drug use and OMT testing. However, agreement varied by drug type and respondents commonly reported consumption that screening failed to identify. Inconsistencies appeared to relate to a number of factors and were not necessarily a function of deliberate distortion by the drug user. Overall, it is concluded that OMT testing is a good indicator of the validity and reliability of drug users' self-report data. Nonetheless, its accuracy might be greater for some drug categories than for others. Equally, further study comparing test results and self-reported drug use amongst different populations and in different contexts is required.", 
    "89": "To assess the possible implication of the allosteric coupling of different modulatory sites at the GABA-A receptor complex in hepatic encephalopathy (HE), we investigated in autopsied frontal cortex of six cirrhotic patients and six appropriately-matched controls, the modulatory effects of the benzodiazepine site agonist flunitrazepam on the binding of [3H]muscimol and the effect of the neurosteroid site agonist allopregnanolone (5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one) on the binding of [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam. There were no significant differences in either the magnitude E(max): 11.5+/-1.1% (controls) versus 10.2+/-2.2% (HE patients) or the efficacy EC(50): 20.2+/-5.5 nM (controls) versus 17.7+/-6.2 nM (HE patients) of flunitrazepam modulation of [3H]muscimol binding. Allopregnanolone also showed modulation of both sites to a comparable extent in brain tissue from cirrhotic patients and controls E(max): [3H]muscimol, 15.1+/-2.8% (controls) versus 13.8+/-1.9% (HE patients); [3H]flunitrazepam, 17.9+/-2.3% (controls) versus 19.1+/-2.3% (HE patients), EC(50): [3H]muscimol, 386.5+/-25.8 nM (controls) versus 373.8+/-13.1 nM (HE patients); [3H]flunitrazepam, 49.8+/-22.9 nM (controls) versus 55.5+/-14.0 nM (HE patients). These findings demonstrate unequivocally that the GABA-A sites and their benzodiazepine and neurosteroid modulatory sites manifest normal allosteric coupling in brain in human HE. Therefore, if increased \"GABAergic tone\" is implicated in the pathophysiology of HE, this must be the consequence of increased brain concentrations of endogenous benzodiazepine and/or neurosteroid ligands for components of the GABA-A receptor complex rather than alterations of the receptor proteins themselves.", 
    "90": "A strong linkage between adrenergic and glutamatergic systems exists in the CNS but it is still unclear whether the excessive release of noradrenaline under ischemic conditions is modulated by excitatory amino acids. We studied the effect of selective glutamate receptor antagonists on the release of [3H]noradrenaline evoked by glucose and oxygen deprivation in hippocampal CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus subregions. The release of glutamate, aspartate and GABA was measured by HPLC. Omission of oxygen and glucose increased the release of [3H]noradrenaline as well as the release of amino acids. Maximum effect on noradrenaline release was observed in CA1 region. The relative increase of the release after 30 min energy deprivation (R(2)) versus the basal release under normal conditions (R(1)), i.e. the R(2)/R(1) ratio was 7.1+/-1.0, 3.87+/-0.4 and 3.26+/-0.27 for CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus, respectively. The [3H]noradrenaline outflow in response to glucose and oxygen deprivation was abolished at low temperature, but not by Ca(2+) removal, suggesting a cytoplasmic release process. In CA1 and CA3 [3H]noradrenaline release was significantly attenuated by MK-801, an NMDA receptor antagonist. The AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI-53784 had no effect in CA3, but partly reduced noradrenaline release in CA1. Our results suggest that ionotropic glutamate receptors seem to be implicated in the massive cytoplasmic release of noradrenaline in CA1 what may contribute to its selective vulnerability.", 
    "91": "Four commonly used immunoassay kits were evaluated for their efficiency in screening for drugs of abuse in whole blood. Six groups of illicit drugs (opiates, cannabinoids, amphetamines, cocain and benzoylecgonine, benzodiazepines, and methadone) were determined by using the homogenous assays ADx and CEDIA DAU and compared with the results produced by means of the inhomogenous assays MTP and Pyxis 24. The measured 86 blood samples were taken from authentic routine analyses between February and September, 2000. Chromatographic confirmation analyses were carried out in all cases (positive and negative immunochemical pretesting). The cutoff levels were retrospectively optimized to reduce false-negative results with priority. Furthermore, false-positive pretests were minimized in order to decrease laboratory work under economical aspects. Specificity and sensitivity were determined for each parameter and assay. For the ADx assay, specificities of 54% (cannabinoids) to 97% (cocaine and metabolite) and sensitivities of about 67% (amphetamine class) to 94% (opiates) were found. The CEDIA assay revealed specificities of 77% (methadone) up to 100% (benzodiazepines) and 75-96% sensitivities for amphetamines and opiates. The MTP immunoassay resulted in specificities of 52% (methadone) to 95% (opiates, cocain, and metabolite) and sensitivities of 92% (amphetamines) up to 100% (methadone). The evaluation of the Pyxis 24 resulted in specificities of 70-96% (benzodiazepines and amphetamines) and sensitivities of 75% (amphetamines) up to 100% (cannabinoids and methadone), respectively. In conclusion, the microtiterplate immunoassays revealed higher sensitivities and have proved to be at an advantage detecting the lowest concentrations of drugs. However, especially for clinical applications in emergency cases with acute intoxications, when screening results are urgently required, homogenic assays such as ADx or Cedia provide preferable alternatives with faster and easier handling.", 
    "92": "Previous studies have observed a correlation of implicit memory with certain electroencephalogram (EEG) measures during anesthesia. Here, we tested the relationship between hypnotic depth determined by computer system (Narcotrend(TM)) and implicit memory in anesthetized patients, assessed by a postoperative reading speed test. Thirty-two patients undergoing laparoscopic herniotomy and 30 age-matched volunteer controls were included the study. All patients received IV midazolam 2-3 mg followed by an induction dose of propofol and remifentanil. The anesthesia was maintained with propofol and remifentanil infusions and cisatracurium. Each patient was exposed to 2 of 4 stories, repeated 6 times. The first story was presented during light to moderate hypnotic EEG stages, and the second story was presented during deep hypnosis. Presentation of stories was balanced between patients and hypnotic stages. The controls listened to the two stories without receiving anesthesia. The reading speed for the previously presented stories and two new stories was measured approximately 7 h later with a computer program. No signs of inadequate anesthesia were observed, and no explicit memories of intraoperative events were revealed by a structured interview. No change of reading speed was observed for words presented during deep hypnotic stages. In contrast, an increased reading speed of 20 ms per word was found for content words (i.e., nouns, verbs, and adjectives), but not for function words (conjunctions, prepositions, and so on), presented during light to moderate hypnotic stages. Increased reading speed for semantically rich content words indicates that anesthetized patients are able to process acoustic information during light and moderate, but not deep, hypnosis.",

Eighty-six children <12 yr of age were enrolled in this observational study. The subjects underwent conscious or deep sedation administered by non-anesthesiologists for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures in four departments in a children's hospital. Sedation medications varied among departments and were not controlled by the study protocol. An independent observer derived a UMSS score at 10-min intervals for 1 h during sedation; personnel administering sedation medications and performing the procedures were blinded to the BIS and UMSS scores. Significant correlation between BIS scores and UMSS scores was found (r = -0.704, P < 0.0001), including in subjects <6 mo of age (n = 6) (r = -0.761, P < 0.001). Poor correlation was found when ketamine or an oral combination of chloral hydrate, hydroxyzine, and meperidine were used for sedation.

The present study describes the characterization of 5,7-dihydroxy-6-methoxyflavone (oroxylin A), one of the major components of the herbal extract. Oroxylin A inhibited [3H]flunitrazepam binding to rat cerebral cortical membrane with a IC(50) value of 1.09+/-0.07 microM. A GABA ratio of 1.09+/-0.04 suggests that oroxylin A interacts as an antagonist at the recognition site. In neuropharmacological studies, oral administration of oroxylin A (3.75-60 mg kg(-1)) did not result in significant changes in animal models routinely employed for benzodiazepine (BD) evaluation. However, oroxylin A selectively abolished the anxiolytic, myorelaxant and motor incoordination, but not the sedative and anticonvulsant effects elicited by diazepam, a BDS agonist.

To analyze whether the one-trial tolerance effect of chlordiazepoxide can be influenced by administration of chlordiazepoxide or buspirone on trial 1, male Wistar rats received an IP injection of vehicle, chlordiazepoxide (8 mg/kg) or buspirone (2.5 mg/kg) 30 min. before testing for 5 min. in the plus-maze (trial 1). Seventy-two hours later, the rats received vehicle or chlordiazepoxide 30 min. before the re-exposure to the plus-maze for 5 min. (trial 2). Groups injected with chlordiazepoxide or buspirone on trial 1 and with chlordiazepoxide on trial 2 showed an anxiolytic effect of chlordiazepoxide on trial 2, as opposed to rats injected with vehicle on trial 1 and with chlordiazepoxide on trial 2. As opposed to previous studies, the present results suggest that the influence of prior experience with the plus-maze on the anxiolytic action of chlordiazepoxide during re-exposure seems to depend critically on the drug state in which trial 1 is experienced. These results are discussed with respect to the hypothesis proposed to explain the phenomenon of one-trial tolerance.", 
    "98": "Farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) are a novel class of anti-cancer agents that competitively inhibit farnesyl protein transferase (FPT), and are currently being developed and tested across a wide range of human cancers. Hematologic malignancies, particularly those of myeloid origin, are reasonable disease targets in that they likely overexpress relevant biologic targets, such as Ras, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), or AKT, that depend upon FPT activity to promote proliferation and survival. Phase I clinical trials using FTIs in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and other myeloid malignancies have been performed, demonstrating enzyme target inhibition, low toxicity, and promising response rates. These findings have prompted further development in phase II trials, in order to clarify the response rate and to identify the actual downstream signal transduction targets that may be modified by these agents. It is anticipated that such information will ultimately define the optimal roles of FTIs in patients with AML and other myeloid disorders, facilitate the incorporation of FTIs into current therapeutic strategies for myeloid malignancies, and provide insight into effective methods of combining FTIs with other signal transduction inhibitors.", 
    "99": "The number of aged individuals is growing, and consequently the demands on resources for cardiac surgery will increase in the elderly. Even in the absence of obvious coexisting diseases, advanced age is always accompanied by a general decline in organ functions, and specifically by changes in structure and function of the heart and vasculature that will ultimately affect cardiovascular performance (e.g. hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, etc.). These alterations have to be taken into account when older patients require anaesthesia for cardiac surgery. Pre-operative examination must be performed carefully to estimate cardiac function as well as dysfunction of other organ systems. Benzodiazepines as well as alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists can be used for pre-medication; induction and maintenance of anaesthesia can be performed as balanced anaesthesia or total intravenous anaesthesia. Essential monitoring should include pulmonary artery catheterization and/or transoesophageal echocardiography. During cardiac surgery the risk for elderly individuals is increased; in particular, the central nervous system is more often compromised in the elderly than in younger patients. However, elderly patients without significant co-morbidity have a mortality rate comparable to that of younger patients.", 
    "100": "In a prospective study, we examined the efficacy of risperidone added-on to mood stabilizers in the acute and continuation treatment of mania over a 12-week period. Patients (n=108) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder, manic or mixed episode requiring treatment with an antipsychotic were recruited. All subjects were on one or two mood stabilizers at the time of initiation of risperidone (range 0.5-4 mg). No other antipsychotic medication or ongoing benzodiazepine therapy was allowed. There was a significant decrease in mean Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores from baseline (27.5+/-7.5) to week 1 (-10.8, P<0.0001), week 3 (-17.7, P<0.0001) and to week 12(-22.6, P<0.0001). When response was defined as > or = 50% reduction in YMRS scores from baseline, 32%, 68% and 90% of patients met criteria at week 1, week 3 and week 12, respectively. Significant decreases in mean 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores from baseline (12.2+/-7.7) to week 3 (-5.7, P<0.0001) and week 12 (-5.7, P<0.0001) were also observed. No significant changes in extrapyramidal symptoms were noted between baseline and endpoint. The mean daily dose of risperidone was 2 mg with a median of 1.8 mg. These findings support the results of the two previous double-blind, randomized trials and indicate that the addition of risperidone to mood stabilizers is a safe and effective treatment for acute and continuation treatment of mania. Risperidone add-on does not induce depressive symptoms and, furthermore, risperidone may have efficacy in treating comorbid depressive symptoms in bipolar patients.", 
    "101": "The mouse W/Wv mutation of the c-Kit receptor causes extensive loss of gastrointestinal interstitial cells of Cajal and vagal intramuscular arrays (IMAs; one of the two putative mechanoreceptors in gastrointestinal smooth muscle). To characterize the behavioral phenotype of the c-Kit mouse and to evaluate the roles of these mechanoreceptors in controlling food intake, meal patterns and daily intakes of W/Wv mice and controls were examined using solid (20-mg pellets) and liquid (Isocal) maintenance diets. After the meal pattern experiments, CCK (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 microg/kg ip) was administered to examine the role of the interstitial cells and vagal IMA mechanoreceptors in relaying peripheral signals of satiety activated by CCK-A receptors, whereas the specificity of the response was assessed with the antagonist devazepide (300 microg/kg ip). On both diets, the W/Wv mice ate smaller meals for shorter durations, with a compensatory increase in meal number, resulting in daily intakes and body weights similar to the controls. After CCK injections, the mutant mice consistently suppressed intake more ( approximately 2x) in 30-min tests, regardless of the test diet (12.5% glucose, chow, pellets, and Isocal). The increased sensitivity of W/Wv mice to CCK reflected an increased potency of the hormone (c-Kit mouse ED50 = 2.4 microg/kg; control ED50 = 6.4 microg/kg) and a shift of the dose-response curve to the left. Devazepide blocked the CCK suppression of ingestion. These results indicate that the selective loss of the interstitial cells and IMAs disrupts short-term feeding of the W/Wv mice by inducing an earlier satiety, possibly by altering gastric accommodation and/or emptying, without affecting the long-term mechanisms controlling overall intake or body weight. The results also suggest that the reduction of interstitial cells and IMAs augments the sensitivity to or increases the efficiency of exogenous CCK.", 
    "102": "Estimation of the quality of the epidural anaesthesia of the patients sedated with Alprazolam and Midazolam in premedication before arthroscopy or arthrotomy of the knee was the goal of our study. Forty six (34 men and 12 women) ASA physical status 1-2 patients were divided into groups depending on the drugs orally applied in premedication (Alprazolam 0.5 mg, n = 29 or Midazolam 15 mg, n = 17) and of the kind of analgesia. The patients subjected to arthroscopy were treated with a single-shot epidural analgesia (n = 38), while those subjected to arthrotomy--with a continuous epidural analgesia (n = 8). 2% Lignocain with addition of Epinephrine and Fentanyl was used in the perioperative analgesia, while 0.25% Bupivacain with addition of Morphine was used in the postoperative period when continuous epidural analgesia was applied. The ISAS, VAS and Ramsey scales were used and the data were analysed with the Kormogolov test. The perioperative sedation in arthroscopy and arthrotomy of the knee is good without any significant differences associated with a kind of the drugs applied. The single-shot epidural anaesthesia is inadequate only during a prolonged arthroscopy of the knee. The postoperative continuous epidural analgesia, expressed in the VAS scale, was inadequate. A level of general satisfaction of the patients of the sedation and analgesia, expressed in the points of the ISAS scale, was satisfactorily good.", 
    "103": "Noradrenergic dysfunction has been implicated in the development of affective disorders. beta-adrenergic receptors (betaARs) mediate the response to norephinephrine, are coupled to the cAMP signaling cascade, supposed to be altered in their density and/or sensitivity in depression, and down regulated in several brain regions after long term treatment with different but not all antidepressants. A recently identified functional polymorphism in the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (G1165C) leading to the amino acid variation Gly389Arg was associated with an enhanced coupling to the stimulatory G(s)-protein and increased adenylyl cyclase activation, disturbances which are often observed in affective disorders. Therefore, we investigated whether this beta(1)AR polymorphism is associated with major depression or with the response to antidepressant treatment in a sample of 259 patients compared to 206 healthy controls. Although we could not detect an association between the beta(1)AR polymorphism and major depression we found a tendency for a relation between CC homozygosity and a better and even faster response to antidepressant treatment in those patients, which were treated with antidepressants affecting directly or indirectly the beta(1)AR system (tricyclic antidepressants, noradrenergic and serotonergic specific agents, selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors) determined by the HAMD and CGI score (P = 0.05). However, after correction for multiple testing (Bonferroni) these results did not remain significant. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that the presence of the C allele might be an indicator for antidepressant treatment response.", 
    "104": "To clarify whether visual hallucinations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are related to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, nocturnal polysomnographic variables were compared between a group with hallucinations (hallucinators, n = 14) and a group without hallucinations (nonhallucinators, n = 8). A multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) was performed on 3 hallucinators, and the content of dreams during daytime REM sleep was investigated. The efficacy of clonazepam, a standard treatment choice for REM sleep behavior disorders, was investigated in 8 hallucinators. Nocturnal polysomnograms of the hallucinators showed a higher amount of stage 1-REM sleep with tonic electromyogram (stage 1-REM) than the nonhallucinators, and the reported occurrences of nocturnal hallucinations corresponded with the periods of stage REM or stage 1-REM in most hallucinators. The frequency of sleep onset REM periods (SOREMP) on the MSLT were pathologically high in the hallucinators, and the content of the dreams during the MSLT period was quite similar to their hallucinations. During clonazepam treatment, the frequency of hallucinatory symptoms decreased in 5 of 8 hallucinators. These results indicate that visual hallucinations in PD are likely to be related to a REM sleep disorder manifested as the appearance of both stage 1-REM during the night and SOREMP in the daytime.", 
    "105": "Previous studies on single fast-twitch fibres from mouse toe muscles have shown marked fatigue-induced changes in the free myoplasmic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i), while mitochondrial [Ca2+] remained unchanged. We have now investigated whether muscle fibres from the legs of mice respond in a similar way. Intact, single fibres were dissected from the soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of adult mice. To measure [Ca2+]i, indo-1 was injected into the isolated fibres. Mitochondrial [Ca2+] was measured using Rhod-2 and confocal laser microscopy. Fatigue was induced by up to 1000 tetanic contractions (70 Hz) given at 2 s intervals. In soleus fibres, there was no significant decrease in tetanic [Ca2+]i at the end of the fatiguing stimulation, whereas tetanic force was significantly reduced by about 30 %. In 10 out of 14 soleus fibres loaded with Rhod-2 and subjected to fatigue, mitochondrial [Ca2+] increased to a maximum after about 50 tetani; this increase was fully reversed within 20 min after the end of stimulation. The force-frequency curve of the non-responding soleus fibres was shifted to higher frequencies compared to that of the responding fibres. In addition, eight out of nine Rhod-2-loaded EDL fibres showed similar changes in mitochondrial [Ca2+] during and after a period of fatiguing stimulation. The stimulation-induced increase in mitochondrial [Ca2+] was reduced when mitochondria were depolarised by application of carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone, whereas it was increased by application of an inhibitor of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange (CGP-37157). In conclusion, isolated slow-twitch muscle fibres show only modest changes in tetanic force and [Ca2+]i during repeated contractions. The increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ does not appear to be essential for activation of mitochondrial ATP production, nor does it cause muscle damage.", 
    "106": "KCNQ1 channels underlie the slow delayed rectifier K+ current, mediate repolarization of cardiac action potentials, and are a potential therapeutic target for treatment of arrhythmia. (E)-(+)-N-[(3R)-2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepin-3-yl]-3-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-propenamide [L-735821 (L-7)] is a potent blocker of KCNQ1 channels. Here we describe the structural determinants of KCNQ1 that are critical for high-affinity block by L-7 using site-directed mutagenesis to alter specific residues and voltage clamp to record channel currents in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Chimeric channels were constructed by combination of regions from L-7-sensitive KCNQ1 and L-7-insensitive KCNQ2 channel subunits. This approach localized the drug interaction site to the pore and S6 domains of KCNQ1. Substitution of single amino acids identified Thr-312 of the pore domain and Ile-337, Phe-339, Phe-340, and Ala-344 of the S6 domain as the most important molecular determinants of channel block. Some mutations also altered the inactivation properties of KCNQ1, but there was no correlation between extent of inactivation and sensitivity to block by L-7. Modeling was used to simulate the docking of L-7 to the KCNQ1 channel pore. The docking was consistent with our experimental data and predicts that L-7 blocks K+ conductance by physically precluding the occupancy of a K+ ion to a pore helix-coordinated site within the central hydrated cavity, a crucial step in ion permeation.", 
    "107": "Detailed cytochrome P450 (P450) inhibition profiles are now required for the registration of novel molecular entities. This method uses combined substrates (phenacetin, diclofenac, S-mephenytoin, bufuralol, and midazolam) with combined recombinant P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4) in an attempt to limit interactions with other more minor P450s and associated reductases. Kinetic analysis of single substrate with single P450 (sP450) yielded apparent Km values of 25, 2, 20, 9, and 3 microM, for CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4, respectively. Combined substrates with combined P450s (cP450) yielded apparent Km values of 65, 4, 19, 7, and 2 microM. Selectivity of the substrates for each P450 isoform was checked. Phenacetin proved to be the least selective substrate. However, the ratio of the various P450s was modified in the final assay such that metabolism of phenacetin by other enzymes was approximately 20% of the metabolism by CYP1A2. IC50 determinations with alpha-naphthoflavone (0.04 microM), sulfaphenazole (0.26 microM), tranylcypromine (9 microM), quinidine (0.02 microM), and ketoconazole (0.01 microM) were similar for sP450 and cP450 enzymes. The assay was further evaluated with 11 literature compounds and 52 in-house new chemical entities, and the data compared with radiometric/fluorescent values. The overall protein level of the assay was reduced from the original starting point, as this led to some artificially high IC50 measurements when compared with existing lower protein assays (radiometric/fluorometric). This method offers high throughput P450 inhibition profiling with potential advantages over current radiometric or fluorometric methods.", 
    "108": "Clinical studies have revealed that plasma concentrations of midazolam after oral administration are greatly increased by coadministration of erythromycin and clarithromycin, whereas azithromycin has little effect on midazolam concentrations. Several macrolide antibiotics are known to be mechanism-based inhibitors of CYP3A, a cytochrome P450 isoform responsible for midazolam hydroxylation. The aim of the present study was to quantitatively predict in vivo drug interactions in humans involving macrolide antibiotics with different inhibitory potencies based on in vitro studies. alpha- and 4-Hydroxylation of midazolam by human liver microsomes were evaluated as CYP3A-mediated metabolic reactions, and the effect of preincubation with macrolides was examined. The hydroxylation of midazolam was inhibited in a time- and concentration-dependent manner following preincubation with macrolides in the presence of NADPH, whereas almost no inhibition was observed without preincubation. The kinetic parameters for enzyme inactivation (K'app and kinact) involved in midazolam alpha-hydroxylation were 12.6 microM and 0.0240 min-1, respectively, for erythromycin, 41.4 microM and 0.0423 min-1, respectively, for clarithromycin, and 623 microM and 0.0158 min-1, respectively, for azithromycin. Similar results were obtained for the 4-hydroxylation pathway. These parameters and the reported pharmacokinetic parameters of midazolam and macrolides were then used to simulate in vivo interactions based on a physiological flow model. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of midazolam after oral administration was predicted to increase 2.9- or 3.0-fold following pretreatment with erythromycin (500 mg t.i.d. for 5 or 6 days, respectively) and 2.1- or 2.5-fold by clarithromycin (250 mg b.i.d. for 5 days or 500 mg b.i.d. for 7 days, respectively), whereas azithromycin (500 mg o.d. for 3 days) was predicted to have little effect on midazolam AUC. These results agreed well with the reported in vivo observations.", 
    "109": "Midazolam, triazolam (TRZ), testosterone, and nifedipine have all been widely used as probes for in vitro metabolism of CYP3A. We used these four substrates to assess the contributions of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 to in vitro biotransformation in human liver microsomes (HLMs) and in recombinant enzymes. Recombinant CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 (rCYP3A4 and rCYP3A5) both produced 1-OH and 4-OH metabolites from midazolam and triazolam, 6 beta-hydroxytestosterone from testosterone, and oxidized nifedipine from nifedipine. Overall, the metabolic activity of CYP3A5 was less than that of CYP3A4. Ketoconazole potently inhibited midazolam, triazolam, testosterone, and nifedipine metabolite formation in HLMs and in rCYP3A4. The inhibitory potency of ketoconazole in rCYP3A5 was about 5- to 19-fold less than rCYP3A4 for all four substrates. In testosterone interaction studies, testosterone inhibited 1-OH-TRZ formation, but significantly activated 4-OH-TRZ formation in HLMs and rCYP3A4 but not in rCYP3A5. Oxidized nifedipine formation was inhibited by testosterone in rCYP3A4. However, in rCYP3A5, testosterone slightly activated oxidized nifedipine formation at lower concentrations, followed by inhibition. Thus, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 both contribute to midazolam, triazolam, testosterone, and nifedipine biotransformation in HLMs, with CYP3A5 being metabolically less active than CYP3A4 in general. Because the inhibitory potency of ketoconazole in rCYP3A5 is substantially less than in rCYP3A4 and HLMs, CYP3A5 is probably less important than CYP3A4 in drug-drug interactions involving ketoconazole and CYP3A substrates.", 
    "110": "This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared the efficacy of venlafaxine XR (75 or 150 mg/d) with diazepam (15 mg/d) over an 8-week treatment period in 540 non-depressed outpatients with generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). At week 8, significant improvements from baseline were observed in the venlafaxine XR, diazepam and placebo groups. Although these improvements were higher in the first two groups than in the placebo group for each of the primary efficacy variables (Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total, HAM-A psychic anxiety factor, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) anxiety sub-scale and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) improvement), there were no statistically significant differences between groups. These non-positive results were thought to be due to the very high placebo response observed in some centres. To understand the variability of the study, a secondary preplanned analysis was performed. This involved sub-dividing the study centres according to their ability to detect a two-point mean difference between diazepam and placebo at week 8 on the HAM-A total score. Centres able to show such a difference were termed verum-sensitive. Improvements from baseline to week 8 in venlafaxine XR-treated patients from verum-sensitive centres were significantly greater than in placebo on each of the primary efficacy measures (P </= 0.05). This suggests that those centres able to detect an anxiolytic effect of diazepam were also able to detect an anxiolytic effect of venlafaxine XR. Significant differences in baseline demographics, rates of adverse event reporting and rates of patient discontinuations were noted between patients enrolled at verum-sensitive and verum-insensitive sites. These results reflect the importance of study centre selection in accurately determining efficacy in placebo-controlled trials.",

EPSCs elicited in pyramidal and fast-spiking cells in layers 2/3 and 5 of the rat motor cortex by extracellular single shock stimulus in the presence of GYKI 53655 and D-2-amino-5-phosphopentanoic resulted in a residual current. This current was not enhanced by cyclothiazide but was blocked by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxalin-2,3-dione and is thought to be mediated by kainate receptors. These kainate receptor-mediated currents displayed a wide range of time courses depending on which pre-synaptic fibres were activated. With paired recordings, unitary EPSCs elicited in pyramidal cells were almost totally blocked by GYKI 53655 and D-2-amino-5-phosphopentanoic. However, when L-transpyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (PDC), a glutamate uptake blocker, was introduced in the bath, the amplitude of kainate receptor-mediated currents, which is resistant to GYKI 53655 and D-2-amino-5-phosphopentanoic, was revealed. The rise and decay time constants of the kainate receptor-mediated currents were identical to control EPSCs. PDC was not required to reveal the kainate receptor-mediated currents elicited in fast-spiking cells which also displayed similar rise and decay time constants to the control EPSCs. Excitatory input onto pyramidal and fast-spiking cells in the neocortex mediated by kainate receptors contributed between 14 and 40% of the total control unitary EPSCs which displayed identical time courses to the AMPA receptor-mediated component of the EPSCs. Post-synaptic kainate receptors at connected pyramidal cell synapses may be located extra-synaptically.",

There are no standard chemotherapeutic regimens and new therapeutic approaches have to be found. We report an open-label, uncontrolled, multicentre phase II trial of lonidamine (LND) and diazepam in 16 patients with GBM at first relapse and a Karnofsky performance status > or = 70. The treatment regimen consisted of LND 450 mg/day and diazepam 15 mg/day orally of every 28-day cycle until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients received a median of three cycles (range, 1-12). No complete or partial response was observed. Therefore, according to the design of the study, no additional patients were enrolled and the trial was closed. Nevertheless, seven stabilizations (50%) were observed. Median time to progression was 8 weeks (range, 5-19 weeks). Median overall survival from recurrence was 15 weeks (range, 14-61 weeks). No grade 3-4 toxicity, except somnolence, was observed and there were no therapy-related deaths. Dose reduction for diazepam due to somnolence (grade III) was performed in 9 patients. The combination of LND and diazepam is well tolerated. LND and diazepam, acting on two distinct mitochondrial sites involved in cellular energy metabolism, may exert a cytostatic effect on tumour growth as shown by the high percentage of stable patients.

    "117": "In the evaluation of Acute Drug Poisoning (ADP) in patients seriously ill with a potentially non-toxic dose of the drug that is theoretically responsible, it is important to insist on anamnesis in the coingestion of other drugs or toxics. Initially attention is given to life support measures, oxygenation, protection of the airway and expanding the volemia. The ECG is a diagnostic tool of the first order in ADPs, above all for tricyclic antidepressants (TAD) and cardio-vascular drugs. In the majority of cases continuous monitoring is usually necessary during the first 12-24 hours. The benzodiazepines do not usually give rise to serious poisoning. The use of flumazenil will be reserved for cases of respiratory depression, deep coma or where the cause is undetermined. They can give rise to convulsions, above all in the case of mixed poisonings with anti-depressants and abstinence syndrome. The TADs have an enormous potential seriousness, as they can cause mortal arrhythmias. The therapeutic range of lithium is very narrow; it can produce signs of basically digestive and neurological toxicity. In the case of poisoning by digoxin, the use of anti-digital anti-bodies will be considered in cases of serious bradyarrhythmias, AV blocks or PCR. Glucagon is the antidote for serious poisoning by beta-blockers and for refractory hypotension in cases of calcioantagonists.", 
    "118": "1 Sulphonated aluminium phthalocyanine (SALPC) photodynamic action induces amylase secretion and permanent calcium oscillation in rat pancreatic acinar cells, because of the activation of phospholipase C or signalling proteins upstream. The aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of muscarinic acetylcholine and cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors. 2 Muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (10 micro M) blocked amylase secretion induced by bethanechol (100 micro M), and CCK(1) receptor antagonist (S)-N-[1-(2-fluorophenyl)-3,4,6,7-tetrahydor-4-oxo-pyrrolo-[3,2,1-jk][1,4] benzodiazepine-3yl]-1H-indole-2-carboxamide (FK480) (1 micro M) blocked amylase secretion induced by CCK (100 pM). 3 Amylase secretion induced by SALPC photodynamic action was not inhibited when atropine and FK480 were present during photodynamic action. However, addition of FK480 1 micro M after initiation of photodynamic action inhibited photodynamic amylase secretion. Bethanechol (10, 100 micro M) added after photodynamic action resulted in a full secretory response. 4 Atropine (10 nM) abolished calcium oscillation induced by bethanechol (5 micro M), and FK480 (10 nM) blocked calcium oscillation induced by CCK (10 pM). 5 Atropine up to 10 micro M was without effect on Ca(2+) oscillation triggered by photodynamic action, but these oscillations were abolished by FK480 (10 nM). FK480 (10 nM) had no effect on calcium oscillations induced by bethanechol (5 micro M). Bethanechol 5 micro M, added after FK480 blockade of photodynamic calcium oscillation, still triggered regular calcium oscillation. 6 It is concluded that SALPC photodynamic action selectively and permanently activates CCK receptor in rat pancreatic acini. Such permanent and selective modulation of signalling proteins has important implications for the treatment of pancreatitis, prion diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders.",

However, benzochlorins bearing alkyl groups with carbon-carbon bonds showed enhanced efficacy compared with the related alkyl ether analogs. A comparative intracellular localization study of the newly synthesized benzochlorins with Rhodamine-123 indicated that the effective photosensitizers localize in mitochondria, and a displacement study with PK11195 showed their partial affinity for the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). Interestingly, compared with the Zn(II) benzochlorin that was found to be quite effective in vivo, the corresponding free-base analog produced less photosensitizing activity and was found to localize in lysosomes. A comparative study with dansyl-proline confirmed the binding of the effective benzochlorins to Site II of human serum albumin (HSA). However, no direct correlation was observed between the binding constant values (to HSA or to PBR) of benzochlorins and their photosensitizing ability.", 
    "123": "A high proportion of people with learning disabilities have epilepsy and often their epilepsy is of an intractable nature. Nurses within the large learning disability institutions are obliged, on a regular basis, to administer rectal diazepam to control these patients' serial seizures. As a result of the \"community care\" initiative, the process of discharging adult people from institutions into care settings in the community is underway. Consequently, and increasingly, the learning disabled are being cared for by non-medical/non-nursing (lay) community home carers who are required to gain a working knowledge of epilepsy as well as a degree of proficiency in the first aid management of seizures and in the use of rectal diazepam. Medical and nursing staff involved in the care of adults with learning disability are now liable to be approached by lay care organisations for appropriate training. This article, therefore, will outline the training programme employed at Gogarburn Hospital to educate lay community care staff in general epilepsy awareness and in the administration of rectal diazepam to adults with learning disability and epilepsy. This programme could be adapted and implemented by colleagues in their own areas.",

In 3 double-blind studies, acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia (N = 311), bipolar mania (N = 201), or dementia (N = 206) were treated with intramuscular (1-3 injections/24 hrs) olanzapine (2.5-10.0 mg), haloperidol (7.5 mg), lorazepam (2.0 mg), or placebo. The Agitation-Calmness Evaluation Scale (ACES; Eli Lilly and Co.) and treatment-emergent adverse events assessed sedation. Across all studies, 1 patient (lorazepam-treated, bipolar) became unarousable. There were no significant between-group differences in ACES scores of deep sleep or unarousable at any time across. Excluding asleep patients, agitation remained significantly more reduced with olanzapine than placebo (P <.05). The incidences of adverse events indicative of sedation were not significantly different with olanzapine versus comparators. For the treatment of acute agitation associated with schizophrenia, bipolar mania, or dementia, intramuscular olanzapine-treated patients experienced no more sedation than haloperidol- or lorazepam-treated patients and experienced distinct calming rather than nonspecific sedation.",

CLB add-on therapy proved to be significantly more effective when concurrent GTC occurred more often than yearly. In the current series, no frank psychotic episodes were elicited among the 61 patients who achieved complete suppression of long-standing complex partial seizures, which was in agreement with previous studies. From these results, we believe that CLB is an effective, safe, and inexpensive medication for add-on therapy in difficult to treat focal epilepsies, especially without concurrent use of conventional benzodiazepine compounds.",

Diazepam was used as a reference compound. WAY 100635 (0.5-1 mg/kg), MP 349 (0.25-0.5 mg/kg), MM 77 (0.03-0.25 mg/kg) and diazepam (2.5-5 mg/kg) significantly increased the number of shocks accepted during experimental sessions in the conflict drinking test. In p-chloroamphetamine-pretreated rats, neither WAY 100635 (1 mg/kg) nor MP 349 (0.25 mg/kg) induced an anticonflict effect, whereas MM 77 (0.06 mg/kg) did produce it. Flumazenil fully blocked the anticonflict effects of WAY 100635 (1 mg/kg) and diazepam (5 mg/kg), and it partly but significantly reduced the anticonflict effects of MP 349 (0.25 mg/kg) and MM 77 (0.06 mg/kg). p-Chloroamphetamine and flumazenil alone were inactive in the conflict drinking test. The present results suggest that, first, the anticonflict effect of the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonists, WAY 100635 and MP 349, but not MM 77, is linked to the presynaptically located 5-HT(1A) receptors, and second, benzodiazepine receptors are indirectly involved in such effects of WAY 100635, MP 349 and MM 77, due maybe to a possible interaction between the 5-HT and the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/benzodiazepine systems.",

Pretreatment with the agonist, Ro5-4864, significantly reduced immobility time 1 h after treatment but not 24 h after it, whereas the antagonist, PK11195, did not interfere with the test parameters. Nevertheless, PK11195 pretreatment inhibited the Ro5-4864 antidepressant-like effect. Animals repeatedly treated with Ro5-4864 had a similar profile of action with no sign of motor impairment or locomotor activation as evaluated in the rota-rod and open-field tests, respectively. Aminoglutethimide pretreatment, which blocks the early step of steroid synthesis, inhibited the antidepressant-like effect of Ro5-4864. The present findings suggest an antidepressant-like profile for the benzodiazepine, Ro5-4864, that seems to involve steroid synthesis as underlying mechanism.",

The mirrored chamber test was the model selected. In this study, anxiogenic-like behavior was induced by pretreatment with m-chlorophenylpiperazine hydrochloride (m-CPP; 1 mg/kg i.p.). For comparative purposes, the effects of an established reference anxiolytic, lorazepam (LOR; 0.025, 0.05 and 0.10 mg/kg i.p.) were also evaluated. Results showed that 2 weeks of repeated treatment with 200, 300 and 400 mg/kg of VPA or, to a lesser extent, 300 and 450 mg/kg i.p. of GVG, antagonized the anxiogenic effects of m-CPP. VPA induced behavioral changes very similar to those produced by lorazepam, i.e., a decrease in the latency time to enter the mirrored chamber and an increase in the time spent in the mirrored chamber. The anxiolytic-like potency of GVG was lower than that of VPA in this test. In conclusion, these data provide additional evidence for the anxiolytic-like effects of VPA and substantiate its role in the treatment of anxiety disorders and in the withdrawal state of ethanol or sedative-hypnotics.",

These exchangers were selected for study because they show opposite responses to cytoplasmic regulatory Ca2+, thereby allowing us to examine the role of this regulatory mechanism in the inhibitory effects of CGP. CGP blocked Na+-Ca2+ exchange current mediated by both transporters with moderate potency (IC50 values = approximately 3-17 microM) compared with other recently reported blockers of Na+-Ca2+ exchange [e.g., 2-[4-[2,5-difluorophenyl) methoxy]phenoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (KB-R7943) and 2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy)phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea (SEA0400)]. Experiments using alpha-chymotrypsin to remove autoregulation of Na+-Ca2+ exchange showed that block by CGP was reduced, suggesting that part of the effects of this drug may require intact ionic regulatory mechanisms. For NCX1.1, the inhibition produced by CGP was greater for outward Na+-Ca2+ exchange currents compared with inward currents. When CALX1.1 was examined, the extent of inhibition was similar for both inward and outward exchange currents. Although the extent and potency of CGP-mediated inhibition of Na+-Ca2+ exchange are less than those observed with SEA0400 and KB-R7943, our data demonstrate that CGP constitutes a novel class of plasmalemmal Na+-Ca2+ exchange inhibitors. Moreover, the widespread use of CGP as a selective mitochondrial Na+-Ca2+ exchange inhibitor should be reconsidered in light of these additional inhibitory effects.", 
    "142": "Previous studies have reported the presence of migrating and dividing neuronal progenitors in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and rostral migratory stream (RMS) of the postnatal mammalian brain. Although the behaviour of these progenitors is thought to be influenced by local signals, the nature and mode of action of the local signals are largely unknown. One of the signalling molecules known to affect the behaviour of embryonic neurons is the neurotransmitter GABA. In order to determine whether GABA affects neuronal progenitors via the activation of specific receptors, we performed cell-attached, whole-cell and gramicidin perforated patch-clamp recordings of progenitors in postnatal mouse brain slices containing either the SVZ or the RMS. Recorded cells displayed a morphology typical of migrating neuronal progenitors had depolarized zero-current resting potentials, and lacked action potentials. A subset of progenitors contained GABA and stained positive for glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD-67) as shown by immunohistochemistry. In addition, every neuronal progenitor responded to GABA via picrotoxin-sensitive GABAA receptor (GABAAR) activation. GABAARs displayed an ATP-dependent rundown and a low sensitivity to Zn2+. GABA responses were sensitive to benzodiazepine agonists, an inverse agonist, as well as a barbiturate agonist. While GABA was hyperpolarizing at the zero-current resting potentials, it was depolarizing at the cell resting potentials estimated from the reversal potential of K+ currents through a cell-attached patch. Thus, our study demonstrates that neuronal progenitors of the SVZ/RMS contain GABA and are depolarized by GABA, which may constitute the basis for a paracrine signal among neuronal progenitors to dynamically regulate their proliferation and/or migration.",

    "150": "Kava pyrones have been sold in Germany as OTC anxiolytics until June 2002, when all preparations with a kava pyrone content of more than 10(-4) of a homeopathic stock solution were withdrawn. Other countries in which kava pyrones have been used as anxiolytics, namely GB and the USA, have not followed suit. Kava pyrone anxiolytics have been positively reviewed by the Cochrane Collaboration; also newer German clinical studies have indicated pharmacological anxiolysis at the recommended doses. To use the first choice of treatment, psychotherapy, for all uncomplicated cases of pathological fear does not appear to be realistic. Current data about kava pyrone toxicity are unclear. Judging from the few well documented cases of kava pyrone hepatotoxicity (appr. 2 out of 36) in Germany and Switzerland, an immunologically mediated idiosyncratic mechanism appears to be most likely, especially at higher doses, whereas a direct toxic mechanism is much less likely. No direct results are available for the incidence of kava pyrone-related adverse drug effects. From spontaneously reported cases the incidences of adverse drug reactions cannot be obtained, a rough estimation indicates the incidence of hepatotoxicity to be comparable to those of benzodiazepines. Taken together, the withdrawal of kava pyrone-based anxiolytics appears to be an ill founded over-reaction given the lack of superior therapeutic alternatives. Neither the case evaluations presented by the BfArM (Bundesamt f\u00fcr Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte = Federal Office for Drugs and Medical Products) nor the complete rejection of proof for therapeutic efficacy of kava pyrone anxiolytics are scientifically well founded.",

Benzodiazepine tranquilizers like the prototypic diazepam are among the most widely used anti-anxiety agents. In addition to their anxiolytic action, they also induce sedation and may impair motor coordination, both of which are undesired side effects when they are used as anxiolytics. Not surprisingly, road traffic accidents may be increased for patients on classical benzodiazepines. In addition, these drugs carry the risk of dependence liability. Benzodiazepines augment the action of the inhibitory neurotransmitter g -aminobutyric acid (GABA) at contact points between two nerve cells called synapses, points at which information is transmitted from one nerve cell to the next. Synaptically released GABA binds to postsynaptic GABAA receptors, thus causing an influx of negatively charged chloride ions into the postsynaptic neuron. This leads to a hyperpolarization and thus functional inhibition of the postsynaptic cell. Benzodiazepines bind to a site on the GABA(A) receptor which is different from the GABA binding site, thus increasing the chloride current. Benzodiazepines like diazepam bind to GABA(A) receptors containing the alpha subunits alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, or alpha 5, most likely in alphabetagamma combinations.",

In a rat microdialysis study, MP349 (like WAY 100635) did not affect 5-HT dialysate level in the prefrontal cortex; however, when given before 8-OH-DPAT, it inhibited the decrease in 5-HT release induced by the 5-HT(1A )agonist. The data demonstrated that MP349 behaved like a functional antagonist of presynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors. The potential anxiolytic activity of MP349 and reference drugs was examined in a conflict drinking test in rats, a plus-maze test in rats and a four-plate test in mice. MP349 and WAY 100635 produced anxiolytic-like effects, though somewhat weaker than those induced by diazepam, and only in the case of diazepam the anxiolytic-like effects were dose-dependent. Moreover, MP349 administered in doses inducing anxiolytic-like effects did not disturb the locomotor activity (open field test) or locomotor coordination (rota-rod test) of rats. These and earlier results indicated that MP349 was an antagonist of 5-HT(1A) receptors which exhibited anxiolytic-like activity in an animal model of anxiety.", 
    "175": "Although midazolam is commonly given orally to infants and small children for premedication, the taste is sometimes unacceptable even when mixed with syrup. We tested the efficacy and safety of oral fentanyl compared with oral midazolam in a randomized open-label study.", 
    "176": "Fifty-one children, aged 12-107 months and weighing 10-25 kg, were randomly assigned to fentanyl or midazolam treatment groups. Midazolam (5 mg) or fentanyl (0.1 mg) was given orally from a small bottle with a small orifice 30 min before transfer to the preoperative holding room. The excitation-sedation conditions of the patients were assessed before and after general anaesthesia.", 
    "177": "The preoperative scores did not differ significantly between the two groups. No major complications were observed in either group. Postoperative vomiting occurred in 5 of 27 (18.5%) patients treated with oral fentanyl and in none of 24 of those treated with midazolam.", 
    "178": "Oral administration of fentanyl 30 min before entrance to the holding room for an operation from a bottle with a small orifice is a premedication option for children between 1 and 8 yr of age.", 
    "179": "Benzodiazepines are known to reduce learning and memory performance, presumably through their facilitation of GABAergic neurotransmission, but the effects of these drugs specifically on memory for emotional material has not been addressed in humans. The effects of a benzodiazepine (triazolam, 0.25 mg) on nonincidental memory for emotional stimuli were assessed in 20 healthy volunteers (10 female). Triazolam reduced the normally facilitative effect of emotion on memory. The drug specifically affected memory for the gist of stimuli while leaving detail memory relatively unaffected. This pattern of performance is similar to that seen in patients with amygdala damage. Results suggest an effect of GABAergic neurotransmission at the level of the amygdala on memory modulation.", 
    "180": "The decision to use psychotropic drugs during pregnancy and lactation must depend upon considerations of teratogenicity, effects on fetal and neonatal behavior and development, and a concern for the health and safety of the mother. Pregnancy itself can exacerbate anxiety symptoms, as well as alter the pharmacokinetics of antianxiety drugs; it thus presents a special problem to the clinician treating anxiety disorder in women. Since almost all psychotropic drugs cross the placenta, the use of medications during pregnancy and lactation requires critical attention to the timing of exposure, dosage, duration of use, and fetal susceptibility. Risk to the mother and fetus can be reduced with a number of simple strategies, including monotherapy with the lowest effective, multiple dose of a drug for the shortest period necessary and avoidance of exposure to Benzodiazepines (BZDs) during the first trimester, since this is when the developing fetus is most vulnerable to the toxic effects of most agents. This literature review highlights information from various sources regarding risks for pregnant and lactating mothers to long acting BZDs, especially Chlordiazepoxide.", 
    "181": "A new nootropic preparation nooglutil (N-(5-oxynicotinoyl)-L-glutamic acid), a positive modulator of AMPA receptors for glutamate, administered intraperitoneally in a dose of 70 mg/kg reduced anxiety of rats in the Vogel conflict test after 24-h withdrawal from chronic diazepam treatment (4 mg/kg intraperitoneally for 45 days). Nooglutil (5 nM-750 microM) had no effect on in vitro binding of (3)H-spiperone in intact rats. Systemic administration of 50 mg/kg nooglutil in vivo increased the dissociation constant and density of D(2)receptors. Increasing the dose to 100 mg/kg abolished this effect. Our findings suggest that nooglutil produces an indirect effect on the brain dopaminergic system under normal and pathological conditions and this effect is probably mediated via the glutamatergic system.", 
    "182": "Denervation of rat phrenic muscle or block of NO-synthase in vivo increased the cross-section area of muscle fibers and decreased membrane resting potential. Oxotremorine prevented the development of denervation-induced or denervation-like (i.e. induced by NO-synthase blockade) membrane depolarization and increase of the cross-sectional area of muscle fibers. Pirenzepine abolished the effects of oxotremorine. It was concluded that non-quantal acetylcholine can be involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle fiber volume via activation of M1 muscarinic receptors followed by NO synthesis."
