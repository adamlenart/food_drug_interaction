Dexmedetomidine--fentanyl decreased more than in the nalbuphine--propofol (systolic blood pressure, p = 0.006; diastolic blood pressure, p = 0.01 and heart rate, p = 0.007). Comparatively, oxygen saturation was greater in the dexmedetomidine--fentanyl group vs. nalbuphine--propofol (p = 0.0001).

However, many drugs in this class cause deleterious metabolic side-effects. Animal models accurately predict metabolic side-effects for SGAs with known clinical metabolic liability. We therefore used preclinical models to evaluate the metabolic side-effects of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance with the novel SGAs asenapine and iloperidone for the first time. Olanzapine was used as a comparator.",

Separate groups of rats were treated with asenapine (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg), iloperidone (1.0 and 10 mg/kg) or olanzapine (1.5 and 15 mg/kg) and tested for insulin resistance with the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (HIEC).",

    "8": "Between January 1995 and December 2011, 47 EBD procedures were performed in 30 patients (8 females and 22 males) with CD. All patients had strictures through which an endoscope could not pass, and symptoms of these strictures included abdominal pain, abdominal fullness, nausea, and/or vomiting. The 47 strictures included 17 anastomotic and 30 de novo strictures. Endoscopy and dilatation were performed under conscious sedation with intravenous diazepam or flunitrazepam. The dilatations were all performed using through-the-scope balloons with diameters from 8 mm to 20 mm on inflation and lengths of 30-80 mm. Each dilatation session consisted of two to four, 3-min multistep inflations of the balloon, repeated at intervals of 1 wk until adequate dilatation (up to 15-20 mm in diameter) was achieved. The follow-up data were collected from medical records and analyzed retrospectively. Primary success was defined as passage of the scope through the stricture after EBD. Long-term outcomes were analyzed focusing on intervention-free survival and surgery-free survival demonstrated by the Kaplan-Meier method. (Intervention-free meant cases in which neither endoscopic balloon re-dilatation nor surgery was needed after the first dilatation during the observation period). The log rank test was used to evaluate the difference in long-term outcomes between anastomotic and de novo stricture cases.", 
    "9": "Primary success was achieved in 44 of the 47 strictures (93.6%). Balloon dilatations failed in 3 cases (6.4%). In 1 case, EBD was a technical failure because the guide-wire could not be passed through the stricture which showed severe adhesion and was a flexural lesion of the intestine. In 2 cases, unexpected perforations occurred immediately after balloon dilatation. Of the 47 treatments, complications occurred in 5 (10.6%). All 5 patients had de novo strictures. One suffered bleeding, two high fever and there were colorectal perforations. One of the patients with a colorectal perforation was treated surgically, the other was managed conservatively. These 2 cases correspond to the two aforementioned EBD failures. Long-term outcomes were evaluated for the 44 successfully-treated strictures after a median follow-up of 26 mo (range, 2-172 mo). During the observation period, re-strictures after EBDs occurred in 26 cases (60.5%). Fourteen of these 26 re-stricture cases underwent EBD again, but in two EBD failed and surgery was ultimately performed in both cases. Twelve of the 26 re-stricture cases were initially treated surgically when the re-strictures occurred. Finally, 30 of the 47 strictures (63.8%) were successfully managed with EBD, allowing surgery to be avoided. Intervention-free survival evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method was 75% at 12 mo, 58% at 24 mo, and 43% at 36 mo. There was no significant difference between the anastomotic strictures (n = 16) and de novo strictures (n = 28) in the intervention-free survival as evaluated by the log-rank test. Surgery-free survival evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method was 90% at 12 mo, 75% at 24 mo, and 53% at 36 mo. The 16 anastomotic strictures were associated with significantly better surgery-free survivals than the 28 de novo strictures (log-rank test: P < 0.05).",

The POR*28 allele (A503V) has been shown to impact on in-vitro CYP-mediated metabolism, including CYP3A isoenzymes. The aim of the present study was to determine the in vivo impact of the POR*28 allele on the pharmacokinetics of the classic CYP3A phenotyping probes midazolam and erythromycin. Whereas midazolam is metabolized by both CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, erythromycin is exclusively oxidized by CYP3A4.",

    "15": "As much as the ideal treatment goal for severe mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia is to prevent or delay the recurrence or relapse of acute episodes, when the patient presents with an acute episode, the goal should be to manage behavioural symptoms, and return to prior levels of symptomatic control. In a serious mental illness, the management of the acutely agitated state may require rapid tranquillisation (RT) to control violent and/or disturbed behaviour when all other methods of de-escalation have failed. Current clinical practice guidelines for emergency interventions in the case of acutely disturbed behaviours favour calming the patient by reducing agitation with mild sedation, but not sleep, to allow continued interaction with the patient, to ensure an accurate diagnosis, and to enable patients to be actively engaged in treatment decisions. Pharmacotherapy is an essential element in RT and the available agents used may be unique and separate from the patient's regular course of treatment, primarily because agents used in RT may not be suitable for long-term treatment due to an unfavourable efficacy and safety profile. Therefore, the choice of pharmacotherapy is essential to achieve an effective RT and a smooth transition to standard care and routine daily life for the patient. Of the available agents for RT, aripiprazole demonstrated a favourable efficacy and safety profile both over the short-term - including in its intramuscular form (IM) - and in the long-term treatment of bipolar I disorder and schizophrenia. The objective of this article is to assess the available clinical data on IM aripiprazole as a treatment option for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours in these conditions and to provide a consensus statement based on the expertise of UK healthcare practitioners in acute treatment units.", 
    "16": "The pathogenesis of antipsychotic-induced disturbances of glucose homeostasis is still unclear. Increased visceral adiposity has been suggested to be a possible mediating mechanism. The aim of this study was to investigate, in an animal model, the differential effects of olanzapine and haloperidol on visceral fat deposition (using magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)) and on critical nodes of the insulin signaling pathway (liver-protein levels of IRS2 (insulin receptor substrate 2), GSK3\u03b1 (glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b1), GSK3\u03b2, GSK3\u03b1-Ser21, GSK3\u03b2-Ser9). To this end, we studied male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with vehicle (n=8), haloperidol (2\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) per day, n=8), or olanzapine (10\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1)per day, n=8), using osmotic minipumps, for 8 weeks. The haloperidol group showed a higher percentage of visceral fat than both the olanzapine group and the vehicle group, whereas there was no difference between the olanzapine and the vehicle group. In terms of insulin signaling pathway, the olanzapine group showed significantly reduced IRS2 levels, reduced phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b1 and increased phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2, whereas there was no difference between the haloperidol and the vehicle group. Our data suggest that different molecular pathways mediate the disturbances of glucose homeostasis induced by haloperidol and olanzapine with a direct effect of olanzapine on the insulin molecular pathway, possibly partly explaining the stronger propensity of olanzapine for adverse effects on glucose regulation when compared with haloperidol in clinical settings.", 
    "17": "Our group previously demonstrated that short-term treatment with a standardized extract of Ginkgo biloba (EGb) changed fear-conditioned memory by modulating gene expression in the hippocampus, amygdaloid complex and prefrontal cortex. Although there are few controlled studies that support the long-term use of EGb for the prevention and/or treatment of memory impairment, the chronic use of Ginkgo is common. This study evaluated the effects of chronic treatment with EGb on the conditioned emotional response, assessed by the suppression of ongoing behavior and in the modulation of gene and protein expression. Male adult Wistar rats were treated over 28days and assigned to five groups (n=10) as follows: positive control (4mgkg(-1) Diazepam), negative control (12% Tween 80), EGb groups (0.5 and 1.0gkg(-1)) and the na\u00efve group. The suppression of the licking response was calculated for each rat in six trials. Our results provide further evidence for the efficacy of EGb on memory. For the first time, we show that long-term treatment with the highest dose of EGb improves the fear memory and suggests that increased cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) mRNA and protein (P<0.001) in the dorsal hippocampus and amygdaloid complex and reduced growth and plasticity-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) (P<0.01) in the hippocampus are involved in this process. The fear memory/treatment-dependent changes observed in our study suggest that EGb might be effective for memory enhancement through its effect on the dorsal hippocampus and amygdaloid complex.", 
    "18": "Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a member of the hypothalamic neuropeptide family that includes urocortins, urotensin I and sauvagine in vertebrates. CRH and urocortin act as anorexigenic factors for satiety regulation in rodents. In a goldfish model, intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of ovine CRH (oCRH) affects not only food intake, but also locomotor activity. However, there is no information regarding the psychophysiological roles of CRH in goldfish. Therefore, we investigated the effect of oCRH on psychomotor activity in this species. ICV administration of synthetic oCRH at 20 pmol/g body weight (BW) enhanced locomotor activity. Since intact goldfish prefer the lower to the upper area of a tank, we developed a method for measuring the time taken for fish to move from the lower to the upper area. ICV administration of oCRH at 20 pmol/g BW and the central-type benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist FG-7142 (an anxiogenic agent) at 1-4 pmol/g BW both increased the time taken to move from the lower to the upper area. This anxiogenic-like effect of oCRH was abolished by the CRH receptor antagonist \u03b1-helical CRH(9-41) (100 pmol/g BW). These results indicate that CRH can potently affect locomotor and psychomotor activities in goldfish.",

A potential confounding factor when assessing analgesic effects of systemically administered drugs using LCEP is sedation. This study aims to clarify: 1) the relation between level of anaesthesia and magnitude of LCEP, 2) the effects of a sedative and an analgesic on LCEP and dominant EEG frequency 3) the effects of a sedative and analgesic on LCEP when dominant EEG frequency is kept stable. LCEP and EEG were recorded in isoflurane/nitrous-oxide anaesthetized rats. Increasing isoflurane level gradually reduced LCEPs and lowered dominant EEG frequencies. Systemic midazolam (10 \u03bcmol/kg) profoundly reduced LCEP (19% of control) and lowered dominant EEG frequency. Similarly, morphine 1 and 3 mg/kg reduced LCEP (39%, 12% of control, respectively) and decreased EEG frequency. When keeping the dominant EEG frequency stable, midazolam caused no significant change of LCEP. Under these premises, morphine at 3 mg/kg, but not 1 mg/kg, caused a significant LCEP reduction (26% of control). In conclusion, the present data indicate that the sedative effects should be accounted for when assessing the analgesic effects of drug. Furthermore, it is suggested that LCEP, given that changes in EEG induced by sedation are compensated for, can provide information about the analgesic properties of systemically administrated drugs.",

Recent studies suggest that agonists targeting selective GABA(A)R subunits may have therapeutic value against the cognitive impairments observed in schizophrenia. In this study, we determined whether GABA(A)R binding deficits exist in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of people with schizophrenia and tested if changes in GABA(A)R binding are related to the changes in subunit mRNAs. The GABA orthosteric and the benzodiazepine allosteric binding sites were assessed autoradiographically using [(3)H]Muscimol and [(3)H]Flumazenil, respectively, in a large cohort of individuals with schizophrenia (n\u200a=\u200a37) and their matched controls (n\u200a=\u200a37).

Expression levels of mRNA subunits measured did not show any significant difference in schizophrenia compared to controls. Regression analysis revealed that in schizophrenia, the [(3)H]Muscimol binding variance was most related to \u03b14 mRNA levels and the [(3)H]Flumazenil binding variance was most related to \u03b32S subunit mRNA levels.

We studied whether the common A118G (rs1799971) mu-opioid receptor single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was associated with overdose severity in humans. In addition, we examined an SNP responsible for alternative splicing of OPRM1 (rs2075572). We assessed allele frequencies of the above SNPs and associations with clinical severity in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute drug overdose. This work was designed as an observational cohort study over a 12-month period at an urban teaching hospital. Participants consisted of consecutive adult ED patients with suspected acute drug overdose for whom discarded blood samples were available for analysis. Specimens were linked with clinical variables (demographics, urine toxicology screens, clinical outcomes) then deidentified prior to genetic SNP analysis. Blinded genotyping was performed after standard DNA purification and whole genome amplification. In-hospital severe outcomes were defined as either respiratory arrest (RA; defined by mechanical ventilation) or cardiac arrest (CA; defined by loss of pulse). We analyzed 179 patients (61% male, median age 32) who overall suffered 15 RAs and four CAs, of whom three died. The 118G allele conferred 5.3-fold increased odds of CA/RA (p<0.05), while the rs2075572 variant allele was not associated with CA/RA.

Here, we demonstrate that a monoclonal anti-LRRK2 antibody directed against the activation segment binds less efficiently to native LRRK2 protein in the presence of ATP-competitive LRRK2 inhibitors. Since kinase inhibitors prevent autophosphorylation and refolding of the activation segment, we hypothesize that the antibody preferentially binds to the active conformation of LRRK2 under native conditions.",

There are 3 possible concentration/dose (C/D) ratios. The clobazam C/D ratio has the potential to measure the contribution of CYP3A4 activity to the clearance of clobazam from the body. The N-desmethylclobazam C/D ratio does not seem to be a good measure of clobazam clearance and should be substituted with the total (clobazam + N-desmethylclobazam) C/D ratio.",

The inverse relationship of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) with cardiovascular disease suggests HDL-C raising therapy as a novel target. This review discusses the role of HDL-C in atherogenesis as well as the promise of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibition in CVD prevention. While genetic studies show conflicting results on correlations between HDL-C and CVD, experimental studies have yielded sufficient encouraging data to proceed with the development of HDL-C raising strategies. CETP inhibition has been shown to successfully increase HDL-C levels in man. However, the first CETP inhibitor tested in phase III trials increased mortality possibly due to torcetrapib-specific vasopressor effects. More recently, dalcetrapib did not show an effect on CVD outcome while raising HDL-C by 30%, thereby refuting the HDL-C hypothesis. Anacetrapib and evacetrapib are currently tested in phase III clinical trials and have not shown adverse effects thus far. Both compounds not only increase HDL-C by 129-151%, they also decrease LDL-C (36-41%) and anacetrapib lowers Lp(a) (17%). Combined, these effects are anticipated to decrease CVD risk and the results will be revealed in 2017.",

To further characterize the structural determinants responsible for helix-helix association of this membrane protein, we now investigate the folding of double transmembrane domains in various detergent micelles. Herein, we present the successful biosynthesis of a double transmembrane domain encompassing the last two C-terminal helices (TM4TM5). For optimal production of this domain in Escherichia coli, the evaluation of various peptide constructs, including TM4TM5 fused to different purification tags or to solubilizing proteins, was necessary. The protocol of production of TM4TM5 with more than 95% purity is reported. This domain was further characterized using circular dichroism and solution state NMR. Far-UV circular dichroism studies indicate that the secondary structure of TM4TM5 is highly helical when solubilized in various detergent micelles including n-dodecyl-\u03b2-d-maltoside, n-octyl-\u03b2-d-glucoside, n-dodecylphosphocholine, 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DHPC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol). In addition, the solubilization conditions of the domain were optimized for NMR experiments, and preliminary analysis indicates that TM4TM5 adopts a stable tertiary fold within the TM4TM5-DHPC complex.",

We assessed seasonal variation, habituation to the test, and the impact of gender and age on exploration. Furthermore, we monitored exploration following intraperitoneal diazepam, 8-OH-DPAT and caffeine administration. Parameters measured were latency to start exploring the outside of the cage, the percentage of rats that explored the outside, as well as the number of visits.", 
    "59": "There was no seasonal variability in free exploratory behaviour. However, strains and sexes differed in the test results, though age-related differences had less impact. Diazepam (2mg/kg) and 8-OH-DPAT (30, 100 and 300\u03bcg/kg) decreased neophobia while caffeine (50mg/kg) increased the latency to explore the outside the next day.",

    "61": "Piperine, an alkaloid present in the Piper genus, was shown to have an anticonvulsant activity, evaluated by the pilocarpine-induced model, in mice. Pilocarpine (350mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 30min after piperine (2.5, 5, 10 and 20mg/kg, i.p.) which significantly increased latencies to 1st convulsion and to death, and percentage of survivals. These parameters were also increased in the pilocarpine groups pretreated with atropine plus piperine (10 and 2.5mg/kg, respectively), as related to the pilocarpine group. However, they were not altered in the pilocarpine groups pretreated with memantine (a NMDA-type glutamate receptors blocker, 2mg/kg, p.o.) or nimodipine (a calcium channel blocker, 10mg/kg, p.o.), both associated with piperine (1 or 2.5mg/kg), as compared to the piperine plus pilocarpine group. Moreover, the pilocarpine group pretreated with diazepam (which binds to the GABAA receptor, 0.2 and 0.5mg/kg, i.p.) plus piperine (1 and 2.5mg/kg) significantly increased latency to the 1st convulsion, as related to the pilocarpine group, suggesting that the GABAergic system is involved with the piperine action. Furthermore, the piperine effect was blocked by flumazenil (2mg/kg, i.p.), a benzodiazepine antagonist. Untreated P350 animals showed decreased striatal DA and increased DOPAC and HVA levels that were not affected in the piperine plus pilocarpine groups. Piperine increased striatal levels of GABA, glycine and taurine, and reversed pilocarpine-induced increases in nitrite contents in sera and brain. Hippocampi from the untreated pilocarpine group showed an increased number of TNF-\u03b1 immunostained cells in all areas, as opposed to the pilocarpine group pretreated with piperine. Taken together, piperine anticonvulsant effects are the result of its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions, as well as TNF-\u03b1 reduction. In addition, piperine effects on inhibitory amino acids and on the GABAergic system may certainly contribute to the drug anticonvulsant activity.", 
    "62": "The positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) pentagonal (PM) and Van der Gaag (VDG) 5-factor models were compared on a range of change-over-time statistical indicators. PANSS data from a randomized, controlled trial for 108 adults diagnosed with schizophrenia were re-analyzed to calculate five factor scores for each model. Random effects regression was used to determine their relative performance in modeling change-over-time, determining covariance structure, and achieving goodness of fit. Performance of the 10 factors in estimating change-over-time was similar, as were significant covariates for the factor dyads: age, gender, chronicity/acuity, and anticholinergic medication. The PM model factors demonstrated the best \"goodness of model fit\" to the data on all five of the factor dyads. Correlation analyses indicated significantly high, positive correlations between the five factor dyads: Positive and Negative factors for the PM and VDG models, the PM Activation and VDG Excited factors, the PM Dysphoric Mood and the VDG emotional distress factors, and the PM Autistic Preoccupation and the VDG Disorganized factors, although the PANSS items on each factor differed somewhat. These results extend previous findings and indicate several important performance differences between the PM and VDG models in their parsimonious representation of the syndromes of schizophrenia and estimating change-over-time.",

Clinical symptom severity such as PDSS and BDI scores showed positive correlation with GM volumes in the PD+D group. Of the highlighted regions, the left posterior cingulate gyrus demonstrated both a GM volume difference between the groups and a positive correlation of GM volume with symptom severity in the PD+D group. Fractional anisotropy values were significantly higher across almost all the WM tracts in the PD+D group compared to the PD-D group.",

Two patients with \"moderate\" leaks received four injections and in both a lumbar drain also was positioned. In the other two patients, three (in this case a lumbar drain was used) and two injections were performed, respectively. We managed the patient with severe leaking by performing an injection five times, and lumbar drainage was placed.

    "71": "Long-term treatment with glucocorticoids results in many adverse effects. Prevention of osteoporosis is well codified, but prevention of other adverse effects is not. If there is some consensus on the prevention of glucocorticoid-induced adverse events, there are also many habits since interventional studies are lacking. A low caloric and low carbohydrate diet as well as a regular physical training are certainly necessary to avoid lipodystrophy, weight gain and diabetes mellitus. Some patients benefit from the repeated intervention of a dietetic or nutrition specialist. Physical training is often neglected though it is efficacious to limit severity of glucocorticoid-induced myopathy and probably to reduce vascular risk. Low sodium intake has no effect on lipodystrophy and its efficacy to prevent hypertension is doubtful. Benzodiazepines may be useful against anxiety, insomnia and nervousness when these symptoms are cumbersome. Anti-ulcer drugs are generally not indicated because glucocorticoids are not ulcerogenic. Hypokaliemia rarely occurs, so we prefer controlling serum potassium level 1 and 3 months after glucocorticoid initiation rather than systematically prescribe potassium supplementation. Patients on glucocorticoids are at increased risk for cardiovascular events. Due to the lack of studies specific to patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy, the rules for the prescription of statins are the same as in the general population. There is no known prevention for cutaneous atrophy. However, use of adhesive tape should be strictly avoided when skin atrophy is severe. Prevention of infections is developed elsewhere.",

    "86": "We present a full-length \u03b1(1)\u03b2(2)\u03b3(2) GABA receptor model optimized for agonists and benzodiazepine (BZD) allosteric modulators. We propose binding hypotheses for the agonists GABA, muscimol and THIP and for the allosteric modulator diazepam (DZP). The receptor model is primarily based on the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) from C. elegans and includes additional structural information from the prokaryotic ligand-gated ion channel ELIC in a few regions. Available mutational data of the binding sites are well explained by the model and the proposed ligand binding poses. We suggest a GABA binding mode similar to the binding mode of glutamate in the GluCl X-ray structure. Key interactions are predicted with residues \u03b1(1)R66, \u03b2(2)T202, \u03b1(1)T129, \u03b2(2)E155, \u03b2(2)Y205 and the backbone of \u03b2(2)S156. Muscimol is predicted to bind similarly, however, with minor differences rationalized with quantum mechanical energy calculations. Muscimol key interactions are predicted to be \u03b1(1)R66, \u03b2(2)T202, \u03b1(1)T129, \u03b2(2)E155, \u03b2(2)Y205 and \u03b2(2)F200. Furthermore, we argue that a water molecule could mediate further interactions between muscimol and the backbone of \u03b2(2)S156 and \u03b2(2)Y157. DZP is predicted to bind with interactions comparable to those of the agonists in the orthosteric site. The carbonyl group of DZP is predicted to interact with two threonines \u03b1(1)T206 and \u03b3(2)T142, similar to the acidic moiety of GABA. The chlorine atom of DZP is placed near the important \u03b1(1)H101 and the N-methyl group near \u03b1(1)Y159, \u03b1(1)T206, and \u03b1(1)Y209.

    "87": "Benzodiazepines and neuroactive steroids act at distinct binding sites on \u03b3-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptors where they positively modulate GABA, resulting in similar acute behavioral effects. Tolerance to benzodiazepines can develop with repeated treatment; however, cross tolerance to neuroactive steroids does not develop, perhaps due to conformational changes in benzodiazepine, and not neuroactive steroid, binding sites. Three monkeys discriminated 0.178 mg/kg midazolam while responding under a fixed-ratio 10 schedule of stimulus-shock termination. On separate occasions, dose-effect curves for midazolam and pregnanolone were determined when monkeys had not received chlordiazepoxide and when they received 10 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide 46 hours earlier; for some tests, flumazenil was given before determination of dose-effect curves. Midazolam and pregnanolone produced \u226580% midazolam-lever responding. When administered 46 h before sessions, chlordiazepoxide did not produce pregnanolone-lever responding; under those treatment conditions, midazolam dose-effect curves were shifted 2.8-fold rightward and pregnanolone dose-effect curves were not changed. Flumazenil antagonized midazolam; Schild (linear) analyses yielded slopes that were not different from unity and pA(2) values of 7.46 when monkeys had not received chlordiazepoxide and 7.44 when they received chlordiazepoxide 46 h earlier. Flumazenil did not alter the effects of pregnanolone in chlordiazepoxide-treated monkeys. Thus, interactions between flumazenil and midazolam were not qualitatively or quantitatively changed in monkeys acutely tolerant to chlordiazepoxide, suggesting that mechanisms other than alterations of benzodiazepine binding sites account for the development of acute tolerance.",

    "92": "Galanthamine and physostigmine are clinically used cholinomimetics that both inhibit acetylcholinesterase and also interact directly with and potentiate nAChRs. As with most nAChR-positive allosteric modulators, the location and number of their binding site(s) within nAChRs are unknown. In this study, we use the intrinsic photoreactivities of [(3)H]physostigmine and [(3)H]galanthamine upon irradiation at 312 nm to directly identify amino acids contributing to their binding sites in the Torpedo californica nAChR. Protein sequencing of fragments isolated from proteolytic digests of [(3)H]physostigmine- or [(3)H]galanthamine-photolabeled nAChR establish that, in the presence of agonist (carbamylcholine), both drugs photolabeled amino acids on the complementary (non-\u03b1) surface of the transmitter binding sites (\u03b3Tyr-111/\u03b3Tyr-117/\u03b4Tyr172). They also photolabeled \u03b4Tyr-212 at the \u03b4-\u03b2 subunit interface and \u03b3Tyr-105 in the vestibule of the ion channel, with photolabeling of both residues enhanced in the presence of agonist. Furthermore, [(3)H]physostigmine photolabeling of \u03b3Tyr-111, \u03b3Tyr-117, \u03b4Tyr-212, and \u03b3Tyr-105 was inhibited in the presence of nonradioactive galanthamine. The locations of the photolabeled amino acids in the nAChR structure and the results of computational docking studies provide evidence that, in the presence of agonist, physostigmine and galanthamine bind to at least three distinct sites in the nAChR extracellular domain: at the \u03b1-\u03b3 interface (1) in the entry to the transmitter binding site and (2) in the vestibule of the ion channel near the level of the transmitter binding site, and at the \u03b4-\u03b2 interface (3) in a location equivalent to the benzodiazepine binding site in GABA(A) receptors.",

The mechanisms underlying the abuse-related effects of benzodiazepines are not well understood, although \u03b11 subunit-containing GABAA receptors have been proposed to have a critical role. Here, we examine the reinforcing effects of several compounds that vary with respect to intrinsic efficacy at \u03b12, \u03b13, and \u03b15 subunit-containing GABAA receptors but lack efficacy at \u03b11 subunit-containing GABAA receptors ('\u03b11-sparing compounds'): MRK-623 (functional selectivity for \u03b12/\u03b13 subunit-containing receptors), TPA023B (functional selectivity for \u03b12/\u03b13/\u03b15 subunit-containing receptors), and TP003 (functional selectivity for \u03b13 subunit-containing receptors). The reinforcing effects of the \u03b11-sparing compounds were compared with those of the non-selective benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist MRK-696, and non-selective benzodiazepine receptor full agonists, midazolam and lorazepam, in rhesus monkeys trained to self-administer midazolam or cocaine, under a progressive-ratio schedule of intravenous (i.v.) drug injection. The \u03b11-sparing compounds were self-administered significantly above vehicle levels in monkeys maintained under a midazolam baseline, but not under a cocaine baseline over the dose ranges tested. Importantly, TP003 had significant reinforcing effects, albeit at lower levels of self-administration than non-selective benzodiazepine receptor agonists. Together, these results suggest that \u03b11 subunit-containing GABAA receptors may have a role in the reinforcing effects of benzodiazepine-type compounds in monkeys with a history of stimulant self-administration, whereas \u03b13 subunit-containing GABAA receptors may be important mediators of the reinforcing effects of benzodiazepine-type compounds in animals with a history of sedative-anxiolytic/benzodiazepine self-administration.",

    "100": "Our objective was to determine the presence of psychoactive substances in blood of drivers killed in road crashes in four European countries. Data from 1118 drivers of car and vans, killed between 2006 and 2009, were collected in Finland, Norway, Portugal and Sweden. The prevalence of any psychoactive substance ranged between 31 and 48%. Alcohol (\u2265\u00a00.1 g/L) was the most common finding, 87% had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC)\u00a0\u2265\u00a0.5 g/L. Benzodiazepines (1.8-13.3%) and amphetamines (0-7.4%) were the most prevalent psychoactive medicines and illicit drugs, respectively. Alcohol-drug and drug-drug combinations were rather prevalent. Differences in alcohol/drug findings seemed to reflect differences in use in the countries. More research should be done to develop preventive strategies to reduce the number of alcohol- and drug-related traffic accidents targeting at-risk groups, such as drivers with very high BACs and novice drivers.", 
    "101": "Networks of brain regions having synchronized fluctuations of the blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) time-series at rest, or \"resting state networks\" (RSNs), are emerging as a basis for understanding intrinsic brain activity. RSNs are topographically consistent with activity-related networks subserving sensory, motor, and cognitive processes, and studying their spontaneous fluctuations following acute drug challenge may provide a way to understand better the neuroanatomical substrates of drug action. The present within-subject double-blind study used BOLD fMRI at 3T to investigate the functional networks influenced by the non-benzodiazepine hypnotic zolpidem (Ambien). Zolpidem is a positive modulator of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptors, and engenders sedative effects that may be explained in part by how it modulates intrinsic brain activity. Healthy participants (n=12) underwent fMRI scanning 45 min after acute oral administration of zolpidem (0, 5, 10, or 20mg), and changes in BOLD signal were measured while participants gazed at a static fixation point (i.e., at rest). Data were analyzed using group independent component analysis (ICA) with dual regression and results indicated that compared to placebo, the highest dose of zolpidem increased functional connectivity within a number of sensory, motor, and limbic networks. These results are consistent with previous studies showing an increase in functional connectivity at rest following administration of the positive GABA(A) receptor modulators midazolam and alcohol, and suggest that investigating how zolpidem modulates intrinsic brain activity may have implications for understanding the etiology of its powerful sedative effects.",

Benzodiazepines may be effective in reducing pain by minimizing anxiety associated with dressing changes. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adjunctive midazolam during dressing changes in patients with uncontrolled pain using opioid monotherapy or significant anxiety associated with dressing changes. A retrospective cohort analysis comparing patients who received midazolam during dressing changes with control patients was performed. Each midazolam patient was matched with up to two control patients who did not receive midazolam on the basis of age, sex, TBSA burned, and grafting requirement. The primary endpoint was the oral morphine equivalents required during admission after initiation of midazolam. Thirty-six patients were included for evaluation (14 midazolam and 22 control patients). Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups, although patients in the midazolam group had higher pain scores and oral morphine equivalent requirements at baseline. When adjusted for baseline pain, day postburn, age, sex, and grafting status, total oral morphine equivalents and mean pain scores during admission were similar between the groups. One midazolam patient experienced oxygen desaturation with midazolam, but did not require flumazenil for reversal. The use of midazolam during burn dressing changes in patients with poorly controlled pain and/or anxiety was not associated with reduced requirements for oral morphine equivalents or lower pain scores during admission.

DC-81, an antitumor antibiotic produced by Streptomyces species, belongs to pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD), which is a potent inhibitor of nucleic acid synthesis. An enediyne contains either DNA intercalating groups or DNA minor groove binding functions and these are potent DNA-damaging agents due to their ability to generate benzenoid diradicals. We have previously reported an efficient synthesis and antitumor activity of a series of novel PBD hybrids linked with enediyne. The purpose of this study was to examine the mechanism of the antiproliferative effect of DC-81-enediyne agent on human melanoma A375 cells. DC-81-enediyne induced an increase in Ca(2+) level and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation as detected by flow cytometric assay. Western blot analysis showed that DC-81-enediyne induced the phosphorylation of p38 and activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2). By using the luciferase reporter assay, activating protein-1 (AP-1) activity was further enhanced after A375 cells were treated with graded concentrations of DC-81-enediyne. DC-81-enediyne treatment-induced A375 cell apoptosis was significantly abrogated by the addition of Ca(2+), ROS, and p38 inhibitors. Collectively, our studies indicate that DC-81-enediyne induces A375 cell apoptosis through an increased Ca(2+) and ROS generation, which involves p38 phosphorylation and enhanced ATF-2/AP-1 expressions, leading to caspase-3 activity, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase cleavage, M30 CytoDeath staining, and subsequent apoptotic cell death.",

The distribution of these analytes in cardiac muscle (CM), vitreous humour (VH), femoral blood (FB) and cardiac blood (CB) is also reported. In rectus femoris muscle, the spatial distribution of the analytes was examined across the whole rectus femoris muscle collected from seven fatalities in which cocaine was detected. In six of these cases, death was attributed to trauma and in one case the cause of death was undetermined but suspected to be drug related. In two additional cases analytes were detected in the blood and/or VH but not in the muscle. The muscle was sectioned into 12-15 approximately equal segments, each of which was analysed after homogenisation. Tissue and bio-fluid samples were extracted by solid phase extraction with confirmation and quantification by GC-ion trap-MS/MS. No significant variation was observed in the concentration of any analyte throughout the muscle in the 7 cases analysed. The results reported here are in contrast to a previous study in which great variation in the concentration of some basic drugs (mainly tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines) was observed throughout the thigh muscle bulk (Williams and Pounder, 1997). Analyte concentrations in skeletal muscle (SM) correlated well with those in FB (p<0.01). In general, the concentration of cocaine and COET followed the order VH > CM > SM > FB \u2265 CB. Cocaine concentrations measured in VH were significantly higher than in blood and muscle. Inter-matrix variations in the concentrations of BZE and COET were less marked. The concentration of BZE exceeded that of cocaine in all matrices and in all cases except one where the time between death and drug intake was suspected to be short. In this case, the cocaine to BZE ratio measured in SM (2.66), CM (2.91) and VH (2.19) was higher than that measured in FB (0.97). Given that the concentrations of cocaine and its metabolites were uniformly distributed throughout the muscle and considering the good correlation observed between muscle and blood, muscle could be of interpretive value in cocaine related deaths. Further, since cocaine is known to have greater post-mortem stability in muscle than blood, concentrations measured in muscle may reflect more closely those at the time of death and might be of particular value in cases with an extended period between death and tissue sampling.",

At 10 days of life, LL and HL chicks were intraperitoneally injected with insulin, epinephrine or saline, and immediately after stressed by partial water immersion for 15 min and killed by decapitation. Forebrains were dissected and the GABA(A) receptor density was measured ex vivo by the (3)[H]-flunitrazepam binding assay in synaptosomes. In non-stressed chicks, insulin (non-hypoglycemic dose) at 2.50 IU/kg of body weight incremented the Bmax by 40.53% in the HL chicks compared to saline group whereas no significant differences were observed between individuals in the LL subpopulation. Additionally, insulin increased the Bmax (23.48%) in the HL group with respect to the LL ones, indicating that the insulin responses were different according to the anxiety of each category. Epinephrine administration (0.25 and 0.50mg/kg) incremented the Bmax in non-stressed chicks, in the LL group by about 37% and 33%, respectively, compared to ones injected with saline. In the stressed chicks, 0.25mg/kg bw epinephrine increased the Bmax significantly in the HL group by about 24% compared to saline, suggesting that the effect of epinephrine was only observed in the HL group under acute stress conditions. Similarly, the same epinephrine doses co-administered with insulin increased the receptor density in both subpopulations and also showed that the highest dose of epinephrine did not further increase the maximum density of GABA(A)R in HL chicks. These results suggest that systemic epinephrine, perhaps by evoking central norepinephrine release, modulated the increase in the forebrain GABA(A) receptor recruitment induced by both insulin and stress in different ways depending on the subpopulation fearfulness.",

Anaesthesia may interfere with research results through side-effects on the nervous system, such as memory impairment. It is known that ketamine and midazolam affect cognition; however, their effects have not been clarified when used in a context of balanced anaesthesia. Thus, this study evaluated the effects of ketamine/midazolam on the acquisition of motor and of a spatial memory task in adult mice. Twenty-eight C57BL/6 adult male mice were divided into three groups: untreated control, treated with ketamine/midazolam (75 mg/kg / 10 mg/kg) and treated with midazolam (10 mg/kg) groups. Respiratory rate, heart rate and systolic pressure were measured every 5 min in the animals treated with ketamine/midazolam, as this was the only group that exhibited loss of the righting reflex. One day after treatment, animals were tested in the open field, rotarod and radial arm maze. There were no differences between treatments regarding open-field activity, rotarod performance or number of working and reference memory errors in the radial arm maze task. In conclusion, the learning process of spatial and motor tasks was not disrupted by the anaesthetic combination of ketamine/midazolam. These results suggest its safe use in adult mice in projects where acquisition of a spatial and motor task is necessary.",

ODN, which is produced by astrocytes, is an endogenous ligand for both central-type benzodiazepine receptors (CBR) and a metabotropic receptor. Incubation of neurons with subnanomolar concentrations of ODN (10\u207b\u00b9\u2078 to 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 M) inhibited 6-OHDA-evoked cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect of ODN on neuronal survival was abrogated by the metabotropic receptor antagonist, cyclo\u2081\u208b\u2088 [DLeu\u2075]OP, but not by a CBR antagonist. ODN stimulated polyphosphoinositide turnover and ERK phosphorylation in CGN. The protective effect of ODN against 6-OHDA toxicity involved the phospholipase C/ERK MAPK transduction cascade. 6-OHDA treatment induced an accumulation of reactive oxygen species, an increase of the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene Bax, a drop of the mitochondrial membrane potential and a stimulation of caspase-3 activity. Exposure of 6-OHDA-treated cells to ODN blocked all the deleterious effects of the toxin. Taken together, these data demonstrate for the first time that ODN is a neuroprotective agent that prevents 6-OHDA-induced oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death.",

To search an appropriate evaluation methodology for the intestinal first-pass metabolism of new drug candidates, grapefruit juice (GFJ)- and vehicle (tap water)-pretreated mice or rats were orally administered midazolam (MDZ) or triazolam (TRZ), and blood levels of the parent compounds and their metabolites were measured by liquid chromatography/MS/MS. A significant effect of GFJ to elevate the blood levels was observed only for TRZ in mice. 2. In vitro experiments using mouse, rat and human intestinal and hepatic microsomal fractions demonstrated that GFJ suppressed the intestinal microsomal oxidation of MDZ and especially TRZ. Substrate inhibition by MDZ caused reduction in 1'-hydroxylation but not 4-hydroxylation in both intestinal and hepatic microsomal fractions. The kinetic profiles of MDZ oxidation and the substrate inhibition in mouse intestinal and hepatic microsomal fractions were very similar to those in human microsomes but were different from those in rat microsomes. Furthermore, MDZ caused mechanism-based inactivation of cytochrome P450 3A-dependent TRZ 1'-hydroxylation in mouse, rat and human intestinal microsomes with similar potencies. 3.

Suppression of hippocampal theta frequency has been shown to be a reliable neurophysiological signature of anxiolytic drug action in tests using known anxiolytic drugs (i.e., correlational evidence), but only one study to date (Yeung et al. (2012) Neuropharmacology 62:155-160) has shown that a drug with no known effect on either hippocampal theta or anxiety can in fact separately suppress hippocampal theta and anxiety in behavioral tests (i.e., prima facie evidence). Here, we attempt a further critical test of the hippocampal theta model by performing intrahippocampal administrations of the Ih blocker ZD7288, which is known to disrupt theta frequency subthreshold oscillations and resonance at the membrane level but is not known to have anxiolytic action. Intrahippocampal microinfusions of ZD7288 at high (15 \u00b5g), but not low (1 \u00b5g) doses slowed brainstem-evoked hippocampal theta responses in the urethane anesthetized rat, and more importantly, promoted anxiolytic action in freely behaving rats in the elevated plus maze.

Further, NS9283 did not affect the rate of desensitization of ACh-evoked currents, was incapable of reactivating desensitized receptors and only moderately slowed recovery from desensitization. However, NS9283 strongly decreased the rate of deactivation kinetics and also modestly decreased the rate of activation.

Previous studies have demonstrated an influence of clozapine, but not haloperidol, on neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression in the hypothalamus. Because NPY is a potent orexigenic peptide stimulating food intake, and genetic variation of the gene has been shown to influence development of obesity, we investigated the impact of NPY polymorphisms on antipsychotic-induced BWG.We analyzed 5 polymorphisms in the NPY gene (rs10551063, rs16147, rs5573, rs5574, and rs16475) in schizophrenia subjects (n = 226), treated mostly with clozapine and olanzapine for up to 14 weeks. Association was tested using analysis of covariance with change (%) from baseline weight as the dependent variable and duration of treatment and baseline body weight as covariates.In patients of European ancestry who received either clozapine or olanzapine, significant genotypic and allelic association of rs16147 with weight change was observed (P(corrected) = 0.012 and 0.018, respectively). Carriers of the C allele gained significantly more weight compared with individuals with TT genotype (CC + CT vs TT; 5.82% \u00b1 5.6% vs 2.25% \u00b1 4.8%; P= 0.001). Similarly, 2 other polymorphisms (rs5573 and rs5574) were also significantly associated with weight change (P(corrected) = 0.018 and 0.03). In addition, we observed a significant gene-gene interaction between the rs16147 in NPY and rs806378 in cannabinoid receptor 1 (P(corrected) = 0.011).Our observation of association of NPY polymorphisms gives further evidence for a genetic influence on antipsychotic-induced BWG and suggests a role of NPY gene in influencing this complex adverse effect.",

We used a simplified reference tissue model to generate parametric images of [F]MPPF-binding potential (BPND). A significant reduction of [F]MPPF BPND was found in treated schizophrenic patients compared to age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. These modifications were mainly localized in the frontal and orbitofrontal cortex and may reflect either the pathophysiology of schizophrenia or medication effects. The schizophrenic patients treated with aripiprazole showed a reduction of global [F]MPPF BPND compared with healthy subjects and schizophrenic patients with SGA treatment. In addition, compared with matched controls, the reduction of regional [F]MPPF BPND was more marked in the schizophrenic patients treated with aripiprazole compared with those receiving SGA treatment, possibly reflecting the partial agonist of aripiprazole activity at 5-HT1A receptors.",

Olanzapine was the most tested alternative to clozapine with most of the studies reporting positive outcome, especially in patients with less severe illness and those who stop clozapine for reasons other than poor response.

Furthermore, therapy with continuous positive airway pressure devices (CPAP) has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of serious cardiovascular consequences. Interactions between OSAS and the cardiovascular system (CVS) can eventually result mainly in coronary atherosclerosis. These two conditions are connected by a complex biomarkers network. An extensive overview of these pathways could be helpful to better understand the causes of cardiovascular impairment in patients with OSAS.",

They may have fewer side effects than GABA(B) receptor agonists, because selective enhancement of activated receptors could have effects different from nonselective activation of all receptors. To examine this, pigeons were trained to discriminate the GABA(B) receptor-positive modulator (R,S)-5,7-di-tert-butyl-3-hydroxy-3-trifluoromethyl-3H-benzofuran-2-one (rac-BHFF) from its vehicle. The discriminative stimulus effects of rac-BHFF were not mimicked by the GABA(B) receptor agonists baclofen and \u03b3-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), not by diazepam, and not by alcohol, cocaine, and nicotine, whose self-administration has been reported to be attenuated by GABA(B) receptor-positive modulators. The discriminative stimulus effects of rac-BHFF were not antagonized by the GABA(B) receptor antagonist 3-aminopropyl (diethoxymethyl)phosphinic acid (CGP35348) but were attenuated by the less efficacious GABA(B) receptor-positive modulator 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-(3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethylpropyl)phenol (CGP7930), suggesting the possibility that rac-BHFF produces its discriminative stimulus effects by directly activating GABA(B2) subunits of GABA(B) receptors. At a dose 10-fold lower than the training dose, rac-BHFF enhanced the discriminative stimulus effects of baclofen, but not of GHB. This study provides evidence that the effects of GABA(B) receptor-positive modulators are not identical to those of GABA(B) receptor agonists. In addition, the results suggest that positive modulation of GABA(B) receptors does not produce discriminative stimulus effects similar to those of benzodiazepines, alcohol, cocaine, and nicotine. Finally, the finding that rac-BHFF enhanced effects of baclofen but not of GHB is consistent with converging evidence that the populations of GABA(B) receptors mediating the effects of baclofen and GHB are not identical.",

Mitragynine, an euphoric compound was evaluated for its effects on the expression of mRNAs encoding CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 and protein expression and resultant enzymatic activity. The mRNA and protein expression of CYP450 isoforms were carried out using an optimized multiplex qRT-PCR assay and Western blot analysis. CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 enzyme activities were evaluated using P450-Glo\u2122 assays. The effects of mitragynine on human CYP3A4 protein expression were determined using an optimized hCYP3A4-HepG2 cell-based assay. An in silico computational method to predict the binding conformation of mitragynine to the active site of the CYP3A4 enzyme was performed and further validated using in vitro CYP3A4 inhibition assays. Mitragynine was found to induce mRNA and protein expression of CYP1A2. For the highest concentration of 25 \u03bcM, induction of mRNA was approximately 70% that of the positive control and was consistent with the increased CYP1A2 enzymatic activity. Thus, mitragynine is a significant in vitro CYP1A2 inducer. However, it appeared to be a weak CYP3A4 inducer at the transcriptional level and a weak CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitor. It is therefore, unlikely to have any significant clinical effects on CYP3A4 activity.",

We investigated this issue using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a method that non-invasively increases/decreases cortical activity.

We used a bifrontal setup - anode and cathode over the left and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), respectively. The probabilistic classification-learning (PCL) task was administered before and during tDCS. The percentage of correct responses improved during sham; although not during active tDCS. Procedural or implicit learning acquisition between tasks also occurred only for sham. We discuss whether DLPFC activation decreased activity in subcortical structures due to the depressive state. The deactivation of the right DLPFC by cathodal tDCS can also account for our results. To conclude, active bifrontal tDCS prevented implicit learning in depressive patients. Further studies with different tDCS montages and in other samples are necessary.",

In all cases, the administration of antipsychotics has been suspended as soon as fever and autonomic disturbances occurred. A supportive therapy was initiated to stabilize general conditions, then every patient started electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in combination with benzodiazepines (BDZ). The risk of complications was reduced by the quick adoption of supportive care, whereas the combination of ECT and BDZ was effective in resolving the clinical picture. These cases may provide further support to the hypothesis that catatonia and NMS are disorders pertaining to the same spectrum of illness because the onset or exacerbation of catatonic symptoms coincided with the administration of antipsychotics. Our experience confirms the efficacy and safety of ECT in combination with BDZ as treatment of NMS and residual catatonia.",

The present study reports on the dispensing and wasting of 15 controlled substances (CS) at two health care facilities in Albany, NY over a nearly two year period. The study considered measures of ecotoxicity, drug metabolism, excretion and disposal of these CS. Potential alternatives to flushing of CS into wastewaters from healthcare facilities are discussed. Drug medication and waste collection records (12,345) included: numbers of drugs dispensed, returned and wasted. Overall, 8528 g of 15 CS were wasted. Three (midazolam, acetaminophen-codeine and fentanyl) accounted for 87.5% of the total wasted. Wasting varied by hospital, 14 CS at the academic medical center hospital and 8 at the surgical care center were wasted. Liquids were more frequently wasted than tablets or pills. Some combination drugs (acetaminophen (APAP)-codeine) were frequently (50% of drug dispensed) wasted while others were less wasted (APAP-hydrocodone-6.3%; APAP-oxycodone-1.3%). The 8 CS judged more hazardous to aquatic life were: APAP-codeine, APAP-hydrocodone, APAP-oxycodone, alprazolam, diazepam, fentanyl, midazolam, and testosterone. Ketamine, morphine, oxycodone and zolpidem were of lesser acute toxicity based on available LC50 values. These CS might provide a therapeutically equivalent alternative to the more environmentally harmful drugs. In health care facilities, professionals dispose of CS by bedside wasting into water or other receptacles. This can be avoided by returning CS to the hospital's pharmacy department, thence to a licensed distributor. Study of this process of drug wasting can identify opportunities for process improvements. We found 3 CS (APAP-codeine, midazolam and testosterone) where \u00bd to 1/3 of the drug was wasted and 5 others with 30 to 13% wasted. Knowledge of the adverse impacts from the release of highly toxic drugs into the environment might influence CS selection and disposal alternatives.",

The presence of delirium resulted in longer lengths of SICU and hospital stays [6 days (3-13) vs. 2 days (1-3), p\u2009<\u20090.001 and 26 days (12-39) vs. 6 days (3-13), p <0.001, respectively], as well as higher hospital and SICU mortality rates [16.3% vs. 4.0%, p\u2009=\u20090.004 and 6.5% vs. 1.7%, p\u2009=\u20090.042, respectively]. The risk factors for delirium were age (odds ratio (OR), 1.04 [1.02-1.07]), Acute Physiologic Score (APS; OR, 1.11 [1.04-1.2]), emergency surgery (OR, 8.05 [3.58-18.06]), the use of benzodiazepines (OR, 2.28 [1.04-5.00]), and trauma (OR, 6.16 [4.1-6.5]).",

    "191": "Insomnia is a sleep trouble in which the patient has difficulties in falling or in staying asleep. There are patients who fall asleep easily, but wake up too early; others have troubles in falling asleep and a third category has troubles with both falling and staying asleep. Independent of the type of insomnia, the final result is a poor-quality sleep, responsible for depressive or irritable mood, loss in concentration, learning and memory capacities. Sleep is essential to emotional and physical health. Inadequate sleep over a period of time is increasing the risks for obesity, diabetes, heart disease and depression. People suffering of chronic insomnia show an increased predisposition for psychiatric problems. People who had sleep troubles reported impaired ability to fulfill tasks involving memory, learning, logical reasoning and mathematical operations. New studies show that insomnia might be a result of the decrease of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurochemical responsible for the decrease of activity in many brain areas. Lower brain GABA levels were also found in people with major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. Hypnotics, such as benzodiazepines are acting increasing the activity of the GABA neurons. Exposure to stress is associated with a greater risk for insomnia, with individual differences. Stress activates the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Increased activity of HPA axis is stimulating the secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone, further inducing sleep disruption. Insomnia is also associated with depression and anxiety disorders, in which the HPA axis is characteristically overactive. People who show predisposition to sleep troubles have a hyperactive sympathetic nervous system, they are usually suffering from hyperarousal and they have a more intense response to stressful events. Primary sleep troubles (insomnia) has no apparent causes, is lasting more than one month, and is affecting approximately a quarter of the adult population. Secondary insomnia is associated with chronic heart and/or lung diseases, medication which interfere with onset or duration of sleep, constant change of the sleep habits, restless leg syndrome, etc. Besides lifestyle changes and cogn itive-behavioral therapy, in the treatment of insomnia are used hypnotic medicines, advised to be prescribed on short-term cures of one or two weeks. Benzodiazepines are inducing and maintaining sleep. Longer use is responsible for severe side effects--dependency and withdrawal syndrome, daytime drowsiness and dizziness, low blood pressure, memory troubles and change in the melatonin secretion during night-time period. For these reasons were created non-benzodiazepines hypnotics--zolpidem, zaleplon, which are as effective as benzodiazepines, but have fewer side effects. Nevertheless the use of these hypnotics is also restricted to 7-10 days. Zopiclone (Imovane) another short-acting non-benzodiazepine hypnotic has a different chemical structure, but a pharmacologic profile similar to that of the benzod iazepines; the treatment should be of maximum four weeks. Besides generally known concerns related to the use of hypnotics (residual sedative effects, memory impairment, rebound insomnia, abuse, dose escalation, dependency and withdrawal problems) it was signaled a risk of death associated with the use of current hypnotic medications.", 
    "192": "Spasticity is a velocity-dependent increase in muscle tone and uncontrolled, repetitive, involuntary contractions of skeletal muscles. Spasticity presents as upper motor neuron symptoms in patients with central nervous system pathology such as stroke, spinal cord injury, brain injury, or multiple sclerosis. As a result, a patient can have significant pain and limited mobility, which can lead to decreased quality of life and difficulty maintaining personal care. In this article we discuss mechanisms, indications, efficacy, and side effects of the most accepted current treatments. Currently available treatment options include oral medications and interventional procedures. Oral medications comprise centrally acting agents, such as baclofen, clonidine, and tizanidine, as well as anticonvulsants such as benzodiazepines and gabapentin and peripherally acting dantrolene. Interventional procedures include focal injections of botulinum toxin, phenol or alcohol, and an intrathecal baclofen pump. Surgical treatments include selective dorsal rhizotomy and neurectomy. We found that there are several treatments available with data to support their use, but many still need further research to prove their efficacy and develop optimal utilization.", 
    "193": "A computational approach was applied to screen functional monomers and polymerization solvents for rational design of molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs) as smart adsorbents for solid-phase extraction of clonazepam (CLO) form human serum. The comparison of the computed binding energies of the complexes formed between the template and functional monomers was conducted. The primary computational results were corrected by taking into calculation both the basis set superposition error (BSSE) and the effect of the polymerization solvent using the counterpoise (CP) correction and the polarizable continuum model, respectively. Based on the theoretical calculations, trifluoromethyl acrylic acid (TFMAA) and acrylonitrile (ACN) were found as the best and the worst functional monomers, correspondingly. To test the accuracy of the computational results, three MIPs were synthesized by different functional monomers and their Langmuir-Freundlich (LF) isotherms were studied. The experimental results obtained confirmed the computational results and indicated that the MIP synthesized using TFMAA had the highest affinity for CLO in human serum despite the presence of a vast spectrum of ions.", 
    "194": "Expression and secretion of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) by cultured liver cells can be markedly stimulated by triazolodiazepines (TZDs). It has been shown previously that the thieno-TZD Ro 11-1464 increases plasma levels of apoA-I and in vivomacrophage reverse cholesterol transport in mice. However, these effects were only seen at high doses, at which the compound could act on central benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors or platelet activating factor (PAF) receptors, interfering with its potential utility. In this work, we describe 2 new thieno-TZDs MDCO-3770 and MDCO-3783, both derived from Ro 11-1464. These compounds display the same high efficacy on apoA-I production, metabolic stability, and lack of cytotoxicity in cultured hepatocytes as Ro 11-1464, but they do not bind to the central BZD receptor and PAF receptor. The quinazoline RVX-208 was less efficacious in stimulating apoA-I production and displayed signs of cytotoxicity. Certain TZDs stimulating apoA-I production are now known to be inhibitors of bromodomain (BRD) extra-terminal (BET) proteins BRDT, BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4, and this inhibition was inferred as a main molecular mechanism for their effect on apoA-I expression. We show here that the thieno-TZD (+)-JQ1, a potent BET inhibitor, strongly stimulated apoA-I production in Hep-G2 cells, but that its enantiomer (-)-JQ1, which has no BET inhibitor activity, also showed considerable effect on apoA-I production. MDCO-3770 and MDCO-3783 also inhibited BRD3 and BRD4 in vitro, with potency somewhat below that of (+)-JQ1. We conclude that the effect of thieno-TZDs on apoA-I expression is not due to inhibition of the BZD or PAF receptors and is not completely explained by transcriptional repression by BET proteins.", 
    "195": "Advances in the basic neuroscience of fear conditioning and extinction, as well as in the clinical neuroscience of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), have laid the foundations for research on the pharmacotherapy of PTSD. Clinical trials have ranged from early work on tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines through to more recently introduced antidepressants, and on to a range of other psychotropic agents. Despite the growing database of trials, the area remains a controversial one insofar as key systematic reviews in the field have emphasized the methodological limitations of existing work. Here, we briefly review the existing literature on the pharmacotherapy of PTSD, attempting to highlight key clinical lessons, and important areas for future research.", 
    "196": "Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) is a common and typically long-standing medical condition, characterized by an excessive fear of being observed or evaluated negatively in social or performance situations. Efficacious interventions in acute treatment include cognitive behavioural therapy and a range of medications including many antidepressants, some benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants, and the antipsychotic olanzapine. Most studies report no significant differences in overall efficacy or tolerability between active compounds. Responders to previous acute treatment benefit from continuing active medication for 6 months. Evidence of a dose-response relationship with antidepressant drugs is inconsistent, though only higher doses of pregabalin are efficacious. Switching between treatments with proven efficacy may be helpful. Augmentation of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor with buspirone or clonazepam can be beneficial. It is unlikely that combining pharmacotherapy with psychotherapy results in greater overall efficacy compared to either treatment given alone. Proof-of-concept and other preliminary studies suggest the efficacy of psychotherapy can be enhanced through prior administration of D-cycloserine, cannabidiol, or oxytocin.", 
    "197": "A comprehensive database has developed and precise recommendations can be provided for treating patients with panic disorder. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are standard treatments for panic disorder. Tricyclic antidepressants are as effective as modern antidepressants, but less well tolerated. For short-term treatment and in non-responsive cases, benzodiazepines such as alprazolam may be used when the patient does not have a history of dependency and tolerance. Combining drug treatment with cognitive behaviour therapy is the most successful treatment strategy for panic disorder. This chapter also includes treatment recommendations for pregnant or lactating women, children, adolescents, elderly patients, and patients who are non-responsive to standard treatments.", 
    "198": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is chiefly characterized by a cognitive focus on threats and risks towards the individual and/or the immediate family. It is accompanied by a sense of tension, worry, muscle pain, disturbed sleep and irritability. The condition impairs work capacity, relations, and leisure activities, and aggravates concurrent somatic diseases. Due to its chronic course, GAD increases costs for the individual, the family, and health care services, and reduces work and educational performance. In cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes and neurological diseases, GAD is a risk factor for somatic complications and for lowered adherence to somatic treatments. There is evidence that GAD can be treated with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), and/or with medications. First-line pharmacotherapies are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and pregabalin. If such therapies fail, one may reconsider the diagnosis, question adherence with the prescribed schedule, and determine the adverse influence of comorbidity (such as depression, substance use, and physical ill-health) as well as the influence of social stressors. Second-line pharmacotherapies are largely not supported by controlled trials, and so leave much to clinical judgment and careful monitoring. One may attempt treatments with benzodiazepine anxiolytics, with quetiapine, or with pregabalin as an adjunct therapy in patients with partial response to SSRI or SNRI treatment. CBT is a valid alternative to pharmacotherapy, depending on patient preference."
