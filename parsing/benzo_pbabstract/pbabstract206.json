Materials and Methods.\u2002 The following data were retrospectively sought from 20 nonrandomized failed back surgery patients at two centers treated by a dual quadripolar surgically implanted SCS lead: pain and paresthesia, VAS ratings, medication use, sleep patterns, daily activities, hardware problems, and willingness to repeat the procedure. The data were analyzed by the Wilcoxon signed rank test (p value < 0.05). Results.\u2002 The average paresthesia coverage was 76%. After SCS implantation, analgesic use was decreased in 59% of the patients, sleeping time augmented, and quality of sleep improved. The number of patients taking benzodiazepines decreased. Sixty percent reported increased participation in social activities. Conclusions.\u2002 This dual program surgical SCS technique is simple, respects patients' autonomy, and provides adequate analgesia with an increase in quality of life.", 
    "1": "3alpha-OH-5alpha[beta]-pregnan-20-one (THP) is a positive modulator of the GABAA receptor (GABAR), which underlies its reported anxiolytic effect. However, there are conditions such as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) where increases in THP levels can be associated with adverse mood.", 
    "2": "In order to test for conditions where THP might be anxiogenic, we developed a mouse model of THP withdrawal. Because delta-containing GABAR are highly sensitive to THP modulation, results were compared in wild-type and delta knockout mice.", 
    "3": "Finasteride, a 5alpha-reductase blocker, was administered for 3 days to female wild-type or delta knockout mice. Then, animals were tested in the elevated plus maze, following acute administration of THP, lorazepam, flumazenil, or 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol (THIP), and results compared to vehicle-injected controls. CA1 hippocampal GABAR alpha4 subunit levels were assessed by Western blot.", 
    "4": "After THP withdrawal, THP produced anxiogenic effects, decreasing open arm entries on the elevated plus maze, following a brief shock, in contrast to its expected anxiolytic effects. As we have shown in rats, THP withdrawal also resulted in increased expression of the alpha4 subunit in mouse CA1 hippocampus. As expected for increases in alpha4-containing GABAR, THP withdrawn mice were relatively insensitive to the benzodiazepine (BDZ) lorazepam and had atypical responses to the BDZ antagonist flumazenil when tested on the plus maze. In contrast, they showed a greater anxiolytic response to THIP, which has greater efficacy at alpha4betadelta than other GABAR. Although THP withdrawal in delta knockout mice also increased the alpha4 GABAR subunit, the anxiogenic effects of THP and the anxiolytic effects of THIP were not observed, implicating alpha4betadelta GABAR in these effects.", 
    "5": "Based on these behavioral and pharmacological findings, we suggest that THP withdrawal in the mouse may serve as a rodent model of PMDD.", 
    "6": "We report the clinical and therapeutic features of three patients with an obsessive-compulsive syndrome that emerged during the course of panic disorder. The DSM-IV criteria for panic disorder places central attention on the patient's phobic responses to the panic attacks and their perceived consequences. These phobic responses may develop into a syndrome that closely resembles obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) but typically responds to conventional anti-panic approaches. Our cases suggest that patients with OCD should be probed for an underlying panic disorder. This 'panic disorder-related subtype of OCD' may be associated with an excellent treatment response and increased rates of remission.", 
    "7": "The introduction of second generation antipsychotics (SGA) represents a major advance in the treatment of schizophrenia. Concerns about the metabolic and cardiovascular adverse effects of the SGA have been widely disseminated. The benefits and risks of these drugs have been studied with a focus on particular organ systems. A basic principle of prevention is that the intensity of risk-reduction therapy should be adjusted to a individual's absolute risk. Hence, the first step is to assess an individual's risk status. The present study was designed to evaluate whether there is an added cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in switching schizophrenia patients from typical antipsychotics to the SGA olanzapine. Risk status was determined by a 10-year risk assessment as recommended by the USA National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This was carried out with Framingham scoring to identify individuals whose short-term (10-year) risk warrants consideration of intensive treatment. This risk was calculated for schizophrenia patients who were treated by haloperidol for a minimum period of 6 months and again following 6 months of exposure to olanzapine. Forty-three patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. There were 25 male and 18 female patients (mean age 40.7+/-2.4 years). The mean 10-year percentage risk of CVD for the group while on haloperidol treatment was 4.58+/-0.9 and, after 6 months of exposure to olanzapine, this was reduced to 4.12+/-0.9. Changes in the total risk and each evaluated risk variable were not statistically significant, except for a decrease in resting systolic blood pressure. Switching schizophrenia patients from typical antipsychotic treatment to olanzapine is safe and does not increase the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "8": "Mast cells play a protective role in the inflammation and auto-tissue injury. The impairment of mast cell function may influence defense against infection. We investigated the effect of four IV anesthetics (thiopental, midazolam, ketamine, and propofol) on the chemotaxis and exocytosis of mast cells. Canine mast cell chemotaxis was measured by the Boyden's blindwell chamber technique using 100 microg/mL of substance P as a stimulator. We measured mast cell exocytosis by measuring released histamine from mast cells using substance P or gamma-monomeric IgG-mediated crosslinking as a stimulator. Thiopental, midazolam, and propofol exerted a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on mast cell chemotaxis. Ketamine, midazolam, and propofol had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on mast cell exocytosis. In conclusion, midazolam and propofol inhibited both chemotaxis and exocytosis of mast cells, while thiopental only inhibited chemotaxis, and ketamine only inhibited exocytosis.", 
    "9": "Mast cells play an important role in the antibacterial host-defense mechanism. Thiopental, midazolam, and propofol exerted a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on mast cell chemotaxis. Ketamine, midazolam, and propofol had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on mast cell exocytosis. The impairment of mast cell function by IV anesthetics may influence the defense against infection.", 
    "10": "The intrinsic clearances (CLint) of midazolam, triazolam, diazepam, nordiazepam, flunitrazepam and alprazolam were determined from two liver banks (n=21) by formation kinetics of ten metabolites. A literature-collated database of in vivo CLint values (811 subjects) was used to assess predictions and variability. The in vivo clearance of six benzodiazepines was generally underpredicted by in vitro data and the degree of bias was in agreement with a database of structurally diverse compounds (n=37). The variability observed for in vitro clearances (11--19--fold for midazolam, diazepam and nordiazepam in liver bank 1; 101--269--fold for triazolam, flunitrazepam and alprazolam in liver bank 2) exceeded the in vivo variability for the same compounds (4--59 and 10--29, respectively). This mismatch may contribute to the bias in microsomal predictions and it highlights the need for careful selection of representative livers for human liver banks.", 
    "11": "Intake of drugs is considered a risk factor for psoriasis. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between drugs and psoriasis. A case-control study including 110 patients who were hospitalized for extensive psoriasis was performed. A control group (n = 515) was defined as patients who had undergone elective surgery. A case-crossover study included 98 patients with psoriasis. Exposure to drugs was assessed during a hazard period (3 months before hospitalization) and compared to a control period in the patient's past. Data on drug sales were extracted by data mining techniques. Multivariate analyses were performed by logistic regression and conditional logistic regression. In the case-control study, psoriasis was associated with benzodiazepines (OR 6.9), organic nitrates (OR 5.0), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (OR 4.0) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (OR 3.7). In the case-crossover study, psoriasis was associated with ACE inhibitors (OR 9.9), beta-blockers (OR 9.9), dipyrone (OR 4.9) and NSAIDs (OR 2.1). Extensive psoriasis may be associated with intake of ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs or beta-blockers.", 
    "12": "Illicit drug users undergoing mandatory reductions in prescribed diazepam were randomly allocated to one of two methods of delivering psychological support to help reduce their prescription: a) an enhanced intervention consisting of skills training and reinforcement, and b) a limited intervention where patients initially received skills training and thereafter only advice. Outcome measures at baseline and six-months consisted of daily diazepam dose; reported illicit drug use; Severity of Dependence Scale; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Fifty-three of 119 eligible patients agreed to be randomly allocated to the interventions. Those in the enhanced intervention reduced their daily dose of prescribed diazepam from a mean of 27.8 mgs to 19.9 mgs at six months (5.3% per month) compared with 29.8 mgs to 17.6 mgs at six months (7.5%) among those in the limited intervention group. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the reduction rate between the intervention groups. Approximately 75% of patients in each group suspended their reduction programme. The enhanced intervention group reported a statistically and clinically greater reduction in the mean HADS depression score (10.6 at baseline and 7.7 at follow-up), compared with a rise from 8.9 to 11.2 in the limited intervention group. In conclusion, it is possible to reduce prescribed diazepam among illicit drug users but not at the rate of 10% per month set by the study. The difficulties of working with this population necessitate a flexible and possibly long-term approach to reducing prescribed benzodiazepines.", 
    "13": "Opioid withdrawal, stress or cues associated with opioid consumption can induce opioid craving. If opioids are not available, opioid-dependent patients usually search for alternative drugs. Because several non-opioid drugs stimulate the endogenous opioidergic system, this concept may explain their frequent use by opioid-dependent patients. We hypothesized that non-opioid drugs alleviate opioid withdrawal symptoms and are therefore consumed by opioid addicts. We asked 89 opioid-dependent patients participating in an out-patient opioid maintenance program to estimate the potential of several non-opioid drugs in being able to alleviate opioid withdrawal. We applied a five-point Lickert scale (1 = very good reduction of opioid withdrawal; 5 = no reduction of opioid withdrawal). Patients could also indicate a worsening of opioid withdrawal. Values (mean +/- SD) were: for benzodiazepines, 3.2 +/- 1.1; tricyclic antidepressants, 3.6 +/- 1.1; cannabis, 3.6 +/- 1.0; alcohol, 4.1 +/- 1.1; cocaine, 4.2 +/- 1.1; amphetamine, 4.4 +/- 0.9; nicotine, 4.7 +/- 0.7; and caffeine, 4.9 +/- 0.5. A worsening of opioid withdrawal was reported by 62% of the patients for cocaine, 62% for amphetamine, 50% for caffeine, 37.5% for cannabis, 27% for nicotine, 26% for alcohol, 8% for tricyclic antidepressants and 3% for benzodiazepines. Our study shows a low efficacy of non-opioid drugs in alleviating opioid withdrawal symptoms. The data basis of this study was good and the sample was suitable to be asked for estimations of drug-drug interactions. Of the patients, 26 - 62% even reported a worsening of opioid withdrawal for cannabis, alcohol, cocaine and amphetamine. Only benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants were reported to have a moderate positive effect on opioid withdrawal.", 
    "14": "The present retrospective chart review documents the treatment practice of in-patients suffering from acute manic or hypomanic episodes, at the Department of General Psychiatry, Medical University of Vienna between 1997 and 2001. The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of typical neuroleptics and atypical antipsychotics as add-on therapy to mood stabilizers. A total of 119 episodes of consecutively admitted patients with ICD-10-defined acute mania (n=106) or hypomania (n=13) were included in a retrospective analysis. Two subgroups were separated out of the whole patient sample according to the medication used: (a) mood stabilizer+typical neuroleptic (n=27) and (b) mood stabilizer+atypical antipsychotic (n=39). The treatment patterns of both subgroups during the first 14 d of in-patient treatment were evaluated. The therapeutic effect was measured by the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI). Both patient groups showed no differences on CGI at admission. Patients treated with atypical antipsychotics showed a significantly greater clinical improvement after 14 d (p<0.005) and on discharge (p<0.05) than patients treated with typical neuroleptics. Furthermore, patients treated with atypical antipsychotics developed significantly less extrapyramidal side-effects (p<0.01) and were significantly treated less often with benzodiazepines (p<0.05) during the first 14 d compared to the group receiving typical neuroleptics. Based on our evaluation and the data available in the literature atypical antipsychotics can be considered as first choice for the treatment of acute mania as add-on therapy to mood stabilizers because of their better efficacy and side-effect profile compared to typical neuroleptics.", 
    "15": "Social anxiety disorder, or social phobia (SP), is an anxiety disorder characterized by excessive fear of exposure to situations that involve potential scrutiny by others. SP is a common psychiatric problem in children and adolescents, often presenting with comorbid anxiety and mood disorders. Although the onset of SP is typically in late childhood or early adolescence, most afflicted individuals go undiagnosed for years, not seeking treatment until adulthood. First-line treatments for SP in adults support the use of pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. There is new and emerging data in youths with SP to support the use of similar treatments. This paper will review the clinical characteristics, epidemiology, and treatment of SP in youths. Current investigations using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors in youths will be reviewed. Several studies on the use of cognitive behavioral therapy in youths will also be examined. Practical guidelines for clinicians who treat children and adolescents are also presented.", 
    "16": "Benzodiazepines, particularly diazepam (DZ), are used in clinical practice to suppress acute vestibular symptoms. There have been limited studies looking at the effects of tolerance to DZ on parameters designed to measure the integrity of the vestibular system and its interaction with the oculomotor and balance systems.", 
    "17": "In a double-blinded, repeated-measures design, we randomized 30 young healthy men into one of two treatment groups (diazepam and placebo) and assessed with electro-oculography the effects of clinical divided doses of DZ on saccadic eye movements and sedation over 16 days.", 
    "18": "Only sedation and saccadic latency were significant (p < .05) for treatment group, indicating selective effects on different central nervous system mechanisms. No significant effect for time was seen in any of the variables measured. Bonferroni t-test comparisons of the DZ group among 3 days were significant (p < .017) between baseline and day 3 for saccadic latency and accuracy and between day 3 and day 16 for self-ratings of sedation.", 
    "19": "Saccadic latency and accuracy and sedation ratings appear to be more sensitive to changes over time and less affected by subject variability than saccadic eye velocity. It remains questionable whether patients who have been on DZ for acute or extended periods of time need to discontinue the drug 48 hours before testing.", 
    "20": "We attempted to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of the antiepileptic drug oxcarbazepine in benzodiazepine detoxification, by observing several cases. Detoxification followed a predefined dosage scheme. All patients detoxified with oxcarbazepine completed the withdrawal successfully, without withdrawal symptoms. The administration of oxcarbazepine according to the scheme proved to be tolerable. The dosage was sufficient. Though uncontrolled case observations must be interpreted with caution, oxcarbazepine appears to be a promising drug in inpatient benzodiazepine withdrawal. It should be examined in further randomized placebo-controlled studies including long-term follow-ups.", 
    "21": "Previous studies comparing olanzapine (OLZ) and risperidone (RIS) have tended to focus on multiple-episode patients, with no studies examining their comparative efficacy in a non-selective sample of first-episode psychosis.", 
    "22": "The Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre in Australia had admitted 786 first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients between 1998-2000. Data were collected from the medical records (MR) of 367 patients, which met inclusion criteria. The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of OLZ vs. RIS as measured by CGI-S, CGI-BP (symptomatic level), GAF and SOFAS (functioning level).", 
    "23": "367 FEP patients were entered into the study, 278 in the RIS- (2.7 mg/day) and 89 in the OLZ group (10.2 mg/day). No between-group differences were found in non-affective FEP (n = 273). In affective FEP patients (n = 94), mainly treated for acute mania (86.7 %), OLZ treatment was related to better response on the symptomatic (CGI-S; p = .002), but not on the functioning level (GAF and SOFAS; ns). There were trends in the OLZ group towards a higher rate of remission of positive symptoms ( p = .054) and a shorter treatment duration to reach this remission in affective FEP patients ( p = .077). More extrapyramidal side effects ( p <.001) were related to RIS and more weight gain to OLZ-treatment ( p <.001).", 
    "24": "Despite the limitations of a retrospective MR design, study results suggest equal therapeutic efficacy of OLZ and RIS in non-affective FEP and some therapeutic advantages of OLZ compared to RIS in affective FEP patients, especially in those with acute mania. Results may serve as hypotheses for future randomised controlled trials.", 
    "25": "Different pharmacologic agents have been used for sedation in children undergoing invasive procedures. The authors prospectively compared the efficacy, the occurrence of adverse effects, cardiovascular parameters, oxygen saturation and induction, and recovery time in propofol with or without morphine versus midazolam/ketamine sedation for procedural sedation in children with malignancies and hematologic disorders. Fifty children received either propofol with or without morphine or ketamine/midazolam sedation for invasive procedures. Intravenous sedation consisted of 0.1 mg midazolam/kg and 1.0 mg ketamine/kg or 2 mg propofol/kg with or without 0.1 mg morphine/kg. Incremental dosages of ketamine or propofol were given, if necessary, to achieve or to maintain adequate sedation levels. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, time to induce sedation, recovery time, and adverse effects were recorded. All invasive procedures were successfully completed, with satisfactory sedation levels in all 25 patients in the propofol group and 23 of the 25 patients in the ketamine group. In 14 of the 25 procedures in the propofol group and 4 of the 25 procedures in the ketamine group, sedation was associated with side effects, the most common being oxygen desaturation. There was a significant increase in diastolic blood pressure after ketamine medication and a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate in the propofol group. Induction and recovery times in the propofol group were significantly shorter. Both regimens for procedural sedation are efficacious in achieving satisfactory sedation levels for invasive procedures. Propofol offers a quicker onset of sedation and a faster, smoother recovery but is associated with a higher rate of side effects. Considering the substantial rate of adverse effects, these procedural sedations should be performed only by physicians trained in advanced airway management and life support.", 
    "26": "Adjuncts to local anesthetics for brachial plexus block may enhance the quality and duration of analgesia. Midazolam, a water-soluble benzodiazepine, is known to produce antinociception and enhance the effect of local anesthetics when given epidurally or intrathecally. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of midazolam added to brachial plexus anesthesia.", 
    "27": "A prospective, randomized, double blind study was conducted on 40 ASA I or II adult patients undergoing upper limb surgeries under supraclavicular brachial plexus block. Patients were randomly divided into two groups. Patients in Group B (n = 20) were administered 30 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine and Group BM (n = 20) were given 30 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with midazolam 50 microg x kg(-1). Hemodynamic variables (i.e., heart rate, noninvasive blood pressure), pain scores and rescue analgesic requirements were recorded for 24 hr postoperatively.", 
    "28": "The onset of sensory and motor block was significantly faster in Group BM compared to Group B (P < 0.05). Pain scores were significantly higher in Group B compared to Group BM from two hours to 24 hr postoperatively (P < 0.05). Rescue analgesic requirements were significantly less in Group BM compared to Group B (P < 0.05). Hemodynamics and sedation scores did not differ between groups in the post-operative period.", 
    "29": "Midazolam (50 microg x kg(-1)) in combination with 30 mL of bupivacaine (0.5%) hastened onset of sensory and motor block, and improved postoperative analgesia when used in brachial plexus block, without producing any adverse events.", 
    "30": "We have shown previously that the function of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors can be modulated by zinc. This modulation varies from potentiation to inhibition, depending on receptor subunit composition and zinc concentration, with the alpha4beta2 and alpha4beta4 receptors displaying the most dramatic potentiation. In this study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to identify glutamate 59 and histidine 162 on the rat alpha4 subunit as potential mediators of zinc potentiation. By modeling the extracellular domain of the receptor pentamer, we locate these residues to two subunit-subunit interfaces that alternate with the two acetylcholine-binding interfaces. Substitution of a cysteine at either position allows additional reduction of zinc potentiation upon treatment with the methanethiosulfonate reagents N-biotinoylaminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA-biotin) and [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate. Mutagenesis and methanethiosulfonate treatment are most effective at position 162, and the presence of zinc hinders the reaction of MTSEA-biotin with the substituted cysteine at this position, suggesting that alpha4His162 participates in forming a coordination site for zinc. Mutagenesis and methanethiosulfonate treatment are less effective at position 59, suggesting that whereas alpha4Glu59 may be near the zinc coordination site, it may not be participating in coordination of the zinc ion. It is noteworthy that the position of alpha4Glu59 within the neuronal nAChR is identical to that of a residue that lines the benzodiazepine-binding site on GABA(A) receptors. We suggest that the zinc potentiation sites on neuronal nAChRs are structurally and functionally similar to the benzodiazepine-binding sites on GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "31": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) has been considered a promising drug target for cancer therapy, and several ligands have been developed for this purpose. Human T-lymphoma Jurkat cells have been considered as lacking PBR and are often used as negative control to prove the specificity of PBR ligands effects. It is surprising that we evidenced PBR protein expression in this cell line by means of Western blotting and immunocytochemistry assays using specific anti-PBR antibodies. PBR intracellular localization was evidenced in mitochondria and nuclei, as demonstrated by confocal and electron microscopy. The binding of the [(3)H]4'-chloro derivative of diazepam [(3)H]7-chloro-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (Ro5-4864) and the isoquinoline carboxamide derivative [(3)H]1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3 isoquinolinecarboxamide (PK11195) evidenced a single class of binding sites with an unusual affinity constant (K(d)) of 1.77 +/- 0.30 and 2.20 +/- 0.20 microM, respectively. The pharmacological profile of the classic ligands showed that PK11195 was the most potent inhibitor in the radioligand binding assays followed by Ro5-4864 and diazepam, whereas clonazepam, a specific ligand for the central-type receptor, showed a K(i) >1.0 x 10(-4) M. By a combined strategy of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot experiments, we succeeded in isolating and cloning the full-length Jurkat PBR cDNA, called JuPBR. The JuPBR gene showed two single-nucleotide polymorphisms resulting in the two substitutions, Ala147 --> threonine and His162 --> arginine, of PBR amino acidic sequence. In conclusion, for the first time, we demonstrated PBR expression in Jurkat cells: the protein bound classic PBR ligands with micromolar affinity constants and presented a modified amino acidic sequence consequent to the detection of two gene polymorphisms.", 
    "32": "Male mice (Mus musculus) from 15 standard inbred strains were exposed to a nearly constant concentration of ethanol (EtOH) vapor for 72 hr, averaging 1.59 +/- 0.03 mg EtOH/mL blood at withdrawal. EtOH- and air-exposed groups were tested hourly for handling-induced convulsions for 10 hr and at Hours 24 and 25. Strains differed markedly in the severity of withdrawal (after subtraction of control values), and by design these differences were independent of strain differences in EtOH metabolism. Correlation of strain mean withdrawal severity with other responses to EtOH supported previously reported genetic relationships of high EtOH withdrawal with low drinking, high conditioned taste aversion, low tolerance to EtOH-induced hypothermia, and high stimulated activity after low-dose EtOH. Also supported were the positive genetic correlations among EtOH, barbiturate, and benzodiazepine withdrawal. Sensitivity of naive mice to several chemical convulsant-induced seizures was also correlated with EtOH withdrawal.",

Eight (19.5%) were on a restricted diet. Twenty-three subjects (56.1%) were switched from a typical antipsychotic to olanzapine, and 18 subjects (43.9%) were switched from a typical antipsychotic to risperidone. Of the subsample of subjects who were switched from a typical antipsychotic to risperidone, 12 (66.7%) went on to be switched to olanzapine because of either emergent side effects or lack of efficacy. For the overall sample (N = 41), there was a 19.3% increase in chlorpromazine-equivalent antipsychotic dosage from baseline to the 2-year endpoint along with a 5.6% decrease in fasting blood glucose from baseline to the 2-year endpoint. There were no significant differences between baseline and endpoint values for BMI, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or triglycerides.", 
    "36": "The findings of this 2-year evaluation suggest that clinically or statistically significant BMI increases as well as blood glucose and lipid elevations are not unavoidably correlated with the use of the atypical antipsychotic agents olanzapine and risperi-done and may be minimized by careful monitoring, a regimen of dietary control, and a moderate activity level in a residential population of individuals with mental retardation.",

Participants were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia on the basis of clinical criteria and medical history (including medical records and neuroradiologic documentation). Cases included patients hospitalized for stroke or transient ischemic attack between June 30, 1998, and December 27, 1999.

Score of the children was assessed every 5 minutes till the induction of anesthesia. Intraoperative and postoperative analgesic requirement was recorded along with postoperative recovery and complications.", 
    "47": "The groups were identical regarding the patient's characteristics, hemodynamic variables, duration of surgery and awakening time. Less time was required for the onset and time of maximum sedation in the butorphanol group (p<0.05). Sedation scores were similar among the groups at all time intervals, while the scores were higher in the butorphanol group at the time of induction (p<0.05). Less number of children required intraoperative and postoperative rescue analgesia in the butorphanol group (p<0.05). Statistically significant difference was found among the groups in respect to complete amnesia (50% in group I vs 80% I group II, p<0.05) and recollection (40% in group I vs 10% in group II, p<0.05).", 
    "48": "Oral butorphanol is comparable to oral midazolam in children but analgesia along with sedation is an additional advantage which makes it better than midazolam without a significant increase in side effects.", 
    "49": "New pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimers have been developed that are composed of two DC-81 subunits tethered to their C8 positions through piperazine moiety side-armed with alkaneoxy linkers (composed of 2-5 carbons). DNA thermal denaturation studies show that after 18h of incubation with calf thymus DNA at a 1:5 ligand/DNA ratio, one of them, 6a, increases the DeltaT(m) value by 24.0 degrees C. Thus, incorporation of a piperazine moiety instead of an inert alkanedioxy linker alone significantly enhances the DNA binding ability, and the analogous dimer 4 that lacks a piperazine moiety in the linker spacer elevates melting by only 15.1 degrees C under identical experimental conditions. This illustrates the effect of introducing a piperazine ring in the middle of such an alkanedioxy linker which produces several hydrophobic interactions and could also achieve a superior isohelical fit within the DNA minor groove. Interestingly, these dimers 6a-d are significantly more cytotoxic than 4 in a number of human cancer cell lines, in particular, compound 6c is highly potent for almost all the nine human cancer cell lines.", 
    "50": "Nocturnal hormone profiles were measured in patients with schizophrenia with predominantly negative symptoms both under drug-free baseline conditions and after subchronic administration of the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine, with the aim of characterizing its pharmacological properties on the neuroendocrine level. The following hormones were studied in the sleep laboratory under polysomnographic control: adrenocorticotrophic hormone, cortisol, growth hormone (GH), prolactin, testosterone, and melatonin. Blood samples were taken at regular time intervals over the night, and serum concentrations of the hormones were determined. Ten patients completed the study, two of them were excluded from analysis due to incomplete hormone profiles. The dynamics of baseline nocturnal hormone secretion were similar to the patterns known from healthy subjects. After the treatment period of about 4 weeks, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity was reduced with decreased cortisol plasma levels compared to baseline conditions. Olanzapine induced a moderate prolactin elevation. The characteristic GH peak around sleep onset, clearly present under baseline conditions, was markedly reduced after treatment. Testosterone and melatonin secretion were not significantly altered. In conclusion, although interpretation is difficult in some cases due to interference with indirect effects of olanzapine administration and the consequences of the clinical course of the underlying schizophrenic disorder, the neuroendocrine findings are consistent with the receptor-binding profile of olanzapine where, beside the D(2) antagonism, the antiserotonergic properties are most important.", 
    "51": "Previously, with the administration of antidepressant drugs, it has been demonstrated that the rat model of clinical depression, known as the reduction of submissive behavior model (RSBM), has considerable validity. The present study is an attempt to extend the model to mice. Several antidepressant drugs as well as a number of non-antidepressant agents were administered to mice that had been identified as submissive in a behavioral testing situation. Imipramine, desipramine, amoxapine and fluoxetine, representing three different classes of antidepressant drugs, were each able to increase competitive behavior in submissive mice and to decrease the dominance level between dominant and submissive mice in the behavioral tests. The stimulant amphetamine also reduced submissive behavior while yohimbine (also a stimulant), and the antianxiety agent diazepam had no such effect. The neuroleptic drug thiothixen had antidepressant-like effect on submissive C57BL/6J mice behavior. We conclude that like the rat model of depression from which it was developed, the mouse model responds to various antidepressants as predicted and thus may serve as a potential model of clinical depression.", 
    "52": "Thymol is a naturally occurring phenolic monoterpene known for its anti-microbial and anti-oxidant properties. It is used in dental practice and in anaesthetic halothane preparations. Recent studies have reported enhanced GABA(A) receptor-operated chloride channel activity and increased binding affinity of [(3)H]flunitrazepam in the presence of thymol. In the present work, we more closely examined the pharmacological action of thymol on the native GABA(A) receptor by using primary cultures of cortical neurons. Thymol enhanced GABA-induced (5 microM) chloride influx at concentrations lower than those exhibiting direct activity in the absence of GABA (EC(50) = 12 microM and 135 microM, respectively). This direct effect was inhibited by competitive and non-competitive GABA(A) receptor antagonists. Thymol increased [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding (EC(50) = 131 microM) and showed a tendency to increase [(3)H]muscimol binding. These results confirm that thymol is a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA(A) receptor. The thymol structural analogues menthol and cymene, which lack an aromatic ring or a hydroxyl group, did not affect [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding. Using a pharmacophoric model that includes a hydrogen bond donor group as well as an aromatic ring with two aliphatic substituents, we propose to demonstrate the molecular essential features of these compounds to interact with GABA(A) receptors. Thymol (0-1 mM) did not affect cellular viability.", 
    "53": "The lateral, basal, and central nuclei of the amygdala are part of a circuitry that instantiates many fear and anxious behaviors. One line of support indicates that immediate-early gene (IEG) expression (e.g., c-fos and egr-1 (zif268)) is increased in these nuclei following fear conditioning. Other research finds that anxiogenic drugs working through various mechanisms induce IEG expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) suggesting that expression is a neural marker for fear and anxiety. However, several studies have also found that anxiolytic drugs induce IEG expression in the CeA. Expression of egr-1 in the CeA and lateral nucleus of the amygdala following administration of anxiolytic and anxiogenic benzodiazepine and serotonin agonists and antagonists was investigated. The first experiment determined behaviorally active anxiolytic and anxiogenic doses for two anxiogenic drugs (FG 7142 and mCPP) and two anxiolytic drugs (diazepam and buspirone). The effects of anxiogenic and anxiolytic doses of these drugs on egr-1 expression in the amygdala were then tested in a second experiment. All four drugs increased egr-1 in the CeA indicating that increased egr-1 mRNA expression in the CeA is not specific to anxiolytic or anxiogenic effects of the drugs. We suggest that IEG expression in the CeA may be due to activation of circuits that are associated with systemic physiological homeostasis perturbed by a number of drugs including anxiogenic and anxiolytic compounds.",

Costs were expressed in 2002 U.S. dollars. Adverse events were agitation, hypertriglyceridemia and/or pancreatitis, hypotension, nutritional changes, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and prolonged awakening and/or extubation. MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched to obtain durations of sedation, the incidence of outcomes, and cost estimates of outcomes. The ability to maintain specific levels of sedation was assumed equivalent among the sedatives. Univariate sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the cost-driving variables, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted by using second-order Monte Carlo simulations.",

Indiplon will be an addition to the general category of newer-generation hypnotics that now includes zaleplon, zolpidem, zopiclone and eszopiclone. Clinical trials were carried out with an immediate-release capsule and a modified-release tablet and demonstrate very positive efficacy and safety profiles.

    "63": "Classical benzodiazepines (BZs), such as diazepam, bind to GABAA receptors containing alpha1, alpha2, alpha3 or alpha5 subunits that are therefore described as diazepam-sensitive (DS) receptors. However, the corresponding binding site of GABAA receptors containing either an alpha4 or alpha6 subunit do not bind the classical BZs and are therefore diazepam-insensitive (DIS) receptors; a difference attributable to a single amino acid (histidine in alpha1, alpha2, alpha3 and alpha5 subunits and arginine in alpha4 and alpha6). Unlike classical BZs, the imidazobenzodiazepines Ro 15-4513 and bretazenil bind to both DS and DIS populations of GABAA receptors. In the present study, an in vivo assay was developed using lorazepam to fully occupy DS receptors such that [3H]Ro 15-4513 was then only able to bind to DIS receptors. When dosed i.v., [3H]Ro 15-4513 rapidly entered and was cleared from the brain, with approximately 70% of brain radioactivity being membrane-bound. Essentially all membrane binding to DS+DIS receptors could be displaced by unlabelled Ro 15-4513 or bretazenil, with respective ID50 values of 0.35 and 1.2 mg kg(-1). A dose of 30 mg kg(-1) lorazepam was used to block all DS receptors in a [3H]Ro 15-1788 in vivo binding assay. When predosed in a [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding assay, lorazepam blocked [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding to DS receptors, with the remaining binding to DIS receptors accounting for 5 and 23% of the total (DS plus DIS) receptors in the forebrain and cerebellum, respectively. The in vivo binding of [3H]Ro 15-4513 to DIS receptors in the presence of lorazepam was confirmed using alpha1H101R knock-in mice, in which alpha1-containing GABAA receptors are rendered diazepam insensitive by mutation of the histidine that confers diazepam sensitivity to arginine. In these mice, and in the presence of lorazepam, there was an increase of in vivo [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding in the forebrain and cerebellum from 4 and 15% to 36 and 59% of the total (i.e. DS plus DIS) [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding observed in the absence of lorazepam.", 
    "64": "In a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study; the acceptability, efficacy and safety of injectable midazolam as oral premedicant in children was evaluated. One hundred children (ASA 1,2) aged 6 months to 6 years, undergoing elective neurosurgical operations, like meningomyelocele, meningo-encephalocele, ventriculo peritoneal and other shunts and craniotomies for tumour decompression etc., were included in the study. The patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups (A, B, C, D) receiving respectively saline or 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0 mg/kg midazolam in honey, 45 min before separation from parents. All received identical general anesthesia (GA). Age, sex, weight, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, saturation (SaO2), reaction to parent's separation, sedation score and duration of anesthesia, recovery conditions and side effects were noted. We found no difference in age, sex, weight, patient acceptability vomiting after ingestion and duration of anesthesia between groups. Even though many children resisted the placement of premedicant in the mouth, only three children spat it out and none vomited after swallowing. The reaction to separation from parents was better after midazolam premedication. However, on reaching the operating room, 24% children (placebo-60%) were found anxious after 0.50 mg/kg, but 12% were deeply sedated after a dose of 1.0 mg/kg. Recovery was similar in groups A, B and C except that more (48%) patients were anxious in group A. Recovery, however was delayed in 16% patients of group D. Though, fewer complications were reported during recovery after midazolam than placebo premedication, they were minimal in the 0.75 mg/kg group. We concluded that giving injectable midazolam orally as premedication in pediatric age group scheduled for neurosurgical operations is acceptable, effective and safe in 0.75 mg/kg dose. While 0.50 mg/kg is less effective, 1.0 mg/kg does not offer any additional benefit over 0.75 mg/kg but does delay recovery and may compromise safety.",

A review of the data on all patients sedated between 1997 and 2003 for magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and interventional radiology revealed associated adverse respiratory events in 70 patients. Adverse respiratory event was defined as oxygen desaturation of at least 5%, pulmonary aspiration, and need for airway resuscitation. Adverse cardiovascular events were defined as cardiac arrest and hemodynamic changes requiring medical therapy.

In rats, TPA023 gave time- and dose-dependent occupancy after oral dosing, with 50% occupancy corresponding to a dose of 0.42 mg/kg. It has anxiolytic-like activity in unconditioned (elevated plus maze) and conditioned (fear-potentiated startle and conditioned suppression of drinking) rat models of anxiety with minimum effective doses (MED; 1-3 mg/kg) corresponding to 70 to 88% occupancy. However, there was no appreciable sedation in a response sensitivity (chain-pulling) assay at a dose of 30 mg/kg, resulting in 99% occupancy. Similarly, TPA023 was robustly anxiolytic in the squirrel monkey conditioned emotional response assay, with a MED of 0.3 mg/kg, but did not produce any sedation in a lever-pressing test of sedation even at 10 mg/kg. TPA023 produced no impairment in performance in the mouse Rotarod assay, and there was only a mild interaction with ethanol. In addition to anxiolytic-like efficacy, TPA023 had anticonvulsant activity in a mouse pentylenetetrazole seizure model. Finally, TPA023 did not cause precipitated withdrawal in mice treated for 7 days with the nonselective agonist triazolam, nor did N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG 7142) precipitate withdrawal in mice treated for 7 days with TPA023. In summary, the novel alpha2/alpha3-selective efficacy profile of TPA023 translates into a nonsedating anxiolytic profile that is distinct from nonselective agonists.",

After 30 min of the beta-carbolines injections, mice were placed individually in a vertical glass cylinder (height, 25 cm; diameter, 12 cm) containing water about 15 cm deep at 22+/-1 degrees C and forced to swim. Treatment of animals with harmane (5-15 mg/kg, i.p.), norharmane (2.5-10 mg/kg, i.p.) and harmine (5-15 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced dose-dependently the time of immobility. Their antidepressant-like effects were not affected by pretreatment with reserpine at the dose of 5 mg/kg, i.p., 18 h before the test, which did not modify the immobility time. Conversely, when flumazenil (5 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 30 min before the test, it was able to antagonize completely the antidepressant-like effects of harmane, norharmane and harmine. It was concluded that harmane, norharmane and harmine reduce the immobility time in this test, suggesting an antidepressant-like effect, via an inverse-agonistic mechanism located in the benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "71": "Schizophrenia is a common psychiatric condition, affecting approximately 1% of the population. Acute emergent presentations often include hallucinations, delusions, thought, and speech disorders. Agitation is common among emergency patients with schizophrenia. Decisional capacity should be assessed in all patients. Reversible causes of agitation should be ruled out, including infection, metabolic disorders, endocrine disorders, trauma, pain, noncompliance, toxicological disorders, and structural brain abnormalities. Agitation may be managed acutely using a combination of pharmacological agents and nonpharmacological interventions. Effective pharmacological agents include several classes of antipsychotic agents and benzodiazepines. Potential life-threatening complications of pharmacological therapy should be anticipated, which may include neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), prolonged QT syndrome, and respiratory depression. Nonpharmacological interventions may include a quiet environment, physical restraints, and behavioral interventions. Disposition decisions should be made based on the etiology of agitation, effective management, decisional capacity, and presence of suicidal or homicidal intentions. Many patients who have required nonpharmacological or pharmacological management of agitation require inpatient psychiatric treatment, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Psychiatric consultation should be sought for patients with schizophrenia and uncertain disposition determinations, or those requiring other complex management decisions.",

We examined 18 PD patients clinically and with [11C](R)-PK11195 and [18F]-dopa PET. Compared to 11 normal controls, the PD patients showed significantly increased mean levels of [11C](R)-PK11195 binding in the pons, basal ganglia and frontal and temporal cortical regions. Eight PD patients were examined longitudinally, and their [11C](R)-PK11195 signal remained stable over 2 years. Levels of microglial activation did not correlate with clinical severity or putamen [18F]-dopa uptake. Our in vivo findings confirm that widespread microglial activation is associated with the pathological process in PD. The absence of significant longitudinal changes suggests that microglia are activated early in the disease process, and levels then remain relatively static, possibly driving the disease via cytokine release.", 
    "77": "Perverse incentives in drug development, research, marketing and clinical usage can be illustrated by considering the example of the so-called 'atypical' neuroleptics which have grown to become a standard - indeed expanding - part of psychiatric practice despite their probable inferiority to older sedative agents. There is now ample evidence to suggest that neuroleptics (aka. anti-psychotics and major tranquillizers) are dangerous drugs, and patients' exposure to them should be minimized wherever possible. This clinical imperative applies whether neuroleptics are of the traditional type or atypical variety, albeit for different reasons since the traditional agents are neurotoxic, while atypicals are mainly metabolic poisons. Usage of traditional neuroleptics seems indeed to be declining progressively, but the opposite seems to be happening for 'atypicals', and new indications for these drugs are being promoted. Yet the atypical neuroleptics are a category of pharmaceuticals which are close to being un-necessary since there are safer, cheaper and pleasanter substitutes, such as benzodiazepines and the sedative antihistamines (e.g. promethazine). If 'atypical' neuroleptics did not exist, it would not be necessary to invent them. Analysis of how such expensive, dangerous and inferior drugs as the 'atypicals' have nevertheless come to dominate clinical practice casts light on the perverse incentives which now motivate the pharmaceutical industry in an era of massive state regulation. The lack of positive incentives to deploy off-patent drugs is longstanding, but there is a new disincentive in the widespread but erroneous belief that only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) can provide valid 'evidence' of effectiveness. Consequently, those who control RCTs now control clinical practice. It sometimes makes commercial sense to develop and market new drugs that are inferior to existing agents, since new drugs are patent-protected and can be promoted on the back of a mass of new RCTs funded and 'owned' by the pharmaceutical corporations. The current regulatory and patenting situation, therefore, requires major reform if drug efficacy and patient safety are to become higher priorities. Given that psychiatric practice is apparently 'locked-in' to prescribing atypicals, and if (as seems likely) most informed individuals would wish to avoid neuroleptics for themselves and their loved-ones except as a last resort; then in the short-term it may be wise for patients and their families to explore the possibilities of increased self-management of psychiatric problems using over-the-counter drugs, such as the sedative antihistamines. In the long-term, there need to be legal reforms to change the regulatory and commercial framework of incentives relating to drug development. These might include new forms of short-term re-patenting of old drugs.", 
    "78": "Benzodiazepines, which are gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA(A)) receptor positive modulators, can block the behavioral effects of psychomotor stimulants. In the present study, the ability of oxazepam, which may have less abuse potential compared to some other benzodiazepines, to attenuate the discriminative-stimulus, subject-rated and psychomotor performance effects of d-amphetamine in humans was determined. Six healthy participants (2 female, 4 male) learned to discriminate 15 mg oral d-amphetamine. After acquiring the discrimination (i.e., > or = 80% correct responding on 4 consecutive days), the effects of d-amphetamine (0, 2.5, 5, 10 and 15 mg), alone and in combination with acutely administered oxazepam (0 and 20 mg) were assessed. d-Amphetamine alone functioned as a discriminative stimulus, produced stimulant-like subject-rated effects (e.g., increased ratings of Stimulated on a Drug-Effect Questionnaire) and enhanced psychomotor performance. Oxazepam alone increased subject ratings of sedation (e.g., increased ratings of Sluggish, Fatigued and Lazy on a Drug-Effect Questionnaire) and impaired psychomotor performance. Oxazepam alone did not occasion d-amphetamine-like discriminative-stimulus effects, and had no effect on the discriminative-stimulus or subject-rated effects of d-amphetamine when given in combination. The results of this experiment are discordant with previous research and suggest that benzodiazepines differ in their ability to modulate the behavioral effects of d-amphetamine.",

Unfortunately, the loss of specialized liver functions (dedifferentiation) is still a major problem. Different techniques, such as collagen entrapment, spherical multicellular aggregates (spheroids), and coculture of hepatocytes with extracellular matrix, have been used to improve the performance of hepatocytes in culture. The aim of this study was to compare two different models of hepatocyte isolation in culture: isolated hepatocytes (G1) and hepatocyte spheroids (60% hepatocytes, 40% nonparenchymal cells, and extracellular matrix) (G2). To test functional activity of hepatocytes, both synthetic and metabolic, production of albumin and benzodiazepine transformation into metabolites was tested. G2 showed a high albumin secretion, while a decrease after 15 days of culture in G1 was noted. Diazepam metabolites were higher in G2 than in G1 in all samples, but had statistical significance at days 14 and 21 (p < 0.01). The glycogen content, after 30 days of culture, was very low in G1 (14.2 +/- 4.4%), while in G2 it was 72.1 +/- 2.6% (p < 0.01). Our study confirms the effectiveness of a culture technique with extracellular matrix and nonparenchymal cells. Maintenance of a prolonged functional activity has been related to restoration of cell polarity and close cell-to-cell contact. We showed that isolated hepatocytes maintain their functional activity for a period significantly reduced, when compared to the hepatocyte spheroids. We confirmed the role of extracellular matrix as a crucial component to promote hepatocyte homeostasis, and the close link between cellular architecture and tissue-specific functions.",

The myoclonic jerks were not stimulus-sensitive, and were not associated with enhancement of the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP). The most prominent electrophysiological finding was that rhythmic EMG activity was produced when the patient attempted rapid voluntary movement. EEG-EMG polygraph indicated that the rhythmic EMG activity was preceded by rhythmic activity in the EEG recorded overlying the contralateral central region. The frequency of both EEG and EMG activity was the same (approximately 50 Hz). Treatment using a combination of clonazepam, carbamazepine and primidone diminished the action myoclonus, concomitant with the disappearance of the rhythmic EEG and EMG activity. In the sensorimotor cortex of the normal monkey and humans, oscillatory activity ranging between 20-50 Hz has been recorded in the local field potential. Our findings suggest that cortical hyperoscillation may produce this characteristic rhythmic EEG and EMG activity and may, in turn, be related to cortical action myoclonus.", 
    "85": "Delirium is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome that involves a number of symptoms including diffuse cognitive impairment, delusions, hallucinations, mood lability and disturbances in the sleep-wake cycle. It occurs in 10-30% of hospitalized medically ill patients. Delirium is also associated with a prolonged hospital stay and increased functional decline and morbidity and mortality rates, particularly if it is unrecognized and untreated. Management of the symptoms of delirium involves non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions. Until recently, typical antipsychotics and benzodiazepines were commonly used in the pharmacological treatment of delirium. The extrapyramidal and anticholinergic side effects of typical antipsychotics and the negative effects of benzodiazepines on cognitive functions limit their use in delirium patients, who are generally old and who have other medical problems. Atypical antipsychotics have been shown to be effective in the treatment of psychotic symptoms. Although there are a number of studies showing their efficacy, most studies have some limitations such as small sample size and absence of control groups. Upon reviewing the studies of the treatment of delirium with atypical antipsychotics, it has been observed that the efficacy and safety of risperidone and olanzapine were shown in randomized trials, and the efficacy and safety of quetiapine were shown in case reports and retrospective studies, and it was shown that the side effect over the QT interval limits the use of ziprasidone in delirium treatment. Suggestions were made in the light of the literature on the use of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of delirium.", 
    "86": "The authors report findings from an 8-week, open-label trial conducted to evaluate efficacy of olanzapine in treating negative symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Subjects were AD patients age 50 and older who exhibited untreated neuropsychiatric symptoms. Findings suggest that a therapeutic profile for olanzapine may be appropriate for AD patients experiencing neuropsychiatric problems.", 
    "87": "We have investigated the effects of relatively high concentration of carbachol (CCh), an agonist of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR), on cardiac automaticity in mouse heart. Action potentials from automatically beating right atria of mice were measured with conventional microelectrodes. When atria were treated with 100 microM CCh, atrial beating was immediately arrested and diastolic membrane potential (DMP) was depolarized. After exposure of the atria to CCh for approximately 4 min, action potentials were regenerated. The regenerated action potentials had lower frequency and shorter duration when compared with the control. When atria were pre-exposed to pirenzepine (1 microM), an M1 mAChR antagonist, there was complete inhibition of CCh-induced depolarization of DMP and regeneration of action potentials. Pre-exposure to AFDX-116 (11 ({2-[(diethylamino)-methyl]-1 -piperidyl}acetyl)-5,11 -dihydro-6H-pyridol[2,3-b][1,4] benzodiazepine-6-one base, 1 microM), an M2 mAChR antagonist, failed to block CCh-induced arrest of the beating. However, prolonged exposure to CCh elicited gradual depolarization of DMP and slight acceleration in beating rate. Our data indicate that high concentration of CCh depolarizes membrane potential and recovers right atrial automaticity via M1 mAChR, providing functional evidence for the role of M1 mAChR in the atrial myocytes.", 
    "88": "Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are considered first-line treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Many patients achieve some response but remain symptomatic despite an adequate SRI trial. Recent neuroimaging data found abnormally high glutamatergic concentrations in children with OCD. Following selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment, a decrease in OCD symptom severity was associated with a decrease in caudate glutamatergic concentrations. We initiated an investigation of adjunctive topiramate (an anticonvulsant agent with glutamatergic properties) in the treatment of patients with OCD who were partially or nonresponsive to SRI treatment. Sixteen consecutive outpatients with OCD (mean age = 41.1 years; range = 21-58 years), who were partial or nonresponders to SRI monotherapy or SRI combination therapy (antipsychotic, other antidepressant, or benzodiazepines), and had topiramate added over a minimum of 14 weeks, were reviewed. Baseline and endpoint Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) and CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) were evaluated retrospectively. Eleven of 16 patients were responders (68.8%) with a CGI-I score of much improved or very much improved. The mean dose of topiramate was 253.1 +/- 93.9 mg/day. The mean time to response was 9.2 +/- 4.5 weeks. CGI-S scores decreased significantly from initiation of topiramate until 26 weeks, from 6.1 +/- 0.9 to 4.5 +/- 1.3 (P < .001). This case series suggests some preliminary evidence that the addition of topiramate may be useful in treatment-resistant OCD.", 
    "89": "Farnesyl transferase inhibitors are a new class of biologically active anticancer drugs. The exact mechanism of action of this class of agents is, however, currently unknown. The drugs inhibit farnesylation of a wide range of target proteins, including Ras. It is thought that these agents block Ras activation through inhibition of the enzyme farnesyl transferase, ultimately resulting in cell growth arrest. In preclinical models, the farnesyl transferase inhibitors showed great potency against tumor cells; yet in clinical studies, their activity was far less than anticipated. Reasons for this disappointing clinical outcome might be found in the drug-development process. In this paper, we outline an algorithm that is potentially useful for the development of biologically active anticancer drugs. The development of farnesyl transferase inhibitors, from discovery to clinical trials, is reviewed on the basis of this algorithm. We found that two important steps of this algorithm were underestimated. First, understanding of the molecular biology of the defective pathway has mainly been focused on H-Ras activation, whereas activation of K-Ras or other farnesylated proteins is probably more important in tumorigenesis. Inhibition of farnesylation is possibly not sufficient, because geranylgeranylation might activate K-Ras and suppress the effect of farnesyl transferase inhibitors. Furthermore, a well-defined proof of concept in preclinical and clinical studies has not been achieved. Integrating the proposed algorithm in future studies of newly developed biologically active anti-cancer drugs might increase the rate of success of these compounds in patients.", 
    "90": "In experiments designed to investigate the relationship between stress and the acquisition of new fear memories, it was found that previous exposure to a restraint session increased fear conditioning in a contextual fear paradigm. Moreover, the infusion of bicuculline, a competitive antagonist of GABAA receptors, into the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA), but not into the central amygdaloid nucleus, induced the same behavioral effect. Pretreatment with midazolam (MDZ), a positive modulator of GABAA sites, prevented the facilitating influence on fear memory of both stress and GABAA receptor blockade in the BLA. These data suggest that facilitation of fear conditioning could be causally related to increased neuronal excitability attributable to depressed GABAergic inhibition in the BLA. To test this hypothesis, evoked potentials were studied in brain slices from stressed animals. Potentials evoked in the BLA by single stimuli applied to the external capsule showed multispike responses, suggestive of GABAergic disinhibition. These multiple responses were no longer evident after the slices were perfused with diazepam or if the stressed animals were pretreated with MDZ. In slices from stressed rats, paired-pulse inhibition (GABA dependent) was suppressed. Also, in stressed animals, long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced with a single train of high-frequency stimulation, which did not induce LTP in control rats. Moreover, MDZ pretreatment prevented the facilitating influence of stress on LTP induction. All of these findings support the hypothesis that previous stress attenuates inhibitory GABAergic control in the BLA, leading to neuronal hyperexcitability and increased plasticity that facilitates fear learning.", 
    "91": "This study examined baseline gender differences among HIV-positive methadone maintenance outpatients currently prescribed antiretroviral medications. Participants were enrolled in a larger clinical trial, which included a 4-week observation period using electronic monitors to track medication adherence. Contrary to previous literature, no significant differences were detected between men (n = 42) and women (n = 36) on medication adherence or depression. Both groups showed remarkably poor adherence during baseline (M = 56% of doses taken on time), high overall prevalence of depression (47%) and illicit cocaine use (47%). Women reported significantly more medication side effects (M = 21.4 vs. 14.9), higher severity of ASI psychiatric problems (M = 0.50 vs. 0.40), and lower SF-36 health-related quality of life in physical (M = 42.1 vs. 63.3) and emotional functioning (M = 26.9 vs. 58.9) than men. Women tested positive for opioids at higher rates than men (53% vs. 29%, respectively), whereas men were more likely to be positive for benzodiazepines than women (26% vs. 6%, respectively). Findings suggest that gender differences between male and female methadone maintenance patients have relevance to treatment providers. Extensive assessment, specialized medical care and mental health services may be warranted in the treatment of HIV-positive female drug abusers.", 
    "92": "Repaglinide is an antidiabetic drug metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 and CYP3A4 enzymes. To clarify the mechanisms of observed repaglinide drug interactions, we determined the contribution of the two enzymes to repaglinide metabolism at different substrate concentrations, and examined the effect of fibrates and rifampicin on CYP2C8, CYP3A4 and repaglinide metabolism in vitro. We studied repaglinide metabolism using pooled human liver microsomes, recombinant CYP2C8 and recombinant CYP3A4 enzymes. The effect of quercetin and itraconazole on repaglinide metabolism, and of gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, fenofibrate and rifampicin on CYP2C8 (paclitaxel 6alpha-hydroxylation) and CYP3A4 (midazolam 1-hydroxylation) activities and repaglinide metabolism were studied using human liver microsomes. At therapeutic repaglinide concentrations (<0.4 microM), CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 metabolised repaglinide at similar rates. Quercetin (25 microM) and itraconazole (3 microM) inhibited the metabolism of 0.2 microM repaglinide by 58% and 71%, and that of 2 microM repaglinide by 56% and 59%, respectively. The three fibrates inhibited CYP2C8 (Ki: bezafibrate 9.7 microM, gemfibrozil 30.4 microM and fenofibrate 92.6 microM) and repaglinide metabolism (IC50: bezafibrate 37.7 microM, gemfibrozil 111 microM and fenofibrate 164 microM), but had no effect on CYP3A4. Rifampicin inhibited CYP2C8 (Ki 30.2 microM), CYP3A4 (Ki 18.5 microM) and repaglinide metabolism (IC50 13.7 microM). In conclusion, both CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 are important in the metabolism of therapeutic concentrations of repaglinide in vitro, but their predicted contributions in vivo are highly dependent on the scaling factor used. Gemfibrozil is only a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8 and does not inhibit CYP3A4; inhibition of CYP-enzymes by parent gemfibrozil alone does not explain its interaction with repaglinide in vivo. Rifampicin competitively inhibits both CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, which can counteract its inducing effect in humans.", 
    "93": "Stress and stress hormones affect a variety of behaviors and cognitive abilities. The influences of stress and glucocorticoids on motor function, however, have not been characterized although the presence of glucocorticoid receptors in the motor system has been documented. Here we demonstrate that stress and the stress hormone corticosterone influence motor system function in rats. Groups of adult female Long-Evans rats underwent either a daily stress-inducing procedure (immobilization or swimming in cold water) or oral corticosterone treatment. While these treatments continued, animals were tested in skilled reaching and skilled walking tasks for a period of 2 weeks. Both acute (day 1) and chronic (day 14) stress and corticosterone treatment reduced skilled movement accuracy in reaching and walking and increased performance speed. Furthermore, both chronic stress and chronic corticosterone treatment altered skilled movement patterns in the reaching task. These findings indicate that stress modulates motor system function and that these effects are partially mediated by glucocorticoids. To examine whether stress-induced changes might also derive from enhanced emotionality, rats were treated with the benzodiazepine diazepam. Based on an inverted U-shaped dose-response relationship, a moderate dose of diazepam significantly improved reaching success while at the same time reducing corticosterone levels. Thus, stress-associated emotional responses such as anxiety might account for diminished movement accuracy. These results suggest that stress affects the motor system both directly via hormonal changes and indirectly via changes in emotionality. These findings are discussed with respect to the role of stress in motor system function and movement disorders.", 
    "94": "A post hoc analysis of the SPECTRUM trial was carried out to evaluate whether the improvements in efficacy and tolerability gained on switching to quetiapine occurred consistently for patients previously treated with either: haloperidol (n = 43); olanzapine (n = 66); or risperidone (n = 55) monotherapy. Patients were initiated with quetiapine to 400 mg/day over 7 days, and then flexibly dosed (300-750 mg/day) for 11 weeks. The mean (SD) modal dose of quetiapine was 501 (138) mg/day in the haloperidol subgroup, 472 (147) mg/day in the olanzapine subgroup and 485 (141) mg/day in the risperidone subgroup at the study endpoint. Switching to quetiapine induced significant improvements from baseline in PANSS scores, with least square mean changes in total scores of -32.5, -15.4, and -18.5 for patients previously treated with haloperidol, olanzapine and risperidone, respectively, (all p < 0.001 vs baseline). Significant improvements were also noted in CDSS scores, particularly for patients clinically depressed at baseline (all p < 0.001 vs baseline). There were significant reductions in EPS on the SAS and BAS for all subgroups (all p < 0.001 vs baseline). Switching to quetiapine produced efficacy and tolerability benefits regardless of whether their previous antipsychotic was haloperidol, olanzapine or risperidone.", 
    "95": "A validated method for on-line solid-phase extraction coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-HPLC-MS-MS) is described for the quantification of bromazepam in human plasma. The method involves a dilution of 300 muL of plasma with 100 muL of carbamazepine (2.5 ng/mL), used as internal standard, vortex-mixing, centrifugation, and injection of 100 muL of the supernate. The analytes were ionized using positive electrospray mass spectrometry then detected by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The m/z transitions 316-->182 (bromazepam) and 237-->194 (carbamazepine) were used for quantification. The calibration curve was linear from 1 ng/mL (limit of quantification) to 200 ng/mL. The retention times of bromazepam and carbamazepine were 2.6 and 3.2 minutes, respectively. The intraday and interday precisions were 3.43%-15.45% and 5.2%-17%, respectively. The intraday and interday accuracy was 94.00%-103.94%. This new automated method has been successfully applied in a bioequivalence study of 2 tablet formulations of 6 mg bromazepam: Lexotan(R) from Produtos Roche Qu\u00edmicos e Farmac\u00eauticos SA, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (reference) and test formulation from Laborat\u00f3rios Biosint\u00e9tica Ltda, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Because the 90% CI of geometric mean ratios between reference and test were completely included in the 80%-125% interval, the 2 formulations were considered bioequivalent. The comparison of different experimental conditions for establishing a dissolution profile in vitro along with our bioavailability data further allowed us to propose rationally based experimental conditions for a dissolution test of bromazepam tablets, actually lacking a pharmacopeial monograph.", 
    "96": "Reducing the capacity of a victim to react against sexual assault, coupled with a possible abrupt unconsciousness-inducing effect and ease of administration in spiked drinks, have resulted in the use of sedative agents in cases of drug-facilitated offence. Among these compounds, tetrazepam may impair an individual rapidly. The chances of detecting this substance increase if the most sensitive methods are used and if the biologic matrix that allows the longest possible detection time is available. To document the window of detection of tetrazepam, 50 mg of the drug was administered orally to 2 volunteers, and the following samples were collected: oral fluid (n = 1) over 515 minutes, urine (n = 2) over 236-240 hours, hair (n = 2) 4 weeks after exposure, and beard (n = 1) over 34 days. Tetrazepam was analyzed by LC-MS/MS (Micromass Quattro Micro) after alkalinization and extraction by dichloromethane/diethyl ether in the presence of diazepam-d5, used as internal standard. Reversed-phase separation on an XTerra MS C18 column was achieved in 12 minutes, under gradient conditions. Pseudo-molecular ions selected were m/z 289.2 and 290.2 for tetrazepam and the internal standard (IS), respectively, and the corresponding daughter ions selected were m/z 225.2 and 253.2 for tetrazepam and m/z 154.1 and 198.3 for the IS. Urine tested positive for tetrazepam over 236-240 hours (14-13 ng/mL). Oral fluid tested positive for tetrazepam over 515 minutes (2.5 ng/mL). Tetrazepam was detected in beard over 27 days (6.5 pg/mg). A single tetrazepam dose was detected in hair 4 weeks after intake (123-175 pg/mg). Tetrazepam tested positive over the studied time intervals but would be expected to be detectable for a considerably longer time. Therefore, in cases of drug-facilitated crimes in which tetrazepam is involved, hair and beard analyses can be an important complement to urine analyses to document exposure, particularly if LC-MS/MS is used.",

    "101": "Predictions of intrinsic clearance (CL(int)) from human liver microsomes often underestimate in vivo observations. In this study, a series of five benzodiazepines was used as prototypic CYP3A4 substrates to investigate the prediction of clearance from the less studied alternative in vitro system, cryopreserved human hepatocytes. Formation of the two major metabolites from midazolam, triazolam, diazepam, flunitrazepam, and alprazolam was measured in cryopreserved human hepatocytes from five donors; the kinetics were characterized and CL(int) values were determined and scaled to predict CL(int) in vivo. At least one of the two major pathways of metabolic clearance of each benzodiazepine was characterized by autoactivation in hepatocytes; the extent to which this occurred varied depending on substrate and liver (up to 8-fold). Heteroactivation by testosterone of these pathways was also observed (up to 6-fold). The maximum autoactivated clearance was used to predict in vivo CL(int) (1.6-138 ml/min/kg) which closely agreed with values previously obtained using human liver microsomes. Comparison with in vivo CL(int) indicates that cryopreserved human hepatocytes systematically underpredict CL(int). When three previous studies (documenting CL(int) for substrates of various enzymes in cryopreserved human hepatocytes using drug depletion-time profiles) were considered as well, the combined data show a consistent underprediction of 5.6-fold. Collectively it is demonstrated that the predicted hepatic intrinsic clearances from cryopreserved hepatocytes show an excellent rank order with in vivo findings but are systematically underpredicting the in vivo value.", 
    "102": "This meta-analytic review examines the efficacy of antipsychotic medications in ameliorating schizophrenia-related long-term memory (LTM) impairments. Twenty-three studies were reviewed that compared schizophrenia spectrum patients treated (a) with atypical versus typical antipsychotic medications, or (b) with various atypical treatments. In 17 atypical versus typical trials aggregating 939 participants, superior overall (verbal and nonverbal) LTM was detected in patients assigned to atypical trials. However, this difference was small (effect size estimate (ES) 0.17; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.31) and specific to certain atypical treatments. Relative to typical antipsychotic trials, LTM superiority was marginally significant for risperidone trials (ES 0.20; 95% CI -0.03 to 0.44) and significant for olanzapine trials (ES 0.29; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.49). In contrast, clozapine trials did not produce a LTM advantage over typical trials (ES -0.06; 95% CI -0.35 to 0.23). Due to the lack of available studies, the effect of quetiapine was indeterminate. Direct comparison between atypical trials revealed a similar effect pattern. A marginally significant superiority in overall LTM was detected for risperidone and olanzapine compared to clozapine (ES 0.28; 95% CI -0.04 to 0.59), which reached significance for verbal LTM (ES 0.36; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.67). Finally, the beneficial impact of antipsychotic medications emerged as a function of differences in the anticholinergic properties of the treatment arms being compared.", 
    "103": "Accepted clinical evidence suggests superior efficacy of novel antipsychotics in the treatment of cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia. Whether this constitutes a primary drug effect or a secondary effect due to easing extrapyramidal side-effects or improving positive symptoms when converting from a first- to a second-generation neuroleptic is still open to debate. Long-term efficacy as well as differential drug effects on cognitive performance are also poorly documented. We therefore compared cognitive performance of olanzapine vs. clozapine treatment in a controlled, randomized, double-blind trial. Fifty-four patients were assessed following a 2- to 9-day washout and again after 4 and 26 wk of neuroleptic treatment. Patients were rated on the PANSS for psychopathological changes, extrapyramidal side-effects were assessed on the Simpson-Angus Scale, and cognitive performance was assessed with the Stroop, Wisconsin Card Sorting and the Tower of London tests. Schizophrenia symptoms, extrapyramidal side-effects and cognitive performance improved significantly in the course of either drug treatment. Stroop test performance and Tower of London planning time improved significantly over 26 wk compared to baseline and 4-wk follow-up assessment while Wisconsin Card Sorting and Tower of London execution time improved significantly after 4 wk with no further improvement after 26 wk. Improved executive function was not related to improving positive symptoms and easing extrapyramidal side-effects, thus indicative of a primary treatment effect of either antipsychotic. However, Stroop reaction time improved with olanzapine while clozapine had a stronger effect on improving negative symptoms, thus suggestive of a differential drug effect.",

The origin of the developmental acceleration of AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) remains elusive. We used patch-clamp recordings, electron microscopic immunogold localization of AMPARs, partial three-dimensional reconstruction of the neuropil and numerical simulations of glutamate diffusion and AMPAR activation to examine the factors underlying the developmental speeding of miniature EPSCs in mouse cerebellar granule cells. We found that the main developmental change that permits submillisecond transmission at mature synapses is an alteration in the glutamate concentration waveform as experienced by AMPARs. This can be accounted for by changes in the synaptic structure and surrounding neuropil, rather than by a change in AMPAR properties. Our findings raise the possibility that structural alterations could be a general mechanism underlying the change in the time course of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission.",

The time to the discontinuation of treatment for any cause was significantly longer in the olanzapine group than in the quetiapine (P<0.001) or risperidone (P=0.002) group, but not in the perphenazine (P=0.021) or ziprasidone (P=0.028) group. The times to discontinuation because of intolerable side effects were similar among the groups, but the rates differed (P=0.04); olanzapine was associated with more discontinuation for weight gain or metabolic effects, and perphenazine was associated with more discontinuation for extrapyramidal effects.", 
    "119": "The majority of patients in each group discontinued their assigned treatment owing to inefficacy or intolerable side effects or for other reasons. Olanzapine was the most effective in terms of the rates of discontinuation, and the efficacy of the conventional antipsychotic agent perphenazine appeared similar to that of quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone. Olanzapine was associated with greater weight gain and increases in measures of glucose and lipid metabolism.", 
    "120": "This investigation determined the ability of alfentanil miosis and single-point concentrations to detect various degrees of CYP3A inhibition. Results were compared with those for midazolam, an alternative CYP3A probe. Twelve volunteers were studied in a randomized 4-way crossover, targeting 12%, 25%, and 50% inhibition of hepatic CYP3A. They received 0, 100, 200, or 400 mg oral fluconazole, followed 1 hour later by 1 mg intravenous midazolam and then 15 microg/kg intravenous alfentanil 1 hour later. The next day, they received fluconazole, followed by 3 mg oral midazolam and 40 microg/kg oral alfentanil. Dark-adapted pupil diameters were measured coincident with blood sampling. Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) ratios (fluconazole/control) after 100, 200, and 400 mg fluconazole were (geometric mean) 1.3*, 1.4*, and 2.0* for intravenous midazolam and 1.2*, 1.6*, and 2.2* for intravenous alfentanil (*significantly different from control), indicating 16% to 21%, 31% to 36%, and 43% to 53% inhibition of hepatic CYP3A. Single-point concentration ratios were 1.5*, 1.8*, and 2.4* for intravenous midazolam (at 5 hours) and 1.2*, 1.6*, and 2.2* for intravenous alfentanil (at 4 hours). Pupil miosis AUC ratios were 0.9, 1.0, and 1.2*. After oral dosing, plasma AUC ratios were 2.3*, 3.6*, and 5.3* for midazolam and 1.8*, 2.9*, and 4.9* for alfentanil; plasma single-point ratios were 2.4*, 4.5*, and 6.9* for midazolam and 1.8*, 2.9*, and 4.9* for alfentanil, and alfentanil miosis ratios were 1.1, 1.9*, and 2.7*. Plasma concentration AUC ratios of alfentanil and midazolam were equivalent for detecting hepatic and first-pass CYP3A inhibition. Single-point concentrations were an acceptable surrogate for formal AUC determinations and as sensitive as AUCs for detecting CYP3A inhibition. Alfentanil miosis could detect 50% to 70% inhibition of CYP3A activity, but was less sensitive than plasma AUCs. Further refinements are needed to increase the sensitivity of alfentanil miosis for detecting small CYP3A changes.",

    "133": "Objective sleep was measured by an 8-channel polysomnograph; subjective sleep was measured using the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire. Compared with placebo, pregabalin significantly increased slow-wave sleep both as a proportion of the total sleep period and the duration of stage 4 sleep. Alprazolam significantly reduced slow-wave sleep. Pregabalin and alprazolam produced modest, but significant, reductions in sleep-onset latency compared with placebo. Rapid eye movement sleep latency after pregabalin was no different than placebo but was significantly shorter than that found with alprazolam. Although there were no differences between the active treatments, both pregabalin and alprazolam reduced rapid eye movement sleep as a proportion of the total sleep period compared with placebo. Pregabalin also significantly reduced the number of awakenings of more than 1 minute in duration. Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire ratings of the ease of getting to sleep and the perceived quality of sleep were significantly improved following both active treatments, and ratings of behavior following awakening were significantly impaired by both drug treatments.",

Analysis of participant-rated measures collected 24 h after drug administration (next-day; assessing the overall effects of the drug received 24 h earlier) indicated that flunitrazepam, but neither triazolam dose, produced significant increases relative to placebo in next-day ratings of drug liking, the amount of money the drug would be worth on the street, and the amount of money the participant would be willing to pay for the drug on the street. Importantly, these abuse liability differences between flunitrazepam and triazolam were present at a dose of flunitrazepam (6 mg/70 kg) that produced overall drug effects that were comparable to, or significantly less than, those of a high triazolam dose (2 mg/70 kg). Consistent with results of a previous study in our laboratory, these results suggest that flunitrazepam may have a greater abuse liability than triazolam, and that this abuse liability difference emerges on measures taken 24 h after drug administration but not on same-day measures.",

    "144": "Many adverse drug reactions are caused by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) dependent activation of drugs into reactive metabolites. In order to reduce attrition due to metabolism-mediated toxicity and to improve safety of drug candidates, we developed two in vitro cell-based assays by combining an activating system (human CYP3A4) with target cells (HepG2 cells): in the first method we incubated microsomes containing cDNA-expressed CYP3A4 together with HepG2 cells; in the second approach HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with CYP3A4. In both assay systems, CYP3A4 catalyzed metabolism was found to be comparable to the high levels reported in hepatocytes. Both assay systems were used to study ten CYP3A4 substrates known for their potential to form metabolites that exhibit higher toxicity than the parent compounds. Several endpoints of toxicity were evaluated, and the measurement of MTT reduction and intracellular ATP levels were selected to assess cell viability. Results demonstrated that both assay systems are capable to metabolize the test compounds leading to increased toxicity, compared to their respective control systems. The co-incubation with the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole confirmed that the formation of reactive metabolites was CYP3A4 dependent. To further validate the functionality of the two assay systems, they were also used as a \"detoxification system\" using selected compounds that can be metabolized by CYP3A4 to metabolites less toxic than their parent compounds. These results show that both assay systems can be used to screen for metabolic activation, or de-activation, which may be useful as a rapid and relatively inexpensive in vitro assay for the prediction of CYP3A4 metabolism-mediated toxicity.", 
    "145": "Munchausen syndrome by proxy is a subtle and difficult to diagnose form of child abuse in which the carer (usually the mother) simulates, manipulates or produces symptoms of illness in the victim. In most cases the detrimental effect is caused by applying foreign substances or by airway obstruction. In the presented case a 20-month-old girl developed a spreading soft-tissue infection resistant to treatment on the left upper arm after vaccination, which required a number of surgical interventions. Repeatedly, microorganisms from the intestinal flora were isolated from the wound secretion. After the girl suffered respiratory and circulatory arrest, which required resuscitation measures, chemical toxicological tests revealed not medically prescribed benzodiazepines in serum and urine. When the mother, a trained nurse, was confronted with the allegation to have manipulated the symptoms of the illness she committed suicide. The forensic autopsy of the suicide produced numerous hints suggesting chronic self-damaging behaviour described as Munchausen syndrome. This case shows a number of manipulation forms with the maintenance of a chronic skin and soft tissue infection belonging to the rarer forms of inflicting damage to the child. It also illustrates that confrontation with the allegation of Munchausen syndrome by proxy creates a very stressful emotional situation that may lead to a suicidal act.", 
    "146": "Caloporoside is a natural active fungal metabolite, which was isolated from Caloporous dichrous and was described to exhibit antibacterial, antifungal and phospholipase C inhibitory activity. We have previously reported evidence that related beta-linked compounds, lactose and octyl-beta-d-mannoside, bind and functionally modulate rodent GABA(A) receptors, respectively. We have characterized the binding pharmacology of synthetic caloporoside and two further congeners, 2-hydroxy-6-([(16R)-(beta-d-mannopyranosyloxy)heptadecyl]) benzoic acid and octyl-beta-d-glucoside on GABA(A) receptors using a [35S]-t-butylbicyclophosphoorothionate (TBPS) radioligand binding assay. Caloporoside and 2-hydroxy-6-([(16R)-(beta-d-mannopyranosyloxy)heptadecyl]) benzoic acid produced concentration-dependent complete inhibition of specific [35S] TBPS binding with overall apparent IC50 values of 14.7+/-0.1 and 14.2+/-0.1 microM, respectively. In contrast, octyl-beta-d-glucoside elicited a concentration-dependent stimulation of specific [35S] TBPS binding (E(max)=144+/-4%; EC50=39.2+/-22.7 nM). The level of stimulation was similar to that elicited by diazepam (E(max)=147+/-6%; EC50=0.8+/-0.1 nM), and was occluded by GABA (0.3 microM). However, the three test compounds failed to elicit any significant effect (positive or negative) upon [3H] flunitrazepam or [3H] muscimol binding, indicating that they did not bind directly, or allosterically couple, to the benzodiazepine or agonist binding site of the GABA(A) receptor, respectively. The constituent monosaccharide, glucose, and both the closely related congeners octyl-beta-d-glucoside or hexyl-beta-d-glucoside have no significant effect upon [35S] TBPS binding. These data, together, provide strong evidence that a beta-glycosidic linkage and chain length are crucial for the positive modulation of [35S] TBPS binding to the GABA(A) receptor by this novel chemical class.", 
    "147": "In order to adapt their behavior to different unexpected situations, humans need to be able to monitor their performance and detect and correct errors. Benzodiazepines have long been shown to impair performance in humans, but the performance-related neurophysiological processes targeted by these drugs remain largely unknown. In the present article, we assessed the impact of alprazolam administration on relevant aspects of action monitoring, i.e., the monitoring of response conflict and the detection and correction of errors by means of neurophysiological measures. Multichannel event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded to assess the impact of the benzodiazepine alprazolam (0.25 mg and 1.00 mg) on action monitoring and motor preparation in a group of twelve healthy male volunteers who participated in a double-blind cross-over placebo-controlled clinical trial involving a letter flanker task. Error detection was evaluated using the error-related negativity (ERN); response conflict on correct trials was measured by means of the N2 amplitude difference between congruent and incongruent trials; motor preparation was assessed by means of the lateralized readiness potentials (LRPs); and post-error adjustments were assessed by measuring post-error slowing in reaction time. Alprazolam significantly reduced the amplitude of the ERN and the number of corrective responses and increased reaction time and LRP latencies. The drug had no effect on amplitude differences in the N2 component between congruent and incongruent trials or on post-error slowing. Thus, alprazolam was shown to affect brain correlates of error detection (ERN) and motor preparation (LRPs), while it did not disturb conflict monitoring on correct trials (N2) or post-error adjustments of behavior.", 
    "148": "The knockout mouse for the beta3 subunit of the GABAA receptor exhibits spontaneous epilepsy and hyperactivity, and has been proposed as a model for the severe developmental disorder, Angelman's syndrome, which is known to be of genetic origin. We have used this mutant to test an approach of therapeutic intervention prior to seizure onset by daily injection with diazepam during either the first or second postnatal week. Results showed differences between postnatal week 1 and week 2 injections both acutely, with respect to sedative effects, and in long-term outcome, with respect to EEG and behavioral tests measured at 12-14 weeks of age. The EEG of control mice remained unaffected under all conditions, but the EEG of beta3 (-/-) injected with diazepam in week 1 was worsened, showing increased oscillatory activity at 5-6Hz, and more myoclonic jerks, particularly among males. For beta3 (-/-) injected with diazepam in week 2, the EEG was normalized in half the mice but worsened similarly to week 1 in the other half. Neonatal diazepam injection had a long-term normalizing effect on behavior of beta3 (-/-) mice injected in week 1, but diazepam treatment in week 2 did not affect the hyperactive and circling behavior characteristic of the beta3 knockout mouse. Diazepam treatment in postnatal week 2 significantly decreased anxiety in the adult beta3 group. Diazepam treatment in both postnatal weeks 1 and 2 improved the motor coordination of beta3 (-/-) on the rotarod, although performance of control mice injected with diazepam in postnatal week 2 was significantly impaired. The observed long-term outcome of neonatal diazepam injections may result from interference with developmental processes, and shows that enhancing GABAergic activity with diazepam during the period where GABA can be excitatory can produce narrow stage-related effects on brain development.", 
    "149": "In South Africa Rhus pyroides is traditionally used in the treatment of epilepsy. In the present study two biflavonoids with activity in the (3)H-Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil) binding assay were isolated by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation of the ethanol extract of the leaves from Rhus pyroides. The structures of the two biflavonoids were elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) to be agathisflavone and amentoflavone. Agathisflavone and amentoflavone competitively inhibited the binding of (3)H-Ro 15-1788 with a K(i) of 28 and 37 nM, respectively. Extracts of Rhus dentata and Rhus pentheri were not as active as the extract from Rhus pyroides; both were found to contain apigenin and agathisflavone. The monomer apigenin, agathisflavone and amentoflavone were fitted into a pharmacophore model for ligands binding to the GABA(A) receptor benzodiazepine site. This reflected the affinities of the compounds in the [(3)H]-flumazenil binding assay.", 
    "150": "Although the role of orexins in sleep/wake cycle and feeding behavior is well established, underlying mechanisms have not been fully understood. An attempt has been made to investigate the role of GABA(A) receptors and their benzodiazepine site on the orexin-A induced response to feeding. Different groups of rats were food deprived overnight and next day injected intracerebroventricularly (icv) with vehicle (artificial CSF; 5 microl/rat) or orexin-A (20-50 nM/rat) and the animals were given free access to food. Cumulative food intake was measured during light phase of light/dark cycle at 1-, 2-, 4- and 6-h post-injection time points. Orexin-A (30-50 nM/rat, icv) stimulated food intake at all the time points (P < 0.05). Prior administration of GABA(A) receptor agonists muscimol (25 ng/rat, icv) and diazepam (0.5 mg/kg, ip) at subeffective doses significantly potentiated the hyperphagic effect of orexin-A (30 nM/rat, icv). However, the effect was negated by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline (1 mg/kg, ip). Interestingly, benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (5 ng/rat, icv), augmented the orexin-A (30 nM/rat, icv) induced hyperphagia; the effect may be attributed to the intrinsic activity of the agent. The results suggest that the hyperphagic effect of orexin-A, at least in part, is mediated by enhanced GABA(A) receptor activity.", 
    "151": "We evaluated the diagnostic performance of Triage for benzodiazepines in 74 urine specimens from outpatients given therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines and compared the results of EMIT assays. Results obtained in all urine samples were confirmed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Overall agreement between results of Triage and EMIT assays was 73%. All of the Triage-positive samples were also positive by EMIT assays. Results of Triage and EMIT assays were different for 20 samples obtained from patients given thienodiazepines (etizolam, brotizolam, and clotiazepam) and nitrobenzodiazepines (nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, and clonazepam). LC-MS confirmed parent drugs in urine specimens, consistent with the prescriptions of drugs. The low agreement between Triage and EMIT results in this study might be due to low sensitivity of Triage for thienodiazepines. Thienodiazines are frequently prescribed benzodiazepines, and Triage panel is the most frequently used screening kit in Japan. It should be noted that negative results obtained by a Triage test might not mean the absence of thienodiazepines.", 
    "152": "There are three different approaches in the pharmacological treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the published data. The most frequently implemented approach is to treat patients suffering from the diagnosis of PTSD. Both short-term acute and long-term relapse prevention treatments represent a curative paradigm: with an intention to diminish the symptoms associated with the disorder. Data about efficacy of monoamine oxidase inhibitors and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of PTSD are heterogeneous. Data are relatively consistent with regards of efficacy of SSRIs in the treatment of civilian, predominantly female population, regardless of the type of trauma: interpersonal or non-interpersonal trauma. Placebo controlled trial data in the treatment of combat-related PTSD are inconclusive or negative. Three recently published studies provide new approaches to the treatment of male patients, suffering from combat-related PTSD. A relatively young, recently traumatized male, combat-related population showed significant improvement for fluoxetine compared to placebo. An adjuvant 5HT2 antagonist profile may improve the SSRI effect in the treatment of PTSD: nefazodone was significantly superior compared to placebo in the treatment of combat-related PTSD, and risperidone treatment add-on to antidepressants showed significant benefits compared to antidepressant monotherapy in the treatment of combat-related PTSD. The goal of sedative paradigm is to minimize the immediate consequences of the traumatic stress, decrease the fear, anxiety and sleeplessness. Data published about benzodiazepines failed to show effectiveness in the acute management of post-traumatic mental consequences. The intention of the third treatment paradigm is characterized by the secondary prevention of PTSD. Benzodiazepines administered shortly after the traumatic event, failed to prevent the mental consequences of traumatic stress. Two small trials with propranolol administration after the trauma have been shown some benefits compared to placebo or no treatment. PTSD represents a complex disregulation of numerous neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, therefore the complex pharmacological treatment has to consider approaches beyond the current treatment regimens characterized by modulation of monoamine neurotransmission.",

    "157": "Following changes in the safety information on the use of risperidone and olanzapine in elderly patients with dementia, data from prescription-event monitoring (PEM) studies of risperidone, quetiapine and olanzapine were examined. The aim was to compare incidence rates for events reported as cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) during the first 180 days of treatment in patients prescribed atypical antipsychotics for dementia or other indications, because of the possible association between dementia and stroke in users of atypical antipsychotics. A retrospective analysis of data from the three observational studies was conducted using Poisson regression modelling and survival analysis. Within the risperidone, quetiapine and olanzapine cohorts, 23 (0.30%), 6 (0.35%) and 10 (0.11%) patients respectively, were reported to have had a CVA/TIA event. Age, sex and indication (dementia or other) were identified as important confounding variables; age being the most important. The crude rate ratios (RRs) for CVA/TIA for risperidone or quetiapine vs. olanzapine indicated an approximate threefold relative difference in rate during the first six months but after adjustment for age, sex and indication, the RRs were non-significant (1.2 (95% CI 0.5,3.0) and 2.1 (95% CI 0.6,7.7), respectively). For risperidone vs. quetiapine, crude and adjusted RRs were not significantly different. Of the three drugs, the time to event was shortest for risperidone and also shortest for risperidone or quetiapine users where the indication was dementia. The age and sex adjusted RR of CVA/TIA in patients prescribed risperidone for dementia vs. other indications was 6.7 (95% CI 2.4,18.9). The adjusted RRs for quetiapine, according to indication, could not be calculated due to missing information on age and sex. There were no cases of CVA/TIA with dementia for olanzapine, thus the RRs and time to event curves according to indication could not be examined. This study revealed no significant difference in the adjusted RR of CVA/TIA events in the first 180 days of treatment in patients prescribed risperidone or quetiapine when compared with olanzapine. However, dementia appears to be an important risk factor. These results should be considered alongside other pharmacoepidemiological studies on this topic.", 
    "158": "The sensitization of animal models of anxiety is of great importance to detect potential anxiolytic drugs. Our goal was to evaluate the influence of manipulations of the light/dark cycle on the basal anxious behaviour of mice and the efficacy of two anxiolytic treatments in the mouse elevated plus maze (EPM). Male Swiss mice were exposed to different conditions of illumination for one week prior to testing. In the first experiment of the study, we evaluated the anxiolytic effects of diazepam, at the dose of 1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered 30 min before the test. In the second experiment, we examined the effects of WAY 100635, a 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, at the doses of 0.03 and 2 mg/kg, i.p. administered 30 min before the test. The locomotor activity of control mice and the anxiolytic efficacy of diazepam in the EPM were not affected by manipulation of the light/dark cycle. Conversely, the effects of WAY 100635, which were qualitatively different from those of diazepam, seemed to be influenced by the illumination conditions imposed before the test. We can conclude that diazepam's effect, which is characterized by a strong \"disinhibition\", was more robust than the 5-HT(1A) antagonist's effect, which was more anxioselective. Moreover, the light conditions imposed on mice before the test may be an important factor in the variability of the response to serotonergic but not to benzodiazepine treatments.",

The authors present a new case report that took place in the French Catalonia: an 8 year-old boy developed vomiting and generalized recurrent convulsions after ingestion of C. myrtifolia berries. He needed repeated diazepam administrations and was managed in the hospital. He recovered after one day of benzodiazepine treatment. In order to evaluate the consequences of C. myrtifolia poisoning, 83 cases of the literature were analyzed: the cases occurred in three countries (Spain, France and Morocco); the mean delay of the symptom development was 150 min; the neurological disturbances were the most frequent signs and 11 patients died (6 children, 5 adults) mainly in old reports.", 
    "160": "Scientific interest in saliva as a diagnostic matrix has greatly increased over the last decade. The Triage screening test (Biosite Diagnostics), a rapid immunological test used to detect recreational drugs in the urine, was used to compare two biological matrixes: a non-conventional one, saliva, and a traditional one, urine. Twenty-one drug abusers collected one urine and one saliva specimen, both of which were tested with the Triage kit. Data were validated by gas-chromatography-mass-spectrometry (GC-MS). Results were positive for methadone in 9 saliva and 14 urine specimens, for opiates in 2 and 10, respectively, and for barbiturates in 2 specimens. Saliva specimens were negative for cannabis, THC, benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants, although the GC-MS analysis revealed low concentrations of these drugs in the saliva. The study demonstrates the possibility of using saliva as a diagnostic matrix to test for drug-taking; however, the Triage kit must be improved before being used with saliva.",

    "162": "A double-blind dose-finding study using the continual reassessment method, a Bayesian sequential design. Twenty-three newborn infants hospitalized in intensive care unit participated. Inclusion criteria were: (i) post-natal age <28 days, (ii) gestational age >33 weeks, (iii) intubation and ventilatory support required for respiratory distress syndrome, (iv) need for sedation (i.e. one of the six following criteria: agitation or grimacing or crying facial expression before tracheal suctioning, agitation or grimacing or crying facial expression during tracheal suctioning). Each neonate was allocated to a loading dose, ranging from 75 to 200 microg/kg, and a maintenance dose ranging from 37.5 to 100 microg/kg/h.", 
    "163": "The primary endpoint was the level of sedation 1 h after the onset of infusion. The sedation procedure was classified as a success if all the following clinical criteria were met: no agitation, no grimacing and no crying facial expression before as well as during tracheal suctioning. Based on the 23 patients, the final estimated probability of success was 76.9% (95% credibility interval: 56.6-91.4%) for the 200 microg/kg loading dose. no significant adverse effect was observed.", 
    "164": "Continual reassessment is a new approach, suitable for dose-finding study in neonates. this method overcomes some of the ethical, statistical and practical problems associated with this population. Using this method, the MED was estimated to be the 200 mug/kg loading dose of midazolam.", 
    "165": "This study aimed to evaluate the impact, in a regional setting, of a multi-strategic partnership approach for reducing benzodiazepine use in the management of insomnia, as recommended in Australia's National Policy on Quality Use of Medicines.", 
    "166": "The setting was a rural region of South Australia, covering approximately 2000 km2, with a population of over 20 000. The study involved participatory action research, with qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The intervention involved a multi-strategic approach, including provision of treatment guidelines, provision of consumer information, a local media campaign and education and training of health professionals. The quantitative evaluation involved a single region before/after study with 2 years of follow-up using pharmacy-based dispensing data for benzodiazepines and antidepressants, gathered for the months of November to April in 1998/99 ('before' period) through to 2000/01 ('after' period). The data were analysed using non-parametric statistics.", 
    "167": "There was a 19% reduction in benzodiazepine dispensing 2 years after the intervention compared with a 6% reduction nationally. Dispensing of antidepressants increased by 33%, compared with a 28% increase nationally.", 
    "168": "It was concluded that the multi-strategic approach to the management of sleep disorders proved successful in promoting the use of non-drug alternatives, achieving sustained reduction in benzodiazepine consumption in a rural community, without therapeutic substitution of antidepressants.", 
    "169": "The study demonstrated that a sustainable reduction in prescribing of benzodiazepines can be achieved through the implementation of a multi-strategic approach involving local consumers, health professionals, a Division of General Practice, a government department, aged-care facilities and the local media.", 
    "170": "We investigated the sequence of the administration, the efficacy and the safety of antiepileptic drugs (AED) given intravenously for the treatment of status epilepticus and frequent seizures in children. Our institute has a recommended sequence of AED administration for treatment of status epilepticus: the first-line agent is diazepam (0.3 - 0.5 mg/kg administered intravenously, once or twice). The second-line drugs include midazolam (0.15 - 0.4 mg/kg intravenously, once or twice, and if necessary, followed by continuous infusion at 0.06 - 0.18 mg/kg/hour), lidocaine (1 - 2 mg/kg intravenously, once or twice, and if necessary, followed by continuous infusion at 2 - 4 mg/kg/hour) and phenytoin (10 - 20 mg/kg, infused slowly). For those patients who previously experienced a seizure which was refractory to diazepam but responsive to the second-line agent, it was recommended to use the second-line agent as a first-line agent. When seizures were refractory to the first and second-line agents, thiopental was administered (3 - 10 mg/kg intravenously, and if necessary, followed by continuous infusion at 2 -5 mg/kg/hour). The etiologies of 177 occasions of status epilepticus and frequent seizures were categorized into two groups:epilepsy (n = 95) and situation-related seizures (n = 82). Situation-related seizures included febrile seizures (n = 44), acute encephalopathy/encephalitis (n = 31) and benign infantile convulsions (n = 7). The ages of the patients ranged from 0.1 to 18.4 years (average +/- SD:3.69 +/- 3.15 years). Diazepam was administered as the first-line drug on 157 of 177 occasions (88.7%). On 116 occasions the second-line agents were administered. Midazolam and lidocaine were injected as the second-line agent on 54 (46.6%), and on 33 (28.4%) occasions, respectively, although both midazolam and lidocaine injections were off-label use for seizure control in Japan. Thiopental was used as the third to fifth-line agent. Effective ratios (effective occasions/total occasions) of each drug were the following: thiopental 19/21 (90.4%), midazolam 57/99 (57.6%), lidocaine 25/60 (41.7%), phenytoin 16/41 (39.0%), diazepam 59/164 (36.0%). Thiopental was statistically more effective than midazolam, lidocaine, diazepam or phenytoin (p < 0.01), and midazolam was statistically more effective than diazepam (p < 0.01) or phenytoin (p < 0.05). Administration of thiopental caused complications more frequently than the other agents (p < 0.01): The complications by thiopental were severe in some cases requiring intratracheal intubations and artificial ventilation. From the viewpoint of both efficacy and safety, midazolam should be recommended as one of the first-line agents for status epilepticus.", 
    "171": "We examined efficacy of continuous midazolam (MDL) infusion in seven episodes of refractory nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) in five children. Diagnosis included Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (two cases), and symptomatic generalized epilepsy, ring chromosome 20 syndrome, and epilepsy with continuous spike-waves during slow-wave sleep (one case each). One patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and another with ring chromosome 20 syndrome had two episodes of NCSE. MDL was given as an initial bolus of 0.15 to 0.3 mg/kg, followed by continuous intravenous infusion at 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg/hr. The infusion rate was increased slowly by 0.1 mg/kg/hr every 0.5 to 1.0 hr, up to 0.4 mg/kg/hr or until NCSE was controlled. The electroencephalogram, vital signs, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation were monitored during therapy. Electrical status epilepticus was abolished within a few hours in five of the seven episodes, and two patients could maintain wakefulness, oral intake, and bowel and bladder control throughout the continuous infusion. In one patient in whom NCSE recurred, it then remained uncontrolled even at a maximum dose. Serious complications such as respiratory depression or hypotension were not observed. Continuous intravenous infusion of MDL was effective and safe for NCSE in children, and can be used as firstline therapy for this condition.", 
    "172": "There are few real life independent comparative studies of atypical antipsychotics. We prospectively examined five commonly used atypical antipychotics in the UK, without support from the pharmaceutical industry.", 
    "173": "Prospective naturalistic systematic clinical evaluation. Patients being newly prescribed atypical anti-psychotics over a one year period were assessed by psychiatrists at initiation and after six months treatment using five outcome measures: clinical global impression; positive and negative psychotic symptoms; drug related side effects; and quality of life.", 
    "174": "373 patients participated in total. Olanzapine and risperidone produced statistically significant reductions in all ratings at six months. Amisulpride, clozapine, and quetiapine were also studied. There was limited variance between the different drugs, although some sample sizes were small.", 
    "175": "Atypical anti-psychotics were found to be clinically effective, and produced similar outcomes. Routine monitoring of outcomes in psychiatry is feasible.", 
    "176": "The ease of endotracheal intubation has been recently shown to affect the incidence of laryngeal injury. There remains controversy as to whether or not a muscle relaxant is routinely required for tracheal intubation. This study examined conditions of intubation in our routine practice, which employs a relaxant-sparing approach.", 
    "177": "All adult patients scheduled for surgery with general anaesthesia were prospectively included. A muscle relaxant was used to facilitate intubation when it was required for the surgical procedure and/or otherwise regarded as necessary by the anaesthesiologist. In the remaining patients, a relaxant-free intubation was performed. Intubating conditions were evaluated in all the patients as well as the post-intubation laryngeal symptoms.", 
    "178": "Between March and July 2003, 612 patients were consecutively included. A muscle relaxant was used in 32% of patients and no relaxant in the remaining patients (68%). Clinically acceptable intubating scores were observed in 98.4% overall with no significant difference between the two groups. Excellent conditions occurred more frequently in the relaxant group as compared to the relaxant-free group, 87% vs. 72%, P = 0.005. Laryngeal symptoms occurred in 184 (33%) patients with no difference between the two groups.", 
    "179": "Our relaxant-sparing approach did not increase the incidence of poor conditions of intubation nor laryngeal symptoms. However, excellent conditions occurred more frequently in the relaxant group. A more flexible approach to the issue of the need for neuromuscular blockade prior to intubation is proposed."
