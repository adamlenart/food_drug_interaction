This is followed by reductions of dopamine D2-mediated behavior and dopamine D2 receptors. In this study we attempted to determine if it is possible to inhibit the acute increase in D2-mediated behavior while still allowing the reduction of D2-mediated behavioral responses and dopamine D2 receptors to occur. Mice were implanted with Alzet minipumps containing either quinpirole alone or quinpirole combined with the GABA receptor modulator triazolam or the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride, and rotational behavior was monitored for the 6 days of infusion. The pumps were then removed, and D2 receptors in striatal membranes were determined. Triazolam completely blocked the initial rotational behavior normally induced by implanting quinpirole. However, the quinpirole-induced reduction of D2-mediated behavioral responses and D2 receptors still occurred. Continuous infusion of sulpiride also inhibited the rotational behavior produced by quinpirole, but it prevented the reduction of dopamine D2 receptors. We conclude that up-regulated dopamine receptors and dopaminergic behaviors can be reversed by the continuous administration of a dopamine receptor agonist and that this reversal can occur without producing an initial exacerbation of dopaminergic responses. These results suggest that this type of treatment regimen might be useful for treating clinical conditions associated with dopaminergic supersensitivity.", 
    "1": "Some strains of rats and mice express increased momentary fear or emotionality when exposed to a novel environment. Previous studies have found significantly fewer diazepam binding sites in the brains of Balb/cJ mice compared to C57BL and AKR/J mice and this has been suggested to contribute to the increased emotionally of the 'nervous' Balb strain. The influx of 36Cl into cerebral cortical microsacs was used to functionally assess the effects of GABA, diazepam and pentobarbital in the Balb mice compared to nonemotional animals (C57 and ICR mice). Slight differences in the ability of GABA to increase chloride influx were found among the three strains. Pentobarbital potentiation of GABA-mediated chloride flux was slightly higher in the ICR mice compared to Balb and C57. Diazepam potentiation of the effects of GABA, however, was significantly decreased in the Balb mice, strengthening the hypothesis that the benzodiazepine receptor is involved in mediating animal emotionality.", 
    "2": "The C3-substituted benzodiazepines derived from asperlicin, e.g. devazepide (L-364,718, MK-329), constitute the most potent class of cholecystokinin A-type (CCKA) receptor antagonists. In order to gain insight into the prerequisites for binding, we examined the conformational properties of both potent and weak representatives of this class with computer assisted molecular modelling (CAMM) techniques. The CAMM results indicate that the binding site for the C3-substituents is a planar slot on the CCKA receptor surface and, in addition, allow the proposal of a model which describes the relative binding mode of the less potent R isomers versus that of the S isomers. The latter model illustrates the unique spatial properties of the benzodiazepine moiety, which we suggest functions primarily as an invertible core which assures an optimal arrangement of attached substituents.", 
    "3": "We have previously reported [(1991) EMBO J. 10, 3239-3245] the sequence of an invertebrate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A (GABAA) receptor polypeptide which forms homo-oligomeric GABA-gated, bicuculline-sensitive, chloride-ion channels upon heterologous expression. We now demonstrate that the benzodiazepines Ro5-4864 (4'-chlorodiazepam) and diazepam, that are active at mammalian peripheral benzodiazepine sites, and not those benzodiazepines specific for central sites, directly active the homo-oligomeric receptor and evoke larger maximal responses than those elicited by GABA. In addition, members of the cyclodiene class of insecticides block the channel of the receptor in a manner indistinguishable from that of picrotoxin.", 
    "4": "Changes in gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor function have been observed following chronic benzodiazepine administration. The molecular mechanisms responsible are unknown, but one possibility is that benzodiazepines induce alterations in the expression of genes which encode subunits of the GABAA receptor complex, resulting in changes in the receptor structure and function. We have investigated this hypothesis by evaluating the effect of flurazepam 40 mg/kg i.p. on brain levels of the mRNAs which encode the alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, and alpha 6 subunits of the GABAA receptor complex. Rats were treated with flurazepam or vehicle for up to 32 days. No changes were found in the levels of alpha 1 and alpha 2 mRNA. A rapid decrease was found in the level of alpha 5 mRNA; alpha 3 mRNA was increased by 4 days of treatment and this was followed by an increase in alpha 6 levels. These results support the hypothesis that the alteration in GABAA receptor function after benzodiazepine administration results from changes in subunit gene expression. Furthermore, the predicted consequences of the pattern of mRNA changes we have observed suggest that altered gene expression may be important in the genesis of benzodiazepine tolerance.",

    "13": "Peptide YY (PYY), a 36 amino acid peptide, is a member of the structurally and functionally related pancreatic polypeptide (PP) family of gastrointestinal and neurally active peptides. Peptide YY is released postprandially from the distal small intestine and colon and has been shown to inhibit many physiologic actions of cholecystokinin (CCK), an integral foregut hormonal stimulant of pancreatic and gastric secretion. The specific signals for the release of PYY have not been ascertained, although foregut signals, both neural and hormonal, are likely. In this study, we evaluated the possible role for CCK in postprandial PYY release in eight conscious dogs. Conscious dogs were given a fat meal or a one hour intravenous infusion of CCK-8. On separate days, the dogs were pretreated with the specific CCK receptor antagonist L-364,718. Peripheral blood samples were collected for radioimmunoassay for PYY, PP and neuropeptide Y. The fat meal and exogenous CCK stimulated PYY and PP release, effects that were abolished by pretreatment with the CCK receptor antagonist. The results provide support for a physiologic role of CCK in the mediation of postprandial PYY and PP release. Furthermore, an inhibitory feedback loop is suggested between the hindgut (PYY) and the foregut (CCK).",

When sleep medication users were categorized as either \"hypnotic users\" (ie, users of medication with recognized hypnotic or sedative actions) or \"other users\" (including analgesics and other over-the-counter medicines), only \"other users\" showed significant excess mortality (chi-square = 7.27, df = 1, P = 0.007).

    "20": "Earlier reported relationships between excess mortality and use of medication for sleep are replicated in this study. Among elderly people, however, this relationship does not derive from the pharmacological characteristics of prescription hypnotics. Rather, it appears that reported self-medication to promote sleep, using a variety of non-sedative products, provides an epidemiological \"marker\" for a group within which levels of morbidity and mortality are particularly high. Excess mortality associated with very short or long sleep duration was not replicated in this study. Overall, these findings provide little epidemiological support for a wide-spread interaction between benzodiazepine hypnotic use and sleep disordered breathing in old age.", 
    "21": "The effects of muscarinic agonists and depolarizing agents on inositol phospholipid hydrolysis in the rabbit vagus nerve were assessed by the measurement of [3H]inositol monophosphate production in nerves that had been preincubated with [3H]inositol. After 1 h of drug action, carbachol, oxotremorine, and arecoline increased the inositol monophosphate accumulation, though the maximal increase induced by these agonists differed. Addition of the muscarinic antagonists atropine or pirenzepine shifted the carbachol dose-response curves to the right, without decreasing the carbachol maximal stimulatory effects. The KB for pirenzepine was 35 nM, which is characteristic of muscarinic high-affinity binding sites coupled to phosphoinositide turnover and often associated with the M1 receptor subtype. On the other hand, agents known to depolarize or to increase the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, e.g., elevated extracellular K+, ouabain, Ca2+, and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, also increased inositol monophosphate accumulation. These effects were not mediated by the release of acetylcholine, as suggested by the fact that they could not be potentiated by the addition of physostigmine nor inhibited by the addition of atropine. The Ca(2+)-channel antagonist Cd2+, also known to inhibit the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, was able to block the effects of K+ and ouabain, but did not alter those of carbachol. These results suggest that depolarizing agents increase inositol monophosphate accumulation in part through elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and that muscarinic receptors coupled to phosphoinositide turnover are present along the trunk of the rabbit vagus nerve.", 
    "22": "Adinazolam is a triazolobenzodiazepine with anxiolytic and antidepressant activity. Adinazolam is metabolized extensively; the major metabolite, N-desmethyladinazolam (NDMAD), possesses significant pharmacologic activity. NDMAD is eliminated predominantly by renal excretion. Ranitidine, a histamine H2-receptor antagonist, is also excreted renally and may compete with NDMAD for renal secretion. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of ranitidine on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of adinazolam and NDMAD. In a randomized, cross-over study, 12 healthy male volunteers received 300 mg of ranitidine orally followed by 30 mg of adinazolam 1 hour later (treatment A), or adinazolam alone (treatment B). Pharmacodynamic alterations were assessed using card sorting, digit-symbol substitution, and short-term memory tests. Venous blood samples were obtained over 24 hours for analysis of adinazolam and NDMAD by high-performance liquid chromatography. Urine samples also were collected and analyzed for NDMAD. No significant difference in adinazolam oral clearance (1,149 vs. 1,135 ml/hr/kg) was noted between treatments (A vs. B, respectively). Furthermore, the renal clearance of NDMAD (196 vs. 198 ml/min) and the cumulative urinary excretion of NDMAD (% dose; 61.2 vs. 62.3) were not significantly different. Repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated no significant differences in psychomotor performance or short-term memory between treatments. Results suggest that ranitidine has no effect on adinazolam disposition, NDMAD renal clearance, or the central nervous system effects mediated by the drug.", 
    "23": "A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was undertaken to compare the effects of imipramine and clomipramine in the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. The number of dropouts in the placebo-treated group was 7; in the imipramine-treated group, 4; and in the clomipramine treated group, 0. Ten subjects fulfilled the 12 weeks of treatment in the placebo group, 25 in the imipramine group, and 22 in the clomipramine group. To minimize dropouts because of side effects, a flexible dose regimen with a careful escalation of doses was applied. The maximal dose allowed was 250 mg/day. The mean (+/- SEM) daily doses reached were 124 +/- 9 mg (range, 50-250 mg) of imipramine and 109 +/- 8 mg (range, 25-200 mg) of clomipramine. At the end of the trial, the number of panic attacks as well as the anxiety between attacks (measured using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety) were markedly reduced in patients treated with either of the two antidepressant drugs, but only slightly decreased in patients on placebo. With respect to all major outcome parameters, i.e., full panic attacks, total number of anxiety attacks (full plus mild), and anxiety between attacks, the effect of clomipramine was clearly and significantly superior to that of imipramine (p less than 0.001, p less than 0.002, and p less than 0.002, respectively). Moderate intake of diazepam was allowed; in the clomipramine group (p less than 0.006), but neither in the imipramine group nor in the placebo group, a significant decrement in diazepam intake was observed during the course of the trial. The finding that clomipramine may have a higher potency and/or efficacy than imipramine in the treatment of panic disorder supports the concept that the antipanic effect of antidepressant drugs is due to the influence of these compounds on serotonergic rather than noradrenergic neurotransmission.",

Both groups were examined before treatment and then after 10 and 20 days of therapy by a series of psychological tests. It was revealed that the combination of anxiolytics and Mg-lactate leads to a more rapid reduction of psychopathological symptoms, in particular anxiety. In MAS and MHG tests the decline of anxiety was statistically significant at the level of p less than 0.05.",

While CCKB receptor antagonist L-365,260 abolished the elevation of [Ca2+]i, CCKA receptor antagonist L-364,718 was without effect. Moreover, the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker nitrendipine was shown to block the observed calcium response. Results suggest that the calcium effect is caused by an interaction of CCK-8 with CCKB binding sites and an influx of external Ca2+ via dihydropyridine sensitive calcium channels might serve as a source for the increased [Ca2+]i. Because CCK-8 induced no PKC activation CCKB receptor mediated rise of intracellular calcium seems not to include activation of phospholipase C.", 
    "26": "The use of the laryngeal mask was compared with tracheal intubation in 30 patients who underwent intra-ocular ophthalmic surgery and who received intravenous anaesthesia with propofol. Changes in intra-ocular pressure, heart rate and mean arterial pressure after the insertion of the laryngeal mask airway or the tracheal tube were not significantly different. However, at the end of the procedure, a significantly higher percentage of patients with a tracheal tube coughed, reacted to head movement and suffered breath-holding. In addition, significantly more patients in this group complained of a sore throat (p less than 0.05). During intravenous propofol anaesthesia, the laryngeal mask airway does not offer any advantage over tracheal intubation in the control of intra-ocular pressure for intra-ocular ophthalmic surgery. However, there were fewer complications immediately following surgery in the laryngeal mask group.", 
    "27": "Mefenamic acid (MA) is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory analgesic agent widely used clinically. A simple and sensitive liquid-chromatographic assay has been developed for the quantitative determination of MA in human plasma. A reverse phase, 10-microns cyano column (25 x 0.4 cm), a mobile phase of water-acetonitrile-methanol-17 M acetic acid (69:15:15:1 by volume), and an ultraviolet detection (290 nm) are used for the separation of MA and internal standard (methyl-clonazepam). MA and internal standard are extracted from acidified plasma into diethyl ether and after evaporation of the organic phase, the residue is redissolved in methanol. Calibration curves are linear in the range 0.05-3.20 micrograms/ml, and at the plasma level corresponding to the quantification limit (0.05 microgram/ml) coefficients of variation are 7.5% and 10.2% for repeatability and reproducibility studies, respectively.

    "28": "We retrospectively collected plasma level assessments performed in 96 adult patients with epilepsy on stable monotherapy, including 9 patients on clobazam (CLB), 34 on carbamazepine (CBZ), 24 on phenobarbital (PB), 9 on phenytoin (PHT), and 20 on valproate (VPA); these results were compared to those obtained in 54 adult patients on stable bitherapy with the association of CLB with either CBZ (n = 17), PB (n = 17), PHT (n = 5), or VPA (n = 15). Our results show that CLB has no significant effect on the level to dose ratio (LDR) of CBZ, PB, PHT, or VPA. Conversely, CBZ, PB, and PHT significantly decrease the LDR of CLB. CBZ and PHT significantly increase the LDR of N-desmethylclobazam (NCLB), the major metabolite of CLB. A significant increase in the NCLB/CLB ratio was found in CBZ + CLB, PB + CLB, and PHT + CLB bitherapies. These findings are of clinical significance: clobazam is useful as adjunctive treatment in human epilepsy and is often chosen as the benzodiazepine adjunctive drug in chronic resistant epilepsy. Sedative side effects may occur, especially in patients treated by a CBZ + CLB or PHT + CLB bitherapy, and both CLB and NCLB plasma levels should be monitored in such patients.",

Neither NR nor subsequent SPV altered the migrating motor complex in the interdigestive state. In the digestive state, NR decreased the MI in the antrum, pylorus, and duodenum. The MI did not further change after SPV subsequent to NR. The cholecystokinin antagonist L364,718 decreased MI in the antrum, pylorus, and duodenum. After NR, L364,718 caused a further reduction in the MI during administration. Gastric emptying was accelerated after NR. SPV subsequent to NR increased gastric emptying further. L364,718, in the absence of NR, accelerated gastric emptying but only during the initial period of emptying. After NR, L364,718 also decreased the time required for emptying of 50 and 100% of the meal. After SPV subsequent to NR, no additional acceleration of emptying occurred.", 
    "30": "The effect of flumazenil reversal of midazolam-induced anesthesia on whole body oxygen uptake (VO2) was investigated in a double-blind trial in 48 patients (ASA, 1 or 2) undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia. VO2 was measured in spontaneously breathing patients during recovery from anaesthesia induced with midazolam 0.25 mg.kg-1 and maintained with nitrous oxide 60% in oxygen and halothane. The level of sedation was evaluated by a subjective score. To reverse midazolam-induced anesthesia, patients were randomly allocated to receive placebo or flumazenil (6 micrograms.kg-1). No significant changes in VO2 (160 +/- 53 vs 150 +/- 39 ml.min-1.m-2 or sedation score (2.5 +/- 1.0 vs 2.1 +/- 0.9) were observed in the placebo group. After flumazenil administration, the sedation score significantly (P less than 0.05) improved (2.9 +/- 1.0 vs 1.3 +/- 0.8) whereas no significant change in VO2 was observed (158 +/- 67 vs 157 +/- 61 ml O2.min-1.m-2). These data show that reversal of benzodiazepine effects with flumazenil resulted in no significant change in oxygen uptake.", 
    "31": "The effects of i.m. alfentanil and midazolam on anxiety, sedation, hemodynamics, oxygen saturation and intraocular pressure were studied in 90 patients scheduled for outpatient cataract surgery with regional anesthesia. The study was randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and performed on outpatients with ASA physical status I-III and mean age 67.7 +/- 11.7 years. Alfentanil (12.5 micrograms/kg) administered into the deltoid muscle had a marked anxiolytic and short sedative effect, and was associated with stable hemodynamics. Midazolam (20 micrograms/kg) administered similarly had a more prolonged anxiolytic and sedative effect, which impaired co-operation in some patients during surgery. The regional blockade was associated with a significant reduction of oxygen saturation (SpO2), regardless of the premedication used (P less than 0.05). A slight reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) was found after premedication, but the change was not statistically significant. We conclude that i.m. alfentanil is well tolerated, and its anxiolytic and short sedative effects make it especially suitable as premedication for day-case cataract surgery.", 
    "32": "The purpose of this study was to compare the sensitivity to the effects of lorazepam (2.5 mg) of a design using independent groups (random allocation of subjects to either a placebo or a lorazepam treatment) with a repeated-measures design (subjects tested both before and after lorazepam treatment). With both designs, it was possible to demonstrate significant and equal effects of lorazepam in tests based upon speed of responding: Lorazepam significantly increased simple reaction time and significantly decreased performance in number cancellation and symbol copying tasks. The independent-groups design was more sensitive (i.e., showed effects at a higher level of significance) to the lorazepam-induced impairment in episodic memory, as assessed in a picture recognition task, and to the lorazepam-induced impairment in a word completion task. Comparisons between the two control condition scores indicated that there were unlikely to be significant group differences with random allocation of a relative homogeneous group of volunteers, such as medical students. While either design would be appropriate for homogeneous populations, for a heterogeneous clinical population where groups cannot be matched the repeated-measures design would be preferable.", 
    "33": "The beta-carbolines and the convulsant agent pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) have been reported as \"anxiogenic\" in several animal models for anxiety. The present study examined the effects of the beta-carboline noreleagnine (NOR) and PTZ, administered alone and in combination with the benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788, on behavior in the conditioned suppression of drinking (CSD) conflict procedure. In daily 10-min sessions, water-deprived female SD rats were trained to drink from a tube that was electrified (0.25 mA). Electrification was signaled by a tone. Acute (20-min) treatment with NOR or PTZ resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in both punished responding (shocks received) and unpunished responding (water intake). Both NOR and PTZ decreased punished responding only at doses that also depressed unpunished responding. Coadministration of Ro 15-1788 (2 mg/kg) reduced the effects of NOR on punished, but not unpunished, responding; this Ro 15-1788 cotreatment reduced the effects of PTZ on both punished and unpunished responding. These data suggest that both PTZ and NOR produce benzodiazepine receptor-mediated anxiogenic-like effects on conflict behavior.", 
    "34": "It is known that rats poisoned with near-lethal doses of pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate (soman) develop brain lesions, particularly when convulsions are induced. When rats were intoxicated with a LD50 of soman and treated immediately thereafter with a combination of low doses of atropine and diazepam (LOW AS/DZ treatment), large decrements in performance of an earlier acquired shuttle-box task were found 6 days after intoxication. In contrast, no such decrements were found in soman-intoxicated animals treated similarly with a combination of high doses of these drugs (HIGH AS/DZ treatment). Surprisingly, surviving LOW AS/DZ animals acquired the same task again at a speed that was almost as fast as before intoxication. Similarly treated animals were examined light-microscopically 24 h after intoxication; in LOW-AS/DZ-treated animals, neuropathology was only observed in animals that had exhibited convulsions, whereas in HIGH AS/DZ animals neither convulsions nor brain damage were observed. Power spectra, obtained from electroencephalograms (EEGs) 6 days after intoxication, revealed significant differences between both treatment groups, particularly in the delta-, theta-, and beta-frequencies. After the HIGH AS/DZ treatment, a significant increase in delta activity was found compared to control values, suggestive of neuropathology. It is concluded that, in contrast with the LOW AS/DZ combination, HIGH AS/DZ prevents active avoidance deficits, convulsions, and light-microscopically detectable neuropathology after soman intoxication. However, the results of EEG measurements suggest that some aberrations may still remain even after the HIGH AS/DZ treatment.", 
    "35": "Twenty-four hours after mice were forced to swim for up to 10 min in cold (6 degrees C) water, the ability of flurazepam to antagonize the electrical precipitation of seizures was reduced. This stress-induced reduction in flurazepam's antiseizure efficacy persisted for at least 72 h; but was absent 1 week after the single session of swim stress. The data may be relevant to stress-related psychiatric disorders and suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of benzodiazepines may be altered after a severe stress.", 
    "36": "3-alpha-Hydroxy-5-beta-pregnan-20-one [pregnanolone (PA)] and 3-beta-hydroxy-5-pregnen-20-one 3-sulfate [pregnenolone sulfate (PS)] are steroids that have been shown in biochemical studies to be active at the GABA-benzodiazepine-chloride receptor complex, Pa as a \"barbiturate-like\" agonist and PS as a \"picrotoxin-like\" antagonist. Since other compounds that are active at this site interact with the effects of pentobarbital and ethanol, the behavioral effects of these steroids alone and in combination with pentobarbital and ethanol were tested. Pa blocks the convulsions caused by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and increases motor activity when given alone in low doses. In combination with either pentobarbital or ethanol, it enhances the depression in motor activity, hypothermia, and hypnosis. In contrast, PS has no effect on PTZ convulsions and depresses motor activity by itself. With pentobarbital, PS enhances the depression in motor activity but has no effect on hypothermia or hypnosis. With ethanol, PS enhances the hypothermia but does not affect motor activity or hypnosis. Therefore, Pa and PS show different but not opposite effects in interacting with compounds active at the GABA-benzodiazepine-chloride receptor complex.",

Anaesthesia for this type of surgery is demanding given the long duration of the operation and the severe haemodynamic and physiological alterations that can occur. A rapid sequence induction is usually performed and anaesthesia maintained with fentanyl and isoflurane. Dopamine and mannitol are used for renal protection. Extensive monitoring of haemodynamics, biochemistry, coagulation and temperature is essential. A rapid infusion device is mandatory as massive blood loss may occur. All patients were electively ventilated in the surgical intensive care unit postoperatively. One patient died 11 days postoperatively. The remainder are well at the time of writing.", 
    "39": "We studied the genetically determined hydroxylation polymorphism of S-mephenytoin in a Korean population (N = 206) and the pharmacokinetics of diazepam and demethyldiazepam after an oral 8 mg dose of diazepam administered to the nine extensive metabolizers and eight poor metabolizers recruited from the population. The log10 percentage of 4-hydroxymephenytoin excreted in the urine 8 hours after administration showed a bimodal distribution with an antimode of 0.3. The frequency of occurrence of the poor metabolizers was 12.6% in the population. In the panel study of diazepam in relation to the mephenytoin phenotype, there was a significant correlation between the oral clearance of diazepam and log10 urinary excretion of 4-hydroxymephenytoin (rs = 0.777, p less than 0.01). The plasma half-life of diazepam in the poor metabolizers was longer than that in the extensive metabolizers (mean +/- SEM, 91.0 +/- 5.6 and 59.7 +/- 5.4 hours, p less than 0.005), and the poor metabolizers had the lower clearance of diazepam than the extensive metabolizers (9.4 +/- 0.5 and 17.0 +/- 1.4 ml/min, p less than 0.001). In addition, the plasma half-life of demethyldiazepam showed a statistically significant (p less than 0.001) difference between the extensive metabolizers (95.9 +/- 11.3 hours) and poor metabolizers (213.1 +/- 10.7 hours), and correlated with the log10 urinary excretion of 4-hydroxymephenytoin (rs = -0.615, p less than 0.01). The findings indicate that the Korean subjects have a greater incidence of poor metabolizer phenotype of mephenytoin hydroxylation compared with that reported from white subjects and that the metabolism of diazepam and demethyldiazepam is related to the genetically determined mephenytoin hydroxylation polymorphism in Korean subjects.", 
    "40": "Eleven healthy subjects received single oral doses of placebo, 2 mg diazepam, 5 mg diazepam, and 10 mg diazepam in a randomized four-way crossover study. Plasma diazepam levels, the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and fraction of total electroencephalographic (EEG) amplitude falling in the sigma plus beta (13 to 31 Hz) frequency range were determined during the 12 hours after drug administration. Peak plasma diazepam concentration and area under the 12-hour curve were proportional to dose; time of peak was independent of dose. Baseline percentage of EEG amplitude falling in the 13 to 31 Hz range averaged 15.7% and did not differ among the four trials. The percentage of EEG amplitude falling in the 13 to 31 Hz range did not change over baseline with placebo or 2 mg diazepam but was increased 1/4 to 2 1/2 hours after 5 mg diazepam, (maximum, +7.3%) and 3/4 to 12 hours after 10 mg diazepam (maximum, +15.2%). The increase in the percentage of EEG amplitude falling in the 13 to 31 Hz range was highly correlated with plasma diazepam concentration. DSST scores for placebo and 2 mg diazepam were nearly identical. DSST decrements with 5 and 10 mg diazepam paralleled and were correlated with the changes in the percentage of EEG amplitude falling in the 13 to 31 Hz range and with plasma diazepam levels. Thus the EEG analysis provides objective quantitation of benzodiazepine central nervous system effects, in turn reflecting plasma levels and other clinical measures.", 
    "41": "Phenobarbital is a long-acting barbiturate often prescribed for seizure disorders. It has a high abuse potential and was commonly used in suicide attempts in the past. Although benzodiazepines are now more frequently used in suicide attempts, barbiturate intoxications are still occasionally seen and constitute a medical emergency. The management of phenobarbital overdose includes cardiac and respiratory support, cathartics, activated charcoal, and alkaline diuresis. In severely compromised patients, hemodialysis and hemoperfusion can be used to enhance drug clearance.", 
    "42": "Rats were trained to discriminate pentylenetetrazole (PTZ; 20 mg/kg) from midazolam (MDZ; 1 mg/kg) and from saline using a three-lever food-reinforced choice task. Using a cumulative dosing procedure, PTZ substituted for PTZ, and MDZ, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam (DZP) substituted for MDZ, in a dose-dependent manner. The animals were then treated with chronic DZP (20 mg/kg/8 hr for 7 days); 24 hr after the last dose of this regimen, the dose-effect curve of DZP was redetermined. The ED50 for the discrimination of DZP increased 4.8-fold after chronic DZP. In a second group of subjects trained on this discrimination and treated with DZP (20 mg/kg/8 hr for 7 days), the ED50 for the discrimination of MDZ was increased 2.2-fold. After 14 days of recovery, the MDZ dose-effect curve shifted back to the left and was not significantly different from the ED50 value obtained before chronic DZP treatment. When the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil was tested in a cumulative manner (1.0-32.0 mg/kg), the animals selected the saline lever. Analogous to the previous chronic dosing regimen, DZP (20 mg/kg/8 hr/7 days) was then administered, and a combination of three tests were then given at 1, 2, 4, 7, 10 and 14 days after the last DZP treatment. On each of these days, a saline test was given first; it was followed by a DZP (2.5 mg/kg) test; which was then followed by a flumazenil (32.0 mg/kg) test. On the 1st day of testing, tolerance was seen to DZP and precipitated withdrawal (PTZ lever selection) was seen with flumazenil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "43": "The effects of orally administered placebo, diphenhydramine, lorazepam, methocarbamol and placebo were studied in volunteers with histories of recreational substance abuse including sedative/hypnotics. Placebo, diphenhydramine (100, 200 and 400 mg), lorazepam (1 and 4 mg) and methocarbamol (2.25 and 9 g) were tested in a randomized, double-blind crossover study using 14 subjects. Psychomotor and cognitive performance and subject- and observer-rated responses were measured daily before and for 5.5 hr after drug administration. The results showed that each of the drugs exhibited a different profile of effects on the test battery. Lorazepam produced significant increases in subjects' ratings of drug effect and liking, increases in measures of sedation and impairment of psychomotor performance. Methocarbamol also produced significant increases in subjects' ratings of drug effect and liking and measures of sedation, but it produced only minor impairment of psychomotor and cognitive performance. Diphenhydramine increased subjects' and observers' ratings of drug effect and measures of sedation, but it produced less psychomotor performance impairment and liking than lorazepam. Diphenhydramine produced the most side effects. The present study clearly differentiated the behavioral and subjective profiles of diphenhydramine, lorazepam and methocarbamol. Consistent with its recognized low abuse liability, diphenhydramine produced fewer increases in measures of positive mood and more adverse effects. The considerable overlap in subjective effect measures of positive mood make further differentiation with respect to abuse liability difficult.", 
    "44": "The effects of induction of anesthesia with fentanyl, 62.1 +/- 7.9 micrograms/kg, diazepam, 0.21 +/- 0.08 mg/kg, and pancuronium on beat-to-beat heart rate variations were studied in seven patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Spectral analysis was used to determine the intensity of the variations in each of the two main frequency bands in which variations are known to occur: (1) high-frequency band, mediated by the parasympathetic nervous system, at the frequency band of respiration, and (2) the low-frequency band, mediated by both sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, at 0.04-0.12 Hz. Both the mean low- and high-frequency band areas were significantly decreased after induction of anesthesia. The ratio of high-to-low frequency band areas increased significantly after induction of anesthesia, from 45% to 62% (P less than 0.05). These results suggest that fentanyl-diazepam-pancuronium anesthesia decreases total autonomic nervous system activity and alters the balance between parasympathetic and sympathetic activities. Thus, spectral analysis of heart rate variations during anesthesia may provide a quantitative measure of assessing the activity of the autonomic nervous system.", 
    "45": "Because the choice of anesthetic technique does not influence the incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia, reduction of ischemic risk may require specific antianginal therapy. Calcium entry blockers are effective drugs in antianginal therapy. Diltiazem reduces myocardial oxygen demand through decreases in heart rate, inotropy, and systolic function, while increasing myocardial oxygen delivery through coronary vasodilation. These potentially beneficial effects of diltiazem were evaluated in 15 of 29 patients (diltiazem v placebo, double-blind study) scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Continuous infusion of diltiazem (0.15 mg/kg bolus followed by 2 micrograms/kg/min), during anesthesia and surgery before cardiopulmonary bypass, significantly reduced the major MVO2 determinants during anesthesia with moderate doses of fentanyl and a benzodiazepine (midazolam in 8 of 14 control patients and 9 of 15 treated patients, or flunitrazepam in the others). Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and inotropy were decreased during the most stressful events of surgery when plasma diltiazem concentrations were in the therapeutic range (greater than 96 ng/mL). The number of patients with perioperative ischemia was 2 of 15 in the treated group and 4 of 14 in the control group. Provided that diltiazem plasma concentrations are sufficient, it can contribute to lowering the ischemic burden during anesthesia for coronary artery surgery.", 
    "46": "Although most adults in the United States experience insomnia from time to time, many minimize the problem and fail to seek treatment. This occurs despite accumulating evidence that lack of sleep can seriously impair work performance, reflex response, cognitive abilities, and sense of well-being. Physicians should routinely inquire into a patient's sleep habits and be attuned to complaints of insomnia. A good working partnership between physician and patient may prevent complications of insomnia (eg, overconcern with the condition, demoralization, misuse of drugs and alcohol, disturbances of the circadian sleep-wake cycle), which might otherwise perpetuate and exacerbate the problem. Patients with situational insomnia can usually be treated by their primary care physician, who can offer thoughtful approaches to nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment. In cases of chronic insomnia, referral to a sleep specialist or other authority may be advisable.", 
    "47": "Benzodiazepines have receptors in the nervous system as well as in the kidney, liver, skeletal and ileal muscle, lungs and the heart. Flunitrazepam is a benzodiazepine with pronounced hypnotic effects in the usual dosage. High dose flunitrazepam anesthesia is suggested for prolonged surgical procedures as an alternative to the well known high-dose opiate anesthesia. Its reversal using flumazenil can shorten the post-operative anesthetic effect.", 
    "48": "One hundred and twenty children with persistent convulsions (lasting > or = 10 min) were treated with per rectal diazepam (dosage: 0.2 to 0.7 mg/kg/dose). Another group of 100 age matched children with convulsions, along with those who did not respond to rectal therapy were given intravenous diazepam in a dosage of 0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg/dose. Rectal treatment was effective in 80.83% cases while intravenous diazepam was effective in 90% cases which is statistically just significant (p < 0.05). No significant difference was observed in the efficacy of two routes of administration in controlling convulsions of different clinical types and various etiological groups (p < 0.05), except for primary generalized type where intravenous route was more effective than the rectal one (p < 0.05). No significant side-effect was observed with rectal therapy. Among the 23 (19.17%) children in whom rectal therapy failed, 12 (10%) responded to intravenous diazepam while the remaining 11 (9.17%) cases were resistant to both routes of administration.",

The pA2 values of the four antagonists against pilocarpine were not different from their values against carbachol after the treatment with PrBCM and was identified with the values for the m3 subtype. These results suggest that the subtype of PrBCM-sensitive and -resistant muscarinic cholinoceptors in guinea pig ileal muscle is the m3 subtype only and not other subtypes.", 
    "51": "Twenty healthy volunteers entered a study to assess cardiopulmonary responses, as measured by pulse oximetry, following changes in posture in the dental chair and the administration of Diazemuls (diazepam) in doses sufficient to instill sedation (up to a maximum dose of 20 mg) in the volunteers to a degree such that ptosis was seen. The results indicate that SaO2 values remained above 95 per cent throughout the study. It is concluded that although changes in SaO2 and pulse rate do occur, these differences are not important in healthy individuals, although they may be more serious in patients with pre-existing cardiopulmonary disease.", 
    "52": "The compatibilities of dipotassium clorazepate and midazolam hydrochloride with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags have been studied and compared with those observed with glass flasks. At room temperature, dipotassium clorazepate showed chemical instability which was independent of the container. At 4 degrees C, dipotassium clorazepate showed no decrease in concentration over 12 h, both in 5% dextrose solution and 0.9% sodium chloride solutions. When stored for longer periods of up to 72 h, a slight decrease not exceeding 5% was observed. The compatibility of midazolam with the PVC bags was found to be good at room temperature. It was slightly better in 5% dextrose solution than in 0.9% sodium chloride solution. High sorption of the drug was observed at pH 7.0 when the primary ring structure is maintained. The results make it possible for the hospital pharmacist to prepare dipotassium chlorazepate salt and midazolam admixtures up to 3 days before administration, provided the former are stocked in a refrigerator and the latter are prepared in dextrose isotonic solutions.", 
    "53": "The technical term 'drug dependence' was officially adopted by WHO's Expert Committee on Addiction in 1964. Until this, to describe a state of dependence, terms such as 'poisoning', 'habit', 'ism', and 'addiction' had been used from time to time. Until the 1950's, investigators were mainly focussed on the phenomena of physical dependence. However, once the concept of psychic dependence had been introduced, behavioral and neuropharmacological studies on the modes of drug action that produce psychic dependence were activated and have progressed in the last two decades, and among the points clarified by these studies are the following: 1. The critical drug properties that produce psychic dependence are those of rewarding subjective and reinforcing effects of drugs but these effects are not the properties that produce physical dependence, although the development of physical dependence on particular drugs such as opiates may substantially enhance craving for the drugs. 2. The mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine systems in the brain and also the N. Accumbens play a primary or at least a partial role in producing the subjective and reinforcing effects of major dependence-producing drugs such as cocaine, opiates, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and ethanol. 3. Many drugs such as naltrexone, methadone, and some dopamine antagonists and serotonin reuptake inhibitors or antagonists were found to be effective in the pharmacotherapy of the dependence on opiates, cocaine, or ethanol.", 
    "54": "One-year maintenance therapy with pirenzepine (Gastrozepin, CAS 28797-61-7) (75 mg/d) or placebo was performed in a double-blind fashion in 251 patients to investigate the relapse by means of endoscopic examinations repeated every 3 months. Enrolled were the patients who had been cured within 3 months by acute therapy with either pirenzepine or cimetidine randomly given by the envelope method. When the results were analyzed by Cutler-Ederer's life table method to monitor manifestation of relapse, the maintenance therapy with pirenzepine did not show any significant difference from placebo in all the patients enrolled. However, stratified analysis according to various combinations of background factors revealed that there was significant difference in 1-year cumulative non-relapse rates between the pirenzepine maintenance therapy group and the placebo group, suggesting prophylactic effect of the maintenance therapy with pirenzepine on relapse. An increase of daily dose more than 75 mg in maintenance therapy may be expected to display the prophylactic effect of pirenzepine on ulcer relapse in a definite manner.", 
    "55": "The following study was conducted in order to investigate the effect of drug therapy on the relapse of peptic ulcers. Acute therapy with pirenzepine (Gastrozepin, CAS 28797-61-7) (100 mg/d) or cimetidine (CAS 51481-61-9) (800 mg/d) was given to 402 patients with peptic ulcers using the envelope method. Subsequently, 1-year maintenance therapy with pirenzepine (75 mg/d) or placebo was carried out in a double-blind study in 251 patients who had been cured within 3 months. During the study period, an endoscopic examination was repeated regularly to study the relapse of ulcers. When the results were stratified and analyzed by Cutler-Ederer's life table method to see changes in relapse over time, it was noted that the acute therapy for active ulcers did have an influence on the course of relapse after the ulcer lesions had been cured. Pirenzepine, a M1 antagonist, was superior to cimetidine, a H2 antagonist, in the prevention of relapse of ulcers after they had been cured. The results suggest that the prevention of relapse of peptic ulcers should be started at the stage of acute therapy for active ulcers and that care should be taken in selecting drugs. The results also suggest that the natural history of peptic ulcers with respect to their relapse can be modified to a certain extent by drug therapy although the period for such cannot be specified.", 
    "56": "Output of melatonin or its main metabolite, 6-sulphatoxy melatonin, provides an index of noradrenergic activity in the pineal gland, which is of interest in major depression and during its treatment with antidepressants. Fifteen female depressed outpatients did not differ in levels of 24-hour urinary 6-sulphatoxy melatonin compared with 13 female control subjects. However, a subgroup of the depressed patients (n = 9) who were treated with desipramine showed a significant elevation of 6-sulphatoxy melatonin levels after 1 week of treatment and a return to baseline levels after 6 weeks. There was also a significant negative correlation between 6-sulphatoxy melatonin levels and symptom severity as measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression after 3 weeks of treatment with desipramine. The other subgroup of depressed patients (n = 6) were treated with adinazolam, a benzodiazepine with antidepressant properties. Despite comparable antidepressant effects to those achieved with desipramine, adinazolam was not associated with any apparent change in 6-sulphatoxy melatonin output during 6 weeks of treatment. There was also no correlation between 6-sulphatoxy melatonin levels and symptom severity.", 
    "57": "Cold restraint stress produces acute gastric mucosal injury in association with altered gastric motility. Enteral nutrients prevent this injury in conjunction with inhibition of gastric emptying. Because cholecystokinin (CCK) is released by nutrients known to be cytoprotective and is thought to inhibit gastric emptying, we performed three experiments to see if CCK contributes to the gastric mucosal protection afforded by enteral nutrients. Our data show that enteral glucose protects the gastric mucosa and increases gastric volume, gastric luminal pH, and gastric mucin. Neither physiologic nor pharmacologic doses of CCK protected the mucosa. None of the other significant effects of glucose on gastric function during cold restraint were affected by exogenous CCK. Furthermore, antagonism of CCK receptors with L-364,718 did not have any independent effects, nor did it diminish the protection associated with enteral glucose. We conclude that enteral glucose protects the gastric mucosa from cold restraint injury in association with a number of potentially beneficial effects on gastric physiology, but none of the effects of glucose in this model appear to be mediated by CCK.", 
    "58": "A 25-year-old male anesthesiologist was found dead in his room with an intravenous drip line connected with his leg. There were several empty ampules of pancuronium, midazolam and buprenorphine around him. Pancuronium and midazolam in the blood and urine samples collected at postmortem examination were detected by spectrofluorometry and ECD-gas chromatography, respectively. The concentrations of pancuronium and midazolam were 0.3 micrograms/g and 0.12 micrograms/g in the blood, respectively; 0.9 micrograms/g and 0.05 micrograms/g in the urine, respectively. The cause of death was determined to be asphyxia due to respiratory muscle paralysis caused by pancuronium.", 
    "59": "Using 14C-labeled alprazolam (1-[14C]APZ) as a model for 1-[11C]APZ, we evaluated the tissue distribution of total radioactivity and assessed the contribution of the polar metabolites of APZ (alpha-hydroxymethyl- and 4-hydroxy-APZ) to radioactivity levels in the plasma and brains of rats over the course of 1 h. The biodistribution data showed that the uptake of radioactivity by rat brain was 0.31% of the injected dose per gram of tissue weight at 10 min postinjection. Pretreating rats reduced the levels in brain to 0.21% of the injected dose at 10 min but had little effect on the distribution of radioactivity in plasma and other tissues studied. Analysis of the metabolites in plasma and brain homogenates by an extraction-thin-layer chromatography-liquid scintillation method revealed that greater than 94% of the radioactivity in the rat brain was due to 1-[14C]APZ over the course of 1 h. APZ, therefore, is stable to metabolic transformations in the rat brain, and the polar metabolites are readily conjugated and excreted so that their cerebral uptake is minimal.", 
    "60": "The pharmacokinetics of diazepam in normal rats and in rats pretreated with carbon tetrachloride to induce hepatic cirrhosis (cirrhotic rats) was studied after intravenous and oral administration of the drug (4 mg/kg). Animals pretreated with this hepatotoxic agent showed a significant prolongation in the half-life of diazepam in plasma that is due more to an increase in volume of distribution rather than to a decrease in clearance. This study confirmed that diazepam was highly extracted by the rat liver and was not affected by the hepatotoxic agent, although there probably was a saturation of the activity of the cytochrome P450 enzyme when the drug was administered orally. Diazepam binds to plasma proteins to a high degree in both normal and cirrhotic rats; however, in the latter, a significant increase in the fraction of unbound drug in plasma was observed. Pretreatment of rats with carbon tetrachloride did not produce any change either in the distribution of diazepam into erythrocytes or in the disposition of the metabolite desmethyldiazepam.", 
    "61": "A patient with myoclonus epilepsy had 2 types of negative myoclonus as well as positive myoclonus at rest. One type followed a large EMG discharge at the end of continuous contraction and the other did not. Both types of negative myoclonus and positive myoclonus were preceded by EEG activity, predominantly distributed in the contralateral central region. It is suggested that an abnormal activity around the motor cortex suppresses a voluntary contraction as well as induces myoclonus. Clonazepam was markedly effective on both positive and negative myoclonus.", 
    "62": "The binding of some cephalosporins to human serum albumin (HSA) was studied by an ultrafiltration technique. Changes in C-3 side chain resulted in marked changes in the binding to HSA, but changes in C-7 side chain did not. Cephalosporins were classified into three groups by C-3 side chain: (i) Cationic side chain with low affinity for HSA; (ii) anionic side chain with high affinity for HSA; (iii) non ionized side chain, in which binding to HSA was dependent on lipophilicity. These findings suggest that electrostatic and hydrophobic forces play a role in the binding affinity of cephalosporins for HSA. The binding of cephalosporins with high HSA affinity was displaced significantly by warfarin but not by phenylbutazone, L-tryptophan, or diazepam. The interaction of the cephalosporins with high affinity for HSA with chemically modified HSA was investigated to clarify the amino acid residues of HSA involved in the cephalosporin binding sites. The binding of the cephalosporins decreased remarkably with the modification of the tyrosine residues. These results suggest that the binding site of cephalosporins is located in the vicinity of warfarin binding site rather than benzodiazepine binding site and that tyrosine residues are involved in the cephalosporin binding site.", 
    "63": "In drug metabolism studies, isolated and cultured human hepatocytes provide a useful model for overcoming the difficulty of extrapolating from animal data. In vitro studies with human hepatocytes are scarce because of the lack of livers and suitable methods of storage. After developing a new method for cryopreservation of human hepatocytes, we evaluated the effects of deep freezing storage on their viability, morphology, and functional and toxicological capabilities in classical culture conditions. Freshly isolated human hepatocytes were cryopreserved in medium containing 10% Me2SO and 20% fetal calf serum, using a Nicool ST20 programmable freezer (-1.9 degrees C/min for 18 min and -30 degrees C/min for 4 min). Cells were stored in liquid nitrogen. Viability of thawed human hepatocytes was 50-65% as assessed by erythrosin exclusion test prior to purification on a Percoll density gradient. Morphological criteria showed that thawed human hepatocytes require an adaptation period to the medium after seeding. Functional assessments showed that human hepatocytes which survive freezing and thawing preserve their protein synthesis capabilities and are able to secrete a specific protein, anionic peptidic fraction, which is involved in the hepatic uptake of bile-destined cholesterol. We then studied Midazolam biotransformation to test metabolic functions, and erythromycin toxicity by Neutral Red test (cell viability) and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide test (cell metabolism). All of these experiments indicated that thawed human hepatocytes should be used 38 h after seeding for optimum recovery of their functions: membrane integrity, protein synthesis, and stabilization of drug metabolism enzymes.", 
    "64": "Octylonium bromide (OB) is a drug with spasmolytic properties acting selectively on the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract by interfering with calcium mobilization from extra- and intra-cellular deposits. The etiopathogenetic implications of a psychosomatic nature of the irritable bowel syndrome amply justify the use of a spasmolytic (OB) with a benzodiazepine. In our study, we compared the combination OB + DZ (20 mg + 2 mg) T.I.D. versus OB alone (20 mg) in 30 patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome. The double-blind study lasting 3 weeks was aimed at evaluating gastrointestinal symptoms (bowel motions, aspect of faeces, abdominal pain, pre-evacuation pain, bloating) during the three days preceding the study and during the last five days of treatment, as well as the anxiogenic situation as assessed by the STAI scale (State Tract Anxiety Inventory) before and at the end of the treatment period. The results obtained showed that both treatments considerably reduced gastrointestinal symptoms even though OB alone did not appear to be equally effective and the anxiety component was significantly reduced only by treatment with the combination. The absence of side effects and the perfect tolerability of both treatments showed the OB + D combination T.I.D. to be the treatment of choice for patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome.", 
    "65": "The irritable bowel syndrome is classified ad \"disturbance of intestinal motility without an identifiable anatomic substrate\". However, the clear etiopathogenetic implications of a psychosomatic nature complicate the search for an adequate therapeutic strategy. Based on this clinical experience, we set out to check the importance of a spasmolytic with a benzodiazepine and the tolerability of this type of combination. We therefore compared the results in 60 patients with irritable bowel syndrome of 8 weeks' treatment with tablets containing octylonium bromide (OB) 20 mg plus diazepam (DZ) 2 mg or OB 40 mg + 2 mg DZ. The doubling of the spasmolytic without increasing the daily dose of anxiolytic appeared to be useful for reducing the symptoms typical for the irritable bowel syndrome. In addition, the combination was found to be perfectly tolerated.",

Psychopharmacological approaches to controlling symptoms of anxiety are possible as part of a multi-model treatment approach. This paper provides an overview of some recent findings in child and adolescent anxiety disorders that may influence treatment decisions.

    "67": "The stiff-person syndrome is a disorder of persistent, painful muscle contractions predominately affecting the axial musculature. We describe a patient with this disorder and review its pathophysiology. Molecular biologic and immunologic techniques have recently added to the understanding of the mechanism of this disorder. Association with diseases such as diabetes, vitiligo and hypothyroidism have strengthened the auto-immune nature of this syndrome. Auto-antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), an intraneuronal enzyme, have been implicated in the etiology of this unique disease. Therapeutic intervention with agents such as benzodiazepines that modify central GABAergic activity have demonstrated significant benefit in patients with stiff-person syndrome.", 
    "68": "Were chosen for analysis 1443 acute poisonings, that were treated in the Emergency Services of the Miguel Servet Hospital and the University Hospital of Zaragoza between the years 1988 and 89. The great part of the patients didn't required hospitable ingress, it was observed a predominance of the voluntary poisonings with predominance in people under 40 years. Among the drug poisonings were the benzodiazepines the drug more used and among nonpharmacologic agent, alcohol and the narcotics. The treatment more used was the symptomatic (53%) and was contrast the decrease of gastric lavage (15%) and forced diuresis (10%).", 
    "69": "We have examined the anticonvulsant properties of propofol in high doses in two experimental models of status epilepticus: generalized pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures and partial, cortically applied penicillin G-induced seizures. Propofol was administered either as a single bolus injection or as a bolus injection followed by an infusion for 1 h. When administered as a single bolus injection, propofol 12 mg kg-1 suppressed electrical and clinical seizures in PTZ generalized epileptic status, and an infusion of 50 mg kg-1 h-1 prevented the reappearance of electrical and clinical signs. In focal epileptic status, the single dose stopped paroxysmal activity and the associated clonic jerks for a few seconds. When the bolus dose was followed by an infusion, the firing bursts were replaced by isolated spikes, and contralateral jerks became sporadic and feeble. The greater efficacy of propofol against PTZ convulsions may be a reflection of the opposite action of the two drugs on neural membrane conductance: PTZ induces paroxysmal neural discharge by enhancing membrane conductance while propofol appears to decrease membrane conductance, thus suppressing paroxysmal discharge. There was no close relationship between blood concentration of the anaesthetic and its clinical effects, at least after a short-term infusion, as used in the present experiments. We suggest that propofol may be a potentially useful drug in status epilepticus in patients in whom benzodiazepines, barbiturates and phenytoin have failed.", 
    "70": "We have examined interactions between midazolam, propofol and alfentanil using two end-points of light sedation (hypnosis) and anaesthesia. Quantal dose-response curves were determined in 400 female patients for the drugs individually and in combination. At the hypnotic end-point, interactions were analysed by fitting the data to a mathematical model where the response depended on the doses of the three drugs with additional terms included to describe non-additive interactions of the various combinations of the three drugs. There were significant interactions for hypnosis; the decrease in expected ED50 for the various combinations were: midazolam-propofol = 37%, midazolam-alfentanil = 46%, propofol-alfentanil = 20%, midazolam-propofol-alfentanil = 42%. Whilst all responses to the two-drug combinations were synergistic, the three-drug combination led to a response that was less than that expected from the effects of the individual agents and their two drug interactions. For anaesthesia, dose-related effects could not be demonstrated for midazolam or alfentanil when used alone. The decrease in ED50 of propofol in the presence of the other compounds was propofol-midazolam = 52%, propofol-alfentanil = 73%, propofol-midazolam-alfentanil = 82%. When comparing the different combinations, the responses varied markedly at each end-point assessed and could not be predicted from the responses of the individual agents.", 
    "71": "The postoperative period after major abdominal surgery is known to be a period of increased episodic oxygen desaturation. In order to assess the risk factors for episodic desaturation, we have studied 29 surgical patients using pulse oximetry during the preoperative night (Npre) when they received benzodiazepine premedication and breathed air, and also during the first three nights after operation when they received nasal oxygen supplementation. Modal oxygen saturation (SpO2) exceeded 95% during all nights studied. The time spent at less than 90% (t90) and 85% (t85) SpO2 and the average SpO2 nadir (SpO2, nadir) did not differ each night. Heart rate was greater (mean 90.1 (SD 16.6) vs 68.2 (12.0) beat min-1, P < 0.001) during the second night after operation (N2) than during Npre. Before operation, the number of desaturations, t90 and t85 correlated with pharyngeal hypertrophy (P = 0.003, P = 0.002, P = 0.001, respectively). At the same time, t90 and t85 correlated with body mass index (P = 0.02 and P = 0.05, respectively). During N2, t90 correlated with radiological lung consolidation (P = 0.05) and SpO2, nadir correlated with FEV1 (P = 0.03). We conclude that there are several mechanisms responsible for oxygen desaturation and that these mechanisms differ before and after surgery.", 
    "72": "The identification of several safe and effective agents for the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting has prompted an intensive effort to develop combination antiemetic regimens. The principal rationale for development of drug combinations is the potential for blocking different types of neurotransmittor receptors controlling the emetic process. Studies have shown that the combination of a neurotransmitter receptor blocker, a corticosteroid, and a benzodiazepine improves antiemetic efficacy, lessens side effects, and decreases the length of treatment and the number of drug administrations. Ondansetron appears to be an excellent antiemetic for use in combination programs because of its highly selective, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT3)-blocking properties and its proven single-agent effectiveness and safety. Preliminary data show that ondansetron can be combined with dexamethasone safely with enhanced antiemetic results. Ondansetron merits further study in combination antiemetic programs.", 
    "73": "Most patients who require emergency airway control receive drugs to induce rapidly sufficient anesthesia for direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation, but there are no protocols that outline the use of specific drugs in general use. Drugs should safely and rapidly produce (1) unconsciousness; (2) paralysis; and (3) blunt intracranial pressure (ICP) responses to airway procedures. Consequences to be considered include increased ICP, hemorrhagic shock, and a full stomach. To refine the use of drugs used for airway procedures in pediatric trauma patients, the authors reviewed all cases of emergency endotracheal intubation over a recent 12-month period (1) to see whether medications used met the goals of producing unconsciousness and paralysis and blunting ICP responses were met safely; and (2) to identify potential drug-related complications. From July 1, 1990, to June 30, 1991, 60 of 791 children (7.6%) required endotracheal intubation at the scene of injury, at the referring hospital, or in our emergency department (15; 25%). Ten patients died (16.7%). Three fourths were younger than 9 years of age. All except one suffered blunt injuries. Nearly all (95%) suffered head injuries, isolated in 39 of 57 (68.4%) and combined with injuries in other regions in 18 (31.6%). Fifteen patients were in apnea (25%); seven were both apneic and pulseless. Three fourths (45 of 60) had diminished levels of consciousness; one fourth (15 of 60) were awake. Immediate endotracheal intubation proceeded appropriately without drugs in all seven patients in cardiopulmonary arrest. Only eight of the remaining 53 patients (15.1%) received an optimal medication regimen. Many patients with head injury were inadequately protected against increases in ICP. Thiopental, an effective anesthetic agent that effectively lowers intracranial pressure, was not used in 25 of 35 stable patients with isolated head injury (71.4%). Intravenous lidocaine was not used in 38 of 50 head-injured patients in whom it would have been an appropriate adjunct to control increases in ICP (76%). Eight patients received paralyzing agents alone, without sedatives or narcotics. Medications were thought inadequate to relieve the pain and discomfort of laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in 32 of the 53 patients who should have received them (60.4%). No paralyzing agents were used in 36 of the 53 instances where it would have been appropriate (67.9%). In two of 11 instances (18.3%) where succinylcholine was administered, no prior nondepolarizing agent was used. Complications of a full stomach at the time of emergency endotracheal intubation became evident in 10 patients (16.7%) who vomited during procedures to control the airway. Two patients (3.3%) aspirated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "74": "The article makes a comparative estimation of the efficiency between the benzodiazepine pharmacological group (selenium, diazepam) and adaptogens of the plant origin (Extractum Leuzeae carthamoidis fluidum) for correction of sleeping disorders in seamen during cruise. The application of elenium and diazepam have caused the unpleasant subjective sensations, such as psychoemotional retardation, sluggishness, apathism and headaches. After application of Extractum Leuzeae there were no side effects like a drug hang-over; the health status, functional state and job performance of seamen were improved. Having taken Extractum Leuzeae the seamen had the normalization of sleeping in 5-7 days.", 
    "75": "The adenosine receptor has been implicated in the central mechanism of action of benzodiazepines. The specific binding of an A1-selective adenosine antagonist radioligand, [3H]8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine, was measured in-vivo in mice treated with alprazolam (2 mg kg-1, i.p.), lorazepam (2 mg kg-1, i.p.) and vehicle. Binding studies were performed in-vivo and ex-vivo in mice receiving continuous infusion of alprazolam (2 mg kg-1 day-1), lorazepam (2 mg kg-1 day-1) and vehicle by mini-osmotic pumps for 6 days. Continuous infusion of alprazolam and lorazepam significantly decreased specific binding by 34 and 53%, respectively, compared with vehicle treatment (P less than 0.01). Single doses of alprazolam and lorazepam induced a similar trend in specific binding in-vivo (P = 0.07). There were no alterations in A1-receptor density (Bmax) or affinity (Kd) in cortex, hippocampus or brainstem in ex-vivo studies. Benzodiazepine treatment may diminish A1- receptor binding in-vivo by inhibiting adenosine uptake or by direct occupancy of the A1 adenosine receptor recognition site.", 
    "76": "The psychotropic drug use in mothers to all 73 perinatally dead infants in the city of Gothenburg, Sweden, in 1985-86, was compared to a control group of mothers to 73 surviving infants. Information regarding medication in pregnancy and pre- and perinatal data was collected retrospectively. In addition, serum samples obtained in early pregnancy were screened for benzodiazepines. Eighteen case-mothers used psychotropic drugs during pregnancy compared with 7 control-mothers. The association between psychotropic drug use and perinatal death was significant (p = 0.01). Psychotropic drug use and maternal disorder were closely correlated, but within the case group there were no significant differences between mothers using or not using psychotropic drugs in terms of age, parity or smoking habits. Although the etiology of death could be discussed in the individual infant, we find it noteworthy that the use of psychotropic drugs was so frequent in the mothers of perinatally dead infants.", 
    "77": "Benzodiazepines (BZ) and steroid hormone derivatives can potentiate the inhibitory actions of GABA through interactions with the GABAA/BZ/chloride ionophore complex. The present study examines whether the in vivo hormone milieu of rats modulates GABA/BZ receptors and/or benzodiazepine responses. The influences of gender, estrous cycle, and the diminution of steroid levels on GABA/BZ receptors and BZ anticonvulsant responses were tested by comparing these parameters in groups of intact male, intact female, orchidectomized, and ovariectomized rats. The hormonal milieu appears to modulate the GABA recognition site and possibly GABA-related responses in rats. This is evidenced by the decrease in cortical GABAA receptor affinity seen in females compared with other hormone groups and the gender-related difference observed in susceptibility to seizures induced by the GABA antagonist bicuculline. In cycling females, high circulating levels of progesterone were correlated with heightened seizure thresholds, suggesting that progestins serve a protective role in the control of seizure activity. Although a gender-related difference in cortical BZ binding affinity was observed, BZ receptor parameters in several other brain areas and BZ anticonvulsant responses were unaffected by physiological fluctuations in gonadal hormones.", 
    "78": "In the present experiment, the hypothesis that rearing animals in conditions of sexual segregation in infancy (ISS) would affect their adult behavioral reactivity to drug or environmental challenges was tested. Outbred Swiss CD-1 mouse litters were reduced at birth to six pups according to three conditions: MM (all males), MF (sex-balanced composition), and FF (all females). At weaning (day 21), all mice were rehoused in unisexual groups. At adulthood (day 70), animals were challenged either with BDZ agonist chlordiazepoxide (CDP at 2.5- or 5.0-mg/kg dose) or BDZ receptor partial inverse agonist Ro 15-3505 (RO at 3-, 10-, or 30-mg/kg dose) and assessed in sequence for pain reactivity in a hot-plate apparatus (set at 55 +/- 1 degrees C), for locomotor activity in a Varimex apparatus, and finally for neophobia level by measuring the latency to first approach a novel object. As concerns the hot-plate test, lick latency was significantly shortened in MF females receiving CDP (5.0 mg/kg), while RO was either ineffective in MF females or induced a prominent dose-dependent analgesia in FF females. Activity was decreased by CDP (2.5 mg/kg) and enhanced by RO (3.0 mg/kg). For latency to approach a novel object, males as a whole exhibited shorter times than females. Mixed-sex animals of both sexes were less fearful, being also more explorative than their corresponding unisexually reared groups. In particular, MF males receiving either a 5.0-mg/kg CDP dose or a 3.0-mg/kg RO dose explored the object more often than MM males.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "79": "U-78875 [imidazo[1,5-a]quinoxalin-4(5H)-one, 3-(5-cyclopropyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-5-(1-methylethyl)] belongs to a series of imidazoquinoxaline derivatives, recently discovered ligands with high affinity for benzodiazepine receptors. In this study, we have examined the drug and its analogs for their modes of interaction with the receptors, with a particular emphasis on finding molecular determinants for their functional properties. Changes in the substituents on N5 and C6 of the heterocyclic ring produced no major effects on binding characteristics but yielded drugs of widely varying efficacy (antagonist to full agonist), measured as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated 36Cl- uptake and t-butylbicyclophosphoro[35S]thionate binding in rat cerebrocortical membranes. The relative binding affinity and efficacy of the analogs measured in brain membranes were similar to those in cloned GABAA receptors of the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 (type I) and alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 2 (type II) subtypes. The imidazoquinoxalines showed no marked subtype selectivity. Their Ki value against [3H]flunitrazepam binding for type I was only 2-3 times lower than that for type II, and their rank order for agonistic activity was the same in the two subtypes, measured as GABA-mediated Cl- currents in human kidney cells (A293) expressing the subtypes of GABAA receptors. According to computational modeling of the drugs using both molecular and quantum mechanics, the agonistic activity of the imidazoquinoxaline derivatives depends on the presence of a bulky alkyl substituent at N5 and the deformation of the substituted portion of the otherwise planar ring system induced by a bulky moiety at N5 or C6. With a fixed N5 substituent (isopropyl), the relative efficacy in the brain membranes, as well as in the cloned receptors, appeared to be dependent on the degree of the ring deformation. This out-of-plane portion of the imidazoquinoxalines can be assigned to the general region occupied by the 5-phenyl group of diazepam and other agonistic functional groups of several nonbenzodiazepine ligands. It seems that this region, apparently common to various agonistic ligands, interacts with an agonistic pocket in type I and type II subtypes of the benzodiazepine receptors in the brain. Our results also provide direct support for the view that the agonists and nonagonists share largely overlapping binding regions in the benzodiazepine receptor, which has been proposed earlier from in vivo efficacy measurements of other series of ligands.", 
    "80": "Antiemetic drugs are used to treat nausea and vomiting due to a variety of causes and have a wide range of pharmacological properties. The choice of drug will, therefore, depend in part on the condition being treated. The drugs can be classified as dopamine antagonists (including phenothiazines and nonphenothiazines), corticosteroids, cannabinoids, benzodiazepines, serotonin antagonists, antihistamines and anticholinergics. There is very little evidence of a relationship between plasma drug concentrations and either their efficacy or the incidence of adverse effects with most antiemetic drugs. With drugs for which concentration-effect studies have been performed, e.g. the benzodiazepines and antihistamines, the effects monitored have not been directly relevant to their use as antiemetics. Antiemetics are used widely, for example, in cancer chemotherapy. Nonetheless, apart from metoclopramide, little work has been done on the influence of indicators of systemic disease on the pharmacokinetics of antiemetic drugs.", 
    "81": "Olanzapine (LY170053, 2-methyl-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-10H-thieno[2,3-b][1,5] benzodiazepine) is a novel \"atypical\" antipsychotic agent with 5-hydroxytryptamine2.dopamine D1/D2 antagonist activity and anticholinergic properties. In behavioral studies, olanzapine (1.25-10 mg/kg, p.o.) antagonizes apomorphine-induced climbing behavior in mice, demonstrating that the compound possesses D1/D2 antagonist activity in vivo. Olanzapine (0.3-20 mg/kg, p.o.) antagonizes 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced head twitches in mice at doses much lower than those required to block the climbing response, confirming that in vivo, the compound is a more potent 5-hydroxytryptamine2 antagonist than dopamine antagonist. Olanzapine (2.5-10 mg/kg, p.o.) also antagonized oxotremorine-induced tremor in mice. In a conditioned avoidance paradigm in rats, olanzapine inhibits the avoidance response with an ED50 of 4.7 mg/kg p.o; however, unlike other antipsychotic agents, catalepsy is only observed at much higher doses (ED50 39.4 mg/kg, p.o.). These data would suggest that the compound will be less likely to produce undesirable extrapyramidal symptoms. Unlike \"typical\" antipsychotics, olanzapine (1.25-5 mg/kg p.o.) increases responding during the conflict component of a modified Geller Seifter test, demonstrating that the compound may also possess anxiolytic activity. In another series of experiments, olanzapine (1.25 mg/kg, i.p.) produced clozapine-appropriate responding in a drug discrimination model in which animals had been trained to discriminate clozapine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) from vehicle. On the basis of these results, it would therefore be predicted that olanzapine will have an atypical profile and will be less likely to induce undesirable extrapyramidal symptoms than currently available drugs.", 
    "82": "Previous work suggests that iomazenil (formerly known as Ro 16-0154) is a useful ligand for static imaging of the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The present study evaluated the feasibility of dynamic SPECT imaging of cerebral radioactivity following intravenous [123I]iomazenil injection in healthy human subjects, in preparation for future receptor quantitation studies. Maximal brain uptake was reached approximately 25-30 minutes after i.v. administration of the radioligand and represented approximately 12% of the injected dose. The regional distribution of radioactive densities was consistent with the known distribution of BZ receptors in human brain, with highest uptake localized over the occipital area. Washout of cortical radioactivity was regionally variable but relatively slow, with a half-life of approximately 4 hours after the time of peak radioactivity. In summary, [123I]iomazenil is a promising SPECT radioligand for the BZ receptor, with high brain uptake, relatively slow washout of radioactivity, and appropriate regional distribution.", 
    "83": "Kava, an intoxicating beverage prepared from the pepper plant Piper methysticum, is widely consumed by the indigenous peoples in the islands of the South Pacific. As the first of a series of studies on the neuropharmacological interactions of kava with CNS receptors we tested purified pyrones and kava resin for activity on GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites in rat and mouse brain membranes. Only weak activity was observed on GABAA binding sites in washed synaptosomal membranes prepared from rat brain and this was abolished by extraction of the membranes with Triton X-100, suggesting that lipid soluble components were involved. No effects were observed on GABAB binding sites in rat brain membranes in vitro. Kava resin and pyrones exerted some weak effects on benzodiazepine binding in vitro but this did not correlate with pharmacological activity. In addition, in ex vivo studies, no effects were observed on [3H]diazepam binding to brain membranes prepared from mice in which selected kava constituents were injected intraperitoneally, whereas similarly administered diazepam (5 mg/kg) inhibited [3H]diazepam binding by greater than 95%. Similar lack of activity was observed in in vivo binding studies; injection of kava resin failed to influence the CNS binding of the benzodiazepine-receptor ligand [3H]Ro15-1788 injected into mice prior to sacrifice. The pharmacological activities of kava resin and pyrones do not appear to be explained by any significant interaction with GABA or benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "84": "This paper describes the 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonism of Y-25130 ((+-)-N-(1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl)-6-chloro-4-methyl-3-oxo-3,4-dih yd ro- 2H-1,4-benzoxazine-8-carboxamide monohydrochloride) in the rat cerebral cortex, isolated rabbit heart and isolated guinea pig ileum. In an in vitro binding assay, Y-25130 inhibited the specific binding of [3H]quipazine to 5-HT3 receptors at the synaptic membranes of the rat cerebral cortex with a Ki value of 2.9 nM, the same as that of ondansetron. Metoclopramide, 5-HT and 2-methyl-5-HT also showed an inhibitory effect, but their affinities for 5-HT3 receptors were lower than that of Y-25130. Y-25130 showed low affinity for histamine H1 receptors (IC50 = 4.4 microM) but it could not reveal any affinities for the other receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT2, dopamine D1, dopamine D2, alpha 1-adrenoceptor, alpha 2-adrenoceptor, muscarine and benzodiazepine) even at a 10 microM concentration. In the isolated rabbit heart, Y-25130 antagonized the indirect sympathomimetic responses to 5-HT (pA2 value = 10.06) and this effect was more potent than that of metoclopramide. In the isolated longitudinal smooth muscle of the guinea pig ileum, concentration-contraction effect curves for 5-HT were biphasic in the presence of ketanserin. Y-25130 shifted to the right only in the second phase of concentration-effect curves for 5-HT (pA2 value = 7.04) and its activity was more potent than that of metoclopramide. These results indicate that Y-25130 is a potent and selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist.", 
    "85": "In mice, tonic convulsive seizure induced by intravenous administration of caffeine (adenosine A1, A2 receptors antagonist) was significantly potentiated by any one of L-PIA (adenosine A1 receptor agonist), NECA (adenosine A2 receptor agonist) and 2-ClAd (adenosine A1, A2 receptors agonist). The caffeine-induced seizure was unaffected by diazepam (benzodiazepine receptor agonist), but was inhibited by Ro 15-1788 (antagonist or partial agonist). beta-DMCM (antagonist or inverse agonist) increased the seizure. Muscimol (GABA-a receptor agonist), baclofen (GABA-b receptor agonist) and AOAA (GABA transaminase inhibitor) did not show significant effect on caffeine-induced convulsion. Bicuculline (GABA-a receptor antagonist) and picrotoxin (chloride channel blocker) significantly potentiated the convulsion at the doses which did not induce it. Caffeine-induced convulsion was potentiated by NMDA with its non-convulsive dose. CPP (competitive NMDA receptor antagonist) and MK-801 (non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist) significantly inhibited the seizures. These results suggest that caffeine-induced seizure is not caused by blockade of adenosine receptors. Caffeine may act to beta-carboline sensitive benzodiazepine receptor (Type 1) which has no linkage with GABA-a receptor. Furthermore, it is implied that caffeine plays some role at NMDA receptor calcium ion channel complex.", 
    "86": "The effects of different benzodiazepine-receptor ligands on morphine withdrawal were studied: a benzodiazepine agonist, flunitrazepam; a benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil; a partial inverse benzodiazepine agonist, Ro 15-4513; and a partial benzodiazepine agonist, Ro 16-6028. Benzodiazepine-ligands were administered i.p. 30 min before naloxone-induced morphine withdrawal syndrome. Jumping behavior was significantly increased by Ro 15-4513 at 10 and 20 mg/kg. Flunitrazepam decreased jumps at all the doses used. Wet dog shakes were decreased by flumazenil and Ro 15-4513 and increased by Ro 16-6028 (only at the highest dose) and flunitrazepam. Our results show that the activation of the benzodiazepine receptor by agonists or high doses of partial agonists decreases jumping and increases wet dog shake behaviour, while the antagonists or the partial inverse agonists enhance jumping and decrease wet dog shakes. These modifications could be interpreted as an attenuation in the severity of the morphine withdrawal syndrome by benzodiazepine agonists.", 
    "87": "The outpatient follow-up care of 140 substance misusers in Kuwait was evaluated. Treatment has been traditionally based on substitution pharmacotherapy with no set objectives or criteria for outcome evaluation. Patients' structural characteristics, mode of referral, clinical diagnoses, medication prescribed and screening urine samples for drugs were examined for meaningful associations between these variables. Benzodiazepines were by far the most prescribed (94%) medication. Only 40% of the urine test results were positive for drugs containing different combinations of medications and street drugs. Unlike patients who received benzodiazepine, those who received tricyclic antidepressant medication were significantly more likely to associate with predictors of improvement. There is a need for better training of doctors and careful selection of patients in order to implement treatment strategies based on good doctor-patient relationships and well defined objectives for treatment and clear criteria of outcome.", 
    "88": "1. Strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors are primarily localized in the brainstem and spinal cord where they are the major mediators of postsynaptic inhibition. A compound which acts functionally like a glycine receptor agonist would be potentially useful as a pharmacological tool and as a therapeutic agent for treating disorders of glycinergic transmission. 2. MDL 27,531 (4-methyl-3-methylsulphonyl-5-phenyl-4H-1,2,4-triazole) blocked strychnine-induced tonic extensor seizures in mice following either intraperitoneal (ED50 = 12.8 mg kg-1; 30 min) or oral (ED50 = 7.3 mg kg-1; 30 min) administration. Time course studies revealed a maximal effect at 30-60 min, though significant activity was still seen after 24 h. 3. MDL 27,531 was selective in antagonizing strychnine seizures and little or no activity was seen against seizures produced by other chemical convulsants (bicuculline; quinolinic acid; mercaptopropionic acid); by electrical stimuli (maximal electroshock); or by sensory stimuli (audiogenic seizure susceptible mice). MDL 27,531 blocked pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures with an ED50 = 55 mg kg-1. This profile differed from those of the anticonvulsants diazepam, valproic acid, and diphenylhydantoin. 4. The antagonism of strychnine seizures by MDL 27,531 occurred at doses that did not produce signs of sedation (suppression of spontaneous motor activity), motor ataxia (disruption of rotarod performance), muscle relaxation (inhibition of morphine-induced Straub tail), or CNS depression (potentiation of hexobarbitone sleep time). MDL 27,531 had less side effect potential (as derived from ratios obtained from the above measures) relative to those of the known muscle relaxants diazepam and baclofen. 5. Although MDL 27,531 behaved functionally like a selective agonist at the strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor, the compound did not alter the in vitro binding of [3H]-strychnine to mice brainstem/spinal cord membranes at concentrations of up to 100 microM. In further in vitro binding assays, MDL 27,531 at concentrations of up to 100 microM, did not displace the binding of [3H]-muscimol, [3H]-flunitrazepam, or[\"S]-t-butylbicyclophosphorthionate to rat cortical membranes. These ligands bind to the 7y-aminobutyric acid (GABA), benzodiazepine, and picrotoxin-convulsant binding sites, respectively.6. MDL 27,531 (10-100mgkg-', i.p.) enhanced binding of the benzodiazepine antagonist [3H]-Ro15-1788 to mouse cerebral cortex in vivo without directly affecting GABA levels.7. Ro 15-1788 (16, 32 mg kg-') significantly blocked the MDL 27,531 antagonism of strychnineinduced seizures, though this antagonism was not competitive. The same doses of Ro 15-1788 produced parallel rightward shifts in the dose-response curves for diazepam inhibition of pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures, consistent with a competitive antagonism.8. Thus, MDL 27,531 acts functionally like an agonist at the strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor in its capacity to reverse selectively strychnine-induced seizures. Though the precise mechanism of action of MDL 27,531 is unknown, MDL 27,531 may act at an allosteric site on the strychnine-sensitive receptor which produces agonist-like activity.", 
    "89": "In cortical areas associated with an epileptic focus, there is, in the majority of cases, a correlation between decreased benzodiazepine (Bz) receptor binding, detectable with 123I-Iomazenil, and decreased blood flow. A patient with focal epilepsy due to a localized abnormality in cortical differentiation is presented who showed a marked focal decrease in Bz receptor binding and a normal 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT. Based on this case the relation between blood flow and Bz receptor binding in epileptic foci is discussed.", 
    "90": "The GABAA receptor chloride channel complex interacts with various categories of sedatives, including the benzodiazepines, and possibly ethanol and volatile general anesthetics. Thus, specific binding of tritiated derivatives of a benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, and an agonist, flunitrazepam, to rat brain membrane fragments was monitored at equilibrium in the presence and absence of anesthetizing concentrations of ethanol and diethylether. Ethanol produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of [3H]flumazenil binding, which was not reversed by the GABAA receptor competitive antagonist bicuculline, but had no effect on [3H]flunitrazepam binding. Both ethanol and diethylether decreased the affinity of the benzodiazepine site for [3H]flumazenil. These data indicate that ethanol and diethylether have GABA-independent effects at the benzodiazepine sites of the GABAA receptor. These findings are inconsistent with a two-state functional model of the benzodiazepine site and, instead, support a model containing a specific, antagonist-favored conformation.", 
    "91": "Neuronal cell lines provide a source of pure populations of neurons and allow the properties of many neurotransmitter receptors to be studied. However, none of these cells have been reported to express functional gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors. Indeed, there have been no reports of cell lines expressing functional amino acid receptors. Using biochemical and electrophysiological techniques, we have identified a neuronal cell line expressing functional GABAA receptors. Membranes from immortalized hypothalamic (GT1-7) neurons bound [3H]muscimol but not [3H]flunitrazepam. GABA-activated chloride currents, recorded from GT1-7 cells, were blocked by bicuculline and Zn2+ but were insensitive to diazepam. These results suggest that GABAA receptors on GT1-7 cells lack gamma subunits. The neurosteroid 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one and pentobarbital both modulated GABAA receptors in these cells. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of the cells revealed the presence of mRNAs encoding alpha 1, beta 1, and beta 3 polypeptides. GT1-7 cells provide a useful model system for studying the regulation of GABAA receptor polypeptide expression.", 
    "92": "Exposure to acrylamide (3-10 mg/kg body weight) was found to be lethal for protein-deficient pregnant rats as evidenced by their increased mortality. It had no such effect on the normal protein diet fed pregnant and nonpregnant rats and the protein-malnourished nonpregnant rats. Protein deficiency during pregnancy caused a significant decrease in the activity of brain monoamine oxidase and acetylcholinesterase and striatal [3H]spiperone binding, known to label dopamine receptors; had no significant effect on the binding of 3H-QNB (quinuclidinyl benzilate) to cerebellar and [3H]diazepam to frontocortical membranes, known to label muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors, respectively; and had no significant effect on brain glutathione (GSH) levels in comparison with pregnant rats fed normal protein diet. Exposure to acrylamide (2 mg/kg body weight) in protein-malnourished pregnant rats caused a marked decrease in the activity of monoamine oxidase and acetylcholinesterase and also in the binding of [3H]spiperone, [3H]QNB, and [3H]diazepam to striatal, cerebellar, and frontocortical membranes, respectively. Kinetic studies revealed that decreased binding of these ligands in the specific brain regions were due to decreased receptor sites (Bmax). A reduction in the brain glutathione content was also observed in these animals in comparison with those fed a low-protein diet during pregnancy. Pregnant rats fed a normal-protein diet on acrylamide exposure, however, showed no such biochemical changes in comparison with the pregnant rats fed normal protein diet. Also, no effect on any of the parameters studied was observed in the adult nonpregnant rats fed a low-protein diet (for 18 d) and those exposed to the monomer (d 6-17) fed either a normal- or low-protein diet in comparison with respective controls. The results indicate that pregnancy under conditions of malnutrition modifies the susceptibility of pregnant rats toward acrylamide.", 
    "93": "Rats were exposed to either 80 escapable shocks or yoked inescapable shocks and then injected with several hypnotic doses of sodium pentobarbital, midazolam, or ethanol; their sleep-time duration was compared with that of naive controls. Inescapable shock exposure resulted in a significant increase in ethanol-induced sleep time compared with the escapable shock and naive control groups. Both escape and yoked groups showed an increase in barbiturate-induced sleep time compared with controls, although no difference was observed for midazolam. Acute stress (twenty 5-s inescapable shocks) did not alter the depressant-induced sleep time for any of the drugs tested. These results illustrate the importance of psychological aspects of stress and its influence on the potency of certain depressants.", 
    "94": "Steroids that enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor function in the central nervous system allosterically modulate the binding of the convulsant chloride channel ligand [35S]-t-butyl bicyclophosphorothionate. When assayed in membrane homogenates and in tissue sections by autoradiography, concentration-dependence curves vary with respect to both brain region and the nature of the steroid. Alphaxalone and endogenous steroid hormone metabolites inhibit the binding of [35S]-t-butyl bicyclophosphorothionate in some regions, enhance it in others and give biphasic concentration-dependence in others, apparently the result of algebraic summation of two effects involving regional-dependent enhancement or inhibition. The alphaxalone effect is additive with that produced by adding GABA to the binding assays in some regions, but synergistic in other areas. Likewise, the effect of GABA is inhibited completely by saturating concentrations of the antagonist bicuculline methochloride in some areas but only partially in others, and completely or partially reversed by the convulsant benzodiazepine Ro5-4864, depending on region. The granule cell and molecular layers of cerebellum are particularly different in these allosteric interactions. The heterogeneity of binding behavior is consistent with the presence of multiple GABAA receptor subtypes in the brain. Regional variation in subunit gene expression apparently produces a family of hetero-oligomeric GABAA receptors with different biological and pharmacological properties, including qualitative and quantitative differences in modulation by neuroactive steroids.",

The binding of AHN 683 to rat renal membranes measured by fluorescence techniques was saturable with a maximum number of binding sites of 2.3 +/- 0.3 pmol/mg of protein. The KD (40.4 +/- 2.2 nM) estimated by fluorescence was in good agreement with the Ki (77.4 +/- 13.5 nM) obtained in competition studies with [3H] Ro 5-4864. AHN 683 exhibited rapid and reversible binding which was significantly reduced by the histidine modifying reagent, diethylpyrocarbonate. The potencies of a pair of isoquinoline carboxamide enantiomers as well as other structurally diverse peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor ligands estimated by inhibition of AHN 683 binding were in good agreement with values obtained using radioligand binding techniques. AHN 683 binding was unaffected by compounds that do not recognize peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors. Moreover, a significant increase in the maximum number of binding sites of AHN 683 to rat renal membranes after chronic furosemide treatment (29.2%, P less than .02) was comparable to the increase measured using [3H]PK 11195 (35.6%, P less than .001). These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using fluorescent ligand binding techniques to quantitatively characterize peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "96": "Intracellular electrophysiological recordings were made from myenteric neurons of guinea pig ileum maintained in vitro. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), applied by superfusion (1-300 microM) or by pressure ejection from a fine-tipped pipette positioned near the impaled neuron, depolarized some neurons. GABA-induced depolarizations were mimicked by muscimol (1-100 microM) applied by superfusion and were blocked by bicuculline (30 microM) and picrotoxin (60 microM). The estimated reversal potential for the GABA-induced depolarization was -18 +/- 3 mV when recordings were made with potassium chloride (2 M)-filled microelectrodes. These results indicate that GABA was acting at GABAA receptors on myenteric neurons. GABAA-mediated depolarizations (GABA applied by pressure ejection) were potentiated by the steroid anesthetic, alfaxalone (0.5 microM) (51 +/- 15%, n = 6), by pentobarbital (60 microM) (29 +/- 4%, n = 7) and diazepam (0.3 microM) (41 +/- 14%, n = 7). Alfaxalone (greater than 1 microM) and pentobarbital (greater than 100 microM) mimicked the GABA-induced depolarization. Cortisol (30-1000 pM) did not alter the amplitude of GABA responses when GABA was applied by pressure ejection (n = 6) or by superfusion (n = 6). These data indicate that GABAA receptors on myenteric neurons contain binding sites for some steroids, barbiturates and benzodiazepines and that responses mediated at enteric GABAA receptors can be modified by drugs acting at these allosteric binding sites.", 
    "97": "The regulation of individual muscarinic receptor subtypes in rat cerebral cortex/dorsal hippocampus was examined following 14-day administration of the nonselective antagonist atropine. Total muscarinic receptor density increased 24%, from 2196 fmol/mg to 2722 fmol/mg. The nature of this increase was examined using a panel of antisera selective for the m1 to m5 muscarinic receptors. Thus, 97% of all cortical/hippocampal receptors were accounted for by immunoprecipitation. Three subtypes were observed to increase significantly in density: m1 receptor from 824 to 982 fmol/mg (19%, P less than .05); m2 receptor from 476 to 519 fmol/mg (9%, N.S.); m3 receptor from 259 to 438 fmol/mg (69%, P less than .001); m4 receptor from 574 to 638 fmol/mg (11%, P less than .05); and the m5 receptor from 23 to 38 fmol/mg (65%, N.S.). Receptors coupled to the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides (m1, m3, m5) appeared to be preferentially up-regulated (32% over control levels, P less than .001) compared with those coupled to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (m2, m4; 10% over control levels, P less than .05). The absolute density of the molecularly defined m1 and m4 receptors, which reportedly possess the highest affinity for pirenzepine (M1), increased 16% (P less than .05), whereas the density of receptors having the lowest affinity for pirenzepine (m2, m3 and m5) increased 31% (P less than .001) with atropine treatment. When the increase in total receptor density was examined with [3H]pirenzepine, the 16% elevation in high-affinity (m1 and m4) sites was not detected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
