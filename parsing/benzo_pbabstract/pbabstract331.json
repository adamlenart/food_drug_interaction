    "1": "This prospective cohort study included 2765 self-reporting subjects from the Duke Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly. The subjects were cognitively intact at baseline (1986-1987) and alive at follow-up data collection 3 years later. Cognitive function was assessed with the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (unimpaired versus impaired and change in score) and on the basis of the number of errors on the individual domains of the Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test. Benzodiazepine use was determined during in-home interviews and classified by dose, half-life, and duration. Covariates included demographic characteristics, health status, and health behaviors.", 
    "2": "After control for covariates, current users of benzodiazepine made more errors on the memory test (beta coefficient, 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.10 to 0.61) than nonusers. Further assessment of the negative effects on memory among current users suggested a dose response in which users taking the recommended or higher dose made more errors (beta coefficient, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.88) and a duration response in which long-term users made more errors (beta coefficient, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.73) than nonusers. Users of agents with long half-lives and users of agents with short half-lives both had increased memory impairment (beta coefficient, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.64 and beta coefficient, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.75, respectively) relative to nonusers. Previous benzodiazepine use was unrelated to memory problems, and current and previous benzodiazepine use was unrelated to level of cognitive functioning as measured with the other 4 tests.", 
    "3": "The results suggested that current benzodiazepine use, especially in recommended or higher doses, is associated with worse memory among community-dwelling elderly.", 
    "4": "The effect of ondansetron was investigated in wrap-restraint and conditioned emotional (footshock) stress induced colonic hypermotility in rat. Ondansetron was administered in doses of 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg, sc. In wrap-restraint group, ondansetron dose-dependently reduced the fecal output to baseline levels (0.51 \u00b1 0.20 gm/rat, 0.48 \u00b1 0.38 gm/rat, 0.38 \u00b1 0.16 gm/rat with 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg respectively). Diazepam, 5 mg/kg and atropine, 1 mg/kg also decreased the fecal output in this model. In footshock group, ordansetron did not affect the emotional stress induced increase in fecal pellet output. Diazepam and atropine however, decreased the fecal output in this model also.", 
    "5": "Fifty four female poultry birds of 3, 4 and 5 months age were given nikethamide and diazepam intramuscularly as stimulant and depresent, respectively. The effects of above two drugs on the levels of biogenic amines were measured Fluorometrically in the rostral, middle and caudal portions of poultry brain. Diazepam increased the levels of 5-HT and dopamine in the caudal and middle portion of the brain respectively. The levels of dopamine and non-epinephrine increased with the nikethamide administration and also with increasing age of the birds, but the effect of diazepam was inconsistant. Unlike the levels of dopamine and nor-epinephrine which were maximum in middle protion, the epinephrine concentration was highest in the caudal portion of brain. It was concluded that 5-HT acted as inhibitory particularly in the caudal portion, whereas, catecholamines as excitatory neurotransmitter of the poultry brain. The increased levels of catecholamines in the poultry brain with increasing age speaks of their positive role in sexual maturity and subsequently in reproduction of the birds.", 
    "6": "Replacement of key structural or binding elements of a peptide lead with nonpeptide components can improve affinity and metabolic stability (1-5). Such a strategy was successfully applied to the generation of potent, cell-permeable inhibitors of Ras famesyltransferase (FTase) (6,7). The central pair of amino acids in the CAAX tetrapeptide was replaced with the nonpeptide scaffold 3-methylamino-1-carboxymethyl-2,3-dihydro-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one, (N-Me)BZA, shown below.", 
    "7": "Five commercially available immunoassay test kits (SYVA EMIT(R) d.a.u(TM), SYVA EMIT(R) II assay, Abbott FPIA, Cozart Auto-Lyte(R) and Roche Abuscreen(R) Online(TM), all used for the benzodiazepine group of drugs) were evaluated for their ability to detect flunitrazepam, its major urinary metabolite, 7-aminoflunitrazepam, and several other benzodiazepines at serial dilutions (final concentration 25-1000 ng/ml) in drug-free urine and in urines following oral administration of flunitrazepam (1-3 mg). For comparison, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to measure urinary levels of 7-aminoflunitrazepam. Levels of drug detected in the study were compared with the cross-reactivities presented by the manufacturers for each individual kit. One to three mg doses of flunitrazepam were taken by volunteers and levels excreted in urine analysed over several hours. A positive response was obtained in several samples from volunteers who had taken 2 mg or 3 mg doses, but not a 1 mg dose. Thirty-five clinical samples from the individuals suspected of benzodiazepine abuse were also examined. The results were not consistent among the kits evaluated.We conclude that the test kits evaluated in this study do not detect flunitrazepam reliably, due primarily to their poor sensitivities.", 
    "8": "The present study was performed in order to establish, with a simple and safe neuroendocrinological test, whether alcoholism is associated with alterations in sensitivity to benzodiazepines. For this purpose, we tested the stimulatory effects of diazepam on GH secretion. An intravenous bolus of 10 mg diazepam was injected in 51 (33-51-year-old) alcoholic men after at least 5 weeks of abstinence and in 20 age- and weight-matched normal controls. On a different occasion, a control test with placebo (physiological saline) was performed in the same subjects. Diazepam but not placebo administration induced a striking increase of GH secretion in the normal controls. In contrast, neither diazepam nor placebo treatment significantly changed the basal serum GH levels in alcoholic men. These data show that alcoholism is associated with disrupted benzodiazepine activity on the hypothalamic-pituitary control of GH secretion. The simplicity of the diazepam GH-releasing test makes the drug suitable for clinical research in alcoholism.", 
    "9": "The objective of this study was to assemble expert clinical experience and judgment regarding the treatment of panic disorder in a systematic, quantitative manner, particularly with respect to changes during the past 5 years. A panel of 73 internationally recognized experts in the field of pharmacotherapy of anxiety and depression was constituted by multistage peer nomination. Sixty-six experts completed a questionnaire in 1992, and 51 of those completed a follow-up questionnaire in 1997. This report focuses on the experts' responses to questions about therapeutic options as they relate to a vignette describing a typical case of panic disorder. The preferred initial treatment strategy in 1992 (59%) and in 1997 (55%) was a combination of medication with cognitive behavioral therapy. The vast majority of the expert panel included a medication in their recommendations--91% in 1992 and 90% in 1997. Experts recommending a medication for panic in 1992 chose as first-line treatment a benzodiazepine (35%), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI, 7%), an older antidepressant (33%), or a combination of medications (25%), principally a benzodiazepine plus an older antidepressant (19%). In 1997, fewer chose a benzodiazepine (15%) or an older antidepressant (11%) alone, whereas 33% chose an SSRI alone. More experts chose a combination of medications in 1997 (39%), and the increase was attributable mainly to the choice of a benzodiazepine plus an SSRI (17%). Overall, there was only a small decline in recommendations for benzodiazepines, whereas the increased choice of SSRIs came largely at the expense of the older antidepressants. As second-line medications for panic should their first-line choice fail, the experts in 1997 recommended a benzodiazepine (7%), an SSRI (15%), an older antidepressant (28%), or a combination of medications (50%), most often a benzodiazepine plus an older antidepressant (21%) or a benzodiazepine plus an SSRI (17%). (Experts were not asked to recommend second-line treatment in 1992). Thus, in case of unsatisfactory response, the experts' choices shifted from benzodiazepines and SSRIs alone toward the older antidepressants alone or combinations of an antidepressant plus a benzodiazepine. This report concluded that combined cognitive behavioral therapy plus medication was highly favored by the experts as the initial treatment strategy for panic disorder. Over the past 5 years, SSRIs displaced older antidepressants as the experts' choice for first-line pharmacotherapy of panic disorder. In case of an unsatisfactory response, the experts more often recommended an older antidepressant or a combination of an antidepressant plus a benzodiazepine. According to the experts' judgments, the benzodiazepines, especially combined with an antidepressant, remain mainstays of pharmacotherapy for panic disorder.", 
    "10": "This article compares panic disorder (PD) medications and discusses long-term therapy. In a review of the literature, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and benzodiazepines prove effective in treating PD. MAOIs treat comorbid depression; frequent side effects are dizziness and orthostatic hypotension. SSRIs are better tolerated than MAOIs, producing mild anticholinergic effects, but also producing gastrointestinal side effects and sexual dysfunction. Benzodiazepines are generally well tolerated when titrated gradually; moderate sedation is the most common short-term side effect. Long-term risks are physical dependence and withdrawal reactions. One hundred six PD patients were enrolled in a double-blind, 8-month, placebo-controlled trial of alprazolam and imipramine. In the 8-week short-term phase, daily dosages were titrated up to 10 mg/day of alprazolam and 250 mg/day of imipramine. The greatest number of dropouts occurred during this phase (lack of improvement and/or side effects). Alprazolam patients had a significantly more rapid onset of improvement and lower adverse events and attrition rates. In the 6-month maintenance period, patients continued short-term treatment. Patients receiving either alprazolam or imipramine developed tolerance to some side effects. At maintenance-phase completion, 62% of the alprazolam-group patients and 26% of both the imipramine- and placebo-group patients were panic free (p<0.01). Dosages were tapered to zero over 3 weeks; one third of the alprazolam patients could not discontinue. During the unblinded, 15-month follow-up, patients received open treatment selected by personal physicians on an as-needed basis. At the end of follow-up, all patients were reassessed. Patients who had completed both short-term and maintenance phases were far more likely to be panic-free (85% vs. 55%; p<0.01). PD is chronic and recurrent, and 8 months is an effective treatment period. Maintenance treatment does not lead to tolerance, even with benzodiazepines. Dose tapering must be very gradual. Completion of a long-term maintenance program strongly predicts remission.", 
    "11": "Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been combined with pharmacotherapy in the treatment of panic disorder in three ways: (1) to treat agoraphobic symptoms in the condition of panic with agoraphobia; (2) to reduce withdrawal effects during drug taper; and (3) to treat panic attacks. Exposure treatment and pharmacotherapy have a modest additive effect, although more patients drop out of exposure therapy combined with imipramine treatment compared with exposure therapy alone. CBT reduces symptoms of withdrawal from alprazolam and other benzodiazepines and improves the outcome of drug treatment. At present, sufficient data are not available to determine whether the effects of CBT combined with drug therapy are additive in treating panic disorder. The results of a large trial are awaited. Current CBT consists of 12 sessions and is not widely offered to patients because of cost considerations. Efforts are being made to decrease the number of sessions necessary by improving cognitive techniques. One of these models is the subject of an ongoing trial. Finally, efforts to educate and counsel patients in the clinical setting regarding the psychopathology of panic attacks may improve the outcome of pharmacotherapy.", 
    "12": "Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are the preferred pharmacological agents for treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal. Treatment with BZDs can be administered on an out-patient basis for subjects experiencing mild to moderate withdrawal and on an in-patient basis for the most severe forms of withdrawal. The efficacy of BZDs for long-term treatment of alcoholism has been more controversial. Controlled studies indicate that BZD treatment does not improve abstinence rate. Most reviews of drug treatment of alcoholism conclude that routine use of BZDs is not indicated on a long-term basis. However, the clinical reality is that many alcoholics are treated by BZDs during detoxification and then continue to receive them for the treatment of anxiety disorders or insomnia, often secondary to alcohol dependence. After a review of the biological properties of BZDs related to their therapeutic issues, this review discusses the major indications for BZD treatment of alcoholism. BZDs are first prescribed to prevent and treat symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Indication of BZD administration during alcohol withdrawal and criteria of choice of an agent according to its half-life or its route of administration are discussed. The different protocols of BZD treatment during withdrawal are considered (e.g. loading techniques, symptom-triggered therapy). The use of BZDs in the treatment of anxiety associated with alcohol dependence is examined. Among unwanted effects, risk of abuse, memory impairment, confusion, and delirium are described. Finally, practical guidelines for the use of BZDs in the treatment of alcoholism are proposed.",

The new compounds possess marked anticonvulsant properties and, in analogy to 1, antagonize seizures induced by AMPA. In addition, when compared to the model compound 1, compounds 3 show a longer-lasting anticonvulsant activity and a lower toxicity.", 
    "14": "The possibility that nitric oxide is somehow involved in the early bioelectrical disturbances following spinal cord injury in relation to the later pathophysiology of the spinal cord was examined in a rat model of spinal cord trauma. A focal trauma to the rat spinal cord was produced by an incision of the right dorsal horn of the T 10-11 segments under urethane anaesthesia. The spinal cord evoked potentials (SCEP) were recorded using epidural electrodes placed over the T9 and T12 segments of the cord following supramaximal stimulation of the right tibial and sural nerves in the hind leg. Trauma to the spinal cord significantly attenuated the SCEP amplitude (about 60%) immediately after injury which persisted up to 1 h. However, a significant increase in SCEP latency was seen at the end of 5 h after trauma. These spinal cord segments exhibited profound upregulation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) immunoreactivity, and the development of edema and cell injury. Pretreatment with a serotonin synthesis inhibitor drug p-chlorophenylalanine (p-CPA) or an anxiolytic drug diazepam significantly attenuated the decrease in SCEP amplitude, upregulation of NOS, edema and cell injury. On the other hand, no significant reduction in SCEP amplitude, NOS immunolabelling, edema or cell changes were seen after injury in rats pretreated with L-NAME. These observations suggest that nitric oxide is somehow involved in the early disturbances of SCEP and contribute to the later pathophysiology of spinal cord injury.", 
    "15": "Azole antifungal agents may impair hepatic clearance of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450-3A isoforms. The imidazopyridine hypnotic agent zolpidem is metabolized in humans in part by P450-3A, as well as by a number of other cytochromes. Potential interactions of zolpidem with 3 commonly prescribed azole derivatives were evaluated in a controlled clinical study.", 
    "16": "In a randomized, double-blind, 5-way, crossover, clinical pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study, 12 volunteers received (A) zolpidem placebo plus azole placebo, (B) 5 mg zolpidem plus azole placebo (C) zolpidem plus ketoconazole, (D) zolpidem plus itraconazole, and (E) zolpidem plus fluconazole.", 
    "17": "Mean apparent oral clearance of zolpidem when given with placebo was 422 mL/min, and elimination half-life was 1.9 hours. Clearance was significantly reduced to 250 mL/min when zolpidem was given with ketoconazole, and half-life was prolonged to 2.4 hours. Coadministration of zolpidem with itraconazole or fluconazole also reduced clearance (320 and 338 mL/min), but differences compared to the zolpidem plus placebo treatment did not reach significance. Zolpidem-induced benzodiazepine agonist effects (increased electrocardiographic beta activity, digit-symbol substitution test impairment, and delayed recall) during the first 4 hours after dosage were enhanced by ketoconazole but not by itraconazole or fluconazole.", 
    "18": "Coadministration of zolpidem with ketoconazole impairs zolpidem clearance and enhances its benzodiazepine-like agonist pharmacodynamic effects. Itraconazole and fluconazole had a small influence on zolpidem kinetics and dynamics. The findings are consistent with in vitro studies of differentially impaired zolpidem metabolism by azole derivatives.", 
    "19": "In the present study, the effects of alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, ethanol and haloperidol in the strychnine-potentiated startle response paradigm were investigated. Because strychnine increases control startle levels without fear-conditioning, no central state of fear exists. When anxiolytic drugs reduce the fear-induced potentiation of the startle response without reducing the strychnine-induced startle potentiation, their attenuating effect on startle potentiation in the fear-potentiated startle response paradigm can more likely be attributed to their anxiolytic properties. The selected drugs, which effectively reduced the fear-induced startle potentiation in an earlier study, indeed did not selectively affect the strychnine-induced startle potentiation, supporting the notion that the dose-dependent reduction of startle potentiation due to anxiolytic drugs in the fear-potentiated startle response paradigm does not reflect a \"non-specific\" disruption of startle behavior.", 
    "20": "Studies of the capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MEKC) behaviour of 1,4-benzodiazepines have seen application in subject areas such as the development of pharmaceuticals, therapeutic drug monitoring and forensic toxicology. In the development of pharmaceuticals, pKa determinations by CZE can be used in preclinical studies whereas analytical data on the detection and determination of 1,4-benzodiazepines is of value primarily in raw material/formulation assay and in the analysis of body fluids in clinical studies. The capillary electrophoresis (CE) techniques, which generally have inferior limits of detection (LOD) to rival techniques such as gas chromatography (GC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), are particularly applicable in forensic toxicology where reasonably high concentrations of these drugs can be encountered. It is anticipated that, with the interfacing of CZE and capillary electrochromatography (CEC) with mass spectrometry (MS) techniques, the excellent selectivity of CZE and particularly CEC will be effectively combined with the sensitivity of MS and the identification capabilities of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and MS hyphenated (MSn) techniques.", 
    "21": "We report a high-performance liquid chromatography method for clonazepam determination in plasma. The use of a synthetic silica-based stationary phase markedly improved clonazepam resolution compared to standard reversed-phase columns. A liquid-liquid extraction was used, associated with reversed-phase chromatography, gradient elution and ultraviolet detection. Accuracy and precision were satisfactory at therapeutic concentrations. Selectivity was studied for benzodiazepines or other antiepileptic drugs, with particular attention to newly marketed drugs i.e., gabapentine and vigabatrin. No interfering substance was evidenced. Under the conditions described, it was possible to quantify clonazepam at nanogram level even when carbamazepine was present at therapeutic concentrations.", 
    "22": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic assay for the quantification of the oxidative metabolites of flunitrazepam, 3-hydroxyflunitrazepam and desmethylflunitrazepam, in human liver microsomal incubations was developed. Both metabolites were quantifiable in a single assay following a solvent extraction and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. Standard curve concentrations for both metabolites ranged from 0.2 to 10 microM. Assay performance was determined using quality control samples and the intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision as determined by the coefficient of variations which were less than 15% (0.5-6 microM) for both metabolites. This method provides good precision and accuracy for use in kinetic studies of the oxidative metabolism of flunitrazepam in human liver microsomes.", 
    "23": "Histamine H2-receptor antagonistic properties of the anti-ulcer agent T-593, (+/-)-(E)-1-[2-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl] -3-[2[[[5-(methylamino)methyl-2-furyl]methyl]thio] ethyl] -2-(methylsulfonyl)guanidine, were investigated on [14C]aminopyrine accumulation in isolated canine gastric mucosal cells and compared with those of ranitidine and famotidine. The potency of T-593-inhibition of [14C]aminopyrine accumulation stimulated by 10(-4) M histamine, with an IC50 value of 1.85 x 10(-6) M, was approximately 5 times greater than that of ranitidine, but half that of famotidine. T-593 did not affect [14C]aminopyrine accumulation stimulated by carbachol or dibutyryl-cAMP. T-593 depressed the maximal response of the histamine concentration-response curve with a dose-related displacement to the right, indicating that the nature of the H2-receptor antagonism of T-593 was insurmountable and included non-competitive inhibition. The inhibitory efficacy of T-593 was time-dependent and was retained after the cells were washed. The inhibitory potency of (-)-S-T-593, one of the enantiomers, on the [14C]aminopyrine accumulation stimulated by histamine was approximately twice that of racemic T-593 and it also behaved as an insurmountable H2-receptor antagonist. However, the potency of (+)-R-T-593 was markedly weak. These results suggest that T-593 has H2-receptor antagonism that is insurmountable and this agent slowly associates and dissociates with the receptor in isolated canine gastric mucosal cells and that the specific substance causing H2-receptor antagonism is (-)-S-T-593.",

    "25": "Sai-boku-to or an antianxiety drug (diazepam) with vitamin B complex was administered orally for 3 months to each of 200 patients with glossodynia. Clinical examination evaluated the following subjective symptoms: pain, burning sensation, and discomfort. Effectiveness was evaluated as follows: \"markedly effective,\" all 3 symptoms disappeared; \"effective,\" pain improved; \"ineffective,\" no improvement in pain.", 
    "26": "The effective rates were 70% after 1 month, 85% after 2 months, and 92% after 3 months of administration of Sai-boku-to (the Kampo group) and 74% after 1 month, 71% after 2 months, and 69% after 3 months of administration of the antianxiety drug with vitamin B complex (the control group). No significant side effect was noted in the Kampo group, but sleepiness was recorded in 33 cases in the control group.",

    "28": "Satoyoshi syndrome is a rare neurological disorder of unknown etiology characterized by progressive muscle spasms, alopecia, diarrhea and skeletal abnormalities. We here describe a 25-year-old man who developed symptoms similar to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). He began to have the clinical characteristics of Satoyoshi syndrome at the age of 12 years. He was admitted to hospitals many times with painful muscle spasms and pyrexia in the early stage of the disease. He received steroid pulse therapy and oral prednisone at the age of 19, the extent and frequency of the spells being reduced thereafter. He was admitted to our hospital due to recurrence of his usual muscle spasms. He was treated with midazolam intravenously to relieve severe muscle ache, pain in the left shoulder, and insomnia. About 90 minutes later, he became comatose, with the following manifestations: hyperthermia, low blood pressure, tachycardia, profuse perspiration, acute respiratory failure, and ensuing cardiac arrest. He developed rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, hepatic damage, and diffuse intravascular coagulation. Serum creatine kinase level was elevated to 306,910 IU. He died of multiple organ failure 13 days after admission. His symptoms resembled NMS and malignant hyperthermia (MH). None of patients with Satoyoshi syndrome accompanied by NMS or MH have been reported. It remains to be clarified whether midazolam administration induces NMS in Satoyoshi syndrome. Nevertheless, careful attention should be paid when one administers midazolam to patients with this syndrome.", 
    "29": "The effect of stress on the behavioural changes caused by diazepam withdrawal was studied in mice. Diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) or vehicle was injected intraperitoneally twice a day for 2 weeks. When the last vehicle or diazepam injection had been administered to the mice, 12 h later, the mice were subjected to small platform stress exposure or left in their home cages. Small platform stress was induced by placing mice on small platforms (3.5 cm diameter) surrounded by water for 24 h. This experimental model contains several factors of stress like rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation, isolation, immobilization and falling into the water. The plus-maze test was carried out with stressed mice as well as with mice not subjected to stress. Small platform stress induced an anxiolytic effect and diazepam withdrawal--an anxiogenic effect in the plus-maze test. Small platform stress also attenuated the anxiogenic effect of diazepam withdrawal. On the basis of this data it was proposed that small platform stress counteracts the anxiogenic effect of diazepam withdrawal in the plus-maze test. It was also proposed that the effect of stress on the signs of benzodiazepine withdrawal depends on the characteristics and duration of stress.", 
    "30": "Dyspnea is a complex subjective experience that is common in terminal illness. Patients may present at any time during the course of their illness, although prevalence increases with disease progression. Dyspnea has physical, psychological, social and spiritual components; without recognizing how each of these contributes to the total suffering of dyspnea, management is unlikely to be successful. The management of dyspnea involves both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment. The main pharmacological palliative treatments are oxygen, opioids, and benzodiazepines, but the evidence to support these treatments is limited. More research is urgently needed to establish the efficacy of current treatments and to identify new ones.", 
    "31": "Fast, rhythmic discharges, at gamma frequencies, have been evoked in the CA1 region of the hippocampus by tetanic stimulation applied via pairs of electrodes placed close to the pyramidal layer. The discharges had a latency of 65-225 ms and a frequency of 60-100 Hz; they were synchronous (phase lag < 2 ms) when recorded from sites 0.4-0.8 mm apart. Diazepam (5-15 microM) and propofol (5 microM) reduced the frequency by 15-26%, but had no significant effect on synchrony or phase lag, suggesting that the generation and synchrony of this rhythm are pharmacologically distinct. 10 microM propofol had a more marked effect and, when frequency fell by approximately 50%, synchrony was also reduced.", 
    "32": "Although past research has described changes in the density of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor in brain and in peripheral organs in response to stressors and steroid hormone exposure, their combined influence had yet to be determined. This study examined the effect of swim-stress as a function of ovarian hormone administration on the binding of an isoquinoline carboxamide derivative, [3H]PK 11195, in brain and peripheral tissues. In olfactory bulb and adrenal gland, stress increased peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density in ovariectomized rats with and without estradiol and progesterone replacement injection, even when compared with unstressed animals treated with hormones, where estradiol + progesterone decreased peripheral benzodiazepine receptor number in olfactory bulb, but estradiol and estradiol + progesterone increased it in adrenal gland. In frontal cortex, stress decreased peripheral benzodiazepine receptor number, an effect that was reversed by estradiol. In hippocampus estradiol decreased peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density in unstressed animals and estradiol + progesterone decreased peripheral benzodiazepine receptor number in unstressed and stressed animals. In cerebellum, stress, estradiol and estradiol + progesterone alone decreased peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density. In uterus of unstressed controls, estradiol + progesterone increased peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density, and stress produced a further increase in steroid-treated females. Stress did not affect peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density in kidney, except in animals that received estradiol + progesterone injections, where swim-stress produced a significant decrease in peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density. Thus, steroid hormones regulate peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density in endocrine organs and brain, and the hormonal state of the organism modifies the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor response to stress in a tissue- and brain region-specific manner, suggesting that the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor may play a pivotal role in an integrated response to stress.", 
    "33": "A 59-years-old man with oesophageal cancer (T3NXMo) presented with trismus, dysarthria and diaphoresis. Later, he developed opisthotonus and generalized spasms. Despite negative blood cultures and sufficiently high anti-tetanus-titres, tetanus was suspected, on clinical grounds. He was intubated and treated with tetanus toxoid, human antitetanus immunoglobulin, benzylpenicillin, propofol, benzodiazepines, vecuronium, and sufentanil, and recovered gradually. Tetanus is caused by Clostridium tetani, a Gram-positive rod capable of remaining present latently in the body for years. Absence of a visible external wound suggests that the oesophageal mucosal cancer lesion could have served as portal of entry or that endogenous reactivation of latent tetanus bacteria had taken place.", 
    "34": "Derivatization of the free cys3,4 in human albumin, which is reported to occur under physiological conditions, has been performed in vitro by reaction of the protein with ethacrynic acid. This modification has been investigated by mass spectrometry and circular dichroism. Ethacrynic acid has been proven to bind human albumin either covalently and non-covalently. This post-translational modification does not determine significant changes in the secondary structure of the protein, as shown by the comparable circular dichroism spectra of the native and the modified proteins. Furthermore, the binding properties of the human albumin samples have been investigated by circular dichroism and equilibrium dialysis. The affinity to the higher affinity binding sites does not change either for drugs binding to site I, like phenylbutazone, or to site II, like diazepam, while a small but significant increase has been observed for bilirubin, known to bind to site III. Nevertheless significant decreases of the affinity at the lower affinity binding sites of the modified protein were observed for both drugs binding to site I or to site II.", 
    "35": "Extracellular single-unit discharges were obtained from 165 spontaneously active neurons within the region of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) by glass microelectrode from 89 brain slices of the Sprague-Dawley rats. The units could be divided into three types: regular (61.8%), irregular (24.2%) and silent (14%). Acetylcholine (ACh, 0.1, 0.3 mumol/L) showed four kinds of effects on spontaneous discharges of RVLM neurons: excitatory, inhibitory, biphasic and non-responsive, counting respectively 41.8%, 20%, 3% and 35.2% of the neurons tested. The excitatory effect of ACh was dose-dependent. The effects, either excitatory or inhibitory, of ACh (n = 49) were mostly blocked by atropine (0.3 mumol/L, n = 42). The excitatory effect of ACh (n = 14) could be blocked mainly by selective antagonist of M1 receptor, pirenzepine (PZ, 30 nmol/L, n = 9), but not by selective antagonist of M2 receptor, methoctramine (MT) and AFDX-116. The inhibitory effect of ACh (n = 10) could be blocked mostly by M2 receptor antagonist MT (30 nmol/L, n = 7); and this inhibitory effect (n = 9) could be blocked mostly by another M2 receptor antagonist AFDX-116 (30 nmol/L, n = 6), but not by M1 receptor antagonist PZ.", 
    "36": "Participants discriminated between tripelennamine and placebo in experiments differing in instructional set. In 1 experiment (SED), participants were told that 1 of the 2 drugs was more sedative-like, and during the other (STIM), 1 was more stimulant-like. During generalization tests, participants received diazepam or d-amphetamine. Percent correct was the same in both experiments. Tripelennamine increased sedative and decreased stimulant effects. Amphetamine and diazepam produced typical subjective effects. Some subjective effects differed across experiments with more sedative and less stimulant effects during SED than STIM. In SED and STIM, capsules were labeled 80% of the time as a sedative and stimulant, respectively. Thus, instructions designed to give expectations had no effect on discrimination and only a few changes in subjective effects. When asked to name the drug that they believed they received, labels reflected instructional set.", 
    "37": "In Experiment 1, the effect of repeated injections of 2.5, 5.0, or 10.0 mg/kg of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) on food intake and body weight was studied in rats on an activity anorexia (AA) regimen. For several days before CDP testing began, rats lived in activity wheels and had one 60-min meal per day. During CDP testing, this regimen continued except that each rat was injected with an appropriate dose of CDP or saline 30 min before each meal. CDP enhanced food intake; 5.0 mg/kg seemed most effective. However, the CDP-induced increase in eating did not noticeably stem weight loss. In Experiment 2, after several days of AA training, CDP (5.0 mg/kg) was tested under less severe conditions; food remained restricted, but access to the wheels was discontinued. Rats given CDP ate more and gained more weight than controls. These findings suggest that benzodiazepines such as CDP may help in treating anorexia nervosa and other anorectic conditions in humans.", 
    "38": "The pharmacological effects were assessed for a series of 3alpha-diphenylmethoxy-1alphaH,5alphaH-tropane analogs which have structural similarities to cocaine. Like cocaine, these compounds displaced [3H]WIN 35,428 binding from rat caudate and had affinities ranging from approximately 10-fold greater than cocaine (Ki=11.8 nM) to relatively low affinity (Ki=2000 nM). The compounds also inhibited dopamine uptake with potencies corresponding to their affinities for WIN 35,428 binding sites. Like the parent compound, benztropine, the 3alpha-(diphenylmethoxy)tropane analogs displaced [3H]pirenzepine from muscarinic M1 receptors with affinities ranging from 2 to 120 nM. Cocaine produced dose-related increases in locomotor activity (horizontal ambulation) in Swiss Webster mice, whereas the 3alpha-(diphenylmethoxy)tropane analogs generally had lower efficacy than cocaine. Compounds with fluoro-substituents in the phenyl rings generally were among those with efficacy approaching that of cocaine; those with chloro- and bromo-substituents were markedly less efficacious, despite having binding affinities comparable to those of the corresponding fluoro-substituted compounds. The 3alpha-(diphenylmethoxy)tropane analogs were also examined in rats trained to discriminate saline from cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.). Cocaine produced a dose-related increase in responding on the cocaine-appropriate lever, reaching 100% at 10 mg/kg. Only the 4',4\"-difluoro-substituted analog produced effects similar to those of cocaine; the other compounds showed markedly reduced efficacy compared to cocaine. Drug interaction studies showed that the antimuscarinics, atropine and scopolamine, potentiated rather than attenuated the locomotor stimulant and cocaine-like discriminative-stimulus effects of cocaine, indicating that the antimuscarinic effects of the 3alpha-diphenylmethoxytropane analogs did not contribute to their diminished cocaine-like activity. Studies of the time course of selected compounds indicated that their reduced cocaine-like efficacy was likely not due to behavioral observations being conducted at an inopportune time period. Because none of the 3alpha-diphenylmethoxytropane analogs studied showed evidence that they were binding to more than one site, and because the structure activity relationships among these drugs are distinctly different from those obtained with cocaine, these data suggest that the 3alpha-diphenylmethoxytropane analogs are accessing a different binding domain than that accessed by cocaine. Binding to this domain may produce a behavioral profile that is distinct from that of the cocaine-like dopamine uptake inhibitors.", 
    "39": "Cross-linking the high affinity IgE receptor Fc epsilonRI of basophils and mast cells activates receptor-associated protein-tyrosine kinases and stimulates a signaling cascade leading to secretion, ruffling, spreading, and cytokine production. Previous evidence that the pan-prenylation inhibitor lovastatin blocks Ag-stimulated Ca2+ influx, secretion, and membrane/cytoskeletal responses implicated isoprenylated proteins in the Fc epsilonRI-coupled signaling cascade but could not distinguish between contributions of C15 (farnesylated) and C20 (geranylgeranylated) species. Here we establish concentrations of lovastatin and the farnesyl-specific inhibitor BZA-5B that inhibit the farnesylation and Ag-induced activation of Ras species in RBL-2H3 cells (H-Ras, K-RasA, and K-RasB). These inhibitors have little effect on tyrosine kinase activation, which initiates Fc epsilonRI signaling. Although Ras is disabled, only lovastatin substantially blocks Raf-1 activation, and neither inhibitor affects mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase kinase (MEK) or ERK1/ERK2 activation. Thus, the pathway to Fc epsilonRI-mediated MEK/ERK and ERK activation can apparently bypass Ras and Raf-1. Predictably, only lovastatin inhibits Ag-induced ruffling, spreading, and secretion, previously linked to geranylgeranylated Rho and Rab family members. Additionally, only lovastatin inhibits phospholipase Cgamma-mediated inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate production, sustained Ca2+ influx, and Ca2+-dependent IL-4 production, suggesting novel roles for geranylgeranylated (lovastatin-sensitive, BZA-5B-insensitive) proteins in Fc epsilonRI signal propagation. Remarkably, BZA-5B concentrations too low to inactivate Ras reduce the lag time to Ag-induced Ca2+ stores release and enhance secretion. These results link a non-Ras farnesylated protein(s) to the negative regulation of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and secretion. We identified no clear role for Ras in Fc epsilonRI-coupled signaling but suggest its involvement in mast cell growth regulation based on the inhibition of cell proliferation by both BZA-5B and lovastatin.", 
    "40": "In our experience, many of our schizophrenic patients treated with clozapine request the newer atypical antipsychotic agents in order to eliminate the weekly blood monitoring. However, there are few guidelines available to clinicians interested in switching patients successfully treated with clozapine to olanzapine.", 
    "41": "The goal of this study was to collect preliminary data on the safety, clinical effectiveness, and predictors of response of switching clozapine patients to olanzapine. In an open trial, 19 patients receiving clozapine were switched to olanzapine.", 
    "42": "Eight (42%) of 19 patients were considered responders. Seven patients decompensated seriously enough to require hospitalization. All 7 of these patients were restabilized on clozapine treatment in the hospital, and olanzapine was discontinued. In an additional 4 patients, clinical status worsened, and clozapine doses were titrated upwards and olanzapine was slowly discontinued. Overall, mean total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores increased significantly from baseline to final assessment (p = .02). Responders had been treated for a significantly shorter period of time with clozapine prior to the switch compared to nonresponders (p = .04) and were receiving a lower dose of clozapine (p = .05). The final olanzapine dose did not differ between responders and nonresponders. All responders have remained on olanzapine treatment and are stable.", 
    "43": "In this open trial, the crossover from clozapine to olanzapine was generally well tolerated and resulted in a successful transition for 8 of the 19 patients. However, mean scores on the total BPRS and negative symptom and depressive symptom subscales significantly increased. Caution must be taken in determining which patients may benefit from the switch to olanzapine because of the risk of decompensation and hospitalization. Because this was an open trial, these findings require replication in a controlled trial.",

    "50": "The tranquilizer and anti-convulsant diazepam (DZ) is a suspected aneugen. In order to assess its aneugenic potential in mammalian oogenesis we exposed in vitro maturing mouse oocytes to the drug. Spindle formation and cell cycle progression, the behaviour of chromosomes and the distribution of mitochondria were characterized with respect to induction of numerical chromosomal aberrations. A concentration of 25 microg/ml DZ induced a pronounced delay in maturation and blocked a high percentage of oocytes in meiosis I. This arrest was partly reversible. Hyperploidy was slightly increased in oocytes matured in the presence of 5 microg/ml DZ and became significantly elevated in oocytes matured with 25 microg/ml DZ, relative to controls. Concomitantly, DZ induced spindle aberrations and displacement of chromosomes from the equator, but unlike in mitosis and in male meiosis most oocytes still possessed bipolar spindles. A significant fraction of meiotically delayed, metaphase I-blocked oocytes exposed to 25 microg/ml DZ contained univalents. Some DZ-treated oocytes progressing to meiosis II exhibited one or multiple single chromatids. Precocious chiasma resolution and equational segregation of chromatids from functional univalents in first anaphase (predivision) may be responsible for this condition, a mechanism also discussed in the aetiology of maternal age-related aneuploidy. DZ disturbed the spatio-temporal distribution of mitochondria during oocyte maturation, possibly by binding to peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors on mitochondria, thus affecting the availability of ATP and calcium homeostasis. Blocks in maturation may also relate to binding of DZ to calmodulin. Data suggest that DZ exposes mammalian oocytes to predivision and aneuploidy. Thresholds, long lasting effects of DZ in vivo and sex-specific sensitivities in chemically induced aneuploidy of mammalian germ cells are critically evaluated.", 
    "51": "The discriminative stimulus effects of the imidazopyridine hypnotic zolpidem and the classic benzodiazepine hypnotic triazolam were examined in seven healthy volunteers using a three-response drug discrimination procedure and a within-subject design. During an initial sampling phase, the training drug conditions (placebo, 20 mg/70 kg zolpidem, and 0.5 mg/70 kg triazolam) were identified to subjects by letter codes before oral drug administration. During a subsequent training phase, subjects earned money for correct drug identifications made 3.75 h after drug administration. Five out of seven subjects acquired the three-response discrimination. Analyses of standardized and unstructured self-report questionnaires revealed that zolpidem and triazolam produced different profiles of effects; zolpidem was associated with a number of negative somatic symptoms including nausea, blurred vision, visual images/hallucinations, and heavy limbs, whereas triazolam was associated with greater sedative effects. These results demonstrate a distinct profile of discriminative stimulus and subjective effects for zolpidem, relative to triazolam, which is consistent with its somewhat distinct pharmacological profile, and provide evidence for the sensitivity of the three-response drug discrimination procedure for detecting between-drug differences.",

Drug interactions occurred as a result of a combination of tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors or monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

    "53": "The case is presented of a 34-year-old woman with rhabdomyolysis due to massive intake of nimetazepam, a benzodiazepine hypnotic. On admission, the patient had numerous blisters all over the body. One of the blisters in the gluteal region developed into a deep ulcer accompanied by muscle necrosis although it was not at a pressure point. The ulcer needed surgical intervention. Rhabdomyolysis is caused by the lysis and necrosis of muscle due to direct or indirect injury, high fever, ischaemia, hypoxia or enzyme defects. Release of myocyte components into the circulation then may induce major problems, especially acute renal failure associated with hypermyoglobinaemia. However, there have been few reports of cutaneous ulcer formation in non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis.", 
    "54": "Schizophrenia is a chronic and debilitating disorder whose effective pharmacological management is often less than optimal. For several decades, pharmaceutical treatment for this disorder consisted of conventional neuroleptics such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine. However, the limitations of these drugs have driven the development of newer antipsychotics that are designed to be more efficacious and more tolerable than conventional agents. Newer agents available for consideration as first-line treatment options now include risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and, more recently, quetiapine. Proper dosing has emerged as a vital factor in the effective use of these newer drugs. This report examines data derived from clinical trials and market research with risperidone and olanzapine to help clinicians determine the appropriate dose for efficacy and to appraise the adverse events associated with that efficacious dose. Current information suggests that, for most patients with schizophrenia, the optimal dose with respect to efficacy and tolerability of risperidone is < or = 6 mg/day. The optimal dose of olanzapine is less clear and may be 15 mg/day or higher. With the advent of these newer antipsychotics, clinicians now have more treatment options for the management of patients with psychotic disorders. Knowledge gained through clinical experience is needed to augment clinical trial results and to help define the most effective use of each of these agents.", 
    "55": "Olanzapine is a novel antipsychotic, which is effective against both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and causes fewer extrapyramidal adverse effects than conventional antipsychotics. The purpose of the present study was to assess the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction between olanzapine and carbamazepine, since these agents are likely to be used concomitantly in the treatment of manic psychotic disorder.", 
    "56": "The pharmacokinetics of two single therapeutic doses of olanzapine were determined in 11 healthy volunteers. The first dose of olanzapine (10 mg) was taken alone and the second dose (10 mg) after 2 weeks of treatment with carbamazepine (200 mg BID). Measurement of urinary 6beta-hydroxycortisol/cortisol excretion was used as an endogenous marker to confirm that induction of CYP3A4 by carbamazepine had occurred.", 
    "57": "The dose of olanzapine given after a 2-week pretreatment with carbamazepine was cleared more rapidly than olanzapine given alone. Olanzapine pharmacokinetic values for Cmax and AUC were significantly lower after the second dose, the elimination half-life was significantly shorter, and the clearance and volume of distribution were significantly increased.", 
    "58": "Carbamazepine has been shown to induce several P450 cytochromes including CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. Since CYP1A2 plays a role in the metabolic clearance of olanzapine, the interaction may be attributed to induction of CYP1A2 by carbamazepine, leading to increased first-pass and systemic metabolism of olanzapine. The interaction is not considered to be of clinical significance because olanzapine has a wide therapeutic index, and the changes in plasma concentration of olanzapine are within the fourfold variation that occurs without concern for safety in a patient population.", 
    "59": "Flunitrazepam was administered to volunteers in three different oral doses. The effects on psychomotor sedation, attention, working memory and explicit memory were then assessed at various intervals after dosing and compared with levels of the drug in the plasma. Three groups of 12 healthy males with similar levels of education were given placebo or flunitrazepam (1, 2 or 4 mg) in a double-blind, random-sequence study. Volunteers completed a battery of tests at night, 3.5 h after taking the drug and in the morning, 10 h afterward. Blood samples were collected for drug analysis before and after the nocturnal tests and before morning tests. At night, only the highest dose of flunitrazepam (4 mg) induced significant changes in psychomotor sedation, attention, working memory, and prose immediate recall. Doses of 2 and 4 mg flunitrazepam significantly reduced the mean scores of explicit memory (morning tests). Z-scores, calculated from differences between flunitrazepam and placebo, revealed that 2 mg flunitrazepam impaired memory but not alertness or attention. Linear regression analysis of the relationship between plasma levels of flunitrazepam and its effects (Z-scores) indicated that there was a significant positive correlation between peak levels of flunitrazepam at night and impairment of night attention and explicit memory, i.e. delayed recall of prose (r = 0.59, P < 0.01) and trigrams (r = 0.55, P < 0.01). However, memory and attention Z-scores as a function of plasma levels fitted with nonlinear regression analysis to the Emax model had higher correlation coefficients. To produce an effect equal to 50% of the maximum effect for memory impairment, concentrations (EC50) were 6.1 and 6.4 ng/ml for prose and trigrams delayed recall; but for attention they were much higher, at 13.2 ng/ml. The overall results indicate that higher concentrations were needed to impair attention than were required to impair memory.", 
    "60": "Psychopharmacological treatment of all demented patients (n = 49), discharged to nursing homes after gerontopsychiatric hospital treatment in 1992 and 1993, was analyzed. In spite of the higher risk of secondary effects in elderly, demented people are after prescriptions for psychopharmacologic medications, especially neuroleptics. It was shown that the residents in nursing homes receive significantly more neuroleptics than patients who are discharged (P = 0.0001). Prescriptions for benzodiazepines were two times higher, whereas clomethiazole was rarely given. In nursing homes these substances were prescribed as continuous treatment. Most prescriptions resulted from agitation, sleep disturbances or aggressive behavior. Astonishingly, the patients without positive effects from treatment, who worsened regarding behavioral complications of dementia, obtained the highest doses of neuroleptics.", 
    "61": "What roles do mesolimbic and neostriatal dopamine systems play in reward? Do they mediate the hedonic impact of rewarding stimuli? Do they mediate hedonic reward learning and associative prediction? Our review of the literature, together with results of a new study of residual reward capacity after dopamine depletion, indicates the answer to both questions is 'no'. Rather, dopamine systems may mediate the incentive salience of rewards, modulating their motivational value in a manner separable from hedonia and reward learning. In a study of the consequences of dopamine loss, rats were depleted of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and neostriatum by up to 99% using 6-hydroxydopamine. In a series of experiments, we applied the 'taste reactivity' measure of affective reactions (gapes, etc.) to assess the capacity of dopamine-depleted rats for: 1) normal affect (hedonic and aversive reactions), 2) modulation of hedonic affect by associative learning (taste aversion conditioning), and 3) hedonic enhancement of affect by non-dopaminergic pharmacological manipulation of palatability (benzodiazepine administration). We found normal hedonic reaction patterns to sucrose vs. quinine, normal learning of new hedonic stimulus values (a change in palatability based on predictive relations), and normal pharmacological hedonic enhancement of palatability. We discuss these results in the context of hypotheses and data concerning the role of dopamine in reward. We review neurochemical, electrophysiological, and other behavioral evidence. We conclude that dopamine systems are not needed either to mediate the hedonic pleasure of reinforcers or to mediate predictive associations involved in hedonic reward learning. We conclude instead that dopamine may be more important to incentive salience attributions to the neural representations of reward-related stimuli. Incentive salience, we suggest, is a distinct component of motivation and reward. In other words, dopamine systems are necessary for 'wanting' incentives, but not for 'liking' them or for learning new 'likes' and 'dislikes'.", 
    "62": "Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in combination with a linear response approach were used to estimate the free energies of binding for a series of 12 TIBO nonnucleoside inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Separate correlations were made for the R6 and S6 absolute conformations of the inhibitors, as well as for the analogous N6-monoprotonated species. Models based upon the neutral unbound inhibitors produced overall better fits to experimental values than did those using the protonated unbound inhibitors, with only slight differences between the neutral R6 and S6 cases. The best results were obtained with a three-parameter linear response equation containing van der Waals (alpha), electrostatic (beta), and solvent accessible surface area (SASA, gamma) terms. The averaged (R6 and S6) rms error was approximately 0.88 kcal/mol for the observed range of 4.06 kcal/mol in inhibitor activities. The averaged values of alpha, beta, and gamma were -0.150, 0.114, and 0. 0286, respectively. Omission of the alpha term gave beta 0.152 and gamma 0.022 with a rms of 0.92. The unweighted van der Waals components were found to be highly attractive but failed to correlate well across the series of inhibitors. Contrastingly, while the electrostatic components are all repulsive, they show a direct correlation with inhibitor activity as measured by DeltaGbinding. The role of gamma is primarily to produce an overall negative binding energy, and it can effectively be replaced with a negative constant. During the MC simulations of the unbound solvated inhibitors, the R6 and S6 absolute conformations do not interconvert due to the formation of a favorable hydrogen bond to solvent. In the complex, however, interconversion of these conformations of the inhibitor is observed during the course of the simulations, a phenomenon which is apparently not observed in the crystalline state of the complex. Hydrogen bonding of the inhibitor to the backbone NH of K101 and the lack of such an interaction with the C=O of K101 or with solvent correlate with enhanced activity, as does the ability to assume a number of different orientations of the inhibitor dimethylallyl moiety with respect to residues Y181 and Y188 while retaining contact with W229. Overall, the use of a combination of MC simulation with a linear response method shows promise as a relatively rapid means of estimating inhibitor activities. This approach should be useful in the preliminary evaluation of potential modifications to known inhibitors to enhance activity.", 
    "63": "Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. A deficiency of GABAergic inhibition mediated via the GABAA receptor complex has for a long time been suspected to be a central factor in epileptogenesis. Status epilepticus is a condition of sustained and prolonged excitation of neuronal circuits, as detected by epileptiform discharges in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Reduction of GABAA receptor-mediated hippocampal inhibition has been implicated in the development of status epilepticus. The present study provides direct evidence of a link between the GABAA receptor and epilepsy. We show that selective inhibition of the expression of the GABAA receptor gamma2 subunit in the rat hippocampus by means of antisense oligonucleotides leads to spontaneous electrographic seizures that evolve into profound limbic status epilepticus, ultimately resulting in severe neurodegenerative changes. Concurrent treatment with diazepam prevents the development of status epilepticus and markedly reduces neuronal cell loss. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that the GABAA receptor is critically involved in the pathogenesis of seizures and status epilepticus.",

In other experiments, the concentration of GABA was increased and flurazepam was substituted for midazolam.", 
    "66": "Isobolographic analysis confirmed that midazolam and propofol interact synergistically to enhance currents evoked by low concentrations of GABA (1 microM). However, when the concentration of GABA was increased to 3 microM, the interaction was additive. The interaction between flurazepam and propofol was also additive for enhancement of currents evoked by 3 microM GABA.", 
    "67": "The interaction between midazolam and propofol was critically dependent on the concentration of GABA: Synergism was evident at low concentrations of GABA, but an additive interaction was apparent when the concentration of GABA was increased. Changes in GABA(A) receptor function may underlie the synergistic interaction between propofol and midazolam for clinical effects such as hypnosis. The clinical implication of the results is that the benefits of synergism observed at one concentration ratio of these drugs may not be apparent at another.",

Despite advanced skeletization and complete transformation of the still existing residual soft tissues to adipocere, highly toxic concentrations of two heavy metals (cadmium: 0.30 mg/kg; thallium: 0.91 mg/kg) and minor levels of three organic substances (phenobarbitone: 0.32 mg/kg; nordazepam: 0.14 mg/kg; salicylic acid: 0.04 mg/kg) were detected in adipoceratous samples. Even if it is not possible to derive similar blood levels from post-mortem values, the cause and manner of death (suicidal intoxication) could be clarified with the necessary degree of certainty. Few comparable literature reports either deal with exhumations or non-toxic concentrations of substances in morphologically better preserved adipoceratous bodies. Our case demonstrates that toxicological analyses may contribute to the clarification of the cause of death even if advanced adipocere formation with a longer post-mortem interval is present.",

Mutant receptors bound the benzodiazepine binding site ligand [3H]flumazenil with similar, subnanomolar affinity as wild-type receptor. Displacement studies with diazepam showed that the affinity for this compound was reduced 250-fold on mutation, indicating that the tyrosine hydroxyl group interferes with diazepam binding. This differential behavior then was used to find the chemical entity presumably interacting with the phenyalanine residue in position 77 of the gamma2 subunit of wild-type receptors. Thirty-four substances were analyzed in this respect. Our results suggest that the phenyl substituent of diazepam is located close to gammaF77. Similarly, we investigated the possible location of alpha1T206 and gamma2M130.

The affinity of a mutant TRH-R, in which Trp279 was substituted by alanine (W279A TRH-R), for most tested agonists was higher than that of wild-type (WT) TRH-R, whereas its affinity for inverse agonists was diminished, suggesting that W279A TRH-R is constitutively active. We found that W279A TRH-R exhibited 3.9-fold more signaling activity than WT TRH-R in the absence of agonist. This increased basal activity was inhibited by the inverse agonist midazolam, confirming that the mutant receptor is constitutively active. Computer-simulated models of the unoccupied WT TRH-R, the TRH-occupied WT TRH-R, and various TRH-R mutants predict that a hydrophobic cluster of residues, including Trp279 (TM6), Tyr282, and Phe199 (TM5), constrains the receptor in an inactive conformation. In support of this model, we found that substitution of Phe199 by alanine or of Tyr282 by alanine or phenylalanine, but not of Tyr200 (by alanine or phenylalanine), resulted in a constitutively active receptor. We propose that a hydrophobic cluster including residues in TM5 and TM6 constrains the TRH-R in an inactive conformation via interhelical interactions. Disruption of these constraints by TRH binding or by mutation leads to changes in the relative positions of TM5 and TM6 and to the formation of an active form of TRH-R.", 
    "79": "Piper methysticum (kava kava) is a plant native to the Pacific Island region, and has been used ceremonial for thousands of years. The active ingredients are a group of substances know as kava lactones (AKA kava pyrones). Four lactones in kava have been found to have significant analgesic and anesthetic effects via non-opiate pathways. Kava's most popular application is as a natural anxiolytic, comparing favorably in several studies to a number prescription medications, including benzodiazepines. CNS effects seem to be mediated by several mechanisms. Studies have been conflicting regarding its GABA-receptor-binding capacity, although this has been found to occur in some studies. In vitro kava has been found to block norepinephrine uptake. It also has some anti-convulsant capabilities, which appear to be mediated by Na+ channel receptor sites. The therapeutic dosage is in the range of 50-70 mg kava lactones three times daily. The most common side effect, usually seen only with long-term, heavy usage of the herb, is a scaly skin rash called \"kava dermopathy.\" It has also been know to potentiate other medications such as barbiturates and Xanax.", 
    "80": "The effectiveness of predator odours as repellents was assessed, and the behavioral antipredatory responses were characterized. Mice had free access to an unfamiliar runway containing different olfactory stimuli: modelling clay, or feces of a cat subjected either to a vegetarian or a carnivorous diet. The first experiment revealed various indices of a spontaneous behavioral pattern that included exploratory activity, different kinds of emotionality, and a range of active or passive defensive reactions until the appearance of absence of risk assessment strictly related to presence or absence of anxiety. These reactions differ with larger responses to feces resulting from a carnivorous as opposed to vegetarian diets. In the second experiment, chlordiazepoxide (0, 2.5, 5, or 7.5 mg/kg) had a dose-related anxiolytic effect on exploration in mice of both vegetarian and carnivorous groups but could not totally reverse the strong anxiogenic effect of carnivorous stimulus on defensive mechanisms. These differences are related to the nature of the mammalian cues. This paradigm may be a fear-motivated model of animal anxiety.", 
    "81": "Recombinant gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor channels containing alpha1beta2gamma2-subunits were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. Modulation by diazepam (DZ) was investigated using the patch-clamp technique with a device for ultra-fast solution exchange. GABA activated Cl(-)-currents were potentiated when DZ > 0.1 microM was added to non-saturating concentrations of GABA (< 0.1 mM GABA). Maximal potentiation of the peak current amplitude by a factor of 2.5 was observed when 1 microM DZ was added to the test-solution. Deactivation of GABA-activated currents after the end of GABA pulses was best fitted with two time constants. After application of DZ + GABA, increase of time constants of deactivation was measured. It was independent on GABA concentration. We conclude that prolongation of deactivation after application of GABA + DZ may be an important mechanism of the modulatory action of DZ at GABA(A) receptor channels.",

Olanzapine did not affect theophylline pharmacokinetics. However, cimetidine significantly decreased theophylline clearance and the corresponding formation of its metabolites. Urinary excretion of theophylline and its metabolites was unaffected by olanzapine but was reduced significantly by cimetidine. Steady-state concentrations of olanzapine (15.3 ng/ml), 10-N-glucuronide (4.9 ng/ml), and 4'-N-desmethyl olanzapine (2.5 ng/ml) were observed after olanzapine 10 mg once/day and were unaffected by coadministration of theophylline.",

Domoate and kainate stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake and decreased MTT reduction, in a LY 303070-sensitive manner. AMPA caused a small increase on 45Ca2+ uptake, but it was without effect on MTT reduction. AMPA reduced both the 45Ca2+ entry and neurotoxicity induced by kainate, and cyclothiazide enhanced both the 45Ca2+ entry and neurotoxicity induced by AMPA. The results indicate that the AMPA receptors are the non-NMDA glutamate receptors involved in excitotoxicity.", 
    "90": "Waking EEG was recorded from left and right parietals in 60 adult Wistar rats gonadectomized after puberty during 5 days, 1 as baseline, 1 with vehicle and 1 with 10 mg/kg i.m. of diazepam with hormonal treatment (either testosterone propionate, 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone or vehicle in males and progesterone, estradiol benzoate or vehicle in females). Quantitative EEG analysis showed that: diazepam in gonadectomized males increased absolute power of alpha, beta 1 and beta 2, increased interparietal correlation of delta and decreased interparietal correlation of slow theta, fast theta and beta 1, whereas in gonadectomized females, diazepam additionally decreased slow and fast theta absolute power. EEG effects were not modified by testosterone propionate or 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone treatment in males. Diazepam plus estradiol rendered the female EEG response similar to the gonadectomized or testosterone-treated males response; diazepam plus progesterone induced the same response in females as in gonadectomized females and additionally induced interparietal asymmetry and decreased interparietal correlation of all EEG bands. Present results and information on the effects of diazepam on interparietal coupling of EEG and demonstrate that the EEG response to diazepam in adult rats is sexually dimorphic and depends on sex as well as on activational effects of gonadal steroids.", 
    "91": "During a 3-month period, determinants of psychotropic drug utilization (sex, age, length of stay, reason for admission, disease severity) and data on psychotropic consumption (type of medication--antidepressants, benzodiazepines and antipsychotics--dosage and length of treatment) were retrospectively collected in a general intensive care unit of a Dutch university hospital. Daily exposure to psychotropics was standardized in number of Defined Daily Doses (DDD). Benzodiazepines were used by 35.8% of all patients (137) during their stay in the ICU whereas 17.5% of all patients used a neuroleptic agent. Antidepressants were hardly prescribed. High doses of benzodiazepines (9.9 DDDs) and low doses of antipsychotics (0.5 DDDs) were prescribed, which probably reflect the unusual nature of this critically ill group of patients compared with the reference group for DDD's. Clear patterns of determinants of psychotropic drug use in ICU patients were found and both benzodiazepines, antipsychotics and combined use of these agents could be associated with the determinants assessed. The time patterns we found in terms of length of stay give clues for further investigations in order to rationalize psychotropic drug use in the management of severely ill and complex patients.", 
    "92": "In healthy volunteers a single dose (0.05 g) of hydazepam does not change, but in subjects with psychogenic stress-reactions one-week course of the drug (0.05 g/24 h) intensifies to optimum activation of the sympathoadrenal system in response to standard operator load, inducing prevalent excretion of norepinephrine but not of epinephrine in the urine and maintains a high level of dopamine and DOPA excretion. In operators working in a state of hypercapnia and hyperthermia a single dose of hydazepam (0.05 g) blocks stress activation of the sympathoadrenal system. In a state of hyperthermia hydazepam normalizes the blood histamine and serotonin content. In all cases hydazepam improves the condition of the operators and the quality of their work, which allows it to be considered an effective and safe agent for the correction of stress-induced disorders in operators.", 
    "93": "Conscious sensory perception and its modulation by volition are integral to human mental life. Functional neuroimaging techniques provide a direct means of identifying and characterizing in vivo the systems-level patterns of brain activity associated with such mental functions. In a series of positron emission tomography activation experiments, we and our colleagues have examined a range of normal and abnormal auditory states that, when contrasted, provide dissociations relevant to the question of the neural substrates of sensory awareness. These dissociations include sensory awareness in the presence and absence of external sensory stimuli, the transition from sensory unawareness to awareness (or vice versa) in the presence of sensory stimuli, and sensory awareness with and without volition. The auditory states studied include hallucinations, mental imagery, cortical deafness modulated by attention, and hearing modulated by sedation. The results of these studies highlight the distributed nature of the functional neuroanatomy that is sufficient, if not necessary, for sensory awareness. The probable roles of unimodal association (as compared with primary) cortices, heteromodal cortices, limbic/paralimbic regions and subcortical structures (such as the thalamus) are discussed. In addition, interactions between pre- and post-rolandic regions are examined in the context of top-down, volitional modulation of sensory awareness.",

An aliquot from each urine collection was screened using cloned enzyme donor immunoassay (CEDIA), enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT) II, EMIT dau, and fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) without and with hydrolysis using beta-glucuronidase. Using a 200 ng/mL calibrator cut-off, none of the four immunoassays gave a positive response before hydrolyzation of the urine samples. For offline hydrolysis using Helix pomatia beta-glucuronidase, 35, 3, 0, and 4 of 48 urine samples gave positive responses on the previously listed immunoassays. The CEDIA method also gave 32 of 48 positive responses for online hydrolysis using Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase.

A total of 68 urine specimens that were presumptively positive for benzodiazepines were evaluated by the REMEDi HS urine benzodiazepine assay (BIO-RAD, Munich, Germany). Of this number, 53 (78%) specimens were found by REMEDi to contain one or more benzodiazepines or their metabolites, and 15 (22%) were found to be negative. From the discordant group of 15 samples, eight were found to be negative using conventional chromatographic procedures (HPLC or GC/MS), while seven contained one or more benzodiazepines or metabolites, each of which were below the individual cut-off level specified by the manufacturer. Additionally 30 urine specimens that were negative for benzodiazepines using immunoassay were also tested by REMEDi. Two samples were found to be positive. These results could not be confirmed by other chromatographic techniques. The REMEDi HS benzodiazepine assay can be a very useful complementary technique in the clinical/forensic toxicology laboratory, especially for the identification of the parent benzodiazepines administered. The assay provides a rapid result in emergency situations and is useful in confirmation of preliminary positive immunoassay results.", 
    "96": "\"I fear a trip to the dentist more than I fear death\" is the response one person gave in a national survey recently cited in USA Today. While clearly representing an extreme, the results of many surveys suggest that fear of dentistry is still prevalent and is a measure of the failure of current therapeutic approaches to reduce pain and anxiety sufficiently to enable people, especially those with special needs, to visit the dentist. Patients who are fearful would likely seek oral health care more regularly if anesthesia and sedation were more readily available. Taking into consideration that the safety of anxiolytic drugs is highly dependent on the drug, dose, and route of administration used, oral premedication should be the sedative technique used by most dentists because it is efficacious, requires little monitoring when appropriate doses are used, and is unlikely to result in serious morbidity.",

    "98": "The cardiovascular effects of three different acetylcholinesterase inhibitors: physostigmine, tacrine and rivastigmine injected by intravenous (i.v.) route were compared in freely moving Wistar rats. The three drugs significantly increased both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and decreased heart rate. Compared to physostigmine, a 20-fold higher dose of tacrine and a 40-fold higher dose of rivastigmine was necessary to induce a comparable pressor effect. Tacrine was chosen as a model to study the mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular effects of i.v. cholinesterase inhibitors. Atropine totally abolished while methylatropine did not affect tacrine pressor effects. Conversely, both drugs abolished tacrine-induced bradycardia. The alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin or the vasopressin V1 receptor antagonist, [beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopenta-methylenepropionyl1, O-Me-Tyr2, Arg8] vasopressin partially but significantly reduced tacrine pressor effect and mostly abolished it when administered concomitantly. The tacrine pressor response was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the i.c.v. administration of the non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (ID50 = 1.45 microg), the muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine (ID50 = 4.33 microg), the muscarinic M2 receptor antagonist methoctramine (ID50 = 1.39 microg) and the muscarinic M3 receptor antagonist para-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol (ID50 = 31.19 microg). Central injection of such muscarinic receptor antagonists did not affect tacrine-induced bradycardia. Our results show that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors induce significant cardiovascular effects with a pressor response mediated mainly by the stimulation of central muscarinic M2 receptors inducing a secondary increase in sympathetic outflow and vasopressin release. Conversely, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor-induced bradycardia appears to be mediated by peripheral muscarinic mechanisms.", 
    "99": "In the present study we have compared the effects of the classical antipsychotic drug haloperidol and four different atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone) on extracellular levels of dopamine and noradrenaline in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) of conscious rats. Haloperidol (10, 100 and 800 nmol/kg), clozapine (0.3, 1, 10 and 30 micromol/kg), risperidone (100, 500 and 5000 nmol/kg), olanzapine (10, 100 and 500 nmol/kg) and ziprasidone (10, 100 and 1000 nmol/kg) were administered subcutaneously to rats. All compounds induced increases in dialysate levels of dopamine and noradrenaline in the medial prefrontal cortex. The increases induced by the four antipsychotic agents in extracellular levels of dopamine and noradrenaline displayed a striking co-variation both in dose and time. A similar co-variation was seen in the decrease of dopamine and noradrenaline, after administration of a low dose (30 nmol/kg, s.c.) of the dopamine D2/3 receptor agonist (+)-7-hydroxy-2-(N,N-di-n-propylamino) tetralin ((+)-7-OH-DPAT). It is concluded that there is a close coupling between the release of dopamine and noradrenaline in the medial prefrontal cortex. The mechanism of action of this interaction, that might be of importance for a better understanding of the mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs, is discussed.",

The patient did not take any other drugs and he was not recently on neuroleptic treatment; he recognized the abuse of amineptine, as a stimulant, and the bromazepam abuse, looking for a relief to the excessive anxiety secondary to amineptine. The parkinsonism improved after removing both drugs and taking biperiden and diazepam; lastly the patient was discharged without any medication. The patient did not suffer from other complications associated with amineptine or bromazepam abuse. There are some cases reported of parkinsonism secondary to benzodiazepines but there is none secondary to amineptine. We present a short review of the possible responsible mechanisms, thinking on a complex interaction of both drugs on dopamine and its modulatory systems.",

The trial was conducted on 3 consecutive phases (co-administration of Asp Mg or placebo with BZD during 1 month; gradual taper of BZD during 1 month; follow-up during a third month after complete BZD discontinuation, with urinary BZD control on d75 and d90).",

However, there were some tendencies to positive differences between Asp Mg versus placebo on the following: 1) prolonged delay of BZD use if reintake (30 days vs 20 days, p [log-rank] = 0.5); 2) reduction of withdrawal intensity: 11% of important difficulties during BZD cessation versus 23% with placebo (p = 0.2) and on Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptoms Questionnaire (BWSQ) (final score 4.0 vs 4.8, p = 0.10); 3) lower modification of anxiety during BZD tapering and discontinuation (rate of increase on HAM-A between d30-d90 of 6% vs 23% in placebo group, p = 0.10). Moreover, 3 predictive factors of \"success\" (BZD cessation without withdrawal phenomenon) were identified by uni- and multivariate analysis with logistic regression: chronicity of anxiety disorder (p = 0.04) and amplitude of BWSQ change during tapering phase (p < 0.0001) as negative factors; and initial score of Speilberger Anxiety Inventory \"Anxiety-Trait\" (p = 0.002) as positive factor.

    "105": "Among elderly disruptive behavior agitation and aggressiveness are frequent and often related to dementia. They are known for increasing the risk of patients' institutionalization and causing distress to families and care givers. When a drug prescription is required, physicians have to take into account the high sensitivity of elderly. Tiapride is an atypical neuroleptic which acts preferentially on D2 and D3 dopaminergic receptors. Several papers concerning results of clinical trials conducted in Europe and Japan have been published and reviewed in this article. The interest of tiapride in the treatment of elderly agitation and aggressiveness has been assessed in four double blind clinical trials including more than 700 patients. The efficacy of tiapride (aggressiveness, agitation, delusion and wandering) was demonstrated in a trial versus placebo (p = 0.027) including 324 patients treated for 28 days with 75 to 150 mg/d. Furthermore the superiority of tiapride (175 to 450 mg/d) on chlorpromazine (18 to 112.5 mg/d) was shown in two trials where 262 patients were treated for four weeks, and a recent survey highlighted that tiapride (400 mg/d) is as efficient as melperone (100 mg/d), the only neuroleptic to be indicated in treatment of elderly agitation and aggressiveness in Germany. Besides, 30 open clinical trials including around 1,000 patients have been conducted and have shown homogeneous and positive results. In the two trials versus chlorpromazine, the safety of tiapride was better, with especially less drowsiness, extrapyramidal symptoms, and dry mouth. Compared to lorazepam, in healthy subjects, tiapride caused less memory impairment. European and Japanese open studies confirmed the safety of tiapride in the elderly. In conclusion, tiapride at doses of 100 to 300 mg/d, appeared to be a therapy of elderly agitation and aggressiveness, at less as efficient as the other drugs used in this indication. Furthermore, the safety of tiapride is an advantage compared to benzodiazepines and neuroleptics.",

    "111": "Systematic treatment of hamsters with triazolam (TRZ) or novel wheel (NW) access will yield PRCs similar to those for neuropeptide Y. Both TRZ and NW access require an intact intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) to modulate circadian rhythm phase. It is commonly suggested that both stimulus types influence rhythm phase response via a mechanism associated with drug-induced or wheel access-associated locomotion. Furthermore, there have been suggestions that one or both of these stimulus conditions require an intact serotonergic system for modulation of rhythm phase. The present study investigated these issues by making serotonin neuron-specific neurotoxic lesions of the median or dorsal raphe nuclei and evaluating phase response of the hamster circadian locomotor rhythm to TRZ treatment or NW access. The expected effect of TRZ injected at CT 6 h on the average phase advance was virtually eliminated by destruction of serotonin neurons in the median, but not the dorsal, raphe nucleus. No control or lesioned animal engaged in substantial wheel running in response to TRZ. By contrast, all median raphe-lesioned hamsters that engaged in substantial amounts of running when given access to a NW had phase shifts comparable to control or dorsal raphe-lesioned animals. The results demonstrate that serotonergic neurons in the median raphe nucleus contribute to the regulation of rhythm phase response to TRZ and that it is unlikely that these neurons are necessary for phase response to NW access. The data further suggest the presence of separate pathways mediating phase response to the two stimulus conditions. These pathways converge on the IGL, a nucleus afferent to the circadian clock, that is necessary for the expression of phase response to each stimulus type.", 
    "112": "This study determines the substance use and abuse patterns among patients with comorbid substance-related disorder (SRD) and dysthymia in SRD-dysthymia as compared with patients with SRD only. Differences in use and abuse patterns could be useful for (a) understanding motivations for use, such as self-treatment, and (b) assisting clinicians to identify cases of dysthymia among SRD patients. Retrospective and current data were obtained regarding history of substance use and current SRD diagnoses. Two university medical centers with alcohol-drug programs located within departments of psychiatry were the settings. A total of 642 patients was assessed. of whom 39 had SRD-dysthymia and 308 had SRD only. Data on past usc were collected by a research associate using a questionnaire. Current SRD and dysthymia diagnoses were made by psychiatrists specializing in addiction. The patients with SRD-dysthymia and SRD only did not differ with regard to use of alcohol, tobacco, and benzodiazepines. The patients with SRD-dysthymia started caffeine use at an earlier age, had shorter \"use careers\" of cocaine, amphetamines, and opiates, and had fewer days of cocaine and cannabis use in the last year. They also had a lower rate of cannabis abuse/dependence. This study indicated that patients with dysthymia and SRD have exposure to most substances of abuse that is comparable to patients with SRD only. However, they selectively use certain substances less often than patients with SRD only. Early use of caffeine may reflect self-treatment for depressive symptoms among patients with SRD-dysthymia.", 
    "113": "Elderly patients represent an increasing part of our population who consume disproportionately high amounts of drugs. During aging physiological and disease-induced changes occur which might affect PK and/or PD of many drugs. The calcium channel blocker verapamil and the benzodiazepine midazolam were taken as examples to illustrate some problems and open questions in research pertaining to the elderly. Following an acute i.v. dose of racemic verapamil and during steady-state (120 mg bid p.o.) no significant differences of the stereoselective disposition of S- and R-verapamil could be found between younger and older healthy subjects. Concomitant intake of rifampicin (600 mg/die) induced especially the presystemic (prehepatic) metabolism of verapamil so that oral bioavailability approached zero and PD effects almost diminished. Intestinal metabolism and inducibility were well preserved in the elderly. The PK and PD of midazolam were investigated in young and older patients who received an i.v. bolus of 0.05 and 0.03 mg/kg, respectively, for premedication prior to third molar teeth extraction. Again, no significant differences in the PK parameters were found between both groups. However, the sedative effects were much more pronounced in the elderly and this population demonstrated a significantly higher CNS-sensitivity to midazolam. All physicians should be aware that for various reasons drug response can be age-dependent and therefore more PK-PD data are needed for the elderly.",

GYKI 52466 had no significant effect on desensitization or deactivation time constants but caused a modest and significant prolongation of onset kinetics at higher concentrations. Cyclothiazide (100 microM) potentiated steady-state currents 25-fold at 100 ms and caused a modest but significant slowing in onset kinetics (601 +/- 49 micros with 1 ms applications) but a more pronounced prolongation of deactivation time constants (5.55 +/- 0.66 ms with 1 ms applications). In 50% of neuronal patches cyclothiazide completely eliminated desensitization. In those patches with residual desensitization, the rate was not significantly different to control (5.36 +/- 0.43 ms with 100 ms applications). Following 100 ms applications of glutamate, GYKI 52466 had IC50s of 11.7 +/- 1.1 microM and 75.1 +/- 7.0 microM in the absence and presence of cyclothiazide (100 microM) respectively. Onset kinetics were slowed from 400 +/- 20 micros to 490 +/- 30 micros by cyclothiazide (100 microM) and then further prolonged by GYKI 52466 (100 microM) to a double exponential function (tau(on1) 1.12 +/- 0.13 ms and tau(on2) 171.5 +/- 36.5 ms). GYKI 52466 did not re-introduce desensitization but concentration-dependently weakened cyclothiazide's prolongation of deactivation time constants (1 ms applications: 5.01 +/- 0.71, 4.47 +/- 0.80 and 2.28 +/- 0.64 ms with GYKI 52466 30, 100 and 300 microM respectively). NBQX reduced peak current responses with an IC50 of 28.2 +/- 1.3 nM. Paradoxically, steady-state currents with 500 ms applications of glutamate were potentiated from 3.3 +/- 1.2 pA to 29.4 +/- 6.4 pA by NBQX (1 nM). Higher concentrations of NBQX then antagonized this potentiated response. The potency of NBQX in antagonizing steady-state currents to 500 ms applications of glutamate (IC50 120.9 +/- 30.2 nM) was 2-fold less than following 100 ms applications (IC50 67.7 +/- 2.6 nM). NBQX had no effect on rapid onset, desensitization or deactivation time constants. However, a slow relaxation of inhibition was seen with longer applications. NBQX was 2-5-fold less potent against inward currents in the presence of cyclothiazide (100 microM) depending on the application duration but had no effect on the rapid onset, desensitization or deactivation time constants. The same relaxation of inhibition was seen as with NBQX alone. NBQX (1 microM) reduced AMPA receptor-mediated EPSC amplitude to 7 +/- 1% of control with no effect on kinetics. Cyclothiazide (330 microM) caused a 2.8-fold prolongation of the decay time constant (control 26.6 +/- 2.2 ms, cyclothiazide 74.2 +/- 7.6 ms, n = 9). Additional application of NBQX (1 microM) partly reversed this prolongation to 1.9 fold (47.7 +/- 2.5 ms, n = 5). These results support previous findings that cyclothiazide also allosterically influences AMPA receptor agonist/antagonist recognition sites. There were no interactions between NBQX and cyclothiazide on desensitization or deactivation time constants of glutamate-induced currents but clear interactions on EPSC deactivation kinetics. This raises the possibility that the interactions of NBQX, GYKI 52466 and cyclothiazide on AMPA-receptor-mediated EPSC kinetics observed are due to modulation of glutamate-release at presynaptic AMPA receptors.", 
    "115": "Kainate receptors expressing the GluR5 subunit of glutamate receptor are present at high levels on small diameter primary afferent neurones that are considered to mediate nociceptive inputs. This suggests that GluR5 selective ligands could be novel analgesic agents. The role of kainate receptors on C fibre primary afferents has therefore been probed using three compounds that are selective for homomeric GluR5 receptors. The agonist, ATPA, and the antagonists, LY294486 and LY382884, have been tested in four models of nociception: responses evoked by noxious stimulation of the periphery have been recorded electrophysiologically (1) from hemisected spinal cords from neonatal rats in vitro, (2) from single motor units in adult rats in vivo, (3) from dorsal horn neurones in adult rats in vivo, and (4) in hotplate tests with conscious mice. In some protocols comparisons were made with the AMPA selective antagonist GYKI 53655. The agonist ATPA reduced nociceptive reflexes in vitro, but failed to have effects in vivo. In all tests, the GluR5 antagonists reduced nociceptive responses but only at doses that also affected responses to exogenous AMPA. The AMPA antagonist reduced nociceptive responses at doses causing relatively greater reductions of responses to exogenous AMPA. The results indicate that GluR5 selective ligands do reduce spinal nociceptive responses, but they are not strongly analgesic under these conditions of acute nociception.", 
    "116": "A non-NMDA and non-AMPA receptor mediated excitatory synaptic response was identified in intracellularly recorded basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons in an in vitro slice preparation. Synaptic potentials were evoked by stimulation of either the external capsule (EC) or basal amygdala (BA). NMDA and GABA(A) receptors were blocked by inclusion of 100 microM (+/-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid and 10 microM bicuculline in the perfusion solution. The AMPA receptor-selective allosteric antagonists GYKI 52466 (50 microM) and GYKI 53655 (50 microM) partially suppressed depolarizing synaptic responses evoked by single shock EC stimulation, but fully blocked synaptic responses evoked by BA stimulation. In recordings carried out in the presence of the AMPA receptor antagonists, EC stimulation with pulse trains (5-8 pulses at 50-100 Hz) evoked a large increase in the amplitude of synaptic responses. The AMPA receptor-independent component of the train-induced synaptic response had a null potential near 0 mV. Such AMPA receptor-independent, train-evoked synaptic responses were largely blocked by the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (20 microM; 85 +/- 4%). In addition, the responses were blocked by the GluR5-selective kainate receptor antagonist LY293558 (10 microM; 95 +/- 2%). These results indicate that a component of the EC (but not the BA) synaptic response is mediated by kainate receptors containing the GluR5 subunit.", 
    "117": "Three frequently used and cited formulas used to rate correct the QT interval (Bazett's, Fridericia's, and Van de Water's) were compared and ranked using a large population-based cohort of beagle dogs (99 males and 99 females). In addition, analysis of covariance was used to derive a flexible method to rate correct the QT.interval for heart rate. The method is flexible in that it utilizes pretest or control data to determine the degree of correction. In addition, it can also be used to evaluate whether treatment alters the association between heart rate and QT. Specifically, pretest QT (unadjusted) and heart rate data were used to estimate coefficients in the linear regression log(QT) = alpha + beta log(HR). The estimated slope (beta) from the pretest data was used to heart rate correct the QT interval in the formula log(QT)ca = log(QT) - beta *[log(HR - log(HRm)]. The term \"log(HRm)\" is included to standardize QTca to a reference value, either a fixed value or an average heart rate for the data set being analyzed. These formulas were retrospectively compared under a typical toxicity study paradigm with a class III antiarrhythmic agent (L-768,673) that selectively prolongs the QT interval by blocking the slow activating component of the delayed rectifying potassium channel (lks). Based on their ability to dissociate the effects of heart rate on the QT interval, the formulas received the following ranking: Covariate Adjustment (preferred) = Van De Water's > Fridericia's > Bazett's (not recommended). Analysis of covariance based on pretest or control data is preferred for moderate to large studies where there are adequate data for estimation of the slope parameter beta, the investigator does not have sufficient control over HR, or treatment alters the association between HR and the QT interval. Conversely, for smaller studies a fixed rate adjustment formula from the literature (such as Van de Water's or Fridericia's equations) may be preferable since the bias from using a fixed formula is likely to be smaller than the variance resulting from estimating beta from a small sample.", 
    "118": "Catechol estrogens are major estrogen metabolites in mammals and are the most potent naturally occurring inhibitors of catecholamine metabolism. These estrogen compounds have been implicated in carcinogenic activity and the 4/2-hydroxyestradiol concentration has been shown to be elevated in neoplastic human mammary tissue compared to normal human breast tissue. Three human liver UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, UGT2B7, UGT1A1, and UGT1A3, have been shown to catalyze the glucuronidation of catechol estrogens and lead to their enhanced elimination via urine or bile. The present study was designed to study the kinetic interaction of expressed human UGT2B7(Y) or (H), UGT1A1, and UGT1A3 toward 2- and 4-hydroxycatechol estrogens. cDNAs encoding UGT2B7(Y) or (H), UGT1A1, and UGT1A3 were expressed in HK293 cells, and cell homogenates or membrane preparations were used to determine their glucuronidation ability. UGT2B7(Y) reacted with higher efficiency toward 4-hydroxyestrogenic catechols, whereas UGT1A1 and UGT1A3 showed higher activities toward 2-hydroxyestrogens. UGT2B7(H) catalyzed estrogen catechol glucuronidation with efficiencies similar to UGT2B7(Y). Flunitrazepam (FNZ), a competitive inhibitor of morphine glucuronidation in hepatic microsomes, competitively inhibited catechol estrogen glucuronidation catalyzed by UGT2B7(Y), UGT1A1, and UGT1A3. Buprenorphine, an opioid substrate that reacts at high efficiency with each of these UGTs, was also studied. FNZ competitively inhibited buprenorphine glucuronidation with UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 but had no inhibitory activity toward UGT1A3. This suggests that buprenorphine and 2-hydroxycatechol estrogens react with separate active sites of UGT1A3. A catecholamine, norepinephrine, did not inhibit UGT2B7(Y)-, UGT1A1-, and UGT1A3-catalyzed glucuronidation of catechol estrogens. These results also suggest that drug-endobiotic interactions are possible in humans and may have implication in carcinogenesis.", 
    "119": "The early recognition and management of a first episode of schizophrenic illness is a difficult task, with identification complicated by a broad differential diagnosis, lack of definitive data on the prognostic implications of premorbid/prodromal symptoms, and, until recently, treatment limited to pharmacologic agents with severe adverse effects. The first psychotic episode in patients with schizophrenia is the most responsive to treatment in terms of both rate and degree. However, first-episode patients are also more likely to develop motor side effects, even at lower medication doses, than multiepisode patients. Considerable evidence supports the assertion that early treatment can improve outcome and possibly prevent the development of full-blown illness in high-risk individuals. There is evidence that atypical antipsychotic medications are effective in the treatment of first-episode schizophrenia and are well tolerated. The improved tolerability associated with the newer antipsychotic medications, including a lower risk for motor side effects and possible lower risk for development of tardive dyskinesia, has swung the risk-benefit balance in favor of early and aggressive treatment. By intervening early and providing long-term maintenance treatment, the course of schizophrenic illness may be altered in the coming years with overall decreased deterioration and chronicity and overall improved functioning resulting in lower societal costs.", 
    "120": "Placebo-controlled maintenance studies of conventional antipsychotic agents demonstrate a significant reduction in the risk of schizophrenic relapse in neuroleptic-treated patients. Neuroleptic discontinuation even in patients who remained in remission for as long as 5 years results in a relapse rate comparable to that seen for patients initially assigned to placebo. Yet, patients maintained on conventional neuroleptics are exposed to the risk of tardive dyskinesia (approximately 5% per year for patients with up to 10 years of neuroleptic exposure). Attempts have been made to reduce neuroleptic exposure. A lower maintenance dose was associated with higher relapse rates, as was intermittent, targeted therapy. Psychoeducational treatment studies reaffirmed that the major influence on the rate of rehospitalization was the dose of conventional maintenance medication. Although data are scarce for maintenance treatment with atypical antipsychotic drugs, findings suggest that atypical agents are at least as efficacious and may be better tolerated. Olanzapine has demonstrated efficacy in maintenance treatment as well as a reduced risk of tardive dyskinesia compared with haloperidol.", 
    "121": "When a patient with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia is admitted into the hospital, the target symptoms include pathologic excitement/agitation and exacerbated psychotic symptoms. The goal of hospitalization becomes attenuation of these symptoms to a level compatible with safe discharge. The mainstay of stabilization is antipsychotic treatment. A risk/benefit analysis of the conventional versus the newer antipsychotics favors the use of the newer agents as first-line drugs. These newer antipsychotic agents represent the first significant advance in the pharmacologic treatment of schizophrenia in the past four decades. They are at least as effective as conventional agents and are clearly superior from a safety perspective. Because of short inpatient stays, the challenge for clinicians is to provide an adequate treatment period without aggressively escalating the dose.", 
    "122": "Olanzapine, a new antipsychotic agent, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1996 for use in the treatment of schizophrenia. It is structurally similar to clozapine, has a low incidence of extrapyramidal effects, and is effective in treating both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. This paper describes the determination of olanzapine in biological specimens obtained from the autopsy of a 35-year-old white male found dead in bed at a psychiatric facility. In the months prior to his death, the deceased was prescribed multiple medications, including olanzapine. Olanzapine was identified qualitatively by full scan gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, with quantitative analysis performed by liquid-liquid extraction followed by dual-column gas chromatography. The following concentrations were determined in the specimens analyzed: heart blood, 550 ng/mL; bile, 6346 ng/mL; and gastric contents, 157 ng/mL. Vitreous humor, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine specimens were negative. Although steady-state plasma concentrations of 10-25 ng/mL olanzapine have been reported, effective levels are known to be highly variable and a plasma concentration of 300 ng/mL has been tolerated without adverse effects. Based upon the autopsy, toxicological findings, and case investigation, the cause of death was determined to be intramyocardial arteriosclerosis with severe stenosis of the nodal artery due to hypertensive cardiovascular disease, and the manner was natural.", 
    "123": "A total of 588 blood specimens collected in an emergency unit were screened for benzodiazepines (BZDs) using enzyme-multiplied immunoassay and gas chromatography. Two-hundred eighty-five samples were positive for BZDs, and 303 samples that were negative by EMIT included 20 samples with BZDs detectable by gas-liquid chromatography. A total of 15 BZDs were identified, and the most frequently occurring were nordiazepam, bromazepam, diazepam, and alprazolam. Individual BZDs were found in 74% of cases, but some samples contained two, three, or even four BZDs. There is a risk of missing intoxication by BZDs with low therapeutic range and/or low cross-reactivity (alprazolam, bromazepam, flunitrazepam). There is a risk of misinterpreting a positive result for some BZDs with high therapeutic range and/or high cross-reactivity (nordiazepam), which may reflect a pharmacologically ineffective concentration. A semiquantitative analysis is inappropriate even when the identity of BZD is known. Immunoassays are the only methods presently available for use in emergencies, but physicians must be clearly informed of their limitations and interpret results with caution.", 
    "124": "To mathematically model multiple indicator dilution (MID) data for the purpose of estimating parameters descriptive of indicator-tissue interactions, it is necessary to account for the effects of the distribution of capillary transit times, h(c)(t). In this paper, we present an efficient approach for incorporating h(c)(t) in the mathematical modeling of MID data. In this method, the solution of the model partial differential equations obtained at different locations along the model capillary having the longest transit time provides the outflow concentrations for all capillaries. When weighted by h(c)(t), these capillary outflow concentrations provide the outflow concentration versus time curve for the capillary bed. The method is appropriate whether the available data on capillary dispersion are in terms of capillary transit time or relative flow distributions, and whether the dispersion results from convection time differences among heterogeneous parallel pathways or axial diffusion along individual pathways. Finally, we show that the knowledge of a relationship among the moments of h(c)(t), rather than h(c)(t) per se, is sufficient information to account for the effect of h(c)(t) in the mathematical modeling interpretation of MID data. This relationship can be determined by including a flow-limited indicator in the injected bolus, thus providing an efficient means for obtaining the experimental data sufficient to account for capillary flow and transit time heterogeneity in MID modeling.", 
    "125": "A 43-year-old male psychiatric outpatient died within hours of ingesting as much as 600 mg of olanzapine, a newer antipsychotic agent related to clozapine. Analysis of postmortem blood and urine by gas chromatography with nitrogen-selective detection yielded olanzapine concentrations of 1238 and 6987 micrograms/L, respectively, greatly in excess of levels expected following therapeutic administration of the drug. Based on the toxicology findings, the decedent's known history of suicide attempts, and the circumstances surrounding the death, this case was ruled a suicide by olanzapine overdosage."
