The second-generation antipsychotic olanzapine, an antagonist at serotonergic and noradrenergic receptors, frequently induces weight gain as a side-effect, whereas sibutramine, a noradrenaline/serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is known as a weight-reducing agent. To investigate whether altered motivation for palatable food influences the effect of these drugs on body weight, we determined their effects on responding for sucrose pellets under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement in rats. We found that a low dose of olanzapine selectively increased responding to sucrose, without affecting free-feeding intake of sucrose. In contrast, sibutramine dose-dependently reduced responding to sucrose and similarly reduced free-feeding intake. Furthermore, coadministration of a dose of sibutramine that failed to affect responding to sucrose when administered alone prevented the increase in motivation by the effective dose of olanzapine. These data show that increased motivation for palatable food is likely to be a significant contributor to olanzapine-induced weight gain. Moreover, the ability of sibutramine to reduce this motivation for palatable food may play an important role in the efficacy of sibutramine as an add-on treatment to counteract olanzapine-induced weight gain.", 
    "1": "Status epilepticus and acute prolonged seizures are the most commonly occurring neurological emergencies in children. Such events have high morbidity and mortality rates along with poor long-term outcomes, depending on their duration and causes. Therefore, such seizures warrant urgent treatment using appropriate doses of anticonvulsants. Benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, and phenytoin are the most commonly used anticonvulsants for controlling status epilepticus and acute prolonged seizures. However, these medications have several well-known adverse effects. Previous studies on both adults and children have shown the efficacy and safety of rapid infusion of valproate in controlling status epilepticus. However, few well-designed randomised trials have been carried out in children, and there remains a paucity of data regarding intravenous sodium valproate use in children. Therefore, our aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of rapid loading of valproate with those of intravenous phenobarbital in children with status epilepticus and acute prolonged seizures. Sixty children (30 in each group) with convulsive status epilepticus and acute prolonged seizures were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either valproate or phenobarbital. The main outcome variable was termination of all convulsive activity within 20\u00a0min of starting anticonvulsant infusion. Intravenous rapid loading of valproate was successful in seizure termination in (27/30, 90%) of patients compared to phenobarbital (23/30, 77%) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.189). Clinically significant adverse effects occurred in 74% patients of the phenobarbital group and 24% patients of the valproate group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In conclusion, rapid loading of valproate is effective and safe in\u00a0controlling convulsive status epilepticus and acute prolonged convulsive seizures in children. Intravenous valproate should be considered as a suitable choice for terminating status epilepticus and acute prolonged seizures in children.", 
    "2": "Although the memory deficits produced by pre-training benzodiazepines administration have been extensively demonstrated both in humans and in animal studies, there is considerable controversy about the involvement of the state-dependency phenomenon on benzodiazepines-induced anterograde amnesia. The present study aimed to characterize the role of state-dependency on memory deficits induced by the benzodiazepine midazolam (MID) in mice submitted to the plus-maze discriminative avoidance task (PM-DAT). This animal model concomitantly evaluates learning and retention of discriminative avoidance task, exploratory habituation as well as anxiety-like behavior and motor activity. Mice received 2mg/kg MID before training and/or before testing in the PM-DAT. Pre-training (but not pre-test) MID administration impaired the retention of the discriminative avoidance task, which was not counteracted by a subsequent pre-test administration of this drug, thus refuting the role of state-dependency. Conversely, the pre-training administration of MID also led to an impairment of the habituation of exploration in the PM-DAT (an animal model of non-associative memory). This habituation deficit was state-dependent since it was absent in pre-training plus pre-test MID treated mice. Concomitantly, MID pre-training administration induced anxiolytic effects and diminished the aversive effectiveness of the aversive stimuli of the task, leading to an impairment of the acquisition of the discriminative avoidance task. Our findings suggest that pre-training benzodiazepine administration can impair the retention of different types of memory by producing specific deleterious effects on learning or by inducing state-dependent memory deficits.", 
    "3": "Desorption electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (DESI-MS), a novel ambient ionization technique, was used in this study for determining flunitrazepam in various alcoholic beverages. Using this technique, no pretreatment of the samples was necessary and identification of the drug was accomplished in individual samples in minutes. In addition, the acquired mass spectra provide the information of the identity of the drink based on the detected characteristic ions from the matrices. This study also demonstrates the capability of DESI-MS to perform quantitative analysis of simulated evidence samples with a limit of quantification of 3\u03bcg/mL. Furthermore it has been shown that this method can be used for high-throughput analysis whereby six samples were analyzed in a row within 6 minutes and no observable sample carry-over was noted. DESI-MS shows potential as a rapid, sensitive, and selective technique for forensic analysis of spiked beverages which are typical evidence of drug facilitated sexual assault and robbery cases.",

Flumazenil antagonizes these effects via competitive inhibition, so it has been used to reverse the effect of benzodiazepines. Recently, flumazenil has been reported to expedite recovery from propofol/remifentanil and sevoflurane/remifentanil anesthesia without benzodiazepines. Endogenous benzodiazepine ligands (endozepines) were isolated in several tissues of individuals who had not received benzodiazepines.",

The most common reasons were not bringing a competent adult escort at the start of the appointment (17% of total) and having consumed alcohol in the 24 hours pre-operatively (17%). Based on this, the patient information leaflet was revised. Patients received copies when being listed and then with their posted appointment letter, as well as being verbally reminded before attending. Second cycle results revealed a 22% increase in compliance rates across all instructions with all patients bringing competent escorts along.",

In addition, we aim to clarify some of the confusion surrounding the tools for detection and their limitation in practice. The literature reflects long-term neurocognitive impairments following ICU delirium and supports efforts to reduce these negative outcomes using protocol-driven sedation and ventilator management. Although haloperidol is widely accepted as the preferred pharmacologic treatment for delirium, its use is not seeded in robust evidence. Limited studies reflect the safety of atypical antipsychotics for treatment but lack clear improvement in delirium-related outcomes. We place an emphasis on the use of protocols to reduce the use of sedatives, particularly benzodiazepines in the management of ICU delirium.",

Praziquantel is the only drug in therapeutic use, leading to a permanent risk of parasite resistance. In search for new schistosomicidal drugs, meclonazepam, the 3-methyl-derivative of clonazepam, is still considered an interesting lead-candidate because it has a proven schistosomicidal effect in humans but adverse effects on the central nervous system did not allow its clinical use. Herein, the synthesis, in vitro biological evaluation, and molecular modeling of clonazepam, meclonazepam, and analogues are reported to establish the first structure-activity relationship for schistosomicidal benzodiazepines. Our findings indicate that the amide moiety [N(1) H-C(2) (=O)] is the principal pharmacophoric unit of 1,4-benzodiazepine schistosomicidal compounds and that substitution on the amide nitrogen atom (N(1) position) is not tolerated.", 
    "18": "Sublingually administered midazolam is commonly used for premedication of pediatric patients. However, the irritating taste and low aqueous solubility of midazolam complicate its sublingual use. Cyclodextrin complexation can be used to improve both the taste and aqueous solubility of drugs, but based on earlier studies, the complexation efficiency of midazolam is relatively low. In the present study, the complexation of midazolam with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) was investigated in the presence of various excipients. The aqueous solubility of midazolam improved significantly when HP-\u03b2-CD was used together with sucrose. Sucrose alone did not increase the solubility of midazolam. In addition, sucrose increased the apparent stability constant of the midazolam/HP-\u03b2-CD complex. The pharmacokinetics of midazolam in different dosage forms was investigated in rabbits (dose 1mg/rabbit) after intravenous administration of midazolam solution and after sublingual administration of midazolam solution, midazolam/HP-\u03b2-CD/sucrose solution or midazolam/HP-\u03b2-CD/sucrose powder. Midazolam displayed rapid sublingual absorption (mean t(max) \u226430min from the liquid formulations and 60 min from the solid formulation) with high absolute bioavailability (>68%) from all evaluated formulations. Based on the results, HP-\u03b2-CD and sucrose can be utilized together to prepare more concentrated and palatable midazolam formulations for sublingual administration in pediatric patients.",

Altered eurotransmission in the brain was suggested by similarities between increased GABA-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission and HE, specifically decreased consciousness and impaired motor function. Evidence of increased GABAergic tone in models of HE has accumulated; potential mechanisms include increased synaptic availability of GABA and accumulation of natural benzodiazepine receptor ligands with agonist properties. Pathophysiological concentrations of ammonia associated with HE, have the potential of enhancing GABAergic tone by mechanisms that involve its interactions with the GABAa receptor complex.",

Numerous controlled studies in both humans and rodents have reported that nicotine exerts a marked anorectic action. The effects of nicotine on energy homeostasis have been mostly pinpointed in the central nervous system, but the molecular mechanisms controlling its action are still not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of nicotine on hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its effect on energy balance. Here we demonstrate that nicotine-induced weight loss is associated with inactivation of hypothalamic AMPK, decreased orexigenic signaling in the hypothalamus, increased energy expenditure as a result of increased locomotor activity, increased thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT), and alterations in fuel substrate utilization. Conversely, nicotine withdrawal or genetic activation of hypothalamic AMPK in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus reversed nicotine-induced negative energy balance. Overall these data demonstrate that the effects of nicotine on energy balance involve specific modulation of the hypothalamic AMPK-BAT axis. These targets may be relevant for the development of new therapies for human obesity.",

    "62": "Correlations between GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)-R) activity and molecular organization of synaptosomal membranes (SM) were studied along the protocol for cholesterol (Cho) extraction with \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD). The mere pre-incubation (PI) at 37\u00b0C accompanying the \u03b2-CD treatment was an underlying source of perturbations increasing [(3)H]-FNZ maximal binding (70%) and K (d) (38%), plus a stiffening of SMs' hydrocarbon core region. The latter was inferred from an increased compressibility modulus (K) of SM-derived Langmuir films, a blue-shifted DPH fluorescence emission spectrum and the hysteresis in DPH fluorescence anisotropy (A (DPH)) in SMs submitted to a heating-cooling cycle (4-37-4\u00b0C) with A (DPH,heating)\u00a0<\u00a0A (DPH,cooling). Compared with PI samples, the \u03b2-CD treatment reduced B (max) by 5% which correlated with a 45%-decrement in the relative Cho content of SM, a decrease in K and in the order parameter in the EPR spectrum of a lipid spin probe labeled at C5 (5-SASL), and significantly increased A (TMA-DPH). PI, but not \u03b2-CD treatment, could affect the binding affinity. EPR spectra of 5-SASL complexes with \u03b2-CD-, SM-partitioned, and free in solution showed that, contrary to what is usually assumed, \u03b2-CD is not completely eliminated from the system through centrifugation washings. It was concluded that \u03b2-CD treatment involves effects of at least three different types of events affecting membrane organization: (a) effect of PI on membrane annealing, (b) effect of residual \u03b2-CD on SM organization, and (c) Cho depletion. Consequently, molecular stiffness increases within the membrane core and decreases near the polar head groups, leading to a net increase in GABA(A)-R density, relative to untreated samples.",

    "67": "Therapy of seizure activity following exposure to the nerve agent soman (GD) includes treatment with the anticonvulsant diazepam (DZP), an allosteric modulator of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) receptors. However, seizure activity itself causes the endocytosis of GABA(A) receptors and diminishes the inhibitory effects of GABA, thereby reducing the efficacy of DZP. Treatment with an N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist prevents this reduction in GABAergic inhibition. We examined the efficacy of the NMDA receptor antagonist caramiphen edisylate (CED; 20mg/kg, im) and DZP (10mg/kg, sc), administered both separately and in combination, at 10, 20 or 30min following seizure onset for attenuation of the deleterious effects associated with GD exposure (1.2 LD(50); 132\u03bcg/kg, sc) in rats. Outcomes evaluated were seizure duration, neuropathology, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, body weight, and temperature. We also examined the use of the reversible AChE inhibitor physostigmine (PHY; 0.2mg/kg, im) as a therapy for GD exposure. We found that the combination of CED and DZP yielded a synergistic effect, shortening seizure durations and reducing neuropathology compared to DZP alone, when treatment was delayed 20-30min after seizure onset. PHY reduced the number of animals that developed seizures, protected a fraction of AChE from GD inhibition, and attenuated post-exposure body weight and temperature loss independent of CED and/or DZP treatment. We conclude that: 1) CED and DZP treatment offers considerable protection against the effects of GD and 2) PHY is a potential therapeutic option following GD exposure, albeit with a limited window of opportunity.",

Pharmacokinetic studies in animal models are the important components in clinical development of this agent. In this study, a rapid and sensitive analytical method based on high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been developed for the determination of felotaxel in tumor-bearing mice plasma, urine, feces and tissues (brain, heart, liver, lung and kidney and tumor). For all matrices, sample preparation involved liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate. Calibration curves (1/x\u00b2 weighted) offered satisfactory linearity (r\u00b2 \u2265 0.995) within the test range. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for all matrices was 10 ng/ml except that for mouse plasma and brain LLOQ was 1 ng/ml. The accuracy and precision ranged from 86.1 to 107.2% and 1.1 to 9.2%, respectively. Recoveries (73.9-96.1%) and matrix effects (76.4-97.2%) were satisfactory in all the biological matrices examined. Stability studies (85.1-101.5%) showed that felotaxel was stable both during the assay procedure and long-term storage. The assay was successfully applied to plasma pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution and excretion study of mice. The pharmacokinetic parameters, such as half-life, mean residence time, maximum concentration were determined. The preclinical data are useful for the design of clinical trials of felotaxel.",

We investigated the mechanism by which GluA2Q(flip) receptor channel opening is inhibited by two 2,3-BDZ derivatives, i.e., 1-(4-aminophenyl)-3,5-dihydro-7,8-ethylenedioxy-4H-2,3-benzodiazepin-4-one (2,3-BDZ-11-2) and its 1-(4-amino-3-chlorophenyl) analogue (2,3-BDZ-11-4). Both compounds have a 7,8-ethylenedioxy moiety instead of the 7,8-methylenedioxy feature present in the structure of GYKI 52466, the prototypic 2,3-BDZ compound. Using a laser-pulse photolysis approach with a time resolution of ~60 \u03bcs and a rapid solution flow technique, we characterized the effect of the two compounds on the channel opening process of the homomeric GluA2Q(flip) receptor. We found that both 2,3-BDZ-11-2 and 2,3-BDZ-11-4 are noncompetitive inhibitors with specificity for the closed-channel conformation of the GluA2Q(flip) receptor. However, 2,3-BDZ-11-4 is ~10-fold stronger, defined by its inhibition constant for the closed-channel conformation (i.e., K(I) = 2 \u03bcM), than 2,3-BDZ-11-2. From double-inhibitor experiments, we determined that both compounds bind to the same site, but this site is different from two other known, noncompetitive binding sites on the GluA2Q(flip) receptor previously reported. Our results provide both mechanistic clues to improve our understanding of AMPA receptor regulation and a structure-activity relationship for designing more potent 2,3-BDZ compounds with predictable properties for this new noncompetitive site.",

Glial cell activation was detected by PET imaging with [(11)C]PK11195, a PET ligand for peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), before and at 4 weeks after laser treatment (moderate glaucoma stage). At mild, moderate, and advanced experimental glaucoma stages (classified by histological changes based on the extent of axonal loss), brains were stained with cresyl violet, or antibodies against PBR, Iba-1 (a microglial marker), and GFAP (an activated astrocyte marker). In laser-treated eyes, IOP was persistently elevated throughout all observation periods. PET imaging showed increased [(11)C]PK11195 binding potential in the bilateral LGN at 4 weeks after laser treatment; the increase in the ipsilateral LGN was statistically significant (P<0.05, n = 4). Immunostaining showed bilateral activations of microglia and astrocytes in LGN layers receiving input from the laser-treated eye. PBR-positive cells were observed in LGN layers receiving input from laser-treated eye at all experimental glaucoma stages including the mild glaucoma stage and their localization coincided with Iba-1 positive microglia and GFAP-positive astrocytes. These data suggest that glial activation occurs in the LGN at a mild glaucoma stage, and that the LGN degeneration could be detected by a PET imaging with [(11)C]PK11195 during the moderate experimental glaucoma stage after unilateral ocular hypertension.

The calibration is linear over the range of 78.125-5000 ng/mL for ketamine and 15.625-1000 ng/mL for xylazine and midazolam. The limits of detection are 17.8, 10.3, and 15.1 ng/mL for ketamine, xylazine, and midazolam, respectively. The extraction recoveries are 76.1% for ketamine, 91.0% for midazolam, and 78.2% for xylazine. The method is successfully used for clinical and pharmacokinetic studies of the three-drug fixed dose combination formulations.", 
    "123": "Our previous studies have shown that post-weaning social isolation of male rats leads to sensitization of serotonergic systems and increases in anxiety-like behavior in adulthood. Although studies in humans suggest that females have an increased sensitivity to stress and risk for the development of neuropsychiatric illnesses, most studies involving laboratory rats have focused on males while females have been insufficiently studied. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of post-weaning social isolation on subsequent responses of an anxiety-related dorsal raphe nucleus (DR)-basolateral amygdala system to pharmacological challenge with the anxiogenic drug, N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG-7142; a partial inverse agonist at the benzodiazepine allosteric site on the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptor). Juvenile female rats were reared in isolation or in groups of three for a 3-week period from weaning to mid-adolescence, after which all rats were group-reared for an additional 2 weeks. We then used dual immunohistochemical staining for c-Fos and tryptophan hydroxylase in the DR or single immunohistochemical staining for c-Fos in the basolateral amygdala. Isolation-reared rats, but not group-reared rats, injected with FG-7142 had increased c-Fos expression within the basolateral amygdala and in serotonergic neurons in the dorsal, ventrolateral, caudal and interfascicular parts of the DR relative to appropriate vehicle-injected control groups. These data suggest that post-weaning social isolation of female rats sensitizes a DR-basolateral amygdala system to stress-related stimuli, which may lead to an increased sensitivity to stress- and anxiety-related responses in adulthood.",

About 80% were aged 20 to 39 years. Forty-eight percent were Thai, 13% were British and 11% were American. The most commonplaces of death were residential areas and hotels. Pulmonary edema and needle marks were more common in opiate overdose cases than in non-opiate overdose cases. Toxicological findings showed that 61% of opiate overdose cases and 34% of non-opiate overdose cases were positive for blood morphine. Morphine was detected in about 95% of urine samples in both groups. About 62% of opiate overdose cases and 31% of non-opiate overdose cases had positive blood alcohol.",

Pulmonary edema and needle puncture marks were more frequently observed in opiate overdose cases. The number of cases of morphine detection in serum from the opiate overdose group was significantly higher than in the non-opiate overdose group. There was no significant difference in urine morphine detection between both groups. Other substances detected in these victims were alcohol, benzodiazepines, methamphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine and methadone. Alcohol was found significantly higher in opiate overdose fatality than in non-opiate overdose deaths.", 
    "134": "The presence of the translocator protein (TSPO), previously named as the mitochondrial or peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, in bone cells was studied in vitro and in situ using RT-qPCR, and receptor autoradiography using the selective TSPO ligand PK11195.In vitro, the TSPO is highly expressed in osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells.In situ, constitutive expression of TSPO is found in bone marrow and trabecular bone, e.g., spongiosa. Mice with a reduction of bone turnover induced by a 4-day treatment of osteoprotegerin reduces [(3)H]PK11195 binding in the spongiosa (320\u00b1128 Bq x mg(-1), 499\u00b1106 Bq x mg(-1) in saline-treated controls). In contrast, mice with an increase in bone turnover caused by a 4-day low calcium diet increases [(3)H]PK11195 binding in the spongiosa (615\u00b190 Bq x mg(-1)). Further, our study includes technical feasibility data on [(18)F]fluoride microPET imaging of rodent bone with altered turnover. Despite [(18)F]fluoride having high uptake, the in vivo signal differences were small. Using a phantom model, we describe the spillover effect and partial volume loss that affect the quantitative microPET imaging of the small bone structures in experimental mouse models. In summary, we demonstrate the expression of TSPO in small rodent bone tissues, including osteoblasts and osteoclasts. A trend increase in TSPO expression was observed in the spongiosa from low to high bone turnover conditions. However, despite the potential utility of TSPO expression as an in vivo biomarker of bone turnover in experimental rodent models, our small animal PET imaging data using [(18)F]fluoride show that even under the condition of a good biological signal-to-noise ratio and high tracer uptake, the currently achievable instrument sensitivity and spatial resolution is unlikely to be sufficient to detect subtle differences in small structures, such as mouse bone.", 
    "135": "The effects of \u03b1-asarone in four assays predictive of anxiolytic activity in male mice were studied, with diazepam as a positive anxiolytic control. The use of the elevated plus-maze test revealed that diazepam (2 mg/kg) or \u03b1-asarone (3.5 mg/kg) increased the percentage of entries into open arms and of the time spent on open arms. In the light/dark transition test, as with 2 mg/kg diazepam, 7 mg/kg \u03b1-asarone increased the time spent in the light area and the number of transitions between the two compartments. In the novel food consumption test, \u03b1-asarone (3.5, 7 and 14 mg/kg) caused significant increases in food intake during 5 min as well as diazepam (0.5 mg/kg). In the marble burying test, \u03b1-asarone also produced a significant inhibition of marble burying at doses of 14 and 28 mg/kg, as did diazepam (5 mg/kg). Thus, these findings indicated that \u03b1-asarone exhibited an anxiolytic-like effect. Further studies will be required to assess the generality of the present findings to other species and behavioral paradigms.",

Parametric volume of distribution (VT) images were generated using a basis function method (BFM) implementation of the single tissue compartment model (1T) and Logan plot analysis, both with a metabolite-corrected arterial plasma input function. Parametric binding potential (BP ND) images were generated using multilinear reference tissue methods (MRTM0-4), reference Logan and receptor parametric mapping (RPM1-2), with pons as a reference region. Standardized uptake value (SUV) and SUV ratio-to-pons (SUVr) images were calculated over the time interval 30-40 and 20-60 min postinjection. The resulting VT, BP ND, SUV and SUVr values were compared with nonlinear regression values, using both the 1T model and the simplified reference tissue model. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM5) was used to detect group differences, with an emphasis on the bilateral parahippocampal gyri.",

    "141": "Although the intrathecal administration of JM-1232(-) reportedly produces antinociception, this action has not yet been examined at the cellular level. We examined the action of JM-1232(-) on synaptic transmission in spinal substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons which play an important role in regulating nociceptive transmission from the periphery. The whole-cell patch-clamp technique was applied to the SG neurons of adult rat spinal cord slices. Bath-applied JM-1232(-) prolonged the decay phase of GABA(A)-receptor mediated spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) and increased its frequency without a change in amplitude. The former but not latter action was sensitive to a benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist flumazenil. JM-1232(-) also increased glycinergic sIPSC frequency with no change in amplitude and decay phase. On the other hand, glutamatergic spontaneous excitatory transmission was unaffected by JM-1232(-). These results indicate that JM-1232(-) enhances inhibitory transmission by (1) prolonging the decay phase of GABAergic sIPSC through benzodiazepine-receptor activation and by (2) increasing the spontaneous release of GABA and glycine from nerve terminals without its activation. This enhancement could contribute to at least a part of the antinociceptive effect of intrathecally-administered JM-1232(-).",

    "143": "Benzodiazepine (lorazepam, estazolam, chlordiazepoxide, and ketazolam) stability was studied in postmortem blood, bile, and vitreous humor stored at different temperatures over six months. The influence of NaF, in blood and bile samples, was also investigated. A solid-phase extraction technique was used on all the studied samples, and benzodiazepine quantification was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode-array detection. Benzodiazepine concentration remained almost stable in all samples stored at -20\u00b0C and -80\u00b0C. Estazolam appeared to be a stable benzodiazepine during the six-month study, and ketazolam proved to be the most unstable benzodiazepine. A 100% loss of ketazolam occurred in all samples stored over 1 or 2 weeks at room temperature and over 8 or 12 weeks at 4\u00b0C, with the simultaneous detection of diazepam. Chlordiazepoxide suffered complete degradation in all samples, except preserved bile samples, stored at room temperature. Samples stored at 4\u00b0C for 6 months had a 29-100% decrease in chlordiazepoxide concentration. The data obtained suggest that results from samples with these benzodiazepines stored long-term should be cautiously interpreted. Bile and vitreous humor proved to be the most advantageous samples in cases where degradation of benzodiazepines by microorganisms may occur.", 
    "144": "Concentrations of d,l-methadone were determined in blood samples from people arrested for driving under the influence of drugs (DUID), users of illicit drugs, and methadone-related deaths.

In DUID suspects and users of illicit drugs (N = 909), the blood-methadone concentrations were much lower, 0.23 mg/L (0.20 mg/L) and 1.1 mg/L (p < 0.001). The median concentration of methadone in blood decreased as the number of coingested drugs increased in the overdose deaths: 0.5 mg/L with methadone the only drug compared with 0.2 mg/L with 6-9 other drugs present (p < 0.001). These coingested drugs were mainly benzodiazepines (diazepam, alprazolam, flunitrazepam) and amphetamines; THC and morphine (from heroin) were the major illicit drugs. The overlap in blood-methadone concentrations in living cases and autopsy cases makes it difficult to conclude that methadone overdose was the cause of death. Adverse drug-drug interactions and varying degrees of tolerance to opiates complicate the interpretation.",

Data were extracted from 410 subjects who were treated with risperidone, olanzapine, or ziprasidone, received assessments for neurocognitive functions (verbal memory, vigilance, processing speed, reasoning, and working memory) and psychopathology, and provided plasma samples for the measurement of plasma antipsychotic concentrations. D2 receptor occupancy levels on the day of neurocognitive assessment were estimated from plasma antipsychotic concentrations, using population pharmacokinetic analysis and our recently developed model. A multivariate general linear model was used to examine effects of clinical and demographic characteristics, including estimated D2 occupancy levels, on neurocognitive functions.",

This study examined the functionality of the GABA(A) receptor in rotarod and elevated plus maze tests with fragile X mice treated with GABA(A) receptor agonists, the benzodiazepine diazepam and the neuroactive steroid alphaxalone. In addition, the effect of GABA(A) receptor activation on the audiogenic seizure activity was determined. We proved that the GABA(A) receptor is still sensitive to GABAergic drugs as the sedative effect of diazepam resulted in a decreased latency time on the rotarod and alphaxalone had a clear anxiolytic effect in the elevated plus maze, decreasing the frequency of entries, the total time spent and the path length in the closed arms.

Impairment is judged from the findings in blood. In our routine samples, urine is analysed if morphine is detected in blood to differentiate between ingestion of heroin, morphine or codeine and also in cases where the amount of blood is too low to perform both screening and quantification analysis. In several cases, the collection of urine might be time consuming and challenging. The aim of this study was to investigate if drugs detected in blood were found in oral fluid and if interpretation of opiate findings in oral fluid is as conclusive as in urine. Blood, urine and oral fluid samples were collected from 100 drivers suspected of drugged driving. Oral fluid and blood were screened using LC-MS/MS methods and urine by immunological methods. Positive findings in blood and urine were confirmed with chromatographic methods. The analytical method for oral fluid included 25 of the most commonly abused drugs in Norway and some metabolites. The analysis showed a good correlation between the findings in urine and oral fluid for amphetamines, cocaine/benzoylecgonine, methadone, opiates, zopiclone and benzodiazepines including the 7-amino-benzodiazepines. Cocaine and the heroin marker 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) were more frequently detected in oral fluid than in urine. Drug concentrations above the cut-off values were found in both samples of oral fluid and urine in 15 of 22 cases positive for morphine, in 18 of 20 cases positive for codeine and in 19 of 26 cases positive for 6-MAM. The use of cannabis was confirmed by detecting THC in oral fluid and THC-COOH in urine. In 34 of 46 cases the use of cannabis was confirmed both in oral fluid and urine. The use of cannabis was confirmed by a positive finding in only urine in 11 cases and in only oral fluid in one case. All the drug groups detected in blood were also found in oral fluid. Since all relevant drugs detected in blood were possible to find in oral fluid and the interpretation of the opiate findings in oral fluid was more conclusive than in urine, oral fluid might replace urine in driving under the influence cases. The fast and easy sampling is time saving and less intrusive for the drivers.", 
    "194": "This study assessed the association between second-generation antipsychotic medications and risk of pneumonia requiring hospitalization in patients with schizophrenia because the evidence is limited in the population. We enrolled a nationwide cohort of 33,024 inpatients with schizophrenia ranged in age from 18 to 65 years, who were derived from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan from 2000 to 2008. Cases (n = 1741) were defined as patients who developed pneumonia after their first psychiatric admissions. Risk set sampling was used to match each case with 4 controls by age, sex, and the year of the first admission based on nested case-control study. Antipsychotic exposure was categorized by type, duration, and daily dose, and the association between exposure and pneumonia was assessed using conditional logistic regression. We found that current use of clozapine (adjusted risk ratio = 3.18, 95% CI: 2.62-3.86, P < .001) was associated with a dose-dependent increase in the risk. Although quetiapine, olanzapine, zotepine, and risperidone were associated with increased risk, there was no clear dose-dependent relationship. Amisulpride was associated with a low risk of pneumonia. The use of clozapine combined with another drug (olanzapine, quetiapine, zotepine, risperidone, or amisulpride), as assessed separately, was associated with increased risk for pneumonia. In addition, with the exception of amisulpride, each drug was associated with increased risk for pneumonia at the beginning of treatment. Clinicians who prescribe clozapine to patients with schizophrenia should closely monitor them for pneumonia, particularly at the start of therapy and when clozapine is combined with other antipsychotics.",

Therefore, forensic toxicology plays an important role in this area, mainly linked to the detection and quantitation of these substances, both in\u00a0vivo and in post-mortem samples. In fact, at the moment, forensic sciences have been under public authorities' scrutiny and critical look, due to the increasing attention of the media and public opinion, always applying for the use of scientific knowledge to help solving forensic cases. However, forensic toxicology results are only reliable to solve legal cases if all the analytical methodologies used are appropriately validated. In this work, a methodology for the extraction and analysis of 7-aminoflunitrazepam, buprenorphine, flunitrazepam, ketamine, methadone, phencyclidine (PCP) and d-propoxyphene was developed for whole blood samples, with solid phase extraction (SPE), using OASIS(\u00ae) MCX SPE columns, and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The procedure presented here proved to be reliable, specific, selective and sensitive, with good LODs and LOQs and good precision.The adoption of a SPE procedure with an automatic SPE extraction device, allowed an increased level of automation in sample treatment, being contemporarily less time-consuming, increasing productiveness, and allowing good recovery and appropriate selectivity being, also, simple and reproducible. The simultaneous detection and quantitation of all compounds by the same extraction and detection methodology is crucial and has a great potential for forensic toxicology and clinical analysis.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate psychotropic medication use for children and adolescents treated as inpatients and to compare it with principles of rational pharmacotherapy, thus identifying possible downsides of current practices and pointing a way towards safer and more efficient practices. This is a descriptive study of prescribing trends at the Clinical Department for Children and Adolescents of the Institute of Mental Health in Belgrade, during the period from September 2009 to September 2010. Analyzed demographic data (age, gender) and the number of hospitalizations were obtained from medical histories, while diagnoses were obtained from discharge notes. Prescribed therapy was copied from medication charts. Drug dosages were analyzed as average daily doses prescribed during the hospitalization. Psychiatric diagnoses were classified according to The International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10). During the examined time period, 264 patients were hospitalized (61.4% males), with an average age of 11.4\u00b15.1 years. We have found that 66.3% of admitted patients were treated with pharmacotherapy in addition to other treatment modalities. There was a highly significant correlation between the age of patients and the prescribed dosage (Spearman's rho=0.360, p<0.001) as well as the number of prescribed drugs (Spearman's rho=0.405, p<0.001). The most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorders were: autism spectrum disorders (20.8%), conduct disorders(19.7%), mixed developmental disorder (14.8%), adjustment disorder (7.2%), mental retardation (7.2%),acute psychosis (4.5%), and ADHD (2.3%). The most commonly prescribed medications were antipsychotics(45.9%), followed by antidepressants (17.2%), mood stabilizers (16.1%), benzodiazepines (14.4%), and other psychotropic drugs (6.4%). The most commonly prescribed antipsychotic was risperidone, used for more than 50% of the patients treated with antipsychotics. Taken together risperidone and chlorpromazine were more than 75% of all prescribed antipsychotics. 98.4% of prescribed antidepressants belonged to the SSRIs,with sertraline and fluoxetine accounting for almost 90% of them. All prescribed dosages were in accordance with the official guidelines. This is the first survey in Serbia to document the practice of prescribing psychotropic medication in the field of child and adolescent psychiatry. Current drug-prescribing practices at the Clinical Department for Children and Adolescents of the Institute of Mental Health in Belgrade are in accordance with current practices in the United States and Europe. Not every child with symptoms of mental health problems needs pharmacological treatment; when they do, the general rule of thumb should be \"start low, go slow, and taper slowly\".

Currently, the availability of first generation antipsychotic (FGA) formulations is limited to two high potency agents: haloperidol and fluphenazine. At Yale New-Haven Psychiatric Hospital, the hospital pharmacy was able to create perphenazine suspension, a mid-potency FGA, with a record of effectiveness and tolerability that was no worse than that of second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) in the CATIE trial. In this study we compare perphenazine suspension to other first and SGAs in the risk of extrapyramidal reactions and whether or not patients were continued on the same antipsychotic they were started with at the time of discharge. Medical records of patients who received acute pharmacotherapy in a unique form while hospitalized at Yale New Haven Psychiatric Hospital from July 2009 to December 2009 were examined. All data were collected thru a chart review using a form that was created to systematically document experiences. A total of 229 patients were included in the study. There were no significant differences between treatment groups on gender, age, race or diagnosis. In the entire samples 1.75% had pseudo-parkonisnism, 1.31% had acute dystonia, 0.04% had tardive dyskinesia, 1.31% akithesia, and 4.8% any neurological side effects. There were no significant differences between agents in the likelihood of any of these side effects or of having any side effect. Higher use of anticholinergics was found in patients treated with FGAs. We also found that 77% were discharged on the same antipsychotic agent they received when they were initially hospitalized. A wide range of acute oral pharmacoptherapy in non-tablet formulations of first and SGAs should be available in psychiatric hospital formularies. FGAs seems to be as well tolerated as SGAs.",

BzRAs are readily available and effective in the short-term management of insomnia, but evidence of long-term efficacy is scarce and most hypnotic drugs are associated with potential adverse effects. CBT is an effective alternative for chronic insomnia. Although more time consuming than drug management, CBT produces sleep improvements that are sustained over time, and this therapy is accepted by patients. Although CBT is not readily available in most clinical settings, access and delivery can be made easier through use of innovative methods such as telephone consultations, group therapy, and self-help approaches. Combined CBT and drug treatment can optimise outcomes, although evidence to guide clinical practice on the best way to integrate these approaches is scarce.", 
    "246": "This study updated a 2001 decision economic model that used indirect data and confirmed its findings by developing a new cost-effectiveness model by using now available head-to-head data. The models compared olanzapine with ziprasidone in the treatment of schizophrenia in the United States.", 
    "247": "A decision analytic modeling approach was used to estimate annual health-care costs and health outcomes, incorporating events such as response, relapse, and suicide. Patients without response to first-line treatment switched to the other comparator. Decision tree probabilities were extracted from head-to-head studies and other published clinical literature. Direct health-care costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated on the basis of resource use and utility weights for initial and relapse episodes, maintenance therapy, and extended episodes of illness. Disutilities associated with treatment-emergent adverse events were included.", 
    "248": "Consistent with the 2001 model, this model found that first-line treatment with olanzapine is associated with fewer hospital days, fewer days with extrapyramidal symptoms, and higher QALYs than is first-line treatment with ziprasidone. Total costs were lower for the olanzapine pathway ($70,232-$72,776 vs. $73,086-$73,310 in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale analysis) due to the cost savings associated with reduced health-care resource use. The incremental cost per QALY gained indicated that the olanzapine pathway dominated the ziprasidone pathway.", 
    "249": "Decision analytic models should be continuously assessed against new data. This case study shows that incorporating new data confirmed results of a previously published model in which olanzapine was associated with better expected health outcomes and lower total health-care costs than was ziprasidone."
