    "0": "We have cloned the promoter regions of the genes for the mouse and human gamma2 subunits of the type A receptors for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). For the mouse, the two major transcription start sites were at +1 (by definition) and +43, as established by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and primer extension. This numbering places the start methionine at +297. There was no TATA or CCAAT box. Both mouse and human sequences have a candidate neuron-restrictive silencer element (NRSE) site in the first intron (+956 in mouse). We made assorted mouse-based promoter/reporter (luciferase) constructs starting from a core extending from -331 to +136, varying sizes at both ends, and including and excluding the putative NRSE and more proximal sequences. These were tested by transient transfection in several neuron-like and non-neuronal cell lines. Both proximal and distal downstream elements appeared to help direct expression to neuron-like cells, the NRSE in the intron, by repression in non-neurons, and a 24-bp portion of the 5' untranslated region starting at +113 (named GPE1) by preferentially promoting expression in neuron-like cells. Cotransfected human NRSF (transcription factor for NRSE) reduced reporter expression in neuron-like cells for constructs containing the NRSE in two locations. In gel mobility shift assays, the mouse gamma2 NRSE and a consensus NRSE both bound in vitro translated NRSF very similarly, and the NRSF gave the same major shifted band with the mouse gamma2 NRSE as was observed with nuclear extracts.", 
    "1": "Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides against muscarinic m2 and m4 receptors were used to investigate the role of these receptor subtypes as negative autoreceptors in the regulation of acetylcholine (ACh) release in the rat hippocampus. Following the continuous infusion of antisenses into the third ventricle (1 microgram microliter-1 h-1, 3 days), 3H-AF-DX 384/muscarinic M2-like binding was significantly decreased in the medial septum by the antisense against the m2 receptor whereas M2-like binding in the dorsal striatum was decreased by the antisense against the m4 receptor. In contrast, 3H-pirenzepine/muscarinic M1-like binding was unaffected by either antisense treatment in any of the brain areas investigated. When perfused into the hippocampus via a dialysis probe, the purported muscarinic M2 receptor antagonist AF-DX 384 (100 nM) increased hippocampal ACh release in freely moving rats. This effect of AF-DX 384 was significantly attenuated by the m2, but not the m4, receptor antisense treatment. Hippocampal choline acetyltransferase activity was not affected by either antisense treatments. Taken together, these results suggest that the molecularly defined muscarinic m2 receptor regulates hippocampal ACh release by acting as a negative autoreceptor. In contrast, the molecularly defined m4 receptor is unlikely to be directly involved in the negative regulation of ACh release in the rat hippocampus. Therefore, inhibiting muscarinic m2 receptor function may be an alternative approach to regulate the release of ACh in neurodegenerative diseases associated with impaired cholinergic functions.", 
    "2": "PYY is released from the distal ileum by fat and may be involved in mediating lipid-induced inhibition of gastric acid secretion and intestinal motility. The role of PYY in intestinal lipid-induced inhibition of gastric emptying in awake rats was investigated using a specific polyclonal antibody raised against PYY.", 
    "3": "Gastric emptying of liquids was measured in awake rats fitted with a Thomas gastric cannula. Intralipid (total dose 50 or 100 mg) was perfused for 10 min (0.05 ml/min) into a duodenal (n = 11) or mid-intestinal cannula (60 cm from Ligament of Treitz; n = 8), and gastric emptying was measured over the 5-10 min period. Gastric emptying was measured 15 min after IP injection of PYY (1 nmol/rat). PYY antibody (20 mg) or a control antibody (anti-KLH; keyhole limpet hemocyanin) was injected ip 8-12 h before experiments.", 
    "4": "Exogenous PYY (1 nmol) inhibited gastric emptying and administration of PYY antibody blocked this response. Perfusion of lipid (50 and 100 mg) into the proximal intestine produced a 46% and 66% inhibition of gastric emptying respectively. Inhibition of gastric emptying in response to 50 mg lipid in the proximal small intestine was unaffected by administration of PYY antibody but was abolished by administration of the CCK A receptor antagonist devazepide (0.1 mg/kg ip). Perfusion of lipid into the distal intestine (50 and 100 mg) inhibited gastric emptying by 10% and 32% respectively. Inhibition of gastric emptying in response to 100 mg lipid in the distal intestine was unaffected by PYY antibody.", 
    "5": "Lipid perfused into either the proximal or distal intestine inhibits gastric emptying via a PYY-independent mechanism. CCK is involved in proximal lipid induced inhibition of gastric emptying.", 
    "6": "We report here the cloning and characterization of a 5'-end alternatively spliced human cholecystokinin-B (CCK-B) receptor mRNA. The 5'-end of this CCK-B receptor transcript (termed CCK-BRtx) consisted of exon Ia, present in the ordinary full-length CCK-B receptor mRNA (CCK-BRwt), and exon Ib, present in a previously described 5'-end alternatively spliced CCK-B receptor mRNA (CCK-BRt). A short open reading frame preceded the AUG translation initiation codon of the CCK-BRtx. Transfection of COS-7 cells with the CCK-BRtx or CCK-BRt cDNAs did not lead to the appearance of peptidergic and non-peptidergic binding sites. Cell free in vitro translation yielded proteins of approximately 44 kDa (CCK-B receptor) and 40 kDa (CCK-BRt receptor) whereas no 40 kDa product was detected from the cloned CCK-BRtx cDNA. Instead, a protein product of approximately 9 kDa was visualized, the size corresponding to the predicted protein encoded by the short open reading frame. The alternatively spliced CCK-B receptor transcripts were concomitantly expressed with the ordinary full-length CCK-B receptor mRNA in the brain, pancreas, and stomach. The possibility that such transcripts are translated in vivo into truncated CCK-B receptors is discussed.", 
    "7": "The majority of pharmacological agents are designed to accomplish a specific effect based on the established mechanisms of a disease. However, there are a few examples in which investigation of a pharmacological action has led to a previously unknown mechanism, i. e. the drug effect was observed initially before its mechanism became known. For example, the opiates had been in use for their analgesic effect for centuries before the question of endogenous substances that might explain the presence of opiate binding sites in the central nervous system (CNS) was raised, leading to the discovery of the opioids. A somewhat analogous development has occurred in another investigative arena, the observation that the administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, has reversed the encephalopathy of hepatic failure. This has refocused research to discover whether one or more endogenous substances that bind to the benzodiazepine receptor in the CNS are responsible for the inhibition of CNS function of advanced liver failure. The investigative impetus was initiated by observations that patients with liver failure were highly vulnerable to benzodiazepines; therapeutic dosages precipitated coma or near-coma, and this effect was prolonged. The question was raised whether any given patient presenting with a coma-like state associated with advanced liver dysfunction might have received a benzodiazepine in the recent past, under circumstances overlooked or not recorded, that might be a contributing factor to the patient's condition. This led to testing the effects of the antagonist, with transitory success in arousing patients or improving their level of stupor. Further inquiry revealed that this improvement in mental function occurred in the absence of prior exposure to benzodiazepines. There followed a search for endogenous substances capable of binding to the benzodiazepine receptor, with CNS inhibitory effects. These investigations have resulted in the identification of several substances that may play a role in encephalopathy and can be displaced from the CNS receptor by properly designed antagonists-an ongoing investigative effort.", 
    "8": "Delirium is common among cancer patients, especially those with advanced disease. Typical treatment involves addressing the underlying cause if possible; eliminating nonessential and/or other drugs that can worsen confusion, manipulating the environment; and administering antipsychotic drugs to control symptoms and agitated behavior, and attempt to clear the patient's sensorium. The newer atypical antipsychotics may have potential in the treatment of delirium and also have the added benefit of causing less akithisia and other extrapyramidal side effects. This is illustrated by the case of a 59-year-old woman with leukemia and pain of unclear etiology who developed a delirium and a moderate to severe extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) in the setting of escalation of her pain medications and concomitant escalation of prochlorperazine. The patient presented with confusion and moderate to severe cogwheeling rigidity, masked facies, bradykinesia, and tremor. Additionally, the patient had a relatively recent history of subdural hematoma and one seizure. Conservative management including eliminating multiple nonessential medications (including the prochlorperazine); changing her opioid analgesic; providing a 24-hour companion: and administering low doses of haloperidol (0.5 mg-2.0 mg) were not effective in treating the patient's delirium. The patient's EPS was dramatically worse following haloperidol doses. After approximately I week without improvement, the patient was started on olanzapine 5 mg daily with initial improvement but with residual confusion in the evenings and overnight. The dose was titrated up to 10 mg nightly with 2.5 mg as needed during the day. After 3 days on this regimen, the patient's mental status exam was normal and she was discharged home. We discuss the potential utility of this atypical antipsychotic in the palliative care setting.", 
    "9": "The objective of the study was to assess what differences exist between individuals who are dependent on opiates and benzodiazepines and compare to those who are dependent on opiates. A questionnaire was compiled and administered to patients who had been consecutively admitted to an inpatient drug treatment unit. The prevalence of benzodiazepine dependency was 54 per cent [n = 34]. Patients dependent on benzodiazepines and opiates were significantly older, had been admitted for methadone stabilisation and were more likely to have been prescribed a methadone maintenance programme prior to admission. They had used heroin longer, benzodiazepines more frequently, at larger doses for a longer duration of time and tended to use more drugs in general. They were found to be more psychologically vulnerable than those not dependent on benzodiazepines as they were significantly more likely to have described a past experience of depression and a past episode of deliberate self harm.", 
    "10": "An alarming increase in the misuse/abuse of nitrobenzodiazepine derivatives, especially flunitrazepam, prompted us to establish reliable analytical protocols for their routine detection. Whilst the parent drugs are readily available from a number of commercial sources, it was found difficult to obtain samples of the corresponding amino metabolites which were required as analytical standards. This lead us to develop the straightforward synthetic protocol described here, to convert the readily available parent drugs, namely flunitrazepam and nitrazepam, to their respective 7-amino derivatives. The method requires minimum laboratory facilities. It involves the reduction of the nitro functionality in the parent drug to an amino group using tin (II) chloride under mild conditions, using ultrasonication at room temperature. The method is simple and should give toxicology laboratories better access to these much needed compounds.", 
    "11": "Three new color/screening tests for flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) are reported. The two-step tests are simple, sensitive, highly specific, and effective for both cut and uncut flunitrazepam and standard over-the-counter preparations of flunitrazepam (i.e., Rohypnol tablets).", 
    "12": "Rat fetal pancreas development and maturation were investigated in vitro and in vivo, and the informations available on their controls do not agree. Our main objective was to reinvestigate fetal pancreas growth in vivo through treatments of the dams during their entire pregnancy. Pregnant rats were thus implanted subcutaneously with Alzet minipumps and received cerulein (0.25 microg kg-1 h-1), gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP; 0.18 microg kg-1 h-1), GRP antagonist (12 microg kg-1 h-1), pentagastrin (2.38 microg kg-1 h-1), L-365,260, a cholecystokinin B (CCKB) receptor antagonist (120 microg kg-1 h-1), and hydrocortisone (417 or 833 microg kg-1 h-1). After sacrifice at the end of pregnancy, the pancreata of the dams and those of their fetuses were excised for weight, protein, RNA, DNA, and digestive enzyme determinations. In the fetus, pancreas growth defined as hyperplasia was observed only in response to hydrocortisone, while aplasia occurred in response to cerulein. Gastrin and the GRP antagonist were the most effective hypertrophic agents, and the effect of the CCKB receptor antagonist was atrophic. In conclusion, hydrocortisone caused proliferation of the fetal rat pancreas, whereas gastrin induced its differentiation and maturation probably through CCKB receptor occupation.", 
    "13": "A stability indicating, reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method utilizing a smallbore HPLC column has been developed for the determination of clonazepam in a commercial tablet dosage form. The use of a small bore column results in a substantial solvent savings, as well as a greater mass sensitivity, especially in the identification of degradation peaks in a chromatogram. The method involves ultraviolet detection at 254 nm and utilized a 150 x 3.0 mm i.d. column packed with 3 microm octyldecylsilane particles with a mobile phase of water methanol acetonitrile (40:30:30, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 400 microl min(-1) at ambient temperature, with and without the use of 1,2-dichlorobenzene as the internal standard. The current USP method for the analysis of clonazepam using a 300 x 3.9 mm i.d. conventional octyldecylsilane column was utilized as a comparison to the smallbore method. The retention times for clonazepam and the internal standard on the 3.0 mm i.d. column were 4.0 and 12.5 min, respectively. The intra- and interday RSDs on the 3.0 mm i.d. column were < 0.55% (n =4) using the internal standard, and < 0.19% (n = 4) without the internal standard at the lower limit of the standard curve, 50 microg ml(-1) and had a limit of detection of 24 ng ml(-1). The assay using the 3.0 mm i.d. column was shown to be suitable for measuring clonazepam in a tablet dosage form.", 
    "14": "This study examined the putative inhibitory effect of the atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine, on dizocilpine (MK-801)-induced stereotypy and hyperlocomotion. Dizocilpine (0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent increase in both stereotypy and hyperlocomotion. Pretreatment with olanzapine (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) inhibited the dizocilpine (0.5 mg/kg)-induced hyperlocomotion but not the stereotypy. At the higher doses (1, 2 and 4 mg/kg), olanzapine blocked both the stereotypy and hyperlocomotion induced by dizocilpine. Similarly, olanzapine, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg, did not inhibit apomorphine (3 mg/kg)-induced stereotypy, whereas the higher dose (1 mg/kg) blocked it. We also studied the effect of olanzapine on spontaneous locomotor activity and catalepsy. Olanzapine (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) did not induce a decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity but did so at the higher doses (1, 2 and 4 mg/kg). The lower doses (0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg) did not induce catalepsy but higher doses (2 and 4 mg/kg) induced a significant catalepsy which lasted for more than 4 h. The results thus showed that, at lower doses, olanzapine selectively inhibited behaviours mediated by the mesolimbic/mesocortical system while at higher doses it inhibited behaviours mediated by both mesolimbic/mesocortical and nigrostriatal systems. Therefore, the minimal extrapyramidal side-effects produced by olanzapine at effective doses might be due to its preferential action at the mesolimbic/mesocortical area.", 
    "15": "The frequency of potentially inappropriate prescribing for elderly outpatients and factors predicting inappropriate prescribing for these patients were studied. A panel of experts in geriatric medicine and geriatric pharmacology developed a list of 20 drugs generally considered to be inappropriate for elderly patients. Data on outpatient visits by patients aged 65 years or older were extracted from the 1994 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and analyzed with respect to the 20 potentially inappropriate medications. Potentially inappropriate medications were prescribed at 4.45% of elderly outpatient visits involving medications. An estimated 319,302 (95% confidence interval, 256,269 to 382,334) visits involved potentially inappropriate medications. The most frequently prescribed potentially inappropriate medications were diazepam, propoxyphene, dipyridamole, amitriptyline, and chlordiazepoxide; these drugs accounted for 85% of the outpatient visits involving potentially inappropriate medications. Patients were more likely to be prescribed potentially inappropriate medications if they had been referred; had a number of medications prescribed; had a prescription for an antianxiety agent, a sedative, an antidepressant, an analgesic, a platelet inhibitor, or an antispasmodic agent; or had a medication prescribed by a provider from a nonmetropolitan area. Ambulatory care providers prescribed at least one potentially inappropriate medication at 4.45% of visits by elderly patients at which a medication was prescribed; patient characteristics, provider characteristics, and drug-use profiles can be used to predict inappropriate prescribing.", 
    "16": "We investigated whether adenosine neuromodulation is involved in a benzodiazepine (midazolam)-induced depression of excitatory synaptic transmissions in the CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions in rat hippocampal slices. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs), evoked by electrical stimulation of the CA1-Schaffer collateral or the DG-perforant path, were recorded with extracellular microelectrodes from CA1-stratum radiatum or DG-stratum moleculare in oxygenated ACSF. The initial slope of the fEPSPs was analyzed for assessing the drug effects. Midazolam (1 microM) transiently depressed CA1- and DG-fEPSPs. The fEPSPs were depressed to approximately 75% of the control values, and then gradually recovered. The depression was not affected by bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist, although it was completely antagonized by aminophylline, an adenosine receptor antagonist. Dipyridamole (5 microM), an adenosine uptake inhibitor, depressed the fEPSPs in a similar manner to midazolam. An adenosine deaminase inhibitor, EHNA, also transiently depressed the fEPSPs, but in a different manner. Exogenous adenosine persistently depressed the fEPSPs. The effects of the drugs were not significantly different in the CA1 and DG regions. The results suggest that midazolam (1 microM) depresses excitatory synaptic transmissions through the adenosine neuromodulatory system by inhibiting adenosine uptake in the CA1 and DG regions of the hippocampus.", 
    "17": "Since the neuroactive steroid 3alpha,5alpha-tetrahydroprogesterone (3alpha,5alpha-THP) has pharmacologic actions similar to benzodiazepine agonists such as diazepam, the influences of chronic diazepam exposure on stress-induced brain levels of 3alpha, 5alpha-THP were examined. Groups of male, female, orchidectomized (ORCH), and ovariectomized (OVX) rats were compared, along with OVX groups given hormone replacement. Chronic diazepam exposure diminished stress-induced brain levels of 3alpha,5alpha-THP and serum corticosterone, although gender, gonadectomy and hormone replacement had disparate influences on these two endocrine responses to stress.", 
    "18": "The hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is becoming increasingly used clinically. It is useful in the differential diagnosis of portal hypertension and provides a prognostic index in cirrhotic patients. Performance of serial measurements has been shown to be useful in guiding pharmacological therapy of portal hypertension and variceal hemorrhage. The technique is safe to perform; however, many patients are anxious and reluctant to undergo serial measurements. The effects of sedatives on portal pressure measurements have not yet been defined. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of midazolam on the HVPG. Twenty patients with compensated cirrhosis were included in this prospective, double-blind study. The HVPG was determined by subtracting the free hepatic venous pressure (FHVP) from the wedged hepatic venous pressure (WHVP). Patients were randomized to receive either placebo, 0.02 mg/kg midazolam, or 0.03 mg/kg midazolam, administered intravenously over 3 minutes. Immediately after drug administration and every 3 minutes thereafter, for a total of 30 or 40 minutes, measurements were repeated. Three hours later, patients were asked to state whether the sedative affected their state of comfort/relaxation. The effects of both doses of midazolam on HVPG did not differ significantly from those of placebo. Furthermore, neither dose of midazolam induced significant changes in HVPG as compared with baseline values. However, higher-dose midazolam (0.03 mg/kg) was associated with significant reductions in FHVP from baseline and a tendency for a reduction in WHVP. Both doses significantly increased patient comfort and relaxation during the test. Midazolam, used at a dose of 0.02 mg/kg, is effective in increasing patient comfort and relaxation during hepatic venous pressure measurements, without significantly affecting pressures (HVPG, WHVP, or FHVP). It is therefore an acceptable option for patients undergoing serial hepatic venous pressure measurements.", 
    "19": "Alcohol abuse is one of the most common causes of seizures in adults. In a randomized, double-blind study, we compared lorazepam with placebo for the prevention of recurrent seizures related to alcohol. Over a 21-month period, we studied consecutive patients with chronic alcohol abuse who were at least 21 years of age and who presented to the emergency departments of two hospitals in Boston after a witnessed, generalized seizure. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either 2 mg of lorazepam in 2 ml of normal saline or 4 ml of normal saline intravenously and then observed for six hours. The primary end point was the occurrence of a second seizure during the observation period.", 
    "20": "Of the 229 patients who were initially evaluated, 186 met the entry criteria. In the lorazepam group, 3 of 100 patients (3 percent) had a second seizure, as compared with 21 of 86 patients (24 percent) in the placebo group (odds ratio for seizure with the use of placebo, 10.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.6 to 30.2; P<0.001). Forty-two percent of the placebo group were admitted to the hospital, as compared with 29 percent of the lorazepam group (odds ratio for admission, 2.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 4.0; P=0.02). Seven patients in the placebo group and one in the lorazepam group were transported to an emergency department in Boston with a second seizure within 48 hours after hospital discharge.",

    "22": "To compare the cognitive and behavioural effects of clobazam versus standard monotherapy in the treatment of childhood epilepsy.", 
    "23": "A randomized, double-blind, prospective design was carried out at three Canadian pediatric epilepsy centres. This study was part of a larger multi-centre study on the efficacy of clobazam. Children with newly diagnosed epilepsy were assigned randomly to receive clobazam or carbamazepine. Children who had failed previous treatment with carbamazepine were assigned randomly to clobazam or phenytoin. Children who had failed on any other antiepileptic drug were assigned randomly to receive clobazam or carbamazepine. In a subset of patients neuropsychological assessments were carried out at 6 weeks and 12 months after initiation of medication. Intelligence, memory, attention, psychomotor speed, and impulsivity were assessed.", 
    "24": "There were no differences between the clobazam and standard monotherapy groups on any of the neuropsychological measures obtained at 6 weeks or 12 months. There was no evidence for a deterioration in performance for those children who remained on clobazam for the entire 12-month study period.", 
    "25": "The cognitive and behavioural effects of clobazam appear to be similar to those of standard monotherapy.", 
    "26": "Inverse agonists of the GABA(A) receptor clearly decrease the amplitudes of the spontaneous EEG in the beta-frequency range. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that panic patients exhibit a reduction of the EEG's spectral power in the beta-frequency band. Ten unmedicated patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia according to DSM-III-R criteria and 10 matched controls were investigated under baseline conditions, after hyperventilation and 30 min after hyperventilation. EEG recordings from the position Pz and Cz were performed under eyes closed conditions. At baseline conditions the patients suffering from panic disorder depicted a reduced beta-power reaching statistically significance for lead position Pz. Immediately after hyperventilation for both channels we observed a decreased beta-power. After hyperventilation we observed the same situation as under baseline conditions. Taken together, our results point to the view that in panic disorder an endogenous inverse agonist of the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor could be hypothesized.",

    "28": "42 chronic alcoholics were included in this prospective and randomized study. Following the development of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, the patients were randomly allocated to the GHB or to the flunitrazepam group. In addition to this, clonidine was administered in order to treat autonomic signs of withdrawal. In cases were hallucinations occurred, haloperidol was administered.", 
    "29": "There was no significant difference in the efficacy of treatment used in the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit stay between groups. The patients in the GHB-group required significantly higher dosages of haloperidol and significantly lower dosages of clonidine. 14 out of 21 patients from the GHB-group developed hypernatriaemia and 15 out of 21 developed a metabolic alkalosis.", 
    "30": "Symptoms of the autonomic nervous system were more effectively prevented by GHB as evident in the lower dosage requirement of clonidine. However, GHB may not sufficiently block the hyperactivity of the dopaminergic system or may have an hallucinogenic effect itself. This may be evident from the higher dosages of haloperidol which were necessary. Due to the latter fact, the administration of GHB cannot be recommended in all patients suffering from AWS in ICU settings.",

In the last few days before her death the patient had disturbance of consciousness and of breathing. She died during grotesque tossing movements, thought to be due to a brain stem stroke. Autopsy revealed high-grade myocardial hypertrophy caused by the hypertension, contracted kidney of vascular cause, hyperplasia of the parathyroid and calcification of the renal parenchyma as a sign of secondary parathyroidism. The CNS showed severe dialysis-associated encephalopathy with characteristic argyrophilic, aluminium-induced lysosomal intracytoplasmic inclusions in the choroid plexus epithelium, cortical glia and numerous neuron populations. Laser microprobe mass analysis (LAMMA) confirmed manifold increase in subcellular aluminium content, especially in the neuronal cytoplasm, also demonstrated by atom absorption spectrometry. Additional distinct deposition of beta A4-amyloid, typical of Alzheimer's disease, was probably age-related rather than associated with the dialysis and the aluminium uptake.",

    "35": "Flunitrazepam, widely known by its trade names (e.g. Rohypnol), may cause severe violence, especially in combination with alcohol. Flunitrazepam abusers become cold-blooded, ruthless and violent, and do not remember their violence. Reputedly it is supplied to professional hit-men and enforcers by their bosses to promote ruthless efficacy. One case report describes how a young man, intoxicated with flunitrazepam and involved in causing serious knife and gunshot wounds and taking hostages, felt so invincible that he openly challenged the police, threatening them with an assault rifle, but was himself shot. Flunitrazepam may exert pharmacological effects on GABA-ergic systems, thus lowering serotonin levels. The impulsive execution of violent crimes and suicide attempts in which a violent method (hanging, shooting, self-stabbing) has been used are associated with the presence of low serotonin levels. It is therefore recommended that flunitrazepam should be classified as a controlled substance in Sweden as it is elsewhere.",

Two of the compounds have been found to exhibit moderate K(i) values of 8.9 and 9.2 microM at the human Bradykinin B2 receptor.", 
    "37": "The present study uses increased atmospheric pressure as an ethanol antagonist to test the hypothesis that allosteric coupling pathways in the GABA(A) receptor complex represent initial sites of action for ethanol. This was accomplished using behavioral and in vitro measures to determine the effects of pressure on ethanol and other GABAergic drugs in C57BL/6 and LS mice. Behaviorally, exposure to 12 times normal atmospheric pressure (ATA) of a helium-oxygen gas mixture (heliox) antagonized loss of righting reflex (LORR) induced by the allosteric modulators ethanol and pentobarbital, but did not antagonize LORR induced by the direct GABA agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo-pyridin-3-ol (THIP). Similarly, exposure to 12 ATA heliox antagonized the anticonvulsant effects verses isoniazid of ethanol, diazepam and pentobarbital. Biochemically, exposure to 12 ATA heliox antagonized potentiation of GABA-activated 36Cl-uptake by ethanol, flunitrazepam and pentobarbital in LS mouse brain preparations, but did not alter GABA-activated 36Cl- uptake per se. In contrast to its antagonist effect versus other allosteric modulators, pressure did not antagonize these behavioral or in vitro effects induced by the neuroactive steroid, 3alpha-hydroxy-5beta-pregnan-20-one (3alpha,5beta-P). These findings add to evidence that pressure directly and selectively antagonizes drug effects mediated through allosteric coupling pathways. The results fit predictions, and thus support the hypothesis that allosteric coupling pathways in GABA(A) receptors represent initial sites of action for ethanol. Collectively, the results suggest that there may be common physicochemical and underlying structural characteristics that define ethanol sensitive regions of receptor proteins and/or their associated membranes that can be identified by pressure within (e.g., GABA(A)) and possibly across (e.g., GABA(A), NMDA, 5HT3) receptors.",

TS-941 inhibited CCK-8-stimulated amylase release concentration dependently, as did devazepide and loxiglumide, with a half-maximal inhibition (IC50) at 78.6 +/- 10.3 nM. TS-941 was approximately 23 times less potent than devazepide (IC50, 3.4 +/- 0.3 nM), but was 50 times more potent than loxiglumide (IC50, 3,966 +/- 544 nM) in inhibiting 100 pM CCK-8-stimulated amylase release from rat pancreatic acini. TS-941 had a fivefold lower selectivity than devazepide for pancreatic CCK (CCK-A) over brain CCK (CCK-B) receptors but fourfold greater than loxiglumide when IC50 values for inhibition of [125I]CCK-8 binding in isolated acini and cerebral cortex were compared. The antagonism produced by TS-941 was specific for CCK in that the effects of other receptor secretagogues or agents bypassing receptors were not altered. TS-941 caused a parallel rightward shift of the entire dose-response curve for CCK-8-stimulated amylase release without altering the maximal increase, as did devazepide and loxiglumide. TS-941, whether added at the beginning or 20 min after the CCK-8 stimulation, inhibited amylase release. TS-941 caused a concentration-dependent residual inhibition of the action of CCK-8. The acini, once incubated with a high concentration of TS-941 (10 microM; 127 times IC50) for 30 min, was 10-fold less sensitive to CCK-8 than the acini preincubated without TS-941, whereas the sensitivity and the responsiveness to CCK-8 stimulation of those incubated with a low concentration of TS-941 (1.0 microM) were similar to the control acini. These results indicate that TS-941 is a potent, competitive, and selective CCK-A receptor antagonist for the pancreas.", 
    "39": "We examined the effects of benzodiazepine (BZD) hypnotics and zopiclone (ZPC), a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic, on sleep and psychiatric symptoms in schizophrenia, as well as the clinical correlates of these variables. Seven male schizophrenic patients chronically taking neuroleptics together with BZD were studied. We replaced BZD with ZPC and performed polysomnography (PSG) and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BRPS) scoring before and after an 8-week ZPC treatment. The replacement of BZD with ZPC increased the mean amplitude of high-amplitude low-frequency delta waves on the frontal derivation recognized by period-amplitude analysis, and it decreased the BPRS negative-symptom score. Under the BZD treatment, the negative-symptom score correlated inversely with the mean amplitude of high-amplitude low-frequency delta waves. This correlation was weak and not significant under the ZPC treatment. Therefore, delta waves during sleep have a close correlation to negative symptoms in schizophrenia, and such a correlation could be influenced by hypnotics. Although these are preliminary findings, it was suggested that, compared with BZD, ZPC might be a beneficial hypnotic in regard to both sleep and negative symptoms of chronic schizophrenic patients.", 
    "40": "This report describes studies of anticonvulsants for the organophosphorus (OP) nerve agent soman: a basic research effort to understand how different pharmacological classes of compounds influence the expression of seizure produced by soman in rats, and a drug screening effort to determine whether clinically useful antiepileptics can modulate soman-induced seizures in rats. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were used in these studies. Basic studies were conducted in rats pretreated with HI-6 and challenged with 1.6 x LD50 soman. Antimuscarinic compounds were extremely effective in blocking (pretreatment) or terminating soman seizures when given 5 min after seizure onset. However, significantly higher doses were required when treatment was delayed for more than 10 min, and some antimuscarinic compounds lost anticonvulsant efficacy when treatment was delayed for more than 40 min. Diazepam blocked seizure onset, yet seizures could recur after an initial period of anticonvulsant effect at doses </=2.5 mg/kg. Diazepam could terminate ongoing seizures when given 5 min after seizure onset, but doses up to 20 mg/kg were ineffective when treatment was delayed for 40 min. The GABA uptake inhibitor, tiagabine, was ineffective in blocking or terminating soman motor convulsions or seizures. The glutamate receptor antagonists, NBQX, GYKI 52466, and memantine, had weak or minimal antiseizure activity, even at doses that virtually eliminated signs of motor convulsions. The antinicotinic, mecamylamine, was ineffective in blocking or stopping seizure activity. Pretreatment with a narrow range of doses of alpha2-adrenergic agonist, clonidine, produced variable protection (40-60%) against seizure onset; treatment after seizure onset with clonidine was not effective. Screening studies in rats, using HI-6 pretreatment, showed that benzodiazepines (diazepam, midazolam and lorazepam) were quite effective when given 5 min after seizure onset, but lost their efficacy when given 40 min after onset. The barbiturate, pentobarbital, was modestly effective in terminating seizures when given 5 or 40 min after seizure onset, while other clinically effective antiepileptic drugs, trimethadione and valproic acid, were only slightly effective when given 5 min after onset. In contrast, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ethosuximide, magnesium sulfate, lamotrigine, primidone, felbamate, acetazolamide, and ketamine were ineffective.", 
    "41": "We employed propofol anesthesia with a restricted dose of fentanyl in adult cardiac surgery with the aim of early tracheal extubation and evaluated its effects on the intraoperative factors and postoperative recovery compared with those of a previous benzodiazepine-fentanyl regimen. During surgery, control group patients (n = 17) received intermittent bolus of benzodiazepines and fentanyl without restriction, whereas propofol group patients (n = 17) received continuous administration of propofol and the restricted dose of fentanyl (20 micrograms.kg-1). There were no significant differences in the times to eye opening (average 2.4 hr vs 1.6 hr, respectively, P = 0.30) and tracheal extubation (average 5.4 hr vs 4.0 hr, P = 0.25) between the groups. Both groups had similar postanesthetic circulatory status: cardiac index (average 3.6 l.min-1.m-2 vs 3.4 l.min-1.m-2, P = 0.46). The propofol group patients required smaller doses of vasodilators during cardiopulmonary bypass (average PGE1: 0.096 microgram.kg-1.min-1 vs 0.047 microgram.kg-1.min-1, P = 0.046, NTG: 0.69 microgram.kg-1.min-1 vs 0.31 microgram.kg-1.min-1, P = 0.009). It is suggested that propofol-based anesthesia could replace the previous regimen with no adverse hemodynamic effects and might have a potential to provide faster recovery and improve peripheral circulatory status in adult cardiac surgery.", 
    "42": "The pattern of all index admissions for benzodiazepine self-poisoning to a university hospital in Karachi, Pakistan are described. Of the 329 medication self-poisoning cases, 84% were benzodiazepine overdoses. Diazepam was the preferred drug in 69% of these cases, with majority ingesting between 20-30 tablets of 5 mg each, 44% bought the benzodiazepine over the counter (OTC) for the purpose of overdose. The preference for benzodiazepines over analgesics (as freely available) may be related to the motives underlying parasuicide acts and their popularity as 'sleeping pills' in Pakistan. Educating the 'chemist' and limiting the number of tablets dispensed at a time are areas to consider in reducing the incidence and harmful effects of benzodiazepine overdoses in Pakistan.", 
    "43": "Neurally mediated syncope is a complex syndrome that is often difficult to manage using currently available treatment strategies. The efficacy and safety of clonazepam was evaluated in 35 patients with refractory neurally mediated syncope. All patients had syncope (n = 33) or disabling presyncope (n = 2) and a positive head-up tilt table test (HUTT) despite treatment with one or more of the following therapies: beta-blocker, high-salt diet, fludrocortisone, elastic compression stockings, and disopyramide. Clonazepam was initiated at 0.5 mg/day and titrated in 0.25-0.5 mg/day increments for symptom control. Early (first 8 weeks) symptomatic response was achieved in 31 of 35 (89%) patients. Early HUTT reverted to negative in 29 of 35 (83%) patients. Two patients discontinued clonazepam during early follow-up due to side effects. Thirty-three patients received long-term clonazepam therapy. Twenty-five patients had late HUTT with 21 remaining negative. Of the eight patients who did not have late HUTT, one patient discontinued clonazepam prior to HUTT due to side effects. Seven patients refused late HUTT. All seven patients achieved symptomatic control on clonazepam with two requiring dose titration. Of the 21 patients with a negative late HUTT, 18 achieved symptomatic control with two of these patients requiring dose titration. Two patients who had only partial symptom control despite dose titration achieved total symptomatic control with the addition of disopyramide and beta-blockers. Two patients with a negative late HUTT discontinued clonazepam due to side effects. One patient had been symptomatically controlled while the other had recurrent symptoms with dose limiting side effects occurring after clonazepam dose titration. In the 4 patients with a positive late HUTT, 2 patients were symptomatically controlled, 1 patients required combination therapy with a beta-blocker to achieve symptomatic control, and 1 patient discontinued therapy due to side effects. Overall, 29 of 35 (83%) patients continue to receive clonazepam with symptom control. Based on intention-to-treat HUTT results, 21 of 35 (60%) patients were responders. Four patients required clonazepam dose titration and three required combination therapy with clonazepam plus disopyramide and/or a beta-blocker to achieve control. Clonazepam was discontinued in 6 patients, 5 for side effects and 1 following a transient ischemic attack. Clonazepam appears to be an effective therapeutic alternative in patients with refractory neurally mediated syncope. Based on our preliminary findings, a placebo controlled evaluation of clonazepam in neurally mediated syncope is warranted.", 
    "44": "With the introduction of the non-benzodiazepine hypnotics zopiclone and zolpidem it was expected to have hypnotics without side effects and risks characteristically seen with benzodiazepines. We report two cases with high-dose usage and dependency of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics. Both patients were prescribed the drugs to treat sleep disturbances occurring during a depressive episode. While one patient had a polysubstance abuse there was no evidence for an abuse history in the other patient. To reduce withdrawal symptoms long-acting benzodiazepines were given to both patients. Thus, it seems that not only patients with a history of substance abuse but also patients with a psychiatric disorder are at risk for abuse of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics. Considering the increasing number of case reports with abuse and dependence of zopiclone and zolpidem it seems necessary to reevaluate the dependency risk of the currently available non-benzodiazepine hypnotics.", 
    "45": "We report on the successful treatment of two female patients with psychotic depression with the new atypical neuroleptic drug olanzapine. A 75-year-old female inpatient suffering from recurrent endogenous depression with tactile hallucinations and coenesthesia was refractory to a systematic sequential antidepressant treatment strategy during a 39-week period. After addition of the new atypical neuroleptic olanzapine to the SSRI citalopram, she showed immediate and ongoing symptom relief. In the second case of a 57-year-old female inpatient suffering from delusional depression, we observed marked symptom relief and correction of the delusions of impoverishment. Olanzapine is discussed with regard to its receptor-binding profile (antagonism to 5-HT2A- and D1-D4 receptors) as a potential neuroleptic drug in the treatment of affective disorders with psychotic symptoms.", 
    "46": "To evaluate methodology for in vivo interaction studies of benzodiazepines (BZs) and ketoconazole (KCZ) in animal models, this study assessed the pharmacokinetics and electroencephalographic (EEG) effect of KCZ, and suitable dosage regimens of KCZ to maintain sufficiently high KCZ concentrations to inhibit metabolism of BZs in rats. Rats were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with KCZ 10 mg kg(-2). No significant EEG change was detected regardless of serum KCZ concentration, indicating that the EEG changes after both BZ and KCZ administration can be attributed entirely to BZ. Serum KCZ concentrations showed an apparent nonlinear pattern of decline with a short half-life (1.38 h). An additional dose of 5 mg kg(-1) i.p. given 180 min after the initial dose sustained KCZ concentrations above 2 pg mL(-1) until at least 500 min after the initial dose. These results provide the basis for design of animal models for in vivo assessment of interactions of BZs and KCZ.",

For example, the percentage reductions of time awake after sleep onset was highest for the combined condition (63.5%), followed by cognitive-behavior therapy (55%), pharmacotherapy (46.5%), and placebo (16.9%). Subjects treated with behavior therapy sustained their clinical gains at follow-up, whereas those treated with drug therapy alone did not.

    "55": "The pineal product melatonin is involved in the regulation of the sleep/wake cycle in humans. In blind individuals and in people travelling through time zones, melatonin rhythms are sometimes unsynchronized with the diel cycle, and nocturnal sleep may be disturbed. Low or distorted melatonin rhythms have repeatedly been reported in middle aged and elderly insomniacs. Melatonin administration effectively synchronized the sleep wake cycle in blind individuals and in subjects suffering from jet lag and advanced sleep onset in subjects suffering from delayed sleep phase syndrome. In elderly insomniacs, melatonin replacement therapy significantly decreased sleep latency, and/or increased sleep efficiency and decreased wake time after sleep onset. In addition, melatonin substitution facilitated benzodiazepine discontinuation in chronic users. These data show an association between melatonin rhythm disturbances and difficulties to promote or maintain sleep at night. Specific melatonin formulations may be useful to treat circadian-rhythm-related sleep disorders and age-related insomnia.", 
    "56": "The role of M2 and M3 receptors in the contractile and phosphoinositide responses elicited to oxotremorine-M was investigated in the guinea pig colon. Under standard conditions, both the contractile and phosphoinositide responses were insensitive to pertussis toxin and irreversibly antagonized by alkylation of M3 receptors with N-(2-chloroethyl)-4-piperidinyl diphenylacetate. After treatment with N-(2-chloroethyl)-4-piperidinyl diphenylacetate, the remaining contractile response was sensitive to pertussis toxin and weakly antagonized by the M2- and M4-selective antagonist AF-DX 116. In contrast, the residual phosphoinositide response was unaffected by pertussis toxin. The pertussis toxin sensitivity of the remaining contractile response suggests that the M2 receptor is mediating the contraction, whereas its weak antagonism by AF-DX 116 suggests that an alternate muscarinic subtype mediates the response. To explain this enigma, we investigated a mathematical model for receptor action based on an interaction between two receptor subtypes (M2 and M3). This model predicts that a response mediated by both the M2 and M3 receptor can be pertussis toxin sensitive yet exhibit an antagonistic profile indicative of an M3 response.",

As possible predisposing factors scoliosis, cerebral palsy, use of anticonvulsant drugs or other benzodiazepines, and IQ <35 were found, whereas symptoms such as vomiting, hematemesis, rumination, and depressive symptoms were indicative for reflux. At endoscopy reflux esophagitis was diagnosed in 129 of the 186 patients (69.4%). In 61 (47.3%) of 129 patients, grade I, 43 (33.3%) grade II, 25 (19.4%) grade III/IV (Savary-Miller) were found.

First, however, secondary causes should be sought, especially iron deficiency and peripheral neuropathy, because when the source is an accompanying factor or condition, the syndrome may be curable.

    "62": "A case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) in a 23 year old male patient is reported. The symptoms were hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, change in mental status, sinus tachycardia, creatinine phosphokinase elevation and myoglobinuria. The patient suffered from severe muscle pain and compromised respiratory function. Treatment was cessation of neuroleptic medication and institution of intensive medical care focusing on symptomatic treatment. One week after admission clinical status and laboratory findings were normalized and the patient was readmitted to a psychiatric hospital. The neuroleptic medication of the reported patient had been olanzapine during seven months at a dose of 25 mg daily. The day before onset of NMS the pharmacological treatment was supplemented by 100 mg of clozapine. The cause of onset of NMS in this case is discussed. Clozapine, an atypical neuroleptic, is known to have reduced potential to cause NMS and in such cases without extrapyramidal symptoms. Olanzapine, however, has not yet been reported to cause NMS. Alternatively the cause of onset of NMS in this patient could be explained by the combination treatment and possible synergistic effect of the two antipsychotic drugs. Further research in this field is needed.",

One patient had trans-cricothyroid jet ventilation performed through a 16G intravenous cannula prior to an urgent tracheostomy. In the other patient, an emergency tracheostomy was inserted. Interestingly, both patients had been sedated in the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit with morphine and benzodiazepines before their scheduled surgeries. The most likely etiology for the complete upper airway obstruction was laryngospasm due to inadequate topicalization of the airway and additional sedation given in the operating room. Neither patients suffered any new neurological deficits following these events. They went on to have uneventful surgeries.",

    "73": "Elderly people with impaired mobility frequently experience difficulty with medication administration and compliance. Many medications are dispensed in packages or in containers which are difficult to access by older people with disabilities. Attending a medical centre, activating an inhaler, applying eyedrops or opening medication containers can prove major obstacles to medication compliance for older people with impaired function. Assessment of each patient's ability to physically comply with medication regimens by the physician is therefore recommended. Contact with the care giver or support person should also be made where appropriate. Compliance aids such as some calendar packages for medications, metered dose inhalers (MDIs) or eyedrop aids should be prescribed where indicated. Because of their close contact with many elderly patients when dispensing, pharmacists can also play an important role in ensuring adherence with medication regimens. Some medications may improve mobility as seen in the treatment of Parkinson's disease whereas other medications such as phenothiazines may impair mobility and contribute to falls. Several drug classes including antipsychotics, antidepressants, antihypertensives and benzodiazepines have been recognised as having an association with falls and impaired mobility. Multiple medications have also been found to be a risk factor in falls. Medications should be reviewed regularly and rationalised where possible. If mobility problems or unexplained falls are occurring, medications should be closely scrutinized as they may be responsible. Where possible, domiciliary visits for older people should be undertaken by health professionals as they often provide critical information about a patient's functional status, their medication compliance and their ability to cope at home. Emphasis must be placed on older people maintaining their independence and mobility. This is best achieved through a multidisciplinary approach.", 
    "74": "Sleep is important for health and quality of life at all ages, and poor sleep interacts with many medical conditions. Somatic and psychiatric diseases, and unfavourable habits and life-style factors, increase the propensity to insomnia in older persons. As health deteriorates with age, sleep becomes poorer. Heart disease and stroke, cancer, painful conditions, breathing disorders and nocturnal polyuria syndrome often disturb sleep. Dementia and depression, which are often associated with sleep disturbances, are also more prevalent in the elderly. Moreover, true age-related sleep deterioration occurs after the age of 75 years. Attempts to improve sleep should first and foremost be focused on elimination of somatic and psychiatric symptoms as far as possible, and on modification of lifestyle factors that may affect sleep quality. For short term treatment, hypnotics are appropriate; for longer periods, nonpharmacological methods, for example light therapy or behavioural modification techniques, should be considered, as many hypnotic drugs are less suitable for long term use. However, there are situations when sleep medication must continue for long periods, especially in elderly patients with severe diseases and poor quality of life. In these patients, careful individualisation of therapy is appropriate.",

In order to rationalize the therapeutic use of etizolam, its pharmacodynamics properties on GABAA receptors were investigated by a comparative study with other ligands on human recombinant GABAA as well as rat brain native receptors. Etizolam inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner [3H]flunitrazepam (CAS 1622-62-4) binding to rat cortical membranes, with an affinity of 4.5 nmol/l greater than that of alprazolam (CAS 28981-97-7) (7.9 nmol/l). Ethizolam enhanced GABA-induced Cl- currents in oocytes expressing human cloned GABAA receptors. With alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2S subunit combination, etizolam produced a 73% increase in GABA-induced currents with an EC50 of 92 nmol/l. At the same receptor type, alprazolam showed a higher degree of potentiation and potency (98%, EC50 56 nmol/l). At alpha 2 beta 2 gamma 2S or alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 2S subunit constructs, the effects of etizolam were similar to those of alprazolam. Flumazenil (CAS 78755-81-4) completely blocked both etizolam and alprazolam effects on GABA-induced currents. Etizolam, administered i.p., was uneffective in changing ex vivo t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]-TBPS) binding to rat cerebral cortex, whereas alprazolam and abecarnil (CAS 111841-85-1) significantly reduced this parameter. However, etizolam similarly to abecarnil and alprazolam, antagonized isoniazid-induced increase (61%) in [35S]-TBPS binding to rat cortical membranes. Further, etizolam inhibited in a dose-dependent manner basal acetylcholine release from both hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and reversed foot-shock-induced increase of basal acetylcholine release to a control level. Altogether, these results suggest that etizolam may have a reduced intrinsic activity, at least at specific subpopulations of GABAA receptors. This property, together with the pharmacokinetic indication of a short-acting drug, may characterize etizolam as a ligand endowed with less side-effects typical of full agonits such as diazepam (CAS 439-14-5) and alprazolam. Finally, given its marked efficacy under conditions of GABAergic deficit, etizolam may represent a possible drug of choice with reduced liability to produce tolerance and dependence after long-term treatment of anxiety and stress syndromes.", 
    "89": "Multiple subtypes of GABAA receptors are expressed in the rat central nervous system (CNS). To determine the distribution and proportion of alpha5 subunit containing receptors, quantitative autoradiographic analyses were performed with both [3H]L-655,708 and [3H]Ro15-1788, an alpha5 selective and a non selective benzodiazepine binding site ligand, respectively. High densities of [3H]L-655,708 binding sites were observed in hippocampus and olfactory bulb, where alpha5 receptors accounted for 20-35% of total [3H]Ro15-1788 binding sites. Low levels of [3H]L-655,708 sites were associated with the cortex as well as amygdala, thalamic, hypothalamic and midbrain nuclei. These observations indicate that although [3H]L-655,708 binding sites have an overall low expression in rat CNS, they may contribute significantly to GABAergic inhibition in specific brain regions.", 
    "90": "Changes in the mRNA encoding alpha1, alpha2, beta2 and gamma2 subunits of the GABAA receptor associated with the anxiolytic effects of alprazolam were measured in 20 brain regions using in situ hybridization techniques. Compared to non-punished controls, punishment decreased alpha1 mRNA levels in two nuclei of the amygdala, the cerebral cortex, and the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus and decreased alpha2 mRNA levels in the hippocampus. Punishment increased beta2 mRNA levels in ventroposterior thalamic nucleus and gamma2 mRNA levels in the CA2 area of the hippocampus. All of these effects were reversed when alprazolam increased punished responding, while alprazolam alone had no effect on either non-punished responding or GABAA receptor subunit regulation in these brain regions. Some brain regions that were unaffected by punishment were altered by alprazolam plus punishment. These results demonstrate that punishment and alprazolam can produce reciprocal changes in the mRNA levels for some subunits of the GABAA receptor. These changes may alter GABAergic synaptic inhibition by altering the density of GABAA receptors or their efficacy to bind drugs. They suggest that the underlying mechanisms by which drugs affect behavior can depend upon the conditions under which behavior is assessed.", 
    "91": "The effect of benzodiazepine (BDZ) withdrawal on escape acquisition and on the behavioral response to two different reinforcing stimuli was investigated. In addition, the influence of antidepressant drugs (AD) differing in their mechanism of action on these behavioral outputs was also evaluated. Rats subjected to withdrawal from a chronic treatment with diazepam (DZM; 2 mg/kg per day, i.p.) during 21 days were subsequently exposed to a brief inescapable shock session (IS) and 48 h later to an active avoidance test. Only withdrawn animals exposed to the IS exhibited enhanced escape failures. In an additional experiment, withdrawn rats were repeatedly administered with vehicle (VEH), desipramine (DMI; 5 mg/kg, i.p.), fluoxetine (FLU; 5 mg/kg, i.p.) or phenelzine (PHEN; 5 mg/kg, i.p.) and subsequently exposed to IS and to active avoidance task. A significant reversal of escape deficit was only observed following DMI and PHEN but not after FLU. Furthermore, withdrawn rats showed a reduced preference for a sexually relevant olfactory cue, this reduced sensitivity was only normalized following DMI but not after the administration of FLU or PHEN. Finally, rats exposed to abrupt cessation of chronic BDZ administration did not exhibit preference for a context previously associated with amphetamine (AMP) under the conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure. All these findings are indicative that BDZ withdrawal facilitates the subsequent occurrence of behavioral changes-escape failures and reduced behavioral response to rewarding stimuli-suggested to parallel important symptoms of human depression. In addition, DMI seems to be much more effective in restoring such behavioral abnormalities as compared to a MAO inhibitor and to a inhibitor of 5-HT uptake.", 
    "92": "The modulation of kainate-induced responses by pentobarbitone and the 2,3-benzodiazepine GYKI-53784 (LY303070), a potent non-competitive AMPA antagonist, was studied in vivo using both extracellular recordings of antidromic field potentials and intracellular recordings from abducens motoneurons in ketamine/diazepam-anesthetized rats. In previous studies on pentobarbitone-anesthetized rats [M. Ouardouz, J. Durand, GYKI-52466 antagonizes glutamate responses but not NMDA and kainate responses in rat abducens motoneurons, Neurosci. Lett. 125 (1991) 5-8; M. Ouardouz, J. Durand, Involvement of AMPA receptors in trigeminal postsynaptic potentials recorded in rat abducens motoneurons in vivo, Eur. J. Neurosci. 6 (1994) 1662-1668; A. Ruiz, J. Durand, Blocking the trigeminal EPSPs in rat abducens motoneurons in vivo with the AMPA antagonists, NBQX and GYKI-53655, J. Neurophysiol. (1998) submitted], we showed that 2,3-benzodiazepines do not affect kainate-induced depolarizations in abducens motoneurons. Here, we tested whether pentobarbitone is involved in the pharmacological discrimination by 2,3-benzodiazepines between AMPA- and kainate-induced responses. Kainate-induced depolarizations were reversibly depressed after application of either GYKI-53784 and pentobarbitone. However, kainate-induced depolarizations were not inhibited by GYKI-53784 with pentobarbitone; they were even potentiated sometimes. Using extracellular recordings, we confirmed that in the presence of pentobarbitone, GYKI-53784 counteracts the effects of AMPA but not of kainate on antidromic field potentials in the abducens nucleus. Blockade of kainate-induced responses by GYKI-53784 was reversed with pentobarbitone, which appears relevant to the discrimination between AMPA- and kainate receptor-mediated responses in vivo. In the presence of pentobarbitone, kainate would depolarize motoneurons mainly via kainate receptors since kainate-induced responses were not depressed by 2,3-benzodiazepines. This finding strongly favors the existence of kainate receptors in adult motoneurons but their role is still unknown.", 
    "93": "During the last two years, the well-known positive role of benzodiazepines (midazolam and diazepam) in conscious sedation, both in adults and pediatric patients, has been confirmed by several studies. However, problems concerning the role of sedation and analgesia in nonoperative endoscopy are still a matter of debate. Particular attention has focused on attempts to identify the \"ideal candidate\" for conscious sedation, and on the importance of providing patients with information before the procedure, which should be matched to each patient's style of coping. Before detailed information about a medical procedure is given blindly, the clinician should investigate whether such information will benefit or adversely affect the patient receiving it. An important aspect of the sedation procedure is the prevention of hypoxia and cardiopulmonary complications. Recent endoscopic experience has provided little additional information concerning the well-known risk of oxygen desaturation during conscious sedation. Performing endoscopy in sedated patients reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of hypoxia. Some independent variables capable of predicting severe desaturation have been recognized, such as basal SaO2 < 95%, respiratory disease, more than one attempt needed for intubation, emergency procedure, and an American Society of Anesthesiologists score of III or IV. As far as preparation is concerned, some light has been cast by a meta-analysis of available studies concerning the role of sodium phosphate and polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution (PEG-ELS). The former preparation has been found to be as effective and less costly compared with the latter. In particular, sodium phosphate may be preferable in patients without cardiovascular or renal co-morbidity, and in those with a tendency to develop nausea or bloating.", 
    "94": "We investigated the effects of OT-7100, a novel analgesic compound (5-n-butyl-7-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoylamino)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidi ne), on prostaglandin E2 biosynthesis in vitro, acute hyperalgesia induced by yeast and substance P in rats and hyperalgesia in rats with a chronic constriction injury to the sciatic nerve (Bennett model), which is a model for peripheral neuropathic pain. OT-7100 did not inhibit prostaglandin E2 biosynthesis at 10(-8)-10(-4) M. Single oral doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg OT-7100 were effective on the hyperalgesia induced by yeast. Single oral doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg OT-7100 were effective on the hyperalgesia induced by substance P in which indomethacin had no effect. Repeated oral administration of OT-7100 (10 and 30 mg/kg) was effective in normalizing the mechanical nociceptive threshold in the injured paw without affecting the nociceptive threshold in the uninjured paw in the Bennett model. Indomethacin had no effect in this model. While amitriptyline (10 and 30 mg/kg) and clonazepam (3 and 10 mg/kg) significantly normalized the nociceptive threshold in the injured paw, they also increased the nociceptive threshold in the uninjured paw. These results suggest that OT-7100 is a new type of analgesic with the effect of normalizing the nociceptive threshold in peripheral neuropathic hyperalgesia.", 
    "95": "The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of chronic flumazenil treatment alone and simultaneously with diazepam on acquisition performance in an active-avoidance task and on locomotor activity in rats. Flumazenil (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) and diazepam (0,5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally to rats before each daily training session for 5 days. The baseline of avoidance performance was set to approximately 50% and responses were expressed as acquisition rate. Locomotor activity of the rats was simultaneously recorded but only following the first training session. Diazepam decreased acquisition rate between the dose range used. Flumazenil had no effect on the acquisition rate of naive rats but reversed low dose diazepam-induced learning and memory impairment. Diazepam induced locomotor depression within the same dose range that decreased acquisition rate. Flumazenil had no effect on locomotor activity, but reversed the locomotor depressant effect of diazepam. The striking contradiction with previous data that flumazenil has no effect on learning-memory processing is discussed.", 
    "96": "The aim of present study was to reveal the role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in the jumping behaviour induced by the opioid antagonist naloxone (30 mg/kg) after the acute administration of morphine (200 mg/kg) in mice. Treatment with caerulein (0.01-1 microg/kg), a nonselective agonist of CCK receptors, induced a large reduction of jumping frequency without parallel suppression of locomotor activity. The CCK(B) receptor agonist CCK tetrapeptide (CCK-4. 0.125-32 mg/kg) caused the same effect, but it happened at much higher doses (above 0.5 mg/kg). Devazepide (1 microg/kg), a preferential CCK(A) receptor antagonist, completely reversed the action of caerulein (0.1 gmg/kg) and CCK-4 (2 mg/kg). A preferential CCK(B) receptor antagonists LY 288,513 at a high dose (4 mg/kg) blocked the action of CCK-4, but not that of caerulein. Acetorphan (16-128 mg/kg), an inhibitor of enkephalin metabolism, did not block naloxone-precipitated jumping behaviour. However, the combination of subthreshold doses of caerulein (0.001 microg/kg) and CCK-4 (0.25 mg/kg) with acetorphan (64 mg/kg) potently antagonized the behaviour induced by naloxone. In conclusion, the antagonism of CCK agonists against naloxone-precipitated jumping behaviour is apparently mediated via the CCK(A) receptor subtype. The stimulation of CCK(A) receptors seems to increase the release of endogenous enkephalins.", 
    "97": "In order to investigate the relative efficacy and safety of zopiclone and zolpidem, we compared the effects of higher doses of zopiclone and zolpidem on the frequency of hippocampal theta activity and sleep structure with that of triazolam. Rats were divided into triazolam treatment group (1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg), zopiclone treatment group (20 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg) and zolpidem treatment group (20 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg). Rats were injected intraperitoneally with these drugs or their vehicle. Polygraphic sleep recording and visual frequency analysis of the hippocampal EEG activity in REM sleep were carried out for 6 h after each injection. Zolpidem, unlike triazolam and zopiclone, had a much milder reducing-effect on the frequency of hippocampal theta activity and suppressing-effect on REM sleep. These results suggest that zolpidem may prove to be a safer hypnotic drug which has fewer or milder side effects than are benzodiazepine and cyclopyrrolone hypnotics.", 
    "98": "In the present study we investigated the effects of NMDA and non-NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists on the ischemia-evoked release of [3H]noradrenaline from rat spinal cord slices. An in vitro ischemia model (oxygen and glucose deprivation) was used to simulate the ischemic conditions known to cause neuronal injury. Spinal cord slices were loaded with [3H]noradrenaline and superfused with Krebs solution in a micro-organ bath. Both axonal stimulation and ischemia increased the release of [3H]noradrenaline, but the release in response to glucose and oxygen deprivation was [Ca2+]o independent. Dizocilpine (MK-801), an NMDA receptor antagonist, suppressed the release of [3H]noradrenaline produced by ischemia, while it enhanced the release of [3H]noradrenaline evoked by electrical field stimulation. In contrast, LY300168 (GYKI-53655) [(+/-)-3-N-methylcarbamyde-1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-1.8-methylen e-dioxy-5H-2.3-benzodiazepine] and its (-)isomer LY303070 (GYKI-53784) [(-)-3-N-methylcarbamyde-1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-1.8-methylene- dioxy-5H-2.3-benzodiazepine] AMPA receptor antagonists, had no effect on the release of [3H]noradrenaline evoked by either electrical stimulation or ischemia. Desipramine, a noradrenaline uptake inhibitor, potentiated the release of [3H]noradrenaline evoked by ischemia, while in the absence of [Ca2+]o but under conditions when [3H]noradrenaline release was further increased, it reduced the release. Dizocilpine also decreased glutamate and aspartate release, measured by high performance liquid chromatography, during ischemia. It is concluded that glutamate release and NMDA receptors, but not AMPA receptors, are involved in the acute effect of oxygen and glucose deprivation on the excessive release of noradrenaline and that this release is not related to physiological axonal conduction.", 
    "99": "N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (NNA; an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase) in a dose of 40 mg/kg impaired the protective activity of ethosuximide against the clonic phase of pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in mice. The ED50 value of ethosuximide was significantly increased from 108 to 158 mg/kg. NNA (40 mg/kg) was ineffective against the protective effects of diazepam, phenobarbital and valproate against pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. NNA (40 mg/kg) did not influence the plasma levels of the antiepileptic drugs studied, so a pharmacokinetic interaction is not probable. L-Arginine (500 mg/kg) prevented the NNA-induced reduction of the anticonvulsive activity of ethosuximide. It can be concluded that nitric oxide participates in the expression of the anticonvulsive action of ethosuximide, but not that of diazepam, phenobarbital and valproate, against pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures.", 
    "100": "Pregnancy is a time of great emotional change for a woman, producing increased stress and anxiety. Medication may be required for the treatment of anxiety disorders at this time. Given the fact that psychotropic drugs readily cross the placenta and could have important implications for the developing fetus, it is necessary to balance the possible effects of medication against the potential effects to both the mother and fetus if the anxiety disorder is left untreated. Despite the widespread use of psychotropic drugs such as benzodiazepines and antidepressants during pregnancy, there is a paucity of information regarding the effect of such exposure on the developing fetus. From a review of the literature it is clear that the issue of safety of psychotropic drugs during pregnancy is far from resolved. While some of the findings from animal studies are alarming, these studies cannot be directly extrapolated to humans. In addition, varying sample sizes and multiple drug exposures further complicate interpretation of human studies. Nonpharmacological treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy should be employed whenever possible for the treatment of anxiety disorders during pregnancy. However, if medication is required pregnant women should be prescribed the lowest dosage for the minimum amount of time.", 
    "101": "A series of 6- and 7-substituted-2-arylpyrazolo[4,3-c]quinolin-3-ones was synthesized and tested in vitro for binding with the benzodiazepine receptor in competition with [3H]flunitrazepam. Electronic parameters (molecular electrostatic potential (MEP), charge distribution on the nitrogen atoms, dipole moment mu, and ionization potential (IP)) were calculated for the compounds by semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods. Lipophilicity of the compounds, expressed as logarithm of the octanol-water partition coefficient (log P), was calculated by the program Pallas. A quantitative correlation of the biological data with molecular parameters revealed a significant dependence (r = 0.95) of the activity on hydrophobic constants of the substituents, log P, and magnitude of the MEP minimum associated with the carbonyl oxygen atom.", 
    "102": "In the operating room, anaesthetist must provide unconsciousness, analgesia and muscular relaxation. In intensive therapy (IT), the rules are different and not every patient requires sedation, but almost every patient needs analgesia. The patient who is alert, calm and comfortable despite the presence of tubes and cannulas in the nose, mouth, radial artery, central vein, urethra, surgical wounds, pleural space etc. does not need any sedation. However, sedation and analgesia are clinically inseparable. If mechanical ventilation is not well controlled, muscular relaxants must be prescribed. There are a lot of trials in formulating an ideal sedative/analgesic regimen for each individual patient.", 
    "103": "It is not rare that IT patients are oversedated or undersedated. Undersedation is followed by anxiety, pain, hypertension, tachycardia. The most important effect of oversedation is respiratory depression, hypotension, bradycardia, CNS depression, renal dysfunction, immunological depression.", 
    "104": "Benzodiazepines are among the most widely used drugs in IT. They have sedative, hypnotic, anxyolytic, amnestic, anticonvulsant and myorelaxant effects. Prolonged continuous infusion of benzodiazepines ought to be escaped because of prolonged sedation, accumulation and presence of pharmacologically active metabolites. They have proved to be safe, although they can depress ventilation. Since benzodiazepines are not analgesics, the combined use of an opioid and benzodiazepines is necessary. Many different benzodiazepines are available, but the agents most commonly used in critically ill are: midazolam, diazepam and lorazepam. Midazolam is the most extensively used.",

    "106": "Opioids have the main place in management of analgesia in IT, especially in patients on mechanical ventilation. In management of postoperative analgesia, epidural route has advantage because less drug is necessary and cardiovascular and respiratory effects are minimal. Morphine is a standard opioid to which all others are compared. Intravenous bolus dose is 1-5 mg (0.1-0.15 mg/kg) or continuous infusion 2-15 mg/h. Hypotensive effect is caused by direct vasodilation and relief of histamine. Morphine has long elimination half-time and there is a danger of acummulation after prolonged administration. Morphine metabolites are pharmacologically active and renally eliminated. Prolonged i.v. infusion needs careful titration because of tolerance. Pethidine is less potent than morphine, usually given as a bolus dose (10 mg) or a continuous i.v. infusion (10-20 mg/h). Other opioid agents used in IT are: fentanil, alfentanil, sufentanil. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID-s) are: aspirin, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, diclofenac, ketorolac. NSAID-s may have an opioid sparing effect and be of particular benefit for the relief of pain from bones and joints. They interfere with the metabolism at the site of the sensory nerve terminals. Several chemicals are released locally in response to tissue injury. Arachidonic acid is produced from damaged cell membranes. One series reactions is mediated by the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase (COX) and results in the formation of prostaglandins, prostacyclins and thromboxane. The cyclo-oxygenase pathway is inhibited by NSAID-s. These analgesics, besides peripherally, also work centrally by mechanisms which are not in connection with COX inhibition.",

    "108": "When measuring fentanyl and midazolam simultaneously in the same plasma sample with standard high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet (HPLC-UV) detection, overlap of the fentanyl peak by the midazolam peak occurs, which makes fentanyl determination impossible. We tested the hypothesis that by acidifying the methanol mobile phase with 0.02% perchloric acid, 70%, it would be possible to separate both peaks. The UV detector was set at 200 nm. Calibration curves for fentanyl (range 0-2000 pg/ml) and midazolam (range 0-400 ng/ml) were linear (r>0.99). The detection limits were 200 pg/ml (fentanyl) and 10 ng/ml (midazolam). Precision and accuracy for intra- and inter-assay variability as well as in-line validation with quality control samples (QCS) were acceptable (<15 and 20%, respectively), except for fentanyl QCS of 200 pg/ml (17.8% precision). Although less sensitive than gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), reliable measurements of fentanyl, simultaneously with midazolam, can be performed with this HPLC-UV system.", 
    "109": "The serotonin3 (5-HT3) receptor plays an important role in the aminoprivic feeding model. Other neurochemical systems, including cholecystokinin (CCK) and dopamine (DA), are known to affect food intake. We pretreated rats systemically with tropisetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, alone and combined with antagonists of DA1 and DA2 receptors, and measured intake of an amino acid-imbalanced diet (IMB). As expected, tropisetron significantly increased intake of IMB. SCH-23390, a DA1 antagonist, increased IMB anorexia. When combined with tropisetron, DA2 antagonism with eticlopride reduced short-term intake of both the basal diet (BAS) and IMB. In the IMB model, specificity of 5-HT3-DA2 interactions, and of 5-HT3-CCK(A) interactions from previous studies, prompted investigation of CCK(A)-DA2 interactions; there appeared to be none. SKF-38393, a DA1 agonist, combined with the CCK(A) receptor antagonist, devazepide, increased BAS and tended to increase IMB intake. Thus, CCK(A)-DA1 interactions were not specific for IMB. These data suggest that DA1 receptor activity opposes IMB anorexia, possibly via an interaction with the 5-HT3 receptor.", 
    "110": "Serotonin3 (5-HT3) receptors in the periphery mediate anorectic responses to the amino acid deficiency, which occurs after eating amino acid-imbalanced diets (IMB). However, other neurochemical systems, notably cholecystokinin (CCK), are known to affect food intake. We pretreated rats systemically with tropisetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, alone and combined with antagonists of CCK(A) and CCK(B) receptors, and measured intake of an IMB. Devazepide, a CCK(A) receptor antagonist, appeared to interact with tropisetron in the anorectic responses to IMB, blunting the usual remediation of IMB anorexia by tropisetron. The CCK(B) receptor antagonist, L-365, 260, increased intake of both IMB and an amino acid-balanced basal diet (BAS) and did not interact with tropisetron. Our data suggest that activation of CCK(A) receptors is interactive with 5-HT3 receptor activity in mediating IMB anorexia in the aminoprivic feeding model.", 
    "111": "We have shown that the inferior colliculus is involved in the integration of defensive reactions. Electrical and chemical stimulation of this structure elicits fear and escape behavior, expressed respectively by immobility (freezing) and wild running, followed by jumps. In this study, we analyzed whether the defensive behavior integrated at this level of the midbrain tectum is also followed by antinociception and its chemical mediation. In addition, we further addressed whether or not the aversive states and the stress-induced analgesia share the same neural substrates in the inferior colliculus. To this end, animals chronically implanted with a chemitrode, an electrode glued to a guide cannula, in the inferior colliculus were injected with naltrexone, methysergide, ketanserin, and midazolam. The animals were submitted to gradual increases in the electrical stimulation of the inferior colliculus, which allowed the measurement of the thresholds for aversive responses--vigilance, freezing, and escape. Following the induction of the aversive behavioral responses the animals were submitted to the tail-flick test. The results obtained show that midazolam was the only treatment that changed the aversive thresholds. On the other hand, while naltrexone and midazolam did not affect the fear-induced analgesia, it was inhibited by microinjections of the serotonergic blockers, methysergide and ketanserin. These results emphasize previous data demonstrating the nonopioid nature of the unconditioned analgesia to brain-aversive stimulation. Because methysergide is a nonspecific antagonist of 5-HT receptors, and ketanserin acts with a high degree of specificity at 5-HT2/5-HT1C receptors, the present results suggest that activation of 5-HT2/5-HT1C receptors may be implicated in the antinociception induced by stimulation of the inferior colliculus. Moreover, the present data also indicate that aversive reactions and analgesia from inferior colliculus stimulation can be pharmacologically dissociated.", 
    "112": "Many abused substances have been found to possess anxiogenic-like or/and anxiolytic-like properties. Discrepancies about the effects of MDMA, one of the most popular recreational drugs in recent years, on anxiety have been seen in the literature, and almost all of the data in this respect were derived from retrospective studies. The present study was thus designed to examine the drug's actions by using an animal model of anxiety, the elevated plus-maze test in male mice. Intraperitoneal MDMA at 1 mg/kg was ineffective, at 4 mg/kg decreased the percent of open arm entries (p < 0.01), and increased enclosed entries (p < 0.05), at 12 mg/kg had no significant effect, and at 20 mg/kg induced an increase of percent of open time (p < 0.01). As control drugs, amphetamine (0.5-4 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a dose-dependent, anxiogenic-like effect and diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.) induced an anxiolytic-like effect in the test. The results indicate that MDMA has anxiogenic-like properties at lower doses and anxiolytic-like at higher doses. The effects of MDMA and amphetamine on the mouse's responses to the plus-maze are compared. These findings provide a possible explanation for the controversies over MDMA's effects on anxiety in the literature.", 
    "113": "DMP 406 is an atypical antipsychotic, antischizophrenic drug, biochemically related to clozapine, which exerts its desired pharmacologic effects through selective antagonism of 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine-receptor subtypes. Clozapine therapy is clinically associated with severe granulocytopenia in a small subset of patients. In the course of a 3-month toxicity study in dogs, severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, marked myeloid and erythroid left-shifted bone marrow hyperplasia with increased erythrophagocytosis, positive Coombs' tests, and hypergammaglobulinemia occurred in individual females dosed with 30 mg/kg/day of DMP 406. Related but less severe changes were also observed in males. Sera or purified immunoglobulins from affected and control dogs were tested in methylcellulose-based, canine hematopoietic colony-forming unit (CFU) assays with or without DMP 406. Neither size nor number of erythroid or myeloid CFUs differed between cultures containing control or affected dog serum components. Sera from individual affected dogs but not controls resulted in moderate numbers of fibroblast-like CFUs, suggesting DMP 406-associated marrow stromal cell-modifying, serum activities to be present. DMP 406 alone resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction of erythroid and myeloid CFUs with an approximate IC50 of 3.0 microg/mL. Taken together, DMP 406-induced granulocytopenia and bone marrow dyscrasia appear likely to result from both immune-mediated and direct drug-induced myelotoxicity.", 
    "114": "Excitotoxicity resulting from the dysfunction of glutamate receptors has been attributed to neurodegeneration seen in many brain disorders. In our laboratory, the spastic Han Wistar mutant is currently utilized as a potential model of excitotoxicity. The mutant is characterized by progressive neuronal degeneration, hindlimb paresis and ataxia which culminates in the animal's death at approximately 65 days of age. In this study, neuroprotection derived from acute administration of the non-NMDA antagonist GYKI 52466, and chronic administration of the non-NMDA antagonist CNQX was examined in order to determine the potential roles of non-NMDA receptors in the observed neurodegeneration. Mutants injected with GYKI 52466 (15 mg/kg), twice a week for 3 weeks, exhibited increased life spans (14%) and extended motor activity than their vehicle-treated mutant siblings. In a separate group of mutants, CNQX (either 50 or 500 microM) was infused directly into the third ventricle of the mutant's brain utilizing osmotic pumps. A statistically significant increase in motor activity (22%) was detected for mutants treated with a dose of 50 microM CNQX compared to their vehicle-treated siblings. Finally, cerebellar histological evaluations of mutants treated with both 50 and 500 microM CNQX showed dose-dependent higher cerebellar Purkinje cell counts.

The preoperative visual analogue scale anxiety scores were similar in all three groups. In the operating room, however, anxiety scores were 55% and 68% lower after midazolam (21+/-19) and diazepam emulsion (15+/-14) compared with saline (46+/-28).

Pirenzepine was found to cause a significant increase in the R-R interval from 903+/-112 to 956+/-129 ms in the control group (P<0.0001) and from 927+/-141 to 958+/-168 ms in patients with chronic heart failure (P<0.01). Pirenzepine also increased HF significantly from 4.29+/-0.32 to 5.16+/-0.38 ln ms2 in the control group (P<0.0001) and from 4.04+/-0.16 to 4.48+/-0.24 ln ms2 in the chronic heart failure group (P<0.05). Pirenzepine did not significantly alter the LF/HF ratio in either group.

    "133": "Prominent theories of implicit memory claim that perceptual processes play a central role in implicit memory. The modality-match effect, the finding that priming is greater when the modality of stimulus presentation matches at study and test, provides the central evidence for these approaches. In this paper we use the benzodiazepine, midazolam, to explore the nature of the modality-match effect in implicit memory. We compared the modality-match effect in a midazolam and a saline (i.e., a placebo) condition. Our experimental results demonstrate that the modality-match effect is diminished substantially in a midazolam condition even though components of priming are preserved. Given the empirically-validated assumption that midazolam minimizes explicit memory, these results suggest that there exist components of implicit memory that are not mediated by perceptual processes and raise questions about the generality of prominent theories of implicit memory.",

Thereafter, patients with a nasojejunal tube who were likely to require a minimum of three additional days of continuous sedation were transitioned from intravenous midazolam to enterally administered lorazepam. The goal in transitioning therapy was to titrate the lorazepam dose and reduce midazolam administration while maintaining an unchanged level of sedation.",

Midazolam was successfully discontinued in 24 (80%) patients in 3 days (median), and adequate and appropriate sedation was maintained with lorazepam monotherapy. Six patients in whom midazolam could not be discontinued experienced a 52% reduction in the rate of midazolam administration as a result of adding lorazepam. Total projected midazolam utilization was defined as the sum of midazolam administration before initiating lorazepam and the projected midazolam requirement after initiating lorazepam. Projected midazolam cost was calculated as the product of total projected midazolam utilization and midazolam acquisition cost. Actual expenditures for both midazolam and lorazepam were subtracted from the projected midazolam cost to calculate the estimated cost savings. Overall, midazolam utilization (in milligrams) was reduced by 46.7+/-27.6% (median 52). Total projected midazolam cost for the 30 patients was $90,771. The actual cost of midazolam and lorazepam combined was $47,867, resulting in a cost savings of $42,904.",

    "141": "The effect of intra-cerebrally infused compounds in animal models of anxiety were reviewed. A large body of evidence suggested that benzodiazepine agonists in different brain regions--including areas of the raphe, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, septum, hippocampus, and amygdala--produce reasonably consistent anxiolytic effects in a variety of animal models. However, evidence regarding the effects on anxiety of 5-HT1A agonists, 5-HT2 compounds, and 5-HT3 antagonists was somewhat less extensive, both anatomically and behaviourally, and more complex. For example, establishing receptor specificity for 5-HT ligand effects was often complicated by the lack of 'silent' and/or selective antagonists. Neuropeptides had significant effects on anxiety, but these were shown in a smaller number of animal models and in a limited number of brain regions. Regardless of the compounds tested, however, there seemed to be a surprising number of double dissociations (brain site by behavioural test). In fact in some instances, different fear reactions appeared to be controlled by distinct receptor subpopulations within particular parts of the limbic system. These results suggest that the neural control of anxiety might be analogous in organization to sensorimotor systems, i.e., anxiety is controlled by complex systems of multiple, distributed, parallel pathways.", 
    "142": "Weak field electric fish respond to alerting stimuli with a transient increase in the frequency of electric organ discharge (novelty response). In an attempt to demonstrate the influence of different degrees of alertness and of emotionality on the novelty response of Gymnotus carapo, we studied the variations in the magnitude of this response induced by the application of an electric stimulus to the water of the experimental box using a pair of electrodes, before and after intramuscular injections of d-amphetamine (1-2 and 4 mg/kg), sodium pentobarbital (10-20 and 30 mg/kg), diazepam (1-2 and 4 mg/kg), beta-carboline (2 mg/kg), and saline. After d-amphetamine injection the animal presented increased somatic motility but no changes in electric organ baseline firing rate or in response to the alerting electric stimulus. Sodium pentobarbital induced a partial loss of posture and a reduction of fin and operculum movements, as well as a reduction of baseline firing rate and of the response to the alerting electric stimulus, with frequent interruptions in electric organ firing. Beta-carboline caused increased motility, but no changes in basal firing rate or in response to the alerting stimulus. Diazepan-injected fishes remained still throughout the experiment, and some of those threated with the higher dose (4 mg/kg) presented interruptions on electric organ discharges in response to stimulation but no change on baseline firing rate. The data suggest that a reduction of the degree of alertness by the barbiturate and a decrease in emotionality and/or stress by the benzodiazepine interfere with the novelty response. The possible site of action of the drugs is discussed.", 
    "143": "We report a case of dystonia with a partial deletion of the short arm (p) of chromosome 18 and androgen insensitivity. Neurologic findings in the 18p syndrome are reported to include mental retardation, seizures, incoordination, tremor, and chorea. A 15-year-old girl with a denovo 18p deletion [karyotype 46, XY, del (18)(p11.1)] developed progressive asymmetric dystonia. She had oromotor apraxia and partial expressive aphasia since childhood, and she was able to partially communicate through elementary sign language. At the age of 15 years, she developed subacute and progressive choreic movements of the right arm, severe dystonic posturing of the left arm, and spastic dystonia in both legs. Her response to parenteral or oral benzodiazepines, oral trihexyphenidyl, benztropine mesylate, baclofen, and L-dopa were brief and inadequate. The response to intrathecal baclofen has been sustained over 18 months. In all likelihood, the 18p deletion syndrome affecting this patient is significant in the pathogenesis of her acquired dystonia. Chronic intrathecal baclofen therapy via pump has been effective in this case and should be considered as a treatment modality in carefully selected patients with dystonia.", 
    "144": "Activity of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), the most abundant human P450 isoform and responsible for metabolizing approximately half of all therapeutic agents, has been speculated to vary during the menstrual cycle. This investigation evaluated CYP3A4 activity during the menstrual cycle, using midazolam clearance as a metabolic probe. Midazolam (1 mg i.v.) was administered to nonsmoking, nonpregnant female volunteers (N = 11, age 26 +/- 5 years) with normal menstrual cycles on three separate occasions during the same cycle: days 2 (menstrual phase), 13 (estradiol peak), and 21 (progesterone peak). Venous plasma midazolam concentrations were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Midazolam clearance was determined by noncompartmental and compartmental analysis. Midazolam plasma disposition did not differ between phases of the menstrual cycle. There was no significant difference in any measure of midazolam clearance. Noncompartmental clearances (mean +/- SD) were 7.36 +/- 2.73, 6.34 +/- 3.59, and 6.23 +/- 2.04 ml/kg/min, respectively, on days 2, 13, and 21 of the menstrual cycle. These results suggest no difference in hepatic CYP3A4 activity on menstrual cycle days 2, 13, and 21. Consideration of menstrual cycle variability in the metabolism of CYP3A4 substrates does not appear indicated in the dosing or design of clinical trials.", 
    "145": "This study assessed whether the previously reported difference in tirilazad clearance between pre- and postmenopausal women is reversed by hormone replacement and whether this observation can be explained by differences in CYP3A4 activity. Ten healthy women from each group were enrolled: premenopausal (ages 18-35), postmenopausal (ages 50-70), postmenopausal receiving estrogen, and postmenopausal women receiving estrogen and progestin. Volunteers received 0.0145 mg/kg midazolam and 3.0 mg/kg tirilazad mesylate intravenously on separate days. Plasma tirilazad and midazolam were measured by HPLC/dual mass spectrophotometry (MS/MS) assays. Tirilazad clearance was significantly higher in premenopausal women (0.51 +/- 0.09 L/hr/kg) than in postmenopausal groups (0.34 +/- 0.07, 0.32 +/- 0.06, and 0.36 +/- 0.08 L/hr/kg, respectively) (p = 0.0001). Midazolam clearance (0.64 +/- 0.12 L/hr/kg) was significantly higher in premenopausal women compared to postmenopausal groups (0.47 +/- 0.11, 0.49 +/- 0.11, and 0.53 +/- 0.19 L/hr/kg, respectively) (p = 0.037). Tirilazad clearance was weakly correlated with midazolam clearance (r2 = 0.129, p = 0.02). Tirilazad clearance is faster in premenopausal women than in postmenopausal women, but the effect of menopause on clearance is not reversed by hormone replacement. Tirilazad clearance in these women is weakly related to midazolam clearance, a marker of CYP3A activity.", 
    "146": "We have ranked 13 different TIBO derivatives with respect to their relative free energies of binding using two approximate computational methods: adaptive chemical Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics (CMC/MD) and Poisson-Boltzmann/solvent accessibility (PB/SA) calculations. Eight of these derivatives have experimentally determined binding affinities. The remaining new derivatives were constructed based on contour maps around R86183 (8Cl-TIBO), generated with the program PROFEC (pictorial representation of free energy changes). The rank order among the derivatives with known binding affinity was in good agreement with experimental results for both methods, with average errors in the binding free energies of 1. 0 kcal/mol for CMC/MD and 1.3 kcal/mol for the PB/SA method. With both methods, we found that one of the new derivatives was predicted to bind 1-2 kcal/mol better than R86183, which is the hitherto most tightly binding derivative. This result was subsequently supported by the most rigorous free energy computational methods: free energy perturbation (FEP) and thermodynamic integration (TI). The strategy we have used here should be generally useful in structure-based drug optimization. An initial ligand is derivatized based on PROFEC suggestions, and the derivatives are ranked with CMC/MD and PB/SA to identify promising compounds. Since these two methods rely on different sets of approximations, they serve as a good complement to each other. Predictions of the improved affinity can be reinforced with FEP or TI and the best compounds synthesized and tested. Such a computational strategy would allow many different derivatives to be tested in a reasonable time, focusing synthetic efforts on the most promising modifications.",

    "151": "Ethanol exerts its behavioral effects largely by interacting with receptors to brain neurotransmitters. The molecular mechanisms involving these interactions are still not well known since an ideal model for their study is currently unavailable. In addition, responses to alcohol may vary due to factors such as genetic predisposition, ethanol concentration consumed, and stimuli such as stress, socialization, etc. The chronic consumption of alcohol, similar to that of other drugs such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates, is linked to GABAergic neurotransmission. GABA is the predominant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. In a context of substance abuse, these three drugs first cause a gratifying effect, later tolerance and finally, physical and psychological dependence. If consumption is interrupted abruptly, a withdrawal syndrome occurs. The Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome (AWS) is a state of hyperexcitability characterized by anxiety, fear, muscular rigidity and tonic-clonic seizures with epileptiform-type characteristics. The epileptic seizures seen during AWS are often similar to those seen in experimental epilepsy models such as \"kindling\" or GABA Withdrawal Syndrome (GWS) models. A possible correlation between these models and AWS will allow for a better understanding of the cellular and molecular effects that alcohol exerts on the brain.", 
    "152": "Agitation is one of the diagnostic features of catatonia in the DSM IV classification, but permanent forms of agitated catatonia have occasionally been described. We report the case of a 43-year-old man who had already suffered from undifferentiated schizophrenia for 7 years, and in whom we diagnosed agitated catatonia. While our patient was being treated with a neuroleptic during a second episode of paranoia, a state of agitation was observed which persisted for a further 8 months. During this period, he was treated with several different neuroleptics and benzodiazepines, either alone or in association, without any improvement. No organic cause was found. He was then transferred to our electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) unit, with a diagnosis of schizophrenic agitation resistant to drug therapy. ECT was begun, and he was only given droperidol in case of agitation and alimemazine for insomnia, neither of which had any effect. In view of his persistent agitation without any purpose, echolalia and echopraxia, stereotyped movements with mannerisms and marked mimicking and grimacing, we diagnosed him as having agitated catatonia. After the fourth session of ECT, we decided to stop all treatment and gave him lorazepam at a dose of 12.5 mg daily. Twenty-four hours later, all symptoms of agitation had disappeared. In our opinion, permanent catatonic agitation is not rare. In our case, the neuroleptic treatment maintained and may even have worsened the symptomatology. Lorazepam can be used as a therapeutic test for this type of agitation, especially if it does not respond to neuroleptics. This also allows the patient to be sedated rapidly and effectively, thus preventing him from injuring himself further.", 
    "153": "A retrospective survey on drug prescription over a one-year period (1989) in 1083 patients (48.3% of whom were male) hospitalized in a psychiatric university hospital in Switzerland and a 35-day prospective study (1992) on the prescription of \"as needed\" (prn) medication in a closed and an open ward were carried out. Their aim was to establish a basis for a monitoring of prescription habits and for pharmacoeconomic considerations. In the retrospective study, 48.3% of the patients were male. The mean duration of hospitalization of the patients was 47.0 +/- 68.1 days (mean +/- s.d.). Only 11 out of the 1083 patients (1%) were without psychotropic medication. The mean (+/- SD) number of drugs/day the patients were prescribed was 4.6 +/- 2.8, including 3.2 +/- 1.7 psychotropic drugs. Patients suffering from schizophrenia (67 d) or from unipolar depression (67.4 d) were hospitalized for the longest periods. Antipsychotics (67.5% of the patients) were the most frequently prescribed psychotropic drugs, followed by anxiolytics (42.2%), antidepressants (28.3%), hypnotics (31.4%) and mood stabilizers (7.1%). Antiparkinsonian agents accounted for 4.6% of all prescriptions. Levomepromazine, haloperidol (30.9% of all patients) and clotiapine were the most often prescribed neuroleptics, and clozapine was administered to only 6.4% of all patients. Among the antidepressants, maprotiline (11.9% of all patients) was more frequently prescribed than the classical tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline, while the only available SSRI fluvoxamine and MAO inhibitors were rarely used. The most frequently prescribed anxiolytics were clorazepate (28.2% of all patients), lorazepam, bromazepam, and prazepam. Among the hypnotic drugs, chloral hydrate (11.5%) was more frequently administered than the first-ranking benzodiazepine flunitrazepam (7.8%). In the prospective study, 97% and 77% of the patients (n = 55) of the closed (n = 29) and of the open ward, respectively, were prescribed \"as needed\" (prn) drugs. However, only 71 and 80%, respectively, of these patients finally received the drug. The frequency of prescription was 34.9% for neuroleptics, 15.1% for anxiolytic drugs, 8.2% for non-benzodiazepine hypnotics and only 2.1% for benzodiazepine hypnotics. The most frequently prescribed neuroleptic drug was clotiapine (18% of all patients), but finally, only 29% of the prescribed doses were administered. Studies of this type are biased by the fact that local habits of prescription do not allow generalisation of the findings. Such surveys should be carried out more frequently and simultaneously in different centers. Critical comparisons could help to optimize treatment."
