In this study we compared the efficacy of auricular acupuncture with intranasal midazolam, placebo acupuncture, and no treatment for reducing dental anxiety. Patients having dental extractions (n = 67) were randomized to (i) auricular acupuncture, (ii) placebo acupuncture, and (iii) intranasal midazolam and compared with a no treatment group. Anxiety was assessed before the interventions, at 30 min, and after the dental extraction. Physiological variables were assessed continuously. With the no treatment group as control, the auricular acupuncture group, and the midazolam group were significantly less anxious at 30 min as compared with patients in the placebo acupuncture group (Spielberger Stait-Trait Anxiety Inventory X1, P = 0.012 and <0.001, respectively). In addition, patient compliance assessed by the dentist was significantly improved if auricular acupuncture or application of intranasal midazolam had been performed (P = 0.032 and 0.049, respectively). In conclusion, both, auricular acupuncture and intranasal midazolam were similarly effective for the treatment of dental anxiety.",

There was no explicit intraoperative recall in both groups. Patients in Group BIS 40 received significantly (P<0.05) more sufentanil than the BIS 50 group (704+/-181 microg vs. 490+/-107 microg, respectively) and midazolam (18.5+/-6.1 mg vs. 15.6+/-3.8 mg, respectively).

    "9": "In vitro electrophysiological studies have shown that second-generation antipsychotic drugs risperidone and olanzapine inhibit rapidly activating delayed rectifier K(+) currents and prolong action potential duration of the isolated ventricular myocardium. In this study, we analyzed in vivo cardiohemodynamic and electrophysiological profiles of risperidone and olanzapine using the halothane-anesthetized canine model to clarify their proarrhythmic potential. A clinically relevant dose of risperidone (0.03 mg/kg, i.v.) did not affect the ventricular repolarization process, whereas the supra-therapeutic doses (0.3 and 3 mg/kg, i.v.) prolonged the duration of monophasic action potential of the ventricle. Furthermore, the terminal repolarization period, an index of extent of electrical vulnerability, was prolonged after the supra-therapeutic doses. In contrast, therapeutic to supra-therapeutic doses of olanzapine (0.03-3 mg/kg, i.v.) hardly affected the ventricular repolarization process. Therefore, more caution has to be paid on the use of risperidone than olanzapine for patients with risks of the elevated plasma concentration.",

    "14": "The prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) has improved significantly with the introduction of the 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists combined with dexamethasone. Most studies have reported on patients undergoing single-day highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. There have been fewer studies and much less success in preventing CINV in patients undergoing multiple-day chemotherapy or high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant. Current practice guidelines suggest the use of a first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone daily for each day of the multiple-day chemotherapy regimens. This practice seems to control acute CINV, but delayed CINV remains poorly controlled with a complete response (e.g., no emesis, no rescue) of less than 50% in most studies. Three new agents-palonosetron, aprepitant, and olanzapine-have shown high efficacy in preventing acute and delayed CINV in patients undergoing single-day chemotherapy. These agents have high potential for preventing CINV in patients undergoing multiple-day chemotherapy. This article proposes recommendations for their use in clinical trials and in practice.",

About half of FPA patients showed an aggressive behavior as defined by a Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS) score greater than 0 Vs 46% of non-FPA patients (p = 0.3651). The most common was verbal aggression, while about 20% of FPA patients actually engaged in physical aggression against other people. 74% of FPA patients had no diagnosis at admission, while 40% had received a previous psychopharmacological treatment, mainly benzodiazepines and antidepressants. During SPDC stay, diagnosis was established in 96% of FPA patients and a pharmacological therapy was prescribed to 95% of them, mainly benzodiazepines, antipsychotics and mood stabilizers.", 
    "18": "Subjects presenting at their first psychiatric ward admission have often not undergone previous adequate psychiatric assessment and diagnostic procedures. The first hospital admission allows diagnosis and psychopharmacological treatment to be established. In our population, aggressive behaviors were rather frequent, although most commonly verbal.

    "19": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a medical emergency which can lead to significant morbidity and mortality and requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. SE is differentiated into generalized or partial SE on the basis of its electro-clinical manifestations. The guidelines for the management of SE produced by the Italian League against Epilepsy also distinguish three different stages of SE (initial, established and refractory), based on time elapsed since the onset of the condition and responsiveness to previously administered drugs. Treatment should be started as soon as possible, particularly in generalized convulsive SE, and should include general support measures, drugs to suppress epileptic activity and, whenever possible, treatments aimed at relieving the underlying (causative) condition. Benzodiazepines are the first line antiepileptic agents, and i.v. lorazepam is generally preferred because it is associated with a lower risk of early relapses. If benzodiazepines fail to control seizures, i.v. phenytoin is usually indicated, though i.v. phenobarbital or i.v. valproate may also be considered. Refractory SE requires admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) to allow adequate monitoring and support of respiratory, metabolic and hemodynamic functions and cerebral electrical activity. In refractory SE, general anesthesia may be required. Propofol and thiopental represent first line agents in this setting, after careful assessment of potential risks and benefits.", 
    "20": "Previous studies have observed significant abnormalities in the fatty acid composition of peripheral tissues from drug-na\u00efve first-episode schizophrenic (SZ) patients relative to normal controls, including deficits in omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are partially normalized following chronic antipsychotic treatment. We hypothesized that postmortem cortical tissue from patients with SZ would also exhibit deficits in cortical docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) and arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4n-6) relative to normal controls, and that these deficits would be greater in drug-free SZ patients. We determined the total fatty acid composition of postmortem orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (Brodmann area 10) from drug-free and antipsychotic-treated SZ patients (n=21) and age-matched normal controls (n=26) by gas chromatography. After correction for multiple comparisons, significantly lower DHA (-20%) concentrations, and significantly greater vaccenic acid (VA) (+12.5) concentrations, were found in the OFC of SZ patients relative to normal controls. Relative to age-matched same-gender controls, OFC DHA deficits, and elevated AA:DHA, oleic acid:DHA and docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-6):DHA ratios, were found in male but not female SZ patients. SZ patients that died of cardiovascular-related disease exhibited lower DHA (-31%) and AA (-19%) concentrations, and greater OA (+20%) and VA (+17%) concentrations, relative to normal controls that also died of cardiovascular-related disease. OFC DHA and AA deficits, and elevations in oleic acid and vaccenic acid, were numerically greater in drug-free SZ patients and were partially normalized in SZ patients treated with antipsychotic medications (atypical>typical). Fatty acid abnormalities could not be wholly attributed to lifestyle or postmortem tissue variables. These findings add to a growing body of evidence implicating omega-3 fatty acid deficiency as well as the OFC in the pathoaetiology of SZ, and suggest that abnormalities in OFC fatty acid composition may be gender-specific and partially normalized by antipsychotic medications.", 
    "21": "The psychotomimetic drug, phencyclidine, induces schizophrenia-like behavioural changes in both humans and animals. Phencyclidine-induced disruption of sensory motor gating mechanisms, as assessed by prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle, is widely used in research animals as a screening model for antipsychotic properties in general and may predict effects on negative and cognitive deficits in particular. Dopamine (DA) stabilizers comprise a new generation of antipsychotics characterized by a partial DA receptor agonist or antagonist action and have been suggested to have a more favourable clinical profile.", 
    "22": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of first, second and third generation antipsychotics to interfere with the disruptive effect of phencyclidine on prepulse inhibition in mice.", 
    "23": "Aripiprazole blocked the phencyclidine-induced disruption of prepulse inhibition. The atypical antipsychotic clozapine was less effective, whereas olanzapine, and the typical antipsychotic haloperidol, failed to alter the effects of phencyclidine on prepulse inhibition.", 
    "24": "The somewhat superior efficacy of clozapine compared to haloperidol may be explained by its lower affinity and faster dissociation rate for DA D2 receptors possibly combined with an interaction with other receptor systems. Aripiprazole was found to be more effective than clozapine or olanzapine, which may be explained by a partial agonist activity of aripiprazole at DA D2 receptors. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that partial DA agonism leading to DA stabilizing properties may have favourable effects on sensorimotor gating and thus tentatively on cognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia.", 
    "25": "After neurosurgery patients often need to be sedated and ventilated in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, rapid postoperative recovery and neurological examination are particularly important for the early recognition of complications. In this retrospective study two different strategies of anaesthesia technique and ICU sedation (fentanyl-midazolam versus remifentanil-propofol) were compared.",

After arrival in the ICU fentanyl (0.03-0.2 mg/h) and midazolam (2-12 mg/h) or remifentanil (0.1-0.2 microg/kg body weight/min) and propofol (0.5-3 mg/kg body weight/h) were infused to reach a Ramsay score of 4. The times between termination of infusion and extubation and the length of stay in the ICU were examined.", 
    "27": "A total of 60 patients (n=30 each group) undergoing supratentorial brain tumour surgery were enrolled. The groups were comparable for age, weight, ASA status (American Society of Anesthesiologists) and duration of drug administration (remifentanil-propofol 528+/-382 min versus fentanyl-midazolam 548+/-360 min). Extubation times were significantly shorter after remifentanil-propofol (47 min) than after fentanyl-midazolam (481 min), and the length of stay in the ICU was also significantly reduced (1.8 days versus 3.7 days). As a result of prolonged unconsciousness and impaired neurological assessability, a brain CT scan was necessary in 3 patients after fentanyl-midazolam to exclude neurosurgical complications.", 
    "28": "This retrospective study demonstrates that remifentanil-propofol anaesthesia and ICU sedation are superior to the combination of fentanyl and midazolam in terms of ventilation time and length of ICU stay. Moreover, the use of fentanyl-midazolam may lead to unnecessary CT scans.", 
    "29": "The recent availability of activators of the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter allows direct testing of the influence of mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake on the overall Ca(2+) homeostasis of the cell. We show here that activation of mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake by 4,4',4''-(4-propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl)trisphenol (PPT) or kaempferol stimulates histamine-induced Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and that this effect is enhanced if the mitochondrial Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger is simultaneously inhibited with CGP37157. This suggests that both Ca(2+) uptake and release from mitochondria control the ability of local Ca(2+) microdomains to produce feedback inhibition of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP(3)Rs). In addition, the ability of mitochondria to control Ca(2+) release from the ER allows them to modulate cytosolic Ca(2+) oscillations. In histamine stimulated HeLa cells and human fibroblasts, both PPT and kaempferol initially stimulated and later inhibited oscillations, although kaempferol usually induced a more prolonged period of stimulation. Both compounds were also able to induce the generation of Ca(2+) oscillations in previously silent fibroblasts. Our data suggest that cytosolic Ca(2+) oscillations are exquisitely sensitive to the rates of mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake and release, which precisely control the size of the local Ca(2+) microdomains around InsP(3)Rs and thus the ability to produce feedback activation or inhibition of Ca(2+) release.", 
    "30": "Portugal has one of the highest levels of benzodiazepine's utilization at European level. This issue was highlighted on the latest International Narcotics Control Board report, which advises Portugal to analyse the actual procedures on prescription and utilization of these drugs. This study aimed to analyse Portuguese benzodiazepine's utilization patterns and trends at regional and national level, and analyse its relation with factors known to affect the utilization of these drugs.", 
    "31": "Drug utilization data refers to the drugs prescribed and dispensed in the ambulatory to the population covered by the National Health Service, from 1st January 1999 to 31st December 2003. Data was expressed in Defined Daily Dose (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day (DHD).", 
    "32": "In the Portuguese National Health Service during the period in study there was a decrease of 1.2% on benzodiazepine's utilization. Nevertheless, it was observed an increase on anxyolitics benzodiazepine's utilization (3.8%;72.66 DHD), although hypnotics benzodiazepine's suffered a marked decrease (-21.9%;13.15 DHD). The expenditure has not followed the utilization's trend, and in the period in study the retail sale price expenditure increased 12%. Anxyolitic benzodiazepine's utilization accounted for 85% of the growth on expenditure observed in this study. At national level there were some asymmetries either on utilization's level or on drug utilization's pattern. In 2003, Faro, Bragan\u00e7a and Viana do Castelo were the sub-regions with the lowest utilization level and Portalegre and Evora the ones with the highest levels. Lisbon presented the highest decrease either on percentual (-13.8%) or on absolute (-13.45 DHD) values.", 
    "33": "Benzodiazepine's utilization in Portugal was considered of concern by International Narcotics Control Board. Therefore the stabilization on utilization, with even a small decrease, should be considered potentially positive. The asymmetries either on utilization's level or on drug utilization's pattern do not seem to be totally attributable to age-structure, unemployment levels or the percentage of retired people, as there wasn't a statistical significant relation between these variables. For this reason the variations on Benzodiazepine's utilization in Portugal seem to be attributed to a combination of different factors, which emphasize the need of more initiatives conducted to health care professionals and patients, in order to diminish the chronic use of these drugs.", 
    "34": "It is reported that the common psychiatric disorders among cancer patients are adjustment disorder, major depression, and delirium. Pharmacotherapy is often provided for management of these distressing symptoms. Antianxiety drugs, especially benzodiazepines, are often used for ameliorating adjustment disorder. Among them, shorter-acting benzodiazepines are usually preferred. Several randomized clinical trials indicate the efficacy of antidepressants for management of major depression experienced by cancer patients. Because there are no significant differences of effectiveness among available antidepressants, it is recommended that selection of antidepressant should depend on its adverse event profiles. Although the principal management strategies of delirium are detection and treatment of underlying causes of delirium, concurrent pharmacotherapy as symptomatic treatment is often needed. Neuroleptics, especially haloperidol, are most widely used for management of delirium.",

This paper reports the case of a patient who had chronic focal epilepsy, upbeat nystagmus and cerebellar ataxia, associated with a polyautoimmune response including anti-GAD antibodies. Both gait and nystagmus improved markedly after immunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroids and azathioprine. After the introduction of benzodiazepines, previously refractory seizures were completely controlled. Anti-GAD antibodies should be actively sought out in pharmacoresistant epilepsy, particularly if other neurological abnormalities are present. Combined treatment with immunosuppressants and gammahydroxybutyric acidergic agents may be highly effective.",

Withdrawal Seizure-Prone (WSP) mice were selectively bred for their susceptibility to handling-induced withdrawal convulsions following chronic treatment with ethanol. Reflecting pleiotropic genetic influences, they also experience more severe withdrawal from other sedative-hypnotics including the benzodiazepine, diazepam. We used this susceptible genotype to test whether other benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) agonists also produce physical dependence following acute administration, comparing studies of spontaneous withdrawal with those where convulsions were precipitated by a BZR antagonist (flumazenil). Separate groups of mice were tested following a single injection of one of eight BZR agonists. Several doses of each drug were tested for spontaneous withdrawal, and a single dose of each drug was tested for precipitated withdrawal. Withdrawal convulsions were seen after all of the drugs by at least one method, suggesting that BZR agonists as a class elicit acute physical dependence in this susceptible genotype.",

Fourteen patients with extensive WMLs, as determined by MRI, were divided into two groups - 7 with gait disturbance and 7 without it. Neuronal integrity was evaluated with a PET scan using [(11)C]flumazenil (FMZ) by calculating the distribution volume of FMZ (FMZ-V(d)) in various regions of interest by non-linear curve fitting. Additionally, tracer kinetic analysis was applied for voxel-by-voxel quantification of FMZ-V(d) and data analysis was performed using statistical parametric mapping. The striatal FMZ-V(d) values were inversely correlated with the motor UPDRS scores (r = 0.70, p < 0.005), and their reductions were associated with the presence of gait disturbance. Therefore, differences in neuronal integrity in the striatum may determine whether patients with WMLs develop VaP or not.",

A total of 50 adult patients (25 patients receiving dexmedetomidine and 25 patients receiving midazolam), 18 to 60 years of age, and rated I and II on the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification system were included. A brief questionnaire was used to collect demographic data; patients were asked to rate anxiety, satisfaction with care to date and expected discomfort on a visual analogue scale. The following parameters were measured continuously and recorded every minute: heart rate, mean arterial pressure, hemoglobin oxygen saturation and respiratory rate. The two groups were similar with regard to age, body mass index, sex, education, duration of endoscopy, and ethanol or tobacco use. After the procedure, full recovery time, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and hemoglobin oxygen saturation levels were similar in both groups. Both groups also had low levels of perceived procedural gagging, discomfort and anxiety scores (P > 0.05), and high satisfaction levels (90.1+/-3.0 for dexmedetomidine versus 84.9+/-4.5 for midazolam; P > 0.05). Retching and endoscopist satisfaction were significantly different in patients receiving dexmedetomidine versus those receiving midazolam (88.8+/-6.5 versus 73.5+/-16.4, P < 0.05; and 20.6+/-4.4 versus 45.2+/-6.0; P < 0.001). In the midazolam group, the number of patients who had adverse effects was higher than the dexmedetomidine group (P < 0.05). As a result, dexmedetomidine performed as effectively and safely as midazolam when used as a sedative in upper gastroscopy; it was superior to midazolam with regard to retching, rate of side effects and endoscopist satisfaction. It was concluded that dexmedetomidine may be a good alternative to midazolam to sedate patients for upper endoscopy.",

Twenty-six consecutive outpatients met the DSM-IV criteria for panic disorder and agoraphobia while taking SSRIs. Twenty remitted upon behavioural treatment. Antidepressant drugs were then tapered at the slowest possible pace and with appropriate patient education. Patients were assessed with the Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS) checklist 2 wk, 1 month and 1 yr after discontinuation. Nine of the 20 patients (45%) experienced a discontinuation syndrome, which subsided within a month in all but three patients who had been taking paroxetine for a long time. Discontinuation syndromes appeared to be fairly common even when performed with slow tapering and during clinical remission. In some cases disturbances persisted for months after discontinuation.",

We tested the hypothesis that pre-operative warming can reduce pre-operative anxiety as effectively as a conventional dose of intravenous midazolam in patients undergoing neurosurgery. We randomly allocated 80 patients to four groups in the pre-operative holding area. Treatment was applied for 30-45 min with (1) passive insulation and placebo; (2) passive insulation and intravenous midazolam (30 microg.kg-1); (3) warming with forced-air and placebo; and (4) warming with forced-air and intravenous midazolam (30 microg.kg-1). Thermal comfort levels (VAS 0-100 mm) and anxiety levels (VAS 0-100 mm, Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) were assessed twice: before the designated treatment was started and before induction of anaesthesia. In the midazolam and the midazolam/warming groups, anxiety VAS and Spielberger state anxiety scores decreased by -19 (95% CI: -29 to -9, p<0.01) and -10 (95% CI: -14 to -6, p<0.01), respectively. In the warming and the combined groups, thermal VAS increased by +26 (95% CI: 17-34, p<0.01). Pre-operative warming did not reduce anxiety VAS (p=0.11) or Spielberger state anxiety (p=0.19). The results of our study indicate that pre-operative warming can be recommended solely to improve thermal comfort, not to replace anxiolytic premedication regimens.", 
    "67": "Early life experiences, such as early handling, can influence neural development of rodents leading to changes in physiological and behavioural reactivity to stress. These effects are likely to be mediated by changes in maternal behaviour. This study analyzed the effects of different manipulations of the rearing environment on maternal behaviour and the behavioural and physiological response to mild challenges in CD-1 mouse pups early during development. Litters underwent either 15 min of neonatal handling (H) or were exposed briefly to an unfamiliar male intruder from postnatal (PND) days 2 to 14 (MI). Both groups were compared with litters which were not manipulated (NH). Compared to NH subjects, licking behaviour in the MI group was increased only on the first day of introduction of the male intruder, while the H group showed an increase in maternal behaviour on PND 10. On PND 8, pups ultrasonic vocalizations were recorded upon treatment with an anxiolytic drug (chlordiazepoxide 0, 2, or 7.5mg/kg). Results indicate that, although there were no differences among the groups when mice were injected with vehicle, handled subjects did not reduce their calling rate following drug administration, in contrast to the NH and MI groups. Following maternal separation and novelty exposure on PND 9, levels of hippocampal NGF increased significantly only in the H group. These data suggest that active pup manipulations in the form of handling favour behavioural and neural plasticity resulting in the maintenance of a high level of arousal and in increased neurotrophin levels in response to an acute manipulation. Changes in hippocampal levels of NGF might be involved in the appraisal of subtle changes in the early social environment.", 
    "68": "Inducible nitric oxide synthase knock-out (iNOS(-/-)) mice are valid models of investigation for the role of iNOS in patho-physiological conditions. There are no available data concerning neuroactive amino acid levels of iNOS(-/-) mice and their behaviour in response to pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). We found no significant differences in the convulsive dose 50 (CD(50)) between iNOS(-/-) and control (iNOS(+/+)) mice, however, iNOS(-/-) mice reach the kindled status more slowly than control, suggesting that in basal condition the GABA-benzodiazepine inhibitory inputs are unaltered by iNOS mutation. Clear differences between iNOS(+/+) and iNOS(-/-) mice amino acid concentrations were evident both in basal conditions and after kindling. Our results show that aspartate was significantly lower in all brain areas studied except the brain stem whereas glutamate and glutamine were significantly higher in the cortex, hippocampus and brain stem. GABA was slightly and not significantly higher in the cortex, hippocampus and brain stem, whereas taurine was significantly higher in all areas except diencephalon and glycine was significantly lower in the diencephalon and cerebellum. In this context, the inability of iNOS(-/-) mice to increase the NO levels following PTZ administrations indicate that NO might play a pro-epileptogenic role in the genesis and development of some types of epilepsy. Since there is no correlation between neurotransmitter levels and the development of kindling, it is possible to exclude that the difference between the two strains is due to an imbalance between the considered neurotransmitters, and it is then possible that this difference is due to the presence of iNOS, which might be involved in long term plasticity of the brain.",

    "77": "Tremor is one of the most frequent neurological signs. The correct clinical classification is mainly clinical. The most frequent primarily neurological tremor is essential tremor (prevalence 2 to 5%). It presents in most cases as a more or less symmetrical postural and kinetic tremor. In about 60% of cases an autosomal-dominant inheritance is found. Tremor may manifest not only in the hands but also in the head and voice. In about 60 to 70% of the patients alcohol may improve the tremor. Parkinsonian tremor is normally a tremor at rest and it starts asymmetrically. The legs and the face are frequently involved. Cerebellar tremor is intentional. Orthostatic tremor, which has a high frequency, mainly manifests in the legs and gives rise to postural instability. Dystonic tremor is an action tremor of the affected region of the body. Drug therapy, which is purely symptomatic, mostly depends on clinical manifestation. Postural and action tremors respond to non selective betablockers (propranolol), primidone, some antiepileptics (gabapentin, toparimate) and benzodiazepines. Classical rest tremors are improved by dopaminergic substances (levodopa, dopamine agonists) or anticholinergics. Dystonic tremor may successfully be treated by injections of botulinum toxin. Orthostatic tremor responds to gabapentin or benzodiazepines in some of the patients. In severely handicapped patients with refractory tremors the implantation of thalamic stimulation electrodes may be considered. This treatment may be very successful, however, its inherent risks have to be taken into account.",

Several morphometrical parameters in pineal and thyroid glands were measured after bird immunization with human red blood cells and/or treatment with melatonin or seduxen, melatonin receptor blocker. The peak of the thyroid activity was found on Day 7 after immunization. The immune system appears to directly activate the thyroid gland only in the presence of certain level of melatonin. We suggest that the melatonin mechanism of action includes the enhancement of thyroid gland sensitivity to immune factors. Seduxen prevented the stimulatory influence of the immune system on the thyroid gland.", 
    "79": "The inotropic response to muscarinic receptor stimulation of isolated chick ventricular myocardium was examined at various developmental stages, and the receptor subtype involved was pharmacologically characterized. In embryonic chick ventricles, carbachol (CCh) produced positive inotropy at micromolar concentrations. In hatched chick ventricles, CCh produced negative inotropy at nanomolar concentrations. Neither positive nor negative inotropy was observed in the 19 - 21-day-old embryos. Both positive and negative inotropy were also observed with acetylcholine and oxotremoline-M. The CCh-induced positive inotropy in 7 - 9-day-old embryonic ventricles and the negative inotropy in 1 - 3-day-old hatched chick ventricles were antagonized by muscarinic receptor antagonists; pA(2) values for the positive and negative responses of pirenzepine were 7.5 and 7.2, those of AF-DX116 (11-[(2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl)acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4] benzodiazepine-6-one) were 6.8 and 6.9, those of 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) were 9.0 and 8.5, and those of himbacine were 7.0 and 8.0, respectively. CCh had no effect on action potential configuration. In conclusion, the positive inotropy is most likely mediated by muscarinic M(1) receptors and the negative inotropy is mostly likely mediated by muscarinic M(4) receptors.", 
    "80": "Recent literature data and the results of our earlier pharmacological studies, have provided evidence that antagonists of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and agonists of group II mGluRs show anxiolytic-like properties in preclinical and clinical studies. Out of all glutamate receptors, the role of group III mGluRs in anxiety-like states is the least investigated because of the lack of specific pharmacological tools, moreover all group III receptor ligands synthesized so far are not systemically active, so they have to be administered centrally. In the present study, we investigated the anxiolytic-like activity of group III mGlu receptor ligands including a nonselective group III mGlu receptor agonist (1S,3R,4S)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3,4-tricarboxylic acid (ACPT-I), group III mGlu receptor antagonist, (RS)-alpha -cyclopropyl-4-phosphonophenylglycine (CPPG) and a positive allosteric modulator of mGluR4 (-)-N-phenyl-7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxamide (PHCCC). The Vogel conflict drinking test in rats was used to test the anxiolytic-like effects. The hippocampus was chosen as a site of the injection of drugs, as this brain regions is involved in the regulation of anxiety-related behavior. Intrahippocampal injections (CA1 region of the hippocampus) of PHCCC (12 nmol) but not of CPPG (75 nmol ) produced an anxiolytic-like response, moreover, the effect of PHCCC was totally blocked by CPPG. The anxiolytic-like effects of ACPT-I (7.5 nmol) or PHCCC (12 nmol) were significantly attenuated by flumazenil (10 mg/kg), indicating an involvement of GABAergic system in the anxiolytic-like response.",

    "86": "Acetylcholine (ACh) is an important regulator of intestinal epithelial ion transport via muscarinic or nicotinic ACh receptors. Previous studies emphasize the role of the M3 muscarinic receptor subtype in mediating the effects of cholinergic agonists on intestinal ion transport. With the prevalence of mouse models to study intestinal (patho)physiology, it is crucial that ion transport be understood in this species. Using M3 receptor-deficient (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice, we examined M3 receptor contributions to ion transport as well as its role in colitis induced by dextran sodium sulphate (DSS). In the Ussing chambers, ileal and colonic tissue from M3 KO and WT mice displayed similar baseline ion transport properties. Short-circuit current (ISC) responses to the muscarinic receptor agonist bethanechol were slightly decreased in ileal tissue from M3 KO mice compared with tissue from WT mice, whereas responses were not significantly different in colonic tissue. ISC responses to bethanechol were partially inhibited by pirenzepine in WT ileum, but not tetrodotoxin, suggesting involvement of a non-neuronal M1 muscarinic receptor. In the ileum, the M3 receptor may inhibit neuronally evoked ion transport, as indicated by the increased ISC responses to electrical stimulation in tissue from M3 KO mice. Furthermore, whereas all DSS-treated mice developed colitis, M3 KO mice displayed more rapid mass loss and more severe disease than DSS-treated WT mice, even following a reduction in the amount and time of DSS treatment. Thus, M3 receptor-KO mice are compensated in their ability to evoke muscarinic receptor-driven ion transport responses, but are more sensitive to DSS. This work highlights the need to dissect muscarinic receptor-mediated events in the mouse, as mice become increasingly valuable in enteric disease models.", 
    "87": "Food-deprived Wistar rats were exposed to a fixed-time 60-s food delivery schedule until they developed schedule-induced polydipsia. Every fifth lick was then followed by an electric shock during two, signalled, 5-min periods, which ran concurrently with the food delivery schedule. Shock intensities were adjusted to reduce licking to 60-70% of the unpunished licking rates. The benzodiazepine full agonists, diazepam (0.3-3.0 mg/kg), chlordiazepoxide (0.3-10.0 mg/kg), oxazepam (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) and the benzodiazepine partial agonist, RU-32698 (3.0-17.0 mg/kg), led to increases in punished responding at intermediate doses and decreases at the highest doses tested. All benzodiazepine agonists brought about dose-dependent decreases in unpunished schedule-induced polydipsia, with doses required to reduce drinking proving higher than doses required to increase punished schedule-induced polydipsia. The antipunishment effect of 0.3 mg/kg of diazepam was dose-dependently antagonized by flumazenil and the benzodiazepine inverse agonist, RU-34000. Flumazenil effects, however, could reflect actions of flumazenil as a partial inverse agonist at GABAA receptors. RU-32698 at 10.0 mg/kg further facilitated the rate-increasing effect of 0.3 mg/kg of diazepam, but at 17.0 mg/kg partially blocked such antipunishment effect. Overall, the present results extend the similarities of the effects of benzodiazepine compounds on adjunctive and operant patterns of behaviour by showing similar interactions within the benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "88": "We have previously shown that chronic treatment with clozapine induces tolerance to the clozapine discriminative stimulus in rats. The studies reported here extended this work to assess whether chronic treatment with the clozapine-like antipsychotics olanzapine and 5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-8-chloro-pyrido[2,3-b][1,5] benzoxazepine fumarate (JL13) induced cross-tolerance to clozapine. Two groups of rats were trained to discriminate clozapine (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). Training was suspended and the rats were treated with either olanzapine or JL13 at high doses (5 and 20 mg/kg, respectively). These doses were administered twice daily. The clozapine generalization curve was computed three times - before chronic drug treatment, after 10 days of chronic treatment, and after 16 drug-free days. Both olanzapine and JL13 induced cross-tolerance to the clozapine stimulus, shown by significant 3.4 and 3.9 fold parallel shifts to the right in the clozapine generalization curves. Cross-tolerance was lost spontaneously during the drug-free days after treatment as clozapine sensitivity returned to baseline. We interpret these findings as indicative of the development of pharmacodynamic cross-tolerance to clozapine. Possible neuroadaptive mechanisms involved in such cross-tolerance are discussed. The paradigm outlined here allows refinement of antipsychotic drug discrimination assays to identify common chronic effects of such drugs.",

    "94": "THIP is a hypnotic drug, which displays a unique pharmacological profile, because it activates a subset of extrasynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors containing delta-subunits. It is important to study the physiology and pharmacology of these extrasynaptic receptors and to determine how THIP interacts with other hypnotics and anesthetics. Here, we study the modulation of the extrasynaptic response to THIP using three classes of GABA(A)-receptor ligands. In whole cell recordings from mouse neocortical layer 2/3 pyramidal cells, THIP induced an extrasynaptic tonic current of 44 +/- 5 pA. The benzodiazepine site agonist and hypnotic zolpidem (500 nM), which displays selectivity for alpha(1/2/3)- and gamma(2)-containing receptors, did not alter the tonic current induced by THIP. The anesthetic etomidate (1 microM), which shows selectivity for beta(2)- and beta(3)-containing GABA(A) receptors, potentiated the THIP current by 126%. Etomidate also induced a small tonic GABA(A) current per se. The anesthetic propofol (1 microM), which displays broad-spectrum modulatory effects on several GABA(A)-receptor subtypes, enhanced the tonic THIP current by 117%. Finally, all three compounds modulated the function of intrasynaptic receptors activated by synaptically released GABA. Our study shows that the extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors responsible for the tonic THIP conductance likely do not contain alpha(1)-, alpha(2)-, alpha(3)-, and gamma(2)-subunits. Thus the tonic GABAergic conductance in the neocortex is presumably mediated by alpha(4)beta(2/3)delta receptors, which are likely to play a major role for neocortical excitability. Furthermore, our study has deepened the knowledge about the cellular actions of THIP as well as THIP's interactions with other hypnotics and anesthetics.",

Despite potential involvement of histamine receptor antagonism, or of other neurotransmitter systems, the mechanism by which antipsychotic drugs increase body weight is not elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether chronic antipsychotic treatments can directly alter the regulation of two main functions of white adipose tissue: lipolysis and glucose utilization. The influence of a classical antipsychotic (haloperidol) was compared to that of two atypical antipsychotics, one known to favor weight gain (olanzapine), the other not (ziprasidone). Cell size, lipolytic capacity and glucose transport activity were determined in white adipocytes of rats subjected to 5-week oral treatment with these antipsychotics. Gene expression of adipocyte proteins involved in glucose transport or fat storage and mobilization, such as glucose transporters (GLUT1 and GLUT4), leptin, matrix metallo-proteinase-9 (MMP9), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) was also evaluated. Adipocytes from chronic olanzapine-treated rats exhibited decreased lipolytic activity, lowered HSL expression and increased FAS expression. These changes were concomitant to enlarged fat deposition and adipocyte size. Alterations were observed in adipocytes from olanzapine-treated rats whereas the other antipsychotics did not induce any notable disorder. Our results therefore show evidence of an effect of chronic antipsychotic treatment on rat adipocyte metabolism. Thus, impairment of fat cell lipolysis should be considered as a side effect of certain antipsychotics, leading, along with the already documented hyperphagia, to the excessive weight gain observed in patients under prolonged treatment..",

Pharmacotherapy for acute psychotic agitation includes the use of antipsychotic and benzodiazepine drugs, either alone or in combination. Although oral treatment is preferred, options in the pharmacotherapy of acute agitation include the parenteral administration of antipsychotics in order to facilitate onset of drug action and quickly alleviate symptoms. Until recently only conventional antipsychotic and benzodiazepine drugs were available as intramuscular injections. Olanzapine has been one of the first atypical antipsychotics available for intramuscular administration. Four randomized placebo and comparator controlled , double-blind clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of olanzapine in reducing acute agitation in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar mania and Alzheimer and vascular dementia. Evidence from these clinical trials has shown that IM olanzapine associated with faster onset of action and more favorable profile of adverse events, than monotherapy with IM haloperidol. Current clinical experience and one naturalistic study with intramuscular olanzapine suggest that it is efficacious and can be safely used in \"real world\" patients with severe agitation. Intramuscular olanzapine have shown ease of transition to same agent oral therapy once the acute agitation has diminished. The orally disintegrating tablet formulation of olanzapine was effective rapidly reducing psychopathology, while improving medication compliance, attitudes and behaviours. This new formulation of olanzapine may offer an alternative strategy in the treatment of acutely ill, noncompliant schizophrenic patients. Evidence suggests that the new formulations of olanzapine should be among the first-line choices in the treatment of agitation in acute psychosis.",

In contrast to their expected effect benzodiazepines produce a decrease in most of the markers of homeostatic sleep regulation. Ligands with non-benzodiazepine structure (cyclopyrrolones, imidazopyridines, pyrazolopyrimidines) have a permissive or even stimulating effect in some measures of homeostatic sleep regulation. Some benzodiazepines have marked chronobiotic effects, while others interfere with circadian rhythms. The non- benzodiazepine-type hypnotics are mostly free of chronobiotic effects, although zaleplon may increase melatonin release. Given their acute hypothermic effect all hypnotic sedatives mimic the circadian signal of sleep initiation. Ultradian sleep regulation is largely unaffected by hypnotics. The microstructure of sleep as quantified by arousal instability is a sensitive measure of the effect of most of the hypnotics. Hypnotic sedatives decrease arousal instability. Zolpidem has the strongest effects in microstructural terms.", 
    "107": "A method is described for the simultaneous identification and quantification of opiates, amphetamines, cocainics, diazepam and nordiazepam from one hair extract (typically 10-50mg hair). After decontamination by washing with shampoo, dichloromethane, isopropanol and acetone, drugs were extracted using 0.1M HCl followed by SPE clean-up using mixed-mode extraction cartridges. The SPE extracts were submitted to a two-step derivatisation using MBTFA and MSTFA+1% TCMS and analysis was performed by GC-MS using both SIM and scan modes. Four deuterated standards were used to monitor 14 compounds. The limit of quantification was the total drug detected from the sample. This was 5 ng for amphetamines and 10 ng for remaining drugs which is equivalent to 0.1 and 0.2 ng/mg from a 50mg sample. Standard curves for the range 5-400 ng total drug concentration for all drugs had regression coefficients greater than 0.98. An authentic hair sample was used to validate the method and gave R.S.D.s <25% for both inter and intra-day reproducibility. The results of the analysis of hair taken from four patients attending a drug treatment clinic and six hair samples including head hair, pubic hair, axial hair and beard taken at post-mortem are presented.", 
    "108": "Catatonia may be monosymptomatic at presentation, with stupor or coma as the cardinal and only manifestation. A case of catatonic coma with profound bradycardia is presented to help clinicians recognize this entity and include catatonia in the differential diagnosis of coma as a rare etiology after other more common causes of coma have been excluded. Cases of catatonic coma are nevertheless important to identify because treatment with intravenous benzodiazepines is simple and highly effective. The authors argue that the descriptive term \"catatonic coma\" is preferable over terms implying psychogenesis, such as \"psychogenic\" or \"hysterical\" coma; for catatonia, the authors have a specific treatment, in the form of benzodiazepines; for \"psychogenesis,\" there is none.", 
    "109": "The effects of diazepam or lidocaine on the propofol induction dose and certain cardiovascular parameters were documented in this randomized, blinded study. Dogs received 0.9% saline (0.1 mL/kg intravenously [i.v.]), lidocaine (2 mg/kg i.v.), or diazepam (0.25 mg/kg i.v.) prior to propofol i.v. until loss of jaw tone was achieved (up to a maximum of 8 mg/kg). Propofol was followed by 0.3 mg/kg atracurium i.v. Direct arterial blood pressures and heart rates were recorded before premedication, induction, and intubation. No statistically significant differences were found among the groups for cardiovascular measurements or for the propofol dose required for intubation.", 
    "110": "Numerous neuroimaging studies have suggested that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients had a neurobiological abnormality in the frontal-subcortical circuits. On the other hand, there are distinct differences in the responses to pharmacological treatment among OCD patients. In the present study, we measured the concentration of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), a putative marker of neuronal viability, with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in OCD patients with different pharmacological responses. Participants comprised 20 patients and 26 healthy control subjects. OCD patients were divided into three groups according to the pharmacological response; responders to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (group A: n=7), responders to SSRI with an atypical antipsychotic (group B: n=8) and non-responders to either SSRI or SSRI with an atypical antipsychotic (group C: n=5). Short echo proton MRS was used to measure NAA concentrations in the anterior cingulate, the left basal ganglia and the left prefrontal lobe of subjects. A significantly lower NAA concentration was observed only in group B compared with control subjects in the anterior cingulate. Our results suggest that a subgroup of OCD patients who respond to an SSRI with an atypical antipsychotic have distinct biological abnormalities in the anterior cingulate.", 
    "111": "Changes in GABA(A) receptors are observed in schizophrenia, with benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA(A) receptor subtypes being affected differently to other subtypes. However, long-term antipsychotic drug use in schizophrenia may underlie these changes. To test this, we examined the effects of administering a typical (haloperidol) and an atypical (olanzapine) antipsychotic drug on the GABA(A) receptor agonist (orthosteric) and benzodiazepine (allosteric) binding sites in rat prefrontal cortex. As antipsychotic drugs have delayed maximal therapeutic effects we also examined different drug treatment periods. Male SD rats received a sucrose solution containing either haloperidol (1.5 mg/kg), olanzapine (6.5 mg/kg) or no drug daily for either 7, 14 or 28 days. Sections of rat brain were then labelled with [(3)H]muscimol, which labels the total population of GABA(A) receptors, or the benzodiazepine site ligand [(3)H]flunitrazepam in separate saturation binding experiments using quantitative receptor autoradiography. [(3)H]Muscimol binding was enhanced in the prefrontal cortex after 7 days but no differences were observed after longer periods of drug administration. In contrast there was a delayed increase in density of benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA(A) receptors in the PFC, suggesting that antipsychotic drugs have different effects on different GABA(A) receptor subtypes. These changes in the properties of GABA(A) receptor binding following antipsychotic drug administration are not consistent with those observed in schizophrenia and suggest a 'reshuffling' in GABA(A) receptor subtypes over time.", 
    "112": "Several studies have demonstrated the effective use of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in the management of mood, however studies of its use in psychosis remain limited. The aim of this study was to investigate for the first time efficacy of DHEA augmentation with standardized antipsychotic medication (olanzapine) and to explore effects of DHEA augmentation on side-effect profiles including weight gain, glucose tolerance, aggression, quality of life and neurocognitive function. Finally, we aimed to analyze any relationship between plasma levels and clinical response to DHEA administration. Forty patients with chronic schizophrenia stabilized on olanzapine were randomized in double-blind fashion to receive either DHEA (titrated up to 150mg) or placebo augmentation for a period of 12-weeks. Blood samples were collected at baseline, mid-study and study completion. Results indicated improvement of negative symptoms (SANS scale) even when baseline scores were controlled as a covariate. Some improvement in Parkinsonism and akathisia compared to baseline was seen in patients receiving DHEA. No change in psychosis as reflected by the PANSS was noted. Patients receiving DHEA appeared to demonstrate relatively stable glucose levels compared to controls at the end of the study. An improvement in cognitive performance (most notably memory), which did not reach significance due to low sample number, was observed following DHEA administration. Results further suggest preliminary evidence of involvement of the neurosteroid system in schizophrenia pathophysiology, and confirm initial \"cautious\" findings identifying an agent capable of improving negative symptoms and certain features of extrapyramidal side effects.", 
    "113": "Both gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and flunitrazepam are often used illicitly in combination with ethanol. Nevertheless, the effects that these and other drugs of abuse have on the reinforcing effects of ethanol remain inconclusive. To test the effects of GHB and flunitrazepam on contingent ethanol intake, twelve male Long-Evans rats were trained to orally consume ethanol using a saccharin-fading procedure. After training, all animals preferentially consumed ethanol instead of water at each of five ethanol concentrations (0-32%) when tested with a two-bottle preference test in the homecage. Animals then received a noncontingent dose of ethanol (0.32, 0.56, 1, and 1.33 g/kg), flunitrazepam (0.032, 0.1, and 0.32 mg/kg), or GHB (100, 180, 320, and 560 mg/kg) prior to each subject's daily access to ethanol (18% v/v). Noncontingent doses of ethanol decreased ethanol intake, however, the subjects consumed enough ethanol to maintain a consistent total ethanol dose in g/kg. Flunitrazepam did not affect ethanol intake at any dose tested, whereas GHB only affected intake at the highest dose (560 mg/kg), a dose that also produced sedation. These data suggest that there are perceptible or qualitative differences between GHB, flunitrazepam, and ethanol in terms of their capacity for modulating oral ethanol intake in outbred rats.", 
    "114": "Cholecystokinin and related peptides are involved in the control of intestinal motility and cholecystokinin receptor ligands might represent new pharmacological tools for the treatment of symptoms associated with functional bowel disorders. However, the respective roles played by cholecystokinin receptor subtypes and the mechanisms underlying these regulatory actions remain undetermined. This study was designed to examine the influence of cholecystokinin receptor subtypes on the motor activity of guinea-pig distal colon. The effects of drugs acting on CCK1 and CCK2 receptors were assessed in vitro on the contractile activity of longitudinal smooth muscle, both under basal conditions and in the presence of transmural electrical stimulation or KCl-induced contractions. The application of cholecystokinin octapeptide sulphate (cholecystokinin-8S) to colonic preparations induced concentration-dependent contractions which were prevented by devazepide (CCK1 receptor antagonist), enhanced by GV150013 (CCK2 receptor antagonist) or N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME, nitric oxide synthase inhibitor), and unaffected by tetrodotoxin. The application of gastrin-17 to colonic preparations resulted in relaxant responses which were insensitive to devazepide, and prevented by GV150013, L-NAME or tetrodotoxin. L-NAME, N(omega)-propyl-L-arginine (NPA, neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor) or GV150013 enhanced electrically evoked contractile responses, whereas devazepide did not. When tested in the presence of L-NAME or NPA the enhancing effect of GV150013 on electrically induced contractions no longer occurred. In the presence of KCl-induced pre-contractions, cholecystokinin-8S or gastrin-17 evoked concentration-dependent relaxations, which were unaffected by devazepide and were counteracted by GV150013, L-NAME, NPA or tetrodotoxin. In conclusion, the present results indicate that, at level of distal colon, CCK1 receptors mediate direct contractile effects on smooth muscle, whereas CCK2 receptors on enteric neurons mediate relaxant responses via nitric oxide release.", 
    "115": "Nausea and vomiting continues to be an important problem for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) are classified as acute, occurring within the first 24h, or delayed, occurring after the first 24h. A number of antiemetic agents are available for the management of nausea and vomiting, including 5-HT3-receptor-antagonists, corticosteroids, NK-1-receptor-antagonists, dopamine-receptor antagonists, benzodiazepines, neuroleptics and cannabinoids. With modern antiemetic therapy, vomiting can be prevented in 70-80% of patients, whereas the control of nausea remains suboptimal. The development of acute emesis is known to depend on serotonin. The pathophysiology of delayed emesis is less well understood, and multiple mechanisms may contribute, including substance P. Here, the most recent developments in the antiemetic therapy, including new antiemetic drugs and the latest guidelines for antiemetic prophylaxis, are reviewed.", 
    "116": "The steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) mediates the acute steroidogenic response by moving cholesterol from the outer to inner mitochondrial membrane, but the mechanism of StAR's action has remained mysterious. We showed that StAR acts on the outer membrane, requires cholesterol binding, and requires the structural change previously described as a pH-dependent molten globule. The current model is that StAR's interaction with protonated phospholipid head groups on the outer mitochondrial membrane induces a molten globule transition needed for StAR to take up cholesterol. Recent data suggest a functional interaction between StAR and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). Whereas many models have suggested that StAR delivers cholesterol to PBR, we suggest that StAR removes cholesterol from the cholesterol-binding domain of PBR and delivers it to the inner mitochondrial membrane.", 
    "117": "Alprazolam (ALP) is a widely prescribed sedative and antidepressant benzodiazepine group of drugs. The wide uses of this drug lead us to investigate its possible interaction with hemoglobin (Hb). Spectrophotometric and spectofluorimetric studies showed strong binding of ALP with Hb. Circular dichroic spectra showed that alpha-helical structure of Hb-subunits has been largely changed. On ALP treatment partial pressure of O(2) is increased in the blood indicating release of O(2) from erythrocytes. Further, the binding of ALP-induced conformational changes in Hb resulting in larger Hb particle size was demonstrated by dynamic light scattering experiment. Thus, the present study unambiguously raises question of danger of random usage of ALP, which binds with and changes the function of Hb.", 
    "118": "In the present study, we examined the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of the mixture of alpha- and beta-amyrin (AMY), pentacyclic triterpenes isolated from the stem bark resin of Protium heptaphyllum. These effects of AMY were demonstrated by the open-field, elevated-plus-maze, rota rod, forced swimming, and pentobarbital-induced sleeping time tests, in mice. In the open-field test, AMY at the doses of 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg, after intraperitoneal or oral administrations, significantly decreased the number of crossings, grooming, and rearing. All these effects were reversed by the pre-treatment with flumazenil (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.), similarly to those observed with diazepam used as a positive standard. In the elevated-plus-maze test, AMY increased the time of permanence and the number of entrances in the open arms. On the contrary, the time of permanence and the number of entrances in the closed arms were decreased. All these effects were also completely reversed by flumazenil, an antagonist of benzodiazepine receptors. In the pentobarbital-induced sleeping time test, AMY at the same doses significantly increased the animals sleeping time duration. In the rota rod test, AMY did not alter motor coordination and, thus, was devoid of effects, as related to controls. Since AMY, at the doses of 10 and 25 mg/kg, showed a sedative effect in the open field test, lower doses (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg) were used in the forced swimming test, producing a decrease in the immobility time, similarly to that of imipramine, the positive control. The effect of AMI was greater when it was administered 15 min after imipramine (10 mg/kg). However, the antidepressant AMY effects were not altered by the previous administration of paroxetine, a selective blocker of serotonin uptake. In addition, AMY effects in the forced swimming test were totally blocked by reserpine pretreatment, a drug known to induce depletion of biogenic amines. In conclusion, the present work evidenced sedative and anxiolytic effects of AMY that might involve an action on benzodiazepine-type receptors, and also an antidepressant effect where noradrenergic mechanisms will probably play a role.",

Hypnotic method was based on potentiation of pentobarbital induced sleeping time by extracts. Three doses of extracts (100, 500 and 1000 mg/kg) were injected i.p. in comparison with diazepam (3mg/kg) as positive control and saline as negative control. After 30 min of injection of extracts, pentobarbital (30mg/kg) was injected and increase in sleeping time by extracts was recorded.

CYP3A4 produced more 4-hydroxytriazolam than alpha-hydroxytriazolam at concentrations of more than 60 muM triazolam, and different steroids had different inhibitory effects on the system. To clarify these interesting observations, the interactions between substrate and substrate/steroid were investigated by theoretical calculations. When two triazolam molecules were docked into the active site, the distance between the O-atom and the 4-hydroxylated site was less than the distance to the alpha-hydroxylated site because of interaction between the two triazolam molecules. Estradiol inhibited both alpha- and 4-hydroxytriazolam formation by 50%. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) inhibited alpha-hydroxylation more than 4-hydroxytriazolam formation, whereas aldosterone had no effect. When one triazolam molecule and one steroid molecule were simultaneously docked, estradiol increased the distance between the O-atom and the two hydroxylated sites, DHEA only increased the distance between the O-atom and alpha-hydroxylated site, and aldosterone did not change the distances. The relevant angles of Fe-O-C in the hydroxylated site of triazolam also widened, together with increased distance. These findings indicate that formation of a substrate and substrate/effector complex in the active site may be a factor for determining the enzyme kinetic parameters of CYP3A4.",

To slow cognitive impairment in mild/moderate AD, the experts recommended a cholinesterase inhibitor alone or combined with vitamin E. Donepezil and galantamine were the preferred cholinesterase inhibitors. The experts recommended combining a cholinesterase inhibitor with a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist (e.g., memantine) if a patient with mild/moderate dementia has an inadequate response to monotherapy. Control of hypertension and diabetes was the treatment of choice, in patients with mild/moderate vascular or mixed AD/vascular dementia, with aspirin another first-line option. Cholinesterase inhibitors were also a first-line option for mild/moderate mixed AD/vascular dementia. Among nonpharmacological interventions for mild/moderate dementia, the experts recommended caregiver education, supportive therapy for caregivers, referral to day treatment, exercise programs, and respite care. For moderate/severe AD or mixed AD/vascular dementia, the experts recommended combining an NMDA antagonist with a cholinesterase inhibitor. For moderate/severe vascular or mixed AD/vascular dementia, they recommended control of hypertension and diabetes. The experts' ratings underscore the importance of nonpharmacological strategies aimed at reducing caregiver burden in more severe dementia. Management of agitation and other behavioral disturbances was another focus of this study. The experts recommended using an atypical antipsychotic for agitation associated with delirium, psychosis, aggression, or anger. They would also consider divalproex to manage anger with a risk of physical aggression. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were recommended for the treatment of depression or anxiety in patients with dementia. Benzodiazepines or atypical antipsychotics were viewed as short-term options for acute anxiety. Trazodone was recommended for insomnia. The experts also gave recommendations concerning dosage levels, duration of treatment, and choice of medications for patients with different complicating conditions.",

This prospective, randomized, controlled trial evaluated changes in these parameters during propofol or midazolam infusion during and in the early postoperative period following surgery. Twenty patients undergoing CABG were randomized preoperatively into two groups: 10 patients received propofol (induction 1.5 mg/kg, maintenance 1.5 mg kg(-1) h(-1)) and 10 patients received midazolam (induction 0.5 mg/kg, maintenance 0.1 mg kg(-1) h(-1)). Both groups also received fentanyl (induction 20 mug/kg, maintenance 10 microg kg(-1)). Serum lipids, glucose, and plasma osmolality were measured preinduction, precardiopulmonary bypass, at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass, at the end of surgery, and 4 and 24 h postoperatively. In the propofol group, we observed a significant increase in triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein levels 4 h postoperatively. In the midazolam group, we observed a significant decrease in low-density lipoprotein, cholesterol at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass, end of surgery, and 4 and 24 h postoperatively and significant increase in osmolality at the end of cardiovascular bypass. Changes in glucose levels did not differ significantly different between the two groups. In patients with normal serum lipids, glucose, and plasma osmolality undergoing CABG, propofol infusion for maintenance anesthesia is not associated with dangerous changes in serum lipids, glucose, and plasma osmolality compared with midazolam. A propofol infusion technique for maintenance of anesthesia for cardiac surgery where serum lipids and glucose may be of concern could be recommended as an alternative to midazolam.",

Persistence of invalidating action myoclonus is a major problem. Drugs like phenytoin can aggravate ULD. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the effect of add-on lamotrigine (LTG) in the five patients under our care who received LTG.", 
    "161": "Three men and two women, aged 20-50 years who had ULD confirmed by molecular biology, followed in two epilepsy centers, received add-on LTG at 50-300 mg/d. All of them had valproate. The other drugs used in cotherapy were high-dose piracetam, benzodiazepines phenobarbital, topiramate, and primidone. The assessment of LTG was based on detailed interview and clinical examination. Aggravation was diagnosed when myoclonic jerks (MJ) increased without irregular intake of medication, inappropriate lifestyle, encephalopathic or metabolic complications, or overdosage.", 
    "162": "In two patients, LTG exacerbated MJ in a dose-dependent manner. In one patient, a delayed, severe exacerbation of myoclonus occurred that only ceased after LTG withdrawal and introduction of levetiracetam. These three patients had minor forms of ULD. In two patients with moderate to severe forms of ULD, LTG had no effect.", 
    "163": "Although symptoms may fluctuate in ULD, it was possible to pinpoint lack of improvement (2/5), dose-related exacerbation of myoclonus (2/5), and putative late-onset aggravation (1/5) in five patients treated with adjunctive LTG.

Dosing between children and adolescents significantly differed in the olanzapine group, whereas dosing was comparable in the ziprasidone group. No significant differences between the olanzapine and ziprasidone treatment groups were noted regarding length of stay, efficacy of the study medications, number of restraints, and duration of restraints. Ziprasidone subjects received significantly more doses of emergency medication during their hospital stay and significantly more doses of ziprasidone were administered with concomitant lorazepam or antihistamines.", 
    "167": "The results suggest i.m. ziprasidone and intramuscular olanzapine may be equally effective in treating aggression in youth. These agents may also be similar with regard to safety because no clinically significant adverse events were reported for either treatment group. The possibility of poor documentation of adverse events and side effects prevents formulating definitive conclusions regarding safety from this study.",

Interactions between KTZ and CYP3A substrates have been reported both in vivo and in vitro. Most of them, however, involved the KTZ racemate. KTZ racemate and the separate enantiomers, 2R,4R; 2R,4S; 2S,4S, and 2S,4R, were evaluated for their selectivity in inhibiting alprazolam and quinine metabolism.", 
    "169": "The inhibition of alprazolam and quinine metabolism was studied in an in vitro system of human liver microsomes (HLM), recombinant of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. The concentrations of formed 3-hydroxyquinine and 4- and alpha-hydroxyalprazolam were measured by HPLC and LC-MS, respectively.", 
    "170": "Quinine 3-hydroxylation was catalyzed to a similar extent by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. The formation rate of 4-hydroxyalprazolam was higher than that of alpha-hydroxyalprazolam for each HLM, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. KTZ racemate and enantiomers showed differential inhibitory effects of quinine and alprazolam metabolism. Quinine metabolism catalyzed by HLM, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 was potently inhibited by the trans-enantiomer KTZ 2S,4S, with IC(50) value of 0.16 microM for HLM, 0.04 microM for CYP3A4 and 0.11 microM for CYP3A5. The same enantiomer showed the lowest IC(50) values of 0.11 microM for HLM and 0.04 microM for CYP3A5 with respect to alprazoalm 4-hydroxylation and also the same pattern for alprazolamalpha-hydroxylation, 0.13 microM for HLM and 0.05 microM for CYP3A5. Alprazolam metabolism (both alpha- and 4- hydroxylations) catalyzed by CYP3A4 was inhibited potently by the cis-enantiomer KTZ 2S,4R, with IC(50) values of 0.03 microM.", 
    "171": "Alprazolam and quinine metabolism is catalyzed by both CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. The present study showed that different KTZ enantiomers inhibit CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 to different degrees, indicating that structural differences among the enantiomers would be related to their inhibitory potency on these two enzymes.",

Smoking, alcohol intake, and substance abuse were more frequent among treated mothers. In infants in the exposed group, signs involving the central nervous and the respiratory systems were often observed (63.2% and 40.8%, respectively). These signs appeared during the first day of life, with a median duration of 3 days for exposed newborns. The signs resolved in 75% of cases within 3 to 5 days for term and premature newborns, respectively. All exposed premature newborns presented behavioral manifestations compared with 69.1% of term exposed newborns. Median length of stay was almost 4 times longer for exposed premature newborns than for those who were unexposed (14.5 vs 3.7 days).",

The side effect profiles of the various drugs in the class differ, however, raising the possibility of drug-specific mechanisms for similar side effects. We used physiogenomic analysis, an approach previously employed to study the genetics of drug and diet response, to discover and compare genetic associations with weight profiles observed in patients treated with olanzapine and risperidone as an approach to unraveling contrasting mechanistic features of both drugs. A total of 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected from 13 candidate genes relevant to two potential pharmacological axes of psychotropic-related weight profiles, appetite peptides and peripheral lipid homeostasis. We applied physiogenomic analysis to a cross-section of 67 and 101 patients being treated with olanzapine and risperidone, respectively, and assessed genetic associations with the weight profiles. Weight profiles in patients treated with olanzapine were significantly associated with SNPs in the genes for apolipoprotein E, apolipoprotein A4 and scavenger receptor class B, member 1. Weight profiles in patients treated with risperidone were significantly associated with SNPs in the genes for leptin receptor, neuropeptide Y receptor Y5 and paraoxonase 1. These results are consistent with contrasting mechanisms for the weight profile of patients treated with these drugs. Genes associated with olanzapine weight profiles may be related to peripheral lipid homeostatic axes, whereas those associated with risperidone's may be related to brain appetite peptide regulation. Future physiogenomic studies will include neurotransmitter receptor SNPs and validation in independent samples.",

Early, targeted use of medications that have demonstrated efficacy in the management of LGS or its associated epilepsies may simplify the patient's treatment regimen and reduce the incidence of adverse events. Key to the overall benefit to the patient is to maximize seizure control while minimizing adverse effects, especially behavioral and cognitive problems. Clobazam has demonstrated clinical benefit and has been administered safely in more than 50 European studies in which data were reported on greater than 3000 pediatric and adult patients with epilepsy, 300 of whom were diagnosed with LGS; therefore, its use is now being investigated in the U.S. This review will explore the use of clobazam in the treatment of epilepsy, particularly with regard to its potential benefit in LGS. Though not currently approved for use in the U.S., a program is underway to gain Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with refractory epilepsy, specifically in LGS. A phase 2 study will be completed in late 2006 to investigate the safety and efficacy of clobazam as adjunctive therapy in 68 pediatric and adult patients with LGS.",

Clinical features, dose of drug received, and laboratory test results were noted. Adverse effects from the use of haloperidol such as prolonged QTc, dystonic reactions, and torsades de pointes were recorded.",

    "184": "The steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) is responsible for acute control of cholesterol transport across the mitochondrial membrane, however the mechanism of StAR-associated cholesterol transport is unknown and may involve the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR)/endozepine system. Several molecules of PBR may associate to form a channel through which cholesterol passes to the inner mitochondrial membrane, and endozepine is the natural ligand for PBR. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) was used to test StAR/PBR/endozepine interactions, PBR aggregation, and the effect of second messengers on interactions. There was no evidence of StAR/PBR, StAR/endozepine, or PBR/endozepine interactions. The StAR and PBR fusion proteins were trafficking to the mitochondria as expected, but the endozepine fusion protein was not localized to the mitochondria indicating that it was not biologically active. Data were obtained indicating that PBR forms aggregates in the mitochondrial membrane. Energy transfer between PBR fusion proteins was dose and time dependent, but there was no effect induced by PK11195 ligand binding or pharmacologic activation of PKA or PKC second messenger pathways. It appears that PBR aggregates in the mitochondrial membrane, however there was no evidence that PBR aggregation is regulated in the acute control of steroidogenesis, or that PBR and StAR interact.", 
    "185": "The purpose of the current study is to investigate the feasibility of producing solid self-emulsifying pellets using the extrusion/spheronization technique. Pellets were made from a mixture of C18 partial glycerides, Solutol HS15 and microcrystalline cellulose. Pellets with good physical properties (size, shape, friability) and self-emulsifying properties were produced. The pellets were, in contrast to pellets lacking Solutol, able to transfer a lipophilic dye and a spin probe into the aqueous media. The release kinetics and the microenvironment of the pellets during the release process were assessed using electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. The ESR results showed that the hydrophobic spin probe was localized mainly in the lipid environment all over the release time. Furthermore, the formulation was capable of accelerating the release of the drug diazepam and achieving a diazepam concentration above its saturation solubility. In conclusion, spherical pellets with low friability and self-emulsifying properties can be produced by the standard extrusion/spheronization technique. The pellets are capable of transfering lipophilic compounds into the aqueous phase and have a high potential to increase the bioavailability of lipophilic drugs.", 
    "186": "There is evidence that the neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) is important for the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse. However, less is known regarding the role of CCK in drug seeking and craving. The present study investigated whether the CCK(B) antagonist L-365, 260 could block morphine-induced drug seeking using the conditioned place preference paradigm and whether the dopaminergic reward pathway contributes to the effect of L-365, 260 on expression of morphine place preference. We found that systemic administration of the CCK(B) antagonist L-365, 260 attenuates the expression of morphine-induced drug seeking as assessed using conditioned place preference (CPP) and shows that this effect is mediated by CCK(B) receptors in the anterior nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Additionally, we demonstrate that this effect is dependent on D(2) receptor activation in the anterior nucleus accumbens (NAcc). These results indicate that endogenous CCK modulates the incentive-salience of morphine-associated cues and suggest that CCK antagonists may be useful in the treatment of drug craving.", 
    "187": "5-HTergic and GABAergic systems are involved in neurobiology of anxiety. Precedent studies have demonstrated that SSRIs possessed an anxiolytic-like effect in the four-plate test (FPT) at doses that did not modify spontaneous locomotor activity. This effect seems to be mediated through the activation of 5-HT(2A) postsynaptic receptors. The purpose of the present study was to examine the implication of GABA system in the anxiolytic-like activity of DOI in the FPT. To achieve this, the co-administration of DOI (5-HT(2A/2C) receptor agonists) with GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptor ligands was evaluated in the FPT. Alprazolam, diazepam and muscimol (for higher dose) potentiated the anxiolytic-like effect of DOI. Bicuculline, picrotoxin and baclofen inhibited the anxiolytic-like effect of DOI. Flumazenil and CGP 35348 had no effect on the anxiolytic-like activity of DOI. These results suggest that the GABA system seems to be strongly implicated in the anxiolytic-like activity of DOI in the FPT.", 
    "188": "Hydroethanol (HE) and methanol (ME) extracts obtained from the leaves of Passiflora actinia Hooker were evaluated for behavioral effects in mice. Single-dose oral administration of HE (300 and 600 mg/kg) or ME (100 and 300 mg/kg) resulted in anxiolytic-like effects in the elevated plus-maze. The anxiolytic-like effects were also seen after the repeated administration of the HE (100 and 300 mg/kg). Flumazenil (10mg/kg, i.p.), a GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, blocked the effects of ME (300 mg/kg, p.o.) and HE (600 mg/kg). At higher doses, a sedative effect produced by acute administration of HE (600 mg/kg) or ME (300 mg/kg) was indicated by the potentiation of pentobarbital-induced sleep. With regard to memory-disrupting effects of anxiolytics, mice were evaluated by measuring the retest step-down latency 24h after foot-shock in a passive avoidance task. In contrast to diazepam (0.5mg/kg) or piracetam (200mg/kg), ME (30, 100 and 300 mg/kg) or HE (100, 300 and 600 mg/kg) did not influence the step-through latency in the acquisition or retention memory tasks. The present results show an anxiolytic profile for HE and ME of Passiflora actinia. There are also indications of an involvement of GABA(A) system in this effect.",

The study was conducted at 30 sites in the United States between July 2001 and June 2002. The primary outcome measure was the mean change in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score. Secondary measures included the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-21), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar Version (CGI-BP) severity of illness scale, and the Cognitive Test for Delirium (CTD). Quality of life (Short Form Health Survey [SF-12]), psychological well-being (Psychological General Well-Being [PGWB] inventory), and sexual functioning were also compared.", 
    "191": "Mean modal doses for olanzapine and risperidone were 14.7 mg/day and 3.9 mg/day, respectively. Between treatments, there was no difference in mean change in the YMRS, MADRS, CTD, PGWB, or SF-12 measures or in remission or response rates. Significantly more olanzapine-treated patients completed the study compared with risperidone patients (78.7% vs. 67.0%; p = .019). Olanzapine-treated patients had greater HAM-D-21 (p = .040) and CGI-BP (p = .026) score improvement across the study. Olanzapine-treated patients experienced greater elevations in liver function enzymes (p < .05) and increase in weight (2.5 kg vs. 1.6 kg; p = .004), while risperidone-treated patients were more likely to experience prolactin elevation (51.73 ng/mL vs. 8.23 ng/mL; p < .001) and sexual dysfunction (total score increase of 1.75 vs. 0.64; p = .049).",

    "193": "Recently, the Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group proposed symptomatic remission criteria and pointed to the lack of data regarding functional remission and quality of life in schizophrenia. This post hoc analysis of data from German patients in the Schizophrenia Outpatient Health Outcomes study assessed rates and predictors of symptomatic and functional remission as well as adequate subjective well-being/quality of life in a large cohort of patients with schizophrenia.", 
    "194": "Data were collected in an observational 24-month follow-up study of 2960 patients with DSM-IV-defined schizophrenia recruited between January and December 2001. Complete remission required that patients achieved symptomatic remission mirroring the Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group criteria, functional remission, and a level of adequate subjective well-being over at least 6 months.", 
    "195": "At endpoint, 47.2% of the patients achieved symptomatic remission, 26.6% achieved functional remission, and 42.2% achieved adequate subjective well-being. At endpoint, 12.8% were in complete remission. In 35.1% of patients, none of the 3 remission criteria were achieved. Only 8.7% of early nonremitted cases achieved remission at endpoint. Each single remission component as well as complete remission was mainly predicted by early remission within the first 3 months. First-line treatment with atypical antipsychotics increased the likelihood of complete remission compared to conventional antipsychotics.", 
    "196": "Despite advances in pharmacologic and psychosocial treatments in schizophrenia, close to 90% of the patients in this study did not fulfill the combined remission criteria. This was in part attributable to the low functional remission rate, particularly the low employment rate. The finding that the course of the disorder depends on early outcome not only in previously untreated but also in more chronically ill patients points toward a critical \"window of opportunity\" in the course of treatment.", 
    "197": "Delirium is an organic mental syndrome defined by a global disturbance in consciousness and cognition, which develops abruptly and often fluctuates over the course of the day. It is precipitated by medical illness, substance intoxication/withdrawal or medication effect. Delirium is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and is a leading presenting symptom of illness in the elderly. Elderly patients with altered mental status, including agitation, should be presumed to have delirium until proven otherwise. The clinical manifestations of delirium are highly variable. A mental status evaluation is crucial in the diagnosis of delirium. Medical evaluation and stabilization should occur in parallel. Life-threatening etiologies including hypoxia, hypoglycemia and hypotension require immediate intervention. The differential diagnosis of etiologies of delirium is extensive. Patients with delirium need thorough evaluations to determine the underlying causes of the delirium. Pharmacological agents should be considered when agitated patient has the potential to harm themselves or others, or is impeding medical evaluation and management. Unfortunately, the evidence to guide pharmacologic management of acute agitation in the elderly is limited. Current pharmacologic options include the typical and atypical antipsychotic agents and the benzodiazepines. These therapeutic options are reviewed in detail.", 
    "198": "Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is clinically characterized by altered mental status and the diagnosis is confirmed by electroencephalography. Absence status (AS) and complex partial status (CPS) are the two primary types of NCSE. Patients in NCSE may exhibit a wide range of clinical presentations including subtle memory deficits, bizarre behavior, psychosis, or coma. While prognosis is dependent on the underlying etiology and possibly related to duration of the event, there is limited research in this area. Treatment focuses on correcting underlying pathologic abnormalities such as hyponatremia or drug toxicity, and initiating pharmacologic therapy. The benzodiazepines are considered the first line treatment for both AS and CPS.", 
    "199": "Over the past 20 years, hypnotic drug use has diminished in France, while consumption of anxiolytics and neuroleptics has remained stable and antidepressant use has risen. Data from the ESEMeD survey (European Study of Epidemiology of Mental Disorders) conducted in 2002 in Germany, Belgium, Spain, France, Netherlands and Italy showed that use of anxiolytics during the previous year (including recurrent use) was less frequent in Germany than elsewhere. Belgium and France had a higher prevalence of antidepressant consumption. Among depressed patients, fewer than one-third reported antidepressant use (no difference among the countries), while one-third said they used anxiolytics (higher rate in France). One-quarter of patients with anxiety stated they used a benzodiazepine (lower rate in Germany). Age, psychiatric disorders and neurological disorders were strongly associated with benzodiazepine use. Factors strongly associated with antidepressant use were age (bell-shaped curve), female sex, and psychiatric disorders.", 
    "200": "We have considered published work and clinical experience focusing on the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine in order to form a consensus on the most appropriate treatment strategies for hospitalised patients with acute schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. It is important to consider the specific treatment needs of these patients and these are discussed in the context of current treatment guidelines. We will review the efficacy and tolerability of atypical antipsychotics versus conventional antipsychotics and/or benzodiazepines as a first-line treatment, and examine the suitability of oral versus intramuscular formulations in the acute setting. The potentially beneficial properties of specific atypical agents are also considered. Appropriate dosing is particularly important in acutely ill patients as it can help achieve rapid improvement. We will discuss emerging data which show that rapid initiation of quetiapine in patients with acute psychosis or mania is not only as effective as standard initiation, but is also well tolerated. This may be important for treatment in the long term as a positive initial treatment experience can determine patient compliance and treatment adherence. In conclusion, this review recommends that oral atypical antipsychotics should be a first-choice medication for acutely ill cooperative patients in the hospital setting."
