Therefore, the authors evaluated the effects of minimal sedation with propofol in rats placed in an innate anxiogenic situation, the elevated plus-shaped maze.", 
    "1": "In experiment 1, spontaneous locomotor activity was determined in rats as a measure of sedative effect induced by propofol (0-9 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally). In experiment 2, groups of rats received propofol (0-9 mg/kg) or diazepam (0-2 mg/kg) and then were placed on a plus-shaped maze elevated above the ground that was composed of two opposite closed arms and two opposite open arms. On an initial exposure to the maze, undrugged rats avoid the open arms, with the number of entries into and time spent within the open arms constituting approximately 20% of their total activity. This reflects normal anxiety in a rodent for any elevated open platform.", 
    "2": "In experiment 1, 0-9 mg/kg propofol did not alter spontaneous activity in rats. In experiment 2, propofol and diazepam significantly increased the number of entries into and the time spent within the open arms. Propofol at a dose of 9 mg/kg significantly increased the rats' level of exploration of the open arms to about 50% of all exploratory activity, and a similar observation was made with 2 mg/kg diazepam.",

    "4": "The effects of sevoflurane on the electrophysiologic properties of the human heart are unknown. This study evaluated the effects of sevoflurane on the electrophysiologic properties of the normal atrioventricular conduction system, and on the accessory pathways in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, to determine its suitability as an anesthetic agent for patients undergoing ablative procedures.", 
    "5": "Fifteen patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome undergoing elective radiofrequency catheter ablation were studied. Anesthesia was induced with alfentanil (20-50 microg/kg) and midazolam (0.15 mg/kg), and vecuronium (20 mg) and maintained with alfentanil (0.5 to 2 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) and midazolam (1 or 2 mg every 10-15 min, as required). An electrophysiologic study measured the effective refractory period of the right atrium, atrioventricular node, and accessory pathway; the shortest conducted cycle length of the atrioventricular node and accessory pathway during atrial pacing; the effective refractory period of the right ventricle and accessory pathway; and the shortest retrograde conducted cycle length of the accessory pathway during ventricular pacing. Parameters of sinoatrial node function included sinus node recovery time, corrected sinus node recovery time, and sinoatrial conduction time. Intraatrial conduction time and the atrial-His interval were also measured. Characteristics of induced reciprocating tachycardia, including cycle length, atrial-His, His-ventricular, and ventriculoatrial intervals, also were measured. Sevoflurane was administered to achieve an end-tidal concentration of 2% (1 minimum alveolar concentration), and the study measurements were repeated.", 
    "6": "Sevoflurane had no effect on the electrophysiologic parameters of conduction in the normal atrioventricular conduction system or accessory pathway, or during reciprocating tachycardia. However, sevoflurane caused a statistically significant reduction in the sinoatrial conduction time and atrial-His interval but these changes were not clinically important. All accessory pathways were successfully identified and ablated.", 
    "7": "Sevoflurane had no effect on the electrophysiologic nature of the normal atrioventricular or accessory pathway and no clinically important effect on sinoatrial node activity. It is therefore a suitable anesthetic agent for patients undergoing ablative procedures.", 
    "8": "Previous studies have demonstrated that vascular responses to acetylcholine (ACh), an endothelium-dependent vasodilator, are enhanced in exercise-trained animals. In order to see if chronic exercise upregulates endothelial muscarinic (M) receptor, the subtype of M receptors responsible for ACh-induced vasorelaxation in the thoracic aorta of male Wistar rats was characterized first, then a receptor assay was performed. These animals were divided into exercise and control groups. The trained rats ran on a treadmill with a moderate intensity for 60 min per day, 5 days per week. After 10 weeks of training, rats were decapitated and their thoracic aortae were isolated. The subclass of M receptor in endothelium was pharmacologically identified on the basis of selective affinity of antagonists; ie, pirenzepine for M1, gallamine for M2, and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide for M3. Our results showed that in the thoracic aorta of Wistar rats, 1) ACh-induced vasorelaxation was mediated by M3 receptor; 2) chronic exercise enhanced ACh-evoked vasodilating responses. However, this alteration was not caused by receptor upregulation, as maximal binding sites and affinity of M3 receptor were not changed by chronic exercise. Other possible mechanisms need to be further studied.", 
    "9": "Early postnatal freeze lesions in rat neocortex produce anatomic abnormalities resembling those observed in human patients with seizure disorders. Although in vitro brain slices containing the lesion are hyperexcitable, the mechanisms of this alteration have yet to be elucidated. To test the hypothesis that changes in postsynaptic inhibitory receptors may underlie this hyperexcitability, we examined properties of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAAR)-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs). Recordings were obtained in layer II/III pyramidal cells located 1-2 mm lateral to the lesion. mIPSC peak amplitude and rate of rise were increased relative to nonlesioned animals, whereas decay time constant and interevent interval were unaltered. Bath application of zolpidem at a concentration (20 nM) specific for activation of the type 1 benzodiazepine receptor had no significant effect on decay time constant in six of nine cells. Exposure to higher concentrations (100 nM) enhanced the decay time constant of all cells tested (n = 7). Because mIPSCs from unlesioned animals were sensitive to both concentrations of zolpidem, these results suggest that freeze lesions may decrease the affinity of pyramidal cell GABAARs for zolpidem. This could be mediated via a change in alpha-subunit composition of the GABAAR, which eliminates the type 1 benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "10": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors expressed within the medial preoptic area (mPOA) are known to play a critical role in regulating sexual and neuroendocrine functions. In the rat brain, high levels of expression of the gamma1 subunit mRNA of the GABAA receptor are restricted to a limited number of regions that mediate sexual behaviors, including the mPOA. The biophysical and pharmacological profiles of native gamma1-containing receptors in neurons are unknown. Here, we have characterized the properties of GABAA receptor-mediated spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) and currents elicited by fast perfusion of GABA to isolated mPOA neurons of juvenile male and female rats. No significant sex-specific differences were evident in the mean peak amplitude, distribution of event amplitudes, kinetics of current decay, or the frequency of sIPSCs. The profile of modulation of sIPSCs by diazepam, beta-CCM and zolpidem, allosteric modulators that act at the benzodiazepine (BZ) site of the GABAA receptor, support the assertion that mPOA neurons of both sexes express functional gamma1-containing receptors. The ability of zolpidem to modulate both sIPSC amplitude and currents elicited by rapid perfusion of GABA to mPOA neurons differed significantly between the sexes. Zolpidem reversibly induced negative modulation of currents in mPOA neurons isolated from male rats, but had no effect in mPOA neurons from female rats. Concentration-response analysis of responses in neurons acutely isolated from male rats indicated an IC50 of 58 nM with maximal decreases of approximately 50% of control peak current amplitude. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that levels of the gamma1 subunit mRNA are significantly higher in mPOA neurons from male than female rats. No significant sex-specific differences were detected in the levels of alpha1, alpha2, or alpha5 mRNAs. These results suggest that native gamma1-containing receptors are expressed in primary neurons of the mPOA and that sex-specific differences in the expression of this subunit may contribute to sexual dimorphism in GABAA receptor modulation by compounds acting at the BZ site.", 
    "11": "The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is responsible for generating circadian rhythms in mammals, and GABA is the predominant neurotransmitter in the SCN. Properties of gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) responses in SCN neurons were examined in acutely prepared hypothalamic slices from 3- to 8-wk-old rats with the use of whole cell voltage-clamp techniques. Zn2+ reduced the amplitude of GABAA-mediated spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in a concentration-dependent manner ranging from a reduction of control amplitude to 88% at 10 microM to 27% at 1,000 microM. Zn2+ reduced IPSC amplitude to a similar degree in the presence of tetrodotoxin and also significantly reduced the amplitude of currents evoked by application of exogenous GABA (100 microM, pressure applied). Zn2+ increased the frequency of IPSCs at lower concentrations and decreased it at higher ones. Flunitrazepam (100 nM) usually failed to potentiate the amplitude of sIPSCs, but prolonged sIPSC kinetics. Two exponential components were normally resolved in the sIPSC decay constants, and flunitrazepam significantly increased those two components. Thus flunitrazepam increased the duration of sIPSCs and potentiated the amplitude of currents evoked by pressure application of GABA. Zn2+ and benzodiazepine each modulated the effect of GABA in nearly all cells, suggesting that most SCN neurons have a similar GABAA receptor subunit composition in this respect. Zn2+ also affected sIPSC frequency, which suggests that Zn2+ increased neuronal firing rate at lower concentrations. These results begin to define the cellular roles that these GABAA receptor modulators might play in circadian regulation.", 
    "12": "We assessed the sedative potential of continuous infusions of remifentanil with a validated composite alertness scale in 160 patients (ASA physical status I or II) undergoing hip replacement surgery with spinal block (n = 61) or hand surgery using brachial plexus block (n = 93). They were randomized to receive one of the following initial dose regimens in double-blinded fashion: placebo or 0.04, 0.07, or 0.1 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) remifentanil subsequently titrated to effect. Additional midazolam IV was allowed for adequate sedation as required. The combined analysis of both surgery groups revealed a dose-related increase in achievement of sedation level > or =2 within 15 min of the start of the study drug infusion; all remifentanil dose comparisons with placebo reached significance (P < 0.001). The remifentanil 50% effective dose for a composite sedation level > or =2 within 15 min of the start of drug infusion was estimated as 0.043 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) (95% confidence interval 0.01, 0.059). The requirement for midazolam decreased with increasing remifentanil dose compared with placebo (P < 0.001). The median time to return to alertness after the end of infusion was 10-12 min in the remifentanil groups and 5 min in the placebo group. Significant incidences of nausea, pruritus, sweating, and respiratory depression were reported during remifentanil infusions compared with placebo. The data suggest that remifentanil may be useful for supplementation of regional anesthesia, provided that ventilation is carefully monitored.", 
    "13": "In this dose-finding, placebo-controlled study, remifentanil infusions were used to provide sedation during spinal and brachial plexus regional anesthesia. The 50% effective dose for achievement of sedation was 0.043 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1). Return to alertness occurred after 10-12 min (median time). Remifentanil infusions can be used to supplement regional anesthesia, but this requires careful monitoring of ventilation.", 
    "14": "Generally, compounds discriminated by animals possess psychotropic effects in animals and humans. As with many other drugs of abuse, strength of the ethanol discriminative stimulus is dose related. The majority of studies show that doses close to 1.0 g/kg are close to the minimum at which the discrimination can be learned easily. Substitution studies suggest that anxiolytic, sedative, atactic, and myorelaxant effects of ethanol all play an important role in the formation of its intercoeptive stimulus. Low doses of ethanol produce more excitatory cues, similar to amphetamine-like subjective stimuli, whereas higher doses produce rather sedative/hypnotic stimuli similar to those elicited by barbiturates. Substitution studies have shown that the complete substitution for ethanol may be exerted by certain GABA-mimetic drugs acting through different sites within the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex (e.g., diazepam, pentobarbital, certain neurosteroids), gamma-hydroxybutyrate, and antagonists of the glutamate NMDA receptor. Among the NMDA receptor antagonists both noncompetitive (e.g., dizocilpine) and competitive antagonists (e.g., CGP 40116) are capable of substituting for ethanol. Further, some antagonists of strychnine-insensitive glycine modulatory sites among the NMDA receptor complex (e.g., L-701,324) dose-dependently substitute for the ethanol discriminative stimulus. On the other hand, neither GABA-benzodiazepine antagonists nor NMDA receptor agonists produce contradictory effects (i.e., reduce the ethanol discriminative stimulus). There is influence of a particular training dose of ethanol on the substitution pattern of different compounds. For example, 5-HT(1B/2C) agonists substitute for intermediate (1.0 g/kg) but not higher (2.0 g/kg) ethanol training doses. Discrimination studies with ethanol and drugs acting on NMDA and GABA receptors consistently indicate asymmetrical generalization. For example, ethanol is able to generalize to barbiturates and benzodiazepines, but neither the benzodiazepine nor barbiturate response generalizes to ethanol. Only a few drugs are able to antagonize, at least to some extent, the discriminative stimulus of ethanol (e.g., partial inverse GABA-benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-4513 and the opioid antagonist naloxone). The ethanol stimulus effect may be increased (i.e., stronger recognition) by N-cholinergic drugs (nicotine), dopaminergic drugs (apomorphine), and 5-HT3 receptor agonists (m-chlorophenylbiguanide). Thus, the ethanol stimulus is composed of the several components, with the NMDA receptor and GABA(A) receptor complex being of particular importance. This suggests that a drug mixture may be more capable of substituting for ethanol (or block its stimulus) than a single compound. The ability of drugs to substitute for the ethanol discriminative stimulus is frequently, although not preclusively, associated with the reduction of voluntary ethanol consumption. The examples of positive correlation are gamma-hydroxybutyrate, possibly memantine and certain serotonergic drugs such as fluoxetine. However, it remains uncertain to what extent the discriminative stimulus of ethanol can be seen as relevant in the understanding of the complex mechanisms of dependence.", 
    "15": "This study examines i) the activity of serum prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) and dipeptidlyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) in detoxified alcohol-dependent patients without liver disease versus normal controls, and ii) the relationships between serum DPP IV and PEP activity and the production of cytokines or cytokine receptors, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-y (IFN-y), IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), and IL-10, and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulatory factor (GM-CSF). Alcohol-dependent patients had significantly lower serum PEP and DPP IV activity than normal controls. We found that 58.3% and 50.0% of the alcohol-dependent patients, respectively, had PEP and DPP IV activities, which were lower than the mean control values minus 2 SD. There were significant inverse correlations between lowered serum DPP IV and PEP activity and the increased production of IL-6, INF-gamma, IL-IRA, IL-10, and GM-CSF. These results show that lower serum DPP IV and PEP activity may be related to the pathophysiology of alcohol dependence.", 
    "16": "Delirium is a common complication of dementia and may produce considerable morbidity. In addition to psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions, delirium may produce considerable agitation, which may be refractory to conventional medications such as antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. The main approach to delirium is to treat any underlying medical problem that could cause the delirium. However, delirium is not always reversible, and there is no specific treatment for persistent delirium. The authors present a case of delirium complicating a preexisting dementia that resolved rapidly following initiation of the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil, suggesting that cholinergic dysfunction may have played a role in the etiology of this patient's delirium. Future research needs to be directed at the issue of cholinergic activity in delirium through monitoring of serum anticholinergic activity and its response to procholinergic therapy.", 
    "17": "We report about a 30-year-old female patient with terminal renal failure, undergoing allogenic renal-transplantation after two and a half years on hemodialysis. Besides, the preoperative examination seemed normal. The intraoperative phase was uneventful, except a transfusion-requiring blood-loss of 2000 ml, and the graft started diuresis immediately after reperfusion. Postoperatively the duration of the non-depolarising muscle-relaxant atracurium was prolonged for more than one hour and a deep sedation, caused by the premedication-benzodiazepine Dipotassiumchlorazepat, was seen. Unless antagonisation, the patient was unconscious for some hours. Laboratory evaluation showed peripheral hypothyroidism with normal pituitary activity: T(3)0.8 ng/ml, T(4)3.9 micrograms/dl und TSH 0.67 microU/ml. Under temporary substitution with L-Thyroxine 50 micrograms, the patient recovered quickly an could be demitted after 10 days. Further controls showed euthyroidism. 14 month later, she underwent an antirefluxive surgical procedure, at excellent graft-function. Anesthesia was uneventful that time.", 
    "18": "In common with other halogenated volatile anaesthetics, sevoflurane causes a dose-related cardiovascular depression and therefore the affection of blood flow of different organ systems is suggested. So far known, sevoflurane is not different compared to isoflurane in affecting liver and splanchnic blood flow. Concluded from former published studies there was no case of hepatic toxicity of sevoflurane been published so that this substance can be used in patients with reduced hepatic function. The primary organic metabolite of sevoflurane is hexafluorisopropanol (HFIP), which is readily and rapidly conjugated with glucuronic acid. No reactive intermediates are formed and HFIP appears to be an unlikely compound to form liver protein adducts. For this reasons sevoflurane \"hepatitis\" is not expected. Like most other inhalation agents sevoflurane increase the neuromuscular blockade after treatment with muscle relaxants in anaesthesia. The MAC values of Sevoflurane where reduced after the application of nitrous oxide, benzodiazepines and opiates. From human studies we know that chronic drug therapy with isoniazid induces the metabolism of sevoflurane, enflurane and isoflurane, markedly increasing peak plasma fluoride concentrations. However, barbiturates as well as phenytoin do not influence the metabolism of sevoflurane because these agents do not induce the major hepatic defluorinating enzyme cytochrome P450 2E1. Obesity, untreated diabetes mellitus and alcohol abuse increase the hepatic content and activity of cytochrome P450 2E1 and therefore enhanced anaesthetic defluorination is to be suspected. Until now, there are no studies about sevoflurane anaesthesia in patients after liver transplantation but the extremely low hepatotoxic potential as compared to isoflurane provides no argument to avoid this substance for anesthesia in liver transplanted patients.", 
    "19": "S-0509, 2-[(tert-butoxycarbonylmethyl) [(m-(carboxy-phenyl)-ureidomethyl-carbonyl]] aminobenzo phenone, was developed as a potent and selective CCKB/gastrin receptor antagonist that does not affect the central nervous system.", 
    "20": "We evaluated the effects of S-0509 on gastric acid secretion and duodenal ulcerogenic and healing responses in rats comparing it with L-365,260, another CCKB/gastrin receptor antagonist.", 
    "21": "S-0509 (0.1 approximately 10 mg/kg, i.d.) was able to dose-dependently decrease basal acid secretion and inhibit the acid secretory responses induced by both pentagastrin (60 microg/kg/h, i.v.) and peptone (10%, i.g.) but not histamine (4 mg/kg/hr, i.v.) or carbachol (60 microg/kg/h, i.v.). L-365,260 (10 and 30 mg/kg, i.d.) caused only partial a suppression of the acid secretory response to pentagastrin but not to other stimuli, including peptone treatment. On the other hand, a duodenal ulcerogen, mepirizole (200 mg/kg, s.c. ) caused an increase in acid secretion and resulted in penetrating ulcers in the proximal duodenum, and these ulcers gradually healed over 3 weeks. S-0509 significantly inhibited both the acid secretory (> 1.0 mg/kg, i.d.) and ulcerogenic (> 3 mg/kg, p.o.) responses induced by mepirizole when it was given as a pre-treatment. It also promoted significantly the healing of these ulcers (> 3 x 2 mg/kg, p. o.) when it was given twice daily for 14 days. In contrast, L-365, 260 (30 mg/kg) tended to reduce the severity of mepirizole-induced duodenal ulcers, with a slight inhibition of acid secretion, but it caused no influence on the healing response of these ulcers.", 
    "22": "These results confirmed that S-0509 is a selective CCKB/gastrin receptor antagonist with potent antisecretory action in vivo conditions, and further demonstrated that this agent not only prevents the development of duodenal ulcers but also shows healing promoting action on duodenal ulcers, probably through the blockade of CCKB/gastrin receptors.", 
    "23": "It has been hypothesized that the morbidity and mortality associated with schizophrenia can be prevented by providing effective treatment during the first episode of psychosis. Hence, the authors examined patients with first-episode psychosis to determine the efficacy and safety of olanzapine and haloperidol treatment.", 
    "24": "A subpopulation of first-episode patients (N=83) from a large prospective, multicenter, international, double-blind, 6-week acute treatment study was evaluated. These patients were selected from a pool of 1,996 patients who had a DSM-III-R diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder and who also met the following criteria: 1) the length of their current psychotic episode had to be 5 or fewer years, and 2) patients had to be 45 years of age or younger at onset of first psychotic symptoms.", 
    "25": "Compared to haloperidol, olanzapine showed a statistically significantly greater reduction in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total and negative scores and in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total and positive scores. Clinical response (defined as 40% or greater improvement in BPRS total score from baseline) was also statistically significantly higher in olanzapine-treated patients (67.2%) than in haloperidol-treated patients (29.2%). Olanzapine-treated patients further showed statistically significant improvements in the Simpson-Angus scale and Barnes Akathisia Scale scores, while haloperidol-treated patients showed a worsening on both measures. Compared to olanzapine-treated multiple-episode patients in the parent study, olanzapine-treated first-episode patients achieved an even statistically significantly higher response. Haloperidol-treated first-episode patients experienced statistically significantly more extrapyramidal symptoms than haloperidol-treated multiple-episode patients.", 
    "26": "In patients experiencing first-episode psychosis, olanzapine had a risk-benefit profile significantly superior to that of haloperidol.

    "32": "In a prospective double-blind study, 23 patients were randomly assigned to either group I (n = 12), receiving 3.75 mg midazolam, or group II (n = 11), receiving a matched placebo 60 min before RBA. Plasma concentrations of known mediators of the endocrinological stress response were analysed at five perioperative times: adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisole (CORT), somatotropic hormone (STH), epinephrine (EPI), norepinephrine (NOR), and dopamine (DOP).", 
    "33": "The observed endocrinological reaction was moderate. Perioperative anxiety and, above all, RBA were the main stressors. The endocrine stress response could best be seen within the fast-reacting sympathoadrenergic system. Midazolam significantly suppressed the epinephrine and the cortisole answer (p < 0.01). After RBA an ACTH plasma peak only was observed after placebo. Plasma-STH showed extreme variability. An STH-peak after midazolam is presumably due to a gonadotropic hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) secretion directly stimulated by midazolam. Midazolam had no significant effect upon norepinephrine. A significant (p < 0.01) increase for plasma-cortisole was seen 60 min after the operation when compared to preoperative values.", 
    "34": "The results indicate that even at a low dose midazolam positively influences the endocrine stress response. The combination of this stress-reducing effect with the well-known hemodynamic stability, the distinct anxiolytic and sedative action, suggest low-dose midazolam as a favourable premedication for intraocular surgery.",

    "37": "Status Epilepticus (SE) is a medical emergency warranting prompt treatment with rapidly-acting antiepileptic drugs. For immediate effect, benzodiazepines are the drugs of choice, but may result in morbidity due to respiratory suppression and hypotension. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus usually does not have significant neurological sequelae, and there is little evidence that generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus (GNSE) causes lasting neurologic deficits. The risk versus benefit of potentially morbid medications must, therefore, be weighed against the \"adverse effects\" of GNSE. A patient with frequent episodes of GNSE lasting 4-48 hours had previously been treated with benzodiazepines, but required admission for consequent somnolence. Following intravenous valproate given during EEG monitoring, GNSE broke after 30 minutes. The confused patient returned to a normal cognition and returned home without sequelae. Intravenous valproate may provide an effective treatment alternative to benzodiazepines in GNSE without their associated morbidity.",

The present study was carried out with wild-type and chimeric muscarinic receptors to determine whether UH-AH 37 might also have an allosteric mode of action. In assays that detect only allosteric interactions, UH-AH 37 slowed the rate of dissociation of [3H]N-methylscopolamine (NMS) from all five muscarinic receptor subtypes, with the highest apparent affinity at m2. By contrast, studies carried out under equilibrium conditions have found UH-AH 37 to have the lowest affinity for the m2 subtype. Studies with m2/m5 chimeric receptors found the allosteric potency of UH-AH 37 to be sensitive to an epitope in the seventh transmembrane domain (TM). Again, this contrasts with equilibrium studies, wherein an epitope in the sixth TM has been implicated. Simultaneous analysis of the interactions between UH-AH 37 and [3H]NMS at the m2 receptor under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions found that a simple allosteric model could not accommodate both sets of data. On the other hand, the model did accommodate such data for gallamine; gallamine also displays concordance in order-of-potency and epitope sensitivity between equilibrium and non-equilibrium assays. Based on these results, we conclude that UH-AH 37 interacts at the classical muscarinic binding site with high affinity and at a second (allosteric) site with lower affinity.", 
    "39": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of the opiate antagonist naloxone (10 mg/kg) on the action of a subeffective dose of chlordiazepoxide. C57BL/6 mice were tested for either anxiety, using an elevated plus maze, emotional memory in a passive avoidance paradigm or spatial memory in a radial maze. In the elevated plus maze, chlordiazepoxide 2.5 mg/kg was ineffective per se but, when combined with naloxone, it increased the proportion of open-arm entries, as did a higher dose of chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg). Closed-arm entries were increased with chlordiazepoxide (2.5 mg/kg) injected alone but naloxone, alone or combined with chlordiazepoxide, did not modify this measure. In the passive avoidance test, chlordiazepoxide 2.5 mg/kg decreased the latency to enter a compartment associated with an electric foot-shock, while a dose of 1.25 mg/kg, alone or in combination with naloxone, was ineffective. Finally, in the radial arm maze, chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) induced amnesia. However, a dose of 2.5 mg/kg, alone or with naloxone, had no effect on learning. Naloxone elicited no intrinsic action in any of these behavioural models. It can be concluded that naloxone potentiates the anxiolytic but not the amnestic action of chlordiazepoxide.",

The membrane-receptor relationship showed differences between C57B1/6 with an \"active\" ESR phenotype and Balb/c with a \"passive\" ESR at the GABA benzodiazepine receptor complex level. The pharmacological results evidenced the selective anxiolytic properties of the novel drug aphobazole (2-[2-morpholyno)ethylthio]-5-ethoxybenzimidazole dihydrochloride) which produced an activating anxiolytic action in Balb/c mice whereas no behavioral changes were observed in C57B1/6 mice.",

Short-term bile and pancreatic juice diversion from a short jejunal blind loop, representing only 8-10% of the total length of the small intestine, stimulated a significant increase in pancreatic exocrine secretion. Short-term bile and pancreatic juice diversion from jejunal blind loops of increasing length resulted in a progressive decrease in the pancreatic secretory response to diversion (i.e., there appears to be a length-dependent inhibition of the pancreatic secretory response to short-term bile and pancreatic juice diversion from the jejunum). Cholinergic receptor blockade with atropine eliminated this length-dependent inhibition of pancreatic exocrine secretion during short-term bile and pancreatic juice diversion. In contrast to what was observed with short-term bile and pancreatic juice diversion, there was a length-dependent increase in pancreatic secretion during long-term bile and pancreatic juice diversion. The jejunal-bypass rat model can facilitate the investigation of the intestinal mechanisms mediating feedback regulation of pancreatic exocrine secretion.", 
    "42": "Abuse liability and acute subjective and psychomotor effects of flunitrazepam were assessed in ten methadone-maintained males with history of benzodiazepine and alcohol use, who voluntarily participated in a double-blind, controlled, cross-over, randomized clinical trial. There were six experimental sessions in which a single oral dose of flunitrazepam 1, 2, and 4 mg; triazolam 0.5 and 0.75 mg; and placebo was given. Evaluations included physiological measures; psychomotor performance tasks (simple reaction time, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, balance task, Maddox-wing device); and self-administered subjective effects questionnaires [Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI), Profile of Mood States (POMS), a series of visual analog scales (VAS)]. All drugs but flunitrazepam 1 mg caused an impairment of psychomotor tasks. Effects were more evident with the highest doses of both drugs. Only flunitrazepam 4 mg produced a significant decrease in balance time. Triazolam 0.75 mg induced increases in sedation measured by ARCI-PCAG, depression in POMS, and VAS-drowsiness scores. Flunitrazepam 4mg caused euphoria-related effects as measured by increases in ARCI-MBG and \"high\" scores in the VAS. Our findings of flunitrazepam-induced euphoria in methadone-maintained subjects together with epidemiological evidence of flunitrazepam abuse by opioid dependents, suggest that it may be included in the group of benzodiazepines with a relatively high abuse potential.", 
    "43": "Twenty-four volunteers (19 women and five men) with insomnia and a history of chronic use of benzodiazepine hypnotics participated in a randomized, double blind, controlled clinical trial. The study was designed to assess the effects of substituting zopiclone (ZOP)- as an hypnotic- among chronic users of flunitrazepam (FLU), and to compare the subsequent withdrawal of ZOP with placebo controlled withdrawal of FLU. During the 5 weeks of a withdrawal protocol, sleep and physiological parameters were assessed by polysomnographic measures for 11 nights and by nightly actigraphic recordings for weeks 1, 3, and 5. Subjective effects of the withdrawal process were evaluated with daily sleep diaries, and with various weekly self-report symptom checklists. Paired t-tests performed on differences in objective sleep parameters between baseline and the last weeks of the withdrawal program showed a significant decrease in sleep quality within the FLU group, but not in the ZOP group. Subjective sleep diaries consistently reflected the objectively measured changes in sleep throughout the withdrawal program, indicating significant changes in sleep parameters only in the FLU group. The results obtained from the self report inventories aimed at assessing withdrawal symptoms, however, revealed no differences between the baseline week and the termination week of the program in any of the groups. After completing the pharmacological withdrawal, all subjects received a short-term cognitive behavioral intervention focused on improving their coping strategies with symptoms of insomnia; they were evaluated immediately after concluding the intervention, and at 3 and 12 month follow- ups.", 
    "44": "The effect of cyamemazine a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist on voluntary ethanol consumption in rats and on ethanol withdrawal in mice was examined. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were tested in a free choice (water and 10% ethanol) experiment and consumed 5 g/kg ethanol daily. Rats were treated daily IP with cyamemazine (0.5, 1, or 2 mg/kg) or acamprosate (100 mg/kg) during 2 weeks. Both acamprosate and 1 mg/kg cyamemazine significantly decreased ethanol intake by 45% without affecting either fluid or food intake. The lowest dose of cyamemazine had no effect on alcohol intake but increased food intake. The highest dose had no effect on any variables. During the post-treatment period, only 1 mg/kg cyamemazine decreased both ethanol and fluid intakes. Mice were made dependent on alcohol using a chocolate fluid diet containing increasing concentrations of alcohol and withdrawn after 9 days. Mice were treated with cyamemazine (1 or 0.5 mg/kg, respectively) or with the same doses of lorazepam acutely on the day of withdrawal or chronically (during alcohol treatment). Both chronic and acute cyamemazine and lorazepam treatments decreased convulsions during ethanol withdrawal. Both acute treatments decreased locomotor activity in control and alcohol dependent mice. Chronic treatment had no effect on locomotor activity. We suggest that cyamemazine could reduce alcohol consumption by antagonizing the activation of the dopaminergic pathways during the induction of alcohol dependence. The action of cyamemazine on 5-HT3 receptors could also explain its effect on alcohol convulsions during withdrawal convulsions.", 
    "45": "The novel selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1B/1D agonist, zolmitriptan (Zomig, formerly known as 311C90), has shown good efficacy in the acute oral treatment of migraine. Zolmitriptan acts both centrally and peripherally, therefore it is important to assess central nervous system effects. At single doses of 25-50 mg (up to 8 times the likely therapeutic dose), zolmitriptan can cause sedation; therefore, a study was designed to examine the dose-response. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, six-limb crossover study in 13 healthy volunteers compared the effects of single oral doses of zolmitriptan (5, 10, 15 or 20 mg) and lorazepam (2 mg) on various psychometric tests. Zolmitriptan doses less than 20 mg had no statistically significant effects on choice reaction time, the Stroop test, visual analog scale (VAS) assessments of physical sedation, tranquilization and other types of feelings, the logical reasoning test or the adaptive tracking test. There was a mild transient increase in the subjective assessment on VAS of mental sedation which was dose related and occurred mainly with the highest zolmitriptan dose and were not reflected in objective measures of drug effects. In contrast, lorazepam (used as a positive control) was associated with statistically significant impairment in all tests (except tranquilization) for up to 10 h after dosing. The results demonstrate that therapeutic doses of zolmitriptan are unlikely to cause clinically significant impairment in psychometric performance.", 
    "46": "In various steroidogenic cell models, mitochondrial preparations and submitochondrial fractions, the expression of the mitochondrial 18 kDa peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) protein confers the ability to take up and release, upon ligand activation, cholesterol. Thus, cholesterol becomes available to P450scc on the inner mitochondrial membrane. These in vitro studies were validated by in vivo experiments. Treatment of rats with ginkgolide B (GKB), specifically reduced the ligand binding capacity, protein, and mRNA expression of the adrenocortical PBR and circulating glucocorticoid levels. Treatment with GKB also resulted in inhibition of PBR protein synthesis and corticosterone production by isolated adrenocortical cells in response to ACTH. The ontogeny of both PBR binding capacity and protein directly paralleled that of ACTH-inducible steroidogenesis in rat adrenal cells and in rats injected with ACTH. In addition, the previously described suppression of luteal progesterone synthesis in the pregnant rat by continuous in vivo administration of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist may be due to decreased luteal PBR ligand binding and mRNA. These results suggest that (i) PBR is an absolute prerequisite for adrenocortical and luteal steroidogenesis, (ii) regulation of adrenal PBR expression may be used as a tool to control circulating glucocorticoid levels and (iii) the stress hypo-responsive period of neonatal rats may result from decreased adrenal cortical PBR expression.", 
    "47": "A collaborative survey was performed to compare prescribing strategies for the treatment of epilepsy in Mediterranean countries, based on analysis of 500 questionnaires compiled by physicians in 14 different countries. For partial seizures, carbamazepine was the drug of choice in most countries, whereas the second choice of drug differed widely. For primarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures, valproic acid was usually preferred, but other drugs used widely in some countries included phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine. Lamotrigine was the most popular second-line drug for primarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures in the European countries. In patients where the initial drug failed, switching to an alternative monotherapy was usually the preferred strategy, but advocates of early use of combination therapy exceeded 30% in the respondents of seven countries. Most respondents, in all countries except Turkey, did not prescribe drugs to prevent recurrence of febrile seizures; however, intermittent prophylaxis with a benzodiazepine was advocated by a considerable number of physicians, and continuous prophylaxis was prescribed by a significant minority of respondents in France, Syria and Tunisia. New drugs were rarely used as first-line treatment due to high cost and inadequate experience. Overall, this survey indicates that there is a wide variability in therapeutic practices between and within countries. This information may be useful for the implementation of national educational activities and for the design of pragmatic trials aimed at comparing different therapeutic strategies.", 
    "48": "People with a learning disability are often disadvantaged due to the nature of their disability. Up to a third are likely to have concomitant epilepsy which adds to the health loss experienced by this group. It is important to manage their epilepsy in such a way as to limit the debilitating effects of both the illness and the medication. Rectal diazepam remains the gold standard rescue medication for prolonged, recurrent seizures or seizures associated with hypoxia. Some of the drawbacks are highlighted in this paper and we go on to explore a novel means of treating these seizures. Midazolam, via the intranasal route, has been used extensively in children, mostly as a sedative but also in the treatment of epilepsy. We present two cases, both are adults with a learning disability, who have benefited significantly from the use of intranasal midazolam. Ongoing research into the safe use of this form of treatment, training of staff and carers and the impact on the individual is being conducted.", 
    "49": "Panic Control Treatment (PCT) is a widely used, empirically validated cognitive-behavioral treatment for panic disorder. Initially developed for the treatment of panic disorder with limited agoraphobic avoidance, PCT more recently has been finding broader applications. It has been used as an aid to pharmacotherapy discontinuation in panic disorder; in the treatment of panic attacks associated with other disorders such as schizophrenia; and, in combination with a situational exposure component, in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe agoraphobia. The authors critically review the evidence for the clinical efficacy of PCT and recent work directed at further enhancing the long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of treatment.", 
    "50": "Diazepam, one of the benzodiazepine group of tranquilizers, is used as an adjunctive drug for sedation and for relief of anxiety in the treatment of epilepsy. Suspicion has been aroused of a possible mutagenic and teratogenic effect of this drug, thus the potential for cancer development.", 
    "51": "To analyze the mutagenic effect of diazepam, the micronuclei and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) tests were performed by in vivo techniques in the bone marrow of Balb-C mice after intraperitoneal drug administration. Sixty mice, 30 males and 30 females, were classified as negative control (n = 12), positive control (n = 12), and three groups were treated with diazepam (n = 36). All groups were matched by sex, and each mouse received a single intraperitoneal injection. Negative control group was injected with physiological saline, positive control group with mitomycin-C at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg of body weight. Treated groups received diazepam, one at 0.1, the other at 0.2, and the last, at 0.4 mg/kg.", 
    "52": "The results showed a significant increase in the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes at all doses tested for whole population in relation to negative control. The polychromatic/normochromatic erythrocyte ratio showed a significant decrease at doses of 0.1 and 0.4 mg/kg in relation to negative control. The frequency of SCE was significantly higher at doses of 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg in relation to negative control, the male mice being those affected.", 
    "53": "It is concluded that diazepam showed mutagenic and genotoxic effects on bone marrow cells of mice and that it might represent a human health risk.", 
    "54": "The 5-HT2B receptor agonist, BW 723C86 (10, 30(mg/kg i.p. 30 min pre-test), increased the number of punishments accepted in a rat Vogel drinking conflict paradigm over 3 min, as did the benzodiazepine anxiolytics, chlordiazepoxide (2.5-10 mg/kg p.o. 1 h pre-test) and alprazolam (0.2-5 mg/kg p.o. 1 h pre-test), but not the 5-HT2C/2B receptor agonist, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP, 0.3-3 mg/kg i.p) or the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, buspirone (5-20 mg/kg p.o. 1 h pre-test). The effect of BW 723C86 was unlikely to be secondary to enhanced thirst, as BW 723C86 did not increase the time that rats with free access to water spent drinking, nor did it reduce sensitivity to shock in the apparatus. The anti-punishment effect of BW 723C86 was opposed by prior treatment with the 5-HT2/2B receptor antagonist, SB-206553 (10 and 20 mg/kg p.o. 1 h pre-test), and the selective 5-HT2B receptor antagonist, SB-215505 (1 and 3 mg/kg p.o. 1 h pre-test), but not by the selective 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, SB-242084 (5 mg/kg p.o.), or the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY 100635 (0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg s.c. 30 min pre-test). Thus, the anti-punishment action of BW 723C86 is likely to be 5-HT2B receptor mediated. This is consistent with previous reports that BW 723C86 exhibited anxiolytic-like properties in both the social interaction and Geller-Seifter conflict tests.", 
    "55": "N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists and gamma-aminobutyric acid agonists share a number of common pharmacological properties, including motor and anticonvulsant effects. In the present study, site-selective NMDA antagonists were evaluated for potential anxiolytic efficacy and motor impairment in a modified Geller-Seifter conflict procedure, an animal model widely used to screen drugs for anxiolytic effects. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to respond for food reward under a multiple FI 30 s (food only), FR 10 (food + shock) operant schedule. Consistent with the results of previous studies, the benzodiazepines chlordiazepoxide and diazepam selectively increased punished responding and increased response durations at higher doses. The competitive NMDA antagonist CGP 37,849 increased punished responding at some doses, though not selectively, and also increased response duration in both schedule components. The glycine-site modulators milacemide, ACEA 1011 and ACEA 1021, the NR2B-selective polyamine site antagonist eliprodil and NMDA did not produce anticonflict effects at any dose and had inconsistent effects on response durations. These results suggest that the anticonflict effects of NMDA antagonists are not as reliable as those of the benzodiazepines. Further research is needed to clarify the experimental conditions under which the anxiolytic potential of NMDA antagonists is most evident.", 
    "56": "Cortico-thalamic glutamatergic afferents control neuronal activity in the neostriatum. Cholinergic interneurons modulate the activity of medium spiny neurons through both pre- and post-synaptic actions via the activation of muscarinic receptors. The muscarinic pre-synaptic modulation was analyzed electrophysiologically. The transmitter release, induced by 4-AP, was studied and the block of paired pulse facilitation (PPF) by different muscarinic receptor antagonists was analyzed. The GABA(A) antagonist bicuculline isolated the glutamatergic transmission. Muscarinic agonists decreased the frequency of random synaptic potentials induced by 4-AP in about 60% of the cases without changes in input resistance (RN) of the post-synaptic neuron or in the mean amplitude of the synaptic events; indicating a presynaptic action. The administration of both 1 microM carbachol or 20 nM muscarine increased PPF. Muscarinic receptor antagonists blocked this action with a potency order: 3-alpha-chloroimperialine > 4-DAMP>AFDX-116 > or = gallamine > pirenzepine. The IC50's for the first three antagonists were (nM): 0.65, 1.1, and 3.0. Their respective Hill coefficients were: 1.9, 1.4, and 1.3. 3-alpha-Chloroimperialine reduced the PPF almost completely. The M3 and the M2 muscarinic receptor antagonists 4-DAMP and AFDX-116, given at saturating concentrations, consistently blocked only a part of the PPF but had additive effects when given together. These data are consistent with the existence of both M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors in striatal glutamatergic afferents.", 
    "57": "We have isolated a cDNA clone from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that encodes a protein of greatest sequence similarity to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. This gene codes for a polypeptide of 682 amino acids containing seven putative transmembrane domains. The amino acid identities, excluding a highly variable middle portion of the third intracellular loop, to the human m1-m5 receptors are 28-34%. When this cloned receptor was coexpressed with a G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channel (GIRK1) in Xenopus oocyte, acetylcholine was able to elicit the GIRK current. This acetylcholine-induced current was substantially inhibited by the muscarinic antagonist atropine in a reversible manner. However, another muscarinic agonist oxotremorine and antagonists scopolamine and pirenzepine had little or negligible effects on this receptor. Taken together, these results suggest that the cloned gene encodes a G protein-linked acetylcholine receptor that is most similar to but pharmacologically distinct from muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.", 
    "58": "Monitoring the depth of sedation in patients under intensive care is difficult. Clinical assessment by the different scoring systems produces insufficient information, especially once deeply sedated patients become unresponsive to any external stimulation. Recently, the bispectral index (BIS), the result of computerized bispectral electroencephalographic monitoring, was found to be the best predictor of depth of anaesthesia during surgical intervention. This report concerns BIS monitoring in 18 randomly selected, deeply sedated, surgical patients in the intensive care unit, who were unresponsive to standard clinical stimulation (Ramsay sedation score). A wide range of BIS was observed, with 15 of the patients having a BIS below 60, indicating a state of deep sedation (or possibly over-sedation). Therefore, further studies using BIS monitoring in patients under intensive care are needed to determine if this method can guide sedation and prevent oversedation in this context and, most importantly, to analyse its final cost-benefit ratio.", 
    "59": "Epilepsy research using positron emission tomography (PET) has advanced our understanding of the pathophysiology and neurochemical correlates of both focal and generalized epilepsies, but from the clinical viewpoint its major contribution has been in the presurgical evaluation of patients with medically intractable partial seizures. Depending on the tracer used, PET may provide information on regional cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism, and the binding of specific ligands to receptors that are thought to be related to the genesis and propagation of epileptic activity. In this communication, we discuss the diagnostic yield, limitations and perspectives of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and 11C-flumazenil (FMZ) PET in partial epilepsies. The current evidence regarding the pathophysiology of the focal changes is also presented, with an emphasis on issues which must be carefully addressed for effective and reliable clinical research.", 
    "60": "Study of the solubilization of commercial grades of soya phosphatidylcholine (SPC) with different purities by bile salts (BS) indicated that only highly pure grades of SPC are suitable for the preparation of clear solutions of BS/SPC-mixed micelles (BS/SPC-MM). The solubilizing capacity of different BS towards SPC increased in the following order; Sodium cholate (SC) < sodium deoxycholate (SDC) < sodium glycocholate (SGC). Moreover, egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC) was solubilized to a higher extent than SPC. Furthermore, the solubility study of different drugs in the prepared MM showed substantial enhancement of solubility, the extent of which is essentially affected by the chemical nature of the drug and the composition of MM. Benzodiazepine drugs such as clonazepam, tetrazepam, diazepam, and lorazepam displayed higher affinity for MM compared with BS alone, whereas steroidal drugs, such as estradiol, prednisolone and progesterone, compared with benzodiazepines, displayed relatively higher affinity for BS alone. The solubilizing capacity of MM for the different drugs was increased to different degrees by the addition of benzyl alcohol which was comparable to the solubility of the drug in pure benzyl alcohol. The interaction between benzyl alcohol and the drug in MM could be proved by NMR.", 
    "61": "A survey of hypnotic use in geriatric institutions outside hospitals was performed in the county of Hordaland, Norway. The data were obtained from the cardex system in 67 institutions and represented administration of hypnotics to the patients on 3 separate days within a week. About 24% of 2802 patients in the institutions used hypnotics. The number of patients treated with hypnotics, the doses administrated and the time of administration were similar for weekends and workdays. About 98% of the hypnotics were used as scheduled, and 41% of the doses administrated were higher than the recommended lowest dose for elderly patients. Long-acting benzodiazepines constituted about 62% of the hypnotics. A significantly higher proportion of patients in old age homes used hypnotics compared to patients in nursing homes (30.7% versus 22.9%, respectively, p < 0.01). Furthermore, higher doses, administration later in the evening and use of additional hypnotics were more common in old age homes compared to nursing homes. The results indicate a need for frequent reevaluation of prescribing of hypnotics in geriatric institutions.", 
    "62": "In previous work, midazolam was injected intrathecally and produced reversible, segmental, spinally mediated anti-nociception sufficient for abdominal surgery in a rat model. The neurotoxic effect of midazolam, alone or combined with fentanyl, injected intrathecally repeatedly on 15 occasions over a period of 1 month, was studied in the same model. We sought to establish whether this would produce neurological damage or neurotoxic injury. Histopathological examination of the excised spinal cord and paraspinal tissues was carried out. Thirty Wistar strain rats with nylon catheters chronically implanted in the lumbar subarachnoid space were divided into five groups: group 1 (n = 6) received 40 microL of midazolam 0.1%; group 2 (n = 6) received 40 microL of fentanyl 0.005%; group 3 (n = 6) received 20 microL of midazolam 0.1% plus 20 microL of fentanyl 0.005%; group 4 (n = 6) received 40 microL of lignocaine 2%; group 5 (n = 6) received 40 microL of phenol in water. All substances were injected through the implanted catheters. The neurological recovery of all the animals in the four groups that received intrathecal midazolam alone, fentanyl alone, midazolam plus fentanyl and lignocaine alone was similar and complete. There were no significant differences in the histological changes in the neural tissues of these groups, despite repeated application of the test substances. Group 5 demonstrated the typical neurolytic lesions of phenol when injected intentionally into the subarachnoid space.", 
    "63": "The effects of halothane and isoflurane followed by subsequent administration of vecuronium on the QT interval have been investigated during the induction of anaesthesia. Fifty-eight children, ASA I, without cardiovascular and electrolyte abnormalities and not receiving any medication were studied. Anaesthesia was induced with either halothane (n = 28) or isoflurane (n = 30), and was maintained until the end of the study with end-tidal concentrations of 2.5-3%. Recordings of ECG, heart rate and systolic arterial pressure were obtained at the following times: prior to induction of anaesthesia; 1 and 3 min after stable end-tidal concentrations of the induction agent had been reached; 1 and 3 min following vecuronium administration; at the time of tracheal intubation; 1 and 3 min later. Halothane significantly shortened the QTc interval (P < 0.05); isoflurane prolonged it (P < 0.001). Heart rate decreased significantly after halothane administration (P < 0.01); in contrast, heart rate increased after induction of anaesthesia with isoflurane (P < 0.05), increasing further after laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation (P < 0.001). Systolic arterial pressure decreased significantly (P < 0.001) in both groups after induction of anaesthesia and remained decreased until the end of the study. It is concluded that halothane may be a better choice than isoflurane for children with a long QT interval.", 
    "64": "Pediatric anxiety disorders are common illnesses that, if left untreated, may induce academic, family, and interpersonal problems. Cognitive-behavioral techniques and other psychotherapeutic interventions may be adequate for the treatment of most anxiety disorders. For patients with severe symptoms or for whom psychotherapeutic approaches are not adequate, medications are indicated. Among the available medications, the SSRIs are currently the first choice; however, other medications, such as the benzodiazepines and the TCAs, may be used alone or sometimes in combination with the SSRIs. Caution with respect to medication interactions and side effects is indicated. In particular, long-term side effects in these medications have not been well studied.", 
    "65": "Anxiety disorders are heterogeneous and existing animal models do not discriminate specific types of anxiety. The elevated T-maze is being developed to fulfill this purpose. The apparatus consists of three elevated arms, one enclosed and two open. Inhibitory avoidance--representing learned fear--is measured by recording the time taken to leave the enclosed arm in three consecutive trials. Unconditioned fear is evaluated by recording the time to escape from the open arm. Restraining the animals at the end of the enclosed arm for 30 s did not change the first (baseline) withdrawal latency, indicating that rats are not escaping from the experimenter's hand. In addition, rats trained in a T-maze with the three arms enclosed did not show the usual increase in withdrawal latency over the three consecutive trials. These results indicate that open arm experience, not handling, motivates inhibitory avoidance learning. The same experiment also showed that the latency to leave the open arm did not undergo habituation over five consecutive trials, thereby providing evidence of an aversive motivation for this response. The anxiolytic agents diazepam (benzodiazepine), buspirone and ipsapirone (5-HT1A agonists) as well as ritanserin (5-HT2 antagonist) selectively impaired inhibitory avoidance while leaving one-way escape unchanged. Similar results were obtained with three putative anxiolytics: the 5-HT2B/2C antagonists SB 200646A and SER 082, and the 5-HT2A antagonist SR 46349B. However, RP 62203, another 5-HT2A antagonist, was ineffective on both tasks. In contrast to the above anxiolytics, the anxiogenic agents yohimbine, TFPP and mCPP facilitated inhibitory avoidance. Escape was not affected by yohimbine, but was moderately attenuated by the two 5-HT2C/2B agonists. The 5-HT releaser and uptake inhibitor D-fenfluramine tended to enhance inhibitory avoidance, while impairing one-way escape in a dose-dependent way. The antidepressant clomipramine also had an anxiogenic-like effect on inhibitory avoidance, but did not affect escape from the open arm. Conversely, the phenethylamine hallucinogen ALEPH 2 did not affect inhibitory avoidance while impairing escape. Nevertheless, the similar compound and 5-HT2A agonist DOI was devoid of any effect. Also ineffective were the psychomotor stimulants D,L-amphetamine and caffeine, the reversible monoaminoxidase-A inhibitor moclobemide and the neuroleptic haloperidol. Finally, micro-injection into the dorsal raphe nucleus of two drugs that stimulate 5-HT neurons, the excitatory amino acid kainic acid and the benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG 7142, facilitated inhibitory avoidance. Kainate also significantly impaired escape. In contrast, intra-raphe 8-OH-DPAT, which inhibits 5-HT neurons, selectively impaired inhibitory avoidance in a manner similar to systemically administered anxiolytics. These behavioral and pharmacological results support the view that inhibitory avoidance in the elevated T-maze may be related to generalized anxiety disorder, while one-way escape may be associated with panic disorder.", 
    "66": "Eight inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) individually specific to human cytochrome P-450 (P-450) 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C subfamily (2C8, 2C9, 2C18 and 2C19), 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5 were used to define the role of single P-450s in the metabolism of diazepam (DZ), 7-ethoxycoumarin (7-EC), and imipramine (IMI) in human liver microsomes (HLM). The MAbs were added combinatorially to six HLM samples. With DZ as a substrate, more than 80% of temazepam (TMZ) formation was inhibited in all six samples by the addition of MAb to 3A4/5, indicating an 80% contribution of 3A4/5 to TMZ formation. Nordiazepam formation was inhibited with MAbs to 2B6 (6-23%), 2C subfamily (12-61%) and 3A4/5 (14-45%). The MAbs to 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2D6, and 2E1 did not inhibit TMZ or nordiazepam formation; this indicates their noninvolvement in DZ metabolism. The MAb-defined P-450 contribution to 7-EC Odeethylation in six HLM samples was 17 to 60% for 2E1, 15 to 46% for 2A6, and 5 to 22% for 1A2, reflecting the role and variation of each P-450 in this activity. MAbs to 1A1, the 2C subfamily, 2D6, and 3A4/5 did not affect 7-EC metabolism in the HLM samples. IMI is metabolized mainly to 2-hydroxyimipramine by expressed 2C19 and 2D6, and desipramine (DIM) by expressed 1A2, 2C18, 2C19 and 2D6. Expressed 1A1, 2C9, and 3A4 showed low activities for the formation of DIM. Of six HLM samples, five showed IMI hydroxylation activity (0.35-2.6 nmol/min/nmol P-450) while one (HL43) lacked hydroxylation activity. All six HLM samples showed N-deethylation activity (0.74-1.4 nmol/min/nmol P-450). The MAb-determined contribution of 2D6 and 2C19 to 2-hydroxyimipramine formation ranged from 47 to 90% and from 0 to 49%, respectively, while HL43 did not show 2-hydroxylation. The role of P-450s involved in DIM formation varied for 2C19 (13-50%), 1A2 (23-41%), and 3A4 (8-26%). These studies demonstrate a system for identifying the quantitative metabolic role of single P-450s and their interindividual variability in a tissue containing multiple P-450s. The system using inhibitory MAbs is simple, precise, and applicable to any P-450-mediated catalytic activity including that for drugs, carcinogens, mutagens, toxic chemicals and endobiotics.", 
    "67": "SPME/semi-microcolumn HPLC (SPME/LC) was investigated to analyze benzodiazepines in human urine samples. SPME conditions such as extraction time, extraction temperature, salt concentration and pH of matrix, flush volume and desorption time were optimized by extracting various drugs from a prepared water matrix. Combination of adding saturated salts to the matrix and controlling pH ranged from neutral to weakly alkaline conditions makes the increase of extraction efficiency. Under optimal condition SPME/LC is more sensitive than direct HPLC analysis without the SPME process. The limits of detection (LODs) was several ppb level and the relative standard deviation (RSD) was < 15% when human urine samples were analyzed by this analytical system. The system is very useful and is enough to assay benzodiazepines in a human urine sample without tedious and complex analytical procedures. In this paper the applicability of SPME/LC to the analysis of benzodiazepines in human urine samples was reported. In addition, the extension to the evaluation of SPME/LC/MS system was also described.", 
    "68": "Chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE)-treated rats exhibited a kindling-like persistent increase in withdrawal hyperexcitability. The alteration of GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) function in the hippocampus was suggested as a possible mechanism underlying the hyperexcitability observed in CIE rats, because (1) GABA(A)R agonist (muscimol)-evoked 36Cl- efflux was decreased; (2) paired-pulse inhibition in the CA1 area, predominantly due to GABA(A)R-mediated recurrent inhibition, was persistently decreased; and (3) GABA(A)R subunit expression was altered in the hippocampus from CIE rats. To further characterize the functional alteration of GABA(A)R after CIE treatment, their sensitivity to acute ethanol, a steroid anesthetic (alphaxalone), and a benzodiazepine inverse agonist (DMCM; methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) were studied using either synaptically evoked GABA(A)R responses or exogenously applied muscimol-evoked responses in hippocampal slices. Bath application of ethanol (60 mM) enhanced the area of GABA(A)R-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in the hippocampal CA1 region from control and CIE rats, and this potentiation was significantly (p = 0.027) greater in CIE rats (98%) than in control rats (53%). The positive modulatory effect of alphaxalone (1 microM) on GABA(A)R-inhibitory postsynaptic potentials was not significantly different between control and CIE rats (p = 0.375), whereas alphaxalone allosterically increased [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the CA1 area only in CIE rats (by 20 to 25%, p < 0.01), but not in controls. On the other hand, the negative modulatory effect of DMCM (1 microM) on muscimol-evoked responses was significantly larger in CIE rats (p = 0.002). These results suggest that the sensitization of GABA(A)R to acute ethanol and benzodiazepine inverse agonists, and possibly neurosteroids, may underlie ethanol dependence after multiple ethanol withdrawal episodes. These altered pharmacological properties are most consistent with changes in the subunit composition in the CA1 area of this rat model of alcohol dependence.", 
    "69": "Prolonged alcohol (ethanol) consumption leads to the development of alcohol tolerance and cross-tolerance to some benzodiazepines and barbiturates. In contrast, rats undergoing alcohol withdrawal are sensitized to the anticonvulsant effects of the endogenous GABA(A) receptor modulator, 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP). Alterations in endogenous, cerebral cortical levels of 3alpha,5alpha-THP during alcohol withdrawal could contribute to the observed sensitization to 3alpha,5alpha-THP. Therefore, this study investigated plasma and brain levels of 3alpha,5alpha-THP, progesterone, and corticosterone during alcohol dependence and withdrawal in the rat. Plasma corticosterone, progesterone (a precursor of 3alpha,5alpha-THP) and 3alpha,5alpha-THP levels were unchanged in alcohol-dependent animals. Cerebral cortical levels of 3alpha,5alpha-THP decreased in dependent male animals, but not in dependent female rats. During alcohol withdrawal, plasma corticosterone and progesterone levels increased in male, but not female rats. However, neither plasma nor cerebral cortical 3alpha,5alpha-THP levels were altered from control levels in male or female rats during alcohol withdrawal. Plasma and brain levels of 3alpha,5alpha-THP were markedly higher in female compared with male rats. Cerebral cortical levels of 3alpha,5alpha-THP during the diestrus phase of the estrus cycle were approximately 4 to 6 ng/g, a concentration that may approach physiological relevance. These findings suggest that sensitization to 3alpha,5alpha-THP during alcohol withdrawal is not mediated by elevations in brain levels of endogenous 3alpha,5alpha-THP in male or female rats. However, elevations in circulating corticosterone and progesterone levels during ethanol withdrawal in male rats may underlie gender differences in allopregnanolone sensitivity during ethanol withdrawal.", 
    "70": "Phencyclidine (PCP) can induce a model psychosis in humans that mimics the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. In the social interaction test PCP induces stereotyped behaviour and social isolation in rats, and these behaviours can be inhibited by antipsychotic drugs. In order to further evaluate the predictive validity of this model of schizophrenia the anxiolytic diazepam (0.02-17.5 micromol/kg; 0.005-5.0 mg/kg), the antidepressant citalopram (0.62-19.8 micromol/kg; 0.3-4.0 mg/kg), the opioid agonist methadone (0.36-5.8 micromol/kg; 0.13-2.0 mg/kg) and the opioid antagonist naloxone (0.34-22.0 micromol/kg; 0.13-8.0 mg/kg) were tested as examples of drugs without antipsychotic activity. The experiments demonstrated that these compounds did not specifically inhibit the behavioural effects of PCP. So far only antipsychotic drugs have been able to specifically inhibit the PCP-induced behaviours.", 
    "71": "The elevated plus-maze is a commonly used model to identify putative anxiolytic and anxiogenic drugs. However, the validity of elevated plus-maze and other recently developed variants such as the elevated zero-maze has recently been questioned on the grounds that both the reference anxiolytic drug chlordiazepoxide and the psychostimulant d-amphetamine increase open arm exploration and stimulate locomotor activity. These findings suggest that measures of \"anxiety\" in the elevated maze cannot be adequately dissociated from simple changes in locomotor activity, which may confound the interpretation of results obtained using these models. A variety of approaches to assess drug effects on locomotor activity in the elevated maze have been suggested, including the use of total and closed arm entries, as well as supplementary tests such as exploration of the holeboard apparatus. However, all these approaches utilise the measurement of exploration in a novel environment, and as such, could potentially be influenced by either changes in anxiety or locomotor activity. Recently, it has been shown that ethological measures of \"risk assessment\", such as stretched-attend postures and head-dipping, are sensitive indicators of drug-effects in the elevated maze. The present study assessed the utility of ethological analysis in dissociating locomotor activity from \"anxiety\" by comparing the effects of d-amphetamine to those of chlordiazepoxide in the rat elevated zero-maze. The results showed that both chlordiazepoxide and d-amphetamine increase the amount of time spent in the open arms and reduce \"risk assessment\" without increasing line crossing or rearing. These results confirm that under certain test conditions, psychostimulants are capable of producing \"false-positives\" in elevated maze models, and that both traditional methods and the ethological measures used in this study fail to unequivocally dissociate drug effects on anxiety from effects on locomotor activity. Further studies using other species and different classes of psychostimulants are warranted to determine the generality of these findings.", 
    "72": "Anxiolytic-like activity in the mouse elevated plus-maze has recently been demonstrated for a range of compounds varying in degree of selectivity as 5-HT1A receptor antagonists. As tolerance and dependence liability are among the major clinical disadvantages of benzodiazepine therapy, the present study examined the effects of acute drug challenge on the plus-maze profiles of mice following daily treatment for 20 days with saline, chlordiazepoxide (CDP; 10.0 mg/kg) or the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY 100635 (0.1-1.0 mg/kg). To assess the development of physical dependence (withdrawal anxiogenesis), the study incorporated independent groups of animals tested on the maze 24 h after the final dose. Challenge with CDP or WAY 100635 produced behavioural changes indicative of anxiety reduction in mice that had received daily handling/saline for 20 days, thereby demonstrating that the chronic injection regimen per se had not compromised the acute efficacy of either agent. The absence of a similar response to acute drug challenge in mice treated chronically with CDP or WAY 100635 suggested the development of tolerance to the acute anxiolytic effects of both compounds under present test conditions. Despite these observations, however, no signs of enhanced anxiety were evident 24 h following discontinuation of chronic treatment with either compound. In a further experiment, the absence of withdrawal anxiogenesis at 24 h was replicated and extended to discontinuation periods of 36 and 48 h for both drugs. Although present results show that tolerance develops to the acute anxiolytic effects of CDP and WAY 100635 in the murine plus-maze, they also suggest that enhanced anxiety is not an inevitable consequence of abrupt cessation of chronic treatment with either compound.", 
    "73": "The aim of the present study was to ascertain whether withdrawal from alprazolam can increase anxiety-like and aggressive behavior during intra species conflict in mice and, if so, whether a partial benzodiazepine agonist Ro 19-8022 is able to reverse these behavioral changes without untoward effects such as sedation. An experimental model consisting of interactions of pairs of singly-housed male mice with non-aggressive group-housed male mice was used. Alprazolam (1 mg/kg) was given orally twice daily for 8 days and once on the 9th day. When withdrawn from alprazolam (3 days after the last dose), mice reduced social investigation and increased the incidence of aggressive behavior in comparison to the pre-withdrawal level. However, the increase of aggression was moderate and occurred only in subjects with low pre-treatment levels of aggression. Ro 19-8022 (10 mg/kg) significantly antagonized the decrease of social behavior and the increase of aggression after alprazolam withdrawal without causing sedation or ataxia.", 
    "74": "Psychoactive drugs (Fluprazine and Chlordiazepoxide--CDP) were used as probes to test both differences or similarities in neurochemical substrates (proximal causations) and adaptive significance (ultimate causations) of different forms of intraspecific aggression in wild mice and laboratory Swiss CD-1 counterparts. Fluprazine (1-5 mg/kg) inhibited maternal attack on female, but not on male intruders. Thus, phenotypically different attack behaviors (offence and defence respectively) which have different functions may be modulated by different neurochemical substrates. Intrasexual attack and infanticide which are phenotypically different, but share similar functions (i.e. competition for mates and resources) were equally inhibited by Fluprazine (2 mg/kg) both in males and females of wild and laboratory mice. This indicates that the neural substrates of these behaviors are related and similarly regulated in the two sexes. Fluprazine was used to test the prediction of the evolutionary model on fighting strategies in male-male asymmetric contests as far as fighting ability and resource value (mating and cohabitation with a female) are concerned. Fluprazine inhibited the intensity of fighting (i.e. more 'defensive' behavioral phenotype of attack) only in animals without previous positive fighting experience, suggesting that different behavioral strategies are based on different neurochemical modulation. Experience of attack also influenced the effects of CDP (2.5-5 mg/kg) in both lactating females and male resident mice. The reported proaggressive effects of benzodiazepines were observed only in animals with prior fighting experience in both cases. Thus the understanding of the effects of drugs on behavior demands consideration of the biological variability (e.g. genetic, previous experience and/or interindividual differences) and the adaptive significance of behavior in the experimental context. On this background ethopharmacology can be defined as an evolutionary approach to the study of a drugs effect on neurochemical mechanisms and functions of behavior.", 
    "75": "It is unclear whether GABA(A) receptor-mediated hyperpolarizing and depolarizing synaptic potentials (IPSP(A)s and DPSP(A)s, respectively) are evoked by (a) the same populations of GABAergic interneurones and (b) exhibit similar regulation by allosteric modulators of GABA(A) receptor function. We have attempted to address these questions by investigating the effects of (a) known agonists for presynaptic receptors on GABAergic terminals, and (b) a range of GABA(A) receptor ligands, on each response. The GABA uptake inhibitor NNC 05-711 (10 microM) enhanced whereas bicuculline (10 microM) inhibited both IPSP(A)s and DPSP(A)s. (-)-Baclofen (5 microM), [D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAGO; 0.5 microM), and carbachol (10 microM) caused substantial depressions (up to 99%) of DPSP(A)s that were reversed by CGP 55845A (1 microM), naloxone (10 microM) and atropine (5 microM), respectively. In contrast, 2-chloroadenosine (CADO; 10 microM) only slightly depressed DPSP(A)s. Quantitatively, the effect of each agonist was similar to that reported for IPSP(A)s. The neurosteroid ORG 21465 (1 - 10 microM), the anaesthetic propofol (50-500 microM), the barbiturate pentobarbitone (100-300 microM) and zinc (50 microM) all enhanced DPSP(A)s and IPSP(A)s. The benzodiazepine (BZ) agonist flunitrazepam (10-50 microM) and inverse agonist DMCM (1 microM) caused a respective enhancement and inhibition of both IPSP(A)s and DPSP(A)s. The BZomega1 site agonist zolpidem (10-30 microM) produced similar effects to flunitrazepam. The anticonvulsant loreclezole (1-100 microM) did not affect either response. These data demonstrate that similar populations of inhibitory interneurones can generate both IPSP(A)s and DPSP(A)s by activating GABA(A) receptors that are subject to similar allosteric modulation.", 
    "76": "Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from single cultured cortical neurones have been used to study the action of (RS)-2-amino-3-[5-tert-butyl-3-(phosphonomethoxy)-4-isoxazolyl+ ++]propionic acid (ATPO), which has previously been proposed to be a potent selective antagonist of 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolyl)propionic acid (AMPA) receptors. ATPO competitively reduced peak responses evoked by semi-rapid applications of AMPA (Ki = 16 microM) but had variable effects on plateau responses, which were on average unchanged. Following blockade of AMPA receptor desensitization by cyclothiazide (CTZ, 100 microM), the plateau responses were reduced by ATPO to a similar extent as the peak responses, indicating that ATPO reduces desensitization of AMPA receptors. Semi-rapid application of kainic acid (KA) and the KA receptor-selective agonist, (2S,4R)-4-methylglutamic acid (MeGlu) evoked non-desensitizing responses which were competitively antagonized by ATPO (Ki values: 27 and 23 microM, respectively). Responses to MeGlu were unaffected by CTZ (100 microM), but potentiated 3 fold following blockade of KA receptor desensitization by concanavalin A (Con A, 300 microg ml(-1)). Responses of spinal cord neurones to MeGlu were blocked by ATPO to a similar extent before and after blockade of KA receptor desensitization by Con A. Although selectively potentiated by Con A, plateau responses to MeGlu were reduced by 69.6% by the AMPA selective antagonist, GYKI 53655 (10 microM). The remaining component was further reduced by ATPO with a Ki of 36 microM, which was not significantly different from that in the absence of GYKI 53655, but was greater than that on responses to AMPA. It is concluded that ATPO is a moderate-potency competitive inhibitor of naturally expressed non-NMDA receptors.", 
    "77": "1. As changes in core body temperature are generally associated with concomitant changes in sleep propensity, it is possible that the effects of hypnotic/soporific agents may be related to changes in thermoregulation. Therefore, to increase our knowledge of the mechanisms by which these agents exert their soporific effects, we compared the thermoregulatory and soporific effects of temazepam (20 mg per os (p.o.)) with those of melatonin (5 mg p.o.) when administered at 14.00 h to 20 young healthy adults (13 male, 7 female; age, 23.5 +/- 0.4 years). 2. From 08.00 to 20.30 h, subjects lay in bed, and foot and rectal (Tc) temperatures were recorded. Sleep onset latency (SOL) was measured using 20 min multiple sleep latency tests, performed hourly from 11.00 to 20.00 h, during which time heart rate was recorded. 3. Compared with placebo, both melatonin and temazepam significantly reduced Tc (-0.17 +/- 0.02 and -0.15 +/- 0.03 C, respectively) and SOL (by 4.8 +/- 1.49 and 6.5 +/- 1.62 min, respectively). Although both treatments significantly increased heat loss, only melatonin demonstrated cardiac effects. Importantly, there was a temporal relationship between minimum SOL and the maximum rate of decline in Tc for both melatonin (r = 0.48) and temazepam (r = 0.44). 4. A possible role of thermoregulation in sleep initiation is suggested by the similar temporal relationship between Tc and SOL for two different classes of soporific agents.", 
    "78": "Exposure to hostile conditions initiates the secretion of several hormones, including corticosterone/cortisol, catecholamines, prolactin, oxytocin, and renin, as part of the survival mechanism. Such conditions are often referred to as \"stressors\" and can be divided into three categories: external conditions resulting in pain or discomfort, internal homeostatic disturbances, and learned or associative responses to the perception of impending endangerment, pain, or discomfort (\"psychological stress\"). The hormones released in response to stressors often are referred to as \"stress hormones\" and their secretion is regulated by neural circuits impinging on hypothalamic neurons that are the final output toward the pituitary gland and the kidneys. This review discusses the forebrain circuits that mediate the neuroendocrine responses to stressors and emphasizes those neuroendocrine systems that have previously received little attention as stress-sensitive hormones: renin, oxytocin, and prolactin. Anxiolytic drugs of the benzodiazepine class and other drugs that affect catecholamine, GABAA, histamine, and serotonin receptors alter the neuroendocrine stress response. The effects of these drugs are discussed in relation to their effects on forebrain neural circuits that regulate stress hormone secretion. For psychological stressors such as conditioned fear, the neural circuits mediating neuroendocrine responses involve cortical activation of the basolateral amygdala, which in turn activates the central nucleus of the amygdala. The central amygdala then activates hypothalamic neurons directly, indirectly through the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and/or possibly via circuits involving brainstem serotonergic and catecholaminergic neurons. The renin response to psychological stress, in contrast to those of ACTH and prolactin, is not mediated by the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and is not suppressed by benzodiazepine anxiolytics. Stressors that challenge cardiovascular homeostasis, such as hemorrhage, trigger a pattern of neuroendocrine responses that is similar to that observed in response to psychological stressors. These neuroendocrine responses are initiated by afferent signals from cardiovascular receptors which synapse in the medulla oblongata and are relayed either directly or indirectly to hypothalamic neurons controlling ACTH, prolactin, and oxytocin release. In contrast, forebrain pathways may not be essential for the renin response to hemorrhage. Thus current evidence indicates that although a diverse group of stressors initiate similar increases in ACTH, renin, prolactin, and oxytocin, the specific neural circuits and neurotransmitter systems involved in these responses differ for each neuroendocrine system and stressor category.", 
    "79": "A two-stage strategy was used to identify and confirm quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with the changes in locomotor activity induced by a 1.5 gm/kg ethanol challenge. For stage 1, putative QTLs were identified by analysis of the strain means for 25 strains of the BXD recombinant inbred (RI) series (males only). QTLs were identified on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, and 6. The activity response to chlordiazepoxide generated similar QTLs on chromosomes 2 and 6. None of the QTLs were similar to those generated from analysis of the saline response data. For stage 2, 900 male C57BL/6J (B6) x DBA/2J (D2) F2 intercross animals were phenotyped for ethanol response, and the phenotypic extremes (those animals > and <1 SD from the mean) were identified. These extremes differed by >10,000 cm/15 min in their response to ethanol. The extreme progeny were used for a genome-wide scan both to confirm the putative RI-generated QTLs and to detect new QTLs. The F2 analysis generated no new QTLs with logarithm of the likelihood for linkage (LOD) scores >3. For RI-generated QTLs, only the QTL on chromosome 2 was confirmed (LOD = 5.3). The position of the peak LOD was estimated to be 47 cM with a 20 cM 1 LOD support interval; this QTL accounted for 6% of the phenotypic variance. The 1 LOD support interval overlaps with QTLs previously identified for alcohol preference and acute ethanol withdrawal (;; ).", 
    "80": "Sedating children can facilitate minor laceration repair by minimizing physical and psychic discomfort. However, some clinicians are reluctant to use sedation, in part because of concern about increased patient charges and fear that the emergency department (ED) stay will be prolonged. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which sedative use during the repair of simple facial lacerations in children increased the length of ED stay and patient charges.", 
    "81": "This was a retrospective cohort study of 152 children with small, simple, facial lacerations. Patients with complex lacerations and those requiring specialty consultation were excluded. Patients, at the discretion of the treating physician, received either intramuscular ketamine (n = 14), intranasal or rectal midazolam (n = 38), or no sedation (n = 100). Length of ED stay and the total patient charges were analyzed.", 
    "82": "Groups were equal with respect to age, sex, and length of the wound. The mean patient time in the ED, from placement in examination room to discharge, was significantly longer for those given ketamine (149+/-37 minutes) and midazolam (98+/-31 minutes) compared with those given no sedation (82+/-28 minutes). Patient charges were also higher in those given ketamine ($695+/-172) or midazolam ($498+/-153) compared with those receiving no sedation ($390+/-86).", 
    "83": "The results of this study demonstrate that sedation with ketamine or midazolam increases the length of ED stay compared with using no sedation. However, the increased lengths of stay were modest, particularly for midazolam. Fear of prolonged recovery time should not dissuade clinicians from using either sedative for minor procedures. The patient charges are considerably higher with both midazolam and ketamine, but they may not reflect the actual cost of patient care.", 
    "84": "Status epilepticus is more common among children than young adults. Children might be less likely to die and might be resistant to permanent neurologic damage due to status epilepticus, but significant sequelae also have been demonstrated. Aggressive intervention and rapid termination of seizures contribute significantly to better prognosis and reduced mortality from status epilepticus. Initial treatment of status epilepticus typically consists of either diazepam or lorazepam, immediately followed by phenytoin or phenobarbital. However, approximately 100% to 15% of status epilepticus episodes are refractory to these conventional therapies. Traditionally, refractory status epilepticus is treated with barbiturate coma or general anesthetics, both of which require invasive cardiorespiratory and hemodynamic monitoring and are associated with significant complications. Midazolam is a water-soluble benzodiazepine with a fast onset of action, a short half-life, and inactive metabolites that has been very effective in terminating seizures refractory to diazepam, lorazepam, phenytoin, and phenobarbital in pediatric patients. Midazolam is a valuable treatment option for refractory status epilepticus, especially in pediatric patients.", 
    "85": "We describe the case of a patient who experienced postanoxic action myoclonus after a transient cardiopulmonary arrest. Whereas benzodiazepines (clonazepam, midazolam, diazepam) were inefficient, valproic acid allowed a full control of the myoclonus. It is essential that the distinction between postanoxic action myoclonus and posthypoxic seizures is made early to avoid a delayed appropriate therapy and erroneous prognostic conclusions.", 
    "86": "Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies have been made on a few non-benzodiazepine series of compounds such as 3-substituted imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazines, 2-phenylimidazo[1,2-alpha]pyridines, 2-(alkoxycarbonyl) imidazo[2,1-b]benzothiazoles, and 2-arylquinolines. For the first series of compounds a Fujita-Ban approach has been followed, which revealed the highest activity contribution for 3,4-OCH2O group of 2-phenyl moiety and for a methoxy group at 6-position. For the rest of the series, a Hansch approach has been adopted. The hydrophobic and electronic properties of the various substituents have been found to play major roles in the binding of these compounds with the receptor. Based on these studies, a hypothetical model for the drug-receptor interaction has been proposed.", 
    "87": "Kainate receptors are abundantly expressed in the hippocampus. Mice with disruption of kainate receptor subunits allow the genetic dissection of the role of each kainate receptor subunits in the synaptic physiology of the hippocampus, as well as in excitotoxic processes. We have compared the action of domoate and kainate on CA1 pyramidal neurons in slices from wild-type and GluR6-/- mice. The difference in the amplitude of inward currents evoked by domoate and kainate between wild-type and GluR6-/- mice demonstrates the presence of functional kainate receptors in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Block of domoate-activated inward currents by the AMPA receptor antagonists 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfonyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline (1 microM) and 1-(4-aminophenyl)-3-methylcarbamyl-4-methyl7, 8-methylenedioxy-3,4-dihydro-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine) (GYKI 53655) (50 microM) is complete in GluR6-/- mice but only partial in wild-type mice. In the presence of GYKI 53655, kainate receptor activation dramatically increases the frequency of spontaneous IPSCs in CA1 pyramidal cells from wild-type, as well as GluR6-/-, mice. This results from the kainate receptor-mediated activation of a sustained inward current and an increased action potential firing in afferent GABAergic interneurons of the CA1 field. These effects are observed in wild-type, as well as GluR6-/-, mice. Kainate receptors also decrease the amplitude of evoked IPSCs in CA1 pyramidal cells by increasing synaptic failures in wild-type and GluR6-/- mice. These results indicate that in CA1 pyramidal cells, distinct subtypes of kainate receptors mediate several functionally antagonistic effects.", 
    "88": "GABAA-mediated miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) were recorded from layer V pyramidal neurons of the visual cortex using whole-cell patch-clamp recording in rat brain slices. At room temperature, the benzodiazepine site agonist zolpidem enhanced both the amplitude (to 138 +/- 26% of control value at 10 microM) and the duration (163 +/- 14%) of mIPSCs. The enhancement of mIPSC amplitude was not caused by an increase of the single-channel conductance of the postsynaptic receptors, as determined by peak-scaled non-stationary fluctuation analysis of mIPSCs. The effect of zolpidem on fast, synaptic-like (1 msec duration) applications of GABA to outside-out patches was also investigated. The EC50 for fast GABA applications was 310 microM. In patches, zolpidem enhanced the amplitude of currents elicited by subsaturating GABA applications (100-300 microM) but not by saturating applications (10 mM). The increase of mIPSC amplitude by zolpidem provides evidence that the GABAA receptors are not saturated during miniature synaptic transmission in the recorded cells. By comparing the facilitation induced by 1 microM zolpidem on outside-out patches and mIPSCs, we estimated the concentration of GABA seen by the postsynaptic GABAA receptors to be approximately 300 microM after single vesicle release. We have estimated a similar degree of receptor occupancy at room and physiological temperature. However, at 35 degreesC, zolpidem did not enhance the amplitude of mIPSCs or of subsaturating GABA applications on patches, implying that, in these neurons, zolpidem cannot be used to probe the degree of receptor occupancy at physiological temperature.", 
    "89": "The influence of CCK-A receptor antagonism on pancreatic exocrine secretion and duodenal EMG, and the mechanism(s) involved in CCK-induced pancreatic secretion were studied in conscious calves. Seven 1-week-old calves were fitted with a pancreatic duct catheter, duodenal cannula and duodenal electrodes. Pancreatic exocrine secretion and duodenal EMG were studied following intraduodenal CCK-A receptor antagonist (Tarazepide), intravenous atropine, and intravenous or intraduodenal CCK-8 administrations. Tarazepide decreased duodenal electric activity, reduced interdigestive pancreatic secretion, especially protein; reduced cephalic and early postprandial (milk) induced secretion of bicarbonate and protein. Pancreatic protein secretion to intravenous CCK-8 was little affected by atropine, but was significantly reduced by Tarazepide+/-atropine; in contrast, protein secretion to intraduodenal CCK-8 was abolished by Tarazepide or atropine. We conclude that pre- and especially early postprandial pancreatic secretion are partly controlled via CCK-A (mainly mucosal) mediated mechanisms.",

For each scaffold orientation, all potential fragments are attached to the scaffold, their interactions with the receptor are individually scored and factorial combinations of fragments are constructed. To test its effectiveness, this approach is compared to two simple control algorithms. Our method is more efficient than the controls at selecting best scoring molecules and at selecting fragments for the construction of an exhaustive combinatorial library. We also carried out a retrospective analysis of the experimental results of a 10 x 10 x 10 exhaustive combinatorial library. An enrichment factor of approximately 4 was found for identifying the compounds in the library that are active at 330 nM.",

Nursing involvement may range from age-appropriate preparation of the patient and family to administration of conscious sedation agents. Meticulous nursing assessment of the child, family, and environment facilitates identifying and meeting client needs related to flexible bronchoscopy. Preparation of the physical environment as well as physiological and psychological preparation of the child increase the likelihood of a positive experience.

    "92": "The non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, dizocilpine (0.25 mg/kg), has previously been shown to block the development of tolerance to the sedative effects of diazepam (2 mg/kg). Since there is considerable evidence that different mechanisms underlie the development of tolerance to the sedative and anxiolytic effects of diazepam, the present experiment examined whether dizocilpine would block the development of tolerance to diazepam's anxiolytic effects. Rats tested after an acute dose of diazepam (2 mg/kg) showed an anxiolytic effect, measured by an increase in the time spent in social interaction, whereas those tested after 21 days of treatment had scores equal to the control group. This development of tolerance was not blocked by concomitant administration of dizocilpine (0.25 mg/kg). Thus, these results provide further evidence that the mechanism underlying tolerance to the anxiolytic effects of diazepam is different from that underlying tolerance to the sedative effects.", 
    "93": "An in vitro model of ischemia was developed and characterized using the acute rat hippocampal slice preparation. Neuroprotective concentrations of several competitive and noncompetitive glutamate subtype-selective antagonists (CGS-19755, MK-801, YM90K and GYKI-52466) were initially determined in anoxia-enhanced agonist-induced excitotoxicity experiments. Concentrations which proved to be effective in these studies were subsequently tested for their effectiveness against an ischemic episode. Ischemia was defined as a 30-min exposure to aglycemic media ending in 5 min of concurrent anoxia, a protocol which was arrived at by empirically determining the effect of various hypoglycemic and anoxic insults on the ability of hippocampal slices to retain their electrophysiological viability. Exposure to such an ischemic episode resulted in a loss of viability by most slices, an effect which was strongly dependent on extracellular calcium. AMPA antagonists applied alone produced no neuroprotective effect in the present model of in vitro ischemia, while NMDA antagonists applied alone had a modest neuroprotective effect. In contrast, the coapplication of 10 microM MK-801 and 300 microM GYKI-52466, noncompetitive NMDA and AMPA receptor antagonists, respectively, resulted in almost complete neuroprotection. This protection was comparable to that obtained by withholding extracellular calcium, indicating that the toxic effects of glutamate receptor overstimulation can be accounted for solely by calcium influx. The effect of this combination treatment on the survival rate of hippocampal slices was synergistic, that is greater than the sum of the effects of the individual compounds. The results indicate that neuroprotection against acute ischemic insults may require a combination therapy approach.", 
    "94": "We examined in mice the effect of chronic diazepam treatment on the sensitivity to isoflurane, and that of repeated isoflurane exposure on the sensitivity to diazepam. Mice were divided into four groups: group 1, treated with diazepam, 10 mg/kg i.p. twice daily; group 2, vehicle-treated controls; group 3, exposed to 3% isoflurane for 25 min twice daily; and group 4, untreated controls. After 14 days the effect of the treatment was assessed. Twenty-four hours after the last 10 mg/kg diazepam treatment, groups 1 and 2 received diazepam, 5 mg/kg i.p., and were subjected to the horizontal wire test (HWT). All control mice but only 10% of the diazepam-treated mice failed the HWT. Groups 1 and 2 were then exposed to increasing concentrations of isoflurane. Diazepam-treated mice (group 1) lost the HWT at 0.7+/-0.7%, compared with 0.6+/-0.1% in controls (group 2) (P<0.001); the ED50 was 0.75% vs. 0.65%. Group 1 mice lost the righting reflex at 0.94+/-0.07% isoflurane vs. 0.87+/-0.06% in group 2 (P<0.01); the ED50 was 0.93% vs. 0.82%. Recovery time was 175+/-161 s in group 1 vs. 343+/-275 s in group 2 (P<0.02). Twenty-four hours after the last of the repeated exposures to isoflurane, we examined the responses of groups 3 and 4 to increasing concentrations of isoflurane. Mice in group 3 lost the righting reflex at 1.0+/-0.06% isoflurane vs. 0.9+/-0.04% in controls (group 4) (P<0.001); the ED50 was 0.96% vs. 0.85%. Recovery time was 113+/-124 s vs. 208+/-126 s in groups 3 and 4 (P<0.09). Diazepam, 3 mg/kg i.p. administered to groups 3 and 4, caused loss of the HWT reflex in 33% of group 3 mice and in 82% of controls (group 4) (P<0.001). It appears that prolonged exposure to both diazepam and isoflurane caused reduced sensitivity to each drug separately, as well as to the other drug. This finding may strengthen the theory that inhalational anesthetics may act via the same mechanism as the benzodiazepines.", 
    "95": "In the present study, the effects of benzodiazepines (diazepam) were evaluated in terms of cortical excitability changes, as tested with transcranial magnetic simulation (TMS). In particular, analyzed were drug-induced changes regarding two selected parameters of TMS: (1) the cortical excitability threshold and (2) the silent period duration (SP). For this purpose, we evaluated the effects of long-term therapy with diazepam in the patients affected by anxiety disorders and the changes induced by single oral doses of diazepam in both healthy controls and patients. In addition, we tested cortical excitability changes in two 'extreme conditions' where a considerable concentration of serum benzodiazepine-like activity was reached, as represented by diazepam overdose and idiopathic recurrent stupor (IRS). In both groups of patients, a significant increment of motor threshold was found, while in the overdose patients, the SP was also increased. The administration of flumazenil in these two conditions was followed by a prompt reversal effect, consisting of a return to normal cortical excitability parameters. The long-term usage of diazepam in patients with anxiety disorders is associated with significantly increased threshold; the increased value of these parameters was temporarily further enhanced by the administration of a single oral dose of diazepam, which, in normal control subjects, is not associated with changes of cortical excitability. The results of this study reveal that different physio-pathological conditions induced by the influence of benzodiazepine and its antagonist are reflected in excitability changes which attest to the involvement and modification of cortical GABAergic activity.", 
    "96": "Binding studies were used to assess the changes in affinity and/or number of M1 muscarinic receptors in hippocampi from juvenile rats chronically deprived of NGF. NGF deprivation was obtained by implanting into right ventricle at postnatal day 2 (P2) hybrydoma cells secreting high levels of monoclonal antibodies against NGF (alphaD11). Parenteral myeloma cells (P3U) were used as controls. Competition experiments were used to characterise the [3H]-PNZ binding sites in membrane preparations of hippocampi from rats sacrificed at P15. [3H]-PNZ bound M1 receptors both in P3U and alphaD11 group as shown by displacing potency order of antagonists: TLZ=4-DAMP>PNZ>p-F-HHSiD>MTC. The deprivation of NGF for two weeks significantly increased the number of M1 receptors without changing the Ki values of antagonists with exception of methoctramine which showed an increase in affinity in alphaD11 group. Similar changes in binding parameters were already observed after the first week of anti-NGF treatment. In contrast, a treatment for a week with implant at postnatal day 15 failed to produce any changes in M1 binding parameters. These results provide further physiological evidence for developmentally regulated modulatory role of NGF in the cholinergic function in the hippocampus.", 
    "97": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been shown to affect mood in health and disease. Evidence to date has demonstrated an antidepressant potential for low- and high-frequency rTMS treatment. In animal behavioral models of depression magnetic stimulation of the brain induced similar effects to those of electroconvulsive shock (ECS). In this study the effects of repeated rTMS on rat brain noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin and their metabolites levels, as well as on beta-adrenergic and 5-HT2 receptor characteristics were studied. After 10 days of treatment, beta-adrenergic receptors were significantly up regulated in the frontal cortex, down regulated in the striatum and were unchanged in the hippocampus. 5-HT2 receptors were down regulated in the frontal cortex and were not changed in the other brain areas. No change in benzodiazepine receptors in the frontal cortex and cerebellum were demonstrated. These findings demonstrate specific and selective alterations induced by repeated rTMS, which are distinct from those induced by other antidepressant treatments. TMS therapeutic effects in humans and behavioral and biochemical effects in animal, suggest that TMS has a unique mechanism of action which requires further investigation.", 
    "98": "Despite its great promise, small intestinal transplantation in some patients is complicated by difficult postoperative management. The reasons for this are complex. In a rat model of small intestinal transplantation, frequencies of migrating myoelectric complexes during fasting are reduced in ileal isografts and muscarinic receptor density is decreased. We hypothesized that the distribution of muscarinic 1 receptors localized to enteric neurons is altered after small intestinal transplantation. Distal small intestine was orthotopically transplanted in Lewis-to-Lewis donor-recipient combinations. At 3 months, transplanted and normal ileum was obtained to prepare membrane fractions. [N-methyl-3H]Scopolamine served as ligand, while scopolamine methylbromide, pirenzepine, and methoctramine were used in competitive homologous and heterologous displacement experiments. Receptor subtype models were examined by nonlinear regression analysis. In normal and transplanted ileum, heterologous displacement was consistent with three site models (P < 0.05). In normals, the muscarinic 1 receptor subtype was most abundant, with a relative distribution of 69 to 78%. There was a relative distribution of 13 to 16% for muscarinic 3 receptor subtype. After transplantation, the muscarinic 1 subtype decreased to a mean of 45% but the muscarinic 3 subtype increased to a mean of 42%. Using pirenzepine, mean pKD values were not different between the two groups. It is concluded that the decrease in muscarinic 1 receptor subtype after transplantation could be related to neuronal cell loss or to downregulation of the expression of muscarinic 1 receptors. The results did not support defective posttranslational processing of receptor proteins.", 
    "99": "Neuropsychiatric abnormalities, as well as the commonly associated neuropsychological symptoms, are clinical characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. Thus, in addition to a general cognitive and functional decline, neuropsychiatric manifestations, such as agitation, apathy, anxiety, psychoses and disinhibition, are frequently evident in AD patients. Such neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD are the source of considerable patient and caregiver distress, resulting in the prescription of neuroleptics, benzodiazepines or other psychotropic agents, and are a major factor in the decision to transfer the care of patients into nursing homes. Recent evidence suggests that some neuropsychiatric changes associated with AD are related to the cholinergic deficits in the brains of AD patients and that such abnormalities may be responsive to cholinergic therapy. Cholinergic drug therapies indicated for the symptomatic treatment of AD, for example tacrine and the newer cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors such as donepezil, have been demonstrated to improve memory, language and praxis. Furthermore, although less is known about the effect of ChE inhibitors on the neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD, preliminary evidence suggests that they reduce apathy, anxiety, hallucinations, disinhibition and aberrant motor behaviour. Thus, the newer-generation ChE inhibitors that are well tolerated, easy to administer and show promise in reducing the cognitive, as well as neuropsychiatric disturbances of AD, may emerge as important treatments for some neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with central cholinergic deficits, including AD.", 
    "100": "Scopolamine and lorazepam both produce anterograde impairments of explicit memory but only lorazepam impairs implicit memory as assessed by perceptual priming tasks. The main aim of the two experiments reported in this article was to determine the effects of these drugs on conceptual priming. Experiment 1 compared the effects of lorazepam (1,2 mg PO) with scopolamine (0.3,0.6 mg SC) and placebo in a study with 60 healthy volunteers. Experiment 2 compared the separate and combined effects of lorazepam (2 mg PO) and flumazenil (2 mg IV) with placebo in a study with 48 healthy volunteers. We found that conceptual priming in category generation tasks was intact following lorazepam in both studies. This preservation of conceptual priming contrasted with lorazepam-induced impairments on explicit memory tasks. In conjunction with previous findings, these results are interpreted as providing further support for the notion that conceptual and perceptual priming are subserved by distinct memory systems, one based on the operations of semantic memory, the other possibly based on a perceptual representation system. That lorazepam impairs perceptual but not conceptual priming suggests that the neurochemical substrates of the two kinds of priming are distinct.", 
    "101": "Olanzapine metabolism was investigated using incubation of olanzapine with human liver slices. The intent of the investigation was to identify olanzapine metabolites and determine if the human liver slice incubations could potentially produce quantities of the olanzapine glucuronides for future studies. Along with known Phase 1 olanzapine metabolites, N-desmethyl-, 2-hydroxymethyl-, and 4'-N-oxide-, a new hydroxylated species was detected. Detection of Phase 2 metabolites included known N-10-glucuronides, a quaternary glucuronide and a novel glucuronide conjugate. This investigation showed the feasibility of using human liver slices to produce sufficient quantities of olanzapine glucuronides for further studies.", 
    "102": "Recent reports of interactions between alcohol and benzodiazepines, tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants during their acute concomitant use are reviewed. Acute ingestion of alcohol (ethanol) with tranquilizers or hypnotics is responsible for several pharmacokinetic interactions that can have significant clinical implications. In general, metabolism of these drugs is delayed when combined with alcohol but some reports have suggested otherwise. The amount of alcohol consumed, the presence or absence of liver disease, and differences in the dosage and administration of these drugs may account for the observed discrepancies. In recent years, the cytochrome P450 (P450 or CYP) isoenzyme that catalyses the metabolism of these drugs has also been identified. However, since changes in the pharmacogenetic metabolism of benzodiazepines and tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants are mainly governed by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, caution is needed when used together with alcohol.", 
    "103": "Aim of this work is to prepare poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles by dialysis method without surfactant and to investigate drug loading capacity and drug release. The size of PLGA nanoparticles was 269.9 +/- 118.7 nm in intensity average and the morphology of PLGA nanoparticles was spherical shape from the observation of SEM and TEM. In the effect of drug loading contents on the particle size distribution, PLGA nanoparticles were monomodal pattern with narrow size distribution in the empty and lower drug loading nanoparticles whereas bi- or trimodal pattern was showed in the higher drug loading ones. Release of clonazepam from PLGA nanoparticles with higher drug loading contents was slower than that with lower loading contents.",

These were: (i) direct RT assay, for determination of IC50 values of RT inhibitors; (ii) RT template/primer binding inhibition (BIC) assay, for measuring the effect of various substances on the RT activity binding to template/primer; (iii) RT protein ELISA, for measuring RT protein binding to template/primer with a monoclonal antibody reactive against a peptide in the RNase H region. MSA-300 and delavirdine gave the lowest IC50 values, ranging from 0.17 microM to 0.24 microM for MSA-300 and from 0.12 microM to 0.38 microM for delavirdine, whereas higher IC50 values of approximately 20 microM were obtained for 9-CI-TIBO at all primer concentrations. None of the non-nucleoside substances had inhibiting effects on the binding of template, primer, or template/primer to RT protein. Their inhibition of RT activity was not due to prevention of RT binding to template/primer. TIBO, nevirapine and delavirdine bound to RT reversibly, and they bound more tightly to RT template/primer ternary than to RT template binary complex. MSA-300 showed a comparatively high affinity for the enzyme. The utility of the three assays in relation to screening and analysis of RT inhibitory substances is discussed.", 
    "105": "The effects of pharmacological challenges to the benzodiazepine receptors in the dorsal hippocampus and median raph\u00e9 nucleus were investigated in the social interaction and the elevated plus-maze tests of anxiety in rats. In the social interaction test, bilateral administration of midazolam (1 and 2 micrograms), into the dorsal hippocampus had anxiolytic effects; flumazenil (500 ng) was silent, but was able to antagonize the anxiolytic effects of midazolam (2 micrograms). In the social interaction test, midazolam was also anxiolytic when infused into the median raph\u00e9 nucleus; flumazenil (100 and 500 ng) increased locomotor activity, but did not change anxiety measures. As an anatomical control, midazolam (1 and 2 micrograms) was infused into the adjacent pontine reticular nucleus, and was without effect. In contrast to the social interaction test, local infusion of midazolam (1 and 2 micrograms) and flumazenil (100 and 500 ng) into either the dorsal hippocampus or the median raph\u00e9 nucleus failed to change anxiety measures in the elevated plus-maze (trials 1 and 2). These results show that stimulation of the benzodiazepine receptors in the hippocampus or the median raph\u00e9 nucleus leads to anxiolytic effects in the social interaction test, but not in the elevated plus-maze. It would therefore appear that the two tests detect different types of anxiety that are differentially modulated by GABAA-benzodiazepine receptors in the dorsal hippocampus and the median raph\u00e9 nucleus.",
