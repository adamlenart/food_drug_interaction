The administration of anesthesia is not always possible for patients prescribed ECT. Consequently, unmodified ECT is still widely practiced, especially in developing countries.", 
    "1": "We prospectively assessed musculoskeletal morbidity in consecutive patients who received unmodified bitemporal ECT during a part or the whole of their ECT course. All patients were pretreated with an intravenous benzodiazepine (usually diazepam, 10 mg) to effect sedation, anxiolysis, and limited skeletal muscle relaxation. Anteroposterior and lateral digital x-rays of the thoracolumbar spine were obtained after the last unmodified treatment.", 
    "2": "Fifty-six patients aged 11 to 49 years and with a mean body mass index of 23.0 received a total of 162 (mean, 2.9) unmodified ECTs. There was significant attenuation of psychopathology ratings. Against our expectations, no patient developed clinical or radiological evidence of orthopedic morbidity; however, in 2 patients, the x-rays revealed old spinal fractures. Twelve patients had spots of oral bleeding after ECT. Whereas 5 patients experienced mild, transient, self-limiting postictal confusion, only one had confusion which required medical termination. Five patients complained of body ache and one of memory impairment. There were no other adverse events.", 
    "3": "The complete absence of orthopedic morbidity with benzodiazepine-modified ECT contrasts with historical descriptions of a 20% to 40% risk with unmodified ECT. We speculate that the limited muscle relaxant action of the pre-ECT parenteral benzodiazepine may have had protective effects. If so, if ECT is urgently indicated but anesthesia and hence conventional muscle relaxants cannot be administered, benzodiazepine-modified ECT may be a safer alternative to unmodified ECT. This suggestion merits wide attention because of its public health importance in countries with poor medical infrastructure, where unmodified ECT is still widely practiced.", 
    "4": "SX-3228, 6-benzyl-3-(5-methoxy-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1,6-naphthyridin-2(1H)-one, is a newly-synthesized benzodiazepine receptor agonist intended to be developed as a tablet preparation. This compound, however, becomes chemically unstable due to decreased crystallinity when it undergoes mechanical treatments such as grinding and compression. A wet-granule tableting method, where wet granules are compressed before being dried, was therefore investigated as it has the advantage of producing tablets of sufficient hardness at quite low compression pressures. The results of the stability testing showed that the drug substance was chemically considerably more stable in wet-granule compression tablets compared to conventional tablets. Furthermore, the drug substance was found to be relatively chemically stable in wet-granule compression tablets even when high compression pressure was used and the effect of this pressure was small. After investigating the reason for this excellent stability, it became evident that near-isotropic pressure was exerted on the crystals of the drug substance because almost all the empty spaces in the tablets were occupied with water during the wet-granule compression process. Decreases in crystallinity of the drug substance were thus small, making the drug substance chemically stable in the wet-granule compression tablets. We believe that this novel approach could be useful for many other compounds that are destabilized by mechanical treatments.", 
    "5": "Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist with a \"ceiling effect\" for respiratory depression. Despite this, it has been associated with severe overdoses. Conflicting data exist regarding its response in overdose to naloxone. We compared clinical overdose characteristics of buprenorphine with heroin and methadone and assessed responses to naloxone and flumazenil. Patients admitted to two intensive care units with severe opioid overdoses were enrolled into this 4-year prospective study. Urine and blood toxicological screening were performed to identify overdoses involving predominantly buprenorphine, heroin, or methadone. Eighty-four patients with heroin (n = 26), buprenorphine (n = 39), or methadone (n = 19) overdoses were analyzed. In the buprenorphine group, sedative drug coingestions were frequent (95%), whereas in the methadone group, suicide attempts were significantly more often reported (p = .0007). Buprenorphine overdose induced an opioid syndrome not differing significantly from heroin and methadone in mental status (as measured by Glasgow Coma Score) or arterial blood gases. Mental status depression was not reversed in buprenorphine overdoses with naloxone (0.4-0.8 mg) but did improve with flumazenil (0.2-1 mg) if benzodiazepines were coingested. In conclusion, buprenorphine overdose causes an opioid syndrome clinically indistinguishable from heroin and methadone. Although mental status and respiratory depression are often unresponsive to low-dose naloxone, flumazenil may be effective in buprenorphine overdoses involving benzodiazepines.", 
    "6": "Ingestion of harmane and other alkaloids derived from plant Peganum harmala has been shown to elicit profound behavioural and toxic effects in humans, including hallucinations, excitation, feelings of elation, and euphoria. These alkaloids in the high doses can cause a toxic syndrome characterized by tremors and convulsions. Harmane has also been shown to act on a variety of receptor systems in the mammalian brain, including those for serotonin, dopamine and benzodiazepines. In animals, it has been reported to affect short and long term memory. In the present study, effects of dopamine D1 and D2 receptor antagonists on the harmane (HA)-induced amnesia and exploratory behaviors were examined in mice. One-trial step-down and hole-board paradigms were used for the assessment of memory retention and exploratory behaviors in adult male NMRI mice respectively. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of HA (5 and 10 mg/kg) immediately after training decreased memory consolidation, while had no effect on anxiety-like behavior. Memory retrieval was not altered by 15- or 30 min pre-testing administration of the D1 (SCH23390, 0.025, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) or D2 (sulpiride 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg) receptor antagonists, respectively. In contrast, SCH23390 (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) or sulpiride (25 and 50 mg/kg) pre-test administration fully reversed HA-induced impairment of memory consolidation. Finally, neither D1 nor D2 receptor blockade affected exploratory behaviors in the hole-board paradigm. Altogether, these findings strongly suggest an involvement of D1 and D2 receptors modulation in the HA-induced impairment of memory consolidation.", 
    "7": "Abstract Objective. The aim of this study was to explore the trends of prescribing potentially inappropriate benzodiazepine use (PIBU) and the risk of fractures in an elderly population in Taiwan. Methods. Retrospective administrative database analysis was conducted. Outpatient claim data were retrieved from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (LHID) between 2000 and 2003, which contains all inpatient and outpatient medical claims of approximately 23 million patients in Taiwan. All patients with the diagnosis of hip fractures (ICD codes) were identified from the database. The inappropriate use for the elderly was defined as a prescription with the dose of short- and long-acting BZD according to the 2003 version of Beers' criteria. Multiple logistic regressions were used to determine the association of PIBU with fractures. Results. A total of 62,023 elderly patients aged \u226765 years were retrieved from the database. The proportion of elderly patients taking short-and long-acting benzodiazepines declined significantly from 28.1 to 25% and 19.5 to 14.5% from 2000 to 2003, respectively (P<0.001). After adjustment for age, sex, co-morbidity, other medications in one prescription and all of the covariates, the risk of hip fractures (\u223c50%) was still statistically significant (adjusted OR in the four years studied: 1.57, 1.38, 1.68, 1.45) for elderly patients taking benzodiazepines in Taiwan. Conclusion. These findings suggest that the inappropriate use of benzodiazepine may be associated with the risk of fractures. Physicians should prescribe benzodiazepines appropriately for the elderly to minimize the risk of hip fractures.", 
    "8": "We examined the hypothesis that remifentanil decreases the bispectral index (BIS) as well as blunts cardiovascular responses to tracheal intubation during anesthesia with midazolam.", 
    "9": "Sixty patients were randomly allocated to three groups according to the dose of remifentanil-0.1 (S), 0.2 (M), or 0.5 (L) microg kg(-1) min(-1), respectively. Infusion of remifentanil was started 5 min before the induction of general anesthesia with midazolam 0.2 mg/kg in all groups. Following the administration of vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg, the trachea was intubated 5 min after induction, and the infusion rate of remifentanil was then reduced to 0.05 microg kg(-1) min(-1) in all groups. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), BIS, and 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF95) were measured until 10 min after tracheal intubation.", 
    "10": "Infusion of remifentanil alone before the induction of anesthesia did not affect the hemodynamic or electroencephalographic parameters. MAP was significantly decreased after induction in all groups of patients (P < 0.01), with no differences among the three groups, while it was significantly increased after tracheal intubation in the patients of groups S and M, but not in those of group L. The HR did not change after induction in any of the groups, but it was also significantly increased after tracheal intubation of group S and M patients, although not in those of group L. The BIS decreased after induction, and both the BIS and SEF95 were significantly lower in group L patients than in those of group S (P < 0.01). All patients were unconscious after induction, and none complained of intraoperative awareness.", 
    "11": "In our patient cohort, remifentanil 0.5 microg kg(-1) min(-1) effectively decreased the BIS after the induction of general anesthesia with midazolam 0.2 mg/kg and suppressed the increase of MAP and HR in response to subsequent laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.", 
    "12": "It has been reported that Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) is an inducer or inhibitor of microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19, and diazepam is a substrate of CYP2C19. Thus, it could be expected that GBE may alter the metabolism of diazepam.", 
    "13": "The pharmacokinetic parameters of diazepam and one of its metabolites, N-demethyldiazepam, were compared after oral administration of diazepam (10 mg) in the absence or presence of oral GBE (120 mg bid, for 28 days) in 12 healthy volunteers. The pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using a noncompartmental method.", 
    "14": "The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the ratios of mean pharmacokinetic parameters of diazepam presence and absence of GBE were well within the 80-125% bioequivalence range, indicating no pharmacokinetic interaction. The ratio of AUC(0-408) with GBE to AUC(0-408) without GBE was 95.2 (90%CI: 91.6-98.8) and 101.8 (90%CI: 99.4-104.1) for diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam, respectively. The two drugs were well tolerated, and no drug-related serious adverse events were reported.", 
    "15": "The above data suggest that GBE, when taken in normally recommended doses over a 4-week time period, may not affect the pharmacokinetics of diazepam via CYP2C19 and the excretion of N-desmethyldiazepam in healthy volunteers. No drug-drug interaction was observed between GBE and diazepam.",

    "17": "Anesthetic induction and maintenance may induce myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease. A primary goal in the anesthesia of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery is both the attenuation of sympathetic responses to noxious stimuli and the prevention of hypotension.", 
    "18": "Thirty patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery were randomized to receive either ketamine 2 mg.kg(-1) (Group K) or propofol 0.5 mg.kg(-1) (Group P) during induction of anesthesia. Patients also received standardized doses of midazolam, fentanyl, and rocuronium in the induction sequence. The duration of anesthesia from induction to skin incision and sternotomy, as well as the supplemental doses of fentanyl and sevoflurane, were recorded. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac index, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance indices, stroke work index, and left and right ventricular stroke work indices were obtained before induction of anesthesia; one minute after induction; one, three, five, and ten minutes after intubation; one minute after skin incision; and at one minute after sternotomy.", 
    "19": "There were significant changes in the measured and calculated hemodynamic variables when compared to their values before induction. One minute after induction, mean arterial pressure and the systemic vascular resistance index decreased significantly in group P (p<0.01).", 
    "20": "There were no differences between groups in the consumption of sevoflurane or in the use of additional fentanyl. The combination of ketamine, midazolam, and fentanyl for the induction of anesthesia provided better hemodynamic stability during induction and until the end of sternotomy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.", 
    "21": "In an attempt to avoid unknown influence, most neuroimaging studies examining the pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exclude patients taking medications. Here we review the empirical evidence for relevant medications having a confounding effect on task performance or cerebral blood flow (CBF) in this population. The evidence for potentially confounding effects of psychotherapy in PTSD are also discussed.", 
    "22": "The literature that we reviewed was obtained through a PubMed search from 1980 to 2009 using the search terms posttraumatic stress disorder, PTSD, psychotropic medications, neuroimaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, cerebral blood flow, CBF, serotonin-specific reuptake blocker, benzodiazepine, ketamine, methamphetamine, lamotrigine and atypical antipsychotic agents.", 
    "23": "The empirical evidence for relevant medications having a confounding effect on task performance or CBF in relevant areas remains sparse for most psychotropic medications among patients with PTSD. However, considerable evidence is accumulating for 2 of the most commonly prescribed medication classes (serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors and benzodiazepines) in healthy controls. Compelling data for the potentially confounding effects on brain areas relevant to PTSD for psychotherapeutic interventions are also accumulating.", 
    "24": "Neuroimaging studies examining the pathophysiology of PTSD should ideally recruit both medicated (assuming that the medication treatment has not resulted in the remission of symptoms) and unmedicated participants, to allow the findings to be generalized with greater confidence to the entire population of patients with PTSD. More research is needed into the independent effects of medications on task performance and CBF in regions of interest in PTSD. Neuroimaging studies should also take into account whether patients are currently engaged in psychotherapeutic treatment.", 
    "25": "Cases of catatonia in patients with renal failure have been rarely reported. In this report, we describe two renal-insufficient patients with catatonia who had a good response to intramuscular lorazepam whereby the catatonic symptoms were relieved. Case 1 involved a patient with end-stage renal disease and severe pneumonia related respiratory failure. He responded well to intramuscular lorazepam (total dose, 4 mg) whereby the catatonia was elieved. Case 2 involved a patient with alcoholic liver cirrhosis and rhabdomyolysis-related acute renal failure. He showed great improvement with intramuscular lorazepam (2 mg) whereby the catatonia was subsequently relieved. This report demonstrates that intramuscular lorazepam is safe, effective and rapid in relieving catatonia associated with renal function impairment. Neither of the patients had a recurrence of catatonia during a period of 6- months follow-up. In conclusion, intramuscular lorazepam may play an important role in the treatment of catatonia associated with renal insufficiency.", 
    "26": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is induced by the BCR-ABL oncogene, a product of Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib is a standard treatment for Ph+ leukemia, and has been shown to induce a complete hematologic and cytogenetic response in most chronic phrase CML patients. However, imatinib does not cure CML, and one of the reasons is that imatinib does not kill leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in CML both in vitro and in vivo. Recently, several new targets or drugs have been reported to inhibit LSCs in cultured human CD34+ CML cells or in mouse model of BCR-ABL induced CML, including an Alox5 pathway inhibitor, Hsp90 inhibitors, omacetaxine, hedgehog inhibitor and BMS-214662. Specific targeting of LSCs but not normal stem cell is a correct strategy for developing new anti-cancer therapies in the future.", 
    "27": "Many patients undergoing long-term treatment of epilepsy complain of memory disorders, which entail worse quality of life. The risk factors generating memory disorders include: morphological brain damage, the duration and course of epileptic seizures (conscience disorders), the time of diagnosis (the risk is greater if epileptic seizures start early in life), drug resistance, the presence of interseizure changes in the EEG in the form of sharp-wave discharges or sharp spike-wave/ slow spike-wave complexes and improper pharmacotherapy (exceeding the admissible concentration of drugs in blood serum, polytherapy). GABAergic neurotransmission of older antiepileptic drugs (barbiturates, benzodiazepines) makes them particularly prone to produce modest, but statistically significant disruption of cognitive processes. This explains the search for new antiepileptic drugs that will improve, or at least not impair, cognitive functions. The improvement of cognitive functions by new generation antiepileptic drugs results, among others, from their non-GABAergic mechanisms: they influence the ion channels and glutaminergic transmission.", 
    "28": "Older people take up a large proportion of health care, including drugs, and evidence shows that drug prescribing to this group is often inappropriate. Negative consequences of potential inappropriate drug prescription (PIDP) include adverse drug events, high healthcare service utilization and high costs for the patients and society. Although nursing home residents are the most vulnerable persons exposed to PIDP, few observational studies have investigated the prevalence, the factors associated with and the consequences of PIDP. Epidemiological studies assessing PIDP mainly based on the Beers' criteria showed that approximately half of US and Canadian nursing home residents have at least one PIDP in this setting. The most frequent inappropriate prescriptions concern neuroleptics and long-term benzodiazepines. Nursing home residents aged 80 years or more, those taking a low number of drugs, cognitive or communication problems are less exposed to PIDP compared with residents younger than 80 years, living in facilities with a high number of beds and a lower registered nurse-to-resident ratio. In European countries, the prevalence of PIDP among older nursing home residents was comparable to or higher than that observed in US and Canadian nursing homes. To date, the issue of PIDP has never been investigated in a representative sample of Italian nursing home residents. In a preliminary study performed by our group in 496 nursing home residents randomly selected from 40 nursing homes in Umbria, the prevalence of residents taking at least one or two inappropriate medications was 28% and 7%, respectively. The prevalence of PIDP considering diagnosis (18%) as well as those regardless of diagnosis (17%), as determined by Beers' criteria, were equally distributed in older Italian nursing home residents and no difference was found between sexes. Overall, this review reveals that the prevalence of PIDP is high in both North American and European nursing homes and highlights the urgent need for intervention trials testing strategies to reduce the health and social burden of PIDP.", 
    "29": "In this paper, various Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) methods and the proposed algorithm, the Gibbs maximum a posteriori (GMAP) algorithm, are compared for implementing the nonlinear mixed-effects model in pharmacokinetics (PK) studies. An intravenous two-compartmental PK model is adopted to fit the PK data from the midazolam (MDZ) studies, which recruited twenty-four individuals with nine different time points per subject. The three-stage hierarchical nonlinear mixed model is constructed. Data analysis and model performance comparisons show that GMAP converges the fastest and provides reliable results. At the mean time, data augmentation (DA) methods are used for the Random-walk Metropolis method. Data analysis shows that the speed of the convergence of Random-walk Metropolis can be improved by DA, but all of them are not as fast as GMAP. The performance of GMAP and various MCMC algorithms are compared through Midazolam data analysis and simulation.", 
    "30": "Model-based drug-drug interaction (DDI) is an important in-silico tool to assess the in vivo consequences of in vitro DDI. Before its general application to new drug compounds, the DDI model is always established from known interaction data. For the first time, tests for difference and equivalent tests are implemented to compare reported and model-base simulated DDI (log AUCR) in the sample mean and variance. The biases and predictive confidence interval coverage probabilities are introduced to assess the DDI prediction performance. Sample size and power guidelines are developed for DDI model simulations. These issues have never been discussed in trial simulation studies to investigate DDI prediction. A ketoconazole (KETO)/midazolam (MDZ) example is employed to demonstrate these statistical methods. Based on published KETO and MDZ pharmacokinetics data and their in vitro inhibition rate constant data, current model-based DDI prediction underpredicts the area under concentration curve ratio (AUCR) and its between-subject variance compared to the reported study.", 
    "31": "Voltage-sensitive dyes are important tools for assessing network and single-cell excitability, but an untested premise in most cases is that the dyes do not interfere with the parameters (membrane potential, excitability) that they are designed to measure. We found that popular members of several different families of voltage-sensitive dyes modulate GABA(A) receptor with maximum efficacy and potency similar to clinically used GABA(A) receptor modulators. Di-4-ANEPPS and DiBAC4(3) potentiated GABA function with micromolar and high nanomolar potency, respectively, and yielded strong maximum effects similar to barbiturates and neurosteroids. Newer blue oxonols had biphasic effects on GABA(A) receptor function at nanomolar and micromolar concentrations, with maximum potentiation comparable to that of saturating benzodiazepine effects. ANNINE-6 and ANNINE-6plus had no detectable effect on GABA(A) receptor function. Even dyes with no activity on GABA(A) receptors at baseline induced photodynamic enhancement of GABA(A) receptors. The basal effects of dyes were sufficient to prolong IPSCs and to dampen network activity in multielectrode array recordings. Therefore, the dual effects of voltage-sensitive dyes on GABAergic inhibition require caution in dye use for studies of excitability and network activity.",

    "33": "A 23 year old Caucasian woman presented with gamma-hydroxybutyric addiction and withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms of gamma-hydroxybutyric withdrawal in this patient initially went unrecognized, upon which her situation deteriorated in such a way that she needed to be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for airway protection and mechanical ventilation. Treatment with high doses of benzodiazepines led to liberation of the ventilator and further recovery.", 
    "34": "Withdrawal symptoms of gamma-hydroxybutyric addiction are often not well recognized and the responsible physicians at Emergency Department, Intensive Care Unit and the Psychiatry ward need better understanding of diagnose and treatment. Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid withdrawal is potentially life threatening and its management may require a multidisciplinary approach. Early recognition of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid withdrawal may lead to better management of these patients.",

Those phenomena were examined in relation to previous weight gain, eating and weight-related cognitions and type of sweet stimuli: aspartame or sucrose. Alliesthesia is delayed in participants who gained weight regardless of cross group differences. A similar reduction of hunger was observed after the intake of two kinds of sweet stimuli (aspartame or sucrose) whereas alliesthesia measures were not affected. Whereas atypical antipsychotic drug-induced weight gain is linked to delayed satiety, the phenomenon is similar in magnitude in non-psychiatric controls who gained weight.",

No attempts however have been made preclinically to elucidate the adverse hematological impacts. Presently, effects of lactational exposure of olanzapine (4, 8 and 10 mg/kg) and risperidone (1 and 2 mg/kg) on hematology as well as lymphoid organ histopathology of mice neonates were investigated. Both olanzapine and risperidone transfers through milk and make the neonates susceptible to their adverse side effects. Corticosterone elevation tendency of both the drugs further enhance the susceptibility for immune dysfunction. Analysis of total and differential leukocytes counts revealed neutropenia with all the doses of olanzapine but only with risperidone 2mg/kg. Weight analysis and histopathology of thymus and spleen indicated a state of suppression; less in the risperidone-exposed groups. Significant plasma corticosterone elevation occurred on 4 and 8 mg/kg olanzapine exposures but not with 10 mg/kg as well as with both the risperidone doses. Elevation of plasma prolactin levels occurred dose-dependently for both the drugs. Hematological toxicity (neutropenia) might be the direct toxic effects of the drugs/unstable metabolites on circulating neutrophils and/or on the bone marrow hemopoietic cells. Direct toxicity of the drugs might also have suppressed the lymphoid organs thymus and spleen. Further, it could be associated to hormonal imbalance induced by adverse pharmacological effects of the drugs on the endocrine system. Suppression of lymphoid organs in olanzapine groups might have resulted because of corticosteronemia and hyperprolactinemia, while in risperidone it could be mediated by pronounced hyperprolactinemic effect alone.",

Twenty children received dexmedetomidine buccally at 3-4 microg/kg (Dex Group) and 20 received a diazepam suppository at 0.7 mg/kg (Diazepam Group) as preanesthetics 1 h before the operation. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, SpO2, and respiratory rate were measured 1 h after premedication in all children. Sedation level was preoperatively evaluated, and compared with the Ramsay score, in the ward, at the entrance to the main operating rooms, and at anesthesia induction between the two groups. To investigate the optimal dosage of buccal dexmedetomidine, we compared the mean serum concentration of dexmedetomidine at induction between patients with a Ramsay score of 5 or greater and those with a Ramsay score less than 5. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis.", 
    "56": "There was no significant difference between the two groups in age or body weight. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the two groups in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, SpO2, or respiratory rate after administration of either medication. The Ramsay score of the Dex Group was significantly higher than that of the Diazepam Group at all times. The mean serum dexmedetomidine concentration at induction in patients with a Ramsay score of 5 or greater (75 +/- 50 pg/ml) was significantly higher than in those with a Ramsay score less than 5 (34 +/- 36 pg/ml, P < 0.05).",

    "58": "Mitochondria are key organelles that perform essential cellular functions and play pivotal roles in cell death and survival signaling. Hence, they represent an attractive target for drugs to treat metabolic, degenerative, and hyperproliferative diseases. Targeting mitochondria with organelle-specific agents or prodrugs has proven to be an effective therapeutic strategy. More specifically, controlling the cellular ROS balance via selective delivery of an antioxidant \"payload\" into mitochondria is an elegant emerging therapeutic concept. Herein, we review the recent medicinal chemistry and clinical data of these exploratory strategies, which should point the way for future generations of therapeutics.", 
    "59": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a medical emergency associated with significant morbidity and mortality. SE is defined as a continuous seizure lasting more than 30 min, or two or more seizures without full recovery of consciousness between any of them. Based on recent understanding of the pathophysiology, it is now considered that any seizure that lasts more than 5 min probably needs to be treated as SE. GABAergic mechanisms play a crucial role in terminating seizures. When the seizure persists, GABA-mediated mechanisms become ineffective and several other putative mechanisms of seizure suppression have been recognized. Early treatment of SE with benzodiazepines, followed if necessary by fosphenytoin administration, is the most widely followed strategy. About a third of patients with SE may have persistent seizures refractory to the first-line medications. They require aggressive management with second-line medications such as barbiturates, propofol, or other agents. In developing countries where facilities for assisted ventilation are not readily available, it may be helpful to use nonsedating antiepileptic drugs (such as sodium valproate, levetiracetam, or topiramate) at this stage. It is important to recognize SE and institute treatment as early as possible in order to avoid a refractory state. It is equally important to attend to the general condition of the patient and to ensure that the patient is hemodynamically stable. This article reviews current knowledge regarding the management of convulsive SE in adults.",

    "61": "We performed a cross-sectional cohort study of self-reported pain during the year 2005 in our clinic. Patients were grouped into 3 cohorts: those receiving daily opioid therapy for chronic pain (cohort 1, n=115), those with a chronic pain diagnosis but not on daily opioid therapy (cohort 2, n=209), and those without a chronic pain diagnosis (cohort 3, n=796).",

    "65": "OVX diabetic rats were subcutaneously injected with estrogen replacement (17beta-estradiol, 30 microg/kg/day) or a vehicle. Each group was divided into 3 subgroups, and each subgroup was orally either given a placebo, RPD (0.5 mg/kg body weight/day) or OZP (2 mg/kg body weight/day) for 8 weeks. Sham rats were also divided into 3 subgroups and given drugs in the same manner as the OVX rats were. All rats were fed high-fat diets.", 
    "66": "OZP increased body weight and epididymal fat pads more than the control (vehicle) in sham and OVX rats. Increased body weight in OZP-treated sham and OVX rats was due to the increment in food intake, which was associated with potentiating the phosphorylation of hypothalamic adenosine-monophosphate-activated protein kinase. At euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamping, OZP decreased glucose infusion rates and increased hepatic glucose output in OVX diabetic rats. In sham rats, OZP increased hepatic glucose output but not as much as in OVX rats. Hepatic insulin signaling and glucose sensing were attenuated in OZP-treated OVX rats, and the attenuation increased hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expression to induce gluconeogenesis. These negative and harmful effects noted among OZP-treated OVX rats were reversed by estrogen replacement treatment. However, RPD did not alter body weight and peripheral insulin sensitivity in sham and OVX rats.",

    "68": "Finding small non-peptide molecules for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) whose endogenous ligands are peptides, is a very important task for medicinal chemists. Over the years, compounds mimicking peptide structures have been discovered, and scaffolds emulating peptide backbones have been designed. In our work on GPCR ligands, including cholecystokinin receptor-1 (CCKR-1) agonists, we have employed benzodiazepines as a core structure. Looking for ways to reduce molecular weight and possibly improve physical properties of GPCR ligands, we embarked on the search for molecules providing similar scaffolds to the benzodiazepine with lower molecular weight. One of our target core structures was 1,4-dihydro-[1,4]diazepine-5,7-dione. There was not, however, a known synthetic route to such molecules. Here we report the discovery of a simple and concise method for synthesis of 2-[6-(1H-indazol-3-ylmethyl)-5,7-dioxo-4-phenyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-[1,4]diazepin-1-yl]-N-isopropyl-N-phenyl-acetamide as an example of a compound containing the tetrahydrodiazepine-5,7-dione core. Compounds from this series were tested in numerous GPCR assays and demonstrated activity at melanocortin 1 and 4 receptors (MC1R and MC4R). Selected compounds from this series were tested in vivo in Peptide YY (PYY)-induced food intake. Compounds dosed by intracerebroventricular and oral routes reduced PYY-induced food intake and this effect was reversed by the cyclic peptide MC4R antagonist SHU9119.", 
    "69": "Ganaxolone (3alpha-hydroxy-3beta-methyl-5alpha-pregnan-20-one), a synthetic analog of the endogenous neurosteroid allopregnanolone and a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, may represent a new treatment approach for epilepsy. Here we demonstrate that pretreatment with ganaxolone (1.25-20 mg/kg, s.c.) causes a dose-dependent suppression of behavioral and electrographic seizures in fully amygdala-kindled female mice, with nearly complete seizure protection at the highest dose tested. The ED50 for suppression of behavioral seizures was 6.6 mg/kg. The seizure suppression produced by ganaxolone was comparable to that of clonazepam (ED50, 0.1 mg/kg, s.c.). To the extent that amygdala kindling represents a model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, this study supports the utility of ganaxolone in the treatment of patients with temporal lobe seizures.", 
    "70": "Benzodiazepines are used widely in daily clinical practice, due to their multiple pharmacological actions. The frequent problems associated with the wide use of benzodiazepines, as well as the multiple incidents of poisonings, led to the necessity for the development of a precise, sensitive and rapid method for the simultaneous determination of the 23 most commonly used benzodiazepines (diazepam, nordiazepam, oxazepam, bromazepam, alprazolam, lorazepam, medazepam, flurazepam, fludiazepam, tetrazepam, chlordiazepoxide, clobazam, midazolam, flunitrazepam, 7-amino-flunitrazepam, triazolam, prazepam, nimetazepam, nitrazepam, temazepam, lormetazepam, clonazepam, camazepam) in blood. A gas chromatographic method combined with mass spectrometric detection was developed, optimized and validated for the determination of the above substances. This method includes liquid-liquid extraction with chloroform at pH 9 and two stages of derivatization using tetramethylammonium hydroxide and propyliodide (propylation), as well as a mixture of triethylamine:propionic anhydride (propionylation). The recoveries were higher than 74% for all the benzodiazepines. The calibration curves were linear within the dynamic range of each benzodiazepine with a correlation coefficient higher than 0.9981. The limits of detection and quantification for each analyte were statistically calculated from the relative calibration curves. Accuracy and precision were also calculated and were found to be less than 8.5% and 11.1%, respectively. The developed method was successfully applied for the investigation of both forensic and clinical toxicological cases of accidental and suicidal poisoning.", 
    "71": "Our goal was to determine whether the excitatory (i.e., GABA) neurotransmitter system was important in human stroke recovery. We hypothesized that giving midazolam, a GABA(A) agonist, to patients would re-induce clinical deficits to a greater extent than the anti-cholinergic scopolamine. Twelve patients (7 M) who had recovered from hemiparesis and/or aphasia after first-time stroke and 10 age-matched, healthy controls underwent double-blinded drug challenge with midazolam and 90 days later with scopolamine, or vice versa. Language was scored for comprehension, naming and repetition, and motor function was tested with the 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT) in each hand. The drugs were administered intravenously in small aliquots until mild awake sedation was achieved. The primary outcome was the change scores from baseline to the two drug conditions, with higher scores denoting greater loss of function. Ten of the 12 patients had recovered from hemiparesis and 7 from aphasia. The median time from stroke to participation was 9.3 months (range=0.3-77.9 months). For motor function, analysis of variance showed that change scores on the 9HPT were significantly greater in patients using the previously paretic hand during the drug state with midazolam (p=0.001). Similarly, language change scores were significantly greater among recovered aphasics during the midazolam challenge (p=0.01). In our study, patients demonstrated transient re-emergence of former stroke deficits during midazolam but not scopolamine. These data provide beginning clinical evidence for the specificity of GABA-sensitive pathways for stroke recovery.", 
    "72": "New phenanthrylphenol-pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PP-PBD) conjugates have been synthesized and evaluated for their biological activity. One of the compounds 4a has been evaluated for its antiproliferative activity on 57 human tumour cell lines. The growth inhibition of 4a-c has been determined by MTT viability assay on MCF-7 cell line. Among them, 4c showed most potent growth inhibition. Based on this, an attempt was made to rationalize their mechanism of action through cell cycle analysis and DNA interaction studies. The effect of the lead compound 4c on MCF-7 cell growth associated with cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, followed by apoptosis. Our findings suggested the phenanthrylphenol-PBD conjugate 4c, which is a cyclin D1 inhibitor could be considered as a promising lead compound against breast cancer for further investigation.",

Midazolam successfully controlled RSE in 58% of patients. Mean delay to cessation of RSE was 48+/-65 minutes. Hypotension was observed in 8% of midazolam-treated patients and 71% of thiopenthal-treated patients. Overall mortality was 15% (4/26). Two deaths occurred long after the cessation of RSE. None of the deaths occurred in midazolam-treated patients.",

Multiple logistic regression was applied to identify possible predictive clinical factors influencing mortality in the elderly with acute poisoning.", 
    "79": "A total of 250 patients were enrolled in the study, with a mean age of 77 years and male predominance. The most common cause of intoxication was unintentional poisoning. Medication accounted for 57.6% of poisonous substances, of which benzodiazepine was the most common drug, followed by warfarin. The overall mortality rate was 9.6%. The average length of stay in the ED increased significantly in the old (65-74 years), very old (75-84 years) and extremely old (> or = 85 years) groups. Suicide attempt patients experienced more complications including respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, hypotension and mortality. Three clinical predictive factors of mortality were identified: herbicide poisoning, hypotension and respiratory failure upon presentation.",

    "81": "Disturbed body balance and standing steadiness are problematic for those who wake up at night or in the morning after using hypnotic drugs. As a result, falls and hip fractures are frequently reported in patients using sleep medication.", 
    "82": "A literature search was performed to identify double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials that examined body balance and standing steadiness. Drugs that were searched were nitrazepam, triazolam, lorazepam, temazepam, loprazolam, flunitrazepam, flurazepam, and the Z-drugs zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon.", 
    "83": "A total of 57 studies were eligible for inclusion. Results showed that both benzodiazepine hypnotics and the Z-drugs significantly impair body balance and standing steadiness after single dose administration. Impairments correlate significantly with blood plasma levels and are greatest at peak plasma concentrations, but are sometimes still present upon awakening. Balance problems were dose-related and most pronounced in elderly. Co-administration of alcohol aggravated the impairment. After repeated daily use of hypnotic drugs partial tolerance develops to the impairing effects on standing steadiness.", 
    "84": "Single dose administration of benzodiazepine hypnotics and Z-drugs significantly impair body balance in a dose-dependent manner. Zolpidem and zopiclone produced similar significant impairment as benzodiazepine hypnotics. Zaleplon significantly impaired balance up to 2 h after intake. Partial tolerance develops after repeated daily use. In conclusion, patients should be warned about the possible risk of imbalance and falls due to the use of sleep medication.", 
    "85": "Hyperprolactinemia is a frequent consequence of treatment with antipsychotic agents, partially because the prolactin response to antipsychotics is related to dopamine blockade. Recent studies have suggested that the prolactin response to olanzapine is weaker than that to risperidone. Thus, we studied the effects of various factors on the elevated plasma prolactin levels caused by these medications. The subjects were 94 patients with acutely exacerbated schizophrenia (46 males, 48 females). For four weeks, they received 6mg of risperidone and 20mg of olanzapine daily. Plasma samples were collected before the medications were given and 12h after the bedtime dosing each week. Treatment with either risperidone or olanzapine boosted plasma prolactin levels above baseline in both males and females. Prolactin levels were significantly higher in females than in males at all sampling points in both treatments. Risperidone increased prolactin significantly more than did olanzapine in both males and females. Delta prolactin (prolactin level at four weeks minus the baseline prolactin level) during olanzapine treatment significantly correlated with olanzapine concentration at 4th week (r=-0.518, p<0.01) only in males. Multiple regression analyses showed that delta prolactin during risperidone was significantly correlated with gender (p<0.001) and age (p<0.05) and that delta prolactin during olanzapine significantly correlated with gender (p<0.001) and drug concentration (p<0.01). The present study suggests that the predominant factors influencing hyperprolactinemia are young female for risperidone treatment, and being female and lower drug concentration as a predictor for hyperprolactinemia under olanzapine.", 
    "86": "An 18-year-old woman was treated with neuroleptic analgesia using fentanyl, morphine, droperidol and haloperidol for general anesthesia and pain control for her knee operation. Postoperatively, she showed emotional unstableness, following dyspnea, tachycardia, fever, hyperhydrosis, muscle rigidity and myoclonus like involuntary movement. She received infusion of 140 mg dantrolene in total under suspicion of having neuroleptic malignant syndrome, but her symptoms improved slightly. After being transferred to our hospital, she exhibited immobility, mutism, rigidity, and catalepsy, and she was suspected of having lethal catatonia. Infusion of diazepam 10 mg resulted in dramatical improvement of her symptoms. Differential diagnosis between neuroleptic malignant syndrome and catatonia is difficult; however, a first line therapy is differential diagnosis. Thus, physician should consider catatonia when treating neuroleptic malignant like syndrome.", 
    "87": "The objective was to formulate an olanzapine nanoemulsion that could potentially deliver the drug directly to the brain following intranasal administration. The nanoemulsions were prepared using the water titration method. The mucoadhesive character was imparted by the addition of 0.5%w/w chitosan and 0.5%w/w polycarbophil and was characterized for drug content, pH, percentage transmittance, globule size, zeta potential, and PDI. The composition (%w/w) of the optimized olanzapine nanoemulsion was capmul MCM, tween 80, and a mixture of 1:1 ratio of polyethylene glycol 400 and ethanol, and aqueous phase in a ratio of 15:35:17.5:32.5. The optimized olanzapine nanoemulsion exhibited a high diffusion coefficient and no nasal cilio-toxicity. The drug release followed the Higuchi model. The optimized nanoemulsions were found to be stable for 3 months.", 
    "88": "This is the first study to examine the effect of subchronic olanzapine (OLZ) on energy homeostasis in rats, covering all aspects of energy balance, including energy intake as metabolizable energy, storage, and expenditure. We further analyzed whether, and by which mechanism, the CB1-antagonist AVE1625 might attenuate OLZ-induced body weight gain. For this purpose, we selected juvenile female Hanover Wistar rats that robustly and reproducibly demonstrated weight gain on OLZ treatment, accepting limitations to model the aberrations on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Rats received 2\u00a0mg/kg OLZ orally twice daily for 12 days. Body weight and body composition were analyzed. Moreover daily food intake, energy expenditure, and substrate oxidation were determined in parallel to motility and body core temperature. OLZ treatment resulted in substantial body weight gain, in which lean and fat mass increased significantly. OLZ-treated rats showed hyperphagia that manifested in increased carbohydrate oxidation and lowered fat oxidation (FO). Energy expenditure was increased, motility decreased, but there was no indication for hypothermia in OLZ-treated rats. Coadministration of OLZ and AVE1625 (10\u00a0mg/kg orally once daily) attenuated body weight gain, diminishing the enhanced food intake while maintaining increased energy expenditure and decreased motility. Our data reveal that energy expenditure was enhanced in OLZ-treated rats, an effect not critically influenced by motility. Energy uptake, however, exceeded energy expenditure and led to a positive energy balance, confirming hyperphagia as the major driving factor for OLZ-induced weight gain. Combination of OLZ treatment with the CB1-antagonist AVE1625 attenuated body weight gain in rats.", 
    "89": "Several reports show the involvement of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the behavioral effects of ethanol, including ethanol drinking and relapse. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of mecamylamine, a nAChR antagonist, on ethanol withdrawal signs. Ethanol dependence was induced in C57BL/6J mice by ethanol liquid diet administration. Animals were provided with nutritionally balanced control liquid diet (600 kcal/l) as their sole nutrient source on day 0; from days 1 to 4, 3% v/v of ethanol, followed by 6% v/v of ethanol (from days 5 to 7), and 10% v/v of ethanol (from days 8 to 10) were incorporated into the liquid diet. On day 11, ethanol liquid diet was replaced with nutritionally balanced control liquid diet, and ethanol withdrawal-induced physical signs were recorded. Results showed that acute administration of mecamylamine (1-4 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) dose-dependently attenuated ethanol withdrawal-induced signs, and these effects were comparable with those of diazepam (1-2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). In addition, chronic administration of mecamylamine into ethanol diet-fed mice markedly attenuated the ethanol withdrawal sign scores, thus supporting the contention that nAChR is involved in ethanol dependence. In conclusion, our results suggest that mecamylamine exhibited inhibitory effects on ethanol withdrawal signs which could be mediated through nAChR.", 
    "90": "Atypical antipsychotics are also used in the treatment of anxiety-related disorders. Clinical and preclinical evidence regarding their intrinsic anxiolytic efficacy has been mixed. In this study, we examined the potential anxiolytic-like effects of risperidone and olanzapine, and compared them with haloperidol, chlordiazepoxide (a prototype of sedative-anxiolytic drug) or citalopram (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). We used a composite of two-way avoidance conditioning and acoustic startle reflex model and examined the effects of drug treatments during the acquisition phase (Experiment 1) or extinction phase (Experiments 2 and 3) on multiple measures of conditioned and unconditioned fear/anxiety-like responses. In Experiment 4, we further compared risperidone, olanzapine, haloperidol, citalopram and chlordiazepoxide in a standard elevated plus maze test. Results revealed three distinct anxiolytic-like profiles associated with risperidone, olanzapine and chlordiazepoxide. Risperidone, especially at 1.0mg/kg, significantly decreased the number of avoidance responses, 22kHz ultrasonic vocalization, avoidance conditioning-induced hyperthermia and startle reactivity, but did not affect defecations or time spent on the open arms. Olanzapine (2.0mg/kg, sc) significantly decreased the number of avoidance responses, 22kHz vocalization and amount of defecations, but it did not inhibit startle reactivity and time spent on the open arms. Chlordiazepoxide (10mg/kg, ip) significantly decreased the number of 22kHz vocalization, avoidance conditioning-induced hyperthermia and amount of defecations, and increased time spent on the open arms, but did not decrease avoidance responses or startle reactivity. Haloperidol and citalopram did not display any anxiolytic-like property in these tests. The results highlight the importance of using multiple measures of fear-related responses to delineate behavioral profiles of psychotherapeutic drugs.",

Likewise, MPH-ER use increased from 0% in 2001 to 18.9% in 2006, and ATX use increased from 0% in 2001 to 3.9% in 2006. The new nonstimulant drug ATX was prescribed more often to adults if they had been previously treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), benzodiazepines, or antipsychotics. Youngsters <17 years initiated on ATX were often previously treated with antipsychotics or clonidine/guanfacine.",

The major proportion of all treated patients comprised boys, 6-11 years old; most of them were treated with MPH-IR. In a few years time, the use of extended-release drugs as part of all ADHD drug prescriptions increased considerably, despite the lack of full reimbursement of these extended-release drugs. Psychostimulants and atomoxetine in children, adolescents, and adults are probably used to address different treatment needs.",

    "103": "Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) oligomerization has a profound role in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. Biophysical studies have shown that smaller sized inhaled anesthetics promote oligomerization by inducing perturbation of three critical amino acid residues (G29, A30, and I31) located in the helix-loop-helix domain of Abeta. In this present experimental study, using state-of-the-art nuclear magnetic resonance, we have monitored the influence of a larger sized intravenous anesthetic, diazepam, as well as diazepam co-administered with halothane, on Abeta. It was concluded that diazepam (in isolation) does not interact with the G29, A30, and I31 residues, and no Abeta oligomerization occurs in the presence of 0.101 mM diazepam, even after 63 days. However, when diazepam was co-administered with halothane, profound Abeta oligomerization is observed. These results strengthen the hypothesis that the presence of smaller molecular sized anesthetic is instrumental in promoting Abeta oligomerization even when co-administered with a larger sized anesthetic, namely diazepam.", 
    "104": "Although the multi-component weight loss supplement Redotex is banned in the United States, the supplement can be obtained in Mexico. The intent of this report was to describe the pattern of Redotex calls received by a statewide poison center system. Cases were all Redotex calls received by Texas poison centers during 2000-2008. The distribution of total calls and those involving ingestion of the supplement were determined for selected demographic and clinical factors. Of 34 total Redotex calls received, 55.9% came from the 14 Texas counties that border Mexico. Of the 22 reported Redotex ingestions, 77.3% of the patients were female and 45.5% 20 years or more. Of the 17 ingestions involving no co-ingestants, 52.9% were already at or en route to a health care facility, 41.2% were managed on site, and 5.9% was referred to a health care facility. The final medical outcome was no effect in 23.5% cases, minor effect in 5.9%, moderate effect in 11.8%, not followed but minimal clinical effects possible in 47.1%, and unable to follow but judged to be potentially toxic in 11.8%. Most Redotex calls to the Texas poison center system originated from counties bordering Mexico.", 
    "105": "The clinical use of therapeutic hypothermia has been rapidly expanding due to evidence of neuroprotection. However, the effect of hypothermia on specific pathways of drug elimination in humans is relatively unknown. To gain insight into the potential effects of hypothermia on drug metabolism and disposition, we evaluated the pharmacokinetics of midazolam as a probe for CYP3A4/5 activity during mild hypothermia in human volunteers. A second objective of this work was to determine whether benzodiazepines and magnesium administered intravenously would facilitate the induction of hypothermia. Subjects were enrolled in a randomized crossover study, which included two mild hypothermia groups (4 degrees C saline infusions and 4 degrees C saline + magnesium) and two normothermia groups (37 degrees C saline infusions and 37 degrees C saline + magnesium). The lowest temperatures achieved in the 4 degrees C saline + magnesium and 4 degrees C saline infusions were 35.4 +/- 0.4 and 35.8 +/- 0.3 degrees C, respectively. A significant decrease in the formation clearance of the major metabolite 1'-hydroxymidazolam was observed during the 4 degrees C saline + magnesium compared with that in the 37 degrees C saline group (p < 0.05). Population pharmacokinetic modeling identified a significant relationship between temperature and clearance and intercompartmental clearance for midazolam. This model predicted that midazolam clearance decreases 11.1% for each degree Celsius reduction in core temperature from 36.5 degrees C. Midazolam with magnesium facilitated the induction of hypothermia, but shivering was minimally suppressed. These data provided proof of concept that even mild and short-duration changes in body temperature significantly affect midazolam metabolism. Future studies in patients who receive lower levels and a longer duration of hypothermia are warranted.", 
    "106": "Controversy exists concerning the sex-dependent differences in cytochrome P450 3A activity in humans. Meta-analysis of selected studies may address this question. Meta-analysis was performed on published or unpublished data in terms of sex-dependent differences in midazolam (MDZ) disposition in humans. The following pharmacokinetic parameters were included for the analysis: MDZ oral and systemic clearance, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of oral and intravenous MDZ, MDZ oral bioavailability (F), and MDZ gastrointestinal extraction (E(G)). Ten studies including 409 healthy volunteers were identified. Women exhibited 16% higher weight-corrected MDZ oral clearance (P < 0.001) and 20% higher systemic clearance (P = 0.002) than men. No significant difference in the AUC after oral dosing of MDZ was noted between sexes. Women showed lower AUC of intravenous MDZ than men (P = 0.02). No sex-dependent differences were observed in F and E(G). In conclusion, women showed significantly greater hepatic CYP3A activity than men, whereas no sex-dependent difference in intestinal CYP3A activity was observed.",

There was a significant reduction in blood morphine concentration across the study period (beta=-0.07), declining from a median of 0.50mg/L in the years 1998-2000 prior to 0.40mg/L in the period 2001-2006. There was no significant change in the proportion of alcohol positive cases, but the proportion of benzodiazepine positive cases increased across time (OR 1.11), as did methadone positive cases (OR 1.12). The decline in blood morphine concentrations remained significant after controlling for these factors (beta=-0.07). In determining toxic and lethal morphine concentrations, the fact that the toxicology of overdose is responsive to changes in the opioid street market needs to be borne in mind.", 
    "108": "The pharmacokinetics of drugs can change in diabetes mellitus and even among diabetics. They may differ between type I diabetes (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). As triazolam was administered orally to Tsumura, Suzuki, obese, diabetes (TSOD) mice and streptozotocin (STZ) mice, clearance per body (CL/F) in TSOD mice did not differ compared with Tsumura, Suzuki, non-obesity (TSNO) mice. In STZ mice, CL/F was greater than in control mice. Small intestinal cytochrome P450 (Cyp) 3a expression in TSOD mice was significantly lower than in TSNO mice. No significant difference existed in small intestinal Cyp3a expression between STZ mice and control mice. In insulin-treated mice, small intestinal Cyp3a expression was significantly lower than in control mice. These results suggested that the differences in changes in small intestinal Cyp3a expression between T1DM and T2DM may be due to differences in plasma insulin concentrations. This may be a factor in the difference in the drug pharmacokinetics between T2DM and T1DM patients.", 
    "109": "This manuscript reviews the preclinical in vitro, ex vivo, and nonhuman in vivo effects of psychopharmacological agents in clinical use on cell physiology with a view toward identifying agents with neuroprotective properties in neurodegenerative disease. These agents are routinely used in the symptomatic treatment of neurodegenerative disease. Each agent is reviewed in terms of its effects on pathogenic proteins, proteasomal function, mitochondrial viability, mitochondrial function and metabolism, mitochondrial permeability transition pore development, cellular viability, and apoptosis. Effects on the metabolism of the neurodegenerative disease pathogenic proteins alpha-synuclein, beta-amyloid, and tau, including tau phosphorylation, are particularly addressed, with application to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Limitations of the current data are detailed and predictive criteria for translational clinical neuroprotection are proposed and discussed. Drugs that warrant further study for neuroprotection in neurodegenerative disease include pramipexole, thioridazine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, lithium, valproate, desipramine, maprotiline, fluoxetine, buspirone, clonazepam, diphenhydramine, and melatonin. Those with multiple neuroprotective mechanisms include pramipexole, thioridazine, olanzapine, quetiapine, lithium, valproate, desipramine, maprotiline, clonazepam, and melatonin. Those best viewed circumspectly in neurodegenerative disease until clinical disease course outcomes data become available, include several antipsychotics, lithium, oxcarbazepine, valproate, several tricyclic antidepressants, certain SSRIs, diazepam, and possibly diphenhydramine. A search for clinical studies of neuroprotection revealed only a single study demonstrating putatively positive results for ropinirole. An agenda for research on potentially neuroprotective agent is provided.",

    "115": "Therapeutic hypothermia has been reported to improve the neurologic outcome of comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The use of therapeutic hypothermia in patients who have had an acute ischemic-hypoxic brain injury after a suicidal intoxication has not been previously reported. We present the case of a young woman who presented comatose to our emergency department after attempting suicide by ingesting diazepam and a bottle of antifreeze (ethylene-glycol). Despite aggressive supportive care, the patient progressed to what appeared to be clinical brain death. At this point, the patient was managed with therapeutic hypothermia for 36 hours. The patient awoke within 48 hours of rewarming and made a complete and full neurologic recovery. In conclusion, this case has important implications in the management of patients who have had an acute ischemichypoxic brain injury. Inappropriately labeling such patients as \"brain dead\" will result in the failure to institute therapeutic hypothermia and other advanced neuroprotective interventions in patients who could be salvaged with a good neurologic outcome.",

    "117": "A 14-year-old Caucasian French girl, Elsa, was admitted in February 1998 to a University adolescent mental health center with an acute psychotic disorder. She showed agitation, impulsivity (sudden engagement in inappropriate behaviour), paranoid delusions, visual and auditory hallucinations, diurnal and nocturnal urinary incontinence, lack of self-care, inadequate food intake because of fear of poisoning, and vomiting after meals leading to rapid weight loss of 5 kg. Clinical examination, laboratory tests, EEG and RMI were normal. Toxicological tests were negative. Her IQ, assessed six months before admission, was in the dull average range (70-75). Elsa was treated with loxapine 150 mg per day for one week without improvement and this was then replaced by haloperidol 30 mg per day. One week after the start of haloperidol her agitation, impulsivity, and hallucinatory symptoms decreased. Twenty four days after loxapine introduction and 17 days after the haloperidol, her condition deteriorated rapidly over less than 48 hours. She exhibited immobility, minimal response to stimuli, staring and catalepsy with waxy flexibility. The diagnosis of catatonia was established. Examination revealed tremulous extremities, tachychardia (110 pm) and apyrexia. Creatine phosphokinase levels were 106 UI/l (normal range 0-250). Human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, listeria and Lyme serology were negative. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. Haloperidol was stopped and intravenous clonazepam 5mg/kg was begun. It was not possible to obtain signed consent from the two parents for Electroconvulsive therapy. The patient was transferred to a pediatric intensive care unit. The treatment was standard parenteral nutrition, nursing, intravenous clonazepam 0.05 mg/kg, with regular attendance by a child psychiatrist. Elsa stayed three weeks in this condition. She then began to notice the child psychiatrist, and a few days later she was able to carry out simple requests. Elsa was transferred to an adolescent psychiatric unit. As soon as she could eat by herself again, carbamazepine 400mg per day was begun. Her agitation reduced at a carbamazepine level of 7 mg/l. One month later her condition was stable. However, language difficulties persisted for a further six months. One year after the episode she scored 66 on a repeat IQ test and her RMI was normal. She exhibited no significant residual symptoms except some cognitive impairment. She integrated into a special education facility. These attempts to stop the carbamazepine were followed by depressed mood, aggressiveness and impulsivity; carbamazepine was finally stopped successfully after seven years. Ten years later, Elsa is the mother of two young children and is able to take care of them. She has never had a relapse of her psychotic disorder or catatonic state.",

But one to the total residual amnesia it was never confirmed, and traumatic catatonia are extremely rare. Normal CPK levels, with autonomic disturbance limited to tachycardia and the lack of resolution after discontinuance of medication, argues against a diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). But CPK levels are non specific, and NMS without pyrexia has been described. The occurrence of the catatonic syndrome 21 days after the first dose of a neuroleptic could be diagnostic. This case involved a non organic catatonic psychosis followed by neuroleptic induced catatonia. Catatonia is described as a risk factor for the development of NMS and some consider NMS to be a variant of malignant catatonia. The interest of this report is (1) it reinforces the need to be cautious before prescribing neuroleptics in adolescents presenting with symptoms of catatonia; (2) the complete recovery from catatonia after treatment with intensive care and more than three weeks of intravenous clonazepam without the use of ECT and (3) the effectiveness of carbamazepine over a long period of follow-up. Although trials on carbamazepine in catatonia are published, there are no data available for the control of residual symptoms or the long term prognosis, especially in child and adolescent psychiatry.", 
    "119": "Atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) increase dopamine (DA) release in prefrontal cortex (PFC), an effect probably mediated by the direct or indirect activation of the 5-HT(1A) receptor (5-HT(1A)R). Given the very low in-vitro affinity of most APDs for 5-HT(1A)Rs and the large co-expression of 5-HT(1A)Rs and 5-HT(2A) receptors (5-HT(2A)Rs) in the PFC, this effect might result from the imbalance of 5-HT(1A)R and 5-HT(2A)R activation after blockade of these receptors by APDs, for which they show high affinity. Here we tested this hypothesis by examining the dependence of the APD-induced DA release in medial PFC (mPFC) on each receptor by using in-vivo microdialysis in wild-type (WT) and 5-HT(1A)R and 5-HT(2A)R knockout (KO) mice. Local APDs (clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone) administered by reverse dialysis induced a dose-dependent increase in mPFC DA output equally in WT and 5-HT(2A)R KO mice whereas the DA increase was absent in 5-HT(1A)R KO mice. To examine the relative contribution of both receptors to the clozapine-induced DA release in rat mPFC, we silenced G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in vivo with N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) while 5-HT(1A)Rs or 5-HT(2A)/2CRs in the mPFC were selectively protected with the respective antagonists WAY-100635 or ritanserin. The inactivation of GPCRs while preserving \u223c70% of 5-HT(2A)/(2C)Rs prevented the clozapine-induced DA rise in mPFC. In contrast, clozapine increased DA in mPFC of EEDQ-treated rats whose 5-HT(1A)Rs were protected (\u223c50% of control rats). These results indicate that (1) 5-HT(1A)Rs are necessary for the APDs-induced elevation in cortical DA transmission, and (2) this effect does not require 5-HT(2A)R blockade by APDs.",

Placebo and 2 doses each of triazolam (0.125, 0.25 mg/70 kg, oral) and scopolamine (0.25, 0.50 mg/70 kg, subcutaneous) were administered to 80 healthy volunteers (16 per group) in a double-blind, double-dummy, independent groups design. Both triazolam and scopolamine impaired episodic memory (quantity and accuracy) but not semantic memory. Results suggested that both drugs impaired monitoring as reflected in absolute accuracy measures (impaired calibration in the direction of overconfidence) and control sensitivity (the relationship between confidence and behavior). Overall, the results did not provide evidence for differences between triazolam and scopolamine in memory or metamemory. In addition to the clinical relevance of the observed effects, this study adds to the accumulating body of cognitive psychopharmacological research illustrating the usefulness of drug-induced amnesia as a vehicle to explore memory and metamemory.",

Research suggests that the impairment profiles for benzodiazepines and alcohol differ, although few cognitive psychopharmacological studies have directly compared these drugs. This double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, repeated measures study directly compared the acute dose effects of triazolam (0.125, 0.25 mg/70 kg) and alcohol (0.40, 0.80 g/kg) in 20 social drinkers. At doses that produced comparable psychomotor impairment, triazolam was more likely to impair several objective measures of cognitive performance (e.g., episodic memory, divided attention) and to slow performance across several measures. However, only alcohol impaired accuracy on the digit symbol substitution and semantic memory tasks. In addition to objective measures, both drugs impaired awareness of performance impairments (i.e., metacognition) such that participants overestimated impairment, and the magnitude of this effect was generally larger for alcohol. Only triazolam impaired other measures of metacognition (e.g., error detection on a choice reaction time task). Future research might examine the clinical implications of the performance impairments reported here given the widespread use of benzodiazepines and alcohol.",

Then the daily dose of pramipexole was up titrated or tapered by 0.125mg/day at each subsequent examination.

    "131": "Novel therapeutics to overcome the toxic effects of organophosphorus (OP) chemical agents are needed due to the documented use of OPs in warfare (e.g. 1980-1988 Iran/Iraq war) and terrorism (e.g. 1995 Tokyo subway attacks). Standard OP exposure therapy in the United States consists of atropine sulfate (to block muscarinic receptors), the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) reactivator (oxime) pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM), and a benzodiazepine anticonvulsant to ameliorate seizures. A major disadvantage is that quaternary nitrogen charged oximes, including 2-PAM, do not cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) to treat brain AChE. Therefore, we have synthesized and evaluated pro-2-PAM (a lipid permeable 2-PAM derivative) that can enter the brain and reactivate CNS AChE, preventing seizures in guinea pigs after exposure to OPs. The protective effects of the pro-2-PAM after OP exposure were shown using (a) surgically implanted radiotelemetry probes for electroencephalogram (EEG), (b) neurohistopathology of brain, (c) cholinesterase activities in the PNS and CNS, and (d) survivability. The PNS oxime 2-PAM was ineffective at reducing seizures/status epilepticus (SE) in diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP)-exposed animals. In contrast, pro-2-PAM significantly suppressed and then eliminated seizure activity. In OP-exposed guinea pigs, there was a significant reduction in neurological damage with pro-2-PAM but not 2-PAM. Distinct regional areas of the brains showed significantly higher AChE activity 1.5h after OP exposure in pro-2-PAM treated animals compared to the 2-PAM treated ones. However, blood and diaphragm showed similar AChE activities in animals treated with either oxime, as both 2-PAM and pro-2-PAM are PNS active oximes. In conclusion, pro-2-PAM can cross the BBB, is rapidly metabolized inside the brain to 2-PAM, and protects against OP-induced SE through restoration of brain AChE activity. Pro-2-PAM represents the first non-invasive means of administering a CNS therapeutic for the deleterious effects of OP poisoning by reactivating CNS AChE.",

In adult patients with treatment-resistant depression (major depressive disorder in adults who do not respond to two separate trials of different antidepressants of adequate dose and duration in the current episode), olanzapine plus fluoxetine combination therapy was generally more effective than either drug as monotherapy based on an integrated analysis of clinical trials of 8-12 weeks' duration. More limited data also indicate that longer-term treatment for 76 weeks with olanzapine plus fluoxetine was efficacious in this patient group. Combination therapy was generally well tolerated, with a tolerability profile similar to that of olanzapine monotherapy, although fluoxetine monotherapy was generally better tolerated than olanzapine plus fluoxetine.

    "137": "\"Functional selectivity\", although new to many chemists and biologists only a few years ago, has now become a dominant theme in drug discovery. This concept posits that different ligands engender unique receptor conformations such that only a subset of signaling pathways linked to a given receptor are recruited. However, successful exploitation of the phenomenon to achieve pathway-based selectivity requires the ability to routinely detect it when assessing ligand behavior. We have utilized different strains of the yeast S. cerevisiae, each expressing a specific human Galpha/yeast Gpa1 protein chimera coupled to a MAP kinase-linked reporter gene readout, to investigate the signaling of the M(3) muscarinic receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for which various antagonists are used clinically. Using this novel platform, we found that the \"antagonists\", atropine, N-methylscopolamine, and pirenzepine, were inverse agonists for Gpa1/Galpha(q) but low efficacy agonists for Gpa1/Galpha(12.) Subsequent studies with atropine performed in mammalian 3T3 cells validated these findings by demonstrating inverse agonism for G(q/11)-mediated calcium mobilization but positive agonism for G(12)-mediated membrane ruffling. This is the first study to utilize a yeast platform to discover pathway-biased functional selectivity in a GPCR. In addition to the likely applicability of this approach for identifying biased signaling by novel chemical entities, our findings also suggest that currently marketed medications may exhibit hitherto unappreciated functional selectivity.",

    "139": "Mixed mode (MM) separation using a combination of MEKC and polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) coatings is herein reported for the separation of achiral and chiral analytes. Many analytes are difficult to separate by MEKC and PEM coatings alone. Therefore, the implementation of a MM separation provides several advantages for overcoming the limitations of these well-established methods. In this study, it was observed that achiral separations using MEKC and PEM coatings individually resulted in partial resolution of eight very similar aryl ketones when the molecular micelle (sodium poly(N-undecanoyl-L-glycinate)) concentration was varied from 0.25 to 1.00% w/v and the bilayer number varied from 2 to 4. However, when MM separation was introduced, baseline resolution was achieved for all eight analytes. In the case of chiral separations, temazepam, aminoglutethimide, benzoin, benzoin methyl ether, and coumachlor were separated using the three separation techniques. For chiral separations, the chiral molecular micelle, sodium poly(N-undecanoyl-L-leucylvalinate), was employed at concentrations of 0.25-1.50% w/v for both MEKC and PEM coatings. Overall, the results revealed partial separation with MEKC and PEM coatings individually. However, MM separation enabled baseline separation of each chiral mixture. The separation of achiral and chiral compounds from different compound classes demonstrates the versatility of this MM approach.",

    "142": "We used Flinder Sensitive Line (FSL) rats, a genetic model of unipolar depression, to examine whether changes in central GABAergic transmission are associated with a depressed phenotype. FSL rats showed an increased behavioral response to low doses of diazepam, as compared to either Sprague Dawley (SD) or Flinder Resistant Line (FRL) rats used as controls. Diazepam at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg, i.p., induced a robust impairment of motor coordination in FSL rats, but was virtually inactive in SD or FRL rats. The increased responsiveness of FSL rats was not due to changes in the brain levels of diazepam or its active metabolites, or to increases in the number or affinity of benzodiazepine recognition sites, as shown by the analysis of [(3)H]-flunitrazepam binding in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex or cerebellum. We therefore examined whether FSL rats differed from control rats for the expression levels of the K(+)/Cl(-) cotransporter, KCC2, which transports Cl(-) ions out of neurons, thus creating the concentration gradient that allows Cl(-) influx through the anion channel associated with GABA(A) receptors. Combined immunoblot and immunohistochemical data showed a widespread increase in KCC2 expression in FSL rats, as compared with control rats. The increase was more prominent in the cerebellum, where KCC2 was largely expressed in the granular layer. These data raise the interesting possibility that a spontaneous depressive state in animals is associated with an amplified GABAergic transmission in the CNS resulting from an enhanced expression of KCC2.",

Nonetheless, it is unclear whether the observed behaviors rely on the presence of mirrored panels. If so, it is unclear whether the behaviors are sensitive to clinically effective anxiolytics, and how the test compares to the elevated plus maze (EPM) in terms of predictive validity. The present studies assessed anxiety-like behaviors in different mouse strains in the MC using mirrored and non-mirrored panels, under variable lighting conditions. We also assessed the pharmacological validity of the MC and EPM tests, and the locomotor properties of active test compounds. Seven mouse strains exhibited different levels of anxiety-like behaviors in the MC, and differential sensitivity to panel and light conditions. DBA/2J mice appeared most sensitive to the mirrored, versus black or white, panels and were therefore used in pharmacological MC studies. The mGlu5 receptor antagonist MPEP significantly decreased anxiety-like behaviors, similar to an intermediate dose of the benzodiazepine diazepam. The benzodiazepines chlordiazepoxide and alprazolam and the 5HT(1A) partial agonist buspirone had no effects on anxiety-like behaviors in the MC. None of the MC effects of active test compounds were attributable to non-specific/locomotor effects. The antidepressants fluoxetine and venlafaxine increased anxiety-like behaviors in the MC. By contrast, the anxiolytic-like effects of chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and MPEP were revealed in the EPM in C57Bl6/J mice. In conclusion, the EPM test exhibits superior predictive validity compared to the MC test, despite the sensitivity of the MC to mouse strain differences.",

    "160": "Benzodiazepines are widely used in clinics and for recreational purposes, but will lead to addiction in vulnerable individuals. Addictive drugs increase the levels of dopamine and also trigger long-lasting synaptic adaptations in the mesolimbic reward system that ultimately may induce the pathological behaviour. The neural basis for the addictive nature of benzodiazepines, however, remains elusive. Here we show that benzodiazepines increase firing of dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area through the positive modulation of GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid type A) receptors in nearby interneurons. Such disinhibition, which relies on alpha1-containing GABA(A) receptors expressed in these cells, triggers drug-evoked synaptic plasticity in excitatory afferents onto dopamine neurons and underlies drug reinforcement. Taken together, our data provide evidence that benzodiazepines share defining pharmacological features of addictive drugs through cell-type-specific expression of alpha1-containing GABA(A) receptors in the ventral tegmental area. The data also indicate that subunit-selective benzodiazepines sparing alpha1 may be devoid of addiction liability.", 
    "161": "MRK-409 binds to \u03b11-, \u03b12-, \u03b13- and \u03b15-containing human recombinant GABA(A) receptors with comparable high affinity (0.21-0.40 nM). However, MRK-409 has greater agonist efficacy at the \u03b13 compared with \u03b11 subtypes (respective efficacies relative to the full agonist chlordiazepoxide of 0.45 and 0.18). This compound readily penetrates the brain in rats and occupies the benzodiazepine site of GABA(A) receptors, measured using an in vivo [(3)H]flumazenil binding assay, with an Occ(50) of 2.2 mg/kg p.o. and a corresponding plasma EC(50) of 115 ng/mL. Behaviourally, the \u03b13-preferring agonist efficacy profile of MRK-409 produced anxiolytic-like activity in rodent and primate unconditioned and conditioned models of anxiety with minimum effective doses corresponding to occupancies, depending on the particular model, ranging from \u223c35% to 65% yet there were minimal overt signs of sedation at occupancies greater than 90%. In humans, however, safety and tolerability studies showed that there was pronounced sedation at a dose of 2 mg, resulting in a maximal tolerated dose of 1 mg. This 2 mg dose corresponded to a C(max) plasma concentration of 28 ng/mL, which, based on the rodent plasma EC(50) for occupancy of 115 ng/mL, suggested that sedation in humans occurs at low levels of occupancy. This was confirmed in human positron emission tomography studies, in which [(11)C]flumazenil uptake following a single dose of 1 mg MRK-409 was comparable to that of placebo, indicating that occupancy of GABA(A) receptor benzodiazepine binding sites by MRK-409 was below the limits of detection (i.e. <10%). Taken together, these data show that MRK-409 causes sedation in humans at a dose (2 mg) corresponding to levels of occupancy considerably less than those predicted from rodent models to be required for anxiolytic efficacy (\u223c35-65%). Thus, the preclinical non-sedating anxiolytic profile of MRK-409 did not translate into humans and further development of this compound was halted.", 
    "162": "Objective. To report one case of seizure following administration of ofloxacin. Case Summary. A 38-year-old woman with alcohol dependence but no prior history of seizure disorder admitted in our inpatient alcohol detoxification program was prescribed ofloxacin four days after admission for a lower urinary tract infection. She was currently prescribed diazepam 30 mg per day. This treatment was continued without modification following admission. Forty eight hours after starting ofloxacin and after receiving five doses of oral ofloxacin, the patient experienced a seizure. Ofloxacin treatment was stopped and no further seizures occurred. Neurological examination of the patient, laboratory tests, computerized tomography with contrast enhancement and electroencephalography did not detect any abnormalities. Up to the last consultation, six months after admission, the patient has reported no recurrence of the seizure. Discussion. Quinolone antibiotics vary in their ability to induce seizures, with ofloxacin having one of the least potentials. In the present case, the seizure could be attributed in all probability to taking ofloxacin; since she had no previous history of seizures, she did not present an alcohol withdrawal syndrome, benzodiazepine treatment was not modified, the seizure occurred 48 h after taking ofloxacin, but seven days after stopping drinking, no alternative aetiologies for the seizure could be identified and no seizure recurrence was reported over the following seven months. Of reported cases of seizures in patients treated with fluoroquinolones, none concerned patients with alcohol dependence or patients treated with benzodiazepines. Conclusions. The present case alerts us to the possibility that seizures may occur in alcohol dependent patients treated with benzodiazepines who concomitantly prescribed a fluoroquinolone. These widely-used antibiotics should thus be prescribed with caution to patients undergoing detoxification for alcohol dependence, particularly if they are also taking benzodiazepines, irrespective of whether they have a previous history of seizures or not.",

During this period, 2057 cases, 53.9% female and 46.1% male, were admitted with the indication of acute poisoning. The greatest proportion of poisoning occurred between the ages of 18 and 29 years, with suicidal intentions. Most cases of poisoning were intentional (85%). The most common agents involved in acute poisoning were drugs (77.7%), especially sedatives/hypnotics such as benzodiazepines, followed by opioid analgesics. Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides were the third major agent that induced poisoning. Twenty-seven patients (1.3%) who were mostly females and young adults died. Death mostly occurred due to organophosphate and carbamate insecticides (19 cases) poisoning, followed by sedatives/hypnotics like benzodiazepines (3 cases). High prevalence of intentional overdose and mortality among young adults requires considerable attention and further studies to find out the underlying causes. In addition, strict rules must be followed regarding the sale of central nervous system drugs and pesticides, particularly organophosphate and carbamate insecticides. Establishing poison information centers in different parts of the country, preparing national treatment guidelines, training healthcare providers, and ensuring easy availability of the antidotes are also recommended.", 
    "165": "YF476 is a potent and highly selective cholecystokin 2 (CCK(2)) receptor antagonist of the benzodiazepine class. It inhibits gastric neuroendocrine enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell secretion, proliferation and spontaneous formation of gastric neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoids) in cotton rats. The Mastomys rodent species exhibits a genetic predisposition to gastric ECL neuroendocrine tumor formation which can be accelerated by acid suppression and induction of hypergastrinemia. In this respect, it mimics the human condition of atrophic gastritis, hypergastrinemia and gastric carcinoid development. We investigated whether YF476 could inhibit acid suppression-induced ECL cell hyperplasia and neoplasia in this model. In addition, we examined whether YF476 could reverse established ECL cell hyperplasia and neoplasia. Targeting the CCK(2) receptor during Loxtidine-induced hypergastrinemia resulted in a reduction in ECL cell secretion (plasma and mucosal histamine, and histidine decarboxylase (HDC) transcripts, p<0.05) and proliferation (numbers of HDC-positive cells, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and cyclin D1 transcription). This was associated with a decrease in ECL cell hyperplasia and a 60% reduction in gastric ECL cell microcarcinoid (tumors <0.3mm in size) formation. YF476 inhibited ECL cell neoplasia (gastric carcinoid) in animals with hyperplasia, inhibited the formation of ECL cell tumors when co-administered with Loxtidine and reversed the growth and developement of gastric ECL cell carcinoids in long-term acid suppressed Mastomys. Variable importance analysis using a logistic multinomial regression model indicated the effects of YF476 were specific to the ECL cell and alterations in ECL cell function reflected inhibition of transcripts for HDC, Chromogranin A (CgA), CCK(2) and the autocrine growth factor, CTGF. We conclude that specifically targeting the CCK(2) receptor inhibits gastrin-mediated ECL cell secretion and ECL cell proliferation and tumor development in vivo.",
