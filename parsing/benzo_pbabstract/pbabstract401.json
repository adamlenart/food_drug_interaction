    "0": "The effects of the selective CCK-B agonists, BC 264 and BC 197, and the nonselective CCK agonist BDNL were investigated in the elevated plus-maze in rats. BDNL and BC 197 induced anxiogeniclike effects, in contrast to BC 264, which had no effect. The behavioral responses induced by BDNL were not significantly blocked by L-365,260, but were suppressed by CI-988, another selective CCK-B antagonist, and by high doses of L-364,718, a selective CCK-A antagonist. BC 197-induced effects were also blocked by CI-988. Competition experiments performed with [3H]pBC 264 using brain membranes of guinea pig, mouse, and rat were significantly better fitted when analyzed by a two site model than by a one site model with BC 197 but not with BC 264. Moreover, BC 264 produced anxiogeniclike effects when administered with increasing doses of L-365,260 and opposing effects with increasing doses of CI-988. Together these results give pharmacological and behavioral evidence for the existence of CCK-B receptor subtypes.", 
    "1": "The aim of the present investigation was to explore dose relationships for effects of oxytocin on spontaneous motor activity in the rat. Oxytocin in doses from 1-1000 micrograms/kg was given SC to male Sprague-Dawley rats, and spontaneous motor behavior was measured by means of photocell-operated open-field observations. In the rats treated with low doses of oxytocin (1-4 micrograms/kg), there was a decrease in peripheral locomotor activity. With increasing doses (250-1000 micrograms/kg), there were clear signs of sedative effects as indicated by a suppression of locomotor activity and rearing. The time course for the effect of oxytocin on peripheral activity (1 microgram/kg) and rearing (1 mg/kg) was tested. A maximal effect was obtained within 1 h and, thereafter, the behavior gradually returned to normal within 24 h. This spectrum of effects caused by oxytocin was similar to that of midazolam but different from that induced by raclopride.", 
    "2": "Quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography was used to study the distribution of cholecystokin receptors in the bovine brain. [125I]Bolton-Hunter cholecystokinin octapeptide binding was described in whole hemisphere sagittal and coronal sections using cholecystokinin octapeptide, devazepide and L-365,260 as competitors to identify the subtypes. High levels of cholecystokinin receptors were found in the cortex, where they presented a laminar distribution which varied from area to area. The basal ganglia, the caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens and putamen presented high to moderate levels of cholecystokinin binding, whereas only very low labelling was found in the globus pallidus. Cholecystokinin binding was present in all portions of the bovine hippocampus; high levels were found in the dentate gyrus, CA1 subfield of Ammon's horn, subiculum and presubiculum. Moderate to high levels were also found in the amygdala, inferior colliculus and olfactory tract, while most of the hypothalamic and thalamic nuclei exhibited very low or no cholecystokinin binding. Low cholecystokinin binding was uniformly distributed across cell layers of the bovine cerebellar cortex. Competition of [125I]Bolton-Hunter cholecystokinin octapeptide binding in the cortex, nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, cerebellum and brainstem was much greater in the presence of L-365,260 than devazepide, thereby suggesting that the majority of cholecystokinin receptors in these regions are of the cholecystokinin-B subtype. The results of this study, when compared to distribution profiles in other mammalian species, provide further evidence for species differences in the distribution of cholecystokinin receptors in the brain. The results also support the possible interaction between cholecystokinin and dopaminergic systems in areas of the brain containing dopaminergic terminals, such as the frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, caudate-putamen and olfactory tubercle.", 
    "3": "The aetiology and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease are currently poorly understood, but symptomatic disease is associated with amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal loss and numerous alterations of neurotransmitter systems in the CNS. Monoamine oxidase type B is known to be increased in Alzheimer diseased brains. The distribution and abundance of catalytic sites for monoamine oxidases A and B in post mortem human brains of 11 Alzheimer disease cases and five age-matched controls were investigated by quantitative enzyme radioautography. Using tritiated monoamine oxidase inhibitors (Ro41-1049 and lazabemide)--as high affinity substrates selective for monoamine oxidases A and B, respectively--it was found that monoamine oxidase B activity increased up to three-fold exclusively in temporal, parietal and frontal cortices of Alzheimer disease cases compared with controls. This increase was restricted to discrete patches (approximately 185 microns in diameter) which occupied approximately 12% of the cortical areas examined. In other brain regions (hippocampal formation > caudate-putamen > cerebellum), patches of [3H]lazabemide-enriched binding were less abundant. [3H]Ro41-1049 binding (i.e. monoamine oxidase A) was unchanged in all tissues of diseased versus control brains. The monoamine oxidase B-enriched patches in all cortical regions correlated, in their distribution and frequency, with glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunoreactive clusters of astrocytes. Diffuse and mature beta-amyloid-immunoreactive senile plaques as well as patches of high density binding of [3H]PK-11195--a high-affinity ligand for peripheral-type (mitochondrial) benzodiazepine binding sites in microglia/macrophages--were found throughout Alzheimer diseased cortices. The up-regulation of monoamine oxidase B in plaque-associated astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease--in analogy to its proposed role in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease--might, indirectly, be a potential source of cytotoxic free radicals. Lazabemide, a selective reversible monoamine oxidase B inhibitor, is currently under clinical evaluation for the treatment of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. We conclude that enzyme radioautography with [3H]lazabemide is a reliable high resolution assay for plaque-associated astroglioses in Alzheimer's disease. Its clinical diagnostic utility for positron emission tomography or single photon emission computer tomography studies is being investigated.", 
    "4": "Changes in intracellular levels of free [Ca2+]i were monitored in cell suspensions and either single cells or cell clusters of the rat pancreatic tumour cell line AR42J grown on cover slips. Increases in free [Ca2+]i were seen when the bathing medium contained cholecystokinin octapeptide sulphated (CCK) or CCKB receptor agonists. Responses to CCK agonists were repeatable and reversed on washout. The responses to cholecystokinin and pentagastrin could be blocked by selective CCKB receptor antagonists but not a CCKA receptor antagonist. Depleting internal Ca2+ stores with thapsigargin blocked the response to pentagastrin suggesting that the response was mediated by Ca2+ release from internal stores. The rapid run down of the pentagastrin response in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ shows that replenishment of internal stores by extracellular Ca2+ is important in maintaining the CCK response.", 
    "5": "Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHBA) has been recently introduced for alcohol detoxication but few data are available concerning the central mechanism of action of this gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) catabolite. GHBA ability to stimulate growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) secretion has been reported: the involvement of GABA, dopamine or serotonin systems acting on pituitary hormones has been hypothesized. In the present study we investigated GH and PRL responses to GHBA with or without flumazenil (a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) i.v. pretreatment. Our study included nine male healthy volunteers (aged 23.2 +/- 2.5 years) who were submitted to three tests in random order: (1) oral GHB administration; (2) oral GHBA and i.v. flumazenil administration; (3) oral placebo and i.v. saline administration. Blood samples for GH and PRL assays were collected during the three tests at -15, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 min. GHBA induced a significant increase in GH plasma levels; flumazenil pretreatment antagonized GHBA action on GH secretion. No changes were obtained with placebo and saline administration. A subpopulation of GABA receptors or GHBA-specific receptors seems to be involved in GHBA action. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil was able to influence the sensitivity and the neuroendocrine consequences of GHBA binding site stimulation.", 
    "6": "Economic studies attempting to justify the increased cost of new antidepressants such as the SSRIs are often difficult to interpret, marginal benefits hinging on minute differences in assumptions and interpretation. Studies to date have focused largely upon the costs of treatment failure, which in turn relates to compliance rates. A missing factor is the cost of accidents, especially serious road traffic accidents. Most tricyclic antidepressants seriously impair driving performance, even more so than alcohol or benzodiazepines, whilst SSRIs do not. With moves towards maintenance and continuation therapy for depression, patients on tricyclics remain at long-term risk for such accidents. Cost savings from reducing the rate of accidents could more than pay for the increased costs of SSRIs.", 
    "7": "The possible effects on memory, psychomotor performance and mood of eliprodil, a new non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist acting through the polyamine modulatory site, was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled study involving 11 healthy young male volunteers. Eliprodil 30 mg, a placebo and midazolam 15 mg, a positive control, were administered as a single oral dose at 1 week wash-out intervals. Objective tests evaluated both memory (Sternberg memory scanning and paired words for short-term memory, delayed free recall of pictures for long-term memory) and psychomotor functions and arousal (critical flicker fusion threshold, choice reaction time, body sway). Mood was assessed using self-ratings (LARS, POMS, ARCI). Statistical analysis was performed using an ANOVA with pairwise comparisons using Tukey's method. A single dose of eliprodil 30 mg was free of any detrimental effect on memory and skilled performance and did not produce either subjective sedation or excitation or psychotomimetic effects in comparison with placebo. In contrast, a single dose of midazolam 15 mg induced a marked impairment in psychomotor performance and cognitive functions (significant reduction in CFF, increase in CRT and body sway, disruption of short- and long-term memory). The potent sedative activity of midazolam, peaking 1 to 3 h post-dose, was confirmed by subjective evaluation and had disappeared 8 h post-dose.", 
    "8": "The aim of this study is to determine whether long-term use (5-20 years) of therapeutic doses of diazepam (5-20 mg/day) in anxious patients (n = 28) is associated with tolerance to its psychomotor and cognitive effects. Patients were tested at baseline, before and after a 10 mg oral dose of diazepam during chronic use, and at 3 weeks and 10 months after benzodiazepine (BZ) discontinuation. The effects of a single i.v. dose of flumazenil (1 mg administered 5 days before baseline) on reversing tolerance were also assessed. No acute effect of diazepam was observed on the psychomotor performance of patients both under BZ treatment and after short- and long-term discontinuation, suggesting persistence of tolerance. In contrast, acute effects of diazepam were observed in memory measures at all times. Given subjects' very prolonged BZ use, it is possible to predict that tolerance to the memory effects never fully develops. Flumazenil administration did not reverse tolerance. This suggests that neuroadaptative mechanisms, other than benzodiazepine receptor set-point shift, occur after long-term use.", 
    "9": "1. The central and peripheral effects of the omega (benzodiazepine) site ligands, clonazepam, alpidem, zolpidem, triazolam, flumazenil, ethyl beta carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) and N-methyl beta carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) on intestinal myoelectrical activity were evaluated in conscious rats, chronically fitted with Nichrome electrodes implanted on the duodenum and jejunum. The localization of the omega (benzodiazepine) receptors involved in these effects was evaluated by use of systemic and perivagal capsaicin treatments. 2. When administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) the omega site inverse agonists beta-CCE and beta-CCM, and the omega site antagonist flumazenil, did not affect the duodeno-jejunal motility. Alpidem and zolpidem, two selective omega 1 site agonists induced an inhibition of migrating myoelectric complexes (MMCs) only at a high dose (5 mg kg-1). In contrast, clonazepam (a mixed omega 1/omega 2 agonist) and triazolam (a preferential omega 2 site agonist) disrupted the MMC-pattern at doses as low as 0.05 mg kg-1, the effect of trizolam being of much longer duration than that of clonazepam. None of these drugs altered MMC-pattern when administered centrally (i.c.v.). 3. Administered i.p. or i.c.v. prior to triazolam, alpidem blocked the effect of triazolam on duodenojejunal spike activity. Administered i.p. prior to triazolam, flumazenil suppressed the triazolam-induced MMC-disruption. Previous systemic but not perivagal capsaicin treatment suppressed the effects of clonazepam on MMCs. 4. It is concluded that omega-site agonists but not, antagonist or inverse agonists, administered systemically induced intestinal motor disturbances which may be linked to activation of omega 2 (BZ2) sites located on nonvagal capsaicin-sensitive afferent neurones.", 
    "10": "Brain cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors have been implicated in anxiety disorders and suicidal behaviour. We have examined the radioligand binding ability of CCK and benzodiazepine receptors in rat brain after long-term intermittent voluntary vs voluntary and forced low-dose ethanol exposure. During 58 weeks, one group of rats had a choice between ethanol and water as the drinking fluid for 24 hr each week. Another group of rats had the same weekly choice between ethanol and water, but at the end of each 24 hr choice period, ethanol (2.0 g/kg) was injected. During the second period of ethanol treatment, lasting for 32 weeks, both ethanol-treated groups had continuous free access to ethanol and water. These two treatments have previously been shown to induce partially different neurochemical alterations. In the present investigation, benzodiazepine receptor binding in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum was similar in both ethanol treatment groups compared to controls. CCK receptor binding in the hippocampus and striatum did not differ between the three groups; however, in the frontal cortex, there was an increase in the apparent number of CCK binding sites in the group of rats submitted to voluntary plus forced ethanol exposure as compared to the control group or the voluntary intake group. These results suggest that long-term ethanol treatment may lead to alterations in brain CCK-ergic neurotransmission, but that the changes are specific to the treatment schedule.", 
    "11": "The objective of this study was a) to compare patterns of drug use in fatal and nonfatal overdoses and b) to find out if toxic drugs are overrepresented in overdoses with fatal outcome. A total of 179 cases of fatal overdoses in Switzerland (population 6.6 million) were compared with 269 medically treated self-poisoners from the agglomeration of Berne (population 301,630). Because of frequent multiple drug use, all the different compounds taken singly or in combination with other drugs were recorded and grouped according to drug types. The patterns of the frequencies of drugs used were remarkably similar in both groups. The majority of the drugs were psychotropics (81% in fatal and 68% in nonfatal overdose). Twenty-nine completed suicides were the result of drug combinations specifically recommended by EXIT. In the remaining cases benzodiazepines were used most frequently in both attempted and completed suicide, often in combination with other drugs or alcohol. Barbiturates were the only drugs recorded significantly more often in fatal overdoses (9% vs 3%). No significant difference was found for tricyclic antidepressants (13% vs 10%), or other types of drugs. The results are consistent with our assumption that drugs with higher toxicity would be overrepresented in overdoses with fatal outcome. Barbiturates, which are well known to be dangerous in overdose, were clearly associated with fatal overdoses, but not tricyclic antidepressants. This, in our view, suggests that the risk of prescribing tricyclic antidepressants should not be overestimated. The frequent use of benzodiazepines in completed suicide, however, indicates that there are no truly safe drugs in overdose.", 
    "12": "Feeding rats a diet containing high levels of protein (as casein) increases the secretion and biosynthesis of pancreatic serine proteases. Cholecystokinin (CCK) presumably plays a role in this process although other GI peptides such as the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) may be involved. In this article, we describe the kinetics of pancreatic adaptation to a diet containing 45% protein as soybean and fish. Then we report the effect of treatment with either a cholecystokinin-receptor antagonist (MK-329) or a gastrin-releasing peptide-receptor antagonist ([D-F5 Phe6, D-Ala11]-Bn(6-13)OMe, or BIM 26226) on pancreatic adaptation to this diet. Prior to experiments, adult male Fischer rats received a diet containing 22% protein for 1 week. In the first experiment, 48 rats were fed a diet containing 45% protein; they were killed after 0-7 days. In the second experiment, 53 rats were fed the 22- or 45%-protein diet and received three daily injections of either the vehicle alone, MK-329, or BIM 26226 for 7 days before they were killed. When the protein-rich diet was fed for 0-7 days, amylase, in vitro biosynthesis, and mRNA levels were gradually decreased while serine protease biosynthesis was increased, reflecting the general enhancement of chymotrypsinogen, trypsinogen, and elastase mRNA levels. For all these parameters, adaptation leveled off after a 5-day feeding. When the protein diets were fed for 7 days, MK-329 significantly inhibited the adaptation of trypsin (specific activity and mRNA) and elastase (mRNAs) to the 45%-protein diet. BIM 26226 had no effect on pancreatic adaptation to the protein-rich diet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "The molecular composition of the native gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor complex is actually unknown. In the present communication we report a novel approach to characterize the minimal molecular conformation of the native GABAA receptor complex. This novel approach is based on the combination of subunit specific antibodies and specific 3H-labeled ligands in immunoprecipitation experiments. We have determined the presence of beta 2/3 and gamma 2 subunits in the Type I GABAA receptor complex, from rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus, by using two antibodies, the monoclonal 62-3G1 (specific for beta 2/3) and the polyclonal anti-gamma 2 (to the large intracellular loop of the gamma 2 short form) together with the Type I-specific ligand [3H]zolpidem. The association of gamma 2 and beta 2/3 subunits with the GABAA receptor complex was also tested using [3H]flumazenil. The results indicated that both gamma 2 and beta 2/3 were the most abundant subunits associated to either Type I or total benzodiazepine receptors from both cortex and hippocampus. Between 70-80% of Type I or total benzodiazepine binding activity was immunoprecipitated by either antibody. In addition, we have also investigated the coexistence of both subunits as part of the same population of Type I GABAA receptor complex by cross-immunoprecipitation experiments with 62-3G1 and anti-gamma 2. The results indicated that, in cerebral cortex, both gamma 2 and beta 2/3 subunits were part of the same population of Type I receptors. In hippocampus, an additional 20% of Type I receptors displayed either gamma 2 or beta 2/3 but not both subunits.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "The cardiopulmonary complications associated with gastroscopy could be reduced by giving little or no prior sedation. The ability to tolerate the procedure with and without sedation was compared in 62 elderly patients by recording responses to a questionnaire designed to evaluate the patient's own assessment of the examination. A similar percentage of sedated and unsedated patients described the procedure as mildly unpleasant (63% vs 57%; chi 2 = 0.500; p > 0.10). The majority (73%) of unsedated patients did not want to be sedated for future examinations because of the inconvenience of the recovery period. Elderly patients should therefore be given the choice of undergoing the procedure without sedation. Full counselling and explanation of the procedure are however even more important to allay anxiety and apprehension if the procedure is undertaken without sedation.",

The report emphasizes sedation for endoscopy and dental surgery, but the recommendations are equally relevant to accident and emergency (A&E) medicine. Current sedation practice for orthopaedic manipulations was determined by questionnaire in 58 A&E and orthopaedic junior staff in one teaching and one district general hospital. Of the 50 doctors who completed the questionnaire, 14 (28%) respondents made an inadequate pre-sedation assessment. Over half were unable to name the antagonist to benzodiazepine drugs. Eleven (22%) doctors administered supplemental oxygen to all their patients, 12 (24%) did not consider it necessary. Pulse oximetry was used for patient monitoring by one respondent (2%). None of the junior staff had received any formal training in sedation techniques. Thirty-one (62%) had attended a resuscitation refresher course within the last year. These results emphasize the need for training in sedation techniques for A&E and orthopaedic juniors and the importance of appropriate supervision.",

We undertook a trial of opiate sedation versus opiate sedation plus low dose midazolam (1 mg/hour) to determine whether a similar effect could be demonstrated in man.

The GABA-ratios (the ratio of IC50 values in the absence/presence of GABA in the binding assay) were 1.1 and 1.2 for dinatin and skrofulein, respectively.

The Cys-X-X-Cys motif found in Zn(2+)-binding proteins such as aspartate transcarbamylase was used as a template to devise a bidentate-coordination model for Cys-A1-A2-X peptide inhibitors. Accordingly, replacement of the central dipeptide with the hydrophobic scaffold 3-amino-1-carboxymethyl-2,3-dihydro-5- phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (BZA) yielded a peptidomimetic inhibitor, Cys(BZA)Met, of moderate potency (IC50 = 400 nM). N-Methylation of the cysteine amide improved potency almost 100-fold (IC50 = 0.3-1 nM). The increased affinity presumably correlates with a preferred conformation of the inhibitor which maximizes a hydrophobic interaction between the scaffold and the enzyme, and the proper presentation of cysteine and methionine to allow bidentate coordination at Zn2+. These non-peptide inhibitors have been shown to block farnesylation of the Ras protein in intact cells and provide lead compounds for the development of new cancer therapeutic agents.",

Am. Chem. Soc. 1993, 115, 8861]. While 3 displayed in vivo activity in the conscious dog following intravenous administration, it was not active following intraduodenal administration; activity was measured with an ex vivo platelet aggregation assay. The secondary amide in 3 was N-methylated in the expectation of increased absorption and bioavailability. The resulting tertiary amide, 4 (SB 208651), also showed high binding affinity for human GPIIb/IIIa and potent antiaggregatory activity in human platelet-rich plasma. Most importantly, 4 was active in vivo following intravenous and intraduodenal administration. Comparison of the iv and id inhibition curves suggests an apparent bioavailability of approximately 10%.

    "28": "The effect of benzodiazepines (BZP) on melatonin release was investigated in the pineal gland of the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, maintained under in vitro perifusion culture conditions. Melatonin and the methoxyindoles 5-methoxytryptophol (5-MTOL), 5-methoxyindoleacetic acid (5-MIAA), and 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MT) were determined directly in samples of the superfusion medium by HPLC with electrochemical detection. Melatonin release was significantly increased by addition of diazepam and clonazepam in a dose-related and reversible manner. The effects of benzodiazepines were more pronounced in light-adapted pineal organs, when melatonin secretion is low, than under scotopic conditions. When the perifusion medium was replaced by a medium containing low calcium, high magnesium concentrations, melatonin release was considerably decreased by 70% in light-adapted and 20% in dark-adapted pineal organs. Addition of diazepam to low Ca2+, high Mg(2+)-medium reversed the decrease of melatonin release and produced a clear rise in its secretion rate. Addition of the BZP antagonist flumazenil to the perifusion medium slightly decreased melatonin release in the light- and dark-adapted state, whereas the peripheral receptor antagonist PK 11195 did not alter melatonin release. The effect of diazepam is reduced by simultaneous addition of flumazenil to the superfusion medium, suggesting that the effects of diazepam are receptor-mediated. The methoxyindoles 5-MTOL, 5-MIAA, and 5-MT showed no significant changes of their release pattern after diazepam application in light- and dark-adapted pineal organs. These results suggest that BZP can influence melatonin production and release by an intrapineal action possibly on the melatonin synthesizing photoreceptor cell.", 
    "29": "We constructed plasmid vectors that simultaneously express both the p66 and p51 subunits of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) in Escherichia coli. These vectors allow us to generate HIV-1 RT heterodimers in which either the p66 or the p51 subunit has the wild-type sequence and the other subunit has a specific amino acid substitution. We used these vectors to express HIV-1 RT heterodimers containing several different amino acid substitutions reported to confer resistance to nonnucleoside inhibitors. Most of the amino acid substitutions conferred resistance to nonnucleoside inhibitors R86183 (TIBO) and TSAO-m3T only when present in the p66 subunit of the p66-p51 heterodimer; heterodimers that contained a wild-type p66 subunit and a mutant p51 subunit remained sensitive to the inhibitors. However, there was one mutation, E138K, that conferred drug resistance when the mutation was present in the p51 subunit. The corresponding heterodimer with the E138K mutation in the p66 subunit and a wild-type p51 subunit remained sensitive to the inhibitors. Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of HIV-1 RT indicated that residue 138 of the p51 subunit is in the nonnucleoside inhibitor-binding pocket while residue 138 of the p66 subunit is not. The mutagenesis results, combined with structural data, support the idea that the nonnucleoside inhibitors exert their effects by binding to a hydrophobic pocket in the RT heterodimer and that mutations which give rise to drug resistance directly interfere with the interactions between the nonnucleoside inhibitors and HIV-1 RT.",

CCK8 (20 pmol/side) modified these levels only in the posterior N. Acc. and these responses were inhibited by the CCK-A antagonist devazepide. Five min after treatment, DA, DOPAC and HVA were increased in the N. Acc.shell and 10 min later they were decreased in the N. Acc.core. These data suggest that in these regions CCK8 could both abolish the influence of DA from the core on the transmission of motor information and favor that of DA from the shell on emotional-like responses.",

The L-365,260 effect was also prevented by the dopamine receptor antagonist, SCH-23,390 (a dopamine D1-selective receptor antagonist: R(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl- 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine) and sulpiride (a dopamine D2-selective receptor antagonist: (-)-5-(aminosulfonyl)-N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl) methyl]-2-metoxybenzamide). On the other hand, co-administration of subthreshold doses of L-365,260 and nomifensine (an atypical antidepressant that selectively blocks dopamine re-uptake mechanisms, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4-phenyl-8-isoquinolinamine) led to a potent antidepressant-type response. These results indicate that blocking of CCKB receptors could result in an increase of extracellular dopamine contents in some brain areas involved in depression and suggest a potential use of CCKB receptor antagonists, alone or combined with antidepressants, in the treatment of depressive syndromes.",

Tripitramine distinguishes Hm2 vs. Hm4 by a factor of 24 and vs. Hm3 and Hm5 by a factor of 142 and 125, respectively. A lower affinity ratio, about 6-fold, was found between muscarinic Hm2 and Hm1 receptors.

In the present study, the regulation of [3H]PK 11195-binding to PBRs in cultured rat astrocytes that had been previously exposed to NH4Cl was investigated. 24 h treatment of 21-28-day-old cultures with 2, 5 or 10 mM NH4Cl resulted in 25 +/- 3, 48 +/- 3 and 42 +/- 4% increase in the number of [3H]PK 11195-binding sites, respectively. No further change in [3H]PK 11195-binding was observed after exposure of astrocytes to 5 mM NH4Cl for 48 or 72 h. Ammonia treatment did not cause any significant alteration in the affinity of [3H]PK 11195 for PBRs. The present study demonstrates the susceptibility of the PK 11195-binding site of PBRs in cultured astrocytes to ammonia and suggests that increase in brain ammonia concentration causes a supersensitivity of PBRs.", 
    "43": "The effect of the muscarinic M1 and M2 antagonists (pirenzepine and gallamine) on heterosynaptic short-term depression (HSTD) of the CA1 population spike was studied in rat hippocampal slices. HSTD was evoked by a train of 30-50 pulses at 5 Hz (theta-like stimulation; TLS) delivered to the stratum oriens. Bath-applied pirenzepine (10(-6)-3 x 10(-6) M) significantly suppressed the magnitude of HSTD in the tested radiatum input (56 +/- 26% of control, p < 0.05). In contrast, gallamine (10(-6)-10(-5) M) did not suppress HSTD (102 +/- 7%). An enhancement of HSTD during application of eserine was also antagonized by pirenzepine (71 +/- 18%, p < 0.01), but not by gallamine (152 +/- 85%). These data suggest that acetylcholine synaptically released during TLS of the stratum oriens significantly contributes to HSTD in the CA1 region by activation of the M1 muscarinic receptor subtype.",

Using an in vitro autoradiographic technique that permits selective labeling of mAChR subtypes by radioligand binding, this study provides the first quantitative map of mAChR subtypes in cat brain stem areas important for REM sleep generation. M1, M2 and M3 mAChR subtypes were distributed heterogeneously throughout the brain stem. For all 3 mAChR subtypes, the greatest levels of binding were found in the dorsal raphe and locus coeruleus, and the least amount of binding was in the reticular formation. These findings are consistent with data from in vivo studies showing that multiple mAChR subtypes are involved in REM sleep generation.",

    "46": "This report describes the effects of midazolam and beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ethyl ester (beta-CCE) on extracellular concentrations of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens of freely moving rats measured by in vivo microdialysis. The two compounds had opposite effects, midazolam (0.075 and 0.15 mg/kg i.v.) dose dependently decreasing, and beta-CCE (3 and 10 mg/kg i.p.) dose dependently increasing, dialysate concentrations of dopamine. Flumazenil (6 micrograms/kg i.v.) did not affect the efflux of dopamine but it prevented the effects of both midazolam and beta-CCE on dopamine efflux. N6-Cyclohexyladenosine (0.1, and 1 mg/kg i.p.), a selective adenosine A1 agonist, dose dependently increased the efflux of dopamine. This effect was blocked by 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (25 mg/kg i.p.), a selective adenosine A1 receptor antagonist, a dose which given alone did not affect dopamine efflux; responses to midazolam were not affected. 3,7-Dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine (1 and 3 mg/kg i.p.), a selective adenosine A2 receptor antagonist, did not mimic the effects of beta-CCE. The results suggest that midazolam and beta-CCE modulate dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens by an action at the benzodiazepine binding site associated with the GABAA receptor complex.", 
    "47": "Abecarnil (0.1-1 mg/kg i.p.), a new anxioselective and anticonvulsant ligand of benzodiazepine receptors, like diazepam (2.5-10 mg/kg i.p.) inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the basal release of acetylcholine in the hippocampus of freely moving rats. In contrast, whereas diazepam inhibited the basal output of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, abecarnil had no such effect. The effects of both abecarnil and diazepam were antagonized by prior treatment with flumazenil at a dose (1 mg/kg i.p.) that per se had no effect on acetylcholine or dopamine release. The results suggest that abecarnil has different intrinsic efficacies at gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors involved in the regulation of acetylcholine release in the hippocampus and dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex, two brain areas important in cognitive function and emotional state, respectively.", 
    "48": "The coupling of muscarinic-cholinergic receptors (mAChR) to adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C (PLC) second messenger systems has been demonstrated in many animal species. However, little is known about this association in the developing human central nervous system. Because of the proposed role of acetylcholine in the regulation of development and differentiation of neural cells, an understanding of these relationships during human fetal development gains importance. We report, in this communication, the coupling of mAChR with PLC in the human fetal brain. This coupling was determined using two independent approaches that relied upon estimating the accumulation of inositol phosphates (IPs) and cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG). Carbachol treatment of brain slices, in the presence of lithium, resulted in the accumulation of IPs. Analysis of the kinetics of this accumulation showed that IP3 and IP2 increased rapidly, reaching a peak or plateau before IP. The results also showed that agonist-stimulated PLC produced two second messengers, IP3 and DAG. The production of DAG was strongly supported by the carbachol-dependent increase of CDP-DAG. The accumulation of IP and CDP-DAG was dependent on agonist concentration. The obtained EC50 values were approximately: carbachol 47 microM; acetylcholine 6 microM; and oxotremorine 25 microM. Unexpectedly, all three agonists demonstrated a similar efficacy. The cholinergic stimulation of inositide hydrolysis appears to be the result of activation of the m1 muscarinic receptor.", 
    "49": "Numerous studies indicate that an acute, excessive activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) contributes to the pathophysiological sequela of TBI. The present study examined the effect of moderate fluid percussion traumatic brain injury (TBI) on binding to M1 and M2 mAChR subtypes in the hippocampal formation and adjacent cortex using quantitative autoradiography. Injured animals along with concurrent controls were sacrificed by in situ freezing at 3 h or 24 h following TBI. Slide-mounted tissue sections were incubated in either [3H]pirenzepine (23 nM) for M1 or [3H]AFDX384 (9 nM) for M2 mAChR subtype labeling. Binding of [3H]pirenzepine to the M1 mAChR subtype was not significantly altered by TBI when compared to sham-injured animals. [3H]AFDX384 binding to the M2 mAChR subtype was significantly decreased at 24 h in hippocampal CA2-3 region and dorsal blade of the dentate gyrus (P < 0.05). The differences observed between M1 and M2 subtypes suggests that these muscarinic subtypes may differentially contribute to the pathophysiology of TBI.",

The use of a single internal standard (halazepam) for the quantification of all compounds saved cost and time. The detection limits were 0.1 ng/ml for N-hydroxyethyl-flurazepam-TMS (M(r) = 404), 0.5 ng/ml for desalkyl-flurazepam-TMS (M(r) = 360), and 0.5 ng/ml for flurazepam (M(r) = 387) with an injection volume of 1 microliter at a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 5.

Another objective was to evaluate to which extent benzodiazepine consumption can be induced by hospitalization. A minor but statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) was observed between the proportion of male (42.7%) and female (46.5%) users. Besides, when evaluating the consumption in number of defined daily doses per 100 beddays, there was little difference between the consumption of male (51.2 defined daily doses per 100 beddays) and female (52.8 defined daily doses per 100 beddays) patients. A significant influence of age was also observed with an increase of benzodiazepine use for patients aged from 15-20 to 40-45, followed by a progressive decrease for higher ages. With hypnotics, no peak of consumption related to age was observed but an increase of consumption from age 15-20 to 30-35. For higher ages the consumption of hypnotics was nearly stable or rising slowly. High variations in benzodiazepine utilization were recorded between hospital wards (median: 50.77 defined daily doses per 100 beddays, range 0.23-263.9). Finally, it was found that 6.8% of patients with a benzodiazepine treatment initiated during hospitalization may be considered as potential benzodiazepine consumers after discharge.",

    "53": "These experiments tested the hypothesis that cross-tolerance between ethanol (EtOH) and diazepam would occur in a drug discrimination paradigm. One group of rats (n = 28) was trained to discriminate EtOH (1.0g/kg, i.p.) from vehicle; another group of rats (n = 10) was trained to discriminate diazepam (5.6mg/kg, i.p.) from vehicle. Subjects were trained using a two-lever choice procedure where food was delivered under a fixed-ratio 10 schedule of reinforcement. In rats trained to detect EtOH, both EtOH (0.1-1.78g/kg) and diazepam (0.32-10mg/kg) dose dependently substituted for EtOH. Chronic administration of EtOH (6.8g/kg/12h for 7 days) resulted in 3-fold tolerance to EtOH and 6-fold cross-tolerance to the ability of diazepam to substitute for EtOH; chronic administration of diazepam (20mg/kg/8h for 7 days) failed to confer cross-tolerance to EtOH nor did it produce tolerance to the ability of diazepam to substitute for EtOH. In rats trained to detect diazepam, diazepam (0.56-10mg/kg) but not EtOH (0.1-1.78g/kg) substituted for diazepam. Chronic administration of diazepam (20mg/kg/8h for 7 days) produced 3-fold tolerance to diazepam; in contrast, chronic administration of EtOH (6.8g/kg/12h for 7 days) failed to confer cross-tolerance to diazepam. The dissociation of the cross-substitution and cross-tolerance patterns between EtOH and diazepam suggests that the population of benzodiazepine receptors that mediates substitution of diazepam for EtOH differs from the population of benzodiazepine receptors that mediates substitution of diazepam for diazepam.", 
    "54": "Many violent crimes have been associated with alcohol intoxication, but experimental research in laboratory animals has been largely inconclusive on alcohol effects on aggression. A focus on individual differences rather than group statistics has revealed that low doses of ethanol cause large and repeatable increases in aggressive behavior in subgroups of rodents and primates. The recent progress using in vivo neuropharmacological techniques makes it feasible to explore differences in brain mechanisms in animals that show enhanced aggression after ethanol vs those that do not. Effects of ethanol on three major neurotransmitter systems (i.e. GABA, serotonin, dopamine) are examined. Since these neurotransmitter substances are critically important in the neurobiology of various kinds of aggressive behavior in rodent and primate species, they are potential mechanisms by which ethanol alters aggressive behavior. Direct research on the relevance of the physiological interaction between ethanol and the GABA receptor suggests that at least some of the effects of alcohol on aggression involve the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex. The role of serotonin (5-HT) will have to be newly defined in light of the findings that ethanol increases 5-HT release in several forebrain areas, in a dose range that can stimulate aggressive behavior in a subgroup of individuals. Recent in vivo studies show that acute exposure to ethanol increases dopamine release in discrete dopamine terminal areas, and that the initiation and execution of aggressive and defensive behavior are also synchronized with increased dopamine activity in these brain regions.", 
    "55": "Seven of 63 children (11%) treated with clobazam (CLB) for refractory epilepsy developed a severe behavior disorder. This disorder was characterized by aggressive agitation, self injurious behavior, insomnia, and incessant motor activity occurring between 10 and 55 days after initiation of drug therapy. The affected children were relatively young (mean age 6.4 years) and developmentally disabled (four were autistic and two had isolated mental retardation). The disorder occurred with a short latency after initiation of therapy and at a relatively low dosage of CLB. Serum levels of other coadministered antiepileptic drugs were unchanged by the administration of CLB. One child was taking CLB monotherapy. This behavioral deterioration required the discontinuation of CLB, after which patients returned to their previous behavior within 3 weeks. After > 3 years of follow-up all children continue to require multiple antiepileptic drugs but have not had a recurrence of this aggressive agitation. The mechanism of the behavioral change is unclear.", 
    "56": "The anxiolytic and memory-impairing effects of compounds that act at strychnine-insensitive (SI) glycine receptors were examined and compared with those of a competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (AP7); a use-dependent channel blocker, dizocilpine; and a benzodiazepine agonist, diazepam (DZP). Mice were trained to avoid a dark compartment and their latencies to step through were measured either within 1 hr after training in the presence of the drug (to assess the anxiolytic effects) or 24 hr after pre- or post-training treatment (to assess the effects on learning and memory). Post-training administration of the glycinergic compounds 1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid, 7-chlorokynurenic acid and D-cycloserine reduced step-through latencies when testing was performed 30 min after drug treatment and within 1 h after training. Latencies were unaltered by these glycinergic compounds when testing was performed 24 hr later. Similar results were obtained with AP7 and DZP. In contrast, an amnesic dose of pentylenetetrazole reduced latencies both within 1 and 24 hr after training. Pretreatment with glycine abolished the reduction in latencies observed with SI glycine receptor ligands 1 hr after training but did not antagonize the reduction produced by AP7. Pretraining administration of SI glycine receptor ligands did not alter step-through latencies measured 24 hr later. In contrast, under these same conditions, AP7, dizocilpine and DZP produced a significant reduction in latencies. These results demonstrate that compounds that act at SI glycine receptors do not impair learning and memory at doses that are anxiolytic in a single-trial punishment paradigm.", 
    "57": "The present study was designed to determine whether chronic benzodiazepine (BZ) agonist treatment alters the \"set point\" of the BZ pharmacological profile. This was achieved by investigating the modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated [36Cl-] influx by BZ ligands, as well as pentobarbital after chronic flurazepam treatment, in well characterized mammalian cortical neurons. Chronic flurazepam treatment (5 microM, 10 days) produced decreased efficacy of BZ agonists (diazepam and flunitrazepam) and inverse agonists (methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3'-carboxylate and ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate), as measured by GABA-induced [36Cl-] influx. The chronic flurazepam treatment, although not altering their EC50/IC50 values, decreased the Emax/-Emax values. Furthermore, the decreased efficacy was reversed after a 72-hr withdrawal, and by concomitant exposure of the neurons to Ro15-1788 (ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5 alpha][1,4]- BZ-3-carboxylate), a BZ receptor antagonist, but not by R 5135 (3 alpha-hydroxy-16-imino-5 beta-17-androstan-11-one; a GABA receptor antagonist) and pircrotoxin (a channel blocker). The chronic flurazepam treatment also produced uncoupling between pentobarbital and BZ receptor sites, and decreased the efficacy of pentobarbital to enhance GABA-mediated [36Cl-] influx, events also reversed at 72-hr withdrawal and concomitant exposure to Ro15-1788. Chronic flurazepam treatment-induced uncoupling and decreased efficacy of BZ agonists was not reversed by the GABAA receptor antagonist, R 5135, or channel blocker, picrotoxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Probenecid decreased adinazolam oral clearance, renal N-desmethyladinazolam clearance, and the amount of N-desmethyladinazolam excreted in the urine. Probenecid increased the N-desmethyladinazolam/adinazolam AUC ratio, adinazolam maximum concentration (Cmax), N-desmethyladinazolam Cmax, and N-desmethyladinazolam time to reach Cmax. Uric acid renal clearance was increased significantly by adinazolam or probenecid administration compared with placebo; however, coadministration of adinazolam plus probenecid had no additive effect on uric acid clearance. Psychomotor performance was decreased in the adinazolam plus probenecid treatment compared with the adinazolam treatment. Probenecid potentiated the psychomotor effects of adinazolam after coadministration of the compounds, predominantly because of alterations in N-desmethyladinazolam pharmacokinetics. Therefore the adinazolam dose may need to be reduced when coadministered with probenecid.",

All patients received intravenous midazolam 2 mg and intravenous fentanyl 50 micrograms, followed by an infusion of either propofol 25-150 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 or midazolam 0.5-4 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. At the end of the operation, patients were intravenously administered either 10 ml saline (groups 1 and 3) or flumazenil 1 mg in 10 ml saline (groups 2 and 4). Amnesia was assessed by determining recall of pictures shown before and after the procedure. Subjective feelings of sedation, anxiety, clumsiness, and fatigue were evaluated using 100-mm visual analogue scales preoperatively and at 30-min intervals in the recovery room. Cognitive function was assessed using the digit-symbol substitution test at similar intervals. Early recovery was evaluated by the ability of the patients to be transferred directly from the operating room to the step-down unit, as well as by times to ambulation and discharge.

    "64": "Previous experiments showed that exposure of sympathetic ganglia to exogenous adenosine increased acetylcholine (ACh) content and its subsequent release. This effect was not mediated through extracellular adenosine receptors, but at an intracellular site following its uptake through nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBTI)-resistant nucleoside transporters. We postulated that endogenous adenosine may play a role in modulating synaptic transmission in the superior cervical ganglion. The present study tested whether adenosine is involved in the activation of ACh synthesis that occurs during a rest period following prolonged presynaptic tetanic activity. Conditioning of ganglia with high-frequency stimulation (15 Hz) for 45 min followed by a 15 min rest increased their ACh content by 45%. The appearance of this \"rebound ACh\" showed sensitivity to nucleoside transport inhibitors; it was prevented by dipyridamole, but not by NBTI or meclonazepam, and it was reduced in the presence of RO 11-3624, suggesting an involvement of NBTI-resistant transporters. The effect of dipyridamole was specific for the synthesis of rebound ACh in that it did not inhibit ACh release or ACh synthesis during stimulation. The inhibitory action of dipyridamole on the synthesis of rebound ACh was not evident if it was present only during the tetanic stimulation but it was if dipyridamole was present during the rest period following it, suggesting that adenosine's presence after tetanic stimulation is of importance. This conclusion was strengthened by experiments showing that the presence of cyclopentyltheophylline, an antagonist at inhibitory adenosine receptors, increased ACh output evoked by test stimulation immediately following tetanic activity, as if endogenous adenosine was available at that time to activate the adenosine receptors that inhibit transmitter release. ACh release from conditioned ganglia was 44% greater than that from the controls. However, the rebound ACh was not mobilized in the presence of 2-(4-phenylpiperidino)cyclohexanol (vesamicol), a vesicular ACh transporter inhibitor. These results suggest that endogenous adenosine released after tetanic stimulation activates ACh synthesis, which results in an increase of ganglionic ACh that is available for subsequent mobilization and release.",

The groups were similar in demographics, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores, ICU admission diagnosis, underlying disease processes, and supplemental analgesic administration. The mean time to achieve initial adequate sedation was 124 mins for lorazepam and 105 mins for midazolam.

Effective sedation was evaluated in a randomized, prospective study in 42 ASA 1 and 2 patients, in a factorial design. Eighteen patients were sedated with .5% midazolam INS. Ten patients received intravenous PCS via a patient-controlled analgesia pump containing midazolam, and 14 patients received intermittent intravenous boluses of 1 mg midazolam given as needed (BIVS). Appropriate local anesthetic nerve blocks with 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine, and supplementary inhalation of nitrous oxide and oxygen via a nasal mask, were also given to all patients in the study. The dosage requirement with PCS was higher than that found with INS or BIVS. However, PCS produced some anxiety reduction when compared with INS and BIVS. It also reduced interfering movements during treatment more effectively than the other sedation modes. No complications were detected in any of the patients and they were able to leave the clinic within 1 hour after completion of treatment.",

    "85": "The muscarinic receptors involved in phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis have been pharmacologically characterized in cat cerebral blood vessels. Carbachol elicited a concentration-dependent increase in inositol phosphate accumulation [inositol monophosphate, bisphosphate, trisphosphate (IP3) and tetrakisphosphate] in both major cerebral arteries and small pial vessels, which reached 140-280% of baseline at 10(-3) M carbachol (referred to as maximal effect). However, the inositol phosphate accumulation response was found to be biphasic with a submaximal effect (30-50% of the maximal stimulation) obtained at low carbachol concentrations (< 10(-5) M). Endothelial denudation induced a virtual disappearance of the submaximal PI response without affecting that elicited by high concentrations of carbachol. The pharmacology of the two carbachol-induced PI responses was investigated by comparing the potency of selected muscarinic antagonists to block the IP3 accumulation induced by 10(-7) M (endothelium-dependent submaximal effect) and 10(-4) M (endothelium-independent near-maximal effect) carbachol. In both major arteries and pial vessels, the activation of IP3 production by 10(-4) M carbachol was similarly inhibited by muscarinic antagonists with the following averaged rank order of potency (in -log IC50): 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP; 8.65) > pirenzepine (8.28) > 6-chloro-5,10-dihydro-5-[(1-methyl-4-piperidinyl)acetyl]-11H- dibenzo[b,e][1,4]diazepine-11-one (UH-AH 371; 7.87) > 11-[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,-11- dihydro-6H-pyridol[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116; 6.62), a pharmacological profile compatible with an M1 receptor subtype.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "86": "In this study, we have examined whether the Tat antagonist can inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in the presence of cofactors that can activate transcription of HIV-1 provirus by an NF-kappa B-mediated mechanism, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection. As a prototype, we have chosen a low-molecular-weight Tat inhibitor, Ro5-3335, and analyzed its effect on HIV-1 replication in the presence of TNF-alpha and HSV-1 infection in acutely infected peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and T cells. Ro5-3335 inhibited HIV-1 replication both in CEM-174 cells and in PBLs, but the magnitude of the inhibition was inversely related to viral inoculum and the inhibition was only temporary; viral replication resumed at later times postinfection in spite of the continuous presence of the drug. In contrast, Ro5-3335 suppressed TNF-alpha-induced activation of HIV-1 replication in chronically infected T cells and monocytes that both expressed only low levels of HIV-1 constitutively, while its effect in high-expressing OM-10.1 cells was negligible in the presence of TNF-alpha. The inhibition of HIV-1 replication by Ro5-3335 was specific for the Tat-mediated effect and this drug was not able to inhibit the TNF-alpha-induced expression of the tat-defective HIV-1 provirus. In contrast to TNF-alpha, HSV-1-stimulated HIV-1 expression in the ACH-2 cells was effectively inhibited in the presence of Ro5-3335. These results demonstrate that Tat plays an essential role in HSV-1-mediated activation of HIV-1 provirus, while the TNF-alpha complementation of Tat shows cell-type specificity. These observations suggest that inhibition of the Tat function alone may not be sufficient for an effective anti-HIV-1 inhibition.", 
    "87": "The present study examined whether benzodiazepine (BZ) intake alters performance and selected hormonal and metabolic variables during submaximal exercise. Seven triathletes completed two cycling trials at 85% maximum O2 uptake starting 3 h after an ingestion of either a placebo (PLA) of gelatin or BZ (1.5 mg lorazepam) and continuing until exhaustion, according to a double-blind randomized protocol. Blood samples were collected at rest; 5, 10, and 15 min; and exhaustion for dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (Epi), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol (CORT), insulin (INS), free fatty acid, blood glucose, and lactate (La) determinations. Time of cycling was not significantly changed after BZ or PLA administration (22.9 +/- 2.5 vs. 23.5 +/- 3.8 min, respectively). A decrease in CORT and an increase in INS (P < 0.05) were observed with BZ before cycling. In comparison with rest, exercise resulted in a decrease in INS and an increase in all the other variables investigated (P < 0.001), but DA, NE, Epi, ACTH, CORT, La, and free fatty acid were significantly less elevated under BZ (P < 0.05). No change was found in glucose and INS levels between the two treatments at the end of the test. There was a strong correlation under both PLA and BZ conditions between DA, NE, Epi, and ACTH and also between Epi and La levels. From these data, BZ intake did appear to alter metabolism but did not influence performance during intense submaximal exercise.", 
    "88": "All of the established antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can produce cognitive side effects, which are increased with polypharmacy and with increasing dosage and anticonvulsant blood levels. However, cognitive side effects are usually modest for AED monotherapy with anticonvulsant blood levels within the standard therapeutic ranges. Further, these effects are offset in part by reduced seizure activity. Controversy exists regarding possible differential cognitive effects of AEDs. A large portion of the literature examining the comparative cognitive effects of AEDs is limited by inadequate study designs. When these design flaws are considered, there is no convincing evidence of clinically significant differences in cognitive side effects of AEDs except possibly for bromide, phenobarbital and benzodiazepines. The role of cognitive side effects should be kept in proper perspective when choosing AED therapy. The cognitive side effects of anticonvulsant drugs may be overt but many times are rather subtle. It is important though to be able to recognize these effects and to put them into perspective as to how they affect our patients.", 
    "89": "The authors present their clinical experience with the oral administration of lorazepam, methadone, and pentobarbital to prevent or treat withdrawal symptoms following prolonged sedation in the PICU patient. The 3 patients presented required prolonged sedation for mechanical ventilation. Different agents were used for sedation in the 3 patients including intravenous fentanyl, midazolam, and pentobarbital. The switch to oral agents must take into consideration the differences in potency, half-life, and oral bioavailability between the agents. The authors discuss the appropriate conversion factors for opioids, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates. The switch to oral administration eliminated the need for intravenous access in the 3 patients and allowed for earlier discharge home. All 3 patients were discharged home on an oral, taper schedule. Such an approach may lead to earlier home discharge thereby improving the patient's quality of life as well as saving health care dollars.", 
    "90": "Although it is generally believed that pregnancy is a time of emotional well-being, many women develop or have a recurrence of psychiatric illness during this time. The risks associated with leaving a woman untreated during pregnancy are potentially substantial and must be weighed against the risks of exposing the fetus to the potentially teratogenic medications. Large prospective and retrospective studies suggest a relative safety of use of tricyclic antidepressants during pregnancy. Data available for neuroleptics, lithium, benzodiazepines, and the anticonvulsants valproic acid and carbamazepine, although mixed, point to increased risks of congenital malformations in the children of mothers exposed to these agents in the first trimester of pregnancy. Very little is known about the behavioral abnormalities in offspring of mothers exposed to these agents. Animal studies suggest changes in brain receptor number and function in the offspring of mothers on a variety of psychotropic drugs studied to date. The few human studies do not suggest long term effects, but given the very limited data, no definitive conclusions can be drawn. Large epidemiologic follow-up studies of children exposed to medication in utero may help clarify questions relating to behavioral changes and thus help guide clinical decisions.",

    "92": "Tilia species are traditional medicinal plants widely used in Latin America as sedatives and tranquilizers. For this purpose, the infusion of their inflorescences is used to prepare a tea. In this study extracts of inflorescences from Tilia tomentosa Moench, one of the species found in the market, were purified using a benzodiazepine (BZD) binding assay to detect BZD receptor ligands in the different fractions. One of the ligands was identified as kaempferol, but it had low affinity (Ki = 93 microM) for this receptor, and did not produce sedative or anxiolytic effects in mice. On the other hand, a complex fraction, containing as yet unidentified constituents, but probably of a flavonoid nature, when administered intraperitoneally in mice, had a clear anxiolytic effect in both the elevated plus-maze and holeboard tests, two well validated pharmacological tests to measure anxiolytic and sedative compounds. This active fraction had no effect on total and ambulatory locomotor activity. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the occurrence of active principle(s) in, at least, one species of Tilia that may explain its ethnopharmacological use as an anxiolytic.", 
    "93": "The mechanism underlying the previous findings that the development of antinociceptive tolerance to morphine was significantly delayed in the presence of inflammatory pain induced by formalin was examined. Measurements of the pain threshold at different time intervals have shown that pain lasts around one week in the formalin treated mice. A single dose of indomethacin (10 mg/kg) or aspirin (400 mg/kg), 30 min before formalin injection, and daily 400 mg/kg of aspirin had no effects on the pain threshold or swelling, and it also did not affect the delay of morphine tolerance development. Daily administration of diazepam, 1 mg/kg, 1 hr before morphine injection completely abolished the delay. This effect was antagonized by 2 mg/kg of flumazenil, administered 15 min before diazepam injection. These results suggest that pain-associated anxiety participates in the delay of morphine tolerance development and consequently the benzodiazepine-receptor complex plays a role in the development of morphine tolerance during a painful state.", 
    "94": "Effects of KW-5805, a new antiulcer agent, on various experimental ulcers, necrotizing agent-induced gastric lesions and gastric acid secretion in rats were compared with those of pirenzepine and cimetidine. KW-5805 showed antiulcer activities against experimental gastric and duodenal ulcers (ED50 = 1.2-10.0 mg/kg, p.o.). KW-5805 effectively inhibited gastric lesions induced by various necrotizing agents (ED50 = 4.5-39.8 mg/kg, p.o.). In addition, the cytoprotective effect of KW-5805 was not affected by indomethacin, but reserved by N-ethylmaleimide. These antiulcer and cytoprotective effects of KW-5805 were more potent than those of pirenzepine and cimetidine. In pylorus-ligated rats, intraduodenal KW-5805 administration at 30 mg/kg showed a weak antisecretory effect, which was 3-10 times less potent than those of pirenzepine and cimetidine. In rats with acute gastric fistula, intravenous injection of KW-5805 reduced methacholine-stimulated gastric acid secretion at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg and inhibited tetragastrin-induced acid secretion at 30 mg/kg. These results indicate that KW-5805 has potent and broad antiulcer properties, which are probably exerted by its potent cytoprotective effect in addition to its antisecretory effect.", 
    "95": "The effect of a mixture of valepotriates on the elevated plus-maze performance of diazepam withdrawn rats was evaluated. The rats were chronically (28 days) treated with diazepam (doses increased up to 5.0 mg/kg) and then treated with control solution for 3 days to induce a withdrawal syndrome. Chronically vehicle-treated rats were used as control. The abstinent animals treated with vehicle showed a significant decrease in the percentage of time spent in the open arms when compared with the control animals. Diazepam and valerian 12.0 mg/kg reversed this anxiogenic effect. Valerian 6.0 mg/kg did not show any difference in relation to the others group.",

Because drug treatment and physiotherapy are only of sufficient value in a minority, most patients seek benefit from numerous other therapies, none of which has been shown to improve ST.", 
    "97": "The mRNA levels of four immediate early genes (IEG) were measured in rat brain regions 60 min after administration of pilocarpine (30 mg/kg) to lithium-treated (3 mmol/kg) rats, during generalized convulsive status epilepticus. Northern blots demonstrated induction of the genes in the order of c-fos = jun-B > c-jun > jun-D with large increases in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum, a smaller increase in the cerebellum, and less in the brainstem. The mRNA levels of these four IEG were measured in rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus at several times after administration of the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine (5 or 30 mg/kg) with or without lithium pretreatment (3 mmol/kg, 16 h prior, or chronic 4 week dietary administration). Treatment with pilocarpine (30 mg/kg) alone increased mRNA levels in the order of c-fos > jun-B > c-jun but did not change the jun-D mRNA level, and maximal c-fos and jun-B mRNA levels occurred earlier (30 min) in the cortex than in the hippocampus. Treatment with the lower dose of pilocarpine (5 mg/kg) alone caused only small increases in c-fos and jun-B mRNA levels and these responses were unaffected by lithium pretreatment. Lithium pretreatment potentiated IEG expression induced by 30 mg/kg pilocarpine, likely as a result of the seizures caused by this combination of drugs because pretreatment with anticonvulsants (diazepam or MK-801) blocked seizures and the enhanced IEG mRNA levels. The mRNA levels were increased during seizures in the order of c-fos > jun-B > c-jun > jun-D in the hippocampus and jun-B > c-fos > c-jun > jun-D in the cortex, and were increased for a longer duration as well as to a greater extent than after administration of pilocarpine alone. Administration of pilocarpine (30 mg/kg) to rats treated chronically with lithium caused increases similar to those measured with acute lithium pretreatment. Thus the induction of IEG by cholinergic stimulation varied with dose, time, and brain region, and unique responses were observed for each of the IEG. Lithium pretreatment did not impair IEG expression induced by the lower dose of pilocarpine and greatly enhanced expression of IEG after administration of the higher dose of pilocarpine concomitant with seizure activity.", 
    "98": "Oxazepam is a benzodiazepine widely used as a sedative-hypnotic and antianxiety drug. In chronic studies, groups of 60 male and 60 female Swiss-Webster (SW) or B6C3F1 mice received oxazepam in feed at concentrations of 0,2500, or 5000 ppm. Additional groups of 60 male and female B6C3F1 mice received 125 ppm in feed to allow for study of mice with serum concentrations of oxazepam similar to those achieved in humans taking a therapeutic dose. At 57 weeks, treatment-related mortality of exposed SW mice caused the study to be terminated. Enhanced systemic amyloidosis contributing to heart failure was considered the principal cause of death. Hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas were increased in exposed SW mice. Survival of B6C3F1 mice receiving 2500 and 5000 ppm oxazepam was also lower than that of controls. Early deaths were due to increased incidences of hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, and nearly all mice receiving 2500 or 5000 ppm developed hepatocellular neoplasia. An increase in follicular cell hyperplasia of the thyroid gland occurred in all exposed groups of B6C3F1 mice, and thyroid gland follicular cell adenoma was increased in exposed females. Further studies of the capacity of oxazepam to induce liver cell mitogenesis and an evaluation of the frequency of activated H- and K-ras oncogenes in the liver tumors of B6C3F1 mice has shown that many of the neoplastic and nonneoplastic responses of mice to oxazepam resemble those observed with phenobarbital.", 
    "99": "The overall quality of drug prescription is based on three elements: structural, procedural and result quality. In order to improve the clinical outcome (= result quality) of a patient, only drugs with a proven efficacy and a well known risk/benefit-relation should be prescribed. However, in 1992 in Germany, 31.1% of the ambulatory drug prescriptions were for drugs with questionable efficacy or dubious combination preparations. These expenditures therefore cannot be justified, neither from a pharmacological point of view nor from an economic standpoint. One of the main reasons for this poor prescribing quality is a poor structural quality, i.e. too many drugs and lack of transparency on the market and a producer-oriented drug information. In order to improve this structural quality, a drug list will be established by a group of 33 pharmacologists, physicians and pharmacists from 15 European countries. This list aims at 66 diseases, which are thought to be the most common for the general practitioners everyday routine. For these illnesses drug therapies are recommended including information on drug side-effects, possible interactions and contra-indications. Furthermore, basing on published literature, all possible drugs for the 66 indications will be discussed explaining and underlining the choice of the European Formulary Group. However, even a comprehensive drug list may not rule out insufficient procedural quality, i.e. too lengthy prescriptions of benzodiazepines, but may hopefully facilitate the rational choice of drugs and therefore improve patients outcome.", 
    "100": "This review summarizes the results of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies in man with pantoprazole, a new, selective proton pump inhibitor. Different mechanisms have to be considered as causes for potential drug-drug interactions. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in general may alter the absorption of drugs by increasing the intragastric pH. Due to the presence of an imidazole ring, the PPIs of the class of substituted benzimidazole sulfoxides may interfere with the metabolism of other drugs by altering the activity of drug metabolizing enzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, via either induction or inhibition. With the increasing use of PPIs, their interaction potential gains therapeutic importance as was the case with the first and second generation of H2-blockers (cimetidine and ranitidine, respectively). The enhanced selectivity of pantoprazole to the gastric H+/K(+)-ATPase characterizes the new PPI generation. In comparison to omeprazole and lansoprazole, pantoprazole showed a much lower affinity to cytochrome P450 in vitro and a markedly lower potency in the in vivo rat model for interaction with diazepam. In contrast to omeprazole, pantoprazole does not interact with the cytochrome P450 system in man. In the drug interaction studies conducted so far, pantoprazole did not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of antipyrine, diazepam, digoxin, a hormonal contraceptive, nifedipine, phenytoin, theophylline and warfarin in man. Also pantoprazole neither induced the drug metabolism of antipyrine nor increased urinary excretion of the induction markers D-glucaric acid and 6 beta-hydroxycortisol. Vice versa, the investigated drugs had no relevant influence on the pharmacokinetics of pantoprazole.", 
    "101": "The influence of multiple doses of vinpocetine (10 mg three times daily) on the steady state plasma concentrations of oxazepam (10 mg three times daily) was studied in 16 healthy subjects. The mean (+/- s.d.) AUC (ng ml-1h-1) of oxazepam over 24 h during combined treatment was 4716 +/- 2296 and for oxazepam treatment alone it was 4737 +/- 2448 (95% confidence intervals for ratio of means = 95.4-103.7%). The degree of plasma protein binding of oxazepam was 98.11 +/- 0.32% and was not affected by vinpocetine. Independent of vinpocentine treatment a significant diurnal change in the plasma binding of oxazepam was observed; the free drug fraction was 20% higher during the night than during the day. Cmax and AUC values based on total oxazepam in plasma were 10% lower during the night. The results indicate a lack of influence of vinpocetine on oxazepam kinetics. Diurnal changes in the plasma binding of oxazepam probably have no clinical consequences.", 
    "102": "1. The primary metabolism of diazepam was studied in human liver microsomes in order to investigate the kinetics and to identify the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms responsible for the formation of the main diazepam metabolites, temazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam. 2. The formation kinetics of both metabolites were atypical and consistent with the occurrence of substrate activation. A sigmoid Vmax model equivalent to the Hill equation was used to fit the data. The degree of sigmoidicity was greater for temazepam formation than for N-desmethyldiazepam formation, so that the ratio of desmethyldiazepam:temazepam formation increased as the substrate (diazepam) concentration decreased. 3. alpha-Naphthoflavone activated both reactions but with a greater effect on temazepam formation than on N-desmethyldiazepam formation. In the presence of 25 microM alpha-naphthoflavone the kinetics for both pathways were approximated by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. 4. Studies with a series of CYP isoform selective inhibitors and with an inhibitory anti-CYP2C antibody indicated that temazepam formation was carried out mainly by CYP3A isoforms, whereas the formation of N-desmethyldiazepam was mediated by both CYP3A isoforms and S-mephenytoin hydroxylase.", 
    "103": "It is suggested that the medical profession needs to reassess current use of benzodiazepines in light of new evidence of habituation and side effects.

    "104": "Several lines of research have suggested a link between the reward value of a drug and its ability to stimulate locomotion. One goal of the present study was to determine whether ethanol preferentially stimulates locomotor activity in lines of rat that show a preference for ethanol. A secondary goal was to determine the extent to which the benzodiazepine-like and NMDA antagonistic action of ethanol accounted for its effect on locomotor activity. To meet these goals, the effects of varying doses of ethanol (0.125-1.0 g/kg), MK-801 (0.1-0.3 mg/kg), and chlordiazepoxide (0.3-3 mg/kg) on locomotor activity were studied in several lines of rats that had been habituated to the testing procedure. The effect of low doses of ethanol on motor activity in the Alcohol-Preferring (P) and Fawn-Hooded rats, which show a strong ethanol preference, were similar to those of the alcohol-nonpreferring (NP), Flinders Sensitive Line, and Flinders Resistant Line rats. Only the Flinder Resistant Line rats showed a small, but significant increase in locomotor activity after the administration of ethanol. The highest dose of ethanol (1.0 g/kg) produced locomotor depression in all lines except the P and NP lines, which were not tested at this dose. These findings do not support a link between locomotor stimulation by ethanol and ethanol preference. In contrast, all lines exhibited locomotor stimulation after moderate (0.1-0.3 mg/kg) doses of MK-801, but did not exhibit increases in activity following any dose of chlordiazepoxide. These data indicate that the profiles of activity after MK-801 and chlordiazepoxide were distinct from that of ethanol in the various rat lines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "105": "Both a reduction in the inhibitory effects of GABA (disinhibition) and activation of the sympathetic nervous system are manifested during the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. This study was designed to explore the relative efficacy of medications that differentially affects these two biological systems: the benzodiazepines, which attenuate GABAergic disinhibition, and the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonists, which decrease sympathetic activation. The benzodiazepine diazepam (n = 6), the alpha 2-receptor agonist clonidine (n = 7), the benzodiazepine alprazolam (this is also purported to have alpha 2-receptor agonist properties) (n = 6), and placebo (n = 6) were evaluated in their effectiveness in decreasing signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Drug-free, alcohol-dependent patients were administered 1 of the 4 medications in a double-blind design until symptoms of withdrawal, as measured by the Clinical Instrument Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised, were successfully treated. Alprazolam was significantly more efficacious than both clonidine and placebo in decreasing withdrawal symptoms. Diazepam was more effective than clonidine and placebo on some measures of withdrawal. Clonidine decreased systolic blood pressure significantly more than the other two active drugs and placebo, but was no more effective than placebo in decreasing other symptoms of withdrawal. Alprazolam did not significantly decrease blood pressure compared with diazepam or placebo. Despite the small sample size, these preliminary findings suggest that the efficacy of alprazolam in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal is related to its effect at the benzodiazepine receptor and not its alpha 2-receptor agonist properties.",

More than 80% of the patients reported suffering from insomnia for 1-5 years or longer, which indicates a chronic course. Elderly patients showed unrealistic expectations concerning duration of sleep and spend more time in bed than they realistically can expect to sleep. More than half of the elderly patients reported habitual daytime napping. Sleep-disturbed elderly patients did not differ significantly from good sleepers in their habit of taking daytime naps, but even when taking daytime naps, good sleepers slept significantly longer than the sleep-disturbed patients. A significant association was found between insomnia and mental disorders, i.e., depression and organic brain syndrome according to the diagnosis of the general physician. In about half of the cases the primary care physician was not aware that the elderly patient suffered from severe insomnia. More than half of the elderly severe insomniacs took prescribed hypnotics habitually, mainly benzodiazepines.", 
    "107": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus is a long-lasting enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission that follows brief tetanic stimulation of afferent fibers, and a candidate of neuronal substrata of learning and memory. Therefore, intensive studies have been done to elucidate the mechanism of LTP and to search for drugs having effects on LTP production. So far, we have found that LTP in mossy fiber-CA3 system of guinea pig hippocampal slices was susceptible to some neurotransmitters and nootropics, which are shown to improve learning deficiency in rodents. In the present paper, we detailed recording devices, experimental procedures and analysis of data in our laboratory. Using this experimental system, the effects of cholinergic agents on LTP of field EPSP in a mossy fiber-CA3 system were examined. A muscarinic M1-receptor antagonist pirenzepine and an M2 antagonist, AF-DX 116, at an examined concentration inhibited and facilitated, respectively, the LTP induction with no change in field EPSP amplitude evoked by test stimuli in the absence of tetanus. Thus, our experimental methods described here appear feasible for developing medication for dementia.", 
    "108": "Therapeutic drug monitoring data for clozapine were used to study interactions with other drugs. The distribution of the ratio concentration/dose (C/D) of clozapine was compared in four matched groups--patients simultaneously treated with benzodiazepines, patients on drugs that inhibit the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6, patients taking carbamazepine, and those not taking any of these drugs. No difference was seen among the monotherapy, CYP2D6, and benzodiazepine groups. Patients on carbamazepine had a mean 50% lower C/D than the monotherapy group (p < 0.001), indicating that carbamazepine is an inducer of the metabolism of clozapine. The C/D was inversely correlated to the daily dose of carbamazepine. Intraindividual comparisons in eight patients, with analyses both on and off carbamazepine, confirmed a substantial decrease of the clozapine concentration when carbamazepine was introduced. Four patients treated with clozapine were concomitantly given the antidepressant fluvoxamine. Three of them exhibited a much higher C/D ratio when on fluvoxamine compared with the monotherapy group. Two had their clozapine levels analyzed when on and off fluvoxamine. The dose-normalized clozapine concentration increased by a factor of 5-10 when fluvoxamine was added. We conclude that carbamazepine causes decreased clozapine plasma levels, while fluvoxamine increases the levels. The pathways are not known with certainty, but CYP1A2 may be of major importance for the metabolism of clozapine, since fluvoxamine is a potent inhibitor of this enzyme. A recent panel study suggests that determination of CYP1A2 activity with the caffeine test may be very useful for the dosing of clozapine. The induction of clozapine metabolism by carbamazepine might be partly mediated by CYP3A4.", 
    "109": "Recent evidence shows that rats exhibit individual differences in their locomotor response to amphetamine (AMP). Moreover, evidence has accumulated showing that high-AMP responders exhibit more mesolimbic dopaminergic (DAergic) activation in response to AMP treatment than low-AMP responders. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a peptide that is colocalised with mesolimbic DA and exerts complex modulatory actions on DA function. Two CCK receptor subtypes have been identified and selective antagonists have been developed. To examine the possible contribution of endogenous CCK mechanisms to individual differences in responsivity to AMP treatment, male Wistar rats were divided into low- and high-AMP responders based on a median split of their locomotor response to AMP and the effects of the selective CCK antagonists L365-260 (CCKB; 0.01, 0.1, 0.5 mg/kg; n = 16) and devazepide (CCKA; 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 mg/kg; n = 23) were determined. Results showed that L365-260 (0.1 mg/kg) potentiated AMP-induced hyperactivity in low-AMP responders but did not affect AMP-induced hyperactivity in high-AMP responders. Devazepide was without effect in both groups of animals. This pattern of results suggests that CCKB, but not CCKA, receptor mechanisms contribute to interindividual variation in responsivity to AMP.", 
    "110": "Morphine in high doses and its major metabolite, morphine-3-glucuronide, cause CNS excitation following intrathecal and intracerebroventricular administration by an unknown mechanism. This study investigated whether morphine and morphine-3-glucuronide interact at major excitatory (glutamate), major inhibitory (GABA or glycine), or opioid binding sites. Homogenate binding assays were performed using specific radioligands. At opioid receptors, morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine caused an equipotent sodium shift, consistent with morphine-3-glucuronide behaving as an agonist. This suggests that morphine-3-glucuronide-mediated excitation is not caused by an interaction at opioid receptors. Morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine caused a weak inhibition of the binding of 3H-MK801 (non-competitive antagonist) and 125I-ifenprodil (polyamine site antagonist), but at unphysiologically high concentrations. This suggests that CNS excitation would not result from an interaction of morphine-3-glucuronide and high-dose morphine with these sites on the NMDA receptor. Morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine inhibited the binding of 3H-muscimol (GABA receptor agonist). 3H-diazepam and 3H-flunitrazepam (benzodiazepine agonists) binding very weakly, suggesting the excitatory effects of morphine-3-glucuronide and high-dose morphine are not elicited through GABAA receptors. Morphine-3-glucuronide and high-dose morphine did not prevent re-uptake of glutamate into presynaptic nerve terminals. In addition, morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine did not inhibit the binding of 3H-strychnine (glycine receptor antagonist) to synaptic membranes prepared from bovine spinal cord. It is concluded that excitation caused by high-dose morphine and morphine-3-glucuronide is not mediated by an interaction with postsynaptic amino acid receptors.", 
    "111": "This report addresses the correlation between dose and concentration of both alprazolam and clonazepam in plasma. Patients were 43 participants in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of alprazolam and clonazepam for the treatment of panic disorder. The concentration of clonazepam in plasma was linearly related with dose, measured as milligrams per day (R = 0.724; F = 24.2; p = 0.0001) or milligrams per kilogram per day (R = 0.863; F = 58.3; p = 0.0001). The correlation between drug concentration and daily dose of alprazolam was also significant (R = 0.60; F = 9.5; p = 0.007), although the correlation between dose measured as milligrams per kilogram per day and drug level was not significant (R = 0.361; F = 2.4; p = 0.14). This replicates previous findings that, for each additional milligram per day dose of alprazolam, there is a corresponding increase of approximately 10 ng/ml in the plasma and presents preliminary data that, for each added 1 mg/day dose of clonazepam, there is approximately an increase of 12 ng/ml in the plasma. For both drugs, however, there may be considerable variation in level in plasma for a given dose. Weight-adjusted clonazepam concentration may be more predictable than weight-adjusted alprazolam concentration.", 
    "112": "Two hundred six outpatients with panic disorder and agoraphobia were randomly assigned to receive 4 weeks of treatment with placebo or sustained-release adinazolam under double-blind conditions. Eighty-eight percent of patients receiving drug and 85% of patients receiving placebo remained in the study at week 4. This report describes the \"intent-to-treat\" analysis of 202 patients who made at least one follow-up visit after randomization at baseline. On the basis of the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale, 69.7% of the adinazolam-treated patients were much or very much improved compared with 39.6% of the placebo-treated patients at week 4 or end-point (p = 0.0001). At week 4, panic attacks were completely blocked in 57.1% of adinazolam-treated patients and in 39.2% of the placebo-treated patients (p = 0.009). Adinazolam sustained-release treatment was statistically more effective than placebo treatment on measures of global improvement, number of panic attacks, SCL-90 phobia severity, main phobia severity, and anticipatory and general anxiety. No drug-placebo differences were found for overall self-rated phobia severity, unexpected or situational panic attacks, or for work, family, or social disability."
