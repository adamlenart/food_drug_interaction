Hydrolysis of cyanoderivatives furnished the corresponding amides or acids depending on the reaction conditions. Decarboxylation and reduction of some derivatives to afford 11-aryl-5H-pyrrolo[2,1-c] [1,4] benzodiazepines and 11-aryl-3-cyano-10,11-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,1-c] [1,4] benzodiazepines are described.", 
    "1": "The effect of Triton X-100 on 3H-GABA and 3H-diazepam binding was measured in a frozen-thawed synaptosomal fraction of rat brain. Specific binding activity (amount bound per mg protein) of both ligands was increased by the treatment. Diazepam binding capacity in the pellet was progressively decreased, while GABA binding was increased, then decreased by increasing Triton X-100. Diazepam binding affinity was unchanged, while GABA binding affinity increased. Triton X-100 appears to preferentially solubilize benzodiazepine binding sites, indicating GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites are on separate macromolecules.", 
    "2": "Over the ranges 2.8 X 10(-5) to 8.78 X 10(-5) M diazepam and 4.85 X 10(-2) to 1.22 X 10(-1) M ethanol, addition of the effects of these agents on the overturn end point in goldfish was observed. The addition of bovine serum albumin (1.56 X 10(-5) M) to aqueous solutions of diazepam modifies the diazepam effect by reducing the \"free\" drug concentrations.", 
    "3": "During the past 20 years the senior author has, in selected cases, used alcohol injection of the anogenital area for the treatment of intractable pruritus. The initial experience of this treatment in 30 cases that had failed to respond to other appropriate local therapy was reported 6 years ago. During the past 5 years an additional 35 procedures have been performed. The results are similar to those reported previously and indicate that if the cases are carefully selected and have had appropriate but unsuccessful conservative treatment, the results of alcohol injection may prove to be satisfactory.", 
    "4": "Five cerebral-palsied children and adolescents with severe startle epilepsy became seizure-free after clonazepan was introduced into their existing anticonvulsant drug regimens. The drug was withdrawn in one case because of side effects. Two hemiparetic patients who had startle epilepsy as the only epileptic manifestation remained permanently controlled after a mean of 34 months of continuous therapy. Reappearance of startle-induced seizures occurred after 1 and 4 years in two other patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. A possible explanation for the effectiveness of clonazepan in this form of reflex epilepsy may involve inhibition of brainstem mechanisms mediating pathologically enhanced reactions in these patients, thus avoiding secondary activation of a discharging focus in the vicinity of the motor supplementary area.", 
    "5": "The properties of Althesin (anticonvulsant activity, depression of oxygen consumption, lowering of ICP, rapid excretion) led us to use this steroid combination to treat 11 patients in status epilepticus resistant to the standard drugs (benzodiazepines and barbiturates). The administration of Althesin by slow intravenous injection was ineffective in 2 of the 3 patients thus treated. The doses used (2--10 ml) were probably too small. One only administration of a 10% solution of Althesin in 10% fructose by intravenous drip (the rate was calculated so as to obtain the burst suppression stage at the EEG) stopped status epilepticus in 7 of the 9 patients thus treated. In this group the doses used varied from 25 to 50 ml. The 2 patients in whom it was necessary to repeat Althesin administration and combine it with other drugs had both been operated on for severe brain injuries involving marked cerebral edema. In spite of the very small number of cases, the definitive arrest of status epilepticus obtained in 8 out of 11 patients first treated with other drugs is encouraging: Althesin probably may be regarded as an adjunct in the treatment of status epilepticus.", 
    "6": "Pentazocine 30 mg. or 15 mg or a placebo, was administered randomly to forty-nine patients undergoing conservative dental treatment in combination with a local analgesic block and intravenous diazepam. Simple cardiorespiratory measurements were made throughout the treatment period. Patients in the 30 mg pentazocine group required some 6 mg diazepam less than the placebo (control) group (P less than 0.05). Patients receiving 15 mg pentazocine also required less diazepam compared to the control group, but this difference was not statistically significant. There were no significant differences between the three groups either in recovery times or the cardiorespiratory measurements.", 
    "7": "Effects of diazepam and alcohol on psychomotor skills were measured in two trials. In the first one, 200 healthy students volunteered for a double-blind single-dose study. Three doses of diazepam (5, 10 and 20 mg) and alcohol (0.5, 0.8 and 1.2 g/kg) were used alone and combined to construct dose-response graphs. All doses of alcohol impaired divided attention while co-ordinative skills were impaired by the 1.2 g/kg dose. Diazepam alone did not impair reactive or co-ordinative skills whereas the combinations of diazepam and alcohol did so. To further elucidate the subactue effects, a double-blind randomized study was conducted administering 2 and 10 mg of diazepam t.i.d. for two weeks to 18 healthy volunteers. The psychomotor tests were performed on the 7th and 14th days of drug administration, and 0.5 g/kg of alcohol was given on either day. Diazepam 2 mg, alone or with alcohol, did not differ from placebo. 10 mg of diazepam slightly increased reaction times but not reaction mistakes, and impaired both co-ordination and attention. Alcohol did not enhance diazepam effects. We suggest that a development of tolerance to diazepam may compensate the deleterious interaction of the agents found in acute studies.", 
    "8": "In the chronic abuser, diazepam (Valium) withdrawal can be a protracted event. In this report a case is presented of a 37-year-old Caucasian female who had been ingesting 60 to 80 mg of diazepam daily for 8 years. Twelve days following discontinuation of the drug, the patient continued to experience diarrhea, restlessness, emotional lability, and anxiety. Serial blood levels of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam were acquired and found to yield significant levels of desmethyldiazepam for 21 days and greater than trace amounts for 30 days. The results were interpreted as consistent with the slow release of the drug from peripheral storage sites. The prolonged period needed for detoxification in this patient raises important question regarding the appropriate length of hospitalization or close supervision required to withdraw the diazepam addict.", 
    "9": "Characteristics of 3H-GABA binding to rat brain synaptic membranes in vitro have been investigated. The specific binding of 3H-GABA displays saturation kinetics. Only one single population of receptor sites was found (Km = 31.3 nM) with a concentration of 2.09 pmol/mg protein. Only GABA agonists show inhibitory effect on the binding, whereas GABA antagonists, GABA-uptake inhibitors, and inhibitors of GAD and GABA-T are without effect. The order of potencies for GABA agonists are: Muscimol greater than GABA greater than or equal to 4,5-dihydromuscimol greater than 3-aminoproprane sulphonic acid greater than isoguvacine greater than THIP greater than 3-hydroxy-GABA greater than imidazol-4-acetic acid. Agonists and antagonists from other neurone systems as well as neuroleptics and benzodiazepines had no or only a very slight potency in the binding test.", 
    "10": "In patients undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia diazepam 0.16 mg kg-1 had no effect on mechanical twitch height of the adductor pollicis muscle of the thumb when the ulnar nerve was stimulated at the wrist. The muscle responses were evoked by single, repeated supramaximal stimuli at 0.2 Hz and \"train-of-four\" stimulation at 2 Hz for 2 s. Diazepam 0.16 mg kg-1 had no effect on the depth or recovery of neuromuscular blockade produced by suxamethonium, tubocurarine, pancuronium, fazadinium or alcuronium.", 
    "11": "Chlordiazepoxide (5.0, 10.0 or 15.0 mg/kg) was given to rats either acutely or for 9 consecutive days. Its effects were examined in a 15-min drinking test in which latency to drink, volume of water consumption and the time-course of drinking were measured. Chlordiazepoxide (10.0 mg/kg) produced the strongest stimulant effect on drinking and enhanced the frequency of occurrence of drinking both at the beginning and at the end of the test period. Chlordiazepoxide (15.0 mg/kg) delayed the onset of drinking and its peak effect was observed later than for other injection conditions. Single and repeated administration of chlordiazepoxide had the same effects on the measures taken in the test. Initial sedation to the drug treatment and subsequent tolerance to this effect were not, therefore, factors influencing the drug effects observed in this experiment. Possible mechanisms underlying the stimulation of drinking by chlordiazepoxide are considered.", 
    "12": "The recent report that purines are competitive inhibitors of specific [3H] diazepam binding to brain membranes has prompted further work concerning the characterization of possible endogenous ligands for the benzodiazepine receptor. In this report, two previously undescribed fractions capable of apparent competitive inhibition of [3H] diazepam binding are reported. Both factors are heat stable and resistant to proteolytic degradation. The larger factor (approximately 700 to 30,000 daltons) is present only in brain and pituitary. The smaller factor (500 to 600 daltons) is found in pituitary, liver, and muscle, but the highest levels are found in brain.", 
    "13": "Four coded, but otherwise unidentified, premedicants were prescribed in randomised order for 219 patients who were to undergo elective Caesarean section. Seventy-six (35%) of these patients affirmed at the pre-operative visit that they were not anxious. Diazepam 5 mg and lorazepam 1 mg appeared to be superior to the placebo and to 10-6 ml of 90% alcohol in inducing calmness and/or drowsiness, although the differences were not statistically significant. The incidence of awareness or unpleasant dreams was considerably higher in the placebo and alcohol series (6.2% and 7.5%) than in the diazepam and lorazepam series (nil and 2.1%). There was no remarkable difference in the condition of the immediate newly-born related to the premedicant received by the mother, any small differences being much less impressive than that related to the duration of the U-D interval. No notable differences were observed in the long term conditions between the infants in the placebo, alcohol and diazepam series but the incidence of \"reluctance to feed\". If relief from preoperative anxiety-and possibly a reduction in the likelihood of awareness-without undue effect upon the infant is considered desirable, diazepam 5 mg is the preferred choice from the four drugs investigated.", 
    "14": "An anaesthetic technique comprising a combination of phenoperidine (0.1 mg . kg-1), diazepam (0.06 mg . kg-1) and pancuronium bromide (0.1 mg . kg-1) with controlled ventilation was evaluated in 12 patients with severe coronary artery disease. The heart rate, cardiac output and mean arterial blood pressure did not change significantly between the preinduction and postinduction measurements. The right atrial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased significantly by 33% and 36%, respectively, probably due to the influence of positive-pressure ventilation. There was no depression of the left ventricular performance.", 
    "15": "In 18 patients with documented ischaemic heart disease the cardiovascular effects of ketamine (1.5 mg/kg iv) were studied under three different conditions: 1. in awake premedicated patients (n = 6); 2. after the previous administration of flunitrazepam (0.015 mg/kg iv, n = 6) and 3. under conditions of neuroleptanalgesia and muscle relaxation (n = 6). Flunitrazepam prevented or at least attenuated the increases in heart rate (30%), mean arterial pressure (37%), mean pulmonary artery pressure (165%), left ventricular filling pressure (230%), total peripheral resistance (50%), pulmonary vascular resistance (100%) and in the rate-pressure product (66%) which were associated with the use of ketamine as the sole anaesthetic agent. In addition, the flunitrazepam-pretreatment abolished the fall in cardiac index and stroke index which occured in patients given ketamine alone. Flunitrazepam therefore appears to be a promising drug to prevent adverse cardiovascular reactions, when ketamine should be chosen for induction of anaesthesia. Neuroleptanalgesia and muscle relaxation also proved effective in controlling the sympathomimetic actions of ketamine. The response of the mean pulmonary artery pressure and of the ventricular filling pressures to ketamine in this group was even more damped than in the patients pretreated with flunitrazepam alone.", 
    "16": "A standard dose of lorazepam 2.5 mg was given i.v. to two groups of mothers: (a) before surgical induction of labour and (b) at the beginning of the second stage of labour. A group of non-pregnant women was studied as control. Plasma concentrations of lorazepam were measured by gas-liquid chromatography, in the mothers before delivery, and in the mother and neonate at delivery and 24 and 48 h thereafter. Concentrations at delivery in the neonates were similar to those in the mothers in group (a), but significantly less in group (b). Fetal concentration rarely exceeded that in the mother. Measurements after delivery indicated that the neonates were able to metabolize lorazepam at the same rate as the mothers. Of the 22 neonates studied only one had an Apgar score of less than 8 at 5 min and this score was 10 at 10 min.", 
    "17": "Two principal oblique factors are identified in the Bass Social Acquiescence Scale, a measure previously shown to correlate positively with placebo response and negatively with anxiolytic drug response. The two factors appeared very similar in separate analyses of data from samples of 941 psychiatric outpatients and 1,837 college students. Also, results are presented which indicate that one factor, tentatively labeled \"traditionalism\", accounted for the empirically observed relationships to placebo and drug response in two clinical trials.", 
    "18": "Plasma binding of chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, loraxepam, and oxazepam was determined by equilibrium dialysis in 20 male, healthy volunteers, 25-86 years old. A wide range of binding was observed, with the free fraction varying twofold for lorazepam, fourfold for chlordiazepoxide and diazepam, and over 20-fold for oxazepam. Statistically significant linear relationships were not observed between the degree of binding and age, serum albumin, or total protein for any of the drugs. There was, however, a correlation between the extent of binding for the four drugs. Because of the importance of unbound benzodiazepine levels in eliciting any pharmacological response and also in disposition, consideration of the wide interindividual variability in plasma binding must be made in interpreting pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data.", 
    "19": "1. Repeated nocturnal doses of 30 mg clobazam and dipotassium chlorazepate 15 mg showed no significant effects compared to matching placebo on tests of psychomotor performance and serial subtraction of numbers given in the morning and afternoon of the day following treatment. 2. Both active preparations improved the perceived quality of sleep compared to placebo. 3. A reduction in rated anxiety scores was found with clobazam on the afternoon of the day following treatment together with an elevation of critical flicker fusion thresholds. 4. Dipotassium chlorazepate was found to impair performance of a low level conceptual task but not to influence performance at a more difficult level.", 
    "20": "Total serum benzodiazepine concentrations were correlated with clinical manifestations in 93 cases of diazepam overdose. Diazepam and nordiazepam were also each separately determined in 101 serum specimens from cases of diazepam overdose, including 27 cases from the aforementioned clinical correlation study. In addition, serum nordiazepam concentrations were measured in five cases of chlorazepate overdose. Concentrations of total benzodiazepine ranged from 1 to 22 microgram/ml. All patients survived with supportive therapy only. Each of the 25 patients who had ingested only diazepam was awake or in grade 0 coma, even when drug concentrations were ten-fold greater than the accepted upper limit of the therapeutic range. None of the patients who had ingested only diazepam needed hospitalization; all were discharged from acute medical care after a period of emergency room observation. The ratios of parent drug to N-desmethyl metabolite (nordiazepam) in those overdose specimens analyzed by gas chromatography averaged 3:1. This high ratio may be useful in differentiating acute overdose from high concentrations resulting from chronic therapy. Although determination of diazepam concentrations aid in establishing that an overdose has occurred, when more than grade I or II coma is present, other drugs or an alternative explanation should be sought, regardless of the drug concentration.", 
    "21": "During the first 10 days after peripheral deafferentation of the mouse olfactory bulb stereoselective binding of L-[3H]carnosine declines markedly. The initial phase of this decline is due to a decrease in binding site stereoselectivity, which is then followed by a loss of assayable binding sites. The specificity of inhibition of L-[3H]carnosine binding by various peptides is also altered after denervation. Competitive inhibitors of carnosine binding become less potent after denervation, while analogues which are not competitive inhibitors remain equipotent before and after denervation. Several carnosine analogues that are normally poor inhibitors become more potent after denervation. Treatment of bulb membranes with trypsin, RNase and hyaluronidase, but not DNase or collagenase, resulted in significant alterations in carnosine binding. L-, but not D-carnosine, protected the binding site from trypsin digestion, and induced additional binding in bulb membranes in a dose-and temperature-dependent fashion. Preincubation of membranes with L-carnosine also led to the induction of additional carnosine binding in membranes from cerebral cortex, cerebellum and deafferentated bulbs but not from muscle. Bulbs from newborn mice contain about one-half of the adult levels of binding and no significant sex differences in carnosine binding were detected in bulbs from adult rats. L-[3H]carnosine binding was two-fold higher in the anterior compared to the posterior portion of the bulb, but there were no significant differences in binding of opiate, GABA, alpha-adrenergic, muscarinic cholinergic, benzodiazepine of glutamic acid receptor ligands.", 
    "22": "The term addictive as used by the popular press frequently confuses the more precise concepts of acute and chronic tolerance, physical dependence and withdrawal, and psychologic dependence. Serious physical dependence on psychoactive drugs is rare and is easily managed. In contrast, psychologic dependence, the most important reason for persistent drug use, is much more common and is difficult to treat. Some tactics are available - for example, confrontation and discussion with the patient about how a drug is not going to be effective over long periods. Treating the symptom of a complex problem should, of course, not be expected to solve the problem. The most important tactic is to prescribe dependence-associated drugs only when clearly indicated, when the problem is responsive to drug therapy and for the shortest period necessary, without the option for renewing the prescription. Many problems related to drug use long after the period of expected benefit is past can be avoided by far more restrictive drug prescribing. Barbiturates and nonbarbiturate sedative hypnotics (e.g., ethchlorvynol, glutethimide, meprobamate, methaqualone and methyprylon) should not be prescribed for insomnia, acute reactive anxiety, chronic anxiety neurosis or depressive illnesses, since the safer and equally effective benzodiazepines, which are less associated with dependence, are available.", 
    "23": "Thirteen patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) were treated with cimetidine. This population could be divided into chronic forms, mostly presenting as a common duodenal ulcer, and acute forms resulting in critical problems requiring intensive medical care. Among the 7 patients with chronic ZES, cimetidine treatment was unsuccessful in 2; satisfactory clinical control was obtained in 3 others, but gastrinoma excision was the final treatment; cimetidine treatment has been prolonged for more than 15 months in the last 2 patients. If, in this condition, acute pharmacologic secretory inhibition were constantly obtained, therapeutic efficiency criteria are not sensitive enough to establish certainty in the patient's long-term follow-up. Total gastrectomy is still a valuable alternative if excision of the gastrinoma is not possible. Of the 6 patients with acute ZES, 4 were treated by pirenzepin (0.5 mg/kg intramuscularly 3 times a day) adjunctive to cimetidine infusion (2.4 mg/day), which resulted in increased antisecretory activity. However, total gastrectomy was the final outcome in every patient, with 1 immediate postoperative death. In conclusion, cimetidine in ZES treatment, although capable of inducing ulcer healing, diarrhea disappearance, and dramatic secretory inhibition, is still challenged by surgery, which allows either complete cure of the gastrinoma or definitive suppression of the secretory virulence.", 
    "24": "This paper descirbes biosynthetic labeling experiments on the conversion of tyrosine to the C2- and C3-proline units of anthramycin, tomaymycin, and sibiromycin. The biosynthetic fate of all of the aromatic and side-chain hydrogens has been determined in each antibiotic by using dual tagged (3H/14C) and 2H-labeled tyrosine molecules. In addition, experiments uing [15N]tyrosine and the tritiated D and L isomers of tyrosine have shed some light on the biochemical reactions which take place at tha alpha position of tyrosine. On the basis of results of all these experiments, a biosynthetic scheme had been proposed to rationalize the apparent inconsistencies which occur between the results for the three antibiotics. This scheme proposes that a common main pathway involving proximal extradiol cleavage of Dopa and condensation to form the pyrrolo ring leads ultimately to a C-7 branch point compound. Parallel pathways from this central branch point compound lead by well-known biochemical transformations to the C2-and C3-proline units of anthramycin, tomaymycin, and sibiromycin. The reactions in these parallel pathways are suggested to be \"cosmetic or after events\".", 
    "25": "The biosynthesis of the antitumor antibiotic sibiromycin by Streptosporangium sibiricum requires the construction of four units: the amino sugar from glucose; the anthranilate ring from DL-tryptophan probably via kynurenine; the aromatic methyl group from methionine; the propylidene proline from L-tyrosine with the loss of two aromatic carbons and addition of a C-1 from methionine. Retention of tritium from DL-[5-3H]tryptophan in sibiromycin suggest an NIH shift during hydroxylation of an intermediate.", 
    "26": "Routine determination of the blood serum concentration of most of the usual anticonvulsants is possible by means of an immunoenzymatic method (EMIT). Determination of the total concentration permits conclusions as to the amount of available, unbound and, thus, effective amount of the substance. Regular determination of serum values provides insight into the relevant pharmacokinetics. Metabolism of anticonvulsants differs greatly among individuals and therefore considerable individual variation exists in the relation between the applied dose and the attained serum level. The metabolic rate of the various substances is unequal and, accordingly, the time necessary to reach a steady state and the half life is very variable. Metabolism may be altered by various biological adaptations, diseases or other drugs, causing alterations in the serum level of the anticonvulsant. Results obtained to date indicate a therapeutic threshold concentration range. In a certain percentage of patients seizures are abolished or diminish in frequency only on attaining such a serum level. In more benign cases an adequate therapeutic effect may be obtained with lower (\"subtherapeutic\") concentrations, while on the other hand, in malignant cases, no efficient control of seizure activity can be attained even at a high serum concentration. The method should be used in all problematic patients. Up to 50% of patients with insufficient control of seizures show improvement or, even, absence of seizures if this method is included in the therapeutic concept.", 
    "27": "The discovery of high-affinity binding sites for psychoactive drugs such as benzodiazepines, opiates and neuroleptics has opened up new approaches to the study of these drugs and their mechanisms of action. Although most tricyclic antidepressants inhibit neuronal uptake of noradrenaline and serotonin, their mechanism of action remains unclear. Changes in the sensitivity of the beta-receptor after chronic tricyclic antidepressant treatment suggest that they modulate noradrenergic neurotransmission. Tricyclic antidepressants also act directly on cholinergic, histaminergic, alpha-adrenergic and serotonergic receptors. It is not clear, however, which, if any, of these effects are related to the primary antidepressant effect or whether they are simply responsible for some of the side effects. We have thus investigated the possibility that specific binding sites for tricyclic antidepressants exist in the central nervous system. So far, binding studies using 3H-labelled tricyclic antidepressant drugs have only detected binding to histaminergic H2 and cholinergic muscarinic receptors and low-affinity binding. We demonstrate here a population of specific high-affinity binding sites for 3H-imipramine on brain membranes which may be responsible for the antidepressant effects of these drugs.", 
    "28": "Lorazepam and oxazepam in plasma and urine were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Oxazepam was used as an internal standard in the assay of lorazepam and vice versa. After removal of interfering substances with n-hexane, the drugs were extracted with benzene and converted to N1,O3-bistrimethylsilyl derivatives. Glucuronide forms of the drugs were extracted after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase. A common fragment ion at m/e 429 was used to monitor the two drugs. The sensitivity was 2 ng/ml for both drugs, which was sufficient to determine plasma and urine concentrations after therapeutic doses to humans.", 
    "29": "A prospective study of 79 fit young adults who underwent oral dental surgery was undertaken with five different anaesthetic techniques. Anaesthesia was commenced with methohexitone or flunitrazepam, muscle relaxants, and cuffed nasal intubation, and anaesthesia was maintained with 50% nitrous oxide, 50% oxygen, halothane or fentanyl with or without intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). Six of the 33 patients who received methohexitone and halothane developed dangerous dysrhythmias. Flunitrazepam, IPPV, adequate analgesia and anaesthesia provide maximum cardiovascular stability.", 
    "30": "The growth of the R3230AC mammary carcinoma was studied in female Fisher 344 rats that were treated with diazepam. Diazepam at 250 micrograms/animal/day (2.5 mg/kg body weight) and 500 micrograms/day was administered for 4 weeks, starting 2 days before subcutaneous transplantation of uniform pieces of the tumour. Tumour size was significantly increased in the group receiving 250 micrograms but was below the levels observed in the saline treated controls in those given 500 micrograms diazepam. Plasma PGE2 and PGF2 alpha concentrations were comparable in control and diazepam treated animals.", 
    "31": "Effects of diazepam and baclofen on the anemic decerebrate rigidity in rats were studied by using the drugs that modify GABAergic mechanisms of deplete catecholamine. Rigid forelimb tension in anemic decerebrate rats took the form of tonically sustained tension (tonic component), while the phasic tension (phasic component) was induced by mechanical stimulation of hindlimbs. Diazepam exerted a marked dose-dependent inhibition of the phasic component, whereas baclofen produced a similar effect on both tonic and phasic components. In rats pretreated with semicarbazide, the inhibitory effect of diazepam on phasic component was reduced, and the effect of semicarbazide was antagonized by pyridoxine. The effect of diazepam was slightly enhanced by pretreatment with aminooxyacetic acid, and antagonized by picrotoxin. In contrast to diazepam, the depressant actions of baclofen on both components were not affected by semicarbazide, aminooxyacetic acid or picrotoxin. Catecholamine depletion produced by alpha-methyltyrosine or disulfiram significantly reduced the effect of baclofen on the phasic component. It thus appears that GABA is involved in the effect of diazepam on the phasic component, and noradrenaline is involved in the same effect of baclofen in anemic decerebrate rats.", 
    "32": "Two consecutive anesthetics were given to a young severely debilitated patient, who had recently had bone marrow transplantation. On both occasions a combination of a new benzodiazepine, Ro21-3981, and ketamine was used, the first with the patient breathing oxygen spontaneously, and the second under relaxation and artificial ventilation with pure oxygen. The findings suggest that this technique provides cardiovascular stability during anesthesia and rapid return to consciousness, free from emergence phenomena. The technique facilitated the early transport of the patient away from the recovery facilities.", 
    "33": "The anti-ulcer activity of three different doses (1/10, 1/30 and 1/90 of LD50) of imipramine, amitryptyline, chlorpromazine, amphetamine, ephedrine, chlordiazepoxide and meprobamate was studied in two types of stress-produced gastric ulcers in rats. It was found that these drugs given in doses of 1/10 or 1/30 LD50 inhibited in the same degree the development of gastric ulcer-produced by the method of Senay, in spite of differences in their psychotropic activity. On the other hand, when the method of Rossi was used for ulcer production the ulcer-preventing activity of these drugs has been varied. Thymoleptics were most effective and ataractics least effective against ulcers produced by the method of Rossi.", 
    "34": "Effect of diazepam on the AV nodal conductivity was studied using a direct perfusion technique of the canine AV node artery in situ. As compared to acetylcholine which induced a rapid onset of third degree AV block with prompt recovery, diazepam injected into the AV node artery in doses from 300 micrograms to 3 mg elicited first to third degree AV blocks of longer duration following gradual prolongation of PR interval. The response was not affected by bilateral vagotomy and sympathectomy. Pretreatment of the AV node with hexamethonium or atropine also failed to modify the diazepam-induced AV blocks. Thus, diazepam seemed to suppress conductivity of the AV node by a direct action. The AV nodal tachycardia induced by infusion of norepinephrine was readily antagonized by a single injection of diazepam, but norepinephrine failed to reverse the AV block induced by diazepam infusion.", 
    "35": "Levels of [3H]benzodiazepine were measured in rat cerebral cortex following intravenous injection of [3H]diazepam using a dose and time schedule reported to elicit a marked potentiation of the depressant effects of iontophoretically applied 5'-AMP to rat cerebral cortical neurons. The levels of [3H]benzodiazepine obtained strongly suggest (i) that blockade of adenosine uptake as a mechanism for this potentiation is not consistent with the potency of diazepam as an inhibitor of adenosine uptake in vitro, and (ii) that a potentiative interaction of adenosine and diazepam may reflect the binding of these compounds to benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "36": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic procedure was developed for diazepam tablet analysis. This procedure separates the manufacturing intermediate, 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one, and the decomposition products, 3-amino-6-chloro-1-methyl-4-phenylcarbostyril and 2-methylamino-5-chlorobenzophenone, from diazepam. The liquid chromatographic procedure is superior to the USP UV assay because it is stability indicating. The method is simple, accurate, and fast, involving only one extraction step. A reversed-phase column and a methanol-water mobile phase were used. Under these conditions, 0.1% of the decomposition products was detectable. Typical samples of diazepam tablets showed no degradation.", 
    "37": "Starting from 3-hydroxy-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones 1--3, via 3-chloro derivatives 4--6, 13 new C(3)-substituted 1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones were synthesized. Reaction of 4--6 with ethylene glycol yielded 3-(beta-hydroxyethyl) derivatives 7--9. Similar reaction with the isopropylidene derivative of glycerol afforded 10--12, which on hydrolysis of the isopropylidene group hielded glycerol derivatives 13--15. Reaction of trichloroacetyl chloride with oxazepam and temazepam yielded the corresponding trichloroacetyl esters 16 and 17. The beta-hydroxyethyl derivative 7 was conjugated with an acetylated glucopyranose derivative to give isomeric 18 and 19. Partition coefficients (log Poct) and central nervous system activities (in six stranded tests) were determined for 7--15 as well as several standard compounds. Most of the compounds exhibiting beneficial central nervous system activity had Poct values between 1.71 and 2.48. No correlation between lipophilicity and central nervous system activity could be discerned for these compounds.", 
    "38": "Neuromuscular, circulatory, and adverse effects of intravenous succinylcholine (SCh), mg/kg, were compared in 3 groups of 40 patients each. Group I served as control; group II received diazepam, 0.05 mg/kg, 5 min before SCh; and group III was given d-tubocurarine (d-Tc), 0.05 mg/kg, for pretreatment. Diazepam pretreatment prevented muscle fasciculations, increases in serum potassium (K+) and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels, increased heart rate and arterial pressure, and postoperative myalgia associated with SCh administration. The neuromuscular blocking action of SCh was not affected. Pretreatment with d-Tc did not abolish increases in serum K+ and CPK levels, was associated with a higher incidence of postoperative myalgia, and decreased the onset and magnitude of SCh-induced muscle paralysis. Our data demonstrate that diazepam, a predominant centrally acting muscle relaxant, is more effective than d-Tc in preventing the adverse effects of SCh, a peripherally acting muscle relaxant.", 
    "39": "In 104 patients undergoing anaesthesia of short duration, two different solvents, propylene glycol and cremophor, were compared in a double-blind trial. Diazepam 10 mg in a coded solution was injected into a superficial vein of the hand using a small-gauge needle. The vein was examined after 14 days. The frequency of thrombophlebitis with propylene glycol was 62.2% and with cremophor 3.4% (P less than 0.001). The frequency of pain on injection was also in favour of the new solvent (P less than 0.001). The possibility of anaphylactic reactions accredited to cremophor, however, restricts the use of the new injection.", 
    "40": "Because of its analgesic and amnesic effects, ketamine has potential advantages as a primary agent for patients undergoing open-heart surgery. However, the undesirable positive inotropic and chronotropic effects associated with ketamine have deterred its use. Diazepam pretreatment appears to block these unwanted effects. Sixteen randomly selected patients were given a combination of diazepam, 0.4 mg/kg, followed by ketamine, 2 mg/kg, and nitrous oxide, 50%. The authors compared the circulatory responses to induction, intubation, and operation with those obtained in a matched group of patients who received morphine, 3 mg/kg, and nitrous oxide, 50%. All patients underwent mitral- or aortic-valve replacement. Circulatory responses were not significantly different between the two groups. In both groups, heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, and rate-pressure product increased significantly with intubation of the trachea, incision of the skin, and sternotomy. The incidences of hypertension, hypotension, and arrhythmias, and the need for inotropic drugs were not significantly different between the two groups. No intraoperative awareness occurred in either group. It is concluded that diazepam-ketamine anesthesia is a satisfactory alternative to morphine anesthesia for patient undergoing heart-valve replacement.", 
    "41": "In this double-blind study, 56 adult psychoneurotic outpatients with a primary diagnosis of anxiety neurosis were randomly assigned to receive buspirone (N = 18), diazepam (N = 20), or placebo (N = 18) over a four-week period. A battery of tests administered weekly indicated that buspirone, a new agent not chemically related to any currently marketed drugs, was as effective an antianxiety agent as diazepam and produced no more and perhaps fewer side effects. Buspirone showed excellent antidepressant effects as well. If further studies confirm the authors' findings and determine that buspirone does not result in tolerance and addiction, it would be more advantageous than the benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety.", 
    "42": "It would be wrong to draw firm conclusions in this paper, because the methodology was highly subjective. However, the authors are of the opinion that certain conclusions can be drawn: Autistic individuals, even those with wildly aberrant behavior, can frequently receive dental treatment in a routine manner, if adequately sedated. Various sedative drugs may be effective. Combinations of drugs may be successful, where individual drugs have failed. The authors found the combination of Nisentil and Phenergan, supplemented with Vistaril when needed, to be especially effective. N2O-O2 analgesia appears to be beneficial, either alone or as an adjunct to other medications."
