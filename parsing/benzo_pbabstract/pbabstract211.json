Previous research on their effect on human auditory efferent pathways--through evoked otoacoustic emissions suppression by contralateral acoustic stimulation (CAS)--indicated a decrease in medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent system inhibitory activity, after oral intake of oxazepam--representative of the Bzd drug class. To date, this pharmacological effect was only assessed in the right ear. Since a leftward asymmetry of Bzd receptors localization in human auditory cortex has been described recently, we explored in this study the hypothesis of an asymmetrical action of Bzd on MOC efferent functioning. The results revealed a significant difference of Bzd effect probing the right ear versus the left ear, with CAS-induced suppression being less effective in the right than left ear after oxazepam intake. This finding raises the question of possible neurochemical left-right asymmetry in the descending auditory pathways. The potential localization of this asymmetry is discussed.", 
    "1": "Studies investigating the impact of comorbid substance use disorders (SUD) in psychosis have tended to focus on cross-sectional data, with few studies examining the effects of substance use course on clinical outcome. The main aim of the present study was to assess the impact of baseline SUD and course of SUD on remission of positive symptoms.", 
    "2": "The Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre admitted 786 first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients between 1998 and 2000. Data on SUD and clinical outcome were collected from patients' medical records (MR) of 643 patients who met inclusion criteria.", 
    "3": "Lifetime prevalence of SUD was 74%, with 62% having a SUD at baseline. This reduced to 36% in those patients who completed 18 months of treatment at the EPPIC program. A Cox regression analysis indicated that a decrease or cessation of substance use significantly increased the probability of remission, whilst persistent SUD substantially reduced the likelihood. In addition, patients who reduced use appeared to have better outcomes at 18 months than those patients who had never used substances. Baseline SUD was not found to have any significant influence on symptom remission.", 
    "4": "Patients presenting with FEP have high rates of SUD. Effective management of psychosis within a specialized service is associated with reductions in SUD over the course of treatment, although persistent substance use is associated with non-compliance, treatment drop-out and poor remission rates. As such, young people with FEP and comorbid substance use should be offered integrated treatment that addresses both disorders.", 
    "5": "Enhancing the release of acetylcholine (ACh) in the brain is one approach to increasing neuronal activity, restoring central cholinergic tone and improving attention and cognition. ACh release is modulated by both ligand-gated (gamma-amino butyric acid A receptors/benzodiazepine [GABA(A)/BDZ], nicotinic-acetylcholine and serotonin, 5-HT3) and voltage-gated (calcium and potassium) ion channels. Of the ligand-gated channel modulators, the BDZ receptor (BDZR) inverse agonists (beta-CCM, ZK 93426) enhance activity-dependent release in animals, whereas S-8510, a partial inverse agonist, and the BDZR antagonist, flumazenil, show enhancement regardless of the behavioural state of the animal. Some of these agents have undergone limited clinical evaluation for Alzheimer's disease (AD) (ZK 93426, flumazenil, S-8510), but their potential anxiogenic liability makes their therapeutic use uncertain until more clinical data are available. Within the group of nicotinic agonists, ABT-418, though less potent than nicotine and epibatidine in promoting ACh release in vitro, was clinically evaluated based on its in vivo profile. Its lack of oral bioavailability has limited its acceptability, though transdermal administration has been used to circumvent this deficiency. Serotonin 5-HT3 receptor modulators have not been advanced for clinical evaluation for the treatment of AD. Among the voltage-gated ion channel modulators affecting L- or N-type calcium channels, nefiracetam, a nootropic agent, also increased ACh release in animal studies. It is currently undergoing clinical evaluation for AD, though a need for more potent and brain selective calcium channel blockers exists. Potassium channel modulators have been the most studied ACh release enhancing agents and several of these compounds (4-AP, 3,4-DAP, linopirdine) have been clinically evaluated. In AD patients, 4-AP, an A-type K+ channel blocker, elicited inconsistent and unremarkable effects. Linopirdine, whose enhancement of ACh release correlates with its ability to block M-type K+ channels, also produced disappointing clinical results, which may have been related to its suboptimal pharmacokinetic profile. Further work in this series has provided a compound (DMP 543) that should be a more reliable indicator of whether a blocker of this ion channel can activate the cholinergic system in man. This agent is currently undergoing clinical evaluation for AD.", 
    "6": "Cognitive deficits are a fundamental feature of the schizophrenic disorder, but the effect of antipsychotic treatment is still debated. The study assesses the effect of olanzapine on neurocognitive functioning and symptomatology of patients with schizophrenic disorder residual type. Executive function evaluation by the Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST) was performed on 39 patients treated with olanzapine (5-20 mg/day); the efficacy of drug in improving symptomatology, safety and quality of life was also evaluated. After 7 months of treatment, the mean number of WCST categories tended to increase. Correct responses increased with a statistically significant change from the baseline. The total and unique errors decreased significantly. At all post-baseline visits a decrease from baseline in the PANSS total, positive and negative scores was seen. The proportion of patients with less severe illness (CGI), increased over the course of the study with a corresponding decrease of patients with more severe illness. The quality of life scores also tended to improve during treatment. The Simpson Angus scale, Barnes-akathisia and abnormal involuntary movement scale scores decreased consistently. The most common treatment emergent drug related adverse events were weight gain, insomnia, agitation and anxiety. Neurocognitive functioning in terms of executive performance and symptomatology improved in people with schizophrenia residual type.", 
    "7": "Antipsychotics are commonly used in bipolar disorder, both for acute mania and in maintenance treatment. The authors review available clinical research concerning the use of both conventional and atypical antipsychotics in bipolar disorder and present recommendations for a number of key clinical situations based on this review. They also consider a number of important related questions, including whether there is evidence for an increased risk of tardive dyskinesia (TD) in patients with bipolar disorder, the potential role for antipsychotics in the treatment of bipolar depression, the role of antipsychotics in maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder, the potential for antipsychotics to induce depression in bipolar illness, and whether antipsychotics can be considered mood stabilizers with a place as monotherapy for bipolar mania. They conclude that standard treatment for acute mania should begin with a mood stabilizer, with benzodiazepines used as an adjunct for mild agitation or insomnia and antipsychotics used as an adjunct for highly agitated, psychotic, or severely manic patients. They also conclude that atypical antipsychotics are preferable to conventional antispychotics because of their more favorable side effect profile and reduced risk of tardive dyskinesia. They review the evidence for using atypical antipsychotics as first-line monotherapy for mania and conclude that more evidence concerning the risk of TD and their efficacy as maintenance treatment in bipolar disorder is needed before a conclusion can be made. Should the eventual risk of TD associated with atypical antipsychotics be found to be minimal and their efficacy in maintenance treatment found to be high, they could eventually be considered first line monotherapy for bipolar disorder. They conclude that treatment with an antipsychotic during bipolar depression should be limited to those patients who have psychosis and that atypical antipsychotics are preferred over conventional antipsychotics in this situation, not only because of their reduced risk of side effects but also because theoretically they may have antidepressant efficacy due to their effects on the serotonin system. The clinical research findings summarized in the article are, for the most part, supported by a recently published guideline based on a consensus of clinical experts.", 
    "8": "The author followed 67 patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA) for a minimum of 5 years in a private practice setting. They were treated with a combination of pharmacotherapy (antidepressants or benzodiazepines) and cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy. The author examines outcomes for three groups: A) 11 male patients, 10 of whom had comorbid conditions; B) 21 female patients with comorbid conditions; and C) 35 female patients without comorbid conditions. Symptom severity was assessed using the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS). Patients in all groups showed marked improvement in all the domains measured by the PDSS, with the greatest improvement in PDSS scores occurring during the first year in all three groups. Patients in groups A and B tended to plateau after 5 years of treatment and show no additional improvement thereafter, whereas patients in group C (women with \"pure PDA\") continued to improve, although at a gradually slower rate. However, after an average of 11 years of treatment, the majority of patients remained symptomatic. The presence of comorbid alcohol abuse or depression was associated with poorer outcomes. The results in this effectiveness study are generally not as good as the outcomes of published PDA follow-up efficacy studies, but appear to be superior to outcomes in cohorts of chronically anxious patients treated decades ago.",

    "12": "In total, 103 patients completed the study, representing a retention rate of 94%. Patients reported significant improvements in somatic complaints, as well as significant reductions in heroin and cocaine cravings (p < 0.0001) and in additional consumption of cocaine in supervised urinalysis (p = 0.0083). Additional illicit consumption of benzodiazepines remained unchanged.",

    "14": "Inhaled mineral dusts and fibres can cause chronic pulmonary inflammation, often leading to permanent scarring with loss of function, but the mechanisms involved remain obscure. There are currently no good methods for monitoring inflammatory processes in situ. Positron emission tomography (PET) of suitable intravenously injected radiolabelled markers provides non-invasive and repeatable methods of quantifying biochemical and cellular responses. We have developed animal models of fibrotic and non-fibrotic pulmonary response to particulate instillation and characterised these by histology. Different components of the inflammatory response have been investigated by PET: (1) [(18)F]-labelled fluoro-deoxyglucose, a positron emitting glucose analogue, accumulates in cells in proportion to their glucose uptake; ex vivo microautoradiography indicates that neutrophils are the cells responsible for an increased signal during pulmonary inflammation; a persistently high uptake is associated with lung scarring. (2) The radioligand [(11)C]-R-PK11195 binds to benzodiazepine-like receptors abundant in macrophages; following particulate instillation, the [(11)C]-R-PK11195 PET signal tracks with lung macrophage accumulation and also localises to regions consistent with macrophage clearance; poor macrophage clearance is associated with fibrosis. (3) [(18)F]-fluoroproline is likely a substrate for extracellular matrix production, especially proline-rich collagen; during active scarring, the rate of lung uptake of fluoroproline is elevated. Localisation of radioactivity in the lung has been validated ex vivo by microautoradiography of tritium analogues of each of the positron emitting tracers. The use of PET to monitor different inflammatory processes by repeated scanning of the same animal or individual is helping to identify key events in the fibrotic process.", 
    "15": "There is increasing interest in the use of oral fluid as the matrix for the detection of drugs of abuse which requires the use of sensitive immunoassays to achieve the low detection limits required. The use of liquid chromatography linked to tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) is explored as a possible replacement for immunoassay in screening for drugs of abuse in oral fluid samples.", 
    "16": "Oral fluid samples collected from 72 subjects attending an addiction clinic were screened for opiates, cocaine, methadone and benzodiazepines using both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and LC/MS/MS. The latter analysis used a short gradient elution with individual drugs detected by multiple reaction monitoring using tandem mass spectrometry. Results between the two methods were compared qualitatively using the cut-off concentrations defined by the ELISA assays.", 
    "17": "With regard to the ELISA assays which show group specificity, LC/MS/ MS detected the presence of 6-monoacetylmorphine, morphine or dihydrocodeine in all but two of 49 samples positive for opiates. Of 55 samples positive for benzodiazepines by ELISA, all but two were confirmed by LC/MS/MS. Overall, LC/MS/MS compared favourably with ELISA for detection of specific drugs or their metabolites in the case of morphine, methadone and the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine. Many of the discrepant results between the two assays were a result of samples with drug concentrations near to the cut-off concentrations and the imprecision of these assays at very low concentrations.", 
    "18": "LC/MS/MS offers a more flexible, specific and sensitive alternative to the screening of oral fluid samples for drugs of abuse than ELISA. A wide range of drugs and metabolites can be detected from a single sample injection.",

    "21": "One hundred and eighteen [(18)F]FDG PET body imaging studies were performed in 69 pediatric patients with a variety of solid tumors. The mean age at the time of imaging was 12.9 years (range 1.2-22.6 years), and 33 studies were performed in patients younger than 10 years old. Seventy-six were performed in boys and 42 in girls. Patients were imaged using a dedicated PET camera. Pre-medication was given in 88 studies: 45 received intravenous fentanyl (0.75-1.0 mug/kg), 34 received low-dose oral diazepam (0.06 mg/kg) and 9 received moderate-dose oral diazepam (0.10 mg/kg). Thirty patients received no pre-medication, 7 of whom were known to have received opiates for pain during the 12 h before the study. Six body regions in the neck and chest were reviewed for [(18)F]FDG uptake in brown adipose tissue. Uptake of FDG in brown fat was visually graded: 0 for no FDG uptake, 1 for low-grade uptake, 2 for moderate uptake, and 3 for intense uptake. Visual grades 2 and 3 were considered to interfere potentially with image interpretation in the neck and chest. Data were analyzed by multivariate regression using a Poisson distribution.", 
    "22": "[(18)F]FDG uptake in brown adipose tissue was most often seen in the lateral neck region and superior and lateral to the lungs (in 36 and 39 studies, respectively). Uptake was also seen near the costovertebral junctions (15 studies), in the superior and central neck in 7 studies and in the anterior mediastinum in 2. Brown adipose tissue uptake was thought to interfere potentially with image interpretation (visual grades 2 and 3) in 19 studies-in 6 of 23 (26.1%) studies after no pre-medication and no opiates for pain, in 10 of 34 (29.4%) after low-dose oral diazepam, in 0 of 9 (0%) after moderate-dose oral diazepam, in 3 of 45 (6.7%) after intravenous fentanyl, and in 0 of 7 (0%) after opiates prescribed for pain. Intravenous fentanyl reduced the grade of brown adipose tissue compared to no drug (P=0.0039) and low-dose diazepam (P=0.0024). Low-dose diazepam had no effect when compared to no drug (P=0.984). There were inadequate data for statistical testing of moderate-dose valium and opiates prescribed for pain. Children younger than 10 years had lower uptake grades (P=0.019) than those older than 10 years.",

    "24": "When psychological and behavioral disorders of Alzheimer's disease appear suddenly, somatic, iatrogenic and reactive or relational psychological causes must be ruled out or treated before concluding that the cause is lesional. Non-pharmacological interventions should be privileged for the prevention and management of behavioral manifestations of mild to moderate intensity: psychological support of the patient (short therapies), training the caregiver, work on daily habits, reorganization of the home, behavioral measures against apathy and especially agitation, rehabilitation strategies, and therapy involving music, light, aromas, etc. Pharmacological therapies are only moderately effective in these disorders. They must be targeted and follow a sequence of prescription that maximizes tolerance and distinguishes treatment of acute and chronic states. Anticholinesterase agents may be useful in this domain to prevent or ease some symptoms (especially apathy). The efficacy of memantine must be confirmed by additional data. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors agents may be useful not only in depression but also anxiety, emotional disturbances, irritability and compulsiveness. Atypical neuroleptics are better tolerated than the classic ones. They are most effective in this context but must be reserved for specific indications and limited in time because of the increased risk of stroke. Other psychotropics (benzodiazepines, carbamates, antiepileptics) should be used cautiously in this context.", 
    "25": "We aimed to analyze the risks of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) induced by typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs using a common pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model based on the receptor occupancy. We collected the data for EPS induced by atypical antipsychotics, risperidone, olanzapine and quetiapine, and a typical antipsychotic, haloperidol from literature and analyzed the following five indices of EPS, the ratio of patients obliged to take anticholinergic medication, the occurrence rates of plural extrapyramidal symptoms (more than one of tremor, dystonia, hypokinesia, akathisia, extrapyramidal syndrome, etc.), parkinsonism, akathisia, and extrapyramidal syndrome. We tested two models, i.e., a model incorporating endogenous dopamine release owing to 5-HT2A receptor inhibition and a model not considering the endogenous dopamine release, and used them to examine the relationship between the D2 receptor occupancy of endogenous dopamine and the extent of drug-induced EPS. The model incorporating endogenous dopamine release better described the relationship between the mean D2 receptor occupancy of endogenous dopamine and the extent of EPS than the other model, as assessed by the final sum of squares of residuals (final SS) and Akaike's Information Criteria (AIC). Furthermore, the former model could appropriately predict the risks of EPS induced by two other atypical antipsychotics, clozapine and ziprasidone, which were not incorporated into the model development. The developed model incorporating endogenous dopamine release owing to 5-HT2A receptor inhibition may be useful for the prediction of antipsychotics-induced EPS.", 
    "26": "We previously established a method to predict the drug metabolism capacity of injured liver based on pharmacokinetic estimation of the amount of cytochrome P450 (CYP) in vivo (PKCYP test), by introducing the apparent liver-to-blood free concentration gradient in vivo (qg) as a parameter. Here we show that the amount of CYP3A2 in CCl(4)-treated rats can be estimated appropriately by applying the PKCYP test using midazolam (MDZ) as a probe, assuming that the qg value in control rats does not change. We applied the results to predict the clearance of theophylline as a model drug with a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with CCl4, and the amount of CYP (A-CYP(vivo)) was quantified by Western blotting. The qg value of MDZ was determined in control rats and used to estimate the amounts of CYP3A2 in CCl4-treated rats; the result agreed well with the observed values. The qg value of CYP3A2 estimated with MDZ as a probe was used together with our previously reported value for CYP1A2 (theophylline metabolism in the liver is known to be almost entirely mediated by CYP3A2 and CYP1A2) to predict the total body clearance (CL(tot)) of theophylline in CCl4-treated rats. The predicted CL(tot) was about one-third of the observed value, which was considered acceptable. The time-course of theophylline concentration in serum simulated with a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model agreed well with the observed values. Thus, the PKCYP test using MDZ as a probe can be used to predict the amount of CYP3A2 and the CL(tot) of theophylline in CCl4-treated rats.", 
    "27": "Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle reflex is a commonly used measure of preattentive sensorimotor gating. Disrupted PPI in rodents represents an animal model of the sensorimotor gating deficits characteristic of schizophrenia. The neurotensin (NT) system is implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and NT has been hypothesized to act as an endogenous antipsychotic. In rats, NT receptor agonists restore PPI disrupted by dopamine receptor agonists and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, and pretreatment with an NT receptor antagonist blocks restoration of isolation rearing induced deficits in PPI by some antipsychotic drugs. The current studies further scrutinized the role of the NT system in the regulation of PPI and in antipsychotic drug-induced restoration of PPI using NT-null mutant mice (NT-/-). NT-/- mice exhibited significantly higher pulse alone startle amplitudes and disrupted PPI compared with NT+/+ mice. Haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg) and quetiapine (0.5 mg/kg) administered 30 min before PPI testing significantly increased PPI in NT+/+ mice but had no effect on PPI in NT-/- mice. In contrast, clozapine (1.0 mg/kg) significantly increased PPI in both NT-/- and NT+/+ mice, whereas olanzapine (0.5 mg/kg) had no effect on PPI in either NT-/- or NT+/+ mice. In a separate experiment, amphetamine (2.0 mg/kg i.p.) significantly disrupted PPI in NT+/+ mice but not NT-/- mice. These results provide evidence that the effects of antipsychotic drugs (APDs) may be differentially affected by the state of NT neurotransmission and, moreover, that APDs differ in their dependence on an intact NT system.",

Patients were sedated to an optimal Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS) score of 3 or 4 and a pain intensity (PI) score of 1 or 2.", 
    "30": "The remifentanil-based sedation regime significantly reduced the duration of mechanical ventilation by more than 2 days (53.5 hours, P = 0.033), and significantly reduced the time from the start of the weaning process to extubation by more than 1 day (26.6 hours, P < 0.001). There was a trend towards shortening the stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) by 1 day. The median time of optimal SAS and PI was the same in both groups. There was a significant difference in the median time to offset of pharmacodynamic effects when discontinuing study medication in patients not extubated at 10 days (remifentanil 0.250 hour, comparator 1.167 hours; P < 0.001). Of the patients treated with remifentanil, 26% did not receive any midazolam during the study. In those patients that did receive midazolam, the use of remifentanil considerably reduced the total dose of midazolam required. Between days 3 and 10 the weighted mean infusion rate of remifentanil remained constant with no evidence of accumulation or of a development of tolerance to remifentanil. There was no difference between the groups in SAS or PI score in the 24 hours after stopping the study medication. Remifentanil was well tolerated.",

    "34": "In MTLE patients, the epileptogenic hippocampus often showed decreases in both 123I-IMZ and 123I-IMP SPECT. Consistent with those, marked reduction of 125I-IMZ binding was observed in hippocampal CA1-3 regions of the kainate model, which clearly paralleled pyramidal neuronal loss. In contrast, 125I-IMZ binding was increased in the dentate gyrus at 1 month but returned to the normal level at 3-6 months, when frequent spontaneous seizures appeared. The amygdala-kindling model demonstrated similar increases in 125I-IMZ binding in the dentate gyrus without any changes in other brain regions. In NE-CD patients, the epileptogenic foci showed decreased 123I-IMZ binding with relatively normal 123I-IMP SPECT. 125I-IMZ binding also was decreased in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus (areas CA1, 2, and 4), and caudate/putamen of the in-utero irradiation model.",

As regards to TMD, notice that pharmacological therapy must not be over protracted for too much time, especially for use of benzodiazepine and tricyclic antidepressants, dosage demanded are decisively less if we compare, usually main therapeutical indications. The pharmacological therapy can be an agent for competent method for symptomatology treatment of temporal-jaw disorder but, patient must be acquainted about a fact, trouble often could not disappear only with a drug.

    "42": "Behavioral emergencies are a common and serious problem for consumers, their families and communities, and the healthcare providers on whom they rely for help. In recent years, serious concerns about the management of behavioral and psychiatric emergencies-in particular, the misapplication and overuse of physical and chemical restraints and seclusion-have become a focus of attention for mental health professionals and policy makers as well as for the lay public, the media, and patient advocacy organizations. Policy leaders and clinicians are searching for ways to balance the rights of consumers with considerations of safety and good care in an area in which it is difficult to conduct research. A survey of mental health professionals who are experts on the treatment of psychiatric and behavioral emergencies identified consumer input and collaboration between patient and clinician whenever possible as being extremely important in achieving the best short-term and particularly the best long-term outcomes for patients. The survey of consumer perspectives described in this article was undertaken in response to the need to better understand consumer experiences and preferences. The authors describe four emergency services forums conducted in 2002, which involved a total of 59 consumers. Each forum involved a written consumer survey as well as a workshop to develop and prioritize recommendations for improving psychiatric emergency care. The authors present the results of the consumer survey and summarize the top recommendations from the workshops. In both the survey and the workshops, the consumers repeatedly stressed the importance of having staff treat them with respect, talk to them, listen to them, and involve them in treatment decisions. There were a number of important areas of agreement between the recommendations of the consumer panel and those of the experts in emergency psychiatry surveyed for the Expert Consensus Guidelines on the Treatment of Behavioral Emergencies. These include the desirability of verbal interventions, the use of a collaborative approach, and the use of oral medications guided by the individual consumer's problems, medication experiences, and preferences. The majority of the consumer panel reported adverse experiences with general hospital emergency rooms and, in fact, called for the development of specialized psychiatric emergency services such as those recommended in the Expert Consensus Guidelines. One-fifth of the consumer panel attributed their emergency contact to lack of access to more routine mental health care. The consumers clearly do not reject medications categorically. Almost half indicated that they wanted medications and a similar number indicated benefit from medications, although many complained of forced administration and unwanted side effects. The consumer panel preferred benzodiazepines and ranked haloperidol as a least preferred option. Among their key recommendations for improving psychiatric emergency care, the consumer panel stressed the development of alternatives to traditional emergency room services, the increased use of advance directives, more comfortable physical environments for waiting and treatment, increased use of peer support services, improved training of emergency staff to foster a more humanistic and person-centered approach, increased collaboration between practitioners and patients, and improved discharge planning and post-discharge follow-up. The implications of these findings for improving psychiatric emergency care are considered.", 
    "43": "Behavioral emergencies are a common and serious problem for consumers, their communities, and the healthcare settings on which they rely, but there is little research to guide provider responses to this challenge. Key constructs such as agitation have not been adequately operationalized so that the criteria defining a behavioral emergency are vague. A significant number of deaths of patients in restraint has focused government and regulators on these issues, but a consensus about key elements in the management of behavioral emergencies has not yet been articulated by the provider community. The authors assembled a panel of 50 experts to define the following elements: the threshold for emergency interventions, the scope of assessment for varying levels of urgency and cooperation, guiding principles in selecting interventions, and appropriate physical and medication strategies at different levels of diagnostic confidence and for a variety of etiologies and complicating conditions.", 
    "44": "A written survey with 808 decision points was completed by 50 experts. A modified version of the RAND Corporation 9-point scale for rating appropriateness of medical decisions was used to score options. Consensus on each option was defined as a non-random distribution of scores by chi-square \"goodness-of-fit\" test. We assigned a categorical rank (first line/preferred choice, second line/ alternate choice, third line/usually inappropriate) to each option based on the 95% confidence interval around the mean rating. Guideline tables were constructed describing the preferred strategies in key clinical situations.", 
    "45": "The expert panel reached consensus on 83% of the options. The relative appropriateness of emergency interventions was ascertained for a continuum of behaviors. When asked about the frequency with which emergency interventions (parenteral medication, restraint, seclusion) were required in their services, 47% of the experts reported that such interventions were necessary for 1%-5% of patients seen in their services and 32% for 6%-20%. In general, the consensus of this panel lends support to many elements of recent regulations from the Health Care Financing Administration (now the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services), including the timing of clinician assessment and reassessment and the intensity of nursing care. However, the panel did not endorse the concept of \"chemical restraint,\" instead favoring the idea that medications are treatments for target behaviors in behavioral emergencies even when the causes of these behaviors are not well understood. Control of aggressive behavior emerged as the highest priority during the emergency; however, preserving the physician-patient relationship was rated a close second and became the top priority in the long term. Oral medications, particularly concentrates, were clearly preferred if it is possible to use them. Benzodiazepines alone were top rated in 6 of 12 situations. High-potency conventional antipsychotics used alone never received higher ratings than benzodiazepines used alone. A combination of a benzodiazepine and an antipsychotic was preferred for patients with suspected schizophrenia, mania, or psychotic depression. There was equal support for high-potency conventional or atypical antipsychotics (particularly liquids) in oral combinations with benzodiazepines. Droperidol emerged in fourth place in some situations requiring an injection.", 
    "46": "To evaluate many of the treatment options in this survey, the experts had to extrapolate beyond controlled data. Within the limits of expert opinion and with the expectation that future research data will take precedence, these guidelines provide some direction for addressing common clinical dilemmas in the management of psychiatric emergencies and can be used to inform clinicians in acute care settings regarding the relative merits of various strategies.", 
    "47": "Ca2+ indicators of varying affinity and mobility were pressure injected into the presynaptic axon of the inhibitor of the crayfish neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Fluorescence transients recorded at a 2-kHz resolution were used to probe physiological parameters governing the decay of fluorescence transients within 100 ms after an action potential (early decay). Blocking Ca2+ extrusion or Ca2+ sequestration processes did not significantly alter early decay, arguing against a role for either mechanism. Fluorescence transients recorded with low mobility or fixed indicators exhibited early decay similar to that recorded with indicators of comparable affinity but high mobility, suggesting that early decay was not due to the rate of Ca2+-indicator diffusion. The extent of early decay correlated closely with the affinity, but not mobility, of the Ca2+ sensitive dyes tested. These results implicate intrinsic buffers with slow Ca2+ binding kinetics as the most likely determinants of early decay. However, computer simulations showed that intrinsic buffers with a slow binding rate are unlikely to be the only ones present in the system because the slow kinetics would be unable to buffer incoming Ca2+ during an action potential and would result in momentary indicator saturation. In fact, experimental data show that the peak amplitude of an action potential activated Ca+ transient is about 20% of the maximal fluorescence intensity activated by prolonged Ca2+ influx. We conclude that endogenous buffering at the crayfish NMJ includes both fast and slow components, the former being fast enough to compete with fast Ca2+ indicators, and the latter dictating the early decay.",

    "49": "A 76-year-old man presented with persistent hiccups after beginning azithromycin for the treatment of pharyngitis. Hiccups were persistent and exhausting. Discontinuation of azithromycin and therapy with baclofen finally resolved hiccups. No organic cause of hiccups was identified despite extensive investigation.", 
    "50": "Pharmacotherapeutic agents have been uncommonly associated with hiccups. Corticosteroids (dexamethasone and methylprednisolone), benzodiazepines (midazolam) and general anaesthesia have been the specific agents mentioned most frequently in the literature as being associated with the development of hiccups. Few cases of drug-induced hiccups have been reported related to macrolide antimicrobials. Using the Naranjo adverse effect reaction probability scale this event could be classified as possible (score 5 points), mostly because of the close temporal sequence, previous reports on this reaction with other macrolides and the absence of any alternative explanation for hiccups. Our hypothesis is that a vagal mechanism mediated by azithromycin could be the pathogenesis of hiccups in our patient.", 
    "51": "Diagnosis of drug-induced hiccups is difficult and often achieved only by a process of elimination. However, macrolide antimicrobials have been reported to be associated with hiccups and vagal mechanism could explain the development of this side-effect.", 
    "52": "The causes of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) can be categorized as iatrogenic, infectious or idiopathic. Drug-induced SJS is associated with various antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other drugs. However, no previous reports have mentioned an association between chlordiazepoxide, a benzodiazepine sedative, and SJS. Here, we present a case of SJS induced by chlordiazepoxide overdose. This case reminds us that SJS may be an adverse effect of chlordiazepoxide. Further, overdosage with benzodiazepine sedatives should be added to the list of potential causes of SJS.",

(2) About 20 plants are approved in France in the production of medications 'traditionally used' for minor sleep disturbances. Virtually nothing is known of their efficacy or potential dangers. (3) Most of these plants are suspected of toxicity and should therefore be avoided, especially in view of their unproven efficacy. (4) Littleleaf linden, vervain, melissa and orange flower have no demonstrated efficacy but are safe and can therefore be used. Similarly, there are no scientific grounds for rejecting preparations based on hawthorn or passiflora. (5) Available data suggest that valerian extracts have a modest impact on subjective sleep quality; they are nevertheless more effective than a placebo. Valerian products that do not contain valepotriates have no apparent adverse effects. It is best to avoid high-titre alcoholic extracts and powdered valerian root, and to select aqueous extracts and low-titre hydro-alcoholic preparations.", 
    "54": "Stiff-person syndrome is a rare, likely immune-mediated neurological disorder characterized by painful spasms and progressive symmetric rigidity of the axial and proximal limb muscles. Rigidity of truncal muscles and continuous contraction of the agonist and antagonist muscles caused by involuntary motor-unit firing at rest are the hallmarks of stiff-person syndrome. Immunosuppressive therapy has induced remission in patients with stiff-person syndrome. We report a patient with stiff-person syndrome with minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS). The pathophysiologic states of stiff-person syndrome and MCNS are unclear. T-Cell-dependent mechanisms are highly suspected for the pathogenesis of both. The diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome was made on the basis of clinical and laboratory findings, and both MCNS and stiff-person syndrome resolved completely with immunosuppressive therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first case of stiff-person syndrome in association with MCNS in the literature.",

    "56": "We performed standardized chart reviews of randomly selected groups of patients, who had been treated in the PUK (n = 104) and the LKH (n = 100) in the years 1998 and 1999.", 
    "57": "Again, organic brain diseases/dementia was the most frequent diagnosis in the LKH and depression that of the PUK. Less diagnostics were applied compared to the previous investigation, especially neuroimaging. Non-drug treatments are (documented) more frequently now in the LKH. Both institutions - data with respect to frequent syndromes are given - treated the wide majority of patients with psychoactive drugs, especially neuroleptics, typical antidepressants, benzodiazepines. Antidementia drugs were given significantly less. Hospital stays decrease in length. Compared to the respective investigation in Magdeburg there is some evidence supporting specialized care for the elderly.",

With regard to age, the PUK provides integrated and the LKH separated care.", 
    "61": "Mean patients' age decreased. Compulsory admissions according to state laws decreased significantly. Specialist treatment before admission decreased. Premedication showed a dramatic decrease of antidementia drug treatment and a nearly unchanged high rate of prescriptions of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines.",

    "63": "Negative GABA(A) modulators (i.e., inverse agonists) might be useful for identifying mechanisms at the GABA(A) receptor complex that mediate the effects of positive GABA(A) modulators, especially those for which there are no available competitive antagonists.", 
    "64": "Drug discrimination was used to examine antagonism of a 5-beta neuroactive steroid (pregnanolone) and a benzodiazepine (midazolam) by several negative GABA(A) modulators in rhesus monkeys.", 
    "65": "One group of monkeys (n=5) received 5.6 mg kg(-1) day(-1) of diazepam (p.o.) and discriminated the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (0.1 or 0.32 mg/kg s.c.); another group of monkeys (n=5) discriminated the benzodiazepine midazolam (0.32 mg/kg s.c.).", 
    "66": "In diazepam-treated monkeys, negative GABA(A) modulators with increasing efficacy, including Ro 15-4513, ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE), methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) and methyl-6,7-dimethoxyl-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), substituted for flumazenil. In monkeys discriminating midazolam, pregnanolone occasioned high levels of midazolam-lever responding, and these effects were attenuated by beta-CCE and beta-CCM, but not by flumazenil, Ro 15-4513, or DMCM. The midazolam discriminative stimulus also was attenuated by beta-CCM and DMCM; Schild analysis was consistent with a simple competitive interaction between midazolam and beta-CCM but not between midazolam and DMCM.", 
    "67": "Negative modulators are qualitatively similar to neutral modulators in diazepam-treated animals; however, interactions between negative modulators and midazolam suggest that different receptors mediate the effects of some (DMCM) and not other (beta-CCM) negative modulators. Negative modulators at benzodiazepine sites exert efficacy-dependent antagonism of positive modulators at neuroactive steroid sites. Without competitive antagonists at neuroactive steroid or barbiturate sites, negative modulators could prove useful for examining the mechanism of action of different classes of positive GABA(A) modulator.", 
    "68": "Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) is a rare, potentially fatal and idiosyncratic drug reaction. It is characterized by a sudden loss of body temperature control, renal and respiratory failure, muscle rigidity, loss of consciousness and impairment of autonomic nervous system. Although NMS was previously associated with the use of classical high-potency neuroleptics, cases have started to emerge with atypical neuroleptics. This article discusses the first case of NMS in a child, induced by the use of risperidone, olanzapine and quetiapine.", 
    "69": "The present study reports the results of an open-label trial on the use of the combination of olanzapine (an atypical antipsychotic) serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) in 26 resistant outpatients affected by resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). All patients had been suffering from OCD, according to DSM IV criteria, for at least 2 years and had different comorbid disorders; they had been treated with an SRI at adequate dosages for at least 6 months, or had tried different augmentation strategies with no or poor response. As a result, olanzapine was added and continued for 1 year. After 12 weeks of this regimen, most of the patients (17) had shown a reduction in OC symptoms, as assessed by a decrease in the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale total score, which continued throughout subsequent months. Only mild side-effects were recorded and no patient halted the treatment. The addition of olanzapine would appear to be a useful short- and long-term strategy for augmenting SRI effectiveness in resistant OCD patients, especially in those presenting comorbidity with bipolar disorders.", 
    "70": "Sudden auditory stimuli elicit a short-latency muscular response (acoustic startle response) which is enhanced during presentation of a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS) that has previously been paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) ('fear-potentiation'). In rodents, acute treatment with benzodiazepines blocks both the acquisition of fear-potentiation and the expression of fear-potentiation induced by prior exposure to CS/US pairing. We examined the effect of diazepam on the acquisition and expression of fear-potentiation of the acoustic startle response in man. Forty-six male volunteers (18-30 years) participated in two sessions separated by 7 days. In session 1, they were exposed to 20 2-s presentations of a light (CS), 50% of which terminated with an electric shock to the wrist (1.8 mA, 50 ms: US). Somatosensory potentials evoked by the US were recorded from the scalp at Cz, and skin conductance responses from electrodes taped to the second and fourth fingers. In session 2, the CS was presented 20 times without the US; a random 50% of CS presentations terminated with a sound pulse (40-ms 115-dB 1-kHz); an equal number of sound pulses was presented without the CS. Electromyographic responses of the orbicularis oculi muscle to the acoustic stimuli were recorded from electrodes placed on the lower eyelid, late-latency auditory evoked potentials were recorded at Cz, and skin conductance responses from electrodes taped to the second and fourth fingers. In each session, alertness was measured using visual analogue self-rating scales and critical flicker fusion frequency. Subjects received placebo or diazepam 10mg in the two sessions in a double-blind protocol: group 1 (n 12) placebo/placebo; group 2 (n 11) placebo/diazepam; group 3 (n 12) diazepam/placebo; group 4 (n 11) diazepam/diazepam. Diazepam reduced alertness as measured by visual-analogue self-rating scales and critical flicker fusion frequency. In session 1, diazepam reduced the amplitude of the somatosensory potentials and skin conductance responses evoked by the CS. In session 2, the acoustic startle response, the N1/P2 auditory evoked response and the skin conductance response evoked by the sound stimuli were enhanced in the presence of the CS. This fear-potentiation was attenuated in subjects who received diazepam in session 1, but was not affected by the treatment given in session 2. The results indicate that diazepam blocks the acquisition of fear-potentiation of startle responses in man, as in animals, but does not prevent the expression of a previously learned response.", 
    "71": "Anxiolytic effects induced by benzalphthalides on mice have been evaluated. The evaluation was based on the spent time and the number of entries of animals into the open arms in the elevated plus maze test. Single administration of benzalphthalides 1 and 11 induced significant increments in both parameters, thus revealing their potentiality as new leads for the development of non-benzodiazepinic and non-nitrogenated antianxiety agents.", 
    "72": "Exposure to the organophosphate nerve agent soman produces seizures that in turn lead to neuropathology. This study describes the temporal and spatial evolution of brain pathology following soman-induced convulsions and the attenuation of these alterations after neuroprotective intervention with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Neuroimaging 12 h after soman exposure, the hippocampus and thalamus exhibited significant decreases (23%) in apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC). These acute effects were resolved by 7 days. In addition, T2 measurements declined significantly at 12 h (37%) returning to near normal values by 24 h. Histopathological analyses confirmed moderate cell loss within the hippocampus and piriform cortex. Together these findings suggest that initial cell death was resolved through regional cellular remodeling. Pharmacological countermeasures were administered in the form of diazepam, a benzodiazepine anticonvulsant, or gacyclidine (GK-11), an anti-glutamatergic compound. Diazepam therapy applied immediately after soman exposure prevented acute ADC changes. However the presence of edema, using T2 measurements, was detected at 3 h within the retrosplenial, amygdala and piriform cortices and at 12 h in the thalamus (34% below normal). GK-11 therapy appeared to prevent most of these changes. However at 7 days after soman, a decrease (17%) in ADC was observed in the piriform cortex. Pathology was confined to the piriform cortex suggesting that this region is more difficult to protect. This is the first report that provides temporal and spatial resolution using MRI with histological correlation of pharmacological interventions against soman-mediated seizure-induced neuropathology.",

    "80": "For over two decades clinical studies have been conducted which suggest the existence of a relationship between depression and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Recently, Ohayon underscored the evidence for a link between these two disorders in the general population, showing that 800 out of 100,000 individuals had both, a breathing-related sleep disorder and a major depressive disorder, with up to 20% of the subjects presenting with one of these disorders also having the other. In some populations, depending on age, gender and other demographic and health characteristics, the prevalence of both disorders may be even higher: OSA may affect more than 50% of individuals over the age of 65, and significant depressive symptoms may be present in as many as 26% of a community-dwelling population of older adults. In clinical practice, the presence of depressive symptomatology is often considered in patients with OSA, and may be accounted for and followed-up when considering treatment approaches and response to treatment. On the other hand, sleep problems and specifically OSA are rarely assessed on a regular basis in patients with a depressive disorder. However, OSA might not only be associated with a depressive syndrome, but its presence may also be responsible for failure to respond to appropriate pharmacological treatment. Furthermore, an undiagnosed OSA might be exacerbated by adjunct treatments to antidepressant medications, such as benzodiazepines. Increased awareness of the relationship between depression and OSA might significantly improve diagnostic accuracy as well as treatment outcome for both disorders. In this review, we will summarize important findings in the current literature regarding the association between depression and OSA, and the possible mechanisms by which both disorders interact. Implications for clinical practice will be discussed.", 
    "81": "Insomnia is a common but underrecognized problem in elderly patients. Five basic steps can help clinicians identify and treat insomnia. The first step is to ask a single question about sleep at every new patient visit, which goes a long way toward detection of patients with insomnia. The second step is to perform an initial evaluation of the problem, including symptoms, contributing factors, and effects on daytime function. Step three is to determine whether the patient is in crisis. True sleep emergencies are rare, and in most cases, treatment can be delayed until another appointment can be made for a full evaluation of the problem. A sleep evaluation constitutes the fourth step and focuses mainly on a thorough sleep history; blood tests and polysomnography rarely have a role. The final step is intervention. Nonpharmacological strategies are a mainstay of treatment for chronic insomnia, but hypnotics have a role in treating transient insomnia and chronic insomnia that does not improve with nonpharmacological treatment or treatment of associated primary conditions. Pharmacological therapy usually consists of benzodiazepines with short half-lives or nonbenzodiazepines such as zolpidem and zaleplon, although lack of demonstrated efficacy against sleep maintenance difficulties, one of the primary symptoms of insomnia among older people, limits use of these agents. Emerging nonbenzodiazepine agents such as indiplon and eszopiclone may specifically address sleep maintenance problems in elderly patients and are pending Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. (Editor's note: Since preparation of this manuscript, the FDA has approved eszopiclone for treatment of insomnia.).", 
    "82": "The effect of cholecystokinin (CCK) on cultured human meningioma derived cells was investigated. Exposure of meningioma cells for 6-12 days to CCK-8s (2-200 nM) resulted in a dose dependent stimulation of cell growth to a maximum of 1.1-fold over basal controls. A time course study showed stimulation of cell growth at day 3 followed by increase throughout day 6. The stimulatory effect of CCK on meningioma cell growth was completely abolished by a CCK-B specific receptor antagonist, L-365,260. Reverse-transcription of meningioma-derived RNA into cDNA followed by amplification by the polymerase chain reaction using specific primers for CCK peptide and its CCK-A and/B receptor revealed 100% presence of CCK peptide and CCK-B receptors mRNA whereas CCK-A receptor was expressed in 66% of the meningiomas. These results provide evidence that human meningioma cells possess CCK peptide and its receptors the activation of which leads to increase of cell growth possibly via an autocrine/paracrine mechanism.",

We evaluated whether NTX combined with the benzodiazepine prazepam was more effective than NTX in keeping patients opioid-free. We determined the relapse rate over 6 months in 56 opioid-dependent subjects, divided into 4 equal groups. All groups received psychological support and underwent urine tests for drug metabolites twice weekly. Group 1 did not receive pharmacological treatment (controls). Group 2 received NTX alone (one 50-mg tablet daily); group 3 received NTX (one 50-mg tablet daily) plus placebo (one tablet twice daily); and group 4 received NTX (one 50-mg tablet daily) plus prazepam (one 10-mg tablet twice daily). Ten patients of group 1 relapsed within 3 months, one after 6 months and three remained opioid-free. Six patients of group 2 relapsed within three months, two after 6 months, and six remained opioid-free. Seven patients of group 3 relapsed three months, one after 6 months and six patients remained opioid-free. In group 4, one patient relapsed within 3 months and one patient after 6 months; 12 patients of this group remained opioid-free. At urine tests, a significantly higher percent patients of group 4 remained free of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol versus patients of groups 2 and 3.

The photolabeling specificity of [3H]FNZP was confirmed by findings in which other hAGP-binding ligands inhibited the formation of covalent bonds between [3H]FNZP and hAGP. The photolabeling of asialo-hAGP suggested that sialic acid does not involve in the binding of [3H]FNZP. No difference in the labeling could be found between the F1*S variants and A variant. Similarly, FNZP did not show a difference in binding affinity to the two genetic variants of hAGP.

    "89": "Zolpidem is a hypnotic benzodiazepine site agonist with some gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptor subtype selectivity. Here, we have tested the effects of zolpidem on the hippocampus of gamma2 subunit (gamma2F77I) point mutant mice. Analysis of forebrain GABA(A) receptor expression with immunocytochemistry, quantitative [(3)H]muscimol and [(35)S] t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) autoradiography, membrane binding with [(3)H]flunitrazepam and [(3)H]muscimol, and comparison of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current (mIPSC) parameters did not reveal any differences between homozygous gamma2I77/I77 and gamma2F77/F77 mice. However, quantitative immunoblot analysis of gamma2I77/I77 hippocampi showed some increased levels of gamma2, alpha1, alpha4 and delta subunits, suggesting that differences between strains may exist in unassembled subunit levels, but not in assembled receptors. Zolpidem (1 microm) enhanced the decay of mIPSCs in CA1 pyramidal cells of control (C57BL/6J, gamma2F77/F77) mice by approximately 60%, and peak amplitude by approximately 20% at 33-34 degrees C in vitro. The actions of zolpidem (100 nm or 1 microm) were substantially reduced in gamma2I77/I77 mice, although residual effects included a 9% increase in decay and 5% decrease in peak amplitude. Similar results were observed in CA1 stratum oriens/alveus interneurons. At network level, the effect of zolpidem (10 microm) on carbachol-induced oscillations in the CA3 area of gamma2I77/I77 mice was significantly different compared with controls. Thus, the gamma2F77I point mutation virtually abolished the actions of zolpidem on GABA(A) receptors in the hippocampus. However, some residual effects of zolpidem may involve receptors that do not contain the gamma2 subunit.", 
    "90": "Ethanol is a potent neurotoxin particularly for the developing nervous system. Intrauterine exposure to ethanol during the last trimester of human gestation can produce a broad spectrum of neuropathologic consequences. This period of human brain development is roughly equivalent to the first week of rodent postnatal life and acute exposure of neonatal mice to ethanol produces massive neuronal apoptosis throughout the brain. We have previously demonstrated that ethanol-induced neuron apoptosis is critically dependent on expression of Bax, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. To further define the molecular pathway regulating ethanol-induced neuron apoptosis, we analyzed the effects of acute ethanol exposure on cerebellar internal granule cell neurons both in vivo and in vitro. Ethanol produced extensive Bax-dependent caspase-3 activation and neuron apoptosis in the cerebellar internal granule cell layer, which was maximal at approximately 6 hours postadministration. This effect was recapitulated in vitro and required new gene transcription, protein translation, Bax expression, and caspase activation. Ethanol-induced neuron death was independent of p53 expression and was unaffected by deficiency in the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bid or Bad. These studies indicate that ethanol activates an intrinsic apoptotic death program in neurons that is likely to contribute to the neuropathologic effects of human fetal alcohol exposure.", 
    "91": "Taking care of the dying is an important and demanding concern for the general physician. In addition to the amelioration of pain, he also has to help the patient to cope with dyspnea, vomiting, constipation, depression and anxiety. To this end, not only morphine but also anti-emetic drugs, laxatives and peristalsis-stimulating suppositories, benzodiazepines and neuroleptics with a sedating effect can make it easier for the patient during the terminal phase of his life. As least as important as the support provided by medication, however, are sympathetic communication with the patient and human warmth.", 
    "92": "Micturating cystourethrography (MCUG) is a radiological examination of the urethra, bladder and kidneys frequently performed in children. The examination is known to be distressing for the child as well as parents and staff. The literature shows that proper information to both children and parents and the use of distraction techniques during the MCUG can lessen the children's distress and increase their cooperation. The use of sedation makes MCUG less distressing for the child, with very few side effects and no negative effects on the outcome of the examination. The aim was to study how Norwegian university hospitals apply empirical knowledge in their MCUG routines.", 
    "93": "The study is based on observations of MCUG examinations of six children, mean age 3 years (range 6 months to 8 years). A questionnaire on MCUG routines and use of written information was completed by six departments of radiology.", 
    "94": "All the hospitals sent written information, though of varying quality and only in Norwegian, to patients/parents before the MCUG. The hospitals reported the use of different types of distraction techniques. Sedation with midazolam was used in all the hospitals, but the frequency varied from 6% to 75% of the examined children.", 
    "95": "The MCUG routines in Norwegian university hospitals are to varying extent in accordance with empirical recommendations; there is still scope for improvements with regard to written and oral information, distraction techniques and sedation.", 
    "96": "Obstetric endoscopy procedures are routinely performed at our institution to treat selected complications of monochorionic twin gestation. We perform these procedures under combined spinal epidural anesthesia plus maternal sedation. In the absence of general anesthesia, fetal immobilization is not achieved. We hypothesized that remifentanil would induce adequate maternal sedation and provide fetal immobilization, which is equal or superior to that induced by diazepam. Fifty-four second trimester pregnant women were included in this randomized, double-blind trial. After combined spinal epidural anesthesia, maternal sedation was initiated using either incremental doses of diazepam or a continuous infusion of remifentanil. Maternal sedation, hemodynamics, side effects, and fetal hemodynamics and immobilization were evaluated before, during, and for 60 min after surgery. Remifentanil produced adequate maternal sedation with mild but clinically irrelevant respiratory depression (respiratory rate 13 +/- 4 breaths/min and Pco(2) 38.6 +/- 4 mm Hg at 40 min of surgery), whereas diazepam resulted in a more pronounced maternal sedation but no respiratory depression (respiratory rate 18 +/- 3 breaths/min and Pco(2) 32.7 +/- 3 mm Hg at 40 min of surgery). Compared with diazepam, fetal immobilization with remifentanil occurred faster and was more pronounced, resulting in improved surgical conditions; the number of gross body and limb movements was 12 +/- 4 (diazepam) versus 2 +/- 1 (remifentanil) at 40 min of surgery. Because of this, the mean (range) duration of surgery was significantly shorter in the remifentanil-treated patients, 60 (54-71) min versus 80 (60-90) min in the diazepam group. We conclude that remifentanil produces improved fetal immobilization with good maternal sedation and only minimal effects on maternal respiration.", 
    "97": "We investigated the effects of IV midazolam on spinal cord blood flow in 32 cats anesthetized with isoflurane. Cats underwent laminectomy, and the lumbar spinal cord was exposed. A platinum electrode was inserted stereotaxically into the spinal cord to a depth of 1 mm-2 mm lateral to midline at L2. Arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and spinal cord blood flow (using the hydrogen clearance method) were measured before and at 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after an IV bolus of midazolam (0, 1, 2, or 4 mg/kg in saline 5 mL; n = 8 cats per dose). Arterial blood pressure was not affected by 0 or 1 mg/kg of midazolam but was decreased for 30 min by 2 or 4 mg/kg of midazolam. Heart rate did not change. Spinal cord blood flow was increased for 90 min by midazolam 1 mg/kg and for 15 min by midazolam 2 mg/kg but was not changed by midazolam 4 mg/kg. In conclusion, 1 mg/kg of midazolam increased feline spinal cord blood flow without changing arterial blood pressure. In contrast, a larger dose of midazolam (4 mg/kg) did not change spinal cord blood flow but substantially decreased arterial blood pressure during isoflurane anesthesia.", 
    "98": "We assessed the effect of music on the level of sedation and the electroencephalograph bispectral index (BIS) during the preoperative period. Fifty-four ASA physical status I-II patients, scheduled for elective septo-rhinoplastic surgery, were included in the study. Subjects were assigned to receive either music (music group; n = 28) or no music (control group; n = 26) during the preoperative period. Sedative premedication was provided with midazolam 0.08 mg/kg IM. Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scales (OAAS) scores and BIS values were recorded at specific time intervals. In the control group, there were more patients with an OAAS score of 1 than in the music group at 30 min after midazolam injection. In addition, there were more patients with an OAAS score of 2 in the control group than in the music group at 30-50 min. However, there were significantly more patients with an OAAS score of 3 in the music group than in the control group at 20-50 min. BIS values of the music group were also smaller than the control group at 30 and 40 min. BIS values were significantly decreased from baseline values at 10-50 min in the music group, whereas BIS values decreased at 30-50 min in the control group. In conclusion, listening to music during midazolam premedication is associated with an increase in sedation level in the preoperative period as reflected by a lower BIS value.", 
    "99": "Heart rate (HR) and arterial blood pressure (BP) changes have been reported during conscious sedation with propofol and midazolam. One potential mechanism to explain these changes is that propofol and midazolam affect HR and BP via changes in the cardiac autonomic nervous system. Two specific hypotheses were tested by HR variability analysis: 1) propofol induces predominance of parasympathetic activity, leading to decreased HR and BP, and 2) midazolam induces predominance of sympathetic activity, leading to increased HR and decreased BP. Thirty dental patients were included in a prospective, randomized study. HR, BP, low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and entropy were monitored during the awake, sedation, and recovery periods and depth of sedation was assessed using the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score. Propofol induced a significant decrease in total power (503 +/- 209 ms(2)/Hz versus 162 +/- 92 ms(2)/Hz) and LF/HF ratio (2.5 +/- 1.2 versus 1.0 +/- 0.4), despite the absence of any change in HR during the sedation period compared with baseline. Midazolam decreased normalized HF (34 +/- 10% versus 10 +/- 4%) but did not significantly change LF/HF ratio (2.3 +/- 1.1 versus 2.2 +/- 1.4) and increased HR in the sedation period. Compared with baseline, propofol was associated with a significant increase in normalized HF in the recovery period (34 +/- 11% versus 44 +/- 12%) and a significant decrease in HR, whereas midazolam was associated with an increase in LF/HF ratio (2.3 +/- 1.1 versus 3.7 +/- 1.8) with no change in HR. These results indicated a dominant parasympathetic effect of propofol and a dominant sympathetic effect of midazolam in both periods. These results should be considered during conscious sedation, especially in patients at risk of cardiovascular complications.", 
    "100": "Single-shot \"kiddie caudal\" with bupivacaine alone is losing popularity because of its duration of 4-8 h. In a prospective randomized double-blind clinical study, we assessed and compared the efficacy of ketamine, midazolam, and neostigmine coadministered with bupivacaine in a caudal epidural to provide intraoperative and postoperative pain relief. Eighty children (ASA status I) aged 5-10 yr undergoing unilateral inguinal herniotomy were allocated randomly in equal numbers (n = 20) into 4 groups to receive a caudal injection of 0.25% bupivacaine (1 mL/kg) with or without ketamine (0.5 mg/kg), midazolam (50 microg/kg), and neostig-mine (2 microg/kg), after the induction of standardized general anesthesia without premedication. Monitoring for pain, sedation, postoperative nausea/vomiting, dizziness, and pruritus was performed by anesthesiologists blinded to the study allocation. The time to first analgesic administration (paracetamol syrup) was longer (P < 0.05) in the bupivacaine-neostigmine group and the bupivacaine-midazolam group than in the other groups. Undesirable effects, such as emesis, pruritus, and dizziness, were comparable in all groups. However, the incidence of hallucination was more frequent in the bupivacaine-ketamine group compared with the other groups. This study shows that single-shot caudal coadministration of bupivacaine-neostigmine and bupivacaine-midazolam was associated with an extended duration of postoperative pain relief.", 
    "101": "Granule cells in the olfactory bulb (OB) are continually produced and added into the neuronal circuit in the adult brain. Sensory input to the OB plays a key role in the survival of newly generated granule cells. Here, we examined in the adult mice whether there is a time window after the generation of new granule cells when their survival is strongly influenced by sensory input. New granule cells were labeled by BrdUrd injection, and the mice were deprived of sensory input unilaterally by naris cauterization. During the initial 14 days after BrdUrd labeling, the number of BrdUrd-positive granule cells was similar for deprived and undeprived OBs. At 28 days or later, the BrdUrd-positive cell number remarkably decreased in the deprived OB. Cauterization at days 14-28 effectively reduced the number of BrdUrd-positive granule cells, whereas 2-week cauterization before or after this period produced little effect. Administration of diazepam, a GABAA receptor modulator, decreased the number of BrdUrd-positive granule cells. The diazepam administration was most effective at days 14-28. Histochemical examination showed that activation of caspase-3 was accompanied by apoptotic cell death of granule cells that was induced by sensory deprivation or diazepam administration. Double labeling with activated caspase-3 and BrdUrd indicated that granule cells at days 14-20 were most susceptible to cell death. These results indicate that there is a critical period when the survival of new granule cells is determined in a sensory experience-dependent manner and that the pharmacological manipulation can mimic the effect of sensory deprivation.", 
    "102": "The present paper reports the synthesis and binding studies of new 2-phenylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-3-yl acetamides as selective Peripheral Benzodiazepine Receptor (PBR) ligands. The variability of substituents at the 3-position was investigated and a 3D-QSAR model was proposed to evaluate the effect of different substitutions on the acetamide moiety. In addition, a subset of the novel compounds showing high affinity for PBR was tested for their ability to modulate the steroid biosynthesis in C6 glioma cells.", 
    "103": "Activation of GABA(A) and benzodiazepine receptors within the dorsal periaqueductal grey inhibits the escape behaviour evoked by the electrical stimulation of this midbrain area, a defensive reaction that has been related to panic. Nevertheless, there is no evidence indicating whether the same antiaversive effect is also observed in escape responses evoked by species-specific threatening stimuli. In the present study, male Wistar rats were injected intra-dorsal periaqueductal grey with the benzodiazepine receptor agonist midazolam (10, 20 and 40 nmol), the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol (2, 4 and 8 nmol), the GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen (2, 4 and 8 nmol), or with the benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG 7142 (20, 40 and 80 pmol) and tested in an ethologically-based animal model of anxiety, the elevated T-maze. Besides escape, this test also allows the measurement of inhibitory avoidance which has been related to generalised anxiety disorder. Midazolam, muscimol and baclofen impaired escape, a panicolytic-like effect, without altering inhibitory avoidance. FG 7142, on the other hand, facilitated both avoidance and escape reactions, suggesting an anxiogenic and panicogenic-like effect, respectively. The data suggest that GABA(A)/benzodiazepine and GABA(B) receptors within the dorsal periaqueductal grey are involved in the control of escape behaviour and that a failure in this regulatory mechanism may be of importance in panic disorder.", 
    "104": "The objective of this study was to examine urinary excretion profiles of two major triazolam metabolites, alpha-hydroxytriazolam (alpha-OHTRZ) and 4-hydroxytriazolam (4-OHTRZ) in humans. Urine samples were collected from three healthy male volunteers who had been previously administered single 0.25- and 0.5-mg doses of triazolam 24 h and 48 h, respectively, before sample collection. After enzymatic hydrolysis and extraction, each sample was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. alpha-OHTRZ was rapidly excreted, with the maximum concentrations appearing in the first or second sample collected after ingestion, with the majority of the drug being excreted within 12 h. Meanwhile, 4-OHTRZ was excreted more slowly than alpha-OHTRZ. The alpha-OHTRZ/4-OHTRZ ratios were initially greater than 19.7, then decreased rapidly, reaching a nearly constant value for times in excess of 12 h.", 
    "105": "A newly developed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) method was used to study 3000 human urine samples from 3 different populations for 23 analytes covering phenylethylamines, benzylpiperazine, and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics. Direct injection of urine and LC-MS-MS with rapid chromatography and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization was used in the screening step. The cutoff levels were chosen to be at the limit of detection for most analytes to identify as many positive samples as possible. Typically one ion transition was monitored from the pseudo-molecular ions in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. Of the 797 positive screening findings, 518 (65%) were confirmed by a second LC-MS-MS analysis including solid-phase extraction. Confirmed analytical findings included 22 cases positive for N-benzylpiperazine, 88 for 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine and metabolites, 4 for 1-phenyl-2-butylamine, 24 for zolpidem and metabolites, 118 for zopiclone and metabolites, and 1 for zaleplon. In conclusion, LC-MS-MS was found to be a robust alternative for drugs of abuse screening, offering high sensitivity compared with immunochemical screening methodology.",

They reported use of benzodiazepines for anxiety/insomnia (n = 51, 93%), panic disorder (n = 43, 78%), depression (n = 26, 43%), essential hypertension (n = 15, 27 %) and uncomplicated low back pain (n = 10, 18%). Twenty-eight general practitioners would prescribe benzodiazepines for non-psychiatric conditions, 17 for use as muscle relaxants. Seventy-five per cent, 62% and 29% of the general practitioners agreed or totally agreed with the use of benzodiazepines for insomnia, anxiety and depression, respectively. Practitioners agreed that prescribing should be less than one week (80%); or from 1 week to 1 month (47%); or 1 to 4 months (16%); or 4 to 6 months (5%) or more than 6 months (2%). Twenty-five general practitioners (45%) accepted that they used benzodiazepines excessively in the past year.",

    "110": "The role of voltage-gated and ligand-gated ion channels in epileptogenesis of both genetic and acquired epilepsies, and as targets in the development of new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is reviewed. Voltage-gated Na+ channels are essential for action potentials, and their mutations are the substrate for generalised epilepsy with febrile seizures plus and benign familial neonatal infantile seizures; Na+ channel inhibition is the primary mechanism of carbamazepine, phenytoin and lamotrigine, and is a probable mechanism for many other classic and novel AEDs. Voltage-gated K+ channels are essential in the repolarisation and hyperpolarisation that follows paroxysmal depolarisation shifts (PDSs), and their mutations are the substrate for the benign neonatal epilepsy and episodic ataxia type 1; they are new targets for AEDs such as retigabine. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are involved in neurotransmitter release, in the sustained depolarisation-phase of PDSs, and in the generation of absence seizures; their mutations are a substrate for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and the absence-like pattern seen in some mice; the antiabsence effect of ethosuximide is due to the inhibition of thalamic T-type Ca2+ channels. Voltage-gated Cl- channels are implicated in GABA(A) transmission, and mutations in these channels have been described in some families with juvenile myoclonic epilepsies, epilepsy with grand mal seizures on awakening or juvenile absence epilepsy. Hyperpolarisation-activated cation channels have been implicated in spike-wave seizures and in hippocampal epileptiform discharges. The Cl- ionophore of the GABA(A) receptor is responsible for the rapid post-PDS hyperpolarisation, it has been involved in epileptogenesis both in animals and humans, and mutations in these receptors have been found in families with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy or generalised epilepsy with febrile seizures plus; enhancement of GABA(A) inhibitory transmission is the primary mechanism of benzodiazepines and phenobarbital and is a mechanistic approach to the development of novel AEDs such as tiagabine or vigabatrin. Altered GABA(B)-receptor function is implicated in spike-wave seizures. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are implicated in the sustained depolarisation phase of PDS and in epileptogenesis both in animals and humans; felbamate, phenobarbital and topiramate block these receptors, and attenuation of glutamatergic excitatory transmission is another new mechanistic approach. Mutations in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor are the substrates for the nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. The knowledge of the role of the ion channels in the epilepsies is allowing the design of new and more specific therapeutic strategies.", 
    "111": "GABA(A) receptor channels are ubiquitous in the mammalian central nervous system mediating fast inhibitory neurotransmission by becoming permeant to chloride ions in response to GABA. The emphasis of this review is on the rich chemical diversity of ligands that influence GABA(A) receptor function. Such diversity provides many avenues for the design and development of new chemical entities acting on GABA(A) receptors. There is also a significant diversity of GABA(A) receptor subtypes composed of different protein subunits. The discovery of subtype specific agents is a major challenge in the continuing development of GABA(A) receptor pharmacology. Leads for the discovery of new chemical entities that influence GABA(A) receptors come from using recombinant GABA(A) receptors of known subunit composition as has been elegantly demonstrated by the refining of benzodiazepine actions with alpha1 subunit preferring agents showing sedative properties but not anxiolytic properties. The most recent advances in the therapeutic use of agents acting on GABA(A) receptors concern the promotion of sound sleep. Many herbal medicines are used to promote sleep and many of their active ingredients include flavonoids and terpenoids known to modulate GABA(A) receptor function.", 
    "112": "Elderly patients are more likely to ingest prescription medications concurrently with botanical supplements, and may therefore be vulnerable to herb-drug interactions. Phytochemical-mediated modulation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity may underlie many herb-drug interactions. Some evidence suggests that CYP activity may decrease in the elderly. If so, herb-mediated changes in CYP activity may take on greater clinical relevance in this population. In this study, single timepoint, phenotypic metabolic ratios were used to determine whether long-term supplementation of St John's wort, garlic oil, Panax ginseng, and Ginkgo biloba affected CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A4 activity in elderly subjects.",

We analyzed data from a large collaborative observational study group, the Italian Silver Network Home Care project, that collected data on patients admitted to home care programs (n = 2854).",

Among benzodiazepine users, patients taking agents with long elimination half-life (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.00-2.19) and patients taking benzodiazepines with short elimination half-life (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.02-1.72) had an increased risk of falls. Patients taking antidepressants did not show a higher risk of falling compared to nonusers (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.83-1.41).",

Our findings do not support the hypothesis that preferential prescribing of short-acting benzodiazepines instead of long-acting agents or atypical antipsychotic medications instead of typical agents will substantially decrease fall risk associated with the use of these classes of drugs.", 
    "120": "The aim of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy of electro-acupuncture (EA) with the combination of tramadol+midazolam (TM) for pain relief during outpatient extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL). A total of 35 patients (20 men, 15 women) with stones located in the pelvicalyceal system of the kidney were randomized prospectively to undergo lithotripsy with a third generation lithotriptor (Stone Lith, smart PCK) after receiving either EA (n=17) or TM (n=18) for sedation and analgesia. EA treatment was applied to patients by the same licensed acupuncturist 30 min prior to ESWL in group EA. Tramadol (1.5 mg/kg) 30 min before the start of lithotripsy and midazolam (0.06 mg/kg) 5 min prior to ESWL were given as a sedo-analgesic intravenously to group TM. During ESWL, blood pressure, heart rate, pain and sedation levels were measured at baseline and every 15 min thereafter. The pain intensity perceived during lithotripsy was evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS). There was no statistical differences in the diameters of the stones and age of the patients between groups (P=0.590; P=0.568, respectively). In the EA group, the median of maximum energy level achieved was 16.0 kV (range 10-23 kV), while it was 18.0 kV (range 10-20 kV) in the TM group. There was no statistically significant difference between the maximum energy levels applied to the patients during ESWL (P=0.613). The median numbers of shockwaves were 2,114 (range 1,100-3,800) and 2,200 (range 1,500-3,200) in the EA and TM groups, respectively. In the TM group, the numbers of shockwaves used were higher than in group EA during ESWL. However, this difference was not significant (P=0.732). VAS scores were consistently lower in the EA group compared with the TM group throughout the ESWL procedure. The median VAS score was 5.0 (range 1-10) in the EA group while it was 8.0 (range 2-10) in the TM group. The patients who underwent EA had lower median scores of VAS than patients who took only conservative treatment, but this difference was not significant (P=0.245). When both groups were compared for stone-free rates, no significant difference was found [82.3% (14/17) for group EA, 88.8% (16/18) for group TM] (P=0.658). Durations of ESWL procedures were similar in both groups [median 27.4 min (range 15.7-34.3) in group EA vs 27.1 min (range 16.1-33.6) in group TM] (P=0.517). No side effects was seen in any patient who received EA. Side effects such as mild orthostatic hypotension and dizziness occurred in patients given sedo-analgesia, but these were not severe enough to require any patient to be excluded from the study. Our study shows that EA is an effective method for inducing sedation with analgesia without any demonstrable side effects.", 
    "121": "Withdrawal from chronic benzodiazepines is associated with increased anxiety and seizure susceptibility. Neuroadaptive changes in neural activity occur in limbo-cortical structures although changes at the level of the GABA(A) receptor do not provide an adequate explanation for these functional changes. We have employed two diazepam treatment regimes known to produce differing effects on withdrawal aversion in the rat and examined whether withdrawal-induced anxiety was accompanied by changes in AMPA receptor characteristics. Rats were given 28 days treatment with diazepam by the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route (5 mg/kg) and the subcutaneous (s.c.) route (15 mg/kg). Withdrawal anxiety in the elevated plus maze was evident in the group withdrawn from chronic s.c. diazepam (relatively more stable plasma levels) but not from the chronic i.p. group (fluctuating daily plasma levels). In the brains of these rats, withdrawal anxiety was accompanied by increased [3H]Ro48 8587 binding in the hippocampus and thalamus, and decreased GluR1 and GluR2 subunit mRNA expression in the amygdala (GluR1 and GluR2) and cortex (GluR1). The pattern of changes was different in the chronic i.p. group where in contrast to the chronic s.c. group, there was reduced [3H]Ro48 8587 binding in the hippocampus and no alterations in GluR1 and GluR2 subunit expression in the amygdala. While both groups showed reduced GluR1 mRNA subunit expression in the cortex overall, only the agranular insular cortex exhibited marked reductions following chronic i.p. diazepam. Striatal GluR2 mRNA expression was increased in the i.p. group but not the s.c. group. Taken together, these data are consistent with differential neuroadaptive processes in AMPA receptor plasticity being important in withdrawal from chronic benzodiazepines. Moreover, these processes may differ both at a regional and receptor function level according to the behavioral manifestations of withdrawal.", 
    "122": "The present study in mice compared the putative anxiolytic-like effect of paeonol, a phenolic component from the root bark of Paeonia moutan, with the benzodiazepine diazepam in the elevated plus maze and the light/dark box-test. The comparison was also with regard to locomotor activity (open-field test) and myorelaxant potential (inclined plane test). As with 2 mg/kg diazepam, paeonol (at 17.5 mg/kg) increased the percentage of time spent on open arms in the elevated plus maze and increased the time spent in the light area of the light/dark box (at 8.75 and 17.5 mg/kg). Since paeonol, in contrast to diazepam, had no effect on either the number of squares entered in the open-field test or in the inclined plane test, its side-effect profile is considered as superior to the benzodiazepine.",

Wherever possible and appropriate, information from randomized controlled trials was given priority.", 
    "125": "Benzodiazepines have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with anxiety disorders, with varying degrees of efficacy. Use of BZDs is advantageous because they have a quick onset of action and are generally well tolerated. Extended-release formulations of BZDs may be particularly advantageous in some patients with anxiety as they allow for maximization of a drug's therapeutic window with consistent serum drug concentrations.", 
    "126": "BZDs remain a mainstay in the treatment of anxiety, as both monotherapy and adjunctive therapy. Factors to consider prior to prescribing a BZD include the patient's diagnosis, as well as drug characteristics, including the potential for interactions with other drugs, the risk of dependence and withdrawal, and the required frequency of dosing.", 
    "127": "The most frequently diagnosed dementia diseases include Alzheimer disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD) and dementia with Lewy bodies. Cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors and the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine are currently recommended as first line drugs for the treatment of AD. These anti-dementia drugs have not yet been approved for the treatment of VD and DLB although the results of controlled clinical studies support the effectiveness of the ChE inhibitors for both diseases. The treatment of the primary disease and the secondary prevention of cerebrovascular accidents constitute the primary objectives of VD therapy. Although single or multiple domain cognitive deficits are the clinical key symptoms of dementia, noncognitive psychopathological symptoms (so-called behavioral disorders) are particularly common and may even dominate the clinical course in the moderate to severe stages. Therefore, it is important to recognize, diagnose and specifically treat these additional symptoms. During the last decade, the classic neuroleptics and benzodiazepine have been largely replaced by modern antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics and benzodiazepine analogues.", 
    "128": "Sleep disorders could be the symptoms of organic or non-organic conditions. The diagnostics comprises a detailed medical history of the patient complemented by a sleep diary, as well as organic medical and psychological/psychiatric examinations. For drug therapy benzodiazepine, antidepressants, neuroleptics, antihistamines, plant-based preparations and natural sleep-inducing substances such as L-tryptophan or melatonin are used. Nondrug strategies include sleep hygiene, stimulus control, sleep restriction and cognitive techniques. For sleep disturbances due to a psychological or organic disease, the primary condition must be treated.", 
    "129": "The combination of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with atypical antipsychotic drugs exhibits beneficial effects in treatment-resistant depression. We investigated the effects of a 2-week treatment with a low fluoxetine dose (3 mg/kg per day) plus a single injection of olanzapine (3 mg/kg) on the dialysate concentration of noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin (5-HT) in the medial prefrontal cortex of the rat. Chronic fluoxetine increased only 5-HT levels whereas single olanzapine administration increased the concentration of catecholamines and decreased that of 5-HT to a comparable extent in vehicle- and fluoxetine-treated rats. Therefore, it is possible that the therapeutic benefit of this pharmacological combination may not be associated to changes in the cortical concentration of monoamines, but to postsynaptic blockade of monoaminergic receptors.", 
    "130": "Ethyl 2-(4-bromophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-1H-4-imidazolecarboxylate (TG41) enhanced the binding both of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and of flunitrazepam to rat cerebral cortical membranes. Electrophysiological recordings from Xenopus oocytes expressing various recombinant GABA(A) receptor subtypes revealed that TG41 enhanced the function of all receptor subunit combinations tested. The potency of TG41 at receptors containing alpha1, beta2, and gamma2L subunits was greater than that of alphaxalone, etomidate, propofol, or pentobarbital. The potency of TG41 was also greater at receptors containing alpha1 or alpha2 subunits than at those containing alpha4 and it was markedly higher at receptors containing beta2 or beta3 subunits than at those containing beta1. This drug induced a reversible loss of the righting reflex in Xenopus tadpoles and it elicited hypnosis (5 mg/kg) after intravenous administration in rats. These results indicate that the pharmacological profile of TG41 is similar to that of general anesthetics which potentiate the activity of GABA(A) receptors containing the beta2 or beta3 subunit.", 
    "131": "Status epilepticus (SE) should be treated as quickly as possible with full doses of medications as detailed in a written hospital protocol. Lorazepam is the drug of choice for initial treatment. If intravenous access is not immediately available, then rectal diazepam or nasal or buccal midazolam should be given. Prehospital treatment of seizures by emergency personnel is effective and safe, and may prevent cases of refractory SE. Home treatment of prolonged seizures or clusters with buccal, nasal, or rectal benzodiazepines should be considered for all at-risk patients. Nonconvulsive SE is underdiagnosed. An electroencephalogram should be obtained immediately in anyone with unexplained alteration of behavior or mental status and after convulsive SE if the patient does not rapidly awaken. Delay in diagnosis of SE is associated with a worse outcome and a higher likelihood of poor response to treatment. For refractory SE, continuous intravenous midazolam and propofol (alone or in combination) are rapidly effective. Randomized trials are needed to determine the best treatment for SE after lorazepam.", 
    "132": "Although in bipolar patients the main therapeutic indication of atypical antipsychotics is the management of acute mania, several observations suggest that these agents may exert antidepressant as well as anti-manic effects. The main goal of the present work was to evaluate the putative antidepressant effect of chronic olanzapine (Ola) (0.02-0.1 or 0.5 mg/kg.d), in comparison to haloperidol (Hal) (0.2 mg/kg.d) and sodium valproate (VPA) (5 or 30 mg/kg.d), in rats exposed to a protocol of chronic mild stress. The tricyclic compound amitriptyline (Ami) (5 mg/kg.d) was used as reference drug. The results indicate that Ola, in a rodent model of depression, has protective effects against the stress-induced anhedonia. Compared to Hal and VPA, Ola shows a greater antidepressant activity and is as effective as Ami in preventing the anhedonic state. The effects of Ola and Ami, however, have a different time-course. A full reversion of the anhedonia by Ami appears after a latency of 4 wk, whereas the effect of Ola is already evident 1 wk after the beginning of the chronic treatment. Moreover, the recovery from anhedonia at the end of the stress protocol and after drug cessation was more rapid in groups of rats pretreated with Ola or VPA than in the group of saline-pretreated rats. In conclusion, the results indicate that 0.02 mg/kg.d Ola causes a rapid and sustained antidepressant-like effect, while all other anti-manic treatments show loss of efficacy at 3 wk. Taken together, these observations support the hypothesis that Ola has a broader pharmacotherapeutic profile than solely as an antipsychotic or anti-manic agent.", 
    "133": "Epidemiological knowledge of parasuicides and drug self-poisoning is still limited by a lack of data. A number of preliminary studies, which require further analysis, evidenced that parasuicidal acts occur more often among females, that the peak rate is generally recorded between the ages of 15 and 34 years and psychotropic medications seems to be the most frequently used. The aim of this study was to describe the demographic and clinical variables of a sample of subjects admitted to the Posisoning Treatment Centre (CAV), Niguarda General Hospital, Milan, following drug self-poisoning. Furthermore, this study is aimed to identify the risk factors associated to parasuicidal gestures, with special care for the used drugs, the presence of psychiatric or organic disorders, alcoholism and drug addiction.The study included the 201 patients attending the CAV in 1999 and 2000 who satisfied the criteria of self-poisoning attempts: 106 cases in 1999 and 95 in 2000.The sample had a prevalence of females (64%). The peak rates of parasuicides from drug self-poisoning were reached between 21 and 30 years among the females, and 31 and 40 years among the males. 81.6% of the patients used one or more psychoactive drugs, the most frequent being the benzodiazepines (58.7%), classic neuroleptics (16.9%) and new-generation antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, NARIs) (12.9%). The prevalence of mood disorders was higher among females (64% vs 42%), whereas schizophrenia was more frequently diagnosed in males (22% vs 10%). 61% (33%) had a history of previous attempted suicides. The presence of clinically relevant organic diseases was observed in 24.9% of the sample.", 
    "134": "Buprenorphine is a semi-synthetic opioid derived from thebaine, a naturally occurring alkaloid of the opium poppy, Papaver somniferum. The pharmacology of buprenorphine is unique in that it is a partial agonist at the opioid mu receptor. Buprenorphine undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism and therefore has very low oral bioavailability; however, its bioavailability sublingually is extensive enough to make this a feasible route of administration for the treatment of opioid dependence. The mean time to maximum plasma concentration following sublingual administration is variable, ranging from 40 minutes to 3.5 hours. Buprenorphine has a large volume of distribution and is highly protein bound (96%). It is extensively metabolised by N-dealkylation to norbuprenorphine primarily through cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. The terminal elimination half-life of buprenorphine is long and there is considerable variation in reported values (mean values ranging from 3 to 44 hours). Most of a dose of buprenorphine is eliminated in the faeces, with approximately 10-30% excreted in urine. Naloxone has been added to a sublingual formulation of buprenorphine to reduce the abuse liability of the product. The presence of naloxone does not appear to influence the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine. Buprenorphine crosses the placenta during pregnancy and also crosses into breast milk. Buprenorphine dosage does not need to be significantly adjusted in patients with renal impairment; however, since CYP3A activity may be decreased in patients with severe chronic liver disease, it is possible that the metabolism of buprenorphine will be altered in these patients. Although there is limited evidence in the literature to date, drugs that are known to inhibit or induce CYP3A4 have the potential to diminish or enhance buprenorphine N-dealkylation. It appears that the interaction between buprenorphine and benzodiazepines is more likely to be a pharmacodynamic (additive or synergistic) than a pharmacokinetic interaction. The relationship between buprenorphine plasma concentration and response in the treatment of opioid dependence has not been well studied. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of buprenorphine allow it to be a feasible option for substitution therapy in the treatment of opioid dependence.",

Furthermore, polypharmacy and higher age were the main risk factors for potentially inappropriate drug use in the elderly.", 
    "139": "The benzodiazepines have monopolized the acute anxiety market for about 40 years, but their potential for tolerance and dependency has stimulated an interest in alternative anxiolytics. Until recently, however, attention has focused on existing drugs such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The 5-HT1A partial agonist, buspirone (Bristol-Myers-Squibb), is one of the few compounds developed principally as an anxiolytic since the benzodiazepines. The challenge for the future is not only to find efficacious treatments with a rapid onset of action and an acceptable side effect profile but also to determine the optimal compounds for each of the different anxiety disorders.", 
    "140": "Olanzapine is the most commonly prescribed atypical antipsychotic drug. Recently there has been increased concern over possible adverse metabolic effects of this drug. The authors describe the first case of Guillain-Barr\u00e9-like syndrome associated with an olanzapine hypersensitivity reaction. The presence of progressive numbness, motor weakness, or pain in the limbs of patients receiving olanzapine should raise suspicion of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.", 
    "141": "Olanzapine-related seizures have rarely been reported despite its proconvulsant risk. This is the first description of myoclonic status induced by this antipsychotic. A 54-year-old woman with probable Alzheimer disease developed continuous myoclonic jerks just after adding olanzapine for neuropsychiatric symptoms. She was already receiving citalopram and donepezil at low doses. Jerks coincided with spikes and polyspike/wave complexes on EEG. Olanzapine was immediately suspended and the seizures subsided. A control EEG showed no paroxysmal discharges. Several months later she was given haloperidol and she remained seizure free. Olanzapine shares some pharmacologic similarities with clozapine, a neuroleptic with a high risk of dose-dependent seizures. This adverse effect should be taken into account, and olanzapine should be used with caution if concomitant circumstances could decrease the seizure threshold.", 
    "142": "Flumazenil (FLU), a specific benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor antagonist has been used in the treatment of acute BZ intoxication or the alleviation of BZ-induced withdrawal syndrome on the basis of its weak partial agonist action at GABA(A) receptors. However, given to patients, FLU can worsen diazepam-induced withdrawal syndrome by lowering seizure threshold. We therefore investigated whether imidazenil, a selective positive allosteric modulator of GABA action at GABA(A) receptors containing alpha5 subunit, can antagonize diazepam-induced sedative action and suppression of locomotor activity without affecting diazepam anti-bicuculline action. We report here that while FLU (16.5 micromol/kg) showed no effect on locomotor activity and bicuculline-induced convulsion, it completely antagonized diazepam (10.5 micromol/kg) anti-bicuculline action and the suppression of locomotor activity. However, imidazenil (0.76 micromol/kg) elicited anti-bicuculline action and was dose-dependently antagonized by FLU (16.5 and 33 micromol/kg). Furthermore, imidazenil showed no effect on path length traveled but slightly decreased (40%) horizontal activity when compared to diazepam (85%), and maintained the anti-bicuculline action of diazepam to a threshold level similar to that observed with diazepam. Whereas cross-tolerance between BZs has been reported in animals and humans, we previously reported the absence of cross-tolerance between imidazenil and diazepam. Thus, we suggest that imidazenil might be more effective than FLU at alleviating the withdrawal syndrome associated with long-term BZ administration.", 
    "143": "Chronic antipsychotic drugs treatment may regulate the expression of a variety of genes in the brain, which may underscore their clinical efficacy and/or side effects. In this study, we measured the mRNA levels of three genes encoding the catabolic enzymes of biogenic amine neurotransmitters, i.e., monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), B (MAOB) and catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT), in rat frontal cortex following 4 weeks' treatment of various antipsychotic drugs using quantitative PCR. Significantly elevated mRNA levels of MAOB and COMT were first observed in frontal cortex of rats treated with risperidone (1mg/kg) when compared to control animals. Further study showed that chronic treatment of olanzapine (2mg/kg), but not haloperidol (1mg/kg) or clozapine (20mg/kg), resulted in significantly increased mRNA levels of MAOA, MAOB and COMT in rat frontal cortex as compared to control animals. These results indicate that chronic treatment of different antipsychotic drugs may differentially regulate the gene expression of three catabolic enzymes of biogenic amine neurotransmitters, and which may partly account for the molecular mechanism of their different clinical efficacy.",

Twelve children were hospitalized because of prematurity (two), exposure to other drugs imposing particular surveillance (eight) or in view of abnormal neonatal effects (two). Five newborns (18.5%) of which three had also been exposed to other drugs (benzodiazepine, neuroleptic, H1-antagonist) had presented one or more neonatal adverse effects compatible with the role of the SSRI (irritability, agitation, shivering, hypotonia) but with uncertainty about a clear discrimination between withdrawal syndrome and serotonin impregnation. All the symptoms disappeared spontaneously. One of the five children had a described in treated adults but two neonatal observations were published. No child had hemorrhagic symptoms as described in treated adults despite the fact that two neonatal observations were reported.",

Our recommendations for monitoring the newborns during their stay in maternity wards were well respected. The risk of hemorrhagic symptoms or hyponatremia, not well known by pediatricians, deserves to be recalled to medical teams who take in charge newborns exposed to SSRI.", 
    "148": "We have previously reported that calcium ionophore A23187 differentially induces necrosis in CEM cells, a T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, and apoptosis in HL60 cells, a promyelocytic leukemia cell line. Stimulation with VP16, however, induces typical apoptosis in both cell lines. Necrosis in CEM cells, characterized by cell shrinkage and clustering, began within 5 min of treatment. Swelling of the mitochondria, lumpy chromatin condensation and intact plasma membranes were evident by electron microscopy. These A23187-mediated changes in CEM cells were suppressed by clonazepam or CGP37157, inhibitors of the mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger. The changes, however, were not affected by cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. In both CEM and HL60 cells, intra-cellular calcium increased with similar amplitude within 1 min of treatment with 2 microM A23187. Intra-mitochondrial calcium increased with clonazepam pre-treatment alone in both CEM and HL60 cells. However, intra-mitochondrial calcium did not change drastically in response to A23187 in CEM or HL60 cells, either untreated or pre-treated with clonazepam. A23187 induces necrosis in CEM cells concurrent with mitochondrial dysfunction, which is independent of the mitochondrial permeability transition, but affected by intra-mitochondrial calcium, while HL60 cells lack these early changes. Differences in the responses to A23187 between these two cell lines might derive from differences in the susceptibility of the mitochondrial membrane to rapid increases in intra-cellular calcium.", 
    "149": "Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic that is approved in the US and Europe for the oral treatment of acute manic episodes in patients with bipolar I disorder and for maintenance therapy to prevent recurrence in responders. Oral olanzapine is effective in the treatment of bipolar mania, both as single agent therapy and as adjunctive therapy in combination with lithium or valproate semisodium. In the treatment of acute episodes, olanzapine is superior to placebo and at least as effective as lithium, valproate semisodium, haloperidol and risperidone in reducing the symptoms of mania and inducing remission. Additional comparative studies are required to determine the efficacy of olanzapine relative to newer atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine, ziprasidone and aripiprazole. Olanzapine is also effective at delaying or preventing relapse during long-term maintenance therapy in treatment responders and is currently the only atypical antipsychotic approved for this indication. Current evidence suggests that olanzapine may be more effective than lithium in preventing relapse into mania, but not relapse into depression or relapse overall. Olanzapine is generally well tolerated and, although it is associated with a higher incidence of weight gain than most atypical agents, it has a low incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms. Therefore, oral olanzapine is a useful first-line or adjunctive agent for both the acute treatment of manic episodes and the long-term prevention of relapse into manic, depressive or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.", 
    "150": "It is difficult to determine the relative efficacy of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia, based on the available literature. The purpose of this article is to review and compare the efficacy of two atypical antipsychotics: olanzapine and ziprasidone.This review focused on randomised trials in which these two antipsychotics were compared with placebo, conventional antipsychotics and each other. Common efficacy measures were the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Schedule for Assessment of Negative Symptoms. When sufficient data were available, the mean treatment effect (with 95% confidence intervals) was computed and presented. Olanzapine was consistently found to be significantly superior to placebo and comparable with, or superior to, haloperidol for the treatment of overall, positive and negative schizophrenic symptoms. Ziprasidone appears to have significantly greater efficacy than placebo for overall and negative symptoms, but it remains uncertain whether ziprasidone is comparable in efficacy with conventional antipsychotics such as haloperidol. Two unpublished clinical trials have directly compared olanzapine and ziprasidone. One of these trials found no significant efficacy differences between the two drugs, whereas the results of the other study favoured olanzapine. Compared with ziprasidone, olanzapine has a larger body of evidence supporting its efficacy, and a greater proportion of findings for olanzapine have been published, allowing for greater scrutiny of results. Both drugs appear to be superior to placebo for the treatment of overall and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but olanzapine generally compares more favourably with conventional antipsychotics. Firm conclusions regarding the comparison between olanzapine and ziprasidone require additional published trials on ziprasidone, particularly in direct comparison with olanzapine.", 
    "151": "In the present prospective, randomized controlled trial, 110 unpremedicated patients undergoing orthopedic surgery under regional anesthesia were randomly divided into 5 groups, with 22 patients in each. During the operation, group 1 listened to a pre-recorded explanation and music, group 2 listened to a subliminal sound, group 3 received propofol by patient-controlled sedation (PCS), group 4 received intravenous midazolam, and group 5 was the control group. Patients in the midazolam group were significantly more sedated than the control group at 1 hr into the operation. The group that listened to an explanation and music were significantly less satisfied than the propofol group at the end of the operation and 30 min. postoperatively. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio showed that if explanation and music are used instead of propofol it would save 299.53 baht per patient, but the patient satisfaction score will be 17.26 points lower than if the more expensive drug is used.",

The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of intravenous lorazepam were characterized before and after inhibition with 600 mg valproate once daily for 4 days and after induction with rifampin (INN, rifampicin) pretreatment (600 mg once daily for 10 days), with a washout period of 10 days between. The plasma concentrations of lorazepam and lorazepam glucuronide were analyzed before and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours after lorazepam administration by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Visual analog scale assessments and psychomotor coordination tests were administered before and up to 12 hours after drug administration.",

    "156": "To assess whether gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulation of dopamine is important in mediation of the discriminative stimulus effects of methamphetamine, the GABA compounds chlordiazepoxide (benzodiazepine site agonist), pentobarbital (barbiturate site agonist), bicuculline and pentylenetetrazol (GABA(A) receptor antagonists) were tested in Sprague-Dawley rats trained to discriminate methamphetamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.) from saline. Each of the compounds produced modest amounts of methamphetamine-appropriate responding (20-35%) when tested alone. When tested in combination with methamphetamine, the antagonists (bicuculline and pentylenetetrazol) failed to shift the methamphetamine dose-effect curve. In contrast, chlordiazepoxide (25 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced methamphetamine-appropriate responding at each dose of methamphetamine tested, and pentobarbital (10 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently decreased the discriminative stimulus effects of 1 mg/kg methamphetamine. In conclusion, GABA(A) antagonists and positive modulators likely do not produce methamphetamine-like stimulus effects. However, activation of GABA(A) receptors can interfere with the discriminative stimulus effects of methamphetamine.", 
    "157": "Acute benzodiazepine administrations typically decrease aggressive responding, but increases in aggression have been reported in some studies. The benzodiazepine lorazepam has been studied less frequently than other benzodiazepines in aggression research, although it is often used to suppress violent aggression in patients. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of acute administrations of lorazepam on aggressive responding in adult humans on a laboratory aggression task. Eight adult males participated in experimental sessions on the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP), which provided subjects with aggressive, escape and monetary-reinforced response options. Acute oral doses (1, 2 and 4 mg) of lorazepam decreased both aggressive responding and monetary-reinforced responding in seven of eight subjects. In one subject, lorazepam produced dose-dependent increases in aggressive responding. The effects of lorazepam on escape responding were the same as the effects on aggressive responding. The results are consistent with prior research using the PSAP and clinical data showing that benzodiazepines generally decrease aggression, and contrast with other studies that have shown that benzodiazepines can increase aggression. Since lorazepam affected both aggressive and escape responding, it is suggested that while lorazepam often produces sedation, it also modifies human aggressive responding, in part, by suppressing reactions to aversive stimuli.", 
    "158": "Recent anecdotal evidence suggests that it is becoming increasingly popular among ecstasy users to attempt to negate certain side-effects or enhance the drug experience through the concomitant use of pharmaceutical drugs or supplements. This study was designed to explore the practice of deliberately using pharmaceuticals for any reason in association with ecstasy and related drug (ERD) use. A cross sectional survey was conducted with 216 adults who had used ecstasy at least once in the previous 6 months. Generally, this sample was young, well educated, and likely to be in some form of paid employment. Males were slightly overrepresented within the sample. About one quarter of the sample had deliberately taken a pharmaceutical substance for its putative effects on the euphoric effects of, or recovery from, ecstasy use. Those who reported using pharmaceuticals were significantly more likely to be male, had more 'apparent' years of use, and were more likely to have injected ERDs. As a result, there appears to be a need for harm reduction information for ecstasy users regarding the risks associated with the mixture of ERDs with pharmaceuticals and supplements. Particular attention should be paid to informing users of the potentially fatal serotonin syndrome that is likely to arise from combining serotonin-enhancing substances, such as ecstasy or SSRI and MAOI groups of antidepressants.", 
    "159": "Opioid agonists and benzodiazepine agonists each increase food intake. Both also increase hedonic 'liking' reactions to sweet tastes in rats. Do opioids and benzodiazepines share overlapping mechanisms of hedonic impact? Or are benzodiazepine and opioid effects on hedonic impact mediated by independent mechanisms? The present study examined whether blockade of opioid receptors prevents benzodiazepine-induced enhancement of taste palatability, as assessed by the affective taste reactivity test. Rats were implanted with oral cannulae, and prior to an oral infusion of bittersweet quinine-sucrose solution, all received i.p. injections of either vehicle, or diazepam alone (5 mg/kg diazepam+0 mg/kg naltrexone), naltrexone alone (1 mg/kg naltrexone+0 mg diazepam), or both diazepam plus naltrexone (5 mg/kg diazepam+1mg/kg naltrexone). Videotaped hedonic ('liking') and aversive ('disliking') orofacial reactions elicited by sucrose/quinine taste were compared across drug conditions. Diazepam administration alone more than doubled hedonic 'liking' reactions to the bittersweet taste, while reducing 'disliking' in half, compared to vehicle levels. Naltrexone by itself had little effect on taste-elicited affective reactions, and only marginally increased aversive gapes. However, naltrexone completely blocked diazepam's enhancement of positive hedonic 'liking' reactions, and naltrexone similarly disrupted diazepam-reduction of aversive 'disliking' taste reactions. These results indicate that endogenous opioid neurotransmission may be crucial to benzodiazepine enhancement of hedonic 'liking' for natural taste reward.", 
    "160": "Milnacipran is a serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) which has not yet been systematically studied preclinically or clinically for the treatment of anxiety disorders. In the four-plate test (FPT) which is known to predict anxiolytic-like activity in mice, milnacipran (4, 8, 16 and 32 mg/kg) demonstrated strong anti-punishment effects following acute administration. The anxiolytic-like effect of milnacipran was not reversed by the selective GABA(A) receptor antagonist, flumazenil (2 and 4 mg/kg), the selective alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (0.5 and 2 mg/kg), the selective alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist, idazoxan (1 and 4 mg/kg) or the selective 5-HT2B receptor antagonist, SB 206553 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg). In contrast, the selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, SR 46349B (0.1 and 1 mg/kg), and the non-selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, ketanserin (0.125 and 0.5 mg/kg), completely abolished the anxiolytic-like effect of milnacipran in FPT. Neurochemical depletion of NA or 5-HT completely abolished the activity of milnacipran. These results strongly suggest that activation of 5-HT2A receptors is critically involved in the anxiolytic activity of milnacipran. On the other hand the lack of activity of milnacipran after depletion of NA or 5-HT is consistent with milnacipran acting on the locus coeruleus to induce 5-HT release. The present data suggest a strong connection between 5-HT2A receptors and NA neurotransmission.", 
    "161": "The identification of synaptic GABA(A) receptors has proved difficult as neurones express multiple GABA(A) receptor subunits. For example, cerebellar granule cells express alpha1, alpha6, gamma2, delta and beta2/3 subunits and thus express many different GABA(A) receptor subtypes. Furthermore, the contribution of individual GABA(A) receptor subtypes is changed by developmental alterations in subunit expression. To further characterise the pharmacology of Golgi cell to granule cell synapses during development, the benzodiazepine-site ligand zolpidem was used. Zolpidem shows selectivity for alpha1betaxgamma2 receptors (x is any beta subunit) and slows the decay and enhances the amplitude of alpha1betaxgamma2 receptor-mediated synaptic currents, provided the receptors are not fully occupied. For comparison, zolpidem was applied to Purkinje cell synapses, since the synaptic receptors are of known composition (alpha1betaxgamma2). At immature and adult Golgi cell to granule cell synapses, the decay of spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs and mIPSCs) was slowed by zolpidem but their amplitude and frequency were unaffected. At Purkinje cell synapses, although zolpidem slowed the decay of IPSCs at both immature and adult synapses, zolpidem only enhanced the amplitude of IPSCs at adult synapses. Thus during development, the level of receptor occupation remains constant at Golgi cell to granule cell synapses but falls at Purkinje cell synapses.", 
    "162": "Oral premedication with midazolam and ketamine is widely used in pediatric anesthesia to reduce emotional trauma and ensure smooth induction. However, various dosing regimens when used alone or in combination have variable efficacy and side effect profile. The aim of our study was to investigate and compare the efficacy of oral midazolam alone with a low-dose combination of oral midazolam and ketamine.", 
    "163": "We performed a prospective randomized double-blind study in 100 children who were randomly allocated into two groups. Group M received 0.5 mg.kg(-1) oral midazolam and group MK received 0.25 mg.kg(-1) oral midazolam with 2.5 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine. The preoperative sedation score, ease of parental separation and ease of mask acceptance were evaluated on a 4-point scale. The time to recovery from anesthesia and to achieve satisfactory Aldrete score was also noted.", 
    "164": "Uniform and acceptable sedation scores were seen in both the groups (group M 95.9%; group MK 97.96%), without any serious side effects. However, the combination offered significantly more children in an awake, calm and quiet state, who were easily separated from their parents (73.46% in MK vs 41% in group M). The induction scores were comparable between the groups. The recovery room characteristics and time to achieve satisfactory Aldrete score were also comparable between the two groups.", 
    "165": "Oral midazolam alone and a combination of midazolam with ketamine provide equally effective anxiolysis and separation characteristics. However, the combination provided more children in an awake, calm and quiet state who could be separated easily from parents.", 
    "166": "The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the degree and frequency of prolactin (PRL) elevation and related symptoms in patients treated with 3 different atypical antipsychotics: clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone.", 
    "167": "Twenty-eight patients receiving clozapine, 29 patients receiving olanzapine, and 18 patients receiving risperidone (all meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, schizophreni-form disorder, or schizoaffective disorder) were studied. The median daily dose was 400 mg of clozapine, 10 mg of olanzapine, and 3 mg of risperidone. Fasting morning blood samples were analyzed for PRL, and the occurrence of hyper-prolactinemic symptoms in the patients was evaluated.", 
    "168": "Elevated PRL levels were found in 16 (89%) of the patients receiving risperidone and in 7 (24%) of the patients receiving olanzapine, but in none of the patients receiving clozapine. In addition, there was a significant difference in median PRL level among the treatment groups (p < .0001), in that the PRL level was higher both in the patients treated with risperidone and in the patients treated with olanzapine, compared to those treated with clozapine. Moreover, hyperpro-lactinemic symptoms-menstrual disturbances, galactorrhea, impotence, oligospermia, and decreased libido-were reported in 8 (44%) of the risperidone-treated patients and in 1 (3%) of the olanzapine-treated patients, but in none of the clozapine-treated patients.", 
    "169": "Treatment with risperidone was frequently associated with hyperprolactinemia and related symptoms, whereas the occurrence of PRL elevation and related symptoms was modest in patients receiving olanzapine and nonexistent in those receiving clozapine. Thus, atypical anti-psychotics in therapeutic doses differ with regard to effect on PRL secretion.", 
    "170": "The aim of this study was to investigate if size 5 compared with size 4 ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) in Asian men and size 4 compared with size 3 ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) in Asian women, would give a better glottic seal. We conducted a randomized crossover study involving 30 male and 30 female patients of Asian origin. Size 4 and size 5 PLMA were studied in men and size 3 and size 4 PLMA were studied in women. The patients were anaesthetized and paralysed and the PLMA was inserted with the introducer. The oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP), ease of insertion, anatomical position, mucosal injury, visibility of cuff in the mouth and volume of air required to achieve an intracuff pressure of 60 cmH2O were studied. In male patients, oropharyngeal leak pressure was higher when size 5 PLMA was used (P < 0.001) and there was a higher incidence of mucosal injury (P = 0.025). For female patients, oropharyngeal leak pressure was higher with size 4 PLMA (P = 0.036) while the number of insertion attempts, anatomical position and mucosal injury were similar. The cuff was not visible in the oral cavity in any cases. The mean volume of air required to achieve an intracuff pressure of 60 cmH2O was less than the maximum recommended by the manufacturers. The size 5 PLMA in Asian men and size 4 PLMA in Asian women resulted in a more effective glottic seal. The use of size 5 PLMA in Asian men led to increased mucosal injury.", 
    "171": "Serotonin syndrome results from excessive activation of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) receptors in the nervous system, on the surface of platelets, and on the vascular endothelium. The clinical manifestations are a triad of altered conscious state, autonomic dysfunction, and neuromuscular excitability. Clinical diagnostic criteria remain poorly defined and unvalidated, and there are no available investigations to confirm the diagnosis. The syndrome is caused by the administration of one or more drugs possessing serotonergic activity. Severe forms of the syndrome usually result from overdose, but can be induced by monotherapy. The exact incidence of serotonin syndrome remains unknown, but is likely to be increasing due to increased prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants and tramadol, as well as recreational use of amphetamine-like substances. Serotonin syndrome may complicate the administration of drugs frequently used in anaesthetic practice, including pethidine and tramadol. Although the majority of cases improve with symptomatic and supportive care, severe cases need intensive care and frequently require mechanical ventilation. Neuromuscular excitability is likely to be the cause of rhabdomyolysis seen in severe cases and should be treated with benzodiazepines and muscle relaxants. Supportive therapies are required to treat hyperthermia and autonomic dysfunction. Cyproheptadine is the most commonly administered serotonergic antagonist, but is unavailable in parenteral form.", 
    "172": "Respiratory disorders with stridor are a frequent cause of admission for children in an emergency department. Laryngospasm, as an isolated symptom of epilepsy, is a rare phenomenon [1, 3, 5]. Other respiratory symptoms of epilepsy, rarely seen in childhood, might be apnoeic spells [2, 4]. We report on a child with laryngospasm due to focal epileptic seizures."
