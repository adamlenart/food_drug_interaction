    "0": "The ability of flumazenil to reverse benzodiazepine-induced respiratory depression is discussed through a review of the relevant literature. Flumazenil has been shown to be effective in reversing benzodiazepine-induced sedation, but its ability to reverse benzodiazepine-induced respiratory depression is controversial. Part of this controversy stems from the lack of consistent data on the incidence and nature of depressed respiratory function after benzodiazepine administration. In addition, a variety of tests are used to assess respiratory function, but because breathing is both automatic and under voluntary control, the results of some of these tests can be affected by patient effort. In such cases, improvement can result from an increased level of consciousness even though the central respiratory drive remains depressed. Thus, studies using these tests to determine flumazenil's effect on respiratory depression are inconclusive, as they do not accurately measure reversal of the central respiratory depression induced by benzodiazepines. However, studies using methods that do accurately assess central respiratory drive have involved small numbers of subjects and demonstrated a variable incidence of respiratory depression associated with benzodiazepine use. When benzodiazepine-induced respiratory depression was evident, the ability of flumazenil to reverse it was inconsistent and short-lived. Flumazenil may be able to improve breathing through improved consciousness, but its effects on central respiratory depression are inconsistent. Therefore, unless additional information becomes available supporting flumazenil's ability to reverse benzodiazepine-induced respiratory depression, it should not be used for this indication.",

    "2": "Thirty-two patients scheduled to undergo PBD were prospectively assigned randomly into placebo (30 mL of normal saline) and treatment (30 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine) CPB groups. Each patient received .03 mg/kg of midazolam for premedication before PBD and had access to a patient-controlled analgesia pump during the procedure. The pump was set to deliver 0.2 mg of midazolam and 25 micrograms of fentanyl per dose with a 3-minute lockout time. Vital signs, including heart rate and blood pressure, were continuously monitored during the procedure and recorded for comparison with baseline values. Patients completed a 10-point visual analogue pain scale following completion of their procedure.", 
    "3": "Patients in the placebo and treatment groups self-administered a mean of 2.0 and 1.85 mg of midazolam, respectively (P = .40), and a mean of 247 and 231 micrograms of fentanyl, respectively (P = .40). On a 10-point pain scale, the mean postprocedure versus preprocedure elevation in pain was 2.1 points in the placebo group versus 1.6 points in the treatment group (P = .60). Overall, the degree of satisfaction with the analgesia was equal in both groups.",

    "5": "The effects of thiopental, ketamine, diazepam, xylazine and nitrous oxide, and combinations of thiopental-nitrous oxide and ketamine-nitrous oxide on electroencephalographic (EEG) spike activity and convulsive behaviors in atropinized cats at surgical depth of enflurane anesthesia were assessed quantitatively for 60 minutes during spontaneous ventilation. Mean inspired enflurane concentrations (MIEC) were reduced 16% to 29% by pretreatment with thiopental, ketamine, diazepam, and xylazine, and were reduced 19% by 66% nitrous oxide. The MIEC of cats anesthetized with thiopental-nitrous oxide-enflurane and ketamine-nitrous oxide-enflurane were 35% to 38% lower than that with nitrous oxide-enflurane. Pretreatment with thiopental, ketamine, diazepam, and xylazine did not reduce the EEG spike frequency during anesthesia but did markedly reduce the spike amplitude. The addition of 66% nitrous oxide did not alter the spike frequency during anesthesia but tended to reduce the spike amplitude. Combinations of thiopental-nitrous oxide and ketamine-nitrous oxide almost abolished the spike activity. The addition of 66% nitrous oxide prevented convulsive responses elicited by photic and auditory stimulation during enflurane anesthesia. Treatment with thiopental, ketamine, diazepam and xylazine, and combinations of thiopental-nitrous oxide and ketamine-nitrous oxide, completely prevented convulsive responses during enflurane anesthesia.", 
    "6": "The effects of thiopental, ketamine, diazepam, xylazine, and nitrous oxide, and the combinations of thiopental-nitrous oxide and ketamine-nitrous oxide, on both enflurane-induced electroencephalographic (EEG) spike activity and convulsive behavior were measured quantitatively in atropinized cats receiving enflurane with controlled ventilation. Pretreatments with thiopental, ketamine, and diazepam reduced both EEG spike frequency and amplitude at 2.5% to 4.5% inspired enflurane but did not abolish spike activity. Nitrous oxide (66% of inspired gas) did not significantly alter spike frequency or amplitude during 2.5% to 4.5% inspired enflurane, but the combination of thiopental-nitrous oxide or ketamine-nitrous oxide reduced EEG spike activity during 2.5% inspired enflurane. Enflurane-induced convulsive score was markedly suppressed by thiopental and ketamine and was significantly reduced by diazepam, xylazine and nitrous oxide. The combinations of thiopental-nitrous oxide and ketamine-nitrous oxide greatly reduced behavioral-convulsive responses induced by 2.5% to 4.5% inspired enflurane.", 
    "7": "This study evaluated 36 cancer patients who were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted over a 4-week period to evaluate the efficacy of alprazolam in the treatment of anxiety associated with cancer. Hamilton Anxiety Scale scores declined significantly between baseline and the end of the first week of the study in both treatment groups. There was no significant difference in response between the patients receiving alprazolam and placebo. Similar results were obtained from other instruments. These results suggest that nondrug factors or spontaneous improvement may play a more important role than pharmacotherapy in the treatment of anxiety associated with cancer.",

The side effects of psychotropic drugs need to be distinguished from those of immunosuppressants. Antidepressants, including tricyclics, heterocyclics, MAOIs, stimulants, and newer agents, are discussed. Use of neuroleptics for delirium, mania, and other organic disorders is described. Lithium may be more difficult to use in the immediate postoperative period. Anxiolytics, including benzodiazepines and buspirone, are useful depending on the underlying medical problem.", 
    "9": "Patients with cervical spine injury presenting with respiratory distress require airway management that does not compromise integrity of the atlanto-occipital joint. Endotracheal intubation by means of direct laryngoscopy is not suitable. The method of choice is nasotracheal intubation of the awake patient, using a flexible fibre bronchoscope. If anatomy or surgical access render the nasal approach impossible, fibre optic intubation can be performed orotracheally, utilising specific technical aids. Flexible fibrescopes are available in different sizes (length and diameter): selection is base on the patient's anatomical requirements. Aids to orotracheal intubation are constructed with a bore wide enough to accommodate an endotracheal tube, and a face mask equipped with an extra intubation port allowing introduction of an endotracheal tube, slipped over a fibrescope. Premedication of the patients consists of an orally administered benzodiazepine. Topical anaesthesia and vasoconstriction of the nasal passages are achieved by cocaine (5-10%), or a local anaesthetic, combined with a vasoconstrictor. The selected nostril is prepared by means of introducing a nasopharyngeal airway, which--lubricated with xylocaine gel and left in place for few minutes--widens the nostril and facilitates passage of the endotracheal tube. Through the other nostril, oxygen is administered. Systemic analgo-sedation is strictly limited to fentanyl, 0.1 mg i.v. Topical anaesthesia of the larynx and cranial trachea is achieved by xylocaine, 2%, administered under direct vision through the instrumentation channel of the fibrescope.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "Interaction of midazolam and thiopental in amnestic effect was studied in 30 adult patients who underwent elective surgery of lower extremities under epidural or spinal anesthesia in combination with oxygen, nitrous oxide and low concentration of sevoflurane. Combination of midazolam 2.0-3.0 mg (0.041 +/- 0.006 mg.kg-1) and thiopental 3-5 mg.kg-1 produced amnestic effect in 87% of patients. No side effects, such as decrease in O2 saturation, upper airway obstruction, cardiovascular depression and delayed emergence were observed with this small dose of midazolam. Administration of midazolam 2.0-3.0 mg before epidural, or spinal anesthesia in the operating room under observation of anesthesiologists, followed by thiopental 3-5 mg.kg-1, was safe and comfortable to the patients.", 
    "11": "There is a large quantity of literature on drug interactions with oral contraceptive (OC) steroids although their incidence is not known. The potential clinical significance of some interactions makes it important for all prescribing doctors and dentists to have some knowledge of the topic. Interactions may be divided into those in which OC effectiveness is impaired, causing breakthrough bleeding or pregnancy, those in which OC activity is enhanced by other drugs and those in which OCs interfere with the metabolism or activity of other therapeutic agents. Consideration of their pharmacology indicates that impairment of OC effect is most likely to be due to interference with ethinylestradiol. This is because this compound is sulphated in the gut wall, hydroxylated and glucuronidated in the liver, and undergoes enterohepatic recirculation. The progestogens are only metabolised in the liver and have no significant enterohepatic recirculation. Protein binding interactions are rarely of clinical importance. OC plasma concentrations may be reduced by induction of hepatic metabolism in the case of griseofulvin, rifampicin (rifampin) and several anticonvulsant drugs; valproic acid (sodium valproate) does not have this effect. Antibiotics may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation of ethinylestradiol and reduce plasma levels of active hormone. This is probably only of significance in a subgroup of women who may sometimes be suspected on history, but cannot be identified by any diagnostic test. Reasons for differences between case reports and formal studies of interactions with antibiotics are discussed. Plasma concentrations of ethinylestradiol may be increased by ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and paracetamol (acetaminophen) which compete with it for sulphation in the gut wall. Theoretically, problems may arise if these agents are stopped suddenly. Imidazole antifungal agents can inhibit ethinylestradiol metabolism and increase its plasma concentrations but the clinical significance of this is unknown. OCs have been shown to inhibit metabolism of many therapeutic drugs and increase their plasma concentrations. This may be of clinical significance in the case of benzodiazepines which are hydroxylated in the liver, but clinical effects are less certain with the other agents. OCs may induce metabolism of other drugs which are glucuronidated, including some benzodiazepines and analgesics. The clinical significance of this type of interaction is also unknown. It is suggested that all prescribers should remember to ask about OCs when taking a drug history and to consider the possibility of interactions with other drugs.", 
    "12": "The authors describe three cases in which midazolam was successfully used in diagnostic hypnosedative interviews. A discussion comparing and contrasting midazolam to other intravenous hypnosedatives is presented. The authors suggest that midazolam is an effective agent for diagnostic hypnosedative interviews and may be preferable to other agents when posthypnotic recollection of interview content is undesirable.", 
    "13": "Sprague-Dawley rats injected with a \"physiological\" dose of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8; 6 micrograms/kg ip) expressed c-fos immunoreactivity in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS) and the area postrema (AP) of the brain stem. Injection of the CCK-A antagonist L-364,718 30 min before CCK-8 injection eliminated c-fos expression in these regions. These findings support the hypothesis that CCK-8 induced c-fos expression is mediated by CCK-A receptors. We then tested whether a meal (Isocal) could activate c-fos, and, if so, whether this response could be eliminated by L-364,718. Ingestion of Isocal induced c-fos immunoreactivity in the NTS and AP. Meal-induced c-fos expression was not blocked by the CCK-A antagonist L-364,718. These findings demonstrate for the first time that a purely physiological nonnoxious stimulus, a meal, induces c-fos in the rat brain stem and indicate that feeding induces c-fos expression by a pathway that is largely, if not entirely, independent of CCK release.", 
    "14": "This randomized, double-blind crossover study was undertaken to compare the antiemetic effectiveness of intravenous prochlorperazine (Compazine) and lorazepam (Ativan) in the management of postchemotherapy symptoms during two initial cycles of therapy. Each patient received at least one treatment as an outpatient. Data from the 24 patients receiving noncisplatin therapy who completed the crossover study were evaluated for antiemetic efficacy and total posttherapy symptom experience. Although results indicated no statistically significant difference between regimens in the control of posttherapy nausea and vomiting, these side effects were completely controlled in 26 of the 48 study treatment cycles. Lorazepam significantly reduced total posttherapy symptom experience by decreasing patients' experience of fatigue and pain. Findings support the value of lorazepam in antiemetic regimens and point to the need for further examination of antiemetic combinations.", 
    "15": "The effect of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists such as ondansetron, ICS 205-930, MDL 72222, metoclopramide, and zacopride was investigated on the ethanol as well as diazepam withdrawal phenomena in the present study. There was a significant increase in locomotor activity in the ethanol- as well as diazepam-withdrawn rats. The treatment of rats with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists during withdrawal phase did not modify the effect. The ethanol-withdrawn rats were more sensitive to pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced convulsions as compared to control animals. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists did not attenuate the increased sensitivity of ethanol-withdrawn rats to PTZ. These observations indicated that 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are ineffective in attenuating hyperlocomotor activity following abrupt termination of chronic administration of ethanol or diazepam, and increased sensitivity to PTZ in the ethanol-withdrawn rats.", 
    "16": "The protective effects of the imidazobenzodiazepines Ro 15-4513 and Ro 15-3505 against ethanol-induced gastric damage were investigated. Gastric lesions were induced in rats by the oral administration of 1 ml of absolute ethanol. Ro 15-4513 (2.5-10 mg/kg, IP) or Ro 15-3505 (5-20 mg/kg, IP), administered 30 min before ethanol, protected against ethanol-induced gastric damage. The protective effects of these compounds were blocked by the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil (10 mg/kg, IP). These results present evidence for the involvement of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex in the pathogenesis of ethanol-induced gastric damage.", 
    "17": "Disruption of the connections between the temporal cortex (TC) and lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) in rats causes impaired memory accompanied by decreased levels of glutamate in these neocortical areas. Administration of glutamergic agonists to rats with TC/LEC disruptions improves retroactive memory. The purpose of this study was to test effects of glycine on proactive memory. The results show that a relatively large dose of glycine (750 mg/kg) injected just prior to training enhanced both acquisition and retention of a discrimination task in TC/LEC rats. Glycine given 1 day prior to training impaired the initial phase of acquisition but improved retention (Experiment 1). Injection of glycine immediately following training or just prior to retrieval reinstated normal mnemonic function in TC/LEC animals, whereas glycine given midway between learning and retention had no such effect (Experiment 2). A potential mnemonic model function of TC/LEC lesion is suggested, and possible beneficial effects of glycine on patients with Alzheimer's disease are discussed.", 
    "18": "Employing a randomized study design, the intra- and post-operative effects of three sedative agents were compared in 30 female patients under regional anaesthesia for lower abdominal surgery. After establishing epidural blockade to a level of T4, 10 patients were sedated with propofol 2.79 +/- 0.4 mg kg-1 h-1, 10 with midazolam 0.08 +/- 0.01 mg kg-1 h-1, and a further 10 patients with methohexitone 1.8 +/- 0.2 mg kg-1 h-1 (mean dose +/- SEM). An additional 10 patients did not receive any sedative agent and served as a control group. There was excellent haemodynamic stability in all groups. They were comparable with respect to respiratory rate, SpO2, and PaCO2. Testing of vigilance showed significant differences between peri-operative and baseline scores and those found in the recovery room in all three groups with intra-operative sedation; in the midazolam group vigilance was still impaired the day following surgery. There were significant differences in the post-operative vigilance scores between patients sedated during surgery and the control group; in the methohexitone group even 24 h later. The ability to concentrate was particularly impaired in patients treated with methohexitone. Patients treated with midazolam or methohexitone needed longer to recall their date of birth than those sedated with propofol.", 
    "19": "Regional anaesthesia for abdominal hysterectomy is commonly combined with heavy sedation or light general anaesthesia in order to avoid the occurrence of visceral pain. Our clinical experience has indicated that this pain can be controlled using regional anaesthesia techniques alone. In an effort to find the optimal technique, we randomly assigned 200 ASA and I and II patients who requested regional anaesthesia for abdominal hysterectomy (with or without elective appendicectomy) to one of five groups: 1) subarachnoid bupivacaine; 2) subarachnoid bupivacaine plus intravenous midazolam and buprenorphine; 3) epidural bipivacaine; 4) epidural bupivacaine plus epidural morphine; 5) subarachnoid bupivacaine plus epidural morphine and bupivacaine. The last combination provided by far the best analgesia. Only two of 40 patients complained of slight discomfort, and this was easily controlled. Success rates correlated also with the height of the blockade. It was concluded that the combination of subarachnoid bupivacaine plus epidural morphine and bupivacaine represents an effective and reliable technique for abdominal hysterectomy with or without elective appendicectomy.", 
    "20": "Among 45 patients with cryptogenic West Syndrome (WS) we report 30 with a favorable outcome consisting of normal psychomotor development and cessation of epilepsy with at least 2 years follow-up (mean 4 years 7 months). These favorable patients could be recognized from onset by (a) absence of significant mental regression with a preserved visual function; (b) absence of focal interictal EEG abnormalities after intravenous diazepam; and (c) reappearance of hypsarrhythmia between consecutive spasms of a cluster. The latter criterion requires EEG recording of a series of spasms. The favorable outcome in these patients suggests that they had no cortical brain lesions. This new type of idiopathic epilepsy referred to as idiopathic West syndrome has important prognostic, therapeutic, and etiologic implications.", 
    "21": "A case report of dramatic increases in serum digoxin levels after alprazolam administration prompted our investigation. Twelve inpatients receiving long-term digoxin (0.25 mg daily) randomly received oral administration of either 1.0 or 0.5 mg alprazolam per day for 7 days. In each dosage group, three patients were older than and three were younger than 65 years of age. The area under the concentration-time curve for serum digoxin increased significantly in patients receiving 1 mg alprazolam daily, and this increase was more pronounced in patients older than 65 years of age. Clinical digoxin toxicity developed in one elderly patient who was receiving 1 mg/day alprazolam.", 
    "22": "Midazolam is used frequently as an oral premedication in children. To make it more palatable, it is often mixed in various syrups and solutions. No previous studies have documented the stability of midazolam when mixed in these solutions. Using high-pressure liquid chromatography, we assayed midazolam concentrations over time when mixed at two different concentrations (2.5 mg/mL and 3.0 mg/mL) in a sucrose-based syrup (Simple Syrup, NF). Each assay was done in triplicate on three different days (days 1, 14, and 38). Solution A concentrations (2.5 mg/mL) were 2.28 mg/mL on day 1, mg/mL) were 2.82 mg/mL on day 1, 2.91 mg/mL on day 14, and 2.24 mg/mL on day 38.

    "37": "The combination of fentanyl and diazepam significantly decreases systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure. We attempted to elucidate the reason the combination of these drugs can reduce blood pressure. In alpha-chloralose-anesthetized dogs, we investigated the effects of fentanyl and diazepam on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and arterial baroreflex control of renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) in both intact (Study 1) and baroreflex-denervated dogs (Study 2). Study 1 included five dogs that received fentanyl 10 micrograms/kg followed by diazepam 0.4 mg/kg after a 10-min interval. Five more received both drugs in reversed sequence. The arterial baroreflex depressor test was performed with sodium nitroprusside before and after administration of each drug. Sensitivity of arterial baroreflex was examined by using the ratio of maximum increase of RSNA to maximum decrease of MAP (delta RSNA/delta MAP). RSNA and MAP significantly decreased only after both drugs had been administered (P < 0.05). Fentanyl alone did not attenuate arterial baroreflex sensitivity. Diazepam after fentanyl and diazepam alone attenuated baroreflex sensitivity to the same extent (P < 0.05). Study 2 comprised 14 dogs that underwent further surgical preparation of bilateral carotid sinus, aortic, and vagal nerve denervations. Seven received fentanyl, 5 and 10 micrograms/kg, and the other seven received diazepam, a total of 0.4 mg/kg. Fentanyl decreased both RSNA and MAP. Diazepam decreased only MAP significantly. The results indicate that fentanyl decreases mainly sympathetic outflow, whereas diazepam attenuates arterial baroreflex. We conclude that these combined effects of fentanyl and diazepam significantly decrease arterial blood pressure.", 
    "38": "To determine whether needle polarity significantly affects nerve stimulation during peripheral nerve block, we performed a randomized double-blinded study of 10 patients undergoing axillary block for upper extremity surgery. Using an insulated needle, we determined the minimum current necessary to elicit muscle contraction with positive and negative needle polarity at two needle placements: (A) where stimulation was first observed and (B) where stimulation was maximal. At Position A, stimulation required significantly more current when the needle was positive (2.32 +/- 0.45 mA, mean +/- SEM) than when it was negative (1.05 +/- 0.23 mA, P < 0.001). Similarly, at Position B, stimulation required more current when the needle was positive (1.49 +/- 0.49 mA) than when it was negative (0.47 +/- 0.15 mA, P < 0.001). The mean ratio of positive to negative threshold stimulation current at Position B (3.11 +/- 0.20) was significantly greater than that at Position A (2.37 +/- 0.19, P < 0.05). Our results emphasize the importance of attaching the negative terminal of the nerve stimulator to the stimulating electrode. Use of the positive terminal could lead to abandoning a block if stimulation were not obtained at a low enough current; alternatively, motor contraction might not be observed before neural contact or vascular puncture.",

The patients' levels were measured again after a 30-day course of alprazolam therapy, 1.5 mg/day. The CCK-8 concentrations were significantly lower in the patients than in the control subjects and did not change after alprazolam therapy. There was no correlation between the peptide values and levels of anxiety or frequency and severity of panic attacks.", 
    "40": "Although a high prevalence of adjustment disorders and anticipatory nausea secondary to adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) has been reported, little has been done to develop strategies to prevent these problems. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was therefore designed to assess the usefulness of adding low-dose alprazolam (0.5 mg to 2 mg per day) to a psychologic support program including progressive relaxation training designed to prevent the aforementioned conditions. Fifty-seven women undergoing adjuvant CT for stage II primary breast cancer agreed to participate in the assessment, which was conducted at four time points: before starting CT, 6 weeks after CT, before the fourth CT, and after the fourth CT. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAS), Revised Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R), Morrow Assessment of Nausea and Emesis (MANE), and World Health Organization (WHO) grading of acute and subacute toxicities were used to compare the alprazolam (AA) and placebo (PA) arms of the study.",

Anxiety and depression scores of self- and observer-report were similar in the two arms. A significant relationship was found between the development of anticipatory nausea and the self-report of anxiety and depression score measured by HADS at baseline.

    "43": "Prenatal exposure to diazepam leads to a suppression of mitogen or allogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation as well as to a reduced production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha from rat splenocytes during postnatal development of rats. We analysed the secretion of interleukin (IL)-6 which occurs at a later stage of the cytokine cascade. Splenocytes of male offspring from Long Evans rats, treated with a daily dose of diazepam (1.25 mg/kg) from gestational day 14 to 20, were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and concanavalin A (Con A). In response to LPS, IL-6 liberation was significantly lower in mixed splenocytes and spleen macrophages of 2 and 8 week old prenatally diazepam-treated rats than in controls. Spleen lymphocyte preparations of prenatally treated animals exhibited a reduction of IL-6 release at 12 h and an increase at 24 h of incubation. At 2 weeks of age, Con A-induced IL-6 production could only be detected in mixed splenocytes; prenatally treated rats were releasing significantly less IL-6 than controls. In 8 week old rats, IL-6 liberation from mixed splenocytes and spleen macrophages was significantly lower in prenatally treated animals than in controls. Spleen lymphocytes presented a complex response picture depending upon incubation conditions. Our data indicate that in prenatally diazepam-exposed rats, the disturbance of cytokine release also extends to cytokines which play an important role in the later phases of immune responses.", 
    "44": "Neurochemical studies showed that indomethacin is a noncompetitive inhibitor of the mouse cortical synaptosomal uptake of [3H]GABA with a Ki of 0.7 mM. Indomethacin also displaced [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]GABA binding to washed cortical membranes in a competitive manner with IC50 values of 0.18 and 0.55 mM, respectively. It binds to the benzodiazepine receptors with the same characteristics as an inverse agonist and to the GABAA receptors as an antagonist. Behavioral studies showed that indomethacin dose-dependently increased the durations of loss of righting reflex induced by either diazepam or pentobarbitone, decreased rota-rod treading times and effectively prevented generalized seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole, bicuculline, methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate or maximal electroshock treatment. It is concluded that these effects of indomethacin are probably a result of GABA uptake inhibition. The present findings may explain some side effects of indomethacin on the central nervous system, such as impairment of psychomotor functions.", 
    "45": "Pharmacology can contribute in four ways to our understanding and to the management of resistant depression: 1) Dosage: some antidepressants have an inverted-U dose-response curve, i.e. the response disappears when dosage is increased. In man, dose-response relationships are not well established because the curves are obtained with groups of patients and they reflect an overall mean rather than the reality of each individual patient. 2) Secondary regulatory adaptive mechanism such as: down regulation of beta, 5-HT2, alpha-2 receptors--increased reactivity of 5-HT1A, alpha-1 and dopaminergic systems. Defective development of these mechanisms is thought to originate resistance in certain cases, which could therefore be corrected more or less specifically by adding thyroid hormone, lithium, an alpha-2 agonist or even by switching to a 5-HT1A agonist or a dopaminergic drug. 3) Biological resistance factors: it has been shown in the rat that hypothyroidism, diabetes, weight loss cause a decrease in beta-adrenergic system reactivity, and therefore a resistance to noradrenergic antidepressants. 4) Co-prescription: the efficacy of noradrenergic antidepressants is known to involve the activation of beta-adrenergic receptors. Animal studies have shown that the co-prescription of a beta-blocker nullifies this efficacy. Benzodiazepines decrease serotonergic and noradrenergic neuronal activity: animal studies have shown that they antagonize most antidepressants. What happens in depressed humans who are often co-prescribed these drugs? I would like to share with you a few data from experimental pharmacology which may help us to think differently, not when faced to a patient with resistant depression, but when confronted with the failure of a well conducted antidepressant treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "46": "Medifoxamine (Cl\u00e9dial TM), a non tricyclic non MAOI antidepressant drug with a dopaminergic and serotoninergic mechanism of action, was compared to imipramine in a multicenter double blind trial. Patients suffering from DSM III-R major depression (without psychotic features), with a minimum inclusion score of 25 at the MADRS after an initial 7-day wash-out period, were randomly assigned to a 4-week treatment by either imipramine or medifoxamine, with flexible doses of at least 100 mg after 2 weeks of treatment. No associated treatment was permitted except for lorazepam 2 to 5 mg per day. Ninety eight patients were recruited by 20 centers throughout France. Eighty four terminated the 4-week protocol. Early terminations were due to serious adverse events (3), death on imipramine (1), protocol violation (1), refusal to continue (1), loss to follow up (1). The 2 groups of patients were comparable on inclusion. In the medifoxamine group (receiving a daily dose of 194 mg at day 28) the percentage of improvement in MADRS scores, the number of patients with a MADRS improvement of a least 50% and a final MADRS score inferior to 8, were not significantly different from the imipramine group (daily dose: 161 mg at day 28). No more difference appeared when several clinical variables were analyzed, in particular the DSM III-R melancholic, the Newcastle endogenous subtypes and the in or out patient status. The two treatment groups were also comparable on other scales (HDRS, HARS assessing anxiety, CGI).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "47": "Shortage of capacity, and the limited range of therapies available for dental treatment of uncooperative children involve obvious problems which have given rise to new developments in treatment. Over the last two years, 83 children have been treated in 181 sessions after sedation with Midazolam. Rectal application is clearly superior to giving the drug orally. The results, and the good amnestic effect of Midazolam show that sedation employing this drug, while not a substitute for general anaesthesia in every case, does constitute an important alternative in the treatment of uncooperative children.", 
    "48": "This paper reviews the issue of sedation in pediatric dentistry in the light of recent controversies and rapidly increasing legal, professional and governmental regulations. Consideration is given to \"Guidelines for safe administration of pharmacologic agents in dental practice\". The various avenues of drug administration are reviewed with specific comment on recent approaches. Many of the older pharmacologic agents used for pediatric sedation are falling into disfavor. Chloral hydrate, in particular, would seem to be heading toward its demise. The benzodiazepines appear to have a very promising future as sedative agents. When administered and monitored appropriately, they have a wide margin of safety. Consideration is given to research and development into agents that reverse the action of sedative drugs. It is emphasized that contemporary electronic monitoring equipment in no way diminishes the necessity for sound and expert clinical judgment, supplemented by such simple devices as the precordial stethoscope and observation and communication in the form of simple commands.",

    "51": "The use of graded infusion of dalargin (a home-made synthetic analogue of leu-enkephalin) in a complex of anesthesiological protection has been analysed in patients with radical correction of tetralogy of Fallot and atrial septal defect. It has been shown that delargin has a pulmonoprotective effect, moreover, it is supposed to possess a certain analgetic activity. Dalargin reduces total pulmonary resistance, the normalizing effect of the drug on the vascular tone and the degree of pulmonoprotecive action being higher in cases when the preceding pathological shifts were more pronounced. The author believes it is indicated to apply the drug in a complex of anesthesiological protection during radical correction of tetralogy of Fallot and atrial septal defect primarily to ensure intraoperative pulmonoprotection and optimization of the vascular tone in the pulmonary artery.", 
    "52": "Pharmacoepidemiologic data have shown a consistent reduction in benzodiazepine (BZ) prescriptions over the past decade. The question remains as to whether BZs are simply put aside or whether other medications are used as substitutes. Expert interviews, at which a stratified sample of 114 psychiatrists, internists, and general practitioners were presented with case studies, were conducted to learn about the therapeutic alternatives in the field of benzodiazepine-related indications administered in daily practice. These results were used to analyze trends in pharmacoepidemiologic prescription data for all patients under the general health insurance plan from 1981 to 1988. The experts identified distinct alternatives to BZs in different clinical situations, including neuroleptics, antidepressants, phototherapeutics, and analgesics. When these findings were transferred to pharmacoepidemiologic data, results revealed an increase in the prescription of alternative medications that apparently compensated for reduced BZ use. Overall there was no change (or, rather, no increase) in the total of psychotropic prescriptions during the period of reduced BZ prescriptions. Our findings indicate that reduction in benzodiazepines prescription is associated with substitution by various other psychotropic drugs. This has positive as well as negative consequences, and there must be discussed in detail before sound recommendations can be given as to which type of drug. BZs included, is the best choice in which type of illness.", 
    "53": "The effects of diazepam (DZ, 4 mg/kg), alprazolam (ALP, 1.25 mg/kg) and adinazolam (ADIN, 6 mg/kg), as well as their interaction with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (Ro15-1788), were studied on the early acquisition of two-way active (shuttlebox) avoidance in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The three benzodiazepines increased shuttlebox avoidance acquisition, and their effects were prevented (antagonized) by flumazenil (10 mg/kg). The present results indicate that central benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors are involved in the anxiolytic effects of diazepam and triazolobenzodiazepines on the early acquisition of two-way active avoidance.", 
    "54": "The effect of a treatment with L-triiodothyronine (T3) or propylthiouracil (PTU) on the characteristics of benzodiazepine and chloride ion channel binding sites in rat hippocampus and cerebral cortex was studied using a radiolabelled technique. In our experimental conditions, neither hyper- nor hypothyroidism modified number and affinity of [3H]flunitrazepam or [3H]butylbicycloorthobenzoate (TBOB) binding sites. These data indicate that neither benzodiazepine nor chloride ionophore sites of the GABA complex are modified in an experimental condition of dysthyroidism.", 
    "55": "We have investigated the intracellular mechanisms underlying thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-mediated [3H]dopamine ([3H]DA) release from dispersed rat tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TIDA) neurons. The specific binding of [3H]Me-TRH to these cells is characterized by a single, high-affinity binding site (Kd = 1.2 nM) with a Bmax value of 178 fmol/mg protein. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone markedly increased [3H]DA release and intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in TIDA neurons, and its effect was abolished by treatment with EGTA (5 mM) or chlordiazepoxide, a specific TRH receptor antagonist (10 microM). Furthermore, to examine the involvement of protein kinase C on [3H]DA release, we investigated the effect of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), which is known to activate protein kinase C directly. Phorbol myristate acetate induced a significant increase in [3H]DA release in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment with TRH (1 microM) plus PMA (100 nM) resulted in an additive increase in [3H]DA release. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (1 microM) still increased [3H]DA release even after preincubation with PMA (500 nM) for 24 h, but PMA (100 nM) did not under the same conditions. These results suggest that TRH may induce DA release in dispersed rat TIDA cells by increasing calcium influx and activating the protein kinase C system.", 
    "56": "It is unclear whether stimulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion by intravenously administered bombesin is a direct effect on acinar cells or is mediated by release of CCK; this distinction is important for defining the potential role of bombesin-like peptides as regulators of pancreatic secretion. The role of CCK in bombesin-induced pancreatic secretion was examined in rats using CCK radioimmunoassay and the CCK receptor antagonist L-364,718. A biphasic pancreatic response occurred to sequential doubling doses of bombesin (31 to 2000 pmol/kg/h, each for 30 min; n = 9 rats); amylase secretion increased to peak at 250 pmol/kg/h (11.5 +/- 1.7 kU/30 min; 4.2 +/- 0.6 kU/30 min, basal) and then declined to basal levels at 2000 pmol/kg/h. The ED50 dose of bombesin for stimulation was 31 pmol/kg/h, and the maximal response did not differ significantly from that to exogenous CCK-8 (10.6 +/- 1.5 kU/30 min) in the same rats. When single doses of bombesin were infused for 2 h (31, 62, 125, 250 pmol/kg/h; one dose per day; order randomized; n = 8), a similar dose-response relationship was seen, both for peak amylase response and cumulative output over basal. L-364,718 (0.5 mg/kg IV) had no effect on the pancreatic response to ED50 or maximal doses of bombesin. Neither dose of bombesin altered plasma CCK levels. In contrast, other stimulants of pancreatic secretion (food ingestion, soybean trypsin inhibitor) caused marked elevations in plasma CCK levels. These results indicate that the potent stimulation of pancreatic secretion by exogenous bombesin in rats is not mediated by CCK, similar to findings in humans.", 
    "57": "The receptor for GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, has been classified into GABAA and GABAB types. The GABAA receptor was purified by means of affinity column chromatography using benzodiazepine as an immobilized ligand. The results indicated that the GABAA receptor consists of several subunits and forms a GABA-gated Cl- channel, which is coupled with the benzodiazepine receptor. The molecular weight of the GABAA receptor complex was estimated to be approximately 300 kDa. Furthermore, cDNA cloning of GABAA receptor subunits was performed and the primary structure of these subunits was deduced. The results suggested that these subunits possess four transmembrane domains in their structure which are important for the formation of the Cl- channel. On the other hand, activation of GABAB receptors induced the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity and phosphatidylinositol turnover via inhibitory GTP-binding proteins such as G(i) and/or G(o). The GABAB receptor was purified using baclofen affinity and immunoaffinity column chromatographies. It was confirmed that the purified GABAB receptor protein is about 80 kDa in its molecular weight. This protein is capable of inducing the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase when it is reconstituted with G(i)/G(o) protein in the phospholipid vesicle system. Currently available data indicate that GABAA and GABAB receptors in the central nervous system are distinct not only in terms of their molecules but also their signal transduction systems. However, the primary structure and synaptic localization of GABAB receptor molecules in the brain remain to be clarified.", 
    "58": "1. In the present study, adenosine modulation on the antinociceptive action of benzodiazepines (BZD) using the writhing test in mice was evaluated. 2. The i.c.v. BZDs tested (diazepam, midazolam and lorazepam) induced a dose-dependent antinociceptive action, that was not antagonized either by naloxone or by aminophylline. 3. The i.p. administration of adenosine-related compounds also produced a dose-dependent reduction in the number of writhings in mice. These effects were not antagonized by i.p. injection of naloxone but were antagonized by i.p. aminophylline. 4. The antinociceptive effect of BZDs was significantly enhanced by the administration of adenosine compounds, but this increased response was not modified by naloxone or by aminophylline. 5. The present findings could be explained by the fact that BZDs and adenosine-related compounds may interact in an additive manner, since the effects of these drugs may be due to a common mechanism of action or a common pathway.", 
    "59": "1. The behavioural and anticonvulsant effects of several thiazolo[3,2-d][1,4]benzodiazepines (TBZ) were studied after intraperitoneal administration in DBA/2 mice, a strain genetically susceptible to sound-induced seizures. 2. Anticonvulsant effects on seizures evoked by means of auditory stimulation (109 dB, 12-16 kHz) were evaluated in DBA/2 mice placed singly under a perspex dome. 3. Hypothermic activity was observed after the highest doses of the benzodiazepines studied. 4. In addition, some TBZ were examined for anticonvulsant properties with respect to clonus induced by pentylenetetrazol. 5. Our study demonstrated that some thiazolobenzodiazepine derivatives were more potent than clobazam, desmethylclobazam and chlordiazepoxide, and less potent than diazepam, desmethyldiazepam and alprazolam. 6. In the series of tricyclic benzodiazepines, thiazole nucleus fusion to the \"d\" edge of the 7-membered ring results in an effective increase of the energy barrier for the heptatomic system reversal, and is probably responsible for, jointly with the lack of C=N double bonds, lower activity with respect to the 1,4-benzodiazepine precursors. 7. The potency of various thiazolobenzodiazepine derivatives as inhibitors of specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding to membranes from cerebellum or hippocampus was evaluated. 8. All tested compounds produced concentration-dependent inhibition of [3H]flunitrazepam binding. 9. The pharmacological activity of TBZ2, the most active compound of this series, was significantly reduced by treatment with flumazenil (2.5 mg/kg i.p.), suggesting clear involvement of a benzodiazepine mechanism in the anticonvulsant activity of these compounds.", 
    "60": "Some aspects of the GABA and cholinergic systems have been investigated in the cortex and thalamus of GAERS Wistar rats, a model of petit-mal epilepsy, and in a non-epileptic control strain. GABA and its synthetic enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), were located by immunocytochemistry; the GABAA receptors were evaluated by autoradiography of GABA-enhanced 3H-flunitrazepam binding and by immunocytochemistry using specific antibodies against the beta 2-beta 3 subunits of GABAA receptor protein. GABA and GAD immunocytochemistry did not show up any difference in density or distribution of immunoreactive elements (fibers, terminals and neurons) between epileptic and control animals, but autoradiographic and immunocytochemical studies showed a decreased enhancement of 3H-flunitrazepam binding and of beta 2-beta 3 subunits of GABAA receptor in the sensorimotor cortex and anterior thalamic areas of the epileptic strain. No differences were found in benzodiazepine receptors in the two strains. GABAB receptors were measured as 3H-baclofen binding in a crude synaptic membrane preparation and there was no difference between epileptic and control animals. Choline acetyltransferase, the synthetic enzyme for acetylcholine, and muscarinic receptor subtypes (M1 and M2), visualized respectively by an immunocytochemical procedure and binding autoradiography, did not differ in epileptic and normal rats. The data suggest an impairment of the 'GABAA system' in restricted brain regions of epileptic rats, due to a reduction of receptor beta 2-beta 3 subunits and coupling to benzodiazepine receptors despite the normal synthesis and location of the neurotransmitter.", 
    "61": "Previous studies have shown that CCK-8 has distinct antiopioid effect in the central sites related with pain control and blood pressure control. The aim of this study was to explore the receptor mechanism by which CCK-8 antagonized the depressor effect of u- and k-opioid agonists, and to observe whether CCK-8 could antagonize the depressor effect induced by muscimol, a nonopioid substance. The results showed that (i) The antagonistic effect of CCK-8 on opioid-induced hypotension could be blocked by intrathecal (i. t.) administration of CCK-B antagonist L-365, 260 at nanogram doses, or by CCK-A antagonist devazepide at doses 20-40 times higher than L-365, 260, indicating that it was the CCK-B receptor which mediates the antiopioid effect. (ii) The depressor effect induced by intrathecal muscimol, a GABA agonist, was blocked neither by naloxone nor by CCK-8, supporting the notion that CCK-8 is an endogenous opioid antagonist rather than a universal anti-hypotension agent.", 
    "62": "Post-training administration of the acetylcholine muscarinic M2 presynaptic receptor antagonist AF-DX 116 (0.1-10.0 mg/kg, ip), facilitated 48 h retention, in male Swiss mice, of a one-trial step-through inhibitory avoidance task. The dose-response curve was an inverted U. AF-DX 116 did not increase the retention latencies of mice that had not received a footshock during training. The influence of AF-DX 116 (1 mg/kg, ip) on retention was time-dependent, which suggests that the drug facilitated memory storage. The memory facilitation induced by AF-DX 116 (1 mg/kg, ip) was prevented by atropine (0.5 mg/kg, ip) administered after training, but 10 min prior to AF-DX 116 treatment. In contrast, neither methylatropine (0.5 mg/kg, ip), a peripherally acting muscarinic receptor blocker, nor mecamylamine (5 mg/kg, ip) or hexamethonium (5 mg/kg, ip), two cholinergic nicotinic receptor antagonists, prevented the effects of post-training AF-DX 116 on retention. Low subeffective doses of the central acting anticholinesterase physostigmine (35 micrograms/kg, ip), administered immediately after training, and AF-DX 116 (0.1 mg/kg, ip), given 10 min after training, acted synergistically to improve retention. The effects of AF-DX 116 (0.1 mg/kg, ip) were not influenced by the peripherally acting anticholinesterase neostigmine (35 micrograms/kg, ip). Considered together, these findings suggest that the activation of a muscarinic cholinergic presynaptic inhibitory mechanism, probably by increasing brain acetylcholine release, may modulate the activity of post-training processes involved in memory storage.", 
    "63": "This experiment investigated the effect of intra-amygdala administration of the GABAergic antagonist bicuculline methiodide on benzodiazepine-induced amnesia. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted bilaterally with cannulae aimed at the amygdala and allowed to recover for 1 week. Ten minutes before training in a continuous multiple trial inhibitory avoidance task a buffer solution or bicuculline methiodide (56 pmol/0.5 microliters) was injected bilaterally into the amygdala and this injection was immediately followed by a systemic injection of saline or midazolam (1.0 mg/kg). In comparison with saline controls, midazolam-treated animals required more trials to reach the acquisition criterion of remaining in the starting chamber for 100 s. The midazolam effect on acquisition was not attenuated by intra-amygdala infusion of bicuculline methiodide, suggesting that the midazolam-induced changes in acquisition behavior do not involve the amygdaloid GABAergic system. On a 48-h retention test the performance of the midazolam-treated animals was significantly poorer than that of the controls. However, the retention performance of animals given intra-amygdala injections of bicuculline methiodide prior to the systemic injection of midazolam was comparable to that of the saline controls. These results suggest that the amygdaloid GABAergic system mediates the impairing effects of midazolam on retention of inhibitory avoidance training.", 
    "64": "The effects of diazepam on rat renal function were investigated by means of clearance techniques in conscious animals. Different intravenous doses of diazepam were tested: 0.1, 0.3 and 10 mg/Kg body weight A marked increase in fractional water, sodium and potassium excretion was found in every group studied. This alteration was associated with a urine-to-plasma osmolality ratio diminution. On the other hand, no modifications in glomerular filtration rate or p-aminohippuric acid clearance were observed. The reabsorption of water in collecting tubule in diazepam treated rats was decreased as compared with control rats. To assess diazepam-effects on collecting tubule response to vasopressin, the effects of desmopressin on concentrating ability in control and diazepam-treated rats were tested. Desmopressin-treatment promoted a significantly lower free water reabsorption in diazepam-treated group as referred to control rats. This results indicate that diazepam may promote impairments on renal tubular ions reabsorption and that it modifies the collecting tubule response to desmopressin.", 
    "65": "The purpose of our trial was to assess the arterial blood gases changes, during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGE), among subjects younger than sixty years without cardiopulmonary disorders or smoking habits, with or without sedation with i.v. midazolam. After informed consent, sixty five patients (29 males and 36 females), whose ages ranged between 16 and 59 years (average 37.5 years) were randomly assigned to two groups (I and II) of 40 and 25 patients, respectively. Group I, underwent UGE without sedation and arterial blood gases from a right radial arterial sample were determined before and during the procedure. Group II underwent UGE with sedation and arterial blood gases from a right radial arterial sample were determined, before sedation, after sedation with i.v. midazolam at a dosage of 0.05 mg/kg, and during the procedure. In group I 55% of patients showed hypoxemia: PO2 decreased 10 mmhg (mean) and oxygen saturation in 1.45%. In group II, 64% of patients showed hypoxemia after sedation, and before UGE, the decrease being even more notorious during the procedure. The PO2 decreased 18.8 mmhg (mean) and oxygen saturation in 3.3% (p 0.001). In both groups no significative changes in PCO2,pH or respiratory rate were observed. However the depth of thorax respiratory expansion was clinically decreased in 70% of patients of group II. We concluded that hypoxaemia occurred during UGE, in previously asymptomatic, middle-age, non smokers patient, without history of cardiac or pulmonary disease. Major changes were observed in subjects sedated with midazolam (p 0.001).", 
    "66": "A total of 212 patients undergoing elective upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were prospectively studied. They were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: (I) sedation with no supplemental oxygen; (II) no sedation and no oxygen supplementation; (III) sedation and supplemental oxygen; and (IV) no sedation but supplemental oxygen. Oxygen desaturation occurred in all the groups except group IV and was worsened by sedation. Supplemental oxygen corrected the desaturation in the sedated patients and minimized the associated haemodynamic changes. The duration of the endoscopy procedure was shortest in patients who were sedated and given supplemental oxygen. It can be concluded that during conscious sedation for upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy, supplemental oxygen should be given and continued during the postendoscopy period to prevent oxygen desaturation.", 
    "67": "Examining the effects of phenazepam and phenobarbital on the course of pregnancy and the development of offsprings has revealed that phenobarbital that has an embryotoxic effect reduced the number of rat offsprings and diminished their weight, but failed to affect the behavioral responses of newborn rats. On the contrary, phenazepam had no embryotoxic effect, but on entering the newborn rats' organism with milk it inhibited some behavioral reactions in the early postnatal period.", 
    "68": "This experiment investigated the amnestic effects of injections of the benzodiazepine midazolam administered into the amygdala prior to training on an inhibitory avoidance task. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted bilaterally with cannulae aimed at the amygdala. After 1 week recovery a buffer solution or midazolam (3 or 10 micrograms/0.5 microliters) was injected bilaterally 5 min before a single training trail in a two-compartment inhibitory avoidance apparatus. The pretraining intra-amygdala injections of midazolam did not affect the training step-through latencies. However, on a 48-h retention test the step-through latencies of the midazolam-treated animals were significantly lower than those of the buffer controls. These findings are consistent with other recent evidence indicating that the amygdala is involved in mediating the amnestic effects of benzodiazepines.", 
    "69": "A sample of 600 patients treated in a multimodal treatment program using aversion therapy and narcotherapy at three Schick freestanding addiction treatment hospitals and one Schick unit in a general hospital were followed-up. Contact was made a minimum of 12 months and as many as 20 months after completion of treatment (mean 14.7 mos.). Telephone contact was made by an independent research organization with 427 of the patients (71.2%). Of these, 65.1% were totally abstinent for 1 year after treatment and 60.2% were abstinent until follow-up a mean of 14.7 months later. Fifty-two percent of the alcoholics were using or dependent on other drugs at admission. Seventy-five of these treated for cocaine dependence and 47 treated for marijuana dependence. The cocaine 12 month and \"total\" abstinence (mean 14.7 mos.) rates for the 49 contacted patients were 83.7% and 81.6%, respectively. The marijuana 12 month and \"total\" abstinence (mean 14.7 mos.) rates for the 30 contacted patients was 70.0% for both groups. Abstinence rates for alcohol and/or other drugs were also calculated including noncontacted patients who had chart documented evidence of relapse. The most powerful predictor of success was whether or not all urges to drink or use had been eliminated (presumably by aversion therapy). Of additional importance was the use of support groups and reinforcement treatments after completion of the initial hospitalization. The two most prominent factors initiating a relapse were \"intrapersonal determinants\" such as stress from work or marriage/family relationships and \"interpersonal determinants\" such as being around others who were drinking/using or being at a celebration or special event. The two factors were of equal importance in the alcoholics. However, interpersonal determinants were far more important in the cocaine and marijuana treated patients. Increased utilization of reinforcement treatments was associated with decreased urges to drink/use and increased abstinence rates. In contrast, increased frequency of support group utilization was associated with increased urges to drink/use and lower abstinence rates. This suggests the need to take seriously patient reports of \"urges\" in the first year after treatment and to carefully assess the cause and initiate or update an individualized plan of treatment. Such treatment may include increased reinforcement treatments, treatment of depression, and additional assistance in coping with intrapersonal and interpersonal determinants of relapse.", 
    "70": "We have investigated the possible influence of time of day on the activity of flumazenil on lignocaine-induced toxicity in mice. The circadian pattern of the period of latency for convulsions and the induced mortality for lignocaine alone and for lignocaine plus flumazenil was not statistically significant (cosinor or analysis of variance) but the influence of flumazenil on lignocaine-induced toxicity was circadian-time dependent (F = 27.8, P = 0.0001).", 
    "71": "The addition of benzodiazepine hypnotics to a treatment with tricyclic antidepressants has received little systematic study. In a double-blind placebo-controlled design, the effects on mood and on sleep of two benzodiazepine hypnotics (lormetazepam and flunitrazepam) were studied in patients with major depression who were also treated with maprotiline or nortriptyline. After 4 weeks of combined treatment, lormetazepam resulted in a significantly greater decrease in the score on the Hamilton Depression Subscale than placebo, while there was a non-significant trend in favour of lormetazepam in comparison with flunitrazepam. With respect to sleep EEGs, lormetazepam resulted in a significantly greater suppression of REM sleep. The differences between lormetazepam and flunitrazepam may be partly explained by the shorter half-live of lormetazepam.", 
    "72": "In a controlled study a single segment combined spinal epidural (CSE) block was compared with spinal or epidural block for major orthopaedic surgery. Seventy-five patients, age 52-86 yr, were randomly assigned to receive one of the three blocks. Bupivacaine 0.5% was used for surgical analgesia. The postoperative pain relief after 4.0 mg epidural morphine was compared with the analgesic effect of 0.2 or 0.4 mg morphine administered intrathecally. With the spinal technique good or excellent surgical analgesia and muscle relaxation were achieved rapidly (11.8 +/- 1.1 min). The time taken to provide an equally effective and reliable block with the CSE technique was no longer (14.9 +/- 2.2 min). For epidural block with the catheter technique more time was required (35.9 +/- 3.9 min) to provide acceptable surgical conditions (P < 0.05). Perioperative sedatives and concomitant analgesics were required more frequently and in larger doses by the patients undergoing surgery with epidural block (P < 0.05) than with CSE or spinal block. Our study demonstrated that the analgesia after surgery provided by 0.2 and 0.4 mg morphine administered intrathecally was comparable to that provided by 4.0 mg of epidural morphine. It is concluded that the analgesia and surgical conditions provided by the spinal and CSE blocks were similar and were superior to those provided by an epidural block.",

In chemical assays it was a highly specific inhibitor of serotonin (5-HT2) binding, and it was active in preliminary preclinical assays of anxiolytic potential. This multicenter trial of CGS-15040A in patients with generalized anxiety disorder demonstrated clinical anxiolytic effects consistent with established preclinical effects. Doses greater than or equal to 10 mg reduced Hamilton Anxiety Scale scores. However, the dose-response relationship was nonlinear. Effects appeared primarily related to the psychic components of anxiety.", 
    "75": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a neurotransmitter found in high density in the brains of mammals. Microiontophoretic studies showing that benzodiazepines selectively antagonized CCK-induced excitation of rat hippocampal neurons have led to the hypothesis that CCK is an anxiogenic peptide. The hypothesis was supported by demonstrations that CCK-tetrapeptide (CCK4) induces panic attacks in humans. This paper reviews phases of investigations which studied the validity of CCK4 as a panicogenic agent and research strategies for the study of panic disorder using CCK4 as an investigative tool.", 
    "76": "Neuroleptic-induced akathisia is a relatively common side effect of neuroleptic medication, characterized by a subjective sense of restlessness and the inability to sit still. It has been associated with aggression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and suicide among patients who have mental illness. These side effects are fairly well-researched in the psychiatric literature but rarely addressed in the mental retardation literature. The prevalence, types of akathisia, differential diagnosis, and treatment were reviewed and a relevant case report presented. The importance of the diagnosis and treatment of neuroleptic-induced akathisia in individuals with mental retardation was discussed.", 
    "77": "The 'designer drug' 3,4-methylenedioxy-metamphetamine (MDMA; 'Ecstasy'), which has become increasingly popular in the past few years, is supposed to induce a feeling of euphoria with amphetamine-like stimulant effects. It was for some time considered harmless, but neurotoxic effects on serotonergic neurons are now well documented. To supplement case reports on different drug-induced psychopathological and somatic complications published in recent literature, the case of a 21-year-old female patient is reported, who exhibited a protracted psychotic depersonalization disorder with suicidal tendency after the first intake of two tablets of \"ecstasy\". In the course of six months the symptoms remitted only gradually despite administration of a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, 'flash-backs' occurring repeatedly.", 
    "78": "1. In rabbit cerebral cortical homogenates, saturation analysis of [3H]-idazoxan, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, revealed high affinity binding to a single site with high density. Competition experiments demonstrated that the [3H]-idazoxan recognition site was insensitive to the catecholamines, adrenaline and noradrenaline and possessed a low affinity for the alpha 2- and alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, rauwolscine, yohimbine and prazosin, suggesting that the site was not an adrenoceptor. Mapping [3H]-idazoxan binding sites in the forebrain of rabbits by autoradiography, showed high densities of I2 sites in the medial preoptic area and in the stria terminalis. Moderate binding was found in caudate nucleus, putamen, cerebral cortex and hippocampus. 2. The imidazolines cirazoline, naphazoline, guanabenz and BRL44408 along with amiloride, which is structurally related to the imidazolines, all had high affinity for the [3H]-idazoxan site, suggesting that the site was related to the I2 imidazoline-recognition site described by other groups. However, the imidazolines, clonidine and UK-14,304 and the structurally related rilmenidine all had a low affinity for the binding site, showing that [3H]-idazoxan was not binding to the I1 imidazoline-recognition site found in rat, bovine and human medulla oblongata. 3. Naphazoline, guanabenz, clonidine and amiloride competition studies had Hill slopes which were significantly different from unity (P < 0.01) and computer analysis showed that the [3H]-idazoxan binding data could be best fitted to a model which considers binding to two sites (P < 0.01). One site has a high affinity for idazoxan, cirazoline, naphazoline, guanabenz and amiloride and a moderate affinity for BRL44408 and clonidine (70% of binding) and the second site (30% of binding) has a high affinity for idazoxan and cirazoline, but a lower affinity for naphazoline, guanabenz, amiloride,BRL44408 and clonidine.4. Experiments using [3H]-RX821002, in contrast to [3H]-idazoxan, clearly demonstrated the presence ofa single type of alpha2-adrenoceptor in rabbit cortex with a pharmacological profile which is similar to the alpha2A-adrenoceptor possessing a high affinity for yohimbine, rauwolscine, BRL44408 and oxymetazoline,but a lower affinity for prazosin.5. The monoamine oxidase inhibitors, clorgyline, pargyline and deprenyl had at least a ten fold lower affinity at the rabbirt cortex I2 site as compared to their known affinity at monoamine oxidase suggesting that the I2 site is not related to the active site of the enzyme, monoamine oxidase. In addition, the peripheral benzodiazepine ligands, PK-11195 or Ro 5-4864 both had very low affinities at the I2 site in rabbit cortex suggesting that the [3H]-idazoxan binding was not to the peripheral benzodiazepine binding site.", 
    "79": "We considered the increase in latency for entering into a white-lightened compartment from a black one as an index of anxiety for Swiss albino mice. This has been validated with several reference anxiogenic drugs [pentylenetetrazole, yohimbine, dexamphetamine, and methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM)]. On this test, the effects of various indirect or direct dopamine (DA) agonists have been investigated, as well as the respective involvement of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors. Dexamphetamine, the specific DA uptake inhibitor 1-[2-(diphenylmethoxy)-ethyl]4-(3-phenyl propenyl)-piperazine (GBR 12783), and the mixed DA/norepinephrine uptake inhibitor N-[1-(2-benzo(b)thiophenyl)-cyclohexyl]piperidine (GK 13) dose dependently increased the entering latency. This effect was shared by the D2 DA agonist RU 24926. The partial agonist of D1 DA receptors SK&F38393 had a significant although moderate efficacy. Their association led at best to an additive synergy. The antagonist of D1 DA receptors SCH23390 shortened the entering latency. The anxiogenic effect of GBR 12783 was antagonized by haloperidol and SCH23390. It is concluded that an anxiogenic-like effect is linked to an increase in dopaminergic transmission involving both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors.", 
    "80": "The present study was designed to characterize the antinociception produced by the administration of a potent muscarinic agonist into the intrathecal space of the lumbar spinal cord of male Sprague-Dawley rats. Seven days after surgical implantation of intrathecal catheters, animals were injected with graded doses of (+)-cis-methyldioxolane. (+)-cis-Methyldioxolane produced hot-plate and tail-flick antinociception for up to 90 min, peaking 5 to 30 min after injection. The dose of (+)-cis-methyldioxolane that inhibited nociception by 50% was 12 nmol in both the hot-plate and tail-flick tests. This antinociception was not accompanied by a general depression of other spontaneous motor responses. The tissue concentration of (+)-cis-methyl-dioxolane in the lumbar spinal cord present at the time of maximal hot-plate and tail-flick antinociception was approximately 12 microM. In similarity to (+)-cis-methyldioxolane, intrathecally administered (+)-muscarine also produced strong hot-plate and tail-flick antinociceptive responses. In contrast, intrathecally administered N-methylcarbachol, a nicotinic agonist, had no effect on nociception. Five-minute pretreatment with graded doses of pirenzepine, methoctramine, idazoxan, LY53857, or S-(-)-zacopride each significantly antagonized hot-plate and tail-flick antinociception produced by 37.5 nmol of (+)-cis-methyldioxolane in a dose-related manner with median effective antagonist doses in the range of 0.4 to 2.2 nmol. Intrathecal pretreatment with graded doses of prazosin or naloxone enhanced the antinociception produced by (+)-cis-methyldioxolane in the tail-flick but not the hot-plate tests. Intrathecal vehicle, S(-)-propranolol or mecamylamine did not alter (+)-cis-methyldioxolane-induced antinociception. The data suggest that the antinociceptive responses produced by intrathecally administered (+)-cis-methyldioxolane involve the stimulation of muscarinic M1 and/or M2 cholinergic receptors, and may also involve activation of alpha-2 adrenergic, 5-hydroxytryptamine1c/2 and 5-hydroxytryptamine3 serotonergic receptor systems at the level of the lumbar cord.", 
    "81": "Flumazenil is a central antagonist of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines. It has been used to reverse benzodiazepine effects in conscious sedation, general anesthesia, and overdose with restoration of alertness and psychomotor function within minutes of administration. Seizures have followed the use of flumazenil. Overdose patients who have co-ingested cyclic antidepressants are especially at risk for this complication. Flumazenil is administered intravenously in small, incremental doses.", 
    "82": "Alcoholism is a common disease in older patients, affecting up to 10% of those living at home and as many as 40% of those in nursing homes. Symptoms tend to be nonspecific, including \"failure to thrive,\" insomnia, diarrhea, and dementia. Morbidity and increased mortality can occur with no more than one or two drinks daily, because of altered pharmacokinetics with aging. Recognizing alcohol-induced brain injury, which can resemble Alzheimer's disease, is particularly important in the management of older patients. Withdrawal is more severe and prolonged than in younger patients and may require the judicious use of benzodiazepine therapy.", 
    "83": "Panic disorder is relatively common in older patients and may have serious consequences. The diagnosis is based on an accurate history of symptom onset and intensity. Symptoms include shortness of breath, dizziness, increased heart rate, trembling, and sweating. Effective treatment can be achieved with several kinds of medication, including benzodiazepines. Although physician and patient fears about benzodiazepines persist, panic-disordered patients with no history of drug abuse rarely develop substance dependence problems. Physical dependence occurs in a minority of patients and can be minimized by a slow tapering schedule. As with most medications, benzodiazepines need to be used with caution in older patients, who are more susceptible to adverse effects.",

    "85": "The role of these pancreatic exocrine secretagogues during electrical vagal stimulation was studied using specific inhibitors in urethane-anesthetized rats.", 
    "86": "The pancreatic secretory response to vagal stimulation was blocked significantly by each of the following: the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium (100% inhibition); the muscarinic, cholinergic blocker atropine (85% inhibition); the specific cholecystokinin A-receptor antagonist L-364,718 (84% inhibition); a gastrin-releasing peptide-receptor blocker (91% inhibition); and a vasoactive intestinal polypeptide polyclonal antibody (89% inhibition). The response was not altered by a monoclonal antibody to somatostatin. A subthreshold dose of cholecystokinin octapeptide augmented the response to electrical vagal stimulation.", 
    "87": "Suppression of tonic somatostatin release is not the final common event. The findings that subthreshold cholecystokinin augments vagal stimulation, together with marked inhibition by each antagonist used, are consistent with the hypothesis that potentiating interactions among several agonists mediate the vagal response in anesthetized rats. However, this study does not exclude acetylcholine as the final common mediator. Studies in conscious animals are needed to determine the physiological significance of these observations.", 
    "88": "Diazepam is one of the benzodiazepines, a group of drugs that depresses the central nervous system. It also inhibits the contractility of smooth muscles in the periphery, but the mechanism of this inhibitory action has not been clarified. Our study was undertaken to investigate the effect of diazepam on the contractility of the detrusor muscle. Detrusor muscle strips isolated from rat urinary bladder were examined by isometric myography. Diazepam, as well as baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)B receptor agonist, reduced the electric field stimulation-induced contractions; delta-aminovaleric acid, a GABAB receptor antagonist, completely antagonized the inhibitory effect of baclofen, but not the inhibitory action of diazepam. Diazepam reduced the basal tone of detrusor muscle concentration dependently, and this inhibitory action was not affected by tetrodotoxin. Diazepam suppressed the contractile responses to bethanechol, adenosine triphosphate and potassium chloride. Diazepam diminished the calcium-induced recovery of tension in calcium-free PSS. A23187, a calcium ionophore, partially recovered the basal tone which had been reduced by diazepam in normal physiologic salt solution (PSS). The loss of tension in calcium free PSS containing diazepam could not be recovered by addition of A23187. On the other hand, the loss of tension in calcium-free PSS containing 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid 8(diethylamino)octyl ester (TMB-8), an inhibitor of intracellular calcium release, was considerably recovered by addition of A23187. Based on these results, it is suggested that diazepam inhibits the contractility of detrusor muscle acting directly on the smooth muscle cell, which is unrelated to the activation of GABA receptors. Its inhibitory action appears to be mediated through interference with the influx of extracellular calcium.", 
    "89": "Investigations in laboratory animals indicate that certain drugs that influence specific neurotransmitters can have profound effects on the recovery process. Even small doses of some drugs given after brain injury facilitate recovery while others are harmful. Preliminary clinical studies suggest that the same drugs that enhance recovery in laboratory animals (e.g., amphetamine) may have similar effects in humans after stroke. In addition, some of the drugs that impair recovery of function after focal brain injury in laboratory animals (e.g. haloperidol, benzodiazepines, clonidine, prazosin, phenytoin) are commonly given to stroke patients for coincident medical problems and may interfere with functional recovery in humans. Until the impact of pharmacologic agents on the recovering brain is better understood, the available data suggest that care should be exercised in the selection of drugs used in the treatment of the recovering stroke patient. Pharmacologic enhancement of recovery after focal brain injury may be possible in humans.", 
    "90": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, taking part in processes which are now relatively well understood but also in processes which are remarkable progress has been achieved. The most thoroughly studied field of GABA operation is its role of inhibitory neurotransmitter realized through the mediation of GABA-A and GABA-B receptors. There are at least 40 per cent of synaptic inhibitory events in the CNS in which the neurotransmitter action of GABA is involved. The action of GABA on GABA-A receptor, a Cl- channel, is influenced by benzodiazepines, barbiturates and other substances, suggesting that some neurological and psychiatric diseases are connected with the function of GABA-A receptor. In addition to synaptic inhibition, GABA has several metabolic regulatory functions. GABA is produced not only in neurons but also in beta cells of the pancreas and in tubular cells of the kidney cortex. Its role in these parenchymatous cells is not sufficiently understood. Similarly as GABA, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), an enzyme catalysing GABA formation from glutamate, has also been intensively studied. GAD structure, its function in various parts of the CNS and in some parenchymatous cells, and the regulation of GAD activity are still in the focus of interest. Recently GAD has been demonstrated to act as autoantigen in the rare neurological disease \"stiff man syndrome\" (SMS) and in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). In the presented paper a short review of GABA functions, GAD properties and of the antigenic feature of GAD are given. (Fig. 7, Ref. 41.)", 
    "91": "A total of 221 cases of deliberate acute overdose with fluvoxamine reported to the Paris Poison Centre, and 78 cases collected by the International Drug Safety Department of Duphar BV were analysed. Other agents, mainly benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, other antidepressants and alcohol, were also taken in 77% of the cases. The acute toxicity that could be attributed to fluvoxamine alone was rarely severe. The symptoms observed were always benign when the dose of fluvoxamine was below 1000 mg and included drowsiness, tremor, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bradycardia and/or anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, mydriasis, sinus tachycardia, urinary retention). Seizures occurred in a few cases after high doses (generally > 1500 mg). Cardiotoxicity was not a serious problem; sinus bradycardia was noted with doses of less than 1000 mg, but was always moderate and required no treatment. Conduction abnormalities were rare.", 
    "92": "A consecutive cohort of 66 subjects receiving ECT in a period of a year were studied retrospectively in order to ascertain whether concurrent psychotropic medication affected negatively their response to ECT. No correlation was found between any drug variable and any outcome variable. It is concluded that a preliminary negative result of this nature suggests that there may not be such a negative effect, but that this must be confirmed by a prospective study; it is also cautioned that, to undertake such, current ethical and legal issues may need to be resolved.", 
    "93": "The anticonvulsant activities of a noncompetitive (GYKI 52466) and a competitive (NBQX) AMPA/kainate antagonist were compared in the maximal electroshock (MES) seizure test and various chemoconvulsant models. Both antagonists were protective in the MES and pentylenetetrazol tests. GYKI 52466 was also protective against seizures and lethality induced by 4-aminopyridine, kainate and AMPA, but not by NMDA, whereas NBQX was ineffective in these chemoconvulsant tests. Both GYKI 52466 and NBQX produced motor impairment at doses similar to those that were protective in the MES test. Under some circumstances, noncompetitive AMPA/kainate antagonists could offer advantages over competitive antagonists in seizure therapy. However, neurological toxicity is an obstacle to the potential clinical use of both classes of agents.", 
    "94": "Pain is the most common symptom experienced in patients with advanced cancer. This pain may be acute, chronic, or intermittent, and often has a definable origin, usually related to tumor recurrence and treatment. The goal of therapy is to provide patients with enough pain relief to enable them to tolerate diagnostic and therapeutic manipulations and allow them freedom of movement and choice, while limiting medication-induced adverse effects. Morphine is the medication of choice, and is available in a sustained-release oral formulation with convenient around-the-clock administration every 8 to 12 hours. Morphine can also be administered subcutaneously, intravenously, and rectally, which provides enhanced flexibility for dosing patients unable to take oral medications. The transdermal fentanyl patch may provide a convenient dosage-form alternative if oral morphine preparations are not tolerated. Some patients with advanced cancer may require other adjunctive medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, tricyclic antidepressants, steroids, or benzodiazepines, as well as psychologic techniques, to assist in pain management.", 
    "95": "The effect of free fatty acids (FFA) and non-enzymatic glycation on the binding kinetics of dansylsarcosine (DS) to human serum albumin (HSA) was studied using the stopped-flow technique. The influence of FFA on the binding parameters of 25% glycated HSA depended on the type of fatty acid. The addition of stearic, oleic and linoleic acids in a concentration of 0.3 mmol/l showed no inhibitory effects on the association rate constant (k2) value for DS binding to 25% glycated HSA (k2 without FFA: 385 +/- 10 s-1, k2 with FFA > or = 385 +/- 10 s-1). In contrast, shorter chain fatty acids (hexanoic, octanoic, decanoic, lauric and myristic acids) showed marked inhibitory effects for 0.3 mmol/l FFA (k2 range: 233 +/- 32 to 69 +/- 5 s-1) and for 0.6 mmol/l FFA (k2 range: 125 +/- 3 to 20 +/- 4 s-1). The association rate constant (k2) as well as the affinity constant (KA) of DS were markedly affected by glycation: k2 was 686 +/- 61 s-1 for 7% glycated HSA, 385 +/- 10 s-1 for 25% glycated HSA and 209 +/- 12 s-1 for 50% glycated HSA. KA decreased from 6.1 +/- 2.9 x 10(5) M-1 for 7% glycated HSA, to 5.1 +/- 0.1 x 10(5) M-1 for 25% glycated HSA and to 1.3 +/- 0.6 x 10(5) M-1 for 50% glycated HSA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "96": "Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to measure the laminar distribution of [3H]glycine and [3H]glutamate binding to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex, [3H]D,L-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) binding to the AMPA receptor, and [3H]flunitrazepam binding to the benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor in three areas of visual cortex in control and Alzheimer's disease (AD) postmortem human brains (primary or striate visual cortex, visual association cortex, and higher-order visual association cortex, corresponding to Brodmann Areas 17, 18, and 21, respectively). In Area 17, binding to the NMDA, AMPA, and BDZ receptors was not significantly altered in the AD brains (except in layer VI for [3H]glycine and layer III for [3H]AMPA, where binding was reduced in the AD brains). Ligand binding to the two EAA receptors in Area 18 was, however, significantly reduced in the AD brains (layers I through III for [3H]glycine and layers III through VI for [3H]AMPA). In Area 21, binding to both the NMDA and BDZ receptors but not to the AMPA receptor, was significantly reduced in almost all laminae of the AD brains (layers I through VI for [3H]glycine and layers I through V for [3H]flunitrazepam). This hierarchical pattern of laminar binding loss with increasing complexity of association visual cortices is consistent with the increasing numbers of neurofibrillary tangles found in those areas, implicating NMDA and BDZ receptor bearing cells in AD neuropathology. AMPA receptor losses do not parallel the pathology, suggesting that AMPA receptors are not directly correlated with the pathology.", 
    "97": "The effects of the muscarinic agonist carbachol on the secretion and accumulation of gastric mucus glycoprotein (mucin) were examined. Gastric mucin obtained from the soluble mucus, adherent mucus gel, and surface mucosal and deep mucosal layer was isolated and quantified. One hour after the subcutaneous administration of carbachol (0.08-80 micrograms/kg body weight) the deep corpus mucin content had decreased significantly (75% of control), corresponding to an increase (120% of control) in the soluble mucin content with 0.8 microgram/kg of carbachol treatment. These changes were counteracted by 10 mg/kg of pirenzepine (selective M1 antagonist) pretreatment. On a single administration of 10 mg/kg of pirenzepine, deep corpus mucin tended to increase, and soluble mucin decreased significantly (49% of the control). These two drugs failed to cause any significant change in the mucin content of the surface and antral deep mucosa or the adherent mucus gel. The muscarinic agonist and the M1 antagonist are thus shown to accelerate the secretion and accumulation, respectively, of mucin in the deep corpus mucosa. Thus intrinsic M1 receptor may possibly be involved in the secretion of mucin in the gastric deep corpus mucosa.", 
    "98": "1. Clonazepam is one of the most potent benzodiazepines known to decrease the activity of the central serotonergic systems. The acute and subchronic administration of clonazepam reduced serotonin (5HT) turnover rate in the hippocampus of the rat, as determined by the ratio of the monoamine and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. 2. The modulation of 5HT binding sites and 5HT1A receptors by the administration of clonazepam for various periods of time were studied in the hippocampus and the raphe area by experiments with radioligands. 3. The density of [3H]5HT recognition sites increased in the hippocampus of clonazepam-treated rats in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This increase was impaired by the simultaneous administration of the 5HT agonist 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine. The affinity of this binding did not significantly change. This observation might indicate an increase in some of the 5HT receptors or an increase of the uptake site. 4. The binding parameters for [3H]DPAT, Bmax and Kd, decreased in the hippocampus but not in the raphe area of clonazepam-treated rats. It seems that the presynaptic reduction in 5HT function, resulting in the decrease of its availability at the synaptic space, modifies the corresponding 5HT recognition sites. 5. These changes could be related to the anxyolitic activity or the withdrawal symptoms of benzodiazepines.", 
    "99": "1. The effect of different stressful stimuli on the function of the GABAA-ionophore receptor complex was evaluated by measuring the binding of 35S-TBPS to the chloride channel associated recognition sites. 2. Foot-shock stress enhanced 35S-TBPS binding in membrane preparation from rat cerebral cortex. The effect of foot-shock on 35S-TBPS binding was mimicked by the anxiogenic and proconvulsant beta-carboline FG 7142 and antagonized by anxiolytic benzodiazepines and by the novel anxiolytic and anticonvulsant beta-carboline, abecarnil. 3. A brief exposure of rats to CO2 inhalation produced, like foot-shock and FG 7142, a marked increase of 35S-TBPS binding in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus. The effect of CO2 inhalation was maximal 10 min after treatment and return to control value in 2 hours. Previous administration of anxiolytic drugs (alprazolam and abecarnil) completely prevented the CO2 inhalation-induced increase of 35S-TBPS binding. 4. All together these data strongly suggest that carbon dioxide inhalation, like stress and anxiogenic drugs, decreases the function of the GABAA receptor complex.",

    "105": "The inhalation anesthetic isoflurane stereoselectively modulates ligand binding to the GABAA receptor complex. The (+)-isomer of isoflurane was more potent and efficacious than the (-)-isomer in enhancing [3H]flunitrazepam binding to benzodiazepine receptors. For example, concentration effect curves for Cl- enhancement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding were significantly different (P < 0.001) in the presence of (+)- and (-)-isoflurane (0.44 and 0.88 mM). At the higher anesthetic concentration, they potency of Cl- to increase [3H]flunitrazepam binding was increased 3.2- and 1.45-fold by (+)- and (-)-isoflurane, respectively (P < 0.05). Likewise, concentration-effect curves for (+) isoflurane-enhanced [3H]flunitrazepam binding were significantly different (P < 0.05-P < 0.001) from the (-)-isomer in the presence of 0-200 mM Cl-. Stereoselectivity was not observed with respect to the potencies of these enantiomers as inhibitors of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding to sites within the Cl- ionophore. In this measure, the isomers had similar potencies (P > 0.05), although at higher concentrations (> 0.1 mM) (+)-isoflurane produced significantly more inhibition than (-)-isoflurane. While the absolute potency differences between isomers were modest (< or = 2-fold) and measure dependent, these effects were manifested at clinically relevant concentrations of isoflurane and are consistent with in vivo studies demonstrating (+)-isoflurane is a more effective anesthetic than the (-)-isomer. This is the first demonstration of an inhalation anesthetic producing a stereoselective perturbation of the GABAA receptor complex.", 
    "106": "Several 1,4-diazepines were recently reported to bind with high affinities to the \"diazepam-insensitive\" (DI) isoform of the benzodiazepine receptor (BzR) (Korpi, E.R.; Uusi-Oukari, M.; Wegelius, K. Eur. J. Pharm. 1992, 213, 323-329. Wong, G.; Skolnick, P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. Mol. Pharm. Sec. 1992, 225, 63-68). However, only the putative ethanol antagonist 1 (Ro 15-4513) displayed modest selectivity for the DI site compared to other \"diazepam-sensitive\" (DS) BzR isoforms. In order to probe the requirements for selective, high-affinity binding to the DI site, the affinities of 47 benzodiazepines have been determined at both DI and DS BzR sites. In addition, single X-ray crystallographic analyses for three of these derivatives, 5 (Ro 17-1812), 6 (Ro 16-6028), and 42 (Ro 14-5974), are reported. The radioligand binding studies reveal that modifications to the 3-, 7-, and 8-positions of 6-oxoimidazo[1,5-alpha] [1,4]benzodiazepines have a marked influence on the Ki(DI)/Ki(DS) ratios. In order to more precisely determine the structural requirements for both high affinity and selectivity at DI BzR relative to DS, 3D-QSAR analyses were carried out on ligand affinities at both of these BzR isoforms. This analysis was based, in part, on the new X-ray crystallographic data. Satisfactory cross-validated regression equations were obtained individually for the logarithms of ligand affinities at DI and DS as well as for the differences of the logarithms of their affinities at these two isoforms (cross-validated R2 > 0.70 for all three regression equations). The steric and electrostatic 3D-QSAR DI and DS maps are in qualitative accord with the structure-activity relationship (SAR) data. Furthermore, the DI and DI/DS maps may be useful in the design of ligands with enhanced DI affinity and DI/DS selectivity, respectively.", 
    "107": "Oncogenic Ras proteins transform animal cells to a malignant phenotype only when modified by farnesyl residues attached to cysteines near their carboxyl termini. The farnesyltransferase that catalyzes this reaction recognizes tetrapeptides of the sequence CAAX, where C is cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is a carboxyl-terminal methionine or serine. Replacement of the two aliphatic residues with a benzodiazepine-based mimic of a peptide turn generated potent inhibitors of farnesyltransferase [50 percent inhibitory concentration (IC50) < 1 nM]. Unlike tetrapeptides, the benzodiazepine peptidomimetics enter cells and block attachment of farnesyl to Ras, nuclear lamins, and several other proteins. At micromolar concentrations, these inhibitors restored a normal growth pattern to Ras-transformed cells. The benzodiazepine peptidomimetics may be useful in the design of treatments for tumors in which oncogenic Ras proteins contribute to abnormal growth, such as that of the colon, lung, and pancreas.", 
    "108": "The central and peripheral effects of clonazepam (central benzodiazepine receptor agonist) on intestinal myoelectrical activity and the origin of the effects were evaluated in conscious rats, chronically fitted with Nichrome electrodes implanted on the jejunum and with an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) cannula. Administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) in 12-h fasted rats, clonazepam (0.05 to 0.5 mg/kg) dose dependently disrupted jejunal cyclic migrating myoelectric complexes, characterizing the fasted state, which were replaced by a permanent irregular spiking activity, lasting 259 +/- 37 min for clonazepam at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg. This disruption of migrating myoelectric complexes occurred after a delay which increased with increasing clonazepam doses. In contrast, injected i.c.v. at doses from 1 microgram/kg to 1 mg/kg, clonazepam did not alter the migrating myoelectric complexes pattern of the small intestine. Injected i.p., flumazenil (central benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) (1 mg/kg) but not PK 11-195 (peripheral benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) (5 mg/kg) suppressed the effects of i.p. clonazepam (0.1 mg/kg). Administered i.c.v., 10 min prior to clonazepam (0.1 mg/kg i.p.), devazepide (CCKA receptor antagonist) at a dose as low as 10 ng/kg reduced the migrating myoelectric complex disruption induced by clonazepam. L365-260 (CCKB receptor antagonist) administered i.c.v reduced the migrating myoelectric complex disruption at 10-fold higher doses and loxiglumide (CCKA receptor antagonist) injected i.c.v, at 100-fold higher doses. When administered i.p. neither devazepide nor L365-260 affected the duration of migrating myoelectric complex disruption induced by clonazepam (0.1 mg/kg i.p.) or its delay of occurrence at doses lower than 0.1 mg/kg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "109": "Anxiolytic and pro-exploratory melatonin properties were assessed in rats using a plus-maze procedure. Both melatonin (1 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) showed a significant diurnal variation to decrease anxiety and to promote exploratory behavior. Melatonin displayed anxiolytic activity at night, with absence of effects at noon and a weak activity at the beginning of the light phase. Melatonin pro-exploratory activity was found only at night. Diazepam exerted significant anxiolysis during the night, with less activity during the day. Diazepam pro-exploratory activity was found during the night only. A dose-response study carried out by injecting 1-20 mg/kg melatonin at 12:00 or 18:00 h indicated that melatonin activity was greatest at 18:00 h. Diazepam was anxiolytic at both times, and pro-exploratory at 18:00 h only. Melatonin activity was blunted by administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil.", 
    "110": "A mixture of dexamphetamine and chlordiazepoxide induces hyperactivity in both mice and rats. This type of hyperactivity has been proposed as an animal model of mania. Magnesium valproate itself had little influence on the activity of normal mice and rats. Acute pretreatment of mice with magnesium valproate (75-300 mg/kg p.o., 37.5-150 mg/kg i.v.) attenuated the mixture-induced hyperactivity. Pretreatment of rats with a single dose of magnesium valproate (75-300 mg/kg, p.o. or i.p.) also counteracted the locomotor hyperactivity caused by the mixture. The effects of magnesium valproate in the mixture-treated mice and rats could be abolished by bicuculline and picrotoxin, but not isoniazid. These findings suggest that the antimanic effect of valproate may be related to its ability to enhance the postsynaptic effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)."
