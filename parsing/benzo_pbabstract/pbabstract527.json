    "0": "A 50-year-old woman developed rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuric renal impairment after an oral dose of 250 mg nitrazepam and 1,250 mg doxepin. Serum creatinine increased from 70 mumol/l to 472 mumol/l in two days. Serum creatine phosphokinase reached a maximal level of 391 mu kat/l (reference range less than 2.5 mu kat/l) on the third day and serum myoglobin was maximally 910 nmol/l (reference range less than 4.5 nmol/l) on the fourth day after the overdose. Passive and active movements of the knees and ankles became increasingly restricted, but the patient felt no muscle pain. Diuresis decreased to 20-22 ml/hour in spite of repetitive doses of furosemide, but was enforced to greater than 100 ml/hour by vigorous infusion of saline. Haemodialysis was avoided on this regimen. It is suggested that in patients intoxicated with nitrazepam and/or doxepin, rhabdomyolysis should be suspected when a rapidly increasing serum concentration of creatinine is found, even in the absence of muscle pain.", 
    "1": "The deliberate ingestion of household 'strong' bleach (NaOCl) caused severe metabolic disturbance. Hyperchloraemic acidosis was probably due to NaOCl reacting with hydrochloric acid in the stomach to form hypochlorous acid and chlorine. 'Strong' household bleach contains 10% NaOCl and this provides a large sodium load. The ingestion of 500 ml contained 673 mmol sodium and caused hypernatraemia.",

    "3": "Third molar surgery in the oral and maxillofacial surgery office has been a predictable model for evaluating the efficacy of sedatives and analgesics. In this setting, butorphanol plus diazepam and fentanyl plus diazepam were compared for surgical effectiveness and postoperative recovery. The comparison of butorphanol to a known sedative combination was clinically very satisfactory. It appears from this data that butorphanol has a pharmacologic place in outpatient conscious sedation.",

Pharmacokinetic and metabolic research is essential to a better understanding of the pharmacological and toxicological activities of drugs and their metabolites. 3. Data generated by such a strategy can be used to improve Phase I trials, particularly those for anticancer drugs. 4. Human and animal in vitro models are potentially powerful preclinical tools in: (i) The prediction of the pharmacological behaviour of analogues belonging to the same family, e.g. vinca alkaloids; (ii) The selection of the animal species most closely related to humans on the basis of metabolic pattern; (iii) The assessment of the duration of drug action--particularly those drugs exhibiting different metabolic clearances (e.g. benzodiazepines); (iv) The understanding and prediction of drug interactions, i.e. those described for cyclosporin A and macrolide antibiotics; and (v) The explanation of the metabolic origins of interindividual variabilities in pharmacological activity.", 
    "5": "GTP (guanosine-5'-triphosphate) markedly reduced high-affinity 3H-oxotremorine-M binding to M2 receptors on brain slices in autoradiographic experiments while 3H-pirenzepine binding to M1 receptors was largely unaffected. The distribution of M1 receptors so labelled was also not altered by GTP to include former M2-rich regions, thus indicating that GTP could not, by itself, interconvert high agonist-affinity M2 receptors to M1 receptors.", 
    "6": "CGS 8216, a benzodiazepine-receptor ligand with inverse agonistic properties, and CGS 9896, which possesses partial agonistic or mixed agonist-antagonist properties were compared in a number of epilepsy models. The effect of CGS 9896 on the decrease in GABA levels induced by isoniazid was also investigated. CGS 9896 inhibited the kindling process in rats in that it delayed the development of overt seizures and the increase in the duration of afterdischarges. In a genetic rat model characterized by absence-like EEG patterns, CGS 9896 dose-dependently suppressed these spontaneously occurring discharges, while CGS 8216 had no effect. However, CGS 8216 antagonized the anticonvulsant action of CGS 9896. CGS 9896 protected mice against seizures induced by beta-vinyllactic acid, whereas CGS 8216 shortened the latency period before convulsions occurred. CGS 9896 retarded the onset of convulsive fits caused by isoniazid without preventing the decrease in GABA levels produced by that drug. These results confirm the anticonvulsant activity of CGS 9896 and demonstrate the inverse agonistic activity of CGS 8216. The profile of CGS 9896 in the above tests suggests that it might be an effective anticonvulsant, primarily in absence-type seizures.",

    "8": "Organophosphorus-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP) is thought to result from organophosphorylation of neuropathy target esterase (NTE; formerly known as neurotoxic esterase), followed by an \"aging\" of the phosphorylated NTE. Protection against OPIDP should thus be achieved by production of an inhibited but \"nonaging\" NTE. Inhibited NTE produced in vitro by interaction with any of the four resolved isomers of soman aged negligibly (M. K. Johnson, D. J. Read, and H. P. Benschop, 1985a, Biochem. Pharmacol., 34, 1945-1951). Therefore both unresolved soman and the most inhibitory isomer (C(-)P(+)) were tested in adult hens for effects on NTE and for ability to produce OPIDP. With improved prophylaxis and therapy of acute intoxication, birds survived greater than 100 X LD50 of unresolved soman and did not develop OPIDP. One day after dosing, about half of brain and spinal cord NTE was in an unmodified (unaged) inhibited form; at this time eight survivors were challenged with a neuropathic dose of diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate (DFP). No neuropathy developed in four out of eight birds and mild to moderate signs were seen in the other four. Nine challenge control birds receiving DFP after solvent all developed severe neuropathy. Partial protection was seen in three out of three birds dosed prior to DFP challenge with sufficient C(-)P(+) isomer of soman (1.2 mg/kg sc) to convert about half of the spinal cord NTE to unaged inhibited form. Protection was not related to cholinergic shock. Two birds which survived out of eight pretreated with tabun (12 mg/kg sc) had about as much NTE inhibited as after soman administration but it was all in the modified (aged) inhibited form; these birds were not protected against DFP-induced neuropathy. A limited histopathologic examination showed that typical neurodegenerative lesions were seen only in birds with clear clinical neuropathy.", 
    "9": "The effect of diazepam on the cardiovascular toxicity of bupivacaine was investigated in a rat model. Under chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg intraperitoneal) anesthesia, unilateral femoral venous and bilateral femoral arterial cannulae were placed for administration of drugs, for blood sampling, and for continuous qualitative monitoring of arterial blood pressure. Lead II ECG was continuously recorded and a tracheostomy performed to increase FIO2 by use of a \"T-piece.\" Four groups of 24 to 36 rats each were studied. All rats received IV bupivacaine 2 mg/kg, within 10 seconds. Group I, the control group, received only bupivacaine. Groups II and III received IV diazepam 0.2 mg/kg, or diazepam vehicle in an equivalent volume, respectively. Five minutes after this pretreatment, groups II and III received IV bupivacaine 2 mg/kg. Group IV was given diazepam, 0.2 mg/kg, 30 seconds after injection of 2 mg/kg bupivacaine. A marked respiratory and metabolic acidosis occurred in all rats but was significantly worse in groups II and III. No rat in the study became hypoxemic. Serious arrhythmias (ventricular or supraventricular tachycardia) were noted in all groups, but the incidence was significantly higher in the group of rats given diazepam pretreatment than in the other three groups. It is concluded that IV diazepam 0.2 mg/kg given 5 minutes before administration of IV bupivacaine 2 mg/kg increases the incidence of serious cardiac arrhythmias. Second, this increase is not solely due to increased acidosis, because the rats receiving the vehicle (group III) developed equivalent acidosis but did not develop increased arrhythmias.", 
    "10": "Superior mesenteric arterial flow, aortic blood pressure, and heart rate were recorded, and plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) concentrations were measured in conscious unrestrained cats during intravenous infusions of AVP (0.1-8.1 mU.kg-1. min-1). Responses to AVP were studied when autonomic nervous system (ANS) function remained intact and when the cholinergic limb of the system had been antagonized by methscopolamine nitrate (0.5 mg/kg) or by pirenzepine (60 micrograms/kg). Elevations in the circulating levels of AVP to approximately 30 and 600 fmol/ml in cats with intact ANS function were associated with decreases in superior mesenteric arterial conductance (SMAC, ml.min-1.kg-1.mmHg-1) of approximately 9 and 50%. The relationship between the dose of AVP and the decreases in SMAC for methscopolamine-treated cats was displaced slightly but significantly to the left of that for intact cats. The relationship between the dose of AVP and the increases in arterial pressure for methscopolamine-treated cats was also significantly displaced to the left of that for intact cats; however, the magnitude of the displacement was much greater than that for the dose-conductance relationship. In contrast to the findings with methscopolamine, pirenzepine did not significantly influence either the dose-conductance or dose-blood pressure response curves. These results are consistent with three conclusions. First, physiologically (less than 30 fmol/ml) and pathophysiologically (less than 600 fmol/ml) relevant concentrations of AVP are capable of inducing intestinal vasoconstriction, even in the presence of intact autonomic function. Second, the cholinergic limb of the autonomic nervous system plays a major role in buffering the vasopressor effects of AVP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "A new antagonist of the peripheral cholecystokinin receptor, L-364,718, was found to block the reductions in food intake and exploratory activity induced by intraperitoneal administration of cholecystokinin octapeptide sulfate. L-364,718 significantly reversed the cholecystokinin-induced reduction in feeding at doses of 10 micrograms/kg - 10 mg/kg i.p. L-364,718 significantly reversed the cholecystokinin-induced reduction in exploratory activity at doses of 500 ng/kg - 10 mg/kg i.p. The time course of antagonist activity of L-364,718 was immediate to 90 minutes after intraperitoneal administration. L-364,718 had no significant effect on food intake or exploratory activity when administered alone, over the dose range of 100 ng/kg-10 mg/kg i.p. This compound appears to be at least one hundred times more potent than proglumide or benzotript as an antagonist of the behavioral effects of peripherally administered cholecystokinin.", 
    "12": "A series of 4-substituted 4H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepines was prepared by standard methodology. These compounds were tested in vitro as antagonists of the binding of [125I]cholecystokinin (CCK) to rat pancreas and guinea pig brain receptors and of the binding of [125I]gastrin to guinea pig gastric glands. All compounds proved to have greater affinity for the peripheral CCK receptor with some analogues having IC50's in the subnanomolar range. In vivo activity of selected compounds in mice is presented and the structure/activity profile of this class of benzodiazepines as CCK antagonists is discussed.", 
    "13": "Benzodiazepine agonists such as Ro 11-6896 [B10(+)], diazepam, clonazepam, and flurazepam were found to enhance muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake into rat cerebral cortical synaptoneurosomes. The rank order of potentiation was B10(+) greater than diazepam greater than clonazepam greater than flurazepam. These benzodiazepines had no effect on 36Cl-uptake in the absence of muscimol. Further, the inactive enantiomer, Ro 11-6893 [B10(-)], and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand Ro 5-4864 did not potentiate muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake at concentrations up to 10 microM. In contrast, the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate and 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta- carboline-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester inhibited muscimol stimulated 36Cl- uptake. Benzodiazepines and beta-carbolines altered the apparent K0.5 of muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake, without affecting the Vmax. The effects of both benzodiazepine receptor agonists and inverse agonists were reversed by the benzodiazepine antagonists Ro 15-1788 and CGS-8216. These data further confirm that central benzodiazepine receptors modulate the capacity of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor agonists to enhance chloride transport and provide a biochemical technique for studying benzodiazepine receptor function in vitro.", 
    "14": "Pharmacological treatment of social phobia has not been extensively studied. Recent reports suggest that social phobia may be treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers, or clonidine. The authors describe four patients with social phobia who responded moderately to markedly well when treated with the triazolobenzodiazepine alprazolam. Patients with social phobia and patients with agoraphobia with panic attacks differ in the focus of anxiety, sensitivity to lactate infusion, and the pattern of symptoms during anxiety episodes. However, there is significant overlap in the clinical features of these two patient groups. The preliminary finding that several types of pharmacological agents that are effective in treating agoraphobia with panic attacks may also be effective in treating social phobia suggests that the two disorders may share some common pathophysiology.", 
    "15": "Chronic feeding of rats with camostate results in pancreatic hypertrophy or hyperplasia, or both. Previous studies suggest that this effect of camostate occurs via an increase in endogenous cholecystokinin due to an enteral feedback mechanism involving the inhibition of trypsin in the duodenum. Studies employing proglumide, a weak and relatively nonspecific cholecystokinin antagonist, have failed to fully abolish camostate-induced pancreas growth. We examined the effects of L-364,718, a new and highly potent cholecystokinin receptor antagonist, on camostate-induced pancreas growth in rats. The pancreas weights and the concentrations of ribonucleic acid, protein, and chymotrypsinogen in the pancreas of rats treated with camostate alone were significantly elevated over those of controls. These effects of camostate were completely abolished in rats treated with camostate + L-364,718. The pancreas weights and the concentrations of deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid in the pancreas of rats treated with L-364,718 alone were significantly lower than values in control rats. These data indicate that camostate-induced pancreas growth in rats appears to be dependent on the actions of endogenous cholecystokinin and that cholecystokinin may play a role in the maintenance of pancreatic growth in normal rats.", 
    "16": "Drug discrimination methodology affords a behavioral end point that reflects actions of a drug at the cellular level. The stimulus control of behavior by drugs of many pharmacological classes satisfies criteria for a receptor-mediated phenomenon. Within many classes of drugs, order of relative of potency for discriminative effects correlates highly with the order of potency of the drugs in other procedures that involve interactions with a defined population of receptors. Examples include the morphine-like opioids and the benzodiazepines. Specific competitive antagonists are of paramount importance for defining neuronal substrates that subserve the discriminative effects of a drug. Quantitative pharmacological approaches can be used not only to define the receptor mediating the discriminative effects of a drug but also to assess the intrinsic activity of the drug at the receptor. The primary site of stimulus control of behavior by most drugs can be shown by indirect and direct means to be of central rather than peripheral origin; however, neuronanatomical localization of specific sites of drug action remains elusive. Attention is starting to be focused on endogenous neuropeptides, their discriminative stimulus properties and potential role in modulating discriminative effects of drugs. Some of the most important contributions of drug discrimination methodology may arise in the rapidly emerging area of peptide neuropharmacology.", 
    "17": "It is now established that the overall prognosis for epilepsy is good and that remission will occur in at least 75% of patients following adequate treatment with monotherapy. Patients who fail to respond to monotherapy, who are not suitable for surgery, and who continue to have frequent seizures may have to be considered for an alternative drug regimen. A review of the literature indicates that complete seizure control with adjunctive treatment is rare, but improved seizure control can be obtained in up to 40% of patients. In a study of clobazam as adjunctive treatment, 60% (N = 20) of our patients responded to treatment initially and 33% maintained an improvement over an 18-month period. In 31 patients who failed to respond to carbamazepine as monotherapy, primidone (N = 16) or valproate (N = 15) were prescribed as adjunctive treatment. One patient obtained complete freedom from seizures and 14 (45%) had a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency. Suggested indications for the use of additive treatment in epilepsy are discussed.", 
    "18": "The relative efficacy and tolerability of two lormetazepam doses, 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg, were compared in 145 elderly insomniacs in a double-blind, multi-centre study. On entry, data were recorded on the patient characteristics and sleep pattern, and patients were allocated at random to receive treatment with either 0.5 mg or 1.0 lormetazepam per night for 7 nights. Details were recorded daily in a diary by patients on sleep latency, the number of night-time awakenings, time of morning awakening, and whether they awoke refreshed. A record was also kept of any adverse effects of treatment. At the end of the study period, an overall assessment was made by the physician of the patients' response to treatment. The results showed that patients in both dose groups improved significantly (p = 0.001) in the three principal efficacy measures, but there were no apparent trends in the time when patients awakened in the morning. The only evidence of a difference in response to the two doses was that significantly (p less than 0.01) more patients on the larger dose were given a global rating of 'much improved' by the physician. Five patients withdrew from the study; 2 because of lack of efficacy, 2 because of side-effects, and 1 because of a suspected myocardial infarction not related to therapy. Only 6% of patients (4 on each dosage) reported adverse effects, most frequently related to carry-over sedation, i.e. drowsiness, sleepiness, muzzy head. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "A double-blind study was carried out in 105 patients with chronic spasticity associated with hemiplegia in order to compare the efficacy and tolerability of tizanidine with that of diazepam. Dosage was increased progressively, if tolerated, to a maximum of 24 mg tizanidine or 30 mg diazepam per day at the end of 2 weeks. The optimum dosage was then maintained for 6 weeks. Efficacy and tolerability parameters were assessed after 2 and 8-weeks' therapy. Patients on tizanidine but not those on diazepam showed a statistically significant improvement in functional status, as assessed by walking distance on flat ground. Analysis of the stretch reflex in four groups of muscles showed that both tizanidine and diazepam reduced the duration of contractions and increased the angle at which contraction occurred, but there were no significant differences between the two drugs. Clonus of the triceps surae resolved in 48% of tizanidine and 40% of diazepam patients. Evaluation of the effect of therapy revealed an improvement with each drug in approximately 83% of patients, with the overall evaluation being slightly (but non-significantly) in favour of tizanidine. There were fewer discontinuations of treatment in the tizanidine group as a result of side-effects. It would appear, therefore, that tizanidine is an effective and well-tolerated drug in the treatment of cerebral spasticity.", 
    "20": "Buspirone is a new anxiolytic agent with an original chemical structure. Its activity in doses of 15 to 30 mg per day has been demonstrated in patients presenting with manifestations of generalized anxiety. Its mode of action is still imperfectly known; in animals, it influences several neuromediator systems but does not act on benzodiazepine receptors. Its main pharmacokinetic features are: complete absorption when given orally, short half-life (4 to 8 h), reduced plasma clearance in patients with hepatic cirrhosis or renal impairment and no major interaction with most of the other psychotropic drugs. Controlled clinical studies have provided evidence of its anxiolytic properties; against anxiety symptoms buspirone has proved more effective than placebo and as effective as several reference benzodiazepine derivatives, with a lesser incidence of sedative effects. However, it is not effective in the treatment of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Gastrointestinal disorders and moderate headache have been reported in less than 10 p. 100 of the patients treated. Administered acutely, buspirone does not seem to alter cognitive mechanisms. Unlike benzodiazepines, it does not potentiate the effects of alcohol and does not lead to drug-dependence. Its usefulness in panic disorders, anxious-depressive states and obsessional symptoms remains to be determined.", 
    "21": "Low passage-number cultured Chinese hamster cells were used to assess the ability of four benzodiazepines, namely diazepam, medazepam, midazolam and bromazepam, to induce numerical and structural chromosome aberrations. It was observed that diazepam, medazepam and midazolam treatment produced dose-dependent reductions in the number of diploid cells, with medazepam and midazolam inducing significant levels of hyperdiploidy and diazepam inducing low levels of hypodiploidy (at toxic doses). In contrast, bromazepam-treated cultures showed no significant changes in the level of aneuploidy even when exposed to toxic concentrations. All four sedatives were seen to induce low levels of chromosome aberrations, with bromazepam showing the most potent effect (albeit at a single toxic dose). These observations indicate that these structurally related benzodiazepines could be regarded as potentially genotoxic.", 
    "22": "Hypnotic efficacy and safety of 3 weeks of daily doses of 2 mg lorazepam or 30 mg flurazepam were compared in a double-blind cross-over study in eight chronic insomniacs between the ages of 29 and 60 years. Subjects were monitored in the sleep laboratory twice weekly for a total of 25 nights. Also, subjective estimates of sleep, vigilance tests, and adverse effects were recorded throughout the study. Findings indicated lorazepam performed better than flurazepam in most sleep parameters. With lorazepam there was improvement from baseline in percentage of sleep time (P less than .05); in total wake time after sleep onset (P less than .01) and in last third of night (P less than .05); in percentage of stage 2 (P less than .05) (weeks 1, 2, 3) and in percentage of night in stage 4 (weeks 2 and 3). Only total wake time from baseline improved (P less than .05) with flurazepam (week 2). Objective and subjective sleep parameters did not correlate well for either drug. Neither drug impaired REM sleep or vigilance test performance. Side effects (grogginess, lethargy; flurazepam only) were few and none was unexpected; neither rebound insomnia nor early morning insomnia occurred with either drug. In summary, both lorazepam 2 mg at bedtime and flurazepam 30 mg at bedtime were found to be effective and safe for treating chronic insomnia, as measured by parameters of sleep and daytime functioning. Lorazepam had more favorable effects on sleep than did flurazepam.", 
    "23": "The antidepressive effect of an anticonvulsant clonazepam was studied with maximum daily dose of 1.5 to 6.0 mg (mean 3.4 mg) in 27 patients with major depression (n = 18) or bipolar disorder (n = 9). Two of them dropped out at an early stage of the treatment, and the antidepressive effect of clonazepam was evaluated for the remaining 25 patients. A marked to moderate improvement was obtained for 21 patients (84%), and the onset of the antidepressive effect of clonazepam appeared within 1 week in most of the cases who responded to the therapy. The total scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Self-Rating Scale were significantly reduced after the clonazepam treatment. Side effects occurred in 14 patients, but most of them were not severe. From these results, it is thought that clonazepam might be useful as an antidepressant for patients in whom conventional antidepressant treatment are contraindicated.", 
    "24": "Premedication that provides sedation and analgesia is commonly used for patients undergoing endoscopic procedures. We studied the efficacy and safety of butorphanol and diazepam as preprocedure medications for patients having upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. To achieve an adequate level of sedation, patients receiving diazepam required a mean (+/- SEM) dose of 12.0 +/- 1.0 mg, whereas those receiving butorphanol required a mean dose of 4.8 +/- 0.4 mg. There were no differences between treatment groups in the overall assessment of sedation, the ease of performance of the endoscopic procedure, or vital signs during or following the procedure. Fifty-four percent of butorphanol patients and 48% of diazepam patients experienced at least one minor adverse event. Butorphanol in small doses can produce satisfactory sedation and analgesia for patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures.", 
    "25": "(+/-) Etomidate is a short-acting general anaesthetic given by the intravenous route. It has strong adrenal suppression capability initially shown in the rat and then observed in man. At present, the drug seems the most effective adrenocortical inhibitor on a molar basis in vitro. 11 beta-hydroxylase is the most sensitive target enzyme; 16 alpha-, 17 alpha-hydroxylase and cholesterol side-chain cleavage are inhibited by higher concentrations. (+) Etomidate was more active than the (+/-) and far more than the (-) stereoisomer. Etomidate blood concentrations greatly exceed those needed to block adrenal steroidogenesis both when used inappropriately by infusion for long-term sedation (such previously unrecognized drug-induced adrenal suppression has often proved fatal in severely-injured patients) and also when given in very low doses as an induction anaesthetic. Reactive ACTH increase is currently observed. Etomidate, in vivo, does not appear to affect testicular steroidogenesis although it shares an imidazole moiety with fungicide phenylimidazoles endowed with such an action. However, testosterone production may be reduced by high concentrations in vitro. Other gonadal hormones seem unchanged. Both basal and stress-induced blood prolactin levels are lowered by etomidate in the rat but probably not in man arguably through interference at brain level where the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex could be directly involved. Hence, endocrine and neuroendocrine interferences are unique non-anaesthetic effects of etomidate.", 
    "26": "The findings presented here are from the first reported comparison and double-blind evaluation of 20 patients randomly assigned to either chlordiazepoxide (n = 10) or clonidine (n = 10) for the treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Analysis of the study data demonstrated more favorable scores on tests of alcohol withdrawal symptoms (AWS), and better control of blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate with clonidine than with chlordiazepoxide therapy. In all other comparisons, clonidine was at least as efficacious. Clonidine may 'represent a new and possibly even superior pharmacologic treatment in the management of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "27": "Sedation and recovery were studied in 14 patients requiring overnight ventilation in the ICU after aortocoronary bypass surgery performed under high-dose fentanyl anesthesia (120 micrograms/kg). Patients received either IV bolus of diazepam (group D) or a combination of IV bolus with a continuous infusion of midazolam (group M). In the 2 groups, an on-demand mode of administration was used to provide optimal sedation. In the ICU, dosages of plasma catecholamines and serum benzodiazepines were performed. After cessation of benzodiazepine administration at midnight, the rapidity of recovery and time of extubation were recorded. Results showed that in the 2 groups, the association of a high-dose fentanyl anesthesia with a profound postoperative sedation maintained the epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations at low levels during the whole postoperative period. After benzodiazepine discontinuation, recovery and extubation were faster in group M, which correlated with the significant decrease (p less than 0.05) in blood concentration of midazolam observed the first postoperative day whereas at the same time the blood concentration of diazepam did not fall significantly.", 
    "28": "1. Ninety healthy adult men participated in a study of the effects on performance of 60 mg fluoxetine, 50 mg amitriptyline or placebo, alone and in combination with 5 mg diazepam or placebo. 2. In a 2X3 factorial design study, groups of 15 Ss received one of six possible treatment combinations. 3. Ss were tested with a battery of laboratory tests at two post-dosing times. 4. Amitriptyline impaired the performance of all tasks. When diazepam was added to the amitriptyline treatment, the impairment of three tasks increased. Diazepam alone produced impairment on two measures. 5. Fluoxetine alone impaired no task; some impairment occurred with the fluoxetine-diazepam combination.", 
    "29": "There is increasing evidence that the P 100 peak of the pattern-reversal visual-evoked potential (VEP-PR) is delayed by drug-induced dopamine antagonism and in Parkinson's disease. Recent studies have reported that components of the flash-VEP (VEP-F) are delayed by an anticholinergic which does not affect the VEP-PR. The present study found that a single dose of chlorpromazine increased the latencies of the VEP-PR and of the VEP-F and increased the VEP-F P2 amplitude. Trihexyphenidyl increased the VEP-PR amplitude but had only minor effects on the VEP-F. There was a tendency for imipramine to increase VEP-F latencies, especially the N3 peak, but had no effect on the VEP-PR. Both VEPs were unaffected by diazepam. These VEP findings add further support to the role of dopamine in the human visual system. Possible reasons are advanced for the failure of trihexyphenidyl to cause previously reported VEP changes associated with hyoscine hydrobromide. Several important issues need to be addressed by future research.", 
    "30": "A patient with multi-infarct dementia and associated hypomanic features was treated effectively with clonazepam to control logorrhea, hyperactivity, agitation, intrusiveness, and impulsive violence and to promote cooperation and manageability. Plausible mechanisms discussed include the ability of clonazepam to stimulate serotonin synthesis, to bind highly and specifically to the active benzodiazepine binding site, and to raise the seizure threshold.", 
    "31": "Mouth occlusion pressure at 0.1 s (P0.1) and minute ventilation (VE) were measured at rest and during progressive hypercapnia in 32 patients. Under double-blind conditions and according to a 2 x 2 Latin-square design, half the patients received one oral dose of diazepam and its placebo. Using the same design, the other half received zopiclone and its placebo. Normocapnic and moderately hypoxemic patients between the ages of 21 and 69 with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were included in the study. Diazepam produced a statistically significant decrease (p less than 0.05) over its placebo in delta P0.1/delta PETCO2 values following CO2 rebreathing. Zopiclone did not influence either delta P0.1/delta PETCO2 or delta VE/delta PETCO2, but produced a significant increase in respiratory frequency. However, no statistically significant differences were observed between the two active treatments.", 
    "32": "Electrical stimulation of the dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG) elicits autonomic responses similar to those following peripheral pain stimulation. The present study analyzes the effects of morphine and midazolan applied to the same DPAG site on the autonomic responses induced by both types of stimulation. Both drugs attenuated the increase in heart rate and blood pressure induced by DPAG stimulation while attenuating only the increase in heart rate induced by pain stimulation. These results suggest that the neural substrates of the autonomic expression of the DPAG and pain stimulation are different although they may partially overlap.", 
    "33": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) induced arrhythmogenic effects in ouabain-induced arrhythmias and in untreated guinea pigs. The ischemic induced arrhythmias are aggravated by PAF in open-chest dogs. TX receptor antagonizing substances such as BM 13177 and specific PAF antagonists for example BN 52021 and WEB 2086, completely inhibited the PAF induced cardiac arrhythmias. An inhibitor of lipoxygenase such as esculetin inhibited the PAF effect to a small extent, too. Non-specific PAF antagonists such as diltiazem, diazepam, buphenin and trapidil have no or only a slight influence on PAF induced arrhythmias, although the antiarrhythmic effect of diltiazem and trapidil was shown on ouabain induced arrhythmias without PAF. The present study supports the hypothesis that PAF aggravates cardiac arrhythmias under pathophysiological conditions in which PAF is involved. Specific PAF antagonists and TX receptor antagonists induce antiarrhythmic effects under these conditions.", 
    "34": "1. There is some evidence that benzodiazepine may modify the opioid withdrawal syndrome. We have investigated the effect of two different benzodiazepines, diazepam and flunitrazepam, on the morphine withdrawal syndrome experimentally induced in mice. 2. Opiate dependence has been induced by administration of morphine s.c. over a period of five days. Two hours after last morphine administration withdrawal syndrome was induced by s.c. injection of naloxone (5mg/kg). The number of jumps, wet-dog-shakes and paw tremor, and the presence or absence of ptosis, diarrhea, teeth chattering and body tremor were evaluated after naloxone injection. 3. All the signs of morphine withdrawal syndrome was antagonized by flunitrazepam and diazepam, only wet-dog-shake was strongly increased by flunitrazepam.", 
    "35": "Two cases of status epilepticus are reported, whose seizures responded well to the injection of flunitrazepam. One patient had generalized tonic clonic seizures and the other had partial seizures. The improvement of their condition was confirmed by both clinical and electroencephalographic examinations. There were no serious side effects observed. Flunitrazepam might have a potential efficacy for the treatment of status epilepticus of both generalized and partial seizures.", 
    "36": "Efforts to establish more detailed classification of childhood epilepsy have increased our knowledge in this field, but have also led to a tendency of excessive subdivision, especially in generalized forms. This paper emphasizes the need for the reconsideration of a number of basic factors that favour a more unitary physiopathogenetic and clinical interpretation: 1) the electroclinical pattern is age-related; 2) the electroclinical paroxysmal expressiveness is greatest in childhood; 3) two types of manifestations can be distinguished in the process of spread and generalization (a benzodiazepine-sensitive complex associated with a more regular and organized EEG pattern, and a corticotropin-sensitive complex associated with an irregular, unorganized EEG pattern).", 
    "37": "The transfer of drugs from the mother to the fetus is important from the view of possible harmful as well as therapeutic effects on both mother and fetus. In the first trimester of pregnancy this has been sparsely investigated. In 66 first-trimester pregnant women, who had applied for legal termination of the pregnancy, we have calculated different pharmacokinetic parameters of two benzodiazepine derivatives, diazepam and oxazepam, after administration of a single oral dose of 10 or 25 mg to the mother. The calculated pharmacokinetic parameters were within the normal range for healthy adults. The pharmacological active metabolite n-desmethyldiazepam was measured in concentrations near the detection limit. The penetration of diazepam and oxazepam from maternal serum to placental tissue in a 4 h period after drug administration was 31.5% and 49%, respectively, indicating a rapid transfer.", 
    "38": "The etiology and clinical course of acute nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis and ensuing renal failure was surveyed in a series of 40 consecutive patients. In 28 cases the muscle damage occurred after excessive consumption of ethyl alcohol and/or other intoxications. Prolonged lying immobilized was the reason or contributing factor for rhabdomyolysis in 22 cases. The other evident etiologies were convulsions, vigorous physical exercise, arterial occlusion and hypothermia. Typical local signs of rhabdomyolysis--pain, swelling and weakness of the affected muscles--were absent in one fourth of the patients. In these cases the diagnosis was based on transient elevation of serum creatine kinase enzyme activity. Dialyses were required to manage acute renal failure in 24 subjects. All 36 survivors recovered normal renal function. Neurological defects in the extremities still persisted in 16 patients at three months' follow-up.", 
    "39": "In the rat, the antiulcer potencies of the M1 antimuscarinics telenzepine and pirenzepine, the H2 receptor blocker cimetidine, and the H+/K+-ATPase inhibitor omeprazole were compared with their antisecretory potencies. On a molar basis and with regard to inhibition of cysteamine-induced acid secretion, telenzepine ranked first, followed by omeprazole, cimetidine, and pirenzepine; cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcers were best inhibited by telenzepine, with pirenzepine, omeprazole and cimetidine ranking 2nd, 3rd and 4th. Up to the highest dose tested, cimetidine and omeprazole caused inhibition by 26 and 37%, respectively. While, with the antimuscarinics, lesion inhibition runs parallel with inhibition of acid secretion, the H2 receptor blocker and the H+/K+-ATPase inhibitor markedly impair acid secretion, but do not or merely negligibly inhibit cysteamine-induced formation of duodenal ulcers. This suggests that in this animal model the antiulcer effect cannot be attributed exclusively to the antisecretory action.", 
    "40": "The affinities of telenzepine, pirenzepine and atropine for muscarinic acetylcholine receptors have been determined by receptor binding studies using brain cortex and heart membranes of calf and rat. The ratios of affinities of telenzepine and pirenzepine for the cortical M1 receptors, cortical 'non-M1' receptors and cardiac M2 receptors are 50:5:1 and 80:5:1, respectively. The time course of association of telenzepine and pirenzepine with M1 receptors is similar, whereas the half-times for dissociation are 35 and 2.3 min at 37 degrees C, respectively. In further experiments this slow dissociation rate of telenzepine is shown to be rate-limiting for the occupation of M1 receptors by other ligands. The prolonged occupation of M1 receptors by telenzepine is discussed as a possible protective mechanism against acetylcholine released from vagal nerve fibers.", 
    "41": "A 57-year-old man was examined after head trauma and found to have long-lasting organic spasm of the near reflex lacking accommodative spasm. Convergence and miosis had been consistently observed for the follow-up period of one year and three months. Electrooculographical findings showed that there was no lateral rectus muscle palsy in either eye, and that his esotropia became intense in total darkness, compared with fixation on a visual target. Persistent convergence and miosis completely disappeared within 7 minutes after intravenous injections of benzodiazepine. Furthermore, he was able to make a normal near reflex when the spasm disappeared. The effect of benzodiazepine suggests that the disturbance of the GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acid) inhibitory system in the near reflex may be responsible for the occurrence of the spasm.", 
    "42": "In different rat models, the antisecretory and antiulcer effects of the M1-antimuscarinics telenzepine and pirenzepine, the nonselective antimuscarinic atropine, and the H2-blockers ranitidine and cimetidine were compared to each other. Intravenous telenzepine proved to be more potent in inhibiting gastric acid secretion in the Ghosh-Schild rat (carbachol-stimulated), the chronic fistula rat (basal secretion), or, both intravenously and orally, in the modified Shay rat, as compared to pirenzepine, cimetidine or ranitidine. After intravenous administration, only atropine was equally potent to telenzepine in all three models, but it was less potent than telenzepine after oral administration in the modified Shay rat. Gastric mucosal lesions induced by pylorus ligation plus acetylsalicyclic acid or acetylsalicyclic acid plus HCl were best inhibited by telenzepine and atropine, with pirenzepine, ranitidine and cimetidine being less potent, their relative potencies depending on the particular experimental model used. Thus, among the antiulcer drugs tested, telenzepine was the most potent one with respect to both antisecretory and antiulcer activity. Moreover, the duration of the antiulcer effect of telenzepine proved to be significantly longer than that of pirenzepine in the modified Shay rat.", 
    "43": "The effects of psychomotor performance and attention of amitriptyline 75 mg administered without and with diazepam 10 mg have been investigated in 12 healthy subjects. The effects of the compounds were evaluated by objective tests (measurement of body sway, critical flicker fusion, visual reaction time, tachistoscopy, short term visual memory, tapping test, arithmetical calculation and Clement's code) and subjective measurements (visual analogue scales and side effects questionnaire). Measurements were taken before treatment and after 1, 3, 6, 8 and 24 h. Placebo did not affect either the objective or the subjective measurements. Diazepam caused a reduction in attention and performance after 1 h which had disappeared at 3 h. Amitriptyline caused a marked reduction in attention and performance, reaching a peak 3 hours after drug administration and persisting until 8 h. the deterioration in vigilance induced by amitriptyline was potentiated by concomitant diazepam.", 
    "44": "Atropine-induced bradycardia is traditionally ascribed to central vagal stimulation, although bradycardia has also been observed after administration of quarternary amines. Pirezepine, a selective M1-antagonist, causes bradycardia in therapeutic doses for which a peripheral mechanism is postulated. This hypothesis has been investigated in healthy volunteers. Atropine 0.5 mg caused significant bradycardia from 210 min and pirenzepine 10 mg after 60 min. After prior beta-blockade, the bradycardic action of the anti-cholinergic drugs was more marked. Pirenzepine-induced bradycardia was reversed by higher doses of atropine. It is suggested that atropine- and pirenzepine-induced bradycardia results from M1-blockade of sympathetic ganglia. In addition, low concentrations of atropine and therapeutic doses of pirenzepine may cause an increase in acetylcholine, perhaps due to a presynaptic effect on nerve endings.", 
    "45": "This study was designed to: (1) determine plasma midazolam concentrations producing adequate sedation in ICU patients; (2) establish an intravenous regimen to provide continuous sedation and rapid recovery after discontinuation of infusion. Initially, 13 ICU patients were given midazolam as a bolus injection, 0.20 mg.kg-1 over 30 s in order to define the midazolam plasma concentration corresponding to an adequate level of sedation. The optimal level was reached in a mean time of 61 +/- 26 min and the mean corresponding midazolam plasma concentration was 163 +/- 62 ng.ml-1. Estimations of the main pharmacokinetic parameters (elimination half life: 230 +/- 102 min, total body clearance: 520 +/- 283 ml.min-1, total volume of distribution: 2.23 +/- 1.15 l.kg-1) showed no marked differences with normal patients. From those variables, an infusion regimen (loading dose and maintenance rate) to provide long term (24 to 80 h) sedation was derived in 9 patients. The mean loading dose was 0.33 +/- 0.18 mg.kg-1 over 30 min and the mean continuous infusion dose was 0.06 +/- 0.02 mg.kg-1.h-1. The mean midazolam plasma concentration during infusion was 215 +/- 61 ng.ml-1, and the mean midazolam plasma concentration at the end of infusion was 199 +/- 93 ng.ml-1. The level of sedation was considered as optimal in most patients throughout the study. After discontinuation of infusion, the mean time for normalization of the mental state was 97 min.", 
    "46": "In two studies, we studied the comparative sensitivity of different subjective and objective measures to methylphenidate (10 and 20 mg) and secobarbital (100 mg) versus placebo, and diphenhydramine (50 mg) and diazepam (10 and 20 mg) versus placebo in abstinent alcoholics. Subjective measures used were the Visual Analog Mood Scale and the Profile of Mood States. Objective measures were the Stroop and two microcomputer-controlled tasks developed in our lab - a dual pursuit tracking/reaction time task (P-Trak) and a reaction time task with regular and irregular preparatory intervals (PI) of varying length (Reactest). In addition, several baseline measures (Eysenck Personality Inventory, Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and NIMH Mood Scale Elderly) were evaluated for their correlation to drug response. All three central nervous system depressants impaired performance on Reactest at the longer PIs and showed a main effect with irregular PIs, but only the 20-mg dose of diazepam impaired reaction time at the shortest PI and showed a main effect with regular PIs. On P-Trak, secobarbital and diazepam 20 mg impaired both tracking and reaction time, while methylphenidate 20 mg improved only the reaction time component. Only diazepam 20 mg affected mood. No effects were noted on the Stroop. The implications of these findings are discussed. Both P-Trak and Reactest with long PIs were more sensitive than VAMS, POMS or Stroop to drug effects. As lower doses of central nervous system depressants impaired reaction time only with longer PIs and showed a main effect only with irregular PIs, cognitive effects of these drugs may be missed if only subjective or short, regular PI tasks are examined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "47": "Crude membranes (27,000 x g pellets) from three normal human pancreata were prepared. Muscarinic receptors were investigated by the ability of three antagonists (atropine, pirenzepine, and AF-DX 116) and three agonists (carbamylcholine, oxotremorine, and pilocarpine) to inhibit [3H]NMS binding. These receptors showed for pirenzepine and AF-DX 116 a M2 beta specificity, typical of secretory glands and smooth muscle, that was comparable to that of rat pancreatic membranes, i.e., a low affinity for the two antagonists (Ki of 0.4 and 0.2 microM, respectively). In addition, these receptors were predominantly in a low affinity state for the agonist carbamylcholine (Ki of 100 microM).", 
    "48": "Adinazolam is a new triazolobenzodiazepine bearing an alkyl-amino side chain. A cross-over double-blind placebo controlled study was carried out in 12 healthy volunteers, in order to check the possible interaction between cimetidine and adinazolam after repeated co-administration. Cimetidine or placebo were given during 17 days. Beginning on Day 8 of each treatment, adinazolam was given in the increasing doses following sequence of doses for 3 days: 10 mg b.i.d., 20 mg b.i.d. and 20 mg t.i.d. A pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study was performed on the third day at each dose. A wash-out of three weeks was included between the two treatments. Cimetidine increased significantly the AUC values of both adinazolam and N-desmethyladinazolam, reduced the oral clearance of adinazolam, and prolonged adinazolam's half-life. The digit symbol substitution test was significantly affected at each dose level while the manual dexterity was marginally impaired by adinazolam plus cimetidine. Saftee-up interview and Clyde mood scale indicated an increased sedation under adinazolam plus cimetidine in four subjects.", 
    "49": "Twelve, healthy normal men aged 21-25 years received each of four treatments (triazolam placebo plus caffeine placebo, triazolam 0.50 mg plus caffeine placebo, triazolam 0.50 mg plus caffeine 4 mg/kg, triazolam 0.50 mg plus caffeine 8 mg/kg), double blind, in a Latin-Square design. Triazolam or placebo was administered at 0830 and caffeine or placebo at 1000 and 1245. On two memory tasks, administered at 1015 with an immediate recall and a delayed recall at 1230 following a 90 min nap (1030-1200), both immediate and delayed recall was impaired by triazolam. Neither caffeine dose reversed the impairments. Sleep latency and sleep efficiency were improved by triazolam and not reversed by caffeine. On a performance battery presented at 1300 most measures of performance were impaired by triazolam; in general the caffeine dose of 4 mg/kg partially reversed the effect while the dose of 8 mg/kg completely restored performance.", 
    "50": "Three hundred and fifty seven patients with conspicuous psychiatric morbidity in two general practices in Nottinghamshire, one urban and one rural, were followed up for three years after original assessment. All patients were initially assessed for current mental state, personality status and alcohol problems using standard instruments. Of these patients 131 were diagnosed as suffering from anxiety states and other neurotic disorders. In the three year period 87% had received treatment from the general practitioner and 24% had been referred to a psychiatrist. The most common treatment was a prescription for tricyclic antidepressants (59%) but benzodiazepines were prescribed for the longest period. Only 8% of patients received psychotherapy or behaviour therapy. It is argued that this pattern of treatment represents the best use of current knowledge.", 
    "51": "High-performance liquid chromatography, UV spectrometry and mass spectrometry have established that tablets of sibazon and seduxen contained equal quantities of pharmacologically active component diazepam. Radioligand assays revealed the diazepam blood serum levels twice as high 30 to 45 min after oral administration of seduxen than those after sibazon intake (p. less than 0.05). These differences were no more detectable after 2 to 3 hours. The pharmacokinetic differences could be accounted for by the properties of constituents.", 
    "52": "Responses to focal application of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were compared to synaptic potentials elicited by afferent stimulation of rat visual cortical neurons, using a slice preparation and conventional intracellular recording techniques. GABA produced three types of responses: a brief hyperpolarization (mean reversal potential, -72 mV), brief depolarization (mean reversal potential, -50 mV), or a prolonged hyperpolarization (mean reversal potential, -80 mV). Synaptic potentials included simple or complex EPSPs and EPSPs followed by mono- or biphasic IPSPs. A comparison of the characteristics of the GABA responses and synaptic potentials indicated that GABA may mediate both phases of the IPSP in these cells. Our results suggest that despite differences in the circuitry of the visual cortex as opposed to other neocortical and allocortical (hippocampal) areas (Mountcastle and Poggio, 1968; Colonnier and Rossignol, 1969; Creutzfeldt, 1978; Kuhlenbeck, 1978), the inhibitory control of cortical pyramidal and nonpyramidal neurons by GABA is quite similar.", 
    "53": "The binding of cicletanine to human serum, isolated proteins and red blood cells was studied in vitro by equilibrium dialysis. Our results show this drug is highly bound to serum (97.3%) at therapeutic levels. No saturation to the binding sites was seen. Human serum albumin was shown to mainly responsible for this binding (93.5%) with a saturable process characterized by one binding site with a moderate affinity (K = 75800 M-1) and a non saturable process with a low total affinity (nK = 6400 M-1). Like many basic lipophilic drugs, cicletanine showed a saturable binding to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein with one site and a moderate affinity (K = 38,800 M-1). Its binding to lipoproteins and red blood cells was weak and non saturable. Over the range of therapeutic concentrations, the unbound fraction in blood remains constant (3.6%). Moreover, interactions were studied using bilirubin and non esterified fatty acids at pathological concentrations and these endogenous compounds did not alter cicletanine binding human serum or to human serum albumin likewise cicletanine shared the diazepam-site on HSA but no inhibition could take place between cicletanine and the drugs sharing the same binding site in serum at therapeutic levels.", 
    "54": "An improved reversed-phase liquid chromatographic assay for the anticonvulsant clonazepam in human serum is presented. The drug and two internal standards are extracted from serum with n-butyl chloride at pH 9.2, back-extracted into 2 N HCl, and then extracted at pH 11 into a solvent mixture of chloroform/isopropanol (9:1 by volume). The final extract is evaporated to dryness, reconstituted, and injected into a cyanopropylsilane liquid chromatography column with a mobile phase of 0.5 N acetic acid, acetonitrile, and n-butylamine (59:41:0.005 by volume, respectively). Linearity to 400 micrograms/L was demonstrated, and the detection limit was found to be approximately 5 micrograms/L. Relative recovery from serum as compared to water was approximately 100% for clonazepam and the two internal standards, flunitrazepam and desmethyldiazepam. Within-run precision at 40 micrograms/L was demonstrated by a coefficient of variation (CV) of 2.60% (flunitrazepam internal standard) and 2.53% (desmethyldiazepam internal standard). Between-day multiple analyst precision was demonstrated by a CV of 8.98% (mean 10.09 micrograms/L, n = 77) and 6.51% (mean 28.14 micrograms/L, n = 81) using either internal standard. Capacity factor diagrams reveal at least a dual mechanism separation. Chromatograms of the analysis of clonazepam and other benzodiazepines are presented. The extraction has been optimized for selectivity, thereby minimizing interference from drugs and other extraneous compounds. The chromatographic system has been optimized for speed, efficiency, resolution, and stability and avoids the problem of carbamazepine interference that is commonly encountered with other reversed-phase procedures using octylsilane or octadecylsilane columns.", 
    "55": "Eleven children with seizures were treated with clonazepam by rectal route. Thirty minutes after the administration, the plasma (8 to 28 ng/ml) and CSF (0.9 to 2.26 ng/ml) levels were satisfactory and correlated with a good clinical result. Since the tolerance of the drug was excellent, clonazepam appears to be as useful as diazepam in the management of childhood seizures.", 
    "56": "Six healthy volunteers received oxazepam 15 mg i.v. and orally at an interval of at least one week. The kinetic variables of i.v. oxazepam were: elimination half-life (t1/2 beta) 6.7 h, total clearance (CL) 1.07 ml.min-1.kg-1, volume of distribution (Vc) 0.27 l.kg-1 (0.21-0.49) and volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) 0.59 l.kg-1. The intravenous disposition of unbound oxazepam was characterized by a clearance of 22.5 ml.min-1.kg-1 and a distribution volume of 12.3 l.kg-1. After oral oxazepam the peak plasma level was reached in 1.7 to 2.8 h. The plasma t1/2 beta at 5.8 h was not significantly different from the i.v. value. Absorption was almost complete, with a bioavailability of 92.8%. Urinary recovery was 80.0 and 71.4% of the dose after intravenous and oral administration, respectively. Renal clearance (CLR) of the glucuronide metabolite was 1.10 ml.min-1.kg-1 (0.98-1.52). Oxazepam was extensively bound to plasma protein with a free fraction of 4.5%.", 
    "57": "The antagonistic effect of various antidepressants and of alprazolam on muscarinic and histamine H1 receptors has been studied in the guinea-pig ileum, and those on histamine H2 receptors on rat uterus. All antidepressants act like competitive antagonists on muscarinic and histamine H1 and H2 receptors. Alprazolam has shown competitive antagonism on muscarinic and histamine H1 receptors, and noncompetitive antagonism on histamine H2 receptors. Large differences in anticholinergic activity appear between the drugs studied, whereas all of them showed a higher histamine H1 receptor antagonistic activity. Most of the drugs studied showed a histamine H2 receptor antagonistic activity similar to that of cimetidine.", 
    "58": "An epidemiologic study was conducted to observe patient-reported use and effects of triazolam, flurazepam, and oxazepam taken at bedtime among 2260 outpatients age 65 years or older in Canada. The study used pharmacy-based enrollment, with participant follow-up through a 3-day diary and a telephone interview. The study also evaluated how the three benzodiazepine hypnotics were prescribed. Prescription information showed that 66% of the flurazepam prescriptions were for the highest strength, compared to 39% and 35% for triazolam and oxazepam, respectively. As patient age increased, the highest strength of each agent was prescribed less frequently. For all drugs, 53% of prescriptions were written for use as necessary (prn), and the proportion who received such prescriptions increased with age. Patient reports, however, revealed that 57% were using a hypnotic every day, and this regular use increased with advancing age. Regular daily use was more common among those who used triazolam and oxazepam (62%) than those who took flurazepam (42%).", 
    "59": "Studies demonstrating benzodiazepine-induced reductions in plasma norepinephrine (NE) have assumed that changes in circulating plasma NE closely parallel changes in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity and that benzodiazepines suppress SNS outflow. However, decreases in plasma NE could also result from increased removal of NE from plasma via neuronal uptake or tissue metabolism. This study used a tritiated norepinephrine ([3H] NE) isotope dilution technique for measurement of plasma NE kinetics to determine if the fall in plasma NE induced by a single dose of diazepam orally administered to eight psychiatrically-healthy volunteers was due to a fall in plasma NE appearance rate or an increase in plasma NE removal. Diazepam decreased plasma NE appearance, but not clearance, and also decreased plasma epinephrine and mean arterial pressure, memory performance and alertness. Plasma levels of diazepam were correlated with drug effects on memory and alertness but not cardiovascular or SNS effects.", 
    "60": "The affinities of selective, pirenzepine and AF-DX 116, and classical, N-methylscopolamine and atropine, muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonists were investigated in displacement binding experiments with [3H]Pirenzepine and [3H]N-methylscopolamine in membranes from human autoptic tissues (forebrain, cerebellum, atria, ventricle and submaxillary salivary glands). Affinity estimates of N-methylscopolamine and atropine indicated a non-selective profile. Pirenzepine showed differentiation between the M1 neuronal receptor of the forebrain and the receptors in other tissues while AF-DX 116 clearly discriminated between muscarinic receptors of heart and glands. The results in human tissues confirm the previously described selectivity profiles of pirenzepine and AF-DX 116 in rat tissues. These findings thus reveal the presence also in man of three distinct muscarinic receptor subtypes: the neuronal M1, the cardiac M2 and the glandular M3.", 
    "61": "To assess the effects of diazepam in chloroquine poisoning, we studied pentobarbital anesthetized and mechanically ventilated pigs. All the pigs received 50 mg.kg-1 chloroquine given intravenously for 25 min. Eight pigs acted as control (group C). Another 7 were treated with diazepam given intravenously 5 min after the end of chloroquine infusion: 2 mg.kg-1 of diazepam for 2 min, then 1 mg.kg.h-1 for 25 min (group D). Thereafter, all pigs were sacrificed. In both groups the chloroquine infusion induced a large fall in arterial pressure, a decrease in heart rate, and an increase in QRS duration. No difference was observed between the 2 groups for weight, systolic and diastolic arterial pressures, heart rate, QRS and QT durations before diazepam. After diazepam, systolic and diastolic arterial pressures, heart rate, urine volume, urinary excretion of chloroquine, plasma and blood cell chloroquine levels were higher, whereas QRS duration was lower, in group D compared to group C. No difference was observed between the 2 groups for urinary concentration of chloroquine, the ratio between plasma and blood cell chloroquine levels, hepatic, cardiac, and skeletal muscle chloroquine levels, and QT duration. After diazepam, the slope of the regression curve between QRS duration and plasma chloroquine levels was reversed in group D compared to group C. We conclude that diazepam counteracts some haemodynamic and electrocardiographic changes, and increases urinary excretion of chloroquine, in acute experimental chloroquine poisoning.", 
    "62": "The results of previous studies on the effect of diazepam on palate formation in animals have been inconclusive. Teratogen-induced cleft palate is usually caused by a delay in palatal shelf elevation. The present study investigated the effect of diazepam on palate formation in the Sprague-Dawley rat. Five groups of dams received subcutaneous doses of either 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 mg/kg body weight of diazepam. Control dams received propylene glycol (vehicle). Dams in each dosage group were killed at 16.9 (16 d 9 h); 16.16, and 17.9 days of gestation, respectively, to assess delay in palatal shelf elevation. Crown rump length (CRL) of 1,283 fetuses collected from 105 dams was measured. Fetuses in each time/dosage group showed a reduction in CRL (P less than .01). With increasing dosage the number of fetuses showing delayed palatal shelf elevation was significantly increased (P less than .01). These results demonstrate that with an increase in dose there is an increased delay in palatal shelf elevation and a decrease in CRL. However, in this strain there seems to be a rapid prenatal recovery, resulting in a marked reduction in the incidence of delayed palatal shelf elevation.", 
    "63": "Lorazepam has been identified in the blood plasma of non-medicated rats by means of HPLC and gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. It was found to be present in about 1 ng per ml blood plasma. This pharmacologically highly active compound is the first dichlorinated benzodiazepine described to occur naturally in a tissue of mammals, not treated with benzodiazepines.", 
    "64": "The antiulcer effects of two classical antisecretory agents, cimetidine and pirenzepine, were compared with those of prostaglandin E2 and carbenoxolone sodium. The acid inhibitory action of drugs was not important in our study since the ulcer model employed consisted of perfusing the stomach continuously, at a high intraluminal pressure (120 mm H2O), with a simulated gastric juice (0.1 M HCl plus 600 mg pepsin/l). Cimetidine and pirenzepine failed to inhibit gastric erosions, whereas prostaglandin E2 and carbenoxolone greatly reduced the severity of the mucosal lesions. Long-term treatment with cimetidine did not prevent gastric damage. These findings indicate that pure antisecretory agents do not directly increase the capacity of the mucosa to resist damage.", 
    "65": "A clinical study was performed investigating the ability of intravenous midazolam to cause amnesia for visual, auditory and painful stimuli presented during surgical removal of third molars. Various stimuli were presented prior to and after administration of a sufficient quantity of midazolam to produce profound sedation. Recall was then tested immediately after, one day, and one week following the surgery. The study found that midazolam produces at least 20 minutes of profound amnesia for all stimuli in 93 +/- 6% of individuals. However, little correlation was found between the dose of midazolam and the duration of amnesia. Anesthesia literally means the loss of sensation. In the clinical dental situation, the principle sensation lost, when using either regional or general anesthesia, is pain perception. Although prevention of pain sensation is the primary reason patients request local anesthesia prior to invasive dental care, for many patients, control of pain only partially prepares them to receive dental care. These patients request the adjunctive use of sedation or general anesthesia, not for further pain control, but rather requiring periodontal or oral/maxillofacial surgery in which such factors as the sight and taste of blood, the noise of bone-cutting equipment, or the pressure placed on the jaws is not eliminated by local anesthetics. Although effective anxiolytic oral, inhalational, or parenteral agents have been available for several decades, patients still usually retain their memory of events occurring during their dental care, particularly anxiety-provoking events. This memory of the uncomfortable portions of dental care stimulates additional anxiety so that patients may procrastinate when dental care is necessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "66": "The effects of sodium valproate (25-200 mg/kg i.p.) were investigated in the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety in the rat. No single dose significantly increased the percentage of entries made onto the open arms. Chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) both acutely and after 5 days of administration significantly increased the percentage of entries onto open arms and this anxiolytic effect was neither potentiated, nor antagonised, by sodium valproate (25-200 mg/kg). Chlordiazepoxide also increased the total number of arm entries (indicating a stimulant effect). When valproate (25-100 mg/kg) was given together with acute chlordiazepoxide it produced a dose-related antagonism of this stimulant effect. The group receiving valproate (200 mg/kg) plus acute chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) had a total number of entries significantly lower than the controls. Thus, the combination of 2 non-sedative doses resulted in a significant sedative effect.", 
    "67": "The effects of reserpine on the in vivo binding of 3H-Ro 15-1788, (Ro 15-1788:ethyl 8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H- imidazo[1,5a][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) a selective benzodiazepine antagonist, in the mouse brain were investigated. The biodistributions of tracer amounts of 3H-Ro 15-1788 in mice were significantly altered by pretreatment with reserpine (2.5 or 5.0 mg/kg, 24 h before the tracer administration). The time courses of radioactivity in the brain and the blood following i.v. injection of 3H-Ro 15-1788 with carrier Ro 15-1788 were not changed by pretreatment with reserpine, which suggested that the specific binding process might be altered by reserpine. The degree of alteration in the in vivo binding of 3H-Ro 15-1788 seemed to be dependent upon the dose of reserpine and the duration after the treatment of reserpine. The maximum changes in the biodistribution of 3H-Ro 15-1788 were observed at 1 day after injection of reserpine. The body temperature and the brain monoamine contents (dopamine, norepinephrine and 5-hydroxytryptamine) in mice were measured as indicators of pharmacological effects of reserpine, and good relationships to the degree of changes in the biodistribution of 3H-Ro 15-1788 and either the body temperature or brain monoamine contents, were observed. Furthermore, the changes in the biodistribution of 3H-Ro 15-1788 in the reserpinized mice were significantly suppressed by anti-depressant imipramine treatment. These results suggest that it would be possible to detect the in vivo drug interaction with brain benzodiazepine receptors in the living human brain using 11C-Ro 15-1788 and positron emission tomography (PET).", 
    "68": "The effects of three different benzodiazepine receptor ligands viz: diazepam, Ro 5-4864, and Ro 15-1788 on the mitotic activity of rat thymus were investigated. It was found that a single injection of diazepam resulted in a significant increase of the mitotic activity of the thymus cells 36 and 48 hours after drug administration. In contrast, Ro 5-4864 significantly depressed the mitotic activity rate 24 and 36 hours after injection. No significant change after the administration of Ro 15-1788 was found. These findings suggest the involvement of both central and peripheral benzodiazepine receptor in the control of thymus cell proliferation.", 
    "69": "In order to study the functional consequences of brain changes caused by early malnutrition, rats were fed a protein-deficient diet from birth until 49 days of age and a balanced diet from day 50 to day 70. The animals were submitted to a step-down inhibitory avoidance task and to the flinch-jump nociceptive test at 49 and 70 days of age. Malnourished rats showed longer step-down latencies and lower flinch and jump thresholds than eutrophic animals. Chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg, ip) shortened step-down latency of well-nourished rats, whereas it failed to do so in malnourished rats. Since well-nourished animals also became resistant to chlordiazepoxide when tested with a higher shock intensity, generating avoidance latencies comparable to those of malnourished animals, we conclude that the drug resistance induced by malnutrition may be secondary to enhanced pain sensitivity and/or reactivity.", 
    "70": "Chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg), administered on eight successive acquisition sessions, impaired a light-cued, successive discrimination in male Sprague-Dawley rats by increasing the number of incorrect responses. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 (5 and 10 mg/kg) reversed the discrimination impairment and reduced the number of incorrect responses in a generally dose-dependent manner when co-administered with chlordiazepoxide. These findings suggest that the impairment of successive discrimination by chlordiazepoxide is mediated by central benzodiazepine receptor sites. When administered alone, however, the 10 mg/kg dose of Ro 15-1788 (but not the 5 mg/kg dose) produced a mild benzodiazepine-like impairment in discrimination, which was accompanied by a small but significant increase in incorrect responses. These findings suggest that Ro 15-1788 may also have some intrinsic action of its own, which needs to be assessed independently of its use as a mediational research tool.", 
    "71": "1. The effect of pirenzepine, an antimuscarinic compound, on basal acid and pepsin secretion and on the kinetic characteristics (Vmax and ED50) of pentagastrin-stimulated gastric secretion was investigated in 11 duodenal ulcer male patients. 2. Each patient underwent two pentagastrin dose-response tests: one with placebo and the other with pirenzepine given as a 10-mg intravenous bolus followed by 2.5 mg/h continuous infusion. 3. Pirenzepine induced a marked reduction in basal acid secretion (4.4 vs 0.3 mEq/h) and pepsin secretion (76.3 vs 18.3 mPU/h). 4. The drug also caused a reduced response of parietal cells to pentagastrin, which resulted in an increase in ED50 (131 vs 299 ng kg-1 h-1). The maximal acid secretory response (Vmax) was reduced (40.9 vs 32.3 mEq/h), but this effect was not demonstrable when the result was expressed as total output minus basal output. 5. Pentagastrin-induced pepsin secretion was not significantly affected by pirenzepine. 6. We conclude that the inhibitory action of pirenzepine on gastric acid secretion results from the effect of the drug on basal secretion and on parietal cell responsiveness to stimuli.", 
    "72": "The effects of single 10 mg oral doses of the antidepressant mianserin on psychomotor performance, subjective sedation and supine and standing blood pressure were compared in ten young and nine elderly healthy volunteers. Immediate and residual sedation following this subtherapeutic dose was readily detected in both groups. In contrast to previous studies with benzodiazepines, the sedation effect was not accentuated in the older subjects. Subjective awareness of sedation was significant in the young but not, however, in the elderly. \"First-dose\" postural hypotension, presumably due to post-synaptic alpha-blockade also occurred in young subjects only. Caution may be needed on initial dosage of mianserin in young individuals who drive or undertake skilled tasks and in the elderly who may be unaware of psychomotor impairment. The reported alpha 2 receptor selectivity of mianserin might explain the lack of postural effects in the elderly, and might constitute a potentially useful characteristic in the development of new compounds.", 
    "73": "Two series of experiments examined whether 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) antagonists induce feeding in rats. In the first series of experiments separate groups of rats were injected with various doses of methysergide, cyproheptadine, metergoline or ritanserin prior to a 2 h period of access to a wet mash diet which induced vigorous feeding under control conditions. None of the antagonists increased food intake in this paradigm. Rather, at certain doses, methysergide, cyproheptadine and ritanserin induced slight decreases in food intake. Since 5-HT may be involved in controlling satiety, it may be that a more appropriate test of the efficacy of these compounds involves administering them to maximally satiated rats. Consequently, the effects of these drugs were investigated in groups of rats which had fed to satiety immediately prior to drug treatment. In this paradigm methysergide, metergoline and ritanserin, but not cyproheptadine, induced definite increases in food intake. It is suggested that this effect occurs via a dissipation of satiety signals, and that these results further support the hypothesis that 5-HT is involved in controlling satiety. The possibility that these antagonists act on peripheral 5-HT systems is discussed."
